Steve:  

I've been discussing some of the Back Web issues with Mike Harris from EES.  
I don't think the IBM proprietary software will be an issue, but we still 
have to sort out conflicts with TIBCO -- which appears to be quite a popular 
tool at Enron.  

Now that I have analyzed this project with my IT hat on, I would like to 
suggest that we enlist the services of a business analyst from Enron Net 
Works.  We do have a technical team (2 members) from ENW, but they are 
focused on the architecture and design of the system and might inadvertantly 
miss some of the user-specific issues involved with a roll-out of this 
magnitude.   ENW will have ultimate responsiblity for deploying BackWeb and 
it would be in their best interests to assign a business analyst at the front 
end.  In fact, it is probably appropriate to have a business analyst from EES 
and one from ETS working on this team, as well.  We have to keep field 
personnel in mind with a project of this scope, and the business units will 
understand the unique issues of their own users much better than we at Corp 
could hope to do.  The Windows 2000 teams at each business unit would 
probably have the most suitable people to commit to this project, as they 
have so recently undertaken a similar deployment.

I want to be sure we are including everyone who should be involved.  Courtney 
and I can certainly speak to the requirements for Corp, but I don't want to 
presume to speak for EES or ETS.

Does this sound reasonable to you?  If so, I will contact the appropriate 
people at ENW, EES and ETS to find a business analyst from each group.

Thanks.

RETAIL MARKTERS SEE OPPORTUNITY IN NONTRADITIONAL
WAYS TO GROW CUSTOMER BASE
With a tight supply-demand balance for natural gas and power in most US 
regions,
CERA sees another difficult year ahead for retail marketers.

* Nontraditional means of acquiring customer bases may offer a better
opportunity for retail marketers to build market share in 2001 in order to be
better positioned when more attractive retail market opportunities open in
2002.

* Competitive retail suppliers are looking closely at supplying the regulated
customer base (through standard offer or default service) and municipal
aggregation to build customer base.

Movements by regulators to reset prices below market standard offers for 
power are
improving market conditions in several US Northeast states.

Wholesale electric prices soar anew 
By Carrie Peyton
Bee Staff Writer 
(Published Dec. 13, 2000)

With wholesale prices again soaring on California's biggest power-trading 
market, grid operators called the year's 30th "stage two" electric emergency 
Tuesday. 
One consumer group estimated that if those prices continued and were passed 
along to ratepayers, the average Californian's electric bill would be $620 in 
December. 
Electric rates are currently frozen, although Pacific Gas and Electric Co. 
and Southern California Edison are fighting in federal court and before the 
state Public Utilities Commission to end the freeze and pass along their 
costs. 
Although prices reached $1,500 a megawatt-hour Tuesday on the California 
Power Exchange, where most of the state's electricity is traded, problems 
with new trading rules drove the average price much lower. 
The issue, which revolves around how prices should be revised to reflect 
space crunches on transmission lines, is fueling anxiety between two 
California power agencies, the PX and the Independent System Operator, which 
runs the transmission grid. 
On Tuesday, the glitch produced two sets of prices -- an average of $1,182 a 
megawatt-hour before the transmission calculations dropped it to $258. 
One year ago, the average PX price was about $30. 
The issue is expected to simmer at least until Friday, when the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission will consider the state's electricity chaos. 
Meanwhile, Tuesday's wholesale costs fueled more calls to re-regulate 
electricity. 
"The prices that we're seeing are so out of whack ... it's just obscene," 
said Doug Heller, a consumer advocate with the Foundation for Taxpayer and 
Consumer Rights, which promises a 2002 ballot initiative on the issue. 
As the ISO declared a "stage two" emergency Tuesday and called for continuing 
efforts to conserve electricity, the agency's chief operating officer, Kellan 
Fluckiger, predicted that more power could soon be available. 
Power plants capable of generating 1,000 to 1,500 megawatts are expected back 
on line by the end of the week, Fluckiger said. 
By week's end, only about 7,000 megawatts of capacity might be off line, he 
said, compared with 11,000 megawatts last week.

Planned Enron Plants Jolts Japan Power Industry - Nikkei

Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

TOKYO (Nikkei)--Enron Corp. unveiled plans Wednesday to have subsidiary 
E-Power KK build a liquefied natural gas -fueled power plant with an output 
capacity of 2 million kilowatts in Aomori Prefecture, Northern Japan, sending 
a shock wave through the Japanese electric power industry, the Nihon Keizai 
Shimbun reported in its Thursday morning edition. 
The Texas-based energy company aims, from around 2007, to supply electric 
power to large-lot users in the Tohoku and Tokyo metropolitan regions at 
prices lower than those charged by domestic utilities. It may double the 
output capacity to 4 million kilowatts in the future, the business daily 
reported.
The scale of the project is highlighted by the fact that electric power 
demand in Aomori Prefecture peaks at 1.33 million kilowatts in summer, the 
report said. 
E-Power, a joint venture launched by Enron with Orix Corp. (IX or 8591), also 
intends to build coal-fueled power plants with an output capacity of about 
500,000kw each in Fukuoka and Yamaguchi Prefectures, Western Japan. 
These projects would give Enron an output capacity that would put it in the 
same league as Hokkaido Electric Power Co. (J.HEP or 9509), Hokuriku Electric 
Power Co. (J.HKE or 9505) and Shikoku Electric Power Co. (J.SEP or 9507). 
An official of the Ube Chamber of Commerce and Industry welcomed Enron's plan 
to build a plant in the Yamaguchi Prefecture town, saying it "will help 
promote the local economy." 
Many Japanese cities have seen the hollowing out of their industrial base 
since the collapse of the bubble economy. 
Some industry watchers, however, questioned the viability of Enron's plans, 
saying that the U.S. energy firm could only undersell domestic utilities by 
raising its output capacity to a significantly high level. But to do so, they 
explained, Enron will not only need to shell out a large amount of investment 
capital, but also clear other obstacles such as winning favorable 
environmental assessments and building facilities to unload fuel. 
Most importantly, the scope of Japan's deregulation of the retail market for 
electric power must be expanded further if Enron hopes to successfully carry 
out its plans, they said, according to the report. -0- 29/11/00 23-28G

USA: Enron's Skilling sees demise of integrated energy firms.

11/29/2000
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2000.

HOUSTON, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. President and Chief Operating Officer 
Jeff Skilling said on Wednesday he expects technology to lead to the demise 
of the traditional "vertically integrated" energy company whose operations 
run from oil exploration to selling gasoline at the pump. 
"I think what you are going to see is the disintegration of this business 
into hundreds and maybe thousands of smaller enterprises that are tied 
together electronically or virtually," Skilling told the Arthur Andersen 
Energy Symposium in Houston.
Enron, which began as a natural gas pipeline operator, seized opportunities 
created by energy deregulation to become North America's biggest wholesale 
marketer of gas and electricity. It has also been a pioneer in the use of the 
Internet to trade gas and power and a growing number of non-energy 
commodities. 
Skilling said industrial companies had been integrated in the past to cut 
down on the transaction costs involved at different stages of the production 
chain. 
However, technology, particularly Internet technology, was causing such 
transaction costs to plummet, thus undermining the rationale for vertical 
integration, he said. 
Big integrated companies would be forced to recognize that they could not be 
the lowest cost producer of crude oil, the lowest cost refiner and the lowest 
cost gasoline marketer, he said. 
Skilling predicted this would lead to the breaking up of big integrated 
companies and the emergence of many smaller specialist companies which 
enjoyed significant cost advantages in their own particular field. 
Skilling said today's big vertically integrated energy companies were an 
anachronism from the days of Standard Oil founder John D. Rockefeller. 
"It's an industry structure that was designed by John D. Rockefeller in 1870 
and it hasn't changed much in 130 years. I think it will change a lot over 
the next 10 or 15 years," he said.

PUC Approves Plan for New Power Company to Supply Energy to PECO Customers

11/29/2000
PR Newswire
(Copyright (c) 2000, PR Newswire)

HARRISBURG, Pa., Nov. 29 /PRNewswire/ -- Approximately 299,000 PECO 
residential customers will receive discounted electricity from the New Power 
Company next year under a plan approved today by the state Public Utility 
Commission (PUC). 
Customers choosing to participate in the program will receive power from New 
Power beginning in January 2001 and through January 2004. New Power is a 
joint effort by Enron, America Online and IBM. PECO will continue to provide 
transmission and distribution service.
PUC Communications Manager Kevin Cadden explained that the customers would be 
randomly selected from those who have not shopped for an alternative supplier 
under the state's electric competition program. 
"PECO will select customers who have not actively participated in our 
program," he said. "However, customers have the right to opt out of this 
program and to return to PECO at any time without a penalty. They may also 
choose to shop for a supplier other than New Power or PECO." 
Today's action is intended to create more competition in the Philadelphia 
area by allowing a competitor to provide default service to PECO customers. 
Customers who do not shop under the state's electric competition law 
automatically continue to receive electricity from their local electric 
company. 
The PUC directed PECO in the utility's 1998 restructuring order and in its 
merger application with Unicom to develop a plan beginning in 2001 for 
assigning at least 20 percent of its residential customers to another 
supplier. 
The company asked for competitive bids on the proposal on August 24 and 
selected New Power on October 3.

PG&E, Sempra, Morgan Stanley Defendants In Calif Lawsuit

11/29/2000
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Energy marketing and trading companies that conduct 
business in California were named in a lawsuit filed in San Diego Superior 
Court Wednesday alleging traders "fixed" wholesale power prices and conspired 
with other companies to raise the "market clearing bid" for energy sold into 
the state's Power Exchange, resulting in more than $1 billion in electricity 
overcharges last summer. 
The complaint names as defendants PG&E Energy Trading, a unit of PG&E Corp. 
(PCG), Dynegy Power Marketing Inc. (DYN), Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc., 
Enron Energy Services and Enron Power Marketing Inc (ENE), Reliant Energy 
Services, a unit of Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) Sempra Energy Trading and 
Sempra Energy Resoures, a unit of Sempra Energy Inc. (SRE) Southern Company 
Energy Marketing (SO), Williams Energy Marketing and Trading and Williams 
Energy Services Co., Duke Energy Trading and Marketing LLC (DUK) and NRG 
Energy (NRG).
The complaint, filed on behalf of sole plaintiff Ruth Hendricks pending class 
action status by a judge, alleges the companies "anticompetitive conduct 
included combining to restrain the amount of energy available through the 
(CalPX) and ISO energy markets, conspiring to illegally obtain and trade 
information relating to energy supply, pricing and demand, and combining to 
raise the market clearing bid for electric energy on the CalPX wholesale 
markets." -By Jason Leopold; Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874;

Alberta Cancels Power Deregulation, Continue to Set Prices
11/29/0 18:27 (New York)

Alberta Cancels Power Deregulation, Continue to Set Prices

     Edmonton, Alberta, Nov. 29 (Bloomberg) -- The Canadian
province of Alberta canceled an auction of electricity production
and won't open its power markets next year as planned because of
consumers' fears that deregulation will boost prices.
     The government yesterday shelved plans to allow suppliers to
charge consumers market rates for electricity starting Jan. 1, and
canceled price increases it had previously approved.
     To prepare for competition, the government in August
auctioned rights to buy electricity from Alberta's power plants
for C$1.17 billion ($760 million).
     Buyers in the auction expected to be able to re-sell the
power at market prices, which can surge during heat waves or
shortages. Now regulators will continue to set the rates at which
power can be sold, limiting potential returns. In addition, the
government canceled plans to auction off four more power-sale
contracts today.
     One of the bidders in the earlier auction was Houston-based
Enron Corp., the world's biggest energy trader. It paid C$294.8
million to buy the output of a 706-megawatt power plant for 20
years. Enron spokesman Eric Thode said the company is still
evaluating Alberta's announcement.
     Rate-increase hearings at the Alberta Energy and Utilities
Board have been suspended. The province said it will create
regulations for electricity suppliers and the Power Pool of
Alberta, which auctions electricity from the province's
generators.
     Power import and export regulations for the pool will also be
changed, the government said.
     Last week the Globe & Mail newspaper reported officials from
Canada's Competition Bureau raided offices of Powerex Corp., the
energy trading arm of the British Columbia Hydro & Power
Authority, and Enron's Canadian unit, alleging the companies
conspired to raise electricity prices through the Pool.
     Enron fell $8.19 to $70.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.

Enron Plans to Seek Approval for Power Plant in Northern Japan

Enron Plans to Seek Approval for Power Plant in Northern Japan

     Houston, Nov. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the world's
largest energy trader, said it will seek government approval to
build a natural-gas-fired power plant in northern Japan, a company
spokeswoman said.
     The plant, Enron's first in Japan, would be capable of
generating 2,000 megawatts, enough to light 2 million U.S. homes,
said Jackie Gentle, an Enron spokeswoman. It would take at least
six years to get the plant built and operating, she said. Gentle
said Enron wouldn't provide estimates of construction costs.
     The plant would be built by Enron's EPower Corp. unit. EPower
itself is a unit of Encom, in which Enron owns a 68 percent stake.
The rest of Encom is held by Orix Corp., Japan's biggest leasing
company, and private investors, Gentle said.
     EPower is considering building power plants in at least two
other places in Japan, including the southwestern city of Ube,
Gentle said. Japan began opening its electricity market to
competition in March.
     The plant in northern Japan will be fueled with liquefied
gas, Gentle said, requiring construction of a processing plant.
Gas is cooled into a liquid so it can be shipped using special
tankers when no pipelines are available. Almost all of Japan's
natural gas is imported, and arrives liquefied, according to the
U.S. Department of Energy.
     Shares of Enron fell $6.94 to $71.50 in midafternoon trading
amid signs that slowing U.S. economy will reduce energy demand.
Before today, they had risen 77 percent this year.
     Orix fell 10 yen to 10,810. Its shares have fallen 44 percent
since the first of the year.

Hi,
We're going to press on the forced ranking story. I  have a couple more 
questions for you. If you can have answers to me by in the  morning, June 8, 
I'd appreciate it...
?
thanks, Michelle
?
?
What does the room look like in one of these peer  review committee sessions. 
Are the PRC's around a conference table, if so what  kind, cherry wood, 
mahogany, etc. What's on the wall in these rooms?.? Are  there charts, etc?? 
Are the rankings on paper or on the wall? Does everyone  have a copy of the 
rankings?and employee's paper work (ie the feedback  responses, etc.)
?
?
How many employees does one PRC rep represent  generally?
?
Tell me about some of the perks that Enron offers  its employees, ie 
childcare, daycare, daycamp etc. On the day that I was there,  what was that 
barbeque outing all about. Was that something that was company  sponsored? If 
so, how often do you sponsor it?
?
Tell me about some of the awards the company has  received. (ie best 
workplace, etc.)
?
These answers don't have to be long. Just give me  the basics...
?
?
thanks much, Michelle
?

Just a status check....according to Melanie Kinderdine at DOE both Rich Glick 
and Gary Falley are actually still writing the Order.  Secretary Richardson 
"got out ahead of himself" by announcing the Order before it was drafted.  He 
plans to sign and release it tonight.  Melanie will get it to me when it is 
written and signed tonight.  Richardson felt he had to get the news out 
before tomorrow; thus, why he announced it before it was written.

Energy Department Study Warns
Price Controls Will Cause
California Blackouts to Worsen



(WASHINGTON, DC) -- The Department of Energy released a report today that
indicates that proposed wholesale electricity price controls in California
could double the number of rolling blackouts from 113 to 235 hours and
increase the number of households in the dark to about 1.575 million.

The report, The Impact of Wholesale Electricity Price Controls on California
Summer Reliability, was prepared by the Department's Office of Policy at the
request of U.S. Senator Frank Murkowski (R-Alaska).  It evaluates the
probable effect of two alternative price cap proposals and concludes that
they "are likely to increase the number of hours and the magnitude of the
outages that California will experience."

Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham said the study confirms the federal
government's concern regarding price controls.  "The findings of this report
are a clear warning that price controls will not help, but only hurt the
situation in California," Secretary Abraham said.  "Minimizing the number of
blackouts ought to be our principal goal because more intense blackouts
would greatly imperil the health and safety of California's citizens and
would undermine the state's economy at least as much as high prices. Our
analysis is that blackouts will be worse and last longer if price controls
are established."

The two proposals analyzed by the Energy Department are the $150 Hard Cap
and the Cost-Plus-$25 Price Cap advocated by California Governor Gray Davis
and some Western lawmakers.  The report concludes a $150 Hard Cap "could
force as much as 3,600 megawatts of generating capacity in the State to shut
down."  Likewise, a Cost-Plus-$25 price cap results in the delay or
abandonment of about 1,300 megawatts of capacity scheduled to be constructed
in the state.

"The problem with many of the price control proposals made so far is that
they either make it uneconomic for some of the highest cost plants to
operate, or they provide a strong disincentive for adding the type of
peaking capacity California hopes to bring on line this summer through their
expedited siting process," Secretary Abraham said.  "This report confirms
the President's statement made in California that 'Price caps do nothing to
reduce demand and they do nothing to increase supply."

The report also concludes that the price control proposals it analyzed
"could significantly increase blackouts this summer, threatening public
health and safety."  Both proposals directly translate into additional hours
of outages and households affected.  The analysis of the $150 Hard Cap
proposal concludes that the number of hours of blackouts is projected to
more than double to about 235 hours, with the average outage size increasing
about 230 megawatts.  Approximately 175,000 additional households would be
affected.  Similarly, the report projects that the Cost-Plus-$25 Price Cap
proposal will increase the number of hours of expected outages by about 25
percent this summer, with the average outage size increasing about 120
megawatts.  Approximately 90,000 additional households could be affected.

Under current conditions the department expects that California will
experience between 113 hours of rolling blackouts this summer with an
average outage size of about 1,900 megawatts, effecting roughly 1.4
households.  One megawatt is roughly enough energy to power 750 households.

Reliability, can be found on the Department of Energy's web site at

(1) Both the Governor and Steve Reynolds thanked us for the speech and stated 
that it was exactly what they were looking for when they invited us to 
speak.  The Governor wanted the Commission to understand what was going on in 
energy markets outside of the Wyoming borders.

(2) I received a strong reaction from PacifiCorp's reaction to the notion 
that the electric utility industry was moving towards lower interaction costs 
(at the retail level).  Another representative for one of the coal concerns 
made the same comment.  These comments took us towards a discussion of what 
went wrong in California and retail restructuring of electricity.  

I partly agreed with PacifiCorp--i.e., I agreed that we were in a state of 
transition in the wholesale and retail markets.  I also pointed out that:  
(1) we couldn't look at California and reach any conclusion other than they 
messed up; (2) we didn't have an entirely free market in electricity in the 
West--i.e., it's a hybrid of regulation, etc.; and (3) that the model 
discussed in my presentation applied to more than just electricity (a point 
that the Gov. also made).  I said that it applies to wholesale electric 
markets in some areas, coal markets, gas markets, and that the model applies 
in wholesale markets even if the retail markets remain fully regulated.  

I pushed hard to take the discussion away from retail wheeling, restructuring 
etc., because the focus in Wyoming is and will be the commodity and how to 
maximize the value of that commodity for Wyoming.  The Governor on a number 
of occasions tried to steer the discussion in this direction (i.e., away from 
retail).  

(3) Nancy Vanderberg (El Paso--a former Enron employee) sends her regards.  
She asked a question about the impact of the virtual integration on Wyoming.  
I told her that it was affecting Wyoming producers and consumers.  

(4) The CEO from Lower Valley Electric asked how Wyoming can benefit from 
competition in commodity and noted how WalMart uses predatory pricing to kill 
off smaller local competitors.  I responded with the usual--make sure no 
barriers to entry, when the price gets high enough competitors will take on 
WalMart, etc.

(5) Another member of the Commission asked what could be done immediately.  
In response I plugged RTO West and urging FERC to move up the timeline on 
RTOs, ensuring that all customers are treated the same, etc.  The Gov. gave a 
number of strong nods to the suggestion that we expedite RTO West, etc.

(6) The Gov. mentioned wind resources several times in the littany of energy 
resources available to producers in Wyoming.   He also pointed out 
deficiencies in Wyoming-East connections on both gas and electric as well as 
deficiencies in Wyoming-Calfornia pipeline constraints.  


A few more notes on the meeting yesterday in Cheyenne (FYI)

(7) The Governor and the lead staff person on the Energy Commission (Steve 
Reynolds) are both very interested in pursuing discussions with Enron.  I 
affirmed your interest in meeting with the Governor and indicated we would be 
contacting them to arrange a date that was convenient.

(8)  These guys are serious and dedicated.  The Commission was given a $1 
million budget and authority to take legislative and regulatory positions on 
behalf of the state.  During the meeting the Commission approved a series of 
additional meetings, working groups and advisory committees.  Sue Landwehr 
and I will check back with Steve over the next few days to get a list of the 
meetings, working groups, etc.

(9) My conversations with Steve Reynolds clearly indicates that the Governor 
and the Governor's staff are familiar with how commodity markets 
work--particularly ag products.  They understand the concept of basis and 
also understand that energy commodity markets work best when there is 
adequate transmission capacity, gas pipeline capacity and rail capacity.  
They also understand that their are some contraints on the transmission 
system (a complete constraint moving east, off-peak constraints moving north, 
south, and west), limited take away capacity on the one major pipeline 
serving the state (Kern--perhaps due to downstream constraints), and some 
problems with the cost of rail transportation (if not a constraint).  While 
they have a working understanding of all these things, they haven't been able 
to put it all together in a cohesive way.  

(10) Wyoming wants to produce more energy for the west (and the rest of the 
country), but wants to avoid the boom and bust cycle of a resource dependent 
state.  (For example, the state moved from a $250 million deficit in FY 1999 
to an approximately $750 million surplus in FY 2000).  They also want to 
diversify the state's economy and bring economic development.  For example, a 
major focus of the state's Business Council has been to recruit "server 
farms"--because of their load and high load factors.  They talked about 
co-locating server farms and generation along the southern tier of the state 
(which has a large amount of fiber optic bandwidth available). 

(11) The Wyoming PSC held a meeting yesterday afternoon on hedging.  In his 
comments to the Commission, PSC Chairman Steven Ellenbecher said that the 
state should clarify the utility's responsibility to either:  (1) build their 
own power plants; or (2) acquire a portfolio of resources and hedge.  Steve 
talked alot about the volatility in gas markets and electric markets and how 
the utilities that owned their own generation faired the best in 
2000/2001--because the generation acted as a hedge against market prices.  
Steve was also supportive of gas restructuring at the retail level--but 
silent on electric restructuring.

Mary --

Are you drafting responses to this?  I don't see the major issue.  I think we 
need to keep these in line with our larger response.

This is not good.  It seems as if Rozja (Peace's right hand man) or the CPUC 
handed Hoecker the questions and he said:  "Oh, I'll take care of getting the 
answers to these for you!"  Ron Carroll at Bracewell said he would work with 
the CPUC subpoena group in addressing these.

Today, Senators Bob Smith (R-NH) and Harry Reid (D-NV) will introduce an MTBE 
bill. which is expected to be slightly different than we've seen in previous 
Congresses.  

We expect it to include:  

1) a 4-year date certain to eliminate MTBE, with EPA determining the phaseout 
schedule
2)  a lifting of the 2% oxygenate standard upon perfunctory petition by State 
governors within 90 days from date of enactment
3)  and environmental "anti-backsliding" provision focused only on air-toxics 
and using a 2000 baseline with a 27.5% percent standard (the way I understand 
it right now, RFG must perform 27.5% better than 2000 baseline for 
conventional gasoline)
4) provisions for MTBE producer "transition assistance"

Brief analysis:  

We'll have more details shortly, but the bill looks a little better than 
previous efforts.  A number of bills have been introduced this Congress, but 
this will probably be the leading effort.  

As you know, Enron has led efforts to include the "transition assistance" 
piece -- which is still largely undefined in the legislation -- but we are 
pleased with the inclusion of a "placeholder" while the Senate decides on the 
best approach.  We will continue to lead the development of such incentives 
(which will likely take the form of EPA/DOE funding for MTBE producers who 
convert plants to produce iso-octane or alkylate).

An MTBE ban is of course not good, but a "date certain" gives producers more 
flexibility to determine their options rather than reduce production under 
several steps of a phase out.   Allowing states to get a waiver of the oxy 
standard is probably a given in any legislation, but will face some 
opposition from the ethanol community -- who just want a simple MTBE ban.

The anti-backsliding provision is still being refined, but looks fairly 
lame.  We need more details to make an accurate assessment, but its likely 
that environmental groups will want a bit more.

One political factor -- with Sen. Jim Jeffords leaving the Republican party, 
Democrats will be given control of the Senate Environment Committee, which 
will consider this bill.  They will likely allow Jeffords to chair the 
committee.  The significance is that Sen. Bob Smith (R-NH) is the current 
chair, and has been able to use that position to drive his past bills on MTBE 
-- in losing the chairmanship, his legislation may face a longer road through 
Committee.

I will keep you posted as the legislation evolves.

Hey Steve; S
Sorry to bug you, but I'd like to ask howyou want us to include/review the 
MD's on 9 Jan, and whom among that group we should anticipate being reviewed, 
having profiles and data on etc?  We have the normal straight (for lack of a 
better description) MD's; we have the COO's who are also MD's (Lavorato, 
Sunde, Bowen, Mccarty, et. al); and finally we have the former EC members who 
are not Policy Committee (but were, and perhaps still are EC ( i.e. Haug, 
Bannentine, Sanjay, Tom White). 

Should they be :
reviewed all one group, 
divided so that COO's who are also policy committee and will be present on 9 
Jan remain in NR during the main review period, then excused for their reviews
How to handle the former EC members? Are they still EC or effectively MD's of 
another level to be reviewed separately?

Welcome your thoughts and advice on this,

Regards, Gina

PG&E sues state over seizure of long-term power contracts=20
By Dale Kasler
Bee Staff Writer
(Published July 18, 2001)=20
Reopening an old wound in California's energy crisis, Pacific Gas and=20
Electric Co. has sued the state over a group of low-cost energy contracts=
=20
seized almost six months ago by Gov. Gray Davis.=20
The lawsuit, filed Monday in San Francisco Superior Court, stems from the=
=20
collapse of the California Power Exchange and the state's entry into the=20
power-buying business in January.=20
PG&E and Southern California Edison had entered into a series of long-term=
=20
purchase contracts through the exchange, a now-defunct market for buying an=
d=20
selling electricity. But as both utilities collapsed financially and the=20
Power Exchange was clinging to life, the exchange seized the contracts and=
=20
was about to auction them off for nonpayment of bills.=20
That's when Davis stepped in. Using his emergency powers, the governor=20
grabbed control of the contracts, saying he didn't want them resold at=20
inflated prices.=20
At the time, the exchange said the contracts were worth about $1 billion,=
=20
with PG&E's share set at $348 million.=20
But it's likely their value has fallen along with the spot market price of=
=20
electricity. Back when the governor seized them, PG&E's contracts were for=
=20
$60 to $130 a megawatt-hour. That was a bargain at the time, and made the=
=20
contracts very valuable. Now that spot prices have plunged, those contracts=
=20
are no longer such a great deal.=20
PG&E's lawsuit didn't put a value on the contracts. Nevertheless, "the stat=
e=20
has benefited from the contracts," said PG&E spokesman Ron Low. "We should =
be=20
compensated."=20
The state had planned to pay for the contracts, at a price to be determined=

by a state government claims board, said Davis' spokesman Steve Maviglio. B=

he said the state also expected to be taken to court over the issue.=20

Hour of decision: Who will pay for costly power of past, future?


(Published July 18, 2001)=20

In the next few days, state lawmakers and regulators must make some=20
unsettling choices about how to share the financial burdens of California's=
=20
electricity debacle.=20
Looking backward, they will decide how -- or whether -- to erase $3.5 billi=
on=20
in debts run up last year by Southern California Edison, when it bought=20
pricey power but couldn't pass the costs on to consumers. Looking ahead, th=
ey=20
will choose who, if anybody, will get out of paying for expensive power=20
purchased by the state since the utilities ran out of cash last January.=20
In both cases, the principle guiding the decision ought to be the same: No=
=20
one is blameless in getting California into this mess, and no group can=20
escape the pain of getting out of it.=20
Democratic lawmakers in the Assembly are searching in vain for ways to hide=
=20
the real costs from voters. Their idea is to have the large users of power=
=20
(mostly big businesses) pay off Edison's past debts. In return, businesses=
=20
would get some freedom to shop for cheaper power deals in the future.=20
The problem is that there won't be much opportunity to shop in the coming=
=20
years. That's because Gov. Gray Davis went out at the very peak of the mark=
et=20
and bought up most of the state's future electricity supply before it went =
on=20
sale. The strategy of locking most of California's power demand into=20
long-term contracts seemed ill-advised at the time, even more so now.=20
Now that the governor has done all this shopping, the Public Utilities=20
Commission must assure that electric customers will pay for all that=20
electricity -- $43 billion worth of power over the next decade or so. In=20
addition, the PUC must commit customers to repaying the state for the power=
=20
it has already purchased this year -- many billions on top of that. The sta=
te=20
borrowed from itself to buy all this power, and is banking on a bond sale t=
o=20
pay off this debt. Unless a portion of the rate customers pay is dedicated =
to=20
repaying those bonds, they can't be sold.=20
This web of regulation, contracts and finance is so complex, so huge, it's=
=20
hard to see how the energy leaders in a few days will find a graceful, fair=
=20
solution. But for a political compromise to work, all the interests involve=
d=20
must take some pain.=20
Southern California Edison must swallow some of its debt. Power generators=
=20
and the state must renegotiate some of their long-term contracts so that th=
e=20
generators give back some of the bounty they reaped by market manipulation.=
=20
And no consumer, big or small, should be allowed to avoid paying the true=

costs of the power they use. In this reckoning, there's no easy way out for=

anyone -- and especially not for the elected officials who must deliver the=

an amount that Davis wants a judge to determine. At the time they were=20

PG&E Sues State Over Contracts

July 18 2001

SAN FRANCISCO -- PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric Co. utility sued=20

Gov. Gray Davis took away Pacific Gas' 12-month forward contracts to ensure=

California estimated the contracts were worth $150 million.

Pacific Gas claims the contracts had "significant value" because they allow=

Contra Costa will spend as much as $1.7 million to conserve energy at the=

The measure is part of a larger effort the board in March agreed to underta=

A private company will install upgraded heating, ventilation and air=20

"When you turn the system on everything doesn't kick in, everything doesn't=

Sacramento -- Lawmakers are struggling this week to agree on a plan to keep=
=20
Southern California Edison from declaring bankruptcy as they rush to comple=
te=20
business before Friday's scheduled summer recess.=20
After months of talking about a solution and dismissing one agreed to by=20
Edison and Gov. Gray Davis, lawmakers now have several competing proposals =
to=20
consider.=20
A plan introduced last week by Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Sherman=
=20
Oaks (Los Angeles County), was debated for several hours yesterday, along=
=20
with a GOP-backed alternative by Assemblyman Roderick Wright, D-Los Angeles=
.=20
The two plans, which are scheduled for votes today in the Assembly Energy=
=20
Costs and Availability Committee, take sharply different approaches:=20
-- Hertzberg's plan would pay $2.4 billion for Edison's transmission lines =
to=20
help cover the utility's estimated $3.5 billion debt. The utility would be=
=20
allowed to pay off its remaining debt by issuing bonds.=20
The utility would repay the bonds using ratepayer money. For the first two=
=20
years, all customers would pay for the debt, but after that the largest use=
rs=20
would pay off the rest.=20
-- Wright calls his plan a "straight bailout." It would allow the utility t=
o=20
issue bonds to cover all of its debt and impose a $2 a month rate increase=
=20
for all users until the debt is paid.=20
The Senate also introduced its own plan. A bill by Sen. Byron Sher, D-Palo=
=20
Alto, would give the state a five-year option to buy the transmission lines=
=20
and would have the state back only $2.5 billion of the utility's debt.=20
Since Davis announced a deal with Edison earlier this year, lawmakers,=20
business groups and consumer advocates have all expressed reservations with=
=20
one aspect or another of it. Opposition has usually focused on the state=20
purchase of Edison's transmission lines.=20
The flurry of activity this week is an effort by lawmakers to take some kin=
d=20
of vote before they adjourn. The Edison agreement has an Aug. 15 deadline f=
or=20
approval by the Legislature.=20
Brian Bennett, a spokesman for Edison, said creditors view that date as=20
extremely important.=20
"We're as close to bankruptcy as our creditors want us to be," he said. "Is=
=20
it a drop dead date? I don't know, but it is clearly an important date."=20
Consumer groups have denounced Wright's plan, and at least one calls=20
Hertzberg's proposal just another bailout and said it would cost California=
ns=20
$6.7 billion over the next 10 years.=20
"We cannot be seduced by big businesses paying a bailout tax," said Doug=20
Heller, a consumer advocate with the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer=
=20
Rights. "At the end of the day, we know businesses will pass these costs on=
=20
to the consumer."=20
Included in the 76-page Hertzberg bill are provisions that would allow larg=
e=20
companies to buy their power directly from a provider instead of going=20

California's largest utility has sued the state seeking reimbursement of ?m=
illions of dollars in energy contracts seized by the governor. ?San Francis=
co-based Pacific Gas & Electric Co. "has received no compensation ?for the =

and is struggling to repay ?$14.4 billion to thousands of creditors. ?Gov. =
Gray Davis seized the energy contracts on Jan. 31 to keep the California ?P=
ower Exchange from liquidating them. The now-defunct exchange, which had ?b=
een the state's middleman for buying and selling power, wanted the contract=
s ?to recoup hundreds of millions of dollars that PG&E owed it. ?The govern=
or's office acknowledged that California owes PG&E for the ?contracts, an a=
mount that Davis wants a judge to determine. At the time they ?were seized,=
 the state estimated their value at $160 million, while the power ?exchange=
 priced them at $347 million. ?"We seized the contracts to have reasonable =
priced power and expected that ?price to be set in a neutral forum," said S=

uys electricity at a set price rather than ?paying higher prices for power =
bought at the last minute. Therefore, the ?contracts' value changes with th=

mand have left the state ?holding more power than it needs and selling the =
surplus for whatever it can ?get. ?State officials won't say how much they =
are selling the power for, but ?acknowledged unloading surplus electricity.=
 ?``We're seeing certain times of the day where we may not need power that =
we ?previously thought we needed, and we're selling it on the open market,'=
' said ?Oscar Hidalgo, spokesman for the state Department of Water Resource=
s. ``We're ?probably moving a little more power than we anticipated, but I =
don't think ?anybody anticipated a July like we're experiencing.'' ?Utiliti=
es routinely sell surplus contract power when demand is lower than ?expecte=
d. But the state's recent sell-off could fuel criticism that ?California bo=
ught too much power at too high a price, fearing rolling ?blackouts and soa=
ring prices this summer. ?``There's a painful lesson to be learned when you=
 overbuy when supplies are ?tight,'' said Gary Ackerman, executive director=
 of the Western Power Trading ?Forum. ``Anybody can lose money in this busi=
ness, and the state of California ?is getting a taste of that.'' ?The state=
 in the past week has sold anywhere from 10 to 20 percent of its ?available=
 power, Hidalgo said. On Tuesday, the state had up to 40,000 ?megawatts ava=
ilable, while demand hovered around 32,000 megawatts, according ?to the pow=
er grid operator. ?Must be sold ?Because electricity cannot be stored, powe=
r purchased in contracts for a ?later date would be wasted if not used or s=
old. ?``It's better than losing it altogether,'' Hidalgo said. ``The way th=
e ?electricity business is set up, you either use it or move it. You can't =
put ?it in a bottle and put it on a shelf.'' ?State officials would not say=
 how much they've made in sales to offset ?purchase costs, citing concerns =
about jeopardizing their bargaining position. ?According to California Ener=
gy Markets, a trade weekly, the state was ?unloading power last Thursday at=
 $25 per megawatt-hour. Ackerman said the ?state has been selling power for=
 as little as $1 to $5 per megawatt-hour. ?Power was selling on the spot ma=
rket for $20 to $40 per megawatt-hour ?Tuesday. ?The state, which assumed t=
he role of power buyer for California's biggest ?utilities in January, expe=
cted to sell surplus power from time to time, ?although not quite this much=
, Hidalgo said. Even with demand down, the state ?still is buying more powe=
r than it sells, he said. ?With temperatures throughout the West unseasonab=
ly low in recent weeks, other ?utilities also are selling their surplus pow=
er at a loss. ?``That's an accepted operating risk we always assume,'' said=
 Scott Simms, ?spokesman for Portland General Electric, adding that recent =
federal price ?caps are lower than what the Oregon utility paid. ``Sometime=
s you gain, ?sometimes you lose. Hopefully, if you planned well, you end up=
 winning.'' ?Whether the state planned well or overbought is hard to say. T=
he contracts ?could prove invaluable if another heat wave threatens blackou=
ts. Ackerman ?likened power contracts to insurance -- a prudent move to gua=
rd against ?shortages and price spikes, even if it turns out you don't need=
 it. ?At the very least, the current situation underscores the importance o=
f ?weather in the volatile electricity market. Traders pore over forecasts =
and ?even buy weather insurance, Ackerman said. ?Demand and prices have bee=
n so low that some energy companies are shutting ?down the small power plan=
ts called ``peakers.'' ?Hidalgo said the state has no regrets. ?``What we w=
ere doing was making sure we had an available supply with these ?contracts,=
'' Hidalgo said. ``We were facing scarcity in the market early on. ?There w=
asn't enough supply to fulfill the need. What the contracts have done ?is o=
bligated the producers to give us power.'' ?Blackout threat fades ?The stat=
e's daily power costs have fallen from more than $100 million in May ?to le=
ss than $26 million in July, Hidalgo said, and there hasn't been a ?blackou=
t in two months. While some of the surplus power is sold on the ?market, it=
 is also being traded to Northwestern hydropower utilities to cover ?past d=
ebts, he said. ?``This is not a bad position for us to be in,'' Hidalgo sai=
d, adding that the ?situation could always take a turn for the worse. ``We =

 Plaintiff hereby alleges on information and belief based upon the
investigation made by and through her attorneys, as follows:
 I.
 NATURE OF THE CASE

1. This is a class action seeking redress under the law of California
for defendants' conduct in the market for wholesale electricity.  During the
spring and summer of 2000, a group of electricity generators and traders,
including defendants, exercising market power, unlawfully manipulated the
California wholesale electricity market, resulting in grossly inflated
wholesale electricity prices throughout the state and much of the Western
United States. Defendants accomplished this result by, inter alia,
improperly using confidential real time generator capacity, use, and
maintenance data, and transmission system flow data to "game" the wholesale
electricity market, by withholding electrical generating capacity from the
California Power Exchange's forward markets, by improperly parking power
with affiliates in other states which was later resold in California at
inflated rates, by scheduling previously unplanned plant outages to coincide
with other plants' planned maintenance shutdowns, and by scheduling
transmission flows to cause or exacerbate congestion.
2. The improper use of confidential real time data was in violation of
the California Tariff by which  defendants are authorized to sell wholesale
electricity within California.
3. By engaging in said unfair business practices, defendants have
directly and severely damaged purchasers of electricity supplied through the
California Power Exchange.  As noted in the August 30, 2000 San Diego Union
Tribune:  "The utility bills of all [electric] ratepayers in San Diego are
exorbitant. . . . Rates that were 3 cents per kilowatt hour have risen to 19
cents per kilowatt hour in just three months -- nothing short of
confiscatory rates."
 4. In its November 1, 2000 Order, the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission ("FERC") expressly found that electricity prices in California
have been maintained at "unjust and unreasonable" levels during the relevant
period, though it determined that it did not have the authority to mandate
refunds or other retroactive relief with respect thereto.  In its November
22, 2000 response to the November 1st FERC order, the California Public
Utilities Commission (CPUC) concluded that due to market manipulation by
wholesale energy producers and traders, customers of electricity supplied
through the California Power Exchange had been overcharged more than $4
billion dollars during the summer of 2000.  In its November 22nd response to
the November 1st FERC order, even the California Independent System Operator
(CAISO) which manages California's transmission system infrastructure, known
as the "power grid", found that the summer 2000 prices resulted from the
exercise of intolerable levels of market power by generators and traders.
 II.
 VENUE

5. Venue is proper because defendants each transact business in the
State of California and because the damages caused by defendants' unlawful
manipulation of the price of wholesale electricity occurred in San Diego
County.
III.
 PARTIES

6. Plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon is an adult resident living in San Diego,
California.  Plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon is a retail electricity customer of
SDG&E, and has been forced to pay rates for electricity during the Class
Period (defined infra) that are unjust and unfair and that have been
artificially inflated by defendants' misconduct.  Moreover, plaintiff Pamela
R. Gordon was born with no lymph nodes in her legs which results in a lack
of circulation.  Exposure to high temperatures will cause plaintiff Pamela
R. Gordon's legs to swell, which can lead to possible severe health
consequences.  As a result of her condition, plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon must
maintain her home at temperatures of not more than 67 degrees at night and
71 degrees during the day.  Plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon is unable to
terminate her electricity service and has been forced to pay unjust and
unfair rates for electricity from SDG&E as a result of defendants'
misconduct.  Specifically, plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon was charged and/or
paid the following rates for electricity by SDG&E during the Class Period:

partnership with defendant Dynegy, NRG operates eight electricity generating
plants in California which supply wholesale electricity to the California
Power Exchange.
12. Defendant AES Corporation (hereinafter "AES") is an Arlington,
Virginia based public corporation doing business in the state of California
as AES Pacific Group, a generator and trader of wholesale electricity which
is ultimately sold to California consumers, including plaintiffs and the
class, and a WSCC member.  AES Pacific Group operates four electricity
generating plants in southern California which supply wholesale electricity
to the California Power Exchange.
13. Defendant Williams Energy is a Tulsa, Oklahoma based public
corporation doing business in the state of California as Williams Energy
Marketing and Trading Company, a generator and trader of wholesale
electricity which is ultimately sold to California consumers, including
plaintiffs and the class, and a WSCC member.  Williams Energy Marketing and
Trading Company operates three electricity generating plants in southern
California which supply wholesale electricity to the California Power
Exchange.
14. Defendant Duke Energy North America (hereinafter "Duke Energy") is a

of wholesale electricity which is ultimately sold to California consumers,
including plaintiffs and the class, and a WSCC member. Duke Energy operates
four electricity generating plants in California which supply wholesale
electricity to the California Power Exchange.
 15. Defendants DOES 1 through 100, inclusive, are sued herein under
fictitious names because their true names are unknown to the Plaintiff.
When their true names and capacities are ascertained, Plaintiff will amend
this complaint by substituting their true names and capacities herein.
Plaintiff is informed and believe, and based thereon alleges, that each of
the fictitiously named Defendants is responsible in some manner for the
occurrences herein alleged, and thereby proximately caused injuries and
damages to Plaintiff, as herein alleged.  Further, Plaintiff is informed and
believes, and upon such information and belief alleges, that each of the
Defendants designated by a fictitious name participated in and/or benefited
from the wrongful acts, conduct, and omissions described in this complaint,
and that said acts, conduct, and omissions directly and proximately caused
injury and damages to Plaintiff and the class as alleged below.
 IV.
 CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS

16. Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Section 382 of the Code of
Civil Procedure as a class action on behalf of all electricity customers,
including the retail customers of San Diego Gas & Electric Company (SDG&E),
who purchased electricity supplied through the California Power Exchange
during the period from May 22, 2000 through and including the date of trial
(hereinafter the "Class Period").  All such persons and entities have paid
and/or have been charged prices for electricity that were "unjust and
unreasonable" and that were artificially inflated due to defendants'
exercise of market power, improper use of confidential information,
manipulations, and unlawful actions.  Members of the Class are extremely
numerous and their joinder would be impracticable.  Approximately 1.2
million SDG&E customers are within the class.
17. Common issues of fact and law predominate over individual issues,
including:
-whether defendants committed unfair business practices by sharing
confidential real time data in violation of ISO Tariffs and thereafter
"gamed" the market;

-whether defendants charged "unjust and unreasonable" prices for electricity
during the Class Period or otherwise benefited from said inflated price for
electricity;

-whether defendants exercised "market power" in the California electricity
market during the Class Period;

-whether defendants received improper and excess profits which should be
refunded and paid to members of the Class.

18. Plaintiff's interests are typical of, and not antagonistic to, the
interests of the class.
19. Plaintiff has retained competent counsel experienced in class action
and consumer fraud litigation and intends to vigorously prosecute this
action.
20. A class action is superior to all other methods for the fair and
efficient adjudication of this controversy.  The size of the individual
damages is small in comparison to the complexity and scope of the
defendants' operations and alleged misconduct.  A class action is the only
method whereby plaintiff and the class can efficiently seek redress and
obtain a uniform adjudication of their claims. Plaintiff does not anticipate
any difficulty with the management of this action.

  V.
 COMMON ALLEGATIONS OF FACT

A. The California Wholesale Electricity Markets

21. In 1996 California deregulated its electricity industry and required
the State's privately owned utility companies to divest themselves of their
generating plants.  The purpose of deregulation was to introduce competition
into the electricity markets, with the intention of reducing rates for
electrical power.  In fact, however, certain participants in this recently
deregulated industry have, in violation of their operating Tariff, taken
advantage of structural flaws in the system and improperly obtained
confidential competitor information to artificially inflate prices for
electricity, yielding themselves billions of dollars in windfall profits at
the expense of California consumers.
22. As part of the deregulation, several new entities were created to
facilitate the workings of this new market.  California's investor owned
utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), Southern California Edison (SCE),
and San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) (the"Utilities"), now purchase
electricity for their customers from independent generators and traders,
including defendants, through a market known as the California Power
Exchange (PX).  The PX maintains a market for the purchase and sale of
wholesale electricity through a variety of forward contracts and real time
markets.  Under the California deregulatory scheme, the Utilities were,
until just recently, required to purchase power through the PX and
prohibited from independently contracting for power outside this market.
23. The deregulated market also led to the creation of the California
Independent System Operator (CAISO).  The CAISO is an "independent"
non-profit corporation, though its managing board includes representatives
from among the generators and traders, that was created to manage the flow
of electricity and ensure reliability along the long distance, high-voltage
power lines that make up the bulk of California's transmission system.
Approximately 75% of California's electricity is distributed through the
CAISO managed  "power grid".  The CAISO monitors electrical loads (i.e.,
demand) on an on-going basis and ensures that there is an adequate supply of
power to meet that demand.
/ / /
 24. The CAISO accomplishes this by maintaining a Real Time Imbalance
Market (the "Real Time Market").  When the CAISO receives bids from
suppliers that are insufficient to meet the demand for power, it must accept
any bid, which then sets the market-clearing price for that hour. Under the
single price auction system used by the CAISO, all sellers of electricity in
the Real Time Market automatically receive the market clearing price, which
is the (second) highest price paid in the market, even if they were willing
to sell and had in fact bid to sell electricity at lower prices. This
mechanism allows sophisticated market participants, such as defendants, to
game the market by withholding bids in an effort to maximize the clearing
price.
25. The Real Time Market was not designed to handle large transactions,
but merely to provide a mechanism to correct short term imbalances in supply
and demand.  Defendants nonetheless pushed a substantial portion of the
daily wholesale electricity sales into this market by under bidding capacity
to the forward market leaving wholesale customers no alternative place to
obtain the power to satisfy their retail customers' demand.
26. The CAISO also manages the Replacement Reserve Market, which is used
to balance supply and demand of electricity.  Sellers in the Replacement
Reserve Market receive a fixed premium for having available capacity.  If
called upon by the ISO to deliver energy, sellers in the Replacement Reserve
Market also receive the Real Time Market price.  Thus, if generators know
that capacity is short, they have an incentive to withhold supplies from the
spot markets and push as much as possible into the Replacement Reserve
Market.  Access to real time generating information facilitates such
"gaming" of the markets by demonstrating, in real time, available competing
supply.
27. In times of high demand, the CAISO has the authority to purchase
energy from out-of-state sources, as to which there is no operative price
cap.  The CAISO was forced to do so during the Summer of 2000.  California
generators and marketers can export electricity to surrounding markets in
order to create artificial shortages and drive up prices in the California
markets.  They can then resell that electricity to the CAISO at inflated and
uncapped prices.  As the PX Compliance Committee noted in its November 1,
2000 Report ("the PX Compliance Report"):
/ / /
 "During periods of high Out-of-Market purchases, when prices are above the
Real-Time energy price cap, in-state generators have an incentive to export
energy out of California.  Surrounding control areas can effectively park
that energy for resale to the CAISO Out-of-Market calls and return it to the
state."

Id. at p. 44.
28. Notably, the summer of 2000 witnessed an approximately 370% increase
in exports from  the California energy market, despite the very high prices
and short supplies that existed in the State.
  "Market power" is defined by the CAISO as the ability to
significantly influence market prices and cause them to vary from
competitive levels for a material period of time.  Generators and suppliers
(including defendants) can exercise market power by physically or
economically withholding electricity from the market, moving electricity out
of the California markets, and by pricing and bidding their resources in
ways that impede the efficiency of the market.

29. Notably, the California energy market consists of a relatively small
number of firms, some of which control a substantial fraction of the total
generating capacity.  The small number of suppliers facilitates the exercise
of  market power during periods of high demand, even when there is not a
true scarcity of available generating capacity.  In addition, the relatively
inelastic demand for energy further facilitates the exercise of such market
power.
B. Defendants' Improper Acts
30. Prior to May 22, 2000, the CAISO began supplying the Western Systems
Coordinating Council ("WSCC"), an organization consisting of electric
industry participants, including defendants, with real time industry data as
to electricity generating levels, known as metering data, and transmission
system flow data, known as scheduling data, pertaining to individual market
participants. Through the WSCC Internet web site, wholesale electricity
market participants, including defendants herein, were thereby given access
to real time data as to their competitors' actions, although access to such
data was forbidden by the ISO Tariff.  When requested by various
governmental entities, including the California Public Utilities Commission
("CPUC") the WSCC refused access.
/ / /
/ / /
/ / /
 31. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 10.2.6 states in relevant part;
Meter Data supplied by an ISO  metered entity shall be made available by the
ISO to the scheduling coordinator representing such ISO metered entity and
other authorized users identified in its meter services agreement, but shall
not be disclosed to any third party except as otherwise may be required by
law, FERC any local regulatory authority or other provision of this ISO
Tariff.

32. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.1 states in relevant part:

The ISO shall maintain the confidentiality of all of the documents, data and
information provided to it by any Market Participant that are treated as
confidential or commercially sensitive under Section 20.3.2; provided,
however, that the ISO need not keep confidential: (1) information that is
explicitly subject to data exchange through WEnet pursuant to Section 6 of
this ISO Tariff; (2) information that the ISO or the Market Participant
providing the information is required to disclose pursuant to this ISO
Tariff, or applicable regulatory requirements (provided that the ISO shall
comply with any applicable limits on such disclosure); or (3) information
that becomes available to the public on a non-confidential basis (other than
as a result of the ISO's breach of this ISO Tariff).

33. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.2 states in relevant part:

The following information provided to the ISO by Scheduling Coordinators
shall be treated by the ISO as confidential:

(a) individual bids for Supplemental Energy;

(b) individual Adjustment Bids for Congestion Management which are not
designated by the scheduling coordinator as available;

(c) individual bids for Ancillary Services;

(d) transactions between Scheduling Coordinators;

(e) individual Generator Outage programs unless a Generator makes a
change to its Generator Outage program which causes Congestion in the short
term (i.e. one month or less), in which case, the ISO may publish the name
of that Generator.

34. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.2 states in relevant part:

No Market Participant shall have the right hereunder to receive from the ISO
or to review any documents, data or other information of another Market
Participant to the extent such documents, data or information is to be
treated as in accordance with Section 20.3.2; provided, however, a market
Participant may receive and review any composite documents, data, and other
information that may be developed based upon such confidential documents,
data, or information, if the composite document does not disclose such
confidential data or information relating to an individual Market
Participant and provided, however, that the ISO may disclose information as
provided for in its bylaws.

 35. Part of the CAISO Tariff is the ISO Market Monitoring & Information
Protocol (MMIP).  The objective of this Protocol (MMIP) is to set forth the
workplan and rules under which the ISO will monitor the ISO markets to
identify abuses of market power.  The MMIP part of the tariff applies to all
ISO Market Participants, including Defendants.
36. MMIP Section 2.1.1. states in relevant part:
Anomalous market behavior, which is defined as behavior that departs
significantly from the normal behavior in competitive markets that do not
require continuing regulation or as behavior leading to unusual or
unexplained market outcomes.  Evidence of such behavior may be derived from
a number of circumstances, including:

MMIP 2.1.1.1  withholding of generation capacity under circumstances in
which it would normally be offered in a competitive market;

MMIP 2.1.1.2  unexplained or unusual redeclarations of availability by
Generators;

MMIP 2.1.1.3  unusual trades or transactions;

MMIP 2.1.1.4  pricing and bidding patterns that are inconsistent with
prevailing supply and demand conditions, e.g., prices and bids that appear
consistently excessive for or otherwise inconsistent with such conditions;
and

MMIP 2.1.1.5  unusual activity or circumstances relating to imports from or
exports to other markets or exchanges.

The Market Surveillance Unit shall evaluate, on an ongoing basis, whether
the continued or persistent presence of such circumstances indicates the
presence of behavior that is designed to or has the potential to distort the
operation and efficient functioning of a competitive market, e.g., the
strategic withholding and redeclaring of capacity, and whether it indicates
the presence and exercise of market power or of other unacceptable
practices.

37. MMIP Section 2.1.3 states in relevant part:

"Gaming", or taking unfair advantage of the rules and procedures set forth
in the PX or ISO Tariffs, Protocols or Activity Rules, or of transmission
constraints in periods in which exist substantial Congestion, to the
detriment of the efficiency of, and of consumers in, the ISO Markets.
"Gaming" may also include taking undue advantage of other conditions that
may affect the availability of transmission and generation capacity, such as
loop flow, facility outages, level of hydropower output or seasonal limits
on energy imports from out-of-state, or actions or behaviors that may
otherwise render the system and the ISO markets vulnerable to price
manipulation to the detriment of their efficiency.

 38. Market participants used their trade organization, the WSCC, to
share access to and use real time information, notwithstanding the fact that
its publication and use violated the  ISO's operating procedures, as set
forth in tariffs and protocols that were filed with and approved by FERC,
and by adoption made part of the contracts by  which defendants were
authorized to sell electricity to the PX.  Those tariffs and protocols
required that such data be kept confidential to prevent gaming the market
and not be used by market participants to engage in anti-competitive
behavior.
39. It has been reported in the Dow Jones Work. Com Newswire on October
19, 2000, that:
"Electricity generators may have used real-time plant activity reports from
the state's grid operator to their advantage in California's wholesale
electricity market, according to an official with the Western Systems
Coordinating Council.

 * * * * * * *

"At issue is real-time information the California Independent System
Operator provided the Western systems Coordinating Council, a governmental
[sic] organization that monitors electricity reliability in the western
U.S., about power plant activity in the state.

"The real-time information allows market participants . . . to access data
via an internet site that shows how much capacity a plant with more than 200
megawatts has online at any given moment. . . . .

"The information was intended to be used to monitor electric reliability on
the grid . . . .

"Last month, however, the ISO's attorneys alerted the WSCC that the 'data is
being used against them and to game the market,' according to Bill Commish,
director of dispatch with the WSCC.

 * * * * * *

"Commish said generators could use the information to withhold supply and
drive up power prices or to identify transmission congestion in a particular
region and use that to gouge customers.

"However, the ISO, which controls about 75% of the state's power grid and
real-time market, may have violated a FERC rule because it is required to
keep such information confidential for 90 days, an ISO attorney told the
WSCC.

"Beginning Monday, the ISO will no longer provide such information  to the
WSCC or other market participants."

 40. Starting on or about May 22, 2000, Defendants used such real time
data to exercise market power by, among other things, reducing their output,
strategically under-bidding supply to the forward markets, and exporting
electricity from the State in order to drive up the Real Time Market price
and other market prices.  As a direct result of their improper access to and
use of this information, the price of wholesale electricity spiked sharply
upwards on May 22, 2000 and has remained at artificially inflated prices
ever since.  FERC, CPUC, and CAISO Dept. of Market Analysis, have all now
concluded that market participants should be excluded from the CAISO board.
41. As noted in the North County Times on October 19, 2000:
"A case study of San Diego County's two big power plants has concluded that
they held back from full production of electricity in June, even as prices
skyrocketed and California's power manager was scrambling for supplies to
prevent blackouts.

"To the study's author . . . the low production in San Diego county is clear
evidence that the companies that generate and trade electricity in CA were
creating an artificial shortage to drive up prices.

 * * * * * *

McCullough's hour-by-hour analysis of power output for June found that the
Encina plant in Carlsbad generated 44 percent of the megawatt hours that it
could have during periods when prices were higher than the plant's cost of
production.  The South Bay power plant in Chula Vista generated 61 percent
of what would be expected under traditional economic theory.

Economists estimate it costs $45-$55 per megawatt hour to generate
electricity at the plants. The wholesale price in June averaged $120 per
megawatt hour.

A separate analysis conducted by the North County Times revealed "mysterious
cutbacks in Carlsbad during a heady market of sky-high prices."

 * * ** *

"Investigators and market analysts have documented extensive evidence that
electricity traders have waited until prices rose on California's market
this summer before they would commit their power plants to production."

"'We did see evidence of withholding in the bidding,' according to Jim
Detmers, the ISO's operations chief."

 42. In addition, defendants used such real time information about their
competitors to improperly withhold electrical supplies from the forward
markets operated by the PX in order to take advantage of the ISO's need to
balance supply and demand in the spot market and thereby benefit from the
single price auction system by obtaining the highest price paid at any given
period.  In addition, certain defendants sold or parked electricity with
affiliates in other states in order to artificially drive up prices in the
California markets.  They then sold that electricity back into the
California markets at the artificially inflated prices they had created.
These tactics forced buyers in the California wholesale electricity market
to purchase more than 30% of their electricity needs in the inflated Spot
Market, rather than the less than 5% that should be sold in that market. The
Spot Market was solely intended to satisfy last minute fluctuations in the
demand for energy.
C. Results of Defendants' Activities
43. From late May 2000 through the present, defendants' activities have
raised wholesale electricity prices to record levels, well above the rates
that would prevail in a competitive marketplace and disproportionate to the
costs of generating that electricity.  Those prices have resulted in an
approximate tripling of electricity rates in areas served by SDG&E, where
retail rates have been deregulated and represent in large part a pass
through of SDG&E's costs for such power, which it purchases from the
defendant generators and traders through the California Power Exchange.
44. As the Market Surveillance Committee ("MSC") of the CAISO concluded
in its September 6, 2000 Report ("the MSC Report"), during the months of May
and June 2000 revenues from the sale of ISO loads in the California energy
market were 37% and 182%, respectively, above the revenues that would have
been generated under competitive pricing conditions.    MSC Report at p. 2.
The MSC Report unambiguously concluded that market participants exercised a
"significant amount of  market power" in the California energy markets,
beginning as early as October 1999 and increasing dramatically during the
Class Period.  Id. at pp. 4, 15, 17.
45. The average market clearing price in California's wholesale markets
during August of 2000 was $166.24/MWh under moderate load conditions,
compared with $32.31/MWh a year earlier.  While load demand conditions in
California during August 2000 were slightly higher than in August 1999, they
were similar to those during August 1998 when prices were much lower.  Peak
demand in August 2000 was lower than in August of either of the prior two
years, negating representations by industry leaders that excessive demand
caused these price increases.  Indeed, some California electricity producers
were only running at 60% of capacity during the so-called emergency periods.

 46. These price hikes have even been effect during the middle of the
night, when electricity is abundant and demand is low.  Further, prices in
November 2000, when demand for electricity is much lower than during the
summer months, continue to be substantially in excess of the prior years'
levels and in excess of the levels that should prevail in a competitive
marketplace.
47. As a result of defendants' exercise of market power, they
artificially increased prices to record levels and have obtained huge
windfall profits.  As reported in the October 17, 2000 San Diego Union
Tribune,  analyst Anatol Feygin of JP Morgan estimated that electricity
industry profits from California for the 3 months ended September 30, 2000
could reach $6 billion, even after taking into account cost increases.
Feygin stated, "'The industry was literally at eight times the profitability
of last year . . .. that is a fortune.'"
48. Defendant Reliant has reported that its third quarter earnings will
top last year's figure by about $110 million.  Similarly, defendant Dynegy
reported an 83 percent increase in its third quarter 2000 income, as
compared to its third quarter 1999 figures.   Profits from Defendant
Dynegy's wholesale energy generating and trading division quadrupled to
$141.9 million, which represented 80 percent of Dynegy's overall profits.
"This is the most successful quarter in Dynegy's history", reported chairman
and chief executive officer, Charles 'Chuck' Watson.  Other defendants also
obtained large windfall profits during this period.
49. Prior to deregulation, the historical cost to produce a megawatt
hour of electricity in San Diego County was approximately $23-45 per MWh.
During the Summer of 2000, defendants' conduct caused the Real Time Market
price of wholesale electricity to frequently reach $750 per MWh, resulting
in an approximate tripling of SDG&E customers' bills.
50. In its Order issued on November 1, 2000, FERC concluded that
wholesale prices of electricity in California had been at "unjust and
unreasonable" levels during the Summer of 2000. CAISO and CPUC responses to
the November 1st FERC order both concluded that wholesale prices during
Summer 2000 were due to a substantial exercise of market power by generators
and traders.
 51. Plaintiffs and the class were injured by the manipulated and
inflated prices paid for wholesale electricity, including retail customers
of SDG&E since costs were fully passed through to them.  The CPUC's November
22, 2000 report to FERC concluded that the exercise of market power by
wholesale producers resulted in a $4 billion dollar overcharge for the
delivery of electricity to California during the summer of 2000.  Due to the
unlawful conduct alleged above, plaintiffs and the class paid approximately
$4 billion dollars more for electricity than they otherwise would have,
causing great hardship to numerous individuals and businesses. As
Congressman Brian Bilbray stated: "Every day that goes by you've got small
businesses bleeding to death.  People are literally dying financially from
this situation."  Work.com Newswire (10/21/00).
52. The improper sharing and use of real time wholesale electricity
generation and transmission data by defendants to withhold generation by
unplanned outages and to maintain bidding strategies which led to contrived
and artificial shortages, and other manipulative conduct, had the effect of
artificially inflating and maintaining wholesale electricity prices above
competitive prices allowing defendants to reap illegal profits amounting to
billions of dollars, at the expense of plaintiffs and the class.
 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
 Violation of Sections 16720 and 16726
 of the California Business and Professions Code
 Trust In Restraint of Trade or Commerce in Violation of the
Antitrust Act
 (Against All Defendants)

53. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
54. The Cartwright Act states, at o16726, that: "Except as provided in
this chapter, every trust is unlawful, against public policy and void."  A
trust is defined at o16720 as follows:
55. "A trust is a combination of capital, skill or acts by two or more
persons for any of the following purposes:
(a) To create or carry out restrictions in trade or commerce.

(b) To limit or reduce the production, or increase the price of
merchandise or of any commodity.

(c) To prevent competition in manufacturing, making, transportation,
sale or purchase of merchandise, produce or any commodity.

(d) To fix at any standard or figure, whereby its price to the public or
consumer shall be in any manner controlled or established, any article or
commodity of merchandise, produce or commerce intended for sale, barter, use
or consumption in this State.

(e) To make or enter into or execute or carry out any contracts,
obligations, or agreements of any kind or description, by which they do all
or any or any combination of the following:

 (1) Bind themselves not to sell, dispose of or transport any article or
any commodity or any article of trade, use, merchandise, commerce or
consumption below a common standard figure, or fixed value.

(2) Agree in any manner to keep the price of such article, commodity or
transportation at a fixed or graduated figure.

(3) Establish or settle the price of any article, commodity or
transportation between them or themselves and others, so as directly or
indirectly to preclude a free and unrestricted competition among themselves,
or any purchasers or consumers in the sale or transportation of any such
article or commodity.

(4) Agree to pool, combine or directly or indirectly unite any interests
that they may have connected with the sale or transportation of any such
article or commodity, that its price might in any manner be affected."

56. Plaintiffs and the Class are empowered by the Cartwright Act o16750
to commence a private action for up to three times their damages and
equitable relief due to the injuries they have suffered and continue to
suffer as a result of defendants' violations of the Antitrust Act.  The
Cartwright Act states:
Any person who is injured in his or her business or property by reason of
anything forbidden or declared unlawful by this chapter, may sue therefore
. . . and to recover three times the damages sustained by him or her,
interest . . . and preliminary or permanent injunctive relief . . . .

57. Plaintiffs and the Class, are "persons" within the meaning of the
Antitrust Act as defined in o16702.
58. Beginning on or about May 22, 2000, the exact date being presently
unknown to Plaintiffs, Defendants embarked on a conspiracy to make available
and use confidential real time industry data as to electrical generating,
power plant capacity, utilization, and outages through the WSCC, an
organization consisting of Defendants, and others, to inflate the market
prices of wholesale electricity, in restraint of trade and commerce in
California. As a result of these efforts, Defendants engaged in acts and
entered into Agreements, which  were intended to and have in fact restrained
trade and commerce in the California Power Exchange and other electricity
markets, in violation of the Antitrust Act, which violations are continuing
to the present day.
 59. The aforesaid acts, contracts, agreements, combinations and
conspiracies in restraint of trade or commerce have consisted of continuing
agreements, undertakings and concert of action among Defendants, the
substantial terms of which were to artificially limit the supply of
electricity to the California markets.  Through these acts and Agreements,
Defendants acted to set, raise and maintain the prices of electricity on the
Real Time Imbalance Market and other markets to wholesale purchasers of
electricity, and, indirectly and ultimately, to California consumers, at
supra-competitive prices.
60. Defendants successfully set, raised and maintained supra-competitive
wholesale prices for electricity beginning on May 22, 2000, to the customers
of the California Power Exchange.
61. Such overcharges were paid by consumers of electricity, such as
Plaintiff and the Class she seeks to represent.
62. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, combinations and
conspiracies were intended to restrain and did, in fact, restrain trade and
commerce in California during the Class Period.
63. Defendants' unlawful restraints of trade have had and, unless
enjoined, threaten to continue to have the following anti-competitive
effects, among others:
(a) Prices charged by Defendants for electricity to wholesale
purchasers, and, ultimately, to the customers of SDG&E in California have
been and will continue to be set, raised and maintained at artificially high
and non-competitive levels;

(b) Fair and equitable price competition for the supply of electricity
and retail and wholesale price levels for electricity have been restrained
and adversely affected; and

(c) Plaintiff and other Class members have been deprived of the benefit
of free and open competition in the electricity market in California.

64. As a direct and proximate result of the violations alleged herein,
Plaintiff and members of the Class have been unable to and will continue to
be unable to purchase electricity at prices determined by free and open
competition, and Plaintiff and members of the Class have been damaged and
will continue to be damaged by their respective purchases and/or charges for
electricity at prices higher than they would have otherwise paid, absent
Defendants' unlawful conduct.
65. Plaintiff and the Class have no adequate remedy at law for their
irreparable injuries.
66. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, conspiracies, and
combinations in restraint of trade violate the Antitrust Act.  Accordingly,
Plaintiff and the Class seek three times their damages caused by Defendants'
violations of the Antitrust Act and a permanent injunction enjoining
Defendants' continuing violations of the Cartwright Act.
/ / /
 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
For Violations of the Unfair Trade Practices Act
Based Upon Violations of the Antitrust Act
(against all defendants)

67. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
68. The Unfair Trade Practices Act prohibits all unfair competition,
which is defined as "any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or
practice," and includes violations of the Cartwright Act,  oo16700 et seq.
of the B&P Code.
69. As alleged hereinabove, beginning as early as May, 2000, defendants
unlawfully conspired, agreed, arranged and combined to prevent and restrain
competition for the sale of electricity, in violation of oo 16700 et seq.
and oo 17200 et seq. of the B&P Code.
70. Pursuant to B&P Code oo 17200 et seq., Plaintiff brings this action
seeking injunctive relief to enjoin defendants' unfair trade practices and
requiring defendants' disgorgement of all monies obtained by virtue of their
violations of the Cartwright Act as described hereinabove.
71. As a direct and proximate result of the violations alleged herein,
Plaintiff and members of the Class have been unable to and will continue to
be unable to purchase electricity at prices determined by free and open
competition, and Plaintiff and members of the Class have been damaged and
will continue to be damaged by their respective purchases and/or charges for
electricity at prices higher than they would have otherwise paid, absent
defendants' unlawful conduct.
72. Plaintiff and the Class have no adequate remedy at law for their
irreparable injuries.
73. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, conspiracies, and
combinations in restraint of trade and free and open competition, alleged
herein, violate the Antitrust Act.  Accordingly, Plaintiff and the Class
seek restitution and disgorgement by defendants to the Class of all monies
obtained by defendants' acts of unfair competition with respect to the
contract, conspiracy, combination and trust, and a permanent injunction
enjoining defendants' continuing violations of the Cartwright Act.
/ / /
/ / /
 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
For Violations of the Unfair Trade Practices Act
Based Upon Defendants' Unfair Business Acts and Practices
In Charging Unjust and Unreasonable Rates
(against all defendants)

74. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
75. Section 17200 et seq. of the California Business & Professions Code
prohibits acts of unfair competition, which include any "unlawful, unfair,
or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or
misleading advertising".
76. The Defendants consistently engaged in numerous acts of  "unfair
competition", as more fully described above, by inter alia, manipulating the
price of wholesale electricity in the California markets.
77. In addition, pursuant to the Federal Power Act:
"All rates and charges made, demanded, or received by any public utility for
or in connection with the transmission or sale of electric energy subject to
the jurisdiction of the Commission . . . shall be just and reasonable and
any such rate or charge that is not just and reasonable is hereby declared
to be unlawful."

16 U.S.C. Section 824d(a).

78. Defendants are public utilities within the term as used in the
foregoing statute.
79. The FERC has specifically found that the prices defendants charged
for the wholesale electricity they sold in the California markets during the
Class Period were in fact unjust and unreasonable.  The California Public
Utilities Commission has determined that said unjust and unreasonable prices
resulted from the exercise of market power by generators and traders in the
California wholesale electricity market.
80. As a result of the conduct described above, the  defendants
unlawfully acquired money and property from Plaintiff and the Class and have
been and will be unjustly enriched at the expense of Plaintiff and the
members of the Class.  Specifically, defendants have deprived Plaintiff and
the Class of billions of dollars in monies from the sale of electricity at
unjust, excessive, and manipulated prices.
/ / /
 81. Pursuant to Section 17203 of the California Business & Professions
Code, Plaintiff and the members of the class seek an order of this Court
restoring to them all money wrongfully taken from them and allowing them a
claim in the full amount of all of defendants' ill-gotten gains, so as to
restore any and all monies to Plaintiff and the members of the Class and the
general public, which were acquired and obtained by means of such unfair and
deceptive acts and practices.
82. Pursuant to Section 17203 of the California Business & Professions
Code, Plaintiff and the members of the class seek an order of this Court
providing appropriate equitable and/or injunctive relief restraining
defendants from charging unjust and unreasonable rates and from manipulating
the electricity markets.
 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION
 Violations of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act
 (Against All Defendants)

83. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
84. Such acts and practices by defendants violate the Consumer Legal
Remedies Act, Civil Code Section 1750, et seq.  Defendants' acts warrant
appropriate injunctive and declaratory relief, including an injunction
restraining them from charging unjust and unfair rates or manipulating the
market for electricity.
FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION
Unconscionability
(Against All Defendants)

85. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
86. Defendants charged rates for wholesale electricity that were
unconscionable given their cost of production, the newly emergent markets
for that product, and the consumers' need for electrical power.
87. Defendants' rates were  inherently  excessive, invalid and
unconscionable, particularly in light of the deceptive and manipulative
practices they used to inflate the market prices and the vital need
consumers and businesses have for electrical power.
/ / /
 88. Defendants' unconscionable prices were passed through to Plaintiff
and the majority of the Class in the retail electricity rates charged by
SDG&E and thereby directly damaged Plaintiff and the Class.
 VI.
 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff and the Class pray for judgment against defendants as
follows:
(a) That the Court determine that this action may be maintained as a
class action and direct that reasonable  notice of this action be given to
the members of the Class;
(b) That the combination, contract, arrangement, agreement, conspiracy
and trust alleged herein be adjudged and decreed to be an unreasonable
restraint of trade in violation of Sections 16720 and 16726 of the
California Business and Professions Code;
(c) That damages be granted according to proof, and that Plaintiff and
the Class be awarded treble damages or statutory damages, where applicable,
attorneys' fees, costs and disbursements;
(d) That Plaintiff and the Class be awarded pre- and post-judgment
interest;
(e) That the Court enter appropriate injunctive and other equitable
relief, including the disgorgement of defendants' unlawful profits; and
(f) That Plaintiff and the Class have such other and further relief as
the Court may deem just and proper under the circumstances.

I wrote the "New Business Idea" email in HTML and apparently the formatting
was lost when it was sent to most of you...making it impossible to read.  I
have saved it in a PDF format along with an article I found funny
(referenced in the email message).

After you read the message, you may think that I've lost my mind.  I am
accepting investors, though.

Dave may have misspoke at the meeting or I misheard. Anyhow, my research 
suggests there is no overriding support for change, a few yes a few no, but 
mostly apathy. I will probably sum up for group tomorrow based on all 
responses I received and recommend we leave as is.

I don't think "services" was discussed.  The agreement was to call the group 
"professional".

Subject: Proposal to Change "Commercial Support" peer group label to 
"Professional Services"

At the VP PRC meeting last Wednesday, Dave Delainey proposed we consider 
retitling the Commercial Support peer group as above. Apparently this 
suggestion was made and broadly supported at a policy committee meeting a few 
weeks ago. The suggestion is that the Support label is seen rather negatively 
across the organisation and the new label may be an improvement.

The VP PRC Committee resolved that they would be open to supporting a change, 
subject to the senior leads from across CS providing their views/support.

I volunteered to circulate this note to the 2 of you in EWS and ask my 
colleagues from HR to share with their CS leads to solicit their views before 
returning to the committee late next week with summarised reaction. Perhaps 
you would provide me with your views and a vote for or against? 

I would strongly recommend that we do broadly discuss this outside a small 
circle of people.

David

Steve, what office would you recommend to accommodate this request?  Is 
Sutton's office an option?  I think it's fairly empty.  SRS

Hi Sherri,
    Beth asked me to see if you might help us with locating space on the 50th
floor from January 2nd - January 25th. As we did last January, we would like
to setup editing equipment at the Enron building for putting together the
Analyst Meeting tapes.
    I know that the office we used in January is now occupied, but Beth
wondered if either Joe Suttons former office or Rob Wahl's old office might
be available.  Locating the editing equipment in the building makes it easier
for those Enron folks involved in the process to stay close to the process.
    If you are able to help us with this, it would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Richard Yeats

Juiced

By Julia King and Gary H. Anthes
(Nov. 20, 2000) Wall Street analysts and oil industry executives were thick 
among the legion of skeptics who thought Enron Corp. President and Chief 
Operating Officer Jeff Skilling was nuts to launch a Web site for the trading 
of natural gas and electricity over the Internet. 
That was last November, before EnronOnline locked up more than $120 billion 
in transactions in its first few months of operation, quickly establishing 
itself as the world's largest e-commerce company. As of Oct. 11, just prior 
to Enron's report of its third-quarter earnings, EnronOnline had executed 
more than 350,000 transactions, representing a gross value of $183 billion. 
Since then, the $40 billion Houston-based energy giant has elbowed its way 
into several new diversified markets. And it plans to continue its push into 
many more, ranging from railcar cargo space to broadband networking and 
data-storage capacity. 
In doing so, Enron is turbocharging its transformation from a stodgy, 
old-line fuel company to an entirely new kind of business-to-business market 
maker, with information technology and an all-out emphasis on 
entrepreneurship at the heart of its New Economy operations. Enron has been 
so successful in leveraging IT to pioneer new markets that others are trying 
to emulate its approach. 







First to Market 
"Enron often introduces a product before the competition even senses a market 
exists," the company says in its latest annual report. A prime example: 
online trading of data-network capacity. 
Indeed, "there's a low degree of awareness [among carriers] about the 
bandwidth-trading business," and Enron is ahead of the game, says Seth Libby, 
an analyst at The Yankee Group in Boston. 
At present, there are only a handful of network professionals who are aware 
of these capacity commoditization plans, says Libby. But not for long, 
asserts Enron President?? Jeff Skilling. "Within five years, the bandwidth 
market may be bigger than the gas and electric markets," he says. "So for us, 
it could be as big as the rest of our existing energy business." That's 
currently a $35 billion business. 
But critics say trading bandwidth is much more complicated than trading gas, 
especially for a company with little depth in telecommunications. And critics 
add that although carriers stand to benefit from the ability to buy and sell 
capacity, they might prefer to do it through some channel that's independent 
of the control of a single market maker like Enron. 
"Enron's argument is that its trading capabilities are the differentiator, 
and that it need not have deep telecom expertise," says Lisa Pierce, an 
analyst at Giga Information Group in Stamford, Conn. "But I'm not convinced 
it's that simple. Technology isn't a long-term competitive differentiator." 
Houston-based Enron Broadband Services Inc., formed last year, offers IP 
transport on its 15,000-mile fiber-optic network. Enron Broadband Services 
also trades - that is, makes a market by buying and selling - network 
capacity to and from other data carriers, conducting some of the transactions 
on EnronOnline. 
Enron Broadband Services also offers content-oriented services, such as a 
video-on-demand service it will market with Dallas-based Blockbuster Inc. to 
home viewers starting next month. 
"When we started the gas business, they told us we were nuts," Skilling says. 
"They said, 'You're going to sell gas but not own production? How does that 
work?' Then we did electricity and they said we were nuts again, and even 
louder than before. They said this stuff moves at the speed of light; you can 
never create a market. Then in telecommunications, they said we were nuts 
again." 
Despite its share of skeptics, some experts like Enron's prospects in this 
space. "I think aspects of this have the potential to be very big," says 
Libby. "The carriers like the idea of instantaneous provisioning. And I think 
it has a lot of potential [for] . . . selling it to businesses and giving 
them the ability to cut their costs significantly by buying it as they need 
it." 





"We aspire to that kind of model," says Fred Buehler, director of electronic 
business at Eastman Chemical Co. in Kingsport, Tenn. 
"In every sector, there will be one or two innovators who get out front and 
do things differently to create shareholder value," Buehler says. "We're 
trying to be one of them." 
Market Maker 
Stroll through the gas-trading section on the 32nd floor of Enron's 
glistening 50-story headquarters, and the company's technological 
sophistication is immediately evident. Traders like 26-year-old John Arnold, 
who personally executes about $1 billion per day in trades, have real-time 
access to virtually any information that might affect their split-second 
buy-and-sell decisions. 
That information might be a meteorologist's prediction of a 
colder-than-normal winter across the Plains states or a live news report of 
political instability in an oil-producing country in the Middle East. 
Behind the scenes, all of Arnold's trades are instantly analyzed and 
processed by a sophisticated, proprietary risk-management system and then 
updated across multiple back-end computer systems worldwide. Less than a year 
after launching the operation, 60% of the world's gas is traded on 
EnronOnline. 
"What we are doing, no one in the industry did 10 years ago. Eighty percent 
of our income this year is from businesses that didn't exist 10 years ago," 
says Skilling. 
For example, EnronOnline contributed heavily to its parent company's 
third-quarter earnings, which were up 31% to $292 million, compared with the 
same period last year. 
"The change is technology-driven," Skilling adds. "We couldn't do what we do 
without massive amounts of computing capability." In this regard, Enron joins 
a short list of companies that includes Wal-Mart Stores Inc., FedEx Corp. and 
American Airlines Inc., which famously pioneered various mission-critical IT 
techniques to leapfrog competitors and create a whole new class of IT-enabled 
industry leaders. 
Among Enron's boldest ideas is its use of a single, powerful software-based 
trading platform to insert itself as a principal buyer or seller in hundreds 
of different markets. Currently, Enron trades more than 1,000 different 
commodities, such as gold, natural gas and metals, on EnronOnline. 
"The core of our business is our business model, which is a centralized 
risk-management and market-making business model. It just so happens that the 
Internet is just perfect for improving the efficiency of that model," 
Skilling says. 
But as a market maker, EnronOnline stands alone. For starters, unlike most 
other Internet marketplaces, it's free. There are no transaction fees or 
catalog, inventory or subscription costs for users. 
"Enron has broken away from the pack in the last year, in terms of their 
capital growth," says Ian Wylie, vice president of e-business at BP Amoco PLC 
in London. "And e-business is responsible for a lot of this change." 
Even more unusual is Enron's role as a principal in each transaction. That 
means Enron is either the buyer or seller in every trade in which it's 
involved, unlike market makers that simply act as matchmakers between buyers 
and sellers. 
In fact, Skilling, as well as Mike McConnell, who heads EnronOnline's global 
expansion efforts as president and CEO of Enron Global Markets LLC, dismisses 
much of the current hyperactivity surrounding other fee-based 
business-to-business exchanges as a flash in the pan. 
"[Many of the] B2B guys think all you have to do is set up a bulletin board 
and people will start transacting, but it doesn't work that way," Skilling 
says. "You need to know you can deliver if push comes to shove." 
As either the seller or buyer in all of its trades, Enron, an established 
brand name with 32,000 miles of pipeline and deep financial pockets, 
guarantees delivery or payment on all trades that are executed on 
EnronOnline. 
"We're creating markets that were highly illiquid, so someone has to put 
their reputation on the line to say, 'We'll deliver,' " Skilling says. 
But guaranteeing delivery also requires having guaranteed access to physical 
assets such as network bandwidth and papermaking plants. Guaranteed access 
also ensures marketplace liquidity. For Enron, this is where the bricks and 
mortar come in. 
For example, to help drive its liquidity in the pulp and paper market, Enron 
paid $72 million in July for Garden State Paper Co., a recycled-newsprint 
mill in Garfield, N.J. 
Skilling's current market fancy is metals, and in May, Enron bought MG PLC, a 
London-based metals marketer. "You have to break the liquidity logjam, and to 
do that, you have to take a risk position," Skilling says. 
But once the logjam is cleared, Enron is just as likely to sell off the 
brick-and-mortar assets it acquired and use the cash to invest in new 
business. 
For example, to finance its new bandwidth-trading operation, Enron is selling 
Portland General Electric Co., a Portland, Ore.-based power producer that it 
bought in 1997, so it could bring liquidity to and guarantee trades in the 
online electricity market. 
Eventually, Enron may end up trading commodities that aren't even considered 
commodities - at least not at the moment - such as data storage capacity or 
empty railcar space. 
"Might we move into sauces or meats or grains? Potentially," says McConnell, 
who was Enron's de facto CIO before moving into his current role. 
"You have to be creative every day," McConnell says. "You have to be 
open-minded to trying new things." 
But what remains constant throughout all the upsizing and downsizing is 
Enron's core IT-enabled business model, which is what puts it in a class of 
its own, analysts say. 
"People have talked a lot about systems that they're about to roll out, but 
there is just not much out there for direct trading," says Mike Heim, an 
energy analyst at A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis. "Enron rolled out 
its technology 10 months ago, and still there isn't much else out there. 
There hasn't been much competition [because] there isn't anybody in the same 
class." 
But just last month, Houston-based Dynegy Inc. launched Dynegydirect, an 
Internet-based, commission-free trading site for energy and communications 
commodities. 
Also last month, IntercontinentalExchange in Atlanta, whose partners include 
BP Amoco and The Hague-based Royal Dutch/Shell Group, added natural gas and 
power to its online trading system, which already included precious metals 
and crude oil. 
Skilling doesn't get called "nuts" much anymore. In fact, he's a darling on 
Wall Street, where Enron's stock has soared from around $40 per share last 
November to $81 as of this Nov. 2. As a result, Enron - by all accounts, an 
Old Economy gas pipeline company until 12 months ago - is widely regarded as 
a New Economy pioneer. 
Says Skilling, "We like to say we were B2B before there was B2B." 

Thriving On the Unconventional 
As head of two Enron pipeline subsidiaries, Mike McConnell knew a lot more 
about gas flows than he did about data flows last year when he got a surprise 
call from Enron President and Chief Operating Officer Jeff Skilling. 
Recalls McConnell, "Jeff went into this whole thought process about how the 
Internet is changing everything. He said, 'We need to make Enron an 
e-business, and I need a guy that can run this as a business. We need to 
change the way we view technology.' 
"I thought he was a little crazy and I said, 'Jeff, I'm not a technology 
person at all,' He said, 'No, seriously - this is going to be big.' So I took 
over as CEO of Enron Global Technology," and thus became the company's de 
facto CIO, McConnell explains. 
Appointing a person with no technology background to the top IT post is an 
unusual move. But Enron often defies convention and typically thrives as a 
result. Indeed, Enron boasts an entrepreneurial culture that's unusual in 
large, long-established companies, and in utilities firms in particular. 
McConnell relates the tale of how 29-year-old Louise Kitchen, Enron's head 
gas trader in Europe, spearheaded the creation of an online gas-trading 
system, recruiting IT people from elsewhere in the company to do the 
development work. Word of the Web-based platform, EnronOnline, which is 
literally remaking the company, didn't reach top management until a few weeks 
before it went live. 
Kitchen enlisted the support of Enron's initially skeptical top traders, and 
she scoured the company for software developers and other experts. Her small 
army of volunteers worked nights and weekends on the project while carrying 
on with their regular jobs. 
"It's an amazing story about not getting corporate approval and going through 
all the bureaucracy," McConnell says. "No one went to the board and said, 'We 
want to change the way we trade.' You just do it." 
Glowing Endorsement 
Soon after McConnell became the de facto CIO of the $40 billion energy 
company, he joined eight of Sun Microsystems Inc.'s top Houston customers at 
a breakfast hosted by Sun CEO Scott McNealy. 
"I was very nervous," recalls McConnell, 40. "I mean, McNealy is the guy, and 
here I know nothing about technology. I'd been on the job maybe two weeks." 
McNealy asked the attendees - all but McConnell were middle-aged CIOs with 
many years of IT experience - to introduce themselves in turn. 
"When Scott came to me, I said, 'I'm the CEO of Global Technology, and we 
want to be the leader in B2B commerce in the world.' He kind of sat back and 
said, 'How long have you been in the IT business?' " McConnell explains. " 
'About nine days,' I said, 'and we are going to take a little bit different 
approach to technology.' Scott chuckled and said, 'That sounds like Enron; it 
always looks at things differently.' He then stated that my CEO title and 
Enron's approach were very unusual but that it would be more commonplace 
soon, as this was the way of the future." 
McConnell says McNealy's endorsement had "a huge impact" on how he structured 
IT at Enron during the following year. 
"I realized that we weren't too late to change our approach and take a 
commercial view of technology," he says - a view of IT as an integral part of 
the business, not as something that supports business functions. "None of the 
other companies were thinking our new way at all." 
Taking a commercial view of IT has led to a blurring of the line that 
traditionally separates IT organizations from the business units they 
support. When McConnell became CEO of Global Technology, Enron had five CIOs 
who were predominantly operating independently inside the company's major 
lines of business. 
"Each CIO had his own agenda, his own thought process, his own goals, and 
they did not communicate at all," he says. 
McConnell established corporate standards for IT, created a management team 
that included the five CIOs and put all IT people under a new chief 
technology officer, Philippe Bibi. 
But IT is far from centralized at Enron. "We wanted to make people think 
about technology not as IT and support, but as an extension of your 
business," he explains. "So we seeded people out into the business units. 
[IT] directs the performance review process, but the business units have the 
greatest influence on where the person actually ranks and is rated." 
Firms like Enron that merge IT departments with the business units they serve 
will be the winners among fast-paced e-businesses, says IT organization 
expert Robert Zawacki, president of Zawacki and Associates in Colorado 
Springs and a professor emeritus at the University of Colorado, also in 
Colorado Springs. "We need more entrepreneurial leaders in IT, and 
[McConnell] is certainly one," he says. 
IT makes it easier to be entrepreneurial, says McConnell, who is now 
president and CEO of Enron Global Markets. "We really do like to try things 
and see what happens, and when you have an electronic platform like 
[EnronOnline] that we can model into different sectors, it's very inexpensive 
to try it. We are not afraid; if it's not working, we'll just stop." - Gary

Energy Costs Rocket, Handling Consumers Biggest Shock Yet
San Diego Union-Tribune, 12/12/00

Colombia's Medellin Utility Appeals Isagen Ruling, Paper Says
Bloomberg, 12/12/00



Energy costs rocket, handing consumers biggest shock yet 



By Craig D. Rose 
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER 
December 12, 2000 
Power prices in California keep hitting new heights, with prices in the 
state's main electricity market rising today to nearly $900 per megawatt 
hour. 
The rise continues a stunning ascent from a price of about $50 per megawatt 
hour as recently as last spring. In retail terms, today's prices -- if 
sustained for a month -- would result in an average residential power bill of 
more than $450. 
San Diego ratepayers are temporarily shielded from such high bills by a 
rate-deferral plan in effect at least until 2002. 






The latest prices represent a more than tripling in posted prices on the 
California Power Exchange since Friday, when the operator of the state power 
grid removed a state-mandated price cap of $250. 
The latest escalation -- which comes despite improvements yesterday in state 
power supplies -- is deepening the sense of crisis among state officials, 
consumer advocates and utility companies. 
Nonetheless, a spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, who met yesterday with top 
energy advisers in Los Angeles, said it was unlikely there would be action to 
address the crisis at the state level until after federal regulators release 
their plan for California. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is scheduled to issue a final order 
regarding California's market at its meeting tomorrow. But yesterday the 
commission made plans for a second meeting Friday to deal with the state's 
problems, and did not clarify at which session it would issue the California 
order. 
Davis and others in the state have been critical of FERC's refusal to halt 
what they describe as a devastating rise in power prices here or to order 
refunds for payments made by consumers over the past summer. 
The governor also has been severely critical of the California Independent 
System Operator's decision to lift the state price cap last week. The ISO 
manages most of the state's power supply. 
Privately, most at the state level remain skeptical that federal action will 
ease the crisis, saying it will be up to California to fix the problem. Last 
Friday, FERC quickly approved the ISO's plan to end the price cap. 
Increasingly, state officials and consumer activists are talking about 
state-owned power systems, utility takeovers and a likely initiative seeking 
to overturn deregulation. SDG&E and others also emphasize the need for a 
price cap for the Western region of the United States, in order to prevent 
suppliers from migrating to the highest prices and driving prices upward 
everywhere. 
The new highs in electricity prices came even as the ISO said the state's 
supplies had improved, with the start-up of production from a formerly closed 
nuclear power plant unit. 
The apparent contradiction between the increase in available power and the 
continued price escalation was blamed on a number of factors: 
High prices for natural gas -- which fuels power plants -- continued to drive 
up the cost of generating electricity. Cold conditions in the Midwest helped 
push natural gas prices to record highs yesterday. 
Allegations also persist that energy companies have manipulated the market. 
Consumers Union and other advocacy groups say deregulating electricity prices 
has proven to be a costly error for California consumers. 
At the same time, the controversial removal of price caps in California is 
allowing prices to rise to levels approaching those in other Western states. 
"We've now had three days of the Hebert experiment," said state Sen. Steve 
Peace, D-El Cajon. Peace was referring to Curt Hebert, a FERC commissioner 
who opposes price caps for wholesale electricity. 
Peace, who played a prime role in California's deregulation legislation, 
likened the run-up in electricity prices to the oil embargo of the 1970s and 
warned that it could devastate the economy. 
"Someone from (former Gov. Pete) Wilson's administration told me, 'Somebody 
in the energy business decided it's time for a depression,'?" said Peace, who 
has also been critical of FERC's failure to rein in prices. "This is not 
about electricity. It's about the economy." 
In a letter to FERC yesterday, Peace repeated earlier calls for a federal 
order returning the state to regulated power prices based on the cost of 
production. 
Market watchers said little could help the state over the next few days, 
except Mother Nature. 
"The prices will remain at these levels, unless you get a warming trend," 
said Alex Galatic of Strategic Energy, a Pittsburgh-based energy company with 
offices in Carlsbad. 
Market speculators appear to be betting against a break in price any time 
soon. For example, electricity is selling for $800 per megawatt hour in the 
Pacific Northwest for delivery in January, Galatic said. 
"I see no break in the pricing," agreed Arthur O'Donnell, editor of 
California Energy Markets,? a publication based in San Francisco. 
A spokesman for Enron Corp., the largest electricity trader in the United 
States, said the raising of prices in California had improved supplies 
available to the state. And he added that there was another positive aspect 
to the higher commodity prices. 
"You are starting to see some demand response," said Mark Palmer, the Enron 
spokesman, referring to cutbacks in power use as prices soar. "Some companies 
are shutting down because it makes more sense to sell their gas (rather than 
using it as fuel to continue their manufacturing operations)." 
That's not an option for the state's utility companies, which continue to 
report growing losses from buying electricity at higher costs than they can 
collect from their customers. They have covered the shortfall by borrowing 
money. 
Dow Jones Newswires reported that Pacific Gas & Electric was only "weeks" 
away from being unable to cover its power costs if prices continue at recent 
levels. 
A spokesman for the Bay Area utility's parent company declined to comment 
directly on the report. 
"It's up to the decision of creditors to make that call," said Greg Pruett, 
vice president of communications for PG&E. "We have already borrowed $2.6 
billion to cover undercollections that have totaled $4.6 billion. 
"It can't continue forever." 

Colombia's Medellin Utility Appeals Isagen Ruling, Paper Says
12/12/0 9:14 (New York)


     Bogota, Dec. 12 (Bloomberg) -- Colombia's largest municipal
utility, Empresas Publicas de Medellin, said it will appeal a high
court decision barring it from buying a majority stake in state-
run generator Isagen, the daily El Espectador reported.
     EPM general manager Ramiro Valencia said government plans to
sell its 76 percent stake in Isagen could not go ahead until the
appeal and other lawsuits filed by EPM are resolved, the report
said. Colombia in September suspended the Isagen sale, which it
hoped would raise $340 million, pending a Council of State ruling
on an EPM suit filed alleging bias in the sales process.
     The Council of State, which oversees state agencies, ruled
Friday that the energy regulator was in its rights when it ruled
earlier this year against any single company taking a majority
stake in Isagen to avoid market dominance.
     EPM is planning to purchase the government's 76 percent stake
in Isagen together with Enron Corp. of the U.S. to avoid the anti-
monopoly regulations.

Paul:  Here's additional info for the "curtailment" data that we're pulling 
together.

Utility Pricing for Core Gas Customers

Prior to the month in question, the utility forecasts gas prices based on 
NYMEX monthly prices.  So for example, based on November's forecast, the 
utility sets prices to be charged to core consumers in December.

When December's over, the utility compares forecast prices with actual 
prices.  If the forecast was too low, and there's an undercollection, the 
utility will increase January's price forecast by "just enough" to make up 
for the December undercollection.  If prices were too high and there's an 
overcollection, the utility will reduce January price forecast by just enough 
to refund the overcollection.

If the overcollection/undercollection is very large, the utilities have 
generally spread out the "true-up" over several months to avoid "rate shock" 
one way or the other.  However, under the current circumstances, the 
utilities may be less willing to spread it out, and may wish to recover the 
entire undercollection in the following month.  In short, there's at least a 
one-month lag in customer prices to account for differences in forecasts 
versus actual.

Rick:

This is very good, and succinct, summary from Ban.  Notwithstanding his 
analysis, I think that we are going to be there for a longer-than-desired 
period, and Dr. Ley's visit should have been kept for a more opportune time.  
Of course, I hope that I am wrong.

It follows that the likely way out shall be "renegotiation", "stabilizing", 
then convergence with the arbitration route in "existing".  


Best regards

Amr,

There have been differing perceptions about Dr. Lay's visit. Some including 
myself thought that it was a wasted effort, esp. so because just the day 
after he left, the Government of Maharashtra called for a judicial probe 
against Enron. The terms of reference of the probe are to be announced within 
a month. A judicial probe is not only a bad way to respond to our efforts but 
is also bound to postpone any fruitful negotiations. Its a bad signal esp. 
for investors like us. It shows poorly about how the Indian polity works and 
how misplaced their priorities are, esp. on crucial infrastructure related 
issues.

Some of us were beginning to think that Dr. Lay's visit is bound to enthuse 
the Central Government to act more positively and come with more likely 
solutions, including a possible buyout. However, with a judicial probe being 
announced even the Central Government is forced to re-think its strategy 
twice before stepping in. Infact, it might be forced to take a back seat.

Internal discussion reveal that it was perhaps necessary for Dr. Lay to visit 
senior officials just to send a signal that "Enron had tried its utmost to 
thrash out a solution". If necessary another visit would be planned, just to 
reiterate this. This they  feel would help in the long run, esp. when we 
arbitrate, to drive home the message that we did use all our options to 
arrive at a solution, unlike the government which just was not forthcoming. 
What folks here also feel is that the "Chairman of the Company should 
definitely come to check the boxes". 

So perhaps strategically it might appear that the latter school of thought is 
the right option but pragmatically sell out seems the only option left now. 
The sooner the better. However, the way the judicial system works here, one 
can only hope the Supreme Court respects our notice for arbitration in London 
and  helps hasten the process. 

Ban

WSJ.COM WRAP: Skilling To Become Enron's Next CEO >ENE
12/13/0 13:18 (New York)



   A WSJ.com News Roundup

  HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--Enron Corp. (ENE) on Wednesday named  Jeffrey K.
Skilling chief executive to replace Kenneth L. Lay, who said he will step down
but continue to serve as chairman of the utility and telecommunications
company.
  Skilling, 47 years old, will take on the new role on Feb.  12, the company's
next scheduled board meeting, while remaining president and chief operating
officer.
  "Jeff is a big part of Enron's success and is clearly ready to lead the
company," Lay, 58, said in a written statement. Lay became chairman and chief
executive in 1986.
  Lay also denied rumors that he was interested in becoming  U.S. secretary of
energy or Treasury secretary in George W. Bush's administration, should the
Texas governor become the next president. Enron and Lay were big contributors
to the Bush campaign.
  "I have no plans to go to Washington and no plans to leave Houston or 
Enron,"
he said. "I can say categorically that I won't be taking a job in a Bush
cabinet."
  "I am particularly happy that Ken and I will continue running the company
together and that he has put the rumors of his possible departure to
Washington, D.C., to rest," Skilling said. "Ken and I have worked together
since 1990, and we don't want to break up a team that has delivered superior
returns to Enron's shareholders."
  Skilling is credited as generating substantial profits for Enron and being
the brains behind the company's burgeoning commodities-trading business. That
business was seeking to place the company at the top of markets ranging from
electricity to wood pulp to natural gas.
  Enron, which began as a traditional gas-pipeline company 15 years ago, has
transformed itself into the largest trader of gas and electricity in North
America.
  Skilling joined Enron in 1990 after leading McKinsey & Co.'s energy and
chemical consulting operations. He became Enron's president and operating 
chief
in December 1996. He emerged as the heir apparent to Lay after Rebecca Mark
resigned in August as chief executive of Azurix Corp. (AZX), Enron's troubled
global water company. Deregulation of the water business and government
privatizations of water systems, on which Azurix was counting, were slow to
come, crimping growth opportunities and profit.

Premise: FERC should investigate the utility decisionmaking that led the 
Califonia market to the point of excess gas demand, rather than rush to 
impose gas price caps.

Utilities had ample opportunity to fill up storage last summer, but most 
likely choose not to for price reasons.

Transwestern had at least a 100 M/D of available capacity to Califonia and to 
the SoCal Needles delivery point through July 2000.  
 
 Avg. Scheduled (compared to 1.1 Bcf/D capacity): April  780 
        May  820
        Jun-Jul  980
        Aug  1050
        Oct-Dec 1080 (essentially full)

During the period April-Jul, TW was able to deliver up to the full 750 M/D at 
Needles, but on many days SoCal gas instituted "windowing," lowering the 
ability to take at Needles to 680-720 M/D.  SoCal's argument was that they 
didn't believe that there was sufficient demand to run at the 750 M/D level 
(even when TW had nominations of 750 M/D).

El Paso was also not full to Califonia until the last month.   At all times 
El Paso  had available capacity at PG&E delivery points.  During the pipeline 
outage El Paso was limited in their ability to fully deliver to the North 
SoCal delivery point.  However, they were not full for deliveries to SoCal at 
the south system delivery point.


2.    Utilities have opposed pipeline expansions to California

Sempra protested Transwestern's 140 M/D Gallup expansion, arguing that there 
is no need for new capacity (CP99-522).

Sempra has also protested Questar's application to convert an oil line to new 
gas pipeline service to California (S. Trails Expansion).

Steve,

Is it too late to include XMS and ibuyit roll out dates, see comments below.


George,

Any idea what John is referring to as Web site for professional services

George\Suzanne,

Any answer to insurance question and whether we can support events from 
Houston.

Thanks

Kevin

John,

Thanks for your comments.  Unfortunately because of my trip over there, which 
of course you know about, I am receiving this Thurs PM and possibly too 
late to incorporate in the email.  But to address your points;

1) We do not intend to exclude Legal, although we have to finesse Derrick who 
is very protective of his relationships.  Are you referring to the ibuyit 
webite which you refer to, it wasn't clear from your comments

2) You make a good point on the roll out dates as we say that we want all 
employees to use it by July 1 but it may not be active everywhere,
particularly London, by that date.

3) We do not explictedly refer to ibuyit for use in travel in the new memo, 
although roll out dates would help in the same manner as for XMS.

4) TAP is the preferred agency in the US, and I believe also Europe, and we 
mention them by name in the revised memo.  I don't like to be 
constrained to TAP (like Vitol) but it is incredibly easier to manage 
expenses and get standard reporting by using them.  Let me know if TAP
isn't available in Europe.

5) I will have Suzanne Brown check on the insurance issue and get back to you.

6) If Global Travel can't handle your trips due to logistical constraints, I 
would really encourage you and Micheal to institue some 
formal sign off procedure, at your levels, for events exceeding something 
like $5k.

7) Changes made.

Thanks for the comments, hope all is well

Kevin

Here is my suggested response to Kevin on the attached document - may I 
please have your thoughts before I send:
1)  For professional services I think you intend to exclude legal - but I 
would be explicit on this.  Our biggest professional service
is probably AA and that is negotiated with Causey at the lead.  I don't see 
anything on the web page referred here about professional
services.
2)  The on-line expense reporting tool has not yet been rolled out to the 
entire company - so we need to include the roll-out dates
outside of Houston.
3.  The best practices for travel may be included in clicktrip.com but it is 
not obvious to me how one gets a password and absent
that you can't log on.
4.  For travel we have different preferred travel agencies outside of 
Houston.  We should list them. Also many employees have at times
stopped using these services because they found chepaer routes on their own.  
So we will have to handle the delicate matter of reminding
them not to stop thinking and to report to the company and travel agency when 
they are coming up with less expensive alternatives.
5.  Regarding Car rental services are we sure that our contracts cover Enron 
with insurance outside the US?  Again if they come up
with an alternative that is less expensive that the travel agency we want 
them to choose the less expensive route not to mention speaking
up about it.
6.  I will check on it but I doubt if it is practical for the Global Travel 
Management group to arrange off-site groups outside of London.
7.  Last paragraph change "many of who" to "many of whom".


John

Rainfall:   2.0 to 4.0 inches, isolated to 7 to 10 inch amounts possible


Discussion:  
There is a fairly good chance of torrential rainfall to redevelop across your 
area during the overnight hours producing hours producing flooding.  The 
surface and upper level low pressure area that is the remnants of Allison 
will drift southwestward during the night and bands of tropical showers and 
thunderstorms are expected to increase across your area overnight, 
particularly during the period between 2 am and 9 pm Friday morning.  Due to 
the excessive amounts of rain that have already fallen, this is potentially a 
very dangerous situation that may develop.  Rainfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches 
are expected with isolated excessive amounts of 7 to 10 inches possible.  
Occasional to frequent lighting will accompany the stronger storms in the 
downtown area.

DJ US DOE/Calif -2: Action Targets `Unfair Profit'
WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--Looking to avert eminent
blackouts in California, U.S. Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson asserted Wednesday his emergency authority
under the Federal Power Act to order power producers
to make electricity available to the state.

The action came as more than one dozen power producers
informed the California Independent System Operator
they wouldn't make power available unless they receive
payment guarantees.

"I can order a power plant to send power where
needed," Richardson said at a press conference in
Washington. Richardson said he would mandate the price
power producers will receive, promising "a fair
return."

Richardson said, "I won't allow (power producers) to
unfairly profit due to today's market situation."

DJ US DOE/Calif -3: FERC Pledges `Strong Action Soon'
Richardson's announcement came at a press conference
in the Washington office of Sen. Dianne Feinstein,
D-Calif., following a meeting Feinstein brokered
between Richardson, California Gov. Gray Davis, and
James Hoecker, chairman of the U.S. Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission.

The press conference came as the California grid
operator was on the brink of failing in its nearly
yearlong effort to keep the lights on in the state in
the face of chronic power shortages.

Davis and Feinstein said they asked the FERC chairman
to issue an order establishing a region-wide
electricity price cap to stop the hourly export of
between 4,000 megawatts to 5,000 MW out of the state's
troubled market. They also called for FERC to order
power producers to enter into long-term contracts with
the state's distribution utilities at reasonable
prices.

Hoecker pledged that FERC would take "strong action
soon" in response to the electricity crisis. "We
believe in competitive markets, but they have to
behave responsibly and at reasonable prices," he said.


The commission is scheduled to meet Friday morning to
issue a final order restructuring the state's
problem-plagued electricity market. A key issue in the
pending order will be the establishment of price caps.


Hoecker declined to comment on what actions the
commission will take, and on whether the commission
would act sooner than Friday.

Last Friday, the commission issued an order in
response to an emergency petition from California's
grid operator lifting a $250 a megawatt-hour hard
price cap in California's power markets. Prices soon
hit $600/MWh, and have risen above $1,000/MWh since
then, spiking at one point to $1,400/MWh.

Feinstein and Davis accused power producers of
engaging in price gouging at the expense of California
consumers and utilities in the state, which can't pass
on the high cost due to a state-mandated rate freeze.
The escalating prices in the last week have caused a
liquidity crunch for Southern California Edison Co.
(EIX) and Pacific Gas & Electric Co. (PCG), and have
pushed the companies to the brink of bankruptcy.

Davis called the crisis affecting California's
deregulated power market - the first in the nation -
"an incredibly bizarre situation" illustrating "how
markets can be manipulated." Davis expressed optimism
that Richardson's emergency actions will "stop market
abuses" and bring temporary relief.

Energy Price Volatility May Hurt Utilities' Credit

By REBECCA SMITH
Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL

Recent volatility in wholesale energy markets is
undermining the credit ratings and may eventually crimp
the borrowing ability of some of the nation's biggest
utilities, long regarded in the credit markets as some of
the safest bets around.

It is the worst out West, where the price of power to be
delivered Wednesday hit a new high of $1,182 per megawatt
hour on California's state-sanctioned auction, a benchmark
for the entire region. That compares with $30 a year ago.

But even utilities in the East, such as GPU Inc. of
Parsippany, N.J., and Consolidated Edison of New York,
also are at risk because they are paying higher prices
than ever for spot-market electricity purchases and aren't
always able to pass along that cost to their customers.

As an indication of just how bad things are getting,
Moody's Investors Service Tuesday put Seattle City Light
on "negative outlook," even though it is one of the
lowest-cost generators in the nation. There hasn't been
much rain in the Northwest this year and the city-owned
utility has been forced to go to the wholesale market this
month to buy 100 to 200 megawatts of electricity each day.
That isn't much energy, but with prices that have gone as
high as $1,000 per megawatt hour this week, compared with
the $24 per megawatt hour that the municipal utility pays
for power from the federal hydroelectric system, costs add
up fast. The utility, which issued $100 million in bonds
this week, is raising rates 10%, effective Jan. 1, and
will keep the rate increase in effect as long as it takes
to dig its way out.

"Prices are at absurd levels," says Seattle City Light
Superintendent Gary Zarker. "I know others are looking at
significant rate increases too."

Credit-rating agencies say they are going through their
utility portfolios and separating those with exposure to
wholesale markets from those that have enough in-house
generation to meet customer demand. Then they are trying
to figure out which of the ones that are forced to buy on
the spot market will be allowed to pass on higher costs
and which ones won't.

"You have the makings of a credit crunch when utilities
are required to buy power but aren't allowed to pass the
cost through," says Steven Fetter, managing director of
the global power unit at Fitch, the New York credit-rating
agency.

That is exactly the position California's biggest
investor-owned utilities are in. Southern California
Edison Co., a unit of Edison International, and Pacific
Gas and Electric Co., a unit of PG&E Corp., have incurred
deficits in excess of $7 billion buying power on the open
market since June and were forced to pay higher rates and
offer unprecedented guarantees to investors when they last
issued bonds.

While they are still making money from the power plants
they own, it is nowhere near enough to make up for the
shortfall. Credit ratings of both utilities were lowered
this week.

Blown the Lid Off

There is no cost relief in sight. California's grid
operator last week lifted a price cap for power it buys
each hour to keep supply matched with demand. That helped
reliability because more generators came forward and
offered energy through an orderly market, instead of
waiting for harried engineers to call them at the last
minute trying to strike a deal.

But it has really blown the lid off prices in the West.
The average cost of power sold in the day-ahead market
jumped from $250 a megawatt hour last week to $611 on
Monday, $904 Tuesday and to $1,182 for power to be
delivered Wednesday.

This has a huge impact because it applies to roughly
two-thirds of the power consumed in the state and
influences prices elsewhere. The situation differs
markedly from Eastern markets where only a small
proportion of the power consumed comes out of a daily spot
market because most utilities have long-term
power-purchase contracts that supply most of their needs.

Some of the utilities in the Northwest being slammed by
high prices will be in the position of selling power back
in May or June, provided there is enough spring-thaw
runoff to give them surplus hydropower.

Financial Pain

But utility managers worry it won't be enough to cancel
out the financial pain they are currently suffering.

Distribution utilities that deliver the power that others
generate were regarded as the safest part of the utility
business only a few months ago. Wall Street assigned them
the lowest valuations because they face regulated rates of
return.

"Sadly, we now see they chose the part of the business
with a lower upside potential and higher risk," Mr.
Fetter, of Fitch, says.

Constellation to Buy Nine Mile Point Nuclear Plants; Match for Entergy
in New York
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Constellation Nuclear, a wholly owned subsidiary of Constellation Energy,
and the owners of the two Nine Mile Point nuclear power plants announced
that Constellation Nuclear will buy 100 percent of Unit 1 and 82 percent
of Unit 2. Constellation will own a total of 1,550 MW of Nine Mile Point's
1,757 MW of total generating capacity. The total purchase price, including
fuel, is $815 million. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Nuclea=
r
Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the New York Public Utilities Commission
still need to give regulatory approval to the purchase, but Constellation
Nuclear has said it expects the deal to be completed by mid-2001.

ANALYSIS: This is a very strategic move for Constellation Nuclear for sever=
al
reasons. First, the purchase of the plants expands Constellation's generati=
on
assets, which has been one of the key strategies of the company over the
last year. Secondly, the location of the plants is a critical factor.=20
Constellation
has narrowed its competitive strategy to the Northeast region, and New
York in particular is shaping up to be arguably the most important playing
field for nuclear assets. Third, owning the Nine Mile Point plants will
elevate Constellation's stature, moving it ever close to become on par
with its nearest competitor in the New York market, Entergy Corp.

Before I expand on the reasons why I think this is a such a pivotal move
for Constellation Nuclear, let me establish some of the important factors
of the deal. Nine Mile Point is a two-unit boiling water reactor site.
Nine Mile 1 began producing electricity in 1969; Nine Mile 2 began producin=
g
electricity in 1988. The two units are both located in Scriba, N.Y., which
is about 40 miles north of Syracuse. The Nine Mile Point units have had
rather spotty histories, but over the last two years have shown signs of
becoming strong performers. Niagara Mohawk operates both units.

Constellation Nuclear is purchasing the plants from a group of several
different utility owners. Niagara Mohawk happens to be the sole owner of
Unit 1. Unit 2 is owned by a group of co-owners: Niagara Mohawk (41 percent=
),
New York State Electric & Gas (18 percent), Rochester Gas & Electric=20
Corporation
(14 percent), and Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corporation (9 percent).
It is important to note that Constellation Nuclear is only able to purchase
82 percent of Unit 2 because the Long Island Power Authority, an additional
co-owner that controls 18 percent of Unit 2, has opted not to sell its
share of the plant at this time.

The sale came about in part as a result of the New York Public Service
Commission urging nuclear plant owners in the state to determine the market
value of their plants through an open, competitive process. This is part
of an overall effort to separate generation, transmission and distribution
activities within the state.

With that established, I will continue to support my case that the acquisit=
ion
of the Nine Mile Point plants effectively supports Constellation Energy's
growth strategy. In early 2000, Constellation began a restructuring of
its corporate identity, dividing its operations into two separate segments:
one focused on its merchant energy business (including Constellation Nuclea=
r)
and the other focused on regional retail energy services. The merchant
energy business was ranked fifth in the nation for sales of electric power
in the third quarter of 2000, and the company is committed to expanding
this growth. The goal for the merchant energy business, according to=20
Constellation
Energy CEO Christian Poindexter, is to establish a portfolio of over 30,000
MW of electric generation facilities by 2005. Toward that end, Constellatio=
n
Energy acknowledged earlier this year that it would be taking advantage
of "bargain prices for nuclear plants," which resulted in large part from
other utilities focusing on transmission operations and thus choosing,
or being mandated, to divest their generation plants.

Another important point is that the Constellation Nuclear Services group,
a unit within Constellation Nuclear, was established when Baltimore Gas
& Electric, another Constellation Energy subsidiary, created a new area
for its life-cycle license renewal activities. Thus, most likely Constellat=
ion
will be applying to renew the licenses for the two Nine Mile Point units,
and has a core group of people with expertise in this area. License renewal=
s
in general have been moving rather smoothly through the NRC, so there shoul=
d
not be any difficulty for Constellation with regard to this process. The
only challenge might be that the two Nine Mile Point units are very differe=
nt
in age and could be viewed as two separate plants by the NRC.

Presently, Constellation's generation assets are based in a mixture of
coal and nuclear. The nuclear plant purchases that Constellation is making
expand upon its Calvert Cliffs asset, an 850-MW two-unit nuclear plant
in Southern Maryland. As natural gas prices are projected to rise for the
foreseeable future, buyers on the wholesale market may turn to coal and
nuclear as substitutes for their power purchases. Thus, Constellation could
be in a prime position if the desire for nuclear-generated power continues
to rise, as the company anticipates. While Constellation will most likely
retain its coal-fired generation assets, the company is clearly moving
closer toward a nuclear-based portfolio. Constellation has justified its
move in this direction by saying that its experience has found that nuclear
fuel is cheaper than coal and gas generators and that "the economics [of
nuclear] are quite robust, once they are calculated out."

A key element of the acquisition that may get overlooked in the press relea=
ses
is that Constellation Nuclear has secured a 10-year contract to provide
electricity to the sellers at negotiated competitive prices. Specific terms
of the deal are that Constellation has agreed to sell 90 percent of its
share of the Nine Mile Point plants' output back to the sellers at an avera=
ge
price of nearly $35/MWh until 2010. This alone should provide a solid rate
of return for Constellation's merchant energy business.

In addition, as I indicated, the New York location is key factor in this
deal. Aside from its large population, the state of New York is home to
a number of nuclear plants that have come up for sale recently. For these
two reasons alone, New York stands out as the center within Constellation's
focus on the Northeastern United States. Yet, Constellation's competitors
also have the same plan, and have all fought to gain assets in the region.


Just within the last few months, Entergy Corp.=01*which also has based its
strategy to a large extent on nuclear=01*has been aggressively making its
own acquisitions of nuclear plants in New York State. In fact, Entergy
was competing against Constellation Nuclear as one of the other bidders
for the Nine Mile Point plants. I know this because I spoke to Carl Crawfor=
d,
an Entergy spokesperson, back in August and he confirmed that Entergy was
actively attempting to purchase the two plants. However, despite the loss
of the two Nine Mile Point plants, Entergy retains a very strong nuclear
presence in New York. In late November, Entergy closed the sale on the
New York Power Authority's two nuclear power plants, Indian Point Unit
3 in Westchester County and the James A. Fitzpatrick plant in Oswego County=
.
In fact, the purchase of the two plants from NYPA marked the largest=20
acquisition
to date in Entergy's nuclear strategy, and also represented the highest
purchase price ($967 million) ever of a nuclear asset. Earlier in the same
month, Entergy completed a purchase of the Indian Point 2 plant from Con
Edison. Altogether, Entergy now controls over 3,000 MW of nuclear generatio=
n
in the state of New York.

Consequently, since clearly Constellation Nuclear wants to become one of
the top nuclear power producers in the industry, it will need to match
Entergy (along with other competitors such as Exelon and Duke) with regard
to its nuclear portfolio. There is only a limited number of nuclear plants
that will become available for purchase, and thus any acquisition of an
operational nuclear plant is a significant accomplishment for those in
this particular market.

As a sidenote, I established that Niagara Mohawk was one of the primary
sellers of the Nine Mile Point plants (100 percent of Unit 1 and 41 percent
of Unit 2). It is important to remember that Niagara Mohawk is being acquir=
ed
by National Grid, a U.K. company that is considered one of the world's
largest independent transmission companies. The acquisition of Niagara
Mohawk is supporting National Grid's strategy of becoming a major presence
in the transmission and distribution sectors of the U.S. energy industry.
Generation is not a high priority for National Grid, and the sale of Niagar=
a
Mohawk's nuclear assets resulted from this strategy.

Moreover, once again we see a case that represents the divergent approaches
that different companies have toward deregulation in the United States.
Whereas generation does not factor in to Niagara Mohawk's current strategy,
it is a key component for Constellation Energy. There are certainly risks
associated with both approaches, but the bottom line on this deal, from
my perspective, is that Constellation has acquired some valuable assets
in a strong market. It's pretty obvious that Constellation intends to be
a contender in the nuclear arena, especially in New York, and owning the
two Nine Mile Point units should effectuate that goal.

Steve,

Thanks for the phone call a couple of weeks ago.  My wife and I will have a
chance to see Houston this weekend as part of Enron's Sell Weekend.  A team
of Enron employees including some Darden alums has planned many activities
for us this weekend.  It's a great opportunity for her to know the city and
I am sure we'll have a good time.  Hope everything is well.

Edison Mission Energy Power Project Starts Construction After Expedited
Approval By California Energy Commission

 Monday December 11 6:39pm
 Source: Dow Jones

 Operation Targeted for August

 IRVINE, Calif., Dec. 11 /PRNewswire/ -- Edison Mission Energy (EME), an
Edison International company (NYSE: EIX), started construction of its new
 Sunrise power plant on Thursday, December 7, having received expedited
approval from the California Energy Commission (CEC) to proceed. The
 power generation facility will be located in Kern County, California, and
will bring both short- and long-term generation capacity to the state, which
is in
 dire need of new power generation.

 "From the onset of the California power crisis, we have sought to find
means to bring new power to the California market," said John E. Bryson,
 chairman and CEO of Edison International. "This CEC approval will help
ensure that this critical new project will be able to provide a significant
amount
 of new peaking power to the state as soon as next August. Our thanks and
appreciation go to the California Energy Commission, and the
 environmental and regulatory agencies for their swift consideration of this
important project."

 "This power has been offered by contract to the state so that the pricing
for it does not depend on California's broken deregulated power market,"
said
 Alan J. Fohrer, president and CEO of EME. "Alternatively, EME will seek to
enter into a long-term, cost-based contract with either Pacific Gas &
 Electric Company or San Diego Gas & Electric Company to further ensure that
California's consumers reap the benefit of this additional power
 resource," Fohrer said.

 The Sunrise Power Project will be completed in two phases. Phase 1 will
consist of a 320-megawatt (MW), simple-cycle peaking facility scheduled to
 be in service during the summer 2001. Phase 2 will convert the peaking
facility to a 560-MW, combined-cycle operation with an in-service date of
 summer 2003. The project will meet or exceed all pertinent environmental
and safety standards.

 Final regulatory approvals have been received for Phase I of the project
only.

 EME will be seeking expedited permitting approval for the Phase II
expansion in line with the fast-track approval process recently enacted by
the
 California legislature.

 EME has also negotiated an agreement with the labor unions for an adequate
supply of highly skilled labor in order to achieve an accelerated
 construction schedule. The accelerated schedule is aimed at providing this
additional power to California by next summer.

 Edison Mission Energy specializes in the development, acquisition,
construction management and operation of global power production facilities.
As
 one of the world's leading global power producers, Edison Mission Energy
owns nearly 23,000 megawatts of generating capacity, including interests in
 75 projects currently under construction or operating in Australia,
Indonesia, Italy, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Spain, Thailand, Turkey, the
United
 Kingdom and the United States.

 Based in Rosemead, Calif., Edison International is a premier international
electric power generator, distributor and structured finance provider. With
a
 portfolio of approximately 28,000 megawatts, Edison International is an
industry leader in privatized, deregulated and incentive-regulated markets
and
 power generation. It is the parent company of Edison Mission Energy,
Southern California Edison, Edison Capita, Edison Enterprises and Edison
 O&M Services.

Re the attached email , he is highly recommended by Reliant's lawyer in 
Saramento. Jacobs served in Drivon's role in the Senate proceedings involving 
Ins Comm'r Quackenbush last year and is well known and respected in the 
Legislature. He has been informally advising Reliant's lawyer on contempt 
issues. He does not think he has a conflict and will confirm that. Initially 
his role would be solely as a consultant.

              Ray Suarez, co-anchor:

              Finally, it's the latest hot idea for reducing energy
              costs.  Twenty-three states have enacted legislation to
              deregulate electricity rates and sixteen others are
              thinking about it, but California's pioneering efforts have
              already provoked an angry consumer backlash.  Spencer
              Michaels reports.

              Spencer Michaels reporting:

              In a San Diego strip mall, the owner of the tiny Youngling
              Oriental Vegetarian Market is having a hard time.  Yuman
              (?) Young owes two thousand dollars to San Diego Gas &
              Electric--SDG&E--an amount he can't come up with.  Like
              many San Diegans, his electricity bill has skyrocketed this
              year.

              So this is your bill in March, right?

              Yuman Young (Youngling Oriental Vegetarian Market):  Right.

              Michaels:  And the bill is--

              Young:  And see, in March, the bill comes to about four
              seventy-eight.

              Michaels:  Then we have May.

              Young:  In May, it...

              Michaels:  Then we're up--

              Young:  ...goes to six seventy something.

              Michaels:  Six seventy-four.

              Young:  Yeah.

              Michaels:  And then--

              Young:  And then...

              Michaels:  And then we skip...

              Young:  ...we skip a month.

              Michaels:  ...June, but in July--

              Young:  And the--then in July, it goes to about thirteen
              hundred dollars.

              Michaels:  Thirteen hundred dollars?

              Young:  Yeah.

              Michaels:  And the same in August?

              Young:  And the same in August.

              Michaels:  Over thirteen hundred dollars.

              Young:  Yeah, right.

              Michaels:  Young's main electricity expense is his frozen
              food freezer that he keeps at minus seventeen degrees.  But
              people without such appliances have seen residential and
              commercial bills double and triple as well.  San Diego is
              the first California city to suffer the effects of the
              deregulation of electricity, which was enacted by the state
              legislature in 1996.  The theory was that by taking away
              the monopolies enjoyed by state-regulated utility
              companies, like SDG&E, new competition among electricity
              producers would result in a drop in rates.  But since such
              simple market economics would take awhile, the legislature
              imposed a temporary rate freeze to protect most parts of
              the state from higher prices.  In San Diego, the freeze
              came off this year letting the market set the price, a
              very high price.  SDG&E is owned by Sempra Energy, where
              Stephen Baum is CEO.

              Stephen Baum (Chief Executive Officer, Sempra Energy):
              It's been a terrible shock to our customers, seeing
              real-time prices for the first time.  And those prices are
              way out of sight because the wholesale market is broken and
              needs to be fixed.

              Michaels:  The vast wholesale market is something new.
              California utilities used to own most of the power plants,
              the high-voltage transmission lines and the system to
              deliver power to homes and businesses.  Under deregulation
              the utilities still deliver the power, but had to turn
              operations of the transmission lines over to a state
              agency.  In addition, they had to sell their power plants.
              So now almost all power is sold to the utilities on a
              wholesale basis by producers or generators.  And according
              to Baum, they charge what they can get.

              Baum:  There's been a very large wealth transfer from the
              customers in the state of California to the generators.  We
              don't think the market's workably competitive.  There
              aren't enough players and there's not enough generation.
              Until that occurs, you're going to have dislocations at
              very high prices.

              Michaels:  The situation keeps getting worse as
              California's population keeps increasing, especially in the
              hot central valley.  Air conditioners and other appliances
              put a strain on a system already stressed by increased
              demand in other states where some of California's power
              comes from.  According to University of California
              economist Severin Borenstein, deregulation has aggravated
              the already tight situation.

              Severin Borenstein (University of California, Berkeley):
              Production in the state has really been stretched and that
              does two things:  One, is it naturally just creates a tight
              supply/demand situation that's going to drive prices up.
              The other thing it does, though, is it also puts the
              producers in a very strong position to push prices up even
              higher.  And, I think, there's no question the generators
              are trying to make as much money as they can.

              Michaels:  Duke Energy, headquartered in North Carolina, is
              one of the new generators in the California market.  Duke
              spokesman Tom Williams says much of its power was sold
              before prices rose and that profits are plowed back into
              new plants.

              The utilities and the consumer groups seem to think that
              the generators are making a lot of money on this crisis.
              Is that true?

              Tom Williams (Duke Energy Corporation):  Duke Energy sells
              the bulk of its power in the--in the forward market.  It
              was sold a year ago for the plants we have in the state
              now.  So the power's already been sold, and the price of
              natural gas has gone up two and a half times since last
              summer.  So there is a very tight supply situation, but
              we're reinvesting our profits back into the market to fix
              the problem.
              Michaels:  In fact, Duke is investing 1.1 billion dollars
              to modernize two inefficient power plants it bought from
              the utilities.  As part of the deal it also had to buy
              this old PG&E plant in Oakland, which has been running
              overtime because of the power shortage.  Over the last two
              decades only a few companies have actually begun
              construction of new power plants because of what they saw
              as the uncertainties of the regulatory climate.  This plant
              near San Francisco, being built by Calpine, will supply
              enough electricity for half a million homes.  It will be
              ready by next summer.  Calpine vice president, James
              Macias, says his company predicted the shortage of power
              and took a risk.

              James Macias (Vice President, Calpine):  You could see the
              fundamentals forming of the need for more--more power.
              There hasn't been a big power plant like this built in the
              state for--for decades.

              Michaels:  Macias says the utilities should have contracted
              for power at lower rates before it was actually needed.  He
              expects that the profits power companies are making now
              will decline as more power comes on line.

              Macias:  We're doing pretty good.  We're being rewarded for
              having the vision and the foresight to come in here and
              build this--this--this needed supply.  But they're not
              going to last.  As soon as this--more of the supply comes
              in, the prices will come down and they'll be--they'll be
              depressed again.  They have to come down.  This economy,
              again, can't support these high prices.

              Michaels:  Although twenty new plants are in the planning
              stages, it takes five years to design and build just one.
              With very little additional supply in the immediate
              pipeline, the director of San Diego's utility watchdog
              group, Utility Consumers Action Network, says regulators
              must get involved to return rates to reasonable levels.

              Michael Shames (Consumer Advocate):  They could have
              immediately put--reinstated a price cap.  They could have
              immediately said, hold on a second folks.  We're not going
              to tolerate this.  We're not going to see a region like San
              Diego thrust into a depression.

              Michaels:  But Michael Shames says some legislators and
              regulators were ruled by their uncompromising belief in a
              free-market ideology.

              Shames:  There were a number of people, well-placed people,
              who were so ideologically driven to force competition to
              work in a market such as energy that they didn't want to
              look at the signs when they saw that the experiment wasn't
              working.  They didn't want to acknowledge it wasn't
              working, and they were prepared to sacrifice a city, San
              Diego, a state, California, and possibly a country, in
              order to see their ideologically driven vision--vision
              work.  (Clip from a TV commercial)

              Michaels:  Shames' consumer group was so outraged at the
              price increases they bought TV ads and urged civil
              disobedience.

              Dianne Jacob (Chair, San Diego County Supervisor):  Join me
              and other San Diegans and let's send a message.  Pay only
              what is fair.  When your SDG&E bill comes, pay what you
              paid last summer.  That's fair.

              Michaels:  At the California Public Utilities Commission,
              President Loretta Lynch agrees that regulators could remedy
              the situation, but she says it's not up to the state.
              Only the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has the power
              to cut back prices.

              Loretta Lynch (California Public Utilities Commission):  If
              the federal government allowed power plant owners to make a
              reasonable profit instead of an excessive profit, then that
              would drop the price of wholesale power.  And if that price
              dropped we would not be in the pickle we're in today.

              Michaels:  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission president,
              James Hoecker, replies that simply using price controls
              discourages investment in an industry that needs it.

              James Hoecker (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission):  What
              my friend, President Lynch, has said reflects a kind of
              thinking that markets can never be made to work and that
              ultimately we have to resort to cost-based, profit kinds of
              regulation of utilities.  And I think that this market has
              marched past that as an option.

              Michaels:  In November, the Federal Energy Regulatory
              Commission proposed a major change.  Utilities would not be
              required to buy power from the power exchange--a kind of
              stock market for electricity where prices have soared.
              Instead, the utilities will be able to buy directly from
              producers.  The federal agency has launched an
              investigation into California's troubles, hoping for a
              long-term solution.

              Unidentified Woman:  This legislation, today, has the
              ability to provide immediate and real relief to San
              Diegans.

              Michaels:  The California legislature struggled this year
              with what to do, short term, for the people of San Diego.
              The debate centered around a proposal to cap electricity
              bills at sixty-five dollars a month, retroactive to June 1.

              Charlene Zettel (Assembly Member, Republican, San Diego):
              What is San Diego's problem today will be California's
              problem tomorrow.

              Rico Oller (Assembly Member, Republican, San Diego):  You
              know who we can thank for this problem?  You want to get
              right down to brass tacks?  You can thank all of the
              knuckle-headed people in this legislature and in
              government, in general--in general, who have stood in the
              way of doing the smart and sensible thing that anyone would
              have the sense to do in the real world, and that is to
              provide for their future needs by increasing production.
              We need to build some facilities to produce power.

              Unidentified Man:  All debate having ceased, the clerk will
              open the roll.  All members vote who desire to vote.

              Michaels:  The San Diego rate cap passed, but the state is
              still far from a solution.  Higher electric rates are
              forecasted for the rest of the state as the caps come off
              in other cities.  And even more troubling is the fact that
              the price rollback is being bankrolled by the utilities,
              since they still have to pay the generators for the power
              but can't pass those prices on to their customers.

              Economist Borenstein says other states better examine
              California's experience before proceeding with
              deregulation.

              Borenstein:  I think most states that are deregulating
              right now, if they have a tight supply situation, are very
              likely to see spikes just like ours.  The best advice I
              think for most of these states is to take a break, not move
              forward on their deregulation, watch the experiments that
              are going on in California and New York and Pennsylvania
              and Texas and a number of other states and learn from them,
              because we're learning a lot from them as we do this.

              Michaels:  The success or failure of deregulation across
              the country will depend partly on easy access to power
              transmission lines so that electricity can be transferred
              more readily to where it's needed.  The federal government
              is working on that problem.

Maureen, when I last met with Steve, we discussed having 2 of my direct 
reports attend the December 9th PRC meeting.  He requested that I decide and 
tell you which two.  I have decided on Jeff Keeler and Henry Van.  Thanks

Every year, a holiday gift is sent from the Executive Committee and is 
normally a donation to a charity of Enron's choice.  This year, we have tried 
a different approach. Elyse Kalmans and Kathy Mayfield from Community 
Relations recommended an on-line service called Chairtygift.com.  Each 
recipient can select the charity of their choice from many hundreds in the 
United States.  Should they choose to not go on-line and select a charity, 
the amount of that person's gift will default to DePelchin.  Kathy is 
receiving thank you notes by e-mail so I wanted to share with you.

I have received two other thank you notes for the Charitygifts.  Upon 
redemption, there is a place for recipients to send a thank you via email and 
currently I am set up as the person to receive them.  Is that ok?  I don't 
mind and can forward them to you as I get them or save them and get them to 
you all at once.  It's great feedback and I think Ken would enjoy seeing 
their responses.  It seems as though people are enjoying getting them and 
being able to choose one of their favorite charities.  Let me know what you 
think.  I am also drafting a letter to go to DePelchin letting them know that 
we are doing this.  Would you like for it to come from Ken?  Thanks, Kathy

Kathy,
Eileen and I were most pleased to have the opportunity to donate to Southern 
Tier (NY) Hospice Corporation via the Charity Gift Card that Enron Executive 
Committee sent us.  Enron displays uncommon leadership in humanitarian 
activities as well as the business world.  Our thanks go to Ken and the 
Executive Committee.
Very truly yours,

Put simply, in the past month the focus of the California energy crisis, an=

maybe the onus as well, has moved east: from the state's (and Davis')=20

In a recent paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research,=20
Joskow and Kahn conclude that there's "considerable evidence that the high=

at off-hours, when no one had ever seen a price spike before, makes those=

California-Arizona border wasn't merely the result of an innocent imbalance=

Is trading an insider's game?=20



Buying, selling of electricity is a growth business, but some say deck is=
=20
stacked against consumers
By Craig D. Rose=20
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER=20
June 6, 2001=20
While Californians decry deregulation's failure to deliver a competitive=20
market, electricity wholesalers have quietly developed a vast and rapidly=
=20
growing business of buying and selling power among themselves.=20
The deals take place on high-tech trading floors in Houston and elsewhere=
=20
around the country, as well as on Internet-based trading systems.=20
Some experts say this electricity trading is a key mechanism for raising=20
consumer power prices, yet it's largely unregulated.=20

"Electricity trading is like buying stock -- when you have ability to chang=
e=20
the stock price," said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economics profess=
or=20
and member of the state grid operator's market surveillance group.=20
Energy companies say the buying and selling of contracts to deliver power=
=20
provides risk management, allowing plant owners to presell their electricit=
y,=20
lock in prices and avoid fluctuations. The rough and tumble of the free=20
market, they add, is the most efficient means of allocating a resource like=
=20
electricity.=20
But industry critics say trading is far from a competitive market paradigm.=
=20
In their view, it's a means of communication -- a way for energy insiders t=
o=20
collude and raise prices under the guise of competition.=20
To be sure, the trading arms of major energy companies have emerged as star=
s=20
in an industry where profit surges of 300 percent or 400 percent are not=20
uncommon.=20
The transactions, shrouded in secrecy, can leave ownership of a critical=20
commodity in unknown hands. Consider the case of power generated by AES=20
Corp.'s California plants.=20
In 1998, AES made a bold move. Immediately after purchasing power plants th=
at=20
gave it control of 10 percent of the state's electric generating capacity,=
=20
the company sold the output from its plants for the next 20 years to Willia=
ms=20
Cos.=20
Williams did not sit on this treasure trove of electrons. The Tulsa, Okla.,=
=20
company soon sold 80 percent of what it bought.=20
It is difficult to say who owns that power now. Some might be owned by Semp=
ra=20
Trading, a sister company of SDG&E. Or some could be owned by Enron Corp.,=
=20
the nation's biggest electricity trader.=20
A spokeswoman for Williams conceded that Williams itself may have repurchas=
ed=20
some of the electricity it sold earlier. But trading companies closely guar=
d=20
their positions.=20
This much can be said with certainty: Electricity that AES sold for less th=
an=20
5 cents per kilowatt-hour to Williams changed hands perhaps 10 times in the=
=20
wholesale market and emerged at times in recent months with a price tag for=
=20
consumers that was 300 percent higher.=20
Williams' trading profits increased by 523 percent in the first quarter thi=
s=20
year.
Advance sales
All this buying and selling creates curious confluences.=20
In their attempt to deflect criticism over high prices, generating companie=
s=20
such as Duke Energy -- operator of the South Bay Power Plant in Chula and=
=20
others in the state -- frequently note that they sell most of their=20
electricity far in advance. But they acknowledge less often that their=20
trading units may also be buying power, which could boost the company's=20
electricity inventory.=20
Duke was the fourth biggest electricity trader last year and cited its=20
trading activity as a prime contributor to its wholesale business profits,=
=20
which soared 324 percent in the first quarter to $348 million.=20
It is a company's power traders who frequently direct plant operators to=20
increase or decrease the generation of power in response to market=20
conditions.=20
Energy companies have little option but to turn to trading for profits. One=
=20
of the better kept secrets of electrical deregulation and its promise of=20
competition is that there is remarkably little competition in the productio=
n=20
side of the business.=20
For one thing, electricity is a commodity; power from one company is=20
indistinguishable from that generated by others.=20
More important, nearly all modern plants generate power from turbines built=
=20
by a handful of manufacturers. The result? Modern plants owned by different=
=20
companies produce power at nearly identical cost.=20
"The cost of power produced by modern plants is all within a mil=20
(one-thousandth of a dollar)," said Michael Peevey, an adviser to Gov. Gray=
=20
Davis and former president of Southern California Edison.=20
So the extraction of profit in the electricity business relies much more on=
=20
trading. Traders' profits rise when prices are volatile -- plunging, or eve=
n=20
better, rising sharply.
Little regulation
But despite the obvious temptation to manipulate the market, the burgeoning=
=20
electricity trading business has remained largely unregulated.=20
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission does require quarterly filings fro=
m=20
energy traders, but these often provide incomplete information, or at least=
=20
little that has been of concern to FERC.=20
In fact, although the trading of electricity grew more than a hundredfold=
=20
from 1996 to 2000, FERC has taken no major enforcement action against a=20
trader. After the onset of the California crisis last year, FERC has acted=
=20
once. That was against Williams, which agreed to pay $8 million without=20
admitting guilt to resolve an allegation that it withheld supply to pump up=
=20
prices.=20
FERC's record of enforcement in the area of power trading stands in contras=
t=20
to a long list of enforcement actions within other markets taken by the=20
Securities Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission=
.=20
FERC has recently added staff to its market oversight operations. But Willi=
am=20
Massey, a FERC commissioner, says the agency's effort is still inadequate.=
=20
"Electricity can be flipped, stripped and chopped up," Massey said. "It's a=
n=20
extraordinarily complicated market.=20
"The sophisticated marketers and traders have simply moved past us. We're=
=20
kind of horse and buggy in our approach and they're out there in rocket shi=
ps=20
flying around ... The problem is that sophisticated traders don't necessari=
ly=20
produce reasonable prices. They produce profits."=20
Before deregulation, electricity trading was a low-key affair. Regulated=20
utilities dealt power back and forth on a reciprocal basis to fill=20
electricity shortfalls in their control areas. There was little trading for=
=20
profit until the mid-1990s, after federal legislation and FERC rulings open=
ed=20
the market.=20
Major traders include large energy companies, sister companies of=20
California's major utilities and Wall Street firms.
Market volatility
In many ways, the trading of power is similar to that of other commodities.=
=20
But there are important differences. Because it cannot be stored and its us=
e=20
is so fundamental, the price of electricity is the most volatile of all.=20
When supplies are tight, a single supplier can rapidly raise prices to=20
budget-busting levels, as evidenced by Duke Energy's recent admission that =
it=20
charged California nearly $4,000 for a megawatt-hour of power, a quantity=
=20
that probably sold hours earlier for one-tenth of that sum or less.=20
Wolak, the Stanford economist, and state Sen. Joseph Dunn, D-Garden Grove,=
=20
who is investigating the state power market, say trading allows companies t=
o=20
collude under the guise of competition. Instead of wringing out lowest cost=
s,=20
the wholesale trading market serves to raise prices, they say.=20
"As I trade to you and you trade to me, we communicate to each other what=
=20
price we would like to get," said Wolak. "It's not collusive. It's just=20
communicating price."=20
Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Enron, the nation's biggest power trader, said=
=20
California's problem is not the result of trading.=20
"It's a result of shortages," Palmer said.=20
Underscoring its emphasis on trading, Enron's new headquarters tower in=20
downtown Houston rises from a six-story block of new trading floors,=20
including expanded space for electricity trading.=20
Enron also pioneered trading in cyberspace and its Enron Online site claims=
=20
to be the most active computer-based trading market.=20
The Houston company argues that consumers won't fully benefit from power=20
trading and deregulation until they have greater choice in choosing their=
=20
power supplier. And the company says FERC has not done enough to open acces=
s=20
to transmission lines, which would allow traders to move power around the=
=20
country. To that end, Enron has lobbied hard for President Bush's plan for =
a=20
national electricity grid.=20
Palmer says the notion that the price of electricity rises each time it is=
=20
traded is mistaken.=20
"The market is always looking for the real price of a commodity," Palmer=20
said.=20
Dunn, the California state senator, says his investigation found a differen=
t=20
function for trading. At a time when supply barely meets or falls short of=
=20
demand, he noted, companies with electricity to sell have to worry only abo=
ut=20
how high to set their price.=20
"The trader is a pawn in the generator's game to drive up prices," said Dun=
n.=20
"Trading develops a level of trust. You, my alleged competitor, will bid in=
=20
the same patterns and I will respond not in a competitive pattern but in a=
=20
complimentary pattern."=20
The state senator said his investigation found evidence that on several day=
s,=20
energy companies appeared to test their ability to drive prices up, without=
=20
being undercut by competitors.=20
This ability to drive up prices without competitive consequence is a key te=
st=20
of market power, the technical term for manipulation or price fixing.=20
But Dunn also conceded that antitrust violations can be hard to prove in=20
court. He suggested that even if the trading behavior falls short of=20
antitrust violations, it remains anti-competitive and devastating for the=
=20
California economy.=20
To Harry Trebing, a utility industry expert and professor emeritus at=20
Michigan State University, wholesale electricity trading is reminiscent of=
=20
what took place in the 1920s and early '30s. Back then, utility companies=
=20
created complex networks of holding companies that traded stock among=20
themselves, driving up prices in the process.=20
Undoing that scheme was a focus of President Franklin Roosevelt's=20
administration. Congress ended up barring national power companies and=20
tightening regulation of utilities, in an effort to counteract their tenden=

to create markets that work only for insiders.=20
"The broad goals of trading are the same," Trebing said.=20

The developments, if they turn out to be a trend and not temporary, could b=

CalPeak Power of San Diego has asked the commission to approve a 49-megawat=

That plant is permitted to emit up to 5 parts per million of nitrogen oxide=

The CalPeak plant, if approved, would be restricted to 2 parts per million =

among the chief concerns of residents who spoke at the City Council hearing=

on the Ramco project and at the energy commission hearings about the CalPea=

But under the terms of approval recommended by Energy Commission Chairman=
=20
William Keese, CalPeak's plant would be able to operate "up to 8,760 hours=

per year, typically when the demand for electricity is high." That number=

Escondido Councilwoman June Rady said she was frustrated by the possibility=

'Hi, My Name Isn't Justice, Honey,' and Shame on Lockyer=20
By TOM G. PALMER

d=20
dude who says, 'Hi, my name is Spike, honey."'=20
?????Here's why Lockyer should be removed from his office of public trust:=
=20
First, because as the chief law enforcement officer of the largest state in=

the nation, he not only has admitted that rape is a regular feature of the=

?????Second, because he has publicly stated that he would like to personall=

?????Lockyer's remarks reveal him to be an authoritarian thug, someone whol=

?????But his remarks do have one positive merit: They tell us what criminal=
=20
penalties really entail.=20
?????Contrary to some depictions of prisons as country clubs, they are=20
violent and terrible places. More and more politicians propose criminal=20
sanctions for more and more alleged misdeeds, and as a result ever more kin=
ds=20
of behavior are sanctioned by criminal penalties, perhaps now even selling=

electricity. Those found guilty of such crimes are put into cages, where th=

acknowledged, raped and brutalized. What's worse, Lockyer has indicated tha=
t=20
he believes that rape is an appropriate part of the system of punishments h=
e=20
administers.=20
?????Should it matter that Lay is a businessman? Imagine the outcry if the=

to=20
that?=20
?????Should it matter that Lay is chairman of an electricity generator? Doe=

=20
Lockyer told the Los Angeles Times that he had singled out Enron's chairman=
=20
because the Houston-based company is the world's largest energy trader.=20
?????So apparently singling out a man for a heinous threat is OK because he=

someone and threatening him with the brutal use of physical force simply=20
because he heads the world's largest energy trading company.=20

California have fallen sharply in recent weeks, and experts said Tuesday th=
at=20
the relief could be the harbinger of an energy turnaround.=20
Or it may be just a blip.=20
In the last couple of weeks, California power prices have plunged to the=20
lowest levels since April 2000, traders say, with electricity selling on so=
me=20
days for less than $100 per megawatt-hour.=20
At night, when demand slackens, power sometimes sells for less than $20 per=
=20
megawatt-hour. That is reminiscent of the days before prices went haywire=
=20
last summer.=20
It is a drastically different scenario than the $500 to $800 the state paid=
=20
during a spate of hot weather last month.=20
Meanwhile, wholesale natural gas prices at a bellwether pipeline junction o=
n=20
the Southern California -Arizona border dipped last week to their lowest=20
levels since November, according to a publication that tracks the industry.=
=20
Separately, Southern California Gas Co. and Pacific Gas & Electric Co.=20
reported June rate cuts for their residential gas customers of 16% and 38%,=
=20
respectively.=20
Experts credited a combination of conservation, mild weather, a burst of=20
increased hydroelectric generation and lower natural gas prices for the dro=
p=20
in electricity costs.=20
"Conservation is starting to worry the generators, which is nice to see,"=
=20
said Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California Energy=20
Institute in Berkeley. Californians used 11% less energy last month than in=
=20
May 2000, according to the state Energy Commission.=20
"I'm worried that if we don't push harder on conservation, [prices] won't=
=20
stay down," Borenstein added.=20
On the natural gas side, experts said the price decline is due to replenish=
ed=20
storage within California , a nationwide drop in the cost of the fuel and=
=20
easing demand from power plants.=20
The number of shippers competing to get natural gas to the state has also=
=20
increased, with the expiration of a controversial contract on the El Paso=
=20
pipeline system last week.=20
But economists were reluctant to make sweeping predictions based on the=20
latest indicators.=20
"It's hard to draw specific conclusions," said Bruce Henning, who tracks th=
e=20
natural gas markets for Energy and Environmental Analysis Inc., an Arlingto=
n,=20
Va., consulting firm.=20
How the summer turns out depends on the weather in the state, Henning said,=
=20
adding, "The weather represents the balance in the Southern California=20
market."=20
Natural gas fuels most California power plants. With wholesale prices=20
recently averaging three to four times the rates charged elsewhere in the=
=20
country, state and federal officials have despaired of chances for=20
controlling electricity costs.=20
Last Friday, however, the daily price for immediate delivery of natural gas=
=20
in Topock, Ariz., a pipeline junction near the California border, dipped to=
=20
$7.85 per million British thermal units.=20
According to Natural Gas Week, it was the first time since mid-November tha=
t=20
the price at that location had fallen below $8 per million BTUs. One millio=
n=20
BTUs is what a typical Southern California home uses in five or six days.=
=20
Considered a bellwether for other pipeline systems serving California , the=
=20
Topock price reached a record $56.54 per million BTUs on Dec. 8. It stood a=
t=20
$9.36 per million BTUs at the close of business Tuesday, still below recent=
=20
weekly averages.=20
Other industry publications have also picked up signals of price declines.=
=20
Platts, the energy information division of McGraw-Hill Cos., reported Tuesd=
ay=20
that the price for monthly gas delivery contracts to California fell 22% in=
=20
June, following a nationwide trend.=20
But Henning said the drop in California prices is attributable to both lowe=
r=20
prices around the country and a decline in the high markups for shipping ga=
s=20
to California . Those markups, which far exceed the cost of transporting ga=
s,=20
have drawn the attention of state and federal investigators.=20
Henning said the markups are declining as depleted storage levels in=20
California are replenished. "Storage levels have been filling very rapidly,=
=20
and that fact is reflected in prices coming down," he said.=20
The link between natural gas and electricity prices is a hotly debated=20
subject. Some experts say high-priced natural gas is driving up the cost of=
=20
electricity . Others believe that record prices for power are raising the=

Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said Tuesday that average daily power=20

LOWER BILLS: Cheaper fuel, milder weather credited=20

California electricity prices have plunged unexpectedly to their lowest lev=
el=20
in more than a year, partly as the result of a simultaneous drop in prices=
=20
for natural gas, which fuels most power plants.=20
Make no mistake: Gas and electricity prices could surge upward again in=20
months ahead.=20
But for the first time since California's energy markets went haywire last=
=20
summer, industry experts are beginning to ask whether the state finally may=
=20
have turned a corner in its battle with runaway power costs.=20
"California is not yet out of the woods," said Kelley Doolan, who tracks=20
natural gas prices for energy market researcher Platts. "But this is a very=
=20
significant decrease in costs."=20
Along with lower gas prices, the decline in electricity costs was attribute=
d=20
by state and industry officials to milder weather, which reduces demand for=
=20
power. They also credited recent conservation efforts by consumers and=20
better-than-expected runoff at dams for hydroelectric plants.=20
Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an=20
energy-industry association, said these factors came together to produce th=
e=20
lowest wholesale electricity prices since April 2000.=20
Electricity on the spot market could have been purchased yesterday for as=
=20
little as $50 per megawatt hour, he noted, compared with more than $500=20
earlier this year.=20
"If the weather stays this way, we could have reasonable prices all summer,=
 "=20
Ackerman said. "We may also have fewer blackouts."=20
It is tempting for Californians to be suspicious of virtually any swing in=
=20
energy prices. If power companies manipulated prices on the way up, as=20
critics have alleged, might they not be up to some trick as prices head in=
=20
the opposite direction?=20
Nettie Hoge, executive director of The Utility Reform Network in San=20
Francisco, speculated that generators are allowing electricity prices to fa=
ll=20
so they can discourage federal regulators from taking a more active role in=
=20
the dysfunctional California market.=20
"They're trying to take the heat off," she said.=20
Others cautioned that the lower prices may be nothing more than a statistic=
al=20
blip.=20
"This was just one month's decline," said Michael Shames, executive directo=
r=20
of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego. "We really have to s=
ee=20
how this plays out in the future."=20
Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, said the governor was very=
=20
encouraged by the lower energy prices. Davis announced Sunday that=20
California's power use was down 11 percent last month from a year before.=
=20
"We're not there yet," Maviglio said of whether an end to the state's power=
=20
woes is in sight. "But the trend is pointing in the right direction."=20
WHITE ELEPHANT
Yet this sudden drop in energy prices does have a dark side: California cou=
ld=20
end up with a huge white elephant after spending about $40 billion in publi=
c=20
funds on long-term power contracts.=20
The logic behind the contracts, which are at an average price of $69 per=20
megawatt hour over 10 years, is that the state expected to pay below-market=
=20
rates for electricity for a number of years before prices came down and=20
California found itself paying above-market rates.=20
If current trends continue, though, California will find itself paying=20
consistently above-market rates much sooner than expected, making the long-=
=20
term contracts a sweet deal for the same power companies that profited so=
=20
handsomely during the state's darkest hours.=20
"The contracts look really ugly right now," said Shames at the Utility=20
Consumers' Action Network. "They may be way overpriced."=20
Maviglio, the governor's spokesman, said it is too early to conclude that t=
he=20
state did poorly negotiating dozens of long-term power contracts.=20
"No one has a crystal ball on this," he said.=20
CUSTOMERS' BILLS TO DROP
In any case, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. said yesterday that customers'=20
average gas bills will drop 26 percent this month to $26 and should stay ne=
ar=20
that level all summer.=20
Platts, which monitors average monthly spot prices, found that the wholesal=
e=20
price of gas at the California-Oregon border has tumbled nearly 42 percent=
=20
since the beginning of May -- from $9.98 per million British thermal units =
to=20
$5.81.=20
The wholesale gas price at the California-Arizona border fell 45 percent,=
=20
from $11.91 to $6.50. This compares with a 25 percent monthly decline in=20
average natural gas prices nationwide.=20
However, California gas prices are still about 50 percent higher than they=
=20
were a year ago, whereas national prices are now below year-ago levels for=
=20
the first time since last spring.=20
While cooler weather nationwide helped push gas prices down overall, Doolan=
=20
attributed the especially steep drop in California to a commensurate surge =
in=20
prices last month related to fears of a long, hot summer of rolling=20
blackouts.=20
"You had state officials all but promising rolling blackouts this summer," =
he=20
said. "That created enormous demand for electricity generation.=20
"What has changed is that we've had weeks of mild weather," Doolan observed=
.=20
"The electricity generators have not come out of the woodwork buying up all=
=20
the gas."=20
This allowed utilities like PG&E to beef up gas inventories, which eased=20
demand and resulted in substantially lower prices, he said.=20
'BACK ON TRACK'=20
"We're back on track to be completely full for winter," said Staci Homrig, =
a=20
PG&E spokeswoman. "That's a very good thing."=20
Gas prices historically dip in the spring and summer and then rise again in=
=20
the winter. PG&E is forecasting that customers' average gas bills could ris=
e=20
to as high as $75 in December if current trends continue.=20
However, the precipitous drop in gas prices in recent weeks suggests that=
=20
California's unusually high costs at last may be abating.=20
Individual power companies so far are reluctant to speculate on whether the=
=20
drop in gas prices will have a lasting effect on electricity costs.=20

In a clear sign that the political landscape has shifted because of the=20

for construction of a generating plant it had unanimously opposed in=20

That pressure -- increased by the occasional rolling blackout -- has come=

from nearly every corner of the state, from elected officials to high-tech=

businesses and labor unions worried the power crisis will drain away jobs,=

ruin the economy and lead to voter backlash over skyrocketing energy bills.=

Even the local branch of the NAACP and environmentalists pushed the council=

to approve the Calpine proposal -- despite overwhelming opposition from the=

"I'm just as unhappy as everybody else," Vice Mayor George Shirakawa said. =
"I=20
feel like no matter what happens, we can't win."=20
GOVERNOR OFFERED HIS SUPPORT
After the council's solid opposition in November, Calpine appealed to the=

California Energy Commission, which has the final say. The controversial=20
plant then received a huge boost in April when Gov. Gray Davis threw his=20
support behind it.=20
San Jose officials conceded yesterday that the energy commission was likely=

to override their opposition and grant approval within a few weeks. They sa=

the commission's likely approval was stripping them of their power to decid=

"What I think has happened . . . is the governor and the Legislature at the=

CONSTRUCTION MAY BEGIN SOON
If given the go-ahead by the state, Calpine could begin construction as ear=
ly=20
as next month. The natural-gas fired plant would generate electricity by=20
mid-2003, company spokesman Kenneth Arbeu said.=20
At the urging of Mayor Ron Gonzales, the council yesterday approved a new=
=20
"cooperation agreement" with Calpine. The vote, with Councilman Forrest=20
Williams casting the lone nay, is preliminary while a final vote that is=20
scheduled for June 26.=20
Gonzales argued that the agreement did not amount to a flip-flop because it=
=20
differs from what Calpine proposed in November.=20
The agreement approved by the council calls for increased monitoring of air=
=20
pollution, the use of treated wastewater to cool the plant, which will redu=
ce=20
discharges into San Francisco Bay, and a $6.5 million "community benefits"=
=20
package, with the bulk going toward parkland acquisition, Gonzales said.=20
"This council has not changed its decision," he said. "What we've done is=
=20
change the facility."=20
Critics, incensed that the city was buckling to outside pressure, vowed to=
=20
change the council at the next election.=20
CONCERNS OVER HEALTH RISKS
They raised concerns that boiled wastewater steam wafting over their homes=
=20
from Calpine's plant could pose health risks. Jona Denz-Hamilton said more=
=20
controls are needed to ensure the safety of neighbors like herself and her=
=20
family and argued that new, cleaner-burning technologies should be installe=
d=20
at the plant.=20
"It's too great of a risk," she said.=20
Other critics said the state's energy woes will be solved and largely=20
forgotten by the time the plant opens in two years, while the Santa Teresa=
=20
neighborhood will be stuck with pollution for decades.=20
Approval seemed a given at the start of the more than three-hour hearing.=

Los Angeles -- These are flush times for the city's Department of Water and=
=20
Power and the energy executives are loving every minute of it.=20
As are their customers.=20
Private power companies throughout California have been raising rates and=
=20
warning customers about a long, hot summer filled with blackouts, but the=
=20
city- owned DWP has been keeping prices stable and the lights on for 1.2=20
million Los Angeles customers.=20
"Our customers are being really nice to us," said Angelina Galiteva, the=20
utility's strategic planning director. "They love the DWP."=20
Although Gov. Gray Davis' administration announced that the state had reduc=
ed=20
its energy consumption 11 percent from a year ago, those in Los Angeles had=
=20
cut back less than half that -- and polls show they view the energy situati=
on=20
less seriously than other Californians.=20
Public utilities such as Los Angeles water and power have seen their revenu=
es=20
increase during the energy crunch because they can sell their excess power =
at=20
higher prices than ever before in a market tilted toward sellers.=20
The rest of the state doesn't always feel that same warm glow. Davis has=20
accused the DWP and other California public utilities of putting exorbitant=
=20
price tags on the excess electricity they sell to the rest of the energy-=
=20
starved state.=20
It's a charge Los Angeles utility executives deny, arguing that their exces=
s=20
power is sold at cost plus 15 percent, which they say is a fair return for=
=20
their customers.=20
"Without our support, a million more homes (elsewhere in California) would=
=20
have suffered rolling blackouts, which is a powerful message," Galiteva sai=
d.=20
It wasn't supposed to be this way. When the power industry was deregulated =
in=20
the late '90s, energy giants like Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern=
=20
California Edison were expected to be the big winners. Now, PG&E is in=20
bankruptcy and Edison is a short step away.=20
"When deregulation came, the experts said that the investor-owned utilities=
=20
would become lean, mean machines that would be better able to operate in th=
e=20
new environment," Galiteva said. "But now public power has shown it can ser=
ve=20
customers more efficiently at lower rates."=20
While much of the state worries about electrical supply, Los Angeles=20
residents have been saved many of those concerns.=20
In a survey done last month by the Public Policy Institute of California, 4=
8=20
percent of the people in the Bay Area thought that electricity cost and=20
availability were the most important issues facing the state. In Los Angele=
s,=20
however, only 33 percent put the energy crunch on top. When questioned abou=
t=20
the size of the power problem and the effect it would have on the state's=
=20
economy, Los Angeles residents were consistently less concerned than people=
=20
elsewhere in California.=20
People in Los Angeles have been "somewhat isolated" from the energy crisis,=
=20
concluded Mark Baldassare, who conducted the survey.=20
That doesn't mean the state's energy problems haven't had an effect. The DW=
P=20
has seen a 3 percent to 5 percent reduction in some uses, which officials=
=20
have dubbed "sympathy conservation." The utility also is offering its bigge=
st=20
customers financial incentives to cut back on their power use.=20
"Our average annual load growth is about 80 megawatts," Galiteva said. "By=
=20
this summer, we expect to have saved 40 megawatts through conservation. By=
=20
December, we expect 60 megawatts in savings."=20
The utility also is making a major attempt to create a conservation ethic=
=20
among its customers. DWP's comfortable situation has made it possible to=20
offer them the carrot without the need to show them the stick.=20
"Conservation no longer means doing without," Galiteva said. "Beer can be=
=20
just as cold with a superefficient refrigerator. Rooms can be just as brigh=
t=20
with superefficient light bulbs."=20
A "Green Power" program also is promoting the use of renewable energy=20
resources such as solar, wind and hydroelectric power. About 75,000 custome=

are paying an extra $3 per month to increase DWP's use of renewable power=

"We're trying to give our customers a choice and a voice in determining the=

As the San Jose City Council approached its 10-1 vote Tuesday to give an=20

Linda LeZotte perhaps captured the body's mood best.=20
``I'm holding my nose to vote for this thing,'' she said. ``Without faultin=
g=20
the mayor or his staff, quite frankly I think this deal stinks.''=20
Caught in what some members called a bind beyond their control, the council=

gave preliminary approval to an agreement negotiated by Mayor Ron Gonzales=

and Calpine on the company's proposed 600-megawatt Metcalf Energy Center.=
=20
Councilman Forrest Williams, who represents the Santa Teresa neighborhood=
=20
near the site, cast the lone vote against the deal.=20
The agreement is scheduled to come back before the council for a final vote=

on June 26, but Tuesday's vote effectively shifts the battle to the courts,=
=20
where residents are expected to lodge a lawsuit in one final attempt to blo=

the plant.=20
Still, Councilwoman Pat Dando and some of her colleagues raised questions=
=20
about the deal they said they want answered before the final vote. Their=20
issues could be incorporated into the final deal.=20
Many of the concerns focused on a $50 million recycled water pipeline=20
Gonzales agreed to have the city build to accommodate the project, $10=20
million of which would be reimbursed by Calpine over 30 years.=20
Pipeline possibility=20
Dando said that a private company, Great Oaks Water, may be willing to buil=
d=20
the pipeline extension itself, saving the city the $50 million expense.=20
Officials at Great Oaks were unavailable Tuesday.=20
Council members peppered staff with other questions. Many were alarmed by=
=20
claims of the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition, which said that using treate=
d=20
sewage water to cool the power plant could allow dangerous chemicals to see=
p=20
into drinking water aquifers. An environmental services director said the=
=20
recycled water meets federal specifications, but that there is no protocol=
=20
for testing other chemicals not included in those standards.=20
Councilman Ken Yeager asked why Calpine should be allowed to spread a $3.9=
=20
million water connection fee over 10 years -- an arrangement that would=20
mandate an amendment to city law.=20
LeZotte, meanwhile, said she wants to hold Calpine accountable to install=
=20
ammonia-free technology at the plant. Ammonia is highly hazardous, and=20
residents say the use of the chemical to clean the plant is among their chi=
ef=20
concerns.=20
The agreement requires the company to install technology to reduce or=20
eliminate the use ammonia when it becomes ``technologically and economicall=
y=20
feasible.'' LeZotte said she wants a clear definition of ``feasible''=20
included in the deal.=20
Tuesday's vote marked a stark departure from the council's November vote to=

President George W. Bush's energy package encourages the use of biomass fue=
ls=20
for both transportation purposes and electricity generation. "They can=20
provide a reliable source of energy at a stable price, and they can also=20
generate income for farmers, landowners and others who harness them," his=
=20
administration's report said.=20

Despite this warm and fuzzy language, however, the administration offered n=

tangible funding for the fledgling biofuels industry=01*other than an exten=

of an existing ethanol tax credit that was not due to expire until 2007=01*=
a=20
significant disappointment, and surprise, to advocates of renewable=20
transportation fuels.

The report did recommend expanding tax credits for biomass energy projects =
to=20
include forest-related and agriculture fuel sources and threw its weighty=
=20
support at a new credit for electricity produced from biomass co-fired with=
=20
coal. These recommendations are already included in the president's 2002=20
budget.=20

"We are pleased that the administration included expansion of the biomass t=
ax=20
credit and hope that, with congressional leadership, we will see this=20
expanded provision signed into law this year," said Katherine Hamilton,=20
co-director of the American Bioenergy Association (ABA).=20

Unlike other portions of the recommended energy policy, biomass energy=20
probably will not suffer under the recent change in Senate composition, giv=
en=20
Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle's (D-S.D.) agricultural constituency and=
=20
his previous support of the biofuels industry.=20

According to the National Energy Policy Development report, biomass account=
s=20
for about 76% of non-hydropower renewable electricity generation,=20
representing a total of about 1.6% of total U.S. electricity supply.=20

Biopower advocates, however, envision an even greater market penetration in=
=20
the coming decades and point to its environmental and ancillary advantages.=
=20
For example, given that biomass combustion can be carbon dioxide-neutral (i=
f=20
the growth and use cycle is managed sustainably), environmental groups=20
support an expanded role. Farmers with marginal lands that could grow bioma=
ss=20
fuel could enjoy economic benefits. With large amounts of wood residue, the=
=20
forest industry also stands to benefit from wider use of wood as a power=20
source.=20


Renewable energy offers a particular advantage to the lumber and paper=20
industry, and many analysts project that the industry may soon become a net=
=20
seller of electricity.=20

"In the lumber and paper industries, wood scraps are sometimes directly fed=
=20
into boilers to produce steam for their manufacturing processes or to heat=
=20
their buildings. For that reason, renewable energy offers a particular=20
advantage to the lumber and paper industry, and many analysts project that=
=20
the industry may soon become a net seller of electricity," said the energy=
=20
policy report.=20

Co-firing with coal
Biomass=01*usually wood or wood residue=01*has traditionally been burned di=
rectly=20
in the industrial sector for heat or on-site electricity generation.=20
According to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the existing 10 GW of=20
installed capacity are based on this direct-combustion technology.=20

For utilities and power-generating companies with coal-fired capacity,=20
however, biomass co-firing may represent one of the least-cost renewable=20
energy options, said the DOE. The process involves blending different=20
materials in varying amounts with coal.=20

Not only does mixing biomass with coal reduce emissions, it is likely to be=
=20
cost-effective. Southern Co. estimates that a biomass plant alone could=20
generate power, depending on its location, at 4 to 11 cents/kWh. Given that=
=20
the lower range of this corresponds to coal generation costs, there are=20
clearly circumstances where biomass-coal co-firing would be economically=20
attractive today. Plus, the environmental public relations benefit for=20
utilities with coal-fired capacity would be valuable.=20


Domestic biomass generation capacity could reach 20-30 GW by the year 2020 =
by=20

According to a recent report prepared by five National Laboratories, domest=
ic=20
biomass generation capacity could reach 20-30 GW by the year 2020 by=20
co-firing at existing U.S. coal-fired power plants.=20

A recent report by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel for Climate=
=20
Change (IPCC) also cites the potential of coal co-firing with biomass. The=
=20
IPCC report concludes that co-firing in coal boilers results in the lowest=
=20
cost and least technical risk of the examined approaches for biomass=20
conversion to electricity.=20

Working out the technical kinks
Already, said the DOE, six power plants in the U.S. are currently co-firing=
=20
coal and wood residue products on a regular basis. Another 10 plants have=
=20
successfully tested co-firing over the last decade, and at least six more=
=20
plants are now conducting or planning tests.=20

For example, Southern Co. is working with DOE, the Southern Research=20
Institute and the Electric Power Research Institute to study ways to grow a=
nd=20
harvest switchgrass to blend with coal as a fuel for power generation.=20
Ideally suited for the southeastern U.S., switchgrass is a rugged grass tha=
t=20
can be grown on marginal agricultural land. Reaching heights of up to 12=20
feet, it requires little fertilization and herbicide and can be harvested=
=20
twice a year.=20

Harvesting methods, co-milling of switchgrass and pulverized coal,=20
pilot-scale co-firing tests, and a full-scale demonstration of co-firing at=
=20
Alabama Power Co.'s Plant Gadsden are part of Southern Co.'s collaborative=
=20
project.=20

The U.S. Agriculture Department is also taking a role in exploring the=20
potential of biomass and coal co-firing as a means to give farmers new=20
markets, especially for currently idle land. The agency recently authorized=
=20
funding for three co-firing demonstration projects.=20

In Iowa, the Chariton Valley Biomass Project is a cooperative effort to=20
develop warm and cool season grasses (such as switchgrass) to co-fire with=
=20
coal at Alliant Energy's Ottumwa Generating Station. The project is designe=
d=20
to generate a sustained supply of 35 MW of biomass energy. Eventually, the=
=20
grass could substitute for as much as 5% of the coal currently burned at th=
e=20
plant.=20


In addition to reducing coal emissions, the Chariton Valley Biomass Project=
=20
will support the local farm economy.=20

In addition to reducing coal emissions, the project will support the local=
=20
farm economy because the grass and trees will come from acreage taken out o=
f=20
production under the Agriculture Department's Conservation Reserve Program=
=20
(CRP). CRP land is generally marginal land that the government subsidizes=
=20
farmers to leave idle to both prevent erosion and protect commodity prices=
=20
from product surpluses.=20

The Pennsylvania Switchgrass Energy and Conservation Project will produce=
=20
switchgrass on CRP land for sale to a local cooperative's coal-fired=20
fluid-bed combustors.=20

In New York, the Agriculture Department project will fund willow biomass=20
crops and switchgrass on CRP acreage in the central and western part of the=
=20
state. The primary markets for the willow biomass are two coal-burning powe=
r=20
plants and a small university central heating facility.=20

Land conflicts, transportation may be obstacles
As these pilot projects illustrate, biomass conversion efforts may have the=
=20
most significant potential in rural areas. "Since biomass is widely=20
distributed it has good potential to provide rural areas with a renewable=
=20
source of energy. The challenge is to provide =01( conversion and delivery =
of=20
bioenergy to the marketplace in the form of modern and competitive energy=
=20
sources," said the IPCC report.=20

A potential drawback to co-firing is transportation. Transportation of=20
wood-based energy products is more costly, per unit of energy, than coal, f=
or=20
example, and most analysts believe it will prove most economical to site=20
generation plants near biomass sources.=20

"The generating plant or biorefinery must be located near to the resource t=

the report's authors, economies of scale may be significant enough to offse=

the transport costs involved.=20

A potential drawback over the long term, however, for biomass conversion is=
=20
land use conflicts. The IPCC report notes that by 2100, the global land=20
requirement to feed the growing world population will increase substantiall=
y.=20
"Up until this time there may well be sufficient land to supply all demands=

for food, fibre and energy, but at some stage after that, land-use conflict=

could arise and before that, competition for water and irrigation may be a=

constraint."=20

Just a short note.  Below, Philip Davies reports on his conversation with the 
head of energy balancing at the Polish grid company.  While this is only one 
person's view, it should be an informed view.  And that view is that a 
balancing market, which should lead to trading, should be in place for 1 
January 2001.  Even discounting for optimism, 1 April does not seem 
unrealistic.  There are still hard issues to be resolved regarding long-term 
PPAs and stranded costs, but given this informed, and bullish, view on when 
we might have a "market" in Poland, I wanted to provide you with this status 
report.   We can now see light at the end of the tunnel.  mcs

Subject: Meeting with Rakowski, PSE

Jarek D., Tomasz and myself met yesterday with Jan Rakowski, PSE Director of 
"System Market Management" (ie, introduction of the balancing and settlement 
rules) and member of the Gielda Supervisory Board.  Highlights:

PSE is ready to begin negotiations on a transmission agreement with Enron.  
We were told to take up the issue with Mr Janiczek - director of Transmission 
Dept.  Rakowski was a bit vague on the nature of the contract (eg, OH or OHT) 
and timing but let's see how far and how quickly we progress with Janiczek.  
(Following the entry into force of the interconnection ordinance on 27 
October, we do have a right to such an agreement under conditions set out in 
the ordinance).
Rakowski asked us to send an application to be included in PSE's balancing 
market rollout programme.  They will give us a specific code number and 
include us in test programmes and balancing market implementation 
developments.
Rakowski characterised the Polish market as reaching "the point of no return" 
as of 1 January.  Certain key changes are introduced as of this date, notably:
 (i) distribution companies will become by definition "active" or "passive" 
participants in the balancing market.  Active will be those that have signed 
up to the new balancing market rules.  Passive  will be those that have not, 
who by default will be charged for their entire consumption at imbalance 
settlement prices (PSE will not recognise contracts notified by distribution 
companies that have  not signed up to the new rules; a few distcos anyway buy 
100% from PSE eg, Slupsk, Czestochowa).
 (ii) he is saying that hourly balancing & settlement will be introduced (in 
terms of the necessary IT being put in place), although at the same time 
hourly data will be for information only at the start.   Settlement will 
remain monthly for some transitional period but not past 1 July.
While he claims he recognises the limitations placed on traders (and the 
market's development) by the ("temporary") "balanced position" requirement on 
OHs, he offered no real justification besides PSE's desire to "control".
General tone was positive, he expressed happiness to meet with supporters of 
competition (in contrast to distco resistance).  But his underlying tone 
implied -as we knew- that PSE intends the transition to move at a pace deemed 
reasonable by PSE, rather than being driven by participants insisting on 
their legal rights or by PSE delivering on its obligations in a timely 
manner.  Thus the need to stay on the case of him and his team as of now.  

Justyna, Tomasz - let's see if we can find more precise details of the 
changes to be introduced on 1 January, try

Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif.) called yesterday for a Justice Department 
review of White House senior advisor Karl Rove's repeated discussions with 
executives and representatives of companies in which he held stock. 
In a letter to White House counsel Alberto R. Gonzales, Waxman said Rove 
appeared to be in violation of federal conflict-of-interest laws.
Gonzales has said he was satisfied that Rove "took care to avoid" any 
impropriety in meeting in March with Intel Corp. executives, and in 
participating in broad discussions about administration energy policy while 
owning more than $100,000 worth of Intel Corp. stock and more than $200,000 
worth of stock in Enron Corp., General Electric Co. and other energy 
companies. On June 7, Rove sold more than $1 million in stock in companies 
doing business with the government. 
Waxman, ranking Democrat on the House Government Reform Committee, said 
federal law requires executive branch departments and agencies, including the 
White House, to report "any information, allegation or complaint" involving 
potential criminal conduct by an employee to the Justice Department. He said 
he was not aware of any reason Rove should be exempt from such outside 
investigation. 
White House spokesman Dan Bartlett said Waxman's letter is under review, but 
added, "We are confident that Karl followed all ethical guidelines and 
statutes in his role as senior adviser to the president."

Business World: How To Execute 10%, Nicely
By Holman W. Jenkins Jr.

07/18/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A19
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

How come Ford adopts the same white-collar performance review system as 
General Electric but gets vilified for it, hounded by discrimination lawyers 
and AARP? Last week, less than a year after launching it, CEO Jacques Nasser 
was moved to dump a brand new executive grading system designed to weed out 
the least capable 10% of Ford's managers. 
The short answer is that Ford isn't GE, though Jack Welch has been a model 
for what Mr. Nasser seeks to accomplish at the auto company.
Bringing such a Torquemada system into a firm that faces slowing sales and 
whose own boss considers his colleagues notoriously flabby and easy on 
themselves meant it was a downsizing scheme from the start, whether 
advertised that way or not. GE didn't introduce its version until a decade 
after the Neutron Jack phase. But never mind. Trumpeting a win last week, 
AARP declared its victory goes way beyond Ford. It sure does. 
Forced ranking has waxed and waned as a fad over the decades, and most 
students of management hold their noses around it. Its resurgence, at a time 
when many employers are contemplating their first layoffs in years, can only 
mean that companies are nervous about preserving their freedom to hire and 
fire in a world run increasingly by the job-discrimination bar. 
Ask any non-deluded European. What makes the U.S. economy relatively nimble 
is that companies are not afraid to take on workers because they know they 
can always get rid of them later. Harsh as this sounds, it's why we have a 
lush job market compared to the employment Saharas of the Old World. 
Yet firing in America has been a work in progress. Half a decade ago, 
enlightened companies tried employee buyouts, but the lawyers descended, 
forcing companies to offer the buyouts indiscriminately. Result: Highly 
marketable workers took the windfall and immediately found other jobs, while 
people who considered themselves unemployable skipped the loot and clung to 
their cubicles. 
Other companies, on the theory that it was OK to tell people they had to go 
because their functions or departments were being discontinued, bravely 
downsized the old-fashioned way. But this was no proof against lawsuits. 
Remember Texaco, Coca-Cola and others where the very existence of 
affirmative-action programs became fodder for litigation by both minorities 
and older white employees? 
Searching for a way out of the legal maze, Ford tried two years ago to 
combine forced ranking with buyouts, aiming offers exclusively at low-ranked 
employees. Result: grumbling in the hallways of "rewarding failure" and good 
employees angling for low grades so they could become eligible for a golden 
parachute. Finally, starting this year, Ford opted for an out-and-out forced 
ranking system, which would have given 10% of white-collar employees annually 
a "C" grade that meant either shape up or you're gone next year. 
Microsoft, Lucent, Conoco, Enron and EDS all have used forced ranking to 
maintain or improve the quality of their work forces. While many find the 
idea distasteful or complain it substitutes a yearly spasm for what should be 
a continuous process, at least it solves a real problem. Survey after survey 
finds that even the happiest worker-bees gripe about their employer's 
reluctance to get strict with poor performers. A recent McKinsey poll of 
managers at big companies found that only 16% said their employer could even 
recognize the difference between stars and slackers. 
But Ford was already in the soup over the Explorer/Firestone fiasco. It 
didn't stand a chance when the Detroit papers opened a new front over its 
A-B-C grading system for 18,000 managers. Accentuating the coverage was a 
simmering quest to discover any sort of rift between Mr. Nasser and his 
chairman, Bill Ford, great-grandson of the founder. 
Mr. Ford has somehow been anointed keeper of the company's conscience because 
of blood chemistry or something. Inevitably, he wants to be liked and wants 
the company to be liked. Putting a Ford in the chairmanship was probably the 
worst thing the company could have done at a time when Mr. Nasser was clearly 
set on giving the place a kick in the pants. 
In the ranking controversy, Mr. Ford soon was reported to be "concerned about 
the system's impact on morale." Notice how this differs from "the system is 
an urgent necessity so Ford can become a better company." With this kind of 
support, management quickly wilted in the face of pressure from the old-folks 
lobby (which has appointed itself guardian of anybody over 45) and other 
victim contingents. 
Mr. Nasser didn't help himself by appearing in a Ford diversity video 
haranguing an audience for containing "too many white faces" or by installing 
rewards for executives who meet minority hiring goals. Presto, lawsuits 
galore. The ones Ford will have the most trouble with are those filed by 
white males claiming they were victims of age discrimination in order to make 
way for blacks and women. 
One of the ironies, as Ford shows, is that companies these days have reasons 
of their own for recruiting minorities and women. Were the supposedly 
archaic, 19th-century principle of freedom of contract still in effect -- 
i.e., employers are free to hire and fire at will -- there would be a lot 
more affirmative action, a lot more honestly pursued. 
GE may not exactly be the rainbow coalition, but it does have a lesson for 
Ford. Under its version of forced rankings, 10% of managers are assigned to a 
bottom grade each year, which means they're cut off from the rich booty GE 
awards the top 20% and the job security of the workaday 70%. If low-ranked 
managers don't improve, they are asked to move on. 
A big difference, though, is that the process is not concentrated in a 
single, highly neuroticized annual ritual. GE carries on with much year-round 
mentoring and bellowing and measuring, so nobody has cause to be surprised by 
the score he gets. In fact, anyone who went to work there in the past 15 
years would have known exactly what he was getting into. 
Here's the lesson: Nobody doubts that GE's hiring and firing, whatever the 
color or gender of the fodder, is all about business. It takes time to build 
a reputation for heartlessly focusing on the bottom line, but once you do, it 
can be liberating.

RUSSIA: INTERVIEW-Russian Tyumen Oil says foreign ties to grow.
By Sujata Rao

07/18/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

MOSCOW, July 17 (Reuters) - Russia's Tyumen Oil Company said on Wednesday it 
planned huge expansion of its upstream and downstream profile through 
ventures with foreign oil majors. Company President Simon Kukes told Reuters 
in an interview that Tyumen - Russia's fourth-largest oil producer with 
output of 800,000 barrels per day (bpd) - would also seek a New York Stock 
Exchange listing in 2002 after market conditions improved. 
"We aim to be a multi-national company and the first step is in Ukraine, 
where we will within a year be the number one retailer of oil products," he 
said.
Kukes said Tyumen was also interested in Eastern Europe and in talks on 
projects that a included a stake in Lithuania's Mazeikiu refinery , but he 
declined to elaborate. 
"Eastern Europe has logistical advantages for Russian firms. We can bring in 
oil easily and get a significant market share. I also see a role for us in 
China, India and the Middle East." He said Tyumen, controlled by Russia's 
Alfa conglomerate, saw foreign oil majors' involvement as a key to its 
growth. 
"We would welcome a strategic partner to take a stake in the firm and, in 
fact, we are now in talks with several foreign partners, including Texaco ," 
Kukes said. 
He added earlier talks with Phillips had had no result. 
Tyumen is involved in the $11 billion Kovykta project with BP and several 
Russian firms to produce and ship gas to China, as well as in Transneft's 
Adria pipeline project to link outlets for Russian crude in north and south 
Europe. 
In August Tyumen will take a key downstream step. 
With Texaco in Moscow it will open Russia's first Star Mart convenience store 
in a partnership expanding its 800-strong filling network by combining them 
with the U.S. Star Mart brand. 
Earlier this year the firms inked a deal to jointly produce lubricants at 
Tyumen's LINOS refinery in Ukraine. Kukes said total investments in 2001 are 
planned at $800 million, with another $1 billion earmarked for each of the 
coming years. 
Tyumen also got a boost by being rated the World's Best Oil Company in 2000 
by Financial Times Energy for "phenomenal growth in the past year, breaking 
into the world's top 15 oil firms." 
"By year end, we could jump from fourth to third place among Russian oil 
producers," said the U.S.-educated Kukes, who is part of Tyumen's efforts to 
boost its profile internationally. 
VERTICALLY INTEGRATED 
Tyumen is now eyeing natural gas, angling to up its Kovykta stake and in 
Rospan, with 600 billion cubic metres in reserves. 
Kukes sees gas as part of a strategy to develop Tyumen on the lines of Enron 
- producing crude, gas and power. 
"Gas is an essential component of a vertically-integrated oil company and in 
the way we see ourselves in future," Kukes said. "We aim that in five years, 
10-15 percent of our revenues will come from gas and condensate." 
But aggressive expansion has brought Tyumen into conflict with competitors. 
It has locked horns with arch-rival Interros to wrest control over a stake in 
Kovykta, and its role in oil firm Sidanco - where BP owns 10 percent - has 
been criticised. 
"We'd like to get at least 25 percent in Kovykta," Kukes said, noting Tyumen 
was keen for BP, which has a 31 percent stake, to remain project leader. 
Tyumen also angered influential gas trader Itera by trying to obtain control 
over its bankrupt gas producer, Rospan. 
"Rospan is a profitable firm but for some reason was losing money," Kukes 
said, adding Tyumen would turn the company around.

COMMODITIES & AGRICULTURE - Enron Metals to pay fine to LME.
By ADRIENNE ROBERTS.

07/18/2001
Financial Times
(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved

Enron Metals Limited - formerly MG - has agreed to pay a #190,000 fine to the 
London Metal Exchange after EML's systems and procedures for ensuring 
compliance with the exchange's rules were found to be "seriously inadequate". 
With the exception of hefty fines imposed after the Sumitomo copper scandal, 
this is the largest sum an LME member has yet paid. Fines for procedural 
shortcomings over the past four years have been between #20,000 and #90,000.
EML is charged with "persistently" failing to ensure warrants needed to 
settle exchange contracts reached the London Clearing House by the required 
time. This happened between August 1999 and February this year. 
The LME said EML's actions had jeopardised confidence in the exchange's 
delivery mechanism, a key aspect of its business. 
The exchange also found that between May 2000 and February 2001 EML 
repeatedly failed to enter trades into the exchange's matching system 
correctly. 
In both cases "EML frequently provided explanations that were either 
inadequate to explain the particular incident, or inadequate to explain the 
persistence of that type of incident", said the LME. 
Enron Metals, formed after Enron's purchase of UK metals trader MG last June, 
said the disciplinary charges related to "operating procedures during a 
period prior to, and the first months immediately following, Enron's 
acquisition of MG". 
The company added that Enron had now "implemented a series of measures to 
tighten up existing procedures and ensure that the operating systems meet 
with Enron's high standards".

City - Exchange fines Enron metals group #190,000.

07/18/2001
The Daily Telegraph
P35
(c) Telegraph Group Limited, London, 2001

THE London Metal Exchange (LME) has fined Enron Metals #190,000 for breaching 
its compliance regulations. 
The exchange said Enron Metals, a subsidiary of the American-owned energy 
giant, failed to meet deadlines for delivering warrants needed to settle its 
metals exchange contracts.
Warrants denote the ownership of LME-registered metal stored in warehouses. 
The group also failed to input trades into the LME's system, the exchange 
said. 
Enron stated that the charges related to its recently-acquired MG metals 
trading division before and immediately after the purchase. The group has 
since "tightened up existing procedures", it said.

Exxon Mobil, U.A.E. Min Discuss Dolphin Gas Proj - Report

07/18/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

DUBAI -(Dow Jones)- Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) is interested in participating in 
the $4 billion Dolphin Gas project, a plan between the UAE Offsets Group and 
Qatar Petroleum to transport natural gas from Qatar to Abu Dhabi and Dubai, 
the official Emirates News Agency, or WAM, reported Wednesday. 
An Exxon Mobil official and the U.A.E.'s Foreign Minister, Sheikh Hamdan bin 
Zayed al-Nahyan, discussed the issue Wednesday, WAM said.
The Dolphin project aims to transport two billion cubic feet a day of natural 
gas from Qatar's offshore North Field to the U.A.E. 
In May, Enron Corp. (ENE) sold its 24.5% stake in Dolphin back to Offsets, 
freeing up its share for another potential strategic partner. Enron's role 
would have been to focus on the midstream part of the project, or gas 
transportation, which requires building a 350-kilometer pipeline from a 
processing plant in Ras Laffan, Qatar, to the Taweelah terminal in Abu Dhabi 
and Jebel Ali terminal in Dubai. 
TotalFinaElf SA (TOT) is Offsets' other strategic partner, holding a 24.5% 
stake in the project. The company will operate the upstream phase of the 
project, which includes developing natural gas reserves in two blocks of the 
North Field. 
The first wells are scheduled to be drilled in the second half of 2001 and 
come onstream in 2004. 
Since Enron's withdrawal, Offsets has said it is talking to a handful of 
international oil companies about potential participation. 
Qatar Petroleum and Dolphin signed an initial agreement for the upstream 
section of the project in March. A full production sharing agreement is due 
to be signed in September. 
In the short term, it is expected the gas will be supplied to Dolphin by 
Mobil Oil Qatar's Enhanced Gas Utilization Project at the North Field.

Business
Bush switch on conservation saves credibility
David Greising

07/18/2001
Chicago Tribune
North Sports Final ; N
1
(Copyright 2001 by the Chicago Tribune)

Too bad we can't all be vice president. If we could, this whole "energy 
crisis" thing would be no big deal. 
We could send our heating bill to the Navy as Dick Cheney has. Who knows, 
maybe we could fuel up our cars and let the Energy Department pay the bill.
Cheney is making quite a shift from the advice he offered to consumers just a 
few weeks ago. "If you want to leave all the lights on in your house, you 
can," he counseled. "There's no law against it. But you will pay for it." 
Or, in Cheney's case, the Navy may pay for it. After all, it owns his house. 
The Vice President decided to dun the Navy on the very day administration 
officials spread out to promote conservation as a key part of President 
Bush's energy plan. 
My, how the scene has changed. In mid-May President Bush unveiled a 
Cheney-authored energy plan that promoted drilling and nuking and mining but 
overlooked conserving. That's when the vice president dismissed conservation 
as a "personal virtue" but no energy policy. 
The 170-page Bush policy did speak ominously of a growing "energy crisis." 
At the time, gasoline seemed headed to $3 a gallon. Rolling blackouts 
interrupted California's power. Winter natural gas prices had spiked. 
Bush seemed confident he could push his energy policy through a House and 
Senate dominated by Republicans. 
Today, with gasoline prices down around $1.35 a gallon and the Senate under 
Democratic control, Bush will have to give up on pet dreams like drilling for 
liquid gold in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. 
Conservation is all the talk--even from administration officials who can't 
talk. 
A laryngitis-stricken Cheney on Monday turned to wife Lynne to declare, 
"Conservation is a must." 
On Monday, the Energy Department declared that federal agencies since 1980 
have cut their energy consumption in buildings by 30 percent. 
So the world has completely changed, right? 
Conservation now will become a centerpiece of the Bush energy policy. The 
caribou and moose and grizzlies in Alaska can sleep easy knowing their 
pristine habitat will be forever free and clear. 
Isn't it obvious that President Bush's supporters at Enron and Texaco and 
other oil giants should get into a more promising line of business? 
And maybe the alternative-energy researchers at Argonne National Laboratory 
can stop studying super-conductivity and new-age fuel cells. Energy Secretary 
Spencer Abraham told them Monday that consumer conservation can cut the 
energy deficit by 60 percent over the next 20 years. 
Perhaps it's time to turn that big super-conducting super collider into the 
world's largest Roller Derby track. 
Well, maybe not. 
The easing of the trumped up "energy crisis" is good news. And not just 
because it won't cost nearly as much to drive to the Dells for summer 
vacation. 
It's good because it seems likely to bring some balance into whatever energy 
policy ultimately emerges from Congress sometime later this year. 
The Bush plan hasn't changed. There still are only a tiny $10 billion of 
conservation measures--half of them already in place--in the gargantuan 
energy program. 
But the political and market realities have changed. Energy costs are down. 
And conservation suddenly seems likely to get a fair hearing in Congress and 
at the White House. 
Perhaps most important, the free market has shown an ability to respond to a 
so-called "crisis" in energy. This reduces the political pressure for a quick 
and ill-advised political fix. 
A sudden jump in electric-plant construction means supply should grow twice 
as fast as demand over the next several years, according to the North 
American Electric Reliability Council. More than 1,000 natural gas wells are 
in production, double the number during early 2000. 
Gas prices are lower than had been expected because OPEC has stopped cutting 
production and oil giants jumped at the first sight of high prices, and 
production is jumping. 
We can't all turn to the Navy to bail us out of high energy prices. But in a 
fix, the free market does nearly as well.

COMPANIES & FINANCE INTERNATIONAL - Energy trading unit fuels 27% leap in 
Duke earnings.
By JULIE EARLE.

07/18/2001
Financial Times
(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved

Duke Energy, the US energy company, yesterday posted a 27 per cent leap in 
second quarter earnings, underpinned by strong growth at its North American 
natural gas and electricity trading business. 
Duke, a large utility owner in the US, said after the market closed that it 
earned $419m, or 53 cents a share, compared with $329m, or 44 cents a share, 
in the year-ago quarter.
Revenues for the quarter increased 43 per cent to $15.6bn, from $10.9bn a 
year earlier. 
The result met Wall Street estimates of 49 to 58 cents a share. The 
Charlotte-based company is one of several in the US accused of manipulating 
electricity prices in California, along with its competitors Reliant Energy, 
Dynergy, Williams and Enron. 
California's grid managers have accused wholesalers of overcharging the state 
by more than $6bn since last May - allegations the companies have denied. 
Last night, a Duke Energy spokesman said that California remained a small 
piece of the company's whole. 
He said the result was driven by strong growth in its North American energy 
trading segment, which reported earnings before interest and tax of $251m, a 
128 per cent increase on the year-ago quarter. 
The unit's growth was fuelled by big expansion in its wholesale energy asset 
portfolio, which now has more than 12,600MW of merchant power generation in 
operation or under construction, compared with about 8,400MW net a year ago. 
Duke also has a large electric utilities operation in California. 
The company's shares closed 38 cents higher at $42.03 in New York.

Letters to the Editor: India, Pakistan and the U.S.

07/18/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A19
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Mr. Varadarajan basically asks America to abandon its traditional link to 
Pakistan in favor of India. He overlooks some critical facts. First, it is 
unclear whether India even wants to be closer to the U.S. Throughout the Cold 
War, India was uncomfortably close to the Soviet Union in diplomatic circles, 
whereas Pakistan was a reliable U.S. ally; it was vitally important in 
espionage efforts against the Soviets (Francis Gary Powers departed from 
Pakistan in his ill-fated U-2 and the U.S. conducted major operations there 
in the 1980s) and in offsetting pro-Soviet influence in the region. 
Smearing Pakistan and it current military president with Islamic 
fundamentalism is disingenuous, since the nation is practically secular when 
compared to its neighbors in Iran and Afghanistan. Indeed the deposed 
president's paeans to fundamentalism in response to domestic problems were 
one impetus for the military takeover in the first place. 
Despite talk of reform, India's economy is still generally hostile to foreign 
investment. The most notable business project of the 1990s, Enron's massive 
power facility in Dhabol, has been mired in bureaucracy and contract 
reneging. 
The question of Kashmir is a difficult one, but it is important to keep in 
mind that India has imposed undemocratic rule on a heavily Islamic region. 
Pakistan is still strategically important and is perhaps America's best 
friend in central Asia. It would be laudable for America to have good ties 
with India, but not at the expense of having to turn our back on an ally.

London exchange fines Enron $264,000
The London Metal Exchange said it fined Enron Corp. $264,000 for "seriously 
inadequate" compliance with trading rules that threatened to undermine 
confidence in the largest metals market. 
Houston-based Enron violated exchange rules over an 18-month period through 
late delivery of warrants, documents that confirm the completion of a metals 
sale, the exchange said in a statement. Enron failed to rectify its 
procedures despite repeated warnings, the exchange said. 
Enron's failures to comply "were repeatedly brought to the attention" of the 
company between last May and February of this year, exchange officials said. 
Enron admitted rules breaches in a statement, but said the violations stemmed 
from its acquisition last May of MG, the world's largest copper-trading 
company, for $445 million, which expanded the natural gas and electricity 
trader's metals business.

We face two parallel tracks in the Senate in the coming weeks between now and 
the start of the congressional recess for one week on June 29th.

In the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, we will be facing 
efforts by pro-price caps forces who will use the committee "bully pulpit" to 
pressure FERC into more action.  This effort is led by incoming chairman 
Bingaman with support from Majority Leader Daschle.  They are saying they 
will consider acting on the Feinstein-Smith price cap legislation unless FERC 
takes unspecified additional action by the end of this month.

The new track in the Senate will be in the Governmental Affairs Committee 
chaired by Sen. Lieberman (D-CT).  While this committee does not have the 
legislative jurisdiction over energy that the Energy Committee does in terms 
of moving legislation, the Governmental Affairs Committee has  broad 
oversight and investigatory jurisdiction over all federal agencies, including 
FERC.  New chairman Lieberman held his first press conference as chairman 
today and said addressing high energy prices would be a priority.

In that vein, the committee is expected to hold a hearing on June 13 
featuring some of the economists who wrote a letter in favor of price caps 
last month.  We are checking with the Republican staff to make sure that the 
anti-price cap economists (the majority of the discipline, of course) will 
also testify.  We also brief committee members and staff with our arguments 
against price caps and the latest publicly available market data.  On June 20 
the committee will hold a hearing on whether FERC has properly exercised its 
duties under the Federal Power Act to make sure that wholesale power rates 
are just and reasonable.  We are going to meet with the committee majority 
staff, but we presently expect this hearing to have political witnesses 
(i.e., elected officials, possibly including Gov. Davis).

We must keep in mind that Sen. Feinstein had earlier written to Chairman 
Lieberman asking for a hearing on the California energy situation, including 
relationships between FERC and those it regulates (citing the NY Times 
article involving Enron and Chairman Hebert).  There is at present no 
indicationi that either hearing will address this matter.  We are, as you 
might imagine, paying close attention to this situation.

Over in the House, Energy and Commerce Chairman Tauzin has said he will write 
to FERC asking them to extend the April 26 price mitigation order to the 
entire west and to extend it to 24/7.  He also asks FERC to see if it can 
implement "negawatts" demand reduction administratively.  We are in the 
process of obtaining a copy of the letter, which has not yet been made public.

Also in the House, we expect congressional committees to begin marking up 
portions of the President's energy legislation and related topics as the 
month unfolds.

We had a meeting at Wilmer Cutler's office today to discuss the reply brief 
(due on July 2).  Attached is the first draft of the brief -- a redraft will 
be circulated COB Wednesday which will revise this brief somewhat but not 
significantly.  I will circulate the revised brief once I receive it.  Wilmer 
asks that we get comments back to them by Noon on Friday.  

Lou feels very good about New York being defeated in its petition.  Almost 
all of the intervenor briefs have been against New York, and Lou thinks he 
can almost promise that the Court will not rule in favor of New York.

With regard to Enron's position, Lou feels that we have the upper hand 
legally but he is concerned that our position lacks passion -- a reason why 
the Court should rule against the regulator.  We talked about ways to augment 
the reply brief to show the court why it must overturn FERC on the bundled 
retail transmission issue.  

At the end of the meeting, I asked Lou to give us his best guess at our odds 
of prevailing.  Very informally, and somewhat in jest, Lou gives us a 37.5 
percent chance of winning the bundled transmission argument.  John, another 
attorney at Wilmer working on the brief, gives us a 42 percent chance of 
prevailing.  Although these are non-binding, informal estimates, I thought 
everyone would like to hear the odds our Supreme Court council are giving us.

Please let me know if you have any comments on the brief by noon on Friday.

Thanks 

Sarah

Enron's Skilling to Succeed Lay as Chief Executive Early Next Year

12/13/2000
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -- Enron Corp. named Jeffrey K. Skilling, its current president and 
chief operating officer, to succeed Kenneth L. Lay as chief executive officer 
of the energy giant. 
Mr. Skilling will retain his current posts as president and COO, while Mr. 
Lay will stay on chairman. The change will become effective Feb. 12.
Mr. Skilling, 47 years old, joined Enron (ENE) in 1990 after leading McKinsey 
& Co.'s energy and chemical consulting practices. He became president and COO 
in 1996 and has served on the company's board of directors since then. 
Mr. Skilling has been a major force behind Enron's move into the burgeoning 
commodities-trading business. Started as a traditional gas-pipeline company 
15 years ago, Enron has morphed into the largest trader of natural gas and 
electricity in North America, and a formidable manager of risk in markets for 
an array of products. It has in essence invented markets for trading for such 
nontraditional commodities as unused capacity in fiber-optic 
telecommunications lines and weather derivatives. 
Mr. Lay, 58, became Enron's chairman and CEO in 1986, following the creation 
of the company through the merger of Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth. 
The change comes after Enron Vice Chairman Joseph W. Sutton announced his 
retirement in October to pursue other opportunities. Enron said at the time 
it had no plans to replace him.

HOUSTON, Dec. 13 /PRNewswire/ -- Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE) announced today that 
Jeffrey K. Skilling has been elected chief executive officer, effective as of

Electric Gold Rush Is Zapping California
Michael Davis

KRTBN Knight-Ridder Tribune Business News: Houston Chronicle - Texas
Copyright (C) 2000 KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business News; Source: World 
Reporter (TM)

The crisis in California's power markets could mean a Christmas bonus for 
Houston energy companies selling power in the state. 
The cold weather that has hit Houston and the rest of the nation has put a 
serious strain on electricity supplies throughout the West Coast.
California electricity prices have soared this week after the state removed 
price caps on wholesale energy transactions to attract power into the market. 
Shares of companies with power plants that sell to the California wholesale 
market have risen in response. 
The lifting of the price caps means more power sales for four Houston 
companies that own about 25 percent of the unregulated power generated in 
California. These include Reliant Energy, Dynegy, El Paso Energy Corp. and 
Enron Corp. 
Reliant also owns power plants in Nevada that can sell power into the 
California market to capitalize on the higher prices now that the price cap 
has been lifted. 
Companies such as Reliant and Dynegy got into California buying plants that 
the state's large investor-owned utilities sold to comply with the law to 
deregulate the state's $23 billion electricity market. There have not been 
any power plants built in California in 10 years. 
The lack of additional generating capacity combined with growing demand is 
the most often cited culprit for California's power woes. Add to that are 
poorly written laws that opened the state to competition. 
The current cold snap has made a bad situation worse. 
A key source of backup power, water-generated hydropower from the Northwest, 
is not being sold in California because it is needed at home because of the 
cold weather. 
"We have been saying for months that new generation is needed in California," 
said Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for Reliant Energy, parent of HL&P. 
Reliant, through its unregulated operations, is the third-largest nonutility 
power generator in California. 
Making the situation even worse is a tightening supply of natural gas needed 
to burn in power plants and to heat homes. 
One of the biggest suppliers of natural gas to California is El Paso Energy 
Corp. Its pipeline to California is still operating at less than full 
capacity. The pipeline now moves about 920 million cubic feet of gas per day; 
its capacity is 1.1 billion cubic feet of gas per day. The company is still 
repairing its pipeline that ruptured in a fatal August explosion in New 
Mexico. 
The El Paso system was named before a Senate committee Tuesday as one of the 
main constraints on California's gas market by John Mazur, the acting 
administrator for the Energy Information Administration. 
Mel Scott, a spokesman for El Paso Energy, said the company has been unfairly 
singled out for criticism. He said the lines' customers have found other 
sources to make up for reduced flow of gas from the El Paso line. 
"We have been getting hammered over this, and we are just one of four major 
pipelines that serve California," Scott said. "Our customers are taking 
everything we can deliver; they physically are taking all of the natural gas 
they can." 
Other large pipelines into California are owned by Williams Cos., PG&E Corp. 
and Trans-Western. 
Whoever is to blame, the reality is that spot natural gas prices in 
California have in recent days risen to the unheard-of price of $40 per 
thousand cubic feet. 
While El Paso cannot take advantage of such prices on its pipeline gas -- 
which is sold under long-term contract -- its wholesale trading arm can 
profit from these prices, as can wholesale trading operations at other 
companies. 
Natural gas prices on the futures market, which have been hitting new records 
daily, dropped sharply on Tuesday on forecasts of milder weather next week. 
Natural gas for delivery in January to the Henry Hub closed at $8.14, down 
$1.26 per thousand cubic feet. 
The relatively small decline in futures prices will not spell any relief for 
California, which is using all of the natural gas it can get its hands on. 
California has been struggling to keep up with growing demand for power all 
year. In response to soaring prices when the weather was hot, the California 
Independent System Operator, which oversees operation of the state's power 
grid, began capping prices, first at around $750 per megawatt-hour, which was 
later decreased to $250. 
The cap was lifted earlier this week to try to lure power supplies from other 
states where generators can get a better price for their power. 
The result has been wholesale electricity prices setting daily records on the 
California Power Exchange, the state's main electricity market. The average 
price paid for electricity to be delivered Tuesday was $904 per 
megawatt-hour, up from $612 on Monday. 
Shares of all of the companies that have merchant power plants in California 
rose this week when the price caps were limited. 
The impact of the changing power market in California is much broader than 
just a quarterly increase or share price bump-up, said Bill Hyler, energy 
analyst with CIBC World Markets in New York. 
With the price caps lifted, and plans to shelve an even stricter $150 per 
megawatt-hour cap that was to be implemented in January, companies will have 
more incentive to get into the California market, Hyler said. 
"The ramifications of this go out for years," Hyler said. "The consumer 
groups were looking for $100 price caps, and you can't make money with $8 to 
$10 gas with $100 price caps." 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is expected to weigh in this week on 
the decision to lift the price caps. Hyler said he expects they will support 
the move. 
Removing the price caps will give companies more incentive to consider 
building new California power plants, Hyler said. But it's not a quick fix. 
It takes about two or three years to get a new power plant sited, permitted, 
built and running. 
The long lead time for constructing new plants also means that the tight 
power supply situation in California cannot and will not be solved overnight, 
even when the weather moderates in the spring. 
This is the second time this year that the California markets have gone into 
a tailspin. 
In May, an unusual heat wave pushed temperatures in the San Francisco Bay 
area into triple digits, causing rolling blackouts. That helped power and 
natural gas companies post much improved second-quarter results. 
During the May heat wave, Dynegy's four California plants ran more than they 
did in all of May and June 1999. 
Such results from unregulated power sales continued into the third quarter. 
Reliant's wholesale energy business had third-quarter operating income of 
$319 million, up from $43 million in the same period last year. About $100 
million of that profit came from the California market, Wheatley said. 
Reliant and other power suppliers were able to provide enough power to get 
California through the hottest months of the year. So far, it has only taken 
about four days of severe winter weather to cause the crisis in California.

Dear Steve:

I have given some thought to the ideas you and I discussed regarding a 
website to promote a light-hearted view of some of the more absurd activities 
of the anti-deregulation and monopoly forces in the electricity battle.

I think my White House Writers Group colleague Michael Long would love to 
take this on. ?He has an eclectic background: he spent considerable time as a 
stand-up comedian, then did a tour as the speechwriter for Tennessee senator 
Fred Thompson. ?He recently had a terrific piece in the Weekly Standard 
taking the air out of Herblock, the Washington Post editorial cartoonist.

(His bio is on our website: 
http://www.whwg.com/Firm/WritersBio.cfm?StaffId=19. ) ?

Mike has excellent instincts for and knowledge of free market ideas, and has 
expressed them quite effectively for a number of our clients, including 
high-profile CEOs and a couple of presidential candidates. ?I believe he 
could very quickly get up to speed on your issues and produce the kind of 
humorous stuff you have in mind. ?I would work closely with him to make sure 
we were getting the issues right.

I propose that we begin the effort by letting Michael "loose" on the 
material. ?He could get familiar with the ongoing issues in California and 
elsewhere, then come up with some preliminary material, including a few 
suggestions of how we should format it for a website

If you think he has the hang of it, we could have a longer discussion about 
how to create a permanent website and let Michael regularly write and update 
the material. ?

December is typically a slow month for us and it would be a good time to give 
this a try. ?Let me know what you think. ?I?d be happy to set up a call with 
the three of us.

I enjoyed finally meeting you face to face at Enron and hope we can continue 
to work together.

Best,

Daniel

Transwestern had 11 releases during the period 11/15-12/15/00.  None were 
above max. rate.  All were at max. rate.

El Paso had several dozen releases during this period in the CA zone.  All 
but 5 are listed as straight max rate deals.  Five have a fixed rate which 
are also within +/- 1 cent of the max rate (assumably for surcharge related 
reasons).

Subject: Additional Arguments for Enron's Gas Cap Response



Premise: FERC should investigate the utility decisionmaking that led the 
Califonia market to the point of excess gas demand, rather than rush to 
impose gas price caps.

Utilities had ample opportunity to fill up storage last summer, but most 
likely choose not to for price reasons.

Transwestern had at least a 100 M/D of available capacity to Califonia and to 
the SoCal Needles delivery point through July 2000.  
 
 Avg. Scheduled (compared to 1.1 Bcf/D capacity): April  780 
        May  820
        Jun-Jul  980
        Aug  1050
        Oct-Dec 1080 (essentially full)

During the period April-Jul, TW was able to deliver up to the full 750 M/D at 
Needles, but on many days SoCal gas instituted "windowing," lowering the 
ability to take at Needles to 680-720 M/D.  SoCal's argument was that they 
didn't believe that there was sufficient demand to run at the 750 M/D level 
(even when TW had nominations of 750 M/D).

El Paso was also not full to Califonia until the last month.   At all times 
El Paso  had available capacity at PG&E delivery points.  During the pipeline 
outage El Paso was limited in their ability to fully deliver to the North 
SoCal delivery point.  However, they were not full for deliveries to SoCal at 
the south system delivery point.


2.    Utilities have opposed pipeline expansions to California

Sempra protested Transwestern's 140 M/D Gallup expansion, arguing that there 
is no need for new capacity (CP99-522).

Sempra has also protested Questar's application to convert an oil line to new 
gas pipeline service to California (S. Trails Expansion).

Steve:

 I hope this is not too presumptuous, but I'd like to directly advise you of 
my organization within Corporate HR.

 I am the Senior Director of the Office of Labor and Employment Relations 
(formerly known as the Fair Employment and Labor Practices Group).  I joined 
Enron in February after spending 11 years with MCI WorldCom where I was 
Associate Litigation Counsel in Atlanta representing MCI, and then WorldCom, 
in all of their employment law matters in the Southeast.  Before MCI, I 
practiced labor and employment law with two large law firms, including Vinson 
& Elkins here in Houston.  

 As you will note from the attached org chart, there are seven primary 
functions for which my staff and I am responsible.  In summary fashion, they 
are:

1. Executive Programs (i.e., Impact & Influence, Power of Communication, 
Executive Forums, etc.)

2. Resource Management (i.e, Redeployment, New Hire Orientation)

3. Workforce Development (i.e., diversity efforts such as recruitment, 
training, mentoring, succession planning, etc.)

4. Employee Relations (i.e., EEO charges, internal grievance investigations, 
policy review, advice, etc.)

5. Labor Relations (i.e., union awareness, collective bargaining negotiation, 
M&A advice, etc.)

6. Government Programs (i.e., affirmative action plans, gov't reporting 
requirements, gov't audits, etc.)

7. Employment Law Training (i.e., discrimination, sexual harassment, 
performance management, interviewing skills, etc.  -- all from a risk 
management perspective).

 I hope to be able to spend some time with you filling in the details and 
answering any questions you have.  In the meantime, please let me know if 
there is anything I can provide for you.

Brian

Mark,

Mika Watanabe from my group met with the consulate in Houston a while back. 
The Consul general was undertaking preliminary soundings when they met with 
you in Houston. Mika expressed our in principle interest in sponsoring a 
Japanese cultural event in Houston. The consulate will contact us here in 
Japan when a specific opportunity arises.

kind regards

Steve - where did we ever get to in terms of responding to the Consul General 
about sponsorship?  I came across his name in my files, and just wanted to 
make sure that we had done the courtesy of closing the loop/closing this 
out.   thanks  mcs

Neighbors In a Power Struggle
State, Northwest trade blame for energy woes 
David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer
Wednesday,?December 13, 2000 
,2000 San Francisco Chronicle 
California officials have blamed the state's energy woes in part on the 
Pacific Northwest's not having enough extra power to share. 
But in Oregon and Washington, they're blaming California for not coming 
through on a decades-old bargain to supply much-needed electricity in the 
winter in return for the Northwest's juice in the summer. 
If the current power shortages worsen, consumers throughout the West Coast 
face an increasing likelihood of blackouts. 
Until now, California and the Pacific Northwest have enjoyed a mutually 
beneficial power-sharing arrangement whereby shortfalls in one area are made 
up for by surpluses in the other. 
"We've had a traditional reliance on California in the winter," said Dulcy 
Mahar, a spokeswoman for the Bonneville Power Administration in Portland, 
Ore., 
which sells power produced by federal dams in the region. "Without 
California's electricity, we've had to take some extraordinary steps." 
Chief among those steps is tapping into dam reservoirs that, in a normal 
year, would be used to generate power next summer. 
As a result, the risk is growing day by day that the Northwest will be unable 
to help meet California's surging energy demand in the months ahead, when 
millions of air conditioners are added to the state's already strained 
electricity system. 
"Next summer is going to be twice as bad as last summer," predicted Kellan 
Fluckiger, chief operating officer of the California Independent System 
Operator, which oversees the state's power network. 
"Each summer after that is going to get progressively worse until blackouts 
become a normal part of a hot summer afternoon," he said. 
The ISO called a Stage 2 power emergency at 5:10 p.m. yesterday as reserves 
fell once again to dangerously low levels. Power was cut to some voluntary 
users. 
Meanwhile, federal regulators agreed to consider a request from the 
California Power Exchange, which coordinates the state's wholesale power 
market, to restore price caps for electricity rates. A $250-per-megawatt 
limit was lifted by state officials last week. 
On Monday, wholesale power prices spiked as high as $900 and are expected to 
top $1,000 today. Last year at this time, electricity could be bought by 
utilities such as San Francisco's Pacific Gas & Electric Co. for a mere $45 
per megawatt. 
Against this backdrop, California and Pacific Northwest power agencies are 
scrambling to meet demand as a previously complementary relationship falls 
apart. 
"We never saw such a tight demand-supply situation," said John Harrison, a 
spokesman for the Northwest Power Planning Council, a four-state body charged 
with balancing energy production with environmental concerns. "The timing of 
this really caught us by surprise." 
California and the Northwest recognized years ago that power needs in the two 
regions are completely dissimilar. In California, demand for electricity 
soars in the summer, when all those air conditioners add to the state's 
already considerable energy load. 
In Oregon and Washington, demand climbs in the winter because nearly half of 
all homes are heated with electricity, a reflection of the region's 
historically dirt-cheap power prices. 
More than half of all power in Oregon, Washington, Idaho and western Montana 
comes from dams along the Columbia, Snake and other rivers. These include 28 
federally owned dams from which the Bonneville Power Administration sells 
electricity to customers basically at cost. 
For decades, the arrangement worked fine. California helped heat the 
Northwest in the winter, and the Northwest helped cool California in the 
summer. 
This year, however, everything changed. As California stumbled from one 
crisis to another amid a bungled effort to deregulate the power market, 
demand far outpaced available supply and a threat of blackouts has persisted 
since June. 
The state is now grappling with an unprecedented winter power shortage, 
caused in large part by an unusually high number of plants being down for 
scheduled and unscheduled maintenance or because they have exceeded annual 
pollution limits. 
Whereas California normally would be exporting power to other states at this 
time of year, it is now frantically hunting for out-of-state generators that 
can come through in a pinch. 
And without excess California energy supplies making their way across the 
border, power officials in the Northwest are struggling to find enough juice 
to keep homes warm as temperatures plunge this week about 10 degrees below 
normal. 
An arctic cold snap expected to hit last night will only make matters worse. 
According to official projections, the Northwest will come up short next 
month in meeting its power needs by more than 4,000 megawatts -- roughly the 
amount of electricity required to light up four cities the size of Portland. 
Exacerbating the situation is the fact that the region has faced an unusually 
dry winter so far. This has lowered reservoir levels behind dams and 
indicates a smaller-than-normal snowpack in the mountains, which would affect 
rivers in the spring. 
Mahar also said Bonneville and other power providers already were tapping 
into reservoirs to provide additional power through the winter. Unless the 
rain and snow arrive in full fury next month, Mahar said, this almost 
certainly will reduce the Northwest's ability to help meet California's 
energy needs in the summer. 
"Our reservoirs are like savings accounts," she said. "When we cash them out, 
we don't have enough left in the bank." 
Steve Johnson, executive director of the Washington Public Utility District 
Association, a Seattle trade group representing 28 regional utilities, said 
the shortfall in power from California would force the Northwest to improvise 
for weeks to come. 
"We're trying to buy energy every place we can find it," he said. 
Like many observers north of the border, Johnson is dismayed by California's 
efforts to deregulate the state's electricity market. "We think you made a 
terrible mess of it," he said. 
And now, he pointed out, California's troubles have become a headache for 
other states as well -- with no end to the problem in sight.

		 Subject: URGENT: REQUEST TO PRODUCE AS MUCH POWER AS POSSIBLE

California Senator Feinstein, Governor Davis, Secretary of Energy Richardson, 
and FERC Commissioner Hoecker held a joint press conference related to the 
California energy problem.  They indicated a critical need for supply TODAY 
to serve the California marketplace.  Secretary Richardson indicated he will 
exercise his emergency power under the Federal Power Act [section 202(c)] to 
direct generation to California.  The Secretary indicated that DOE, under the 
FPA, will set a fair price for the power.
 
IEP requests all its members to deliver as much generation as possible to 
California ASAP in order to avert potential shortages.  
 
In addition, the Governor and Senator Feinstein called for regionwide price 
caps and mandatory, reasonable long-term contracts between generators and the 
utilities.  They made the point that 4,000 - 5,000 MWs are being exported 
from the state, currently a lack of adequate planning and scheduling of 
resources/planned outages exists, and indicated that the CPUC would moved to 
implement forward contracting.  
 
IEP will forward the formal statement from the Press Conference (or a 
summary) as soon as available.

With the first round of RTO filings and responses complete, it is a good time 
to step back and review the highs and lows that occurred in 2000 and lay out 
our plan going into 2001. 

A. 2000 Key Facts --

1. FERC CONTINUES TO RELY UPON MONOPOLIES TAKING VOLUNTARY ACTIONS.

It does not appear that FERC (in its current form) will modify its standing 
policy that RTO formation is a voluntary process designed to let 1,000 
flowers bloom.  While Enron continues to ask FERC and FERC staff to take a 
different position, we have seen no signals that anything will change.  Faced 
with this policy, as the initial RTO filings made clear, almost all utilities 
are going to fight pretty hard not to have to give up their strategic 
transmission assets.  Accordingly, most of the proposed RTOs do not remove 
the fundamental problem - the Native Load exception.

2. THE MIDWEST CAN'T MAKE UP ITS MIND ABOUT WHICH RTO IS BEST.

The MISO continues to lose its members to the Alliance RTO.  The three big 
utilities that have declared their intention to switch sides include ComEd, 
IP, and Ameren (probably 40% of total load in initial MISO).   Key problems 
for the MISO include (a) MISO's not-for-profit status (key IP claim), (b) 
parties interest in taking energy east (key ComEd need), and (c) fair 
retention of 3rd party wheeling revenues (Ameren want).    Meetings with 
regional stakeholders (public power, industrials, State PUCs) have been 
productive in terms of getting agreement that one single RTO is the preferred 
option, however we await action from the FERC.  MISO is also telling everyone 
that can listen that if the big three pull out, it probably won't continue.  
While the MISO process is very open to the public (not so with the Alliance 
RTO), neither MISO nor the Alliance RTO have progressed far enough into the 
details to fully determine if our policy objectives will be met.

3. SOUTHERN AND GRID SOUTH DID PRETTY MUCH AS EXPECTED - NOTHING.

Rather than take a major step forward, Southern and Grid South (SCANA, CP&L, 
Duke) have initially filed non-compliant RTOs.  Grid South does nothing to 
advance a market, much less provide transmission service in a 
non-discriminatory fashion.  In fact, Grid South simply takes the current 888 
OATT and "combines" the three utilities for wheeling through purposes.  

4. PJM CONTINUES TO BE FERC'S SHINING LIGHT.

PJM was the only functioning ISO that filed with FERC earlier than was 
necessary (rumor has it that FERC invited PJM to file early to set the "right 
example").  PJM declares itself to be fully in compliance with Order 2000 in 
that filing.  PJM is also expanding.  So far, Allegheny Power and DQE have 
agreed in principle to allow PJM to operate a parallel control area called 
PJM West.  In terms of market coordination, PJM has been publicly reluctant 
to get involved in working to try to integrate the tight Eastern pools (PJM, 
NYISO,  NE-ISO, and Ontario IMO).   The other pools are not getting very much 
accomplished in their efforts.  For example, NE-ISO has indicated that it 
won't have the Day-Ahead market ready until 2003 at the earliest.  

5. ERCOT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL START ITS WHOLESALE MARKET ON TIME.

ERCOT is pressured to initiate its wholesale market by the needs of retail 
access (pilot program beginning next summer).  The rules are still being 
structured.  We are working to ensure that the tight deadlines don't 
overwhelm good market structure.   Robin Kittel and Ron McNamara are leading 
our efforts and are very active.  

6. SURPRISINGLY FLORIDA IS MOVING ALONG

In a surprise move, the actions so far in Grid Florida, while certainly not 
perfect, appear to be moving in the right direction.  The FL PSC has gone 
from saying never to asking FERC for assistance in getting the rules right.  
Governor Bush has set up a task force to study wholesale competition during 
this Legislative session; Enron will be involved.

B. 2001 Steps - 

1. FOCUS THE POLITICOS ON RTOs AND ENDING THE NATIVE LOAD EXCEPTION.

FERC will have new leadership some time in early 2000 (if we can get a 
President).  Enron is developing a coordinated political plan (Capitol Hill, 
media, Administration, industry allies) to impress upon the next 
Administration and FERC Chairperson that mandates are necessary to continue 
to drive wholesale market reforms.  Without a stronger mandate, it may prove 
difficult to have functioning RTOs by the end of 2001.  More importantly, it 
will take specific policy changes at FERC or within the state during retail 
wheeling proceedings to win the Native Load exception fight.  In those RTOs 
that have determined not to agree to ending the Native Load exception, no 
amount of meetings or filings will change the parties.

2. COORDINATE GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS SUPPORT MORE CLOSELY WITH THE DESK.

It is our intention to have a full time person working from the Desk to 
ensure that Enron's objectives are clearly presented to the developing RTOs.  
The goal is to work alongside Christi Nicolay and the commercial teams to 
coordinate day-to-day activities of our RTO staff and make sure that no 
opportunity is missed.  This should ensure that Enron is advocating the needs 
of the commercial teams.   We continue to have at least one person dedicated 
to each RTO market.

NYISO   -  Howard Fromer
NE-ISO  -  Dan Allegretti
IMO   - Aleck Dadson
PJM  - Tom Hoatson
MISO/Alliance - Jeff Brown / Dave Mangskau
Grid South - Tom Chapman / Joe Connor
Southern  - Joe Connor
Florida  - Dan Staines
SPP  - Ron McNamara
ERCOT  - Robin Kittel

Mike Roan from New Zealand will be arriving in early January to help out.  
Luiz Maurer is coming from Brazil in June / July to also work on wholesale 
market issues.

3. PUSH INTEGRATION OF THE TIGHT NORTHEAST POOLS.

NE-ISO and NYISO are required to file their plans for RTO status on January 
15, 2001.  While these pools have signed an MOU to discuss integration 
matters, not much progress has been made to date.  Moving power between the 
pools continues to be difficult given the different protocols and scheduling 
rules.  FERC is aware of these problems.  Again, FERC has not done anything 
to mandate compliance with Order 2000.  We have deployed an additional 
resource in Houston recently to help support Enron's involvement in the tight 
pool seams issues and make sure that the Desk is being made aware of all 
developments as close to real-time as possible.

4. CONTINUE TO FIGHT IN THE TRENCHES.

The list of people above continue to have day to day responsibility for 
ensuring full coverage of all relevant meetings of each RTO.  We continue to 
advocate our agenda (to anyone that will listen).   This work is time 
consuming (much spent listening to "junk" from monopolist Transmission 
Owners) and detailed.  Enron made solid filings in response to the RTOs 
initial work and will continue to respond in a manner that best leverages our 
resources.

5. FIND THE GRID OPERATOR FOR PROJECT e-trans.

Project e-trans has resulted in a new business consortium - 
etransconsortium.com.  This combination of APX, Cal PX, and Alstom ESCA has 
developed the necessary pieces of software and systems to provide the "market 
front-end" for any RTO (e.g., day-ahead market, transmission exchange, 
etc.).  Enron has also finished drafting a detailed tariff that incorporates 
our policy objectives.  We are now turning our attention to finding the right 
Grid Operator.  We are in discussions with National Grid, American 
Transmission Company, MISO, and PJM (although they may want to do something 
very similar).  The goal remains the same -- to have a fully functioning 
entity that can provide turnkey solutions to any Transmission Owner and use 
this entity to leverage FERC to take more dramatic action.  I will be taking 
a larger role in this activity as it moves forward in 2001.

6. DON'T FORGET ABOUT THE NEED FOR MORE RETAIL ACCESS AND GENERATION 
DIVESTITURE

Government Affairs also will continue to attempt to drive additional markets 
through direct access and divestiture.  It will take (1) non-discriminatory 
transmission access, (2) retail choice, and (3) generation divestiture to 
enable a fully thriving wholesale market.  Of course, additional market 
openings face the political questions raised due to the crisis in California.

I hope this helps put some framework around our activities.  If anyone wants 
to discuss this in more detail, I'd be happy to meet individually or as a 
group.

Jim

Steve --  A few months ago, Erin Rice approached me about the idea of 
creating a Chief Morale Officer for Enron, a relatively new concept she had 
read about.   I asked her to write up a position description (attached).  
Last week, Meredith and I attended a media conference in San Francisco with 
all the top new media and traditional business/financial publications, and 
the big story trend is corporate culture and what's new and different at 
companies.  A CMO would give Enron a unique angle to participate in (and 
pitch) culture stories and increase our exposure (and help with recruiting).  
It would also serve an incredible need internally to have an executive who 
was responsive, accessible to employees and had the ability to resolve 
problems.  In looking at the organization, I thought someone like Cindy Olson 
would be perfect for a CMO.  Just wanted to pass along this suggestion to see 
what you thought.

Thanks.

Seab/Sabine,

Sorry for the delay in getting back to you on this important issue.  The 
three rule changes or designs in other markets you describe look very good 
and are right on point.  I would like to add two more to your list, namely: 

1) Price caps in California

Attached is a one page memo from my colleague in California, Jeff Dasovich.  
Consistent with Jeff's first two points, Steve Kean has told me that in 
addition to chasing existing power supplies out of the state, price caps, and 
the uncertainty surrounding them, chase new generation away.  The turbine 
market is a worldwide market.  Firms will have difficulty committing their 
own capital (and borrowing from others) if they propose to put facilities in 
jurisdisctions where rates are capped or pricing is based on something other 
than the operation of the market.  Several generators, including Dynegy and 
Calpine, have said they will look for other homes for the turbines they have 
ordered.  I have a Nov 10, 2000 Megawatt Daily article that quotes Enron and 
Calpine as saying that price caps in California drove both companies to 
withdraw proposed plants.  

I recognize there is presently no price cap proposal in Alberta but I think 
we can draw the connection between interference through caps and interference 
through other forms of administrative intervention that are being considered 
in Alberta such as: 1) price discrimination on imports, or 2) the latest 
proposal I heard today from the Power Pool which is capping import offers 
into the Power Pool at Mid-C prices plus tranmission costs.



2) FERC Staff Report on Midwest that apparently states on pages 2-15 that 
some market participants believe that developers sited new generation in the 
Midwest because there were no price caps (see attached FERC Report).



As we discussed, I will be using this information in upcoming meetings (this 
Friday is the next one) with the Power Pool and the Alberta Gov't in support 
of Enron's arguments that policy makers in Alberta must "stay the course" 
through the higher priced periods, failing which they will make things much 
worse.

In view of the fact it is U.S. Thanksgiving could you please give me a sense 
of Sabine's timing on this.

Regards,

Rob

California warns of possibility of rolling blackouts 
STEVE LAWRENCE, Associated Press Writer
Wednesday,?December 13, 2000 
,2000 Associated Press 
(12-13) 14:50 PST SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- U.S. Energy Secretary Bill 
Richardson ordered Northwest generators to sell electricity to California 
utilities Wednesday after state regulators warned that low power supplies 
could force rolling blackouts. 
The warning came from the Independent System Operator, keeper of California's 
power grid. It said that electricity supplies were so perilously low that it 
might declare a Stage 3 power emergency for only the second time ever. At 
Stage 3, the grid can impose blackouts. 
Richardson said at a Washington, D.C., news conference he was using emergency 
powers to force wholesalers to sell power to California at a price he deemed 
fair. He said he would also request that two large Pacific Northwest power 
generating associations send more power to California. 
``Our objective is to keep the lights on in California through this emergency 
situation,'' he said. ``We're dealing with a potentially very serious 
situation here.'' 
California has been caught in a power crunch over the past several days, in 
part because of cold weather in the Northwest -- where California buys much 
of its power -- and the shutdown of some generating plants for maintenance. 
California's two largest utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern 
California Edison, are near bankruptcy due to skyrocketing wholesale power 
costs, Gov. Gray Davis and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said at a 
Washington, D.C., news conference with Richardson. 
Davis and Feinstein asked federal regulators to set a regional price cap on 
wholesale electricity to prevent the high prices that have plagued 
California. On Friday, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission lifted price 
caps in California. 
Record wholesale power prices followed, and PG&E warned it was in financial 
danger. 
The problem became especially acute when about a dozen suppliers began 
demanding cash before selling power to California, Kellan Fluckiger, the 
ISO's chief operating officer, said Wednesday. 
``The credit limits of utilities and what markets are willing to sell us have 
been reached and surpassed in many cases,'' Fluckiger said. ``There are 
questions about utility solvency. That has come to a head today.'' 
He said officials may have to interrupt power to as many as 4 million 
customers Wednesday afternoon and early evening, when people come home from 
work and power demand hits a peak. 
An unprecedented Stage 3 emergency was issued last Thursday, meaning reserves 
had fallen below 1.5 percent. But the state fended off rolling outages by 
turning off two power-sucking water pumps. 
This time, Fluckiger said any blackouts would probably last about an hour to 
90 minutes and occur mostly in Northern California. 
``It's a fairly bleak picture,'' he said. ``This thing will not change unless 
something is done to alleviate the credit situation.'' 
A Stage 1 alert was declared Wednesday morning, meaning power reserves were 
below 7 percent and all power users are asked to conserve. 
Stage 1 and Stage 2 emergencies, in which power reserves fall below 5 percent 
and large commercial customers can be forced to shut down, have become 
routine this month, but last Thursday's Stage 3 was the only time the threat 
of blackouts loomed. 
Contributing to the problem is a shortage of water to power hydroelectric 
generators in the Northwest and California, Fluckiger said. 
``We have reservoirs so low that we have people standing by them watching the 
situation to make sure it does not go below safe limits,'' he said. 
The power crunch over the past few months has been blamed in part on 
electricity deregulation. California approved a phased-in deregulation of the 
electricity market in 1996 to try to lower prices for consumers through 
competition, but so far it has led to higher energy prices. 
At the same time, wholesale power costs have been soaring, in large part 
because of skyrocketing prices for natural gas. Wall Street is worried about 
utilities' financial health, and on Tuesday, a consumer group urged the state 
to seize and run the strapped $20 billion electricity system.

Subject: Last evening's conversations (CONFIDENTIAL)

Hello everyone:

Last evening there were several receptions in Sacramento which allowed
us to chat with some interesting folks about the energy situation.

Bob Foster said Edison is very close to declaring bankruptcy.  He said
maybe it would be the best thing if the Federal court were involved
anyway because he was not having much influence on policy discussions
and legislative decisions.

An hour and a half discussion with Steve Peace can be summarized as
follows:
    1.  He believes Enron has done a masterful job of manipulating the
market.
    2.  He believes it may not be too late for Enron, specifically Ken
Lay, to use the Federal government to stabilize the market.  Lay's
influence with Bush could set up a system with true competition (perhaps
publicly-owned generation could be a competitor) and fair and just
prices.
    3.  Peace himself will not be a major player in energy solutions.
He'll be in Puerta Vallarta with his wife for half of January to prove
the point.
    4.  He suggests having Jim Brulte, Senate Minority Leader and Bush
campaigner, get involved to promote a proactive solution which includes
Ken Lay and President Bush.  (I'm calling Brulte today to get a
reaction)
    5.  He believes there is a good chance that the Sempra, Edison and
PG&E go into bankruptcy.  Ultimately that would be very bad for Enron
for a variety of reasons which I could not follow and/or retain.

The Director of the Department of Consumer Affairs said her office
received a call yesterday afternoon from the Governor's office directing
them, and all other state agencies, to turn off all computers by 4:00
p.m.  The Governor wanted to light the capitol Xmas tree and was
concerned there would be too much drain on the power system.  He didn't
want to be accused of adding to the electricity shortage, so the trade
off was no state compputers would be used while the tree was lit.  The
tree was turned off after half an hour.  Sandi has this morning's
Sacramento Bee article which described the incident in somewhat
different detail.

Just wanted to pass along a conversation I had recently with a senior 
Treasury Department official about Ken Lay.   My former colleague is 
extremely savvy and a leading  thinker on the financial markets.   He pointed 
out that with Jack Welch's retirement in late 2001 there will be a very large 
void in the corporate community.  Welch, for many years, has been considered 
in the financial markets and public at large, as the preeminent CEO figure in 
corporate America.   He is, in essence, the spokesperson and symbol of this 
community.  With his departure, there will be a process to figure out who 
steps in these shoes, and my Treasury friend believes there are only about a 
handful of CEOs in the running.  He believes Ken is in this group.  You've 
probably thought about this or you may want to put this email in the "for 
what it is worth" pile.  I believe that this is worth further thought.

Electricity prices soar as changes take hold: Tab skyrockets under rule 
easing wholesale controls
By Carrie Peyton
Bee Staff Writer
(Published Dec. 12, 2000) 
Some wholesale electricity prices on California's Power Exchange nearly 
tripled between Friday and Monday and others nearly quadrupled, while 
officials declared another electric emergency. 
In the first full business day under new, sharply disputed trading rules 
aimed at averting blackouts, prices of electricity on the Power Exchange, 
where the bulk of California's electricity is bought and sold, surged far 
above Friday's $250 per megawatt hour. 
The day's first PX auction produced average prices of $904 per megawatt hour, 
and a second auction used to adjust transmission line use produced prices of 
$668. 
One year ago, the average PX price was about $30, Power Exchange spokesman 
Jesus Arredondo said. 
"Prices were crazy yesterday and they're crazier today," Arredondo said. 
"This will be the most expensive month ever in California, I'm sure of it." 
The California Independent System Operator blamed high natural gas costs and 
strong electric demand throughout the West for Monday's price run-up, but 
critics suggested it was early evidence that the new trading rules have 
backfired. 
At the ISO's request, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission late Friday 
gave permission to lift a $250 price cap and replace it with a requirement 
that power sellers who set prices higher than $250 must explain them later. 
The ISO said the changes would improve the grid's stability by attracting 
more power to California, repaying plant owners for high natural gas costs 
and reducing last-minute deals. 
The rules were immediately attacked by Gov. Gray Davis and state regulators, 
who argued that the rules would drive up prices without solving the other 
problems. 
That's just what happened Monday, said Steve Maviglio, spokesman for Davis. 
"Price gouging has reached a new level," he said. "It's not surprising. It's 
exactly what the governor predicted." 
In addition, a "glitch" in the way the ISO and the PX use two-stage 
electricity auctions to ease congestion on transmission lines will 
temporarily spur more last-minute trading instead of less, according to power 
plant owners and the ISO. 
ISO officials, who have long warned that last-minute deals can hurt the 
stability of the electric grid, said the effect will be minimal, but Power 
Exchange officials predict it could be massive. The test will come today. 
In an effort to solve the problem, the PX late Monday asked FERC to make 
another emergency change in trading rules, lifting caps on the second round 
of power auctions, which are used to set "congestion" pricing. 
The PX buys electricity from power plant owners and sells it to buyers, 
almost universally the utilities, which then turn around and supply 
Californians power. The ISO was created to control the transmission grid, but 
it has emerged as the buyer of about one-fourth of California's power when 
stability problems arise, and it then resells that power to utilities. 
Meanwhile, the ISO declared another "stage two" electric emergency Monday 
afternoon -- the 12th since Nov. 1 -- and pleaded for continued conservation. 
Some big power users were told to reduce consumption, although the ISO said 
generally the outlook has improved slightly. 
About 8,700 megawatts of power were off line Monday, compared with a high of 
more than 11,000 last week. A megawatt can supply about 300 to 1,000 
households, depending on season and location. 
The ISO blames the almost unheard of cold-weather emergencies on an unusual 
number of power plants down for repairs and growth in other regions that 
compete with California for electricity. 
"It's a very tough problem right now," ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said. 
"I almost could look back and say summer was fun." 
The governor, PUC president Loretta Lynch, consumer advocates and others 
blame the deregulated electric market for the cold-weather power crunches. 
As that controversy raged on, state officials who are monitoring the 
increasingly chaotic electricity situation began toting up the costs of last 
week's runaway prices. 
On Friday alone, according to the California Electricity Oversight Board, it 
cost $212 million to deliver power through the ISO-controlled grid, which 
serves about three-fourths of the state's electric consumers. 
That would be enough to fully pay for a new, cleaner-burning 500-megawatt 
power plant about every two days. 
Monday's bill won't be fully computed for another few days, but it appears 
that it will be significantly higher, according to the oversight board. 
"We have a huge transfer of wealth going on, and we're not getting anything 
for it," Pacific Gas and Electric Corp. spokesman Gregg Pruett said. 
Meanwhile, financial analysts Monday warned investors that the state's two 
largest utilities are finding it increasingly difficult to bridge the gap 
between frozen rates and power costs that escalate nearly daily. 
Credit rating agency Fitch Inc. on Monday lowered its long-term and 
short-term debt ratings for PG&E and Southern California Edison, as well as 
the latter's parent company, Edison International. Fitch cited "increased 
liquidity pressure" and uncertainty about the utilities' ability to recover 
the costs of their power purchases. 
The rating downgrades mean it will be more expensive for the utilities to 
borrow money in the future. 
Also on Monday, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. and Banc of America 
Securities lowered their ratings on PG&E Corp.'s stock, which fell Monday to 
$21.94 a share, down $1.63, nearly 7 percent. The firm also lowered its 
rating for Edison International, whose stock closed at $18.63 a share, down 
$1.81, nearly 9 percent. 
Moody's Investors Service put the securities of PG&E and its parent PG&E 
Corp. on watch for a downgrade. 
PG&E estimates that at the end of November it had paid out $4.6 billion more 
for power than it has been able to collect, although consumer advocates 
disagree, pointing out that that number is significantly offset by utility 
revenues in other special accounts. 
Before the December run-up in wholesale prices, PG&E had requested a 17.5 
percent rate increase, which state regulators put on hold. Now the rate 
increase needed to cover its costs appears to be increasing daily, Pruett 
said, but he declined to say how much PG&E might seek. 
Although consumer advocates oppose a rate increase, some are beginning to 
talk quietly about increases being inevitable if wholesale prices cannot be 
brought back down. 
"It's not sustainable," said Mike Florio, an attorney for The Utility Reform 
Network and a member of the ISO board. "It has to stop."

HEREWITH A LETTER THAT KEN MIGHT WANT TO SEND TO CALLUM MCCARTHY
Dear Callum,
I much enjoyed chatting with you in Aspen: it is always a relief to meet
a regulator who tries to get the process right, and then lets the chips fall
where they may.
In its efforts to remain open to new ideas, Enron has established an
advisory council consisting of academics, business people, political gurus
and the like (Irwin Stelzer is a member). This council meets twice a year
with Enron executives. Our next meeting is scheduled for October 31 at our
London headquarters ( we have a dinner the previous evening, at which we
review the state of political play around the world; you might find it
interesting).
One of the suggestions at the Aspen meeting was that traditional
regulation of energy markets might usefully give way to, or at least learn
some lessons from, financial regulation. Since you are one of the few
regulators who has had experience both in financial markets and in utility
regulation, we are hoping that you might be willing to share some ideas with
us on this subject. A 30-minute talk followed by what I promise will be a
very lively discussion would be perfect from our point of view.
We know how pressed you are for time, but are hoping you will favor us
with your thoughts on this interesting and difficult subject.
KEN: I don't think you can offer him a fee.

I'm not sure whether we want Hoecker to make the fourth point.  What do 
others think?

We thought it would be good to basically give Chair Hoecker talking points 
with any numbers that Enron provides.  We will visit on these later today 
when the numbers are ready (before 3:00).  Comments?

supposed to be out of here at 2:15 today, so if you have stuff to add after 
that, get it to Christi.  Thanks.

Powergen and LG&E Complete Merger
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Powergen of the United Kingdom and LG&E Energy Corp. of Louisville, Ky.,
have completed their merger and have formally begun joint operations. LG&E
will maintain its headquarters in Louisville, which will serve as the=20
headquarters
for Powergen's North American operations. LG&E Energy's utility subsidiarie=
s,
Louisville Gas & Electric and Kentucky Utilities Company, will continue
as separate subsidiary corporations with joint operations and with=20
headquarters
in Louisville and Lexington, Ky., respectively.

ANALYSIS: Although referred to as a "merger," Powergen actually has acquire=
d
LG&E, a strong utility based in the Midwest that remains focused on all
three core sectors of the electric utility business (generation, transmissi=
on
and distribution). Powergen, which generates about 14 percent of the=20
electricity
used in England and Wales, is a company with clear intentions to expand
internationally. The company currently has electric and gas operations
in Europe, India, Asia and Australia. Together, the Powergen / LG&E=20
combination
reportedly will have assets of nearly $14 billion and total revenues of
$9 billion, serving four million customers worldwide.

The partnership marks the third acquisition of a U.S. electric utility
by a foreign company, following ScottishPower's purchase of PacifiCorp
and National Grid's purchase of the New England Electric System (NEES),
both in 1999. It appears that with each subsequent foreign acquisition
of a U.S. utility, the regulatory hurdles needed to complete the deal have
become easier to pass.

Powergen's reasons for wanting to acquire assets in the United States arise
from needs similar to its U.K. counterparts. In the last ten years that
have elapsed since the privatization and subsequent deregulation of=20
electricity
in the United Kingdom, the electric sector has become completely competitiv=
e
in all areas, including domestic customers. Just as in U.S. deregulation,
concerns about market power have restricted the domestic growth of U.K.
companies, which is compounded by the limited size of the U.K. energy marke=
t.
Consequently, companies like Powergen have developed unique skills both
in the United Kingdom and overseas so that they can expand scale through
opportunities abroad. Powergen had wanted for some time to penetrate the
U.S. market and evaluated potential partnerships with several energy compan=
ies
in this country, including Cinergy and Houston Industries (now Reliant),
which all fizzled.

LG&E is particularly appealing to Powergen because of the U.K. company's
desire to establish a strong presence in the Midwest market. LG&E should
be a good partner for Powergen, as the latter gains access to approximately
3.7 million customers. In addition, LG&E owns equity in and operates=20
non-utility
power plants in six states as well as in Spain; owns interest in three
natural-gas distribution companies in Argentina; and owns CRC-Evans Pipelin=
e
International, a provider of specialty equipment to the natural-gas and
oil pipeline construction industry. Altogether, LG&E's two utilities and
numerous unregulated businesses total about $5 billion in assets, which
should support any further expansion that Powergen might have in mind.
Perhaps Powergen's primary rationale for the acquisition is that the compan=
y
values LG&E's comparatively low-cost power production and high standards
regarding reliability and customer service.

Yesterday (Dec. 11) marked LG&E Energy's last day of trading on the New
York Stock Exchange. Shareholders on record should receive letters of=20
transmittal
from Powergen's paying agent, Computershare Trust Company of New York,
containing instructions for submitting their stock certificate for the
agreed-upon cash payment of $24.85 per share. An additional payment of
25.276 per share will also be paid to LG&E Energy shareholders on record
as of Dec. 8.

Powergen reportedly paid about $3.2 billion for LG&E, and assumed an=20
additional
$2.2 billion in LG&E debt. During the merger process, there was a lot of
speculation about how Powergen had financed the acquisition of LG&E, despit=
e
its disclosure of divesting key assets=01*such as overseas interests, its
metering business and two U.K. power stations=01*to generate liquid capital=
.
During the course of the regulatory approvals needed for the acquisition,
Standard & Poor's kept Powergen's debt position under scrutiny, although
its increased market potential and divestitures did help to offset any
significant downgrades in its ratings. Moving forward, it will be interesti=
ng
to see how the company's rating changes now that the acquisition has been
completed.

We have witnessed only three case of foreign acquisitions of U.S. utilities=
=01*
and
all are still fairly new=01*so consequently it is hard to say if this mixtu=
re
of two foreign corporate cultures will work. As an example of difficulties
that Powergen might face, ScottishPower encountered a multitude of=20
difficulties
assimilating into the culture of the Northwest regarding its purchase of
PacifiCorp. In addition, although PacifiCorp and National Grid both have
claimed that they intend to become major players in the U.S. markets throug=
h
their acquisitions of U.S. companies, that has yet to materialize.

Where the combined company goes from here is unknown. It is possible that
Powergen will continue to secure assets in the Midwest since it has claimed
that this will be a key area of expansion. Another possible strategy is
developing its telecom business. Powergen announced its move into the U.K.
telecommunications sector earlier this year. Powergen's joint venture with
Affinity Internet Holdings is supporting the development of Internet produc=
ts
and the establishment of fixed and mobile telecommunications along with
multi-utility billing solutions. Thus, speculation has been raised that
the company may develop this area of its business in the United States
as well. It is certainly only a matter of time before another foreign compa=
ny
attempts an acquisition of a U.S. utility. Consequently, many eyes will
remain on the Powergen / LGE combination as it should be a good indicator
of how successful or problematic such partnerships will be.

Steve,

Let me know if you agree that we switch to a uniform range of numbers...

Regards

Philippe
Proposal for Single Number Range for the New Enron Campus

For the opening of the New Enron Campus and the changing of the street  
address from 1400 Smith St to 1500 Louisiana, we propose that 
Enron elects to take a single DID number range for all in-bound 
telecommunications.
This single number range would bolster the strategic plan of allocating a DID 
to an employee
and that employee can take that number anywhere within the campus in a "Plug 
n Play" environment.

Currently we have over 21000 DID's in operation in the following locations EB 
, 2AC , 3AC , 500/600 Jeffersen and Penzoil Place . 
The numbers are spread across three different ranges :

- 713 853 xxxx ( 6300 numbers )
- 713 345 xxxx ( 10,000 numbers )
- 713 646 xxxx  ( 5,000 numbers )

The proposal is to take a 70,000 number range to cover current and future 
requirements. The benefits are :

 - less confusion to Enron customers and internal users
 - sufficient numbers to allow Enron to expand in the downtown area
 - increased capacity from one  range of numbers to cater for Fax or 
multimedia applications
 - have a new identity to fall in line with ''One Enron'' philosophy

Due to the high utilization of DID numbers in the downtown area, we will not 
get a (713) area code allocation, and we will be looking at the new ( 832) 
area code.
We have been investigating (832) 363(ENE) XXXX as the range, however this 
cannot be guaranteed.

To take this forward, I require high level approval of the scheme, we will 
then pressure the suppliers and regulatory committee's to meet Enron's 
requirements.

This Canadian environmental advocacy group filed at FERC a protest of HQ's 
continuation of market based rates (EPMI also filed a protest).  They note:

FERC's traditional Hub and Spoke market power analysis provides "false" 
market share percentages
The Quebec governmental has undermined the Quebec regulator, the Regie, of 
the exclusive jurisdiction in transmission regulation.  They cite an issue 
with 100 km of 735kv lines that were built using "emergency powers" to avoid 
the regulatory process.  In addition, they discuss a 1/99 Directive that 
absolved HQ from providing ionformation to the Regie.  Their conclusion is 
that the Regie is unable to question the prudence or usefulness of 
transmission equipment investments by HQ.  (Full protest attached.)

Janel:

In response to your request, here are some of the key themes that Ken is 
using that should be kept in mind in our advertising and other external 
efforts.  Let me know if there are other themes that we should be thinking 
about.

1) energy is the "master resource."  1.6 billion people don't have modern 
energy such as electricity, and the rest of the world needs increasing 
amounts of power in the IT age where bits are electrons and many new 
applications of power are emerging.  Reliability requirements are also way up 
in the IT age (more "9s" of reliability).

2) Infrastructure must expand to meet growing demand or price spikes can 
occur.  Price spikes lead to emergency fixes that are more costly and more 
polluting than if infrastructure was added in a more timely way.  For 
example, in California the lack of modern new gas-fired capacity has forced 
the state to run its older, more polluting gas plants more.

3) Electricity is a very volatile commodity--risk management tools are needed 
to meet customer expectations and avoid situations creating political 
opportunism and strife between buyers and sellers.

4) The short run answer to shortages is real time pricing to bring demand 
down to meet available supply in the peak periods.

5) Price controls create shortages and require further government involvement 
to ration supply.

6) Natural gas is the fuel of choice for new power generation capacity for 
economic and environmental reasons.  The resource base is robust, and gas 
(and LNG) could even over time displace much or all of the coal capacity of 
the United States.  This may be required as part of a climate change policy.  
However, the "NIMBY" problem could hurt gas more than coal in meeting the 
future needs of the country.

I strongly suspect that she'll be too modest to ever mention this to you, but 
you should know that two nights ago Linda was invited over to Treasury where 
Secretary Summers presented her with the "Alexander Hamilton" award.   I 
don't know too many details about the award, other than apparently it is the 
highest honor in the Treasury Department, and until Linda was awarded it, it 
had only been given to Secretaries (and UnderSecretaries?).

Subject: 

I have updated the material I sent you yesterday to include information on 
expansion plans of Bonneville and PacifiCorp, the two biggest owners in the 
Northwest Power Pool.  (In the US portion of the pool, BPA has 50% of the 
investment, PacifiCorp about 25% and the remaining IOU's the other 25%.  The 
statement "Bonneville owns 80% of the transmission in the Northwest" is only 
true if you exclude Canada, most of Montana and Idaho, all of Wyoming, Utah 
and Nevada.)  Don't quote the data for PacifiCorp, since it is not final and 
publicly announced.  The Bonneville data is from public sources.

Recognizing the time constraints you face, I've tried to 1) clear up a few 
inaccuracies and 2) massage some of the sharper language without taking a 
chainsaw to the otherwise good job.

In case folks haven't already heard through other sources, a reliable person 
told me that PG&E is hedged for core gas requirements:

financial--for 45% of core volumes at prices "in the single digits/decatherm"
physical--for 15% of core volumes (via storage) at prices "less than the 
financial hedge"

SDG&E is naked.

SoCalGas is likely in the same boat as SDG&E, or worse, since they optioned 
core's storage gas to noncore customers, and, those customers are exercising.

USA: Cinergy to buy two power plants from Enron.

12/12/2000
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2000.

NEW YORK, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Cinergy Corp. said Tuesday its non-regulated 
unit, Cinergy Capital & Trading Inc., would purchase two natural gas-fired 
power plants from Enron Corp. . 
Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.
The two Enron units, the 494-megawatt (MW) Brownsville generating facility in 
Tennessee and the 504-MW Caledonia plant in Mississippi, would increase 
Cinergy's generation portfolio owned, operated, or under construction, to 
about 21,000 MW, Cinergy said in a statement Tuesday. 
The Brownsville facility has four natural gas-fired combustion turbines, 
while the Caledonia facility has six. 
Both stations began operation in June 1999. They are located in the 
Southeastern Electric Reliability Council (SERC) and are interconnected to 
the Tennessee Valley Authority's transmission system, the statement said. 
The acquisition is subject to approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission (FERC), as well as other regulators, and is expected to be 
completed by the spring of 2001, Cinergy said. 
Cinergy Capital & Trading is an energy marketing and project development 
affiliate of Cincinnati, Ohio-based Cinergy Corp. Cinergy's largest operating 
companies, Cincinnati Gas and Electric Co. and PSI Energy Inc. provide 
electricity to more than 1.4 million customers in Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky.

Cinergy Agrees to Acquire Two Merchant Generating Plants From Enron

Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2000, Business Wire)

CINCINNATI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 12, 2000--Cinergy Corp. (NYSE:CIN) today 
announced that Cinergy Capital & Trading, Inc. (CCT), a non-regulated 
affiliate of Cinergy Corp, and Enron North America have signed a definitive 
agreement under which CCT will purchase two natural gas-fired merchant 
electric generating facilities located in the southeastern United States. 
The transaction is anticipated to be accretive to Cinergy's earnings in 2001. 
Financial terms were not disclosed. Also, the transaction will increase 
Cinergy's generation portfolio to about 21,000 megawatts (net owned, operated 
or under development) with the non-regulated portion being approximately 
15,000 megawatts.
"This acquisition in combination with our recently deregulated Ohio 
generation and the peaking capacity added early this year creates for Cinergy 
a significant and balanced generation portfolio of baseload and peaking 
capacity," said James E. Rogers, president and CEO of Cinergy Corp. 
"Importantly, these facilities can serve our large long-term customers in the 
Southeast, which is among the fastest growing areas in the country, as well 
as our Midwest customers." 
The acquisition consists of Enron's 494-megawatt Brownsville generation 
facility located in Haywood County, Tennessee and the 504-megawatt Caledonia 
generation facility located in Lowndes County, Mississippi. Brownsville has 
four natural gas-fired combustion turbines and Caledonia has six. Both 
stations entered into service in June 1999. Both facilities are located in 
the Southeastern Electric Reliability Council (SERC) region and are 
interconnected to the Tennessee Valley Authority's transmission system. 
"Cinergy has created a regional leadership position in the Midwest power 
market and is focused on strategic opportunities to expand our footprint," 
said Michael J. Cyrus, president of Cinergy Capital & Trading. "With this 
transaction we will have added approximately 1,700 megawatts in the eastern 
interconnect and increased our non-regulated generating capacity in excess of 
30 percent in just over a year. It is indicative of our continued commitment 
to the growth and value of a balanced energy merchant business." 
The completion of the acquisition is subject to, among other things, receipt 
of approval of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and expiration of the 
waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 
1976. Cinergy currently expects that regulatory approvals would be obtained 
and the transaction will close in Spring 2001. 
Cinergy Capital & Trading, Inc. is a non-regulated energy marketing and 
project development affiliate of Cinergy Corp., one of the nation's leading 
diversified energy companies, with a total enterprise value of $8.5 billion 
and assets of $10 billion. In addition to its generation portfolio, it also 
has 55,000 miles of electric and gas transmission lines in the United States 
and abroad and approximately 9,000 employees in nine countries. Its largest 
operating companies, The Cincinnati Gas & Electric Company and PSI Energy, 
Inc., serve more than 1.4 million electric customers and 478,000 gas 
customers in Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky. 
Cinergy is active in U.S. power and natural gas markets and maintains a 
24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week trading operation. The interconnections of 
Cinergy's Midwestern transmission assets give it access to 37 percent of the 
total U.S. energy consumption. In 1998 the New York Mercantile Exchange 
selected Cinergy to be its transmission hub for Midwest electricity futures 
trading, which has become the most active hub in the United States. 
In addition to its U.S. operations, Cinergy owns and operates power 
generation, transmission and distribution assets in the Czech Republic, 
Spain, the United Kingdom, Zambia, Kenya, South Africa and Estonia. Cinergy 
is also active in European gas and electricity markets.

Subject: NEW HARASSMENT


Senator Burton, President Pro-Tem, has asked for the name and address of
all the CEOs of the "generators".   This request has come through Julie
Malinowski from the Independent Energy Producers' (IEP) lobbying firm,
Edson and Modisette.  Burton gave her a list on which Enron appeared.  I
asked her to eliminate us from the list and say that we are not generators.
If Burton comes back anyway, I have given Julie the names and addresses of
Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling.

Energy Price Volatility May Hurt Utilities' Credit

By REBECCA SMITH
Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL

Recent volatility in wholesale energy markets is
undermining the credit ratings and may eventually crimp
the borrowing ability of some of the nation's biggest
utilities, long regarded in the credit markets as some of
the safest bets around.

It is the worst out West, where the price of power to be
delivered Wednesday hit a new high of $1,182 per megawatt
hour on California's state-sanctioned auction, a benchmark
for the entire region. That compares with $30 a year ago.

But even utilities in the East, such as GPU Inc. of
Parsippany, N.J., and Consolidated Edison of New York,
also are at risk because they are paying higher prices
than ever for spot-market electricity purchases and aren't
always able to pass along that cost to their customers.

As an indication of just how bad things are getting,
Moody's Investors Service Tuesday put Seattle City Light
on "negative outlook," even though it is one of the
lowest-cost generators in the nation. There hasn't been
much rain in the Northwest this year and the city-owned
utility has been forced to go to the wholesale market this
month to buy 100 to 200 megawatts of electricity each day.
That isn't much energy, but with prices that have gone as
high as $1,000 per megawatt hour this week, compared with
the $24 per megawatt hour that the municipal utility pays
for power from the federal hydroelectric system, costs add
up fast. The utility, which issued $100 million in bonds
this week, is raising rates 10%, effective Jan. 1, and
will keep the rate increase in effect as long as it takes
to dig its way out.

"Prices are at absurd levels," says Seattle City Light
Superintendent Gary Zarker. "I know others are looking at
significant rate increases too."

Credit-rating agencies say they are going through their
utility portfolios and separating those with exposure to
wholesale markets from those that have enough in-house
generation to meet customer demand. Then they are trying
to figure out which of the ones that are forced to buy on
the spot market will be allowed to pass on higher costs
and which ones won't.

"You have the makings of a credit crunch when utilities
are required to buy power but aren't allowed to pass the
cost through," says Steven Fetter, managing director of
the global power unit at Fitch, the New York credit-rating
agency.

That is exactly the position California's biggest
investor-owned utilities are in. Southern California
Edison Co., a unit of Edison International, and Pacific
Gas and Electric Co., a unit of PG&E Corp., have incurred
deficits in excess of $7 billion buying power on the open
market since June and were forced to pay higher rates and
offer unprecedented guarantees to investors when they last
issued bonds.

While they are still making money from the power plants
they own, it is nowhere near enough to make up for the
shortfall. Credit ratings of both utilities were lowered
this week.

Blown the Lid Off

There is no cost relief in sight. California's grid
operator last week lifted a price cap for power it buys
each hour to keep supply matched with demand. That helped
reliability because more generators came forward and
offered energy through an orderly market, instead of
waiting for harried engineers to call them at the last
minute trying to strike a deal.

But it has really blown the lid off prices in the West.
The average cost of power sold in the day-ahead market
jumped from $250 a megawatt hour last week to $611 on
Monday, $904 Tuesday and to $1,182 for power to be
delivered Wednesday.

This has a huge impact because it applies to roughly
two-thirds of the power consumed in the state and
influences prices elsewhere. The situation differs
markedly from Eastern markets where only a small
proportion of the power consumed comes out of a daily spot
market because most utilities have long-term
power-purchase contracts that supply most of their needs.

Some of the utilities in the Northwest being slammed by
high prices will be in the position of selling power back
in May or June, provided there is enough spring-thaw
runoff to give them surplus hydropower.

Financial Pain

But utility managers worry it won't be enough to cancel
out the financial pain they are currently suffering.

Distribution utilities that deliver the power that others
generate were regarded as the safest part of the utility
business only a few months ago. Wall Street assigned them
the lowest valuations because they face regulated rates of
return.

"Sadly, we now see they chose the part of the business
with a lower upside potential and higher risk," Mr.
Fetter, of Fitch, says.

Executive Summary
? California Treasurer Angelides Sets Dates for Bridge Loans & Bonds
? California's Supreme Court May See Challenge to "Plan B"

Angelides on Bridge Loans and Bonds
CA Treasurer Angelides has said that beginning 15 August, the state will set 
up a bridge loan.  The revenue bonds will not be issued until September or 
October.  Angelides is not concerned about a cash crisis in July or August.  
However, he is quite worried about problems with cash flow in October and 
November.  This is based on calculations he has done with numbers from the 
DWR and from other parts of the government, not on payment terms for power.  
He fears there will be a cash management problem.

California Supreme Court to Challenge "Plan B"
California Attorney Michael Sturmwasser is expected to challenge "Plan B" 
before the California Supreme Court on the basis that it results in a 
retroactive rate increase and that it removes the PUC's authority to review 
power purchases.  This is because "Plan B" enables SoCal to collect a 
dedicated rate component to pay both its undercollect and its expenses going 
forward.  SoCal (and PG&E) would have to be guaranteed this dedicated rate 
component to be able to operate going forward and remain credit-worthy.  This 
takes the burden of financing the energy crisis away from the state and off 
the state's balance sheet, a key goal of lawmakers.  However, at the same 
time, it also abrogates the PUC from its responsibility to review power 
purchases.  The state cannot give the utilities a blank check (in the form of 
a dedicated rate component) to operate without taking authority away from the 
PUC.  According to the California constitution, the legislature can add to 
the responsibilities of the PUC, but it cannot take away powers from the 
PUC.  At the same time, ratepayers will be paying an additional surcharge for 
power that they have already used.  Sources describe Sturmwasser's case as 
"arguable"; in other words, it has a fair chance of succeeding.  However, 
regardless of whether the challenge succeeds or fails, it is very likely to 
cloud the issue of the bail-out and significantly deflate the prospects of 
the Plan B.

If FERC were to impose cost-based controls on power prices, sources believe 
it might "go a long way toward avoiding these problems."  Were this to 
happen, the PUC could declare FERC's rates "just and reasonable," which would 
likely greatly lessen the crisis and keep SoCal liquid.  However, such 
measures by FERC require significant lead time.  Sources state that "the 
state needs to tease the feds into doing this."  This can be done by 
conducting studies to obtain current cost data and update the data FERC would 
use for determining the cost controls.  Sources report that this process of 
"teasing" FERC has not yet started.  This is chiefly because California 
politicians are focused on flat price caps, which FERC is very unlikely to 
impose.  It appears the state is asking FERC for the wrong measures, which is 
delaying the process.  The only way for the state to avoid these 
constitutional issues would be for the state to purchase the utilities, as 
municipal entities would not be subject to PUC regulation.  However, there 
remains very significant opposition to this idea, especially on the 
Republican side.  A state purchase of the utilities would likely only gain 
momentum once Plan B began to fail for the reasons cited above.  
Additionally, a state purchase of the utilities would be less expensive were 
both utilities in bankruptcy.

Sturmwasser is a partner at Sturmwasser & Woocher, a Santa Monica law firm.  
(His offices are on the top floor of the tallest building in Santa Monica, 
overlooking the beach.)  He has been a utilities lawyer for over 30 years.  
His clients include the consumer advocacy group TURN (Toward Utilities Rate 
Normalcy), among others.  Sturmwasser will reportedly look for funding to 
support the legal challenge, but if he cannot find money elsewhere, he will 
likely be able to support it out of his own pocket.

COLOMBIA: Colombia sets new date for key utility privatization.
12/13/2000
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2000.

BOGOTA, Dec 13 (Reuters) - The embattled Colombian government on Wednesday 
set a deadline of June 30 next year for its often delayed privatization of 
state-run power generator ISAGEN. 
The 1,636 megawatt generator, the country's third-largest and valued at about 
$450 million, was most recently due to have been sold by Sept. 30 as part of 
a year-old plan agreed with the International Monetary Fund to help boost 
government revenues and meet tight budget targets.
But it was delayed indefinitely until just last week when the Council of 
State - a tribunal set up to resolve disputes between the government and 
private sector - struck down an injunction blocking the sale that was based 
on a complaint from Empresas Publicas de Medellin (EPM), Colombia's largest 
public utility. 
EPM has argued that it has been unfairly excluded from the bidding process 
for ISAGEN by government regulators, on grounds that its ownership of the 
company would violate antitrust laws by giving it a virtual monopoly over 
Colombia's power generating capacity. 
Finance Minister Juan Manuel Santos said in September that the government was 
determined to finalize the ISAGEN sell-off by the end of this year, once the 
Council of State ruled as expected in the government's favor. 
But Santos, who spoke to reporters as he emerged from a cabinet meeting at 
the presidential palace, said legal loopholes, possible changes in the 
price-tag for ISAGEN, and the need to update paperwork related to its 
privatization would now postpone the deal until June 30. 
"We have to restart this whole process. We're going to study the valuation 
and reopen negotiations with possible buyers to see how we can put ISAGEN up 
for sale at the best price as soon as possible," Santos said. 
The sale of ISAGEN, considered one of the crown jewels in the government's 
troubled privatization program, had originally been expected to take place 
last December. It was later slated for the first half of 2000, at a time when 
government sources said leading bidders included U.S. energy group Enron . 
The sell-off in the first half of this year was delayed, until the elusive 
Sept. 30 deadline, amid a flurry of attacks on the national power grid by 
Marxist rebel saboteurs and legal challenges to the sale from ISAGEN's own 
labor union.

2:58 (Dow Jones) As credit quality concerns dog investors, Bear Stearns' 
analyst Amy Butte says in a report Wednesday that investment banks are 
increasing liquidity to historically high levels, which could be a sign of 
either a more conservative bent or a premonition of risk, she said. (CWM)
2:48 (Dow Jones) Gridlock may put some of Bush's measures, such as school 
vouchers and Social Security privatization, on hold. But rebel Democrats may 
help pass all or most of Bush's tax cuts, says economist Ian Morris at HSBC. 
That wouldn't prevent hard landing in 2001, but the stimulus will be felt by 
2002. By 2003, Morris says, the surplus could be more like $250 billion than 
CBO's projected $400 billion. (SV) 
2:39 (Dow Jones) OK, so it wasn't an unprecedented ruling that determined our 
next president, but there was a big ruling in the HMO arena concerning 
provider lawsuits. Chase H&Q calls judge's decision granting certain parts 
and denying other parts of various defendant's motions a minor victory for 
HMOs. Ruling positive for Wellpoint (WLP) and Aetna (AET), mildly positive 
for Cigna (CI) and United Healthcare (UNH), mixed for PacifiCare (PHSY), and 
has no impact on Humana (HUM). (TG) 
2:30 (Dow Jones) March S&Ps, which have spent all day in negative territory, 
are focusing on the fundamentals now that the election outcome is more 
certain. And the fundamentals don't look too bullish, given the earnings 
warnings of recent days, particularly from computer and chip-makers, 
off-floor traders say. "We probably won't be heading any higher tomorrow than 
where we are today," he said. (ZHS) 
2:20 (Dow Jones) The intraday low for Toronto's TSE 300 Index is 9103.95, 
practically significant weekly support at 9103.64. The index is now pointed 
up to about 9500 at least, if the intraday low holds. A daily close below 
9103.64 means that the index is headed back to to the lower 8500 handle. (SC) 
2:15 (Dow Jones) Lehman's Jeff deGraaf says that while he is not a big fan of 
energy names currently, Ultramar Diamond Shamrock (UDS) has one of the best 
looking charts in the sector. Nice base off which to rally, and shares are 
above both 50-day and 200-day moving average. Stop under $26. (TG) 
2:00 (Dow Jones) Tough day for Applied Materials (AMAT) and semi group. 
Salomon, Merrill downgrade AMAT, and Prudential lowers estimates on company 
and several other semiconductor names. Pru also has an "implied trough value" 
for semi companies, and they're not pretty: AMAT $28-$27, KLAC $20-$26, KLIC 
$8, LRCX $14-$18, NVLS $22-$31, and TER $15-$30. (TG) 
1:45 (Dow Jones) Celestica (CLS) and NEC Corp. (NIPNY) could be about to hook 
up again. TD Securities analyst Mark Lucey says Celestica is looking for 
regulatory approval to buy a unit of NEC in the U.K. This after NEC said 
Tuesday it is in talks to sell its mobile phone production facilities in the 
U.K. and Mexico. In June, Celestica acquired NEC's manufacturing plant in 
Brazil as part of a five-year, $1.2 billion supply agreement. In addition, 
Nokia is looking to move into Brazil and said it will use Celestica to 
manufacture GSM wireless base stations after securing contract wins, 
according to Lucey. (SEW) 
1:43 (Dow Jones) Said U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, a Democrat from Austin, Tex.: 
"With a mere one-person majority of the Court and a definiite minority of the 
national vote, President-elect Bush is off to a tough start. All of us have a 
stake in the success of his presidency. Now is the time to join with him, 
without foresaking principle, to seek common ground in addressing the 
nation's needs." (JC) 
1:29 (Dow Jones) The chance of a rate cut at the next FOMC meeting next week 
is modest, but on the rise and helping to fuel Tsys gains, says bond 
strategist. Fed Funds futures showing 15% to 20% chance of rate cut on Dec. 
19, strategist says. 30-year now at session high, up 22/32 at 111 3/32, yield 
down 4 bp at 5.49%. (JNP) 
1:22 (Dow Jones) Prudential Vector analyst Timothy Anderson lowered Alza 
(AZA) to accumulate from strong buy because of valuation. With positive 
prescription trends for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder medicine 
Concerta and strong market shares of overactive bladder treatment Ditropan 
XL, Anderson said Alza shares are "priced for perfection and expectations are 
high - any slight upset could weigh heavily on the stock." Shares fell about 
8.5%. (BMM) 
1:13 (Dow Jones) Online and discount broker Charles Schwab Corp. (SCH) sees 
meeting the 14 cents that analysts expected for its fourth quarter earnings 
per share as a challenge, unless there is a big surge in trading activity or 
the firm cuts costs sharply. Schwab shares are off 2.7%. (GFC) 
1:10 (Dow Jones) Enron's (ENE) current chief executive and chairman, Kenneth 
Lay, says he categorically won't be taking a job in a new presidential 
administration. "I have no plans to go to Washington, and no plans to leave 
Houston or Enron. I can say categorically that I won't be taking a job in a 
Bush cabinet," Lay said in an interview. (MPG) 
1:07 (Dow Jones) Vlasic Foods International (VL) apparently has received bids 
for both the entire company and individual parts, according to Merrill 
Lynch's Len Teitelbaum. The troubled pickle maker has been on the block since 
March. Teitelbaum says a deadline of Feb. 28 has been set by the banks 
involved. He estimates stockholders could reap proceeds of 89 cents to $1.00 
a share at the completion of a sale. Teitelbaum is convinced that "the main 
objective of (Vlasic's) management now is to make the bondholder whole." As a 
result, the analyst no longer maintains an investment opinion on the stock.

1:00 (Dow Jones) Tech boutique Thomas Weisel Partners reiterated its buy

$125.2 million from $106.4 million, saying the computer firewall maker's 
acquisition of Phobos will boost market share in internal transaction 
security as well as traditional firewall appliances. "Visibility and and 
business momentum continue to be strong," said analyst Mark Edelen. (MER) 
12:56 (Dow Jones) March Nasdaqs and S&Ps are incurring losses on 
profit-taking, said floor traders, who were intrigued by their fall even when 
it has become clear that Al Gore, whose defeat was seen as bullish for the 
stock futures market, is reportedly going to concede. "There's no uncertainty 
left in the market," quipped one floor trader. (ZHS) 
12:40 (Dow Jones) Lehman opened up coverage on a passel of Internet 
infrastructure service companies, with an outperform rating on Digex (DIGX), 
Genuity (GENU) and InterNAP (INAP). Harry Blount is looking past current 
turbulence in the stocks to a time of "powerful secular growth." The 
companies, Blount says, "have among the most compelling business models of 
any emerging growth sector in the stock market." Among the pluses he cites 
are steady revenue, scalable business models and decreasing capital costs as 
the companies reach critical mass. 
12:21 (Dow Jones) Wounded Linux stocks rallying for second straight day after 
IBM CEO Gerstner said Tuesday that Big Blue would invest $1 billion next year 
commercializing the renegade operating system. After seeing their stocks drop 
as much as 95% this year, Red Hat (RHAT), VA Linux, (LNUX) and Caldera (CALD) 
are each up more than 20%. (MLP) 
12:14 (Dow Jones) Stanley Furniture's (STLY) 4Q sales and earns warning comes 
on same day that Commerce, in its retail sales report, said overall furniture 
sales surged 1.5% in Nov. - biggest monthly jump in about a year. Maybe 
coincidental, maybe a holiday phenom. But it's still interesting that sales 
climbing amid clear signs of general earnings weakness in furniture business. 
Stanley, a thinly traded stock, off 8% at 21.32. (GC) 
12:10 (Dow Jones) Bond market issuance was down 25% during the first three 
quarters of the year amid the Fed's interest rate hiking campaign, the Bond 
Market Association says. Total issuance totaled $1.6 trillion through Sept. 
to $15.6 trillion in outstanding debt. (MSD) 
11:57 (Dow Jones) Veritas (VRTS) continues to feel pressure (shares down 6%) 
amid concerns it will suffer from weakness in Sun Microsystems' (SUNW) server 
business, which accounts for a chunk of its storage software sales. But 
Merrill defends Veritas, saying it's on track to meet or exceed fourth 
quarter targets and investors should use volatility to load up on Veritas. 
(MLP) 
11:51 (Dow Jones) A lot of news and bond friendly data today, but not any big 
changes in sentiment. As tech names trade in negative territory, Treasurys 
are holding a bid. But traders say flows are going both ways, suggesting that 
a rebound in stocks will be enough to push Treasury prices back toward 
unchanged on the day. (SV)L)

2:30 (Dow Jones) March S&Ps, which have spent all day in negative territory, 
are focusing on the fundamentals now that the election outcome is more 
certain. And the fundamentals don't look too bullish, given the earnings 
warnings of recent days, particularly from computer and chip-makers, 
off-floor traders say. "We probably won't be heading any higher tomorrow than 
where we are today," he said. (ZHS)
2:20 (Dow Jones) The intraday low for Toronto's TSE 300 Index is 9103.95, 
practically significant weekly support at 9103.64. The index is now pointed 
up to about 9500 at least, if the intraday low holds. A daily close below 
9103.64 means that the index is headed back to to the lower 8500 handle. (SC) 
2:15 (Dow Jones) Lehman's Jeff deGraaf says that while he is not a big fan of 
energy names currently, Ultramar Diamond Shamrock (UDS) has one of the best 
looking charts in the sector. Nice base off which to rally, and shares are 
above both 50-day and 200-day moving average. Stop under $26. (TG) 
2:00 (Dow Jones) Tough day for Applied Materials (AMAT) and semi group. 
Salomon, Merrill downgrade AMAT, and Prudential lowers estimates on company 
and several other semiconductor names. Pru also has an "implied trough value" 
for semi companies, and they're not pretty: AMAT $28-$27, KLAC $20-$26, KLIC 
$8, LRCX $14-$18, NVLS $22-$31, and TER $15-$30. (TG) 
1:45 (Dow Jones) Celestica (CLS) and NEC Corp. (NIPNY) could be about to hook 
up again. TD Securities analyst Mark Lucey says Celestica is looking for 
regulatory approval to buy a unit of NEC in the U.K. This after NEC said 
Tuesday it is in talks to sell its mobile phone production facilities in the 
U.K. and Mexico. In June, Celestica acquired NEC's manufacturing plant in 
Brazil as part of a five-year, $1.2 billion supply agreement. In addition, 
Nokia is looking to move into Brazil and said it will use Celestica to 
manufacture GSM wireless base stations after securing contract wins, 
according to Lucey. (SEW) 
1:43 (Dow Jones) Said U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, a Democrat from Austin, Tex.: 
"With a mere one-person majority of the Court and a definiite minority of the 
national vote, President-elect Bush is off to a tough start. All of us have a 
stake in the success of his presidency. Now is the time to join with him, 
without foresaking principle, to seek common ground in addressing the 
nation's needs." (JC) 
1:29 (Dow Jones) The chance of a rate cut at the next FOMC meeting next week 
is modest, but on the rise and helping to fuel Tsys gains, says bond 
strategist. Fed Funds futures showing 15% to 20% chance of rate cut on Dec. 
19, strategist says. 30-year now at session high, up 22/32 at 111 3/32, yield 
down 4 bp at 5.49%. (JNP) 
1:22 (Dow Jones) Prudential Vector analyst Timothy Anderson lowered Alza 
(AZA) to accumulate from strong buy because of valuation. With positive 
prescription trends for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder medicine 
Concerta and strong market shares of overactive bladder treatment Ditropan 
XL, Anderson said Alza shares are "priced for perfection and expectations are 
high - any slight upset could weigh heavily on the stock." Shares fell about 
8.5%. (BMM) 
1:13 (Dow Jones) Online and discount broker Charles Schwab Corp. (SCH) sees 
meeting the 14 cents that analysts expected for its fourth quarter earnings 
per share as a challenge, unless there is a big surge in trading activity or 
the firm cuts costs sharply. Schwab shares are off 2.7%. (GFC) 
1:10 (Dow Jones) Enron's (ENE) current chief executive and chairman, Kenneth 
Lay, says he categorically won't be taking a job in a new presidential 
administration. "I have no plans to go to Washington, and no plans to leave 
Houston or Enron. I can say categorically that I won't be taking a job in a 
Bush cabinet," Lay said in an interview. (MPG) 
1:07 (Dow Jones) Vlasic Foods International (VL) apparently has received bids 
for both the entire company and individual parts, according to Merrill 
Lynch's Len Teitelbaum. The troubled pickle maker has been on the block since 
March. Teitelbaum says a deadline of Feb. 28 has been set by the banks 
involved. He estimates stockholders could reap proceeds of 89 cents to $1.00 
a share at the completion of a sale. Teitelbaum is convinced that "the main 
objective of (Vlasic's) management now is to make the bondholder whole." As a 
result, the analyst no longer maintains an investment opinion on the stock. 
(VL) 
1:00 (Dow Jones) Tech boutique Thomas Weisel Partners reiterated its buy 
rating and raised its 2001 revenue projections for SonicWall (SNWL), to 
$125.2 million from $106.4 million, saying the computer firewall maker's 
acquisition of Phobos will boost market share in internal transaction 
security as well as traditional firewall appliances. "Visibility and and 
business momentum continue to be strong," said analyst Mark Edelen. (MER) 
12:56 (Dow Jones) March Nasdaqs and S&Ps are incurring losses on 
profit-taking, said floor traders, who were intrigued by their fall even when 
it has become clear that Al Gore, whose defeat was seen as bullish for the 
stock futures market, is reportedly going to concede. "There's no uncertainty 
left in the market," quipped one floor trader. (ZHS) 
12:40 (Dow Jones) Lehman opened up coverage on a passel of Internet 
infrastructure service companies, with an outperform rating on Digex (DIGX), 
Genuity (GENU) and InterNAP (INAP). Harry Blount is looking past current 
turbulence in the stocks to a time of "powerful secular growth." The 
companies, Blount says, "have among the most compelling business models of 
any emerging growth sector in the stock market." Among the pluses he cites 
are steady revenue, scalable business models and decreasing capital costs as 
the companies reach critical mass. 
12:21 (Dow Jones) Wounded Linux stocks rallying for second straight day after 
IBM CEO Gerstner said Tuesday that Big Blue would invest $1 billion next year 
commercializing the renegade operating system. After seeing their stocks drop 
as much as 95% this year, Red Hat (RHAT), VA Linux, (LNUX) and Caldera (CALD) 
are each up more than 20%. (MLP) 
12:14 (Dow Jones) Stanley Furniture's (STLY) 4Q sales and earns warning comes 
on same day that Commerce, in its retail sales report, said overall furniture 
sales surged 1.5% in Nov. - biggest monthly jump in about a year. Maybe 
coincidental, maybe a holiday phenom. But it's still interesting that sales 
climbing amid clear signs of general earnings weakness in furniture business. 
Stanley, a thinly traded stock, off 8% at 21.32. (GC) 
12:10 (Dow Jones) Bond market issuance was down 25% during the first three 
quarters of the year amid the Fed's interest rate hiking campaign, the Bond 
Market Association says. Total issuance totaled $1.6 trillion through Sept. 
to $15.6 trillion in outstanding debt. (MSD) 
11:57 (Dow Jones) Veritas (VRTS) continues to feel pressure (shares down 6%) 
amid concerns it will suffer from weakness in Sun Microsystems' (SUNW) server 
business, which accounts for a chunk of its storage software sales. But 
Merrill defends Veritas, saying it's on track to meet or exceed fourth 
quarter targets and investors should use volatility to load up on Veritas. 
(MLP) 
11:51 (Dow Jones) A lot of news and bond friendly data today, but not any big 
changes in sentiment. As tech names trade in negative territory, Treasurys 
are holding a bid. But traders say flows are going both ways, suggesting that 
a rebound in stocks will be enough to push Treasury prices back toward 
unchanged on the day. (SV)

Energy buyers ordered to divest=20
By Amy Chance
Bee Political Editor
(Published July 19, 2001)=20
The Davis administration on Wednesday told consultants buying electricity f=
or=20
the state to sell their stock holdings in energy companies immediately or=
=20
leave their jobs.=20
Nine consultants divested by a noon deadline, but critics said Gov. Gray=20
Davis acted months too late to protect the public's interest.=20
The order, issued at Davis' direction, was contained in a memo to Tom=20
Hannigan, director of the state Department of Water Resources. Legal Affair=
s=20
Secretary Barry Goode wrote that it was "imperative that you give this=20
instruction immediately" to those concerned.=20
"We expect, and have always expected, the state's consultants to uphold the=
=20
highest ethical standards," the memo states. "That standard is not met by=
=20
those who hold a financial interest in one or more energy companies while=
=20
trading on behalf of the state on energy related matters."=20
Under pressure from Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican who hopes t=
o=20
challenge Democrat Davis for re-election next year, the administration move=
d=20
last week to obtain statements of economic interest from the energy=20
consultants. The consultants were brought on earlier this year to help the=
=20
Department of Water Resources buy electricity on behalf of California's=20
financially strapped utilities.=20
The economic statements revealed that several consultants held stock in=20
energy generators, including Calpine Corp. and Enron. One consultant report=
ed=20
that he sold stock holdings in Edison International and Dynegy when he bega=
n=20
work for the state.=20
Administration officials initially said they would review the reports for a=
ny=20
conflicts, considering whether the consultants traded with companies in whi=
ch=20
they held stock.=20
But Goode's memo, dated Wednesday, said each of the consultants should dive=
st=20
by noon that day or "the state will sever its contract with that person." T=
he=20
notice was given to the 34 people who had disclosed their interests as=20
required, nine of whom reported a current financial interest in an energy=
=20
company, according to the administration. A governor's spokesman said all o=
f=20
them divested by the deadline.=20
State Attorney General Bill Lockyer, whom Jones had asked to investigate,=
=20
told Jones in a letter Tuesday that most of Jones' allegations, including=
=20
whether the statements of economic interest were filed on time, should be=
=20
dealt with first by the state Fair Political Practices Commission.=20
He noted that one section of applicable state law sets a high threshold for=
=20
conflict of interest: It provides that someone holding less than 3 percent =
of=20
the shares of a corporation does not have a conflict unless his or her tota=
l=20
yearly income from dividends or other payments exceeds 5 percent of his or=
=20
her annual income.=20
But he said he would review the statements to see whether a=20
conflict-of-interest investigation is warranted "in light of the legitimate=
=20
and important public interest in the employment of public servants who are=
=20
free of conflicting interests. ... "=20
Lockyer spokesman Nathan Barankin pointed out that Jones had called into=20
question the validity of state electricity contracts negotiated by the=20
buyers.=20
"What we're saying is that there's a public interest in getting to the bott=
om=20
of it as quickly as possible, so there's some certainty," he said.=20
Jones said simply selling the stock doesn't solve the problem.=20
"Just divesting themselves of the stock, or even letting them go, doesn't=
=20
change the conflict that's been inherent for the last five months," Jones=
=20
said. "If someone who has a proven conflict of interest has negotiated=20
contracts on behalf of the state, there is no contract."=20
Jones also noted that the Davis administration says an additional 20 or mor=
e=20
people it has brought on board to cope with the energy crisis have not been=
=20
required to file disclosure statements. He said Lockyer should investigate=
=20
whether the administration has abided by disclosure law in those cases.=20
"(Davis') record is not very good when you look at the fact that I had to=
=20
make the case to even get these statements of conflict of interest filed,"=
=20
Jones said. "It's up to the attorney general to be the judge, but the publi=

Another contempt action=20
By Kevin Yamamura
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published July 19, 2001)=20
A state Senate committee held another energy generator in contempt Wednesda=
y=20
and may recommend today that Enron Corp. either pay fines or be removed fro=
m=20
California's marketplace if it continues to withhold documents.=20
Meanwhile, lawmakers in both houses spent Wednesday night debating three=20
plans to prevent Southern California Edison from going into bankruptcy,=20
though no one idea had broad support.=20
The committee's action against Reliant Energy marked the third contempt=20
finding in as many weeks by the special Senate committee investigating ener=
gy=20
market manipulation. After reaching a legal disagreement over whether trade=
=20
secrets would be protected, lawmakers voted 6-0 to push Reliant, a=20
Houston-based generator, into contempt proceedings.=20
The panel found five other generators in compliance with subpoenas after th=
ey=20
signed confidentiality agreements earlier this week and promised to ship=20
thousands of files to depositories.=20
Three weeks ago, the committee found Enron and another generator, Mirant, i=
n=20
contempt. Mirant has since cooperated and escaped the committee's finding,=
=20
but Enron filed a lawsuit in Sacramento Superior Court seeking judicial=20
intervention.=20
Despite ongoing discussions between the committee and Enron representatives=
,=20
they have reached no deal to end the lawsuit or the contempt finding.=20
Lawmakers therefore intend to issue a report today leading to a later Senat=
e=20
vote on contempt and subsequent penalties.=20
The committee was considering two possibilities late Wednesday, said its=20
chairman, Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana. The first would impose fines that=20
compound each successive day Enron remains in contempt. The second would=20
exclude the Houston-based marketer from selling energy in California until =
it=20
hands over documents.=20
"We're reviewing the (legal) basis for such a recommendation," Dunn said.=
=20
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said he had no response to the potential=20
penalties but stressed that his company is still discussing the contempt=20
matter with lawmakers.=20
In Reliant's case, lawmakers and the company disagreed Wednesday over wheth=
er=20
the committee's own confidentiality agreement affords enough protection of=
=20
trade secrets.=20
Reliant attorney Charles Stevens said his company would rather have a court=
=20
order to ensure that its proprietary information would be safe. But committ=
ee=20
members objected to involving the state's judicial branch, charging that it=
=20
would disrupt the separation of powers.=20
Several times during the hearing, Dunn conceded that Reliant, like Enron, m=
ay=20
ultimately resort to a lawsuit to resolve its disagreement with the=20
committee.=20
"We have not made that decision at this time," said Stevens, the Reliant=20
attorney. "We've always preferred to resolve the dispute with the committee=
=20
informally, and we continue to look for ways to do that."=20
Should Reliant work out an agreement with lawmakers by cooperating with the=
=20
document requests, the contempt vote would be purged, Dunn said.=20
The Legislature last held someone in contempt in 1929, when concrete compan=
y=20
officials did not comply with subpoenas in a price-fixing case.=20
In a vote late Wednesday, meanwhile, the Senate's energy committee voted do=
wn=20
one Edison proposal. It will be reconsidered this morning.=20
Two competing Assembly proposals to keep Edison from bankruptcy were narrow=

approved by the Energy Costs and Availability Committee. One of the=20

PUC paves way for power rate increases=20
By Dale Kasler
Bee Staff Writer
(Published July 19, 2001)=20
Sparking accusations that it's abandoning its watchdog role, the Public=20
Utilities Commission took the first step Wednesday toward promising to rais=
e=20
rates as much as necessary to pay the state's electricity bills.=20
PUC President Loretta Lynch released a proposed version of the promise -- a=

legally binding document known as a rate agreement. Although the agreement=
=20
doesn't say there will be more rate hikes, it does commit the PUC to raisin=
g=20
rates when requested by the state Department of Water Resources.=20
The agreement is essential to the state's plan to sell $13.4 billion in bon=

in September to cover the water department's power purchases. The departmen=

"Everyone's been kind of waiting for it," he said of the agreement.=20
State Treasurer Phil Angelides, who is in charge of marketing the bonds, sa=

in a prepared statement Wednesday that the rate agreement "must be adopted =

that the (state's) general fund can be repaid, and to protect the state's=

fiscal solvency." Angelides has been promising potential bond buyers that t=
he=20
rate agreement would be adopted.=20
The full PUC is scheduled to vote on the agreement Aug. 23.=20
It's unclear whether the agreement will lead to a rate increase any time=20
soon. The water department, which will release updated revenue requirements=
=20
this week, says it doesn't think the new numbers will generate another rate=
=20
hike beyond the 30 percent increase the PUC approved in March for Southern=
=20
California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co.=20
Still, consumer advocates said the rate agreement would represent a surrend=
er=20
of the PUC's traditional job of protecting ratepayers.=20
The agreement would permit "an unaccountable state agency, riddled with=20
conflicts of interest, to unilaterally order rate hikes," said Harvey=20
Rosenfield, president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in=
=20
Santa Monica.=20
The water department has been accused of conflicts of interest because some=
=20
of its consultants and energy traders own stock in energy companies.=20
Rosenfield said the PUC should reject the rate agreement and "preserve thei=

historic role and responsibility to protect ratepayers."=20
Geoff Dryvynsyde, Lynch's legal adviser, said the "consumer groups are=20
raising some good policy issues," but the commission's hands are effectivel=

tied by legislation that put the state in the power-buying business and set=

in motion the bond sale.=20
"The bonds are really driving this," he said. "The bonds need to be sold."=

Nevertheless, Eric Woychik, a consumer advocate with the Oakland-based grou=
p=20
Strategy Integration, said ratepayers shouldn't be held responsible for=20
high-priced power bought by the water department.=20
"They shouldn't pay for poorly negotiated contracts and market power abuses=

Woychik said. State officials contend they were gouged by wholesale=20

entering into long-term purchase contracts at prices that exceed current=20
spot-market prices. Woychik noted that the state is pursuing billions in=20

California selling surplus power at fraction of cost it paid =20

However, the surplus power selloff could encourage criticism that the state=

Since Californians haven't been running their air conditioners as often as=

there's suddenly more power than Californians can use.  Energy traders say=

the state has tried to sell as much as 6,000 megawatts at one time, Ackerma=
n=20
said.  That's around 16 percent of the 38,000 megawatts the state estimated=

it would use around this time of year, Ackerman said. A megawatt is enough=

electricity to power roughly 750 homes.  "We know from traders who have=20

as $5," Ackerman said. "When a seller shows up with an enormous amount of=

PUC reveals plan to transfer much of watchdog role =20

objattph=20
By Craig D. Rose  UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER  July 19, 2001  The California=
=20
Public Utilities Commission laid out a framework yesterday for transferring=

much of its watchdog role in ensuring fair electricity rates to the state=
=20
Department of Water Resources.  The controversial proposal is in response t=

legislation earlier this year that puts the water department in charge of=
=20
state power purchases. Utilities commission action is needed to ensure that=
=20
the water department has enough revenue to make the purchases and to clarif=
y=20
areas of responsibility, including oversight of power rates.  Under the dra=
ft=20
agreement made public yesterday, the commission would guarantee that=20
consumers pay enough to cover interest payments on a planned $13.4 billion=
=20
bond sale later this year. The guarantee is considered an essential element=
=20
for completing the bond sale.  The bonds' proceeds are needed to repay some=
=20
$8 billion the water department already has spent to purchase electricity a=
nd=20
to cover future payments.  California began buying electricity through the=
=20
water department earlier this year after the state's utilities were unable =
to=20
make purchases because of credit problems brought on by the state's failed=
=20
deregulation plan.  No mention was made in the draft agreement of the=20
possibility of further rate increases to cover electricity purchases. Some=
=20
observers have speculated that the current rate structure, even after two=

rounds of rate increases, may not cover all costs.  On the other hand, the=

draft agreement states that the water department itself will determine if t=

Under the utilities commission's procedure, the public is invited to commen=

=20
the draft before issuing a proposed decision. A full commission vote is=20
expected Aug. 23, a deadline that would have to be met if the bond offering=
=20
is to proceed as planned later this year.  Harvey Rosenfield, president of=
=20
the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, said the utilities=20
commission's draft agreement would allow a "secretive agency of dubious=20
competence controlled by the governor and completely unaccountable to the=

ot=20
us into the mess we are in today," Rosenfield said. "Now Wall Street is=20
demanding that the (utilities commission) be forced to surrender its=20
authority and legal responsibility."  He urged the commission to reject the=
=20
draft proposal.  Carl Wood, one of five members of the Public Utilities=20
Commission, said the draft agreement was driven largely by legislation=20
empowering the water department as an electricity purchaser. With a state=

California and Mexico are firing hopes for a new wave of industrial=20

are up and running, energy experts and Tijuana boosters say, the state will=

be able to make an unusual pitch to global manufacturers: Come to Baja=20
California, where power is plentiful, reliable and relatively cheap.  "It's=

Paul Boeker, a frontier that "opens up investment opportunities that aren't=

possible at the moment."  To seize the possibilities, Tijuana's Economic=20
Development Corp. is pushing the Baja California government to fund a study=

to identify the United States' biggest electricity and natural gas users. =

"When we saw the price of energy going up so high in California, we thought=

we might be able to use this as a marketing tool," said David Mayagoitia, a=

director of the development group.  The hope is that an influx of big-energ=
y=20
users, such as high-tech firms that operate clean rooms, will offset seriou=
s=20
problems in the region's sputtering maquiladora industry.  Since October,=
=20
Baja California has lost 11,700 maquiladora jobs, 4 percent of the sector's=
=20
total. In Tijuana alone, 7,600 positions have disappeared.  "I've never see=
n=20
so many large and small and medium companies narrow their operations in suc=
h=20
a short amount of time," said Deloitte & Touche accountant Mauricio Munroy.=
 =20
Maquiladora insiders like Munroy blame the U.S. economic downturn, rising=
=20
costs, a strong peso and a new Mexican regulatory regime for reining in the=
=20
operations.  Mayagoitia calls it a crisis.  "Our labor costs are going up.=
=20
We're not as competitive as other places in the world. We have to look for=
=20
other angles."  Over the past three decades, the arrival of foreign-owned=
=20
maquiladoras has pushed Baja California's population to 2.5 million and=20
transformed the state into one of the world's manufacturing hot spots. The=
=20
region now ranks as a top producer of televisions and other consumer=20
electronic products, and many other goods.  There are 1,287 factories in th=
e=20
state, employing 278,900 workers.  New operators continue to come. Since=20
October, when employment began dropping, 33 companies have established=20
factories in the state. Other companies, including Korean electronics giant=
=20
Samsung, the state's largest operator, are expanding.  But in the past nine=

months, the sector's growth has dropped below its routine double-digit rate=

Some companies, such as Sanyo and Day Runner, have shut factories. Others a=
re=20
threatening to. And so many have trimmed operations that Munroy said, "I=20
don't think we can feel comfortable the industry's going to recover."  But=
=20
now, California's energy crisis and cross-border power demands could alter=
=20
that picture. A natural gas pipeline and three power plants in the works wi=
ll=20
boost the state's electricity output by 2,200 megawatts. As much as 1,500=
=20
megawatts could flow to California consumers.  Additional plants are=20
anticipated. Mexican Energy Secretary Ernesto Martens has said there's no=
=20
limit to the number that could be built in Baja California. And California=
=20
and Mexican officials are considering recruiting energy companies to start=
=20
projects in Baja California.  Meanwhile, numerous companies -- El Paso and=
=20
Phillips, Sempra, Chevron and Chiyoda among them -- have expressed interest=
=20
in building liquid natural gas facilities near Rosarito and Ensenada. The=
=20
operations would convert into vapor form liquified natural gas imported fro=
m=20
other regions for use in Mexico and the United States.  Such projects could=
=20
give Baja California billions of dollars in investment, thousands of=20
construction and operating jobs, and a reputation as an energy-abundant pla=
ce=20
to do business.  "Large energy consumers could come down here, set up=20
operations and get a big break on their utilities," Mayagoitia said. =20
Previously, such operators have shunned Baja California.  "They've always=
=20
said electricity down here is not constant. There are too many fluctuations=
=20
on the line," Mayagoitia said.  While a bigger supply would overcome that=
=20
obstacle, other challenges must be met before the region can use energy as =
a=20
marketing tool.  At a San Diego Dialogue forum on energy last week, Boeker=

listed the key elements needed to attract the next wave of industrial=20
development to Baja California. As he sees it, they need at least one liqui=

also needs to make sure its business laws and regulations, which in the pas=

But in subsequent filings to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,=

SDG&E said it will earn $120 million from the contracts.  News of the=20
earnings brought a sharp response from Michael Shames, executive director o=

the Utility Consumers' Action Network, a San Diego-based group.  "What real=

belated revelation that SDG&E stands to earn substantial sums under the=20
contracts. Gwinn had said that SDG&E's customers should receive the benefit=

added that it was impossible to determine the full profit SDG&E had made fr=

reiterated the position yesterday that profit from the contracts belongs to=
=20
the company's shareholders. Van Herik declined to comment about terms of th=
e=20
power sales to the state.  The contracts, which were signed several years=

ago, allow SDG&E to buy relatively low-priced power. The utility has made=

money by reselling that power at a higher price.  The deal to clear the $75=

purchase SDG&E's transmission lines for about $1 billion.  The Office of=20
Ratepayer Advocates, a watchdog agency within the California Public Utiliti=

the Office of Ratepayer Advocates, said revelation of the $120 million in=

profits SDG&E expects to earn from the sale of power heightened "pre-existi=

"We have been working with members of both houses," Davis said. "I am=20

PUC May Cede Control Over Electricity Rates
Energy: Chief says letting the state water agency set prices would ensure=
=20
that ratepayers cover costs. Others say plan would leave public unprotected=

July 19 2001

SAN FRANCISCO -- California's chief utility regulator proposed Wednesday to=
=20
provide rubber-stamp approvals of any future electricity rate increases tha=
t=20
state power buyers find necessary.

This fundamental shift in the state's regulatory structure would bypass=20
procedures that currently protect the interests of consumers.

The proposed agreement between the state Public Utilities Commission and th=
e=20
state Department of Water Resources is designed to guarantee that consumers=
=20
pay enough to cover the purchase by the state of electricity for the 27=20
million people served by three financially troubled utilities.

Consumer payments will be used to repay bonds the state plans to float late=
r=20
this year. The bonds will be used to reimburse the state treasury for money=
=20
spent on electricity. The PUC is expected to formally ratify the agreement=
=20
Aug. 23.

A spokesman for the water department said that a historic rate increase in=
=20
March is expected to cover all of the agency's costs and that no new hikes=
=20
will be necessary.

But under the terms of the proposed agreement, if that expectation proves=
=20
incorrect and future hikes are needed, the PUC promises to adjust electrici=
ty=20
rates to meet the department's need for revenue within 90 days, or 30 days =
in=20
emergency situations.

"The ruling gives carte blanche to [the department] to do whatever they wan=
t=20
to do," said Richard Bilas, a PUC member appointed by former Gov. Pete=20
Wilson. "We don't have much control over them. I am uncomfortable with it."

If approved, the agreement would shift the oversight of electricity rates=
=20
from the PUC, an independent regulatory body whose members are appointed by=
=20
the governor, to a state administrative agency that is under the governor's=
=20
direct control.

S. David Freeman, Gov. Gray Davis' chief energy advisor, said the agreement=
=20
would essentially transform the state water department into "the equivalent=
=20
of a municipal utility" that has sole discretion to raise revenue from its=
=20
customers.

The PUC would only have the authority to "make sure that our math is OK, an=
d=20
we haven't gone out and bought the Brooklyn Bridge," Freeman said.

Already, however, the state's judgment in buying power has been questioned.=
=20
The Department of Water Resources has signed long-term contracts designed t=
o=20
ensure stable supplies. But critics have charged that those contracts have=
=20
locked the state into prices that are too high. Indeed, because of cool=20
weather and reduced demand by consumers, the state--at least temporarily--i=
s=20
buying more power than California needs and has begun reselling some of it=
=20
for considerably less than it costs.

In another energy-related development, a top executive of Southern Californ=
ia=20
Edison Co., one of the three utilities that has been flirting with=20
insolvency, criticized as inadequate a state Senate bailout bill.

The bill is a thoroughly rewritten version of a highly publicized deal Davi=
s=20
and Edison officials fashioned in April to restore the company's financial=
=20
health. That deal called for the state to buy the utility's transmission=20
lines for $2.76 billion.

At a hearing of the Senate Energy Committee, Bob Foster, an Edison vice=20
president, testified that the Senate version, which is expected to be voted=
=20
on this week, would leave Edison $1 billion short of meeting its financial=
=20
needs.

The problems of Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and San Diego Gas &=20
Electric Co. triggered the need for the deal between the PUC and the water=
=20
department. That agreement was hammered out in high-pressure negotiations=
=20
that involved dozens of state officials and bonding experts. It is viewed b=
y=20
state officials and bond analysts as critical to the sale this summer of th=
e=20
$13.4-billion bond issue.

But Harvey Rosenfield, president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consume=
r=20
Rights in Santa Monica, said the agreement would strip away the PUC's=20
constitutional obligation to protect consumers from unreasonable rate hikes=
.

"This is a power play by the Davis administration, the energy companies and=
=20
Wall Street to eliminate any public scrutiny over their conduct and the pri=
ce=20
of electricity for the next 10 to 15 years," he said.

The agreement is the latest step in implementing emergency legislation pass=
ed=20
this year to allow the water department to buy power. The agency stepped in=
to=20
the market after the three utilities said that rates frozen under the state=
's=20
deregulation plan were preventing them from recovering their costs and were=
=20
threatening their solvency.

Assembly Bill 1X, signed into law by Davis in February, provided that the=
=20
water department would be able to recover its costs and directed the PUC to=
=20
implement an agreement to accomplish that.

The agreement also would provide assurance to Wall Street that electric rat=
es=20
would provide a reliable flow of funds that could be used to pay off the=20
bonds. The state hopes to use the bonds to create a revolving fund that wou=
ld=20
pay for $8 billion in current and future power costs.

State Treasurer Phil Angelides said the rate agreement "must be adopted so=
=20
that the general fund can be repaid, and to protect the state's fiscal=20
solvency. . . . This agreement provides the assurance that, for the term of=
=20
the bonds, the law will be honored so that bonds can be sold and bondholder=
s=20
repaid."

Equally important is the water department's projection of how much revenue=
=20
the agency needs for everything from spot market power purchases and the co=
st=20
of long-term contracts to administrative costs and debt service. That=20
detailed assessment will indicate whether the increase approved in March--a=
n=20
average hike of 3 cents per kilowatt/hour--will be enough to cover the=20
department's costs for the two-year period ending Dec. 31, 2002. Officials =
at=20
the PUC and the department said the projection could be submitted as soon a=
s=20
Friday.

"We do not anticipate that [the department] will be seeking any further=20
increase beyond the increase announced by the PUC last spring," said=20
department spokesman Oscar Hidalgo. "We're well within the 3-cent increase.=
"

The department's statement of its revenue needs has ramifications not only=
=20
for consumers, but also for utilities. Utility officials fear that their ow=
n=20
costs might not be covered after the department takes its share of the=20
revenue from monthly bills.

PG&E spokesman Ron Low said the company's lawyers are assessing the propose=
d=20
agreement but would have no comment on it until they can see the water=20
department's revenue requirement. He said the company hopes there will be=
=20
enough left "to ensure our customers are treated fairly" and to cover the=
=20
company's costs, including payments for the power it produces and purchases=
=20
through contracts.

Edison officials said they would not comment until they received more=20
information.

The proposed agreement, though not unanticipated, would reduce the role of=
=20
the PUC in one of the most pivotal chapters of the energy crisis.

Normally, the PUC holds hearings and conducts "prudency" reviews before=20
making decisions on rate increases, but the water department would not be=
=20
subject to the same procedures.

"It will not be a review where we say you were imprudent, you goofed up and=
=20
will have to eat the cost, or you badly negotiated these contracts," said=
=20
Commissioner Jeff Brown, who was part of the negotiations.

Brown said the two agencies had differences over issues such as whether the=
=20
water department's administrative costs should be covered by the rate=20
agreement and the extent of the PUC's review. But he said the overriding=20
concern was that the state's bond sale not be delayed or otherwise=20
jeopardized by uncertainty about the water department's ability to meet its=
=20
financial obligations.

"I wish we were not in this situation," he said. "But when we started doing=
=20
purchases, the state was the only credit-worthy entity. We're swimming=20
upstream."

Commissioner Bilas said that although the bond sale is highly important, he=
=20
is concerned that the water department will not be subject to governmental=
=20
checks and balances because the department head reports directly to Davis.

"If the governor believes the director of [the department] is doing a bad=
=20
job, he can be removed," Bilas said. "But it is a matter of how much faith=
=20
you have in individuals rather than faith in a system."

Commissioner Carl Wood, one of Davis' three appointees on the five-member=
=20
commission, pointed out that the PUC was set up to protect the interests of=
=20
the customers of private utility companies with a monopoly. "When a public=
=20
agency takes over [the purchase of power], things like a prudency review do=
=20
not have the same meaning," he said.

PUC President Loretta Lynch, who published the proposed agreement and=20
solicited comment on it, could not be reached Wednesday.

Her legal advisor, Geoff Dryvynsyde, said the commission has to make a publ=
ic=20
policy choice that weighs the need to sell the bonds against its own=20
authority to set rates.

"There is lots to balance here," he said. "A really important consideration=
=20
is the bond deal, and the rate agreement is important to getting that done.=

The lights have stayed on this summer, but California residents are more=20

"People are less likely to look in the past for blame and more willing to=

blaming the people in charge now."=20
But Davis seems to be winning the high-stakes public relations battle he's=

percent of those surveyed chose Davis to 12 percent who chose Bush.=20
But when asked who is providing better solutions to the problem, 34 percent=

chose the governor compared with 8 percent who give Bush the nod.=20
BAD MARKS FOR BUSH
"The energy problem has hurt Bush," Baldassare said. "Very few people think=
=20
he's come up with good solutions."=20
Much of Bush's proposed energy plan runs contrary to California's=20
preferences. The president's program backs oil drilling in environmentally=

"I don't think Bush has his priorities straight," Eddy said. "He's not=20

If you've spent months squinting through dimly lit nights and still didn't=

Conserving enough electricity to get a refund from Pacific Gas and Electric=

replaced a handful of high-wattage bulbs, turned off her computer, and voil=
a=20
--=20
her electricity usage dropped 29 percent over last year.=20
That makes Crawford a winner in Gov. Gray Davis' new program that cuts 20=
=20
percent off the bills of customers who reduce their usage 20 percent.=20
Crawford's payoff: $6.09, less than the average residential rebate of $10.7=
8.=20
Like most winners, Crawford endured little hardship to receive a credit on=
=20
her bill.=20
"I hear all these stories about all these heroic things people did," Crawfo=
rd=20
said, "but I didn't really do anything special."=20
If only it were that easy. Nearly a third of PG&E customers have opened the=
ir=20
bills this month to find a credit for conserving, but many of the 71 percen=
t=20
who didn't are ticked. They complain that the program rewards watt hogs who=
=20
needed to conserve instead of the conservationists who have been doing the=
=20
right thing for years.=20
But that is of little consequence to the 510,000 PG&E residential customers=
=20
who have received $5.5 million in rebates so far. (The utility is nine days=
=20
through its 21-day billing cycle.)=20
Chip Gibbons knows how he's going to spend the $4.03 burning a hole in his=

Gibbons' secret: "My roommate moved out."=20

Some rebate winners were glad to see huge conservation investments pay off.=

Robyn Simonett dropped $700 on a new energy-efficient refrigerator to repla=

the 15-year-old model in her Berkeley bungalow. That, combined with keeping=

Her cash reward: $3.=20
"I went, 'Woo-hoo, yeah,' " Simonett said. "Hey, it's something."=20
Psychically, it's good to get cash back from PG&E after months of soaring=

If only Gretchen Beck had rebate cash to spend on cat box filler. She saved=

19 percent -- just missing the rebate threshold. She couldn't have done muc=

"No way," said the resident of San Francisco's Bernal Heights. "I'd unplug =

WATT WASTERS CASHING IN
Beck wasn't bitter about not getting a rebate. Some also-rans, however,=20
complained about the unfairness of rewarding watt hogs while overlooking=20
PG&E's good energy citizens.=20
Privately, one PG&E official said, "We tried to tell the governor's office=

that when they came up with this program."=20
"It's unfair to people who have been efficient all along," said Marc Acheso=
n,=20
an Oakland resident who bundled up, bought energy-efficient bulbs and did a=

the right things long before there was an energy crisis. The downside to=20
doing the right thing: Acheson doesn't think he'll get a rebate when his bi=

arrives.=20
"There should be something for people like my wife and I, who won't get a=
=20
refund. But I guess this program is meeting its target: people who were=20
wasting a lot."=20
A PAT ON THE BACK
Don't look to the governor's office for a reward for longtime=20
conservationists. Davis feels they've already received one.=20
"Their reward is the years of savings they've had for doing the right thing=
,=20
" said Davis spokesman Roger Salazar. "The governor considers them the real=
=20
heroes of this crisis."=20
Being called a hero is nice, but many customers said they would prefer cold=

Assembly panel OKs two bills to help Southern California Edison=20

Sacramento -- Two sharply contrasting plans to prevent debt-ridden Southern=
=20
California Edison from being dragged into bankruptcy cleared a key Assembly=
=20
committee last night, but a third measure stalled in the Senate.=20
The first bill approved by the Assembly Energy Cost and Availability=20
Committee calls for the state to purchase Edison's transmission lines for=
=20
$2.4 billion as a way to help the utility out of its estimated $3.5 billion=
=20
in debt.=20
The plan drew criticism from business and consumer groups, and many lawmake=
rs=20
who said other aspects of the rescue plan are too complicated wondered open=
ly=20
if it wouldn't be better to let the utility to go bankrupt.=20
But Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, an author of the bill, said=
=20
before the 11-to-9 vote that lawmakers have to work with legislation that i=
s=20
complicated and not entirely pleasing.=20
"If this was easy, or if this was simple, we wouldn't call it a crisis," he=
=20
said. "This is far beyond a problem or a policy that we can debate and as a=
=20
consequence the solutions are neither simple or easy."=20
After a day of furious activity, the close vote -- with some Democrats=20
joining Republicans in opposition -- may spell trouble when it reaches the=
=20
floor of the Assembly.=20
The Assembly Appropriations Committee approved the plan 12 to 6 late last=
=20
night, setting up a floor vote for today.=20
The second plan that cleared the Assembly committee would be a "straight=20
bailout," said its author, Assemblyman Rod Wright, D-Los Angeles. It was=20
approved 12 to 3. The Appropriations Committee did not take up Wright's bil=
l.=20
The state would back $3.5 billion in bonds issued by the utility and then b=
e=20
repaid through a $2-a-month charge for Edison ratepayers.=20
The Edison deal is considered a linchpin to getting the state out of the=20
power-buying business, something that is costing taxpayers upward of $50=20
million a day. If Edison joins Pacific Gas and Electric Co. in Bankruptcy=
=20
Court, there is no clear way out of the electricity-buying business for the=
=20
state.=20
Gov. Gray Davis has said that he hopes any rescue plan for Edison would be=
=20
used as a model for PG&E to get out of court and back into the power-buying=
=20
business.=20
Also, a Senate committee defeated another proposal after the company said i=
t=20
would not work. The bill would let the utility issue $2.5 billion in revenu=
e=20
bonds, to be repaid by ratepayers.=20
The Senate Energy Utilities and Communications Committee's 4-to-3 vote came=
=20
as lawmakers struggle to approve some kind of rescue plan before the end of=
=20
the week, when they are scheduled to start a monthlong recess. The bill=20
needed five votes to pass and the chairwoman of the panel said another vote=
=20
would be taken today.=20
Sen. Jackie Speier, D-Hillsborough, who abstained from voting in the=20
committee, said the bill was defeated because senators weren't prepared to=
=20
send it to the floor yet.=20
"The bill does not have broad support in the Democratic caucus," said Speie=
r,=20
who opposes the bill.=20
Edison objects to the bill by Sen. Byron Sher, D-Palo Alto, because it=20
contains no way for the company to pay back the other $1 billion it owes=20
generators. Bob Foster, an Edison vice president, said the goal of a rescue=
=20
plan is to remove the state from the electricity business and restore the=
=20
utility to creditworthiness.=20
"This bill can't do that," he said in a Senate hearing.=20
Sher's proposal would also give the state a five-year option to purchase th=
e=20
transition lines and would make the largest commercial businesses pay for a=
ll=20
of the debt.=20
Business groups and consumer organizations blasted the measure.=20
"We think you should spread the cost proportionally to all ratepayers," sai=

Dominic DiMare of the California Chamber of Commerce. "This is businesses=
=20
subsidizing residents. Everyone used energy during this time period that th=
e=20
debt was accrued, and everyone should pay their share."=20
Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights said consume=
rs=20
will see the cost in the end through higher prices passed on by businesses.=
=20
But Senate leader John Burton said the proposal by Sher was the only one th=
at=20
might be approved by the Senate.=20
"It's a fair, just and equitable offer," he said. "It puts the burden on=20

Unseasonably cool weather has turned the California power crisis on its hea=
d,=20
with recent energy shortages giving way to a glut that's prompted the state=
=20
to sell excess power at a loss.=20
In some cases, traders say, energy bought at an average of $138 per megawat=
t=20
is being sold for as little as $1 per megawatt.=20
State officials acknowledged selling excess power over the past week, but=
=20
disputed the prices. They said the sales are a blip during a long, hot summ=
er=20
and blackouts are still possible if the mercury soars.=20
"This is unusual, but it was anticipated, it is typical in the power buying=
=20
operation," said Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the Department of Water=20
Resources, which is in charge of buying power for three financially ailing=
=20
utilities. "It's better than doing nothing with surplus power."=20
The agency has spent the past few months arming the state with long-term=20
energy contracts while weaning itself away from buying high-priced power on=
=20
the last-minute electricity market.=20
Those contracts, along with the temperate weather and a boost in energy=20
conservation, mean there's suddenly more power than Californians can use.=
=20
Hidalgo acknowledged the state has been trying to sell as much as 20 percen=
t=20
of its daily megawatts, though he would not say at what price.=20
"We know from traders who have bought that it's gone as low as a dollar and=
=20
last week we know it was as low as $5," said Gary Ackerman, executive=20
director of the Western Power Trading Forum in San Jose.=20
Unlike natural gas, extra electricity cannot be stored and used later. Sinc=

Californians haven't been running their air conditioners as often as expect=
ed=20
over the past week, the state hasn't needed the entire 38,000 megawatts it=
=20
had figured it would need. A megawatt is enough electricity to power roughl=
y=20
750 homes.=20
The surplus power sell-off could encourage criticism that the state bought=
=20
too much power at too high a price in its haste to fend off blackouts.=20
"If the price is $138 on average for a month and you have to turn around an=
d=20
sell a chunk of it for a dollar, you're not going to look real good to a=20
number of people," Ackerman said. "I just don't think many people in=20
California truly understood what their state did when they stepped into thi=
s=20
business."=20
Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, said Ackerman has no=20
evidence of California selling power for $1 a megawatt. He said a=20
$25-per-megawatt price mentioned by California Energy Markets, a trade=20
weekly, was "much closer to reality."=20

(07-19) 00:11 PDT WASHINGTON (AP) --=20
The investigative arm of Congress demanded Wednesday that Vice President Di=
ck=20
Cheney identify all the industry leaders who helped formulate the Bush=20
administration's energy policy. Refusal could lead to a court fight.=20
The White House, which is reviewing the request, said it would work with th=
e=20
General Accounting Office to resolve the issue.=20
The GAO letter follows repeated refusals by the vice president's office to=
=20
provide names and titles of participants who met with the energy task force=
=20
chaired by Cheney.=20
Under the law, the GAO could sue if the Bush administration fails to supply=
=20
the data within 20 days.=20
This is the first demand letter ever issued by the GAO to the vice presiden=
t=20
of the United States, said Democratic Reps. John Dingell and Henry Waxman,=
=20
who directed the agency to review the task force's work nearly three months=
=20
ago.=20
The vice president's lawyer has told the GAO there were nine meetings of th=
e=20
task force and that staffers also met with many people to gather informatio=
n.=20
The result was an energy policy, announced May 17, that is aimed at=20
increasing the nation's supply of energy. It includes expanded oil and gas=
=20
drilling on public land and a rejuvenated nuclear power system.=20
White House spokeswoman Anne Womack said the letter is under review, and "w=
e=20
will continue to work with the GAO to resolve this issue."=20
The vice president's office "has continued on its course of secrecy and=20
obstinance," Dingell said in a statement.=20
"The White House should simply try telling the truth ... and stop hiding=20
information that Congress and the public have a right to see," said Waxman.=
=20
A top Cheney aide, Mary Matalin, said Waxman and Dingell should "stop wasti=
ng=20
taxpayers' money" with their confrontation with the vice president. "If the=
y=20
want to know what happened in the energy task force meetings, they need loo=
k=20
no further than the policy we sent to the Hill," she said.=20
The White House's position is that the GAO is entitled to information on th=
e=20
task force's costs, but that the congressional watchdog agency doesn't have=
=20
authority to ask for lists of those with whom the task force met.=20
Waxman is also pressing for a Justice Department investigation of Karl Rove=

Poll: Legislators, Davis blamed more than sellers=20

Despite months of loudly accusing electricity suppliers of price gouging an=
d=20
leaving the state in a terrible mess, Gov. Gray Davis and legislative leade=
rs=20
haven't convinced most Californians, a new poll suggests.=20
When the Public Policy Institute of California asked 2,007 adults this mont=
h=20
who was mostly responsible for the energy crisis, Davis and lawmakers were=
=20
blamed more than private power sellers.=20
Moreover, most of those surveyed said they preferred having businesses in=
=20
charge of producing and distributing electricity in California and that it=
=20
would be a bad idea for state government to take over that role.=20
``It means that the efforts to single out the power generators has really n=
ot=20
been very effective on the part of the governor or the Legislature,'' said=
=20
Mark Baldassare, who directed the non-profit research group's poll released=
=20
today. ``Californians look to a whole group of actors in this crisis as=20
playing major parts in the problem.''=20
The poll was conducted before the Mercury News reported Wednesday that the=
=20
state was selling costly surplus power at bargain prices, a move that had o=
ne=20
lawmaker calling for more details from the governor. It was one of a number=
=20
of recent instances in which state officials had to defend their own energy=
=20
dealings. And as they have done in the past, they responded by blaming=20
generators for most of the state's problems.=20
But today's poll heartened some electricity suppliers, who say they are tir=
ed=20
of the barrage of price-gouging allegations being leveled at them.=20
``Wow, maybe the public understands that this problem is a lot more complex=
,=20
which is what we've been saying all along,'' said Patrick Dorinson, of Mira=
nt=20
Corp., which has several major power plants in the Bay Area and is among th=
e=20
nation's biggest electricity suppliers. ``Maybe it also indicates that the=
=20

But some experts said the poll may simply underscore a misunderstanding abo=

power generators.=20
However, electric utilities companies were picked by 23 percent, even thoug=

private firms under the state's 1996 energy deregulation law.=20
Davis and other state officials have repeatedly accused private electricity=

Even some experts hired by the energy industry say it's easy for the public=

The way power is bought and sold in this deregulated energy marketplace=20
probably mystifies many, said Marty Wilson, who has polled about 6,000=20

Nevertheless, Wilson added that his polling also finds little support for t=

notion that power suppliers are primarily to blame. About 40 percent of tho=

Still, Davis isn't likely to ease up on his criticism of private power=20
suppliers. ``The governor will continue to point the finger at whoever he=

S. David Freeman, Davis' chief energy adviser, reiterated that point during=

Consumers to bear costs of state's power purchases=20
Posted at 10:30 p.m. PDT Wednesday, July 18, 2001=20
BY MICHAEL BAZELEY=20

Mercury News=20


State energy regulators have reluctantly signed away one of their most=20
fundamental consumer protection roles: the right to question and reject=20
requests for higher power rates.=20
Under a proposed rate agreement with the state Department of Water Resource=
s=20
released Wednesday, the Public Utilities Commission promises to pass all th=
e=20
state's power-buying costs directly to consumers.=20
Unlike its relationship with utilities such as Pacific Gas & Electric, the=
=20
utilities commission will not be able to audit the department's books or=20
question its expenses. And it will have just 90 days to raise rates if the=
=20
state concludes it needs more money.=20
``Previously, we had discretion to raise rates or not raise rates,'' said=
=20
Commissioner Jeff Brown. ``Here, we're in a situation where it's a bill --=
=20
pay it.''=20
The rate agreement, which the commission is expected to approve next month,=
=20
marks a sea change for the agency.=20
The commission has acted as a check against exorbitant energy rates by=20
reviewing utility costs and setting rates it deemed reasonable.=20
But now the state has stepped into the power-buying business, purchasing a=
=20
third or more of the energy used statewide. The state wants to finance its=
=20
costs with $13.4 billion in bonds but says it needs to guarantee investors=
=20
that consumers will repay them.=20
The agreement comes as no surprise. A state law passed in January says the=
=20
commission must set rates to cover the water resources agency's bills.=20
Nonetheless, some consumer groups are fuming.=20
``It is effectively a blank check for the state,'' said Doug Heller, of the=
=20
Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. ``Any costs the state incurs -=
-=20
whether it be consultants for Gray Davis or trips to Texas -- anything they=
=20
pass on is considered just and reasonable. That's deregulation on crack.''=
=20
Under the 17-page agreement, the Department of Water Resources will=20
periodically send a ``revenue requirement'' to state utilities regulators.=
=20
The regulators will use the document to set rates within the 90-day time=20
frame.=20
If the department starts to run short of cash -- because of dramatic spikes=
=20
in the price of power, for instance -- the commission could be forced to=20
adjust rates within 30 days.=20
The commission would have minimal discretion to challenge the state's reven=
ue=20
requests, according to the agreement, beyond pointing out ``arithmetic=20
error'' or costs not related to paying off the bonds or buying power.=20
State officials said they cannot sell the bonds if investors believe the=20
commission might reject any of the state's power-buying costs.=20
At the same time, they said, officials are scrutinizing every contract they=
=20
negotiate with power generators to make sure consumers are getting the best=
=20
deal.=20
``Every contract is critiqued within our department,'' said Oscar Hidalgo,=
=20
spokesman for the water resources department. ``And a lot of the=20
administrative costs are handled the same way.''=20
Under the new arrangement, utilities would still have to justify their cost=
s=20
when asking for a rate increase, but the state would not.=20
Whether rates will need to go up again soon is not clear. The commission ha=
s=20
already voted in two big rate increases this year, one in January and anoth=
er=20
in March. The state is expected to give the commission its latest revenue=
=20
requirement Friday. State officials say that, with falling power prices, th=
ey=20
do not see a need for higher rates.=20

Conservation is cutting edge of power crisis=20
July 19, 2001=20
By Jonathan Lansner
The Orange County Register=20
The Edison bill has arrived. It was almost as exciting a mailbox event as t=
he=20
seemingly regular arrival of a sweepstakes envelope.=20
Best of all, the bill said, "You won!" Well, it really didn't say that. But=
=20
it might as well have.=20
The family's electric bill did note that we sliced our electricity use by a=
=20
third from a year ago. Whoopee!=20
Because we conserved so well, we got a 16-buck rebate. Now, for full=20
disclosure, we sort of cheated. Thanks to a remodeling job in progress, we=
=20
have no air conditioner to abuse. But we weren't the only ones cashing in o=
n=20
conservation, so to speak.=20
According to Edison, 31percent of its residential customers in June took th=
e=20
conservation bait: Cut electricity usage by 20 percent, get a state-funded =
20=20
percent rebate.=20
For the month, 287,224 families in these parts got $2.5 million in rebates =
-=20
or nearly nine bucks a household. That's state taxpayer money at work.=20
Now that sum's no grand windfall. Nor does it fully negate the year's rate=
=20
hikes. But it generates spendable cash. And it's an important conservation=
=20
message.=20
Those 287,224 families earning a June rebate saved what seems at first glan=
ce=20
to be a smidgen of the state's monthly energy usage. You know, $2.5million=
=20
looks like pocket change when headlines talk of billion-dollar deals and/or=
=20
overcharges.=20
However, consider this math: That $2.5million would buy roughly 24,000=20
megawatts of electricity, using Edison's average cost of power this year.=
=20
Believe it or not, 24,000 megawatts is more than a half-day of typical=20
statewide use. Not bad conservation by customers of just one of three major=
=20
utilities in the state.=20
Then roughly double that figure because the state handed out nearly $3milli=
on=20
in June rebates to commercial users for their savings.=20
You know, this conservation thing is more than a sound bite. One reason the=
=20
lights have stayed on this summer in California to date is that demand is=
=20
down by as much as 12 percent.=20
Sure, the weather's unseasonably pleasant, keeping many air conditioners of=
f.=20
And a painful technology slump shuttered some energy-guzzling factories.=20
Nevertheless, the populace also is well aware of the higher energy costs.=
=20
Average Joes and Janes appear very willing to play the money-saving game.=
=20
Compact fluorescent light bulbs, ceiling or attic fans, and double-pane gla=
ss=20
aren't just home-improvement hype.=20
Forget politics. Forget finger-pointing. Please remember basic economics.=
=20
Price motivates consumers to action. Discounts typically lure crowds.=20
Surcharges usually scare off buyers.=20
The fact that nearly one-third of Edison's residential customers slashed=20
energy use in the face of nearly 40 percent rate hikes and a 20 percent=20
rebate carrot clearly proves that point.=20
Whine all you want about what caused the energy mess. Blame the incompetent=
=20
Sacramento crowd. Blame the bungling utilities. Blame the shady out-of town=
=20
generators. Heck, blame L.A.'s stealthy Department of Water and Power.=20
Nevertheless, when you talk solutions, conservation is the most logical=20
choice.=20

California's New Problem: Sudden Surplus of Energy=20
By JAMES STERNGOLD=20

07/19/2001=20
The New York Times=20
Page 1, Column 1=20
c. 2001 New York Times Company=20
LOS ANGELES, July 18 -- After months of warnings about power shortages and=
=20
forced blackouts, an unusually cool July and surprisingly effective=20
conservation efforts have put California in a stunning position: it has so=
=20
much electricity on its hands that it is selling its surplus into a glutted=
=20
market.=20
In fact, state officials said today, after spending much of the winter and=
=20
spring scrambling to line up new supplies of electricity at a cost of tens =
of=20
billions of dollars, the agency that is in charge of buying power has=20
actually been selling some back at a loss this week.=20
Oscar Hidalgo, the spokesman for the Department of Water Resources, which=
=20
became the state's main buyer of power after soaring wholesale prices pushe=
d=20
private utilities toward bankruptcy this year, would not provide exact=20
figures on how much the state was selling or how much money it was losing.=
=20
But the department has said it was paying on average $133 per megawatt-hour=
=20
this month, much of which it is obliged to buy whether it needs it or not,=
=20
under long-term contracts signed in recent months. By contrast, officials=
=20
say, the department at times has sold some of that power back into the mark=
et=20
at prices as low as $15 per megawatt-hour.=20
Mr. Hidalgo insisted that the surplus power could quickly vanish if=20
temperatures soar as expected in August.=20
Some consumer groups, which have bitterly criticized the state's energy=20
policies in the crisis, seized on the sales as evidence of what they said w=
as=20
a poorly thought-out plan that had left the state at the mercy of a mercile=
ss=20
market.=20
''This state agency has no expertise in trading,'' said Harvey Rosenfield, =
an=20
official at the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. ''It is=20
amateurish at best and sometimes incompetent, negotiating with a bunch of=
=20
M.B.A.'s whose goal is to soak California. The state was panicked into=20
leaping into this business, and it is being outwitted.''=20
But a spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis defended the state's purchases, saying=
=20
its response to an emergency has produced greater reliability and, in the=
=20
long term, a greater supply of power.=20
''Like we said all along, we're doing everything within our power to contro=
l=20
the situation and stabilize things,'' said Steve Maviglio, the governor's=
=20
spokesman. ''But the weather is not within our control. When the utilities=
=20
were in this business, they ran into this situation routinely.''=20
On Monday, for example, the high temperature in San Diego was 70 degrees,=
=20
compared with an average of 77 degrees. In San Francisco, the high was 66,=
=20
compared with an average of 72, and in Fresno it was 87, down from the=20
average of 99. That meant that air-conditioners across the state were turne=
d=20
down.=20
But officials said that the weather was not the only factor in relieving th=
e=20
sense of crisis in California and that the state's conservation program had=
=20
produced a significant reduction in demand.=20
The state energy commission has said that total demand was down 12 percent=
=20
this June from June 2000, adjusted for the weather and economic growth.=20
The conservation program provides rebates for buying certain energy-efficie=
nt=20
appliances and special discounts for large consumers that reduce their powe=
r=20
needs sharply from previous years.=20
In addition, state and federal office buildings have instituted conservatio=
n=20
measures, including turning off lights and computers at night and adjusting=
=20
thermostats.=20
Also, big rate increases, of as much as 40 percent in certain instances,=20
kicked in this June, encouraging consumers to cut electricity use further.=
=20
Some experts have warned that while a sense of crisis has helped produce th=
e=20
big reductions in demand, as soon as people feel that the emergency has=20
passed at least some will return to their old ways and demand may rise agai=
n.=20
According to the California Independent System Operator, which manages the=
=20
power system, peak demand today was expected to be 32,651 megawatts, and th=
e=20
available supply was slightly above 40,000 megawatts.=20
In January, the state suffered several power emergencies in which it was=20
forced to pay more than $1,000 a megawatt at times of critical shortages.=
=20
But even with those purchases, utilities were forced to cut power in some=
=20
places when the demand exceeded the supply. The last time the state had to=
=20
resort to blackouts was on May 8.=20
After the emergencies in the winter, the state frantically lined up power=
=20
purchases on contracts ranging from a few months to 10 years and more.=20
The state tried to put together a diverse portfolio of contracts that would=
=20
ease the shortages but not lock the government into paying too much if pric=
es=20
declined in the future. Energy experts expected some declines in prices but=
=20
not this quickly.=20
The Department of Water Resources paid an average of $243 per megawatt in=
=20
May, but the price has now dropped to $133 per megawatt on average this=20
month, some of that in the form of spot purchases and some under the=20
long-term contracts. Mr. Hidalgo said the department's sales of power back =
to=20
the market had been at $15 to $30 per megawatt.=20
Some energy traders said the state was just paying the price any market=20
participant must accept.=20
''They're not doing anything imprudent,'' said Patrick Dorinson, a spokesma=
n=20
for the Mirant Corporation, a large power generator and trader. ''They're=
=20
just finding out how the markets work. Everything is built on forecasting,=
=20
and sometimes the forecasts are wrong.''=20
Mr. Maviglio, the governor's spokesman, said the state's planning was built=
=20
on forecasts of a harsher summer and less conservation. ''The forecasts hav=
e=20
turned out to be far more conservative than the reality,'' he said.=20
Mr. Rosenfield countered: ''We've been outwitted. They goofed, and it looks=
=20
like taxpayer money is being thrown down the toilet.''=20
In May, the amount of power the state needed to buy on the so-called spot=
=20
market, which means purchases in which the electricity would be supplied=20
immediately, accounted for close to 45 percent of the total purchases.=20
Typically, longer-term contracts are at fixed prices, while spot purchases=
=20
can be enormously volatile.=20
But because of the reduced demand in July, spot purchases have made up just=
 5=20
percent or so of the Department of Water Resource's total purchases, and at=
=20
the times of lowest demand, like this week, officials have decided to get=
=20
what they can by reselling excess power.=20
''This is a normal business practice,'' Mr. Hidalgo said. ''We can buy powe=
r=20
and we can sell power. I don't think anyone would have predicted that we=20
would have found ourselves in this position in July. But we're not out of t=
he=20
woods. August could be raging hot.''=20

Hola!  Will you please take a look at this and let me know if you have 
suggestions?

We just got a new batch of shareholder resolutions (initiated by Friends of 
the Earth) because of Cuiaba.  As WWF told me, I guess it is "our Vietnam", 
even though they're pleased with the other actions we are taking...

FYI, I am also attaching the org chart we provided, which I think they have 
given the board.

Kelly,
Attached is the final version of the Board presentation that we need to send 
to Rebecca Carter and Terry West.  The only thing that has changes from the 
version we sent on Friday is I took out the parenthetical about 
industrialized countries in the upper left hand corner of the graphic as I 
thought it made it a little too busy and was extraneous information.
The last slide still has "placeholder" bullets under the "Expand Board 
Committee" - but you or Ken Lay can always explain the structure and scope in 
words.  

Rebecca asked me if "everyone had signed off on it - Steve Kean and all" and 
I said I would double-check before sending it.  Will you call me when you've 
reviewed this and then I'll be happy to send on the final version?
Thanks,
Catherine

The Business Coalition for Clean Air (BCCA) has formed a new Legislative 
Subcommittee to lobby for our alternative to the State Implementation Plan 
(SIP) about to be finalized by the Texas Natural Resource Conservation 
Commission.  Joe Allen will be on the committee locally, and Jeff Keeler will 
be on the Washington, D.C. side of the same committee dealing with federal 
SIP matters such as tax incentives and EPA intervention.  I will provide 
backup to Joe's participation and continue as chair of the economic impact 
group given a continuing need for new analysis as new scenarios are proposed 
and debated in 2001.

The BCCA alternative SIP has several key features:

 * 65 mph instead of 55 mph

 * no morning construction and lawn equipment ban

 * 80% reduction for point sources instead of 90%

 * no "boutique" fuel requirement before the federal fuel standard comes into 
effect in 2004.

The BCCA believes that these control measures are extremely costly and would 
lead to a no growth scenario for Houston and that, importantly, a more 
realistic modelling day reduces the amount of NOx reduction that the 
8-country area needs to achieve compliance by 2007.  [Barton Smith will speak 
to the economic analysis at a 12/13 (Wednesday) luncheon at the Hyatt 
downtown--I have a table if anyone would like to attend.)]

The Legislative group is hiring lobbyists in Austin to try to pass a 
legislative package as part of the alternative plan.  The major elements are:

 * tax incentives for on-road and off-road vehicles to clean up

 * money for new modelling studies to match federal funds received from Tom 
Delay

 * incentives and subsidies for new inspection/maintenance requirements; 
vehicle scrappage; low-income
   vehicle repair

 * a vehicle registration fee standard based on emissions

 * a later start for public schools (after Labor Day)

Finally, there has been very little movement by the TNRCC towards the BCCA 
alternative SIP with December 6th coming up, especially regarding choosing a 
new air modelling day or period.  Litigation could be likely.

Subject: 

Rick/Harry/Jim--- it's a tie this year for who is the worst player in the 
energy business---I can't decide which is more appalling---  Commissioner 
Ruth Kretschmer's blatant grab for her legacy or Commonwealth Edison's sleazy 
tactics. 

You'll recall that Com Ed has been trying to get accelerated collection of 
the decommissioning costs ($120 mil per year for 6 years) despite the fact 
tht they're planning on transferring their nuclear plants to an unregulated 
Genco.  The battle has been ongoing at the ICC, and the customers and CUB and 
other intervenors have been successful in getting the hearing examiner to 
state that Com Ed should not be able to collect any dollars if they transfer 
the assets.  Our hope was that the ICC would actually agree with the hearing 
examiner and deny the request, and that Com Ed would have to go to the 
legislature to get language that would allow them to collect.  The ICC has 
not ruled yet.  Anticipating that COm Ed would simultaneously work the 
legislative side,we have been working at the statehouse for about a month to 
sow the seeds to make sure that we could block them enough to get a trade 
such as a year or two of CTC early roll off.  The legislature is in veto 
session right now, and Com Ed has not been able to get enough backing to move 
a bill.

So....low and behold, a fax comes across this evening and it's a letter to 
the ICC from Com Ed offering to donate 2 of it's nuclear station sites to the 
citizens of Illinois to use as public parks after the sites are 
decommissioned if they are given the full $120 mil/6 year collection. And 
gee, do you think that maybe one of the parks would be named after the woman 
who brought it to the people!!??

There has been a rumor for about a year that Ruth had been angling with John 
Rowe to have one of the nuclear sites donated in her name, and she started 
ruminating in public and in semi public meetings about 6 weeks ago about the 
general concept.  

Part of me wishes that we didn't have any business interests that need 
protecting in Illinois, as I  really would like to give a quote to Crains or 
the Tribune tomorrow slamming Kretschmer and Com Ed. Isn't this just the 
height of arrongance and corruption??!!

I'll be sending out a general info e mail tomorrow on this development to the 
Project Lincoln team and of course Roy that is a bit more sanitized, but 
wanted you guys to know the real scoop (plus I think I just wanted to vent!)

Beyond the two excellent editorials in today's WSJ (attached) the following 
should be the key messages:

1.  The show was an aimless wander through the well-worn territory of 
blame-game politics, with a healthy dose of fear mongering thrown in.

2.  It should not surprise anyone that two Berkley-based journalists, working 
in conjunction with the New York Times, would ignore Econ 101 and suggest 
that the solution for California's energy crisis is to subject the entire 
nation to Roosevelt era New Deal regulations.  Such pinings have been 
abandoned over the past 65 years, but if the New York Times wants to stake 
out that position ... fine.  It will probably help sharpen the debate and set 
up a clear victory for the market when supply comes onstream and prices 
moderate.  (Much sooner than the decades of legal wrangling to return to New 
Deal regulations.)

3.  The show completely ignored the failings of California's political and 
regulatory leadership to moderate or even eliminate the crisis when they had 
a chance.

4.  Of the electricity consumed in California, less than 15 percent is 
generated by companies headquartered in Texas.  More than 50 percent of the 
electricity in California is generated by municipal entities that have been 
charging the same high prices as the Texas "pirates."  These good pirates 
include the Bonneville Power Administration, the Los Angeles Department of 
Water and Power, the Government of British Columbia, and the Sacramento 
Municipal Utility District.




Business World: California's Ship of Fools
By Holman W. Jenkins Jr.

06/06/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A27
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Lamenting the politician's lot in "Profiles in Courage," John F. Kennedy 
wrote that "In no other occupation is it expected that a man will sacrifice 
honors, prestige and his chosen career on a single issue." Of course, no 
politician would last long if he didn't blow with the wind nine times out of 
10. But on the tenth occasion even California has the right to expect some 
courage. 
We don't know what happens when an advanced economy like California's suffers 
day after day of blackouts. We may be about to find out. Modern office 
architecture becomes uninhabitable without air-conditioning and elevators. 
Old people and asthmatics may die in the heat. So may drivers at unlit 
traffic crossings.
Steps could still be taken to lessen the blackouts, but voters wouldn't know 
the difference, and it's so much easier to cast blame. Gov. Gray Davis prates 
about a "war with Texas." And who knows what secret failures as a human being 
led Bill Lockyer, the attorney general, to threaten Enron's Ken Lay with 
homosexual rape in the California prison system. 
California has found itself singularly lacking in heroes in its hour of 
crisis. Mr. Lockyer and Mr. Davis harp on price, but the true problem is the 
unavailability of power at any price to meet the demand that exists under the 
current structure of retail rates. 
Both must know the solution they noisily advocate, federal price controls 
slapped across Western electricity markets, wouldn't bring power into 
existence to close the gap. Their proposal would simply saddle the feds with 
the dirty job of apportioning blackouts from California's mistakes across 
half a dozen other states. 
In California itself, municipal utilities in Santa Clara, Palo Alto and other 
towns have already announced they won't participate in rolling blackouts. The 
Los Angeles Department of Water and Power certainly isn't volunteering. Why 
should voters in other states? Why not just cut the lines and let California 
monopolize the darkness? A state review board in Washington has already 
vetoed a proposed plant rather than suffer local pollution for power destined 
for California. 
Mr. Davis knows this; he knows price controls would create a new problem 
without solving the shortages. Meanwhile, the specter nobody wants to talk 
about is the state of California itself headed for bankruptcy if it continues 
to be willing to pay any price to satisfy the demand of consumers shielded 
from the true cost of power. 
Mr. Davis's version of the Big Lie is that Texas is to blame. Texas companies 
account for just 12% of California's supply, having bought 7,000 of the 
20,000 megawatts that local utilities were forced to sell under 
"deregulation." Being in the right place at the right time has always been 
profitable, but any windfall has been spread widely among suppliers of gas, 
pipeline capacity, storage and ancillary services. Take Enron: Its revenues 
quadrupled in the past year, but so did its costs, and profits are up only 
31%. 
A leaked California memo names as two of the biggest "gougers" BC Hydro, 
owned by Canadian taxpayers, and the U.S. Bonneville Power Administration. 
Their sin was letting their reservoirs fill up overnight while meeting local 
needs with spot-market power, so they could sell their own production for 
higher prices to California during the day. 
These are precisely efforts that might stop if price controls were imposed 
across the West, making the shortages worse, probably much worse. 
Northwestern smelters might be better off reclaiming the cheap hydro they've 
been passing on to California -- 3,000 megawatts, enough for two million 
homes. Farmers could resume irrigating. Seattle, Tacoma, Boise and other 
neighbors have all done what California has failed yet to do, hiking rates to 
curb demand. 
Rather than emulate them, Gov. Davis's peacock of an energy czar, David 
Freeman, babbles about "public power," the answer to a question nobody asked, 
the solution to a nonexistent problem. 
Prices of electricity and natural gas for future delivery are already falling 
as investors race to build new plants and pipelines to meet the state's 
future needs. Markets foresee the crisis ending without Mr. Freeman's antique 
New Deal schemes. What's been missing while folks like him ride their hobby 
horses, though, is the courage to take steps necessary to minimize the 
suffering this summer. 
One large source of untapped power is California's own small generators, 
known as qualifying facilities. Their fee scale is set by the state, but 
California couldn't even summon the political competence to keep them in 
business, so 3,000 megawatts sit idle. 
People have tried to attach all kinds of ideological baggage to the 
California mess, but we wouldn't be here if water flows in the Columbia River 
system weren't down 54% from normal. Last summer, California's fossil-fuel 
generators increased their output by a whopping 62% to make up the shortfall, 
mostly by running existing plants harder. 
Yes, there have been flaky prices, partly because, mysteriously, California 
continues to use a discredited computer program to book a large chunk of its 
power one hour in advance. But the flaky prices also represent a system 
pulling out all stops to save California from itself. 
We said back in December there's only one solution: Jack up rates to stop 
consumers trying to burn more power than the state can beg, borrow or steal. 
The only question was when Gov. Davis would find the courage. Hard to 
believe, but the price hikes his regulators approved in March are still on 
the drawing board and busily being watered down. 
Someone should point out to Gov. Davis that the author of "Profiles in 
Courage" wasn't endorsing career suicide but suggesting that politicians must 
husband their leadership for times when it really counts. Not a few people in 
public life understand this. Al Gore openly yearned for the day when he could 
justify the compromises and trimming he's done in his life. But Mr. Davis is 
perhaps too lost in the dark to understand he is blowing the whole reason to 
have a political career. 
What borders on the stupefying, though, is the failure of any other 
Californian of prominence to step forward and speak truth about the power 
crisis. By all rights Gov. Davis should be a political leper, yet he actually 
stands a microscopic chance of being re-elected because of the sheer poverty, 
in a state of 34 million people, of the Republican opposition. Arnold 
Schwarzenegger is looking better all the time.

REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
California Squeaks By

06/06/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A26
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

The California energy crisis is now more than a year old and Governor Gray 
Davis has done nothing but squeak at it. At first, he attacked out-of-state 
power generators for being pirates and marauders. But lately he has focused 
on FERC and President Bush, demanding that the federal government place price 
caps on the sale of wholesale power. He's even rustled up 10 economists -- 
including the dad of deregulation, Alfred Kahn -- to support him. 
Well, as most everybody knows -- including the economists who have come out 
in favor of them -- price caps don't work. If caps are set too low, (as 
politics often dictate), existing supply will shrink and demand will grow, 
making the situation worse. Even "correctly" set price caps will discourage 
additional supply and do nothing to moderate demand. The usual result is an 
aggravation of shortages and rationing. Indeed, the history of price caps, 
particularly during the energy crisis in the early 1970s -- when oil prices 
were capped and lines at gasoline stations were long -- bears this out.
The pro-price-caps argument however is a clever one. It rests on the notion 
that there is no "effective competition" in the California energy market. 
According to one of the 10 pro-price-cap economists, Paul Joskow at MIT, the 
energy market in California is characterized by inelastic demand and very, 
very tight supplies, which conspire to produce, at certain times, prices 
above those that would have obtained under competitive conditions. 
Mr. Joskow examined the California energy market during the summer of 2000, 
looking at market fundamentals (the broad forces determining supply and 
demand); he found that 25% to 30% of the wholesale prices of electricity 
during June, July and August cannot be explained by market fundamentals and 
should be attributed to market imperfections. 
As an argument for price caps, this is hardly overwhelming. Especially since 
there are several perfectly respectable and compelling reasons to look no 
further than market fundamentals. Such as the fact that the price of the most 
important input for almost half the electricity generated in California, 
natural gas, has been rising over the past year. Such as the fact that 
natural gas pipelines are filled to capacity, thus bidding up the price to 
transmit. Such as the fact that the worst drought in the Northwest in 60 
years has reduced the amount of hydroelectric power in the market, putting 
even more demands on natural gas generation. Such as the fact that imports 
into the state, which were running 20% and up to 25% during peak usage, have 
declined. And the fact that the price of tradable permits for NOx emissions 
-- which must be held by plants generating electricity -- has skyrocketed. 
Not least the fact that demand in California during the past several years, 
unfettered by rate increases, has zoomed dramatically. 
At any rate, electric power is increasingly expensive all over the country; 
indeed, California's neighbors, the states of Washington, Idaho, Wyoming, 
Arizona, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Montana, have had to bump up utility rates 
30% to 50%. So where is the tablet of stone saying that California, with its 
especially restrictive environmental regulations, should be any different? 
The bad news for California is that, poor dears, it can't be different. 
Market fundamentals, like supply and demand, rule. But that's also the good 
news. High wholesale prices (and necessary profits) have done their job; they 
have brought forth a number of suppliers, in the form of more than a dozen 
plans for significant new generating plants; in fact, plans have even been 
announced to build more natural gas transmission pipelines. Too, demand has 
started to abate; peak demand on a monthly basis has fallen 4% to 9% from 
last year, doubtless a response to a "temporary" 10% rate hike in January and 
the California Public Utilities Commission's decision in March to finally 
really, really raise rates by as much as 50% on average. (The details of that 
plan were announced in May and rate increases will show up on this month's 
bills.) 
So California's blame-shifting pols can point fingers til the state freezes 
over. The market is working, and imposing price caps would not only interrupt 
that process, but would be unnecessary. Of course, there is a painful lag 
between the market signals of high prices due to shortages and the market 
remedies of increased supply and lower demand. And California will probably 
feel lots of that pain this summer in the form of continued high prices and 
blackouts. 
But, in the long run, the market will be successful in creating new supply 
and lower prices. Unfortunately California's energy glut will probably come 
too late to avoid a siege of political spinning and demagoguery. Ultimately 
we have to hope Californians will understand it is their politics that has 
served them poorly.

Hi Steve,

Thanks again for meeting with me last week about ideas for saving money on 
Enron's videos.

You asked me whether or not our new "Pro-Sumer" field production equipment 
can download directly into e-mail.  The answer is yes and no.  The camera has 
a feature that will enable us to play back still pictures into e-mail or file 
storage.  We do not, however, have technology that will enable us to download 
moving video straight from the camera into a computer.  As far as we know, 
you still need to encode video for computer applications.  Now that we know 
that's something you're interested in doing, we'll keep our eye on the 
technology and let you know when it has been developed.

I talked with Mary about the ideas I presented to you, but have not yet 
talked with Mark Palmer.  I'm planning to send him an e-mail this afternoon.

I forgot to mention one thing to you about the "creative piggybacking" 
money-saving idea:  using a contractor to coordinate/piggyback video shoots 
is exactly what Microsoft does.  When we interviewed Steve Ballmer in 
January, we went to Microsoft's facilities and used Microsoft's crew.  Then 
they invoiced us for a whopping $1800.00 (for fewer than 15 minutes of 
shooting time).  

Steve, I hope that as your thoughts progress about Enron's video needs, 
you'll consider me to be part of the team.  I would like to help develop and 
be a part of the solutions.  

Beth Stier

This was posted today in the Idea Vault.  We've bounced it around (Karen, 
Mary, etc.) and we'd like to run it past you.  It would be nice if Enron 
contributed to the solution -- since we've contributed to some of the 
problem!  Mary says perhaps you could bring this up at the next Executive 
Committee meeting.

Thanks.

Traffic Relief (Category: Best Practices)
Enron needs to do its part to relieve frustration with downtown traffic. The 
downtown street project and construction of Enron Center South have collided 
to create an unbelievable traffic problem. Enron should strongly encourage 
flexible work schedules during this period.

How the idea benefits Enron:
Enron employees will be much less stressed and more productive as a result.

Target audience and value:
Enron upper management needs to offer incentives to departments with the most 
creative and effective flexible work schedule.

Competition:
None.

Time, technology, resources required to develop idea:
The creativity for creating flexible work schedules from telecommuting to 
4-day work weeks will come from existing employees. No additional resources 
are required.

Challenges and risks involved:
Our challenge is to continue to produce high quality results. The risks 
involved could vary from underscheduling of resources (due to unplanned off 
duty)to slower response times for dial-in telecommuters.

Electricity Crisis Puts PG&E in A Cash Bind
Utility is borrowing $1million per hour 
David Lazarus and Christian Berthelsen, Chronicle Staff Writers
Tuesday,?December 12, 2000 
,2000 San Francisco Chronicle 
As California struggled yesterday with an unusual winter power crisis, 
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. warned that it soon could run out of money to 
buy electricity for its 4.5 million customers. 
"The credit situation is getting much tighter," said Greg Pruett, a spokesman 
for the San Francisco utility. "There will come a time when we won't be able 
to buy power for people. This is going to happen more sooner than later." 
The danger for PG&E is that financial institutions will stop lending the 
utility money to cover its expenses. Northern California's power undoubtedly 
would continue to flow, but it is unclear who would pay for it or how. 
Meanwhile, the state's energy shortage eased slightly as PG&E's Diablo Canyon 
nuclear power plant, which had been closed for repairs, returned to operation 
ahead of schedule. 
The, which oversees the power grid, declared a Stage 2 emergency alert late 
yesterday afternoon when reserves fell below 5 percent of total capacity. 
Power subsequently was cut to some industrial customers on a voluntary basis. 
State officials had warned last week that a Stage 3 alert might be called if 
as much as a third of California's generating capacity remained down for 
repairs. A Stage 3 emergency allows utilities to initiate "rolling blackouts" 
to relieve pressure on the system. 
Milder-than-expected weather and the return to service of Diablo Canyon 
prevented the situation from getting out of control, officials said. 
But for PG&E, there is no relief in sight for what the company characterizes 
as a financial disaster in the making. 
UTILITY $4.6 BILLION IN DEBT 
As of the end of November, Pruett said, PG&E had racked up about $4.6 billion 
in charges buying power on the wholesale market -- charges that the utility 
was unable to pass along to customers because of a rate freeze. 
"Every hour that goes by means we're in debt a million dollars more," Pruett 
said. 
Although this may be the case, PG&E's gloom-and-doom stance can be seen as an 
attempt to prod California regulators into lifting the current rate freeze 
and allowing the utility to hit customers with billions in unforeseen costs. 
Last week, the state Public Utilities Commission ruled that PG&E had not met 
requirements for lifting the freeze and must continue swallowing extra costs 
incurred in the volatile wholesale power market. 
PG&E'S STOCK PRICE FALLS 
This is playing havoc with PG&E's finances. The company's stock fell 7 
percent to $21.94 yesterday after several leading brokerages issued 
pessimistic outlooks for PG&E's profitability. 
The utility predicts that it could be as much as $6 billion in the hole by 
the end of the month. 
"This situation cannot go on indefinitely," Pruett said. "The price of retail 
electricity needs to rise." 
Consumer activists expressed sympathy with PG&E's plight but insisted that 
the utility remains responsible for all expenses incurred as California 
proceeds with deregulation of the state's power market. 
"Consumers should not bail them out for the rate freeze," said Nettie Hoge, 
executive director of The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco. 
"But going forward," she added, "we need to get wholesale prices under 
control. Otherwise this is a perilous concern for everyone." 
Hoge said she hopes PG&E's implicit threat of potential bankruptcy will get 
the attention of federal regulators. 
She said federal regulators will have to impose limits on California's 
wholesale power rates to prevent the sort of price increases that resulted in 
higher bills for some over the summer. 
Wholesale electricity prices are now 16 times higher on average than in the 
spring. Prices surged over the summer as the supply of available juice was 
unable to keep pace with demand. They have remained high ever since. 
Wholesale prices jumped yesterday after the ISO lifted a $250-per-megawatt 
rate limit late Friday to discourage power companies from selling electricity 
elsewhere. 
But the move appeared to have some immediate unintended consequences. 
$600 PER MEGAWATT WHOLESALE 
The wholesale price of a megawatt hour of electricity on Monday was anywhere 
between $600 and $800, and an official at the ISO acknowledged the agency did 
not foresee prices reaching that level. 
"We didn't think it would go that high," said Patrick Dorinson, a spokesman 
for the agency. 
In addition, while lifting the cap did encourage more generators to put bids 
on the market, most of them were in the south. Because the distribution 
system cannot handle a large volume of electricity moving south to north, 
where demand is highest, the bids were of limited benefit. 
Asked whether the bids managed to drive up the cost of electricity without 
meaningfully augmenting supply, Dorinson declined to comment. 
DAVIS' PREDICTION COMES TRUE
Gov. Gray Davis protested the ISO's decision to the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission on Friday night, saying an end to the rate limit would do more 
harm than good. 
"I suspect that, sadly, his prediction has come true," said Steve Maviglio, a 
spokesman for the governor. 
Last night, the California Power Exchange, which coordinates the state's 
wholesale power market, asked the federal commissioners to overturn the ISO's 
decision. 
Ending the rate limit, exchange officials said, "threatens to bring dire, 
irreparable and unintended consequences to the California markets." 
About a quarter of California's generating capacity was offline as plants 
throughout the state remained down for both scheduled and unscheduled 
maintenance. 
The Public Utilities Commission is expected to issue its findings this week 
after a series of surprise inspections of idled plants last week. 
Loretta Lynch, the president of the PUC, said the inspections were merely a 
form of "information gathering," but she stressed that it was unacceptable 
for so many plants to be down at the same time. She called for a system to be 
developed to better schedule maintenance. 
Federal regulators are expected to draw up a blueprint for overhauling 
California's energy market this week.

Attached is the draft for the December agenda. The scenarios and attendees 
are a strong move in the direction of commodities, with less energy focus. I 
think this might be the right direction to go in though. Let me know your 
thoughts ASAP because we need to get moving on speakers. 

Thanks, MSA

NEWS RELEASE
News Media Contact: For Immediate Release
Hedley Burrell 

December 8, 2000
(202) 208-0680 Docket Nos. ER01-607-
000; EL00-95-000; EL00-98-000

COMMISSION MOVES TO BRING RELIEF TO CALIFORNIA
ELECTRICITY MARKETS

In response to emergency conditions that exist in the California electricity
markets, which have faced supply shortages and snowballing prices, the 
Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission today approved a price cap change requested by the 
California
Independent System Operator (ISO). The Commission also took steps to permit
qualifying facilities (QFs) to operate at full capacity.

The ISO's purchase price cap of $250/Mwh will be lifted. Bids above that 
amount
will be allowed but will not set the clearing price paid to all sellers, as 
does the current
purchase price cap. This should attract more bids and alleviate chronic 
supply shortages.
Those bidding above $250 will be required to report their bids to the 
Commission
on a weekly basis and provide certain cost information.

The non-profit ISO and PX began operations in California in 1998. The PX is 
the
scheduling coordinator for the IOUs as well as other market participants. The 
ISO
operates and controls most of the transmission system in California.

In addition to the $250 purchase price cap, the Commission also authorized the
ISO to penalize participating generators that refuse to operate in response 
to an ISO
request in an emergency. They will be charged an amount equal to twice the 
highest
price the ISO paid for energy for each hour in which the participating 
generator failed to
respond.

The ISO's costs of obtaining energy through bids above the purchase price cap 
or
through out-of-market dispatches will be assigned to scheduling coordinators 
who
depend too much on spot markets.

The Commission's second order enables QF entities to generate at full capacity
which in the past could have caused them to lose QF status. QF generators are 
small
power producers that use alternative fuels, such as solar or biomass, and 
cogenerators
that produce both electricity and steam for commercial use.

The order on QF entities was in response to a request from a California QF.
The orders are effective immediately.

What I meant by the term "electric disconnect", which I thought was catchy 
but may have been inartful, was simply that supply and demand signals were 
screwed up.  This is the "Shelly Corman" argument, which may or may not have 
any factual basis, but I put it in there to have it in front of people for 
discussion.

Given the way the numbers came out, I guess we don't need the talking points, 
but we should still try to get to the bottom of this because we will be 
called on to comment to regulators and media.  Unless we have strong evidence 
to the contrary, it seems to me that wholesale markets are working .... they 
are open and they are competitive.  On the other hand, retail gas markets 
suffer from the same problems as electric markets ... they are not open, 
customers don't have effective choices and price signals don't get through, 
so there is no demand response when prices rise.  

On the points raised in the attachment, I'm still not sure I follow point 4.  
Also what does" electric disconnect" mean?

Leslie:  Looks good.  Just a couple of comments:

1. General
May want to point out that the roots of California's current gas woes are the 
same ones causing the electric problem---combined effect of California's 
"import-based" energy policy and the state's failure to invest in in-state 
infrastructure.  California imports about 25% of its electricity, but about 
80-90 percent of its gas supply.  California has failed to invest in the 
in-state infrastructure necessary to support increased gas demand over the 
last decade.  So we've got an interstate pipeline superhighway to the border 
and a dirt road of in-state transportation once you get into California.
The last bullet seems to suggest that manipulation may be taking place.  Can 
we support that suggestion, and is it one that we want to make necessarily?  
If we do suggest that manipulation may in part explain current prices, do we 
need to propose ways to eliminate it?  Otherwise, seems that we may be giving 
FERC ammunition to take action without trying to "steer" that action in the 
right direction.  Maybe I'm reading too much into the bullet.

2. Specific
Competition for gas coming to California has increased significantly.  The 
midwest (via Alliance) is competing away Canadian gas.  The Southwest 
(Nevada, Arizona) is competing away supply from the Southwest before it hits 
the California border.

Polish Grid Operator Sees 6-Month Delay To Balancing Mkt

12/12/2000
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

  WARSAW -(Dow Jones)- An hourly balancing market in Poland's electricity
sector - the key to an open market - won't come into operation until
July 1, 2001, six months later than originally scheduled, grid operator
officials told Dow Jones Newswires Tuesday.

  "Tests are still going on in the introduction of (information
technology) software for all entities involved in the balancing market.
We expect a test period of six months as of Jan. 1 and for the system to
'go live' in July 2001," said Marek Zerka, deputy president of Polish
grid operator Polskie Sieci Elektroenergetyczne.
  Industry insiders say an hourly balancing market is essential for the
effective functioning of a liberalized electricity market in Poland.

  "Without an hourly balancing market, trade in the whole sector won't
function properly," Wladyslaw Mielczarski of Energoprojekt-Consulting SA
told the EuroForum conference in Warsaw recently.

  The chief benefit of the hourly balancing market is that it would push
both generators and distributors to develop more sophisticated
purchasing and risk management strategies, which in turn would increase
trading volumes on the Polish Power Exchange, or Polpx, analysts said.

  The introduction of a fully functioning hourly balancing market would
end PSE's current practice of setting monthly prices for balancing
market electricity on the basis of estimated demand for the following
month.

  Analysts say this is a cumbersome and inaccurate procedure, in which
physical supply of electricity and the financial settlement of accounts
only roughly correlates.

  PSE and a group of companies, including Polpx and the power plants
Elektrownia Dolna Odra and Elektrownia Patnow-Adamow-Konin, started
testing computer systems for the balancing market Oct. 1, and tests are
ongoing, Zerka said. Officials at Elektrownia Dolna Odra said the power
plant was technically fully prepared for the Jan. 1 start.

  However, Zerka said there were some technical teething problems with
Polpx's software, and uncertainties related to the compatibility of
software used by different entities.

  Zerka said the hourly balancing market will be based on the
"pay-as-bid" system used in the U.K. This means that participants will
need a risk management and trading strategy in place, and can't continue
basing their sales or purchases on marginal costs, said analysts.

  Until the balancing market starts operating in July, PSE will continue
to draw up monthly coordination plans. Many analysts say the low volumes
the power exchange has had since its inception in July are largely
caused by problems of inaccuracies in the monthly settlement of physical
flows.

  Polpx recently said it needs at least 4% of total domestic turnover to
break even, and up to 7% before it can start thinking about introducing
forwards and derivatives markets in the Polish electricity sector.

  It has around 1% of total turnover today, and the delay in setting up
the balancing market means that bigger volumes won't come about until
the second half of 2001, insiders said.

President's Statement Regarding a Multilateral Initiative On Steel
 
WASHINGTON, June 5 /U.S. Newswire/ -- The following was released today by the 
White House: 

STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT 

This Administration is committed to free trade as an engine of growth. As 
part of our free trade agenda, we are committed to ensuring that American 
industry and American workers can compete on a level playing field. That is 
why, today, I am announcing my intent to launch an initiative to respond to 
the challenges facing the U.S. steel industry. This initiative will be 
designed to restore market forces to world steel markets and eliminate the 
practices that harm our steel industry and its workers. 

The U.S. steel industry has been affected by a 50-year legacy of foreign 
government intervention in the market and direct financial support of their 
steel industries. The result has been significant excess capacity, 
inefficient production, and a glut of steel on world markets. 

My decision to pursue this initiative comes after extensive consultations by 
Members of the Cabinet with our industry, our steelworkers, and interested 
Members of Congress. We have discussed the challenges facing U.S. steel 
manufacturers, and we understand that we have a critical stake in a healthy 
U.S. steel industry. 

Thus, I intend to take the following steps. First, I am directing the United 
States Trade Representative, in cooperation with the Secretary of Commerce 
and Secretary of the Treasury, to initiate negotiations with our trading 
partners seeking the near-term elimination of inefficient excess capacity in 
the steel industry worldwide, in a manner consistent with applicable U.S.  
laws. 

Second, I am directing the U.S. Trade Representative, together with the 
Secretaries of Commerce and the Treasury, to initiate negotiations on the 
rules that will govern steel trade in the future and eliminate the underlying 
market-distorting subsidies that led to the current conditions in the first 
place. Absent strict disciplines barring government support, direct or 
indirect, for inefficient steel-making capacity, the problems confronting the 
U.S. steel industry and the steel industry worldwide will only recur. 

We see these negotiations and the goal of restoring market forces as being in 
our interest and in the interest of our trading partners and their steel 
industries. That is why we would like to work cooperatively with our trading 
partners in pursuing this initiative. 

Third, I am directing the U.S. Trade Representative to request the initiation 
of an investigation of injury to the United States industry by the 
International Trade Commission under section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974. 
This action is consistent with our WTO obligations. 

This three-part strategy, coupled with further restructuring of the U.S. 
industry, should help the industry meet the challenges it faces. I look 
forward to working together with the industry, the steelworkers, Congress, 
and our international trading partners in support of this important 
initiative.

I attach the latest stats for the website. We are still getting an average of 
over 500 visitors per day, with an average stay of about 11 minutes.



I also attach links to the proposed additions to the website for this month.

We are adding two new educational sections describing risk management and 
weather derivatives and a new calculator to give consumers an ability to 
calculate how much their electricity costs will increase as fuel prices 
increase. We have also improved the navigation around the site.

A feature article comparing the dereg experience in the telecom sector and 
the tactics used by the incumbent monopoly NTT with the electricity sector 
will follow shortly.

kind regards

SK - I printed this & put it & attachments in your meeting folder.  mm

Alan Comnes will fax to your attention the EIA reports on Wyoming.  Susan 
Landwehr has faxed to you Gov. Geringer's statement before Congress and other 
pertinent materials.  We are searching for a recent presentations by Belden 
in Santa Fe.  Attached is a presentation Tim made re:  power supply that is 
somewhat out of date--note date of 8/14/00.  



Sue Landwehr will also prepare a briefing paper for you on the Gov. including 
a summary of the positions he has taken recently at WGA and RGA functions.  

Attached is a presentation prepared by Steve Walton on transmission 
activities in the West.  While I did not present Steve's slides, I used them 
as an ouline for remarks I made at the last WGA meeting on transmission.  
Gov. Geringer participated in the meeting and appeared to agree with our 
approach for adding transmission in congested areas.



I've also attached a copy of a presentation put together by Jeff Dasovich on 
energy needs of the high tech industry.  He prepared these at your request 
last fall.  






Have a good weekend.

In early 1999, Kitchen and her co-workers started to build an Internet=20

"EnronOnline came from the bottom up," said Lay, 58. "There wasn't any=20

The strategy has worked. When Greg Whalley came across Enron's job posting =
at=20
Stanford Business School back in 1992, he did a double take. How could a ga=
s=20
pipeline firm, he thought, offer such opportunities? Recruiters told him he=
=20
would have the chance to begin a new business within the company.
After several interviews, he landed in Houston with 10 other analysts. Ther=
e,=20
he rotated from the finance group to derivatives marketing and finally to t=
he=20
gas trading floor.
"It was an interesting place to be =01) in a company that's ready to recogn=
ize=20
and promote people that (are) brought in at relatively junior levels,"=20
Whalley said. At 38, he's now president and chief operating officer of Enro=
n=20
Wholesale Services, a major profit center.
Despite the tight labor market, the associate analyst program now brings in=
=20
300 to 400 new MBAs every year. Enron has also achieved an employee attriti=
on=20
rate of just 4% the past few years.
"Getting the best and brightest people is in fact the key to any successful=
=20
company," Lay said. "It's a matter of creating a culture where they feel li=
ke=20
they do have a lot of authority and flexibility in how they do their jobs, =
as=20
long as they do them well. I also think bright, creative people like to be=
=20
around bright, creative people."
Lay's success also stems from his belief in the power of markets. When the=
=20
Missouri native went to work as an economist at the Federal Energy Regulato=
ry=20
Commission in the 1970s, he battled against a system that fixed prices at=
=20
artificially high levels and restricted pipelines from sending natural gas =
to=20
places that actually needed it.
At Transco Energy Co. in the 1980s, he helped pioneer the spot market for=
=20
natural gas.
As the natural gas industry began to deregulate in the 1980s, prices fell=
=20
fast. But Lay and Skilling took advantage of the changes by creating a=20
wholesale market to buy and sell natural gas across the nation's pipeline=
=20
network.
Lay expects co-workers to do the same in other markets. To spread the=20
message, every elevator inside Enron's office tower has TV screens that=20
stream announcements, live news and slogans to encourage employees, such as=
:
"Join the fight against innovation's greatest obstacle: SILENCE."=20
"Your name doesn't have to be Catherine or Alexander to achieve greatness."
"EVERYONE is the next CEO until proven otherwise."
Many have taken the words to heart. David Cox, who once worked in the offic=
e=20
basement as a $5-an-hour graphics clerk, developed a financial product so=
=20
that newspaper publishers could hedge against volatile paper prices. It's n=
ow=20
a multi-billion-dollar market. Another employee pioneered a market for=20
utilities to trade pollution rights.
But when a team fails on a new project, Lay avoids punishment. Instead, he=
=20
dares team members to try again and again until they succeed.
In 1997, Enron bought Portland, Ore.-based power distributor Portland Gener=
al=20
Electric in hopes of selling power to residential customers in the=20
deregulated California market. But the Enron Energy Services team's strateg=
y=20
didn't work, and Enron has put PGE up for sale, a move Lay admitted was=20
highly embarrassing.
No one got fired. Lay asked team members to apply their strategy to somethi=

The team worked on selling power to manufacturers and commercial firms. It=

also came up with an idea to promise customers lower energy costs by=20

Team Management Approach Improves Wachovia Funds' Rank
By Christiane Bird

Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Switching to a team management approach has helped=
=20
Wachovia Funds outperform its peers, its managers say.=20
In 1997, the company's flagship fund, the large-cap Wachovia Equity Fund,=
=20
returned 25.1% - a respectable enough number, but in that high-flying year =
it=20
placed the fund in only the 74th percentile among its peers, according to=
=20
Morningstar Inc.
This year, although the fund has returned a mere 1.72% through Dec. 11, it=
=20
has risen into the 19th percentile slot.=20
Chalk up the improvement, the company says, to a switch from the traditiona=
l=20
senior manager/junior analyst portfolio structure to one in which managers=
=20
and analysts work together on an equal footing in cooperative teams.=20
"Our 1997 performance was not superlative and so we took a look at our core=
=20
equity product, and found that there was just too much information for one=
=20
manager to get his mind around," said Timothy Swanson, head of equities for=
=20
Wachovia Funds. "The fruit that came out of that was a new management=20
structure" instituted in mid-1998.=20
The Wachovia fund now uses a six-team system, with each team covering one=
=20
segment of the market -- technology, finance, industrials, health care,=20
resources-oriented companies and consumer staples and telecommunications. T=
he=20
teams work primarily on the Wachovia Equity Fund, but their research is=20
applied to the company's nine other equity funds as well.=20
Coordinating the teams is Swanson, and overseeing all the Wachovia funds is=
=20
Steven Reynolds, the company's chief investment officer.=20
"They've clearly been doing something right -- they've been in the right=20
places," said Catherine Hickey, an analyst at Morningstar, who follows the=
=20
Wachovia Balanced Fund and the Wachovia Special Values Fund. Both funds wer=
e=20
up in 1998 and 1999, she noted, but are not performing so well this year.=
=20
Wachovia's new structure allows managers and analysts to develop greater=20
expertise in their respective sectors and come up with better ideas, its=20
managers claim. "The stock selection process is where this structure has it=
s=20
competitive edge," said Swanson.=20
The team approach also works well in different types of markets, he noted.=
=20
Last year, when technology stocks were skyrocketing, the fund returned=20
26.15%, placing it in the 21st percentile among its peers, according to=20
Morningstar. And in this year's volatile marketplace, the fund has done wel=
l=20
because it no longer relies on just one manager. "It's as if we have six=20
different funds," Swanson said. "Over time, each team plays a hot hand and =
we=20
have more hot hands than any one manager could."=20
To develop its six teams, Wachovia used existing personnel but made its=20
overall organization more sector-focused. There was some resistance among=
=20
various managers and analysts at first, but "almost out of the starting gat=
e=20
we saw a meaningful improvement in performance," Reynolds said.=20
When looking at companies, the Wachovia teams take a bottom-up approach. Th=
ey=20
seek out firms that are in the top half of their respective sector and pull=
=20
back if the company falls into the bottom half.=20
Since adopting its new management structure, the number of names in the=20
Wachovia fund has dropped to about 75 from 110, while the turnover rate has=
=20
dropped to 40% from between 50% to 60%. "The reason for both those drops is=
=20
strength of conviction of stock choices," said Swanson.=20
One company that has performed especially well for the fund this year is th=

I spoke with Craig Glazer, the new director for PJM regarding their concept 
for PJM West, which includes the following:

- Single market, rules, and tariffs for all companies
- No seams
- Reliability criteria of existing control areas in ECAR etc, 
- PJM West could use PJM market  
- A power exchange such as APX could be established as a competitive option 
for day ahead transactions.
- Designed to be flexible
- Native Load exception is eliminated
- LMP
- Transcos could be a part of it

We talked at length about LMP and I suggested the hybrid as an option for a 
variety of reasons.  He does not believe the hybrid method will work because 
a study demonstrated that using past information to develop commercially 
significant flowgates does not work since the paths will change, resulting in 
insufficient coverage of costs which would have to be socialized.  He further 
stated that there is insufficient data in the midwest to identify the 
constraints and we would have to rely on info provided by companies like AEP.

Given our current efforts to develop a single RTO, I think we should meet 
with the PJM folks and talk to them about our issues and see if we can come 
to some agreements.  Craig thinks it is logical that FE might join PJM West.  
I asked him if they were open to alternatives to LMP and he said he didn't 
know.

John Shelk will provide a more thorough report in a later Email, but I just 
wanted you to know that the Waxman price cap amendment was just defeated in 
full Committee markup and the Eshoo refund amendment was defeated.  Both by

FYI.  As you know, we're attempting to find a solution to the "reasonable 
review" morrass that's impeding utility forward contracting.  For that 
effort, we've worked with the Portland desk to pull together some educational 
materials to use with a subset of California stakeholders that's trying to 
devise a solution to California's melt down.

The attached graphs show 3 scenarios for the state as a whole.  
1) "do nothing"  
2) for 60% of IOU short position, split the amount 50-50 and 1cover half the 
amount with 10-year  fixed priced power and the other half with 5-year fixed 
priced power.
3) create a portfolio with a) 25% of short position covered by 10-year fixed 
priced power, b) 20% of short position covered by 5-year fixed price power, 
c) 15% covered by 1-year fixed price power, d) 20% covered by May-Sept 
fixed-price power, and e) 15% from the PX.  

The term of each scenario is 5 years.

Because each is priced off our our curves, the average price is roughly 
equivalent for each of the three portfolios.  However, the graph shows (as 
one would expect) that exposure to price volatility is significantly higher 
under scenario 1 compared to 2 and 3.

The goal is to use the illustrative scenarios to persuade the industry that 
in the short run (i.e., immediately) the utilities should be permitted to buy 
a modest amount of power under 5 and 10 terms, and those purchases (if 
undertaken using a "DealBench-like" tool) ought to be "per se" reasonable.

If anyone has questions about it, or would like to discuss further, give a 
call at 415.782.7822.

Best,
Jeff

Steve,

Following is the transcript from what I believe is the exact show that James 
Hughes asked about.  Wanted you to review it before I send it out and also to 
confirm what constitutes Paul Kaufman's group and any others you might want 
to add.  Paul Kaufman, Sue Mara, Alan Comnes, Jeff Dasovich, Sandra McCubbin 
and Marcie Milner. Also, I will send it to Mark Palmer, Karen Denne, Jim 
Steffes, Rick Shapiro.  Let me know of any others.  Thanks, Ann

              Ray Suarez, co-anchor:

              Finally, it's the latest hot idea for reducing energy
              costs.  Twenty-three states have enacted legislation to
              deregulate electricity rates and sixteen others are
              thinking about it, but California's pioneering efforts have
              already provoked an angry consumer backlash.  Spencer
              Michaels reports.

              Spencer Michaels reporting:

              In a San Diego strip mall, the owner of the tiny Youngling
              Oriental Vegetarian Market is having a hard time.  Yuman
              (?) Young owes two thousand dollars to San Diego Gas &
              Electric--SDG&E--an amount he can't come up with.  Like
              many San Diegans, his electricity bill has skyrocketed this
              year.

              So this is your bill in March, right?

              Yuman Young (Youngling Oriental Vegetarian Market):  Right.

              Michaels:  And the bill is--

              Young:  And see, in March, the bill comes to about four
              seventy-eight.

              Michaels:  Then we have May.

              Young:  In May, it...

              Michaels:  Then we're up--

              Young:  ...goes to six seventy something.

              Michaels:  Six seventy-four.

              Young:  Yeah.

              Michaels:  And then--

              Young:  And then...

              Michaels:  And then we skip...

              Young:  ...we skip a month.

              Michaels:  ...June, but in July--

              Young:  And the--then in July, it goes to about thirteen
              hundred dollars.

              Michaels:  Thirteen hundred dollars?

              Young:  Yeah.

              Michaels:  And the same in August?

              Young:  And the same in August.

              Michaels:  Over thirteen hundred dollars.

              Young:  Yeah, right.

              Michaels:  Young's main electricity expense is his frozen
              food freezer that he keeps at minus seventeen degrees.  But
              people without such appliances have seen residential and
              commercial bills double and triple as well.  San Diego is
              the first California city to suffer the effects of the
              deregulation of electricity, which was enacted by the state
              legislature in 1996.  The theory was that by taking away
              the monopolies enjoyed by state-regulated utility
              companies, like SDG&E, new competition among electricity
              producers would result in a drop in rates.  But since such
              simple market economics would take awhile, the legislature
              imposed a temporary rate freeze to protect most parts of
              the state from higher prices.  In San Diego, the freeze
              came off this year letting the market set the price, a
              very high price.  SDG&E is owned by Sempra Energy, where
              Stephen Baum is CEO.

              Stephen Baum (Chief Executive Officer, Sempra Energy):
              It's been a terrible shock to our customers, seeing
              real-time prices for the first time.  And those prices are
              way out of sight because the wholesale market is broken and
              needs to be fixed.

              Michaels:  The vast wholesale market is something new.
              California utilities used to own most of the power plants,
              the high-voltage transmission lines and the system to
              deliver power to homes and businesses.  Under deregulation
              the utilities still deliver the power, but had to turn
              operations of the transmission lines over to a state
              agency.  In addition, they had to sell their power plants.
              So now almost all power is sold to the utilities on a
              wholesale basis by producers or generators.  And according
              to Baum, they charge what they can get.

              Baum:  There's been a very large wealth transfer from the
              customers in the state of California to the generators.  We
              don't think the market's workably competitive.  There
              aren't enough players and there's not enough generation.
              Until that occurs, you're going to have dislocations at
              very high prices.

              Michaels:  The situation keeps getting worse as
              California's population keeps increasing, especially in the
              hot central valley.  Air conditioners and other appliances
              put a strain on a system already stressed by increased
              demand in other states where some of California's power
              comes from.  According to University of California
              economist Severin Borenstein, deregulation has aggravated
              the already tight situation.

              Severin Borenstein (University of California, Berkeley):
              Production in the state has really been stretched and that
              does two things:  One, is it naturally just creates a tight
              supply/demand situation that's going to drive prices up.
              The other thing it does, though, is it also puts the
              producers in a very strong position to push prices up even
              higher.  And, I think, there's no question the generators
              are trying to make as much money as they can.

              Michaels:  Duke Energy, headquartered in North Carolina, is
              one of the new generators in the California market.  Duke
              spokesman Tom Williams says much of its power was sold
              before prices rose and that profits are plowed back into
              new plants.

              The utilities and the consumer groups seem to think that
              the generators are making a lot of money on this crisis.
              Is that true?

              Tom Williams (Duke Energy Corporation):  Duke Energy sells
              the bulk of its power in the--in the forward market.  It
              was sold a year ago for the plants we have in the state
              now.  So the power's already been sold, and the price of
              natural gas has gone up two and a half times since last
              summer.  So there is a very tight supply situation, but
              we're reinvesting our profits back into the market to fix
              the problem.
              Michaels:  In fact, Duke is investing 1.1 billion dollars
              to modernize two inefficient power plants it bought from
              the utilities.  As part of the deal it also had to buy
              this old PG&E plant in Oakland, which has been running
              overtime because of the power shortage.  Over the last two
              decades only a few companies have actually begun
              construction of new power plants because of what they saw
              as the uncertainties of the regulatory climate.  This plant
              near San Francisco, being built by Calpine, will supply
              enough electricity for half a million homes.  It will be
              ready by next summer.  Calpine vice president, James
              Macias, says his company predicted the shortage of power
              and took a risk.

              James Macias (Vice President, Calpine):  You could see the
              fundamentals forming of the need for more--more power.
              There hasn't been a big power plant like this built in the
              state for--for decades.

              Michaels:  Macias says the utilities should have contracted
              for power at lower rates before it was actually needed.  He
              expects that the profits power companies are making now
              will decline as more power comes on line.

              Macias:  We're doing pretty good.  We're being rewarded for
              having the vision and the foresight to come in here and
              build this--this--this needed supply.  But they're not
              going to last.  As soon as this--more of the supply comes
              in, the prices will come down and they'll be--they'll be
              depressed again.  They have to come down.  This economy,
              again, can't support these high prices.

              Michaels:  Although twenty new plants are in the planning
              stages, it takes five years to design and build just one.
              With very little additional supply in the immediate
              pipeline, the director of San Diego's utility watchdog
              group, Utility Consumers Action Network, says regulators
              must get involved to return rates to reasonable levels.

              Michael Shames (Consumer Advocate):  They could have
              immediately put--reinstated a price cap.  They could have
              immediately said, hold on a second folks.  We're not going
              to tolerate this.  We're not going to see a region like San
              Diego thrust into a depression.

              Michaels:  But Michael Shames says some legislators and
              regulators were ruled by their uncompromising belief in a
              free-market ideology.

              Shames:  There were a number of people, well-placed people,
              who were so ideologically driven to force competition to
              work in a market such as energy that they didn't want to
              look at the signs when they saw that the experiment wasn't
              working.  They didn't want to acknowledge it wasn't
              working, and they were prepared to sacrifice a city, San
              Diego, a state, California, and possibly a country, in
              order to see their ideologically driven vision--vision
              work.  (Clip from a TV commercial)

              Michaels:  Shames' consumer group was so outraged at the
              price increases they bought TV ads and urged civil
              disobedience.

              Dianne Jacob (Chair, San Diego County Supervisor):  Join me
              and other San Diegans and let's send a message.  Pay only
              what is fair.  When your SDG&E bill comes, pay what you
              paid last summer.  That's fair.

              Michaels:  At the California Public Utilities Commission,
              President Loretta Lynch agrees that regulators could remedy
              the situation, but she says it's not up to the state.
              Only the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has the power
              to cut back prices.

              Loretta Lynch (California Public Utilities Commission):  If
              the federal government allowed power plant owners to make a
              reasonable profit instead of an excessive profit, then that
              would drop the price of wholesale power.  And if that price
              dropped we would not be in the pickle we're in today.

              Michaels:  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission president,
              James Hoecker, replies that simply using price controls
              discourages investment in an industry that needs it.

              James Hoecker (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission):  What
              my friend, President Lynch, has said reflects a kind of
              thinking that markets can never be made to work and that
              ultimately we have to resort to cost-based, profit kinds of
              regulation of utilities.  And I think that this market has
              marched past that as an option.

              Michaels:  In November, the Federal Energy Regulatory
              Commission proposed a major change.  Utilities would not be
              required to buy power from the power exchange--a kind of
              stock market for electricity where prices have soared.
              Instead, the utilities will be able to buy directly from
              producers.  The federal agency has launched an
              investigation into California's troubles, hoping for a
              long-term solution.

              Unidentified Woman:  This legislation, today, has the
              ability to provide immediate and real relief to San
              Diegans.

              Michaels:  The California legislature struggled this year
              with what to do, short term, for the people of San Diego.
              The debate centered around a proposal to cap electricity
              bills at sixty-five dollars a month, retroactive to June 1.

              Charlene Zettel (Assembly Member, Republican, San Diego):
              What is San Diego's problem today will be California's
              problem tomorrow.

              Rico Oller (Assembly Member, Republican, San Diego):  You
              know who we can thank for this problem?  You want to get
              right down to brass tacks?  You can thank all of the
              knuckle-headed people in this legislature and in
              government, in general--in general, who have stood in the
              way of doing the smart and sensible thing that anyone would
              have the sense to do in the real world, and that is to
              provide for their future needs by increasing production.
              We need to build some facilities to produce power.

              Unidentified Man:  All debate having ceased, the clerk will
              open the roll.  All members vote who desire to vote.

              Michaels:  The San Diego rate cap passed, but the state is
              still far from a solution.  Higher electric rates are
              forecasted for the rest of the state as the caps come off
              in other cities.  And even more troubling is the fact that
              the price rollback is being bankrolled by the utilities,
              since they still have to pay the generators for the power
              but can't pass those prices on to their customers.

              Economist Borenstein says other states better examine
              California's experience before proceeding with
              deregulation.

              Borenstein:  I think most states that are deregulating
              right now, if they have a tight supply situation, are very
              likely to see spikes just like ours.  The best advice I
              think for most of these states is to take a break, not move
              forward on their deregulation, watch the experiments that
              are going on in California and New York and Pennsylvania
              and Texas and a number of other states and learn from them,
              because we're learning a lot from them as we do this.

              Michaels:  The success or failure of deregulation across
              the country will depend partly on easy access to power
              transmission lines so that electricity can be transferred
              more readily to where it's needed.  The federal government
              is working on that problem.

Hi Christie and Alhamd,

I spoke with Mark and Steve (as Steve is the Rice contact and must be 
comfortable with our donation) and we have decided that Enron's 
contribution/donation will be $5K - as the ONLY difference between the $10K 
and $5K donation is in the amount of complimentary passes Enron receives for 
the event.  For a $10K donation we receive 10 passes and for a $5K donation 
we receive.....take a guess.......you're right..... 5 complimentary passes.  

If we need additional passes we should be able to leverage Rice for some as 
we've given them tons of money.

Regards,

Cindy

Great stuff. Lets chat in San Antonio. You owe me a beer anyway!

We have been playing with several "commercialisation of HR" ideas including 
setting up our own recruitment search company to market talent we don't 
need/like that passes through the machine (plus unsuccessful redeployment 
people). Idea of developing our own Monster board in connection with this is 
very appealing (Europe already have a site which does some of what we need 
"EnronCareers.Com"). If we can do something with our existing ad strategy 
without adding too much cost that would be outstanding.

David

Great idea.  

Problems with tagging on to existing commercials, though.  In a thirty second 
spot, every second counts.  The tag as proposed would eat up almost half the 
spot.  I'll set aside the usual blather about the spots just being for brand 
development, corporate image, etc.  

We may want to look into producing a specific recruiting spot.  That would be 
an interesting proposition.  If the idea has commercial merit, we could find 
a way to fund it.  Also, EBS has a new unit called Enron Media Services that 
might be able to help us source the media inventory (need to be a specific 
target) to run the spot.

What do you think?

Mark

Herewith a few ideas for the October meeting in London, some of them
after checking with Paul Portney and with Pankaj. I offer these very, very
preliminary thoughts just to start you thinking - do you want your UK
colleagues on the program; do we want some ancillary events? After getting
your views on questions such as these, I can make more definite suggestions.
I certainly think that we should convene a few hours before the opening
dinner so that the advisors can have a tour of the building and the
facilities. Also, I am hoping that Steve will leave some time on this trip
for a tour of the new BA headquarters - very innovative.
We should consider doing something on the global warming question from the
viewpoint of the Europeans. Start with three recommendations on the political
side that Paul received from David Victor of the Council on Foreign Relations
(characterized as "a VERY smart guy on climate"):
Tony Brenton (Deputy chief of mission, UK embassy in DC.  Has been on UK
climate delegations for a decade; smart and lively; pragmatic; insightful).
Bo Kjellen (Swedish head of delegation; knows European politics inside out;
big figure in Europe).
Tubiana, Laurence (Conseil d'Analyse Economique, France; knows the issue and
can speak to French position, but may not have the gravitas of Kjellen or
Brenton).
Among other ideas (I have winnowed out several) is a guy named Liam
Salter at Climate Network Europe. Brussels based, but relatively junior. Paul
also recommends a woman by the name of Laurence Tubiana, an economist in the
French government's equivalent of the CEA; she has a reputation as a good
presenter and a good economist.
WOULD YOU PLEASE CHECK THESE FOLKS OUT WITH YOUR LONDON PEOPLE, AND GET
ADDITIONAL NAMES FROM THEM. THE GOAL IS TO GIVE ALL OF US A PERSPECTIVE ON
THE EUROPEAN VIEW ON ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES - UNLESS YOU THINK THAT NOT A
USEFUL TOPIC.
I turn now to Pankaj's suggestion, which I transmit verbatim: "I remember
promising to scout around and see if there were a European whom it would be
interesting to invite to talk to the Enron International Advisory Council
about the (non) convergence of governance structures in Europe, particularly
on the Continent, to the U.S. model.  I got the following names from Jay
Lorsch (apparently all members of the committee steering a multifaculty
Harvard business School project on governance in comparative perspective) as
possibilities.  Jay suggested that Sihler would be best (former CEO of
Henkel, very senior),  Peter's second best (apparently, chairman of Amsterdam
Stock Exchange now) and Smith - formerly Managing partner at Price Waterhouse
Coopers - would be the most junior of the three.  I don't personally know any
of the three."
Now some ideas of my own, again acting on the assumption that we want a
two-way educational dialogue - to give your folks in London and Europe a
run-down on the situation in the US, and the US contingent a better
understanding of how European policymakers view the issues we all face.
1.Bill Kristol on the US political scene, in which there is great
interest here, and great misunderstanding of the Bush administration. We
might also consider inviting Larry Lindsey or some other Bush person if
allowed to do so.
2. Someone on the European view on global warming (see suggestions above).
3. Energy regulation in the UK. Callum McCarthy.
4. Economic outlook. Gavyn Davies (usual talk).
5. What went wrong in California (great interest in that over here) and
how to fix it. Steve could do this, or you could invite Bill Hogan (just
joking) or the chairman of FERC if we are allowed to pay his way.
6. Motivating people in a multinational, multicultural organization. If
this is of interest, I can get recommendations for speakers.
7. I would be inclined to add a high-level speaker on the state of
US-UK-European relations, perhaps as a dinner speaker. Between Gavyn and me,
we might be able to get Chancellor Gordon Brown, a very interesting guy, and
the inventor of the "climate change levy" that is driving industry in this
country nuts.
Please look this over. Steve and I have to get together, preferably with
Ken, which leads me to suggest Aspen during the Institute's energy forum,
which I understand Ken will be attending. But if that is not feasible, Steve
and I can work out a date for a preliminary meeting, followed up by one with
Ken at his convenience.

You recently received and invitation from Cindy Derecskey to attend a 
presentation on "Best Practices in Communication" by Global Corporations, 
scheduled for DEC 18 from 3 to 5pm. Prior to the meeting, I wanted to share 
some background on how this came about and why it may be relevant to your 
area of responsibility. 
During 2000, the International PR team wanted to develop a better 
appreciation as to what corporate cultures, operating structures, strategies, 
tactics and tools were being used to keep pace with the ever-widening and 
more strategic role communication is being asked to play.  As such, several 
companies got together and asked Laird & Associates ( who has previously 
completed studies for Enron) to conduct research on the following companies, 
i.e.  BP Amoco, General Electric, Johnson and Johnson, Merck & Co., Inc., 
McDonalds, Nestle, Nokia Corp., and Royal Dutch Shell Group. 
The presentation will be made by the President of Laird and Associates and 
you will receive the most important elements of the voluminous analysis and 
findings they extracted from on-site visits. For your reference, I will 
forward the final report to your attention.
The presentation will take place at the Enron in 47C1. Please feel free to 
invite any others you feel might benefit from this material.  
Thank you in advance for anticipated cooperation. Do not hesitate to call, if 
you have any questions.

Enron: ISO Credit Problems Are Those Of Calif Utilities
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

12/13/2000
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

By Mark Golden 
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The credit problems of the California Independent 
System Operator reflect the credit problems of the state's three 
investor-owned utilities, Enron Corp. (ENE) chief of staff Steven Kean said 
Wednesday.
"We have expressed some concerns about the utilities' creditworthiness," Kean 
said. "They wouldn't have this credit issue if they had a government 
guarantee." 
Standard & Poor's credit analyst for California utilities, Richard Cortright, 
told Dow Jones Newswires that such a guarantee is highly unlikely. 
"There's no point in talking about it," Cortright said. 
The credit-rating agency put California utility holding companies PG&E Corp 
(PCG) and Edison International (EIX) on watch with negative implications 
Wednesday. The utilities have seen their debt rating downgraded already this 
fall, but their debts are piling up by the billions as they continue to pay 
about 10 times more for power supplies than they can charge customers. 
"The sheer magnitute of the undercollected balance is beyond belief," 
Cortright said. "Wholesale prices have gotten worse, and every hour the 
situation gets more dire." 
Cortright said the only step that would save the utilities' credit status is 
if California regulators raised the rates the utilities can charge customers. 
Late Wednesday, the California Public Utilties Commission indicated that it 
may do so, reversing a decision made just last week. 
"With new generation coming on, you would expect the rates to decline in a 
couple of years," Cortright said. 
The California Independent System Operator almost had to institute rolling 
blackouts Wednesday because 13 suppliers had stopped selling it power due to 
concerns about the ISO's credit. 
California Gov. Gray Davis said that Enron was one of the "dirty 13." 
Enron's Kean said that Enron was only offering very limited amounts of power 
to the ISO. 
"We are basically just a buyer and seller. We control only 70 megawatts of 
generation in the state, which we offered to the ISO today because of the 
emergency, but the ISO declined to purchase that power," Kean said. 
That small generating unit is located in the southern California, while the 
ISO's supply problems were most acute in northern California. 
"We aren't selling any other power to them right now. Everything else that we 
bought we've sold to other buyers," said Kean, who added that Enron had sold 
to the ISO as recently as Tuesday. 
The ISO manages California's electricity grid and purchases last-minute 
additional power on behalf of the state's three investor-owned utilities. The 
ISO then bills the utilities, which are PG&E Corp's Pacific Gas & Electric 
Co, Edison International's (EIX) Southern California Edison, and Sempra 
Energy's (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric Co. 
The ISO has 70-day payment terms to suppliers. 
For the past two weeks, and often during the summer, the ISO has been 
purchasing about one-fourth of the state's entire needs at very high prices. 
It's current daily power purchases are running at $50 million to $100 
million.

Since terminations are processed in lag, here is the report as of 5/20.   
Thanks.



Major takeaways :  The number of good performers leaving in recent weeks is 
increasing.  Although termination activity is highest seen in recent years at 
1,300 ytd, there have been 1900 new hires (including acquisitions) - a net 
growth of 600 employees.  More details in the attachment.  Thanks.

Becky and I are working on the PL00-1 FERC docket, which is revilsitng the 
gas marketing affiliate rules.  Comments are due on 1/5 and a hearing is 
scheduled for 1/31.  FERC is looking for industry thoughts on the efficacy of 
the rule, whether revisions are necessary, whether the rules are interfering 
with business, etc.  I wanted you to know we were doing this and would 
appreciate any 50,000 foot (or lower) views you may have on this.  Thanks.

Calif. Senate Panel To Cite Reliant, Enron For Contempt

07/19/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

(This article was originally published Wednesday.) 

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- A California Senate committee Wednesday voted to 
cite Reliant Energy (REI) with contempt because the company has refused to 
provide documents for an investigation into wholesale electricity prices in 
the state, said committee Chairman Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana.
The committee also voted to forward a contempt charge for Enron Corp (ENE) to 
the full Senate, where it will be voted on. If the charge is approved, the 
Senate will vote on punishment, which could include hefty fines or 
incarceration of executives. 
Talks between Enron and committee attorneys Monday seemed to indicate the 
company would agree to committee demands, but since then it has become clear 
the company doesn't plan to comply, Dunn said. 
"If you had asked two days ago I'd have said we are cautiously optimistic 
about Enron. Now I'm pessimistic about it. We felt they were indicating to us 
a willingness to do what the other generators were willing to do, but the 
bottom line is that they are not, despite their cooperative-sounding words. 
We are no closer to them coming into compliance than we were a week ago," 
Dunn said. 
The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation is requesting 
that Reliant and Enron provide 16 kinds of documents related to market 
behavior, rent a depository for the documents, and sign the committee's 
version of a confidentiality agreement. Both generators have refused to meet 
those demands, Dunn said. 
The committee will drop its contempt charges at any time before a full Senate 
vote if either generator agrees to its requests. 
A report detailing Enron's contempt charge will be sent to the full Senate on 
Thursday for introduction, but is expected to be referred to the Senate Rules 
Committee for review before a floor vote. 
Dunn said he didn't know how long the report would be considered in the Rules 
Committee, but he will "certainly push them to do it as soon as possible." 
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said the company "will continue to negotiate" 
with the committee. 
Legislators are scheduled to begin a monthlong break Friday, but aren't 
certain that will happen because they still need to pass a budget bill and 
are trying to approve a bill to rescue Edison International (EIX) unit 
Southern California Edison before leaving. 
Dunn said it would take a few days to prepare a report on Reliant's contempt 
charge. 
"We may not be able to forward that report to the Senate floor until the day 
we get back from recess," Dunn said. 
No one at Reliant could be immediately reached for comment. 
The committee originally was poised to cite seven other electricity 
generators for contempt, but all eventually agreed to provide the requested 
information. 
A Reliant spokesman said later that the company's main difference with the 
committee centered on the signing of the confidentiality agreement. Reliant 
would rather the committee secure a protective order before the company turns 
over the requested documents, said spokesman Richard Wheatley. 
"We respectfully decline to waive our objections, because we have a lot of 
trade secrets and proprietary information at stake," he said. 
When asked if the company would take legal action against the committee, 
Wheatley said Reliant was "keeping all options open." 
"But, really, we hope to work this out on an informal basis," Wheatley said. 
"We don't think this is that big of a stumbling block." 
Enron filed suit against the committee last week over objections to its 
subpoena of certain financial documents, and said at hearings last week that 
it may sue over its contempt charge as well.

Davis administration tells consultants to sell energy stocks

07/19/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

SACRAMENTO (AP) - The Davis administration on Wednesday told consultants 
buying energy for the state to sell their stock holdings in energy companies 
immediately or quit their jobs. 
Nine consultants divested by a noon deadline, but critics said the order by 
Gov. Gray Davis came months too late to protect the public's interest.
The order, issued at Davis' direction, was contained in a memo to Tom 
Hannigan, director of the state Department of Water Resources. Legal Affairs 
Secretary Barry Goode wrote that it was "imperative that you give instruction 
immediately" to those concerned. 
"We expect, and have always expected, the state's consultants to uphold the 
highest ethical standards," the memo states. "That standard is not met by 
those who hold a financial interest in one or more energy companies while 
trading on behalf of the state on energy related matters. 
Under pressure from Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican who hopes to 
challenge Democrat Davis for re-election next year, the administration moved 
to obtain statements of economic interest from the energy consultants. The 
consultants were hired earlier this year to advise the Department of Water 
Resources on electricity purchases for California's financially strapped 
utilities. 
The economic statements showed that several consultants held stock in energy 
generators, including Calpine Corp. and Enron. One consultant reported he 
sold stock holdings in Edison International and Dynegy when he began work for 
the state.

INDIA: AES threatens to abandon Indian venture.
By Himangshu Watts

07/19/2001
Reuters English News Service 
(C) Reuters Limited 2001. 

NEW DELHI, July 19 (Reuters) - U.S. energy firm AES Corp may walk out of a 
troubled distribution venture in eastern India due to a difficult regulatory 
enivironment, the firm's CEO said on Thursday. 
Dennis Bakke told reporters AES will sell its 51-percent stake in CESCO, a 
distribution firm in the eastern province of Orissa, unless the firm was paid 
its dues, allowed to raise tariffs and given a better operating environment.
"If satisfactory resolution of these matters is not expeditiously reached, 
AES will be forced to abandon its commitment to the distribution company," he 
said. 
AES holds a 49 percent stake in Orissa Power Generation Corporation (OPGC), 
which runs a 420-MW plant in the state and sells power to state-run Gridco, a 
state-run transmission firm. 
Bakke said Gridco owed OPGC about $45 million and the U.S. firm had filed for 
arbitration in Orissa to recover the dues accumulated over two and a half 
years. 
He said GRIDCO was not paying OPGC, the generating company, saying that 
CESCO, the distribution firm, owed it money. 
"These are standalone businesses, and there is no basis for any such linkage 
or offset," he said. 
Bakke said the state's regulatory commission had ordered CESCO to transfer 
all receivables collected into an escrow account, but the company could not 
abide by the instruction as it needed money to pay its employees. 
However, it complied after the local government initiated criminal 
proceedings against the managing director of CESCO, he said. AES will deposit 
all revenues into the escrow account. 
"Hence funds will not be available to pay the 8,500 CESCO employees salaries 
due July 31 and thereafter." 
He said the regulatory regime in Orissa fixed tariffs at levels which did not 
allow it to recover its costs. 
Orissa officials were not immediately available for comment. 
He said AES was considering selling its stake in CESCO but could enter into a 
management contract in the transition period. 
However, AES will look at other opportunities in India if it finds a better 
regulatory environment. 
Bakke said AES had not made any proposal to take over Enron Corp's troubled 
Dabhol project but it was a "potential business" in which it might be 
interested at some stage. 
Apart from Enron, which has threatened to walk out of its $2.9-billion Indian 
venture, U.S. firm, Cogentrix, and Electricite de France have also packed 
their bags. 
India, whose 100,000 MW generation capacity is 13 percent short of demand, 
began power reforms in the early 1990s to attract foreign investment to 
increase power availability to industry and almost 80,000 villages without 
electricity.

FERC Agenda Eyes Tightening Of Pipeline Affiliate Rules
By Bryan Lee

07/19/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Federal energy regulators are scheduled to act next 
week on new rules affecting natural gas pipeline affiliate dealings.
Sources say the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is debating action 
at next Wednesday's open meeting to tighten up rules prohibiting pipelines 
from providing market-sensitive information to marketing affiliates. 
FERC rules allow monopoly pipeline companies to market natural gas in 
competitive markets providing they adopt codes of conduct that prevent the 
passing of information that provides a competitive advantage to their 
gas-marketing affiliates. 
Similar rules are in place on the electric side for vertically integrated 
utilities with marketing units competing in wholesale power markets. 
The changes under consideration stem from the commission's investigation of 
El Paso Natural Gas Co.'s (EPG) controversial contract with a marketing 
affiliate for pipeline capacity into California, according to sources. 
The affiliate transaction has been blamed for California's dramatic runup in 
natural gas prices over the past year, which contributed to the state's 
unprecedentedly high electricity costs last year. 
The proposed code-of-conduct changes also reflect the sweeping convergence 
between the natural gas and power sectors in the years since FERC deregulated 
the pipeline industry in the 1980s. 
FERC's rules prohibit pipelines from sharing market-sensitive information 
with their gas-marketing affiliates. But the rules don't address the 
pipeline's power marketing affiliates. The commission is looking to expand 
the code-of-conduct rules to address all marketing affiliates, sources said. 
These sources say the template for the pending change can be found in the 
conditions FERC imposed in a 1999 order authorizing the acquisition of 
Pittsburgh-based Consolidated Natural Gas by Dominion Resources (D). 
The commission approved the electricity-natural gas convergence merger, 
contingent on Dominion agreeing to adopt codes of conduct applying equally to 
its gas and power marketing affiliates. 
The planned rule changes would apply to electric utilities with pipeline 
investments, such as CMS Energy (CMS), Duke Energy (DUK) and American 
Electric Power Co. (AEP). It is unclear how the changes would affect joint 
operating agreements, such as the one between Entergy Corp. (ETR) and 
privately held Koch Industries. 
But the largest impact will be for large pipeline companies with extensive 
power marketing operations and investments in power plants. 
For example, El Paso, Williams Cos. (WMB) and Enron Corp. (ENE), represent 
about 70% of the interstate pipeline industry and are among the nation's top 
power marketers and merchant power plant developers. 
One FERC source described the order scheduled for commission vote next week 
as "a work in progress," while another said the matter is in such a state of 
flux that "it might not be safe to write anything yet."

AES CEO Meeting Indian Power Minister on Dabhol, Paper Reports
2001-07-19 02:00 (New York)
 New Delhi, July 19 (Bloomberg) -- AES Corp. Chief Executive
Dennis Bakke will likely discuss taking over Enron Corp.'s Dabhol
Power Co. when he meets India's power minister Suresh Prabhu
today, Business Standard said, without citing officials.
     Dabhol, 65 percent owned by Enron, and Maharashtra State
Electricity Board, its only customer, have been quarrelling for
seven months over unpaid bills. The board has stopped
buying power from Dabhol and construction work on the $3 billion
plant was halted last month after lenders stopped funding it.
     Bakke will also likely discuss AES's own payment problems at
its 49 percent owned Orissa Power Generation Co. in eastern Orissa
state, the paper said. AES is struggling to recover 2.1 billion
rupees ($44 million) owed it by the state-run transmission
company, the Business Standard reported earlier.
     Bakke is also likely to meet India's Finance Minister
Yashwant Sinha, the paper said.

ES Corp. May Exit Indian Power Venture Over Past-Due Payments
2001-07-19 15:35 (New York)

AES Corp. May Exit Indian Power Venture Over Past-Due Payments
  New Delhi, July 19 (Bloomberg) -- AES Corp., the biggest U.S.
power company, said it may withdraw from a power distribution
venture in India's eastern Orissa state because of unpaid bills.
     AES, which runs a 420-megawatt power plant in Orissa, is owed
$44 million by the state-run transmission company, of which the
U.S. company owns 49 percent. AES Chief Executive Dennis Bakke met
with India's power minister Suresh Prabhu in New Delhi today.
     ``We have to take such drastic steps when we don't get
paid,'' said Sandra Ross, an official in AES's investor relations
department in Arlington, Virginia. ``These issues have to get
resolved.''
     AES is the latest in a series of overseas power companies
that have faced payment problems or withdrawn investment from the
country citing delays, bureaucracy and the slow pace of reforms.
India says it needs $200 billion to double the nation's generating
capacity and avoid power failures that last year swept across much
of northern India. Blackouts are common in many Indian cities.
     ``AES will be forced to abandon its commitment to the
distribution company'' if the past-due bills aren't paid, AES's
Bakke said on Star TV, broadcast in India today. He said AES is
filing for arbitration of the dispute.

                               Enron

     Enron Corp.'s Dabhol Power Co. and a state electricity board
in India's western state of Maharashtra have been quarrelling for
seven months over $64 million of unpaid bills. The board, Dahbol's
sole customer, stopped buying power from the unit, saying it's too
expensive. Construction of the $3 billion plant's second phase
stopped last month after lenders cut funding.
     Four other foreign power companies, including Electricite de
France, Europe's largest, have pulled out of Indian power projects
worth $3 billion.
     ``We're not happy with the way things are,'' said AES's Ross.
``In the future, if payments resume, we could buy it back.''
     Arlington, Virginia-based AES owns stakes in 173 power plants
generating 59,000 megawatts worldwide, including utilities in the
U.S. and Latin America.
     AES owns 49 percent of the Orissa Power Generation Co. that
supplies 600,000 customers in eastern India.
     AES shares rose as much as $1.37, or 3.8 percent, to $37.80.

Meeting Details.
Per Allen Elliott, myportal.com is a proof of concept portal, a production=
=20
ready prototype portal developed using Tibco Portalbuilder =01) Enron=01,s =
standard=20
portal development tool. =20

What content is accessible from the portal needs to be decided.  Each=20
Business Unit (and Functional Unit within) needs to decide the following: w=

it?  Historically, this is a challenge to determine.  Business Units and=20
Functional Units typically want desired information available, but do not=
=20
want to take any responsibility in defining, creating, or managing the=20
information. =20

Per Brandon Rigney, the four tabs identified by the ASE breakout group are=
=20
organization centric.  This is a problem for users.  For example, if the=20
aisles in a library were arranged by publishers (i.e. Simon & Schuster,=20
Prentice Hall, McGraw Hill, etc.) one would have to know the publisher of t=
he=20
information before a subject could be located.  This would not provide easy=
=20
access to information. =20

Does the above analogy rule out the task force=01,s interest in unveiling a=

portal with defined areas  from which all users blast (Rick Causey=01,s wor=
d)? =20
The Content Strategist/User Experience experts are not telling the task for=

we have been discussing to do.  If easy access to information is our=20
objective, perhaps we may further discuss the implication of designated bla=

Meeting Details.

The above group met to discuss the content strategy for the KM Task Force=
=20
portal.  Our intention is to synergize the collective intelligence of these=
=20
teams to develop a best practices portal.  The task force is in a unique=20
position because the portal we will develop from is Bryan Powell=01,s=20
mynetwork.com which although it largely reflects Brandon Rigney=01,s=20
my.home.enron.com, it does not reflect the characteristics requested by the=
=20
KM pilot executive sponsors and task force members.  The question to ask is=
:=20
are the characteristics identified by the KM pilot executive sponsors and=
=20
task force members the characteristics we should include in a portal? =20
Further analysis is required to conclude what user needs are before we can=
=20
determine what to include in a portal.=20

The team agreed that a portal is relatively easy to develop.  What is more=
=20
important and challenging is the process, established perhaps by a=20
centralized KM effort, by which information or content is made available to=
=20
all given portals. It is the content accessible through a portal which=20
determines the success of the portal.  Yahoo.com users, through a minimal=
=20
number of starting points, may access some 6000 containers of information. =
=20
For our project, it has not been determined what information (what content)=
=20
needs to be accessed from a portal.  The answer to this question should=20
predict what front end buttons are most important to place on the initial=
=20
dashboard of the portal. =20

Does the task force want to enter in to the business of hashing out what=20
specific content to make available through the portal?  No, we have neither=
=20
the time nor the responsibility to undertake this.  But, how then, does the=
=20
task force determine what the initial dashboard will look like if we don=01=
,t=20
have an understanding of what content users actually need most to access? =
=20
The requirements phase should predict this.

What is most challenging about content?  The answer:  locking down the=20
containerable information (content) to bridge to portals.  Information need=
s=20
to be syndicated.  In order for it to be syndicated, it must be in an=20
appropriate container.  =01&Containerable=018 information is information th=
at can=20
be shown as a channel.  In other words, containerable information is=20
information that can be accessed from the portal.  Not all information on a=
=20
given website is containerable and available to be pulled by portals. =20
Editorial assistance is required to make certain information is contained. =
 A=20
KM strategy should propose a method to identify, develop and maintain=20
information a portal can capture. =20


Meeting Conclusion.

The development of any business structure should be driven by business=20
needs.  Given business needs vary from Business Unit to Business Unit and=
=20
person to person, the task of developing a portal as the single interface f=
or=20
all Enron Business Units is large. =20

Consider the following diagram as a high level plan we may reference to=20
develop the content strategy for a best practices portal. =20

Requirements Phase=09Design Phase=09Build Phase=09Test Phase =09Launch Phas=
e


We are currently in the requirements phase of this project.  Although=20
multiple, personalized portals have been developed, unveiled and implemente=
d,=20
we are still gathering requirements to create a best practices portal.  The=
=20
task force is chartered with the responsibility to develop a Knowledge=20
Management proposal.  In this proposal, we may consider the process through=
=20
which containerable information is identified, developed, and maintained.  =
In=20
the meantime, the content strategy team is available for the task force=20
members to consult.  The content strategy team will help Bryan Powell=01,s =
team=20
shape mynetwork.com.

With respect to content strategy, some of the responsibilities a KM proposa=
l=20
should review include:
? A plan to develop a process to determine what information is important to=
=20
contain
? A plan to develop a process to identify owners of containers
? A plan to develop a process for teaching people how to build containers
? A plan to develop a process for cleaning up data
? A plan to develop a process for inventorying data on websites
? A plan to develop a process for inventorying data on the =01&O=018 drive =
and=20
other assets
? A plan to develop a process for creating a consulting portal kit whereby=

Hello - 

I have included an update on GENIE but I am starting with a list of action 
items needed by you and mentioned in more detail below:
Changes or approval on the letter to the Office of the Chairman of EWS, EES 
and ETS from Steve.
Steve, please brief Ken so we can get both events on his schedule.  He still 
has other commitments that need to be moved.
Changes or approval on the panelist/invitees list ASAP.

Mailing and Acceptances
The mailings to the steering committee and commentators went out last Wed. 
and Thurs. We are rapidly receiving emails and phone responses.  I will send 
a weekly update of the results. Within the next week, I may request that top 
Enron officials make a personal invitation to key attendees that are 
unresponsive. 

October event Attendees/Panelists
Please look over the excel spreadsheet of proposed attendees ASAP (in your 
binder from our last meeting). We must start getting the invitations out 
soon. Feel free to add names you do not see on the list. We will be taking 
the same approach with the business units once they are notified of this 
event. 

Memos
Rick will be sending out a memo about GENIE to his direct reports today. I 
will be briefing them in more detail on his call on Thursday, making sure 
that they are aware of those we asking to participate as part of the Steering 
Committee and commentators. They will also be given the opportunity to 
suggest general attendees.

I have attached a memo that Steve can send to the Office of the Chair of EWS, 
EES and ETS. 


Binders
I created a briefing binder for both Sherrie and Joannie in Jeff's office and 
will be doing so for Ken once he is aware of the initiative. Once the BU's 
units are on board, I can do the same for the Office of the Chairman in those 
groups.  I will keep them all updated on a weekly basis.

     Let me know any thoughts, comments or questions. Thanks, MSA

FYI -- When Dan Larcamp was here last week, we discussed access to 
information.  He stated that he does not think that any utilities, including 
marketers, are providing enough real time data to FERC.  (We have given FERC 
EOL passwords.)  Lloyd told Dan that FERC should get access to the NERC 
information for a start and Dan said that FERC was reluctant to do that 
politically because FERC doesn't like signing non-disclosure agreements, but 
they may go ahead and sign to get the process started.

We discussed the TLR issues this summer and FERC staff's finding on lack of 
transmission utility data noted in the Investigations.  Dan told me that FERC 
is currently at "one of my favorite utilities" [must be Entergy or SOCO] 
taking depositions and making the utility go through boxes of TLR data.

Forecast Brighter but Electricity Price Soars 
Utility: Northwest sends more power to California, but disruption from Utah 
prompts Stage 2 alert. 
By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, Times Staff Writer
Los Angeles Times - Wednesday, December 13, 2000


?????Day 9 of California's electricity emergency promised an improving supply 
picture both within the state and through more imports from the Pacific 
Northwest, which on Tuesday continued to dodge the expected hit from an 
Arctic cold front. 
?????But a disruption in supplies from Utah late in the day ended up pushing 
California's power grid into a Stage 2 emergency. 
?????Meanwhile, California electricity prices continued to set records, a 
growing toll that consumer advocates worry will eventually come out of 
customers' pockets. 
?????"This is extraordinary," said Doug Heller, consumer advocate with the 
Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. "This is the 
harbinger of a recession to come." 
?????The average price of electricity sold Tuesday on the California Power 
Exchange for use today was $1,182.02 per megawatt-hour. Each day since a 
price cap of $250 per megawatt-hour was loosened Friday, a new record has 
been reached in the state's primary market for electricity. 
?????If that price were sustained for a month and consumers were no longer 
protected by the current rate freeze, the average monthly residential bill 
would jump to $620, Heller said. In December 1999, when wholesale prices were 
about $30 per megawatt-hour, the average residential bill for a Southern 
California Edison customer was $50. 
?????The so-called soft price cap, which requires power generators to detail 
the costs behind the price bid, is like one proposed by the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission, said Kellan Fluckiger, chief operating officer for the 
California Independent System Operator, which balances electricity supply and 
demand on the power grid serving 75% of the state. The move was intended to 
keep electricity from fleeing the state for higher prices elsewhere in the 
region and to help Cal-ISO run a more orderly market, he said. 
?????It is too early to tell whether the first aim was successful, Fluckiger 
said, but he added that the new cap has made life more predictable at 
Cal-ISO, where last week dozens of operators were making frantic last-minute 
calls to fill gaps in the energy supply to ward off blackouts. Those 
operators now can devote more time to running the grid. 
?????Electricity demand in California peaked at slightly more than 33,000 
megawatts Tuesday; about 8,500 megawatts of in-state power remained 
unavailable because power plants were undergoing maintenance. Electricity 
reserves fell to less than 5% late in the day when some power facilities in 
Utah suddenly tripped offline, cutting imports from the Southwest by 1,200 
megawatts. Cal-ISO then declared its 30th Stage 2 alert of the year. 
?????Customers of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power are 
unaffected by the power emergencies. In fact, the city-owned utility just 
brought two idled plants back online to help supply the Cal-ISO grid, selling 
nearly 300 megawatts Tuesday at cost, said General Manager S. David Freeman. 
?????"We're doing our best to be a good neighbor," he said. 
?????Cal-ISO had hoped to avoid declaring a Stage 2 emergency, which often 
requires power interruptions to some big electricity users, but a bigger 
supply from the Pacific Northwest kept the more serious emergency at bay for 
most of the day. The most serious of all, a Stage 3 emergency, was declared 
Thursday, when the grid was within 1.5% of running out of power, but the 
state narrowly averted rolling blackouts. 
?????The expected Arctic cold front, which had Pacific Northwest utilities 
warning of the possibility of the region's first-ever Stage 2 emergency, 
"wimped out on us," said Ed Mosey, spokesman for the Bonneville Power 
Administration, which markets power from several federal dams. Temperatures 
were close to normal in parts of the region, and "we're at Stage Nothing 
now," Mosey said. 
?????The outlook improves for later in the week because some power plants 
that were offline should be repaired, returning as much as 1,500 megawatts of 
electricity in the state, Fluckiger of Cal-ISO said. One megawatt is enough 
to power about 1,000 homes. 
?????In the last few days, several power plants that had reached their 
air-pollution limits, particularly in Southern California, were returned to 
operation through agreements with the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District. 
?????As a result, Southern California has excess power, but it can't send it 
to electron-starved Northern California because of constraints on the key 
transmission link between the halves of the state, Fluckiger said. 
?????

MIDWEST AND SOUTHEAST SUMMARIES

On 11/1/00, FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power=20
Markets in the Eastern Interconnection.  These reports were the result of a=
=20
Commission order earlier this summer.  Enron's Federal regulatory staff=20

information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discuss=
ed=20
many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff, Scott Miller=
=20
(who recently joined FERC from PG&E Gen).    While the Commission is under =
no=20
obligation to take any of Staff's recommendations, the Commission typically=
=20
looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues.  Importantly=
,=20
Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the=
=20
Southeast and Midwest -- all of which Enron has been asking FERC to impleme=
nt=20
for several years:

Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by=20
requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other=20
transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to=
=20
favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of=20
interconnection requests.

While the Staff Hotline is used productively, the Commission can direct Sta=
ff=20
to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of=20
complaints.

The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a p=
ro=20
forma interconnection process specific to interconnection, rather than simp=
ly=20
relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and=
=20
procedures.

Require TPs to retain real-time transmission data on market functions=20
pertaining to daily load, internal generation to meet that load, and import=
s=20
and exports.

RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC, as we=
ll=20
as standardized criteria for curtailment.  In addition, since even such=20
standardized criteria might not "get to the root of the problem" -- that=20
control area still control generation -- the Commission could require that=
=20
each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area. =20
Regardless of the implementation of these two options, the Commission could=
=20
standardize ATC and TTC methodology.

Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristi=
cs=20
similar to many other commodities, it is still viewed as "different," with =
a=20
reaction of price caps.  Staff encourages that basic decisions about the=20
regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a=20
traditional cost-of-service model to a model that uses markets to price the=
=20
commodity and services. =20

DETAILS  (Also, the reports contain good summaries of the generation,=20
transmission, state retail, federal reg. and other issues for the region):

Midwest:  The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission=20
Providers ("TPs") that control transmission, generation and load.  "As such=
,=20
they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission servic=
e=20
to third-parties and strong incentives to favor their own services."  Staff=
=20
received numerous complaints; however, due to the lack of information=20
available from TPs, Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated=20
incidents or wide-spread.  At the very least, the complaints indicate a lac=
k=20
of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participan=
ts=20
to rely on transmission access, thus harming the liquidity of the market. =
=20

TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest, with an=20
"enormous" increase in 2000.  The region showed a decline in peak load from=
=20
1999 to 2000 and a growth in new generation since the 1998 price spikes. =
=20
Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with=20
virtually no price spikes, TLRs climbed to record numbers.  The TLRs were=
=20
highly concentrated:  only 5 flowgates account for 41% of ECAR TLRs and=20
another 5 flowgates in MAIN account for 42% in that region.  Notably, even=
=20
though the NERC procedures for Level 3 TLRs mandate transaction curtailment=
,=20
78 of the 191 TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount.  The=
=20
total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are=
=20
not posted.  Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC, whose=20
procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties.  While the Commissi=
on=20
has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open=20
Access Transmission Tariffs ("OATT") where the Commission has the power to=
=20
enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act, in practice the Commission=
=20
has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions,=20
including the propriety of TLRs.

TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market=20
because load is not served by the least cost supplier.  TLR procedure is an=
=20
inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints -- curtailment by fiat.  I=
n=20
addition, the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increase=
d=20
loading on the affected flowgate.  The impact could be mitigated by one=20
control area per RTO.

Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for=20
price caps following the 1998 price spikes.  Some market participants belie=
ve=20
that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction=
=20
increased in the Midwest. =20

Market participants must keep track of, and follow, a plethora of informati=
on=20
in order to make energy deals, submit reservations and provide schedules fo=
r=20
service.  Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission=20
access, including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information a=
nd=20
protocols, particularly for ATC and interconnection requests, and=20
discriminatory conduct.  Unbelievably, key data was unavailable to Staff,=
=20
such coincident peak load data, system-wide snap shots for days when TLRs=
=20
were called, and import/export data.  This lack of data creates a market=20
inefficiency, because neither market participants nor regulators can fully=
=20
analyze market conditions in real time.  As such, the market is risk advers=
e,=20
eschewing long-term deals for short-term transactions.  Staff also noted th=
at=20
because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU, there is a mixed=
=20
incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the=20
IOU.  (Staff cites Richard Tabors' paper, "Transmission Markets, Stretching=
=20
the Rules for Fun and Profit.")

Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site,=20
particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments.  Examples were provided=
=20
to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improp=
er=20
implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss.

The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems; however, al=
l=20
three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and=
=20
native load.  These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO=20
exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security=20
coordinator functions.  Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region=
=20
of 61 control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM.  Th=
e=20
result is that ATCs can be different on 2 different sides of an interface. =
=20
Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staff's own ATC aud=
it=20
this summer was consistent with market participant complaints.  Staff is=20
weighing follow-up options.  The result of these problems is a lack of=20
liquidity.

Staff next noted the problems with unfiled "business practices," especially=
=20
on the next hour market.  Staff's audit of OASIS sites revealed several are=
as=20
of non-compliance. =20

Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently,=
=20
with equal and timely access to data, including ATC, CBM, TRM, and load flo=
w=20
input data.  TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information=
=20
transparent because of native load.  This incentive will still exist under=
=20
RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC.  ***  "As a=20
consequence, the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption=
=20
and have all transactions under the same tariff."  ***  The Commission coul=
d=20
benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require t=
he=20
TPs to retain data, including current real-time network status.

Interconnection Issues:  IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support.  Also=
,=20
Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits=
=20
or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely.  One solution is to ha=
ve=20
the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities ha=
ve=20
against IPPs.  The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide=
=20
variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the=20

Network service has inherent advantages over point-to-point, citing the=20

While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread,=

there is evidence of discriminatory instances.

Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies,=20

manipulation of ATC.  TPs have shown little inclination to improve the=20
transmission system and use many TLRs.

There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development=

of markets in the SE.  ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and=
=20
there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices.

TVA, despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets, has act=
ed=20
as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the=

SE.  This is significant because of TVA's size and location.  IPPs have=20
reported TVA's discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to=20
perform studies, excessive fees, and rejection of requests to perform=20
interconnection studies.

In addition, Staff cites the Florida Sup. Ct. decision against merchant=20
plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida.

Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE th=
is=20
summer.  Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power, than=
=20
the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices.  Peak prices were=20
radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better=20

generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages. =20

SE utilities reported that they have not used market-based rates to=20
extensively increase sales.  (Less used than in the midwest.)

The SE region lacks information, which has retarded the Staff's efforts to=
=20
discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the S=
E=20
(including ATC and TLRs).  Market participants seem to have less confidence=
=20
in the SE market than in any other market region.  This appears to be=20
justified based on Staff's investigations.  This lack of confidence=20
discourages investment and participation in the markets.  Staff concludes=
=20
that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how=20
transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs, since there are market concerns=
=20
that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations.  The investigatio=
n=20
found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings.  In=
=20
addition, several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data.  Staff=
=20
thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted. =
=20
Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commission's lack of=20
jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access=20
information.

The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lac=
k=20
of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits.  In=20
addition, the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission=20
capacity, much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to=20
interconnect.  Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied=
=20
Skygen's request for transmission stating that the only option was the=20
construction of an 80 mile 500 kv line that would take 8 years to complete.=
 =20
Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting=20
self-build capacity in the incumbent's territory.

ATC variations are a big problem in the SE.  SERC coordination of a=20
standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without=20
direction from the Commission.  An improved method and improved communicati=
on=20
are needed.

The SE experienced a 354% increase in TLRs this summer.  This increase rais=
es=20
the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitiv=
e=20
operation of the market in the SE.  Staff cites information provided by=20
Charles Y. that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC=20
criteria.  Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs d=
o=20
not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented.  RTOs=
=20
must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints.  =
In=20
addition, RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs.=
 =20
However, if control areas are retained, VIUs will retain mixed incentives.

*** As noted in the Midwest report, the manner in which load is calculated=
=20
weighs heavily on the value of this information.  This is an issue that the=
=20
formation of RTOs may not resolve.  Eliminating native load exceptions -- i=
e,=20
treating all load equally -- and placing all transactions under the same=20
tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provisio=
n=20
of transparent and standardized information.

Finally, Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FP&L, TVA is a=20
"problem area" for the Eastern Interconnect grid.  TVA is a transmission=20
bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer.  The current federal la=
w=20
and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of=
=20
deep and robust power markets in this area.  TVA simply has no strong=20
incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service.  In=20
addition, the Commission does not have full information on TVA.  Staff list=
s=20
a number of complaints against TVA, including unjustifiably increasing the=
=20
tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing, but not others, to sink and park=
=20
power.  Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the=20
development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential=
.

A Staff audit of FP&L revealed violations of standards of conduct, includin=
g=20
confidential information on FP&L's transmission system (including interchan=

Market Participants:

Be advised that there is a strong possibility that there will be 1000-3000MW
of firm load curtailed this afternoon.  In addition to ongoing issues
related to gas prices, some participants are now indicating that they cannot
sell into the markets due to credit concerns.

We are taking a number of actions to remedy the supply shortage, including
work with State and Federal government representatives.

will have to come from Enron.

I don't think we can do it from AAE since the coalition is dormant right now
and it would be nearly impossible to get clearance for the ad. One of the
problems we had last year was that getting approval from AAE members held up
or completely altered the ads we ran. So I recommend that Enron run the ad.
Also, the ad firm has edited our copy to make it easier to understand. I
will forward you the revised version. Since we are dealing with Congress, we
can't make things too difficult!

 <<revised enron copy_.doc>> Here's the ad agency's version. I think it
needs a little tweaking to make it more accurate (like the second line
should read "brownouts and high prices") but the copy is easier to
comprehend.
We're dealing with an audience that, for the most part, isn't familiar with
these issues at all.
The ad firm was also thinking about using a frayed power cord to illustrate
this. Let me know what you think....

This is the list that Kevin provided at his meeting on 11-17.  I have also 
included the matrix that Jim has compiled regarding each RTO's stance on 
these issues.  This matrix was made last week based primarily on FERC filings

I hope that this is helpful.

LADWP Continues to Shine Despite California's Dark Period
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis

Reduced electricity supplies across the state forced the California=20
Independent
System Operator (Cal-ISO) on Tuesday to declare a Stage One Power Emergency
for the second consecutive day. The Cal-ISO is calling on all California
electricity customers to increase their energy-conservation efforts, and
urging them to delay turning on holiday lights until after 8 p.m. Responsib=
le
for the reliability of California's electricity grid, the Cal-ISO declares
a Stage One emergency when the state's power reserves drop to 7 percent.
In contrast, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP), the
municipal utility that primarily serves the greater Los Angeles metro area,
announced that its more than 3.7 million businesses and residences are
enjoying stable electricity prices and a plentiful supply heading into
the holiday season.

ANALYSIS: What a sweet irony this must be for David Freeman, LADWP's genera=
l
manager. Just two years ago the municipal utility=01*the largest city-owned
utility in the United States=01*was ridden with massive debts and faced an
uncertain future. Now, LADWP in many ways can be seen as the only success
story on a landscape that is marked by one IOU maelstrom after another.


Let's take a step back and assess how LADWP was able to insulate itself
from the California crisis. Back in 1997, Freeman was brought on board
at LADWP (from the Cal-ISO, no less) to essentially save what was thought
to be a sinking ship. Straddled with $7.9 billion in debt, the need to
cut about 1,500 jobs and a likelihood of increasing rates for both resident=
ial
and industrial customers, Freeman's decision to take on the role of managin=
g
LADWP seemed like many to be a herculean task. Yet Freeman arrived at LADWP
with an aggressive reorganization in mind, including the primary goal of
lowering rates and becoming debt-free by 2003.

Early on, Freeman made a critical decision=01*one that in hindsight appears
to be flawless=01*for LADWP to opt out of deregulation while the state's th=
ree
IOUs (PG&E, SCE and SDG&E) continued down the treacherous path of=20
restructuring.
While the IOUs began divesting themselves of generating facilities as means
of averting market power issues (due to agreements established with the
CPUC) LADWP was a prime example of public power throughout the United State=
s
electing to keep the integrated utility model. In addition, Freeman blocked
ongoing attempts by a consortium led by Duke Energy to buy LADWP's trading
unit, and thus maintained control over the muni's generation assets.

Enter the summer of California's discontent. With demand on an unexpected
increase and supplies in questionable availability, LADWP found itself
having the upper hand. The wholesale market over the last year or so clearl=
y
has favored generators, and LADWP was one of an elite group of companies
that capitalized on the disparity between supply and demand. Critics accuse=
d
LADWP of "profiteering," but Freeman contended that the utility was just
taking advantage of California's flawed market. The truth is that LADWP
was in the right place at the right time, and maximized its ability to
generate cash via power trading, which it used to drive down its debt.
A shrewd move by any estimation.

The utility ran its plants flat out for most of the hot season, illustrated
by the fact that it got fined for violating emission standards. Some report=
s
indicate that LADWP earned about $45 million just from surplus power over
the course of the summer. These profits only added to what LADWP had made
in the previous year. Fiscal year 1999 wholesale energy marketing and=20
transmission
services generated $98 million, which, along with other sources of wholesal=
e
revenue, marked a growth of 118-percent over 1998.

The problems that were so well documented last summer have not stopped
with the onset of cooler temperatures. Ongoing structural problems within
the state of California continue to result in concerns about supply and
warnings of sudden increases in prices. As noted, the state continues to
face new challenges as generation that had been expected to be online has
been forced off, including a substantial amount from plants that had expire=
d
air emissions credits. A squeeze on imports from the Pacific Northwest=01*a=
nother
carry over problem from the summer=01*also has complicated the situation in
California.

And, while the state IOUs evaluate long-terms contracts with energy provide=
rs
(based on today's high prices), LADWP is free to continue with an aggressiv=
e
generation plan. Among its objectives are to add 2,900 MW of power generati=
on
within its service territory in the Los Angeles basin. The end result of
this would be less dependence on external sources for power and instant
supply available at times of peak demand. Also high on the list of Freeman'=
s
priorities is the development of generation from renewable or alternative
energy sources. Already demonstrating a good record for green power, LADWP
wants to cut its NOx  emissions at its in-basin plants by 65 percent by
2010. Toward that end, just this week LADWP announced that it has contracte=
d
for two additional fuel cell power plants that it will install in the Los
Angeles area. The first 250 kW Direct FuelCell power plant is to be deliver=
ed
in the fourth quarter of 2001, and the second in the first quarter of 2002.
A previously ordered 250 kW fuel cell power plant, announced last year,
is to be installed at the LADWP headquarters in the second quarter of 2001.


Along with having no worries about supply, LADWP customers also can look
forward to a 5-percent rate reduction that should take effect by 2002,
followed by a 10-percent rate reduction that has been proposed for 2003.
As criticism continues to mount against California's competitive wholesale
market, it certainly appears that LADWP took a prudent route by opting
out of competition and retaining its integrated model three years ago.

Markets Utility Stocks May Stall Amid Tech Rebound

NEW YORK -- Electric utility stocks, driven by strong power demand, falling 
bond yields and defensive-minded investors, have had a remarkable year so 
far. 
The Dow Jones utility stock index is up 36% year to date, while most U.S. 
blue-chip indexes are in the red. 
But in recent weeks many utility stocks have flattened. California's current 
power crisis notwithstanding, analysts note that we are headed into the part 
of the year when electricity demand slackens. 
Is the utility sector played out for now? Is it time to take profits and move 
on? 
Experts who follow electric utilities say much depends on the rest of the 
stock market. It's no accident that major utility indexes hit bottom in the 
second week of March, just as the tech-dominated Nasdaq composite index was 
soaring to its all-time high. 
Now, if tech stocks continue to recover from their spring and summer 
collapse, that could divert money from utility shares, analysts say. When a 
traditionally exciting sector like tech is red-hot, nobody wants to hear 
about utility stocks, said Doris Kelley-Watkins, portfolio manager of the 
Evergreen Utility Fund. 
Many investors who initially piled into utility issues in winter and spring 
were seeking a safe haven as Nasdaq plunged: With their high-dividend yields, 
big utility companies have long been favorite defensive plays. 
But then came the summer peak power-use season, and the country woke up to 
the reality of an electricity shortage. Utility stocks zoomed. The terrific 
gains "were a real boon to investors who came here thinking they were going 
to be bored," Kelley-Watkins said. 
Indeed, stocks of firms such as Dynegy (ticker symbol: DYN), Calpine (CPN), 
Reliant Energy (REI) and Duke Energy (DUK) are up more than 70% so far this 
year. 
Kelley-Watkins, like a number of Wall Street analysts, believes that the 
"easy money" in utility stocks already has been made. Nevertheless, there 
will still be opportunities in the sector as long as generating capacity 
stays tight--which it is sure to do for at least two or three more years, she 
said. 
Some new power plants will be coming online toward the end of 2002, 
Kelley-Watkins added, but the current supply squeeze has been more than a 
decade in the making and will not be quickly solved. 
Hence, some of the biggest gainers this year are utilities that have 
extensive energy-trading operations--Duke and Reliant, for example. They 
could continue to take advantage of soaring demand and unusual volatility, 
Kelley-Watkins said. 
Dynegy and Houston-based Enron (ENE), the nation's biggest wholesale power 
marketer as well as a major trader of natural gas and other commodities, are 
among the Evergreen fund's biggest holdings. 
Kelley-Watkins also thinks that Sempra Energy (SRE), parent of San Diego Gas 
& Electric, has made a good transition from a heavily regulated owner of 
power plants to an energy distributor and transmitter. But she shies away 
from Sempra's giant California cousins, PG&E (PCG) and Edison International 
(EIX, parent of Southern California Edison), which she considers too 
debt-burdened. 
Nobody welcomes a recession, but Timothy M. Winter, analyst at A.G. Edwards 
in St. Louis, said an economic downturn probably would help utility stocks, 
as many remain relatively cheap in terms of price-to-earnings ratios, and 
would continue to be viewed as a defensive haven. 
The presidential election outcome also matters, Winter said. Most Wall 
Streeters think a George W. Bush victory would be a plus for the sector 
because he probably would be more open than Al Gore to new power plant 
construction. 
Winter likes Progress Energy (PGN), formerly Carolina Power & Light, because 
of its dominance in the fast-growing Southeast. His firm also recommends 
American Electric Power (AEP) and Xcel Energy (XEL). 
Michael S. Worms, analyst at Gerard Klauer Mattison in New York, said 
although electric-utility earnings should continue strong into next year, it 
will be hard to duplicate this year's 20% average profit gains. "We had a 
phenomenal year because of tight capacity and high prices," Worms said. 
Utility stocks probably would have done well on such business fundamentals, 
but they also received a strong tail wind from the stumbling tech sector, 
said Worms. 
If tech shares have bottomed, and if the Federal Reserve speeds the market's 
recovery with interest-rate cuts, that will hurt the performance of utility 
stocks, Worms said. 
His top pick is Calpine, even though shares of the San Jose-based energy 
generator and marketer already have had an amazing two-year run, up 200% so 
far this year, on top of a 400% surge in 1999.

INDIA: Enron India unit local lenders to cut rates.

12/12/2000
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2000.

BOMBAY, Dec 12 (Reuters) - The Indian unit of U.S. energy giant Enron said on 
Tuesday that four local lenders have agreed to cut their rates on loans to 
its project which is under fire from critics for producing costly power. 
ICICI , Canara Bank, State Bank of India and Industrial Finance Corporation 
of India have all agreed to cut rates by 450 basis points to 16.5 percent, a 
spokesman of Dabhol Power Company told Reuters.
Dabhol Power Company is 65 percent owned by Enron and is implementing a 
two-phase 2,184 MW power project in Maharashtra. Phase one of the project is 
already in operation. 
The cuts will help in lowering the tariff at which Enron sells power to the 
Maharashtra government, he said. 
The spokesman said the firm is considering a reduction in tariff but did not 
reveal details. 
Last week, Industrial Development Bank of India agreed to drop rates by a 
similar margin. 
The spokesman did not specify when the cuts by the financial institutions 
would come into effect. 
The state government wants the project to be reviewed but is yet to take a 
final view. 
Enron says the high tariff would come down next year when it switches over to 
the cheaper fuel of natural gas from naphtha. 
The project cost of $1.9 billion is financed 70 percent through debt. 
Enron's project is among the few foreign power projects to have begun 
operations since India opened up its power sector in 1992.

Three Firms to Sell Natural Gas Instead of Selling Products That Use It
Terry Maxon

Reporter (TM)

Here's how expensive natural gas has become: Three companies decided Monday 
they could make more money from selling their natural gas than from selling 
products using natural gas. 
Natural gas prices hit yet another all-time high Monday, closing at $9.413 
per million British thermal units on the New York Mercantile Exchange. That 
represented an 83-cent increase from Friday's close, up 9.6 percent.
Two fertilizer manufacturers, Terra Industries Inc. and Mississippi Chemical 
Corp., said they were selling natural gas that normally would go to make 
nitrogen, ammonia or other products. 
And oil company Seneca Resources Corp. said gas normally used to boost heavy 
oil production in a California field would be sold instead. 
Jeff Shorter, vice president of TXU Energy Trading in Dallas, said he's not 
surprised to hear companies are selling their natural gas rather than using 
the gas to make their products. 
"I don't think that's the last of them either," Mr. Shorter said. 
He said he expects other companies to come to the same decision as Terra. 
There are a number of companies that have fully hedged their natural gas 
purchases at lower prices, and can make a profit that "far exceeds" what they 
can earn from selling their core business products, he said. 
He noted that the prices in spot markets Monday were even higher than in 
NYMEX trading. Gas for Midwest delivery ranged from $11 to $13 and $14, and 
New York gas was at $12 and higher. 
"Typically, in the winter time we have a great deal of volatility which you 
don't see in the futures market," Mr. Shorter said. 
Spot prices have been much higher in the West, where restricted natural gas 
supplies, shut-down generators and low levels of water for hydroelectric 
plants have contributed to skyrocketing electricity prices. 
Terra, based in Sioux City, Iowa, said it closed one of two ammonia plants in 
Verdigris, Okla., and its Blytheville, Ark., plant this month, so it could 
sell the natural gas used by those plants. It is profiting about $2 to $3 per 
MBtu on the gas it is reselling. 
"The natural gas price increase since our December requirements were 
purchased for Verdigris permitted us to sell a portion of those purchases and 
generate higher gross profits than could be realized from selling the 
products manufactured with the natural gas," said Michael L. Bennett, Terra 
executive vice president and chief operating officer. 
On Nov. 30, Terra said it was closing its Beaumont plant because it couldn't 
make a profit at current gas prices. 
Terra said then that its production costs would exceed selling prices when 
natural gas prices climbed above $6. When the decision was announced Nov. 30, 
NYMEX gas prices closed at $6.673 an MBtu. Since then, the prices have risen 
nearly $3. 
Terra said it would re-evaluate the situation toward the end of December. 
Mississippi Chemical said it was selling all of its futures contracts for 
natural gas to lock in the current prices. It said it would post a $16 
million pre-tax gain by selling the gas contracts. 
The company's president and chief executive officer, Charles O. Dunn, said 
selling the natural gas was in Mississippi Chemical's "best interests." 
"We remain committed to the nitrogen business and our customers, but we also 
have to take advantage of opportunities to optimize cash flow during these 
challenging times," Mr. Dunn said. "It is our belief that the current 
unprecedented natural gas prices are unlikely to be sustained during the 
intermediate term." 
Seneca Resources, based in Buffalo, N.Y., said Monday it would sell the 
natural gas it had been using for its steam injection project at a California 
oil field. It expects to post a pre-tax profit of about $31,000 a month, it 
said. 
"In light of the current natural gas shortage in California, we felt it was 
important to curtail our steaming operations and allow that gas to be used to 
heat homes and generate electricity," Seneca president James Beck said. 
In at least one case, high electricity prices have induced a company to sell 
off the electricity for which it has contracted rather than continue 
operations. 
On Sunday, Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corp. said it would close its Pacific 
Northwest smelters until at least Oct. 1, 2001, and was selling the 
electricity those plants would have used. 
Although it must pay laid-off employees a portion of their salaries, the 
power sales from December alone will bring Kaiser $52 million. 
Mr. Shorter of TXU and Mark Palmer, spokesman for Houston energy company 
Enron Corp., said the arrival of cold weather and the sharply higher natural 
gas prices have brought more companies to their doors asking for help in 
managing their energy costs. 
"Volatility is good for us," Mr. Palmer said. 
Mr. Shorter said the price of natural gas has justified a switch from natural 
gas to fuel oil for a number of their customers. 
Supplies of natural gas have remained adequate, but companies that didn't 
prepare for winter energy costs will feel a financial hit, Mr. Shorter said. 
"You're going to see a real economic strain in a lot of geographic regions -- 
if not nationally -- on the economic viability of a lot of these companies" 
that had no program to manage energy risks or had plans that were 
"ill-advised or improperly timed," he said. 
Terra senior vice president Mark Rosenbury said Monday the company will look 
at gas prices between Christmas and New Year's to see if it can profitably 
buy natural gas and reopen the shuttered plants. 
Mr. Rosenbury said he sees the current spike in natural gas prices as "an 
aberration" and expects prices to fall to historical norms of $2 to $3 fairly 
soon. 
"Maybe it's longer than I think. But the cost of finding, producing and 
selling natural gas doesn't command the price it's at today," he said.

Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2000, Business Wire)

SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 12, 2000--Activate emerged as a leading 
digital media services company, Webcasting a record number of live events and 
winning two industry awards to cap a year of dramatic growth. 
A majority-owned operating company of CMGI, Activate's business has grown 
15-30X across all key metrics, both in volume and scope of work. Over 8,000 
businesses employed Activate's broad range of digital media services, 
including production and distribution of online live and on-demand events for 
both business communications and consumer events. In addition, Activate 
experienced over 100 million streams in 2000.
"This has been quite a year for Activate," said Jeff Schrock, CEO and founder 
of Activate. "We've been fortunate to be involved in this industry from the 
very beginning and it has been exciting to see the digital media explosion 
over the last year. Activate's goal continues to be providing our customers 
with high-quality, cost-effective digital media solutions and we were 
fortunate to end the year on a high note, receiving two industry awards from 
Computerworld and Network World for our network performance and service 
offerings." 

Notable Activate milestones for 2000 include... 

NETWORK 

-- Recognizing the broadband evolution, Activate focused on key 
network innovations, including cell-based server architecture. 
Activate's advanced network boosts bandwidth efficiency, 
increasing the company's peak capacity and refining Activate's 
load balancing and caching techniques. These enhancements 
contributed to Activate's Blue Ribbon win in Network World's 
Streaming Media Review, beating Akamai, iBeam and Digital 
Island. 

-- Coordination and cross-connection with other content 
distribution networks (CDNs), including Mirror Image, Enron, 
Digital Island, and AT&T. These skills led to a significant 
role in MSN's multi-network Webcast of Madonna's London 
concert, which was produced by sister company Navisite. 

AUDIENCE REACH 

-- With over 40,000 Webcasts in 2000, Activate streamed more live 
events than any other service provider, including Akamai, 
iBeam and Digital Island. Live events ranged from concerts for 
the Backstreet Boys and corporate announcements for Compaq, 
Amway and Microsoft to Seattle Seahawks game Webcasts and a 
political rally for Ralph Nader. 

-- Activate experienced new peaks in bits-per-second simultaneous 
transmission, total simultaneous viewers and total bytes

Enron Sheds No Light on Consumer
DARRYL D'MONTE

12/12/2000
The Times of India
Copyright (C) 2000 The Times of India; Source: World Reporter (TM)

BY any reckoning, the ongoing controversy over the price of electricity 
produced by the US multinational, Enron, in Maharashtra, demonstrates how the 
power elite in this country has been guilty of waiving all normal checks and 
balances in its haste to favour this single producer. Indeed, as Abhay Mehta, 
the author of the incisive expose of the project titled Power Play says, 
there is little point berating the American company for taking us for a ride 
when politicians from parties across the spectrum and a galaxy of bureaucrats 
and public agencies vied with each other in rolling out the red carpet. 
Maharashtra energy minister Padamsinh Patil has now contradicted his 
coalition chief minister's assurance that the second phase of the project 
would be reviewed. This is not the customary double-talk of politicians but 
the tacit acknowledgement that Mr Patil's National Congress Party mentor 
Sharad Pawar was responsible as chief minister for pushing through Enron's 
first phase despite countless objections to what is simply the biggest 
purchase contract in India's history and one of the largest in the world. In 
1993, Mr Pawar went on record that issues such as the import of fuel, total 
foreign exchange outgo and presumably the power tariff were minor issues to 
be clarified and that the Foreign Investment Promotion Board would take a 
decision on them at the time of final review.
These are precisely the issues that are coming home to roost. With the 
built-in escalation clauses in the infamous power purchase agreement, which 
permits increases in tariffs with a hike in the dollar exchange rate among 
other factors, the price of power is now over Rs 7 per unit and it is certain 
to rise further. This will impose a crippling burden on consumers not only 
householders but, ironically enough, industries, negating the very economic 
growth that private producers like Enron were supposed to foster. When Mr 
Pawar capitulated to virtually every demand of the US company, the capital 
cost was already over twice that of comparable projects elsewhere in the 
world. 
Although Enron is often described as one of the world's leading power 
companies, it is mainly engaged in distributing gas. In 1993, only one per 
cent of its revenue was earned on producing power. Its use of imported 
liquefied natural gas as fuel for the Dabhol plant was some four times more 
expensive than coal, of which India has an abundance. The World Bank, itself 
an ardent votary of privatisation, criticised the project on several grounds. 
Since it would amount to one-fifth of the Maharashtra State Electricity 
Board's capacity, it was likely to have an adverse financial impact, the Bank 
stated. Consumers would not be willing to pay such a high price and it 
concluded, on economic grounds, that the project was not viable. The Central 
Electricity Authority (CEA) also pointed out that the project departed from 
the norm, especially in denominating prices in US dollars. However, Mr Pawar 
decided to bypass the CEA and overcome the objections of the World Bank and 
others. 
At the time, the opposition parties in Maharashtra, the BJP and Shiv Sena, 
accused Mr Pawar of corruption in shepherding the project through. Mr 
Gopinath Munde of the BJP made his famous boast that they would throw the 
project in the Arabian sea. When they came to power in 1995, they appointed a 
committee to examine whether the project served the state's interests. The 
committee accused the previous government of committing a grave impropriety 
under circumstances which made the Enron/MSEB arrangement on Dabhol lack 
transparency. It came to the irresistible conclusion that several unseen 
factors and forces seem to have worked to get Enron what it wanted. On this 
basis, the state government cancelled the first and second phases. 
The cancellation raised several protests. Manmohan Singh claimed that it 
could not be done. Then US ambassador Frank Wisner warned of the consequences 
(he joined Enron as a director the very day after he finished his stint in 
India). However, the redoubtable Rebecca Mark of Enron flew down to meet Bal 
Thackeray, the self-proclaimed remote control of the BJP-SS coalition, for a 
second time. On this occasion, she must have used her considerable persuasive 
powers to convince the Sena leader to backtrack on the cancellation and the 
government announced renegotiations. 
The total payments to Enron under the new agreement was a staggering $35 
billion over the project's lifetime and in a blatant misrepresentation, the 
government claimed it had lowered the tariff. The final straw was in May 1996 
when Mr Vajpayee's 13-day minority government ratified the Centre's 
counter-guarantee to Enron on its very last day in office. When the CITU and 
Abhay Mehta filed a public interest petition in the Mumbai high court against 
the project, the arguments given by Enron's lawyers and those representing 
the government were tendentious to the point of being farcical. Chief 
minister Manohar Joshi filed an affidavit to make out that his government's 
earlier allegations of fraud were made on the basis of newspaper reports. 
Enron got its way and the project went on stream. 
Even granting that several states were bending over backwards to attract 
foreign investment in the early nineties, the concessions which were extended 
to Enron were not merely extravagant but unconstitutional. The financial and 
legal guarantees committed the Indian state in a manner which no 
self-respecting country would endure. Much of the political-bureaucratic 
class connived at this subversion of the rule of law. The power purchase 
agreement in particular violated the Electricity Supply Act. The Maharashtra 
government's finance department had admitted in 1994 that if the central 
government paid the company any sums by way of its guarantee, these would be 
deducted from the state's RBI account. 
It is this unconstitutional agreement which ought to serve as the basis for 
questioning the entire Enron agreement in court. It is obvious that it is 
against the public interest and it could conceivably be demonstrated that the 
power elite has acted in its own interest and against that of the Indian 
people. There is already a precedent in Pakistan where a power purchase 
agreement with Enron which had a substantially lower cost per MW than 
Dabhol's was cancelled. Two MoUs which the Karnataka government signed with 
another US power company, Cogentrix, were also terminated.

Enron deal can be nullified: Retd SC judge

12/12/2000
The Times of India
Copyright (C) 2000 The Times of India; Source: World Reporter (TM)

MUMBAI: Retired high court judge Hosbet Suresh has stated that the agreement 
signed between the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) and the Dabhol 
Power Company (DPC), a subsidiary of US-based Enron, can be nullified. The 
DPC spokesperson was not available for comment. 
The state government would be within its rights to cancel the 1993 Power 
Purchase Agreement on grounds of protection of public interest, he said.
``The power that the Enron plant produces is twice as expensive as its 
nearest competitor and seven times as expensive as the cheapest electricity 
available in Maharashtra. The fixed charges, whether MSEB buys electricity or 
not, alone works out to Rs 1,000 crore a year for Phase I and nearly twice 
the amount for Phase II and the amount is to be paid for the next 40 years ! 
What public interest does it serve ?'' Mr Suresh asked in his opinion given 
to the Enron Virodhi Andolan. 
The implications of this agreement is to ``exploit'' the people, he said in 
his five-page statement, adding that ``the government has an obligation to 
end such exploitation''. 
Questioning the erstwhile Shiv Sena-BJP government's decision to withdraw the 
court case against the DPC, Mr Suresh sought to bring forth the 
inconsistencies during the alliance rule. The Sena-BJP had challenged the PPA 
declaring it as a ``fraud'' as it was not in keeping with public policy, 
consumer interest and interest of the state. ``This suit was withdrawn 
without any of the contentious issues on law and on facts being decided. The 
government renegotiated without complying any of the requirements under the 
law,'' Mr Suresh observed. 
``The concealment of relevant facts from the public, the unsatisfactory 
explanation for withdrawing the suit .... all lead to one thing namely that 
the government at no time had any regard for public welfare...,'' he said. 
Mr Suresh also pointed out to the earlier petition filed by BJP leader Ramdas 
Nayak who had challenged the contract to Enron as it was awarded without the 
process of competitive bidding. Mr Nayak's petition, however, was dismissed 
on August 19, 1994 and all subsequent petitions which sought to challenge the 
PPA were also given similar treatment, he said, adding ``without the courts 
going into he validity of the agreement''. 
``Electricity is not a matter of commerce. It is a necessity like light, 
water and air. There can be no monopoly in this. If someone wants to trade on 
these elements, he may do so provided he does not exploit the people,'' Mr 
Suresh said.

Green Mountain Applies To Be 10th Texas Elec Supplier

12/11/2000
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Green Mountain Energy Co. said Monday it has filed an 
application with the Texas Public Utility Commission to become a retail 
electric provider when Texas launches retail electric competition Jan. 1, 
2002. 
At least nine other companies also have filed applications, but Green 
Mountain said it is the first energy company to apply for a Texas license to 
sell renewable power, such as wind, sun or hydropower.
"We are looking forward to the prospects of doing business in Texas, and we 
are excited to see regulatory rules being put in place to promote 
competition, creativity and innovation in the marketplace," said Gillan 
Taddune, Green Mountain's Texas regional manager. 
The PUC has approved one REP application from a large industrial company, but 
the Dallas-based firm, TXI Power Co., only wants to buy electricity to supply 
its own plants. 
Other non-utility companies that have filed applications to be certified as 
Texas retail electric providers, or REPs, include: Sempra Energy Solutions, a 
unit of Sempra Energy (SRE); Enron Energy Services and Enron Power Marketing, 
both units of Enron Corp., (ENE); New Power Co., formed this year by Enron, 
International Business Machines (IBM) and America Online Inc. (AOL); and 
Shell Energy Services Co., a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group (RD). 
Affiliates of existing Texas utilities have also filed to become REPs. 
First Choice Power, a subsidiary of TNP Enterprises Inc. has filed. TXU Corp. 
(TXU), the state's largest investor-owned utility and Reliant Energy (REI), 
the second largest, also recently filed two applications to create two REPs, 
one to sell power to large commercial and industrial customers and one to 
sell power to smaller customers. 
More companies are expected to begin the certification process in Texas 
before the end of the year as market rules are finalized. Independent 
suppliers watching the Texas market include: AES NewEnergy Inc., a unit of 
AES Corp. (AES); and Exelon Energy (EXC). 
To be certified, an entity must hold an investment grade credit rating, have 
$50 million of net worth or have cash resources of $100,000. 
REPs will be subject to PUC enforcement actions, including penalties, 
suspension and revocation for violations. 
A pilot program involving 5% of the state's power customers will begin in 
June. -By Eileen O'Grady, Dow Jones Newswires; 713-547-9213;

USA: Big names dominate in Internet energy trading race.
By Gelu Sulugiuc

12/11/2000
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2000.

NEW YORK, Dec 11 (Reuters) - All bar the biggest of the much-heralded online 
energy exchanges are struggling to generate liquidity as the oil community 
sticks with tried and trusted trading habits, analysts and traders said. 
While most of the 30 online energy exchanges that have sprung up over the 
last year keep liquidity figures close to their chest, analysts say that the 
big names - IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) and EnronOnline - are pulling 
clear.
"You can juice up numbers any way you want, but the one that's succeeding 
today is ICE," said Peter Fusaro, president of energy e-commerce consultants 
firm Global Change Associates. "The others are floundering because they have 
no liquidity." 
ICE which enjoys the backing of such industry heavyweights as BP, Royal 
Dutch/Shell and TotalFinaElf, traded a total of 200 million barrels of crude 
and products in the month after it began operating in October. 
Like all the new energy platforms - which mainly host "over-the-counter" 
contracts traded outside regulated exchanges, - this is dwarfed by volumes 
posted on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX). 
Volumes on Friday alone on NYMEX crude for January delivery reached almost 40 
million barrels of crude oil and almost 25 million barrels of heating oil. 
Smaller online exchanges such as RedMeteor.com and HoustonStreet Exchange 
hosted online trades of just 3.5 million barrels and 2.5 million barrels 
respectively of heating oil in the entire month of October, industry sources 
said. 
TIED TO TRADITION 
Oil volumes have taken time to pick up because many traders are reluctant to 
give up brokers and switch to the internet, afraid of making costly mistakes 
trading online. 
"There are brokers that have been around for a long time and have established 
personal and business relationships with traders," said Tom Knight, an 
independent online trading consultant. 
Oil's recent dizzying price volatility has also deterred traders from using 
online exchanges, fearing that a swift market move could turn a profitable 
Web trade into a ruinous one in a matter of minutes. 
"You can't take your trade off (the online exchange) fast enough," a trader 
who uses EnronOnline and Altra said. 
Old habits dying hard in the oil community means the younger markets of 
natural gas and power hold the key to the new platforms' liquidity growth. 
Leading the way is EnronOnline, which boasts an average daily volume of $10.5 
billion and 35,000 transactions in more than 30 commodities, smashing initial 
targets of a $30-$40 billion yearly trading volume. 
Main competitor Dynegydirect has posted a total transaction volume of only 
$1.5 billion since it began trading Nov. 1. 
Traders and analysts said that EnronOnline is already becoming so big that it 
can set the tone for the natural gas cash market by itself. 
"On the ICE, players don't want to make a better offer than Enron," a trader 
said. "The only thing that's still not swayed by Enron numbers is NYMEX." 
THREE MODELS 
Among three competing business models, Dynegydirect and EnronOnline provide a 
market where players can only trade with the company that operates the site. 
Other platforms, like ICE, act like an intermediary, but provide only 
financial products such as swaps and options. 
A third group that includes RedMeteor.com, Altra and HoustonStreet focuses on 
physical markets and acts as a clearinghouse for oil, natural gas and 
electricity trading. 
Despite the slow start for some sites, analysts agree that more energy 
trading will migrate online as commission costs go down. 
Knight predicted that within five years more than 50 percent of crude and 
refined products trading will be done online, with gas and power shifting to 
the Web even faster. 
Yet only a few Web exchanges will enjoy the windfall. Analysts forecast that 
a wave of mergers and consolidations will leave only a small number of 
profitable online exchanges. 
NYMEX hopes its own online exchange, enymex, will be part of that group, but 
it will face stiff competition when it finally launches in the second quarter 
of 2001. 
"It will be difficult for enymex to compete six months for now with ICE and 
EnronOnline," Fusaro said.

Dynegy's New E-Commerce Site Had $1.5 Bln in November Trading

Dynegy's New E-Commerce Site Had $1.5 Bln in November Trading

     Houston, Dec. 11 (Bloomberg) -- Dynegy Inc., a U.S.
electricity and natural-gas trader, said its Internet trading
site, Dynegydirect, had more than $1.5 billion in transactions in
in November, its first month of business.
     More than $1 billion of the business came from new customers,
Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel said. Dynegydirect's customers
trade exclusively with Dynegy, not with each other. The Web site
has more than 400 companies buying and selling North American
power, natural gas and natural gas liquids.
     Dynegydirect plans to start trading coal, emission allowances
and weather derivatives in the first quarter. International energy
products and bandwidth are scheduled to be added in the second
quarter.
     Shares of Houston-based Dynegy rose $4.19 to $53.75.
     EnronOnline, the 1-year-old on-line market owned by Enron
Corp., the world's biggest energy trader, trades about $2.4
billion a day, or about $12 billion a week.
     IntercontinentalExchange, an Internet market for energy and
precious metals backed by 85 energy and financial companies,
traded about $6 billion in oil, natural-gas and electricity in its
first week in mid October.
     ICE brings buyers and sellers together to negotiate trades.
On EnronOnline, only Enron trades with other companies.
     Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, competes with ICE
and others with its PowerMatch trading system.

i also emailed peggy noonan to ask for any ideas. haven't heard from her
yet. she's been very busy writing some of the more brilliant commentary on
the current situation which i'm sure hasn't been allowed into the shapiro

speaking of stock prices, what the hell happened yesterday? i'm still a

have left -- even if it's into a has-been.

but while i have you gravelling, you could do something for me. i just got a
call from my old boss at enron and he is looking to hire someone as a
consultant who specializes in humor writing. they want to try a humorous
approach in taking on the monopoly utilities in the battle over electricity
deregulation. do you know anyone in the clinton administration who has been
responsible for some of the president's humorous speeches? or anyone that

two people here did stupid things (first me, by in a hurry giving

so: i apologize...being in a hurry is no excuse for being careless.....

here's the silver linings:

1. gma seems to have gotten it some other way later in the day, so from
there point of view, they aren't focused on where it came from
2. there is literally no one at abc who knows i know you
3. i give you my word that i will never be at all careless with anything
from you again, and won't let even one person have access to
emails/information from you...the person in this case doesn't know it came
from you (or jb for that matter, since i had already taken her name and your
name off of it)

again, i'm sorry.....i have zero tolerance for such carelessness, and
pleading being overwhelmed with work on the story is no excuse

ps: i hope you saw jamie's interview...it was priceless

You may think you've seen this, but don't be so sure.  There's lots of good 
stuff on this one - takes a while to see it all, but worth it (probably only 
if you're Republican, though!).  Be sure to click on "Palm Beach Pokey,"  
"GORinch," and the other links at the top of the page.  

Have a great weekend!  SRS

The wierdness continues.....

In the Senate:
After Burton's "proclamation" yesterday afternoon that Senate bill 78XX was 
"all Edison was getting, period," the bill was voted down in committee and 
never made it to the full Senate for a vote.
The bill will be "reconsidered" (i.e., voted on again) today in the same 
committee.  

In the Assembly:
Hertzberg's bill (82XX) got voted down initially, until Rod Wright switched 
his vote and let it get out.
82 XX then went to the appropriations committee, where it was voted out, and 
now it's scheduled for a floor vote this morning.
83XX, the bipartisan bill led by Wright (D) and Richman (R), was also voted 
out of committee and will go to appropriations today.

Will report back later this AM with any additional information.

Best,
Jeff

		 Subject: California Update 07.18.01

The Senate, the Assembly and the Governor are either poised to engage in very 
difficult negotiations, or the three are about to crash and burn and Edison's 
going to be left dangling.

In the Senate:
The Senate bill 78XX is with about 90% likelihood going to be voted out of 
the Senate tonight---without a vote having taking place in any committee.
Burton announced during one of the two "informational" hearings that "this is 
it," despite the view of just about everyone who appeared before the 
committees the bill likely won't prevent Edison from going bankrupt.
The key features of the bill are:
Banks and QFs get paid in full.
Edison shareholders would be responsible for debts owed to suppliers
No direct access.
There are conflicting reports about whether the Senate will take up the bill 
tomorrow de-linking the bonds from the DWR contracts and whether the 
Republicans will go along with it.

In the Assembly:
The Committee is hearing the Wright and Hertzberg bills as we speak, with 
Hertzberg's the likely winner.
That bill now provides for Direct Access under certain conditions (the 
amendments describing the conditions were faxed today).
We're attempting to get the "July 12" date changed to "the effective date of 
the bill" or later.
The Assembly likely won't vote the Hertzberg bill out until tomorrow at the 
earliest.

The Problem:
The Assembly and Senate bills are diametrically opposed in the way each 
approaches the problem---in short, the bills are two ships passing in the 
night.
The Democratic leaders (Governor, Hertzberg, Burton) aren't talking, and 
Burton hasn't expressed any interest in talking---to anybody.

The likely outcome given the circumstances:  
Burton says he's done what he needs to do (i.e., passed out a "fair" bill); 
the Assembly and Senate can't agree; they finish the budget; time runs out; 
they leave Friday; and Edison's left twisting.

That said, there's still a chance that the Governor could call Burton and sit 
down with Burton and Hertzberg and work something out by Friday, or begin 
talking and postpone the recess until they get it worked out.  But given 
Burton, the chance of that happening seems very slim.

In short, little has changed since yesterday.

Best,
Jeff

The article deals with the Cal ISO credit risk and the effect on power 
prices.  This is on the Enron web site.  
Maybe we work this into the talking points response?


       Reliant Energy: Selling Pwr To Cal ISO Could Be Risky 
       Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

       Dec. 11, 2000 
       Dow Jones Energy Service 
       (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

       (This article was originally published Friday) By Mark Golden 

       LAS VEGAS (Dow Jones)--BC Hydro's concerns about the California 
Independent System Operator's credit have spread quickly this week
       to other suppliers, forcing the grid operator to pay premium prices 
when it can't find electric supplies, Reliant Energy's (REI) vice president
       for western U.S. trading, Reggie Howard, said Friday. 

       Suppliers are concerned about the ISO's financial guarantees from the 
investor-owned utilities, for whom it buys: Edison International (EIX),
       PG&E Corp. (PCG) and Sempra Energy (SRE). 

       PowerEx, the power marketing unit of provincial utility BC Hydro, 
demanded letters of credit from the utilities for ISO purchases this week.
       Edison complied, while PG&E refused. Sempra said that the state of 
California should make the guarantee as part of a declared state of
       emergency. 

       Reliant is looking at the ISO credit issue, but so far has demanded no 
such letters of guarantee, Howard said. 

       Other risks in selling to the ISO include the possibility that state 
politicians will tell the ISO not to pay its bills. 

       "when you have state Sen. Steve Peace telling San Diego residents not 
to pay their electric bills two months ago, you worry about what
       might be said to the ISO. There are political risks," Howard said in 
an interview with Dow Jones Newswires. Peace, a democrat from the
       San Diego area, is chairman of the California Senate Budget Committee. 

       Suppliers also risk that prices on sales to the ISO could be reviewed 
by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission anytime 24 months
       after the transaction occurs, under the proposed FERC order on 
California. Prices could be lowered retroactively, and refunds from the
       suppliers could be ordered. Sales to other western utilities face no 
such review. 

       Taken together, these risks have forced the ISO to pay a premium of at 
least 10% more than market prices, according to several traders
       attending the Day of the Trader industry conference in Las Vegas 
Thursday and Friday. 

       "It could be 5% or 20%. We have a number, but we won't disclose it 
because that's proprietary," Howard said. 

       Reliant, which has 3,800 megawatts of generators in California, has no 
plans to build any more plants in the state. The company is
       building a plant in Nevada, just east of the California border. The 
optimal location for any new plant, Howard said, is near California, but not
       inside the state. 

       Howard said that Reliant isn't looking for offers to sell its 
California plants, but if a good offer came up, they would consider it.

Steve;

Just a few last minute questions:  as regards MD pre-ratings,  at present=
=20
only 32 of 81 MD=01,s are pre-rated; 49 are not.    Do you want them placed=
 on=20
the screen in their pre-rating category?  Do you want all MD=01,s prerated?=
  If=20
so we=01,ll need to chase up with the various BU=01,s.=20

As regards Accomplishments, only 24 of 81 MD=01,s have completed the=20
accomplishments section, 57 have not.

Finally, do you want the MD meeting to comprise two sessions i.e. Commercia=
l=20
and all other Peer Groups (as at yend), or do you want separate sessions? =
=20
Likewise, we can set the system up in all combinations, and you can decide =
on=20
the day of, if that suits you.

Look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.  Gina

I have some questions myself about the data contained below, but it is 
largely accurate, and for those of you following Europe from afar, I thought 
this summary was a convenient way to share with you the status of 
developments in Europe.   call if you have any questions.   mcs

Subject: Country and EU liberalisation summaries

All

Given the number of requests that we have for country summaries, Sadia has 
put together these two files.  The first of these files contains for each 
country of the EU, for power and gas, a description of each country's 
deregulation, and current issues.  I think we will update this every month or 
so.

The second file contains some EU wide stuff - maps of liberalisation, the 
flags showing liberalisation etc.

Let me know if you need anything else - our next step is to add reported 
price data.  These are also on the s:\ees\risk mgt\presentations shared space

Enjoy.

We thought it would be good to basically give Chair Hoecker talking points 
with any numbers that Enron provides.  We will visit on these later today 
when the numbers are ready (before 3:00).  Comments?

Here is my stab at the talking points  to be sent in to FERC along with the 
gas pricing info they requested for the California markets.  Let me or

supposed to be out of here at 2:15 today, so if you have stuff to add after 
that, get it to Christi.  Thanks.

Dear Rice Team:

We are in a critical time in the recruiting process as offers have been 
extended.  In order to ensure our cultivation efforts I have assigned a 
candidate for each of you to contact weekly, beginning this week.  

By taking "ownership" you will create a more personal relationship with your 
candidate(s) and help us to stay abreast of any questions or concerns they 
may have.

Please keep me posted regarding these cultivation efforts so that no one is 
left out.

Thanks again for all your work and participation!  

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Any merit to mentioning that there has been an initial "supply" response in 
terms of pipeline infrastructure - open seasons/expansion efforts on behalf 
of Kern River, Transwestern and PGT (not yet announced)?

Recognizing the time constraints you face, I've tried to 1) clear up a few

(1) As expected, GridSouth and Southern oppose EPMI's request to condition 
market based rates on RTO participation.

GridSouth argues that this is a collateral attack on the "voluntary" nature 
of Order No. 2000.
Southern also makes the same argument, but adds that the argument is 
premature due to Southern's "significant progress" in developing an RTO.  
Southern also attacks our citations to the FERC Staff Investigation stating 
that the Investigation is based on "perception," not fact, and contains 
conclusions that are "ill-formed."  Southern concludes that the "Southeastern 
bulk power market worked quite well" this summer because there were no price 
spikes.  Finally, Southern disputes our request for a settlement judge 
stating that the Commission should give Southern guidance first.

(2)  GridSouth responds to the Joint Muni, EPMI, etal. motion to hold the RTO 
filing in abeyance:

Grid South does not oppose additional stakeholder meetings during a 60 day 
period.  It would like the assistance of FERC Dispute Resolution staff and 
additional guidance from the Commission during that period.  GridSouth will 
provide the Commission a report on the process within 20 days after the 
conclusion of the this period.  

(3)  Southern requests that the Commission grant its declaratory order 
request that it can be an RTO

States that delays were due to discussions with investment community about 
spin off of transmission assets.  Southern would still like to have separate 
transmission company (Jim S. is looking into an Etrans opportunity with this.)

(4)  GridSouth response to protests

It contains alot of responses to Santee Cooper's protest about the ownership 
structure of the LLC
GridSouth argues that its expansion possibilities are limited by TVA to the 
West and VEPCO to the north (note: Grid South states that VEPCO joined 
Alliance because it is subject to the Virginia Electric Utility Restucturing 
Act that requires all suppliers to have access to the electric transmission 
system by 1/1/01 and retail choice by 1/1/02.  Any insights on this thinking 
by Grid South would be helpful.  Will all of VEPCO native load be under an 
OATT?)
Grid South will file interconnection procedures by 2/01.

John:

Thank you again for your help on this.  I think your points are valid and had 
a few thoughts that might help to clarify.

The State Department and UK Foreign Commercial Office developed these 
principles with the intent that the principles would serve as broad 
guidelines, general enough to apply to any company in any industry.  As you 
will note, with the exception of the title, the principles are general and 
applicable to any company involved with hiring security to protect an 
facility and/or asset - be it in the U.S. or otherwise.

I agree that we may need to distinguish ourselves from the typical extractive 
sector participant.  Should we agree to support the principles, I suggest 
that we draft the letter so that it  distinguishes Enron from the other 
participating companies. The letter (and maybe Dept. of State) could also 
note that Enron is the first company outside of the extractive sector to 
support these principles.  This would go a long way in demonstrating our 
leadership on the issue of human rights.

Also, we may want to consider that while we may be exiting the asset 
development business by selling our pipelines and power plants, we are taking 
equity positions (albeit minority and/or short term) in industries that do 
fall into the category of extractive industries such as coal and metals.  To 
date, we have already received inquiries about our activities in these 
sectors, particularly in the coal sector.

With respect to public accountability, we will continue to be criticized for 
not being accountable in this area unless we take some policies steps in this 
area.  Our stakeholders and "critics" are aware that we do not have policies 
and procedures addressing security arrangements.  In addition, they are aware 
that we have participated in this discussion and dialogue because it is our 
intent to strengthen our human rights policies and performance.  Until now, 
the weakness in our critics' arguments (with respect to India and otherwise) 
has been the lack of benchmarks and/or guidelines with respect to this 
issue.   However, once these guidelines are public, it will be difficult to 
maintain the position that there is a lack of consensus on the issue.

A risk we should consider:  should we decide not to support the principles, 
the NGOs and others will be asking us why we have not adopted these/and or 
any guidelines.  These guidelines are particularly attractive because they 
have been developed in collaboration with government, industry and NGOs - 
rather than by one particular interest.

I hope this is helpful and look forward to your feedback.  I am in the 
Washington office today, but can be reached on my cell at 917-821-0724,

Thanks again, 

Lauren

Subject: Security and Human Rights Policy Question 

We are finishing the legal comments to the Security and Human Rights paper 
that Lauren Goldblatt circulated for legal review, and will finalize it today 
ot tomorrow.

Before get the detailed comments out, however, there is a threshold policy 
issue that needs to be considered:

These guidelines expressly applicaty to the "Extractive Industries", which 
are typically thought of as the mining and oil and gas exploration and 
development industries. The companies listed as cooperating with the UK and 
US governments and the NGO's in producing the principles do not include Enron 
peers.  Enron has only one unit that is engaged in that economic sector, and 
that unit is being sold  right now. None of Enron's other units are in what 
would normally be referred to as an extractive  industry.

Since that is the case, we wonder if Enron has made an appropriate level 
policy decision to publicly endorse these principles and make them corporate 
policy when the company is energetically exiting its only remaining business 
line that is in the express industrial peer group targeted by the 
principles?   At first I understood that such a decision had been taken, but 
Vicki and I wanted to confirm that before proceeding.

There are two major concerns:

Endorsing the principles would would identify Enron more closely with the 
members of a particular peer group that Enron is consciously exiting and 
distingushing itself from.  

Once Enron endorses the principles, the fact of that endorsement, the 
resulting  public "accountability" for the principles,  and the consequent 
need to demonstrate compliance will become essentially a permanent feature. 
Once endorsed, it would be nearly impossible for the Company to distance 
itself from the guidlines. That being the case, should Enron at this juncture 
endorse the guidelines when it could do so later if it ever makes a committed 
re-entry into the extractive industry?

Are there other security type principles that are more appropriate to or 
focused on our new core business lines, or the remaining asset ownership and 
construction lines that Enron should be looking at instead?

Please call either me at 713-646-6309 to discuss. You can also call Vicki 
Sharp at 713-853-7413.

Thanks.

Steve,

This article came out last week while I was gone and I wanted to be sure you 
saw it.  Thanks, Ann


			
US AND CANADA: US administration faces crisis over energy policy: Whoever 
gets to inhabit the White House must face up to the fact that he will have to 
address problems not just in oil but in the natural gas sectors, compounded 
by the cut-off of Iraqi crude oil, reports Hillary Durgin:
Financial Times, Dec 6, 2000

			The alarm in world energy markets triggered by the halt in Iraqi crude oil 
exports at the weekend is the latest sign that the new administration - 
whoever leads it - will have to make US energy policy a top priority. 
			Even as the outcome of the presidential election has hung in the balance over 
the last few weeks, energy industry officials have argued that the new 
president will have to address problems not just in oil, but in the natural 
gas and power sectors that reached crisis levels over the past year. 
			The cut-off of Iraqi crude could have serious repercussions for the US, the 
world's largest oil consumer, particularly at a time of exceptionally low 
inventories in the world oil markets and shortage in spare production 
capacity within the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. That 
situation could easily reach crisis proportions for the US if other 
circumstances, ranging from unrest among Nigerian oil workers to cold winter 
weather across the country, affect supplies. 
			"For the new administration, this whole event is going to raise the question 
of energy security and US energy policy to the very top of the docket," said 
Amy Jaffe, senior energy analyst with the James A. Baker III Institute of 
Public Policy at Rice University in Houston. 
			The Baker institute is working with the Council on Foreign Relations, a New 
York-based think tank, to form a taskforce on US energy policy. "Whenever the 
new president takes office, he is going to have to cope with whatever the 
economic fallout is of this and the economic fallout is going to be huge," Ms 
Jaffe predicted. 
			Opec has only between 1m to 2m barrels per day of spare production capacity - 
far less than it has had during previous oil crises. Put in perspective, in 
the winter of 1989, colder than normal weather boosted US oil demand by 1.5m 
barrels per day. 
			For the first time in more than two decades, energy has become a focus of 
public debate. As energy shortages and high prices stunned the public 
following a long period of adequate supplies and cheap prices, these issues 
became a political rallying point and figured prominently in theelections. 
			"There is a direct correlation between interest in energy policy and prices, 
and energy prices are high, so interest in energy policy is high," said Robin 
West, chairman of the Petroleum Finance Company, a Washington DC-based energy 
consultant. 
			The position of energy secretary has generally been regarded as weak and has 
often been occupied by someone with little knowledge of the industry. Whoever 
becomes the next secretary must have a good understanding of the industry and 
be able to explain the complexities of the regulatory structures and markets 
to Congress, Mr West said. 
			Over the past two years, power shortages and skyrocketing prices have become 
more commonplace. The underlying problem, industry executives say, is the 
lack of a uniform, national policy to provide competitive, open access to the 
nation's electricity power grid. 
			Current regulations, for example, tend to favour regional power authorities 
and utilities in certain regions so that competitors have a harder time 
getting power onto the grid and transmitting it. In 1998 that problem 
triggered, for example, prices of Dollars 7,500 per megawatt-hour in Ohio 
compared with neighbouring states where they were one-fortieth of that level. 
			Another problem is the difficulty of obtaining permits to site and build 
plants in certain states. In California, for example, where shortages have 
become a serious problem and the state imports 25 per cent of its power on 
days of peak demand, 11,000 megawatts of new power has been proposed but 
can't get sited. 
			"The biggest energy policy issue we have is electricity," said Steven Kean, 
executive vice-president and chief of staff at Houston-based Enron, the 
country's largest merchant of natural gas and power. "Natural gas is not even 
close. Oil is not even close." Enron is pushing for legislation to ensure 
open, competitive access on the power grid and initiatives that would enable 
new power generation capacity to be developed faster and easier. 
			Closely tied to the problem of power is that of natural gas, which is the 
feedstock for virtually all new power generation capacity in the US. Prices, 
which are now above Dollars 6 per thousand cubic feet, hit a record high this 
week - three times the price of a year ago - as the energy industry has been 
unable to keep pace with demand. 
			Many in the industry are concerned about how the US will be able to meet 
future power demands unless more gas is developed. Yet while companies are 
busy drilling, they have been hard pressed to increase production. 
			Companies such as UK-based BP Amoco and Calgary-based Nexen, which have gas 
reserves in Alaska and Canada, are hoping that the high prices will make 
development and transport of those reserves profitable, but such projects are 
probably five years away. 
			At the top of the energy industry's agenda in accessing more oil and gas are 
efforts to reopen more federal lands to drilling. In addition, they would 
like to have equal access to oil reserves overseas in places such as Iran and 
Libya where sanctions prevent US companies from doing business. 
			The industry knows that forging a new energy policy will not be easy. But it 
realises it must push it to the top of the new administration's agenda. 
			"It will be a priority," said Chuck Watson, chairman and chief executive 
officer of Houston-based Dynegy, a leading energy merchant with large 
holdings in the natural gas and power sectors. "It has to happen, if they 
don't want Dollars 5 natural gas and Dollars 40 crude and Dollars 50 power."

Here's what's happening to Jeff Holmstead, the nominee for the EPA Air AA job 
who was the alternative suggestion to Whitman's choice Chris Hessler, who we 
were backing:

EPA Air Nominee on Hold

The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee yesterday delayed its vote 
on another controversial nominee: Jeffrey Holmstead, Bush's pick to be the 
Environmental Protection Agency's assistant administrator for air and 
radiation.

EPW Chairman Bob Smith (R-N.H.) "reluctantly" removed Holmstead from the 
committee's agenda Wednesday morning in response to Democrats concerns about 
his service during the pervious Bush administration. 
Committee ranking Democrat and Minority Whip Harry Reid (Nev.) has placed a 
hold on Holmstead's nomination until he receives copies of notes and memos 
related to the Clean Air Act and radiation Holmstead wrote while working as 
associate counsel to former President Bush from 1989 until 1993. Holmstead 
advised White House officials on 1990 revisions to the Clean Air Act. 
The hold has agitated Smith. "Throughout my service on this committee, I have 
never played politics with a nomination," he said. 
"Rather than focusing on notes that were taken a decade ago, my hope is that 
my colleagues would focus on the nominee," Smith said, noting that Holmstead 
has answered all of the committee's questions and has said he would provide 
the documents Reid seeks if he could. 
David Cherry, a spokesman for Reid, has said the request is reasonable. "We 
didn't make the request because we think there's information out there that 
could torpedo the guy. There's no smoking gun that I know of," Cherry said. 
"We just want a better sense of what his views are regarding clean air 
policy, and we've limited our request to documents containing information on 
issues he would have jurisdiction over." 

The committee Wednesday supported by voice vote confirmation of Linda Fisher 
as EPA deputy administrator, Stephen Johnson as EPA assistant administrator 
for toxic substances, and James Connaughton as the director of the White 
House Council on Environmental Quality. However, Reid has said he will hold 
floor consideration of Johnson's and Connaughton's confirmations until EPA 
publishes a rule establishing radiation standards for the proposed Yucca 
Mountain nuclear waste repository (see the 5/18 edition of Environment and 
Energy Daily).

Steve,

These documents would be useful in the preparation for your upcoming 
presentation in Madrid. 

The Eurelectric trip to the US (including their visit to Enron building in 
Houston) has been rather fruitful - attched is the report Eurelectric 
delegates put together upon their return from States and the slides from the 
presentation they made in Brussels for the Commission and Members of the 
European Parliament. Also attached is the memorandum from the European 
Commission on the Californian crisis. The bottomline message is that 
liberalisation process is not to be blamed for what happened in CA but rather 
a set of very complex conditions. Also, the Commission tried to highlight 
that a similar situation is highly unlikely to be reproduced in the European 
Member States.

Steve, 

John Hardy and I spoke to Kevin Hannon this morning about the status of our 
20k per month retainer with Kissinger and McLarty.  As you are aware, our 
office has suggested that we terminate or severely reduce the retainer.  ken 
lay has kicked the decison over to Rebecca McDonald, who has yet to make a 
decision.  Kevin asked me to send you an email and suggest that the contractv 
be funded by Ken Lay's budget or we terminate.  You may want to atlk to Kevin 
about it, but I think he is eager to get his P&L in shape.

Tom

EEI's State Restructuring Service Web Site was just launched last month and 
recorded over 11,000 hits in October.  We think that if you are at all 
interested in what's going in restructuring states in response to 
California's ongoing demand/supply imbalance, market problems in several 
other states, you would be interested in EEI's new Web site.

The State Restructuring Service includes:

o  News and analyses of noteworthy legislative, regulatory and judicial 
decisions as they occur
o  Implementation decisions in restructuring states
o  Noteworthy restructuring-related actions in other states, even if not of 
comprehensive scope
o  E-mail notification of all noteworthy restructuring and related actions
o  E-mails are posted to the Web site's Action Alerts section within 24 hours
o  Site's Action Alerts are browsable and fully searchable
o  Hyperlinks to all Web posted source documents are provided
o  Policy overviews and analyses of all comprehensive restructuring laws and 
regulatory decisions

The service includes e-mail notification of breaking restructuring actions, 
as well as full access to the Web site.  For those who just need a heads up 
about noteworthy state policy actions, the e-mail service is available as a 
separate stand-alone service (free to members) or for half the price of the

       Power sector restructuring: international activity, June - November
       2000


      This  mailing is a periodic update of the status of international
      electric power sector privatization and restructuring.


      Privatizations and restructuring activity continue apace.
      Governments faced with burgeoning power demands, but lacking the
      funds to meet them, are nearly universally opening their generation
      markets to foreign investors, even where privatization is not on the
      agenda.  More and more, state-owned utilities are unbundling.
      Competition is being introduced into national markets at both the
      wholesale and retail levels.  A few international players have scaled
      back their international investments and shifted substantial portions
      of their portfolio to less risky markets, such as the U.S. or Europe.
      Competition in Europe has been spurred by the EU Directive.  As Asian
      economies recover, most governments are starting to move forward
      again with unbundling / restructuring plans.  After a year in which
      currency devaluations caused a number of early investors to exit
      Latin America, a healthier economy has allowed privatizations to
      restart, but at a slower pace.


      This mailing summarizes recent developments in Europe, Asia-Pacific,
      Latin America, and the Middle East / Africa. Maps that summarize the
      status of restructuring in Europe, Asia, Latin America, and Africa
      and the Middle East are attached as Exhibits 1-4.  A slippery slope
      is Exhibit 5.  Timelines showing the opening of markets in various
      countries, by region, are in Exhibits 6-8.


      (See attached file: Intlmail 3 exhibits.ppt)













      February '99 marked the opening of the market to choice for most
      large EU customers who use over 40 GWh a year.  This accounts for
      about a fourth of demand.  As of "E-Day", neither France nor Italy
      had passed their proposed enabling legislation.  While the EU
      intended for the transmission operator to be independent, EDF intends
      to retain control over the grid, as will ENEL.  A phased deregulation
      of the gas industry began to unfold in similar fashion beginning in
      August 2000.


      Mergers, alliances, and consolidation are a dominant theme as
      companies jockey for position in the new European power market.
      There is a tremendous opportunity for international players to cross
      borders: as suppliers of new generation, as purchasers of assets
      being spun off by liberalization decrees (Italy) or because of market
      concentration rulings in mergers (Germany, Spain). Several
      international companies have opened trading offices in Europe, or  (
      Enron, Reliant, Southern, TXU).  HoustonStreet.com launched a
      European online wholesale energy-trading platform.


           ?  Austria:  Austria's liberalizing market is facing problems
              from within and without.  The EU is dissatisfied with its
              lack of G-T-D unbundling, although accounts were formally
              separated in 1999.  There is no ISO.  Internally, there is
              intense discussion about an accelerated market opening
              (customers over 20 GWh now have choice). Regional utilities
              are angry over the Verbund's proposal to open 100% of the
              market in late 2001. The Verbund, a 51% SOU, is the largest
              generator and owns the transmission grid. However, it has no
              retail customers and hence is strongly exposed to already
              deregulated wholesale customers. (C.B. White, Judith Lezaun)

           ?  Denmark: The 1999 liberalization law exceeds the EU
              directive's goals and establishes full retail access by 2003.
              Choice was phased in for large industrials using more than
              100 GWh in 1997;  the threshold dropped in April '00 more
              than 10 GWh; the next threshold drops to 1GWh at the end of
              2000. The new law includes unbundling of distribution
              activity and regulated TPA. Denmark has recently experienced
              a consolidation wave in generation that leaves the sector
              with 2 large incumbents. The trend is moving downstream into
              distribution and supply. Western Denmark is already part of
              the Nordic power exchange NordPool and East Denmark is due to
              join by the end of 2000. Energy policy aims at twenty percent
              of electricity sales would come from renewables by the end of
              2003, up from a current 10%. (Cecilia Bergman)

           ?  Finland: Finland has been fully open to choice since
              September 1998, when a metering requirement was dropped.
              Prices immediately dropped, but only about 2-3% of households
              have switched supplier. Finland forms part of the Nordic
              power exchange NordPool. The regulator monitors distribution
              tariffs and a rTPA regime is in place. In November '98, the
              Finnish government launched an IPO for 20% of Fortum, the
              holding company for the merger of utility Imatran Voima Oy
              and oil and gas company Neste Oy. The Finnish government
              expects to lower its ownership further. The largest new
              entrant in the market is Swedish Vattenfall, with its
              acquisitions of distributors and some generation capacity.
              Further M&A in the distribution and supply sector is
              expected. (Cecilia Bergman)

           ?  France: There was irony in France's push for liberalization
              as it assumed its six-month EU presidency.    France passed
              its electricity law last February, a year after required by
              EU directive, but had 30-odd implementation decrees stalled
              in the National Assembly.  However, EDF, which still controls
              more than 95% of French generation, realized Brussels would
              hinder its foreign ambitions if its domestic market remained
              closed. It recently convinced French authorities to open up
              34% of the market by the end of 2000 instead of 2003,
              lowering the eligibility threshold to 9 GWh/year (from 16
              GWh). EDF is also aware that its monopoly prevents it from
              easily entering the energy services market  -- leading EDF to
              promote a "relatively rapid" total opening of the French
              market. (Corinne Aigroz, White)

           ?   Germany:  While the Electricity Law was officially effective
              in April '98, real competition is still impeded by
              complicated TPA grid access conditions, especially on the
              retail market. A group of new entrants has organized to call
              for a governmental regulator.  Some recent studies have shown
              the cost of electricity so low on some bills as to indicate a
              "massive cross-subsidization between network operations and
              marketing." Recent charges have been made of obstacles to
              competition by a mulitiplicity of fees, including customer
              switching charges and supplier entrants registration levies.
              In the last 12 months, M&A among big national and
              international utilities has redrawn the German utility
              landscape: EDF bought a share in EnBW, Veba / Viag merged to
              form EON and RWE/VEW merged into RWE. Furthermore, RWE and
              EON must sell their stakes in VEAG due to antitrust
              authority.  Currently, several utilities are and battling for
              control of East German VEAG, whose transmission connections
              make it a portal to Eastern Europe.  (Judith Lezaun, White)

           ?  Greece: According to the FT, Greece has "hired a consultant"
              (us) to produce a 5-year plan for state utility PPC.  PPC is
              preparing an IPO for 15-20% of the company, theoretically set
              for 2001, but likely later.  Greece has been given until 2001
              by the EU to conform to the Directive. An IEA report
              suggested two major swift changes to the energy sector
              structure.  First, the government should create a clearer
              separation between itself and the state-owned PPC, including
              a separate regulatory agency.  Second, the government should
              consider splitting the PPC into competing generators to
              maximize competition, as well as improving market access
              conditions for IPPs and cogenerators.  As the country's
              largest employer, PPC is not likely to effect these changes
              quickly. (White, Thomas Read)

           ?  Ireland: Supply competition was introduced in February '00
              for customers over 4 GWh (28% of the market).  Opening is
              scheduled to increase to 32% in 2003, with further
              liberalisation in 2006.  No date for mid-market and full
              retail opening has been set.   Incumbent ESB plans to split
              off its transmission business, which will remain state-owned.
              Competition in generation will be introduced in 2002 with the
              auctioning of ESB capacity, which is intended to create at
              least two new players.  Independent power production has been
              allowed for two years now. (Ben Joyce)

           ?  Italy:  Italy approved its market deregulation decree in
              March '99; in some measures, it goes beyond the EU Directive.
              ENEL had dominated 80% of generation; by 2003, no entity can
              control more than 50%, or 30% by 2005.  This requires that
              ENEL sell between 15GW and 22GW of its 57GW by 2003.  It has
              separated G-T-D into separate legal entities and been 34.5%
              privatized.  A second tranche should take place in 2001.  A
              pool mechanism should be operating by 2001.  Consortia of
              industrials using more 30GWh/year can contract directly with
              IPPs; by 2002, the threshold will be 9GWh/ year. The
              potential free market currently amounts to 80 TWh a year, or
              30% of total demand.  This will increase to 40% in 2002.
              ENEL, who has a de facto monopoly on T&D, will retain
              ownership of the national grid assets; a separate state-run
              ISO, GRTN, will run transmission and dispatching.  A pool
              mechanism, operated by a GRTN subsidiary, should be operating
              by 2001; in the meantime, the market uses bilateral
              contracts. (Valentina Grifo, White)

           ?  Netherlands:  By June '00 three of the four large generation
              companies had been sold to foreign energy groups.
              Competition for large industrial users began in August '98.
              Large industrials (33% of the market) can currently choose
              their supplier.  By 2002, 58% of the market will be
              competitive, and in 2004, there will be full customer choice.
              The Amsterdam Power Exchange, modeled along Scandinavian
              lines, was launched in May '99.  The APX allows players to
              trade power over the Internet on an hourly basis for the next
              day.  In April '00, it added day-ahead prices at border
              points for Germany, although it is not yet much used; if
              successful, Belgium would follow. In October '00, the
              government agreed to buy the entire high voltage network,
              TenneT, from the four generation companies for $99.1 million.
              Their goal was to improve the supply market and to increase
              real competition. (White, Karel Tutein Nolthenius)

           ?  Norway:  Norway opened up to retail access in one fell swoop
              in 1991. "Real" retail access got started in 1995 when the
              meter requirement was abolished; switching got started in
              1997 when a switching fee was canceled.  The current
              accumulated switching rate lies at 14%. Distribution tariffs
              are regulated and transparent according to rTPA. Norway forms
              part of NordPool. (Cecilia Bergman)

           ?  Portugal: Portugal brought new regulations into force in
              January '99.  They include a price-cap system for determining
              tariffs and the creation of two coexisting supply systems:
              public and independent.  Each is locked into supplying the
              national grid (REN), a regulated and EdP-owned monopoly.
              Producers within the independent system can currently supply
              eligible customers who consume more than 9GWh/year at a
              single site.  The country's four discos may purchase up to 8%
              of consumption outside the public system.  Portugal's
              regulator, ERSE, needs either to extend the eligible
              customers or raise the allowed percent for discos in order to
              reach the percents required by the Directive.  The government
              sold another stake of 20% of state-owned Electricidade de
              Portugal in October '00, following two successful offerings
              in '97 and '98.   This offering raised $1.34 billion.  The
              state retains 32.6% and "golden share" voting rights. (Rui de
              Sousa)

           ?  Spain: After several major Latin American purchases, Endesa
              moved to restructure and consolidate at home, announcing in
              October '00 the merger with Iberdrola.  The resulting company
              would have 80% of the market, so it would be forced to shed
              generation and distribution assets.  It would also create the
              world's 4th largest utility, by market cap. There is also
              movement with the smaller two players.

              The Spanish regulator is applying an eligibility schedule
              faster than the minimum requirements of the EU Directive
              providing for full market opening by January 2003. Several
              foreign players are already authorized to supply eligible
              consumers and there are new generation capacity additions
              announced by some of the large international. Nearly 60% of
              the market can now choose its supplier.  A mandatory pool
              with a bidding system started in Jan '98. (White, Dominguez)

           ?   Sweden: Deregulation was introduced in January '96 with full
              retail access to all customer groups, rTPA and unbundling of
              distribution activities. However, switching was impeded by a
              meter requirement that was abolished in November '99.
              Switching is currently at 10% but with renegotiated contracts
              the figure is more like 25%. Sweden forms part of NordPool, a
              "common electricity market", a forum for physical and
              financial exchanges. Alongside NordPool is a bilateral market
              and an OTC market for financial trading. Consolidation has
              occurred in the distribution sector mainly and the generation
              market is concentrated in the hands of 3 large actors.
              (Cecilia Bergman)

           ?  Switzerland: In October '00, Parliament passed an electricity
              market law.  The first phase of the liberalization should
              start in 2001 granting choice to large industrials (> 20
              GWh); the mid-size market will open in 2004 (> 10 GWh). In
              2007, the law envisions a fully open market. Some aspects of
              the new law, such as the transmission tariff model, are still
              being discussed. (Chris Brombacher, White)

           ?  UK: With market deregulation complete (full choice since May
              1999), the UK market is now settling into a phase of supply
              consolidation.  Seven of the 12 RECs in England & Wales are
              now in joint ownership.  In the generation market, the
              incumbent's share continues to decline: National Power and
              PowerGen have divested further capacity, and now stand at
              8.5% and 6.7%.

              The New Electricity Trading Arrangements for wholesaling have
              been postponed to early 2001.  They will allow for a futures
              and forwards market to trade alongside the established spot
              market.  Markets will be run by independent members, although
              the balancing and settlement mechanism will be run by a
              system operator as before.  A bilateral power exchange will
              also be put in, and is expected to handle a much larger
              demand than the spot market. (Ben Joyce)







      In Central and Eastern Europe, privatization initiatives are
      continuing to attract badly needed capital, while the IMF urges
      reforms as a condition for funding.  Countries that are looking to EU
      membership have moved forward with power sector restructuring and
      gradual opening of their markets to choice.

           ?  Bulgaria: In January, the Energy Agency announced its intent
              to unbundle the state monopoly, NEK, into separate G-T-D
              companies.  NEK will remain a single buyer; 28 distribution
              entities have been merged into seven new companies.  The
              unions are opposing rapid reform, claiming the necessary
              regulations have not yet been written.  The government is
              working with the IMF to set up financial controls and
              eliminate cross-subsidies.  Between 2001 and 2005, all
              generation will be upgraded or privatized.  Transmission will
              remain state-owned.  (Csilla Ilkei, White)

           ?  The Czech Republic: In October '00, the Czech government
              announced it would sell a strategic stake in generator CEZ
              and in six of the eight regional distributors to a single
              buyer. Privatization is expected to begin in 2001.  Many
              Western companies, such as Vattenfall and E.On have already
              been quietly buying up stakes in small municipal distributors
              who need the cash to balance their budgets. A new energy law
              should be also approved by the end of 2000, which would open
              power markets to competition between 2002 and 2006; prices
              should reflect costs by 2002.  Gas liberalization will follow
              in 2005.  CEZ is testing its controversial nuclear plant,
              Temelin, which should begin operating by spring 2001. CEZ
              plans to cut wholesale electricity prices by 20% after the
              commercial launch of Temelin. (Kristina Kalinova, White)

           ?  Hungary: Since December '95, majority shares have been sold
              in the six regional discos and five gencos to Western
              investors.   Eastern Europe's  earliest and most ambitious
              privatization program has fallen victim to a host of
              problems, especially central government price control.  AES
              and IVO-Tomen tendered new capacity tendered in 1999, but AES
              is now bringing MVM to arbitration over its failure to sign
              its agreed-on PPA.   Hungary will partially deregulate its
              market after 2002 but before it joins the EU. Further
              privatization opportunities include a coal-fired power plant
              as well as the monopoly transco, MVM. (Cs. Ilkei, White)

           ?  Moldova: The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
              has expressed an interest in stakes in privatized assets of
              Modova, giving privatization scheduled for this year a boost.
              Majority shares will be sold in first in five distribution
              companies, then in three generators. The first attempt to
              privatize distribution failed to receive timely bids.  All
              companies will require substantial investment for upgrades.
              (White)

           ?  Romania: In September '00, the national electric company,
              Conel, was split into four independent units. These encompass
              fossil generation, hydro generation, transmission, and
              distribution and metering. Restructuring precedes eventual
              privatization, which will begin with distribution, followed
              by generation.  Current law requires foreign owners to have a
              local partner.  As Romania is one of the countries invited to
              join accession talks with the EU, it is opening its market in
              stages.  Currently, 10% (>100GWh) has choice; this will rise
              to 45% (>40GWh) next year.  Evenually, elegibility thresholds
              will be lowered to 20GWh, then 9GWh. (Cs. Ilkei,White)

           ?  Russia: In the mid-1990s, the Unified Energy Systems of
              Russia Joint Stock Company (UES; also known as RAO), was
              organized into 72 regional joint stock companies; UES still
              holds 49% shares in most of these regional utilities.  In May
              '00, President Putin fired the non-reformist energy minister
              who had blocked earlier attempts at privatization and
              liberalization.  The new minister is an unknown quantity.
              The head of UES has wanted to privatize significant portions
              of UES and to lift foreign ownership controls, currently at
              25%. (White)

           ?  Slovak Republic: In October 2000 the government approved a
              plan to restructure and partially privatize its energy
              sector; implementation legislation needs to be passed.  The
              plan would see state-owned Slovenske Elektrarne (the G-T-D
              monopoly) transformed into a 100% state-owned joint stock
              company.   Regional distributors will be separated from SE
              and merged in the first half of 2001 into three joint-stock
              companies, with a 49% block of shares to be sold.  Generation
              will also be separated and transformed into joint stock
              companies. Municipalities will acquire majority stakes in the
              heating plants.  The government will select a privatization
              adviser for SE and for the distribution companies in early
              2001. (Kristina Kalinova)

           ?  Turkey: The controversy over BOO (build-own-operate) vs. BOT
              (build-operate-transfer) arrangements for IPPs was resolved
              in January 2000.  Turkey passed a retroactive constitutional
              amendment allowing international arbitration for energy
              contracts.  Twenty-three BOT projects are affected.  Turkish
              economic growth is fueling a need to triple its capacity to
              64 GW by 2010.  In September, Turkey proposed an energy law
              that would separate state-owned TEAS into separate G-T-D
              entities.  Generation plants would eventually be available
              for privatization, while new plants would no longer be
              transferred to the government, but remain with the IPP
              builder.  The impetus for this proposed law is Turkey's
              interest in EU membership; only 1/8th of its 120 energy
              regulations meets EU standards.  (White)

           ?  Ukraine:  Authorities have announced the sale of seven of the
              country's 27 regional discos, in a transparent tender.   Such
              a sale has been unsuccessfully tried before.  Each sale will
              be for 25% plus one share. The distribution sector is beset
              with a host of problems including high non-payment, unpaid
              employees, and corruption.  The EBRD is pushing for progress
              on privatization before it provides funds to build an
              alternative to Chernobyl, which the authorities have agreed
              to close.









      Asian economies are recovering from the economic crisis and in some
      countries electricity demand is returning to pre-crisis levels.  Most
      governments are starting to move forward again with unbundling /
      restructuring plans in the power sector; although IPPs are facing
      ongoing problems relating to PPAs and lack of government guarantees.


           ?  Australia:  All customers in Australia should have choice by
              2003.  Victoria will to phase in full competition during
              2001.  New South Wales (NSW) has delayed full competition for
              residential users and small businesses to January '02.  The
              five other states plan to phase in full choice by 2003.
              Victoria's five distributors are facing revenue reductions of
              between 12% and 22% starting in 2001, whey they say will hurt
              their service capability.  Recent M&A activity has seen
              already- privatized Victorian distribution, retail, and
              transmission change hands, with new owners coming from Asia.
              ElectraNet, South Australia's (SA) transco, was sold as a
              200-year lease in September.  The National Electricity
              Market, comprising Victoria and NSW, started operating in
              December '99.  Queensland, SA and ACT will join in the next
              few years.

           ?  China:  China is aiming for nationwide interconnection,
              including Hong Kong, by 2010. Power pooling and increased
              interconnection is being tested in Zhejiang and Shanghai
              provinces.  As there is no process or body in place to
              oversee reforms, some believe that sector reform is a mere
              slogan. Investors are backing off of a number of planned IPPs
              following a government decision to cap the ROR for new
              projects at 10%.  Another issue is lack of government
              guarantees.  China plans to build hundreds of small rural
              hydro projects and to spend Yn55bn to upgrade rural power
              grids in 2000 as part of a project to bring electricity to 75
              million people who currently have no access.

           ?  India:  Five of India's 19 states have undertaken significant
              reforms: Orissa, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and
              Uttar Pradesh.  And, only four of the State Electricity
              Boards (SEBs), the principal buyers for independent power,
              are profitable.  IPP builders have been frustrated by a host
              of regulations, lack of guarantees, and SEB insolvencies.
              The growing Indian power deficit was dramatically highlighted
              this year by the withdrawal of two major investors, EdF and
              Cogentrix.
              A draft "Electricity Bill 2000" will be introduced in
              Parliament this winter.  It would create and empower
              autonomous State Electricity Regulation Commissions.  SEBs
              would be unbundled into G-T-D and corporatized within four
              months of passage.  Initially, states would initially retain
              G&D assets; they would later be privatized.  Transmission
              assets would be put under an independent authority, and TPA
              would be allowed.  Significantly, IPP licensing requirements
              would be clarified and reduced, and largely eliminated for
              the growing segment of captive producers.  A key problem of
              theft ? as high as 30% of T&D losses in some areas ? would be
              addressed by strict metering and high penalties.  The
              likelihood, however, of the Bill being passed as proposed is
              not strong, as it faces significant opposition both by unions
              and regional parties in Parliament.

           ?  Indonesia:  Indonesia's IPP program has faced problems over
              power purchase costs and project rates of return, with
              bankrupt state-owned PLN claiming it is unable to pay IPP
              operators for power.  Of 27 planned IPP projects, only three
              now supply power; six others are ready to generate.  PLN
              reached an interim agreement with Paiton Energy under which
              Paiton will supply energy for 10 months, at a rate said to be
              much lower than the original agreed-upon price.  Other PPA
              renegotiations will likely force IPPs to operate at a loss
              until the Indonesian economy revives and PLN's financial
              situation improves.  Unbundling is underway on Java/Bali,
              where PLN has created two generation subsidiaries.  Outside
              Java/Bali, unbundling of PLN will be along geographic lines.
              The Indonesian government recently selected KEMA Consulting
              to develop rules for a competitive market.

           ?  Japan:  On March 21, 8000 large customers (30% of the market)
              were allowed to choose a supplier.  This broke the monopolies
              of the ten regional IOUs for the first time, but high
              transmission access fees set by the incumbents are inhibiting
              true competition. Newer liberalization measures in the
              electricity and gas sectors have since been written --  an
              agreement was signed at the July G8 Summit which provides for
              fair and transparent non-discriminatory access to
              distribution networks in both sectors.  A number of new
              companies are entering (or planning to enter) the market,
              largely set up as JVs with local non-incumbents, often
              offering new products and services.
              In August the government awarded a tender to a non-utility,
              Diamond Power, a Mitsubishi unit, to supply electricity to
              the Ministry of Trade and Industry at a rate 4% lower than
              incumbent TEPCO's.  TEPCO plans to build a new nuclear plant
              to cut generation costs and plans to streamline operations in
              the face of increased competition.

           ?  Malaysia:  Jamaludin Jarjis was appointed as the new chairman
              of Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) in July.  He assured
              investors that restructuring begun three years ago by his
              predecessor would remain intact.  TNB will be transformed
              into two separate T&D companies by 2003, with an equity
              interest in generation.  Generation assets have already been
              separated into TNB Generation; thermal generation will be
              sold.   The government has approved the construction of more
              IPPs to meet the demand for electricity, which has grown 12%
              compared to the period before the economic crisis.  Work on
              the Bakun Hydro Project in East Malaysia has resumed, but it
              remains to be seen whether the project will go ahead as
              originally planned or on a smaller scale.

           ?  New Zealand: 1999 saw ECNZ split into three gencos to create
              further competition  -- Genesis Power, Meridian Energy, and
              Mighty River Power.  They have been corporatized but will
              remain under government ownership.  Legislation passed in
              1999 forbade ownership of wires (non-competitive) and
              generation and retailing (competitive) by the same company.
              Companies have until 2004 either to sell one business type or
              to set up a separate trust to own and run the businesses they
              do not wish to keep. By February '00, most had implemented
              full separation.  The newly merged (75.8%) NGC/TransAlta will
              be the largest energy retailer in New Zealand, with a market
              cap of NZ$2.1billion and more than 650,000 customers.

           ?  Pakistan:  Pakistan is trying to attract IPPs with negotiated
              PPAs which allow fixed ROR of 12%, but IPPs face continued
              lack of guarantees and other political uncertainties.
              Problems continue over Hub Power Company (Hubco), the largest
              IPP project in Pakistan.  Hubco is receiving significantly
              lower payments from WAPDA than originally contracted.  The
              government has alleged that corruption occurred when the PPA
              was amended in the 1990's, making the wholesale power tariff
              untenable for WAPDA and excessively lucrative for Hubco.
              More than 20% of plants have already been sold in a phased
              sell-off of WAPDA's generation.  Eight parties have been
              short-listed for the pending privatization of 51% of Karachi
              Electric Supply Commission, but the sale has been often
              delayed.

           ?  Philippines:   An Omnibus Electricity Bill, which will set
              the framework for the breakup and privatization of Napocor,
              is stalled in a House-Senate reconciliation committee.  The
              Asian Development Bank has threatened to withhold all
              financial assistance, including $100million in loans for
              power related projects, until the legislation is passed.
              Napocor is on the verge of bankruptcy and energy department
              officials are looking at several alternate options for
              selling the utility in the absence of a restructuring bill.
              Government-appointed advisers have also recommended that
              Napocor renegotiate some of its take-or-pay contracts with
              IPPs, asking some IPPs to reduce power off-take on an interim
              basis.  Napocor has offered the IPPs that accede to these
              conditions a longer life span for their projects, but
              developers are reluctant to accept because of their own
              financial commitments.

           ?  Singapore:  Since initial restructuring and corporatization
              in 1995 and the establishment of a pool in 1998, Singapore
              has lagged in power sector deregulation.  Investors complain
              that the market lacks clarity and that retail competition has
              yet to develop even though the rules allow competition for
              large consumers.  A thorough review in 1999 by the Ministry
              of Trade and Industry recommended that:  generation  be
              privatized, but with restrictions on generation
              cross-ownership; transmission and market operation functions
              be separated and an ISO established; and that most retail
              services be privatized.  The government has granted two
              public retail licenses, meaning that the two IPPs can sell
              electricity directly to large users.  Retail licenses are
              expected to be issued to the three power generators.  This
              will allow full competition for large industrial and
              commercial customers, but retail competition for smaller
              customers is unlikely to be in place before 2002.

           ?  South Korea: South Korea is proceeding with a major
              restructuring program, following government approval in July
              1999 for state-owned KEPCO to be broken up into six gencos.
              KEPCO will retain the nuclear assets as one genco.  Each of
              the five other gencos will be listed in stages on the Korea
              Stock Exchange; up to 30% foreign ownership will be
              permitted.  The privatized gencos will sell to KEPCO, which
              will initially retain its T&D services.  Later, a UK-type
              pool will be established where all generators will sell into
              the pool. Competition in distribution and retailing is a
              long-term target.  IPP projects totaling 2,515MW are already
              in operation.  Impending restructuring has not deterred
              foreign interest in several ongoing IPPs.

           ?  Taiwan: Two phases of IPP development have been approved, but
              only one IPP scheme has started up.   Developers have faced
              land acquisition problems, causing IPP schedules to slip.  In
              1999, the government announced plans to launch Phase Three,
              limited to gas-fired plants.  An Electricity Act is before
              Parliament.  Its main provisions include: privatizing
              Taipower without unbundling G-T-D; allowing other companies
              to enter the market as either vertically integrated,
              generation, transmission or distribution companies and to pay
              Taipower a fee for using its facilities; and the creation of
              an independent regulator, especially for tariffs.  IPPs will
              be able to supply customers at 161kV and above, and IPP
              prices will not be regulated.

           ?  Thailand: The 1999 State Enterprise Corporatization Act laid
              out a three-stage process for all state-owned enterprises,
              including power, to create fully competitive, restructured
              and privatized sectors.  A draft Energy Act is under
              discussion, while preparation and implementation of various
              technical frameworks are underway. Under the Act, a
              competitive wholesale pool would be introduced in 2003,
              although some sources doubt that it could be ready by then.
              It is also unclear how soon Thailand will have a transparent
              and independent regulatory body. EGAT transferred two thermal
              units to Ratchaburi following its IPO in October; EGAT also
              plans to corporatize and partially privatize its non-hydro
              plants by 2003.  Before the economic crisis, the government
              had an ambitious IPP program; EGAT now has excess capacity,
              so has delayed many projects.  Its long-term plans include
              the construction of a series of Small Producer Plants (SPPs)
              using renewable energy.  PPAs have been signed with 50 SSPs.

           ?  Vietnam: Vietnam is in the nascent stages of reforming its
              power system. Electricity of Vietnam (EVN) is an unbundled
              state monopoly, which does not even service rural customers.
              Local villages provide services to small farmers and small
              commercial businesses using thin wires and low standards. The
              World Bank has approved a $150million credit to Vietnam to
              extend grid electricity to about 450,000 households scattered
              throughout the country.  A few IPPs are trying to win
              generation projects.   An Electricity Law due to be enacted
              in 2001 would establish a National Electricity Office for
              regulation.   This would replace the existing haphazard
              village-level regulatory system.





      Profoundly affected by inflation and currency fluctuations, many
      Latin American countries have postponed further privatizations.  At
      the same time, ownership limits imposed by several governments limit
      further investments by companies who have already entered the market.
      According to the Inter-American Development Bank, privatization of
      electricity distribution and generation has been accomplished in all
      of the major Latin American economies with the exceptions of
      Venezuela and Mexico.  It estimates that 75 million Latin Americans
      are still not connected to the grid in rural areas of poorer
      countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and some Central American countries.
      Many of the countries that have not already implemented reforms are
      beginning to propose regulatory structures that would open markets to
      investments.  And for those who were already open, a new development
      is the increasing number of transmission systems being offered either
      as concessions to build or as full privatizations.  A big factor
      impacting generation this year has been the region's heavy reliance
      on hydro-power.  Serious region-wide droughts during the last few
      years have caused power shortages and scared away some investors.


           ?  Argentina:  The big news is in Argentina transmission sector.
              This fall, Argentina auctioned off 25% of Transener in an
              IPO, while also offering six lines to the private sector on a
              B-O-M (build-operate-maintain) basis. Endesa (Spain) must
              divest one of its two Buenos Aires distributors due to
              antitrust concerns  (Endesa's two companies are now serving
              40% of the countries 36 million people).  The regulator
              believes that the two holding inhibit its ability to evaluate
              efficiency and to set prices.

           ?  Brazil:   Brazil's wholesale energy market (WEM) began
              operating in October; initially, only 5-10% of power bought
              or sold will go through WEM.  As other contracts expire it
              will eventually supervise $15 billion worth of power.  The
              WEM intends also to create an internet-based trading system.
              The Brazilian system, 95% hydro-run, is dependent on
              plentiful rains to avoid shortages.   Demand growth has far
              outstripped GDP, while new generation is not keeping pace.
              Analysts predict a 15% shortage in 2001, with intermittent
              brownouts, while neighbors are building generation with an
              eye to exporting power to Brazil.
              Sao Paulo state will sell 38.6% of CESP Parana, one of the
              last large generation privatizations,  in December.  The
              state is incenting buyers by offering financing for any
              premium paid over the minimum price of R1.74 billion (US$
              901mil).  Brazil also conducted a successful action of three
              transmission lines in August on a build-operate basis.

           ?  Bolivia:  Ende, Bolivia's utility, was unbundled in '94 and
              has been successively sold off through capitalization (a 50%
              stake and management control).  To meet demand rising at 7.5%
              annually, the government has ordered these buyers to invest
              $296 million in the next three years or face losing their
              concessions; they have not fulfilled previous obligations in
              upgrades.   Generators recently defeated an attempt to allow
              distributors to generate up to 30% of demand instead of 15%.

           ?  Chile: Privatization in Chile is largely complete. Endesa's
              (Spain) controversial takeover of Enersis (Chile) will be the
              basis for its diversification into telecom, via its
              subsidiaries Enersis and Chilectra.  Partially in response to
              Endesa's vertical dominance, partially in response to supply
              conditions engendered by prolonged drought, and partially to
              increase competition, Chile has proposed new regulation plans
              which will open the distribution market and reduce node
              (unregulated) prices from 2MW to 0.2 MW.  Until now,
              transmission charges have been based on existing operating
              costs. Under the proposed reform, they would be calculated on
              the operational costs of an optimum network. The reforms also
              intended to remove control of the grid operation from the
              generators.  The proposed changes likely account for Hydro
              Quebec's being the sole bidder among those pre-qualified for
              the 100% sale of Transelec in September.
              1999 marked a serious recession and drought, seriously
              affecting hydro generators, which represent nearly 80% of
              Chile's generation.  Under the existing system, generators
              had no incentive to plan for long-term supply.  Chile hopes
              the new regulations will break down the entry barriers to
              generation and to introduce competition into distribution,
              heretofore a monopoly.

           ?  Colombia: Continuing labor strikes plus terrorist attacks
              against transmission installations have forced the government
              to postpone the sale of any further power assets, including
              Isagen, the state generator, ISA, the transco, as well as 14
              regional distributors. (A March attack, for instance, caused
              a blackout in 9 provinces and most of Bogota for six hours or
              more.)  The government claims to be reassessing the rules,
              but the reality is that the assets would not receive any
              decent offer now.  For now, 100- 300 million new shares
              (13.5% of capital) in ISA will be sold to the public at a 15%
              discount, to "democratize" the power sector. Since January
              '00, 90% of the market has had choice.

           ?  Cuba:  The first IPP began delivering power to Cuba's grid in
              October '98.  In order to curb programmed blackouts, it has
              invited foreign investors to help discover and develop new
              crude reserves.  Cuba hopes that 70% of its power will be
              generated from local fuels by year-end.

           ?  Dominican Republic: Blackouts still plague this nation a year
              after the government split state-owned CDE into separate
              G-T-D units.  Investors paid $750 for a 50% stake and
              management control of non-hydro generation and of
              distribution.  The new government is requiring IPPs (who
              provide 40% of the republic's power) to renegotiate the terms
              of the privatization contracts signed with the prior
              government.  In the hopes of increasing competition and
              lowering prices, the gencos are planning a power
              clearinghouse through which they will sell electricity to T&D
              companies.  It will, however, "only function when there is
              adequate electricity to meet demand."

           ?  Ecuador: The government has hired Salomon to oversee the sale
              of its power sector.  There is a current investment limit of
              39%, which may need to be raised to 51%.  The government
              realizes that reforms will need to come before privatization
              in order to attract capital.  Its largest utility, EMELEC,
              will be sold in international bidding to pay off extensive
              debts.

           ?  El Salvador: In October, AES bought Reliant's interest in
              three discos (privatized in 1998), which together serve 60%
              of the population.  CEL, the SOU, does not plan to privatize
              its hydro assets or the transmission grid for the moment.

           ?  Guatemala:  Guatemala sold two major discos in 1998;
              investors have made significant system upgrades.  State
              utility INDE still owns 45% of the country's generation, all
              in hydro.  It extensively encouraged IPPs in the early 90s
              with take-or-pay PPAs; IPPs are allowed unrestricted grid
              access.  The power sector, while needing new investment for
              the next five years, may soon be in trouble due to currency
              devaluation, high fuel costs, and the effect of the PPAs.
              Guatemala also needs to finish writing the implementing
              regulations to their 1997 law to encourage more investment.

           ?  Jamaica:  For the second time in four years, the Jamaican
              government has proposed a partial privatization of PSC, which
              handles all of T&D and 75% of the island's generation.  And,
              for the second time, it is Southern who is in the forefront
              of privatization negotiations.  It is still not clear what
              percent will be sold, but it seems likely to be a marginal
              minority of 45%, without G-T-D first being spun-off.

           ?  Mexico: The new Fox administration plans to revive
              electricity reform, tabled last year, without which energy
              cannot keep pace with economic growth.  Fox says there will
              be no privatizations, but an opening of the market.  Private
              participation in the distribution sector would require a
              constitutional change.  Many believe that constitutional
              change will be necessary to achieve adequate reforms.
              Mexico estimates it needs investments of $25 billion in the
              power sector in the next five years to meet growing demand;
              reserve margins are at 6%, while consumption is growing at 6%
              - 8% annually.  Without a clear regulatory bill opening the
              market to competition, investment is inhibited.  IPPs have
              heretofore been built on a B-O-O basis.  Recent tenders have
              included the option to build either in the U.S. or Mexico,
              with power dedicated to Mexico.

           ?  Nicaragua:   The privatization of state-owned power company
              (ENEL) is underway, following its restructuring.  Assets were
              first split into G-T-D companies.  In September '00, Spain's
              Union Fenosa acquired 95% of two discos for $115 million in
              an auction in which it was the sole bidder. High oil prices
              forced the government to postpone the October sale of the
              three gencos; two of the three pre-qualified companies failed
              to submit final bids.  Also, the political opposition has
              challenged the legality of the privatization in the Supreme
              Court.

           ?  Panama: Privatization of government-held IRHE is now
              complete; 51% of distribution and generation was sold in
              1998. The government plans to retain control of transmission.
              Foreign investors are involved in building some generation.
              The big news is the Central American integrated grid, which
              should join Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua,
              Costa Rica, and Panama into a single market by 2006.  The
              IADB is running project.

           ?  Peru: The new Energy Minister, Chamot, favors re-starting the
              privatization program, stalled since September '99.  SOUs
              mentioned for privatization were six regional energy
              companies, as well as a 850MW Andean hydro complex, Mantaro.
              It was not clear what form privatization would take; nor is
              it clear what will happen now that Fujimori has resigned and
              fled.  Peru also announced bids for construction and
              operation of two transmission lines.  Currently, only large
              industrials, representing 10% of the market, have choice.
              There are no plans to expand this.

           ?  Trinidad and Tobago: While there has been a partial
              unbundling of the generation arm of T&TEC, the government
              utility retains control of T&D as well as of all of natural
              gas purchases.  There been neither much IPP nor privatization
              activity since the sale of 49% of T&TEC to Southern and BP
              Amoco in 1996 and the financing of one IPP in 1998.

           ?   Venezuela: The Chavez government imposed an electricity
              restructuring law in August 1999.  Industrials can choose
              their supplier, but there are no plans to open the market
              completely.  A wholesale market is proposed for 2002.
              Venezuela has the lowest tariffs in the Western hemisphere,
              due to high subsidization.  While the government dithered on
              privatization plans, AES jumped in with a surprise bid for
              the ADRs of Electricidad de Caracas.  The government recently
              announced a tentative sale date of early 2001 for 51% of two
              regional electric companies, Enelven and Semda.
              Privatization has oft been postponed, most recently because
              of unknown effects of Venezuela's new electricity law on its
              rate policy.

           ? Virgin Islands: In September '00, this U.S. territory's Senate
             quashed a deal in which Southern had privately negotiated for
             an 80% purchase of the Water and Power Authority.  The Islands
             could use the money, but the Senate objected to the lack of
             bidding or transparency.  It was in principle opposed neither
             to privatization nor to Southern.






      African and Middle Eastern governments are increasingly opening their
      power sectors to foreign investment, although most have not moved
      beyond allowing IPPs.  Many Gulf-States' IPPs are for water and
      power.   Increasingly, power sector forecasts include reliance on the
      private sector for generation capacity additions.  Five Sub-Saharan
      countries have privatized their power systems: C"te d'Ivoire, Gabon,
      Guinea, Mali, and Senegal.  A few countries are beginning to discuss
      partial privatization of the entire government-owned entity, rather
      than spinning off G-T-D and undergoing separate privatization.


      Heavy reliance on hydro power in some areas of Africa have put
      pressure on prices, due to sustained droughts, especially in East
      Africa.   Droughts are usually not conducive to advancing
      restructuring agendas in different countries.


      A notable regional trend in both Africa and the Middle East are the
      schemes for regional transmission links.   The Mozambique
      Transmission Company links South Africa, Mozambique, and Swaziland;
      the West African Power Pool will link 16 countries; there is a
      Six-Country link underway between Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, Syria, and
      Turkey, and later Lebanon.


           ?  Algeria: Interior minister Khelil, who as a World Bank
              official oversaw the restructuring of state oil companies in
              several countries, is committed to "a profound restructuring
              of Sonatrach (the NOC) and the power sector (Sonelgaz)."
              Legislation was introduced this summer that would unbundle
              G-T-D, end Sonelgaz' generation monopoly, and allow for IPPs
              on a B-O-T basis. Some of the IPPs are intended for domestic
              consumption, and some for export.  Algeria is keenly
              interested in sending power to deregulating European markets
              via a new undersea link to Spain.

           ?  Ghana:  With a vast hydroelectric station on the Volta River,
              98% of Ghana's current power needs are supplied by
              hydroelectricity. Ghana's planned privatization of its
              distribution company into 4-5 regional companies is possible
              in 2001.  It is implementing a series of power sector reforms
              designed to provide Ghanaians with universal access to
              electricity and to transform Ghana into a middle-income
              country within one generation.  It is moving to reduce its
              reliance on hydro-power by allowing IPPs to build deisel,
              gas, and light crude plants.  Regionally, Ghana is committed
              to building a West African Power Pool (WAPP) by expanding
              electricity generation and interconnections.

           ?  Morocco:  Two distribution concessions are due to be awarded
              for Tangiers and Tetouan.  The concession covers the
              provision of water, sewerage, and electrical services to
              these two northern areas. Two earlier power/water concessions
              (Casablanca, Rabat) were awarded.  Morocco has an active IPP
              program; one of the plants was even transferred to the
              builders after its completion.  No sale of transmission
              assets is planned.

           ?  Nigeria: The IMF has provided Nigeria a $1billion facility to
              encourage reform and to support civilian President Obasnjo.
              In November, the government announced plans to privatize

              ailing NEPA, the SOU. While a draft electricity policy has
              been prepared, no details have emerged.  They intend to send
              regulatory legislation to the parliament by the end of
              December, which should include a framework for foreign IPP
              investors.  It is also likely that NEPA will be broken up,
              prior to privatization. Enron is supplying 270MW via 9
              barge-mounted power facilties off Lagos to ease the power
              shortages in this oil-rich country.

           ?  Senegal: Showing how risky foreign investment remains, the
              new Senegalese government has asked Hydro Qu,bec and Elyo to
              leave, less than two years after they won a 34% interest in
              state EU S,n,lec.  The current government, while
              acknowledging the advances made in rehabilitating old plants,
              cited cronyism on the part of its predecssors.

           ?  South Africa: Eskom, South Africa's parastatal, generates 95%
              of the country's power, and transmits it over national lines
              to municipal distributors.  South Africa is moving slowly
              towards restructuring and unbundling of G-T-D.  The
              fragmented distribution system will be merged into six
              discos, while plants may be grouped into gencos. Last year,
              G-T-D activities were "ring-fenced" to evaluate costs for
              each business.  A new structure for the electricity supply
              industry is being discussed, and the possibility of
              privatizing 30% of Eskom's power stations has been raised for
              the first time. Electricity regulators announced in November
              that they were considering three bids for the first IPP
              license, to be offered next year. While South Africa needs
              new generation capacity by 2004, it now exports power to its
              neighbors, and is very active in the creation of a regional
              transmission network.  Eskom has ambitions to be a global
              player, while continuing to focus on its development agenda
              of rural electrification.  Eskom Enterprises, the unregulated
              business subsidiary, is considering an IPO.

           ?  Egypt: In July, the Egyptian Electricity Authority was
              converted into a holding company, although still state-owned.
              It intends to offer 49% stakes in seven or eight regional G&D
              companies.  The sale of Greater Cairo Electricity, valued at
              $2.1 billion, will be first, although it has been twice
              postponed.  All capacity additions will be solicited
              competitively as IPPs under the BOOT (build- own- operate-
              transfer) model. This allows developers to recover
              construction costs by running a plant, while the state
              eventually owns the project without affecting its debt
              profile.   Egypt is part of a planned Six-Country
              transmission link.

           ?  Israel: Israel has been discussing restructuring and
              privatization for a few years now, but no real progress has
              been made. An electricity law passed in March '96 extended
              the Israel Electric Company (IEC) license for 10 years in
              exchange for its accepting 10% of it power needs (900MW) from
              IPPs, and another 10% from foreign developers. So far, only
              one IPP has been built.  Recent offshore gas discoveries have
              been largely in Palestinian waters; further exploration will
              be necessary before Israel, which has no indigenous fuel
              sources, knows whether it will have an assured fuel supply.

           ?  Jordan: With virtually no indigenous oil or gas, Jordan has
              been highly dependent on Iraqi oil.  In early '98, NEPCO, the
              state utility, was corporatized, and G-T-D was unbundled.
              Jordan's first solicited IPP (450MW) was awarded to Tractebel
              in May.  There is talk of relying on IPPs for further
              generation and of privatizing existing assets.  Consultants
              were sought in August to advise Jordan on distribution
              privatization.  Jordan's transmission grid was linked to
              Egypt in '98; the link to Syria should be completed soon.

           ?  Kuwait: Lifting a freeze on large projects, the cabinet has
              allowed two new IPPs (1000MW, 2500MW) with possible private
              financing options.  Forcasts for power show 5500 new MW
              needed in the next 15 years.

           ?  Lebanon:  After years of war, Lebanon is now engaged in
              massively rebuilding its infrastructure.  In April,
              consultants were invited to bid on advising Lebanon on
              restructuring and eventual privatization of its power sector.
              Lebanon was admitted in May to the planned Six-Country
              regional transmission linkup.

           ?  Palestine:   The outlook for Palestine's energy independence
              changed in a moment this Autumn, with offshore gas fields in
              acknowledged Palestinian waters proving substantial.  It has
              been nearly totally dependent on Israel's IEC for power.

           ?  Qatar: Officials announced in February that they had invited
              five companies to submit proposals for an IPP.  Foreign
              developers would hold a 60% stake in a plant envisioned to
              begin at 200MW, rising later to 1100MW.  A decision would
              turn on a bid of less than 5.5 cents/kWh to generate power.
              Qatari nationals pay no power or water tariffs.

           ?  Saudi Arabia: Saudi Arabia's 5% demand growth has created a
              need for an additional 50GW of capacity by 2020, much of
              which will need to come from the private sector.
              Privatization of the sector is being considered, as is an
              unbundling of G-T-D.  As a first step, in February, the ten
              power companies were merged.  In April, the Saudi Electricity
              Company was created as a joint-stock company, 50%
              government-owned.  The consensus among potential investors is
              that much needs to be done on the regulatory system, the
              financial framework, and on tariffs before IPPs become
              feasible.  For instance, nationals pay only nominal amounts
              for power.  Early considerations of BOT projects to meet
              soaring demand were shelved.

           ?  Tunisia: The Parliament passed enabling legislation for
              independent power in April '96.  While the government will
              continue to control D-T and international trade, all new
              generation will be open to the private sector.  The first
              IPP, for 471MW, is scheduled to come online in 2001.  It will
              produce 20-25% of Tunisia's electricity.

           ?  United Arab Emirates: The UAE is a confederation of 7
              Emirates.  Political power is concentrated in Abu Dhabi; it
              and Dubai provide over 80% of UAE income.  In '98, the UAE
              called for comprehensive restructuring of the power/water
              authority, and for privatization through IPOs aimed at UAE
              nationals.  While privatization in Abu Dhabi is still
              anticipated, Dubai has decided not to privatize these
              sectors.  Several IPPs are underway in Abu Dhai and Dubai, as
              both BOO and BOOT. The UAE's need for additional power may be
              met by a grid linking several Gulf States' systems, which is
              under discussion between the UAE, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Qatar,
              Kuwait, and Bahrain.

My public policy consultant here in London, Charles Miller, called me today 
to say the piece in the FT on Jeff's new role, written by Hillary Durgin, was 
the best, succinct description of what Enron does he had ever seen, and by an 
independent third party.  Just thought I wuould pass along the compliment, 
which you two no doubt had a hand in.   mcs

		Time to Move On  
		BY JOHN FUND  
		
		
		Democrats Mistook Static for  Votes 
		Robert Blohm - Princeton, New Jersey 
		
		Last Saturday's Miami-Dade court-recount, under a strict standard,  
reportedly favored George W. Bush. In other words the higher quality the  
vote, the relative greater likelihood it was for Mr. Bush. This accords  with 
testimony a week earlier before Judge Sauls by Gore's Quebec  statistician, 
Nicholas Hengartner. He depicted that "new" votes  "recovered" in the Broward 
County manual recount of rejected ballots were,  even under that county's 
less strict standard, biased toward Mr. Bush  relative to the votes before 
the manual recount: Mr. Bush had 34% of the  new (i.e. "recovered") votes, 
versus 31% of the votes before the manual  recount. 
		
		The three Florida Supreme Court wise men last Friday  fixed on two tradeoffs: 
speed vs. accuracy, and (higher) margin of error  vs. (lower) margin of 
victory. When it's hopeless to pin down an exact  number, the trend becomes 
everything. And the trend, the stricter the  standard, has been toward Mr. 
Bush. 
		
		You had to include overvotes  in any statewide recount, which includes 
optical ballots as well as  punch-card ballots. While punch ballots have a 
higher undervote rate than  optical ballots, it's the reverse with overvotes. 
Why? If you only touch  both candidates' spots with the stylus (leaving no 
mark) or a pencil  (leaving a mark), what registers as an undervote on a 
punch ballot  registers as an overvote on an optical ballot. 
		
		Undervotes can be  non-votes, or low-quality votes which may vary in quality 
with the voter's  mental ability. There is a level of mental ability below 
which voting  behavior is noise, unintelligible, unpurposeful. The issue was 
where you  set the cut-off point, and ignore incompetence. 
		
		The Democratic  Party has a practice of assigning no cut-off point, as if 
rounding up  derelicts to cast meaningless votes. It's as if Mr. Gore was 
trying to get  elected by assigning purposefulness to incompetents, in the 
face of  evidence that competence was biasing votes toward Mr. Bush.

Here is an additional paragraph from ENA legal which I will add.

Under the gas contacts of ENA, a diversion of gas as a result of governmental 
action would likely be an event of force majeure excusing the performance of 
ENA.  As an aside, you should note that the vast majority of ENA's gas 
business involves deliveries to its customers at various city gates.  ENA has 
very limited exposure to transportation or pipelines owned by local 
distribution companies.

Ginger - This has been tested and should now work for everyone.  Please 
forward this message to Rick's group.

Project Tracking (with RCRs) has been moved from the EES server to the Corp 
server.  We need to re-establish everyone's connection to the application.

To check to see if you have a link to the correct copy of the application, in 
Lotus Notes right click on each link to the application, then select 
Database, Properties, and check the server name, which should be ENE-NS05.  
If it is this server name, you can skip the rest of this message.

If that's not the server you're accessing for each link, follow these steps.

- Delete from your Lotus Notes workspace your existing links to the project 
tracking system.  You should have three links - Project Tracking, Projects 
and Contacts.  To delete each link, click on the link and press the delete 
key.
- Click on each of the attached links to re-load the system on the new 
server.  When you click each one, it will add the link to your Lotus Notes 
workspace.  You should be launched into the database as each database loads.


Please double check each link following the directions at the beginning of 
this message to make sure it's linked to the ENE-NS05 server.
- If the server name is different, please leave me a voicemail or send me an 
e-mail.

The Projects database is the one you'll access for project management and 
RCRs.  The Contacts database was created for future use, and the Project 
Management database is necessary for administrative purposes.

DJ Edison To Call For End To Calif Elec
                  Dereg Wed -Sources

                  Copyright (c) 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.


                  LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Edison International (EIX),
saying the current state of
                  California's power markets threatens the company with
bankruptcy, will call Wednesday
                  for an end to California's four-year experiment with
deregulation, sources familiar with
                  the issue told Dow Jones Newswires.

                       John Bryson, chief executive of Edison International,
is expected to announce that
                  the company's regulated utility unit, Southern California
Edison, won't be able to
                  recover more than $3 billion in losses related to power
purchases and continue serving
                  its retail customers unless the state's deregulated market
structure is scrapped.

                       In a move tantamount to a call for reregulation,
Edison will propose to break ground
                  on new power plants within 90 days and re-enter the
power-generation business
                  Southern California Edison was required to exit under the
state's landmark 1996
                  deregulation law, the sources said.

                       Edison plans to follow the announcement by filing a
request with state regulators to
                  increase retail electricity rates by as much as 20%, the
sources said, even though
                  regulators rejected Edison's request for a rate increase
of 10% last week.

                       The utility has lined up the support of some state
lawmakers for the broader
                  proposal, which would require action by the state
legislature, the sources said.

                       Southern California Edison, with 4.2 million
customers, is one of the country's largest
                  electric utilities. Edison was the first of the state's
utilities to sign on to the deregulation
                  effort and, as it says on its Web site, "played a central
role in the restructuring of the
                  electric industry in California."

                       Among the concessions won by utilities in 1996 is the
rate freeze, which they
                  demanded to help them recover costs related to
deregulation but which is now
                  producing huge losses.

                       Edison's current losses stem from an imbalance
between the soaring prices it must
                  pay to purchase power on the wholesale markets and the
fixed rate at which it can sell
                  power to its customers.

                       About half of those losses are offset the utility's
own power sales revenues, which
                  are accounted for separately and used to pay down
deregulation-related debt. Rising
                  power costs have produced a surplus in that account.
Edison wouldn't reveal the
                  current size of the surplus, but said previously that the
California Power Exchange paid
                  the utility $1.3 billion over its generating costs for
power through the end of September,
                  at a time when its power-purchase losses were $2.4
billion.

                       Power-Purchase Losses Mounting



                       The net losses continue to mount. California's
wholesale power prices hovered at
                  record levels all summer and spiked even higher in the
past two weeks, as colder
                  weather arrived in the Northwest at a time when much of
California's power supply was
                  down for maintenance.

                       The price of power for delivery Wednesday in
California hit an average of $1,182 a
                  megawatt-hour Tuesday, up from $250 a megawatt-hour a week
ago, the result of high
                  demand and a decision by California's wholesale market
operator to lift its cap on prices.

                       The rate Southern California Edison can charge its
retail customers, however, is fixed
                  at $66/MWh.

                       Last week, Merrill Lynch & Co. (MER) downgraded its
ratings for Edison
                  International and PG&E Corp. (PCG), the parent of
California's other major utility, Pacific
                  Gas & Electric, to neutral, saying the utilities may be
forced to file for bankruptcy if the
                  state doesn't allow them to raise their retail rates.

                       A Morgan Stanley Dean Witter (MDW) analyst drew the
same conclusion Monday,
                  also cutting his rating to neutral.

                       Edison to this point has kept its power-purchase
losses off its earnings statement, in
                  hopes that a political or regulatory solution will allow
them to be collected later.

                       The California Public Utilities Commission put the
hope of such a solution further out
                  of reach last week, however, when it ruled against rate
increases sought by Edison and
                  PG&E.

                       Credit rating agency Fitch Inc. on Monday lowered its
ratings for Edison
                  International and Southern California Edison's senior
unsecured debt to the A-minus
                  level, citing "increased liquidity pressure" and
uncertainty about the utilities' ability to
                  recover the costs of their power purchases. The agency
downgraded Edison
                  International, the parent, because half its consolidated
cash flow is provided by
                  Southern California Edison.

                       Edison - which sources said plans to remain in the
retail electricity business - said
                  late last week that it has secured a $1 billion line of
credit and expects to have enough
                  cash on hand to continue to pay for wholesale electricity
for the next several months.

                       California paid more than $1 billion for power last
week, sources said. Some of that,
                  however, was paid to Southern California Edison, which
still generates about 2,800
                  megawatts of power in the state.

                       Shares in Edison International have fallen 21% over
the past three weeks. They
                  closed Wednesday at $18.56, down $0.06.

Edison Mission Energy Power Project Starts Construction After Expedited
Approval By California Energy Commission

 Monday December 11 6:39pm
 Source: Dow Jones

 Operation Targeted for August

 IRVINE, Calif., Dec. 11 /PRNewswire/ -- Edison Mission Energy (EME), an
Edison International company (NYSE: EIX), started construction of its new
 Sunrise power plant on Thursday, December 7, having received expedited
approval from the California Energy Commission (CEC) to proceed. The
 power generation facility will be located in Kern County, California, and
will bring both short- and long-term generation capacity to the state, which
is in
 dire need of new power generation.

 "From the onset of the California power crisis, we have sought to find
means to bring new power to the California market," said John E. Bryson,
 chairman and CEO of Edison International. "This CEC approval will help
ensure that this critical new project will be able to provide a significant
amount
 of new peaking power to the state as soon as next August. Our thanks and
appreciation go to the California Energy Commission, and the
 environmental and regulatory agencies for their swift consideration of this
important project."

 "This power has been offered by contract to the state so that the pricing
for it does not depend on California's broken deregulated power market,"
said
 Alan J. Fohrer, president and CEO of EME. "Alternatively, EME will seek to
enter into a long-term, cost-based contract with either Pacific Gas &
 Electric Company or San Diego Gas & Electric Company to further ensure that
California's consumers reap the benefit of this additional power
 resource," Fohrer said.

 The Sunrise Power Project will be completed in two phases. Phase 1 will
consist of a 320-megawatt (MW), simple-cycle peaking facility scheduled to
 be in service during the summer 2001. Phase 2 will convert the peaking
facility to a 560-MW, combined-cycle operation with an in-service date of
 summer 2003. The project will meet or exceed all pertinent environmental
and safety standards.

 Final regulatory approvals have been received for Phase I of the project
only.

 EME will be seeking expedited permitting approval for the Phase II
expansion in line with the fast-track approval process recently enacted by
the
 California legislature.

 EME has also negotiated an agreement with the labor unions for an adequate
supply of highly skilled labor in order to achieve an accelerated
 construction schedule. The accelerated schedule is aimed at providing this
additional power to California by next summer.

 Edison Mission Energy specializes in the development, acquisition,
construction management and operation of global power production facilities.
As
 one of the world's leading global power producers, Edison Mission Energy
owns nearly 23,000 megawatts of generating capacity, including interests in
 75 projects currently under construction or operating in Australia,
Indonesia, Italy, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Spain, Thailand, Turkey, the
United
 Kingdom and the United States.

 Based in Rosemead, Calif., Edison International is a premier international
electric power generator, distributor and structured finance provider. With
a
 portfolio of approximately 28,000 megawatts, Edison International is an
industry leader in privatized, deregulated and incentive-regulated markets
and
 power generation. It is the parent company of Edison Mission Energy,
Southern California Edison, Edison Capita, Edison Enterprises and Edison
 O&M Services.

15 USC 3361 allows the President to declare a natural gas supply emergency if 
there is a severe shortage or one is imminent in the US or any region 
thereof.  I have not examined this section in detail, and I think it may 
address allocation more than anything, but it may be something we want to 
look at.  I don't think it was repealed in 89 ir 92.

Senate asked to hold Reliant in contempt over document release
By DON THOMPSON
Associated Press Writer

SACRAMENTO (AP) - A Senate committee investigating possible price gouging in 
California's energy market voted unanimously Wednesday to ask the full Senate 
to find Houston-based Reliant Energy in contempt for failing to comply with a 
subpoena for documents. 
The decision came despite Reliant's last-ditch offer to turn over 10,000 
documents under a contingent confidentiality agreement that the Senate Select 
Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation rejected.
"I'm not just trying to buy time," said Reliant attorney Charles J. Stevens. 
"We believe we have acted cooperatively. We believe we have a good-faith 
legal dispute." 
"It's clear you're trying to work with us. It's not contempt with contempt," 
agreed committee Chair Joseph Dunn, D-Santa Ana. 
By contrast, Sen. Steve Peace, D-Chula Vista, blasted Reliant's "shoddy 
behavior" before backing what he termed "a legally unprecedented step." 
If the full Senate imposes sanctions against Reliant, it will be the first 
time since 1929, when the Senate voted to jail reluctant witnesses during a 
committee investigation of price fixing and price gouging allegations 
involving cement sales to the state. 
There are no set penalties, said committee special counsel Laurence Drivon. 
By law, "the Senate can take such action as it deems necessary and 
appropriate." 
The contempt citation will be presented to the Senate Thursday, but will 
immediately be sent to the Rules Committee for another hearing before the 
full Senate acts, Dunn said. 
He said the committee had no choice but to seek the sanctions and likely 
force a court battle after it was unable to reach agreement with Reliant over 
the confidentiality of its documents. The committee voted 6-0 in favor of the 
contempt finding. 
"If we reach agreement on these issues, the process would be terminated 
immediately," Dunn said. 
In that light, the committee stepped back from its contempt vote last week 
against Enron Corp. after the company and committee moved closer to agreement 
over its release of thousands of documents stored in Texas. 
Enron sued the committee last week to stop the subpoena of its financial and 
electricity trading records. Among its objections are that only the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission has the authority to investigate wholesale 
markets. 
Reliant, like Enron, had argued the company's financial papers are outside 
the committee's jurisdiction because most of its operations and paperwork are 
outside California. 
Atlanta-based Mirant Inc. also at least temporarily avoided a contempt 
citation by agreeing to turn over subpoenaed documents. The committee will 
review both companies' compliance in 30 days.

Calif. Senate Panel Votes To Cite Reliant With Contempt

07/18/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- A California Senate committee Wednesday voted to 
cite Reliant Energy (REI) with contempt because the company has refused to 
provide documents for an investigation into wholesale electricity prices in 
the state, said committee Chairman Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana. 
The committee also voted to forward a contempt charge for Enron Corp (ENE) to 
the full Senate, where it will be voted on. If the charge is approved, the 
Senate will vote on punishment, which could include hefty fines or 
incarceration of executives.
Talks between Enron and committee attorneys Monday seemed to indicate the 
company would agree to committee demands, but since then it has become clear 
the company doesn't plan to comply, Dunn said. 
"If you had asked two days ago I'd have said we are cautiously optimistic 
about Enron. Now I'm pessimistic about it. We felt they were indicating to us 
a willingness to do what the other generators were willing to do, but the 
bottom line is that they are not, despite their cooperative-sounding words. 
We are no closer to them coming into compliance than we were a week ago," 
Dunn said. 

The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation is requesting 
that Reliant and Enron provide 16 kinds of documents related to market 
behavior, rent a depository for the documents, and sign the committee's 
version of a confidentiality agreement. Both generators have refused to meet 
those demands, Dunn said. 
The committee will drop its contempt charges at any time before a full Senate 
vote if either generator agrees to its requests. 
A report detailing Enron's contempt charge will be sent to the full Senate on 
Thursday for introduction, but is expected to be referred to the Senate Rules 
Committee for review before a floor vote. 
Dunn said he didn't know how long the report would be considered in the Rules 
Committee, but he will "certainly push them to do it as soon as possible." 
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said the company "will continue to negotiate" 
with the committee. 
Legislators are scheduled to begin a monthlong break Friday, but aren't 
certain that will happen because they still need to pass a budget bill and 
are trying to approve a bill to rescue Edison International (EIX) unit 
Southern California Edison before leaving. 
Dunn said it would take a few days to prepare a report on Reliant's contempt 
charge. 
"We may not be able to forward that report to the Senate floor until the day 
we get back from recess," Dunn said. 
No one at Reliant could be immediately reached for comment. 
The committee originally was poised to cite seven other electricity 
generators for contempt, but all eventually agreed to provide the requested 
information.

USA: UPDATE 1-Sempra looks to natgas lines to carry optic fiber.

07/18/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

SAN DIEGO, July 18 (Reuters) - A Sempra Energy unit said on Wednesday it has 
developed technology to connect thousands of miles of underused high-speed 
fiber-optic cable to buildings across the U.S. by inserting the cable 
directly into existing natural gas pipelines. 
Sempra said using its utility's gas lines - which hook up to buildings in 
cities throughout central and southern California - could tackle the 
telecommunications industry's "last mile" problem connecting end users to 
outlying fiber-optic cable networks without tearing up city streets.
The surge in demand for high-speed Internet access has led telecommunications 
companies to pour billions of dollars into vast nationwide fiber-optic 
systems that carry data to computers, phones and screens faster than 
traditional copper wires. 
"Demand for broadband service in metropolitan areas is greater than ever," 
said Donald Felsinger, group president of Sempra Energy. 
"The most significant obstacle to meeting that demand is the laying of 
fiber-optic cable under city streets - traditionally a slow, costly and 
disruptive process," he said. 
Sempra Communications' new technology encases fiber-optic cable in a 
protective polyethylene conduit before inserting it through the same 
pipelines that carry gas to utility customers, saving time and leaving 
neighborhood streets intact. 
Sempra said companies that use the technology could see savings up to 30 
percent on last mile costs compared to traditional methods of using older 
technologies and digging up streets, said Jennifer Andrews, a spokeswoman at 
Sempra Fiber Links, a new unit set up to market the technology. 
Andrews said the company had already met with 15 gas utilities and five 
telecommunications companies interested in the technology. 
She said Sempra's Southern California Gas Co (SCG) had already applied to the 
California Public Utilities Commission for approval to use the fiber-optic 
technology in its lines. 
SCG is one of the largest gas distribution companies in the United States, 
serving around 18 million customers in Central and Southern California. 
In a statement, Sempra Communications said installing the cable does not 
inhibit a gas utility from performing any duties necessary to protect public 
safety. 
Andrews said Sempra filed around two months ago for patents on its 
fiber-optic technology with the U.S. Patent Office and Trademark Office and 
the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union. 
Energy companies that have ventured into the fiber-optic business by building 
infrastructure and/or through bandwidth trade, include Williams Cos., El Paso 
Corp.., Enron Corp. ENE.N, Dynegy Inc., Duke Energy, Consolidated Edison Inc. 
and Montana Power Co. 
In March 2000, Montana Power announced plans to divest its energy business 
and invest the proceeds into its broadband and telecommunications unit Touch 
America.

US GAO Demands Cheney Provide Data On Energy Meetings

07/18/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

WASHINGTON (AP)--The investigative arm of Congress demanded Wednesday that 
Vice President Dick Cheney identify all the industry leaders who helped 
formulate the Bush administration's energy policy. Refusal could lead to a 
court fight. 
The White House, which is reviewing the request, said it would work with the 
General Accounting Office to resolve the issue.
The GAO letter follows repeated refusals by the vice president's office to 
provide names and titles of participants who met with the energy task force 
chaired by Cheney. 
Under the law, the GAO could sue if the Bush administration fails to supply 
the data within 20 days. 
This is the first demand letter ever issued by the GAO to a vice president, 
said Democratic Reps. John Dingell and Henry Waxman, who directed the agency 
to review the task force's work nearly three months ago. 
The vice president's lawyer has told the GAO there were nine meetings of the 
task force and that staffers also met with many people to gather information. 
The result was an energy policy, announced May 17, that is aimed at 
increasing the nation's supply of energy. It includes expanded oil and gas 
drilling on public land and a rejuvenated nuclear power system. 
White House spokeswoman Anne Womack said the letter is under review and "we 
will continue to work with the GAO to resolve this issue." 
The vice president's office "has continued on its course of secrecy and 
obstinance," Dingell said in a statement. 
"The White House should simply try telling the truth...and stop hiding 
information that Congress and the public have a right to see," said Waxman. 
The White House's position is that the GAO is entitled to information on the 
task force's costs, but that the congressional watchdog agency doesn't have 
authority to ask for lists of those with whom the task force met. 
Waxman is also pressing for a Justice Department investigation of Karl Rove 
over the Bush political strategist's energy-related meetings. 
The White House has acknowledged that Rove participated in meetings on the 
administration's energy policy while he owned stock in energy companies such 
as Texas-based Enron Corp. The White House has supplied no details on Rove's 
meetings.

Enron's Azurix blocks construction of Argentina-Uruguay gas pipeline - report

07/18/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

LA PLATA, Argentina (AFX) - Enron Corp water and sewage unit Azurix Buenos 
Aires SA has obtained a restraining order against the construction of the 
Cruz del Sur pipeline under the River Plate from Argentina to Uruguay, the 
daily El Dia reported. 
Works were paralyzed BG Group PLC, BP Amoco PLC and Bridas Corp joint venture 
Pan American Energy LLC, BASF AG's Wintershall and Enron Corp and Perez 
Companc SA's Transportadora Gas del Sur venture Gasoducto Cruz del Sur SA 
from Punta Lara in Argentina to Colonia, Uruguay, it said.
"Dredging operations carried out in the coastal area (near the Punta Lara 
potabilization plant), could have caused an alteration in the continuity and 
quality of water service," said Buenos Aires provincial enviromental policy 
department. 
Gasoducto Cruz del Sur has not met the conditions required to complete the 
pipeline, and this "could place the potability of water at risk," court 
sources told El Dia. 
Azurix holds the Buenos Aires provincial water and sewage concession.

Fitch Rts Marlin Water Trust II Sr Secured Notes Due 2003, `BBB'

07/18/2001
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 18, 2001--Fitch has assigned a 'BBB' rating 
to Marlin Water Trust II and the Marlin Water Trust II Co-Issuer's (Marlin 
II) $475 million issuance of 6.31% senior secured notes due 2003, and $515 
million 6.19% senior secured notes due 2003. 
The notes are issued domestically pursuant to SEC Rule 144A and outside the 
U.S. under Regulation S. At closing net proceeds from the issuance will 
temporarily be invested in two short-term Enron Corp. (Enron) notes.
Ultimately the proceeds from the repayment of the Enron notes will be used to 
redeem the outstanding $830 million 7.09% senior secured notes due 2001 of 
Marlin Water Trust (Marlin) and pay interest on the senior notes and yield on 
the Marlin trust certificates. The support for the rating comes from an 
overfund account (pre-funded interest) and equity commitment from Enron in 
the form of mandatorily convertible preferred stock. The overfund account 
will be invested in Enron debt securities (rated 'BBB+', Rating Outlook 
Stable), with payments used to service interest to noteholders. 
Fitch considers the cash flow stream to repay interest representative of a 
'BBB+' credit profile. Payment of principal ultimately relies on Enron's 
obligation to remarket mandatorily convertible preferred securities. Fitch 
currently rates Enron's preferred securities 'BBB-'. 
Enron established Marlin to facilitate off-balance sheet financing of the 
acquisition of Wessex Water Plc (Wessex). Azurix, an indirect wholly owned 
subsidiary of Enron, acquired Wessex in October 1998 for $2.4 billion through 
its direct subsidiary Azurix Europe Limited (AEL). Through a series of 
transactions, Enron contributed its ownership interest in Azurix to Atlantic 
Water Trust (AWT) in exchange for a 50% ownership interest in AWT. At the 
same time, Marlin acquired a 50% ownership interest in AWT with proceeds from 
the original Marlin issuance of senior notes ($1.15 billion) and trust 
certificates ($125 million). AWT applied the Marlin notes and certificates 
proceeds to repay a $900 million acquisition bridge loan and to establish a 
$249 million overfund account invested in Enron senior unsecured debt to pay 
note interest and certificate yield. In addition, Enron contributed to AWT 
its rights under a $125 million loan to AEL (rated `BBB+'). 
Both the AEL note and the Enron debt securities are held at Bristol Water 
Trust (Bristol) for the benefit of Marlin investors. In June 1999, Azurix 
completed an initial public offering of 33% of the company, proceeds of which 
were used to partially redeem the Marlin senior notes. In a shift in strategy 
in March 2001, Enron repurchased the Azurix shares held by the public. The 
Marlin II transaction represents a refinancing of the remaining Marlin senior 
notes. While various sources of repayment for the Marlin II notes are 
available, such as sale or liquidation of the AWT assets, an equity offering, 
or repayment of the AEL note, primary credit support is derived from the 
Enron obligation to remarket mandatorily convertible preferred stock. 
If an amount sufficient to repay the notes has not been deposited with the 
trustee 120 days prior to the maturity date or upon a Note Trigger Event, the 
indenture trustee will direct the share trust to sell the Enron preferred 
stock on terms that are designed to generate an amount sufficient to redeem 
the notes in full. 
In the event that the issuance of the preferred stock yields less than the 
amount required to redeem the senior notes, Enron is required to deliver 
additional shares. If Enron cannot or does not deliver on this obligation, 
then the amount of the deficiency becomes a payment obligation of Enron, 
representing a general unsecured claim. Trigger events include: an event of 
default on the Marlin II notes occurs and notes are accelerated; 120 days 
prior to maturity if the repayment amount of the senior notes has not been 
deposited with the indenture trustee as a result of the sale of Enron equity 
or other equity (which may include the mandatorily convertible preferred 
stock); or, downgrade of Enron's senior unsecured debt below investment grade 
by Fitch, S&P or Moody's in conjunction with a decline in Enron's closing 
stock price to below $34.13 over three consecutive trading days. 
The Marlin transactions provide Enron with an efficient vehicle to monetize 
its investment in Wessex and effectively accelerate the process for capital 
redeployment. Fitch does not expect the success or failure of AWT asset sales 
to materially impact Enron's consolidated credit quality. Currently, Enron's 
obligation under this transaction represents a small portion of Enron's asset 
portfolio. Enron's core operations demonstrate strong competitive market 
positions and provide stable earnings and cash flow contributions. Most 
consolidated credit measures are expected to moderately strengthen in 2001. 
The company's strategy to increase its return on capital employed and become 
more flexible and less asset intensive is reflected in the planned sales of a 
significant portion of its global generation assets.

FYI. In bizarre times, help can sometimes come from bizarre places.  Granted, 
we're likely to disagree strongly with Hogan's continued obsession with 
Poolco, but the discussion in his paper regarding market power may be 
helpful---I've read the Joskow paper, but haven't yet had a chance to review 
the Hogan piece.  

Steve and I discussed the need to do a focused assessment of the Joskow/Kahn 
"analysis"  (remember it's Ed Kahn, not Alfred Kahn).  Seems that it would be 
very useful to fold into that analysis any useful stuff on market power 
included in the paper done by Hogan & Co.  If, in the end, there ain't 
nothing useful, so be it.  But seems like there's little downside to 
exploring it.

Jim, my understanding is that Alan is already working with the fundamentals 
folks on the Portland desk to deconstruct the Joskow paper.  Might want to 
include the Hogan paper in those discussions and might also be useful to pull 
Seabron Adamson into the thinking, too.  Ultimately, may be preferable to 
have any assessment of Joskow and/or Hogan to come from economists, rather 
than directly from us. 

Best,
Jeff

Has FERC Gone Far Enough in California?
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission isn't going far enough in its 
attempt to reform the California wholesale electric market, according to a 
paper by three prominent economists done for San Diego Gas and Electric. The 
paper by John D. Chandley, Scott M. Harvey, and William W. Hogan argues that 
FERC should first end the artificial separation that divides the California 
Power Exchange and the California Independent System Operator, rather than 
worrying about the governance of the two institutions.
"The change in governance may help," says the paper - "Electricity Market 
Reform in California" - "but it is not likely to be decisive in the near 
term. Explicit guidance from the commission regarding the nature and 
trajectory of reforms will be essential if market reform is to be 
accomplished within an acceptable time frame." Hogan, of the Kennedy School 
of Government, has been writing since 1995 in opposition to California's 
market separation.
Also, argues the paper, freeing the California utilities to engage in forward 
contracting is no panacea. "The expectation that merely allowing utilities to 
participate in forward contracting necessarily would be the solution to high 
prices is problematic and not supported by the commission's staff report," 
says the analysis, adding that "putting pressure on buyers to sign contracts 
in the present environment may make things worse." If the underlying problem 
in California is high cost and low capacity, requiring forward contracting 
could harm not only California but also the entire Western U.S. electric 
system.
FERC's $150 so-called "soft cap" is a wild card that has the three economists 
scratching their heads. "It does not appear in the staff report and there is 
little critical analysis of their implications, other than the discussion of 
Commissioner [Curt] Hebert." If the intent of the soft cap is to move toward 
cost justification for bids above $150/MWh, then FERC is headed into an 
administrative morass "that would rival those under wellhead price controls 
in the natural gas industry."
If, on the other hand, the soft cap is "truly soft" and would only require 
some paper work at FERC and the possibility of a refund if the price is 
eventually deemed not just and reasonable, "there might be little impact on 
consumer prices (particularly if the principal sources of those high prices 
are high costs and regional capacity shortages rather than the exercise of 
market power). Even so, the proposal might serve to deter entry and new 
investments, thus combining the worst of both worlds, high consumer prices 
and little or no new investment."
FERC's proposed order in California also demonstrates confusion about just 
what constitutes market power. The paper cites the proposed order's lawyerly, 
obfuscatory conclusion that "while this record does not support findings of 
specific exercises of market power, and while we are not able to reach 
definite conclusions about the actions of individual sellers, there is clear 
evidence that in California market structure and rules provide the 
opportunity for sellers to exercise market power when supply is tight and can 
result in unjust and unreasonable rates under the [Federal Power Act]." The 
economists note, "In this regard, the debate is confused because we are 
dancing around the words where the truth may be hard to face."
In the case of California, say the economists, there is no evidence of market 
power. Even the practice of generators avoiding the day-ahead market in favor 
of the real-time market "is a response to bad market design and pricing 
incentives (including price caps), but does not demonstrate the exercise of 
market power." Nor is bidding above marginal cost necessarily an exercise of 
market power, they add. "The distinction between direct marginal cost and 
opportunity cost is sometimes lost in the discussion. Hence, a competitive 
bidder whose direct cost of generation is $40 but who could sell the same 
energy outside California for $100 should bid no less than $100. This would 
not be an exercise of market power."

 Energy chief moves to avert California blackouts
 Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with U.S. energy secretary ordering power

generators to sell power to California.
 With BC-CA--Power Woes-Glance
 slasmt
 By STEVE LAWRENCE=
 Associated Press Writer=
   SACRAMENTO (AP) _ U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said
Wednesday he would force power generators to sell electricity to
California to prevent rolling blackouts.
   The announcement came as California power regulators warned of
the likelihood of a Stage Three power alert with rotating blackouts
Wednesday afternoon due to trouble buying electricity from the
Northwest.
   About a dozen suppliers were demanding cash before selling power
to California due to concerns about the utilities' solvency, said
Kellan Fluckiger, chief operating officer of the Independent System
Operator, keeper of the state's electrical grid.
   California's two largest utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric and
Southern California Edison, are near bankruptcy due to skyrocketing
wholesale power costs, Gov. Gray Davis and Sen. Dianne Feinstein,
D-Calif., said at a Washington, D.C., news conference with
Richardson.
   Richardson said he was using emergency powers to force
wholesalers to sell power to California at a price he deemed fair.
He said he would also request that two large Pacific Northwest
power generating associations generate more power to send to
California.
   Davis and Feinstein also asked federal regulators to set a
regional price cap on wholesale electricity to prevent the high
prices that have plagued California. On Friday, the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission lifted price caps in California.
   Record wholesale power prices followed, and PG&E warned it was
in financial danger.
   ``The credit limits of utilities and what markets are willing to
sell us have been reached and surpassed in many cases,'' Fluckiger
said. ``There are questions about utility solvency. That has come
to a head today.''
   He said officials may have to interrupt power to about a million
customers Wednesday afternoon and then increase the blackouts to
cover three million or four million in late afternoon and early
evening, when people come home from work and power demand hits a
peak.
   Steve Hansen, a spokesman for Southern California Edison, whose
territory includes metropolitan Los Angeles but not the city, said
the utility had not ordered blackouts by early afternoon.
   ``We have heard that it may not be as bad as we thought here,''
he said. ``We're waiting for some kind of official word from the
ISO or somebody.''
   An unprecedented Stage Three emergency was issued last Thursday,
meaning reserves had fallen below 1 1/2 percent. In that case, the
state fended off the threat of rolling outages by turning off two
power-sucking water pumps on the Delta.
   ``California is heavily import-dependent and had been for 20
years. This is a West-wide problem,'' Fluckiger said.
   Blackouts, if used, would probably last about an hour to 90
minutes and occur mostly in Northern California due to transmission
limitations there, Fluckiger said.
   ``It's a fairly bleak picture,'' he said, adding that the
chances of blackouts were better than 50-50. ``This thing will not
change unless something is done to alleviate the credit
situation.''
   Contributing to the problem was a shortage of water to power
hydroelectric generators in the Northwest and California, Fluckiger
said.
   ``We have reservoirs so low that we have people standing by them
watching the situation to make sure it does not go below safe
limits,'' he said.
   Gas-fired generators could be brought on line to ease the
situation but natural gas prices are so high they would not cover
the operating costs, Fluckiger said.
   ``Requests have been made to operate those facilities and then
have the utilities pay for those excess gas costs,'' Fluckiger
said. ``The utilities have not been able to do so. They have
requested permission from the PUC to be able to pass those costs
through to customers.''
   Utilities would decide who would face blackouts, he said. They
try to avoid areas with essential services such as hospitals,
Fluckiger said.
   California's power market has been hit for months by tight
supplies and price spikes. Electricity deregulation, cold weather
and rising power costs have been blamed for the state's most recent
problems.
   California approved a phased-in deregulation of the electricity
market in 1996 to try to lower prices for consumers through
competition, but so far it has led to higher energy prices.
   The Northwest, heavily dependent on hydroelectric power, has
faced low water tables and had to import electricity from
California and other states.
   And wholesale power costs have been soaring, due in large part
to skyrocketing prices for natural gas. Wall Street is worried
about utilities' economic health, and on Tuesday, a consumer group
urged the state to seize and run the strapped $20 billion
electricity system.
   A Stage One alert was declared Wednesday morning, meaning power
reserves were below 7 percent and all power users are asked to
conserve.
   Stage One and Stage Two emergencies, in which power reserves
fall below 5 percent, have become routine this month, but last
Thursday's Stage Three was the only time the threat of blackouts
loomed.

Enron's Lay on Speculation on Cabinet Post: Comment (Correct)
12/13/0 14:49 (New York)


     (Corrects spelling of Cheney in fifth paragraph.)

     Houston, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg) -- Following are comments from
Enron Corp. Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay on
speculation he may be appointed to George W. Bush's Cabinet. Enron
said today Jeffrey Skilling, the company's president and chief
operating officer, will take over from Lay as chief executive in
February. Lay said he will remain chairman.

On going to Washington:

     ``It's flattering to be rumored about. That's all those are
are rumors. I plan to stay at Enron. I plan to stay in Houston.''

     He said the appointment of his successor coincidently
occurred at around the same time the U.S. Supreme Court issued the
ruling that likely will pave the way for a Bush administration.

     ``I'm a strong supporter of President-elect Bush and Vice
President-elect Cheney, and I hope that we can start to call them
that. They are both good friends, and I have been a very strong
supporter for a very long time. I hope to continue to support them
as much as I can -- from Houston.''

Enron Names Skilling CEO, Says Lay to Remain Chairman (Update5)

     (Adds Rebecca Mark's departure from Enron in ninth to 10th
paragraphs.)

     Houston, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. named as chief
executive officer its President Jeffrey Skilling, who helped make
the Houston-based natural-gas pipeline company into the largest
competitor in the growing energy-trading business.
     Skilling, 47, succeeds Ken Lay as chief executive. Lay, 58,
said he will remain as chairman, a position he has held since
February 1986, and has no plans to serve in the presidential
administration of Texas Governor George W. Bush, as some news
reports suggested.
     Enron's revenue will more than double this year, possibly
topping $90 billion, largely because of Lay's and Skilling's
efforts to exploit deregulation of U.S. natural gas and power
markets, analysts and investors say. Enron has focused on
arranging sales and purchases of energy for large buyers such as
utilities and corporations.
     ``I'm glad to see that Ken Lay had the presence of mind to
allow Jeff, who's really been running the show for a couple of
years anyway, to go ahead and take over,'' said Donato Eassey, a
Merrill Lynch analyst. ``Jeff has worked hard to position this
company to be an energy exploiter in an era of new technology.''
     Skilling joined Enron in 1990 after leading McKinsey & Co.'s
energy and chemical consulting practices. He became Enron's
president and chief operating officer in 1996. He will keep those
posts after becoming chief executive.

                            Stock Soars

     Enron shares fell $1.69 to $75.50 in midafternoon trading.
The stock has doubled in the last 12 months as Enron's energy
trading strategies continued to pay off. The company's earnings
have risen by more than 30 percent in each of the last four
quarters.
     ``The best time for the succession to occur is when the
company is doing well,'' said Lay, who said revenue could top $90
billion this year, up from about $40 billion in 1999. ``Enron is
doing extremely well now.''
     Skilling's biggest competitor for the CEO's spot was Rebecca
Mark, who helped Enron expand outside the U.S. and led the
company's efforts to build a global water company.
     In August, Mark, one of the highest-ranking women in U.S.
business, resigned from Enron's board and quit as chairman and
chief executive of Azurix Corp., a water company formed by Enron
two years ago. Azurix's performance never matched expectations,
and its share price plunged, preventing the company from using its
stock for acquisitions as the company had originally planned.
     Mark and another high-ranking Enron executive, Vice Chairman
Joseph Sutton, focused on buying or building large projects such
as power plants while Skilling moved the company to focus on
trading, a business that requires far fewer assets. Sutton
resigned in October as Skilling's strategy won out.

                            Big Profits

     Record-high natural gas prices and Enron's move to switch its
electricity, gas, oil and commodities trading business onto the
Internet have helped boost earnings and revenue.
     In November 1999, the company opened EnronOnline, an Internet
site where buyers and sellers of commodities can conduct business
with Enron. The site handled $280 billion in transactions in its
first year, and now manages $2.4 billion in trades each day. Enron
sells everything from paper pulp to space on fiber-optic
telecommunications networks on the site.
     Skilling ``has been driving the evolution of this company
from an asset-based pipeline company to something no other company
in the world is,'' said David Fleischer, a managing director of
Goldman, Sachs & Co., which has put Enron on its list of top 30
stocks. ``It's a company that is now growing on its intellectual
capital and providing products and services to energy companies.''

Venezuela's PDVSA Plans $600 Mln Natural Gas Plant (Update1)
12/13/0 14:18 (New York)

Venezuela's PDVSA Plans $600 Mln Natural Gas Plant (Update1)

     (Updates from seventh paragraph.)

     Caracas, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg) -- State oil company Petroleos
de Venezuela SA said it plans to build a $600 million natural gas
complex in the western part of the country, replacing several
outdated facilities.
     Construction of the plant, which would produce liquid natural
gas, is expected to start in mid-2001, with production slated for
2004, said PDVSA officials. The plant would be located in the
western state of Zulia.
     ``We haven't decided whether to finance the project alone or
through a joint venture,'' said Nelson Nava, director of
development for PDVSA Gas, the company's natural gas unit. ``We
will work out the program during the first quarter of 2001.''
     PDVSA is betting that natural gas prices will remain high,
ensuring a ready market for liquid natural gas and ethane. PDVSA,
whose sole shareholder is the government, is planning to build a
similar plant in the eastern part of the country as well.
     ``We've already started engineering work on the project,''
said PDVSA Vice President Domingo Marsicobetre.
     Venezuela, with about 147 trillion cubic feet in reserves, is
counting on private companies to help develop its reserves and
boost natural gas exports.
     Meanwhile, talks are continuing with Enron Corp. about a
proposed $556 million natural gas liquefaction plant to be built
in eastern Venezuela, said Nava.
     Under the existing proposal, PDVSA could take up to 25
percent stake in the plant. Negotiations between the two sides
have been continuing for about a year.
     ``We're still in talks with Enron,'' but delays have arisen
due to the government's tardiness in coming up with a pricing
policy for natural gas exports, said Nava.
     An agreement is now expected in the first quarter, he said.
     The plant would produce 2 million metric tons a year of
liquefied natural gas by 2004. The plant, planned for Jose in the
eastern state of Anzoategui, is slated to export LNG to the U.S.
     Venezuela hopes to triple natural gas production and double
proven reserves, already the world's seventh largest, in the
coming years as demand for the commodity surges.

Enron Names Skilling CEO, Says Lay to Remain Chairman (Update3)

     (Updates share price in last paragraph.)

     Houston, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the world's
largest energy trader, named President and Chief Operating Officer
Jeffrey Skilling as chief executive, succeeding Kenneth Lay, who
will remain chairman.
     Lay, 58, has been chairman and CEO since February 1986. The
management changes will be effective Feb. 12.
     Lay backed Texas Governor George W. Bush's campaign for
president, and was mentioned in the Houston Chronicle and in other
news media as a possible appointee to Bush's Cabinet. Lay and
Skilling both said today that Lay won't be joining the new
administration.
    ``I am particularly happy that Ken and I will continue running
the company together, and that he has put the rumors of his
possible departure to Washington, D.C., to rest,'' Skilling said.
     Enron's stock has doubled in the last 12 months as Lay and
Skilling's energy trading strategies continued to pay off. The
company, which had 1999 revenue of $40 billion, could top $90
billion this year, Lay said.
     ``The best time for the succession to occur is when the
company is doing well,'' Lay said in an interview. ``Enron is
doing extremely well now.''
     The company's revenue has surged, in part because of record-
high natural gas prices and Enron's moving its electricity, gas,
oil and commodities trading business onto the Internet.
     In November of last year, the company opened EnronOnline, an
Internet site where buyers and sellers of commodities can conduct
business with Enron.
     The site handled $280 billion in transactions in its first
year, and now manages $2.4 billion in trades each day. Enron sells
everything from paper pulp to space on fiber-optic
telecommunications networks on the site.
     Lay transformed Houston-based Enron, once just a gas pipeline
company, into an international power-plant and energy-project
developer, and the leader in the growing business of arranging
sales of electricity and other types of energy between large
consumers.
     Skilling, 47, joined Enron in 1990 after leading McKinsey &
Co.'s energy and chemical consulting practices. He became Enron's
president and chief operating officer in 1996.
     Shares of Enron fell 81 cents to $76.38 in late morning
trading.

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- Dabhol Power Co. Wednesday appealed to the Supreme 
Court to challenge the jurisdiction of Maharashtra State Electricity 
Regulatory Commission, reports the Business Standard. 
Dabhol, the Indian unit of U.S. energy major Enron Corp. (ENE), is 
challenging the Commission's decisions on Dabhol's disputes with its sole 
buyer the Maharashtra State Electricity Board.
The newspaper report quoted a Dabhol spokesman as saying the issue will come 
up for a hearing in several days. 
Dabhol's global lenders have also decided to appeal to the Supreme Court 
within a week over the same issue, the report added. 
Dabhol is the single largest foreign investment in India, worth $2.9 billion. 
Its power plant in the western Indian state of Maharashtra has a capacity to 
generate 740 megawatts. The plant has stopped operations since May 29 after 
MSEB stopped drawing power from Dabhol saying its tariffs were 
"unaffordable."

Looking for an S&P revival: Elliott & Page manager focuses on earnings growth
Sonita Horvitch
Financial Post

07/19/2001
National Post 
National
D03
(c) National Post 2001. All Rights Reserved. 

Toronto-based Mark Schmeer, managing director of equities at money manager 
Elliott & Page, says the Standard & Poor's 500 index could generate a 
double-digit total return over the next 12 months as the U.S. economy grows 
about 2% to 3%. 
If this forecast is correct -- "by various measures the U.S. economy has 
bottomed" -- then this augurs well for growth stocks such as those in the 
technology sector, he says. "Growth stocks do well in a climate of 
accelerating economic growth and a rising stock market." This suggests, he 
says, that investors should consider revisiting the battered tech sector, 
"but not indiscriminately."
While he is bullish on the outlook for the equity market over the next 12 
months, Schmeer warns that there will continue to be volatility. 
Schmeer and his team have assembled a comprehensive corporate data base that 
is updated regularly. 
In stock selection, the Elliott & Page team uses both traditional fundamental 
analysis and proprietary models. These rank companies on their earnings 
growth momentum and their ability to generate positive earnings surprises and 
upwards earnings revisions by financial analysts. 
For the column, Schmeer is selecting stocks from a number of sectors. His 
tech pick: 
- BEA Systems Inc. (BEAS/NASDAQ), which closed recently at US$24.52 and 
trades in a 52-week range of US$89.50 to US$20.19. 
The stock is substantially off its 52-week high and has declined more than 
the average tech stock, he notes, yet the company continues to deliver on 
earnings. BEA is provides application and Web application servers for 
electronic commerce. Major products include BEA WebLogic, a software platform 
for e-commerce applications. 
Unlike many other tech companies, BEA has been keeping up its earnings growth 
rate and reporting earnings in line with expectations and should continue to 
do so, Schmeer says. Earnings per share estimates are US42 cents for the 
fiscal year to January, 2002, and US64 cents for the fiscal year to January, 
2003. This makes for an earnings growth rate of around 50%. The stock trades 
at a multiple of close to 60 times forward earnings. 
A specialist stock in the energy sector he likes is: 
- Enron Corp. (ENE/NYSE) US$49.85 (US$90.56- US$42.35). Based in Houston, 
this company is a leader in the field of energy wholesaling. It procures 
energy and sells to major U.S. corporations such as Eli Lilly and Quaker Oats 
under long-term agreements. 
Enron has expanded into the electricity market as deregulation created price 
uncertainty for users, says Schmeer. The company has produced six consecutive 
quarters of positive earnings surprises and analysts have been revising their 
earnings estimates upward, he notes. 
Earnings per share estimates are US$1.86 for 2001 and US$2.25 for 2002. The 
stock trades at a P/E multiple close to this earnings growth outlook, which 
is desirable as many stocks in the S&P 500 index are trading well above their 
prospective growth rates, says Schmeer. 
He is generally cautious about energy producers and traditional energy 
services companies such as drillers. 
"Historically, these stocks mainly outperform when the market is going down 
and they are less likely to beat the market in a climate of economic 
acceleration." 
He has sold major U.S. energy services company, Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB/NYSE) 
US$49.85 (US$88.87-US$48.05). Its earnings growth rate has been rapidly 
declining and the company may not meet consensus estimates for the third and 
fourth quarter this year, he says. 
Schmeer's picks in the consumer products sector include: 
- Johnson & Johnson (JNJ/NYSE) US$54.91 (US$54.98- US$40.25). This health 
care products company has been reporting positive earnings surprises, he 
notes. "This is not a cheap stock, but you are paying for the consistency in 
earnings growth; the company should continue to deliver on its earnings." 
J and J recently purchased ALZA Corp., a drug delivery company based in 
California, for US$10.5-billion in stock, which might lead to a modest EPS 
dilution for 2001 of an estimated US10 cents per share, while 2002 should not 
be affected, he says. Earnings per share estimates are US$1.94 for 2001 and 
US$2.20 for 2002. The stock trades at roughly two times its estimated 
earnings growth rate. 
Finally, this manager is choosing a rapidly expanding savings and loan 
company, Washington Mutual Inc. (WM/NYSE) US$41.38 (US$41.60-US$19.83). 
Based in Seattle, this company has expanded from the Pacific Northwest across 
the United States, mainly via acquisitions. 
It recently purchased Dime Bancorp, the holding company for Dime Savings Bank 
of New York. 
The company has been able to exceed analysts estimates over the past three 
quarters and should continue to do so. Earnings are being revised upwards. 
Washington Mutual is able to grow EPS at a rate of about 11% per year over 
the long haul. The stock trades at a P/E multiple of about 11, which is 
cheaper than its peers, Schmeer says.

ASIA-PACIFIC - Enron writ highlights India contract concerns.
By JULIE EARLE.

07/19/2001
Financial Times 
(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved 

Enron's Indian arm, the Dabhol Power Company (DPC), yesterday issued a writ 
in the Bombay Supreme Court in a move highlighting concerns over the validity 
of contracts for foreign companies operating in India. 
Enron, the US energy giant that owns 65 per cent of DPC, is locked in a 
bitter dispute with its sole Indian client, the Maharashtra State Electricity 
Board (MSEB) over $45m in unpaid bills.
The writ issued yesterday challenges the jurisdiction of Maharashtra's 
electricity industry regulator, the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory 
Commission.Enron is appealing a high court decision to allow the regulator to 
determine jurisdiction over issues in the power purchase agreement between 
DPC and MSEB. 
In June, the regulator issued an interim order that stopped DPC from pursuing 
arbitration proceedings in London, as provided for under the purchase power 
agreement. 
A senior official at Enron yesterday said the company believed that a 
regulatory body created after the agreement with the electricity board 
"should not be in a position of potentially disrupting a contract through 
regulatory mechanisms". 
The electricity board had asked the regulator to intervene. Enron said in May 
it would pull out of the project. 
The board, which says Enron's tariffs are too expensive, has since late May 
refused to draw power from the plant and rescinded its power-purchasing 
contract - a move Enron says is invalid. 
Enron insists that the tariff, which is about three times higher than that 
levied by Indian power producers, is due to high capital and fuel costs 
incurred since the contract was signed in 1995.

The State Aides Told to Sell Stock Ethics: Consultants hired for power crisis 
must dispose of shares in generating firms.

SACRAMENTO -- Facing criticism over possible conflicts of interest, Davis 
administration officials on Wednesday ordered consultants steering California 
through the energy crisis to sell off stock they own in power firms--or lose 
their jobs. 
A top legal aide to Gov. Gray Davis said private consultants who were hanging 
on to power company stock had failed to uphold the state's highest ethical 
standards.
Nine consultants under contract with the state have reported holding stock in 
power companies, including Calpine and Enron, that have reaped huge profits 
during California's energy crunch. 
Political foes of the governor, most notably Secretary of State Bill Jones, 
have raised questions in recent weeks about potential conflicts involving the 
consultants, who helped buy power and negotiate long-term contracts that 
critics say will saddle consumers with artificially high electricity costs 
for years to come. 
The administration's tough stance Thursday with the consultants punctuates a 
startling change of tactics. 
For months, Davis' aides had not required the consultants to file financial 
disclosure forms to report their personal stock holdings. By law, the 
disclosure documents must be filed within 30 days of going on the state 
payroll. The reports were filed after Jones began putting pressure on the 
governor last week. 
Barry Goode, the governor's legal affairs secretary, dispatched a letter 
early Wednesday demanding that the consultants sell the stock by noon that 
day or face termination of their state contracts. 
"It is imperative that you give this instruction, immediately, to each of the 
consultants," Goode said in his letter to the state Department of Water 
Resources, which has taken over from California's beleaguered private 
utilities the job of buying power. 
"We expect, and have always expected, the state's consultants to uphold the 
highest ethical standards," Goode wrote. "That standard is not met by those 
who hold a financial interest in one or more energy companies while trading 
on behalf of the state on energy related matters." 
Goode's admonishment was conveyed by Tom Hannigan, water resources director, 
to 34 consultants who are on contract with the department, among them the 
nine contract employees who reported holding shares in generating firms. 
Steve Maviglio, the governor's spokesman, said all the consultants holding 
stock had agreed to sell it by the noon deadline. 
But the stock sales did not satisfy Jones, who plans to challenge Davis in 
next year's election. 
He characterized the administration's action Wednesday as "way too little and 
too late." 
Although the energy crisis and the hiring of numerous consultants on short 
notice represents an unusual situation, the governor's staff should have been 
aware of the conflict-of-interest issue, said Bob Stern, president of the 
Center for Government Studies in Los Angeles and an author of the state's 
Political Reform Act. 
"Somebody," he said, "was asleep at the switch in the governor's office." 
"We are talking here about major amounts of money," Stern said. "You don't 
get involved with decisions that affect your financial interest." 
Of the consultants who filed disclosure reports last week, six reported that 
they own stock in Calpine Corp. One reported holding stock in Enron Corp. One 
of those seven resigned her state consultant's job a few days ago. 
The latest conflict-of-interest statements, filed earlier this week, reveal 
that three other consultants own energy company stock. 
Mark Skowronski, who works for the Electric Power group, owned $10,000 to 
$100,000 in stock in power producer Reliant Energy Inc. when he went to work 
for the state. 
In a note attached to his disclosure form, Skowronski said he sold his shares 
in Reliant on March 20 after he was given the assignment as the lead state 
negotiator with the company. He continues to own four blocks of Edison stock, 
each valued at $10,000 to $100,000, which he bought in January and February. 
"I have had no dealings with Edison and have not had a conflict of interest," 
Skowronski said in his attached note. 
Ronald O. Nichols, another consultant, reported that in April that he bought 
$10,000 to $100,000 worth of stock in Enron and General Electric. 
In a statement filed Monday, consultant Sumner W. White reported that he owns 
$2,000 to $10,000 in stock in TXU Corp., a Dallas-based energy holding 
company. 
White also reported that he had income of $10,000 to $100,000 as a 
part-owner, executive vice president and director of SRW Group, a Texas 
independent power developer.

Enel Narrows the Field 
To 3 Bidders for Elettrogen
ROME -- Italian utility Enel SpA said that after a first round of offers 
there were three groups left in the race for its electricity-generating 
company Elettrogen, which experts say is valued at least 5.5 trillion lire 
(2.84 billion euros). 
The bidders left in the contest are Edison-Sondel, units of agro-energy 
conglomerate Montedison SpA; Italpower, a consortium of Swiss-based ATEL AG, 
the municipal utilities of Milan, Turin and Rome, steel group Carlo Tassara 
SpA and Banca di Roma SpA; and a consortium led by Spain's Endesa SA that 
includes Asm Brescia and Spanish bank Banco Santander Central Hispano SA. 
Sinergia, a consortium including Austria's Oesterreichische 
Elektrizitaetswirtschafts AG Verbundgesellschaft, Italian holding company CIR 
and U.S. company Mirant Corp., was excluded from the race. 
"On the basis of the offers received (Wednesday), Enel has selected the three 
potential buyers who have put forward the highest bids," Enel said, adding 
that the next round of offers is expected Friday. 
Enel didn't say how much the bids were, but Italian news agency ANSA said 
people close to the deal said the highest price offered Wednesday was equal 
to 5.044 trillion lire. Enel wouldn't comment on the numbers. 
People close to the deal said the next round of bids would start from the 
highest price offered Wednesday plus an extra 15 million euros. (Dow Jones)

Exxon Is Interested in Dolphin 
DUBAI -- Exxon Mobil Corp. is interested in participating in the $4 billion 
(4.66 billion euro) Dolphin Gas project, a plan between the UAE Offsets Group 
and Qatar Petroleum to transport natural gas from Qatar to Abu Dhabi and 
Dubai, the official Emirates News Agency, or WAM, reported. An Exxon Mobil 
official and the United Arab Emirates' foreign minister discussed the issue 
Wednesday, WAM said. The Dolphin project aims to transport two billion cubic 
feet a day of natural gas from Qatar's offshore North Field to the U.A.E. In 
May, Enron Corp. sold its 24.5% stake in Dolphin back to Offsets, freeing up 
its share for another potential strategic partner. TotalFinaElf SA is 
Offsets' other strategic partner, holding a 24.5% stake in the project. (Dow

Nokia to Supply Omnitel 
HELSINKI -- Nokia Corp., the world's largest cellphone maker, will provide 
network equipment for Italian operator Omnitel Vodafone in a contract valued 
at 150 million euros, the company said. The three-year deal includes 
delivering third-generation mobile-phone network infrastructure equipment and 
services, Nokia said. Deliveries will begin immediately and services will be 
launched for commercial use during the second half of 2002. As part of the 
agreement, Nokia and Omnitel plan to establish a center in Milan to develop 
3G applications and a technology testing center. Omnitel Vodafone is a 
wireless operator with more than 16 million customers. Omnitel became part of 
the Vodafone group last year. (AP)

KPNQwest Has Collection Woes 
AMSTERDAM -- KPNQwest NV confirmed Wednesday that a second client may be 
having payment problems. Canada's 360networks isn't likely to be paying the 
full amount of a 160 million euro order for fiber from KPNQwest in Europe, or 
even very much of it, because the company recently filed for protection from 
creditors in Canada and for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the U.S. 
"We're not holding our breath (on receiving more money from 360networks); 
let's put it that way," said KPNQwest's head of investor relations, Jerry 
Yohananov. 360networks couldn't immediately be reached for comment. (Dow

Accounting Office Demands Energy Task Force Records
By JEFF GERTH

07/19/2001
The New York Times 
Page 20, Column 1
c. 2001 New York Times Company 

WASHINGTON, July 18 -- After two months of unsuccessful requests, the General 
Accounting Office demanded today that Vice President Dick Cheney turn over 
records relating to how his energy task force developed its policies. 
The demand letter, by the Congressional auditing office acting at the request 
of two ranking Democratic House members, increases the possibility of a legal 
and constitutional clash between Congress and the Bush administration.
A White House spokeswoman, Anne Womack, said the letter was ''under review, 
and we're going to continue to work with the G.A.O. to try and resolve this 
issue appropriately.'' 
Last month Mr. Cheney's counsel told the office that it lacked jurisdiction 
over the task force because the panel acted only as an adviser to the 
president, a function protected by the Constitution. 
The White House has 20 days to respond to the letter. The accounting office 
could then go to federal court to try to enforce the demand letter, one of 32 
issued by the G.A.O. since 1980 to various federal departments. This is the 
first time a demand letter has been sent to a vice president, accounting 
office officials said. 
The letter seeks information about people with whom Mr. Cheney and other task 
force members met while developing the group's policies, but not information 
about ''the deliberative process.'' Mr. Cheney has said that the task force's 
report in May, which contained more than 100 recommendations involving energy 
production, infrastructure, conservation and the environment, was based on 
sound public policy considerations. 
In an interview tonight on ''The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer,'' broadcast on 
PBS, Mr. Cheney said the task force realized at the outset that it had to 
have an ''adequate concern for the environment in this report, or we're not 
going to have a credible report.'' 
But some Democrats and other critics say energy industry executives and their 
lobbyists had too much influence over Mr. Cheney's plan, while environmental 
and consumer groups were ignored or treated perfunctorily. And the vice 
president's refusal to release the names of people who contacted the task 
force led two of his chief critics, Representatives Henry A. Waxman of 
California and John D. Dingell of Michigan, both Democrats, to bring in the 
accounting office for a closer look. 
Mr. Cheney has acknowledged meeting with energy executives, including Kenneth 
L. Lay, the chairman of the Enron Corporation, but denies that they exercised 
any undue influence on the deliberations. 
''The idea that somehow only the energy industry has access just simply isn't 
true,'' Mr. Cheney said in an interview last spring. ''We'll make decisions 
on what we think makes sound public policy.'' 
Juleanna Glover Weiss, Mr. Cheney's spokeswoman, declined to discuss any 
specific meetings involving the task force or the vice president. 
''We don't release the vice president's schedule,'' Ms. Weiss said. 
More broadly, however, she said Mr. Cheney's task force -- the National 
Energy Policy Development Group, composed of cabinet officers and other 
government officials -- met with many elected officials, organizations and 
outside interests. The group's report was released on May 17, and many of its 
recommendations require further action by Congress and government agencies. 
Mr. Cheney's counselor, Mary Matalin, said Democrats should now look to the 
aftermath of the report instead of the group's deliberations. 
''If they want to know what happened in the meetings, look at what it spawned 
in legislation that is on the Hill,'' Ms. Matalin said. 
And since the report's release, Mr. Cheney has met with some 
environmentalists, his spokeswoman said. 
Some environmental groups said today that this was too little and too late. 
''Industry has had direct access to key decision makers while representatives 
of the public interest and environmental communities are left to the 
sidelines,'' said Alyssondra Campaigne, the legislative director for the 
Natural Resources Defense Council, which has been unsuccessful in seeking 
task force records under the Freedom of Information Act. 
The accounting office's letter demands five sets of records: names and 
attendees at meetings of the energy group; information about the group's six 
professional staff members; details of meetings between the staff and others, 
including lobbyists; details of Mr. Cheney's meetings with others and cost 
accounting records for the group, for which Mr. Cheney's office has already 
turned over 77 pages. 
The accounting office claims broad authority to examine government programs 
under the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921. 
The request by Mr. Waxman and Mr. Dingell led the G.A.O. to approach Mr. 
Cheney's office first on May 8. Mr. Cheney's counsel, David S. Addington, 
later questioned the appropriateness of the request and sent a letter 
challenging the accounting office's legal authority. 
Mr. Addington's letter of June 7 suggested a constitutional privilege. It 
said the policy group was acting in a constitutional capacity as adviser to 
the president so it was not a government program subject to Congressional 
oversight. The group's senior staff members are actually paid through the 
Department of Energy, White House officials said. 
Last week, lawyers from the White House and the Justice Department discussed 
the request with officials from the accounting office, but the matter 
remained unresolved. 
Today's demand letter, signed by Anthony Gamboa, the agency's general 
counsel, is a formal enforcement mechanism. While it may resemble a subpoena 
in some respects, agency officials said it had a unique standing by statute 
that ultimately resided in federal court. 
The accounting office infrequently uses demand letters. 
''We worked very hard not to get to this point,'' said Bob Robinson, managing 
director for natural resources and environment at the office. 
Mr. Robinson said other parts of the executive branch involved in the task 
force, including the Departments of Interior and Energy and the Environmental 
Protection Agency, had begun providing information, though only at the last 
minute.

     Washington, July 19 (Bloomberg) -- California Governor Gray
Davis's administration ordered consultants handling the management

companies, the Los Angeles Times reported.
     Political foes of the governor, including Secretary of State
Bill Jones, raised questions about potential conflicts of interest
