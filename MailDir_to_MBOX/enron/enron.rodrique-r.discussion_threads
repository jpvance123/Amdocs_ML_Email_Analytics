Gas prices are so high that when I pulled into a station this morning and
asked for a dollar's worth, the attendant dabbed some behind my ears.

Please find the attached EES Volumetric NYMEX and Basis positions for 
7/31/2000.   I expect our position to be about 300 contracts shorter on Nymex.



Thanks,

Dawn,

I can't believe it...I just saw Phillip Allen laugh!!!  Like laugh out loud!  
Shocking isn't it?  I don't know what caused this phenomenon but I thought 
you'd like to know about it.

I just wanted to let you know that the INTRA-TEXAS-GDL booked pulled in a 
July fixed price gas daily position last night.  Maybe you could apply the 
same logic that is used to pull this position to the Gas Daily books that are 
not currently pulling in the fixed price gas daily positions.  The books that 
had fixed price position for 6/26 that did not pull in are listed below.  

BOOK ID  POST ID  JULY FIXED PRICE POSITION(in contracts)

GD-MARKET-GDL 819207   92.9

GD-CENTRAL-GDL 819212   263.3

GD-TEXAS-GDL 819657   (15.5)

If there is any more information that will help you develop the correct logic 
please let me know.

Thanks,
Robin

Kathy,

Here is the detail and position for IM Canada yesterday.  It seems that the 
price txt file didn't get run last night (our fault).   I'll make sure that 
gets done tonight.

Let me know if you need anything else.

 Virendra,

Let me know when you are available to discuss the Gas Daily GRMS logic.  It 
is my understanding that GRMS currently will only include those gas daily 
deals that are intramonth deals with an effective date greater than the 
current date.  However, we should also include any deals in out months that 
are fixed price gas daily deals.  

Thanks,
Robin

Guten Morgen!!!  I've decided to learn German since I'm not having any luck 
with Spanish.  Oh my goodness....some "lady" just walked by with her pajamas 
on I think.  And apparently they were her pajamas from when she was in high 
school b/c not only are they hideously ugly they don't fit anymore!!  It's 
really scary.  

Someone just called with work for me to do, so I'll talk to ya later.

I'm going to lunch with Shannon and Becky today if you want to come.  And yes 
you are really invited.  So let me know if you want to come and please be 
specific!!

Vern,

I am now responsible for publishing the EES Gas Position Report.   It seems 
that the websave version that I received in the attached email is not updated 
to publish the EES report.  Could you please send me an updated version or 
let me know what I need to do so that I can publish this report?

Thank you,

Subject: Executive Reports Add-In

Attached is the latest version of the Add-In for publishing Executive 
Reports.  It contains the "Pulp & Paper P&L", "Pulp & Paper Position", "Pulp 
& Paper Price", "Emissions Summary", and "Natural Gas Net Fixed Price 
Positions By Book (Ignores Correlation)" subroutines.

John Lavorato is expecting to see these publish reports in the updated viewer 
tomorrow morning!

To use this latest version of the Add-In:

Close all instances of Excel.
Detach the attached websave2.xla file into the Microsoft Office's Library 
directory.  Usually this is C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Library
Launch Excel.
Under the Tools menu selection, select Add-Ins...
In the "Add-Ins available" list, look for "Websave."  If present, uncheck 
it.  This is the old version of the add-in.
There should be a "Websave2" in the list.  This is the current version of the 
add-in.  Check it and click the OK button.

I've also attached a workbook containing a buttons for the new reports that 
you can copy and paste into your production workbooks.  



Here are the named range values and the sheet names for the reports:

Named Range	Sheet Name
nr_NGFixPB  	Natural Gas Net Fixed
nr_EmSum  	Emissions Summary
nr_PPPL  	Pulp & Paper P&L
nr_PPPos  	Pulp & Paper Position
nr_PPPrice  	Pulp & Paper Price

Hi Robin,

Here is the IM Positions TXT for the 17th. The deal ID column looks to be 
different than the one's I was sending before last week. Should these be 
numbered 1,2,3... as before? Please advise. I'll be calling soon to let you 
know we are official, so if there is anything wrong with the file you can let 
me know.
Talk to you soon,
 Brian

Robin,

I have set it up for this spreadsheet and I already ran it in stage 
database.  The only error message I got was 'OPT_CLASS_CD INVALID'.  
Option_class_cd should be one of the following: 'AMR', 'ASI', 'ASM', and 
'EUR'.  'USD' in the spreadsheet is more like a currency_cd.

Please find the attached EES Volumetric NYMEX and Basis positions for 
8/7/2000.   I expect our position to be about 498 contracts long on Nymex and 
<1,338> nominal Basis contracts.  In addition, there are 40 contracts long 
for the Mercury portfolio which is not yet included in the Benchmark report.  
You may contact me at x3-5070 if you have any questions.

Robin,

Actually, the relocation department will give you the option to receive the 
funds by credit card, check, or wire. You will not have to submit an expense 
report.

Thanks,

Ivonne,

Thanks for the information.  Will I receive the $3,500 automatically on my 
paycheck, or do I need to submit an expense report to be reimbursed for any 
expenses I incur?  If I do need to submit an expense report, who should I 
turn it in to?

Thanks,
Robin

Robin,
I took a look at the intra-cand-west-phy calc and there is nothing about the 
calc that is different from yesterday (which Kam set up).

I took a look at the detail but it is very difficult to use because if does 
not tie into the summary page at all.  I did note the following things though:
You are not pulling in our CGPR-Aeco/Basis Positions into the summary (a 
quick look at Aug/Sept/of Oct will show this)
July will NEVER tie out until systems is able to roll off 1/30th of the MI 
positions daily.  This applies to physical, gas daily and Financial.

Please continue to use the positions we send you until we are able to tie

Kathy

Hey Guys,

We are still not pulling the Intra-Cand-West-Phy book into the benchmark.  I 
have talked to the systems administrator and he thinks it might be in how the 
book is set up in the system.  I have attached below a copy of the screen 
that shows how we have desigated the various codes for this book.  Please 
look at this and verify that we have it set up properly.  If you have any 
questions feel free to give me a call.

I am also attaching the detail that I pulled out of the GRMS system.  Please 
take a look at it and help me identify what is causing our variances.  For 
instance I am pulling a position of (245) contracts for July Price and you 
show a position of long 241 contracts.  




Thanks,
Robin

You guys should submit an eRequest to get access to all the Gas Reports on 
the Executive Viewer.  Here's a list of the reports you'll want.

Origination Schedule
Natural Gas Prices
Natural Gas Basis Positions
Natural Gas Profit & Loss by Book
Natural Gas Net Fixed Price Positions by Book
Natural Gas Basis by Trader

Also, Brad you need to request access to the O:/Bench directory so that 
you'll be able to save a copy of the NGPL in this directory each night.  

Bilal, you'll need access to the O:/Gas_Trad and O:/Bench directories.

Gary/Susan,

The INTRA-CNT-TRANS problem was on my end.  It wasn't defined properly in the 
bench.  

Thanks,

Please find the attached EES Volumetric NYMEX and Basis positions for 
8/10/2000.   I expect our position to be about 220 contracts long on Nymex 
and <1,758> nominal Basis contracts.  In addition, there are 40 contracts 
long for the Mercury portfolio which is not yet included in the Benchmark 
report.  You may contact me at x3-5070 if you have any questions.




Thanks,

Monica Hwang

Debbie,

Thank you for returning my call.  I went to the eRequest to submit a request 
for Risktrac but the only option was to get access to the application.  I 
already have the application I merely need access to the VAR module.  
Therefore, I did not submit an eRequest.  Please let me know what I need to 
submit to ensure I get the proper access.

Thank you,
Robin

Robin,

If you were to accept a rotation in Chicago your cost-of-living adjustment 
would be 20%.  In addition, we would also facilitate your relocation from 
Houston to Chicago.  You would be eligible to receive $1,500 relocation 
allowance to cover expenses outside of the household move.  (i.e. house 
hunting trip, meals, etc...)  You also have the option to have the company 
move your household goods.  (We will provide a professional carrier to pack 
and move your goods) or you can opt to do a self move and receive another 
$1,500.  (This amount is before tax.)  Please let me know if you have any 
questions.

  page. To enable your course services, simply enter your
  username and password in the appropriate fields on the page.
  For your records, here are the username and password you

  dorm, it's a very good idea to log out when you finish your
  work on the website. All you have to do is click on the "Log
  Out" link that appears on every page after you log in.

  TAKING TESTS & DRILLS ONLINE
  -----------------------------
  Students taking GMAT, GRE, and USMLE courses will take all of
  their computerized diagnostic tests on the web. Offering
  tests online makes it possible to always ensure that you have
  the most  up-to-date questions available that reflect the
  current make up of the test. It also makes it possible to
  provide detailed analysis of your performance to your
  instructors.

  SAT students can find a plethora [if you don't know this word,
  look it up now!] of drills which target certain problem types.
  If you want to find an extra set of medium geometry questions
  or hard average problems, check out the online drills! You can
  also check out our multimedia versions of the same techniques
  you've been learning in class, to help you remember what you've
  learned.

  GRE and GMAT students, please hold off on taking any online tests
  or drills until your course starts.  Your Princeton Review
  instructor will assign each of the online tests and drills during
  specific points during the program.

  USMLE students, please take Test 1 online prior to attending your
  first class.  Your Princeton Review instructor will assign each of
  the remaining online tests and drills during specific points during
  the program.

  LSAT students, although you will be taking your course practice tests
  in a proctored environment (the LSAT is still a pencil-and-paper test,
  after all) the website does contain detailed explanations for every
"real"
  LSAT problem you will be doing in the course.  Further, if you
supplement
  your course materials with additional real LSATs, you will find online
  explanations for these questions as well.

  TECHNICAL SUPPORT
  ------------------
  Tech support is available at no charge to all Princeton Review
  course students Monday through Friday from 10am until 11pm
  Eastern and Saturday from 12pm to 6pm Eastern. You can reach
  tech support by either phone or email:

       Tech Support Email: websupport@review.com
       Tech Support Phone Number: 1-800-546-2102

  Once again, thanks for choosing The Princeton Review. You are
  well on the way to higher scores!

  Regards,
  The Folks at Princeton Review Online

I just have a question for item 2)  Some of the deals are multimonth deals.  
How can I have a uniquie master deal id for each line if there is only one 
TAGG number for all of the months and I need to break out each month 
separately.

Kathy,

I spoke with the system administrators today and they gave me several more 
guidelines for the text files.  

1) The Book ID must be an existing book (Please use the same book id every 
day).  Also please Sort the Book Id by risk type (ie IMCan-Erms-xl-GDL, then 
IMCAN-ERMS-XL-PHY, then IMCAN-ERMS-XL-PRC.)

2) The Master Deal Id must be a unique number per line.

3) The reference date must be in the following format D-MMM-YY.

4) MTM Value Amount must be a NUMBER.  If there is no position please use a 
zero.  

5) The GROSS POSITION and DELTA POSITION must be a value.  No commas, no 
dashes, no links, and no #REF errors.  Again if there is no position please 
use a zero.  

The guidelines apply to all text files that must be loaded into GRMS.  If you 
have any question, please give me a call.

Thanks,
Robin

Subject: Executive Reports Add-In

Attached is the latest version of the Add-In for publishing Executive 
Reports.  It contains the "Pulp & Paper P&L", "Pulp & Paper Position", "Pulp 
& Paper Price", "Emissions Summary", and "Natural Gas Net Fixed Price 
Positions By Book (Ignores Correlation)" subroutines.

John Lavorato is expecting to see these publish reports in the updated viewer 
tomorrow morning!

To use this latest version of the Add-In:

Close all instances of Excel.
Detach the attached websave2.xla file into the Microsoft Office's Library 
directory.  Usually this is C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Library
Launch Excel.
Under the Tools menu selection, select Add-Ins...
In the "Add-Ins available" list, look for "Websave."  If present, uncheck 
it.  This is the old version of the add-in.
There should be a "Websave2" in the list.  This is the current version of the 
add-in.  Check it and click the OK button.

I've also attached a workbook containing a buttons for the new reports that 
you can copy and paste into your production workbooks.  



Here are the named range values and the sheet names for the reports:

Named Range	Sheet Name
nr_NGFixPB  	Natural Gas Net Fixed
nr_EmSum  	Emissions Summary
nr_PPPL  	Pulp & Paper P&L
nr_PPPos  	Pulp & Paper Position
nr_PPPrice  	Pulp & Paper Price

Subject: Differences in Portfolio!

I compared the different portfolios in RisktRac and came up with the 
following changes. Hopefully this would help eliminate some of the 
differences amongst the different portfolios ....

FT-Peoples needs to be removed from P Keavey - Currently it is being double 
counted in P Keavey and J Williams.

The following books to be added to AGG-GASII
FT-CAND-EGSC-OPT-BAS 
FT-CAND-EGSC-OPT-PRC 
FT-HPLC-BAS 
FT-HPLC-PRC
FT-INT-CEN-MKT-GDL


These books to be added to AGG-GASIV, AGG-GASIII and Canada
FT-US/CAND-ERMS-GDL (Under J_McKay - Robin please confirm)


Please let me know if you have any other suggestions/comments to help solve 
this problem as soon as possible.

Bilal

What's up?  Are you sore from all that hard work on the soccer field 
yesterday?  I'm bored today.  So tell me something.  Do you think I should 
pull rank on Binh for Valentines day and just tell her "I've been here 
longer, so you can work Valentines night."  The only thing that makes me feel 
bad about that is that she's had that day scheduled for vacation for a 
while.  

Jeff is probably wondering why he pays me today.  I went for a 30 minute 
coffee break with Alejandra and I haven't done anything constructive since 
I've been back.  Oh well.  I really don't have anything to do though.  

Te quiero.

Burton,

The book INTRA-ONT-CAD-GDL  is in the AGG-GASlI portfolio, not in the AGG-GAS 
III and IV portfolios.  Please add this book to both the AGG-GASIII and 
AGG-GASIV portfolios.

Thanks,
Robin

For those tired of the usual "friend" poems, a touch of truth!


When you are sad,.............I will get you drunk and help you plot revenge
against the scum sucking bastard who made you sad.
When you are scared,.........I will laugh at you and tease you about it
every chance I get.
When you are worried,.........I will tell you how much worse it could be and
to quit complaining.
When you are confused,........I will use little words to explain it to your
dumb butt.
When you are sick.........I will hold your hair while you pay homage to the
porcelain god.
When you fall......I will point and laugh at your clumsy butt.
This is my oath...............I pledge this till the end.
Why you may ask?...............Because you're my friend.

Hope it made you laugh - but you know I got your back!!!!!!!!

Robin,
Don't make the changes to the portfolios yet. We have been looking at these 
books already- for we need to actually take Enovate out of Agg-gas IV as 
opposed to adding it in Agg-Gas...
Lets talk about it before we add these books!

Frank forwarded you messaged about the error you were getting when trying to 
load adhoc var.  I can't help you with that issue, but you also mentioned you 
were having problems loading your spreadsheets.  I might be able to help you 
with that one.  Just give me a call.

Gabriel,

I'm not sure if Binh sent an email to you and to Controls to explain the 
Canadian origination variance.  You may already be aware, but on the Orig 
Sched the originations are converted to $US using the spot rate for the day.  
However when the originations are calculated for the Report tab the rate 
applied is the average rate for the month.  Therefore these values will never 
be the same.  Nicole is going to talk to Kathy when she gets back to Canada 
on Monday.  Nicole says she has found a way to modify their spreadsheet so 
that both values are calculated using the daily spot rate.   If you haven't 
recieved an email from Binh explaining this issue you might want to forward 
the attached message from Nicole to Michael and Chris.  

Thanks,
Robin

Subject: Origination Problem

Robin,
I spoke with Kathy regarding the problem we are having with origination. Her 
explanation is as follows:
This is an fx issue. Because origination is denominated in a currency (USD) 
which is different than our functional currency (CAD), origination expense 
will be comprised of not only origination but also currency gains and losses 
on origination. Everyday orig. is retranslated in C$ using the current rate 
and any fx gains or losses relating to that is added to origination.  
Therefore, the total origination as per the "origination" tab will NOT equal 
the origination as per the "report" tab. Robin should add in the translation 
gains/losses to get it to reconcile. 
I hope this explanation makes sense and is acceptable. I know you're used to 
the two numbers reconciling but since we were asked to denominate our 
origination in US dollars (about 2 months ago) these two numbers will never 
again be the same.
Please call if you have any questions,
Nicole

Kathy,

As you know we are trying to eliminate all the plugs on the Gas Benchmark.  
Therefore we would like to begin pulling your positions from the GRMS 
system.  I have attached a file that shows the position that I got when I 
queried GRMS for the June 14 position.  I have also included the detail and a 
copy of what you reported.  

As you will see these positions are significantly different.  Please look at 
the detail and let me know if you see the reason for the descrepancy (ie 
books that we have omitted).  Let me know if you need more information.

Thanks,
Robin

Lynn,

Do you know anything about the Congress Plaza Hotel?  I was searching for 
somewhere to stay and it looks pretty convenient to the office.

I need a change to be made in the p&l numbers that you report for Canada.  
Quarter one needs to be retroactively restated as attached:



This needs to be done so as the Producer Marketing group's income is split 
correctly from Trading income.  This change needs to be reflected in all of 
the managment p&l summaries.  There will be no change in the current DPR 
because all of the YTD and LTD numbers exclude origination.  I can resubmit a 
revised DPR for Jan, Feb and Mar if this makes it easier for you.  This 
change is necessary because the same person is no longer responsible for both 
Origination and Trading in the Calgary office (Lavorato used to be 
responsible for both).  I need this done ASAP because the commercial groups 
need the managment reports to reflect the correct P&L for PRC purposes.

Please call if you have any questions (403-974-6735)

Kathy

I was trying to tell you that the blonde chick from Donna's group is down 
here.  The woman that's always whining about something.  She's driving me 
nuts.  That and the fact that I had a long meeting this morning with your 
other buddy, Chris Disable.  All we did was go in circles for about 45 
minutes.

How's your day going?

Virendra,

Several books were set up in Risktrac will incorrect names.  Is it possible 
to simply change the names of the books already set up or do we need to have 
new books set up?

Hey,

What's going on?  I've had a fabulous day...at least it hasn't been boring.  
Anything interesting in your world?  

It's the first night and I already want to skip my GMAT class.  I may come 
visit you before I go to my class.  I don't want to hang around down here 
until 6.   That is if you aren't too busy today.  

Talk to ya later,
Robin

Please find the attached EES Volumetric NYMEX and Basis positions for 
8/11/2000.   I expect our position to be about 600 contracts long on Nymex 
and <1,763> nominal Basis contracts.  In addition, there are 40 contracts 
long for the Mercury portfolio which is not yet included in the Benchmark 
report.  You may contact me at x3-5070 if you have any questions.




Thanks,

Monica Hwang

Could you please ensure that these books are set up the same in GRMS as in 
ERMS.  They have been officialized and are still not pulling the positions in 
automatically.  I am having to manually override the post-ids.

Brian/Kathy,

I have attached a copy of a report that is given to John Lavorato every 
morning.  This report shows basis positions by trader for specific points.  
Please let me know if the positions we are reporting for the Canadian traders 
are correct.  If you unhide columns C-S you will find the curves that are 
added in each section.  The curves highlighted in green are used for 
intramonth positions and the white are the basis curves.   The intra-month 
position that shows is a combination of  physical and gas daily.  All other 
time periods are only basis notional.  If you have any questions give me a 
call.  

Thanks,
Robin

Hey Robin,

I think your NGMR/AECO/C equiv factors are still out. I checked May 02 and 
July 02 and they both have 0.80, whereas it should have 1.00. Please see the 
table below. This should hopefully correct our differences!!  (currently 
about 50 contracts).

What's going on?  Nothing is happening down here.  I know I whine when I'm 
too busy, but frankly I'm having trouble thinking of things to do today.  Are 
you guys busy?  Is your boss freaking out today?  I just got a call from AA, 
so I guess that'll keep me busy for a while. 

Do you have lunch plans?  I'm thinking about just a trip to the cafeteria.  
Let me know if you want to join me.

Gary/Susan,

It came to our attention yesterday that the PWR-GAS-LT-MGMT-PRC book is 
included in the POS-GAS-TRD portfolio.  This book is officalized by Jenny 
Latham and the position is not reported on the benchmark.  Therefore, I don't 
believe it should be included in the POS-GAS-TRD portfolio.  Also please 
ensure that this book is not included in the AGG-GAS portfolio.  

Thanks,
Robin

Kathy,

As you know we are trying to eliminate all the plugs on the Gas Benchmark.  
Therefore we would like to begin pulling your positions from the GRMS 
system.  I have attached a file that shows the position that I got when I 
queried GRMS for the June 14 position.  I have also included the detail and a 
copy of what you reported.  

As you will see these positions are significantly different.  Please look at 
the detail and let me know if you see the reason for the descrepancy (ie 
books that we have omitted).  Let me know if you need more information.

Thanks,
Robin

Lynn,

I spoke with Laura Luce on Friday, and she asked me to coordinate with you to 
arrange a visit to the Chicago office.  We tentatively discussed scheduling 
my visit for Friday January 26 to Monday Jan 29.  Please let me know if these 
dates are still convenient and who I need to contact to make all the 
necessary arrangements.

Thank you for your help,
Robin

For those tired of the usual "friend" poems, a touch of truth!


When you are sad,.............I will get you drunk and help you plot revenge
against the scum sucking bastard who made you sad.
When you are scared,.........I will laugh at you and tease you about it
every chance I get.
When you are worried,.........I will tell you how much worse it could be and
to quit complaining.
When you are confused,........I will use little words to explain it to your
dumb butt.
When you are sick.........I will hold your hair while you pay homage to the
porcelain god.
When you fall......I will point and laugh at your clumsy butt.
This is my oath...............I pledge this till the end.
Why you may ask?...............Because you're my friend.

Hope it made you laugh - but you know I got your back!!!!!!!!

Frank,
Please find enclosed the PL/SQL scripts that are called from the two C 
programs below. The ERMS packages handle all of ERMS positions, with specific 
handling of Canadian and Intra month positions. The power package handles all 
of ENPOWER databases(Australia, Europe and US) and EXPOWER(US only). The 
spreadsheet handling is an entirely different process which specifically 
handles text files extracted from spreadsheets.

The 'C' programs control the calls to the PL/SQL packages. The ERMS package 
also decides on the strip flag for intra month positions.

Regards,
Ramesh

Hey Brian,

I'm having to plug your positions again.  I checked the conversion factors 
and I have the same ones that you have on the IM Positions tab of your excel 
file.  Let me know if you have any ideas as to what the problem might be.  
I'm attaching a copy of the positions that I pulled in and the detail.  I'll 
talk to you tomorrow.



Thanks,
Robin

I thought you'd appreciate the humor in these.  Actually the first one's kind 
of scary!!  Just in case you think I made this stuff up the web site's at the 
bottom.  

The U.S. Department of Agriculture is actively proposing that animal 
carcasses with cancers,
     tumors or open sores be regarded merely as unaesthetic but safe for 
human consumption as
        long as the offending part is cut away. The proposal is part of a 
general loosening of
     slaughterhouse inspection standards, whose public comment period ends 
Aug. 29. One critic
    already weighed in, saying she did not want to "eat pus from a chicken 
that has pneumonia," but
    also included as benign by the proposal are glandular swellings, 
infectious arthritis and diseases
                             caused by intestinal worms.



                               In Their Own Words

     Hubert Penrod Jr., on why the May promotion he had scheduled for his 
Huge Hooter Haven
     strip club in Nashville had failed to attract men who had come to town 
for the Billy Graham
    Crusade that weekend: "I know all the porn stars, but I don't exactly 
keep up with preachers.
     Hell, I thought Billy Graham was some singer or something. It never 
entered my mind that (it
                was) some preacher (who) was filling up the football stadium."

Subject: Executive Reports Add-In

Attached is the latest version of the Add-In for publishing Executive 
Reports.  It contains the "Pulp & Paper P&L", "Pulp & Paper Position", "Pulp 
& Paper Price", "Emissions Summary", and "Natural Gas Net Fixed Price 
Positions By Book (Ignores Correlation)" subroutines.

John Lavorato is expecting to see these publish reports in the updated viewer 
tomorrow morning!

To use this latest version of the Add-In:

Close all instances of Excel.
Detach the attached websave2.xla file into the Microsoft Office's Library 
directory.  Usually this is C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Library
Launch Excel.
Under the Tools menu selection, select Add-Ins...
In the "Add-Ins available" list, look for "Websave."  If present, uncheck 
it.  This is the old version of the add-in.
There should be a "Websave2" in the list.  This is the current version of the 
add-in.  Check it and click the OK button.

I've also attached a workbook containing a buttons for the new reports that 
you can copy and paste into your production workbooks.  



Here are the named range values and the sheet names for the reports:

Named Range	Sheet Name
nr_NGFixPB  	Natural Gas Net Fixed
nr_EmSum  	Emissions Summary
nr_PPPL  	Pulp & Paper P&L
nr_PPPos  	Pulp & Paper Position
nr_PPPrice  	Pulp & Paper Price

I'm finally finished with Defensive Driving.  What a complete waste of my 
time!!  I passed though.  Can you imagine failing and having to take it 
again?!!  I think I'd rather just pay the extra insurance than sit through 
that again.   It turns out that I only had about 20 minutes left to watch.  
If I'd known that I would have finished it yesterday.  

Have you decided what you want to do tonight?  I had a great nap, so I'm up 
for whatever you want to do (within reason that is). 

Gotta go Canada's calling.

Brian,

Everything was fine with the file.  From now on could you please divide it 
into three separate files?  I've attached the files that I loaded for the 
17th, so if you just keep the same name (just update the date everyday) that 
would help me a lot.   As for the master deal id, as long as they are all 
unique what you had was fine.

If you have any more questions just give me a call.



Thanks,
Robin

Roll-Off logic as requested by you.

Subject: 'NG' positions roll-off logic

Jeremy,

Here is the roll-off logic for 'NG':

1.  For regular ERMS books (not Intra Month book),  first we get the promptDt,

 promptDt := TO_DATE('01'||TO_CHAR(ADD_MONTHS(TO_DATE(p_effDt,'J'),1), 
'MONYYYY'), 'DDMONYYYY');

 Then if p_commodity_cd = 'NG', we go get the cutOff date,
  SELECT exp_dt
           INTO expDate
           FROM egs_expiration_dates
         WHERE expiration_rule_cd = 'Natural Gas Futures'
             AND ref_period_dt = promptDt;

 IF (TO_DATE(p_effDt, 'J') > expDate) THEN
        cutOff := ADD_MONTHS(promptDt,1);
      ELSE
        cutOff := promptDt;
      END IF;

 The strip flag, when populated into rms_deal_legs table, is computed using 
the following DECODE statement,

 DECODE(SIGN(TO_NUMBER(TO_CHAR(ref_period_dt,'J')) - 
TO_NUMBER(TO_CHAR(cutOff,'J'))),-1,-2,NULL).

 Positions with strip flag as -2 will be rolled off by V@R program.

2.  For Intra Month books, first we get the nextMonthDt,
 nextMonthDt := 
TO_NUMBER(TO_CHAR(TO_DATE('01'||TO_CHAR(ADD_MONTHS(TO_DATE(p_effDt,'J'),1),'MM
')||
        TO_CHAR(ADD_MONTHS(TO_DATE(p_effDt,'J'),1),'YYYY'), 'DDMMYYYY'),'J'));

 Then if book flag is 'P', the strip flag, when populated into rms_deal_legs 
table, is computed using the 
 following DECODE statement,

     if pub cd starts with 'GD', then the positions are taken in as 
'FLOATVSFLOAT', and strip flags for
  two legs are,
  DECODE(SIGN(TO_NUMBER(TO_CHAR(ref_period_dt,'J')) - nextMonthDt), 1, -1, 0, 
-1, -1, -2, NULL) and
  DECODE(SIGN(TO_NUMBER(TO_CHAR(ref_period_dt,'J')) - nextMonthDt), 1, 1, 0, 
1, -1, -2, NULL),
  respectively.

     else if pub cd does not start with 'GD', then only positions with 
swap_cd as 'S' are captured as    'SWAP'.  The strip flag is,
  DECODE(SIGN(TO_NUMBER(TO_CHAR(ref_period_dt,'J')) - nextMonthDt), 1, 1, 0, 
1, -1, -2, NULL)

 Else if book flag is 'G', the strip flag in rms_deal_legs is hard coded as 1.


Thanks,

Wei

Subject: Lagrasta Origination

 I appreciate everyone's help in making sure that all the information for 
Lagrasta's originated is deals is accurate.  He is now receiving a daily 
report with all originated deals.  

 He has also asked that we give him the data on the deals that his group has 
done that do not have origination.  Therefore,  going forward we will need to 
put all deals for Lagrasta's group into the origination file.  Meaning,  if 
his group does a deal where no origination is granted,  you will need to put 
all the relevant information into the origination file and just put a $0 for 
the Origination granted on the report.  Thanks so much for your help.

The Gas Spec (Oil NG Hedge) book will show a MTD variance of $819,000 today.  
When the Power p&l was added to this book last week the formulas did not 
divide by 1,000.  Therefore the incorrect p&l was reported.  However, John 
Lavorato was given a corrected report, so this variance will not be included 
in today's daily p&l on the NGP&L.  

If you have any questions feel free to give me a call.

Thanks,
Robin

Hi Robin,

Here are the TXT files.



Can you tell me if there are problems and where they are located. Is the 
source of the trouble between the sb Houston Tab and the TempRevised Tab (The 
source of the TXT files.)? I have checked the links and corrected one since 
yesterday. 

Thanks,
 Brian.

Vern,

I am now responsible for publishing the EES Gas Position Report.   It seems 
that the websave version that I received in the attached email is not updated 
to publish the EES report.  Could you please send me an updated version or 
let me know what I need to do so that I can publish this report?

Thank you,
Robin

Subject: Executive Reports Add-In

Attached is the latest version of the Add-In for publishing Executive 
Reports.  It contains the "Pulp & Paper P&L", "Pulp & Paper Position", "Pulp 
& Paper Price", "Emissions Summary", and "Natural Gas Net Fixed Price 
Positions By Book (Ignores Correlation)" subroutines.

John Lavorato is expecting to see these publish reports in the updated viewer 
tomorrow morning!

To use this latest version of the Add-In:

Close all instances of Excel.
Detach the attached websave2.xla file into the Microsoft Office's Library 
directory.  Usually this is C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Library
Launch Excel.
Under the Tools menu selection, select Add-Ins...
In the "Add-Ins available" list, look for "Websave."  If present, uncheck 
it.  This is the old version of the add-in.
There should be a "Websave2" in the list.  This is the current version of the 
add-in.  Check it and click the OK button.

I've also attached a workbook containing a buttons for the new reports that 
you can copy and paste into your production workbooks.  



Here are the named range values and the sheet names for the reports:

Named Range	Sheet Name
nr_NGFixPB  	Natural Gas Net Fixed
nr_EmSum  	Emissions Summary
nr_PPPL  	Pulp & Paper P&L
nr_PPPos  	Pulp & Paper Position
nr_PPPrice  	Pulp & Paper Price

Please find the attached EES Volumetric NYMEX and Basis positions for

I heard from the admin in  Chicago.  She said Laura (the VP) is going to call 
the HR people and then call me sometime later today.  Maybe we'll actually 
make some progress today.  I'll let you know if I hear something.  

Now get back to work!!

Dawn,

Doesn't it suck to be at work and know that someone else is out of the 
country?  I just want to let you know how much I suffered while you were 
gone.  I realize now just how bad you must want out of this group.  Without 
you or Jennifer there was no real conversation the whole week!!  Chris just 
works quietly.  Jason interrupts the quiet with inane comments that I have no 
idea how to respond to.  And Anne...well I can't even explain that.  

Let me digress for just a moment to talk about work.  Nothing really 
happened.  All was quiet.   If anyone was upset about anything they didn't 
tell me about it.   I did get an email from Frank Cernseck(or how ever you 
spell his name).  It seems we took too much as broker fees in July.  I 
haven't researched it, but from what Victor tells me that's an adjustment 
that needs to be made on last day P&L.  I'm sure I'm not telling you anything 
you don't know.   

Just wanted to let you know I'm glad you're here and I'm not.  

Hope you enjoyed your trip.

Robin

Hey Guys,

We are still not pulling the Intra-Cand-West-Phy book into the benchmark.  I 
have talked to the systems administrator and he thinks it might be in how the 
book is set up in the system.  I have attached below a copy of the screen 
that shows how we have desigated the various codes for this book.  Please 
look at this and verify that we have it set up properly.  If you have any 
questions feel free to give me a call.

I am also attaching the detail that I pulled out of the GRMS system.  Please 
take a look at it and help me identify what is causing our variances.  For 
instance I am pulling a position of (245) contracts for July Price and you 
show a position of long 241 contracts.  




Thanks,
Robin

Robin,
As of the end of the 13th Clark had a Sumas Intramonth Position of 2 
contracts.  

Regarding prompt physical and gas daily positions I don't think that the risk 
is being correctly reflected on the basis reports for Canada given the way 
our market trades (despite what Lavo says he wants).

Kathy,

I added Clark's Aeco position, however I don't show a Sumas Basis position.  
Let me know how much of a sumas basis position he should have and I'll try to 
find it.   As for the prompt physical and gas daily positions, Lavorato 
requested that those positions be shown for intramonth only.  We have other 
traders in Houston that have prompt physical and gas daily positions that are 
not shown on this report.  

Brian,

I adjusted McKay and Lambie's positions, so they should be correct now.  Let 
me know if we are still off.   I have attached a copy of the report 
containing December 12th basis positions.  

Thank you for your help.

Subject: Re: Basis Positions  

Robin,
I have reconciled the positions for Clark and Cowan.  Brian Gillis will do 
Disturnal, Lambie & McKay



I believe that Clark & Cowan's positions were incorrect because of the 
following:
1)  Clark has positions at Sumas and Aeco/Stn2.  This is not reflected in the 
spreadsheet.
2)   Our basis positions for the prompt month in our Intramonth books are not 
being picked up any where.  Because our IM traders actually trade for this 
month AND the prompt month their physical and gas daily positions should be 
picked up as basis positions for the prompt month as well as intramonth.  For 
example, Cowan is long 189 contracts physically Aeco for January.   Our IM 
traders trade prompt and well as intramonth because of the way our Aeco 
prices settle (ie:  during the month preceding, not during bidweek).

Brian/Kathy,

I have attached a copy of a report that is given to John Lavorato every 
morning.  This report shows basis positions by trader for specific points.  
Please let me know if the positions we are reporting for the Canadian traders 
are correct.  If you unhide columns C-S you will find the curves that are 
added in each section.  The curves highlighted in green are used for 
intramonth positions and the white are the basis curves.   The intra-month 
position that shows is a combination of  physical and gas daily.  All other 
time periods are only basis notional.  If you have any questions give me a 
call.  

Thanks,
Robin

David,

Here is a short list of what it takes to pull positions into the benchmark.  

1)  Once a book is officialized it must be loaded into GRMS BEFORE the 
positions can be pulled into the benchmark.  

2) With everyone officializing books around the same time the GRMS que is 
overloaded and positions are very slow to be loaded into GRMS.  

3)  GRMS processes books in the order that they are officialized.  If one of 
your books is officialized behind either the Nymex, Power, or Canadian books 
your book will not  be loaded into GRMS until these books are finished.  This 
process can take up to 45 minutes to complete.  

4)  I have to manually create text files for deals that they system is not 
designed to handle.  These files must then be loaded into GRMS.

4)  I have to manually override Post-IDs that for one reason or another do 
not come in automatically or that come in incorrectly.  

5)  The benchmark query takes approximately 15 minutes to complete.  The more 
books that are officialized, the longer the query takes.  

6)  When books are unofficialized and reofficialized, this effectively sends 
that book to the back of the GRMS que.  This means that the entire process 
must be started over.

7)  Now that plugging positions is no longer an option, I have to spend time 
researching any variances that arise between the GRMS position and the ERMS 
position.

8)  If the book admin and I cannot solve the problem, then I have to contact 
the GRMS support team.  Since this usually occurs after their regular hours 
it takes a while before they can get back in touch with me.  

9)  I cannot query new data while I'm researching variances or on the phone 
with GRMS support because I need access to  the information that is currently 
in the bench.  

10)  Finally, this is a massive file therefore we frequently get errors and 
have to shut down.  Even if the spreadsheet has been saved and no data is 
lost it still take about 10 minutes just to shut this file down and reopen 
it. 

If you have any more questions let me know.

I'm gonna have to kill Rock.

He managed to screw up 3 days worth of Basis Reports on Friday!!  How I have 
no idea.  I had already rolled everything.  All he had to do was query and 
calc it.  Go figure.

It wasn't just me changing plans.  All I ask is that sometime over the 
weekend we see Finding Forrester.  And of course get my car aligned Sat. and 
a tuneup Monday.  Now that I'm thinking about it I'm going to be spending a 
lot of money this weekend on things that aren't exactly fun.  Oh well.  

I'm planning to get out of here around 4:30ish if nothing goes wrong.  So 
just call me at home when you get home.  Oh, yeah....Chipper means happy, or 
in a good mood, kind of in a bouncy mood.

Talk to ya later,
Robin

Good morning.  How's your day going?  Mines pretty good...no screaming yet.  
But then there's still plenty of hours left in this day.  Could you send the 
the procedures you wrote for this job.  Don't you think it's about time I 
figured out what I was supposed to be doing?  

Thanks,
R

separate portfolio named trader under the Lavorato Other region.  

Please let me know when this book is set up.

I'm going to throw up!!!  I don't know who this chick is down here, but Rock 
is telling her about the Bench.  And of course he's telling her how important 
he is and what a great job he does.  I don't think I can stay quiet much 
longer!!!

Here's all my trip information.  Do I need to highlight how long the flight 
is so you'll know when to come pick me up??  How's your day going?  Mine's 
really quiet.  In fact everything went so smoothly this morning that it made 
me nervous.

Gary/Susan,

We need to set up a new Intra-Central Physical Book.

INTRA-CNT-TRANS-PHY

There are already Intra-Cnt-Trans Price, Basis, GD, and IDX books set up.  
The region code for the physical book should be CENTRLTRSP.

If you have any questions please let me know.

Thanks,
Robin

Debbie,
I spoke with Robin, and from what we know Canada officializes one calc that 
includes both their price and basis positions.  (Calc is represented by the 
orange)    However, Risktrac only recognizes the book id to which it assigns 
the post id. (It appears that it is only the PRC book that comes through, the 
BAS book is represented by the red "x", however it is in the same calc.).  
Since the Canadian post id only includes two books ids,  the Benchmark group 
manually assign the same post id to the basis book, that way both books get 
picked up.

Does this help?

Frank

Any last words for your car before I leave for my nap??  Don't worry I'm a

How's everything going this morning?

Subject: Executive Reports Add-In

Attached is the latest version of the Add-In for publishing Executive 
Reports.  It contains the "Pulp & Paper P&L", "Pulp & Paper Position", "Pulp 
& Paper Price", "Emissions Summary", and "Natural Gas Net Fixed Price 
Positions By Book (Ignores Correlation)" subroutines.

John Lavorato is expecting to see these publish reports in the updated viewer 
tomorrow morning!

To use this latest version of the Add-In:

Close all instances of Excel.
Detach the attached websave2.xla file into the Microsoft Office's Library 
directory.  Usually this is C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Library
Launch Excel.
Under the Tools menu selection, select Add-Ins...
In the "Add-Ins available" list, look for "Websave."  If present, uncheck 
it.  This is the old version of the add-in.
There should be a "Websave2" in the list.  This is the current version of the 
add-in.  Check it and click the OK button.

I've also attached a workbook containing a buttons for the new reports that 
you can copy and paste into your production workbooks.  



Here are the named range values and the sheet names for the reports:

Named Range	Sheet Name
nr_NGFixPB  	Natural Gas Net Fixed
nr_EmSum  	Emissions Summary
nr_PPPL  	Pulp & Paper P&L
nr_PPPos  	Pulp & Paper Position
nr_PPPrice  	Pulp & Paper Price

Kathy,

Here is the FT Can Position including the Exotics file.  Let me know how it 
looks.  I'm having trouble getting the IM position to pull in, so if I don't 
send you a file soon just assume I'll plug the numbers to match the excel 
file that Brian saved in the directory.

Thanks,
Robin

Jon,

Attached you will find a copy of the basis positions as reported to John 
Lavorato for November 17.  The positions listed represent the entire Canadian 
office position at each point.  The attached includes only those points that 
John Lavorato has requested be reported by trader, not every point at which 
you have positions.




If you have any questions please let me know.

Hi Robin,

Alright, if this is not correct you have permission to beat me within an inch 
of my life (and I'll be in Houston next week too!).



The IMPositions xls file is also saved to the Houston Directory.

See you in person next week!, I'll let you know when we're official.

Brian

  Hi Robin,

  Congratulations on signing up for the best test prep course
  available! As part of your course, you get enhanced access to
  The Princeton Review's award-winning web site. Below is some
  important  information to help you use these services. Be sure
  to save this email for future reference.

  NEW TO THE WEB?
  ---------------
  If you are not too familiar with using the Web, you should
  check  out "Web 101" at the HotWired site. It's a great
  resource that'll answer just about every question you could
  have about the Web. You can find it at:

        http://www.hotwired.com/web101

  SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
  -------------------
  To use all of the features on the website, you'll need the
  following:

  SAT and GMAT students:

   Web Browser:
 ------------
 PC Users will need Internet Explorer version 5.0 and above
 or Netscape Navigator 4.7 or above.
 MAC Users will need Netscape 4.7 or above.
 JavaScript and Cookies must both be enabled. This is
   the default setting on both browsers so if you haven't changed
   anything, you don't need to worry about this.

 Finally, you=01,ll need a Flash and Acrobat enabled browser.  If
 you do not have these, you need not worry.  Simply click on the
 Requirements Check link after Logging In and clicking on the
 same link off of the Getting Started Page.  The Online check
 will allow you to download all necessary plug-ins.

 Modem:
 ------
 56 kbps or faster

  Students preparing for all other tests:

 Web Browser:
 ------------
   Netscape Navigator 4.0 or higher or Internet Explorer 4.0 or
   higher. JavaScript and Cookies must both be enabled. This is
   the default setting on both browsers so if you haven't changed
   anything, you don't need to worry about this. For best
   results, we recommend using Netscape. If you need to download
   a new web browser, you can do so at the following address:

         http://www.netscape.com/download/

   Modem:
 ------
   28.8 kbps or faster

  LOGGING IN
  -----------
  Whenever you go to the Princeton Review website
  http://www.princetonreview.com, you should click on the "Course
  Students Click Here" button that appears at the top of each
  page. To enable your course services, simply enter your
  username and password in the appropriate fields on the page.
  For your records, here are the username and password you
  selected when you registered:

       USERNAME: robin.rodrigue@enron.com
       PASSWORD: 7@hzq*hq

  LOGGING OUT
  -----------
  If you are using a public computer, like one in a library or
  dorm, it's a very good idea to log out when you finish your
  work on the website. All you have to do is click on the "Log
  Out" link that appears on every page after you log in.

  TAKING TESTS & DRILLS ONLINE
  -----------------------------
  Students taking GMAT, GRE, and USMLE courses will take all of
  their computerized diagnostic tests on the web. Offering
  tests online makes it possible to always ensure that you have
  the most  up-to-date questions available that reflect the
  current make up of the test. It also makes it possible to
  provide detailed analysis of your performance to your
  instructors.

  SAT students can find a plethora [if you don't know this word,
  look it up now!] of drills which target certain problem types.
  If you want to find an extra set of medium geometry questions
  or hard average problems, check out the online drills! You can
  also check out our multimedia versions of the same techniques
  you've been learning in class, to help you remember what you've
  learned.

  GRE and GMAT students, please hold off on taking any online tests
  or drills until your course starts.  Your Princeton Review
  instructor will assign each of the online tests and drills during
  specific points during the program.

  USMLE students, please take Test 1 online prior to attending your
  first class.  Your Princeton Review instructor will assign each of
  the remaining online tests and drills during specific points during
  the program.

  LSAT students, although you will be taking your course practice tests
  in a proctored environment (the LSAT is still a pencil-and-paper test,
  after all) the website does contain detailed explanations for every
"real"
  LSAT problem you will be doing in the course.  Further, if you
supplement
  your course materials with additional real LSATs, you will find online
  explanations for these questions as well.

  TECHNICAL SUPPORT
  ------------------
  Tech support is available at no charge to all Princeton Review
  course students Monday through Friday from 10am until 11pm
  Eastern and Saturday from 12pm to 6pm Eastern. You can reach
  tech support by either phone or email:

       Tech Support Email: websupport@review.com
       Tech Support Phone Number: 1-800-546-2102

  Once again, thanks for choosing The Princeton Review. You are
  well on the way to higher scores!

  Regards,
  The Folks at Princeton Review Online

Hey Becky,

I haven't heard from you in a while.  I know, I know, you haven't heard from 
me either.  I wanted to check in and see how you're doing.  I talked to 
Shannon and she filled me in on how Megan's doing.  I want you to know my 
family and I are praying for you guys.  I know everyone says this but if 
there is anything I can do I'd love to help out.  I'm going Christmas 
shopping this weekend if you need me to pick up anything for you.  I've got 
to finish all my shopping and buy something for my mom from my dad.  He had a 
hip replacement in October and is still hobbling around.  He's actually doing 
really well considering he had major surgery.   I think he expected to be 
running marathons by now.  

I'd love to tell you at lot of interesting things going on in my life right 
now, but unfortunately my life can be summed up in one word right 
now...WORK.  I think my other group members are trying to kill me this 
month.  We have a group of three people and at least two have to be here each 
day.  Well, I have to work a double shift to cover for someone all but one 
week this month.  So that's pretty much all I have time to do now.  In fact 
I'm headed home pretty soon to take a nap before my next shift this 
afternoon.  That is the one bonus of this split shift day.  

Let me know how you're doing when you get a chance.  

Robin

Hey Becky,

What's going on?  Things are completely crazy as usual around here.  I need 
another vacation!  I never told you about my trip did I?  I've told everyone 
else that stood still for more than 10 seconds.  It was so much fun.  The 
olympics were so awesome.  I got to see the US women's basketball team play 
Australia for the gold medal.  The crowd was soooo wild...that is until we 
won.  And I got to see Cathy Freeman and Marion Jones run.  The whole first 
week of my trip was spent at the olympics everyday.  And the second week I 
spent touring all the beaches that I could find.  Oh, here's a funny story 
for you.  Okay I'm halfway across the world in a country known for bronze, 
muscular sufers, right?  So I take a day cruise around the Brisbane waters 
one day.  These cruises are scheduled everyday and each ship holds about 
80-100 people.  As we board the captain tells us that there will be 85 people 
on the cruise.  Here's the fun part....80 of the 85 people were from a WWII 
veterans reunion!!!  I was on a boat full of grandpa's.  Actually it was 
pretty funny.  This one old man sat next to me and started telling me why 
they were having the reunion and what thier batallion had done during the 
war.  Then he tells me (keep in mind this man's at least 70) that he was a 
lifesaver (lifeguard) on one of the local beaches until the year before when 
an injury forced him to retire!!!   Then he starts telling me about the war.  
He said, "Yeah, I was a POW for about 9 days but they weren't feeding me very 
well so I left."  He had escaped from a Nazi POW camp and fled to Greece 
where he joined the Greek reserve forces.  Because he fought with Greece in 
the war he's now a Greek citizen.  Then after the war he and some friends 
bought a van and traveled all over Europe and Asia.  When they ran out of 
money they'd just stop and get jobs until they could save some money and then 
they'd start again.  I hope one day I have stories even half that 
interesting!!  But leave it to me to go halfway around the world and hang out 
with old people!!  

How's everything going at your house?  What's up with this election?  That's 
all anyone's talking about around here.  

Talk to ya later,
Robin

My day sucks so far...how about yours?  I caught a million dollar mistake 
this morning and was feeling pretty proud of myself.  That is until John 
called and said there's something wrong with the P&L.  It was only an $87 
million mistake.  I don't know what the big deal was.  Anyway, things are 
calming down a little now.  I'm just still irritated.  That mistake was 
something I should have caught.  Oh well I'm leaving soon.  

That's enough whining.  So what are you up to today?  I'm looking forward to 
actually being able to go home at a decent time today and having nothing that 
has to be done tonight.  I'm just going to kick back and watch TV.  I might 
call Ragini and Sabina and see if they want to come over for king cake.  
You'll be invited too of course.  

I'm starving.  Do you have any calzones this morning?

Debbie,

I would like to have access to the VAR reports in RisktRac.  I am responsible 
for preparing the Gas Benchmark and the VAR report that is given to ENA 
management each morning.   Therefore I already have access to the VAR 
information.  Please let me know what I need to do to be granted this access.

Thank you,
Robin

Hey Becky,

Shannon forwarded me your last email.  I'm so sorry.  I wish there was 
something I could do or say, but I know that I can't really say anything that 
would help.  Just know that I'm thinking about you guys.  I'm glad to hear 
you got to go running.  I'm sure that was a great stress relief.  How's your 
knee doing by the way.  

I'm still spending most of my days answering stupid questions.  Some people 
just drive me nuts.  They come freaking out telling me something's wrong.  
And if they just relax a minute I can usually explain the problem.  Most of 
the time it's not even wrong they just don't understand the reports.  They 
finally announced that we're selling HPL today.  It's about time that that's 
actually going to happen.  

You'll be glad to know that since I had way too much free time lately (I mean 
I been getting at least 4 hours of sleep lately...way more than any one 
person should have) I'm taking a GMAT review course.  We'll see in a couple 
of months if I have any hope of getting into graduate school.   You wanna 
hear the latest breaking news in my career?  If not skip the next couple of 
sentences.  Shannon doesn't even know this yet.  She might have if she'd quit 
blowing off our lunch plans.   I'm going to visit the Chicago office to talk 
to them about me working up there for a year.  I've talked to a manager in 
the office and the VP over the office already and the job sounds really 
interesting.  But I'm going to go up there and see if I think they are lying 
to me.  We'll see how that goes.  I'm not sure what I think about living 
somewhere that cold.  I'm not sure I even have clothes to go for the 
interview, much less to live up there.  

Has Shannon told you about the guy I'm seeing?  She doesn't think he's too 
bright.  He didn't exactly make the best first impression on her.  He really 
is smart no matter what she tells you.  He's a super nice guy, much nicer 
than me (I know, I know that's not saying much).  But the best part is we 
really have a lot of fun together.  We're always laughing and cutting up when 
we're together.  He's from Mexico and we worked together until the end of 
October when he moved to another group.  Then he came home with me for 
Thanksgiving, but we were still just friends then.  It was pretty obvious 
that there was more there though.  We started dating the next weekend.  It's 
been kind of crazy though.  Since we worked together and we had to review 
each other and we didn't want everyone in our business we haven't told anyone 
we work with that we're dating.  So that's been pretty interesting.  No one's 
said anything yet, but I know there are plenty of rumors going around.  It 
really wouldn't bother me if people found out now since reviews are over and 
he and I are comfortable enough with each other that we can take all the 
questions and harrassment from everyone in risk.  

Well my boss has walked by about 10 times and seen me doing nothing but 
sending emails each time, so I probably better get back to work.  I'd love to 
hear from you if you have time.  If not I understand.  

Robin

Gary/Susan,

It seems that the criteria in the GD-NEW-PRC0 portfolio was deleted.  Please 
add this back so that we can pull positions into the benchmark.  

If you have any questions give me a call.

Thanks,
Robin

No Problem.  One question though, why are we taking Enovate out of Agg-gas?

Robin,
Don't make the changes to the portfolios yet. We have been looking at these 
books already- for we need to actually take Enovate out of Agg-gas IV as 
opposed to adding it in Agg-Gas...
Lets talk about it before we add these books!
Thanks,
Bilal

Is Laura back in the office?  I was hoping we could start working with HR 
early this week, so there would be a possibility that we would have a

Robin,
I took a look at how the Exotics book is being pulled in and everything looks 
fine with the exception of the Nymex equivalency factor for AECOUS.  Would 
you be able to change the factor from 1 to .8 until March 2002.
Thanks
Kathy

Wei,

I am showing a position for the book id listed below when I query RMS Open 
Positions, but I don't see the positions when I query Benchmark Agg_View.   
Can you refresh the table to see if this position will pull into the 
Benchmark Agg_View table?  I am including the book id, post id, and position 
from yesterday.  Let me know if you need any more information.

Couldn't resist sending this!!!!!!!!!!! Sandy
Hopefully no food list will be unhappy with this

A CHANGE IN PLANS

Martha Stewart will not be dining with us this Thanksgiving. I'm telling you
in advance, so don't act surprised. Since Ms. Stewart won't be coming, I've
made a few small changes:

Our sidewalk will not be lined with homemade, paper bag luminaries. After a
trial run, it was decided that no matter how cleverly done, rows of flaming
lunch sacks do not have the desired welcoming effect.

The dining table will not be covered with expensive linens, fancy china or
crystal goblets. If possible, we will use dishes that match and everyone
will
get a fork. Since this IS Thanksgiving, we will refrain from using the
plastic Peter Rabbit plate and the Santa napkins from last Christmas.

Our centerpiece will not be the tower of fresh fruit and flowers that I
promised. Instead we will be displaying a hedgehog-like decoration
hand-crafted from the finest construction paper. The artist assures me it is
a turkey.

We will be dining fashionably late. The children will entertain you while
you
wait. I'm sure they will be happy to share every choice comment I have made
regarding Thanksgiving, pilgrims and the turkey hotline. Please remember
that
most of these comments were made at 5:00 AM upon discovering that the turkey
was still hard enough to cut diamonds. As accompaniment to the children's
recital, I will play a recording of tribal drumming. If the children should
mention that I don't own a recording of tribal drumming, or that tribal
drumming sounds suspiciously like a frozen turkey in a clothes dryer, ignore
them. They are lying.

We toyed with the idea of ringing a dainty silver bell to announce the start
of our feast. In the end, we chose to keep our traditional method. We've
also
decided against a formal seating arrangement. When the smoke alarm sounds,
please gather around the table and sit where you like. In the spirit of
harmony, we will ask the children to sit at a separate table. In a separate
room. Next door.

Now I know you have all seen pictures of one person carving a turkey in
front
of a crowd of appreciative onlookers. This will not be happening at our
dinner. For safety reasons, the turkey will be carved in a private ceremony.
I stress "private" meaning: Do not, under any circumstances, enter the
kitchen to laugh at me. Do not send small, unsuspecting children to check on
my progress. I have an electric knife. The turkey is unarmed. It stands to
reason that I will eventually win. When I do, we will eat.

Before I forget, there is one last change. Instead of offering a choice
between 12 different scrumptious desserts, we will be serving the
traditional
pumpkin pie, garnished with whipped cream and small fingerprints. You will
still have a choice: take it or leave it.

Martha Stewart will not be dining with us this Thanksgiving. She probably
won't come next year either.

I am thankful.

Hey guys,

Here are your positions for tonight.  We are off on FT CAN, but remember I 
included the Exotics text file in that position.  I am also attaching IM 
Canada.  

Please let me know how it looks as soon as possible so we can resolve 
variances before the system is shut down.

Thanks,
Robin

I thought you'd appreciate this email from my brother.  It's the best family 
email I've gotten lately.  I'm such a great sister...I bought the present, 
wrapped the present (or at least watched while the clerk wrapped it), and 
delivered it to my mom for her birthday, and I was nice enough to put my 
brother's name on the gift.

Kathy,

As you know we are trying to eliminate all the plugs on the Gas Benchmark.  
Therefore we would like to begin pulling your positions from the GRMS 
system.  I have attached a file that shows the position that I got when I 
queried GRMS for the June 14 position.  I have also included the detail and a 
copy of what you reported.  

As you will see these positions are significantly different.  Please look at 
the detail and let me know if you see the reason for the descrepancy (ie 
books that we have omitted).  Let me know if you need more information.

Thanks,
Robin

  Hi Robin,

  Congratulations on signing up for the best test prep course
  available! As part of your course, you get enhanced access to
  The Princeton Review's award-winning web site. Below is some
  important  information to help you use these services. Be sure
  to save this email for future reference.

  NEW TO THE WEB?
  ---------------
  If you are not too familiar with using the Web, you should
  check  out "Web 101" at the HotWired site. It's a great
  resource that'll answer just about every question you could
  have about the Web. You can find it at:

        http://www.hotwired.com/web101

  SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
  -------------------
  To use all of the features on the website, you'll need the
  following:

  SAT and GMAT students:

   Web Browser:
 ------------
 PC Users will need Internet Explorer version 5.0 and above
 or Netscape Navigator 4.7 or above.
 MAC Users will need Netscape 4.7 or above.
 JavaScript and Cookies must both be enabled. This is
   the default setting on both browsers so if you haven't changed
   anything, you don't need to worry about this.

 Finally, you=01,ll need a Flash and Acrobat enabled browser.  If
 you do not have these, you need not worry.  Simply click on the
 Requirements Check link after Logging In and clicking on the
 same link off of the Getting Started Page.  The Online check
 will allow you to download all necessary plug-ins.

 Modem:
 ------
 56 kbps or faster

  Students preparing for all other tests:

 Web Browser:
 ------------
   Netscape Navigator 4.0 or higher or Internet Explorer 4.0 or
   higher. JavaScript and Cookies must both be enabled. This is
   the default setting on both browsers so if you haven't changed
   anything, you don't need to worry about this. For best
   results, we recommend using Netscape. If you need to download
   a new web browser, you can do so at the following address:

         http://www.netscape.com/download/

   Modem:
 ------
   28.8 kbps or faster

  LOGGING IN
  -----------
  Whenever you go to the Princeton Review website
  http://www.princetonreview.com, you should click on the "Course
  Students Click Here" button that appears at the top of each
  page. To enable your course services, simply enter your
  username and password in the appropriate fields on the page.
  For your records, here are the username and password you
  selected when you registered:

       USERNAME: robin.rodrigue@enron.com
       PASSWORD: 7@hzq*hq

  LOGGING OUT
  -----------
  If you are using a public computer, like one in a library or
  dorm, it's a very good idea to log out when you finish your
  work on the website. All you have to do is click on the "Log
  Out" link that appears on every page after you log in.

  TAKING TESTS & DRILLS ONLINE
  -----------------------------
  Students taking GMAT, GRE, and USMLE courses will take all of
  their computerized diagnostic tests on the web. Offering
  tests online makes it possible to always ensure that you have
  the most  up-to-date questions available that reflect the
  current make up of the test. It also makes it possible to
  provide detailed analysis of your performance to your
  instructors.

  SAT students can find a plethora [if you don't know this word,
  look it up now!] of drills which target certain problem types.
  If you want to find an extra set of medium geometry questions
  or hard average problems, check out the online drills! You can
  also check out our multimedia versions of the same techniques
  you've been learning in class, to help you remember what you've
  learned.

  GRE and GMAT students, please hold off on taking any online tests
  or drills until your course starts.  Your Princeton Review
  instructor will assign each of the online tests and drills during
  specific points during the program.

  USMLE students, please take Test 1 online prior to attending your
  first class.  Your Princeton Review instructor will assign each of
  the remaining online tests and drills during specific points during
  the program.

  LSAT students, although you will be taking your course practice tests
  in a proctored environment (the LSAT is still a pencil-and-paper test,
  after all) the website does contain detailed explanations for every
"real"
  LSAT problem you will be doing in the course.  Further, if you
supplement
  your course materials with additional real LSATs, you will find online
  explanations for these questions as well.

  TECHNICAL SUPPORT
  ------------------
  Tech support is available at no charge to all Princeton Review
  course students Monday through Friday from 10am until 11pm
  Eastern and Saturday from 12pm to 6pm Eastern. You can reach
  tech support by either phone or email:

       Tech Support Email: websupport@review.com
       Tech Support Phone Number: 1-800-546-2102

  Once again, thanks for choosing The Princeton Review. You are
  well on the way to higher scores!

  Regards,
  The Folks at Princeton Review Online

Robin,
I just want to make sure that all of our txt files that I send you are being 
reported in the benchmarks
1)  Exotics:  I noticed that Canada's exotics positions were not included in 
the benchmark on Friday?  Where are they being reported?  
2)  Power:  Also are Canada's Power positions being reported now - I have 
been sending them on a daily basis for about a week now.
3)  IM:  Please send me what you report for IM as I want to make sure that it 
agrees to the excel file that I save to the Houston directory daily

Nicole,

This is the position EXCLUDING Exotics.  I haven't been able to load the text 
file yet.  But I'll send that as soon as I have it.  I also included the 
detail.  

Let me know if I can help.

Ramesh/Wei,

I just wanted to know what your estimated time was for implementing the code 
to apply basis roll off to the benchmark quantity as well as to the open 
position quantity.  The timing is not critical for our purposes.  I just want 
to make sure it will be available before March bidweek.  If you need any 
information please let me know as soon as possible since  Thursday will be my 
last day in this group.  If you need anything after Thursday please contact 
Binh Pham.  

I have enjoyed working with you both.  Thank you for all your help.

Robin

Subject: Lagrasta Origination

 I appreciate everyone's help in making sure that all the information for 
Lagrasta's originated is deals is accurate.  He is now receiving a daily 
report with all originated deals.  

 He has also asked that we give him the data on the deals that his group has 
done that do not have origination.  Therefore,  going forward we will need to 
put all deals for Lagrasta's group into the origination file.  Meaning,  if 
his group does a deal where no origination is granted,  you will need to put 
all the relevant information into the origination file and just put a $0 for 
the Origination granted on the report.  Thanks so much for your help.

Subject: Canadian VaR


I spoke with Bilal.  It is our understanding that the morning VaR report 
regarding Canada represents how we are capturing positions right now.  We are 
currently decomposing/reconstructing Disturnal's book to capture by region 
code (overall positions would remain the same).  This would impact Disturnal 
positions which will be moved to either McKay or Lambie.   From our side we 
are waiting on  the  IT resolution..  We have set a deadline of the last week 
in November to get this in motion.   On Monday, Bilal will give you a detail 
breakout of the deadline for Canada.

Regarding the the Canadian P&L report, I left a message for Gillis to get the 
numbers out there.

Additionally, last week we resolved the Canadian derived curve problem 
(derived curves were improperly mapped and position was not be captured....)  
We re-ran VaR and the e-mail below summarizes the breakout.  Overall, desk 
VaR decreased because Canadian VaR increased (hedges out portfilio).

Hope this gives you an idea of our progress.
Frank
PS. We will be moving Enovate out of Hunter Shively's VaR and give it is own 
place on the bench. This will probably impact the Central Desk VaR by approx. 
200K

Ivonne,

Thanks for the information.  Will I receive the $3,500 automatically on my 
paycheck, or do I need to submit an expense report to be reimbursed for any 
expenses I incur?  If I do need to submit an expense report, who should I 
turn it in to?

Thanks,

Kathy,

Please review the spreadsheet guidelines I sent.  I am having to recreate 
your text files every night.  Specifically, the master deal id should be a 
unique number (an NA is not acceptable here), the date must be in the d-mm-yy 
format not a julian date format, and there can be NO commas in any numbers.

Thanks,
Robin

Kathy,

I have attached  a copy of the P&L that was reported as of January 31 for 
Canada.  You will notice that Disturnal's P&L is no longer reported as part 
of Canada, however I have included his p&l  for tieout purposes.  If you have 
any questions please let me know.

Robin

This is what I have for Canada's p&l for January 2001.  Can you let me know 
what you reported so that we can make sure that it is the same?  

Kathy

Vern,

I spoke with Annemieke and she said that you would be the person to contact 
about adding a report to the executive viewer.  We need to add a gas report.  
The title of the Report will be Natural Gas Basis by Trader.  I am attaching 
a copy of the report that will be published.  Please let me know if you need 
any additional information.  

Thank you for your help,
Robin

Hey,

It doesn't look like I'm going to make your soccer game tonight.  In fact, I 
won't make the GMAT class either.   Rock officially resigned yesterday, which 
means there's no way they'll let him back in the building.  So I'm now 
running the bench again.  At least until I can get Binh comfortable running 
it.  Maybe that offer in Chicago wasn't so bad after all.  

Enough whining for now.

Talk to ya later,
Robin

Chris,

The Power Book shows a MTD origination variance of $17.5.  This is shown on 
the origination file(Power Tab) and will be picked up on the NGP&L today.  
However it is still not being added into the MTD tab because the book 
administrator added the originator's name to the same cell as the origination 
category.  It is just a concatenate problem, but I don't have access to that 
file.  If you or Michael could fix that I would appreciate it.

Thanks,
Robin

No I did not send the postid's Robin and Rahmann.  I did not realize I needed 
to do this every night.  We can send you our postid sheet everynight if this 
is 
what you need.  When can we expect to get these books off the list?  I keep 
offocializing but they keep showing up on the list.  The physical books may 
not be showing up 
because, as per a previous memo from you, the book names are actually 
INTRA-MONTH-CANADA, and then there are desks are CAN-WEST, CAN-BC and 
CAN-BCPIPE

ids for the PRC books sent to Robin and  Roc so that they could override the 
basis information with the post ids?  Please advise as soon as possible.  I 
will be in class today, but please communicate with Burton regarding the 
status of these books.  

DATE BOOK_ID  
1/23/01 FT-CAND-BC-GD-PHY  
1/23/01 FT-CAND-EGSC-G-BAS 
1/23/01 INTRA-CAND-BC-BAS
1/23/01 INTRA-CAND-BC-PHY 
1/23/01 INTRA-CAND-WE-GD-GDL 
1/23/01 INTRA-CAND-WEST-BAS 
1/23/01 INTRA-CAND-WEST-PHY 


I am anxious to get these glitches resolved, as I am sure you and your team 
are, so that we can confidently report the appropriate credit risk 
information.


I look forward to your reply.


Regards,


Nancy

Harry,

A little birdie told me today was your birthday!!  Unfortunately the little 
birdie gave me the wrong email address the first time or you would have had 
this email earlier.  Anyway, I wanted to wish you a very Happy Birthday.  
Hope you have a great day and we'll see you guys this weekend.

Robin

Nancy,

I've discovered a basis book with the attribute problem we corrected for the 
Physical book below.  INTRA-EMWNSS1-BAS was set up to replace IM-EMWNSS1-BAS 
for credit purposes.  However, the correct region code is still being applied 
to the old book.  Here's what I need to happen.

BOOK ID   CURRENT REGION CODE  CORRECT REGION CODE

INTRA-EMWNSS1-BAS MIDWEST    MDWEST

IM-EMWNSS1-BAS  MDWEST    MDWEST_OLD (This region code really doesn't matter 
as long as it does not                               duplicate a currently 
used region code.)

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks for your help,
Robin

Nancy,

The new attributes you have assigned to the IM-EMWNSS2-PHY  book are 
duplicating the attributes of the INTRA-EMWNSS1-PHY book.  Per my original 
request please change the region code for IM-EMWNSS2-PHY to Midwest_Old, 
since it is my understanding from Burton that this book should no longer be 
used.

If you have any more questions, give me a call.

Robin:

Per your request, the attributes on FT-IM-ENOV-PHY have been changed as 
follows



	Portfolio Code	Book Code	Book Type	Book Flag	Commodity	Region Code
OLD ATTRIBUTES	1	E	M	P	NG	MIDWEST
NEW ATTRIBUTES	P	A	M	P	NG	MIDWEST

In order to prevent duplicate book attributes,  IM-EMWNSS2-PHY attributes 
were also changed as follows:


	Portfolio Code	Book Code	Book Type	Book Flag	Commodity	Region Code
OLD ATTRIBUTES	P	A	M	P	NG	MIDWEST
NEW ATTRIBUTES	P	A	M	P	NG	MIDWEST1

These changes will properly report the ERMS positions in the FT-IM-ENOV-PHY 
book as apposed to IM-EMWNSS2-PHY, which should have no positions.


If you have any questions, please call me at ext 54751

 I couldn't schedule my car appointment for Sat.  They were booked.  So I had 
to schedule it for Monday, and you'll love this.  I need to have it there by 
9am!!  So, if you're still willing to take me to drop it off I'll buy you 
breakfast and then we can go home and take naps.  

I'm leaving now.   Goodnight.

What goin' on?  It's all quiet down here.  In fact, even Jeff is just hanging 
out.  He sat by me and made fun of Lake Charles for half an hour or so.  So I 
don't feel so bad about not accomplishing a whole lot today.  

Hope you're having a good day.

Chris,

Here is our explanation of the 5 Day loss violation.  Let me know if you need 
any more information.

Due to a forecast for mild November weather, futures prices have fallen 
sharply over the last five days.   Nymex futures prices have fallen a total 
of $0.68 over the last five days.  The Gas desk's loss is primarily driven by 
a long price position held by the Financial desk, which averaged 7, 295 
contracts over the same period.

Kathy/Brian,

As I'm sure you know we are trying to determine what is causing the Canadian 
VAR to be so high.  One possible cause that we would like your help 
investigating is the Curve Codes that are being loaded in the position files 
that are manually loaded into the system each night.  It is my understanding 
that positions will be correct even if the curves loaded are spelled  
incorrectly. However, incorrect curve names will result in the positions not 
being captured in the VAR calculation.  Please verify that all the curves are 
spelled correctly in all position files.  

Please give me a call if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Robin

Our net nymex equivalent position for today's exotics portolio is 21 
contracts .  I changed the pubcode for the spread options from a basis curve 
(CGPR-AECO/BASIS)  to a Fixed Price Curve (AECOUS) so hopefully this will 
help us reconcile.

Kathy,

I spoke with the system administrators today and they gave me several more 
guidelines for the text files.  

1) The Book ID must be an existing book (Please use the same book id every 
day).  Also please Sort the Book Id by risk type (ie IMCan-Erms-xl-GDL, then

A Charlotte, NC man, having purchased a box of very rare and expensive
   cigars, insured them against fire, among other hazards. Within a month,
   having smoked his entire stockpile of cigars and without having made
   even
   his first premium payment on the policy, the man filed a claim against
   the
   insurance company. In his claim, the man stated that the cigars were
   lost
   "in a series of small fires".
   The insurance company refused to pay, citing the obvious reason: that
   the
   man had consumed the cigars in the normal fashion. The man sued ... and
   won! The ruling judge agreed that the claim was frivolous. He stated,
   nevertheless, that the man held a valid policy from the company in which

   it had warranted that the cigars were insurable and also guaranteed that

   it would insure against fire, without further defining what would be
   considered to be an "unacceptable fire," and was obligated to pay the
   claim. Rather than endure a lengthy and costly appeal process, the
   insurance company accepted the ruling and paid the man $15,000 for the
   rare cigars he had lost in the "fires".
   And now the good part...After the man cashed the check, the insurance
   company had him arrested on 24 counts of arson. With his own insurance
   claim and testimony from the previous case being used against him, the
   man was convicted of intentionally burning his insured property and
   sentenced to 24 months in jail and a $24,000.00 fine.

Susan,

The NG-PRICE-PRC book will now be calculated using two post ids.  Therefore, 
we need an additional RisktRAC book id for the Price book so that we can 
capture both post ids.  Please set up an NG-PRICE2-PRC book with the same 
attributes as the NG-PRICE-PRC book.  The new books needs to be added to the 
AGG-GAS, AGG-GASIII and AGG-GASIV portfolios.  In AGGIII and IV, please set 
up a separate portfolio for the new book.  The new portfolio should be named 
M_Maggi.  

If you have any questions, give me a call.
Thanks,
Robin

Kathy,

I just spoke with Gary Stadler and he said the number doesn't really matter 
for our purposes but it must be unique for the system.  He suggested you just 
make it a consecutive numbering down the file.

Brooklyn,

What's going on?  How was your holiday?  I thought about you this weekend.  
We had fried turkey.  It was sooo yummy.  I was going to bring you some, but 
there weren't even crums left.  

Well, I just wanted to brag.  So I'll leave you alone.

By the way, how was your trip to Kinder?  Did you have trouble finding the 
hotel or resturant?

Later,
Robin

Vern,

I am now responsible for publishing the EES Gas Position Report.   It seems 
that the websave version that I received in the attached email is not updated 
to publish the EES report.  Could you please send me an updated version or 
let me know what I need to do so that I can publish this report?

Thank you,

Subject: Executive Reports Add-In

Attached is the latest version of the Add-In for publishing Executive 
Reports.  It contains the "Pulp & Paper P&L", "Pulp & Paper Position", "Pulp 
& Paper Price", "Emissions Summary", and "Natural Gas Net Fixed Price 
Positions By Book (Ignores Correlation)" subroutines.

John Lavorato is expecting to see these publish reports in the updated viewer 
tomorrow morning!

To use this latest version of the Add-In:

Close all instances of Excel.
Detach the attached websave2.xla file into the Microsoft Office's Library 
directory.  Usually this is C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Library
Launch Excel.
Under the Tools menu selection, select Add-Ins...
In the "Add-Ins available" list, look for "Websave."  If present, uncheck 
it.  This is the old version of the add-in.
There should be a "Websave2" in the list.  This is the current version of the 
add-in.  Check it and click the OK button.

I've also attached a workbook containing a buttons for the new reports that 
you can copy and paste into your production workbooks.  



Here are the named range values and the sheet names for the reports:

Named Range	Sheet Name
nr_NGFixPB  	Natural Gas Net Fixed
nr_EmSum  	Emissions Summary
nr_PPPL  	Pulp & Paper P&L
nr_PPPos  	Pulp & Paper Position
nr_PPPrice  	Pulp & Paper Price

Hey,

How's your day going?  Mine's been really good...I probably shouldn't have 
said that.  I've actually felt like I'm accomplishing something today.  Isn't 
that novel?  We have Treebeard's for lunch today, YUCK.  It was actually 
pretty funny.  We weren't supposed to have food today, but the Treebeards 
delivered for the traders on the wrong day, so we get a free lunch.  

What are you doing for lunch?  I don't think I can handle Treebeards, so I 
was thinking of going to Subway.  Wanna go?

Bye.
Robin

Robin,
Please see the reconcilation I have prepared.  Our primary difference seems 
to be with the first quarter.  It may have something to do with origination.  
During Q2 I had Q1 restated so that the p&l was did not include orginated 
income.  The p&l numbers that you have provided seem to include originated 
income.
Kathy

Subject: Enron ends exclusive agreement with Blockbuster

As you are aware, Enron signed an agreement with Blockbuster Inc. last summer 
to launch an entertainment on-demand service.  We announced today that we are 
discontinuing our exclusive relationship with Blockbuster in order to expand 
the offering by developing direct relationships with content providers and 
distribution partners.

We have made tremendous progress toward our goal of becoming the leading 
provider of entertainment on-demand over a digital platform.  We rolled out 
the trial service in Seattle, Portland, Salt Lake City and New York in 
December, and today subscribers are buying movies on-demand using the service 
we created.

However, the exclusive relationship with Blockbuster has not yielded the 
quantity and quality of movies needed to drive demand for this exciting, new 
on-demand service.  Now that we have proven the concept, we want to take our 
service to the next level by adding content and subscribers on an accelerated 
basis.  We feel that this can be best achieved by pursuing entertainment 
on-demand independently.

We intend to initiate discussions with various content providers for 
delivering their content over the Enron platform.  We remain very positive 
about the potential of this business for EBS and Enron and will keep you 
apprised of our progress.

Hey,

I checked out the Houston Chronicle website and there were two Preludes that 
would be comparable to mine.  One was advertised for $21,995(which is the 
blue book) and the other was advertised for $18,900ish.  Of course both were 
being sold by dealers, so I probably couldn't get quite that much.  But I can 
probably get enough to make it worthwhile to go ahead and sell my car.  I 
just wonder how long it would take before it actually sold.  

That's what I've accomplished since lunch.  Talk to ya later,
Robin

Guess what I found out this morning.   It looks like I'll be rotating out of 
this job just in time.  Jeff said Louise Kitchen is just like Shankman.  
Yikes...  We've (Jeff and I) not to tell Binh anything about her.  Lavo 
stresses her out, so I don't think she'd take the job if she knows it's only 
going to get worse!!

Hey,

Everyone's asked me how the happy hour was last night.  What a joke.  
Apparently everyone left about 9:00.  And here's the best part...Brad (new 
guy) was walking up as everyone was leaving.  Wasn't it nice of him to call 
and tell us that everyone was gone?  Or at least telling the bozos leaving 
that I was planning on coming so that someone would have called?  I told Jeff 
he owes me a Happy Hour b/c that definitely didn't count.  He said we'd have 
to do a Happy Hour that was for Susan and me.  I told him I wanted my Happy 
hour on the beach in Cancun.  I searched the internet for flights and sent 
him an email with the flight information.  

Talk to ya later,
Robin

PS  Have you decided where we're going for lunch?
