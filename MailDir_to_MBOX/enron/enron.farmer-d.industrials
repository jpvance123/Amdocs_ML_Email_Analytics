sitara # 415267 @ meter # 1332 - look like they'll be taking 10,000/d at best 
for the rest of the month - problems with their gas turbine, they are waiting 
on GE to fix it which will take several weeks

 The swing ticket for Beaumont Methanol "meter #1428" {#249208} expired June 
30th.
 Bob Dorcheus indicated that  HPL should take the swing during July.
 
 Should  I expect another swing ticket to be negotiated for July ?
 
 Presently, the swing activity is hitting the "baseload" ticket {#314854}  
which is 15.0/day.

Lee,

Our cold box will probably not have feed into it until mid May at the earliest.
This means that we will continue to have a large volume of refinery gas going to
fuel.  We are nominating the minimum of 80 BBTU/D knowing that we should start
the month well short of the 80 with the volumes increasing as the month
progresses and the Cold Box comes on line.  Call me if you have any questions.

Brian

Harris County, TX

Our gas supply contract with Lubrizol expired effective May 1, 2000 and 
Lubrizol began purchasing from Tejas.  Lubrizol has decided not to execute a 
Keep-Ready Agreement with HPL to keep this meter on stand-by.  Therefore, 
please take the necessary steps to classify this meter as 'Inactive' and 
insure that no future volumes flow through this meter.

Charlie - we will leave this station in place for now and try to recapture 
this market in three years.  Please have this station locked and secured as 
soon as possible to prevent Lubrizol from taking any unauthorized volumes 
should Tejas be unable to deliver gas for any reason. 

Thanks,  Gerald (#39919)

Change in their safety net gas:

HPL meter would be 24,000/d

effective 9am tomorrow 12/20/00, decrease safety-net gas down to 6,000/d, so 
total flow at HPL meter would be 16,000/d

OK thanks! Will be there shortly. Also, Joanie received a call from Beaumont stating that there is a sale to HPL on 2/9 for 5,000 mmbtu. This was reflected on the supply  draft and Buddy Majorrwitz looked into this before he/we released invoice and said that there were no sales to HPL from Beaumont. Do you have any support or documentation re: any/ all 02/01 prod. sales to HPL ? If so, can I also get a copy of that support to fax to customer?

I still handle meter 1428.  I checked my notes for 2/13.  There was an intraday change from 18.000 to 0.  When it was changed to 0, the meter had already flowed 3.811.  It is a valid volume.  If you have anymore questions, please let me know.

Aimee -
Per conversation with Rosa Brown and Thu (In Volumes Management, Beaumont Methanol is a swing deal, by which the gas sales allocations are handled by the scheduletr. Thu indicated that you were the scheduler for meter # 981428.

Do you still handle the sales allocations for  HPL meter # 981428? If so, can you confirm 02-01 sales (on HPL, Meter # 981428., Sales Deal # 603107), to Beaumont Methanol (which we've invoiced them ), vs. Chyral Hankins' e-mial to buddy Majorwitz below? The only date that is really in question is sales for flow date 02-13-01 (She reflects noms of 0 vs. the 3,811 mmbtu that we invoiced them).

Thanks,
Tess Ray

Daren - After checking with MIPS, you are correct.  Jan. 1 only flowed 19 
dth.  The 5882 dth was a bad estimate.  A better estimate was received on 
1/7/00.
Sorry about all the confusion.

Phillips said we shorted them gas on December 1st so they pulled it on 
January 1.  Can we verify that we did not deliver 5,00 on Dec. 1?  If that is 
the case and this was a firm sale, we owe him some gas at Dec Index less

I'm think I left out a detail - the 54,000 MMBtu for the three days Oct 21 to 
23 to Beaumont Methanol needs to be all priced at the base deal, not on the 
swing ticket.

Ladies and Gents:

On Sat Oct 21, HPL meter # 1428 had a malfunction, and started flowing at a 
very high rate, way over the nominated rate of 18,000/d  (Gas Control will 
confirm this).

Since Sat-Sun-Mon are all one gas day from a Gas Daily perspective, I told 
Gas Control to try to balance on Sun after the meter was fixed, by cutting 
back to a lower flow rate.

So we will need to do a special allocation for the three days October 21 - 
23, Saturday through Monday.  The three day total for the meter is 59,067 
MMBtu.  Beaumont Methanol nominated 54,000 MMBtu (i.e. 18,000/d for 3 
days).   We should allocate a total of 54,000 MMBtu to Beaumont Methanol for 
the three days, and the 5,067 MMBtu excess will be purchased by Brandywine - 
under Sitara # 484934 priced at Gas Daily HSC midpoint.

Please call with questions.

Thanks

Are you still available to assist Robert with entering the new deal tickets 
for Equistar?  After talking with Bryan Hull and Anita Luong, Kyle and I 
decided we only need 1 additional sale ticket and 1 additional buyback ticket 
set up.

You'll may want to run this idea by Daren Farmer.  I don't normally add 
tickets into Sitara.

Kyle and I met with Bryan Hull this morning and we decided that we only need 
1 new sale ticket and 1 new buyback ticket set up.  The time period for both 
tickets should be July 1999 - Forward.

The pricing for the new sale ticket should be like tier 2 of Sitara #156337 
below:



The pricing for the new buyback ticket should be like tier 2 of Sitara 
#156342 below:

 Should I roll this deal to cover August 2000 activity ?
 
 Volumes todate are as follows:     82mm  8/16
       85mm  8/17
                      65mm  8/18
       57mm  8/19
       60mm  8/20

 Sitara ticket #: 363514

 These small meter flows are causing allocation exceptions for August.

 I spoke with Bob Dorcheus, Brandywine about this issue and he suggest you 
and he get together and agree on a 
  price because the gas flowed into the plant.

 This gas flowed without a nomination.

The volumes on meter #1266 for 7/1/00 and 7/31/00 are valid gas flow.  7/1/00 
volumes are carry over from June activity (meter was shut in a little after 
9:00 AM on 7/1/00).   7/31/00 volumes were caused by the plant bringing on 
the meter before 9:00 AM on 8/1/00.

If you have any questions please call.  36449.

Julie, Texas City had an unscheduled occurrence this morning tripping one
unit. The estimated time for repairing the unit will be Friday the 13th. I
will update you and HPL Gas Control as we approach a restart time. The
estimated burn until then will be around  65,000 MMbtu/day. Thanks.

FYI - did a baseload deal with Union Carbide at Seadrift HPL meter # 1332 for 
Oct00 that will require some coordination with Terry Calvert of Union 
Carbide, who can be reached at 713-973-5665.  I want to pass on details in 
case I'm out when he calls - I'm going to pass on y'all's phone #'s to Terry

Here's the deal:

10,000/d @ IFHSC - $0.04
10,000/d @ GD-HSC mid - $0.03

PLUS

0 to 10,000/d swing to be nominated day before @ GD-HSC mid - $0.03

So Terry knows he's supposed to call us by 9.30am if he wants gas to take any 
of the last tier.

All the above is in Sitara 415267

Thanks

Lee

Daren,
Howard set up the Shell meters to one buyback ticket - I haven't 
been pathing the shell meters. Before Aimee had it set up
individual and Howard said that it should all be tied to one.

Am I causing a problem by not pathing the meters now?
Should I go back and path the deal changes?
Thanks - Julie

   I spoke to Anita this morning and she suggested I forward you this request 
to set up a Sitara ticket for an "ENA" deal 
    ticket to handle the buyback on meters 981373 & 981384 that pretain to 
Equistar for June and July 2000.
 
   Equistar invoice can not be drafted without this deal ticket.
 
   This is an urgent request for Settlement to finalize Equistar invoice for 
June 2000 activity.

 Daren wanted me to make this request to you for an Equistar Buyback Ticket 
on Enron North America{ENA}.
 
 Equistar has nominated activity on ENA for June and July 2000 production.
 
 Settlement seems to think a Buyback ticket is necessary to properly account 
for Equistar's monthly activity.

Rebecca

For Mobil in March, beginning on March 21, HPL started delivering 30,000/d for MidCon (just like we did in Dec and Jan, and maybe in Feb too)

Check with Daren Farmer when you get ready to do the flash invoice on the first to confirm the MidCon volume amounts and dates

Thanks!!!!!

We had a deal with Beaumont in Sep00 .... Sitara 380722.  There are swing 
(380725) and buyback (380727) tickets associated with this deal.

For the three days September 16, 17 and 18 ONLY, any volumes over 20,000 
MMBtu per day need to go to a DIFFERENT swing deal ticket, with a different 
counterparty.  I've set this deal ticket up - it is Sitara # 423794

Sorry to make y'all go back and re-assign volumes.

Let me know if any problems or questions.

Brian Nichols of ExxonMobil confirmed that they will accept 30,000/d of 
MidCon's gas on HPL starting tomorrow.

They want to leave 10,000/d flowing on MidCon.

I guess this goes on through April 5??

I am confused. What file do you want me to update;   Julie Meyers file or Ken 
Seaman file ?
  Both files  provide similar data which is helpful to all of our support 
groups.
  To  prepare both files I feel is a duplicate of my efforts .  Please let 
know if you want both files updated
   and the approximate time table for completion.

Robert, 

Ken developed an industrial report before he left.  It can be found at

month of 2000.  I need you to update this for March.  This will need to be

Daren - the valve for meter 1031 was not shut off in time on 3/1.  It flowed 
about 1.200.  Could you please extend the deal for one day (deal 589188) ?  
Thanks.

Are you still available to assist Robert with entering the new deal tickets 
for Equistar?  After talking with Bryan Hull and Anita Luong, Kyle and I 
decided we only need 1 additional sale ticket and 1 additional buyback ticket 
set up.

Kyle and I met with Bryan Hull this morning and we decided that we only need 
1 new sale ticket and 1 new buyback ticket set up.  The time period for both 
tickets should be July 1999 - Forward.

The pricing for the new sale ticket should be like tier 2 of Sitara #156337 
below:

Daren - Thu has asked if I can extend deal 343421 thru Feb. '01.  I told her 
I didn't have the authority to do this.  It is for Equistar.  It looks like 
it is a term deal expiring Jan. '01.   She wants it added to keep the ENA 
deal whole.  What do you suggest?

Aimee,

This is the deal for Equistar.  There is not enough gas at meter 1373 to keep 
the ENA deal whole.  I need this deal to create buyback.  This was out there 
last month and Anita told me to get the deal extended.  Let me know if there 
is another way.

Daren,
I have HPL Resources meter 988055 wasn't sure if I should path this for April 3rd's deal change.
and I have Mobil Oil meter 981040 that I pathed on the first for 30,000 that change to 50,000 for the 3rd.
I didn't path them since they are industrials and Aimee's notes told me to path Industrials -
except for a few exceptions.
Thanks, Julie

Ladies and Gents:

On Sat Oct 21, HPL meter # 1428 had a malfunction, and started flowing at a 
very high rate, way over the nominated rate of 18,000/d  (Gas Control will 
confirm this).

Since Sat-Sun-Mon are all one gas day from a Gas Daily perspective, I told 
Gas Control to try to balance on Sun after the meter was fixed, by cutting 
back to a lower flow rate.

So we will need to do a special allocation for the three days October 21 - 
23, Saturday through Monday.  The three day total for the meter is 59,067 
MMBtu.  Beaumont Methanol nominated 54,000 MMBtu (i.e. 18,000/d for 3 
days).   We should allocate a total of 54,000 MMBtu to Beaumont Methanol for 
the three days, and the 5,067 MMBtu excess will be purchased by Brandywine - 
under Sitara # 484934 priced at Gas Daily HSC midpoint.

Please call with questions.

Thanks

Lee

 Should I roll this deal to cover August 2000 activity ?
 
 Volumes todate are as follows:     82mm  8/16
       85mm  8/17
                      65mm  8/18
       57mm  8/19
       60mm  8/20

 These small meter flows are causing allocation exceptions for August.

and he get together and agree on a 
  price because the gas flowed into the plant.

 This gas flowed without a nomination.

The volumes on meter #1266 for 7/1/00 and 7/31/00 are valid gas flow.  7/1/00 
volumes are carry over from June activity (meter was shut in a little after 
9:00 AM on 7/1/00).   7/31/00 volumes were caused by the plant bringing on 
the meter before 9:00 AM on 8/1/00.

If you have any questions please call.  36449.

Thanks

got a call last night from Carbide - they rescinded the change from 14,000/d 
rate to 6,000/d rate for safety net gas that was due 9am this morning. 

So here's where we should be now with Carbide:

Seadrift - no saftey net, just the 10,000/d baseload deal

Texas City - 10,000/d of the term deal, plus 14,000/d of safety net, total 
24,000/d

call with questions

Daren,

I am trying to make up the gas for ENA deals on meter 1552,8024,1062, (deals 
240061, 378904, 394489, 487588).  Per Anita, these need to be kept whole.  I 
have the option of a buyback or swing on 1373....but, there is not enough gas 
at meter 1373 to do this.  Please let me know if there is another way I can 
achieve this.

We have a buyback under HPL (#586534).  ENA had only 7,000/day scheduled at 
mtr 1373 in Feb.  In reviewing the daily volumes in POPS, I didn't see any 
days with flow under 18,000.  So, we should not need a buyback for ENA.  Any 
shortages should be allocated to the HPL ticket.

Daren - Thu has asked if I can extend deal 343421 thru Feb. '01.  I told her 
I didn't have the authority to do this.  It is for Equistar.  It looks like 
it is a term deal expiring Jan. '01.   She wants it added to keep the ENA 
deal whole.  What do you suggest?

This is the deal for Equistar.  There is not enough gas at meter 1373 to keep 
the ENA deal whole.  I need this deal to create buyback.  This was out there 
last month and Anita told me to get the deal extended.  Let me know if there

 First of the month  industrials are coming along fine.  I will finalize my 
pathing tomorrow, Thursday,  and set up buybacks and swings by the
    end of day Friday.
 
     The industrial "Buyback & Deficiency Deals" worksheet  has captured the 
necessary data to help Gas Control & the on-call scheduler as well as  
      myself and Client Services.
      I  will have a preliminary worksheet done by the end of day Friday.
 
      I am on vacation during the week of July 5th thru July 10th.

When will the buybacks and swings be set up for July?  I am a little 
concerned with the long weekend coming up.  I believe that we agreed that 
these would be set up by the 3rd work day, which would be Friday the 7th.  
(Six days of flow.)  I definitely don't think that we should any later.  It 
would be great if this could be handled sooner, miimizing our economic impact.

Additionally, we need to get the Industrial spreadsheet up and running 
again.  This report is very beneficial to Gas Control, industrial traders and 
schedulers on call.

Let me know what you think.

I had to go clean up some stuff at meter # 1428 for Sep00 that will cause a 
reallocation of volumes.

Previously, all activity at the meter was with Beamont Methanol.

Now, for the period Sep 5 to Sep 18, I've entered daily transactions with 
Brandywine in Sitara # 423794

Please call to discuss is any questions

This is in regard to the maintenance that you want to do at the Texoma - 
Beaumont interconnect (replace some valves, I believe).

We had discussed doing this at a time when Mobil Beaumont Refinery would have 
low gas takes.  That window of opportunity will be in early to mid February.

Mobil will take down some of the units at different times during the month.  
Some of these units are endothermic, some are exothermic, so in some cases 
their gas load goes up when they take certain units down.  But based on the 
schedule of ups and downs that I've been given, it looks like their gas load 
will be at a low point between February 1 and February 12, at somewhere 
around 50,000/d.  Last we talked about HPL continuing to deliver 20,000/d 
through the low pressure meter, and delivering the rest through Centana.  Is 
this still the plan??

We met with Mobil last year in July to talk to them about what we need to 
do:  that it would take less than a day, and that during that time, HPL would 
deliver some of our gas to them through the Centana meter.  But that meeting 
was a long time ago, and we might need to meet again - you know how 
conservative

One thing of concern:  in the past two months, we have effected some of our 
MidCon delivery obligation by delivering 30,000/d gas in kind to Mobil 
Beaumont.  So we will not be able to do this during the day that we do our 
maintenance.

Once you gents let me know what you game plan is and confirm how we'll handle 
gas flows while we do our work, I'd like to be the one that initially tells 
Mobil of our plans and set up the initial meeting.  It's going to take a lot 
of coordination because I can guarantee you that Mobil's maintenance schedule 
will change!

Daren,

I am trying to make up the gas for ENA deals on meter 1552,8024,1062, (deals 240061, 378904, 394489, 487588).  Per Anita, these need to be kept whole.  I have the option of a buyback or swing on 1373....but, there is not enough gas at meter 1373 to do this.  Please let me know if there is another way I can achieve this.

We have a buyback under HPL (#586534).  ENA had only 7,000/day scheduled at mtr 1373 in Feb.  In reviewing the daily volumes in POPS, I didn't see any days with flow under 18,000.  So, we should not need a buyback for ENA.  Any shortages should be allocated to the HPL ticket.

Daren - Thu has asked if I can extend deal 343421 thru Feb. '01.  I told her I didn't have the authority to do this.  It is for Equistar.  It looks like it is a term deal expiring Jan. '01.   She wants it added to keep the ENA deal whole.  What do you suggest?

This is the deal for Equistar.  There is not enough gas at meter 1373 to keep the ENA deal whole.  I need this deal to create buyback.  This was out there last month and Anita told me to get the deal extended.  Let me know if there is another way.

Aimee, our scheduled maintenance starts Saturday night at midnight and will
continue most of the month, per our scheduled maintenance letter sent in
January. The plant should burn around 85,000 on Saturday. Beginning Sunday

Rebecca:

I spoke with Brian Nichols about the August preliminary invoice.  There 
appears to be a problem for August 28 & 29 - the volumes are much too low.

Either there were deliveries off of Centana that we are missing, OR there is 
a problem with the HPL data.  I am having brain fade and cannot remember the 
name of the person in the measurement department to contact, so maybe you 
could look into this and have it corrected.

Thanks

Lee

I am pretty sure this is a "high zero" and will be adjusted out by 
measurement.  So, disregard these spurious volumes coming across.

Subject: Mobil Discrepancies

Lee,
Here are some specific situations I am trying to resolve regarding volume on 
Centana:

Purchase from Mobil:
2/99 - The purchase by HPLR for 155,000mms in deal 60978 was never billed by 
Mobil.  
 (A purchase of gas in storage with no physical movement per comments in 
sitara). 
  Per our conversation Friday, it sounds like HPLC does owe Mobil for his 
gas, right?


Sale to Mobil:
1/2000 - Per the pipe statement provided by Greg Bonin for Centana volumes, 
299,893 
 flowed in January.  I billed 299,893 and Mobil paid it.
 Logistics said 19,893 of the gas that flowed was not our sale to Mobil 
because
 the gas wasn't scheduled.  In addition, if the 19,893 were a sale to Mobil, 
the 
 point would not be in balance in the system.  The source of 280,000 of the 
gas
 says they only sold 280,000mms and not any more. No other sources are in the 
system.
 
 I assume if the 19,893 wasn't consumed by Mobil, they wouldn't have 
 paid for it.   Is there storage involved here?  If so, whose storage and how 
did it work?


There are sales in other months with discrepancies on Centana with smaller 
volumes 
than in 1/2000.  Once I understand what happened in January, maybe that will 
help me
with the other months.

Please let me know if there is any other information you need from me 
relating to 
the questions above and when would be a good time for you to discuss this.  I 
can bring
the pipe statements to you if that would help.

Thanks,
Kris

When will the buybacks and swings be set up for July?  I am a little 
concerned with the long weekend coming up.  I believe that we agreed that 
these would be set up by the 3rd work day, which would be Friday the 7th.  
(Six days of flow.)  I definitely don't think that we should any later.  It 
would be great if this could be handled sooner, miimizing our economic impact.

Additionally, we need to get the Industrial spreadsheet up and running 
again.  This report is very beneficial to Gas Control, industrial traders and 
schedulers on call.

Let me know what you think.

Ed - can you help?  I need to know the term of our existing transport expense 
deal with Reliant Entex to serve the referenced customer.  We must have an 
existing contract that we can look up.  Our existing deal to sell to Mobil 
expires October 1.  I am trying to make a two year sales offer beginning 
October 1.  If the transport expires before then, then we'll need to call 
Entex about a transport rate.  Who is the correct dealmaker to call Entex on 
this matter??  I'd be happy to do it, but I'd be stepping on somebody else's 
turf.

If the existing rate is indeed 5 cents plus 2.02% fuel, that seems kind of 
high.  It's a short haul -  according to our field folk, we give the gas to 
Entex at the La Porte City Gate, and it goes to the Mobil plant at Pasadena, 
about 10 miles away at the most.

Any and all help appreciated.

Lee

There have been some fluctuations @ Dupont meter # 1266 - I believe Conoco 
transport is only business there - see below

Is the transport set up to take these small swings?

 Conoco has nominated 5.0/d at this meter.  Conoco transport can be allocated 
the entire meter flow for the days in which the meter flow
 exceed 5.0mm because they are the only party doing business at the meter.
 
 HPL may also be able to extract a sell for this overage which is why  I 
wanted you to be aware of the daily activity thus far.

 This gas flowed without a nomination.

The volumes on meter #1266 for 7/1/00 and 7/31/00 are valid gas flow.  7/1/00 
volumes are carry over from June activity (meter was shut in a little after 
9:00 AM on 7/1/00).   7/31/00 volumes were caused by the plant bringing on 
the meter before 9:00 AM on 8/1/00.

Westvaco is a brand new company.  I have added March also, didn't know about that one.  Also, there will be one for Rohm & Haas, hopefully will be down in the next day or two.  And there will not be one for Bayer in April.

Brian Nichols of ExxonMobil confirmed that they will accept 30,000/d of MidCon's gas on HPL starting tomorrow.

They want to leave 10,000/d flowing on MidCon.

I guess this goes on through April 5??

Mobil says the low point of their takes will be during February will be from 
Feb 1 to 14.  So any day in that time period would be a good time for HPL to 
do the required maintenance at the Texoma-Beaumont system interconnect.

We need to define our game plan: 
- what day to do the work
- how much gas HPL will deliver through our own meter
- how we use Centana to deliver the rest of the HPL volumes
- if we had planned in Feb to baseload some of our MidCon obligation at Mobil 
as we have done in Dec and Jan, then we will need to do something different 
whenever we do the maintenance

James - we are scheduled to meet with Mobil in Beaumont at 10.30am Thursday 
Feb 1, to go over the game plan with them.

Pat - do you want anyone from HMS to attend?

Thanks

Lee

 Conoco has nominated 5.0/d at this meter.  Conoco transport can be allocated 
the entire meter flow for the days in which the meter flow
 exceed 5.0mm because they are the only party doing business at the meter.
 
 HPL may also be able to extract a sell for this overage which is why  I 
wanted you to be aware of the daily activity thus far.

 Should I roll this deal to cover August 2000 activity ?
 
 Volumes todate are as follows:     82mm  8/16
       85mm  8/17
                      65mm  8/18
       57mm  8/19
       60mm  8/20

 Sitara ticket #: 363514

 These small meter flows are causing allocation exceptions for August.

Please set up a ticket priced at Gas Daily Houston Ship Channel midpoint 
minus $0.03

Also, can you let me know the exact volumes in question on July 1 and July 
31?  Dorcheus wants to know.  Me too.

 Just a reminder that "allocation close"  is Monday, August 14th.
 
 A  Sitara ticket is needed to set up an Acctg. Arrangement which will 
eliminate  the allocation exception for meter # 981266
 {Victoria Station # 2/ Brandywine}.

 I spoke with Bob Dorcheus, Brandywine about this issue and he suggest you 
and he get together and agree on a 
  price because the gas flowed into the plant.

 This gas flowed without a nomination.

The volumes on meter #1266 for 7/1/00 and 7/31/00 are valid gas flow.  7/1/00 
volumes are carry over from June activity (meter was shut in a little after 
9:00 AM on 7/1/00).   7/31/00 volumes were caused by the plant bringing on 
the meter before 9:00 AM on 8/1/00.

If you have any questions please call.  36449.

Just want to make sure volumes are allocated to two different tickets correctly for March:

Sitara - 572910 - gets 50,000 MMBtu TOTAL for the month .... after 50,000 on this ticket, all remaining volumes go to ...

Sitara 643510 - the swing ticket

increase 1095 by 5M; net effect is zero.  Please let me know if the deal

This is to confirm that we need to take our delivery to HPL meter # 1428 to 
zero !!

Beaumont Methanol started a controlled shut-down last night (they will be 
down in Dec00 due to high gas prices) .... and it became an "out-of-control" 
shut in and they had to shut down last night, and are now taking no gas from 
the DuPont header.

 Daren wanted me to make this request to you for an Equistar Buyback Ticket 
on Enron North America{ENA}.
 
 Equistar has nominated activity on ENA for June and July 2000 production.
 
 Settlement seems to think a Buyback ticket is necessary to properly account 
for Equistar's monthly activity.

Subject: January Nominations at Shell Deer Park


Gary,

January 2001 nominations for gas delivery to Shell Deer Park are as follows:

Firm Baseload - 110,000 MMBtu/d
Spot Swing supply - 0 (zero)

Delivery of the above contract quantities is expected to be as follows:

  HPL-HP   HPL-E   HPL-S
 Firm 35,000 MMBtu/d 40,000 MMBtu/d 35,000 MMBtu/d

On or about January 7th we are currently planning on beginning our much
anticipated scheduled turnaround work. Natural gas demand is expected to
decrease with HPL's portion being 20,000 MMBtu/d coming primarily out of the
HP/E station. This will leave total demand at 90,000 MMBtu/d for the
remainder of the month.

Please let me know if you have any questions

We no longer have a standby deal with either OxyChem or DuPont/Brandywine, 
the two counter parties behind the meter,

Subject: Brandywine Meter #: 981225 ; March, 2000 Activity

There was no flow at meter 981225 for the month of March.  The HMS technician 
did contact measurement once to get the volumes zeroed out but apparently he 
will have to get with them again.  I have notified the tech and he is in the 
process of doing this.

The meter is set on pressure control and the valve is open.  Gas Control's 
understanding and the field's understanding is that at the time the 
Brandywine deal ended some sort of standby agreement was in place.  If this 
is not the case please let me know and we will notify the plant and close the 
valve.

Robert,  
 In the future if you have meters like this where there is a small flow 
volume without a nomination in place please check with Earl and myself so we 
can investigate before we get commercial involved.

Thanks

      Since Unify {MOP}  is down today it will be impossible to meet my 
aggressive deadline for completing 
         the "Ken Seaman" report.
         Once the system is up and running, I will complete the report and 
the Julie Meyers report.
          I am updating both reports  with the information available.
 
         This message really is intended for Gary because Daren and Pat is 
aware of my situation.

  Both files  provide similar data which is helpful to all of our support

Robert, 

Ken developed an industrial report before he left.  It can be found at 
o/logistics/kenseaman/industrialsmonthly/...  There is one file for each 
month of 2000.  I need you to update this for March.  This will need to be 
distributed to Gas Control, Logistics, and myself.  Let me know if you have 
any questions.

Daren -
Howard came by and asked me to check with you regarding deal 717768 starting 
April 6th for 2,000 - it was created by you April 5th. . He wasn't sure if it was a buy back and if you wanted me to
link the buy back deal to 692725. The buyback deal for this is normally 544392(when it was on meter 8216). Do you want
this deal to act as the buy back or stay whole.  Thanks - Julie  

receipt 2,000 deal 717768 - buy back?
delivery 5,500 deal 544388 - daily swing
delivery 8,500 deal 692725 - stays whole first

Just wanted to thank everybody who works with Mobil Beaumont Refinery.

Our former three year deal with them expired September 30.  Last week, we 
(finally) executed a new contract that keeps HPL as their largest natural gas 
supplier through September 30, 2002.  Also, when their volumes go up in early 
2001, they will once again be HPL's single largest industrial customer.

Everybody's hard work in keeping this customer happy has paid off.  Although 
they can be very demanding to work with (particularly now that they are part 
of Exxon), they know that HPL provides them the best overall service.

Please pass on thanks to anyone I've left off the list who has worked with 
Mobil Beaumont Refinery.

Have a great 2001.

I have confirmed with Rusty at Shell for October.  Expected flows by meter 
are as follows:

 1060 - East Low Pressure:  35M
 1061 - West Low Pressure: 0M
 1095 - Shell South: 40M
 1581 - Shell High Pressure: 15M

The numbers may flip around in a couple of weeks, after they bring some units 
back on at Meter 1581.  We need to just be sure that they keep a rate between 
points of 90M/Day.

Please let me know if you have any questions, comments.  

Thank you,

Mary

 First of the month  industrials are coming along fine.  I will finalize my 
pathing tomorrow, Thursday,  and set up buybacks and swings by the
    end of day Friday.
 
     The industrial "Buyback & Deficiency Deals" worksheet  has captured the 
necessary data to help Gas Control & the on-call scheduler as well as  
      myself and Client Services.
      I  will have a preliminary worksheet done by the end of day Friday.
 
      I am on vacation during the week of July 5th thru July 10th.

When will the buybacks and swings be set up for July?  I am a little 
concerned with the long weekend coming up.  I believe that we agreed that 
these would be set up by the 3rd work day, which would be Friday the 7th.  
(Six days of flow.)  I definitely don't think that we should any later.  It 
would be great if this could be handled sooner, miimizing our economic impact.

Additionally, we need to get the Industrial spreadsheet up and running 
again.  This report is very beneficial to Gas Control, industrial traders and 
schedulers on call.

Let me know what you think.

I spoke to Sabrae,  we are cumulatively balanced with PGE, cumulative and 
don't want to do anything volumetric at either meter.  The NNG OBA is being 
reconciled, and they are really hesitant/reluctant to balance current month.  
Florida can be paid back 5M or more, it is being reconciled, but, Sabrae is 
okay with paying back.  This just in from Mark McCoy, the Oasis OBA is flat 
as of today's gas day.  That should hit the imb. report next week.

Daren - Thu has asked if I can extend deal 343421 thru Feb. '01.  I told her I didn't have the authority to do this.  It is for Equistar.  It looks like it is a term deal expiring Jan. '01.   She wants it added to keep the ENA deal whole.  What do you suggest?

This is the deal for Equistar.  There is not enough gas at meter 1373 to keep the ENA deal whole.  I need this deal to create buyback.  This was out there last month and Anita told me to get the deal extended.  Let me know if there is another way.

Janice Berke-Davis @ Equistar has asked to move around some of the firm deals 
they have this month.  She would like these changes to be effective today, 
September 19.  I don't have Sitara #'s, so I'll have to describe the packages 
by volume and price

1. There is a package of 5,000/d @ meter # 1552 priced at greater of $4.35 or 
IFHSC - $0.10.   She wants this package of gas moved to meter # 1373

2. There is a package of 5,000/d @ meter # 1553 priced at greater of $4.35 or 
IFHSC - $0.10.   She wants 4,000/d of this package of gas moved to meter # 
1373, leaving 1,000/d at meter #1553

If any questions, please call her directly at 713-652-4148

Thanks

Lee

Rebecca:

I spoke with Brian Nichols about the August preliminary invoice.  There 
appears to be a problem for August 28 & 29 - the volumes are much too low.

Either there were deliveries off of Centana that we are missing, OR there is 
a problem with the HPL data.  I am having brain fade and cannot remember the 
name of the person in the measurement department to contact, so maybe you 
could look into this and have it corrected.

Thanks

 Daren wanted me to make this request to you for an Equistar Buyback Ticket 
on Enron North America{ENA}.
 
 Equistar has nominated activity on ENA for June and July 2000 production.
 
 Settlement seems to think a Buyback ticket is necessary to properly account 
for Equistar's monthly activity.

Just want to make sure volumes are allocated to two different tickets 
correctly for March:

Sitara - 572910 - gets 50,000 MMBtu TOTAL for the month .... after 50,000 on 
this ticket, all remaining volumes go to ...

Sitara 643510 - the swing ticket

THANKS

When will the buybacks and swings be set up for July?  I am a little 
concerned with the long weekend coming up.  I believe that we agreed that 
these would be set up by the 3rd work day, which would be Friday the 7th.  
(Six days of flow.)  I definitely don't think that we should any later.  It 
would be great if this could be handled sooner, miimizing our economic impact.

Additionally, we need to get the Industrial spreadsheet up and running 
again.  This report is very beneficial to Gas Control, industrial traders and 
schedulers on call.

Let me know what you think.

Daren,

A sale to Oxy Vinyls went into effect 10/01 through 10/16 for 5,000 per day.  
We also delivered gas to Entex, 10,000/day for the entire month.  More gas 
was pulled towards the end of the month than confirmed and I need to know if 
Oxy Vinyls should get the swing for the remaining of the month even though 
their deal went to zero.  Please advise.

Susan

The deal will continue as in months past, however the sales price is I (.035).
You may roll old deals for another month or give me the ticket numbers and I 
will do so.

I have changed Sitara to agree with the contract.  This was changed during flash to get around some pricing errors.

Please advise on the 04/01 price for sales deal #SA 413462 on this buyback (Swing deal). The contract shows the price for 04/01 should be the same price as shown for 03/01 & 05/01 (i.e. 04/01 price for deal # SA 413462 should be: 10,000 @ HSC_FLW+1HIGH GDP D.A. & 11,000 @ HSC_FLW+2HIGH GDP DA).

  Both files  provide similar data which is helpful to all of our support

  To  prepare both files I feel is a duplicate of my efforts .  Please let

I think I found the deal.  Deal # 157572 has meter 1372 attached to it.  It 
should be meter 1373.  The 10.000 is split between two meters, but all should 
be at meter 1373.  Can I change it?

 Should  I expect another swing ticket to be negotiated for July ?

Mary,

We have a 90,000 MMBtu/d first of the month nomination against our term
baseload contract and a 20,000 MMBtu/d spot swing contract for January. I
assume that the 105,000 MMBtu/d demand request would be allocated 90,000
MMBtu/d against the baseload contract and 15,000 MMBtu/d against the spot
swing contract.

Subject: Re: Equistar Deal Tickets

I need to have these tickets set up so the excess volumes will be priced 
correctly in Unify.  Currently Unify is adding all excess volume for each day 
and pricing the first 10,000 at a certain price and anything over 10,000 at a 
different price.  For example meter 1553 may have 5000 on the first, meter 
1384 may have 5000, and meter 1552 may have 5000.  Unify currently prices the 
first 10,000 at a certain price, and 5000 at a different price.  This is 
incorrect because none of the meters exceeded 10,000, each meter should be 
priced at the first tier level.  Robert needs to set up one additional sale 
ticket and one additional buyback ticket, but he will not schedule gas to 
these tickets.  Anita Luong will move the volumes to the correct ticket when 
she allocates the volumes each month.  Equistar receives manual invoices each 
month because they need to see the sale and the buyback on the same invoice, 
and they also need to have each meter invoiced separately.  I need to have 
these tickets set up to clean up my Unify draft invoices.

Thanks,
Tina Valadez

Kyle and I met with Bryan Hull this morning and we decided that we only need 
1 new sale ticket and 1 new buyback ticket set up.  The time period for both 
tickets should be July 1999 - Forward.

The pricing for the new sale ticket should be like tier 2 of Sitara #156337

I think the methanol plant is still down?

The buyback should apply for ANY volumes in July below their monthly nom of 
36,000/d until the plant comes back up.

and I have Mobil Oil meter 981040 that I pathed on the first for 30,000 that

I didn't path them since they are industrials and Aimee's notes told me to

1 new sale ticket and 1 new buyback ticket set up.  The time period for both

The pricing for the new sale ticket should be like tier 2 of Sitara #156337

SA 413462 is not the buyback, it's the swing ...

the first 10,000/d under SA 413462 should be HSC_FLW+1HIGH GDP D.A.
anything over 10,000/d should be HSC_FLW+2HIGH GDP DA

this is for all months from Oct00 to Sep01

Gary - We did not deliver gas to Phillips on Dec. 1.  Also, I am not sure if 
the plant was down, but we did not deliver to them on Dec. 2-4.  If you have

Phillips said we shorted them gas on December 1st so they pulled it on 
January 1.  Can we verify that we did not deliver 5,00 on Dec. 1?  If that is 
the case and this was a firm sale, we owe him some gas at Dec Index less 
(.045).  Which is bad!  Let me know what happened in Dec before I can put 
this deal out in Jan.

Its a monthly nom for 413447

you're right - the swing deal 413462 needs to be extended to match the term 
of 413447, as does the buyback 413472

Lee, 

On deal 413447 (Chevron @ Olefins), we have a flex nom of 6,000 to 
12,000/day.  Is this a monthly nom or daily nom?  Will we have a swing deal 
with them for the winter?  The current swing deal is for Oct only.  For Oct, 
they have pulled an average of 16,000/day.

Change in their safety net gas:

effective 3pm today - increase it from 9,000/d to 14,000/d, so total flow at 
HPL meter would be 24,000/d

effective 9am tomorrow 12/20/00, decrease safety-net gas down to 6,000/d, so 
total flow at HPL meter would be 16,000/d

 I spoke with Bob Dorcheus, Brandywine about this issue and he suggest you 
and he get together and agree on a 
  price because the gas flowed into the plant.

 This gas flowed without a nomination.

The volumes on meter #1266 for 7/1/00 and 7/31/00 are valid gas flow.  7/1/00 
volumes are carry over from June activity (meter was shut in a little after 
9:00 AM on 7/1/00).   7/31/00 volumes were caused by the plant bringing on 
the meter before 9:00 AM on 8/1/00.

If you have any questions please call.  36449.

I think I found the deal.  Deal # 157572 has meter 1372 attached to it.  It 
should be meter 1373.  The 10.000 is split between two meters, but all should 
be at meter 1373.  Can I change it?

I noticed the new October deals for Valero (414065, 414074, 414071) include 
both the base Index pricing and the swing Gas Daily pricing.  However, the 
old swing deals (148386, 148391, 148382) are still valid through October.   
Should these deals be effective for October?

Thanks for your help.

pricing on the base ticket and ignored the 9500 limit, because it's a good

Westvaco is a brand new company.  I have added March also, didn't know about 
that one.  Also, there will be one for Rohm & Haas, hopefully will be down in 
the next day or two.  And there will not be one for Bayer in April.

Phillips said we shorted them gas on December 1st so they pulled it on 
January 1.  Can we verify that we did not deliver 5,00 on Dec. 1?  If that is 
the case and this was a firm sale, we owe him some gas at Dec Index less 
(.045).  Which is bad!  Let me know what happened in Dec before I can put 
this deal out in Jan.

Daren - meter 1517 has a nom of 0/day for Jan.  It flowed about 5.400 on day 
1. This is a valid flow.  Could you please extend the deal from Dec. (deal # 
506192) or create a new one?  Thanks.

Robert,
I never saw the July Industrial spreadsheet.  This must be set up for 
August.  It was a file developed by Ken Seaman.
Thanks,  Pat

Subject: Industrials

When will the buybacks and swings be set up for July?  I am a little 
concerned with the long weekend coming up.  I believe that we agreed that 
these would be set up by the 3rd work day, which would be Friday the 7th.  
(Six days of flow.)  I definitely don't think that we should any later.  It 
would be great if this could be handled sooner, miimizing our economic impact.

Additionally, we need to get the Industrial spreadsheet up and running 
again.  This report is very beneficial to Gas Control, industrial traders and 
schedulers on call.

Let me know what you think.

Lee informed me today {7/12th}  that Global Octane has experience 
"operational" problems beginning last night and will be down until further 
notice.
 
  Note:  This outage is considered "Force Majeure"  thus, whatever flows 
during this time period should be allocated to the "term" deal.
 
 Lee was very specific toward this issue not being a buyback. 
 
 
Howard, Please forward this information to whomever need it in

   The only valid "Buyback" ticket for Meter #: 1373 is Sitara Ticket #: 
246408.  S. Ticket #: 156342 is an old ticket which was used to set up 
Buyback 
       ticket across Equistar's meters{1552,1384,1062,1553}. If  you recall 
this process was done to enable Client Services to automate Equistar
       allocation/billing. The project took place around April 2000 
production retroactive back to Jan. 1999.  The link to compute the buyback is 
set up 
       on S. ticket # 246408.

       Since Equistar has begun doing business via ENA, it was necessary to 
establish a "Buyback Ticket " on ENA's Matrix.
       Thus, to answer your question, yes there should only be one "buyback 
ticket" for meter #: 1373 on HPL  and ENA.

       ENA activity is kept whole and the swing is on HPL.

       I hope I have addressed all of your questions below however, I am 
available for follow up discussion if needed.
 
       It  has been a pleasure working with you. I learned a lot about the 
business while scheduling industrials and thanks for the opportunity.

Robert, 

There are three buy back tickets in Sitara for Equistar at mtr 1373.  Two for 
HPL and one under ENA.  Shouldn't we have only one buyback for each company?  
Also, how do you have the meter set up to allocate between the ENA contract 
and HPL contract?

For Mobil in March, beginning on March 21, HPL started delivering 30,000/d 
for MidCon (just like we did in Dec and Jan, and maybe in Feb too)

Check with Daren Farmer when you get ready to do the flash invoice on the 
first to confirm the MidCon volume amounts and dates

Thanks!!!!!

I spoke to Sabrae,  we are cumulatively balanced with PGE, cumulative and don't want to do anything volumetric at either meter.  The NNG OBA is being reconciled, and they are really hesitant/reluctant to balance current month.  Florida can be paid back 5M or more, it is being reconciled, but, Sabrae is okay with paying back.  This just in from Mark McCoy, the Oasis OBA is flat as of today's gas day.  That should hit the imb. report next week.

04/01 Price in Sitara for Deal 413462 shows HSC GDP DA for both tiers. Who should I contact to get price corrected to:
10,000/d HSC_FLW+1HIGH GDP DA
11,000/d HSC_FLW+2HIGH GDP DA
(i.e same as pre and post 04/01 prices shown for this deal in Sitara)

SA 413462 is not the buyback, it's the swing ...

the first 10,000/d under SA 413462 should be HSC_FLW+1HIGH GDP D.A.
anything over 10,000/d should be HSC_FLW+2HIGH GDP DA

this is for all months from Oct00 to Sep01

Please advise on the 04/01 price for sales deal #SA 413462 on this buyback (Swing deal). The contract shows the price for 04/01 should be the same price as shown for 03/01 & 05/01 (i.e. 04/01 price for deal # SA 413462 should be: 10,000 @ HSC_FLW+1HIGH GDP D.A. & 11,000 @ HSC_FLW+2HIGH GDP DA).

Subject: January Nominations at Shell Deer Park


Gary,

January 2001 nominations for gas delivery to Shell Deer Park are as follows:

Firm Baseload - 110,000 MMBtu/d
Spot Swing supply - 0 (zero)

Delivery of the above contract quantities is expected to be as follows:

  HPL-HP   HPL-E   HPL-S
 Firm 35,000 MMBtu/d 40,000 MMBtu/d 35,000 MMBtu/d

On or about January 7th we are currently planning on beginning our much
anticipated scheduled turnaround work. Natural gas demand is expected to
decrease with HPL's portion being 20,000 MMBtu/d coming primarily out of the
HP/E station. This will leave total demand at 90,000 MMBtu/d for the
remainder of the month.

Please let me know if you have any questions

Robert, 

Ken developed an industrial report before he left.  It can be found at 
o/logistics/kenseaman/industrialsmonthly/...  There is one file for each 
month of 2000.  I need you to update this for March.  This will need to be 
distributed to Gas Control, Logistics, and myself.  Let me know if you have 
any questions.

Thanks.   
Also, Rohm & Haas, meter 1506, is looking for 24.000 for Feb. instead of 
27.000.  They take the swing.  Would you like me to change the deal or keep 
it as is?

 Daren wanted me to make this request to you for an Equistar Buyback Ticket 
on Enron North America{ENA}.
 
 Equistar has nominated activity on ENA for June and July 2000 production.
 
 Settlement seems to think a Buyback ticket is necessary to properly account 
for Equistar's monthly activity.

requirements deal.

Daren - here are the Equistar #'s.  There should be a total of 65.000.  There 
is  a new deal per Janice at Equistar at meter 1373 effective 2/01.  I have 
not seen a deal for this.  Let me know if it is legitimate.  No volumes were 
added, just moved from meter to meter.  (Deal # 378904)  Thanks.
