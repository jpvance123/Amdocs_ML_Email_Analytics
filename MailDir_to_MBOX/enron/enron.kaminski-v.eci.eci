Hi Stinson, as per our discussion, which we will expand upon when we meet 
later today, my currently role in Hamachi is better characterize as 
combination of deal support (from the engineering perpsective), facilitating 
my work with Jean Mrha (via Erik Simpson) on the initial load forecast and 
general requirements document development.  None of this is technical by any 
means.  If anything, it is more like engineering consulting (from deal 
perspective) by EBS Research to John's group.  I will bring it up with John 
tomorrow night about bringing our technical guys on such road trips so that 
they can get involved with his group even though no optimization modeling 
work may need to be done. For this I will use Samer and/or Chonawee but we 
need to be certain that they are available on such on-call basis as stated 
below.  John is very clear and specific about who he ask to be at such 
meeting and when, etc.  Normally he does not want any deviations. So if we 
put someone on such jobs, they have to be able to travel on-call anywhere, 
any place. That is the time pressure he is working with.   

He want me to be the primary contact for such deal support effort. But I will 
ask to bring along our technical guys on such trips so that they are plugged 
in etc...
I will recommend this to John for the next deal that he is planning.

Ravi.

Hi  Vince, Krishna & I talked to this student while were at Sycamore 
Networks.  He appears to be very qualified for our EBS Analytics group. 
Sycamore has a professional services team that provides consulting on network 
optimization modeling, etc. They do this to push their products, etc....  One 
of the professional in that group highly recommended this student. We are 
currently working with the same professional at Sycamore to perform our 
intial network design analysis (since the deadline was today!).   I have 
arranged for the MIT student's visit to Houston along with the two Standford 
students this month. I have handed over the task of arranging such visits to 
Elisabeth Grant. She will arrange everything and charge our RC so that we can 
allocate to John Griebling later.  Stinson and I think that is the most 
effective way of doing this.

Regards,

Ravi.

Hi Krishan, Ravi,

I apologize for the delay in mailing the writeups -- some unforeseen
complications completely shot the last 1-1/2 day. I am attaching PDF
versions of:

 1. The first two chapters of my thesis, which should help
    get a sense of what we are trying to do.
 2. Two more technical modeling writeups for services I am
    attempting to model.

The writeups are, as I mentioned before, works in progress, and
incomplete, and therefore I apologize in advance for confusions
that might arise. I also request that you not circulate these widely
for obvious reasons.

Thanks very much,
Salal

Subject: EBS VaR Transaction Policy

Hey you guys,

We are trying to implement a 'VaR transaction' policy - and would like your 
opinion.

This is going to be tough - because I'm not sure we have implemented a 
similiar policy across any of our other 'books' - that is - we looking to 
bring in all the accrual/operational assets as well as the MTM stuff 
(lambdas). To have a real-live 'configuration' of the system.

If assets/routes/servers etc...are added - what is the impact on the 'value' 
of the system and what it's worth. 

John has attached a draft below - for your review and thoughts.

I can see how this works in a trading environment - when you actually know 
the VaR of your whole trading portfolio. However - I've not seen this done 
with a mixture of MTM & accrual assets. Add the spice of a 'operational 
system' valuation  - and this will be tough to quantify and model.

Step 1 - configure system and value it 
Step 2 - calculate a VaR on this. We will need to do some work here!
Step 3 - calculate the incremental VaR of new deals/amendements/reconfigs etc 
- tough....

See what you think?

B.

Here is a first rough draft of a "value @ risk" transaction policy.

I would like you to start looking at where we are going on the policy and get 
some early thinking going on limits for the V@R.  For example, should we 
effectively shut down all server relocations without approval,  or allow some 
level of MB of storage to be moved around or reconfigured?

I need some commercial and industry realism for this.  We may need Rick 
Paiste or your industry helpers (Marquardt, etc. to help us).

Barry,  Lou,  I need your input.

I see a remote possibility of a gain for Enron: it's in our interest to

Dear Sir:

 The Scientific computation group at the University of
 Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, has recently started to be very
 interested in the recent developments of the bandwidth
 market. We find that the specifics of the bandwidth market
 offer challenges from the modelling point
 of view.

 However, we have encountered difficulties when looking for
 data, and we were wondering if you could help us. Specifically
 we would like to know for a given city pair for the different
 existing type of lines ( e.g. OC3, OC12, OC48 .... )

1. What has been the spot lease prices (e.g. $/line-type/mile) for
        the past 12 months?

2. What is the price of the dark fiber for a given type of line?

3. What is the maintenance cost $/month ?
           (for the same lines, e.g. OC3, OC12, OC48, ...)

4. What is the upgrading cost for the different lines?
           (e.g. how much does it cost to upgrade)
                OC3  --> OC12
                OC3  --> OC48
                OC12 --> OC48

5. How long does it take to upgrade a line from a certain
        capacity to another (e.g. 1 month, 2 month, ...) ?



 We realize that some of these questions may ask for confidential
data, in that case we would really appreciate if an order of magnitude
was provided. I look forward to hearing from you.


Sincerely,


Yann d'Halluin

Hi Stinson, I have sent an e-mail to Martin to give him heads up on what to 
expect in terms of transition.  I have talked to Jim about this and we are in 
agreement on the following schedule for Martin.

First two week  Martin will just read up stuff and get up to speed. I have 
suggested some reading material. If you guys can do the same.

I'll set up a meeting for all of us with Jim.  Jim and I will draft a game 
plan document to outline major areas of work that we need to support from the 
traffic engineering perpective (this will involve our OR guys, Stinson and 
I).  Martin will be on Jim's team supporting general Network Planning 
(through this work I am doing right now for project Hamachi, I will support 
Jim on other similar initiatives) projects.  Martin will work with Jim and me 
on this.  Stinson, I will e-mail a draft of our game plan once I have 
something on paper.  After that we can distribute the document to Tom 
Gros/Jean Mrha (trading) and Ted Seitz for information.

Jeff,

I would like to invite you to an off-site meeting of John Griebling's 
organization
and the Research Group. 

Date:   April 27 - April 29
Location:  Breckenridge, Colorado


As you know, John Griebling is managing the network design and construction 
project
currently under way in EBS. The Research Group is actively involved in this 
effort
which requires advanced quantitative skills in the area of stochastic 
optimization and
stochastic processes (for modeling and forecasting Internet traffic flows).

The objective of this meeting is to develop common language and accomplish 
transfer 
of skills between the two groups, to facilitate cooperation on this project 
in the future.

We are also inviting to this off-site senior management of EBS and plan to 
have
on the agenda several presentations about strategic directions of EBS. The 
effort
of network design and construction currently under way is  unprecedented in 
terms
of its scope and complexity and it is important  for technical people, who 
often have
highly specialized technical skills, to understand the broad picture.

I would appreciate if you could join us for Friday afternoon (April 28) and
Saturday (April 29). I understand  that you have commitments on Thursday and 
Friday 
morning. We have reorganized the tentative agenda of the meeting to devote
Friday afternoon to more general topics.

Vince

Hi Stinson,

Giuseppe, Eric and I, arrive on Thusday night at 10pm. We'll try
to reserve rooms at the DoubleTree Hotel next to the Enron building.
Does Enron get special deals with this hotel? >>>GIUSEPPE, can you
please make the reservations?<<

1) SCHEDULE:

I leave on Friday at 5:25pm from the Houston/HOBBE(?) airport going to
Washington, DC. What time should I leave Enron?

Eric and Giuseppe leave later I think, around 8pm flying back to SFO.

2) MEETINGS

Giuseppe has prepared a 30-45min talk on IP pricing.

If possible, we would like to have a brainstorming session(s) with
your group  to discuss various technical issues, problem formulations
and research directions/results.

Other meetings with EBS and the trading group would be useful too.

 >>>GIUSEPPE, can you please call Stinson and see how we can optimize the
agenda and maximize the value of the visit. I am swamped today...<<<

I look forward to seeing you on Friday.

Talk to you soon!

Nick

Vince, both Matt and April think that this type of research would be 
value-additive to EBS.  I will be out all next week in a meeting with John 
Griebling and other on a deal that is being worked out.  I understand that 
you are following up with HR on all of our summer intern offers. Please make 
sure Palo is given an offer and that he will work with April and Matt (he did 
talk to Matt) on the topics that April and I suggested.

Regards,

Ravi.

Looks interesting.

I would guess that there is a TON of research available (from @Home, AOL, 
Roadrunner, Real, Microsoft, etc.) on Broadband's impact on the strategic 
value of web properties.  Compiling this would be very helpful.

Hi April & Matt, here is additional information on the summer intern that 
I've mentioned.

Matt, I know you know nothing about this! My discussion with April on the 
possible research topic let me (& April) to believe that you would provide 
great input on what the student can work on while he is here.

Stinson,

Thank you for your e-mail.  My phone number is (617) 492-9551.  

I graduated from Princeton University in 1996 (mathematics), and came 
straight to MIT for a
Ph.D. in Operations Management at the Sloan Schoolof Management.  In my first
three years I took all the required coursework in mathematics,
optimization, stochastic processes, etc., as well as a number of courses in
psychology (at MIT and Harvard).  I am working with Prof. Gabriel Bitran,
and I am interested in the mathematical modeling of service operations.  In
particular, I am interested in the interaction between customers and
companies (hence the interest in psychology).  The (tentative) title of my
PhD thesis is "Pricing Substitute Products on the Internet", and I am
sending you the summary which I sent to Tom Gros a few weeks ago that will
give you an idea of what this research is about.

Thanks again, and I'm looking forward to meeting you and your research
group next week.

Pricing Substitute Products on the Internet


Objective:

To develop new tools to decide pricing policies for goods and services sold
on
the internet.


Motivation:

This research is motivated by the fact that traditional choice and 
optimization
models are not appropriate for internet-related businesses.  The technological
innovations associated with the internet brought about an overload of
information
which inevitably affects the ways in which consumers make choices.
Furthermore,
companies have a great deal of influence on how much information consumers can
have access to.

The problem of pricing substitute products is an important strategic issue
faced
by internet companies.  Consumers usually search for generic products (e.g.
VCRs
or computers) without knowing exactly what they will buy.  Companies can show
different products and different prices to each consumer.  This type of
flexibility
was not available until the internet came about.

The problem of pricing substitute products is not unique to the internet.  The
methodology developed by this research should be transferable to a number of
other settings, such as pricing services.  Services are unique, and there are
many cases where customers will only buy one of many services offered by a
given company.  Our model will help companies decide which services to offer
to which customers and how much to charge for these services.


Research Strategy:

Our research strategy is to divide the pricing problem into two components
which can be combined to generate optimal pricing strategies.  These
components are choice models and optimization models.


Choice Models:

Choice models describe how customers make choices.  The management literature
draws on two main sources for these models: psychology and economics.  The
common approach in psychology models is to use what are called heuristic
elimination methods.  These methods consist of the elimination of options
based on the sequential elimination of features until only one choice
remains.
These methods tend to be very context-specific and do not lend themselves very
easily to mathematical analysis.  Economists focus on utility-maximing models
that are significantly more mathematically tractable than psychological
models.
The most common economic model of choice is the logit model.  The problem with
these types of models is that they are not very accurate reflections of how
consumer make choices on the internet.  The first step in our research will
be
to develop choice models that capture the interactions going on between
customers
and companies on the internet.

Optimization:

Traditionally, the optimization problem consists of maximizing revenue over a
certain planning horizon.  On the internet, the problem of maximizing revenue
still exists, but there is also a need to learn about customers.  Short term
profit is based on sales, but long term profit is based on how well you know
your customers and are able to retain them.  The optimization problem must
therefore include a short term component (sales) and a long term component
(learning).

Hi John, as per our discussion and e-mails, I am suggesting the following 
dates for the subject offsite:  April 14 & 15 th (Friday & Sat).  Place and 
agenda to follow once this date is nailed up.   The heads of each group will 
decide who will attend.  We would also invite Kevin Hannon, Scott Yeager, Tom 
Gros, Ted Seitz and Jean Mrha once the dates and agenda are agreed upon by 
the Technical folks.

As before, the idea is to introduce the two of the most technical groups 
within Enron and to exchange ideas and issues.  The Enron research team will 
provide trading and modeling presentations and the Optical Network 
Engineering team will present networking and components related topics.

Take away from the two days will be to provide John Griebling's group with 
better understanding about how the trading markets have developed in general 
and energy markets in particular via Enron (i.e.,  how the sausage was 
made!).  Likewise, John's group will provide us with better understanding of 
optical networking from a technical perspective.  Particularily, how EBS is 
planning to develop the Puplic Switched Optical Network (PSON) that John has 
'branded' our pooling point based network!

Please reply ASAP if these two days (April 14 & 15) will work.  Additionally, 
John, is the original suggestion to hold it in Scott Yeager's cabin somewhere 
up in Colorado mts. still holds?  If yes, I should probably let Scott know!  
If not, I'll try to find other places--any suggestions, anyone? 

Regards,

Ravi.

NETWORK WORLD FUSION FOCUS: DAVE KEARNS on NOVELL NETWARE
Today's Focus: Btrieve free ride ends
03/14/00

Dear Wincenty Kaminski,

Today's Focus: Btrieve free ride ends
---------------------------------------------------------------
By Dave Kearns

NetWare has shipped with Btrieve (originally a flat-file database
system, now grown into a full-fledged relational database system) since
the days of NetWare 2 some 12 years ago. Many independent software
vendors have relied on this and constructed their NetWare applications
to use the built-in facilities Btrieve afforded.

Originally licensed from its creator, Softcraft, Novell bought Btrieve
outright in the late =01+80s, then sold it off 10 years later to some of
the original developers, now incorporated as Pervasive Software.
Pervasive has, essentially, retired the Btrieve name in favor of
"Pervasive SQL 2000," a true relational database system which
nevertheless still purports to support applications written to the
Btrieve 6.x specification.

A major change has been introduced in NetWare 5.1, however. There is no
longer an unlimited-use version of the database included. Novell still
uses Btrieve technology for (among other things) its installed products
database (sys:system\products.dat is the file), but NetWare 5.1
includes only a two-user license for SQL 2000  enough for the
administrator to add new products and services, but not enough for any
Btrieve-based applications the network might be running.

There is an unlimited-use version of SQL 2000 included, but it=01,s an
evaluation version only. It will time out after 90 days. Full-use
licenses may be purchased from Pervasive Software (or your software
vendors may provide them), but unsuspecting network administrators
could be caught off-guard when applications stop working.

For the adventurous, there is an unlimited-use version of Btrieve 6.10
included with the NetWare 5.1 distribution. But Novell admits it hasn't
tested the software with NetWare 5.1, it may not work, and  the real
killer  most current applications (such as Computer Associates
ArcServe) require Btrieve 6.15.

Check the applications you're using before doing that upgrade to
NetWare 5.1, and calculate the additional costs of obtaining the
requisite number of SQL 2000 licenses. Then, decide if that's what you
want to do, or if switching to a different application is the better
choice.

SECURITY AND BUG PATCH ALERT

Dear Wincenty Kaminski,

Today's Focus: Bug Alert: Welcome
---------------------------------------------------------------
By Jason Meserve

Welcome to the Security and Bug Patch Alert newsletter!

Given the recent spate of high-profile denial-of-service and hack
attacks and the large number of people who have signed up for this
newsletter before this first edition has been even published, it is
clear that security is a major concern in the IT community  as it
should be.

With technology now being looked upon as a profit rather than cost
center, IT departments face more pressure to keep critical systems up
and running  as well as secure. No chief information officer or network
manager wants to have to tell the CEO that their e-commerce site has
been broken into and customer credit card data copied. Stories like that
tend to stick in a potential customer=01,s mind more than an expensive
Super Bowl ad.

It=01,s hard enough to keep up with the latest new technologies, never mind
latest security patch for your operating system or e-commerce
application. But we=01,re here to help.

Once a week we=01,ll publish a list of patches and alerts from all the
major vendors and security organizations with links to the source. We=01,ll
also provide other (hopefully) useful resources for the security-
conscious IT manager.

Comments and suggestions are always welcome! Send mail to
jmeserve@nww.com.


Now on with the latest patches and alerts:

NETWORK WORLD FUSION FOCUS: MIKE JUDE and NANCY MEACHIM
on APPLICATION SERVICE PROVIDERS
Today's focus: Full circle: ASPs the new Big Blue?
03/15/00

Dear Wincenty Kaminski,

Today's focus: Full circle: ASPs the new=20
Big Blue?
---------------------------------------------
By Mike Jude and Nancy Meachim

The terms =01&ASP=018 and =01&IBM=018 may have more in common than being th=
ree-
letter acronyms.

Remember Big Blue of the early =01+60s? The vision, then, was centralized
computing. Mainframe computers hosted complex, expensive applications
that end users accessed via dumb terminals. IT infrastructure,
especially memory, was expensive and needed to be controlled. With
computing resources centralized, IBM reasoned, they were easier to
maintain.

Of course, IBM got it wrong, in that computers became a cheap commodity.
And users weren=01,t happy simply using dumb terminals. They wanted a
bigger share in all that technology offered. So, as memory prices fell,
so did the idea of central control. Dumb terminals were transformed into
intelligent desktop machines that could store applications and data. The
glass house populated by white-smocked technicians went out of fashion.

Looking back on those times, many of us would shake our heads and wonder
how IBM could have been so wrong. But maybe Big Blue wasn=01,t so far off.
Thanks to the advent of application service providers, centralized
computing is making a comeback. ASPs offer centralized application
management.

The market started as a way to offer the benefits of Server
Advertisement Protocol and other complex enterprise resource planning
software to small companies or companies with less technical savvy. But
ASPs now host all kinds of applications, including small, multilicensed
programs whose images are downloaded to end users on demand. But, the
principle remains the same: Central control makes support much more
efficient and usually cheaper. How about that, IBM?

To be fair, the dynamics of an ASP are very different from old
centralized mainframe operations. An ASP doesn=01,t just host and support
an application for general distribution over an in-house proprietary
network. Unlike the IBM vision, an ASP is very dependent on network
service. It is also very sensitive to service levels. In the =01+60s, if
the mainframe let you down, you ended up twiddling your thumbs for an
hour or so, and your only recourse was that white-smocked fellow.
Nowadays, users start to scream if service is interrupted for even a
minute. And woe to the ASP who brings down a customer operation. The
world of the ASP is much more complex than that of the old =01+60s shop.

However, if one could magically transport a computer user from the =01+60s
to the wonderful new 2000s, would it seem all that different to him? In
an ideal ASP world, a la Scott McNealy=01,s vision, users would sit down
at a semidumb terminal, download the application du jour, and start
working. What did the =01+60s user do? Kind of the same thing!

So you are probably wondering, what is the point? Just this: IBM=01,s
problem was leaving the customer out of the equation. And look what
happened. Customers rebelled. They didn=01,t buy IBM=01,s spiel. It became
the =01&in=018 thing to hate IBM. Why? Because the guys in white smocks
couldn=01,t spell service and didn=01,t care about customers.

To be successful, ASPs need to learn from the past. They need to tattoo
service on the forehead of each of their employees. There are too many
choices, today, for customers to put up with inferior service. That=01,s
one big difference from the =01+60s. Customers now can literally choose
any service provider in the world. Just being big doesn=01,t cut it these
days.

Dear Rex,

I believe there might be a few additions to this core group.  I have spoken 
with Sherron Watkins and she is handling the storage side of the deal from 
product development perspective (John Bloomer's team) and so she would need 
to be a part of this core group.  I am trying to determine who else is 
involved with Storage within EBS so that we don't replicate our efforts.  I 
am hoping that after tomorrow's meeting we will have a better picture of how 
to go forward on this project.  Please let me know if you need any further 
information regarding this project.  Thank you very much for your interest 
and I look forward to meeting you in the near future.

Sincerely,

Shalesh Ganjoo

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Stinson just pointed out that I forgot to mention that the meeting is 
scheduled
for tomorrow (10th of March 2000) between 2:30 PM and 4:30 PM.  It may seem 
like
a very short notice; however, we (Mark, Mary, Kara, Mike, Virawan and myself)

NETWORK WORLD FUSION FOCUS: PHIL HOCHMUTH
on LINUX
Today's focus: Will Linux be a hit or miss on the corporate desktop?
03/15/00

Dear Wincenty Kaminski,

Today's focus: Will Linux be a hit or miss=20
on the corporate desktop?
---------------------------------------------
By Phil Hochmuth

So far this year, the buzz about Linux in enterprise networks has
focused on servers and embedded systems, with the growth of Linux
severs being most heralded. According to IDC, a research firm based in
Framingham, Mass., Linux was the fastest-growing server operating
system last year, with a 93% growth rate over the year before. Linux
was the second most-shipped operating system in 1999 after Windows NT,
capturing 24% of new licenses shipped.

As for the embedded market, Linux has emerged as an ideal platform for
network appliances, because the system can be modified to handle
specialized, dedicated tasks very well. Companies such as Cobalt
Networks, Picazo and Progressive Systems have announced Linux-based
appliances, ranging from Web servers to PBXs to firewalls.

But what of the open source hacker=01,s dream of =01&Linux on every desktop=
?=018

Sure, Linux on the desktop has become more accessible than ever, with
colorful, shrink-wrapped boxes of Caldera, Red Hat and Corel Linux now
available at places like CompUSA. However, analysts have said that
Linux=01,s growth in the enterprise will be limited to the macro and micro
areas of network servers and embedded operating systems.

According to IDC, Linux currently runs on only 4% of U.S. desktops. The
hold Microsoft Windows has on the desktop market will remain strong,
analysts say, despite such factors as Microsoft=01,s antitrust problems
and the surging popularity of Linux.

Even some Linux executives are skeptical of their product=01,s desktop
future. Recently, SuSE CEO Roland Dyroff downplayed Linux=01,s future on
desktops. Dyroff said, =01&given the lack of applications available, we
really can't claim it as being competitive on the desktop yet.=018

A recent survey by Survey.com gives more hope for Linux desktops.
According to the survey of 1,640 enterprise network managers, open
source operating systems are used on 10% of desktops, with the number
jumping to a surprising 23% of enterprise desktops by 2002.

Despite the mix of numbers being thrown around, two important factors
that will determine the success of Linux as an enterprise client
desktop are: a standardized, easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI)
and available applications.

One company that is working to make Linux more user friendly is Palo
Alto-based Eazel, which is designing a next-generation file management
system and user interface to run on top of the Linux kernel. According
to Eazel=01,s Web site, the company=01,s goal is to bring Linux to the mass=
es
and =01&do it in a way that appeals to today's Linux users and to mere
mortals.=018

The company was founded by a group of former Apple executives, and is
allied with the Gnome project, which has been doing extensive Linux
desktop environment development for several years. Eazel is due to have
a product out by the middle of this year. With an intuitive, icon-based
file management environment, Eazel is hoping its user interface will be
an improvement over the two current Linux GUIs, Gnome and KDE, and will
help standardized the look and feel of Linux for =01&regular=018 users. For
enterprise mangers who have already embraced Linux on the server side,
this development will be worth keeping an eye on.

On the applications side, several office productivity suites have been
available for some time, such as Sun=01,s StarOffice suite and KOffice for
the KDE desktop. Corel has also ported its office products, such as
WordPerfect, over to Linux to complement its own distribution of the
operating system. While there have been recent rumors (started by Linux
Care Vice President Arthur Tyde) that Microsoft is working on a port of
MS Office to Linux, Microsoft officials deny this.

While Linux may never supplant Windows as the industry-standard desktop,
there should be plenty of opportunity for Linux PCs in enterprise nets
in the future.

Kevin,

I would like to invite you to an off-site meeting of John Griebling's 
organization
and the Research Group. 

Date:   April 27 - April 29
Location:  Breckenridge, Colorado


As you know, John Griebling is managing the network design and construction 
project
currently under way in EBS. The Research Group is actively involved in this 
effort
which requires advanced quantitative skills in the area of stochastic 
optimization and
stochastic processes (for modeling and forecasting Internet traffic flows).

The objective of this meeting is to develop common language and accomplish 
transfer 
of skills between the two groups, to facilitate cooperation on this project 
in the future.

We are inviting Ken Rice and Joe Hirko to this meeting. We would appreciate 
if you could
speak, together with Joe and Ken, on strategic directions of EBS. It is 
important for a group
of technical people, with relatively specialized technical skills, to 
understand the big picture.

I am attaching the preliminary agenda for this meeting.

Vince

FYI: Several errors like 'brokering' in the report but given the fact that 
the guy had no clue what Enron does or companies like it do, this came out 
okay.  In all of the PR group's marketing effort, Enron as a Market-Maker is 
the message.

Ravi.

Enron seeks to broker storage deals between users, SSPs

By LUCAS MEARIAN 

While technology service providers have long been talking about data storage 
as a utility that should be sold in the open marketplace like electricity or 
natural gas, little has been done to pool market resources in order to hawk 
surplus disk-array capacity. 
But that's exactly what a subsidiary of Houston-based energy and 
communications conglomerate Enron Corp. is doing by launching a 
business-to-business exchange that it said will seek to match spare capacity 
owned by storage service providers (SSP) with corporate users who want to be 
able to quickly scale up and down the amounts of storage they have available. 
Enron Broadband Services this week announced that it has already signed a 
deal with Waltham, Mass.-based StorageNetworks Inc. and is negotiating 
similar agreements with at least six other SSPs. If successful, analysts 
said, Enron's business proposition could go far toward generating a set of 
operating standards for the emerging SSP business. 
"It's a market with mix of small and large players and companies that define 
their roles differently," said Ken Weilerstein, an analyst at Gartner Group 
Inc. in Stamford, Conn. Enron's plan also could help enterprise-level users 
get additional benefits along with the storage capacity they're renting, such 
as security and disaster recovery support, he added. 
Ravi Thuraisingham, director of global bandwidth risk management at Enron 
Broadband Services, said the new offering won't include additional security 
features. But Enron does plan to standardize on a set of SSP services and 
bundle them with disaster recovery and communications bandwidth capabilities, 
he said. 
Initially, Enron -- which had total revenue of $101 billion last year -- 
expects to charge users monthly fees of $25 to $55 per gigabyte of managed 
storage, depending on market conditions and the length of time a company 
expects to need the capacity. "We're there to try to discover a market 
clearing price," said Thuraisingham, adding that the service is tentatively 
due to go online in the third quarter. 
Enron said it has already signed Best Buy Co., one of the leading retailers 
of consumer electronics, computers and software in the U.S., to buy the 
storage capacity it needs to support a customer relationship management 
application through StorageNetworks. Connecting users such as Best Buy to 
available storage could take anywhere from three days to three months, 
according to Thuraisingham. 
Under Enron's plan, storage capacity owned by participating SSPs will be 
connected to an existing network of switching hubs through which the company 
currently trades telecommunications bandwidth. Enron said it has 18 switching 
centers, or "pooling points," in the U.S., and another seven overseas. 
At first, the company plans to focus its attention on SSPs in Boston and 
other metropitan areas where the necessary networking plumbing can be easily 
installed. But even there, Thuraisingham said, Enron is "pretty much in the 
initial stages of getting SSPs up to speed on what the market is about." 
Enron has been managing online trades of telecommunications bandwidth since 
the spring of 1999. Later that year, it also launched a Web site called 
EnronOnline that oversees the trading of natural gas, electricity and other 
commodities. That quickly became the world's largest e-commerce site and is 
now said to be processing more than $1 billion worth of transactions daily.

		 Subject: Logistics for the Sycamore meeting in Chelmsford next week



Hi Phil, here are the logistical details for our meetings next week at
Sycamore in Chelmsord (10 Elizabeth Drive).

Hotel:  Double Tree in Lowell.
Transportation:  Everyone should fly into Boston Monday afternoon/early
evening. Chelmsford is about 40-45 minutes from the airport, more in
traffic.  I can arrange for a car service from the Airport to the Restaurant
Monday night for everyone, and have the limo wait for you until we are

Hi Dorn & John, as you discovered recently, I am still 'officially' in Vince 
Kaminski's group (my original Enron Corp. group). This holds true for Shalesh 
Ganjoo as well.  I did not explicitly pick Dorn or John as reviewers thinking 
that they will show up automatically as a result of my assumed reporting 
structure.  

So, Vince has agreed to 'host' the review in his group and proceed to 
transfer me over to EBS officially when this quarter is overs (Apprently that 
was scheduled to be automatic).  In the mean time, Vasant, Stinson or Vince 
would like to get a e-mail from either Dorn or John regarding my performance 
from their perspective for consideration as soon as possible.

I had plan on being on vacation starting tomorrow and have made arrangement 
with my family already.  Since I am not reviewing Shalesh directly (since he 
is in Research under Stionson), I am assuming I don't have to attend the 
review meetin tommorrow. I'll be on the road starting in the morning.  If I 
change this, I am told at home, that I will be in the market for another 
family!  I can phone in if that is okay. 

Kayla, could you page me with the details?

Regards,


Ravi.

Kevin,

I have followed up on your request to identify a potential hire
from Akamai (a person familiar with their technology). We can start 
discussions with the targets in a few days.

Please, let me know which unit in EBS is a potential hiring agent.
If it's Research, who inside EBS can sponsor  this position? We have to 
discuss
the responsibilities and job description.

Hi Vince, I talked to Tom Gros today and metioned our desire to estabilish a 
strategic relationship with Nick Bambos and his research effort.  Tom is very 
excited about the idea and was willing to cut the check.  I suggested that we 
have more of a strategic relationship in mine (Enron / Stanford) and he 
agreed to that as well.  Tom mentioned that Greg Whalley was interested in 
estabilishing such a relationship.  Vince, could you follow this up and 
ground this? If you need any help in doing the leg work, I'll happy to do 
that.  

Tom is excited about EBS research's role to support all of EBS including 
bandwidth trading. He seems very interested in being our sponsor on the EBS 
side. That would be very beneficial to us since he is involved in all senior 
management decision through Kevin Hannon.  Vince, I would suggest that you 
try to setup a meeting with Kevin Hannon and Tom to discuss this further.  
Tom is also very interested in the New Product development effort that Larry 
and I have been kicking around for some time.  He wanted us to sit back and 
think of structured products with better margins that Blend & Extend that 
they are selling. He wanted to know now much more resource that we need in 
that front.  For this, I would like to get someone like Meera Natarajan. She 
is an originator currently working in EES and have talked to Zimin and 
Stinson. She is sufficiently analytical with commercial mind set to help with 
new product ideas and to ground them.

Regards,

Ravi.

I have two things biting me. 

First is time.  I need to turn a draft for Hannon and Rice ASAP.  So,  the 
value of a deliberative approach to coming up with a V@R policy will quickly 
evaporate if we take 2 weeks to study what the policy should say.

Second,  I have a unique situation.  Our concept of V@R is really unlike the 
rest of Enron's today.  What happens today is that network engineers 
unilaterally make decisions about deployment, configuration and other matters 
which effect the longs and shorts of our asset/contract portfolio that they 
view strictly from a network operating standpoint.  

A good example was a decision to move our primary TeraPop (three large 
servers storing 165 gigabytes each) from Portland to LA.  The servers are 
already in place and purchased,  so no capital was involved.  But the 
decision has huge ramifications on the future LA/New York and other Bandwidth 
usage, and that cost money.  Now it could be that the LA/New York cost is 
cheaper than the Portland/New York cost,  the whole point is no one knows.   
What our "value-at-risk" policy attempt to corral is these types of decisions 
and put them into the hands of the risk management group,  where the decision 
will be made with at least some economic work behind it.

I really see the EBS V@R policy to be misnamed,  since we don't really have 
the math done to calc V@R.  It really is a volumetric-based control policy 
that says you can't make network changes over XX amount of Megabytes (a 
storage measure)  or OC-3 equivalents (a bandwidth measure) without Risk 
Management making or approving the decision.  I do believe that with 
Research's help,  we can in time actually calculate the V@R impact of such 
decisions.  At that time,  the policy should be modified to set metrics based 
on the V@R calculations.

So if you have an open enough mind to let us co-op your word for a minute,  
we need to start turning the minds of the network industry people into 
thinking about their decisions as having value effects.  Said directly,  
Kevin Hannon has given me authority to write a policy to move control over 
significant network changes from the field to the trading floor,  and I am 
going to issue something NOW to effectuate that......

So... I really want your views on what we are doing,  but thought you needed 
some flavor and an sense of the urgency.  If you can weigh in,  do so 
quickly.....

Barry,
Conceptually, I see no reason that a process like this can not be 
implemented.  In some way we have attempted to do so through the Enron Corp 
Transaction Approval Process (TAP).  I have forwarded to John a copy of this, 
along with the Risk Management Policy.   I'll let him share with you if ok (I 
really don't want to act as the firm's in-house Kinko's!!).   We have taken 
the first step and done poorly on follow-up steps to create a very easy to 
follow process for anything other than direct funded capital.  However, some 
process around a greater number of assets/deals is better than none.   I 
agree that I have not seen a really good fully baked one implemented, but I 
think it is wrong not to try.  

The only concerns I have is that, given that we want to have "standard" 
metrics and approval processes around the firm, EBS creates a process/metric 
which is complementary to and integrates with processes/metrics that the 
other Business Units are subjected to .
Ted

Subject: EBS VaR Transaction Policy

Hey you guys,

We are trying to implement a 'VaR transaction' policy - and would like your 
opinion.

This is going to be tough - because I'm not sure we have implemented a 
similiar policy across any of our other 'books' - that is - we looking to 
bring in all the accrual/operational assets as well as the MTM stuff 
(lambdas). To have a real-live 'configuration' of the system.

If assets/routes/servers etc...are added - what is the impact on the 'value' 
of the system and what it's worth. 

John has attached a draft below - for your review and thoughts.

I can see how this works in a trading environment - when you actually know 
the VaR of your whole trading portfolio. However - I've not seen this done 
with a mixture of MTM & accrual assets. Add the spice of a 'operational 
system' valuation  - and this will be tough to quantify and model.

Step 1 - configure system and value it 
Step 2 - calculate a VaR on this. We will need to do some work here!
Step 3 - calculate the incremental VaR of new deals/amendements/reconfigs etc 
- tough....

See what you think?

B.

Here is a first rough draft of a "value @ risk" transaction policy.

I would like you to start looking at where we are going on the policy and get 
some early thinking going on limits for the V@R.  For example, should we 
effectively shut down all server relocations without approval,  or allow some 
level of MB of storage to be moved around or reconfigured?

I need some commercial and industry realism for this.  We may need Rick 
Paiste or your industry helpers (Marquardt, etc. to help us).

Barry,  Lou,  I need your input.

We are pleased to announce that Stewart Seeligson has joined EBS relocating 
after more than 4 years from Enron Europe in London.  Stewart started with 
Enron nearly six years ago as an associate in ECT in Houston.  In Europe, 
Stewart was successful in playing a key role in Sutton Bridge, originating a 
number of highly structured transactions including the Eastern deals and more 
recently co-led Enron's commercial activities in Spain especially the 
development of a 1200 MW CCGT which is expected to begin construction later 
this year.

Stewart will assist in developing, managing and leading several of our more 
complicated mission critical commercial transactions.  In particular, Stewart 
will focus on those transactions which require multiple functions across EBS, 
a role Stewart excelled in at Enron Europe.  Stewart will report directly to 
Ken Rice as a Vice President, but will work directly with each of the 
commercial business unit leaders on a project specific basis.

Please welcome Stewart to the EBS team.

Hi Stinson, Shales' initial in road to EBS was through David Cox (after 
Vince's suggest to talk to David, I think).  What Shalesh did at the time was 
to put a four page concept on trading storage as a commodity in the new 
networked world.  He has keen interest in such an idea and has done some 
work. He will be a good fit unless that person has to be in EBS under Jean 
etc.... If so, we are not ready to let Shalesh go!  He can support that 
effort, but I need him to get the supply & demand work in real-time user 
friendly form for Jean's traders before Shalesh ventures onto something 
else.  I did promising that I will get him involved in some juicy stuff like 
new product/deals etc.... This may be his non-it stuff that he can do.....

What do you think?

Stinson,

I have forwarded to you a phone message from John Blumer (EBS). John left a
message on my voice mail I did not quite understand.

Please, give him a call and see if we can help him. Maybe, we should just
refer the message to Louise Kitchen and let her handle John.

Sorry to burden you with this. Given time difference, it's difficult to
handle it from here.

I hope the operation went well without any complications.

Vince

Dale,
Omer Muften (with the structuring group) asked us to help in evaluating the 
different options embedded in the Storm contract. However, he promised to 
provide us with the forward curves regarding the dark fiber (in Europe). We 
are still waiting to receive those. In addition, it seems that the deal 
structure has "just" changed. I will give you a call to discuss.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Stinson just pointed out that I forgot to mention that the meeting is 
scheduled for tomorrow (10th of March 2000) between 2:30 PM and 4:30 PM.  It 
may seem like a very short notice; however, we (Mark, Mary, Kara, Mike, 
Virawan and myself) had initially set this time and date last week.  In the 
future I will make sure that everyone is notified early.  Sorry for any 
inconvenience this may have caused.  Thank you.

Hello all:

Appended below you'll find a summary of ideas that people have contributed
since we at CAIDA began to get the metrics wg started.  Some of this
material has already appeared on the metrics mailing list, the older
material comes from personal emails.  I'm posting it again to give us all
some more ideas to think about.

For those who are able to attend the WG meeting in San Jose this Thursday
(2 Mar), I'd like to spend time in the morning getting to know about
attendees interests and experience in making Internet measurements.
I suggest that a good way to do this would be to have each group give a
short (10 minutes, <= 5 slides) presentation of their measurement work.
That should allow us to make a longer list of metrics to discuss in
more detail for the rest of the meeting.

Comments please!  I'll send out a revised/updated agenda late tomorrow.

Cheers, Nevil

PS: We now have about 40 people on the mailing list.  Please copy all
    further 'metrics' email to the list so that we can all see it.
    (We now have a web-searchable list archive in place at
    http://www.caida.org/archives/metrics/ )

Several people have expressed interest in passive measurements
on TCP streams.  One simple example is keeping track of DNS response times.

Daniel McRobb offered the following ..

Nevil Brownlee comments that he's also very interested in
developing the RTFM meter as a platform for more general measurements.
Two areas seem interesting (apart from getting more information
from TCP streams):~
 + QoS / DifServ performance
      (what metrics do we need to characterise this?)
 + IPSEC (what metrics will still be useful when we can't
      look at port numbers?  what kinds of traffic can still be
      identified?)

This would provide a general way of determining where packets came from,
not just a tool for tracing DoS attacks.

Gentlemen:

Amit is a former MIT Sloan student whose research was sponsored by a program 
set up by Tom Gros to learn more about bandwidth pricing and market effects.  
We worked with him quite a bit for a while, as did Vince Kaminski and Stinson 
Gibner, on this project.  Well, he has finally graduated and is in the 
process of having his thesis published.  He has offered to come down to 
present his findings to anyone interested, so I am inquiring as to your level 
of interest in order to schedule a meeting, if appropriate.

Below is a short description of his work.  Please let me know your thoughts 
and if you have any questions.

Thanks, Jay.

Hi Jay,

As per our discussion this morning, will be terrific to come on down to talk 
about the results of my Thesis related to pricing & risk management of 
forward contracts on bandwidths.  Thanks to the support from Enron for this 
work !


Here's a brief description.


We addressed the problem of pricing and risk managment of forward contracts 
on bandwidth under uncertain future available supply.  This exposes the 
seller to both the risk of perishability as well as the risk of 
overcommitments.  We consider a variety of selling strategies to map 
commitment risk, and show how forward pricing varies over time under these 
strategies. The managerial insights into dynamic forward pricing are neat !  
Have several graphs from simulations, and several math proofs.

There are two technical pricing papers from this thesis, now submitted for 
publication.  It will be great to share this knowledge with Enron, thanks to 
your support for the work, and also discuss how the results may be mapped 
with real-life, possible modifications, and finally how they may be 
programmed and used.

Let me know your thoughts and interest level - maybe someone from Vince's 
group as well ?  I can make the talk as technical as you want, depending on 
the audience. At its core, it is Math-heavy, but the insights can easily be 
translated to a high-managerial level view, a more detailed trader-level 
view, or a super-detailed research level view.

Cheers,

-Amit

Colleagues,

Professor Gabriel Bitran of MIT will be visiting Enron on Wednesday 9 August. 
He
will be here all morning. He would like to meet and discuss with us some of 
the
issues and problems that are of interest to EBS. The goal is to suggest a
research subject for one of his students that is of interest to EBS and its
business. Please let me know if you are interested in meeting him. I suggest
having one open meeting (perhaps one hour) in which all of us can sit down and
discuss the issues with him.

-Samer

Stinson,

Let's bring up these two ideas at the meeting with John Bloomer
(to discuss the other product ideas).

Vince

If it's new EBS products you're after, how about a real-time bandwidth swing 
contract with automatic exercise?  The customer pays for the minimum 
(baseload) bandwidth they need for their (say) videoconference, with a 
premium on top that automatically buys them extra bandwidth as it becomes 
available from the system.  They are guaranteed a minimum quality they can 
live with, and (more than likely) they get improved quality much of the time 
for a bargain price.

We get to charge for the use of bandwidth that would otherwise be idle.

Steve,

I think personally it's a great idea, though my son, who studies
computer science, poured a bucket of icy water on me. Computers
are becoming very cheap and most companies have already a lot of 
spare capacity on their systems.

But we can always try. We shall take this idea, to the person in EBS 
responsible for the 
new products and ask him to talk directly to you to discuss the details.

EBS is dying to come up with some new products.

Vince, Stinson

Have any investigations been made of the issue of trading (spare) processing 
power?  Such a proposal would have natural synergies with the bandwidth 
business, since the jobs to be processed would need to be piped around, as 
would their results.

Obvious technical and legal problems are:
1.  Standardisation.  (Java?)
2. Security and confidentiality.

Just a thought that's been buzzing around my head for a while.

Hi Stinson,

     A colleague of mine - Professor Nalin Kulatilaka of Boston University - 
is interested in visiting Enron to give a talk on work he is doing in the 
broadband area.

     Please see the forwarded emails for further information and available 
dates.

     Can you let me know if we can give him a forum at one of our Thursday 
Research lunches or a Friday brown bag lunch?

Thanks,
Iris

Hi Iris

I have two different hats to wear in talking to Enron.  One is as a
financial economist.  The other as the Director of the newly formed "Global
Mobility Innovation Initiative (GMII) -- this is the research project
funded by Lucent, involving BU, LBS, and INSEAD, to study various aspects
of the mobile Internet (read 3G).

On the former I am working with a couple of Ph.D. students in understanding

(a) details of how having physical supply (inventory) can be used by a
market maker.   This is a problem that has been studies in the context of
specialists inventory in the stock market but I think really interesting in
the way Enron does it in some of the newer markets like bandwidth.    I
think this is a big issue in lighting up all the dark fiber  that is in the
ground.

(b) how Enron is disciplining the internal decision making process with
market.  This is in many ways the critical aspect of  real options that
most finance people miss -- having options is one thing but exercising them
and realizing their value is another.  All of the incomplete contracting,
asymmetric information, and incentive issues are ignored in real options
valuation models.  But they are real in practice.  My impression is Enron's
real success is in putting place an organization that is able to mitigate
these problems by imposing a market disciplining.

(c) how Enron manages the various books that involve physicals, financials,
credit etc.  This is specially important when many of the real assets have
options features and therefore, include non-linear risk profiles.  The
story of gas  is pretty well understood but not many of the others markets
Enron has been moving into over the last few years.

On the GMII front, I think that some interesting opportunities arise when
you think of the spectrum in a way similar to that of dark fiber.   I am
working with several people at Lucent on this issue.  I think it would be
wonderful to engage in a conversation with Enron and Lucent folks in the room.

I can do a lunch time talk on any of these issues.  Perhaps we can discuss
some of these over a conference call. Clearly, having Vince Kaminski in the
room would be very important to me.

As for schedules, the first 3 weeks of April are horrible.  April 26/27,
May 3/4 are good for me.

Regards

Nalin

April, I'll be in Colorado until March 10.  We can schedule next week or you 
can talk to him directly.  Currently, EBS research is helping Kevin Howard 
and Scott Yeager (indirectly via Kevin) in their effort to assess the value 
of an eyeball.  Paulo's research will complement this effort.  The research 
that Paulo will perform for you will be part of a bigger picture work that 
Kevin Howard has aked Stinson and I to support.    You can call me on my cell 
713-516-5440 while I am in CO.

April:

Paulo is the MIT Ph.D. student who talked with you by phone a couple of weeks 
ago.   He is interested in trying to better define what type of project he 
might do over the summer with EBS.   Recall that he is interested in the 
psychological/customer behavior issues related to web commerce as compared to 
traditional commerce.   Perhaps the easiest way to proceed would be for you, 
me, Ravi, and Vince to get together to discuss possibilities.   We could then 
include Paulo by phone to get his initial reactions/suggestions.   After an 
initial assessment, we could then plan on another visit for Paulo.

Please let me know what your schedule would allow.

thanks,

Stinson -

Thanks for your reply.  I just got a call from someone at Enron today about
Summer employment, so I think a meeting with April and your group would be
very appropriate at this time.

I am available to meet with April  any day this coming month, except March
9, March 10, and March 17-30.

Please let me know what works for you.

Thanks again,

Vince, Stinson, looks like just me and Jim Irvine attending this one may 
suffice since this is a working group meeting.  As the note describes below, 
there will be a separate trip for you guys and me to determine long-term 
involvement, etc... Let me now when to schedule.

Vince and Stinson may want to
wait until KC Claffy or I can visit Portland, or have several Enron
reps visit San Diego for demos and related discussions.

Ravi,

Hi, Amy forwarded me your note.  Since Thursday is the kick off
discussions for the new working group, it might not be the ideal venue
for Enron to get acquainted with CAIDA.  Vince and Stinson may want to
wait until KC Claffy or I can visit Portland, or have several Enron
reps visit San Diego for demos and related discussions.

We have been talking to Stan Hanks for some time about Enron's
interests in passive measurement and are in the process of implementing
some of the performance features in CoralReef that he has described as
relevant to Enron.  Examples of existing CoralReef analyses on OC3/12
links can be found at:

 https://anala.caida.org/CoralReef/Demos/cerfnet/link/
 (real-time)

 https://anala.caida.org/AIX/
 (post-processed traces)

We are also working to better tune the skitter tool for reachability
analysis and for use by providers, an example of some existing
analyses can be found at

http://www.caida.org/Tools/Skitter/Summary/sjc.skitter.caida.org/20000227/

For end-to-end measurements, including those relating to service level
guarantees, we are working to make skping and sktrace more useful to
providers and their NOC personnel, see

 http://www.caida.org/Tools/Skitter/skping/

Another tool of relevance to providers is our cflowd which analyzes
flow export data from Cisco routers, see
http://www.caida.org/Tools/cflowd/.

We would appreciate the opportunity to talk with Enron personnel about
how to make these tools more relevant and useful to your needs,
however, it is doubtful that we will have time to discuss specific
tools on Thursday.

We look forward to meeting you soon!

Take care,

Tracie Monk
Director, CAIDA

   B.  WG Charters, Meeting on 2 Mar 00


I believe that we should instead run a single CAIDA Working Group
on 'Network Metrics,' rather than the two proposed earlier.  My draft
of its charter is appended below.  It focuses on producing educational
material about network measurement, and on developing new metrics - these
were the two areas of greatest interest amongst the CAIDA members.

The WG co-chairs are
  Sue Moon (SprintLabs) and Brett Watson (MFN/Abovenet)

You are invited to attend the first WG meeting.
The agenda is as follows ..

   Agenda for CAIDA WG meeting on: Thursday 2 Mar 00
                                   -----------------
   10 am - 4 pm, AboveNet, Downtown SJC (see below for details)
   ------------            ------------

   1. Review WG Charter
      - Is it reasonable as set out in the draft?
      - What should be removed or added?

   2. Work through revised charter in detail
      - Identify the work required for each part
      - Determine who's willing to work on it
      - Attempt to determine delivery times

   3. Discussion of new metrics
      - First attempt at making a list of metrics to be considered

   4. Anything else ?

Location: AboveNet is located in the Knight-Ridder Building,
attached to the Fairmont Hotel complex.  The address is

  50 W. San Fernando St.
  San Jose, CA  95113

RSVP: To help us with organising the meeting, please send email to
   nevil@caida.org telling us how many will attend from
   your organisation.

CAIDA Network Metrics Working Group: Draft Charter, Tue 23 Feb 00

Goals:
 1 Education
   + FAQ on What does 'measuring the Internet actually mean?'
     - Why measure anyway?
     - What can be measured?  How?  Where?  By whom?
     - Active vs passive, end-to-end vs provider network only,
       application vs transport layer
     - Rating schemes: provider 'net performance' pages, Internet
       'Weather Map's, Keynote, etc.
     Publish as CAIDA web pages, or maybe as an Info RFC

   + Survey paper on metrics and Internet Measurement
     - Current measurement efforts (Surveyor, RIPE Test Traffic,
       AMP, IPERF, AT&T, Keynote,skitter, ...)
     - Current tools
     Publish as CAIDA web pages

 2 Service Metrics
   + Define new metrics
     - Taxonomy of current metrics (IPPM, RTFM, ITU, ..)
     - Summary of metrics used for current services
     - Gather information/ideas about new/emerging services,
       especially DiffServ-based ones
     - Make list of new metrics, either to improve measurement of
       existing services or to support new ones
       [list of 'metrics' questions (Appendix A) goes here]

   + Organise experimental implementation/testing of tools
     for new metrics

   + Make recommendations on implementation
     - Define core set of 'really useful' metrics
     - recommend that CAIDA implement these as a
       'Service Measurement Toolkit'

   + Publish new metric definitions through IPPM or RTFM

   + Produce document "measurement requirements for hardware/software
     vendors."  Publish on CAIDA web pages


-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Appendix A: Questions from the earlier draft CAIDA WG charters


 a. What types of network- and transport-layer metrics are being
    used by ISPs in engineering and operating their networks?
    By Customers for verifying service guarantees?
 b. What new services are being (or are likely to be) offered, e.g.
    DIFFSERV?  Is there a need for higher-layer metrics to better
    monitor and manage these services?
 c. Will these new differentiated transport- and
    application-layer services need new metrics?
 d. How can the service metrics be measured in a multi-ISP
    environment?
 e. How can customers verify these measurements?
 f. What requirements would service measurement introduce for
    equipment vendors?


 g. How relevant are specific techniques (e.g. which flow) and
    points of measurement to specific users (ISP, customer, etc.)
    requirements?
 h. How do these metrics relate to network behavior as perceived
    by users? How do they correlate with performance?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Appendix B: Background on the IETF Working Groups


* RTFM WG: Realtime traffic Flow Measurement

RTFM is concerned with passive measurements of two-way traffic flows,
specified in terms of their end-point attributes.  Its primary goal was

To produce an improved Traffic Flow Measurement Model considering at least the
following needs:

 a. Wider range of measurable quantities, e.g. those
    relating to IPv6, and to class of service
 b. Simpler ways to specify flows of interest
 c. Better ways to control access to measured flow data
 d. Strong focus on data reduction capabilities
 e. Efficient hardware implementation


* IPPM WG: IP Performance Measurement

The IPPM WG charter is to develop a set of standard metrics that can
be applied to the quality, performance, and reliability of Internet
data delivery services. These metrics will be designed such that they
can be performed by network operators, end users, or independent
testing groups. It is important that the metrics not represent a value
judgement (i.e. define "good" and "bad"), but rather provide unbiased
quantitative measures of performance.

RFCs
  Framework for IP Performance Metrics (RFC 2330)
  Metrics:
     Connectivity (RFC 2678),
     One-way Delay (RFC 2679), One-way Packet Loss (RFC 2680)
     Round-trip Delay (RFC 2681)

I-Ds
     Bulk Transfer Capacity (2x)
     Instantaneous Packet Delay Variation
     One-way Loss Patterns


* Other WGs

The RMONMIB WG is thinking about 'Application Performance
Measurement.'  This is clearly a hard problem (e.g. does this just
mean response-time measurement, can it be done by passive means, how
should the measurements be presented, etc.).


In short
 - RTFM provides a good distributed measuring system for traffic
   volumes
 - IPPM has concentrated on transport-layer behaviour of the
   current, best-effort Internet.
 - RMONMIB is beginning to consider application-layer measurement

This guy has basic quant skills, etc.  but at EBS we would need interns 
possible from MBA schools, not PhD.  I think he is a summer intern fit for 
Enron research and we can loop him into EBS research as we need help (which 
is likely).

Stinson,

Should we get him as well?
It seems he has the right skills. 
We might have maxed out on the
number of summer interns through
the A/A program. We would have to
hire him directly.

FYI:  

Note that the person mentioned in the text below (Ming Lung Lee) is very 
experienced in traditional traffic engineering work. He comes from MCI where 
he was responsible for modeling traffic etc.  It  appears that Sycamore 
finally got him.  One time they had lost him to Corvis (another optical 
equipment company), I guess Sycamore went back to him with a better deal!  As 
soon as this guy is available, I'll set up an all day technical meeting to 
hash out what needs to be done as far as optimization algorithm development 
is concerned.  I want to produce a technical requirement document to clearly 
outline what needs to be done to support dynamic, optical-switched-circuits 
based trading and streaming media applications, etc.  Having such an industry 
expert help us will help 'justify' internally all the the effort on the 
traffic analysis side that John Griebling has asked us to support.  Keep in 
mind that even though he is an expert in the field, the field that we need to 
play in has not develop yet. Even the emerging data based traffic (as opposed 
to voice where blocking of traffic is allowed) analysis is an order of 
magnitude more difficult (due to uncertain load), let alone trading such load 
(which we are planning to do!).  

Ravi.


... Sycamore hired a guy per Griebling's request, to work with you on the
design/planning piece of the business.  He will be contracted out to Enron
for a period of 6 months initially.  He lives in SF but will be traveling to
whereever you need him.  Jim, Griebling wanted us to set up a meeting
between you guys for Wednesday morning, if you have time.  His name is Ming
Lung Lee and he comes to us from MCI.  Let me know what works.

Hi Ravi.  Fair enough, we will make sure we keep you guys in the loop.  Let
Barb/me know which items we can offload to you guys.

First thing to be done is Barb will schedule a call between us and you all
to gain a better understanding of a number we are trying to back into with
the metro solutions (there are alot of options on our side and we need some
guidelines).  I already talked to John about this this morning so we need to
make some headway on that number.  Also, we are scheduled for a conference
call Wednesday morning with Griebling to discuss where we are at with
initial solutions for metro.  Would you like to join us?

Thursday night, we have a dinner tentatively planned (talk with Griebling
about who, where, etc.).  Friday we will be meeting all day at the Omni in
Interlocken.

Ravi and Jim, per my conversations with John, he is going to run point on
the metro solutions.  Dorn is swamped with other activities.  As for the
switching piece, we discussed our routing software on Monday and I think
that is all we are going to do until Ahi is done then we will set up a
meeting between our guys and the Ahi folks.  The expectation is that this
meeting will occur in the next 30 days.

Also, Sycamore hired a guy per Griebling's request, to work with you on the
design/planning piece of the business.  He will be contracted out to Enron
for a period of 6 months initially.  He lives in SF but will be traveling to
whereever you need him.  Jim, Griebling wanted us to set up a meeting
between you guys for Wednesday morning, if you have time.  His name is Ming
Lung Lee and he comes to us from MCI.  Let me know what works.

The best ways to reach me are my cell phone or text pager.  Cell is
303-619-2485 and pager is 888-467-6167 -- you can send me a text message
from either your pager (if you have a 2 way) or press 3 to get an operator.

thanks, Kristin

friday end of day.  We would appriciate being in the loop of any discussion
that
you may have with John and Dorn (provided that they can be shared with us).

Jim

Thanks for the info.  We will walk through this information and I am sure we
(Brett and Barb) will have some questions as we are modeling with our
potential metro solutions.  When would you and Ravi be available for a
conference call on Tuesday to discuss?

Also, as far as a meeting, I am trying to recall what you are referencing.
Is it in regards to this or the switching piece?  Will you two be in Denver
all week?  We have a call with Griebling tomorrow regarding our routing
software, so I can talk with him about how he wants to handle this piece.

Talk to you soon, Kristin

news for you.  There=01,s a new generation of videoconferencing end-point
devices that provide business-quality pictures and sound for under
$12,000.

We grabbed a box of popcorn and tested eight videoconferencing systems,
using 384K bit/sec ISDN and IP connections.

In the category of videoconferencing appliances  that is, standalone
systems that go in a conference room for group video sessions with
colleagues or business partners  Polycom=01,s ViewStation MP was the
clear winner.

The Polycom ViewStation provided outstanding video and audio quality.
In addition, it was easy to install, configure and use.

In the category of PC-based products, which are especially good for
virtual collaboration from your desktop, VCON=01,s MC800 was the hands-
down winner, based on its high-quality components.

The beauty of these products is they allow you to have a real-time
video image of the person you=01,re conferencing with in one corner of
the screen, with the rest of the space available for data collaboration.

If you=01,re in the market for a system, be sure to get one with a Sony
EVI D30/31 video camera; an unidirectional boundary microphone, like
the Audio Technica; and a quality sound mixer. And look for remote
administration and system management tools. For example, the
ViewStation allows you to upgrade software, change settings, or change
address book entries directly from the administrator=01,s system.

Most systems will allow you to transmit over ISDN or IP, but we found
performance over IP was dragged down by IP=01,s overhead requirements. For
the complete product review, go to:
http://www.nwfusion.com/reviews/2000/0313rev.html

Of course, there=01,s more to videoconferencing than end points, so we
whipped up an implementation guide that lays out the network topology,
bandwidth and quality-of-service issues.
http://www.nwfusion.com/reviews/2000/0313rev2.html

Based on our testing, the Reviewmeister says now is the time to start
pilot-testing a videoconferencing system. Your chief information
officer will love it when you tell him you can slash your company=01,s
airline and hotel bills because you=01,ve got people from all over the
company in virtual rather than face-to-face meetings.

Next week: We loaded Windows 2000 on a PC and a server and ran Gigabit
Ethernet to the desktop. Guess where the bottleneck was?

Martin, I am working right here with Jim Irvine and discussed your rotation.  
You will report to me, with 'client' reporting role to Jim where you will do 
most of the work.  You will remain in Houston working on the 19th floor for 
now until we find you a place on either 44th or 45th. Jim Irvine will be 
asking John Griebling for Network Planning office space in Houston.  You will 
get an office in that area.  Jim will work from Portland but will hold an 
office in Houston.  Until the office space on EBS floors happens, you need to 
remain on the 19th.  We will allocate you to Jim's & John Griebling's group 
full time. You will have EBS computers, cell phone, etc. to be fully 
connected on the EBS side.  You will work initially on the trffic engineering 
side to support day-to-day fire-fighting like analysis.  I will supervise you 
with repect to guidance on what to do etc... Jim will direct what will get 
done.  Both Jim and I will support  Traffic Engineering work but Jim is 
ultimately responsible for deliverables.

Our technical operational research specialists (Samer, Chonawee, and two 
others from Stanford & MIT) will focus on next generation algorithms for EBS. 
Such an algorithm is currently being specified. This will depend on how the 
trading market will develop. We know that existing off-shelf codes won't be 
sufficient.  The development period for these algorithms will anywhere from 3 
months to 9 months depending on the complexity. This is in-line with when EBS 
anticipates trade volumes to really pickup.  I hope this helps.

Regards,

Ravi.

Ravi,

The Associate program has a procedure that requires information on new
rotations.  I just wanted to clarify some details of my rotation to EBS, esp
given the retained ties to Research.  Will Jim Irvine be my supervisor with 
EBS
being the company billed for my time?  That is, will my connection to Research
be informal and understood, rather than having some actual reporting function?
This is with respect to the A/A pool.

Thanks,
Martin

Vince,

How are you? Hope all is well.

Is there any chance we can schedule my visit to Enron on Friday, May 19,
or Friday, May 26?

By the end of April I was able to attract a top new student to work on the 
project.
The other one for the coming year will be Giuseppe. By spending the summer
at Enron, he will be in a position to bring the new one up to speed and
create an intellectual team here at Stanford to look at these problems.

I must move ahead soon to put the project in place and get the work going.

Talk to you soon,

Nick

Subject: XPRESS and CPLEX Runtime Comparison results

Hi,

I have tested both CPLEX and XPRESS-MP optimization software in solving our 
network design problem.
XPRESS is more user friendly hence it takes less developing time. However, 
CPLEX performs significantly better
in term of computation time, especially in integer programming.
As a result, eventhougth XPRESS is easier to use and cheaper, I would 
recommend our EBS group to use CPLEX. 
Please let me know what do you think...

The test problem has 10 nodes, 77 cables, 5 cable speed. 


The table below represents the computation time in seconds for solving this 
problem.
The second column indicates if the general integer variables are relaxed (but 
still keep the binary variables). 
The "LP" column represents the computational time when solving relaxed 
problem (no binary & integer variable constraints). 
XPRESS took too much time in solving case 4 and 6 so I had to stop the 
process and report the best solutions it found.




Below are the graph.

Subject: Optical Network Engineering & Enron Research Offsite Meeting

Hi John, as per our discussion and e-mails, I am suggesting the following 
dates for the subject offsite:  April 14 & 15 th (Friday & Sat).  Place and 
agenda to follow once this date is nailed up.   The heads of each group will 
decide who will attend.  We would also invite Kevin Hannon, Scott Yeager, Tom 
Gros, Ted Seitz and Jean Mrha once the dates and agenda are agreed upon by 
the Technical folks.

As before, the idea is to introduce the two of the most technical groups 
within Enron and to exchange ideas and issues.  The Enron research team will 
provide trading and modeling presentations and the Optical Network 
Engineering team will present networking and components related topics.

Take away from the two days will be to provide John Griebling's group with 
better understanding about how the trading markets have developed in general 
and energy markets in particular via Enron (i.e.,  how the sausage was 
made!).  Likewise, John's group will provide us with better understanding of 
optical networking from a technical perspective.  Particularily, how EBS is 
planning to develop the Puplic Switched Optical Network (PSON) that John has 
'branded' our pooling point based network!

Please reply ASAP if these two days (April 14 & 15) will work.  Additionally, 
John, is the original suggestion to hold it in Scott Yeager's cabin somewhere 
up in Colorado mts. still holds?  If yes, I should probably let Scott know!  
If not, I'll try to find other places--any suggestions, anyone? 

Regards,

Ravi.

product while we are in Denver. I suspect that we will arrange for the vendor 
to come to Houston and do a presentation on the product and install the 
product on our machines.   As for additional development we should get John 
Bloomer and Jim together in a meeting and hash out the requirements from John 
Bloomer's perspective.

Using Vince's analogy, this tool allows us to deternime the size of the cargo 
space needed for Fedex-like delivery (our streaming media products). Whereas, 
the optical light path switching (DS-3, OC-3, OC-12 and OC-48) based trading 
will reserve the underlying airline routes, etc.  So the packet based stuff 
is looking at the required capacity from IP layer (Network and Transport: 
level 3 and 4) requirements. The optical light path is Level 1 & 2 based 
requirements.  That is this tool will allow John Bloomer to size (actually we 
will do the analysis for him) the capacity requirement that he would need for 
the products that he is developing.

That is my take on the difference, we'll find out otherwise.

Once I finish off this discussion with Jim in Denver, I suggest putting 
Martin Lin on the job to find out more about the product and do the leg work 
to arrange for vendor demo and software installation.  Martin will keep Samer 
and Chonawee updated on the information that he gathers.  Martin please start 
checking on the web about this company and other similiar produts. I will get 
you contact number for EBS and the vendor as soon as Jim provides them to 
me.  

Avici uses this product. Avici is a next generation router vendor that is 
selling Terabit routers. EBS is an investor in that company.

Attached is an overview of what OPNET Technologies ITDG and Modeler (V) 7.0 
offers out of the box.  As previously mentioned, we have purchased this S/W 
and are discussing potential co-development of module(s) currently not 
supported.  My belief is we can spin up a couple of your studs and develop 
our own stuff faster @ a fraction of the cost.   Avici, used OPNET to develop 
a circuit emulation model for their TSR and Cisco used OPNET for MPLS and DPT 
modeling.  These guys are willing brides at this point.  We just need to 
clearly identify their role in the network performance management and 
modeling space.  We will have to talk more in Denver. 

My flight arrives @ 10:00 ish and I am told that rental cars are scarce.

I previously told you that the weekend of March 31st would be allright for
this, however, I just found out that Krishna has planned a Research party
at his house (it is for all of Research on Saturday, April 1 and Vince told 
him it would be allright - it is his daughter's birthday).  It looks now like 
Vince
and his reports will be unable to do this until the weekend of the 13 and 
14th 
of April.

Please advise.

Subject: Off site with John Griebling's Optical Network Engineers

Hi Shirley, please give me a few dates form end of march to first week in 
April to do an offsite for Vince's direct reports (including myself) and 
selected EBS research people. This includes, Vince direct report from our 
research group and the following people from EBS Research:

Ravi, Stinson, Samer, Chinowee.

The agenda will include: Research people giving several mini presentations on 
Trading, market development (history of Nat gas, Electricity, etc.), pricing, 
etc...

John's people will do similar mini presentations on Optical Network 
engineering, optical components, provisioning, telecom markets, pricing, 
etc.... 
If Scott Yeager can make it, he will do his magic via quick motivational 
speech on the vision of EBS, etc..

It is will be strictly Technical to Technical professional meeting to get to 
know each others group. So, do not include others unles Stinson or I look at 
the additions case-by-case.

John suggested Scott Yeager's summar house in Denver for this event.  Please 
follow this up with Scott's assistant (Scott may not know about this if John 
has not told him so you should explain the intend, etc.) to get in touch with 
Scott.  I'll cc this e-mail to give Scott a heads up.

We can do half day friday and all day saturday. Or, we can do the whole 
weekend and people will have an option to bring family to nearby hotel 
(family expense in NOT on EBS). We will have to sort all this out when we 
have a chance to talk to John & Scott.

I just wanted to get the ball rolling but getting dates and place first.  

Thanks,

Ravi.

Dear Stinson,

I apologize for the delay in responding. I was away Wed-Sun and
just returned. Thank you very much for your email. I plan to make
a firm decision on my future plans sometime in the later half of
April, and would be extremely interested in getting an offer from
ENRON. I think the opportunities at ENRON are very exciting and
there is room for some real contribution to the group.

Best wishes,
Salal

Vince,

FYI.

Prof. Gabriel Bitran of the M.I.T. management science department is planning 
to visit EBS on Wednesday, Aug. 9, to discuss research topics which might be 
of interest to EBS.   (This is Amit Dhadwal's advisor.)   He still has 25K of 
funding to use for research, but we are having a hard time coming up with a 
mutually suitable topic.   I have asked Samer to work with him in trying to 
come up with a research subject.

Vince:

    I forgot to attach the Final SLAM Report, The File of the White Paper,
The White Paper Calculations.  The Final SLAM Report discusses the
availability of Service Level Agreement Monitoring, and NMS generally that
meet EBS's needs.

    I am convinced that at a minimum EBS would gain the foundation of a great
NMS that will be critical to the success of EBS, and that EBS could actually
gain the Distributed Machine Tool that could be the foundation of the
Internet of the 21st Century.  I hope we get the chance to prove this.

    Let me know if I can be of further assistance.

Hi Vince, I (and possibly Stinson as well) will be attending this initial 
meeting looks like kick-off type of meeting. I will try to attend to drill 
into what they can offer and what we have committed. make sure that we get 
from the arrangement n John Griebling & Jim Irvine's perspective and ours.  

I'll fire off additional information as I get them.

Hello CAIDA Members:

Update on the CAIDA Working Groups ..
   A.  'metrics@caida.org' mailing list
   B.  WG Charters, Meeting on 2 Mar 00


A. 'metrics@caida.oeg' mailing list

I've set up a single mailing list with this name, for discussions on WG
topics, passive measurements, etc.  To start with it's a moderated list
(i.e. you have to be a member of the list to post to it, you join by sending
email to nevil@caida.org asking to be added to the 'metrics' list), with
the following initial set of members:

        Sue Moon <sbmoon@sprintlabs.com>,
        Brett Watson <bwatson@vix.com>,
        Hans-Werner Braun <hwb@nlanr.net>,
        Matt Mathis <mathis@psc.edu>,
        Ian Graham <ian@cs.waikato.ac.nz>,
        Tony McGregor <tonym@nlanr.net>,
        John Cleary <jcleary@cs.waikato.ac.nz>,
        Joerg Micheel <joerg@cs.waikato.ac.nz>,
        Kevin Thompson <kthomp@mci.net>,
        Jambi Gambar <jambi@mci.net>,
        Daniel McRobb <dwm@caida.org>,
        David Moore <dmoore@caida.org>,
        Sean McCreary <mccreary@caida.oe,rg>
        Rene Hatem <rene@canarie.ca>,
        Shankar Rao <srao@qwest.net>,
        Cindy Bickerstaff <cbickers@td2cad.intel.com>,
        Jeff Sedayao <sedayao@orpheus.sc.intel.com>,
        Steve Feldman <feldman@twincreeks.net>,
        Bill Woodcock <woody@zocalo.net>

Two questions for CAIDA Members:
  i. Who else would you suggest be invited to join the list?
 ii. Should the list continue to be moderated, or should it
     be changed into an open list?


B.  'Working Group' developments

Following the CAIDA Members' meeting on 8 Feb 00 I've attempted to define
exactly what problem we could consider getting an IETF Working Group
started on.  My summary of the existing IETF WGs with interests in metrics
is given below (Appendix B), but it seems unlikely that we could get a
new IETF WG started.

I believe that we should instead run a single CAIDA Working Group
on 'Network Metrics,' rather than the two proposed earlier.  My draft
of its charter is appended below.  It focuses on producing educational
material about network measurement, and on developing new metrics - these
were the two areas of greatest interest amongst the CAIDA members.

The WG co-chairs are
  Sue Moon (SprintLabs) and Brett Watson (MFN/Abovenet)

You are invited to attend the first WG meeting.
The agenda is as follows ..

   Agenda for CAIDA WG meeting on: Thursday 2 Mar 00
                                   -----------------
   10 am - 4 pm, AboveNet, Downtown SJC (see below for details)
   ------------            ------------

   1. Review WG Charter
      - Is it reasonable as set out in the draft?
      - What should be removed or added?

   2. Work through revised charter in detail
      - Identify the work required for each part
      - Determine who's willing to work on it
      - Attempt to determine delivery times

   3. Discussion of new metrics
      - First attempt at making a list of metrics to be considered

   4. Anything else ?

Location: AboveNet is located in the Knight-Ridder Building,
attached to the Fairmont Hotel complex.  The address is

  50 W. San Fernando St.
  San Jose, CA  95113

RSVP: To help us with organising the meeting, please send email to
   nevil@caida.org telling us how many will attend from
   your organisation.


Cheers, Nevil

CAIDA Network Metrics Working Group: Draft Charter, Tue 23 Feb 00

Goals:
 1 Education
   + FAQ on What does 'measuring the Internet actually mean?'
     - Why measure anyway?
     - What can be measured?  How?  Where?  By whom?
     - Active vs passive, end-to-end vs provider network only,
       application vs transport layer
     - Rating schemes: provider 'net performance' pages, Internet
       'Weather Map's, Keynote, etc.
     Publish as CAIDA web pages, or maybe as an Info RFC

   + Survey paper on metrics and Internet Measurement
     - Current measurement efforts (Surveyor, RIPE Test Traffic,
       AMP, IPERF, AT&T, Keynote,skitter, ...)
     - Current tools
     Publish as CAIDA web pages

 2 Service Metrics
   + Define new metrics
     - Taxonomy of current metrics (IPPM, RTFM, ITU, ..)
     - Summary of metrics used for current services
     - Gather information/ideas about new/emerging services,
       especially DiffServ-based ones
     - Make list of new metrics, either to improve measurement of
       existing services or to support new ones
       [list of 'metrics' questions (Appendix A) goes here]

   + Organise experimental implementation/testing of tools
     for new metrics

   + Make recommendations on implementation
     - Define core set of 'really useful' metrics
     - recommend that CAIDA implement these as a
       'Service Measurement Toolkit'

   + Publish new metric definitions through IPPM or RTFM

   + Produce document "measurement requirements for hardware/software
     vendors."  Publish on CAIDA web pages


-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Appendix A: Questions from the earlier draft CAIDA WG charters


 a. What types of network- and transport-layer metrics are being
    used by ISPs in engineering and operating their networks?
    By Customers for verifying service guarantees?
 b. What new services are being (or are likely to be) offered, e.g.
    DIFFSERV?  Is there a need for higher-layer metrics to better
    monitor and manage these services?
 c. Will these new differentiated transport- and
    application-layer services need new metrics?
 d. How can the service metrics be measured in a multi-ISP
    environment?
 e. How can customers verify these measurements?
 f. What requirements would service measurement introduce for
    equipment vendors?


 g. How relevant are specific techniques (e.g. which flow) and
    points of measurement to specific users (ISP, customer, etc.)
    requirements?
 h. How do these metrics relate to network behavior as perceived
    by users? How do they correlate with performance?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Appendix B: Background on the IETF Working Groups


* RTFM WG: Realtime traffic Flow Measurement

RTFM is concerned with passive measurements of two-way traffic flows,
specified in terms of their end-point attributes.  Its primary goal was

To produce an improved Traffic Flow Measurement Model considering at least the
following needs:

 a. Wider range of measurable quantities, e.g. those
    relating to IPv6, and to class of service
 b. Simpler ways to specify flows of interest
 c. Better ways to control access to measured flow data
 d. Strong focus on data reduction capabilities
 e. Efficient hardware implementation


* IPPM WG: IP Performance Measurement

The IPPM WG charter is to develop a set of standard metrics that can
be applied to the quality, performance, and reliability of Internet
data delivery services. These metrics will be designed such that they
can be performed by network operators, end users, or independent
testing groups. It is important that the metrics not represent a value
judgement (i.e. define "good" and "bad"), but rather provide unbiased
quantitative measures of performance.

RFCs
  Framework for IP Performance Metrics (RFC 2330)
  Metrics:
     Connectivity (RFC 2678),
     One-way Delay (RFC 2679), One-way Packet Loss (RFC 2680)
     Round-trip Delay (RFC 2681)

I-Ds
     Bulk Transfer Capacity (2x)
     Instantaneous Packet Delay Variation
     One-way Loss Patterns


* Other WGs

The RMONMIB WG is thinking about 'Application Performance
Measurement.'  This is clearly a hard problem (e.g. does this just
mean response-time measurement, can it be done by passive means, how
should the measurements be presented, etc.).


In short
 - RTFM provides a good distributed measuring system for traffic
   volumes
 - IPPM has concentrated on transport-layer behaviour of the
   current, best-effort Internet.
 - RMONMIB is beginning to consider application-layer measurement

Sandeep,

Can DPC sell to MSEB and have EIPL buy an equivalent amount of power from MSEB
at another spot on their grid, and then EIPL sell to the 3rd party state?

Subject:  Re: Mark-to-Market  (Document link: Wade Cline)

Sandeep:
     I met with Bob today and discussed the deal structure we put together. On
the mark-to-market issue, Bob and his colleague Wess told me that as long as
payments are tied to one particular plant, we cannot m-t-m them. They had same
problem with plants here in the US (like the peaking plants) and they had to
separate the plant from power sales to be able to m-t-m the assocated 
cashflows.
What they did is: they sold power from the plant to an outside party and 
bought
it back from them at completely different (multiple) locations. The buyback is
not tied to any specific plant and is marked to maket. Even if Enron can 
somehow
mark-to-market a deal with DPC, it can do so for only 50% of the cashflows
because only 50% of DPC is owned by outsiders.  And a simple loan to an
affiliate cannot also be marked to market.

     Bob was suggesting that if EIPL buys options from DPC and from some other
plants and in turn sells power to AP or Karnataka then we could have a case 
for
m-t-m. Politically DPC selling power to EIPL may not be the best solution, to
put it rather mildly!

Our alternatives, as I see them, are
1. Do the deal as we structured it. The only difference is that Enron doesn't
mark it to market and income is      earned only in 2002-03.
2. Do the deal as we structured it. EIPL/Enron then sells the contract to
another party at a profit. The problem, of course, is finding this party and
forking part of the profit to them.
3. Same deal, except revenue securitization is done through an outside party 
in
India (not EIPL).

Bob said he will think about the issues some more this week. Let me know when
you will be here next week so we can meet with Bob together. I will be going 
to
Boston for Tuesday and/or Wednesday (Feb.1-2). I can book an appt. with Bob 
for
us.

Subject:  Mark-to-Market

Bob,

I wanted to continue the analysis on mark-to-market that I had spoken to you
about on the phone.

I thought that it was getting very difficult explaining the whole transaction 
by
phone, so I am having Krishnarao who is in Vince's group explain the 
transaction
to you.

Krishna has been helping us structure the deal here in India, and he has just
returned to Houston from India after working with the team here.

He will seek an appointment with you to explain the transaction.  I would like
you to please spend some time with him, and then based on the discussion 
please
send us a note detailing how sucha a transaction would be marked to market.

Please cosider the fact that currently there are no such transactions from the
Indian side.  This is a very important transaction for us, and we may need to
repeat this in coming months, hence setting up the system to account for these
maybe well worth it.  Also, what I am concerned about is that there will be an
Enron India (EIPL) account in India based on Indian GAAP, and upon 
consolidation
there will be a US GAAP accounting in the US.  It is here that we would like 
to
have mark-to-market accounting.  EIPL is structured through Mauritius, and 
then
Caymen Islands.

Another key question to consider is that when we m-t-m the transaction in the 
US
there will be a tax accruing in the year of m-t-m (say 2000).  However, in
India, as a result of the accrual accounting, there will not be any income
showing till the year 2002 or 2003.  We will need to know how that would get
treated, and whether there is a way to get credit for the tax payable in the 
US.
I am also confused about whether US tax would be levied, since none of the
income is being brought back into the US (remains overseas - subpart-F and 
other
concerns).

Finally, we have been working hard in structuring a fixed price contract and
getting a fixed for floating swap in the US (this is still not allowed to 
Indian
Corporates).  I need you to think about this too, and see if some type of
accounting will solve this issue.  Krishna knows what I am talking about, and
will brief you on the same.

Krishna - Please walk Bob through the three structures we had worked here.

Look forward to your help and comments.  This is going to be an exciting 
project
for us all.

Regards,
Sandeep.

NETWORK WORLD FUSION FOCUS: AMY LARSEN DeCARLO
on STORAGE IN THE ENTERPRISE
Today's Focus: The lure of the SAN
03/14/00

Dear Wincenty Kaminski,

Today's Focus: The lure of the SAN
---------------------------------------------------------------
By Amy Larsen DeCarlo

E-business is changing how businesses value information. Information
has become a strategic asset that gives companies an edge over their
market rivals. Companies use intelligence to identify new markets and
make contact with prospective customers. In this media-saturated era,
information itself is packaged and sold as a product. This makes the
ability to supply users with fast access to stored information on a
continuous basis absolutely crucial.

Companies are clearly coming to a crossroads in their storage
implementations.  With estimates for Internet storage capacity needs
doubling every three months, IT professionals are hungry for a scalable
solution to help them consolidate control of stored information. They
often look to storage-area networks (SAN) as a better option to manage
their information storage systems than distributed models.

Today, most organizations rely on a distributed storage model that uses
file servers to process I/O requests from end users and other
application servers. In this model, all requests for data go through
the file server that owns the attached storage disks, and only one file
server can tap data on a particular disk via a SCSI bus.

This model has several shortcomings.  First, the amount of data a
server can access is restricted to the number of disks supported by the
bus, which limits the capacity of a single file server.  Second, because
the server processes each I/O request, it risks becoming a bottleneck.
Third, this server model carries some daunting availability limitations,
because only one file server is allowed to access a set of disks.  If
that file server or any of its SCSI connections fails, then users and
other application servers lose access to the stored files.

This model carries other major disadvantages.  Distributed file servers
rely on the data transport network to run backup and recovery operations
which can eat up bandwidth and slow normal network transmissions to a
crawl.  Finally, this decentralized setup is difficult to manage from
both a logical and a physical perspective.  File server based storage
systems are distributed throughout the enterprise, so it is often
difficult to assess current and future capacity needs.  And because
these servers use a parallel cabling scheme to link the file server to
the disk array, they can also be cumbersome to set up and manage.

SANs promise to mitigate the problems that plague conventional file
servers, largely through consolidation of control.  These specialized
storage networks claim higher availability, faster performance,
centralized management, and by their architecture, the capability to
remove bandwidth-intensive data backup and recovery operations from the
LAN. This frees up the LAN for normal data communications and ensures
smoother back-up operations.

Using high-speed transports like Fibre Channel, SANs offer a high-
performance network optimized for moving storage data. SANs also make
way for new storage implementations like LAN-free backup. And, because
Fibre Channel can support distances of up to 10 kilometers, SAN devices
can be widely distributed, but also centrally managed as one network.

Yet, as was the case with LANs in their younger years, SANs are still
developing. Vendors are still working out major product interoperability
issues, while companies deploying SAN technology struggle with how to
merge the very different worlds of storage and networks and manage both
together. Ultimately the hope is that, like LANs, SANs will develop into
a mature and highly manageable solution that supplies substantial
benefits at lower costs.

Given that storage deployment and ongoing support costs can total 10
times the acquisition price for the equipment, the consolidated
management capabilities of a SAN may deliver the biggest benefit to
business.

Barry,

Thanks for the timely email.   I have your name on my list of people to 
contact this week as Kevin Hannon had mentioned to me just yesterday that our 
group might be able to help you in translating positions for the new risk 
system for EBS.    

You are right that I haven't been spending much time on 44.   Martin Lin has 
been taking the lead in day to day management of most of the current projects 
that we are supporting.   We have been somewhat short handed since Samer 
Takriti left the group last fall and we were out-bid by McKinsey for Cantekin 
Dincerler who had helped us with EBS projects as an intern over the 
summer.    However, we do have additional help coming.   Iris Mack, a very 
bright new hire who comes with significant consulting and risk management 
experience, will be starting with the group next week.   I am hoping that, 
together with Martin, she will allow us to significantly increase the 
research group presence on 44 and address areas which are currently 
undersupported.

Can I get on your schedule some time next week in order to map out the areas 
where we could best contribute to the risk management projects and to 
introduce Iris and Martin to you?   Almost any time would be fine, or you can 
have your assistant coordinate with Shirley Crenshaw x35290.

Regards,

Stinson

Hi Zimin!

Please find attached for your  review the UK RPI model, derived by 
bootstrapping RPI swaps. 

It's a very simple model and here are its specifics:

SWAP STRUCTURE

Payment: semi/semi Act/365F
>
> YOYUKRPI = (UKRPI(p-2)/UKRPI(p-14) - 1)/2
> p = payment month
>

The first payment is the latest known historical RPI, February 2000, 2.32%. 

ASSUMPTIONS

* Constant cashflows between the quoted years (as opposed to interpolating 
swaps which distorts the curve a lot). This explains the atrocious look of 
the "raw" curve. It is then smoothed with a macro, which Anjam wrote.

* Mid point of the swaps is used for deriving the curve;

* Discount rate is LIBOR and I solve for the coupon rate, which is the RPI 
YOY rate;



* The above is solved separately for each quoted period (e.g. 2 yrs, 5 yrs) 
and RPI rates are determined for the incremental portion.

By forecasting RPI in the above method we are able to lock in and deliver the 
forecasted levels.

Looking forward to your comments and seeing you in London!

Best regards,

Martina

Ravi:

Samer and I met this morning with Sara Ledbetter.   She is starting the 
groundwork for setting up a storage book and a streaming book for tracking 
the e-powered products positions.    They are having a meeting on next 
Tuesday to discuss this.  Samer will attend.    This is a good opportunity to 
start compiling the data that we will need for some of John Grieblings 
questions.

--stinson

p.s.   Sara also asked if we knew anyone who would be interested in managing 
the storage book.  Any suggestions?

Tom,

I got sick and had to reschedule the meeting with Nick Bambos.
I shall meet him on Saturday this week. I shall talk to him about the 
following:

1. Financing research projects by graduate students ($100K per year, spread 
over several projects)
2. Inviting Nick to visit Enron
3. I can mention the possibility of Nick consulting for us. Given his status, 
involvement in the Internet2 project,
and views that closely parallel Enron's vision, it makes sense to have him 
working for us. He could
be a very effective voice supporting our initiatives.

Please, let me know what you think.

Vince

Hi Gene, looks like you are dealing with the subject.  Thanks for moving this 
forward. KMI is dancing around relatively minor issues that I think we should 
be able to overcome. Essentially, the issue is that we will not resell their 
database or misrepresent it.  They want to put in all this restriction about 
not using it for trading, exchange, etc. stretches our possible usage of this 
database.  It appears from your e-mail that the attament therein is our 
standard agreement that we get our vendors to sign.  At this point, I am 
happy with whatever it takes to get those guys to close the deal.

Thank you very much for the prompt service,

Regards,

Ravi.

What do we need to know to make EBS a successful business?

We need to identify 5 to 10 critical issues in order to help M.I.T. professor 
Gabriel Bitran get his students focused on areas of interest to EBS.


Your suggestions for interesting and useful research topics are due by next 
Wednesday morning, May 31.   Tom Gros will then forward the topics to 
professor Bitran.

Subject: EBS VaR Transaction Policy

Hey you guys,

We are trying to implement a 'VaR transaction' policy - and would like your 
opinion.

This is going to be tough - because I'm not sure we have implemented a 
similiar policy across any of our other 'books' - that is - we looking to 
bring in all the accrual/operational assets as well as the MTM stuff 
(lambdas). To have a real-live 'configuration' of the system.

If assets/routes/servers etc...are added - what is the impact on the 'value' 
of the system and what it's worth. 

John has attached a draft below - for your review and thoughts.

I can see how this works in a trading environment - when you actually know 
the VaR of your whole trading portfolio. However - I've not seen this done 
with a mixture of MTM & accrual assets. Add the spice of a 'operational 
system' valuation  - and this will be tough to quantify and model.

Step 1 - configure system and value it 
Step 2 - calculate a VaR on this. We will need to do some work here!
Step 3 - calculate the incremental VaR of new deals/amendements/reconfigs etc 
- tough....

See what you think?

B.

Here is a first rough draft of a "value @ risk" transaction policy.

I would like you to start looking at where we are going on the policy and get 
some early thinking going on limits for the V@R.  For example, should we 
effectively shut down all server relocations without approval,  or allow some 
level of MB of storage to be moved around or reconfigured?

I need some commercial and industry realism for this.  We may need Rick 
Paiste or your industry helpers (Marquardt, etc. to help us).

Barry,  Lou,  I need your input.

Nick,

Sorry for the delay in my reply.   August the 21st will work the best, since 
Jim Fallon (head trader for bandwidth) will be out the following week.   We 
will set up a meeting with him.   Kevin Hannon is out, however, and there is 
no need for you to stay for dinner if you prefer to head back earlier in the 
afternoon.

Should you want help in making any travel arrangements,  our assistant 
Shirley Crenshaw (713 853 5290) would be happy to help you.

thanks and look forward to your visit,

Stinson

Hello!

The 29th will be fine--if we can definitely get everything in by then.  I 
just worry a little when we start getting less than a month out.  We need to 
make sure that our Conference Services office has enough time to detail all 
of your functions properly so that everything flows smoothly.

Also please know that the availability of those $274 airfares is also not 
guaranteed until booked (you know how those airlines are about changing fares 
around).  We need to be able to book a specific class of service to get that 
fare, so once those are gone the fare cannot be guaranteed.  Do you want me 
to get started with the air contract?

Please keep me posted!  Thanks!

Steve

Good morning Steve:

I received your voice mail and the flight information sounds great!

I need to update you as to the status of everything at present.

   The contract is fine, however, I am not authorized to sign it, so if it is
   allright, we are putting "John Griebling's" name in my place.  He will 
sign 
   the contract and we will put the charges on his credit card.

   However, John is out of town and will not be back in until tomorrow.  This
   may cut it a little close as to getting everything back to you by Monday,
   the 27th.  Is there a possibility of getting this deadline pushed back a 
   couple of days?  We are also having a problem getting a commitment from 
the 
   top management people - they are all out of town at present.  This does not
   involve very many - only 3 or 4 people, but we need to get a definate 
count 
   so that we won't be short on rooms.  If everyone can come, it looks like 
we 
   might need at least 39 rooms.

   We should be able to have everthything to you by the 29th - is this a
   problem?

Please let me know as soon as possible.

Thanks and have a great day!

Hi Shirley, please give me a few dates form end of march to first week in 
April to do an offsite for Vince's direct reports (including myself) and 
selected EBS research people. This includes, Vince direct report from our 
research group and the following people from EBS Research:

Ravi, Stinson, Samer, Chinowee.

The agenda will include: Research people giving several mini presentations on 
Trading, market development (history of Nat gas, Electricity, etc.), pricing, 
etc...

John's people will do similar mini presentations on Optical Network 
engineering, optical components, provisioning, telecom markets, pricing, 
etc.... 
If Scott Yeager can make it, he will do his magic via quick motivational 
speech on the vision of EBS, etc..

It is will be strictly Technical to Technical professional meeting to get to 
know each others group. So, do not include others unles Stinson or I look at 
the additions case-by-case.

John suggested Scott Yeager's summar house in Denver for this event.  Please 
follow this up with Scott's assistant (Scott may not know about this if John 
has not told him so you should explain the intend, etc.) to get in touch with 
Scott.  I'll cc this e-mail to give Scott a heads up.

We can do half day friday and all day saturday. Or, we can do the whole 
weekend and people will have an option to bring family to nearby hotel 
(family expense in NOT on EBS). We will have to sort all this out when we 
have a chance to talk to John & Scott.

I just wanted to get the ball rolling but getting dates and place first.  

Thanks,

Ravi.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Due to unavailability of conference rooms on the 44th floor I have reserved a 
conference room on the 19th floor from 2:30 PM to 4:30 PM.  The room number 
is 19C2.  I realize some people might not be able to attend, so please let me 
know and I will e-mail you a summary of the discussions after the meeting.  I 
would also like to suggest that we make this a regularly scheduled meeting 
and have it bi-weekly or monthly.  This will allow everyone to share their 
opinions and knowledge to direct or redirect our efforts based on the market 
situation.  Please let me know if you have any comments or suggestions.  
Thank you.

Shalesh Ganjoo

Hi Mike, as per our discussion I have managed to find a place for Michael in 
EBS' D.C. office.  It is likely that he will work for me on the EBS side but 
will live in D.C.  I will finalize that later.   Vince had mentioned that it 
is okay with him as long as it is okay with you. So please double check with 
Vince on this. 

I suggest the following transition:

Start date in D.C.   May 1, 2000

>From now till the start date, Michael will slowly transition into my group 
but MAKE SURE that your activities are transitioned into someone else.  But I 
would like to propose the May 1, 2000 date as hard start so that Michael will 
have to start moving few days before that, etc.


Regards,

Ravi.

Hello all:

Bad news!  Most of the really nice restaurants in Breckenridge close on the
22nd of April.  We may have to have all the dinners at the hotel.  Do you 
have 
any other suggestions?

I will check with Scott Yeager's wife again today to see if she perhaps knows 
of another good restaurant that may be open, but the owner of Pierre's told 
me most of them close and open again for the summer season in  May.

Thanks!

Shirley

   B.  WG Charters, Meeting on 2 Mar 00


I believe that we should instead run a single CAIDA Working Group
on 'Network Metrics,' rather than the two proposed earlier.  My draft
of its charter is appended below.  It focuses on producing educational
material about network measurement, and on developing new metrics - these
were the two areas of greatest interest amongst the CAIDA members.

The WG co-chairs are
  Sue Moon (SprintLabs) and Brett Watson (MFN/Abovenet)

You are invited to attend the first WG meeting.
The agenda is as follows ..

   Agenda for CAIDA WG meeting on: Thursday 2 Mar 00
                                   -----------------
   10 am - 4 pm, AboveNet, Downtown SJC (see below for details)
   ------------            ------------

   1. Review WG Charter
      - Is it reasonable as set out in the draft?
      - What should be removed or added?

   2. Work through revised charter in detail
      - Identify the work required for each part
      - Determine who's willing to work on it
      - Attempt to determine delivery times

   3. Discussion of new metrics
      - First attempt at making a list of metrics to be considered

   4. Anything else ?

Location: AboveNet is located in the Knight-Ridder Building,
attached to the Fairmont Hotel complex.  The address is

  50 W. San Fernando St.
  San Jose, CA  95113

RSVP: To help us with organising the meeting, please send email to
   nevil@caida.org telling us how many will attend from
   your organisation.


Cheers, Nevil

CAIDA Network Metrics Working Group: Draft Charter, Tue 23 Feb 00

Goals:
 1 Education
   + FAQ on What does 'measuring the Internet actually mean?'
     - Why measure anyway?
     - What can be measured?  How?  Where?  By whom?
     - Active vs passive, end-to-end vs provider network only,
       application vs transport layer
     - Rating schemes: provider 'net performance' pages, Internet
       'Weather Map's, Keynote, etc.
     Publish as CAIDA web pages, or maybe as an Info RFC

   + Survey paper on metrics and Internet Measurement
     - Current measurement efforts (Surveyor, RIPE Test Traffic,
       AMP, IPERF, AT&T, Keynote,skitter, ...)
     - Current tools
     Publish as CAIDA web pages

 2 Service Metrics
   + Define new metrics
     - Taxonomy of current metrics (IPPM, RTFM, ITU, ..)
     - Summary of metrics used for current services
     - Gather information/ideas about new/emerging services,
       especially DiffServ-based ones
     - Make list of new metrics, either to improve measurement of
       existing services or to support new ones
       [list of 'metrics' questions (Appendix A) goes here]

   + Organise experimental implementation/testing of tools
     for new metrics

   + Make recommendations on implementation
     - Define core set of 'really useful' metrics
     - recommend that CAIDA implement these as a
       'Service Measurement Toolkit'

   + Publish new metric definitions through IPPM or RTFM

   + Produce document "measurement requirements for hardware/software
     vendors."  Publish on CAIDA web pages


-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Appendix A: Questions from the earlier draft CAIDA WG charters


 a. What types of network- and transport-layer metrics are being
    used by ISPs in engineering and operating their networks?
    By Customers for verifying service guarantees?
 b. What new services are being (or are likely to be) offered, e.g.
    DIFFSERV?  Is there a need for higher-layer metrics to better
    monitor and manage these services?
 c. Will these new differentiated transport- and
    application-layer services need new metrics?
 d. How can the service metrics be measured in a multi-ISP
    environment?
 e. How can customers verify these measurements?
 f. What requirements would service measurement introduce for
    equipment vendors?


 g. How relevant are specific techniques (e.g. which flow) and
    points of measurement to specific users (ISP, customer, etc.)
    requirements?
 h. How do these metrics relate to network behavior as perceived
    by users? How do they correlate with performance?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Appendix B: Background on the IETF Working Groups


* RTFM WG: Realtime traffic Flow Measurement

RTFM is concerned with passive measurements of two-way traffic flows,
specified in terms of their end-point attributes.  Its primary goal was

To produce an improved Traffic Flow Measurement Model considering at least the
following needs:

 a. Wider range of measurable quantities, e.g. those
    relating to IPv6, and to class of service
 b. Simpler ways to specify flows of interest
 c. Better ways to control access to measured flow data
 d. Strong focus on data reduction capabilities
 e. Efficient hardware implementation


* IPPM WG: IP Performance Measurement

The IPPM WG charter is to develop a set of standard metrics that can
be applied to the quality, performance, and reliability of Internet
data delivery services. These metrics will be designed such that they
can be performed by network operators, end users, or independent
testing groups. It is important that the metrics not represent a value
judgement (i.e. define "good" and "bad"), but rather provide unbiased
quantitative measures of performance.

RFCs
  Framework for IP Performance Metrics (RFC 2330)
  Metrics:
     Connectivity (RFC 2678),
     One-way Delay (RFC 2679), One-way Packet Loss (RFC 2680)
     Round-trip Delay (RFC 2681)

I-Ds
     Bulk Transfer Capacity (2x)
     Instantaneous Packet Delay Variation
     One-way Loss Patterns


* Other WGs

The RMONMIB WG is thinking about 'Application Performance
Measurement.'  This is clearly a hard problem (e.g. does this just
mean response-time measurement, can it be done by passive means, how
should the measurements be presented, etc.).


In short
 - RTFM provides a good distributed measuring system for traffic
   volumes
 - IPPM has concentrated on transport-layer behaviour of the
   current, best-effort Internet.
 - RMONMIB is beginning to consider application-layer measurement

Stinson, I had a discussion with Jim and he said that the company's name is 
Mill three. They provide modeling tools for Tiered QoS and the like for 
network planning.  He said that the code is written in C and that we should 
be able to work with it. He will get us the contact name and we can get a 
presentation for us.  Jim said that he arranged for this before he met me and 
learned of our (EBS Research) role in this matter. I made it clear to Jim 
that John Griebling had asked us to set up this group to do modeling and that 
we are in the process of arranging for 4 OR modeling experts to reside in 
Houston. From now on Jim and I will work hand and hand on such issues along 
with you to make sure that we initiate development efforts as soon as 
possible to utilize Krishna, Samer and Co. asap...

I'll take care of arranging a meeting with these consultatants ASAP.

My involvement in Hamachi is through Jim Irvine. Jim and I are working very 
well together due to our engineering background. Jim has been a network 
(communications) engineer in the army for about 20 years.  For Hamachi, there 
were gap analysis that needed to be done w.r.t. network reach and when and 
where the network will be available (EBS' and Hamachi's). Additionally, we 
would look at when Tom Gros wanted pooling points up and running, we would 
then look at Hamachi's pooling point sites and come up with requests to 
change dates or third party involvements.

For the most part, our efforts has been to interview Hamachi network 
developers about their plans and put the data together in a manner that we 
can summarize for John. Additionally, we've had two meetings with Sycamore 
(they have offices in Denver) on their products and Brett gave a presentation 
on his effort to Jim, etc.... More details later when we meet.

Ravi.

Ravi:

I was told by John Bloomer that there is a group of consultants in the 
Portland office from a company called (I think)  M3i.   They are doing 
network consumption and operations modelling.    Jim Irvine or Shawna Meyer 
were given as Enron contacts on this project.   We need to find out what 
exactly this group is doing and see if we should get Samer and either you or 
me to go, find out the details, and get a brain dump of what they have 
accomplished to see if it can be used in our modelling efforts.

Can you find out what Jim knows about this project and get back to me?

thanks,

PS   How is hamachi going, and what has been your role there?

Friday, March 9 seems to be better for Jim Fallon.    We are tentatively 
setting meeting with him, Paul Racicot, and probably Arshak Sarkissian who is 
heading the IP trading effort.   Let me know if you would like to give a

Hi Stinson,

Eventually, the team here (Giuseppe, Eric, myself) has converged to two
possible dates to propose for a visit:

1) Friday, March 2
2) Friday, March 9

How do these look on your side?

We'll structure the agenda immediately after we fix the date.

I look forward to seeing you again.

Hi Vince, Mark Holsworth reviewed our contract on such a short notice.  I 
thank Mark for responding to our short-notice request.  It turns out that we 
need to get this database to move forward on a number of things and have 
legal save some time for us is an excellent help.  As mentioned below, It 
appears that PennWell's folks want to chat some more about this. 

Mark, can you schedule a conference call with these people to finalise this 
contract.  I will be out of town all week next week on a lock-down deal 
meeting. Vince may be able to get on the conference call.  I would greatly 
appreciate it if you could help us close this one!

Hi folks:
 Very glad to hear about the new developments. Just to recap what we 
discussed this morning about different things you need to look into to set up 
trading operations and the contacts:

1. Licence to trade: Regulatory people: I guess you know about this part 
better than me.

2. Trading & Risk Mgmt: Global Risk Mgmt oversight: John Sherrif in London 
has the overall responsibility outside Western Hemisphere. Research group can 
help with the structuring models used for trading.

3. Risk Conrols: Before trading group is operational, it needs to get the 
authorization from the Board of Directors of Enron along with total position 
limits and possibly value@risk limits. These limits are typically by 
commodity type and by region. Risk Assessment & Control (RAC) under Rick Buy 
performs the internal control function ensuring that the businesses adhere to 
these trading limits.  Ted Murphy is the VP in RAC overseeing the trading 
operations. The value@risk models come from the Research group, but 
day-to-day monitoring of the numbers is done by Ted's group. 

4. Credit Risk: A credit reserve number is computed for each deal (again, the 
models are created by Research) and is transferred to the credit group under 
Bill Bradford (also in RAC). This is basically like buying insurance from the 
corp. , so that if there is a couterparty default, the loss is covered by the 
reserve pool of the credit dept.

5. Legal: The name I was given is Alan Aronowitz for legal help.

6. Back Office: Initially can survive with Excel spreadsheets. You should 
contact the IT though when the plans finalize to talk about systems. 

Australia is the most recent place where we set up the trading operations. 
You can talk to Paul Quilky, the trader there to talk about these issues 
(mention to him that Grant Masson in Research gave his name). 

Barry Pierce in London was incharge of back office at the begin there.
 I can coordinate for talking with people next week. Give me a call Monday if 
possible. I hadn't the time to search for the presentation stuff today. Will 
do it next week.

Krishna.

Stinson,

Just a quick note to let you know that I am looking into it,
trying to rearrange a couple of things. I'd like Giuseppe and
possibly Eric to come with me, so I need to coordinate with
them too. We've made some nice progress that I'd like to present
and also integrate Eric in the system.

I am targeting a Friday around the end of February or begining
of March. I'll let you know soon of a few possibilities as they
stabilize here.

Best,

Nick

Mike,

Vince and I are eager to see if our group can play a role in helping you in 
your development work using some combination of the OR experts in our group 
and the resources to which we have access at Stanford.  

Can we get together for a short planning session when you are next in 
Houston?  Please let me know your schedule, or have your assistant coordinate 
a time with Vince's assistant, Shirley Crenshaw (x35290).

Thanks,

Stinson

Vince, I hope you are well.

A question if I may.

I noticed that EBS's allocation for 2001 from the corporate research group's 
budget was $1.44m. Could you please give me an 'heads-up' on what I can 
expect for the dollars - in terms of people, on-going projects, anticipated 
work-program. I'm aware that Stinson in our point person, but I've seen him 
for a long while. A breakdown/schedule would be great.

I appreciate your help.

Thanks.

Barry.

NETWORK WORLD FUSION FOCUS: AMY LARSEN DeCARLO
on STORAGE IN THE ENTERPRISE
Today's Focus: The storage revolution has begun
03/07/00

Dear Wincenty Kaminski,

Today's Focus: The storage revolution has=20
begun
---------------------------------------------------------------
By Amy Larsen DeCarlo

Believe the hype. We are in the middle of a storage revolution.
Virtually overnight, businesses have gone from storing gigabytes to
terabytes of data, and the number of users accessing that information is
skyrocketing.  The subsequent requirements are forcing companies to
rethink their storage strategies and to recognize the importance of
storage management in the equation of efficient information delivery.

It isn=01,t just the volume of data or the higher scalability demands that
are changing how businesses handle storage.  The premium that companies
place on much of their enterprise information is having a profound
effect on their storage requirements.  Businesses demand fault-tolerant
storage systems that deliver swift and reliable data access to their
employees, suppliers and customers.

But given the fact that hard disk capacity requirements, on average,
double every 12 months, while processor speeds double every 18 months,
companies are left with a quandary: How can they manage the
proliferation of stored information efficiently enough to compensate for
the differential between capacity requirements and processor speeds?

The simple answer to this question is to institute a well-executed
storage management plan that anticipates capacity requirements in
advance and leverages the best technologies and techniques to support
those needs.  Bear in mind that the majority of storage costs come not
from the equipment but from the implementation and support of those
systems.

There are several ways to efficiently manage storage. One of the best
routes is consolidation  that is, pooling resources and managing
storage as a system, as opposed to a decentralized collection of file
servers. This may sound like a throwback to an earlier era, when
enterprise storage resided on mainframes. But it=01,s actually a
progressive step, as the consolidation has more to do with centralizing
the planning, management, and ongoing support of storage systems than it
does with the physical location of the files.

Next, it is important to recognize that not all information is equally
important to the organization.  Consequently, storage requirements vary
by business application. As in all areas of IT, it is important to make
storage implementation decisions based on business needs.

Businesses trying to more efficiently manage storage are looking for
alternatives to the distributed file server storage model. They want to
speed access to stored files and remove bandwidth-intensive backup and
recovery operations from the LAN.

Network-attached storage (NAS) supplies IT professionals with one
answer, giving workstations and servers a way to gain direct access to
stored data. NAS devices, which have been widely available for years,
are optimized to process I/O transactions.  Though they promise better
performance, they don=01,t remove backups from the transport network.
Instead, they supply a relatively easy-to-deploy solution to cross-
platform storage problems for most heterogeneous environments.

Many consider storage-area networks  (SAN) to be the best long-term
answer to current and future storage challenges. Because SANs are
designed with a topology separate from the corporate data network, they
alleviate many of the availability and performance issues associated
with more traditional storage models. Yet, given the early deployment
stage most companies are still in, many of those capabilities are still
largely untested in a production environment.

This newsletter will examine how, through effective storage management,
IT professionals can reduce support costs and improve service delivery
to their customers.  This newsletter will not focus on items like the
least expensive tape drive or the fast tape library.  Instead, it will
look at how businesses can reduce inefficiencies and leverage emerging
technologies to resolve their particular storage application issues.
Ultimately, the goal is to identify storage technology options and
practices that work in real-world environments.

Hi, Vince please put your best effort in making sure that we differentiate 
summer interns and associates that EBS Research will be hiring.  I am talking 
about compensation here.  Ken Rice mentioned that EBS is in the process of 
developing a technical equivalent of our AA pool. EBS research people can 
potentially rotate through this pool in the future.  I just don't want to 
risk losing people like Giuseppe (& get the word out that we are low-ballers) 
because we have to fit them into certain set of categories that was designed 
for the energy business.  I realize that you have estabilished such 
differentiation for research as a whole, but I think that would have to be 
moved up a notch in the case of EBS.

Ravi.

Omar, thanks for the presentation and the e-mail.  As I tried to emphasize on 
the phone call, there will be short-term and long-term efforts to utilize 
OPNET. Often the short-term needs rules at EBS.  We will sort out what they 
during our discussion in Houston.  I am confirming the meeting in Houston 
6-8th.

I shall ask Shirely Crenshaw to arrange for a conference room on the 19th 
floor. The meeting will be held all day from April 6th, 7th and half day 8th. 
The 8th is a saturday and the meeting will be held to wrap things up if 
needed.

Ravi.





Background info. for Enron Research People.  OPNET is a simulation tool that 
many in the industry use to do capacity planning to IP based applications and 
services on a network.  Detail adenda will follow.

I wanted to take the opportunity to thank you for the time we had this
morning to discuss the performance engineering program at EBS. I think
you'll find that the value to Enron from the overall approach is quite
high. I have a much better picture now of some of the short term drivers
that need to be addressed as we move forward. As I work with you, I think
we'll quickly emerge with a clear picture of what needs to be done and when.

As soon as you confirm your schedule for April 6-8, I'll book my travel to
get to Houston. I've already put in a call to OPNET Technologies to have
them get a resource out to Houston on one of those days for a demonstration
and Q & A about the OPNET toolset.

I'll compose an agenda for us to use during that meeting in Houston and get
it out to you next week.

If there are any questions, please email me at

ozaidi@lucent.com

You can also call me at 503 778 0653. I am also pageable at 1 800 467 1467.

Have a great weekend and I look forward to hearing from you next week about
the April 6-8 meeting.

Best wishes....

Subject: Off-site: John Griebling's organization and Research Group

Jeff,

I would like to invite you to an off-site meeting of John Griebling's 
organization
and the Research Group. 

Date:   April 27 - April 29
Location:  Breckenridge, Colorado


As you know, John Griebling is managing the network design and construction 
project
currently under way in EBS. The Research Group is actively involved in this 
effort
which requires advanced quantitative skills in the area of stochastic 
optimization and
stochastic processes (for modeling and forecasting Internet traffic flows).

The objective of this meeting is to develop common language and accomplish 
transfer 
of skills between the two groups, to facilitate cooperation on this project 
in the future.

We are also inviting to this off-site senior management of EBS and plan to 
have
on the agenda several presentations about strategic directions of EBS. The 
effort
of network design and construction currently under way is  unprecedented in 
terms
of its scope and complexity and it is important  for technical people, who 
often have
highly specialized technical skills, to understand the broad picture.

I would appreciate if you could join us for Friday afternoon (April 28) and
Saturday (April 29). I understand  that you have commitments on Thursday and 
Friday 
morning. We have reorganized the tentative agenda of the meeting to devote
Friday afternoon to more general topics.

Vince

interviewed (2 stanford, 2 MIT).  If you need help, feel free to talk to 
Vince to find out which one he has etc....

Vince, there will be Salal from MIT coming in March 5th (I think, Kristy 
please confirm).  He is very qualified and most like a good fit. So, please 
let HR know that we may add a couple, etc.

Ravi.

Ravi,

Our compensation for summer interns is very generous. It's more than what an 
engineering student expects.

Vince

P.S.  Any progress on the resumes in electronic form? I want to send a 
package to Charlene today.

Vince

Hi, Vince please put your best effort in making sure that we differentiate 
summer interns and associates that EBS Research will be hiring.  I am talking 
about compensation here.  Ken Rice mentioned that EBS is in the process of 
developing a technical equivalent of our AA pool. EBS research people can 
potentially rotate through this pool in the future.  I just don't want to 
risk losing people like Giuseppe (& get the word out that we are low-ballers) 
because we have to fit them into certain set of categories that was designed 
for the energy business.  I realize that you have estabilished such 
differentiation for research as a whole, but I think that would have to be 
moved up a notch in the case of EBS.

Ravi.

Shalesh,

Please, look into it. Can we give them this information?
I see a remote possibility of a gain for Enron: it's in our interest to 
support
the growth of this market and part of the process is development of the
infrastructure for this market and maintaining public interest.

Dear Sir:

 The Scientific computation group at the University of
 Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, has recently started to be very
 interested in the recent developments of the bandwidth
 market. We find that the specifics of the bandwidth market
 offer challenges from the modelling point
 of view.

 However, we have encountered difficulties when looking for
 data, and we were wondering if you could help us. Specifically
 we would like to know for a given city pair for the different
 existing type of lines ( e.g. OC3, OC12, OC48 .... )

1. What has been the spot lease prices (e.g. $/line-type/mile) for
        the past 12 months?

2. What is the price of the dark fiber for a given type of line?

3. What is the maintenance cost $/month ?
           (for the same lines, e.g. OC3, OC12, OC48, ...)

4. What is the upgrading cost for the different lines?
           (e.g. how much does it cost to upgrade)
                OC3  --> OC12
                OC3  --> OC48
                OC12 --> OC48

5. How long does it take to upgrade a line from a certain
        capacity to another (e.g. 1 month, 2 month, ...) ?



 We realize that some of these questions may ask for confidential
data, in that case we would really appreciate if an order of magnitude
was provided. I look forward to hearing from you.


Sincerely,


Yann d'Halluin

Vince,

After checking into this issue I have found that the type of information 
requested is proprietary and not available for release.  I will try to 
contact them and see if there is something else we can help them with but as 
far as the data is concerned I don't believe we can help them with that 
request.  I am sorry I couldn't be of more help.  Thank you.

Ravi,

It's fine with me. I think the expense is justified (as it's equal to the 
cost of the alternative).

FYI, I may have to stay over weekend. Vince, if that is the case, I may have 
to bring my wife or allow her to go to her sister for a week etc.  I may ask 
John to cover some of that cost as (I think) he is done with other people. 
I've seen other guys family members showup. This cost would equal what EBS 
would have spend to send me home and bring me back again, etc.
