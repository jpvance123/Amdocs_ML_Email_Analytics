Not quite as easy as January, but here it is:

2/2 & 3:  Deal #510940.1 - shows wrong index - should be OFF.
2/2 & 2/3  PGE Purch total :  $699,706.40

2/5 & 6:  EPMI missing 400mw both sales & purch side, @ $0.10 adder - check presched sheets.
2/5 Totals:  PGE Sales - $650,589.20    PGE Purch - $646,262.00
2/6 Totals:  PGE Sales - $854,589.52    PGE Purch - $848,622.32

2/7 & 2/8 :  Deal #515017.1 (2/7) & deal#516006.1 (2/8) show adder of $4.25.  The adder should be $4.50.
2/7 PGE Sales total:  $877,642.40

2/8 ALSO:  Deal #516034.1 shows wrong index - should be OFF.
2/8 PGE Sales total:  $1,644,733.04

2/23 & 24:  Deal #529170.1 & #529171.1 shows wrong index - should NOT be OFF.
2/23  PGE Sales total:  $869,711.36    PGE Purch total:  $863,688.16
2/24  PGE Sales total:  $869,132.96    PGE Purch total:  $863,109.76

February 2001 PGE Sales totals:  $30,577,660.00
February 2001 PGE Purch totals:  $30,426,003.84


There is a sheet showing PA for 2/1, 2/2 & 2/3, 1200mw @ $4.00.  I already show the $4.00 adder for 600mw for each of those days.  So, I'm clueless why these have been done.

Subject:	Proposed Enpower Auto-scheduling changes

Good Morning Diana,

With the new FSP California scheduling system going live soon, the California schedulers now have a new dependency on the Enpower auto-scheduler.  Currently, Cara, or one of her schedulers, usually starts the job by 7:15am and it finishes around 7:30 - 7:45am.  The problem is that FSP processing cannot begin until the auto-scheduler has completed which could then delay us from getting out our templates.

I would like to propose a change to the process where we have Kysa run the auto-scheduler job at the end of the day to roll the auto-scheduling date forward.  This would allow FSP processing to begin anytime during the morning and it should have no effect on the other scheduling in Enpower.

Please let me know if you have any concerns,
Thanks,  David Poston

This deal was entered incorrectly.  The date span was only for 7/1/01 instead of 7/1 - 7/31.  This annuity represents the $1 charge to move 150 MW on peak to Big Eddy for the month.

Sorry for the inconvenience,

9/17	I found part of the problem.  But I still don't check out with your sales total??  	
	Purchases = $ 157,536.41	Diff = $ 166.40
	Sales = $ 149,942.71

9/18	I found part of the problem.  But I still don't check out with your sales total??  	
	Purchases= $ 120,906.80	Diff= $ 482.40	
	Sales = $ 113,792.80	

9/19	I think you may be missing the b/r of 25 mw he 15-20 @ pge system for Index + .10...both sides
	Purchases = $ 110,583.86
	Sales = $ 103,264.86

9/20	I think you may be missing the lending deal 8 mw off peak 25 mw he 15-20 @ pge system for Index + 1.50 both sides
	Purchases = $ 131,863.77
	Sales = $ 124,327.57



We seem to be out by small $$... Bill is going to send me your detail, so hopefully we'll have this wrapped up!

On August 16, 2001, Enron counsel in DC requested that the Enron Northwest cash desk pull together a tremendous amount of data for part of the 2001 operating year.  The data request was unusual in the type of information it asked for, and for the most part, Enron's internal systems did not track the information in the format requested.  Since the pending lawsuit involves a large amount of money, it was imperative that (1) the data be pulled together, even though our internal systems did not track this type of information in a format that was readily accessible; (2) the data be as accurate as possible, and; (3) it be done in a very short period of time.

The amount of data we were asked to review and pull together was massive.  Utilizing Cara's comprehensive, and fairly unique understanding of our scheduling and accounting systems, we were able to accomplish this task.  There were many instances where we hit a "brick wall".  Specifically, it was difficult to match information from our scheduling dataset with our accounting dataset, although it was imperative we do so.  Cara was instrumental in bridging this gap.

As a result of her efforts, we were able to hand a quality set of data to our consultants in DC, and subsequently for our FERC filing.  I recommend that Cara receive a Personal Best Award for the amount of $2,000.

Hey, 

I just found the curtailment on our trade sheets.  We didn't have anything directly with Burbank on a preshedule.  I'm having Donald look at the tags to see if they end up sinking with them.  I also notice that the original curtailment is thru HE 1200.  We redirected the length in the NW to PWX.  We also only had 1 obligation, which was to LDWP.  That was re-directed to Malin.  Hope this helps.

Diana-

  We just got a call from Steve at PGE regarding the following:

  There was a scheduled outage on the DC tie on August 4, 2001 that was supposed to run thru HE 12, but that outage actually lasted until HE 16.  
  PGE is saying that we sank at Burbank but that Burbank doesn't want to pay PGE.  
  I'm not sure what this means or how this is our problem, but if you know anything about it, please let me know.
  If you want Steve's extention, it's x7410.

Dear Group,

I have deposited information in each of your mail slots concerning the WSPP meeting October 11 and 12 (Thu and Fri) in Coeur D'Alene, Idaho.  After you have completed filling out the registration materials for this meeting, please give the forms to me, and I will handle your enrollment.

I have also included several pages of outing ideas for some of your "special" customers that may attend this meeting.  Let me know if I can help in arranging that as well. I know it may seem premature to reserve anything right now, but the area is expecting a number of visitors, so I advise you to plan as far in advance as possible.  We may be hosting an event the evening of October 11, but nothing has been confirmed yet.

As always, I am also available to assist in making your travel arrangements.

Let me know if you have any questions!
Anna

Guys-

  Fran and I have just noticed that two of the deals remarketed real-time were put on the ST NW book and the third was put on the W Hourly book.

  We need to get together and chat so that we can keep this consistent and make sure that the right books recognize the changes.

  Let me know if you will have time this afternoon by 3.
 If not, let's plan to meet tomorrow.

  Thanks,

3/3	I'm checking real-time to see if there was a cut that will tie me back to what your seeing.  I am also concerned that there isn't a corresponding issue with our sales 	to you on that day??

3/14	Under deal # 519875.2 - I only see 200 mwh.  7 llh book out with the pge/grizzly and 18 went to PCW under tag # 18624.  I do not show that we exercised 400
	on the llh.


this is what i have so far!

With us being a satellite office, its been a bit difficult to get a consensus!  Our IT group luckily confirmed an easy transition.  I believe our biggest hurdle will be how to manage existing contracts going forward.  Not sure what the impact of it will be financially yet.  Once that question gets answered, I'll be able to respond!  It will probably be near our Vancouver meeting, I'm assuming!!!

Thanks again,

Diana

If you haven't sent it yet, I am still getting them so it is not too late.
If someone did send it then my secretary has it and it will be included in
the summary.

Things are actually going fairly well. It is a bit scary.  Hope this summer
has been fun for you!

Kate,

I need to do a little research on this..I seem to recall them calling late to reduce their load, thus not being able to do anything on the 23/24????? I'm trying to find some supporting e-mails.

Subject:	Louisiana-Pacific Dispute - 421598

To all -

I just received a call from Thresa Allen in Houston regarding a Louisiana-Pacific sale made by Long Term Northwest. The deal flows 2000 through 2006, and the dispute falls on 2/23 and 2/24 of this year. The 7 mw round-the-clock sale was reduced to 4 mw for HE 11-24 on 2/23 and HE 1-24 on 2/24. Louisiana is disputing this, saying we should have booked out with them for these hours. (Diana entered deals to bookout with Louisiana for 2/25-2/28 - 530268, 530334, 531224, 531549, 532573.) Thresa believes we need to enter a 3 mw purchase to complete the bookout for 2/23-2/24. 

I wanted to check with you guys before doing anything because your names are the three on the deal numbers she gave me. (Bill entered a purchase annuity from L-Pac - 531549 - for a ramp down.) 

Please let me know if any of this sounds familiar. Thresa said this dispute was filed back in June, so she's eager to get it resolved.

Thanks for your help,
Kate

Subject:	Weird Deal Change Yesterday

Something strange happened in Enpower yesterday.  A deal from the STNW book was changed and we aren't sure why.  It appears that some strips from a $180 sale in NP15 were erased.  Our theory is that something happened between FSP and Enpower that erased these strips.  Of course, we don't know what happened, which is why I am contacting you.  This is really scary if our systems are changing deals.  The only reason that we noticed was because of a huge P&L hit to the STNW book.  If the price of the deal had been closer to current market we wouldn't have noticed.  Please look into this and let the trading team know what happened.

   I have not heard an answer from Gwen yet on those PMA's, but I am working with risk and I have let Fran know that I am looking into this so as not to hit your DPR twice.  I'll let you know once I have heard from everyone.

  Thanks for your patience,

Mark,

Can you re-clarify the policy for using the 3-4 character acronyms again.  There are assumptions being made that tags will be denied, starting Oct. 1,  if you don't use the new 3-4 character POR/POD list even if its prior to the implementation of spec 1.7.  References are being made to your clarification e-mail.  But I don't read anything that states tags will be denied.

Douglas County has been trying to get signed up with EOL for over a month.  From what the Help Desk is telling me, they believe its sitting with legal at this point.  Can you please assist us in getting their paperwork finished?

Much appreciated!

sorry, I didn't respond completely.  The 400 mwhs they see can't be since we cannot sell to them fixed price.   I'm not sure what they are looking at??  Please let me know if you need anything further!!

I corrected the 1 mw buy re-sale.  I don't, however, find the 35 mw peak deal.  I have looked at our trade sheet and the faxes to you and I don't recognize the deal.  Can you give me a tag perhaps?

thanks,

Diana,

Here is the same question I had the other day.  When we have a cut and  the purchase side of the deal  is ST NW and on the sale side the deal is LT NW how do you want us to enter the annuities.  If I put them on one book then we should be fine.

I know I'm kind of bouncing around, but since we have help, we're
working on whatever we can.  The following is what has been found for
July 2001, then we should be good:

7/9:  Deal #676569.1 - needs an adder of $0.10, currently shows none
(PGE system).  Our day total for our sales is $82,439.88

7/13 & 7/14:  Deal #683299.1 - needs correct index (not NF) of OFF - -
day total 7/13 = $55,054.30 & 7/14 = $48,907.74

7/23:  Deal #695822.1 - needs correct index of OFF (day tot=$184,848.56)

7/24:  Deal #697589.1 - needs correct index of OFF (day tot=$56,573.22)

7/25:  Deal #700116.1 - same as 7/24 (day total = $48,997.04)

Totals for PGE Sales:   $2,573,217.72
Totals for PGE Purch   $2,543,124.12

AND THAT'S IT !!!!

I show that both of the transmission agreements that we had with Bonneville expired 9/31/01.  Do we need to execute firm and non-firm service agreements with them?  I'm copying Jan b/c I'm not sure you are back in town.

Diana-

  We just got a call from Steve at PGE regarding the following:

  There was a scheduled outage on the DC tie on August 4, 2001 that was supposed to run thru HE 12, but that outage actually lasted until HE 16.  
  PGE is saying that we sank at Burbank but that Burbank doesn't want to pay PGE.  
  I'm not sure what this means or how this is our problem, but if you know anything about it, please let me know.
  If you want Steve's extention, it's x7410.

  Thanks,

  I'll have a more definite answer tomorrow, but for now, it looks like we're current with SCL except for a variance of approx $1000 for January 2001 and $7000 for December 2000.  Hiope this helps for now.

In this case PPM, the purchase, was cut. The sale side, PNGC did not get any power and are sending us LD's. Both sides are affected and both sides need  an annuity put into the system.  Sale annuity to PPM and a purchase annuity for PNGC.  The sale is LT NW and the purchase is ST NW.

Diana,

Here is the same question I had the other day.  When we have a cut and  the purchase side of the deal  is ST NW and on the sale side the deal is LT NW how do you want us to enter the annuities.  If I put them on one book then we should be fine.

There is a sheet showing PA for 2/1, 2/2 & 2/3, 1200mw @ $4.00.  I already show the $4.00 adder for 600mw for each of those days.  So, I'm clueless why these have been done.

Hi John -

As we discussed earlier, this is the
information about the contract
Vanalco is attempting to resell.
The Contract Demand is 170 MW.  It
is currently divided among 3 POIs.
( 50 MW at Chelan/RRH, 50 MW at
Slatt/Boardman, and 70 MW at the
US/Canadian Border.)  The POD is
Alcoa substation, near Vanalco's
facility.  Without a notice for
change in these points, the demand
would have to be used on a nonfirm
basis.  The value, of course, would
be in the discounted price you could
achieve for the demand.  If you have
a high load factor usage, it may be
very economical.

Vanalco would consider offers
consistent with the secondary
transmission market, subject to the
process they are going through in
the courts, but their objective is
to preserve the asset for the
future.

The term of the contract begins Oct
1, 2001 and terminates Sept 30, 2002
(1 year), but rollover rights exist
which have some value.  They would
expect some recall rights in the
event of production at the smelter,
but the notice period could be a
number of months.  Let me know what
you think.  If you are not
interested, do you know of a party
who might either buy or manage this
contract?

Thanks,

Bob

I have already voted on these ballots through ISAS. With the increased interest in what ISAS is doing, raises some questions as to how and who I should be reporting issues to.  With Dave being on the WMIC, this coordination is extremely helpful and communication between both groups have started.  Maybe we should get together while Dave and Andy are in town to discuss.

To all -

I just received a call from Thresa Allen in Houston regarding a Louisiana-Pacific sale made by Long Term Northwest. The deal flows 2000 through 2006, and the dispute falls on 2/23 and 2/24 of this year. The 7 mw round-the-clock sale was reduced to 4 mw for HE 11-24 on 2/23 and HE 1-24 on 2/24. Louisiana is disputing this, saying we should have booked out with them for these hours. (Diana entered deals to bookout with Louisiana for 2/25-2/28 - 530268, 530334, 531224, 531549, 532573.) Thresa believes we need to enter a 3 mw purchase to complete the bookout for 2/23-2/24. 

I wanted to check with you guys before doing anything because your names are the three on the deal numbers she gave me. (Bill entered a purchase annuity from L-Pac - 531549 - for a ramp down.) 

Please let me know if any of this sounds familiar. Thresa said this dispute was filed back in June, so she's eager to get it resolved.

Thanks for your help,
Kate

Looks great.  I have a follow up questions:

It looks like you parsed PGE data into the 4 buckets (Network-ST , Network LT, IT ST, IT LT). Is that true (i.e. 100% of our PGE usage is IT LT) or would disaggregating our usage on PGE require more work?

I know I'm kind of bouncing around, but since we have help, we're working on whatever we can.  The following is what has been found for July 2001, then we should be good:

7/9:  Deal #676569.1 - needs an adder of $0.10, currently shows none (PGE system).  Our day total for our sales is $82,439.88

7/13 & 7/14:  Deal #683299.1 - needs correct index (not NF) of OFF - - day total 7/13 = $55,054.30 & 7/14 = $48,907.74

7/23:  Deal #695822.1 - needs correct index of OFF (day tot=$184,848.56)

7/24:  Deal #697589.1 - needs correct index of OFF (day tot=$56,573.22)

7/25:  Deal #700116.1 - same as 7/24 (day total = $48,997.04)

Totals for PGE Sales:   $2,573,217.72
Totals for PGE Purch   $2,543,124.12

AND THAT'S IT !!!!

We will be having a housewarming party this Friday starting around 5:30.  We will be grilling salmon, burgers, and chicken.  Also I will be opening a double magnum of chardonnay.  If you want something else to eat or drink bring it by and we will put it on the grill or ice.  Email me if you can come and how many are coming.  The following link is the directions to my place from the office:

Sorry for such a delay in my response.  I've been out of the office on a customer tour.  The wheeling rate I'm quoting is under BPA new 2002 Tariff beginning in October 2001.  The wheel would get you from the Mid-Columbia to Garrison, which is BPA's integration with MPC System = 1.013 $/kW-mo plus 1.9 % losses.  Losses are real and need to be returned 168 hours there after.  Hope this helps!  I'm not sure how Mike S. has set the basis of Mid-C to MPC in the curves, but I assume you have access to those anyway!

Hi Diana, I was hoping that you had some information regarding the Mid-C to Montana basis, as well as the wheeling cost associated w/ Mid-C to Montana (Jeffrey Oh told me you'd be the person to go to).  I need these numbers thru 2024 (I understand the back years will be an estimate).  I'd be greatly appreciative if you could give me these numbers.  Thanks so much,

Hello Dave!

Are you the Enron rep. for the WMIC?  The reason I ask is because at times during the WSCC ISAS meeting which I attend, there are market issues that we can't address due to our scope; reliability.  From what I understood, in the past we didn't have anyone attending, but we may now since there are seams issues due to the RTO.  Even outside of the RTO, I believe we need to attend.  Could you please let me know if you're a regular and how many times the group meets?  

Thanks for your help!!

Importance:	High

To All,

Attached to this message is a complete report on issues that are of concern to Enron.  

Below is a highlight version of the key issues contained in the report.  

FERC Seam Technical Conference report by Frank Afranji - Key message - Western RTOs, act now, act responsibly, if you don't FERC will do it for us and impose the PJM model
OASIS Phase II as reported by Jerry Dempsey - Key message - Western entities need to be more pro-active in attending and providing input to the NERC Electronic Scheduling Collaborative otheriwse they run the risk of NERC imposing standards which are not applicable to western RTO development.
Resource Adequacy - aka - Installed Capacity Markets.  NERC is considering California as an example of how the "Market" has failed to provide adequate generating resources to meet the needs of the region.  There are discussions now taking place to consider development of "Resource Adequacy" standards.
RTO Congestion Management Updates - When citing how DSTAR will align closly with RTO West's physical flow-path congestion management paradigm, Jerry Smith of APS publically corrected Mike Raezer and stated that on "Day-One" the DSTAR PTOs are implementing contract path.
West of Hatway - Rating decrease from 2800 to 2200, reasons and remidies along with possible new RAS requirements.
Path Connectivity Map - Does this idea make sense?  What would you like to see added? (Traders input requested)


If you have any questions, concerns or wish to be removed from the distribution list, please contact me.

Kind Regards,

Dave

Not sure if you receive these notices or not.  I know Holli would distribute them occasionally.  I would be happy to do so also.  Just let me know what you would be interested in and who to add to the distribution list!

Hey girl!

I cleaned up December, but I don't like 12/8.  It looks like this is the day that everything went to shit.  Research has to be done.  All other days are good.

I'll keep in touch,

I have primarily looked at our sales to EPMI, so there may be more on our purchase side, but I'll have to let you know at a later time.

12/1:  deal #470853.1 - HE 22 should be 10mw, not 11mw - check presched sheet that EPMI creates (Donnie ?)  - This problem affects both sides.

12/8:  Deal #476161.1 - HE 1 should be 12mw, not 38; HE 2-6 should be 11mw, not 37; HE 23-24 should be 11mw, not 37.  Also, deal #476161.2 - HE 7-16 should be 16mw, not 0; HE 17-22 should be 15mw, not 6.  Mws were changed realtime p/EPMI's request.  This problem affects both sides.

12/19:  EPMI missing from both sales & purchase side:  HE 7-9, 2mw; HE 10-22, 4mw; HE 23 & 24, 1mw.  Check presched sheet - this was PCW interchange.

12/22:  deal#483473.2, HE 15-22, should be 11mw, not 12mw.  Check presched sheet.  This affects both sides (sales & purch).

12/23:  deal #483473.1 & .2, HE 12-22 should be 11mw, not 12.  HE 23 should be 33mw, not 34.  Check presched sheets.  This affects both sides.

Sorry, but that's all I have for now.  I have reviewed Jan & Feb. and think a majority of problems are just incorrect adders on our end.  Once we get thru July checkout, I will dive back into this !

Thanks !

All-

  Per an inquiry from Lousiana Pacific regarding deal # 421598.1 (LT NW):

  Structure: 		7 MW around the clock, 100% load factor. Buy back at basis or remarket at a 70% / 30% split.
  
  February 23, 2001:  	Load was taken from 7 MW to 4 MW for HE 11 - 24.  Deal # 421598.1 was reduced from a 7 MW to a 4 MW (D. Scholtes).
			We remarketed the 3 MW's real time to WWP deal # 530654.1 (source PGE).  We did not enter a deal to keep LP whole.   
  
  February 24, 2001:  	Load was taken from 7 MW to 4 MW for HE 1 - 24.   Deal # 421598.1 was reduced from a 7 MW to a 4 MW (D. Scholtes).
			We remarketed the 3 MW's real time to Puget for HE 1-9 deal # 530689.1 and to WWP for HE 10-24 deal # 530716.1.
			We did not enter a deal to keep LP whole.   
  
 August 29, 2001:  	Virginia set deal # 421598.1 back to 7 MW, keeping sale to LP whole, and entered deal # 754187.1 to buy back 3 MW of LP energy at 70 % of  the 			price sold real time. (70% / 30% split according to agreement with LP). 
			VT routed original purchase from PGE-deal 529161.1 (ST NW) back to Lousiana Pacific-deal # 421598.1 (LT NW) and routed the "buy-back" deal # 			754187.1 (ST W HOURLY) to WWP and to Puget (ST W HOURLY).

  I think that this will properly take care of the dispute and make Lousiana Pacific happy.  Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.


  Thanks,

  Virginia

Your last paragraph is right on man.  It just the commie business practice
that bites.

Again, my view of the world is that the transmission should be associated
with the sink control area - they are the one who takes it home.  The source
control area shouldn't have the fake transmission.

Guess part of the problem is due to CAs not registering as TPs which would
make things much more consistent.

PSEI will take NOR, SINGLEBUS, GF (if we're not looking), MIDC-MIDC, and
other creative entries for the OASIS number for MIDC-MIDC transactions.

First - sorry if you receive this 2 or 3 times and a further apology if you
don't schedule with BPAT - just want to catch as many of you as I can!

Last week we offered a hands on training of our new Customer Web Interface
(CWI).  At this time there are no plans to offer additional training
sessions.
Our current plan is to have one or two customer meetings the week of 9/17
where we will train a large group (no hands on).  The CWI is out on our web
site for customers to review and play with now (test version).  The
following URL should take you directly to the test site.  If you put the
cursor over the word scheduling you'll see the link to "Transmission and
Demand Scheduling".
http://taim-test.transmission.bpa.gov/taim/

If you go out and test it (make sure to print out the User Guide) that will
provide you with an opportunity to do some self-training prior to the
September session(s).  The final date for the CWI customer meeting will be
posted on our OASIS.  I would encourage you to sign up for the e-mail
exploder for updates on future CWI meetings (and all TBL business
practices).  Also, the CWI is still a work in progress so newer versions are
being loaded from time to time.  The User Guide is updated at the same time
and includes a new version number each time a change is made. 

To sign up for the email automatic notification (exploder) go to the
following OASIS location:
www.transmission.bpa.gov/OASIS/BPAT

Select Forums (tab on upper part of the screen); next select Information
Notification; next select E-mail Forum.  Enter your name and email address
and select "Register"

If you have any questions please contact me.  Thank you.

Mike and Caroline-

  Diana has asked that we let her know whenever we have variances, disputes, or make changes to any deals concerning these two counterparties Tacoma and Seattle City Light from today forward.  

  I suggest that we querry weekly for these 2 counterparties in DMS and provide Diana with a PMA report from DMS so that she can read any Settlements and VM comments in DMS about the deal and ask questions accordingly.

  Thanks,

  Virginia

Diana, 
I'll be sending you an itinerary soon.  Cynthia (travel agency) is putting it together right now.  I put the
car under your name.  Hope that's OK.   Times look good, so other then that I wondered if you wanted
to buy a non-refundable ticket or a refundable ticket.  They are about a $120 difference.  I believe one 
price is $304.25 (non-refundable) or $427.25 (refundable)

Let me know what tickets you would like to go with.

Thanks, Jill

Apparently your mother thinks they are coming tomorrow for some reason.  I

driving up on Saturday Aug. 25.

Why don't you fly down Friday night and drive up with me?

This deal was entered incorrectly.  The date span was only for 7/1/01 instead of 7/1 - 7/31.  This annuity represents the $1 charge to move 150 MW on peak to Big Eddy for the month.

Sorry for the inconvenience,

There's a survey being sent around to the WSCC ISAS group regarding a standardization of time.  The circumstances surrounding this survey involve the Day Ahead Scheduling process, timely Net Interchange checkouts between adjacent Control Areas, E-Tagging timelines for submission and assessment.  It comes back to a common time element for all parties to use in the above process and the elimination of the 23 and 25 hour days on the Daylight Saving changes.  Though the times on clock would change, the scheduling times would not.  It is thought that significant time, manpower and operating expense savings can be achieved by implementing a single scheduling time.  But to achieve this, what are the costs associated with implementation.  The area's obvious to me are 1.  Existing Contracts- How to implement these on a forward basis.  2.  Future EOL confirmation processes  3.  Enpower.  

There are no apparent transition issues for Scheduling.  In fact, this will eliminate some for them.  I need to know whether or not we would support this standardization, what the estimated costs associated with this if we do or don't make the change,  and what the implementation issues would be.  I'm sure I haven't covered some, so please forward this to the appropriate people.

Due to scheduling conflicts, the meeting has been moved to Friday October 5 @ 10:00, Mt. Bachelor.  Serena has also mentioned that there are some problems balancing the hour ahead and day ahead Enpower to Caps.  So my guess would be to re-group earlier.

There's an Annuity in the system which reflects the $1 payment instead of changing the deal.  This will reference back to my fix and request for Auto Scheduling.....???

 Diana-

  Per BPA, for deal # 486140.1, the deal was amended 6/29/01 where 150mw of hlh was adjusted from 216.00 to 217.00 for the whole month except 7-4-01nerc holiday.
  Can you or Driscoll verify that this is true?  This will be a ($60,000) impact.

  Thanks,

Sean and Diana:

Just wanna give you a heads up.  From Settlements we learned that there will be -$870,820.56 prior month adjustments in your book due to BPA and Modesto related deals .  I have researched on all the items and believe they are valid.  Please take a look and let me know if you have any questions or concerns.  If you don't disagree you shall expect to see this hit in your P&L for 8/31/01.

 

Please also note that there might be other items to come between now and the end of this month.  I will let you know when that happens.

Thanks,
Fran

Not sure.  It seems to be sporadic.  Another issue is the work load imposed on Cara when she has scheduling conflicts.  She has had to schedule a lot lately.  We'll figure it out ...

On that date we gave you back a total of +$1,202,820.8 in adjustments, including the +$640,000 you are looking for.  For your reference, attached please find the detail sheet (by deal) which shows all adjusments you got on 3/31/01.  If you have any questions or concerns on this, please feel free to let me know.

Subject:	487408 Annuity

Fran - Diana and Sean are looking for a PMA adjustment of 640,000 for the deal below (note from Sean).
Could you look into this .....

Thanks,
Heather





I had a deal with Modesto in December that consisted of a buy-resale with Modesto.  It was a take-or-pay deal.  We did not schedule this deal for 10-days in December (zeroed out in scheduling).  We should have put in an annuity each day we didn't schedule it, but we failed to do so.  At the end of the month, I realized we had not been doing this, so I put in an annuity to Modesto for $1.04 Million (Deal 487408).  This impact was seen in my December P&L.  Towards the middle of January, it was brought to my attention that we were not checking out with Modesto on this deal.  I looked into it, and it turns out I miscalculated how many days we did not schedule the deal, so the annuity should have been for $400,000, not $1,040,000.  On January 23, we modified the annuity to the correct amount.

The question I have now is, where is the $640,000, and do I get this back in the form of a prior month adjustment?

Thanks
Sean

It was suggested by Tim Belden to re-group and analyze the processes in which FSP and Enpower synchronize.  I have set up a tentative date for everyone to meet.  Please let me know if this time is good for all.

Hi Diana,
I checked out Safeco's rate for scheduling jewelry and it's $1.15 per $100
value.  Sorry I mis-spoke earlier - one of the other companies we write for
just had an increase and I was confused.  The annual premium for a $12,000
ring would be $138.
Please let me know if you want me to add the wedding ring.  You could e-mail
me the appraisal or fax it direct to my e-fax at
(413) 683-6970 and I'll follow up.   I went ahead and updated all your
Safeco policies so you'll receive mail directly at your new home.  Please
let me know if I can be of any further assistance.
--Julie
