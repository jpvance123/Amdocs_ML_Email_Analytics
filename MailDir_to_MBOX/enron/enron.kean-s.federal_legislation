 <<73084_3.DOC>>


Please see the attached per Adam Wenner:

Cynthia -- Attached is the transmission legislation we discussed.  Please
note the following:

1.  Revised Sections 201(a) and (b) are not particularly substantive; they
simply correspond the statement of FERC's jurisdiction to our new approach.
The real substance is in the amendments to Section 206.  Consequently, we
might want to exclude the Section 201 changes when we circulate it to those
to whom we're just trying to explain the concepts.

2.  Our prior draft contained exceptions to the prohibitions to the
prohibition on discriminatory treatment, regarding protection of native load
to protect system reliability and to preserve a utility's ability to comply
with state-imposed obligations to serve.  I believe these concepts,
particularly the second, is inconsistent with our new approach, but  before
deleting these, wanted to make sure that there is not a political reason
that we should leave them in.  I have italicized and bolded these
provisions.

Joe and Sarah:  here's the draft bill which Senator Slade Gorton plans to 
introduce on reliability (same as Administration's plus the Northwest 
adjustments)....I am making the argument to the Senator that this is not 
enough, that native load issues also cause reliability problems and am asking 
him to add to his bill.....but, he is in a tough re-election battle (probably 
one of the toughest in the country) so he is acting with extreme caution.

Dear Colleague,

Earlier this month, the Edison Electric Institute published a paper I wrote 
on Bulk-Power Reliability: Potential Problems and Possible Solutions. 
Although aimed at the general reader, I hope you'll find the paper 
interesting. It is available on the Publications page of my website: 
www.EHirst.com.

The key problems I identify include:  

Declining generation reserve margins,  

Declining transmission capacity relative to load, leading to  

Increasing transmission congestion, and  

Growing number and complexity of bulk-power transactions.  

The primary solutions I discuss include:  

Federal legislation to (1) extend FERC authority over the entire bulk-power 
industry for reliability and (2) oversee a single North American reliability 
organization that sets mandatory standards;  

Large regional transmission organizations;  

Decide who decides where and when to build new transmission lines, with 
regional solutions? likely better than local ones; and?  

Expand demand-side participation in energy and ancillary-service markets.  



Please let me know if you have any comments on the paper.

Eric

Steve:  We need to give Ken Lay a heads up and coordinate strategy for a 
phone call he will receive during the  August Congressional recess from 
MidAmerican's CEO David Sokol if the electricity restructuring bill does not 
pass this Congress (which is currently the most likely outcome.)  Mr. Sokol 
will invite Ken Lay to attend a Winter meeting in the west with a few key 
CEO's for the purposes of their coming to the table to complete the consensus 
approach we have already developed within the DOE Stakeholders and the 
MidAmercian Roundtable groups.  The proposed general format would be to have 
Ken Lay, David Sokol, John Rowe, Earl Nye, and Alliant's Davis (i.e. the EEI 
Executive Committee) meet for 1-2 days to forge the consensus framework 
principles for the general bill.  On the third day, they would invite 
Congressman Tauzin, Congressman Dingell, Congressman Barton, Senator 
Murkowski,  Senator Bingaman, etc. to deliver the deal and achieve their 
buy-in.

I  successfully requested that MidAmerican's lobbyist add high tech companies 
to the mix.  Thus, we will have to prepare Ken Lay to ask for these attendees 
and to offer to contact the correct CEO's (i.e. from APX....but if Sun, Cisco 
and other users could be made interested to participate, this would be 
politically helpful.)  Too, in addition to inviting a few essential key 
participants, we should discuss conditions Ken Lay may wish to place on his 
participation (i.e. other than transmission open access and functional 
separation, do we want to ask for something more next Congress?)  Further, we 
will need to debrief him on all the consensus developed here to date on 
interconnection, Private Use, market power, etc.

Because of the change in EEI's leadership this year, they will necessarily 
need to support bill passage next Congress in order to meet John Rowe's 
wishes.  Although we need to prepare Ken Lay, we should keep this 
confidential outside of Enron.  Further,  my notification should not be 
allowed the steal David Sokol's "thunder" when he actually places the call.

Please advise me as to what materials or further information you need from me 
on this matter.  thanks, Cynthia

Linda:  As discussed before, Senate Energy Committee staff have already begun 
meetings to draft the bipartisan Energy Legislation they plan to introduce at 
the beginning of the 107th Congress.  Their bill will focus on three major 
categories including "supply" (including fuel diversity, and consistent 
natural gas prices regardless of world oil prices, etc.); "infrastructure 
development" (including pipeline construction for gas and liquids, eminent 
domain for electricity transmission, reliability including California plus 
heating oil reserves with concerns regarding the mandatory inventory levels 
precedence set by Massachusetts); and "efficiency" (including tax measures, 
renewables and distributed generation.)

They are working off of the 106th Congress bills S. 2557, S. 2904 and tax 
bills such as S. 2718.  In addition, they are meeting with RUS to discuss 
ideas to fund transmission builds in rural areas so as to eliminate capacity 
restraints.  Further, CRS is writing an "options" paper addressing various 
means to stimulate supply. Finally, they are awaiting BLM's official 
"inventory of the public lands available for development" which shall include 
listings of constraints to development, thus, enabling them to draft 
solutions.

They will likely do the tax issues first and then the access issues after but 
this is not set in stone.  Regardless, now is the time for Enron to supply 
input and innovative solutions to address the issues.  I would suggest the 
need to go over the existing legislation; decide which provisions we like and 
don't like plus offer legislative drafting solutions for provisions we deem 
missing.

As such, shall we proceed with a meeting, conference call, etc.??  Please 
advise.  We have the month of January to compile our legislative wish list 
and convey our ideas to staff.  

As an aside, the House is still addressing Committee Chair and staffing 
issues so are not as far along as the Senate.  However,  Chairman Barton 
expects quick action on energy issues in the 107th.  Thanks.

I have read through the 19 pages of Administration comments on the Bingaman draft electricity bill released last month.  Here are the main items in a quick bullet format so you have the flavor of them.

Delete provision on federal jurisdiction over bundled/unbundled (they don't offer a reason).  We of course agree for tactical reasons.

Add a provision to authorize FERC to order wheeling in States that open retail markets.

Add a provision to allow FERC to issue wheeling orders on its own motion based on an informal hearing rather than an adjudicatory hearing as under current law.

Make it clear that the Federal Power Act does not affect the authority of a State to require retail competition (the comments say some utilities have tried to argue that the FPA prohibits states).

The provision giving FERC power to order RTO participation should be deleted.  The comments raise drafting question.

The changes to the FERC merger review sections of the FPA should be limited.

"FERC lite" should be extended only to state municipal utilities and cooperatives, not the Federal utilities.  The FERC should authority over the Federal transmission systems equivalent to FERC authority over public utilities (with special BPA rules).

No need to legislate on market-based rates (we oppose the Bingaman language anyway, so this is helpful).

Interconnection language should be limited to transmission facilities, not local distribution.

No objection to streamlined reliability provision (this is good for us).

Remedial measures for market power should be deleted.

Administration to provide legislative language on federal transmission siting provisions, which they want to retain.

Not convinced there is a need for market transparency rules because FERC and DOE already have enough authority.

Administration supports even tougher criminal penalties.

Recordkeeping under PUHCA repeal should be clarified.

Federal purchase requirement for renewable energy should be deleted.

No objection to real-time pricing standard.

Net metering should be limited to small residential renewable facilities.

Do not support federal renewable portfolio standard (but could clarify state authority to adopt same).

Late last night, the House on a 240-189 vote passed, as amended, H.R. 4 -- the Securing Amerca's Future Energy (SAFE) Act of 2001.  Here is what happened on the three amendments of interest to Enron:

	1.	The House overwhelmingly defeated (154 to 274) a Waxman Amendment (D-CA)  to impose cost of service rates on wholesale sales of electricity in the WSCC for 18 months.  Only three House Republicans supported the amendment (all from California -- Gallegly, Issa and Hunter); 57 Democrats opposed the Waxman Amendment, including all of the Texas Democrats EXCEPT Frost, Hinojosa, Rodriguez and Doggett (these four SUPPORTED the Waxman Amendment).  Thus, our collective lobbying efforts in recent months focusing on California Republicans, Texas Democrats and other moderate Democrats worked out in the end.

	2.	The House also overwhelmingly defeated the Cox Amendment (R-CA) to grant California a waiver of the Clean Air Act's oxygenate requirement for reformulated gasoline.  The vote was 125 to 300 (44 Republicans, 80 Democrats and 1 independent voted for the amendment; 173 Republicans, 126 Democrats and 1 independent) voted against it.

	3.	The House also defeated the Green Amendment (D-TX) to repeal the Natural Gas Act's "Hinshaw Exemption" as it applies to California's intrastate natural gas pipelines.  The vote was 154 to 275 (123 Republicans and 31 Democrats voted for it, while 95 Republicans, 178 Democrats, and 2 independents voted against the amendment).

Please call or e-mail with comments or questions.  The Senate Energy Committee is starting its work this week on an energy package with consideration of an R&D title (other issues will be taken up in September, including electricity).  The House Energy and Commerce Committee will now turn to electricity issues, with staff drafting during the August Recess, hearings in September, and votes on legislation in September or early October.

Steve -- I received your note that you had received Dan's comments.  I
thought it made sense, in any case, to pass on a few comments; Dan probably
had the same thoughts, but just in case here they are:

Section 2(a):  the parenthetical "including the transmission of electric
energy in interstate commerce that is sold at retail", while technically a
correct fix, is still a little troubling.   Just as everyone is someone's
native load customer, all electricity is ultimately sold "at retail."
Nonetheless, this hasn't stopped FERC from concluding that it lacks
jurisdiction over the transmission component of bundled retail service.  The
possibility that this ambiguity could be exploited would be avoided by using
the "transmission component of bundled retail service" language, and
including separate definitions of bundled and unbundled retail service
(rather than "quick and dirty" approach in new section 205(g).

This approach would also get rid of the possible ambiguity in new section
205(g)(1)(A), which requires the filing of a schedule for the "transmission
of electric energy... that is separate from the rates...applicable to the
sale of electric energy and to local distribution."  It is not abundantly
clear that the filed rate schedule must be for the transmission component of
unbundled retail service, although that seems to be the intent of the
drafters.

Section 205(g) uses the "not unduly discriminatory or preferential basis"
standard.  That language, as with the existing Federal Power Act language,
can be interpreted as permitting native load service to maintain its
priority status in all situations, on the basis that it is not "undue"
discrimination to favor those who paid for the system or the other usual
defenses of this approach.  Language similar to that we have worked on
previously, which makes it absolutely clear that no native load preference
is permitted, would eliminate this possible result.

Similarly, it would be useful, in section 205(g)(5), to make it clear that
the transmission of bundled service must be reserved and scheduled on
exactly the same basis as unbundled service; as written, this provision
might be interpreted as not so requiring.

If Enron accepts the preference for "firm wholesale and retail customers" in
Section 205(g)(6), it should revise the language to make it clear that this
is a "one-time" preference, and that, with respect to future service,
transmission customers are to be placed on equal footing.  This might be
done be including a specific cut-off, such as "Any such rule shall cease to
be applicable no later than one year after the date such rule takes effect."

Section 2(f) permits transmission rates to be capped at the rate set by the
State commission.  This approach leaves open the option for States which
have, or which, as part of the establishment of retail competition, to set
transmission rates at a higher than cost-justified level, and to subsidize
the sale price of their owned generation or purchased power from that
subsidy.  Such an approach would put marketers at a severe disadvantage.  I
suggest including a prohibition against such subsidization.

Cynthia:  here is the comment I would forward to Senators Gramm and Schumer 
concerning their provision on "Environmental Conditionality".

Sorry this was thrown together very quickly on short notice, but I hope it is 
helpful.


Section 154:  Environmental Conditionality

In general, as this provision attempts to close the loophole for 
grandfathered (pre 1977) coal plants, there would be an negative impact on 
coal trading (particularly high-sulfur) and our equity positions in coal 
mines.  However, there are opportunities to still profit by shorting/hedging 
our positions -- if we have enough knowledge and information about when these 
changes are going to take place, we will likely be able to seize 
opportunities from the resulting volatility.

The question in your e-mail asked only about coal markets, but on the whole,  
Enron could find some benefits from this kind of provision because of our 
ability to trade more gas, transport more gas, and build merchant 
gas/combined cycle capacity, renewables, etc.  I have not had the chance to 
get any analysis on electricity prices, but I would suspect that our view 
would be that there may be some volatility due to the shift in fuels but it 
would level out with the right risk management in the longer term -- I can 
try to get more for you as this legislation evolves.

Specific comments on the drafting, section-by-section:

(a)  the only comment I would raise is that how the term "electric generating 
unit (EGU)" is defined is controversial right now.  The EPA wants to make 
sure EGU includes industrial boilers -- this point is being litigated in the 
NOx SIP Call and Section 126 cases right now.   Unless it was the intent to 
also capture industrial coal boilers in this Section, it may be wise to 
clarify that you are targeting utilities.   Industrials will raise a great 
deal of opposition if this provision is construed to include them.

(b)  It probably does not make a great deal of difference whether you are 
taking the average capacity factor for "coal fired" vs. "fossil" -- averaging 
all fossil units will create an average capacity factor that makes it a 
little harder for coal to meet environmental performance standards.   I 
believe the 1990-1999 average capacity factor for all fossil/coal plants 
would be around 65%.  Large, heavily-loaded coal plants are probably in the 
70-80% range, so they would have to cut back substantially.   However, some 
of the older interim load coal plants may only run at about 65% or less, in 
which case they may still emit a substantial amount of pollution but not be 
captured under this provision.   So in effect, this section may not limit all 
grandfathered coal plants, just the big ones.

(c)  I don't know if this is a drafting oversight, or an attempt to set the 
bar unreasonably high for coal, but including the word ALL in the phrase 
"average emission performance achieved by ALL electric generating units" 
would mean including gas and other clean sources in looking at emissions 
averages -- which no coal unit could ever meet.   In the name of workability, 
hopefully they will include something like "achieved by all COAL FIRED 
electric generating units"

Subject: Gramm/Schumer federal Electricity Legislation: URGENT REQUEST FOR 
COMMENT


	

Jeff:  As we have discussed for some time now, Senators Gramm (R-TX) and 
Schumer (D-NY) have been drafting federal electricity restructuring 
legislation with a date-certain approach.  The one hold-up has been the 
environmental conditionality provision which we have also discussed at length 
in the past.  Just late last evening the two Senators reached initial 
agreement on this section, and, as such, just late this morning, both offices 
sent the language to us for our immediate comment and review.  Specifically, 
they would like Enron's read on the practical impact of this language by 4:00 
p.m. EST as they intend to introduce the bill this evening before the Senate 
breaks for the July 4th holiday.  I'm sorry for the short turn around, but as 
you know, this is the typical situation in D.C.

The language in parenthesis indicates Gramm's edits to substitute 
"coal-fired" vs. Shumer's (NRDC's) preference for "fossil."  What is our 
preference based upon what his means to coal markets and the ability for coal 
to ramp up or not to ramp up?  Please provide any written comments as soon as 
possible.  Many thanks and please let me know if you have any questions.

Section 154:  Environmental Conditionality
 (a)  In this section a noncompliant unit means a (coal-fired) electric 
energy generation unit for which construction was commenced prior to August 
7,1977 that does not comply with requirements relating to emissions of air 
pollutants as determined in subparagraph (c).
 (b)  It shall be unlawful for the owner of noncompliant unit to operate such 
unit in any year at a capacity factor that exceeds the lesser of the average 
capacity (factor) for fossil (coal-fired) electric energy generation units in 
operation in the United States or the average capacity factor for such unit, 
based on information reported to the Commission for the years 1990 through 
1999.
 (c)  Within six months of enactment of this section, the Administrator shall 
publish emission levels equal to the average emission performance achieved by 
all electric generating units permitted pursuant to Section 165 and Section 
172 of the Clean Air Act and prior to the date of enactment of this section.
 (d)  No later than six months of (after) enactment, the Administrator shall 
promulgate a list of electric energy generation units for which construction 
was commenced prior to August 7, 1977.
 (e)  This section takes effect on the date that is 2 years after the date of 
enactment of this Act.

Late this morning, the House Energy and Commerce Committee adoped the 
committee print, as amended, of an energy package that addresses 
conservation, clean coal, renewables, hydro, nuclear, and boutique fuels.  
The vote was 50 to 5 to report the bill.  Other committees -- Ways and Means, 
Science, and Resources -- also moved their energy bills this week.  Thus, the 
House is on track to consider a merged package before the start of the August 
Recess on August 3rd.

As to electricity, during the several days of debate this week both Chairmen 
Tauzin and Barton reaffirmed their intention to next move to electricity 
issues.  Mr. Barton's staff advised me this morning that the subcommittee he 
chairs will hold a hearing on Friday, July 20th on all electricity issues 
other than transmission.  While Mr.  Barton has publicly held out hope of 
marking up an electricity bill this month, sources on and off the committee 
do not see this timetable as realistic.  On the Senate side, the majority 
staff is working on an electricity "white paper" that may be circulated for 
comment next week.

Below is a recap of action on amendments of interest to Enron:

1. Last night, on a largely partisan vote (with Democrats Hall, Green and 
John voting with the Republicans) the Committee rejected an amendment by Rep. 
Jane Harman (D-CA) (that was to have been offered by Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-CA)) 
that would have retroactively amended the FERC refund date and essentially 
ordered refunds regardless of amounts owed to power sellers.

2. First thing this morning the Committee, again on a largely partisan basis 
(with Democrats Hall, Green, John and Towns), rejected a Waxman amendment to 
impose cost-of-service rates on all power in the West (other than generation 
added after 1/1/01).  (Originally, Mr. Waxman was going to offer amendment to 
impose cost-of-service rates only on those who do not supply all available 
power during an emergency, but he ended up offering basically what he had 
pursued in subcommittee on the old "Californa Only" bill.)

3. The Committee adopted an amendment by Rep. Shadegg to amend the Natural 
Gas Act to make it clear that a natural gas "transportation facility" shall 
not be added to the National Register of Historic Places until FERC has 
abandoned the facility.  Apparently there have been some instances of "old" 
pipelines being considered as "historic places" under federal law.  The House 
Resources Committee added a similar amendment to its package yesterday.

4. By voice vote, the Committee rejected a Waxman Amendment to require the 
president to propose and implement a plan to bring U.S. greenhouse gases down 
to 1990 levels.  There was strong opposition voiced by many Republicans and 
Democrats to this amendment.

5. By mixed vote of 24 to 29, the Committee defeated a Waxman Amendment to 
set cost and performance goals for renewables, including wind power, and 
authorize federal funds to assist with commercial project costs (up to 50 
percent).

Linda requested some background and talking points on the pending RTO letter from Chairman Tauzin to FERC that is sitting on Chairman Barton's desk TODAY for his decision whether to co-sign the letter.  While we have not seen the text, we are told that it is "anti-RTO" and may go so far as to state or imply that FERC does not have authority to do what is doing with RTOs.  (We know this is the view of one of Chairman Tauzin's counsels, who formerly worked for Southern Co.).  Chairman Tauzin has been contacted by Entergy and the Louisiana Public Service Commission to send the letter.  I spoke to Chairman Barton's staff, Andy Black, this afternoon and relayed our concerns.  The Barton Subcommittee is now expected to mark up an electricity bill in December (per a Republican Member meeting held this morning).

ACTION ITEM:		Call Rep. Joe Barton (202/225-2002)

TALKING POINTS:

	1.	Should start with something about the Dynegy/Enron transaction (it will be strange if Mr. Lay or Steve calls 
Chairman Barton and does not start the conversation with some reference to the transaction).

	2.	Mentioning the transaction naturally leads into the importance of competitive wholesale markets for power,
both for consumers and for the largely Texas-based marketing, trading and merchant power industries.

	3.	We understand that Chairman Barton has been approached by Chairman Tauzin about a letter to FERC on the RTO issue.  We know Chairman Barton is well aware of Enron's strong support for FERC's RTO initiatives.  We respect Chairman Barton's interest in seeing to it that Congress does not abdicate its responsibility to make energy policy.

	4.	If, as we have been lead to believe, the letter states or implies that FERC does not have authority to act in the RTO arena, this will be seen as a potentially destabilizing development since FERC is so far down the road of creating RTOs.

	5.	While we understand some in Congress and elsewhere were concerned that FERC was moving too fast, as of the last FERC meeting earlier this month, that is no longer true even if it ever was true.  While we think RTOs should be created sooner rather than later, FERC is listening to state regulators and others who had concerns.

	6.	A letter from congressional leaders questioning FERC's authority goes too far in the direction of those who oppose any RTOs.  Furthermore, it is wrong as a matter of law.  The D.C. Circuit held in the gas cases and in the power cases on Order 888 that FERC has authority to address systemic discrimination, which is in large part what the RTOs are all about -- a remedy for iscrimination.

Leaving voicemail with two comments: 1 ) Demand buydown: establish 
participation threshold of 20 kw...residential inclusion is unnecessary and 
will draw additional fire........2) Eliminating undue discrimination: we 
should make clear that non-discrimination means all uses of transmission

non-discriminatory manner. Thanks.

Yesterday, the Federal Trade Commission issued a staff report on electricity restructuring issues.  It is an update of the July 2000 report done at the request of House Energy Chairman Tauzin and Subcommittee Chairman Barton.  They requested the report be updated.  A summary of the report and the full 80+ page text is on the FTC web site at www.ftc.gov on the upper left side of the home page.

I read the summary and will read the balance.  So far, so good.  It basically says that even states that have opened up to retail competition are in transition with a hybrid of regulation and competition, thus the expected benefits of competition have not yet emerged.  However, the report states that nothing to date indicates that competition, once the transition period is over, will not produce additional benefits for consumers.  The report's major conclusion is that competitive wholesale markets are important to achieving effective competition in retail markets.  

The summary includes something that sounds promising on RTO policy, saying "And as wholesale and retail markets become regional, governing policies and jurisdictional approaches also must move in that direction for wholesale and retail competition to be successful."

DJ Senate Energy Chairman Vows Elec Dereg Bill By July 4
Dow Jones News Service -- April 27, 2000  [Return to Headlines]
By Bryan Lee


WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--The U.S. Senate Energy Committee will send
electricity reform legislation to the full Senate before July 4, Sen. Frank
Murkowski, R- Alaska, told reporters Thursday.

The committee chairman made the pledge after holding the last of three
legislative hearings to consider electric industry reform bills pending
before Congress.

Murkowski said the bill will focus on those issues the committee and
interested parties agree on. The next step for the committee will be to
develop a "spreadsheet" delineating those consensus issues.

"We'll have a bill out of committee before the fourth of July," Murkowski
said, when pressed for a timetable.

However, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., has offered no
assurances that he will make floor time available for debate of the measure,
Murkowski said.

The committee chairman said he has discussed the issue with Lott, and that
the leader would consider the issue once the committee has indeed reported
out a bill.

Mark:  I just wanted you to be made aware of the document Southern Company is 
giving to the press (Key Principles).  The "Moler" document is what they are 
circulating to the Hill.  Their response is to the Tabors piece, Secretary 
Richardson's reliability message and to upset the MidAmerican compromise 
consensus transmission language.  We are preparing a point by point rebuttal 
piece which I will forward to you upon completion.

Ginger:  would you please distribute the following memo to the Government 
Affairs group.  Thank you!

Congress continues to advance the Electricity Restructuring Legislative 
debate.  On Tuesday, June 20th, the Senate Energy Committee plans to mark-up 
and pass Senator Gorton's Reliability bill including the consensus state 
savings clause language.  Attached below (attachment 6-17 jt.st.wpd) is the 
46 page joint Senate staff draft which represents agreement in many areas, 
but the differences remain significant.  No agreement was reachable at this 
time in Committee on the extent of FERC jurisdiction to prevent unreasonable 
differences between wholesale and retail service nor reached on the RPS.   
Although the 46 page draft includes language on PURPA, Reciprocity ,Consumer 
Protection, Interconnection, etc.; currently only two Senators support the 
additional language included in the 46 pages; thus, the only chance of moving 
through the Senate Energy Committee this year is to pass Reliability-only 
now.  With the make-up of the Senate Energy Committee, our strategy is "to do 
no harm" in committee thus, making the reliability language-only option 
acceptable as a means to an end.  Enron does support the Reliability bill but 
we will insist on adding transmission access and functional separation 
language later in the process while EEI will insist on adding PUHCA while 
APPA will insist on adding Private Use (thus, we can see what the final 
consensus will look like; plus we have been involved in drafting the 
consensus in all these provisions.....but timing and sequence are crucial.)

It might be helpful to remind everyone that the bills leading up to the 
Energy Policy Act of 1992 as passed by the Committees were also amended in 
Conference since it was impossible to garner the necessary Committee votes or 
survive a Senate filibuster with any Committee-included wheeling language.  
Transmission wheeling/ access language was successfully added in Conference.  
Thus, the sequence of adding our necessary provisions remains key to a 
successful strategy then as it does now.

Also attached is Chairman Bliley's Reliability and Transmission discussion 
draft (section by section, summary and 005_PDF).  This is the foundation from 
which he is willing to add additional consensus amendments. From Enron's view 
,this foundation draft is our exact wish list to clarify FERC jurisdiction 
over both bundled and unbundled transmission (although we have suggested a 
few technical drafting points which have already been conveyed to staff.)  It 
is important for all of us to convey our support for this draft as the 
essential foundation for the bill.  Mark-up  will likely be scheduled to 
occur during  the week of June 26th.

It is important to note that Subcommittee Chairman Barton is philosophically 
opposed to the Bliley/Enron "pro-FERC" approach.  As such, he has asked Texas 
PUC Chairman Pat Wood and Oklahoma Corporate Commission Chairwoman Denise 
Bode to draft a compromise to lighten the FERC authority in favor of a more 
Regional Approach.  I just got off the phone with Pat who walked me through 
the draft he was submitting this evening to Barton (once it is officially 
transmitted, I will be able to get a copy to you, likely on Monday or 
Tuesday.)  From Pat's description, we should be able to be supportive since 
he shares our views about  wholesale markets needing federal authority.   He 
discussed a draft that mandates RTO participation, a seven point mandatory  
RTO test  filed at FERC in 60 days after enactment, Ratemaking established by 
the state but allowing FERC appeal, allowing FERC appeal if 2/3rd's 
disagree,  State authority but also ongoing FERC authority with an expedited 
dispute resolution process.  The seven point mandatory filing details are 1.  
full wholesale competition under the same terms, rates and conditions; 2. RTO 
sole functional control of transmission; 3. functional separation of 
generation from transmission; 4. curtailment on non-discriminatory basis; 5. 
all transmission uses disclosed and transparent (889); 6. constant assessment 
of construction needs; and 7.  remedy and emergency authority for dispute 
resolution.  He mentioned Denise's insistence for interconnection on a 
non-discriminatory basis which he feels is adequately addressed in their 
draft.

>From Pat's discussions with Reliant on his draft, they again spoke in support 
of Enron's transmission open access goals.  TXU remains concerned that ERCOT 
will be pulled under FERC jurisdiction in the draft.  But, it is Pat's view 
that this already has happened under the state law.

Our goal next week is to lock-in bipartisan House Committee support and House 
Leadership support for the mark-up plus tighten the mark-up process so it is 
transparent to all; plus to pass the Senate Committee bill.   A bill to meet 
our established goals is still doable this year.  My strategy was always 
based upon the necessity to lead with the reliability language in order  to 
create a legislative vehicle for us to include our non-discriminatory 
transmission access provisions.    Please call should you need clarification 
or have questions.  Many thanks for your continued support.

Subject: draft Gramm-Schumer Electricity bill

Today, by either fax, messenger, or hand-delivery, you will receive the 37 
page draft electricity deregulation bill to be introduced next week by 
Senators Gramm (R-TX) and Schumer (D-NY).  We have until Friday, April 28th, 
3:00p.m. EST to offer our legal technical changes.  If you can return your 
comments to me (hand-written comments on the document itself are fine), I 
will communicate them directly to the Senators' offices.    

WE MUST KEEP THIS DOCUMENT COMPLETELY CONFIDENTIAL FOR OUR INTERNAL USE 
ONLY.  WE SHOULD NOT COMMENT TO PRESS OR OTHERS THAT WE KNOW THE DOCUMENT 
EXISTS, NOR SHOULD WE DISCUSS THAT WE ASSISTED IN ITS WRITING.  THE POLITICS 
REQUIRE THIS COURSE OF ACTION.

Next week, after the bill is introduced, I recommend we make public comment 
in support of the legislation as it continues to move the process forward 
towards bill enactment this Congress.

The bill contains a date certain of 1/1/2002; stranded cost recovery 
language; PURPA 210 repeal, the bundled FERC authority for interstate 
transmission and reliability plus the non-discrimination language we 
successfully lobbied for and about which Congressman Barton is already aware 
of Senator Gramm's support for Enron's position, PUHCA repeal, environmental 
conditionality and tax provisions for publics, coop's and nuclear 
decommissioning.  Although we successfully drafted and communicated our 
transmission language to the Senators, their attorneys have made language 
adjustments (pride of authorship) which our attorneys should confirm have not 
caused material defect.  If so, we can suggest drafting changes by this 
Friday.

All the language you have has been agreed to by both Senators.  The section 
missing, the environmental provision, is the last section the two men will 
work out this week and will be essential to final bill passage.  Their goal 
remains addressing the grandfathered coal facilities and their disagreements 
are technical in nature.  Namely:  do you disqualify pre-1971 constructed 
coal facilities at a percentage responsible for a percentage of emissions (a 
Republican approach) or do you qualify facilities which can operate ( a 
regulatory approach favored by the Democrats)?  With the Bush/Gore 
Presidential race in full swing, this issue brings ramifications and politics 
to bear at the highest level.

As a further update on this issue:  tomorrow the Senate holds a hearing on 
this issue with all four of the FERC Commissioners testifying, the 
Mid-American group and the DOE Pro-Competition Stakeholder group are meeting 
with each other to gain further consensus, plus both are meeting with NARUC's 
Chuck Grey and Chris Mele to seek consensus.  I will attend all these 
meetings for Enron and report back our continued progress.  Further, we are 
scheduling Dr. Tabors and Enron's Bob Schultz for a Congressional Hill 
briefing next week to discuss Dr. Tabors' research on the price spike as 
proof Congress must make structural changes to the interstate rules plus 
demonstrate Enron On-Line's ability to show market price inefficiency.  
Finally, we will participate in a "team drafting" exercise with MidAmerican 
on their compromise right of first refusal transmission language with Dan 
Watkiss as our representative, with others represented by Bill Sherman, Besty 
Moler and Randy Davis.  This is an effort to include the Bennett Johnston ACE 
group into the MidAmerican fold.  We did get MidAmerican to add the 
separation of market and transmission function language in the context of the 
RTO language.

Much progress continues even though the House is not in session this week.  
The month of May will provide opportunities for Enron to continue 
intensifying our legislative efforts.  To date, the strategy we at Enron laid 
out months ago is playing out with the two tracks of consensus and 
reliability crisis both receiving traction.  We just need the dominoes we 
successfully laid out the strategy for months ago to continue falling.

Please feel free to call me should you need additional information or have 
any questions.

Subject: CQ Weekly article on electricity restructuring

Here's the electronic version of the electricity restructuring article that 
will appear in Monday's CQ Weekly in case you would like to forward (there is 
a hard copy in your box).

CQ WEEKLY - ENERGY 
Apr. 22, 2000 
Page 949 
Pressure Surges to a New High To Legislate Electric> Deregulation
By James C. Benton, CQ Staff 
At the dawn of the year, it seemed Congress would be content to let the 
current session end without moving legislation to encourage further 
deregulation of the nation's $220 billion <electric> market. But developments 
in the past few weeks suggest that groups interested in seeing deregulation, 
as well as the Clinton administration, are building a consensus that will put 
pressure on Congress to move some kind of bill this year.
On April 6, a group called the <Electricity> Restructuring Stakeholders -- 
representing consumers, <electric> generating companies, senior citizens and 
others -- released a set of goals they believe should be included in 
restructuring legislation. The principles include repeal of the Public 
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (<PUHCA>) and changes to a 1978 law (PL 
95-617) that required state utility commissions and <utilities> to reform 
their <electric> rates and take other measures to even out daily <electric> 
consumption. (1978 CQ Almanac, p. 639)
The group plans to meet with environmental groups and regulators to identify 
other areas where common ground can be reached, said Joe Nipper, chief 
lobbyist for the American Public Power Association.
A smaller trade group, composed mainly of investor-owned <utilities>, is 
working on its own set of principles.
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson acknowledged the stakeholder progress in an 
April 17 speech to the National Energy Marketers Association, and he urged 
Congress to pass an <electric> restructuring bill.
"Our interstate <electricity> markets are in need of repair," Richardson 
said, adding that <transmission> access and generation capacity are 
decreasing as demand for <electricity> grows. "If Congress fails to act -- 
and act soon -- on restructuring legislation, it will strangle the 
development of competitive <electricity> markets."
The two committee chairmen who will have to spearhead a restructuring plan 
have stated their intent to pass a bill by the end of the 106th Congress. But 
they must navigate past obstacles that include the compressed calendar, 
election-year politics and a general lack of knowledge among their colleagues 
on how to rewrite or repeal <PUHCA>.
On April 27, Senate Energy Chairman Frank H. Murkowski, R-Alaska, will hold 
the last of three hearings on eight <electric> deregulation-related measures.
On the House side, retiring Commerce Committee Chairman Thomas J. Bliley Jr., 
R-Va., has vowed to work toward enacting a bill (HR 2944) to encourage 
further state deregulation of the <electric> utility market. That measure, 
which would effectively allow consumers to buy their power from anyone, not 
just the nearest utility, was approved by the House Commerce Subcommittee on 
Energy and Power on Oct. 27. (CQ Weekly, p. 478; 1999 CQ Weekly, p. 2599)
The bill also would give states the authority to handle their transition to a 
competitive market but contains no deadline, or "date certain," by which 
states would have to restructure.
Moving a Senate Bill
Some are skeptical that the political and practical hurdles can be overcome 
this year. For example, while they have made progress on principles, the key 
negotiators -- representing investor-owned <utilities>; <electric> 
cooperatives; municipal <electric> <utilities>; large <electricity> 
consumers; labor unions, and environmental groups -- still must reach 
consensus on details the legislation should address, as well as the 
legislative language to implement any agreement.
"I think the chances of getting a bill enacted this year are low, not from 
the lack of trying," Nipper said.
The best chance appears to lie in the Senate, where Murkowski's committee is 
considering eight bills. "I am committed to getting something meaningful out 
of my committee," Murkowski said in an April 14 interview. Murkowski 
acknowledged, though, that the congressional schedule and narrow consensus on 
each of the bills pose challenges to his goal -- developing a comprehensive 
deregulation bill, not one that only addresses portions of <electric> 
restructuring.
The path in the House appears more difficult, although one key supporter said 
there is behind-the-scenes movement.
Bliley has promised to hold a markup of HR 2944 before Memorial Day, and he 
has named a task force of six members to help move the bill through committee.
Joe L. Barton, R-Texas, the sponsor of HR 2944, said meetings are taking 
place among Bliley, Republican House staffers and some interested groups. 
"There is some action; it's just not visible," Barton said late last month. 
"I think what's happening there is that [stakeholders are] jockeying for 
position."
Barton said he anticipated that a "fairly good bill" could be moved by the 
middle of May if stakeholders and members come together.
One complication: Democrats, in the midst of the battle to regain control of 
the House, may not move toward a consensus with Republicans. Staff aides for 
several Democratic members have already complained they have not heard from 
the committee staff in trying to work out differences raised in subcommittee.
But others point to a 1992 energy law (PL 102-486) that cleared Congress in 
the weeks before that year's election. It contained provisions allowing <
utilities> and independent producers to compete in the wholesale power 
market; that law has been credited with the current wave of deregulation in 
some markets. So far, 25 states and the District of Columbia have either 
restructured their markets or enacted laws to begin retail competition in 
coming years. (1992 Almanac, p. 231)
Mark Stultz, a spokesman for the <Electric> <Power> Supply Association, a 
group of competitive power suppliers and power marketers, said the 1992 law 
was enacted after the <electric> industry quickly built up a consensus among 
members and educated them on what the bill would do.
"The industry was able to access that in a very short time," Stultz said. As 
far as getting a restructuring bill through this year, Stultz said it is "not 
an impossible, unrealizable goal to assume that we could get consensus," 
since key stakeholders have reached agreement on several issues. They include 
blocking "market power" -- the ability of a few companies to stunt 
competition by effectively using its assets to manipulate the deregulated 
market to its advantage.
While the House bill contains many issues stakeholders agree with, Stultz 
said it also contains some fatal flaws. He cited as an example its lack of 
federal agency jurisdiction over "bundled" services in a regulated market, in 
which <electric> generation, <transmission> and distribution rates are 
combined in an <electric> bill, and "unbundled" services in a deregulated 
market, in which the generation rates are broken apart from <transmission> 
and distribution rates and other temporary charges brought on by deregulation 
are included.
Best Bets in the Senate
Of the eight bills pending in the Senate, Nipper said the one with the best 
chance of passing is S 2071, sponsored by Slade Gorton, R-Wash., which is 
intended to encourage greater <electric> <reliability>. Nipper said the 
Gorton bill would replace the North American <Electric> <Reliability> 
Council, a group in which utility participation is voluntary, with the <
Electric> <Reliability> Organization, a board that would require 
participation by <utilities>. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission would 
have jurisdiction over the board, as well as the power to enforce its 
policies on <utilities>.
The reliability issue is likely to intensify in coming months, due to 
problems <electric> <utilities> faced each of the past two summers. While 
some plants were undergoing needed maintenance, some <utilities> were caught 
with their generation capacity down during periods of extremely high demand. 
The resulting shortage triggered a spike in bulk <electric> prices, driving 
the price of a megawatt-hour of <electricity> in a few places from $30 to as 
high as $7,000. <Utilities> enforced rotating blackouts on customers, asked 
consumers to reduce <electric> use and passed on surcharges for the higher 
cost of <electricity>.
Hoping to avoid outages this summer, the Department of Energy has scheduled 
four regional "summits" on <electric> <reliability> on April 24 and 28.
Jim Owen, a spokesman for the Edison <Electric> Institute, said a third 
consecutive summer of service interruptions and significant price increases 
could motivate Congress to move on the deregulation bill. "It might push this 
thing up further on the congressional radar screen," although a law enacted 
immediately would not have a quick impact on generation and <transmission> 
reliability, he said.
Other thorny issues include:
? How to handle taxation issues between publicly owned <utilities>, <electric
> cooperatives and municipal <utilities>, and whether <utilities> should 
voluntarily join, or be forced to join, "regional <transmission> 
organizations" designed to allow more efficient transfer of <electricity> 
across the national grid.
? Whether the federal government should be involved in regulating the 
interstate <transmission> of <electric> <power>. Some stakeholders argue 
federal regulation is necessary to prevent one state or region from 
protecting its customers at the expense of others.
? Environmental groups' desire for stronger anti-pollution restrictions on <
utilities> that produce pollutants while generating <electricity>. And labor 
groups, wary that deregulation could trigger massive layoffs through 
corporate mergers and acquisitions, want to make sure their union members are 
protected.

The attached from EPSA is reportedly the detailed outline of the Administration's electricity bill that hit the street late yesterday and today.  I am awaiting confirmation that this is it, but it appears to be.  One more proposal to crank into the mix.

5-6 of the January 13 draft (attached to Allison's previous email and

mark halperin is the political director at abc -- the smart guy sitting to
peter jennings's right all night on election night who knew everything. his
brother is a speechwriter at the nsc. you'll see below his recommendation of
mark katz and his number.

i also emailed peggy noonan to ask for any ideas. haven't heard from her
yet. she's been very busy writing some of the more brilliant commentary on
the current situation which i'm sure hasn't been allowed into the shapiro
empire.

speaking of stock prices, what the hell happened yesterday? i'm still a

your level of apologizing was not necessary but after re-reading my initial

just don't want to break one of the only flows of insider information that i
have left -- even if it's into a has-been.

but while i have you gravelling, you could do something for me. i just got a
call from my old boss at enron and he is looking to hire someone as a
consultant who specializes in humor writing. they want to try a humorous
approach in taking on the monopoly utilities in the battle over electricity
deregulation. do you know anyone in the clinton administration who has been
responsible for some of the president's humorous speeches? or anyone that
fits this bill? what about your brother? it seems like i read a profile of
one of them recently who was leaving. the only republican i can think of is
landon parvin who has been around forever.

two people here did stupid things (first me, by in a hurry giving

colleague for sending it to somebody untrustworthy)

so: i apologize...being in a hurry is no excuse for being careless.....

here's the silver linings:

1. gma seems to have gotten it some other way later in the day, so from
there point of view, they aren't focused on where it came from
2. there is literally no one at abc who knows i know you
3. i give you my word that i will never be at all careless with anything
from you again, and won't let even one person have access to
emails/information from you...the person in this case doesn't know it came
from you (or jb for that matter, since i had already taken her name and your
name off of it)

again, i'm sorry.....i have zero tolerance for such carelessness, and
pleading being overwhelmed with work on the story is no excuse

We have a leak.

I suspect someone in total innocence is forwarding my e-mails to friends and

If we can't find it, these e-mails will cease and desist.

Craig Gannet reports:


 I talked to Rich Glick this morning about the rumored
Administration rulemaking on reliability.  Rich said that it will be a
notice of inquiry, not a proposed rulemaking.  The NOI will essentially ask
three questions: (1) should DOE issue a proposed rule? (2) Does DOE have the
legal authority to do so?  (3)  if DOE should issue a rule and has the
authority to do so, what should be included in the rule?  The NOI will not
contain any proposed language.  The comment period will be 45 days, and Rich
does not expect this Adminstration to act on this issue.  In effect, he
said, they are simply teeing the issue up for the next Administration.
(This assumes that the pending reliability legislation is not passed during
the upcoming lame duck session, which I think is a pretty safe assumption.)
Rich said that the NOI is on Secretary Richardson's desk, and is likely to
be signed tomorrow.

Steve:  the ACE language has been modified somewhat from the original form 
which you have indeed seen before but not enough modification so as to 
correspond to FERC Order 2000.  The question being put is what amendments 
would be necessary to the ACE language to satisfy Enron's needs given the 
reluctance of ACE to either accept 1.) generic language so the Order 
prevails, nor to accept 2.) exact specific language to detail precisely Order 
2000.  Are there items in 2000 we could give up in the legislative language?  
Otherwise, ACE believes due to their support from Commissioner Hubert and the 
general political weakness of FERC, that their existing language has the 
votes in Committee to in effect overturn portions of Order 2000.  ACE's 
willingness to accept any changes to their language has resulted from our 
overall effective strategy.  However, the question now is what precisely do 
we ask for and what is the order of importance of our requests?  Many thanks.

Subject: MidAmerican RTO drafting re: Alliance Language

The message below is from the MidAmerican group:  
I have attached the ACE Group's transmission language.  At the meeting
yesterday, it became clear that the very generic language we have discussed
was not going to work for enough folks.  Cynthia Sandherr suggested an
alternative approach that would be more detailed, but would track Order No.
2000 as closely as possible.

Cynthia Stinger volunteered that Randy Davis had put much of the standards
section of Order 2000 in legislative language, but also added a number of
issues that are not in 2000.  Obviously, some of these provisions (and
possibly some that are in Order 2000) will be unacceptable to some in the
group.  When you have an opportunity, please take a look at this and give me
your best objective judgment on what here is acceptable and what is not for
your organization.

Obviously, we would have to add at the beginning the language that was in
the original proposed draft language on RTOs re: 1) "adopt rules requiring
the formation of regional transmission organizations and prescribing the
minimum characteristics and functions of such organizations," and 2) "order
a transmitting utility operating within a region to participate in a
regional transmission organization to remedy undue discrimination or
anti-competitive effects" that is already agreed to.

I will be leaving town at about 3:00 PM tomorrow, but would like to get
ideas on schedules for activity.  Please try to forward to me your first
impressions on the RTO language before then.  I will forward comments to
Betsy and Brent Gale in my company to see if we can have a draft ready when
I return on Thursday morning.

I would like to hold another meeting of the group on Friday morning of next
week, or alternatively, we could meet over lunch on Friday.  Please let me
know of any preferences in that regard.

Second, I would like to hold a joint meeting with the other stakeholder
group on Monday at 11:00.  I will confirm this next week.  The purpose of
the meeting will be to go over legislative drafts on market power and RTOs
(hopefully they will be ready).

Tuesday, June 6th, I think we should devote the full day to lobbying Senate
offices (Thursday and Friday of the previous week are possibilities also).

Thursday, June 8th, I will set up meetings with key House offices.

I know everyone will not be able to do all of these, but as always if you
can do a meeting, it's a great help.

Please get back to me with comments on the RTO language as soon as possible.

Thanks,

Tom

Update:  Senator Phil Gramm placed a hold on the S. 2071 late, late last 
evening in order to preserve his options to serve on the Conference with a 
broader House bill version.  The Senate should go out for the July 4th recess 
this evening so consideration of this bill on the Senate floor will be 
deferred until their return the week of July 10th.  Senators Gramm and 
Schumer also intend to introduce their electricity restructuring bill this 
evening.

Subject: S. 2071, Senator Gorton's Reliability bill

Late this afternoon, the Senate "hotlined" S. 2071, Senator Gorton's (R-WA) 
Reliability legislation.   Thus, this bill is likely to  be passed by the 
Senate and referred to the House under unanimous consent late this evening or 
tomorrow at the latest.  This provides a Conference vehicle with the House.  
Senator Gramm intends to hold his PUHCA bill from Senate floor consideration 
until the House acts.

During the week of July 10th, the House plans full Commerce Committee mark-up 
of H.R. 2944, the Subcommittee passed bill, with the exception of striking 
the section 101 Transmission language and replacing it with something along 
the lines of the Chairman Bliley's transmission draft sent to you last 
Friday.  As you recall, Enron opposes the H.R. 2944 Section 101 transmission 
language but supports the Bliley draft language.  Thus, this is a positive 
development.  Drafting continues with Subcommittee Chairman Barton willing to 
accept the Bliley transmission language provided he gains some flexibility in 
terms of a state grievance body and some additional means for state rate 
setting influence.  Perhaps a directed rulemaking would address his concerns. 
 We are deeply involved in the lobbying and drafting of this agreement and 
hope to have late tomorrow a copy of a Bliley/Barton letter sent to all their 
Committee members confirming the agreement to work together to pass 
legislation this year.

Please feel free to call should you need any additional information.

Attached below is the 70 pages of legislative language of the Chairman's Mark in the Senate on electricity.  Undoubtedly this will be massaged and amendments readied for the markup planned for next week.  Of course, this being the Senate, even the schedule could change.  Based on meetings and contacts thus far, staff is only starting to read the text and hear from outside folks.  Note that the document is in Word Perfect, not Microsoft word, so your computer needs the software to convert it.

    I'm attaching an electronic copy of Division B of the Chairman's Mark, which
the Committee will take up next week.
    This miracle of modern technology will, of course, make it much faster and
easier for you to draw amendments to the mark without having to retype the base
text.  We would prefer that you draft "cut-and-bite" amendments that show the
text you propose to strike and the text you propose to insert, rather than
substituting large blocks of text with no indication of the differences between
what you are proposing and the original text.  But if you do use the electronic
text to substitute large blocks of text, kindly remember that the rest of us
will still need to figure out how your amendment differs from the original text.
 It would help everyone who has to make sense of your amendment if you could
also share a "redline" version that shows the actual changes.
    It would also help if we can circulate amendments to each other as early as
possible.  Regrettably, most amendments were not circulated until very late the
day before the markup on Division E, and we would like to do better this time. 
The Committee staff stands ready to help you draft amendments and to consider
whatever you propose fairly and objectively, but that becomes infinitely harder
after normal business hours on the night before the markup.

Subject: FW: Meeting on Roundtable Policy Statement


I just received the following questions from NARUC re: the transmission
provisions.  My initial political response to the majority of the questions
(goodness knows you're not going to get a substantive response out of me --
that's other folks' job) is that these things are going to happen anyway as
a result of external factors (particularly RTO formation).  Our proposal
reflects an attempt to find a reasonable transition process to get from
point A to point B.

I don't expect to do a whole lot of the talking at this meeting, so our
legal types should be prepared to go.

Tom -

In preparation for our meeting this afternoon, I've put together the
following questions.  Look forward to seeing you at 1:30.

Here are the questions:

Questions concerning transmission jurisdiction:

1. How would FERC's jurisdiction over all transmission services
work (retail and wholesale, bundled and unbundled)?
2. Particularly, in a mechanical sense, how would FERC's authority
to regulate the transmission component of bundled retail service work?
Would FERC set a rate that would then be reflected in retail rates and
bills?
3. Would this process directly or indirectly require that retail
services be unbundled, notwithstanding State policies to the contrary?
4. Is it the case that the principles require that all transmission
uses be treated identically?  E.G, would bundled retail and unbundled
wholesale services be provided under identical rates, terms and
conditions?  Is it the stakeholders' view that these are equivalent
services?
5. Retail customers have borne the burden of financially supporting
the cost of the transmission network through so-called residual
ratemaking.  Do the stakeholders believe that these customers have any
equitable claim on the transmission system?  Should native load
customers be compensated for any loss of priority or preferential access
to transmission services?
6. Do the stakeholders support the extension of FERC's jurisdiction
to all transmission services provided by all classes of transmission
owners, e.g. munis, coops and PMAs?  More specifically, would FERC have
jurisdiction over bundled transmission service provided to customers of
munis and coops?  If so, would such services be treated identically with
wholesale services? With IOU services?
7. Must FERC have exclusive jurisdiction over all transmission uses
or is some compromise involving shared jurisdiction over retail services
possible?  E.G., right of appeal to FERC for discriminatory State
commission decision, delegation of FERC authority to regional group of
State regulators.
8. Concerning the Roundtable Policy, how does the reservation of
transmission capacity for native load work?  Does this mean that they
will have preferential rights to capacity in constrained situations?
Does it matter whether retail services are bundled or unbundled?

Linda:

Attached are some examples of ways in which open access will help increase 
supply.  It's a work in progress, but here are my initial thoughts.

Also, Jim and I spoke with Tabors and Pickle and got clarification on the 
numbers we used in making the point that supply will increase with open 
access.   They said that the 2-5 percent works in the east (AEP) but they 
would like to be more conservative in the west (1-3 percent increase in 
supply).  This still results in an increase of supply on any given day of 
1,350 - 4,050 of MW.  I made this change to the "Examples" page but we'll 
need to make a similar change to the Lay paper.

Call me this weekend if you need me (202) 466-9160.

		 Subject: BENEFITS OF OPEN ACCESS - EXPANSION OF SUPPLY

HERE ARE SOME OTHER THOUGHTS TO MAYBE WORK IN OVER THE COMING DEBATES --

There are real supply benefits from open access.  

First, reliability is increased.   Historically, utilities shared reserves 
only with adjoining systems.  Open access allows sharing of reserves, 
especially replacement reserves, over a broader market. 

Second, open access increases the productivity of the current generation 
portfolio.  Barriers to moving power to where it is needed allows less costly 
generation to sit idle.  In addition, open access reduces the generation 
capacity requirements of the overall system.  Instead of local utilities 
building for their needs, open access allows remote generation to reliably 
serve local needs.  The result is that lower capacity is required as more 
energy is served out of the same quantity of capacity, resulting in long-term 
efficiency.

Third, open access should improve the utilization of the current transmission 
network.  In the natural gas context, pipeline open access has allowed for 
transported volumes nearly quadrupling since 1985.

According to this morning's Washington Post, the Bush Administration will 
support the expected FERC action today of extending the existing California 
price mitigation regime to 10 other Western states and to all days/all hours, 
not just during California emergencies (stages 1, 2 and 3).  This action 
comes only a day before FERC and other witnesses will  testify on the 
Feinstein/Smith price cap legislation before the Senate Energy Committee, 
Gov. Davis and FERC will  testify before the Senate Governmental Affairs 
Committee on Wednesday, and the House Financial Services Committee joins the 
fray with a hearing on the California energy situation on Wednesday.  The 
latter committee will probably base its jurisdiction over some aspect of 
energy policy on a number of factors, including its jurisdiction over 
presidential economic emergency powers.  The committee staff has in the past 
expressed interest in derivatives and other financial aspects of energy 
trading and markets.  We are checking now to quietly determine whether these 
issues will be on Wednesday's agenda.

Rich, I am on a leave from LeBoeuf and working on the Transition Team as part 
of the Energy Policy Group for the next few weeks.  We request Enron's views 
on electricity issues.  I regret the short notice and tight deadline for your 
response (Monday COB), but time is short and there is a need to flesh out 
Administration positions and prepare nominees.  Please consider responding to 
the questions as an attachment to your response, which should use the 
requested template.  Until we move in the D.C. Transition office on Monday or 
so, the best way to reach me is cell phone (202-255-6803) or email.  
Regards.

Dear Steve:

I have given some thought to the ideas you and I discussed regarding a 
website to promote a light-hearted view of some of the more absurd activities 
of the anti-deregulation and monopoly forces in the electricity battle.

I think my White House Writers Group colleague Michael Long would love to 
take this on. ?He has an eclectic background: he spent considerable time as a 
stand-up comedian, then did a tour as the speechwriter for Tennessee senator 
Fred Thompson. ?He recently had a terrific piece in the Weekly Standard 
taking the air out of Herblock, the Washington Post editorial cartoonist.

(His bio is on our website: 
http://www.whwg.com/Firm/WritersBio.cfm?StaffId=19. ) ?

Mike has excellent instincts for and knowledge of free market ideas, and has 
expressed them quite effectively for a number of our clients, including 
high-profile CEOs and a couple of presidential candidates. ?I believe he 
could very quickly get up to speed on your issues and produce the kind of 
humorous stuff you have in mind. ?I would work closely with him to make sure 
we were getting the issues right.

I propose that we begin the effort by letting Michael "loose" on the 
material. ?He could get familiar with the ongoing issues in California and 
elsewhere, then come up with some preliminary material, including a few 
suggestions of how we should format it for a website

If you think he has the hang of it, we could have a longer discussion about 
how to create a permanent website and let Michael regularly write and update 
the material. ?

December is typically a slow month for us and it would be a good time to give 
this a try. ?Let me know what you think. ?I?d be happy to set up a call with 
the three of us.

I enjoyed finally meeting you face to face at Enron and hope we can continue 
to work together.

Best,

Daniel

I attended both the House and Senate energy committee hearings today.  House 
hearing was in the Barton Subcommittee (Energy & Air Quality).  Senate 
hearing was on last week's FERC order on a "soft price cap" and related 
issues.  The House witnesses were dominated by California officials: Cal 
Energy Commission, Cal Air Resources Board, Chairman of Gov Davis Generation 
Implementation Task Force.  In addition, there were witnesses from the 
Western Area Power Admin and Bonneville PA.  The Senate witnesses were the 
three FERC commissioners.

HIghlights

Chairman Barton said it is still his intention to try to mark up the Barton 
bill, H.R. 1647 next week (many on and off the Subcommittee doubt this will 
happen; we are gathering political intelligence on those prospects and will 
report back with more information and conclusions once that is done); 
Chairman Barton also said he may go to California next week.
There was considerable emphasis at both hearings about the alleged role that 
higher natural gas prices into California play in the electric power rate 
increases; several witnesses focused on difference in alleged transportation 
costs for similar differences between California and non-CA states; FERC at 
the Senate hearing said that today the commission announced a staff technical 
conference for later this month on all aspects of the natural gas market as 
it relates to California; a House member from Southern Illinois coal country 
attacked California for using only natural gas in its new power plants.
The House witnesses, primarily BPA but also the California witnesses, 
attacked the negawatt provision in sec. 102 of the Barton bill; the criticism 
was that BPA would be forced to purchase power on the open market at a high 
price since it is short, sell it to the DSIs under contract; let the DSI sell 
it at market rates and capture the difference; BPA witness said that thus 
sec. 102 would make it difficult if not impossible to implement their 
strategy to avoid as much as a 200 percent rate increase on 10/1/01; BPA 
testimony will make it tough for Members of Congress from that service region 
to support sec. 102.
Both hearings also touched on how difficult it would be to actually devise a 
price cap; at the House hearing, none of those advocating a price cap among 
the witnesses could answer excellent questions about exactly how this could 
be done; the witnesses just said "cost plus a reasonable profit" and said 
leave the details to FERC; at afternoon Senate hearing, Chairman Hebert had 
the staff bring in 15 boxes from one FP&L case to show how a price cap would 
take too long to bring any relief to California this summer; he said last 
week's soft price cap is much better.
Also on the price cap, Rep. Walden (R-OR)  got the Cal Energy Comm chair to 
admit that if the price caps had been in place earlier, California would NOT 
have taken the conservation and new generation steps that it has taken 
recently. 
The interplay among the FERC commissioners was much more contentious than it 
was a House hearing on Tuesday, although it could have been worse; when 
Senate Chairman Murkowski (R-AK) said that "help is on the way" in the form 
of the nominees for the two vacancies, Sen. Dorgan (D-ND) made a comment that 
suggested that the confirmation process will not be smooth; the same concern 
came from the interplay among the Senators, which was also somewhat 
contentious at times.

Please advise if you have any questions or would like further details.

Docket No. RM99-2-000              - 72 -         

     In March 1998, a group referring to themselves as power

     industry stakeholders 113/ filed a petition for rulemaking on

     electric power industry structure. 114/  Although we are not

     addressing here the specific relief they are requesting in that

     Petition, the Petition does contain a number of fairly specific

     allegations indicating problems in the market.  For example, the

     Petition asserts:

          Concepts such as ATC and the OASIS have become vehicles
          for obstructing and curtailing, rather than
          accommodating, transactions.  Incumbents are able to
          deny new entrants access to critical, accurate
          information across control areas.  This can take the
          form of out-of-date or incorrect postings of ATC or, in
          some instances, intentional withholding of actual ATC. 
          Regardless of the cause, more transmission capability



     111/ Open Access Same Time Information Technical Conference,
          Docket No. RM95-9-003 (July 18, 1997), transcript at 23.

     112/ Id. at 28.

     113/ The group consists of a number of power marketers and users,
          including, for example, Coalition for a Competitive Electric
          Market, ELCON, Electric Clearinghouse, Inc., and Enron Power
          Marketing, Inc.

     114/ Petition for a Rulemaking on Electric Power Industry
          Structure and Commercial Practices and Motion to Clarify or
          Reconsider Certain Open-Access Commercial Practices, Docket
          No. RM98-5-000.

          is physically available than is being released for
          sale. [115/]

     The Petition alleges the existence of "ATC exclusions,

     inaccuracies and misuses that deny new entrants the ability to

     evaluate market opportunities, and therefore, prevent reasonable

     access to the grid." 116/  The Petition cited specific instances

     of inconsistent ATC calculations for the same interconnection by

     the systems on either side; an OASIS showing ATC that was not in

     fact made available for scheduling; and an OASIS showing no ATC

     but the utility then using that path for a sale. 117/

          EPSA, the trade association representing certain power

     suppliers, filed comments in support of the Petition and echoed

     many of the same experiences:

          EPSA agrees that this discriminatory conduct persists
          principally because of the continuing incentives and
          opportunity for transmission owning public utilities
          covertly to discriminate against other transmission
          customers, by, for example, minimizing reported
          available transmission capability (ATC), delaying or
          inaccurately posting ATC on the OASIS, or otherwise
          manipulating market operations. 118/

     EPSA further stated that, "The manipulation of ATC -- whether

     with the intent to deceive or as the result of poor OASIS

     suppliers." 119/

          At our regional ISO conference in New Orleans, we were told

     by a representative from the Public Service Commission of Yazoo

     City, Mississippi, of a specific instance of what it considered

     to be discriminatory treatment:

          Yazoo City, as a participant, has experienced first
          hand an individual [transmission] owner's continued
          ability to use its ownership and control [of]
          transmission to disadvantage competitors,
          notwithstanding Order 888's mandate of
          non-discriminatory transmission access. 

     The representative then went on to describe an instance where a

     marketer could not complete a 10 MW power sale because of

     transmission restrictions, but then the transmission provider

     offered to supply the capacity itself. 120/  The representative

     concluded that Orders Nos. 888 and 889 have not fully eliminated

     undue discrimination and this will not be achieved "as long as

     transmission owners are allowed to fence in

     transmission-dependent utilities and others located on their

     transmission system to enhance the value of their generation

     assets at increased cost to competitors." 


     119/ Id. at 8.

     120/ Comments of Robert D. Priest on behalf of the Public Service
          Commission of Yazoo City, Regional ISO Conference (New
          Orleans), Transcript at 201-03.  After hearing this
          assertion, Entergy Services, Inc. filed a letter in which it
          stated that it was unable to identify any Entergy-imposed
          restrictions that would have prevented the power purchase. 
          See Letter in Docket No. PL98-5-000 (filed July 2, 1998). 


          Docket No. RM99-2-000              - 75 -         

          One specific area where there have been allegations that

     transmission owners are using ATC to favor their own merchant

     operations concerns the calculation and use of Capacity Benefit

     Margin (CBM).  Although there is no single accepted definition,

     CBM is generally used to mean an amount of transmission transfer

     capability reserved by load serving entities to ensure access to

     generation from interconnected systems to meet their generation

     reliability requirements. 121/  Some utilities subtract CBM from

     their total transmission capability to arrive at ATC.  There is

     no uniform method for calculating CBM.  The ability to withhold

     CBM to ensure reliability not only confers a reliability

     advantage for the transmission provider, but may give the

     transmission provider the opportunity to selectively withhold ATC

     over paths and interconnections useful to its generation

     competitors.  

          The use of CBM is an issue that is currently being

     considered in several cases pending before the Commission. 122/ 

     For example, with respect to the formation of the PJM ISO, the

     Commission noted that it was not demonstrated that the PJM Pool's

     historical practice of withholding firm transmission interface

     capacity as a substitute for installed generating reserves is


     121/ NERC, Available Transfer Capability Definitions and
          Determinations (June 1996), at 14.

     122/ The Commission recently noticed a technical conference, to
          be held May 20 and 21, 1999, on the issue of CBM.  See
          Capacity Benefit Margin in Computing Available Transmission
          Capacity, Notice of Technical Conference, Docket No. EL99-
          46-000.


          Docket No. RM99-2-000              - 76 -         

     consistent with our open access policies.  The Commission

     observed that the load serving entities that own generating

     capacity within the PJM control area appeared to benefit from

     this practice as suppliers in addition to benefitting as load

     serving entities. 123/  The Commission set the issue for further

     briefing and it remains pending.  In another pending proceeding

     concerning WPSC's CBM calculation, two of the parties assert that

     CBM "removes firm transmission capacity from open access

     offerings, thereby raising an unnecessary and unjustifiable

     barrier to competition," and "fosters discrimination by giving

     merchant functions gatekeeping control over CBM-related

Late this morning, the House Energy and Commerce Committee adoped the committee print, as amended, of an energy package that addresses conservation, clean coal, renewables, hydro, nuclear, and boutique fuels.  The vote was 50 to 5 to report the bill.  Other committees -- Ways and Means, Science, and Resources -- also moved their energy bills this week.  Thus, the House is on track to consider a merged package before the start of the August Recess on August 3rd.

As to electricity, during the several days of debate this week both Chairmen Tauzin and Barton reaffirmed their intention to next move to electricity issues.  Mr. Barton's staff advised me this morning that the subcommittee he chairs will hold a hearing on Friday, July 20th on all electricity issues other than transmission.  While Mr.  Barton has publicly held out hope of marking up an electricity bill this month, sources on and off the committee do not see this timetable as realistic.  On the Senate side, the majority staff is working on an electricity "white paper" that may be circulated for comment next week.

Below is a recap of action on amendments of interest to Enron:

1.	Last night, on a largely partisan vote (with Democrats Hall, Green and John voting with the Republicans) the Committee rejected an amendment by Rep. Jane Harman (D-CA) (that was to have been offered by Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-CA)) that would have retroactively amended the FERC refund date and essentially ordered refunds regardless of amounts owed to power sellers.

2.	First thing this morning the Committee, again on a largely partisan basis (with Democrats Hall, Green, John and Towns), rejected a Waxman amendment to impose cost-of-service rates on all power in the West (other than generation added after 1/1/01).  (Originally, Mr. Waxman was going to offer amendment to impose cost-of-service rates only on those who do not supply all available power during an emergency, but he ended up offering basically what he had pursued in subcommittee on the old "Californa Only" bill.)

3.	The Committee adopted an amendment by Rep. Shadegg to amend the Natural Gas Act to make it clear that a natural gas "transportation facility" shall not be added to the National Register of Historic Places until FERC has abandoned the facility.  Apparently there have been some instances of "old" pipelines being considered as "historic places" under federal law.  The House Resources Committee added a similar amendment to its package yesterday.

4.	By voice vote, the Committee rejected a Waxman Amendment to require the president to propose and implement a plan to bring U.S. greenhouse gases down to 1990 levels.  There was strong opposition voiced by many Republicans and Democrats to this amendment.

5.	By mixed vote of 24 to 29, the Committee defeated a Waxman Amendment to set cost and performance goals for renewables, including wind power, and authorize federal funds to assist with commercial project costs (up to 50 percent).

I called the Committee lawyers and Andy Black and left a voice mail 
indicating that you wanted to hear Chairman Barton's views on section 102 and 
revenue sharing.

The attached "Good" language is still being worked on, but Dan and I find it 
generally acceptable.  The subcommitte print contains the correct pagination 
for section 102.

Second Issue:  Linda and I wopuld like you to talk to Sen. Wyden about his 
tendency to attack Enron and other marketers given that we have worked with 
his office to develop transparency legislation.  I'll discuss with you once 
you catch your breath.

John -- Couple comments
Transmission (Federal and State Jurisdiction:)-- I did not fully understand "States have no jurisdiction over transmission facilities, and this provision prevents large industrial customers from tying directly into the transmission grid and avoiding state charges."  There is bypass to the interstate pipelines now.  It seems that industrials should be able to connect to the interstate grid, especially when they have onsite generation that they want to sell into the grid.

Market Power -- Market Monitoring: In the SE RTO mediation, I raised this possibility about FERC having regional offices and being the market monitor instead of establishing these elaborate MM structures.  Everyone thought that this is a Day 5 or 6 possibility and many of the munis and coops really want the elaborate structures (separate MM company, etc.), at least initially.

Electricity Supply: Interconnection Standard:  "pay direct costs"  -- direct costs should not include network upgrades that benefit other customers of the grid.  FERC recently issued an order in a Consumers case that said interconnection customers do not have to pay the network upgrades (they are rolled into rates).  This is something Enron encounters on most every interconnection we attempt -- the utilities typically put in all kinds of costs and try to direct bill us.

Federal Electric Utilies:  TVA power sales:  "Limit TVA wholesale power sales outside the region to sales of excess power..."  Under the current scheduling rules (day ahead balanced schedule requirement), TVA could have alot of latitude and discretion in what it calls "excess".  If we get the congestion management we want, this would be less of a problem.

	Regulation of TVA trans. system:  "(TVA has argued Federal law prevents..."  I thought TVA was saying it is difficult for TVA to join an RTO, not impossible under current law (they raised the letter that BPA apparently received encouraging it to join an RTO).

Real time pricing is good. 
Thanks.

As discussed for the last several days, attached is the latest version of the 
"Pat Wood transmission straw man."  It is virtually the same as what I sent 
to you earlier with the exception of some lettering changes.  Our initial 
comments are that "H" and "K" are non-starters for Enron and that "C (3)" 
must be changed to read:  "that all users of transmission facilities within 
the RTO will be under the same rates, terms and conditions of the same tariff 
to ensure non-discriminatory access to the electric transmission grid under 
non-discriminatory rates, terms and conditions;".

Please advise as soon as possible (i.e. close of business today) should there 
be additional issues raised in this context.  Many thanks.

Once again today I participated in the discussions on possible electricity legislation held in the offices of Majority Whip Tom DeLay with other interested parties including industry segments, public power and state regulators.  The other congressional participants were staff to Reps. Steve Largent and Chip Pickering.

After meeting all week (except Wednesday), the group was unable to reach an agreement or even a provisional consensus on what could be placed in an electricity title that could be added to the comprehensive energy package that the House Energy and Commerce Committee will begin to process next week.  Congressional staff will report to their bosses on the status of the discussions as of this afternoon and from there the Members will determine whether to proceed further.  There is a general perception that committee leaders will elect NOT to take up electricty legislation at this time and in the context of the broader package in the absence of broadly supported legislation.

In the end, the discussions did not bear fruit because divisions remained over the usual issues and along most of the usual fault lines.  As the drafts progressed during the week, we succeeded in deleting the original language that would have had Congress weigh into the bundled/unbundled and federa/state jurisdictional rules at the very time that likely adverse action in Congress could in turn adversely impact the Supreme Court case.

A last minute attempt was made by the congressional staff to stitch together a minimalist electricity title that would have included reliability (with the understanding that the NERC discussions could produce modifications more to our liking), PUHCA repeal, PURPA reform, interconnection language and federal siting.  However, in each instance there were one more politically relevant interest groups not willing to go along.  Cong. DeLay's staff also tried to link PUHCA repeal to those who had joined an RTO.

There was also an attempt to strip it down to reliability, interconnection and siting (eminent domain) -- but again there was either disagreement on the details or objection from those who favorite subject was left out of the minimalist package.

There was one rather interesting discussion when the public power folks floated language on market power that included a sentence that would have made the filed rate doctrine inapplicable to antitrust challenges to market rates.  Needless to say, I strongly objected as did EPSA and others.

As noted, the lack of an agreement reduces our exposure when the mark up occurs.  In the absence of an electricity title, refund, price control and other issues should not be germane to the package that the subcommittee will take up on Tuesday and the full committee next Friday.  That package will have five issues addressed: conservation, clean coal, hyrdo, nuclear and reformulated gasoline.  Details to follow once legislative language is released.

As discussed, should Congress upon its return after the Labor Day recess 
appear ready to move H.R. 4941, Congressman Wynn's stand-alone reliability 
legislation; a large group of stakeholders would sign and send the attached 
letter.  Although Enron would like the letter to be stronger, this letter 
went through many revisions to reach the consensus language necessary for a 
larger group to sign.  Thus, while not a perfect letter, it would send a 
stronger message with a multitude of signatures.

The status of the letter is that it is being "held in our back pocket" should 
it become necessary.  Pre-approval has been given and it stands in an 
"almost" final form.  Should you have any grave problems with the letter, let 
me know, and I will see what's possible given the constraints posed by the 
group.  

On a separate but related note, we are working with Joe and Dan to prepare a 
short white paper to detail the "technical problems" still remaining with the 
Wynn legislative language and will communicate these problems, Enron's 
opposition and lack of bill "consensus" to the Hill shortly (as soon as this 
paper is ready.)  I believe ELCON, EPSA and CMA will continue to share our 
opposition although confusion remains on the Hill as to the exact reasons for 
our opposition given the numerous versions of the legislation circulating.  
thanks.

Earlier today, the Senate Energy Committee held the first of two days of hearings on Chairman Bingaman's "white paper" on electricity and the electricity provisions of other pending bills.  The hearings will continue tomorrow with all of the five FERC commissioners as witnesses plus private sector witnesses.

Today's hearing went well from our perpective, with support for Super RTOs and general support for expanding the grid both physically and from an access view point voiced by Senators and witnesses.  Sen. Craig Thomas even said four RTOs were too many -- there should be one national RTO to run a national grid.  Today's witnesses represented the Dept. of Energy, EPSA, EEI, NRECA, APPA, IBEW union, Alliance to Save Energy, ELCON, NERC, NARUC, NASUCA and the State of New Mexico.  We will provide a more detailed analysis after completing a review of the lengthy written testimony, but a summary of the DOE testimony and the first panel of private sector witnesses follows.

1.	DOE said they are working on electricity legislative language.  Should be done soon.  Chairman Bingaman said they needed to get it done in time for the Committee to consider it when the Committee takes up electricity as early as the second week in September.  Deputy Sec. Blake implied that their proposal was or would soon be shared with other Administration agencies for review.

2.	In response to questions, Blake said that legislative action on jurisdiction questions (fed v. state) would be "useful" but he stressed that they view any new legislation as clarifying that FERC has authority they feel already exists.  He said that while states have an important role to play, Congress must recongize the interstate character of the market and the need for open access to the interstate grid.  (In response to a question, Blake later said that FERC had largely addressed the access issue or would do so.)

3.	On reliability, he was given a chance to say that DOE supports th NERC "consensus" language, but instead repeated that the Administration favors "enforceable reliability standards" but wants to work with the Committee on the exact language.  I took this as confirmation of what we have heard informally from DOE in terms of key players there not being enamored of the NERC "consensus" approach, at least as it exists in its old, long form.

4.	Sens. Craig and Cantwell pushed Blake on why the Administration has not fully supported BPA's request for a debt limit increase to finance expansion of the BPA grid.  Blake said they support the BPA expansion projects, but that OMB feels BPA has enough borrowing authority through 2003.  This did not sit well with Craig and Cantwell.  I spoke with Sen. Craig in the hall, following up on a conversation I had with him the other evening about BPA, and he stressed that he is committed to getting BPA the debt limit it needs.  As you know, commercial has asked us to help BPA given matters pending between Enron and BPA.

5.	On the first private sector panel, even John Rowe, the Co-CEO of Exelon and past EEI chairman (testifying for his company and EEI), said several times that there should be strong RTOs that each cover a wide idea.  He said his board voted yesterday to sell its transmission assets IF a strong, independent operator could be found.  Rowe also said that RTOs should be "encouraged" (implying not mandatory?).  The APPA witness was strong on RTOs, saying that all entities will be part of RTOs even without legislation.  NRECA said that co-ops would oppose federal jurisdiction over them and that they favor voluntary RTOs.  EPSA made the usual case for competition, open access, RTOs, etc.

Steve:  We need you to have a word with Senator Wyden about the transparency 
legislation that I worked on with his office.  The bill is designed to 
require transmission companies and generators to release operating data on a 
real time basis.  Unfortunately, comments by Senator Wyden made at the FERC 
nominee hearing left the impression that he is gunning for evil marketers, 
including Enron.  Most importantly, that impression was left with McLane 
Layton of Sen Nickles office who has been asked to support the bill.  Wyden 
claims he was "misquoted". 

 Nonetheless, impress upon him that Enron is sticking its neck out on the 
bill because other marketers and generators do not necessarily agree that 
more information should be disclosed and that we are not eagre to lend our 
support if this is going to be turned against us.

I have attached the bill language (it has not been introduced).

Subject: Status of Discussions on Electricity Legislation -- No Agreement
 Reached

Once again today I participated in the discussions on possible electricity 
legislation held in the offices of Majority Whip Tom DeLay with other 
interested parties including industry segments, public power and state 
regulators.  The other congressional participants were staff to Reps. Steve 
Largent and Chip Pickering.

After meeting all week (except Wednesday), the group was unable to reach an 
agreement or even a provisional consensus on what could be placed in an 
electricity title that could be added to the comprehensive energy package 
that the House Energy and Commerce Committee will begin to process next 
week.  Congressional staff will report to their bosses on the status of the 
discussions as of this afternoon and from there the Members will determine 
whether to proceed further.  There is a general perception that committee 
leaders will elect NOT to take up electricty legislation at this time and in 
the context of the broader package in the absence of broadly supported 
legislation.

In the end, the discussions did not bear fruit because divisions remained 
over the usual issues and along most of the usual fault lines.  As the drafts 
progressed during the week, we succeeded in deleting the original language 
that would have had Congress weigh into the bundled/unbundled and 
federa/state jurisdictional rules at the very time that likely adverse action 
in Congress could in turn adversely impact the Supreme Court case.

A last minute attempt was made by the congressional staff to stitch together 
a minimalist electricity title that would have included reliability (with the 
understanding that the NERC discussions could produce modifications more to 
our liking), PUHCA repeal, PURPA reform, interconnection language and federal 
siting.  However, in each instance there were one more politically relevant 
interest groups not willing to go along.  Cong. DeLay's staff also tried to 
link PUHCA repeal to those who had joined an RTO.

There was also an attempt to strip it down to reliability, interconnection 
and siting (eminent domain) -- but again there was either disagreement on the 
details or objection from those who favorite subject was left out of the 
minimalist package.

There was one rather interesting discussion when the public power folks 
floated language on market power that included a sentence that would have 
made the filed rate doctrine inapplicable to antitrust challenges to market 
rates.  Needless to say, I strongly objected as did EPSA and others.

As noted, the lack of an agreement reduces our exposure when the mark up 
occurs.  In the absence of an electricity title, refund, price control and 
other issues should not be germane to the package that the subcommittee will 
take up on Tuesday and the full committee next Friday.  That package will 
have five issues addressed: conservation, clean coal, hyrdo, nuclear and 
reformulated gasoline.  Details to follow once legislative language is 
released.

Attached is NARUC's letter opposing the MidAmerican transmission compromise.  
In addition, by mail, I have forwarded to you Southern Company's lobbying 
piece to also oppose the MidAmerican transmission compromise.  Chairman 
Murkowski told Ken Lay he would only support the compromise language if NARUC 
supported the language.  Well, we now have the answer.  We are lining up 
sponsors for our amendment package with Senators Bingaman and Fitzgerald 
agreeing to be lead sponsors plus others willing to cosponsor including 
Gorton and Nickles.  Staff confusion and locking down the exact amendment 
language are our immediate challenges now.  We do not expect the mark-up to 
conclude in the Senate Energy Committee tomorrow, thus, giving us time to 
pass our amendment package upon Congress' return from the Memorial Day break.

Attached herewith please find Chairman Bliley's letter to his House Commerce 
Committee members outlining the process and content for full committee 
mark-up upon Congress' return from the July 4th break; the section-by-section 
on transmission plus the actual transmission legislative language are also 
attached.  H.R. 2944 is the underlying bill to which these changes are made.

We have made substantial progress just this week.  We will need to be 
diligent to determine which amendments will be offered in July and to guard 
against those we oppose.  Commerce Committee members are continuing their 
meetings this evening to further plan the upcoming mark-up.

The Senate Reliability bill will likely not be considered until Congress 
reconvenes in July.  Several Democrat Senators have now placed holds.  Under 
the Senate Rules, just one Member can block bill consideration under the hold 
process.  At this point, the hold is process vs. substance.

July will be the most critical month in order for us to realize bill 
enactment this Congress.

This is an update of the Email below.  With respect to DOE efforts to draft 
electricity legislation, a list of potential items for the bill are being 
discussed this afternoon with Secretary Abraham.  DOE hopes to have a draft 
bill submitted to the White House by Friday, June 15, for consideration by 
the VP Task Force.   Similar to efforts other private sector parties are 
undoubtedly taking, I would like to submit to DOE our suggestions for the 
legislation.  As mentioned below, this bill will not include open access, but 
there are issues related to access which we may want to submit to DOE such as 
how to deal with non-jurisdictional entities.  Other topics on which we may 
want to submit legislative language are PUHCA (the reporting requirements), 
interconnection, reliability, negawatts, RTO ownership issues, and eminent 
domain.  DOE seem very willing to deal with the non-jurisdictional entities, 
either in the rulemaking context or by legislation.  Tom Briggs will be 
following up with appropriate folks on this project.   If you have any other 
ideas for this effort, please let us know ASAP.

		 Subject: Administration Energy Plan:  Next Steps


	


(Please do not circulate or discuss the information on this Email outside the 
parties listed here.)

Debate within the Administration on implementation of its energy plan appears 
to be settled.  This debate was prolonged because of change in control of the 
Senate.  The Administration has decided to transmit to Congress by mid-June a 
comprehensive letter containing an inventory of energy plan recommendations 
requiring legislative action.  I understand that legislative language will 
not be transmitted in connection with this letter.  Soon after receipt of the 
letter, the President will host a meeting at the White House of bipartisan 
congressional leaders and some key committee chairs and ranking Members.  The 
purpose of the meeting will be to convey to Congress the imperative of acting 
quickly on the President's plan and it will serve as an official launch of 
the legislative effort and the Administration's efforts to work with Congress 
on the plan.

In the meantime, the Departments and Agencies are already drafting parts of 
the energy plan.  For example, we have been told by DOE that they are 
presently drafting an electric restructuring bill.   I have calls into DOE to 
find out more about their efforts and the specific provisions to be included 
in such legislation.  We have learned that "open access" will not be in this 
legislation, as the President's report instructs FERC to undertake the 
project.  Thus, the Administration continues to believe that legislation is 
not needed for the core open access provisions and that this is a matter they 
understand will be at the top of Pat Wood's agenda.  Among other items, one 
question we will probe with DOE is whether the electricity legislation will 
contain access provisions pertaining to entities presently outside FERC's 
jurisdiction.  

At present, it does not appear that the various provisions being drafted by 
the agencies will be bundled into single transmission from the Administration 
to the Hill.  Instead, the VP's task force intends to have these legislative 
drafts ready to provide relevant committees at the appropriate time.  This 
part of the implementation plan, of course, could change.

As for Pat Wood, we continue to receive confirmation from Hill and Executive 
Branch sources that the White House intends to designate Mr. Wood as FERC 
Chair.   Timing of the switch remains unclear.  Our latest information 
suggests it could be September 1.  Many parties are suggesting to the White 
House that the change should take place earlier than that date.  

We have efforts underway to structure our position on a possible open access 
rulemaking.  A few folks on this email will be talking with Dan Watkiss today 
about such a proposal.

I have a few thoughts that I think are important:

At the opening of the second paragraph, I would laud him for mandating RTOs for all generators.  That's not insignificant and I think its important to offer some praise with our very valid criticism.

I think we need to take the opportunity to point out that the "right" number of RTOs isn't simply an arbitrary number picked from a hat.  Right now, it seems to be, especially with Pat Wood suggesting last week that CA might not need to be in a west-wide RTO.  Now we're at 6 RTOs.  Do I hear 7?

Lastly, I believe the final paragraph is fraught will peril.  I feel strongly that telling a chairman, or any member of Congress, "this issue is too big and complicated and politicians will get it wrong" is a big mistake, though it's regrettably true in most cases, Dick Armey excepted.  In their view, and probably in the view of most Americans, they get paid to deal with big and complicated issues.  

I believe we also set a dangerous precedent in saying "trust the regulators."  As you note, we're lucky that this FERC mostly gets it.  But the next FERC might not get it.  Nobody knows.  

Our point, that Congress doesn't need to act, has to be made in a more ambiguous way.


The real answer: Don't trust politicians, or regulators.  Trust markets.  Repeal the Federal Power Act.

I have placed a call to Barton.  In case I don't reach him, I put the attached letter together.  What do you think?

While we're encouraged that Cong. Barton has mandated RTO participation for all transmitting utilities, we have serious concerns that the legislation will unduly delay the development of the competitive wholesale power markets that provide consumer savings and reliable power supplies.  The process underway at FERC is on track to produce substantial benefits, and should be allowed to continue unhindered, not fall victim to electricity gerrymandering.

We look forward to working with Congressman Barton and the committee as this process moves ahead.

We should get the focus off of "micromanaging FERC".  This isn't about a federal agency; this is about which approach will produce the best outcome for consumers and our message needs to be couched in those terms.  Obviously, our view is that FERC's approach, at least so far, appears most likely to produce the kind of market which will ensure reliable, secure and affordable power. 

 I like the "gerrymandering" message.  A process dependent on compromise (eg a legislative body like congress) is going to produce a "camel" and that won't work for customers.  Truth be told it was this same kind of compromised, political, consensus-building exercise which produced AB 1890 and the resulting debacle in California's energy market.

Key question: is the "electricity gerrymandering" too tough?

While we're encouraged that Cong. Barton has mandated RTO participation for all transmitting utilities, we have serious concerns with the micromanagement of the FERC.  The process underway at FERC is working well, and should be allowed to continue unhindered.  Properly configured RTOs are essential to competitive wholesale power markets and the corresponding consumer benefits, and must not fall victim to electricity gerrymandering.

We look forward to working with Congressman Barton and the committee as this process moves ahead.

Steve,

Here is a summary and copy of the Congressman Barton's Electricity Emergency 
Relief bill per your request.


The Republicans on the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee, led by 
Congressman Barton, have drafted legislation containing short term, emergency 
measures to alleviate the crises in the Western States comprising the Western 
Systems Coordinating Council.  Such measures include a mandatory connection 
policy for distributed generation, mobilizing the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency (FEMA) and compelling the formation of a Western region 
RTO. 
 
Barton plans introduce the bill at the end of April.  The bill is intended as 
a political response to Democrats and the State of California.  Little in the 
bill could be implemented by this summer and few of the provisions would have 
any beneficial impact on supply or demand.  Thus, there is an open question 
within the White House whether pursuit of the Barton bill is the correct 
political tactic.  The belief among the industry is that it is going nowhere 
and it has already served its limited purpose of responding to Democratic 
demands for action.  Although a final decision on its inclusion has not been 
made, Enron has been initially successful in including its demand buy down 
proposal in the Barton bill.

Andy -

Thanks again for allowing me to participate in this afternoon's discussion.
As I mentioned, I believe discussions of transmission issues must include
both jurisdictional and RTO.  I understand that the RTO discussion is more
difficult in the absence of paper.  For that reason, I have taken the
liberty of drafting language that I believe mirrors (at least my view) of
one possible construct of RTO Proposal I.

I hope you find this helpful.  I will bring copies to our meeting tomorrow.

As folks know, I am sending our suggested legislative language to DOE this 
afternoon,  The package you were asked to review contained legislative 
language making RTO participation mandatory.  After further discussions with 
Tom Briggs, I am not sending the mandatory RTO language as a part of our 
package.  My concern with sending it as legislative language is that this 
would muddy the waters on our open access rulemaking (a draft of which we are 
getting this Friday from Watkiss and which we plan to transmit to DOE next 
week).  FERC has existing authority to make RTO participation mandatory.  
Thus, instead of fighting out the issue in the legislative sphere, we should 
reserve it for a possible rulemaking in open access.  We decided not to two 
track open access, so I don't think we want to two track mandatory RTOs.  If 
anyone disagrees with this strategy, we can send it first thing Thursday in 
legislative form to DOE.

Today, the House Ways and Means passed it version of the economic package.  The package included a repeal of the corporate AMT retroactive until 2000 and refundable AMT credits.  The stimulus package is expected to be on the House floor later next week.  This is a positive development because it puts us in the very best negotiating position as the focus moves to the Senate where there is less unanimity on repealing the corporate AMT.  Please see the memo below for more info.  
 
Also, the House Ways and Means Committee passed a 2-year extension of the Wind Production Tax Credit.
 
Have a nice weekend.

This is the amendment offered per the House Commerce Committee's request in 
order to allow  "a more sufficient state role."  This was drafted per 
sign-off from our conference call with Steve Kean, Joe Hartsoe and Dan 
Watkiss yesterday plus drafted with the buy-in from numerous attorneys 
representing various stakeholders with NARUC being the essential 
participant.  The staff and stakeholders meet again early Monday morning to 
determine if this agreement is sufficient to meet the needs of Congressman 
Barton so we can proceed to mark-up.  If this proves the case, we will need 
to immediately also lobby the other provisions which need amendment, but have 
been held at bay until the transmission language loggerhead we created is 
removed.  The plan would be to determine on Monday the "go" vs. "no go" to 
full Commerce Committee mark-up.  With an affirmative decision, the mark-up 
would proceed at round-the-clock, record pace with conclusion completed by 
Thursday, July 27th.  We will continue to advise you of the status.

As an aside, with Congressman Largent comparing this effort to a "Hail Mary" 
pass; he said this with optimism.  And for you football fans, with the 
Congressman having been one of the best receivers in the country; our odds 
are better than they would have been otherwise.  Perhaps this is like 
numerous state efforts before which were pronounced "dead" but resurrected 
for enactment at the final hour.

With the comprehensive bill activity, the stand-alone reliability bill 
viability will not be considered until September, if at all.  This bill's 
Savings Clause "new" agreement failure also makes bill movement problematic 
as does the agreement we achieved from all the Stakeholders to share our 
position to block its movement.  We have drafted a letter to the Speaker 
which is waiting in the wings (to be singed by numerous groups) should it 
become necessary.

The Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee meet for almost six hours today and 
approved an amended version of H.R. 1647, Chairman Barton's emergency 
legislation to aid California, by a 17-13 party line vote.  The full Energy 
and Commerce Committee may take it up as early as next week (probably 
Thursday, May 17th).

The Subcommittee DEFEATED an amendment by Rep. Waxman (D-CA) to impose 
wholesale price caps for 18 months.  The amendment was defeated 12-20 with 
all Republicans voting against, including the three from California and Rep. 
Greg Walden (R-OR), who while seen as the last to decide to oppose the price 
cap amendment, was the most forceful and articulate in opposition to the 
amendment.  Also voting "NO" were Democratic Reps. Ralph Hall (D-TX) and 
Chris John (D-TX), with which we had met in recent days.  The final vote 
tracked our whip count going into the meeting.

Rep. Albert Wynn (D-MD) offered and withdrew an amendment to delete the 
"negawatts" provision.  There was bipartisan criticism that while the concept 
made sense, there were potential problems in terms of possible games playing, 
including end users being able to sell power while not actualy reducing their 
normal power levels.  Another member said that electric coops that are 
required to sell at cost could have customers then go out and resell that 
power and make a lot of money.  Several Members said businesses could shut 
down, put workers out of work and become energy marketers and make more 
money.  Chairman Barton made a forceful defense of negawatts.  While the 
amendment to strike was deleted, we will need to respond to these criticisms 
and shore this up before full committee next week.  There will be another 
attempt to delete at full committee unless these concerns are addressed in an 
amended version.

Ranking Democrat Rick Boucher (D-VA) offered and withdrew an amendment to 
reinstate FERC maximum prices for the secondary transmission market, thus 
reversing the Feb. 2000 FERC order.  This woudl last for 18 months.  
Chairman  Barton said he agreed with Boucher that there is a problem with 
what appear to be high gas transmission rates to California, but he disagrees 
with the proposed remedy.  He pledged to work with Boucher before Full 
Committee mark-up. We are obtaining a copy of this amendment and should 
analyze it ASAP for its potential impact on Enron operations.

Rep. Ed Markey (D-MA) offered and withdrew an amendment to impose a series of 
new tests to be administered by FERC all with the goal of discouraging spot 
market transactions, or at least what he would define as excessive use of the 
spot market, and at the same time encourage "deep bilateral mechanisms."  The 
mechanisms included a "market balance test" that would say only sellers with 
a commitment to the long term market could sell in the spot market at 
unregulated rates and "spot market circuit breakers" that would be triggered 
when reserves are low in a given market.  Chairman Barton said he likes the 
concept of a spot market circuit breaker, but felt that the amendment was too 
complicated to be evaluated today.  We will also pursue an analysis of this 
amendment since it will likely be offered again in some form.

Mr. Markey also offered and withdrew a "net metering" proposal that would 
establish federal interconnection standards for individual consumers who 
would want to use fuel cells and other renewable technology to put power onto 
the system.  It was interesting that those who opposed negawatts spoke 
favorably of net metering even though they are complementary.

The subcommittee by voice vote adopted a Walden Amendment to strike the 
section of the bill that would have required an RTO if 10 of the western 
governors approved it.  The debate was pro-RTO but the rationale for deleting 
the provision is that one is already being formed and Members from those 
states did not want to upset the work already under way.

A series of other amendments on other matters were offered and withdrawn, 
none of which relate to our activities.

Subject: Bliley transmission language



This is Chairman Bliley's "discussion draft," which he just released to the
Republican members.  Evidently, this is what he views as the essential
component of a bill, and he's invited members to build on this.  This
section contains transmission language, which clarifies that FERC has
jurisdiction over both bundled and unbundled transmission.  Bliley believes
that this language is "the start, understanding it and building on it, is
the next step."

Andy -

Thanks again for allowing me to participate in this afternoon's discussion.
As I mentioned, I believe discussions of transmission issues must include
both jurisdictional and RTO.  I understand that the RTO discussion is more
difficult in the absence of paper.  For that reason, I have taken the
liberty of drafting language that I believe mirrors (at least my view) of
one possible construct of RTO Proposal I.

I hope you find this helpful.  I will bring copies to our meeting tomorrow.

Could tank the whole US economy!

DJ Greenspan Cites Concern About Electric Sector Investment
Dow Jones International News Service -- July 20, 2000  [Return to Headlines]


WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan told
Congress Thursday he is concerned that disincentives for investment in the
electricity sector will destabilize the overall U.S. economy.

"The propensity to build new electric power facilities is being
disincentivized," Greenspan said.

"I'm worried about the instability that that creates within the economy and
the difficulties that might emerge as a consequence of that," the Fed
chairman said in response to a query by Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.

"It is an issue we need to address," Greenspan said.

U.S. utilities have failed to make needed investments in generation plants
and transmission lines over the last decade in the face of regulatory
uncertainty posed by state and federal deregulation efforts.

Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has been touring the country in recent
months, warning that the problem is contributing to power supply shortages
in summer months, when hot weather sends electricity demand - and prices -
soaring.

Richardson says Congress needs to enact a comprehensive bill restructuring
the $215 billion electric industry to end the uncertainty and give the
sector renewed incentive to make needed investments. By Bryan Lee;Dow Jones

Tom --

My comments on the legislation called the "Electric Energy Regulatory 
Coordination and Reliability Act" -

1. Why did we exclude the Federal power marketing administrations, TVA, 
etc.?  Are those facilities regulated in a different section?

2. Why do we limit the FERC's authority (on pg 8) from regulating 
"transmission in intrastate commerce"?  This is a loophole that could be 
abused by many parties.

3. I am very concerned about the "independence" language (pg 10).  Today NERC 
has an "independent" Board of Trustees that is elected by the Stakeholders.  
Would NERC meet this criteria?  If it would, then the lanaguage needs to be 
strenghthened.  

4. We should add something that authorizes the FERC to implement a 
"Reliability Standards Fee" onto each Transmission Provider.  One of the key 
problems with NERC today is that the funding vehicle still resides with the 
Regional Councils and therefore with the IOUs.  The NERC Board of Trustees 
has no method to raise funds except to get approval of the Stakeholders.  
This will become the key problem very soon.  The total NERC budget is $12 MM 
/ year.  This is nothing if allowed into rates.

Thanks,

Jim
