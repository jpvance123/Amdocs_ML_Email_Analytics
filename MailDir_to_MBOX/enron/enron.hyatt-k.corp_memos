NGI's Daily Gas Price Index

Watson: Enron Upside 'Clearly Worth Doing the Deal' 
Dynegy CEO Chuck Watson told the investment community Monday that he was "90% sure" that the risk/reward ratio in the planned merger with Enron Corp. made it "clearly worth doing the deal," because the issues that decimated the former market leader were with its non-core businesses. Explaining that his team had "adequately bracketed the downside," as the deal fell together over the past few weeks, Watson said he could not be "99% positive," but noted that the upside was "substantial," and said he had a "good deal of confidence...that we'll be absolutely fine here." 
Dynegy, which announced a $22 billion cash, stock and debt deal with its downtown Houston rival on Friday night, joined with Enron executives including Chairman Kenneth Lay on Monday to answer as many questions as they could in about 90 minutes. If all goes to plan, the two companies would become Dynegy Inc. by the third quarter of 2002, the clear leader in natural gas and power marketing. 
In the second quarter 2001, Enron and Dynegy combined sold a total of 36.2 Bcf/d of gas, which represented 21% of the volumes sold by the top 20 gas marketers in North America (168.9 Bcf/d), according to a ranking by NGI. Enron was the top gas marketer with 25.3 Bcf/d and Dynegy was No. 6 with 10.9 Bcf/d. Statistics provided by Maryland-based Energy Performance Review (EPR) show that Enron and Dynegy combined sold 143,824 million kWh of power in the second quarter. That total represented 14% of the power sold by the top 20 largest power marketers (1,000,961 million kWh), according to EPR. Enron was in fifth place among power marketers with 73,724 million kWh sold, while Dynegy was in sixth place with 70,100 million kWh. 
The blending of the two will not come without challenges, but Watson stressed he expects to see more opportunities than problems. The opportunity appears to have come none too soon for Enron. Greg Whalley, Enron's president and a future member of Dynegy's executive team, confirmed that without some kind of equity investment in the company, the once market leader probably could not have sustained its liquidity through the rest of this year. 
"We definitely needed to raise some type of equity capital," said Whalley. "Under normal market conditions, we would have had adequate liquidity. This was not normal for Enron. We would not have had liquidity to the end of the year." 
Asked about asset sales in anticipation of meeting federal requirements to merge, executives acknowledged there would be some, but did not elaborate. Whalley said that from an "Enron perspective, we have not spent a lot of time with Dynegy people to agree on a plan. Chuck (Watson) has to clear what is core to Dynegy. There are several (assets for consideration to sell) on the list." 
Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay, who will not be part of the management team, but may hold a place on the Dynegy board of directors, added that Enron already has $4 billion in sales under contract, all expected to close by the end of 2002. "We also have three other significant international assets under contract," said Lay, referring to the among other things, the Dabhol power plant in India. 
Once the merger of Dynegy with Enron is successfully completed, the new Dynegy will become the "primary market player in all markets," but there will be a significant difference in how the company moves forward, noted Dynegy CFO Rob Doty. Enron's financial-backed trading strategy will merge with the "strong asset base" of Dynegy's. 
Dynegy has protected itself on the downside, however. The deal includes an out for Dynegy if Enron's legal liabilities exceed $3.5 billion. 
Asked about the possibility that some of Enron's marketing and trading team may desert the company for another company, Watson, stressing that teamwork will be the guiding force going forward, said, "if I were in this industry, this is the combination I'd work for. This is an exciting day here. It's been an exciting couple of weeks" creating a "platform for something really special in the future." 
Enron's Whalley said that he believes the company will keep most of its team intact. "They're accustomed to being part of a winning deal," he said, and "going forward, they will be very pleased with the additional infusion of equity and the stability in the marketplace." As of Monday morning, Whalley said that "activity looks pretty good," and said there had been a positive reception to the merger. "Right now, people are pleased with the introduction of new liquidity, and really want to go about establishing or re-establishing the energy franchise." 
Dynegy President Steve Bergstrom agreed. "Most traders want to be part of a winning team. This is a combination that will be a winning team. We have similar issues there as well. The 'A' players will stay around to be part of the winning team." Bergstrom explained that when the merger is complete, the new Dynegy will become the "primary player in all markets." He said Dynegy has a "more asset-backed strategy," adding that he has said before that "you can only have one market maker and Enron clearly was it." By combining the two companies, there will be a blend of Dynegy's asset strategy with Enron's "financial skill set," giving the new entity "more liquidity market-making than Dynegy itself has historically done." 
Added Watson, "both companies had a successful ratio and nothing is going to change there...I'm a strong believer in teams and the team concept. I don't want to see individuals do well if the company doesn't do well. It (will be) imbedded in the whole company." 
Ben Schlesinger, whose company Schlesinger & Associates analyzes the energy industry, said Monday that the big problem in the merger is "whether these two companies are able to pull together...to harness what's there." He said the "two parties are clearly leaders," but theoretically, they will have to streamline their operations. "Both books are fairly strong," he said, and once their efficiencies are put together, the new company will offer "stable returns." In the "very short term," however, Schlesinger said there will be moves to other traders. 
Other analysts also seemed to be throwing support behind the merger. UBS Warburg reiterated its "strong buy" rating on Dynegy, noting that "if successfully executed, this transaction would yield the most widely recognized, respected and downright credible wholesale/retail energy merchant in the world." However, UBS warned that Dynegy still faces a "daunting" task in merging the operations and employees. "We are not naive in underestimating the enormous challenge at hand. In the near-term, Enron must remain highly liquid, investment grade and its employees must remain focused on keeping its core wholesale/retail franchises up and running." 
Merrill Lynch's Donato Eassey reiterated the "buy" on Dynegy and "moving to no opinion" on Enron. He said, "Dynegy has all the necessary skill sets and as importantly, the financial stability, resources and investor confidence and experience to get the job done...Enron's unparalleled online trading business should translate to significant prospects for the new Dynegy." 
Curt Launer, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston, added that despite the size of the new company, "we do not expect major divestitures or closing issues because of the lack of asset concentration and the inherent competitiveness of the natural gas and power marketing business." He noted too that with the combination, "we have modeled a merchant unit that does 25% less business," because of "cross trading between them and some expectation of a loss of market share." Still, Launer said Dynegy would become a "formidable competitor" benefiting from a market share in excess of 20% of U.S. natural gas and power trading markets." 
As expected with most major merger announcements, Moody's Investors Service placed the ratings of Dynegy and its subsidiaries under review for possible downgrade, noting that "notwithstanding the franchise benefits of the proposed merger, the financial and business risks associated with the transaction could negatively impact Dynegy's credit fundamentals." The review affects about $4 billion of Dynegy securities, including its subsidiaries Illinova Corp. and Illinois Power Co. 
In its rating review, Moody's said it will "assess Dynegy's plans to meet the liquidity needs of the combined entity and to deal with the uncertainty surrounding Enron's off-balance sheet transactions and contingent risks...and examine the ultimate structure of the transaction, and its impact on Dynegy's financial leverage and on management's targeted debt levels." The ratings service also plans to "consider the governance framework within which the combined trading activities will operate." 
Ratings under review are: Dynegy's Prime-3 rating for commercial paper; Dynegy Holdings' Baa2 senior unsecured debt rating and its Prime-2 rating for commercial paper; Illinova Corp.'s Baa3 senior unsecured debt rating; and Illinois Power Co.'s Baa1 senior secured and Baa2 senior unsecured debt ratings, and its Prime-2 rating for commercial paper. 
Fitch revised its rating watch on Enron's outstanding securities to "evolving" from "negative," where they were placed in late October. The rating watch evolving means the ratings may be raised, lowered or maintained. Fitch also placed a rating watch negative on Dynegy and Dynegy Holding's long-term credit ratings, which also means they could be lowered or affirmed. The outstanding "F2" rated commercial paper programs for Dynegy and Dynegy Holdings were not affected.

Energy Insight News for Tuesday, November 13, 2001
Dynegy-Enron deal potential 'staggering'
If the deal between Enron and Dynegy is successfully executed, it "should
yield the most widely recognized, respected and downright credible
wholesale/retail energy merchant in the world," said James Yannello and
Ronald Barone, analysts with UBS Warburg, in a research note Monday.

Troubled energy giant Enron Corp. agreed late Friday to be taken over by
smaller rival Dynegy Inc. in a $7.8 billion stock swap, with assumption of
at least $12 billion of Enron debt. The deal includes an immediate infusion
of $1.5 billion from Dynegy's 26.6% owner ChevronTexaco to shore up Enron's
cash-strained trading operations, with another $1 billion of new equity from
ChevronTexaco when the merger closes.

"We view both the near and long-term upside potential of this deal as
staggering," said the UBS Warburg analysts, citing the combination of
"Enron's unsurpassed global wholesale network franchise with that of
Dynegy's; fully leveraging the two's online capabilities; continuing the
aggressive growth of what will likely become Dynegy Energy Services;
disposing of all non-core assets; and managing this global powerhouse with
Dynegy's above-board culture based on teamwork, strict values and honesty." 

Even though it remains positive about this merger, UBS Warburg hasn't
underestimated the "enormous challenge at hand. In the near-term, Enron must
remain highly liquid, investment grade and its employees must remain focused
on keeping its core wholesale/retail franchises up and running. ... Also,
early indications are that the ratings agencies have blessed the plan." 

Dynegy will offer 0.2685 of its shares for each Enron share, giving Dynegy
holders 64% of the combined company. At Dynegy's closing price Friday of
$38.76/share, that equates to $10.41/share for Enron, which has seen its
stock plummet from more than $89 a year ago to a recent low of $7 before
rebounding on Dynegy bailout rumors. Enron closed at $8.63/share Nov. 9.

FERC's Brownell says Enron's failure is 'tragic'
U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Member Nora Brownell Monday
described Enron's financial woes as "tragic," but said Dynegy's acquisition
of the company shouldn't harm wholesale energy markets. Brownell, who said
FERC will need to approve the deal, said "the reality is that we need strong
companies and that's what I'll look at. I'm always sad to see companies
[fall], but it happens. This shouldn't distort people's view of the market.
What it should do is put it into context. This happens on Wall Street all
the time. Companies come, companies go and that doesn't change the outcome
of the equation. I don't want people to say the world is coming to an end,
but it is tragic." She made her comments to a reporter at a meeting of state
regulators in Philadelphia.


CMS Energy selling Indian assets
CMS Energy Corp. is planning to sell all its energy assets in India as part
of its strategy announced last month to sell overseas assets and focus on
its home markets. No timeframe has yet been decided upon for CMS to exit
from two operating joint venture power utilities and a third project being
built in India. CMS has invested $49 million in a 49% stake in the 200-MW
Basin Bridge plant in the southern Indian city of Madras, which it owns
along with Australia's Energy Equity Corp. and India's GMR Vasavi. It has
also invested $28 million in a 23% stake in India's first independent power
project, the 235-MW plant promoted by India's local GVK Industries at
Jegurupadu in southern Andhra Pradesh state. The Dearborn, Mich.-based CMS
had also committed $49 million for 50% of the 250-MW ST-CMS facility it is
building at Neyveli, south of Madras.

Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.

For your information... another Transwestern story just appearing on the wire.

Transwestern Denies Withheld Capacity to Boost Negotiated Deals 
A Transwestern Pipeline executive last week dismissed allegations that the pipeline withheld firm transportation capacity for service to California from recourse-rate shippers last winter by arranging substantially more lucrative negotiated-rate deals prior to posting available capacity to its web site. 
Mary Kay Miller, vice president of rates and certificates, acknowledged Transwestern may have had discussions and exchanged faxes last January (prior to posting its available capacity) with two shippers -- Sempra Energy and Richardson Products II Ltd. -- that subsequently entered into negotiated-rate transactions for February and March on the pipeline. But she stressed that any requests for capacity by Sempra Energy and Richardson were considered "moot" by the pipeline until after the available operational capacity was posted. 
"Even if they would have sent...a fax the day before" the capacity became available, "it would have been irrelevant because there was no capacity posted" at that time, said Miller. Capacity requests that came in prior to Jan. 31, the day that available capacity was posted for February contracts on Transwestern, were "null and void." The only "relevant" ones were those that Transwestern received on or after Jan. 31, she noted. 
Miller spent much of last Wednesday on the stand being quizzed by lawyers for FERC and producers about Transwestern's methods for notifying customers about available capacity, the manner in which it chooses winning bids and about its pre-posting contacts with Sempra Energy and Richardson. 
It was the first day of the FERC hearing exploring charges that Transwestern exercised market power in awarding negotiated-rate contracts that led to shippers being charged as much as $27/MMBtu last February, far in excess of the pipeline's maximum allowed rate of 38 cents/MMBtu for firm transportation service to the California border (See NGI, July 30 <n20010730f.html>). The Commission proceeding last Wednesday focused on the four negotiated-rate contracts of Sempra Energy and Richardson for a total 45,000 MMBtu/d of service on Transwestern during February and March. 
Richardson and Sempra "clearly did not have any 'deal' entitling them to the posted capacity before it was posted," Miller said in prepared rebuttal testimony. The two companies "had the right to the capacity only 'after' they submitted their bids, 'after' the posting period ended, 'after' Transwestern determined that no other bids were submitted, and 'after' a contract was agreed upon between Transwestern, Richardson or Sempra," she noted. 
Despite claims made by FERC energy industry analyst Barry E. Sullivan to the contrary, "Transwestern did not withhold capacity that otherwise could have been made available under recourse rates in order to make the capacity available under substantially higher negotiated rates," Miller testified. 
She noted that even Sempra Energy and Richardson, in response to a data request by Southern California Edison, backed Transwestern's claims. Both companies replied "no" when asked whether "any employee of Transwestern or any Transwestern affiliate ever indicated at any time that Transwestern would not provide the capacity at the maximum tariff rate." 
The "capacity at issue was offered on Transwestern's web site at the recourse rate in the exact same manner that all other capacity is offered on Transwestern's web site at the recourse rate; there was no prohibition, restrictions, limitation, condition or suggestion that a potential shipper could not bid for the capacity at the recourse rate; and any potential shipper, including Richardson or Sempra, could have submitted a bid for the capacity at the recourse rate." 
FERC's Sullivan contends that Transwestern's motive for allegedly advancing negotiated-rate transactions at the expense of recourse-rate deals was pure profit. Under questioning by Thomas J. Burgess of FERC's OMTR, Miller estimated that Transwestern earned $1.8 million from Sempra Energy's contract in March, $1.3 million from Richardson's March contract, and a "comparable" amount from Richardson's February contract. She noted the pipeline received a "substantially higher" amount as a result of Sempra's February contract arrangement, but she didn't provide an exact figure. FERC's Sullivan estimated the pipeline's profit from the Sempra February contract was more than $5 million. 
Sullivan said that much of the profits that wound up in Transwestern's coffers would have gone to Sempra Energy and Richardson if they have been able to acquire the capacity at recourse rates. But Miller countered that the Commission's negotiated-rate policy "does not require a minimum level of profit to shippers or contemplate any hindsight analysis of whether shippers could have gotten a better deal or made more profits." 
Furthermore, she said the Transwestern case shouldn't be used to consider changes to the negotiated-rate policy, as Sullivan had suggested. This case "is the wrong forum for such an issue because modifying the negotiated-rate policy should only be done on an industry-wide basis so no pipeline or group of pipeline customers is competitively disadvantaged." 
In prepared testimony filed in the case, FERC's Sullivan accused Transwestern of illegally charging shippers market-based rates for firm transportation capacity to the California border earlier this year "under the guise of negotiated rates." 
The Commission "has never granted Transwestern the authority to charge market-based rates for interstate natural gas transportation. Nevertheless, in the dysfunctional Southern California natural gas market, and in particular during the recent January 2001 to March 2001 period...Transwestern clearly exercised its market power to arrange negotiated-rate deals before properly posting [its] operationally available capacity on its web site," charged Sullivan, a member of the FERC Office of Markets, Tariffs and Rates' Division of Litigation. 
Transwestern discussed potential negotiated-rate transactions with Sempra Energy and Richardson prior to actually posting the available capacity on its web site, Sullivan claims. Because the level of capacity that would be available at the recourse rate is unknown at that stage (before posting), some shippers might be more "willing to enter into negotiated-rate contracts above the recourse rate, in the hope of securing some of the capacity if and when [it] became available," he noted. They "might agree to a negotiated rate...even without receiving additional value or service" because they are "either unsure or concerned that the capacity will not be made available at the recourse rate." 
This is tantamount to withholding of capacity on Transwestern, Sullivan charged. "The reason this behavior is problematic is that Transwestern is able to capture part of the price differential" between the California border and the Southwest producing basins "by threatening to withhold the capacity unless the shipper agrees to the negotiated rates." 
Although the capacity was posted by Transwestern for one business day and open to all of the pipeline's shippers at maximum recourse rates, "no party other than the shippers (Sempra and Richardson) that actually acquired the capacity [at negotiated rates], bid on this short-term excess firm capacity," Sullivan said. 
He said he found this puzzling. "At that time, capacity into southern California was at a premium...Shippers could make extraordinary profits if they could move gas to southern California. Yet, no other shippers bid on this capacity, even at a discounted rate." 
If, however, another shipper had submitted a recourse-rate bid for available capacity, Transwestern's Miller said it would have been treated in the same manner as Sempra Energy's and Richardson's negotiated-rate bids. The pipeline would have held a lottery under which it would have "randomly selected the winner," she noted. "Thus, the willingness of Richardson and Sempra to pay a negotiated rate above the recourse rate did not provide them with any preference..." 
Sullivan said he found it hard to believe that Sempra Energy and Richardson readily agreed to negotiated-rate transactions, where they came out the losers and Transwestern reaped huge profits. It "is difficult to accept the conclusion that one of these shippers [Sempra] willingly negotiated away a virtually risk-free profit of approximately $5 million, settling instead for a completely risk-free profit of approximately $200,000, while another [Richardson] willingly agreed to forego additional profits of almost $2 million." 
If Sempra Energy had acquired the capacity at Transwestern's maximum recourse rate, Sullivan estimated that the company's profits would have been more than $5.2 million, compared to the estimated $210,000 that it received under the negotiated-rate deal. Richardson's profits from the capacity would have been almost double those of last February -- $3.4 million rather than $1.8 million, he said. 
Transwestern, on the other hand, received more than $5 million as a result of its contract arrangement with Sempra Energy last February, he calculated, and about $1.8 million from the Richardson contract arrangement. 
Transwestern witnesses said Sempra Energy and Richardson agreed to the negotiated-rate deals -- and smaller profits -- to avoid paying demand costs in the event their gas did not flow. But Sullivan called this argument "spurious" since the "contracts were for day-to-day service, with either party able to cancel with two hours notice." 
Moreover, he noted that Sempra Energy would have had to pay only $5,700/day under its February contract deal of 15,000 MMBtu/d if the gas had not flowed and Sempra failed to give Transwestern two hours notice. "Clearly, the downside risk was minimal when compared to the potential upside gain." 
The price differential between the southern California border and the Southwest producing basins would have had to slip below $1.18 for the negotiated rates to have been a better business deal for Sempra Energy than the recourse rate, Sullivan said. But last January, the price differentials ranged from a low of $5.01 to a high of $9.25, with a ten-day average of $7.36.

We know how interested all of you are in the Retention & Severance Plan, so we want to update you on its status.
 
As many of you know, we have been working with members of the Creditors' Committee and their consultants since December to formulate a Retention & Severance Plan, and we formally presented the plan to the committee on Friday, February 22.  We had hoped the committee would approve the plan quickly so that we could file it with the bankruptcy court and share the details of the plan with you before the end of the month.
 
We know that many of you have career options outside of Enron and that the Retention & Severance Plan may impact your decision to stay or to leave.  We sincerely regret to inform you that approval of the plan for debtor companies is delayed.  We're learning that, in bankruptcy, most things don't move as quickly as we are accustomed.
 
The committee outlined some concerns related to our proposed plan, but we are confident we will be able to reach agreement with the creditors on those concerns.  The Creditors' Committee fully supports the implementation of a Retention & Severance Plan.  Such plans align the company's objectives with the goals of the creditors and are fairly standard in bankruptcy.  These plans are designed as a way to preserve and maximize value for the estate.
 
The Creditors' Committee also understands that time is of the essence for getting a plan in place and has established a subcommittee to expedite their review and approval process.  To that end, we are meeting regularly with the subcommittee.  We intend to work hand-in-hand with them to reach agreement on an acceptable plan as quickly as possible.  This is currently our top priority, bar none!
 
When we filed for bankruptcy, we did not fully grasp how tedious the process of developing an acceptable plan would be.  Unfortunately, that lack of understanding led management to set unrealistic expectations about how quickly a plan might be in place.
 
We now know that it takes significant time, resources and effort to understand, identify and gather the massive volume of required details, to formulate that information into a reasonable program, and to prepare a rationale and compelling presentation.  The process mirrors the most time-intensive business presentation or deal negotiation with which Enron has been involved.  That serves only as an explanation - it is not intended as an excuse.
 
We remain committed to working with the Creditors' Committee until we can reach agreement on a plan.  We anticipate that negotiation process will take another week or so, and have targeted the week of March 11 to file a motion to adopt a plan with the bankruptcy court.  We will continue to hold retention and severance as our number one priority until a plan is approved by the bankruptcy court.
 
With respect to non-debtor companies, or those companies not in bankruptcy, new severance plans are being approved and will be rolled out to employees in those companies in the very near future.
 
In the meantime, we have been working to finalize merit increases and promotions across the entire organization and plan to communicate those to employees next week.
 
And of course, we will update you on retention and severance as soon as possible.

Many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today.  We want to encourage you to come to work.  We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options.  Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process.

I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy.  But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee.  I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.  Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.

We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.  Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.  I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.  I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so.

While terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them.  We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search.  We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni.  We will share more information on these efforts soon.

I appreciate your continued patience and cooperation.

Ken

Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol "ENRNQ."  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC "Pink Sheets."

On January 29, 2002, Enron named Stephen F. Cooper interim CEO and chief restructuring officer. To keep employees informed about developments, Mr. Cooper left voicemail messages to employees on January 29 and February 8.   Since some employees do not have access to voicemail, we are providing the following transcripts of those messages.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

STEPHEN F. COOPER VOICEMAIL
Friday, February 8, 2002

Hi everybody.  This is Steve Cooper.  It's about 1:00 or 2:00 o'clock Houston time, Friday afternoon.  It's been a pretty hectic week, but I'd like to take just a moment to bring everybody up to date so that everybody is fully in the loop with what's gone on this last week.

Beginning last weekend, the Board's special investigative committee released a fairly lengthy report - in fact it's about 200 odd pages, and it's fairly pointed and blunt.  The report was troubling, and as I'm sure any number of you has seen from the various investigatory committees this week, its findings have further dented our corporate history.  Nonetheless, I just wanted to let you know that my role and the job I'm paid to do, and hopefully, the job all of you are getting paid to do, is to look forward and proceed that way at 100 percent full speed.  I continue to believe we really have a lot to look forward to.

The committee and the report didn't offer any specific recommendations.  Rather, it just compiled what they believed to be a series of facts about transactions that have been undertaken over the last several years.  Enron's board, management and Creditors' Committee are now working together to evaluate the reports' findings and take whatever action is required.  I, like many of you, am looking forward to management changes that result from these actions because to successfully to restructure the company, we're going to have to have a management team in place that is credible, that's committed to moving forward for the future, that is trusted by our outside constituents, and are firmly committed to make a new Enron work.  Next week, after the Board meeting, I hope to be able to share with you the management changes that are being contemplated and outline a team that Jeffrey and myself are compiling to rebuild the company.

The Washington hearings this week heated up considerably and made for some either very dull or very expected or pretty interesting television viewing.  And obviously, this has been translated into the daily headlines.  Hopefully, these investigatory processes will continue to help uncover and address any past misconduct or negligence surrounding Enron.  And with this, I'm sure we'll be able to establish appropriate safeguards for employees and shareholders going forward - not only for Enron - but for other corporations.  This situation, I believe, will have a national impact.

It's going to force the big five accounting firms to change the way they do business - in fact it already has.
It's going to bring in new and more effective reporting rules.
It's going to put more teeth into the SEC,.
ARISA is going to be modified.
There's not a doubt in my mind that Congress or these Committees are eventually going to look at Wall Street and the commercial banks and put them in their sites.

During the last week I've spent almost all my time dealing with the company's Creditors' Committee and chatting with individual members of the committee to understand their current thinking, concerns and issues so we can begin to construct with them an absolutely open agenda, a free flow of information, a free flow of communications, and begin to work with them to develop a plan to reorganize Enron.  As I continue to look at our various businesses, I'm as optimistic as I was a week ago that there is a reorganizable platform here that ought to allow us, if everybody is reasonable and responsible, and we can begin to put some of our emotions aside to create a viable strong company that ought to be able to be successfully reorganized.

In any event, I'll continue to keep you updated as we move forward.  In the meantime, if you have any specific questions or comments about Enron or its restructuring or anything else that's on your mind, don't hesitate to either send me an e-mail or give me a buzz and I will do the best I can to respond as quickly as possible.  If my response isn't satisfactory the first time around - just buzz me again.

Listen everyone, have a wonderful weekend and I hope to see you next week in Houston.  Bye-bye.

STEPHEN F. COOPER VOICEMAIL
Tuesday, January 29, 2002

Good morning everyone, this is Steve Cooper ? it's the morning of January 29th and I wanted to take an opportunity to introduce myself and tell you how pleased I am to have been selected as Enron's interim CEO.  My firm, Zolfo Cooper, my partners and I have assisted hundreds of companies as they have worked their way through the restructuring and reorganization process.  I just wanted to give you some of my thoughts about it as we move forward.

I can't imagine what the past few months have been like for all of you.  I'm sure it's been incredibly difficult, particularly with the glare of the media attention and the numerous investigations and inquiries that have been launched and continue to be launched.  In that environment, I've got to believe it's difficult, if not impossible, for you to focus on what lies ahead for Enron and for the organization.

I'm not going to bother to restate what is in the press release announcing my selection and our new management team this morning, however, I'd like to tell you how we typically approach situations like this.

It's been the experience of myself, my firm, my partners, that in helping companies emerge from bankruptcy, we look at a number of key metrics to gauge the potential for successful restructurings.  Those metrics are typically the organization, the asset base that the company has to bring to bear, customer base, and liquidity.  From what I've been able to tell over the last couple of days and with my exposure to the management team here, Enron has a very, very bright, very capable, very committed, hardworking and dedicated organization.  All of the people I have met are committed to reorganize, restructure and bring Enron to a successful new beginning and emerge from bankruptcy.

Number 2, the physical assets look to me to be of an enormous advantage here.  The regulated assets, the pipelines, the generating plants provide steady and reliable cash flow and provide a very sound fundamental base to restructure around.

Third, loyal customers.  Most of Enron's customers have continued to stand by the company and continue to take delivery of natural gas and electricity on a daily basis.

And fourth, liquidity looks good with the cash the company has on hand, the cash it expects to generate in the near term, and with the backstop of the DIP financing, it doesn't appear that we will have any liquidity issues going forward.

With those four resources nicely in place, I'm very confident that we can successfully restructure this company.  I don't want to leave the impression that it will be easy.  It's going to be an enormous amount of work.  There will be upsets, issues, and concerns along the way.  But I can tell you that I've seen companies in bankruptcy that don't have nearly as strong a position as this company.  They were able to emerge successfully from bankruptcy, and I'm certain Enron will also.

I'm looking forward to working with all of you over the next few months and I'm very pleased to be here.  Jeff, Ray and I will keep you informed on a regular basis as we move forward.  If there are any thoughts, concerns, issues that you would like to bring to my attention, please don't hesitate to drop me a note or give me a call.

Thanks so much, and I look forward to working with all of you.

ifically focus on the completion of some of these more challenging transact=
ions. =20

Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The information provides further details about:

	-- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;
	-- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;
	-- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; 
	-- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and
	-- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.

This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  

Restatement of Earnings

Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:

Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:

	-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997
	-- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998
	-- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 
	-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000
	-- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 
	-- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001
	-- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  

The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.

The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.

You can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>.

We will continue to review our strategic, operational and financial position, and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments.

Today, Friday, March 22, Steve Cooper left the following voicemail for employees. Since some employees do not have access to voicemail, we are providing the following transcript of that message. Please note that the retention and severance plan mentioned in the transcript is for the debtor companies of Enron.

Steve Cooper
Voicemail Message
Distributed Friday, March 22, 2002

Hi everybody, it's Steve Cooper.  It's Thursday evening, March 21.  I'm sorry I haven't gotten to you earlier this week, but we've been finalizing and dotting the I's and crossing the T's on the retention and severance plan.  It's that I want to update you on.

We've continued to present and represent the plan to the Creditors' Committee, and now they are comfortable with it and in support of it, which is all good news.  In order to be able to motion this up to the court, we are in the process of finalizing all the various documentation necessary -- the plan itself, the motions, the applications so on and so forth.  I am relatively confident that we will have this motioned up next week sometime.  This has gotten pushed back a number of times, but I think we now have it on track and hopefully next week will be the week.

I do apologize for the way this thing has gotten delayed.  Now that I have worked with a number of you over the last month or two, I see how quickly you move and how quickly you are used to moving - so, I've got to believe that this has been incredibility frustrating for all of you.  Once we get this motioned up, there is a notice and objection period before the court order is approved and the plan goes active.  I can't guarantee you that it's going to go active.  But, I'm pretty confident - in fact, I'm highly confident - that with the endorsement of the Creditors' Committee, the court will approve it.

However, we are not going to wait until we get approval to share the details of the plan with you.  We will put a process in place so that over the next week or so we will hold one-on-one meetings with all of you to discuss the individual participation and what these plans are going to mean to each and every one of you to eliminate to the greatest extent possible the uncertainty that everyone has been living with over the last several months.

The plan is retroactive to March 1, regardless of when the court approves it, so I want everybody to know that will be the start date.

On another subject, the merit increases and promotions for employees in the debtor companies have been finalized and communicated, with the possible exception of some MD's and VP's.  Hopefully, you have all been notified about those promotions.

On the merit increase side, I believe they have all been finalized for all employees below the vice president level.  Hopefully, by now you have received information as to what those increases are.  If you haven't, I would encourage you to speak to whoever you report to.

Everything else is moving forward.  I think we now have the employees meeting scheduled for April 11, and I'm looking forward to seeing and meeting more of you at that get together.  We are on target for pulling together a longer-term business plan for the company, and hopefully will be able to describe it to you in some detail on April 11.  

We're exchanging information and communicating with the creditors on a more regular and steady basis.  Those relationships are beginning to settle down.  I think there is actually a lot of good news that I can impart to you over the next several weeks.

I want to thank everybody for your continued efforts and understanding.  Again, I want to apologize for the way this thing has dragged, but I can assure you that Jeff McMahon, the Human Resource people, and myself have all been working like busy bees to get this program finalized and in place.  Knock on wood next week is the week.

Everybody have a great evening.  If you have any concerns, issues, or problems, please don't hesitate to give me a buzz or an Email and I will get back to each and every one of you as soon as I can.  Have a great night and thanks again for all your support, help and dedication to the ongoing Enron organization.

With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =
of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=
ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=
y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=
ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =
of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=
re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=
rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=
r imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=
ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=
tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=
vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=
stand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=
iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=
usly reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=
 areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=
nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=
ese include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=
r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=
me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=
 these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=
.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =
of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =
concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=
mprovement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=
ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=
 return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =
that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=
 that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=
ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=
ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=
G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=
s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=
 is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=
s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=
eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=
rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=
icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=
 reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=
ecomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =
our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=
lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=
edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       "Under Review for Further Downgrade"

-- Fitch at BBB-             "Evolving Status"

-- S&P at BBB-              "CreditWatch Negative"

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin=
 and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=
0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =
19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=
ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =
call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =
few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=
stors under "SEC Filings."

Northwest Natural In Talks With Enron Over Portland Utility=20
By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Robin Sidel, Rebecca Smith and Nikhi=
l Deogun 10/05/2001

 The Wall Street Journal B2 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)=
=20
Enron Corp. is in advanced discussions to sell its Portland General Electri=
c utility unit to Northwest Natural Gas Co. for about $1.8 billion in cash =
and stock in a highly leveraged transaction that would eventually give Enro=
n a minority stake in Northwest, according to people familiar with the matt=
er.=20
The discussions are at a very delicate stage, and some important points nee=
d to be finalized, these people caution. The current environment could also=
 make financing such a transaction quite difficult, and board approval isn'=
t a certainty. However, should the two sides agree to terms, a deal could b=
e announced in the next few days. Northwest Natural is also expected to ass=
ume roughly $1 billion in debt.=20
Enron and Northwest Natural declined to comment.  If a transaction is consu=
mmated, it would come nearly six months after the collapse of Enron's agree=
ment to sell the utility to Sierra Pacific Resources. That transaction fell=
 apart in part because of the California energy crisis.  A purchase of Port=
land General would be a very big bite for Northwest Natural, which has a ma=
rket capitalization of just $650 million and supplies natural gas to more t=
han 500,000 residential and business customers in Oregon and Vancouver, Was=
h. Portland General is an electric utility serving more than 1.4 million cu=
stomers in Oregon.  The deal would bring together two Oregon utilities whos=
e executives and employees know each other well. Richard G. Reiten, Northwe=
st's chairman and chief executive, was president and chief operating office=
r of Portland General between 1989 and 1996, and also served on its board. =
 By buying a utility, Northwest would hope to have more bargaining power in=
 its gas purchases, enabling it to buy more product and store it when price=
s are cheap. A deal would be accretive to Northwest's earnings, people fami=
liar with the matter say. And the financial risk for Northwest Natural is s=
omewhat muted because Enron is helping to facilitate and finance the transa=
ction by agreeing to take common stock and convertible preferred stock in N=
orthwest Natural in addition to cash. Northwest Natural would finance the t=
ransaction with debt and equity offerings.  Shares of Northwest Natural wer=
e trading up $1.04 at $25.99 in 4 p.m. composite trading on the New York St=
ock Exchange, while Enron stock was down 39 cents a share at $33.10.  For E=
nron, a deal with Northwest Natural would be the latest twist in a five-yea=
r ordeal that was supposed to help the nation's biggest energy trader break=
 into California's deregulating electricity market. But the utility busines=
s proved less valuable than anticipated when Enron was prevented from selli=
ng off utility contracts that enabled it to buy electricity cheaply. And Ca=
lifornia's market developed serious problems last year that made it a less =
attractive place for Enron to do business.  Enron, which also owns a major =
gas-transmission pipeline system, has a history of buying assets and busine=
sses, learning what it can from them, and then selling off the bulk of phys=
ical assets so it can reinvest capital elsewhere.  It isn't clear where Enr=
on will put the capital to work that it garners from the sale. Its broadban=
d telecommunications business is in the doldrums and it recently said it wo=
uld invest $250 million in it this year, down from a formerly projected $75=
0 million. =09

We have a great deal of work underway with our continuing operations, bankruptcy related issues, managing asset sales transitions and major operating environment issues.  While I have great confidence in our ability to overcome challenges, we will need to simultaneously direct our attention on a number of key areas to be successful.

In light of the above, I have asked Danny McCarty to take on a new role as managing director of special projects for Enron Global Services (EGS).  Danny's responsibilities will include a number of complex bankruptcy related activities, the workout of certain troubled assets and optimizing the value of selected businesses.

Until the question of our right to repurchase Northern Natural Gas is resolved, it is better to minimize organizational changes.  Consequently, I do not plan to replace Danny as managing director and chief commercial officer of Enron Transportation Services (ETS) at this time.  Steve Harris, Bob Hayes, Rob Kilmer, Shelley Corman and the business development efforts will report directly to me.

I truly appreciate Danny's willingness to take on this responsibility.  His involvement should ensure that we dedicate the necessary attention to key business issues, while allowing Jim Hughes and me to focus on the priorities of a reorganization plan and our day-to-day operations.

As always, thank you for your continued dedication and support.

Stan

In addition to my current role of leading ENA's Wholesale Gas Structuring, I have been asked to take on ENA's Retail Gas Structuring for EES.  

I have asked Mark Breese to take the lead on all EES related activity effective immediately.  Mark will maintain a lead role on a couple of important wholesale transactions that are ongoing, but he will not be taking on any new wholesale deals.  Eric Moon will retain his lead role on all West Region deals and will take the lead on all new East Region deals.  Eric Boyt will retain his lead role for all Upstream and ECR deals, and will back up Eric Moon on new East Region deals as needed.  Santiago Garcia (Associate) has chosen to stay in Gas Structuring for his third rotation to contribute his needed experience to the team.  Finally, several Associates and Analysts are being added to Gas Structuring to handle increased Wholesale deal flow and the EES effort.

Mark Breese, Melissa Solis and I have moved to the 14th floor and we will office at the following locations:

	Mark Breese	EB-1457a
	Ed McMichael	EB-1456c
	Melissa Solis	EB-1456d

We are moving to the 14th floor to initially be closer to the EES business as well as free up space on the 32nd floor.  This move is temporary as all Gas Structuring (wholesale and retail) will be located together on the 6th floor in the new building.

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

Enron Principal Investments (EPI), which was formed in the 2nd quarter, has completed its integration and the development of its new strategy.  This group will be responsible for identifying, closing, managing and exiting all non-E&P equity investments for Enron worldwide.  Kevin Garland will lead EPI, which includes Barbara Paige, Andrew Marsden, Kevin Kuykendall, Steven Sheldon, Michele Nezi Marvin and Mark Gandy.  Additionally, Dick Lydecker and the Special Asset Group will continue to report to Kevin.

EPI will pursue investments related to Enron's core businesses, where Enron has a unique insight into the market, company or technology.  Initially, this will be geographically focused in North America and Europe.  This group will rely heavily on the support and cooperation of the core business units to provide information and market insight.  

EPI may make investments in the form of venture capital, leverage buyouts, growth equity, or private equity in public companies.  The group will not make investments in seed stage companies, other funds, subsidiaries of larger corporations, or project equity.

Please join me in supporting the efforts of Enron Principal Investments.

VOICEMAIL
From:  Steve Cooper
Date:  Friday, March 1, 2002

Hi everybody.  It's Steve Cooper.  It's Friday afternoon, March 1.  I hope everybody has had a great week.  I want to update everybody on a number of things that have gone on this week, so that you all will be fully in the loop.

The week started in a rough-and-tumble fashion.  I went to a town meeting Monday night to meet with a number of our ex-colleagues.  Their disappointment, upset and anger is very understandable.  I, along with the entire management team, have committed that we are going to try to do whatever we can to fashion a reasonable resolution to their various issues.

In order to make sure that those that are truly in need have something to fall back on, we asked the court later in the week and got the judge to approve an emergency $5 million fund.  We are now going to fish around for an independent administrator to evaluate the needs and disperse those dollars to former employees.  I wanted you to be aware of that.  I really do appreciate and understand everybody's upset.

Last Friday, February 22, we presented to the Creditors' Committee a formal proposal on a retention and severance program.  As can be expected, there was some push back from the committee -- there were issues about some of the data, there were requests for additional data and further clarification.

The Creditors' Committee formed a subcommittee.  We provided to them more data.  Jeff McMahon and I met with them on Wednesday, February 27, and we met with them again on Thursday, February 28.  We are scheduled to meet with them again on Monday and Tuesday to resolve all the open issues and to get the full support and endorsement of the Creditors' Committee on this program.

I have indicated to the subcommittee that getting a plan in place is Jeff's and my highest priority.  It is not right or fair for anyone to be in a state of ongoing uncertainty about their future, their future compensation, and any financial safety net, so we are going to have to move on this at light speed.  I told the creditors' subcommittee and asked that they tell the full committee that we want to be in a position by the week of March 11 to motion this up to the court.  I'll keep you posted on progress.  I am comfortable that the committee wants to put in place the retention and severance program and now we are just working out the bugs.  Hopefully, by the time we have the employee meeting, we can walk through the composition of the program in detail.

The powers that be - management in conjunction with the human resources group - are working on merit increases and promotions.  Hopefully all the details of a program will be finalized next week.  Then, the process is typically that business unit managers begin to calculate salary increases.  And it works its way through the review, approval and communication process.  So hopefully, we'll have that all resolved in the next week or two and everyone will know where they stand with respect to promotions and merit increases.

We reached an accord with the Astros this week to repatriate to Enron $2.1 million for the release of our rights to the naming contract.  It is a shame we won't be in a position to support the naming of the field, but it is probably in the best interest of the estate.  I got a great suggestion from one of our colleagues about auctioning Enron Field signs and contributing net proceeds to the ex-employees' fund.  I'd like your input on that.  I thought it was a great idea and very generous.

We are moving forward with plans for an employee meeting later this month.  Hopefully I'll be able to meet many of you there.  I've tried to get around to say hello here and there.  And again, I would encourage you if you have any questions, concerns or issues just give me an email or a buzz.  Sometimes it takes a few days for me to get back to you, but I'm making a very concerted effort to answer everybody's inquiries.

Other than that I don't have a lot to report.  We'll continue to hammer out with the committee the retention program.  Hopefully by next Friday I'll be able to report very substantial progress in this area.  I want to thank everybody for their efforts, all their hard work and their focus on moving things forward.

One other thing ?

We did have a bank meeting on Thursday afternoon.  We have described to the banks what we believe is a very reorganizable entity here.  We'll be sharing more about that at the employee meeting.  I told the bank group, and it was echoed by management, that we believe there is a reorganizable, viable entity in Enron's future.  I'll bring you all fully up to speed on that at the employee meeting.

Anyway, as I was saying ? 

Thanks so much for all your hard work, your efforts, your dedication.  I hope you have a great weekend.  I'll chat with next week.

This has been a tough couple of weeks.  I hope that these daily communications on new developments are helping you understand what's happening with our company.

Here's a rundown of events from last week:

	We executed a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  We now have received a total of $4 billion in credit lines, which we will use to pay off short-term commercial debt and maintain liquidity.
	Our Board of Directors elected a new member to the Board - William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas.
-	The Board also established a Special Committee, to be chaired by Dean Powers, that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties.  The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate.
	The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) opened up a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry.  As I've said before, we welcome this and look forward to working with the SEC to put this matter behind us.
      Moody's lowered our credit rating one level, from Baa1 to Baa2.  Standard & Poor's (S&P) lowered our credit rating one level, from BBB+ to BBB.  Fitch lowered our rating from BBB+ to BBB-.  All agency ratings are investment grade.

Even with what's happening with our company, we have kept running our business as usual, and here's few examples to show you that we are, indeed, doing just that:

	EnronOnline did 5,866 transactions with 302 counterparties on Friday.  Transaction counts remain higher than average.
	EES signed a three-year fixed price agreement with Home Depot to supply power to 115 of its stores in California and 68 stores across Texas.  EES also has exclusive rights to develop energy management proposals for all Home Depot facilities west of the Mississippi.
      EES also signed a three-year energy management agreement with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's four New York City facilities.

Serious issues have been raised in the media and investment community that have put our credibility and reputation as a company in question.  We're taking an introspective look at our business dealings, our core values and our organization as a whole.  We're doing everything we can to deal with the issues that are affecting our company.

And that's where you come in.  Look around you.  Look at the excellence that you and your team represents.  That's the reason we hired you - you're the best.  Now, more than ever, work for Enron and especially for each other.

Thank you for your continuing support of our company and each other.

Today we announced another positive development in our efforts to regain shareholder and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and help maintain our credit rating.

We have executed a commitment letter with two of our longstanding banking partners, JPMorgan (the investment banking arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co.) and Salomon Smith Barney (the investment banking arm of Citigroup Inc.), that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  The proceeds will be used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations.

The pipelines are not being sold.  Enron is only using these assets for this new credit line.  Secured financing like this provides an expeditious way to increase liquidity and restore confidence.  We also have the capacity to increase this facility by an additional $200 million if we bring in additional banks to participate.

This money is in addition to the $3 billion in our credit lines we accessed last week to pay off short-term commercial debt and keep more than $1 billion in cash.

I know it is discouraging to read the negative media coverage about our company.  On a positive note, there was an editorial in last Sunday's Houston Chronicle that I want you to read:  <http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1107504>.  This is an extremely difficult time for everyone and I appreciate everything you do for Enron.

Don't forget to read our voice mail and e-mail transcripts covering these developments on the Enron Updates intranet site at (<http://home.enron.com/updates/>).

Thank you.
