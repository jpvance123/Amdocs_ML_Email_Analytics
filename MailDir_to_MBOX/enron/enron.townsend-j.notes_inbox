TO: Existing Firm Transportation Shippers

RE: Offers For Permanent Relinquishment of Firm Capacity in
Conjunction with the Leidy East Expansion Project



Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line ("Transco") solicits offers
for the permanent relinquishment of firm transportation
capacity on the Transco system. Shippers holding capacity
with receipts at Leidy, PA and deliveries to Princeton
Junction or mainline points in Zone 6 may offer that
capacity for relinquishment, subject to the
conditions outlined below.


Transco intends to combine such relinquished capacity
with newly constructed capacity in order to render service
in Transco's Leidy East Expansion Project ("Leidy East").
In accordance with the Commission's order of April 26, 2001
denying Transco's request for clarification of the MarketLink
Order, the Leidy East project will provide service to
shippers that had executed contracts that were filed with
the Commission on April 13, 2001, as part of Phase 3 of the
MarketLink project.  The capacity of the Leidy East project
will be 130,000 Dts/d.  In order to meet the proposed in-
service date of November 1, 2002, Transco plans to file
a certificate application with the Commission for Leidy
East by the end of June.



Offers for capacity relinquishment may be made by
shippers with existing transportation services as defined
above and provided under Part 284(G) of the FERC's
regulations.

Valid offers must meet the following criteria:

1. The capacity offered must result in a reduction of the
facilities otherwise required to serve the subscribing
shippers in Leidy East;

2. Inclusion of relinquished capacity in the project must
result in a lower cost of service for the project than if
additional facilities were constructed;

3. The remaining contract term for the relinquished
capacity must not exceed the primary contract term of
service for Leidy East;

4. Offers for permanent relinquishment will not be
accepted from shippers who have contracted for service
under Leidy East;

5. Offers must identify the specific contract(s) and delivery
point(s) in each contract at which delivery point entitlements
(DPEs)will be reduced as a result of the relinquishment of firm
capacity to those points; and

6. Offers must be unconditional, binding and irrevocable.

Such offers must be received by Transco no later than 5:00
PM CST on Monday, May 21, 2001. After receipt of offers to
relinquish capacity, Transco will make any modifications
necessary to the design of the facilities to be constructed
to render service in Leidy East.

Parties that submit offers to relinquish capacity will be
notified as to whether the offer complied with the
specifications set forth herein and whether the capacity
will be accepted and utilized to render service in Leidy East.
If more capacity is offered than is needed in Leidy East,
preference will be given to those offers which reduce the
cost of Leidy East to the greatest degree. In the event of
a tie, preference will next be given to those offers which
have the shortest remaining term for the capacity
relinquished.

Shippers with relinquished capacity that is included in
Leidy East will retain all rights and responsibilities set forth
in their Service Agreement(s), Rate Schedule FT and the General
Terms and Conditions of Transco's FERC Gas Tariff until
Leidy East firm transportation service commences through the
relinquished capacity.  The Leidy East firm transportation
service is expected to commence on November 1, 2002.
The relinquishing shipper's service agreement(s) will be
terminated or reduced effective on the actual in service date.
Transco's acceptance of relinquished capacity is and will be
subject to the following:

1. Execution and delivery by the shipper to Transco of an
agreement to permanently relinquish such firm transportation
capacity (such agreement to be provided by Transco);

2. Execution and delivery of an amendment to the shipper's firm
transportation contract reflecting any modifications resulting
from the relinquishment of a portion of the service related to
such capacity, if applicable;


3. Receipt of a FERC certificate authorizing the proposed
Leidy East facilities and service (including approval of this
capacity relinquishment) in a form acceptable to Transco in its
sole opinion.


In the event that Leidy East does not go forward for any reason,
including, without limitation, the FERC authorizations being
granted in a form unacceptable to Transco, the capacity
relinquishment shall not be effectuated and all related
agreements shall be null and void.

Parties desiring more information regarding this announcement
should contact Nancy Hargrove at 713-215-2926.

Subject: TE Pipeline Maintenance Revision

May 11, 2001

Texas Eastern Transmission (TE) will have planned maintenance work
beginning at 9AM, Tuesday, May 15 and ending at 9AM Thursday, May 17 on
the discharge of Blessing Compressor Station (BLE) and on the McAllen
line downstream of the Pemex Interconnection (PMX).  TE requests that
prior to and during this period, to the maximum extent possible,
shippers ensure that scheduled receipts into the system do not exceed
scheduled deliveries out of the system in STX, ETX or the 24" system.

This maintenance will block all gas moving East through Blessing
Compressor Station, and due to the resulting limited capability to move
gas out of STX/ETX, there will be a systematic scheduling required for
all receipts between Blessing Station and Fagus Compressor Station (FGS)
on the 24" system beginning at 9AM on gas day Tuesday, May 15. Based on
currently scheduled volumes, the cuts could have a significant impact on
scheduled receipts in the area specified.  TE strongly recommends TABS
parties rank their markets prior to 11 AM Monday.

Please contact your Operations Account Manager if you have any
questions.

Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp. will have to start the FERC approval=
=20
process all over again for
more than half of its originally anticipated MarketLink capacity. In an Apr=
il=20
26 order, the commission said
previously granted certificate authority for 404,000 Dt/day of capacity on=
=20
the expansion into the New York
City metro area has expired.

Earlier this month, Transco tried to persuade FERC to allow it to build=20
sufficient facilities to move the
gas it had under contract for the project=01,s phase three--only 210,000 Dt=
/day=20
of the phase=01,s planned
404,000 Dt/day (IF, 23 April, 4). But that request doesn=01,t square with t=
he=20
commission=01,s Dec. 13 approval of
project phasing, said last week=01,s order (CP98-540). In the December ruli=
ng,=20
the commission said that
"should Transco desire to construct some configuration of the remaining=20
MarketLink facilities and
services that differ[s] from what has been authorized (in the Dec. 13 order=
),=20
Transco will be required to file
an application for a new certificate for those facilities."

As a result, Transco now has authority to build only 166,000 Dt/day of=20
phase-one capacity, scheduled
to be online Nov. 1, and 130,000 Dt/day of phase-two capacity, expected to =
be=20
in service Nov. 1, 2002.

"As the history of the MarketLink project amply demonstrates, we authorized=
=20
Transco to construct this
project on the basis that the capacity was fully subscribed. Now, almost=20
three years after Transco filed its
application, one year after we certificated the project, and four months=20
after giving Transco more time to
obtain contracts, Transco still does not have a market fully subscribing=20
phase three," said last week=01,s order.
Transco was required to show contracts by April 13 for the full 404,000=20
Dt/day capacity of phase three, and
when it couldn=01,t do so, certificate authority expired on that date, FERC=
 said.

"Of course, Transco is free to file a new application requesting certificat=
e=20
authority to construct and
operate the facilities needed" to provide phase-three service, the order=20
added.
In filings before FERC acted, the state of New York said Transco should be=
=20
given the go-ahead for
phase-three construction because "new capacity is needed to serve growth in=
=20
the traditional core market as
well as the rapidly increasing demand for gas to generate electricity in th=
e=20
New York City area." While only
a small percentage of the contracted phase-three volumes-- 25,000 Dt/day ou=
t=20
of 210,000 Dt/day-- is
designated for delivery to New York City, the shipments into the region=20
"should help to alleviate capacity
constraints and bring down the high market prices that have been experience=
d=20
over recent periods," the
state went on to say.

Expressing the contrary view, Rep. Bill Pascrell in a short but pointed=20
letter expressed his opposition to
the proposal to build downsized facilities for phase three.

Hello All-

Attached above are the cover letter and proposed tariff sheets filed by Texas 
Eastern yesterday for a June 1 effective date.  The rate changes reflect 
under recoveries in their ASA account which tracks their cash-out mechanism 
and increased cost of system fuel.  The underrecovery in the ASA account has 
increased from $22,000 to over $22,000,000 over the period September 1--March 
31.  Texas Eastern claims that this is largely a result of the gaming of 
their currently monthly cash-out (which will likely be changed to weekly in 
their 637 proceeding).  As a result, Texas Eastern is seeking a waiver of the 
annual filing period in order to begin collecting the underrecovery through a 
surcharge that would amount to as much as $.0354 from ELA-M3.  Texas Eastern 
proposes to begin recovery in June so as to extend the recovery period from 
12 months (Dec-Nov) to 18 months (Jun-Nov), which will lower the level of the 
surcharge.

We'll review the filing to see if there are any grounds for protest / 
comment.  These types of dollars are usually "rubber-stamped" by FERC for 
pass-through but the filing to change the recovery time period may give us 
some grounds to protest the recovery.

 The full filing can be found at :  
http://infopost.link.duke-energy.com/infopost/default.asp?pipe=TE

Please let me know if you have any questions or need any additional 
information.

Thanks,
Suzanne

Sean-

Transco's 4/1/01 filed rates for the path you're intersted in are as follows:

IT   Z3-Z4 Max Rate= $.2742 dth/d 
  GPS=   $.0097dth/d
  GRI=  $.0070dth/d
  ACA=  $.0022 dth/d




FT Z3-Z4 Demand
  Max Rate= $.2698dth/d
  GRI=  $.0030dth/d

FT Z3-Z4 Commodity
  Max Rate= $.0152dth/d
  GPS=  $.0097dth/d
  GRI=  $.0070dth/d
  ACA=  $.0022dth/d

As we discussed, the settlement process in this case has not even yet begun 
so it will be some time before we know what the final rates will be.  It's 
likely that the 40% requested increase will be cut in half...but until we see 
the Commission staff's top sheets (their assessment of Transco's case), I 
won't have a firm basis for making a prediction.  As a result, I'd suggest 
that you write into the agreement that the rate to be paid will be the "then 
applicable rate" or some similar language that gives you the ability to true 
up or down as needed.

If you'd like me to put together some language for your contract with respect 
to regulatory adjustment to the price, or need any additional information, 
please let me know.  II'll forward you the tariff sheets these rates are 
based on this morning.

Thanks,
Suzanne

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook 
client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail 
via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is 
configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is 
migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your 
web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and 
To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook 
client is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) 
for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while 
connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA 
available from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  
http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Substitute "john.doe" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You 
will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in "corp/your user 
id" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You 
will now be able to view your mailbox.

 

PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between 
the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things 
in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the 
functions NOT available via OWA:

Features NOT available using OWA:

-  Tasks
-  Journal
-  Spell Checker
-  Offline Use
-  Printing Templates
-  Reminders
-  Timed Delivery
-  Expiration
-  Outlook Rules
-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall
-  Sharing Contacts with others
-  Task Delegation
-  Direct Resource Booking
-  Personal Distribution Lists

QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?

If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the 
Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:

 Outlook.2000@enron.com

Otherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at:

 713-853-1411

Thank you,

Judy,
My customer is getting serious about the Transco Zn 4 delivered deal.  Can 
you call Transco and ask if we can get firm.  Would the rate on that be 
floating with the max rate for that month, according to the rate case 
settlement?
Thanks,
Sean

Notice to:  All Producers, Receipt Point Operators, Interconnecting
Pipelines and Shippers on the Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line
Corporation System

Subject:  North Terrebonne Processing Plant - Notice of Force Majeure

Transco received the following notice today from the operators of the
Terrebonne plant.

 "In accordance with Article XVII of the above referenced
agreement please be advised that the North Terrebonne Gas Processing
Plant and Tebone Fractionation Plants shut down yesterday, May 10,
2001.  The shut down was due to a propane leak on the suction side of
one of the refrigeration compressors at North Terrebonne.  An incident
investigation team is preparing to investigate the exact cause of the
leak.  Present estimates of the duration of the shut down are uncertain
but may be as long as three to five days."

As a result of this outage, delivery points on Transco will see a
temporary increase in the heating content (Btu) of the quantities
received from the Transco system.  Transco expects the situation to be
alleviated shortly per the above notice and will provide an update as
it is received from the plant operators.

If you have any questions, please contact your Transportation
Scheduling Representative.

 Organization Announcement (Correction) 

I apologize for the confusion and inconvenience my mistake caused.  I had 
indicated that Kenneth Lovejoy would be supporting EES, but this is not 
correct.  Ken will be supporting  OEC.  Corrected announcement is provided 
below. 

 It is my pleasure to announce that Kenneth Lovejoy has joined Enron Corp. 
EH&S Asset Operations.  He will be reporting directly to Donnie Willmann and  
will support Central America, Caribbean and OEC.  Ken has over 25 year 
experience in environmental, health and safety for the oil and gas 
industry.   He has been working for Enron since 1996 and has extensive 
international experience.    We are excited to have Ken in our team so, 
please welcome Ken in his new role.

Henry  Van
