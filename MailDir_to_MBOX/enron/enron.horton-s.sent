Six lousy weeks away from me and you go do something like this.  Now it will 
no more golf because you will have too many "honey do's" to do.

Just kidding.  That is great news.  Congratulations.  I can't wait to meet 
her.  When is the wedding date?

Joint Lead Manager - UBS Warburg (f/k/a PaineWebber)
UBS has served a lead manager for the last two NBP offerings that were=20

Co-Managers
Dain Rauscher and A.G. Edwards
Both firms have a strong mid-market presence and have demonstrated their=20

Dear Board Task Force,
Bill Boswell also noted the following conversation that occurred today:

"Rae -- and just to fill in the blanks, Betsy Moler called this morning to say
that Mike McGrath had called her seeking support for his position.  She told
him his position was wrong and that the EEI board members wanted to work on
the strawman first and to have something to look at in June on that - not
the retail quadrant - although the two efforts could proceed at the same
time.  Owens and I agreed to talk on Monday following the NERC meeting to
set up an EEI/GISB board level meeting ASAP.  Mike will not be a part of
that effort; Dave Owens will. -- Bill"


Thanks, Rae

Q2 earnings report looks very good!  Congratulations.  I will keep it quiet 
until you are sure of the numbers. We should let Causey and Hayslett know for 
planning purposes ASAP. 

Given the recent events related to the proposed sale do you think it is even 
worth discussing the Benefits issue with Corporate?

Also, have we finalized all of the divestiture/retention deals?

Have a good week.  Thanks.

Hello, Steve!   Thanks for the alert!    I did just call the Pro Shop one 
more time and spoke with a young lady by the name of Ashley, and she confirms 
that you guys are slated to tee off on Sunday at 8:15AM on the Old Course off

Hit  'em straight!

Thank you Cindy!   I check with Raveneaux this morning as I was already
there.  The Pro Shop said there was no tee time for Horton.   I am sure they
just over looked it.  Just in case however,  I reserved a 9:45 am on the New
Course as a backup.  You may want to double check with the Pro Shop.  Thank
you again.  Please meeting you via e-mail.

Best regards.

Ken:

It is my understanding that we must get approval from the Office of the 
Chairman to utilize the company aircraft for personal use.

My family is holding a Holiday Reunion in Atlanta December 18-23.  Debbie and 
I would like to fly to Atlanta and back on Friday, December 22, with our 
children.  The twins, Jason and Jessica, are a little bit too young yet to 
try the commercial airlines, which is why I am requesting to use a company 
aircraft.

Of course, we would only secure a plane if it is NOT needed for business 
purposes that particular day and would be subject to company policy on all 
charges.

No problem if this doesn't work!

Stan

I recieved the same document.  If you would distribute it to the committee 
that would be appreciated.  I would think we might want to discuss it at the 
Board meeting prior to setting up another meeting with EEI.  What do you 
think?  I can see pros and cons of meeting with EEI prior to the next Board 
meeting.

Depending on the strawman I feel we are beginning to lose key support from 
the Board to work this matter.  Bill we need to get the Board to continue to 
follow him if we are to make progress.

Thanks for the note.  O agree these items Colin and you are looking could be 
good for both entities.

Subject: Wessex Water


Stan,

I met with Colin Skellet, Wessex Water CEO, last week and we agreed that
Wessex Water and Enron Direct should help each other going forward.  Wessex
will provide ED with its I&C database and, should Wessex decide to enter
into the residential power and gas market, ED could provide site
registration and gas/power price risk management services to sit behind the
Wessex brand.

Given that Wessex is Enron's biggest retail platform in Europe, have you
given any thought as to how it could be closer integrated with Enron Direct
generally?  Given current market conditions, I expect Enron will have
little choice but to hold onto Wessex for the time being which isn't
necessarily a bad thing.

There could obviously be some regulatory issues in bringing our retail
water and energy businesses together, though I think it is worth looking
at.  ED has 150,000 I&C customers across the UK, making it a good fit for
Wessex.  Also, if the Water market opens up to competition in the future,
there would be benefits for Wessex.

I look forward to discussing ideas with you when you are over in June.

Matthew

It should be the Chairman's choice but I would favor a Houston location.  
Also, please strongly consider having the Board meeting on Tuesday afternoon 
in lieu of the golf outing.  You might just get some Board members to attend 
at least one day of the annual meeting.

I agree.  I suggest the following.  Joe, we need you to go give a pitch to 
Massey's assistats about what is going on.  Next Jerry Halvorsen has 
scheduled a lunch with Massey in two weeks.  He has invited me to attend.

We need to communicate with Massey before he gets completely carried away 
blaming the interstate pipeline business for gas price spikes.  We need to 
get him the information regarding Cal LDCs failure to fill storage and their 
opposition to additional pipeline construction in the state.  Shelley -- 
could you forward copies of the LDC filings to the group.  Should Joe or I 
(or both) try to see massey when I am in town next week?

Subject: Some Background on California Gas Price Spikes--The Other Side of 
the Story

Last week, I distributed a presentation that the Brattle Group gave before 
the California Inquisition (i.e., legislative gas oversight committee looking 
into the gas price spikes at the Cal border).  

The Brattle Group is a consulting firm that Edison has long used to beat up 
on SoCalGas (recall that Edison used to be a big gas customer when it owned 
power plants).  Edison "arranged" for the Brattle Group to be the star 
witness at the Cal Leg gas hearing.  Their job was to set up El Paso and 
Dynegy for the hit at hearings that took place the following day.  Their 
message was simple (and simplistic):

El Paso and Dynegy have market power.
They have used the market power to drive up basis and thus the price of gas 
at the border (to "obscene" levels).
That, in turn, has driven up electricity prices.

Ken Lay is giving a gas talk tomorrow, and Rob Bradley asked that I provide 
the alternative view to the Edison/Brattle rant, in the event that he gets 
any questions on the topic.  It's attached.  Apologies, it's quick and dirty, 
but it provides the basics.

Obviously no need for us to defend El Paso or Dynegy, but might be useful to 
offer a more rationale explanation than the one that the California 
Legislature is peddling.

Finally, we were also fingered somewhat as culprits at the hearing (the 
California PUC FERC lawyer claimed that ENA and TW colluded to drive up basis 
when ENA controlled a portion of  the capacity), but the overriding goal of 
the hearing was to go after EP and Dynegy.

Best,
Jeff

Stan. I am a glutton for punishment with now pursuing my MBA. But it is 
energizing (pardon, the pun) and very enjoyable. In light of this, I am to 
interview a leader about certain aspects of leadership, i.e. does leadership 
develop with experience, have there been one or two instrumental experiences 
that were signficant in developing your own leadeship style?

As my leader, would you have about 30 minutes or so, sometime this week, to 
discuss your ideas about leadership with me? To maximize your time, I would 
be glad to provide all questions in advance so I don't waste any time.

Please let me know and I hope you can visit with me.

Subject: Re: Business Review

I agree that makes a lot of sense, that is certainly where we are spending our
time, and good management of that so far, is what is contributing to earnings
higher than expected....that and the crazy California markets. We're always
glad to have you visit, and could provide a detailed discussion if that's what
you would prefer. We are spending a great deal of time on this in the sales
presentations and have a number of overheads, and some written information
that we use in our position meetings that we could send to you to start with.
The rate case is in a very dynamic state, but we believe moving in right
direction. The power position is in constant review based on projected loads,
demand side management opportunities, and blocks of energy available at
reasonable prices in the future for our customers. We are still operating
under an obligation to serve, as we don't see that changing anytime in the
near future and those utilities in the west that have gotten in trouble are
those who haven't provided for customers. Commissions seem to be giving rate
increases for increasing prices if prudent management was attempted, but not
just for stopping based on possible belief of dereg. We have a sharing
mechanism right now that shares risks and rewards between customers and
shareholders. During this sales process we had spent a lot of time working
through with Sierra on this, and now with the new possible buyers. Most like
it when they finally understand. It is not regulation 101, it is very complex
and leading edge, but get the risks and rewards aligned much better for
shareholdes and customers. Doesn't fit Enron's view of dereg, but Oregon will
not get to Enron's view anytime soon, especially with California situation,
and it's not just Oregon regulators, it's Oregon customers including the
industrials that are  reliability sensitive like high techs and health care. 
Sorry for the long note....how about if I start by sending you some
information from presentations, and then we can look at schedules for when a
meeting might work. You might even want to come to one of the banker
presentations. Mark M and Mitch were both in Seattle yesterday, and could
share with you some of the discussion related to these subjects. Mitch thought
we might have another in a week or so.....      

>>> Horton, Stanley 05/08/01 09:37AM >>>
After returning home and reviewing the material handed out at the PGE business
review, there are two areas that I think I need to understand better.  The
first is PGE's energy positions going forward and the financial exposures to
changing prices.  The second is the rate case.  I would be happy to return to
Portland to get a more in depth review with a much smaller cast of players.  I
am open to suggestions from you.

Given the status of the divestiture process, Jeff wants to make sure he (and
subsequently I) have a good handle on these two important issues.

Thanks!

That is not the issue.  By putting us in the middle between GTB and Solar we 
would be the ones that would have to resolve any differances between the wo 
if the unit does not function properly.  The whole deal gets complicated 
since there is a design engineer. oerator and equipment manufacturer and we 
get in the middle between the equipment manufacturer and owner.  If the unit 
does operate properly, everyone will point fingers at everyone else,  I have 
seen this happen coutless times on EE&CC projects.  Why do I want to take 
this risk on an international project that according to Jerry's own numbers 
gets me about $800,ooo in current perios earnings and another $400'ooo 
deferred over many years.  It just is not worth the time and risk for that 
kind of money.  I think Phil Lowry agrees with this assessment also.

Would you please look into this and advise me as to whether we can do this.  
Also, Rod Hayslett is checking with Michael Anderson on whether Wessex would 
like to perform certain billing and payable functions for Enron Europe.

Subject: Wessex

Stan,
          Now that Enron owns 100% of Wessex, we need to look into whether 
Enron Direct could utilize Wessex's customer data base as a new sales 
channel, and whether we Wessex could farm-in Enron Direct's invoicing 
services (there is certainly money to be saved and /or made here).  Matthew 
Scrimshaw (President of EES-Europe) would like to explore these and other 
possible synergies in the near future.  Maybe you could schedule an hour with 
him when you are in the UK.

Thanks.  I am glad everything is going well with the newlyweds.  Debbie and I 
share some Astros tickets with some other people.  Don't know if you are an 
Astros fan but we would love to have you and Ann join us at one of the games.

We miss you on Saturdays.  I am getting better.  94 last week with three 
triple bogeys.  I can feel an 89 in the not too distant future.

Stay in touch.

Yea I watched some of the game last night too and saw you there.  I was like
"Look it's Dad!!!  Cool!!!!"  Unfortunately there was no one here to tell
that to but it's ok.  I'm glad you had fun.  I ordered flowers last night
for Mom for Mother's Day and for DK for her b-day.  I hope that's ok.  I
didn't know what to get Debbie, but I know I always like flowers so I
thought those would be good.  I'm glad my car is ok.  Please thank Debbie
for me, and I'll thank her as soon as I get the chance.  By the way, I'm not
coming home this weekend because Mom didn't want me to drive home this
weekend and then turn around and come home again on Tuesday (reading days).
David is going to drive up here for the weekend, and we are going to go to
some of the Fiesta festivities around here and the big FiestaFest concert
here on Friday night.  I will be home on Tuesday night though after classes
and will switch back cars then.  (I'll be home Tuesday till Friday morning
to bring a load of stuff home and study.  I also wanted to be there for the
munchkins' b-day party - it is the first one and all.)  Thanks so much for
taking care of my car and letting me borrow the Beemer.  It's been nice
having it!!!  I hope you are having a great day and I'll talk to you
tonight.  I love you!!!
    Love,
    Caron
PS - Thanks for letting the horses go to Nacodoches last weekend.  Rose won
both the costume class and championship so she's qualified for Nationals in
that now, and Ricki won his driving so he's qualified now too.  Rose got 3rd
out of 6 in sidesaddle, but Jennifer said it was her and not Rose (fred said
so too!!).  I'll have to get that qualification in San Antonio.  I just
thought you'd like to know and tell you thanks for giving me some more
classes to ride at Nationals.  Maybe I'll actually win something there this
time around!!!

Shelley, we need to make sure Mike knows of all the ramifications of this 
entire deal.  I have no problem with them pursuing a regulatory approach to 
the quality issue but a commercial decision would be better for all parties.

I would appriciate if you would send to me each week the PGE Position 
Report.  Also, at your convenience I would like to spend some time via 
telephone to run through the report to make sure I understand just what is 
being reported.  I'll have my assistant call to set-up the phone call early 
next week.

Also, to whom in Risk Management do you send the position report?

Thanks.

Stan,
Attached below are four PAAs for employees in Steve Hotte's organization who 
worked on the P-Gas project.  Steve discussed these with both you and I.  
Three of the four are for $3,000 each (the other is for $1,000).  Typically 
your approval has been requested for PAAs greater than $2,000.  Please reply 
by email if you approve this request.

Good morning.  I am at EOTT today and then I will go into to town for a 
little while.  Jessica is no9t doing very well and neither I am I.  Fell like 
I am coming down with something.  Talk with you later tonight.  Sorry I 
didn,t get to talk with you last night.  Both babies were real fussy and we

Stan,
          Now that Enron owns 100% of Wessex, we need to look into whether 
Enron Direct could utilize Wessex's customer data base as a new sales 
channel, and whether we Wessex could farm-in Enron Direct's invoicing 
services (there is certainly money to be saved and /or made here).  Matthew 
Scrimshaw (President of EES-Europe) would like to explore these and other 
possible synergies in the near future.  Maybe you could schedule an hour with 
him when you are in the UK.

I agree with most of this but have found from experience that if you give 
originators the freedom to pursue deals with little restrictions the deal 
flow improves dramatically.

For EOTT, we want to pursue acquisitions of energy assets period..  We do not 
need to limit ourselves to the crude oil business.  In fact a portfolio of 
assets would likely reduce the companies overall risk to crude prices.  
Second, we want to avoid any additional exposure to commodity prices.  
Therefore, fee based business structures are the best fit.  That would 
include pipeline acquisitions (crude, liquid, natural gas, CO2, etc) as well 
as fee based processing.  Non-qualified income based aquisitions are also ok 
as long as they are fee based-type deals 9IE..electric generation).  
Terminals are also an excellent acquistion for MLP,s.

Does this get to your issues?

Thanks

The normal process is to have him interviewed by three members of the 
Executive Committee who then confirm that he meets our requirements for being 
an Enron VP.  I assume you are asking us to agree to deviate from this 
process.  I am uncomfortable with that due to the fact that if the process is 
not going to be adhered to anyone can nominate a person for VP based on the 
strength of an individuals resume.  If everyone else agrees to the exception 
I won't be the one to hold this up but I don't necessarily agree with the 
exception being granted.

After returning home and reviewing the material handed out at the PGE 
business review, there are two areas that I think I need to understand 
better.  The first is PGE's energy positions going forward and the financial 
exposures to changing prices.  The second is the rate case.  I would be happy 
to return to Portland to get a more in depth review with a much smaller cast 
of players.  I am open to suggestions from you.

Given the status of the divestiture process, Jeff wants to make sure he (and 
subsequently I) have a good handle on these two important issues.

Thanks!

Hello, Joanne!    Congrats on your new responsibilities.   I don't know Bob 
Phillips and, therefore, probably won't be talking with you like I did when 
you were with Mr. Somerhalder.

I have enjoyed our chats on the phone and you were always very courteous and

  Effective April 20, 2001, El Paso Field Services will be
moving to a new location.  Please take note of the new information for Bob
Phillips and Jo Anne Sheriff.  For those of you outside of the company, you

  Further, as of Monday, April 23 Emma Means will be John
Somerhalder's new assistant.  Her phone number is 713-420-4754.  She and
John will be located at the downtown office until they move in June to

I am sorry that you don't feel well.  Sounds like you have a cold or flu 
bug.  Please go to the Health Center and get some antibiotics.  If you feel 
bad later in the week, make reservations to fly home this weekend and put the 
bill on the credit card.  I will check with your mom tonight to see how you 
are.

Subject: some questions...


 We are starting on your drafting work now that we have received the
engagement letter.  We have a few questions that need answering, as follows:

1. I need David to send me materials on Morgan Stanley Trust Co. so
that we can properly designate the right entity by correct name, etc.  If
they have any suggested or required language for our documents, I need to
see that as well.  Finally, I need for David to confirm with Morgan
Stanley's fiduciary people whether Morgan Stanley can serve as a co-agent
under a Statutory Durable Power of Attorney and whether there are any
constraints or limitations in doing so that would impact our drafting.
David can follow-up directly with me if that suits you.

2. I want to remind you to send me a photocopy of Caron's "old" trust
document, so that we may consider whether it fits the current plan and can
serve as a receptacle under the current plan.   Sending it out today

3. We talked about setting up Debbie and MSDW as co-executor and
co-trustees under your Will, with Caron as back-up to Debbie in that
position.  However, we are also going to create a generation-skipping trust
right away for Caron.  Who should be the initial trustee(s) of Caron's
trust?  Debbie and MSDW?  or Randy and MSDW?  or even Caron and MSDW?   and
who shoud be back-up?   Caron and MSDW 

4. You said that Debbie wants to name you as executor and trustee under
her will.  Who should be your back-up in those roles?  If Linda Wehring is
Debbie's back-up on Debbie's power of attorney, I would suggest that she
also be the back-up executor/trustee, but Debbie may prefer to name Caron.
It would be best if Debbie would name at least two successors after you.
 1.  Caron
 2.  Linda Wehring (alternate)

 That's it.  Please respond by whatever mode you prefer.  I hope
email is reasonably satisfactory for purposes of my asking these questions.
I tend to start with email because it is so non-obtrusive, but I'm happy to
do whatever you prefer.

SD

Mr. Horton,

We appreciate your time a few weeks ago and sincerely hope we were able to
clearly convey our disciplined investment approach to you during our
meeting.    We also hope we were able to help you to re-define the term
"risk".   Using our disciplined approach, we have been able to provide our
clients with consistent returns
and avoid negative returns over the course of the past 10 years.  We credit
the success to developing and implementing a very focused and structured
investment plan.

At this point, we would like to have your permission to put together a
proposal for a portfolio which would be constructed upon the same philosophy
and guidelines utilized by Yale University's multi-billion dollar endowment
fund.    The purpose of the proposal would be to show you how we build our
client portfolios
in an attempt to minimize ( if not eliminate ) negative annual returns while
providing above market returns.

We know you would find the proposal interesting and would give you better
insight into how
high net worth individuals, endowments and wealthy family groups construct
their investment
portfolios.

We look forward to hearing back from you.  Have a great day.


Sincerely,


William L Swearingen II  /  Vice President  David J. Swearingen

I bought 5,000 units of Northern Border Partners at $39.56 with part of the 
proceeds.  The roughly $975K is correct.  Thanks.  Any ideas on the cash?  I 
was thinking about $800k in munis and $800k in S&P 500 index fund.  Your 
thoughts.

We received the two deposits you expected this week. The amount of the
larger one was not the number you gave me. Take a look at client serve and
see if it is correct.

Attached is a draft presentation for Stan to use during his 15 minute 
pipeline safety update at the Natural Gas Council meeting in Houston on 
November 29.  Please view the attached file in notes format to see the 
talking points.  Stan plans to handout copies of the slides.

Dave/Phil/John -- please check the slides for accuracy.

The current draft does not make mention of a possible voluntary program or 
request and particular support from the Natural Gas Council.  We may want to 
add these points.  Also, the attached draft does not reflect any points from 
the NTSB hearings being held this week.

Please just call Cindy Stark to get on my calendar.  I would warn you that I 
cannot see expending money for such a book since I do not see any value that 
would be added.  It would be nice to have but I was turning down painting 
projects on our pipeline that were in the $10k range during oour budget cycle!

We cannot afford a communications or performance breakdown.  I am looking to 
you to insure that one does not happen.

Subject: Re: Organizational Announcement  

Stan, thanks for the comments.  With regard to EOTT, we plan to keep the same 
attention and focus on all of the EOTT initiaitives.  I'm a little bit 
surprised by your comment that they didn't know because I talked with Dana 
the day after I announced it at Phil's staff meeting.  Obviously something 
broke down somewhere and I need to keep that in mind in the future.  

Relative to your second concern, I'd be less than honest with you if I told 
you that I don't have the same concern.  Phil and I discussed this at some 
length but since his work on the international side was winding down and 
Hawkins really didn't have anything for him going forward we thought his 
measurement background and technical knowledge might be a fit here.  Don and 
I talked to Lohit at some length about the communications and relationship 
building required for him to be successful in the job and he felt he could 
handle it.  I plan to stay on top of it.  If I see the communications and/or 
relationships that are required for this job breaking down, I plan to deal 
with them quickly through the performance mangement process.  Hope this 
answers your questions.

Are you sure Lohitt is the right person to do this job.  What about EOTT?  No 
one at EOTT even knew that Steve was leaving before I told them last week.  
Communication skills are crucial in this job and I never thought that was one 
of Lohitt's strong skills,

Hello, Lisa!   I hope you are doing well!      Stan was wondering if you have 
invited any of Tammy's male co-workers....or is this shower just for us 
women?  Are any guys going to be there tomorrow?

No.  The GP contribution is enough.  I don't want to go to Jeff for another 
$2 million.

It looks like our GP contribution will be about $2.5 MM.    Do you still want 
to get another $2 MM on top of that?    The second part of his message is the 
potential NB unit TOtal Return Swap, or monetization that we have been 
working on.

I did get your voice mail on the potential placement of $2 million in units 
with Enron and we're working that into things.  Our attorneys commented that 
the legal fees to accomplish that (when we have a public offering going on) 
may "chew up" the benefits.  But that is their normal reaction - I don't 
think there will be any problem in accomplishing the placement.  Most likely 
it will need to be priced simultaneously with the offering to avoid any 
perceived "insider" pricing benefit.  But - do you think that will cause 
problems internally on the DASH?  The GP contribution will be about $2.5 
million.  My concern is RAC will require the $2.5 million GP investment to be 
combined with the $2 million in LP units, which I believe will trigger 
Skilling's sign-off.

On the FAS 125 idea, we have a structure that has been proposed by SunTrust 
that I need to review with you and someone in EGF.  I was planning on setting 
that up after our road show is completed on about 5-17, unless that needs to 
be accomplished sooner.  Let me know about timing and who you think should be 
involved (I was going to raise this with Ben Glisan in the next few weeks at 
his staff meeting).

Subject: MTBE legislation

Today, Senators Bob Smith (R-NH) and Harry Reid (D-NV) will introduce an MTBE 
bill. which is expected to be slightly different than we've seen in previous 
Congresses.  

We expect it to include:  

1) a 4-year date certain to eliminate MTBE, with EPA determining the phaseout 
schedule
2)  a lifting of the 2% oxygenate standard upon perfunctory petition by State 
governors within 90 days from date of enactment
3)  and environmental "anti-backsliding" provision focused only on air-toxics 
and using a 2000 baseline with a 27.5% percent standard (the way I understand 
it right now, RFG must perform 27.5% better than 2000 baseline for 
conventional gasoline)
4) provisions for MTBE producer "transition assistance"

Brief analysis:  

We'll have more details shortly, but the bill looks a little better than 
previous efforts.  A number of bills have been introduced this Congress, but 
this will probably be the leading effort.  

As you know, Enron has led efforts to include the "transition assistance" 
piece -- which is still largely undefined in the legislation -- but we are 
pleased with the inclusion of a "placeholder" while the Senate decides on the 
best approach.  We will continue to lead the development of such incentives 
(which will likely take the form of EPA/DOE funding for MTBE producers who 
convert plants to produce iso-octane or alkylate).

An MTBE ban is of course not good, but a "date certain" gives producers more 
flexibility to determine their options rather than reduce production under 
several steps of a phase out.   Allowing states to get a waiver of the oxy 
standard is probably a given in any legislation, but will face some 
opposition from the ethanol community -- who just want a simple MTBE ban.

The anti-backsliding provision is still being refined, but looks fairly 
lame.  We need more details to make an accurate assessment, but its likely 
that environmental groups will want a bit more.

One political factor -- with Sen. Jim Jeffords leaving the Republican party, 
Democrats will be given control of the Senate Environment Committee, which 
will consider this bill.  They will likely allow Jeffords to chair the 
committee.  The significance is that Sen. Bob Smith (R-NH) is the current 
chair, and has been able to use that position to drive his past bills on MTBE 
-- in losing the chairmanship, his legislation may face a longer road through 
Committee.

I will keep you posted as the legislation evolves.

It would be better if Scot contacted EBS directly about a meeting.  Kevin 
Hannon would be the right person.  Kevin is the President and COO.  I have no 
idea about whether they are in need of Spectrum's services or not.  Let me 
know when you plan to be in Dallas.  My daughter has a horse show (we own 
three Arabian Horses that she shows) in Fort Worth in mid June and I will try 
to get up there for at least some of it.

Stan;
I got your letter and company info, thanks. By the way, our President, Scott
Brown, is going to be in Dallas on the 16th and 17th of May making a
presentation to Worldcom. I thought I would check with you to see if any of
your people with Enron Broadband might be able to meet briefly with Scott on
the 15th (Tuesday) or 18th (Friday, which would be better) in Houston to
discuss our services. If they can meet just let me know dates and times and
I'll coordinate with Scott.

I still plan to be in Dallas to see Hugh King sometime in mid to late June,
and I will plan to stop down in Houston while I'm there and we can try to
get together. Thanks,

Terry

Hello, Kimberly!   Stan is out of the office until Monday.    Can we wait 
until Tuesday to send out?    In the future, we should try to incorporate a 
bit more "lead" time on items like this  just in case Stan might be out of 
pocket, etc., which is the case here.

Cindy

I want to take a moment to say "thank you" to all the employees who 
participated in the ETS Food & Toy Drive. We plan to deliver 5 boxes of food 
and toys on Tuesday, Nov. 14, to the Downtown location of the Head Start 
program.

There are many people in the Houston community who need our help and support, 
especially during the Holiday Season.  Through your generosity, the Head 
Start Program will be able to help those less fortunate .

Thank you again for your kindness.

I would appreciate if each of you could provide a brief (one-page or less) 
bullet point summary of the week's activity by close of business each 
Friday.  You can send either via e-mail or fax.

Jeff has his staff meetings on Monday mornings and it would help me keep him 
abreast of key activities in your respective areas.

I don't need anything elaborate.

Thanks,
Stan

Subject: Board Meeting on May 10


As you are both aware, we have a board meeting scheduled for Thursday, May
10 at 1:30.  The Audit Committee is scheduled to meet at 11:30 that day and
the Compensation Committee at 1:00.  All meetings are at the Enron
building.

Walt has just learned that John Duncan, Dee Osborne and Ken Lay are not
available to attend any of these meetings.  This leaves two out of three
for the Audit Committee and just enough for a quorum on the board meeting.
Walt is looking at possibly scheduling the Comp Committee for the day
before, but will confirm his plans on Thursday and will notify you if that
changes.

I am telling you all of this to advise you that if any of the remaining
board members, being the two of you, Dan Whitty and Ted Gaylord, are not
available, we will not be able to have the board meeting.   Walt recommends
we go forward with the date as scheduled, unless either of you is aware
that one of the four will not be available, or you would rather move the
date.

Please let me know your thoughts on this.  Thanks.

Good morning, Stan.  I would just like to extend my appreciation to you again 
for allowing me to join you on the visit to the Wiggly Compression Station 
Friday.  
The main factors influencing my choice to join Enron were the laid back 
culture and the treatment of the employees.  Thus, it was wonderful to see 
the interaction between the Executive and Operational team.  

Sincerely,

Thanks for the strawman.  I would like to discuss it at our GISB Board 
meeting on December 7th.  Any problems with doing that?  We have distributed 
to the Board Committee only.  My initial reaction is there is alot we agree 
on but there is much we do not agree on.  Let me know about the Board meeting.

Also, this Board meeting will be my last as Chairman.  I do not know what 
role, if any, Bill Boswell  (the incoming Chairman) would like me to play in 
the future in this effort.

In reviewing the key items of your business review with Jeff Skilling, he had 
some issues with your new Broadband business.  Please provide me with some 
more detail as follows:

It was mentioned that we had spent around $13 million thus far on dark 
fiber.  How much of the resultant capacity has been sold?  Are we laying the 
dark fiber at risk?  In other words are we taking a long position in dark 
fiber.  What is our capacity situation today?

Do you have a business plan for this new venture..ie what is the anticipated 
capital expenditures annually for this venture.  Who are the customers?  What 
is the expected return?  What is the payback on our investment, etc.

Who approved the formation of this new venture and the capital commitment?

Anything else that will help me get a clear understanding of what we have and 
where we are going with it.

Since we are in the process of trying to exit this business the answer from 
Enron Wind would be no.  You might want to contact Condy Plson to see if the 
idea has any value to Enron.

Stan,

Congratulations on your new appointment to Enron wind.  I am forwarding
this email as it may be of some use in your new role.  Mitsui is a Japanese
holding company that I have had very light ongoing discussions on equity
investments they were looking for in power in North America as part of my
old role in origination in Enron North America.  I have met Mr. Tamura only
once so it may make sense, if you have any interest, to contact him
directly.  In any case if you have no interest in starting a dialogue
please let me know so that I can get back to Mr. Tamura and let him know.

Thanks,
Rodney Malcolm

Dear Mr. Malcolm

I hope you could remember me.  I visited you with my colleague in November
1999 to discuss possible collaboration between Enron and Mitsui.  While we
could not identify any project which we can jointly proceed with, the
discussion we had with you at that time was very useful for us.

The reason for me to writing this now is that I heard from some people that
Enron is now considering sale of Enron's wind power assets (Enron Wind).
We
think that the Wind power will be more popular in Japan as well and we have
an interest in Enron Wind.  If you have any idea about status of Enron's
this effort, it would be very helpful if you could share some idea with me,
like price level Enron is thinking of and whether or not any actual
negotiation is going on, etc.

I will be travelling most of next two weeks and it would be very convenient
if you could e-mail me your response.

Stan -

Both JoAnn and I have spoken to Henry Norton at Flashfind.  We both told him
that the best way approach GISB regarding his product was to consider
membership and certification if it applied, and to send in a request if he
thought that standards should be developed.

We also told him that our organization has been very receptive to requests
for standards development, and have only declined to process a handful of
requests because they were out of scope.  If he considered that the request
for standards would improve and streamline the marketplace for natural gas,
and that it met both the mission and scope of our organization, it would have
a good chance of moving forward.  Our plate right now is pretty full, as it
always has been, but that has never stopped a company from requesting that
additional standards be development.

We also told him we would help him to write the request if needed and looked
forward
to working with him in the future.  I am not sure that he will follow up with
us on membership, certification or providing a request which would go through
our normal process.  I will keep you updated as or if this progresses.

Best Regards, Rae


The GISB mission statement, as adopted by the Board of Directors, is:
"The Gas Industry Standards Board mission is to develop and promote standards
to simplify and expand electronic communications, and to simplify and
streamline business practices which will lead to a seamless marketplace for
natural gas.  These standards will assist the natural gas industry in
improving customer service, enhancing the reliability of natural gas service
and increasing the competitiveness and efficiency of natural gas markets."

Scope Statement
The GISB scope statement, as defined in the Certificate of Incorporation, is:
"The objects and purposes of GISB are to propose and adopt voluntary
standards designed to promote more competitive, efficient and reliable gas
service, as such standards apply to electronic data interchange ("EDI")
record formats, communications protocols and related business practices that
streamline the transactional processes of the gas industry."

Stan + Mark,

as you are probably aware Enel is actively looking at acquiring water
businesses, particularly, but not only, in the UK .

They are also generally interested in opportunities in South America .

We are always looking at things that could attract Enel' s interest in
order to help us get our hands on some power and potentially gas positions
in Italy .

Moreover, Enel is cash rich and has proven to be a very generous buyer,
when it comes to acquisitions in areas of business ( gas, water and
telecoms ) that can help them to fulfil their vision to become  a multi
utility .

 I have got some decent contacts at the decision making level . Would you
be interested in discussing a potential approach ?

The Board of Directors of GISB decided yesterday at their quarterly Board of 
Directors meeting to continue discussions with EEI and other interested 
groups regarding the formation of an Energy Standards Board.

Stan Horton, GISB's Chairman, stated "while there are many differences 
between the approaches advanced by GISB and EEI, there are also alot of 
similarities."   GISB is hoping to respond to the stawman advanced by EEI by 
the end of January.  
GISB is also seeking input from other interested industry segments on the two 
proposals which have been advanced thus far.

who has an extensive experience in modeling physical flows 
of natural gas in pipeline systems. Peter is looking currently for a job.

I met him last week at the meeting of the Science and Industry Advance with 
Mathematics
society at the University of Houston.

The application of recent developments in optimization theory
and numerical methods can help Enron to improve further 
efficiency of our pipeline system and reduce the consumption of compressor 
fuel.

Please, let me know if you interested in introducing Peter to executives
in your organization. I shall be glad to make arrangements for an interview.

I enjoyed your presentation, and meeting you briefly afterwards, at the
SIAM Workshop last Friday.

I have extensive experience as a technical leader in the design and
development of modeling and simulation software products, mostly
for the oil and gas pipeline industry.

I am looking for a position that can utilize my software development and
mathematical skills.  Getting out of the narrow confines of the pipeline
simulation industry would be a plus.

Please consider whether I might fit in your group.  Your answer to a
question indicated that I have several of the skills you look for.

Also, please let me know, by email, the names and contact information of
other managers within Enron who might benefit from having someone with
my qualifications in their group.

Attached are my resume and an addendum covering academic & consulting
experience.  Publications are available on request.

I will call you in a couple of days to follow up on this email.

Thank you for your time.

Doug:

Thank you for your e-mail updating us on the Ripley Campus Grand Opening 
events.    I have purchased a table at the Wednesday, April 11, HEART OF GOLD 
CELEBRATION  luncheon at the Wortham Center, and my wife and I will be 
attending.

However, I am unable to attend any of the other events due to my busy work 
schedule.

Tell Angela I look forward to seeing her at the HEART OF GOLD CELEBRATION  
luncheon on the 11th.

Thanks,
Stan Horton

As you are aware, we have been pricing an upgrade to our Computron financial 
accounting program.  The vendor selected was Axes-One, which is the new name 
for Computron.  To keep the project on target for implementation, we have a 
quote from the vendor that is good until May 1, 2001.  This is a budgeted 
expenditure and the license fees are approximately $300,000.  

Dana asked that I run this by you before we get the license signed.  Please 
let me know if we can go ahead and execute this agreement.  If you have any 
questions, please call me.  Thanks.

Are you sure Lohitt is the right person to do this job.  What about EOTT?  No 
one at EOTT even knew that Steve was leaving before I told them last week.  
Communication skills are crucial in this job and I never thought that was one 
of Lohitt's strong skills,

Unfortunately I am not going to be able to accept your generous offer to 
attend the Indy 500.  My wife and I have 1 year-old twins and I was hoping to 
get our Nanny to pull some week-end duty to help my wife with them as I went 
to the races.  Unfortunately I was not successful in doing that.  Leaving her 
to look after two infants while I attend the races didn't seem right.  Thanks 
for the invitation!

I would love to come and participate.  I think the best I can do is come in 
the night before and perhaps(?) attend the night game and then do the golf 
tournament the next day and leave after the dinner.  Talk with Dave about who 
I should be paired up with.  I would like to play with either him or Mike 
McGowan also.  Tell Dave he stood me up last year but it was worth it.

Glad you finally made it!  Good luck on your Legal exam today.  Get some rest 
and start studying for Wednesday and Thursday exams.  The finish is close at 
hand.

Enjoyed taking you last night.  I like the time alone with you.  Saturday, I 
have a haircut at 2:30 so we can start shopping at 3 or go early and be done 
by noon.  Let me know and send me your Mother's list!

Subject: Retirement


May 7, 2001


Stan Horton
Chairman and Chief Exective Officer

Dear Mr. Horton:

Thank you for your letter of congratulation on my recent retirement.

I would like to make a suggestion, for the retirement plan for others.

        When the 27 page retirement letter is sent, that a time table of
when items will be in place or transferred         be included. (3-9
months or when)

        Medical Forms can't be put in now until after you leave.  I went
back to the office to HR and they put         the information in the
system.  Two weeks after I left I called to see when I would receive the
card (Dr.         offices like to see the card).  I was tolled I wasn't
even in the system.  So I called back to Omaha HR         and they worked
to get it in place.  When I went to get a RX  I was not in that system
either and had to         come home and call HR and start over with that
system.

        The only part of the funds that are transferred as of this date
is the Cash Balance Plan.  The Savings         Plan and ESOP are not
transferred to my Financial Plan.  They tell me they will be; this is why
I feel           a timeline would be helpful.  Until I received my
Medical Card I put off going to the Dr.  Also I haven't         wanted to
take a trip because, I am unsure of when funds will be transferred.

         Last week I received a letter from a transfer Company out of NY.
with (2) shares of  ENRON                 stock.  So I called NY to see
what Fund that was from,  they didn't know they were just to set up a
    account.  I called the Enron retirement line and they didn't know
what Fund that was from either.

        Many of the people who answers the phones about any of this just
don't have answers.

ENRON employees have been well taken care of while we are working, this
doesn't seem like that in retirement.  I share this because I know your
are always working to improve ENRON.

Sincerely,

Jean Mohring

Congratulations on getting the ROW extension with the Navajo Nation

Thank you!

Thanks for the note.  My policy is that I do not interfere in the hiring 
practices of my direct reports other to ensure that ETS is complying with all 
Enron policies and procedures.  I suggest that you contact Jerry Martin, Phil 
Lowry and Gary Smith.

Good luck on your search!

That is not the issue.  By putting us in the middle between GTB and Solar we 
would be the ones that would have to resolve any differances between the wo 
if the unit does not function properly.  The whole deal gets complicated 
since there is a design engineer. oerator and equipment manufacturer and we 
get in the middle between the equipment manufacturer and owner.  If the unit 
does operate properly, everyone will point fingers at everyone else,  I have 
seen this happen coutless times on EE&CC projects.  Why do I want to take 
this risk on an international project that according to Jerry's own numbers 
gets me about $800,ooo in current perios earnings and another $400'ooo 
deferred over many years.  It just is not worth the time and risk for that 
kind of money.  I think Phil Lowry agrees with this assessment also.

I am preparing the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act filing for Enron Corp. in connection 
with the sale of the MTBE/Isomerization facility to EOTT Energy Partners, 
L.P.  I believe that the filing should be made by this Friday, May 25 in 
order to be sure that the 30 day waiting period will expire before the 
anticipated closing date of June 29.  Please read the attached memo which 
requests that each of you look through your files to determine whether or not 
you possess the types of documents described in the memo.  I would be happy 
to discuss any questions that you may have regarding whether or not 
particular documents in your files would be responsive to this request.  
Since Enron needs to make this filing by Friday, it is important that you 
respond to the memo by Thursday, May 24.

I checked with Rick Buy's group on where they were on The RAROC analysis of 
your proposed broadband project.  They aren't doing anything according to Rod 
who checked for me.  It seems to me that we need to do several things to 
either kick this into gear or to put it on hold pending completion of a 
sale.  

1.  We need to find out from Mark Metts if this deal adds any value to the 
transactions being proposed.  I will talk with Mitch and Mark about this 
issue.
2.  We need to determine EBS interest in this business..ie are they a buyer 
or seller of Portland metro dark fiber.  If they want to be in this business 
wouldn't it make to develop this project as EBS and not to include it in a 
sale?
3.  A project of this size will take Jeff's approval.  The projected Phase I 
capital is above my threshold.

I will talk with Kevin Hannon and Mitch and then get back with you.  Sound 
like a plan?

FYI....we have added Dan Dienstbier to the Northern Border Partners' Audit 
Committee.

SEC rules dictated that we add another member, and Dan Whitty and Gerald 
Smith wanted someone with an operations background.

Dan also serves on Dynegy's Board, but neither Bill Cordes (President of 
Northern Border) nor I saw a conflict.

I will leave Houston around 10:30 tomorrow, so lunch should be around 1:30.  
Then I am free for at least a couple of hours before I have to go to the 
Hyatt.  I will leave SA on Friday at noon if you want a ride home or if you 
want me to follow you.  I think however you leave earlier than that and thats 
ok.  I will be tied up the rest of the time there.  

Love, Dad

I know of no changes we need to make to the Board or to the Committee 
assignments. I will check with Mr. Lay's office to make sure he wants to 
remain on the Board.  I will do that today and have an answer by tomorrow in 
all probability.

In advance of the May meeting of EOTT's Board of Directors, EOTT's sole 
shareholder signs a written consent providing for the annual election of 
EOTT's directors.  At the May meeting, the Board of Directors elects 
committee members and chairs for the next 12 months.  Are either of you aware 
of any upcoming changes in the composition of EOTT's Board of Directors?  In 
the past, we have had directors who have stepped down immediately prior to 
the "annual meeting."    Please advise me early next week as to whether there 
will be any changes to EOTT's Board of Directors in order that I may have the 
appropriate consent of sole shareholder signed.

Dan Whitty (Chairman), Ted Gaylord, and Dee Osborne are the current members 
of the Audit Committee.  John Duncan (Chairman), Dee Osborne, and Dan Whitty 
are the current members of the Compensation Committee.  Will there be any 
changes to these committees?

Thank you for your help.

Subject: Azurix

Stan, 
Today is Diane Bazelides' last day of work at Azurix. Over the last month, 
Diane and I have met several times to transition the Azurix Public Relations 
function into ETS. Shelley and I also met with John Garrison. As you know, 
Azurix has a lot of irons in the fire and many of them could turn into public 
relations challenges. 
Azurix has PR employees in Buenos Aires, Ontario, and California. These 
employees were notified by Diane that I was taking over the Azurix PR 
function and to coordinate their activity through me. I've spoken to a few of 
the PR employees.
To summarize what Azurix might face in the near future, here's what Diane and 
John provided me and Shelley: 
? Offers to purchase Azurix North America are due May 24. John anticipates 
spending one month reveiwing the offers and making management presentations. 
As a deal is done and made public, information and responses to the media 
will be coordinated with Mark Hudson in Ontario. 
? The Madera project in California continues. Cole Frates is on the ground in 
California and I will coordinate with Cole as issues surface. 
? Gustavo Pedace is on the ground in Buenos Aires. If I had to guess, this is 
where Azurix has the most exposure. As July and August approach, we'll know 
more about the direction of Azurix Buenos Aires. 
? As things transpire with the other assets, I'll coordinate PR activity with 
the contacts on the ground. Mark Palmer and his staff know that ETS is 
involved in Azurix. 
I have a phone call into John Shafer to discuss the use of the crisis center 
in case of an Azurix emergency. This is a precautionary measure that I hope 
we don't have to use.
Please let me know if you would like to discuss Azurix and the PR function 
further. 
Gina

Corporate comp is relooking at your contract based on our converstion..ieyou 
would be entitled to severance payment eqyual to 2 year salary and bonus 
should you decide to leave the company provided that all or substantially all 
of the Azurix assts other than ?Wessex and Azurix Bu7enos Aires are sold.

I will meet with Jim Derrick today to discuss John Ale.

With regard to Beckett and Glasford; their agreements provide for retention 
bonuses provided they stay until September 16th.  If they voluntarily leave 
before that they get nothing.  There is no employment agreements in place 
that link anything to comparable positions titles or anything else.  Should 
we move them over to Enron in Director positions and they are subsequently 
offerred positions elsewhere in Enron ( once we dispose of non-Wessex and ABA 
assets) at Director positions, then they have a choice of  accepting those 
positions or voluntarily terminating.  Since there is no contractual 
agreements with these two I do not want to offer any kind of enhanced 
severance payments to them.  I have contacted Ben Glisan regarding Glasford 
and he is polling his people about their view on an appropiate placement for 
him.

I will talk with you when you return.

Thanks.

Subject: Re: WEEKLY BUSINESS ACTIVITY UPDATES

For Portland General Electric, week of April 23, 2001
1)Announcement of termination of Enron and Sierra Pacific deal was uneventful,
and not surprising to employees and Portland Community.
2)Time was spent in addressing questions from data room in San Francisco.
3)FERC ordered the Cal ISO to file by 6/1/01, a RTO proposal with FERC. At the
same time FERC's approval of the effort by the 9 NW utilities (IOUs plus BPA)
to form RTO West was conditioned on making a 12/1/01 compliance filing that
addresses seams issues with California and Canada, and a timetable for
creating a West-wide RTO. Together, these orders should help prevent
California's efforts to balkanize their power system.
4)FERC's order on RTO West gave a boost to the inclusion within the RTO of the
independent-for-profit transmission company (TransConnect) proposed by 6 of
the 9 RTO utilities including PGE. Relying heavily on TransConnect's
independence, the Commission approved TransConnect's proposal to file for
innovative and incentive rates.
5)Wholesale sales continue strong in a robust market.
6)Thermal plants are in sequential annual  maintenance outages.
7)Hydro plants operations are reduced due to poor water condition in NW.
8)Contract negotiations continue with IBEW Local 125. Next meeting is
scheduled for May 7.
9)Customer Information System installation is approaching 75% completion,
being on schedule, and under budget.
10)Joint Meter Reading project is on target with 850,000 routes now merged
with NW Natural Gas.
11)SB 1149, Oregon's version of deregulation, is still uncertain in the
legislature. We are ready to implement on whatever timeframe is decided.
12)We plan to submit another fast track small microturbine generating plant
for RAROC next week.
13)Senator Gordon Smith reception held to keep contact on issues around price
caps, and there determental effect on energy markets and new generation.    

>>> Horton, Stanley 04/23/01 02:57PM >>>
I would appreciate if each of you could provide a brief (one-page or less)
bullet point summary of the week's activity by close of business each Friday. 
You can send either via e-mail or fax.

Jeff has his staff meetings on Monday mornings and it would help me keep him
abreast of key activities in your respective areas.

I don't need anything elaborate.

Thanks,
Stan

on the Jal project until it has cleared ETS planning group.   Jim will make
the tour Monday but will then be unavailable to us on this project until
this instruction is changed or the project makes it through channels.   Jim
indicated that he received this instruction from Rick Johnson and Mr.
Martin, (didn't get the first name).  Mr.  Martin reports to Phil Lowry.

Subject: important - something for you to ponder, and then respond please


David Hill put us in touch with Marco Crespi, who is at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter Trust FSB in New Jersey.  There is no local office of MSDW Trust, and
by local I mean in the State of Texas (not just Houston).  Marco assures us
that MSDW Trust has authority to conduct trust business in all 50 states and
is sending us evidence of same.  I am not worried about their authority to
do trust business here, but I am worried a bit about what I explain below.

Marco has informed us that, since MSDW Trust has no local presence, they
will not accept appointments to the more personal or high contact positions,
such as agent (attorney-in-fact) under a Statutory Durable Power of Attorney
and executor under a Last Will and Testament.  Basically, all they take at
this point are trustee appointments.

This obviously puts a kink in your plans as outlined at our meeting in your
office on April 3 with David Hill and in our follow-up e-mails.  We have
rough drafts of your documents in process and expected to send you some
first drafts by mid-week next week, but all those drafts name MSDW Trust to
the various positions you had in mind, some of which we now know are not
feasible.

If you want to name MSDW Trust as co-trustee on all the trusts, whether
created now or under your Will, that will work fine.  However, you will not
very well be able to bridge the gap during any period of incapacity (under a
Power of Attorney) or during any period of estate administration (under a
Will) with another corporate fiduciary as co-agent or co-executor who then
is expected to hand off to MSDW Trust as trustee.  In other words, if you
really want MSDW Trust in there for the long haul as co-trustee on all the
trusts (both now and after your death), your best bet is probably to have
only an individual serve as agent or executor (say your wife, for example),
as those jobs are temporary, to bridge the gap until the trusts are fully
funded after your estate administration is completed.

If you have any reticence about naming only an individual as agent or
executor (again, say your wife), you might consider having two individuals
named together as co-agent and co-executor to ameliorate your concerns (say
Caron with your wife?).

Of course, if you want to shop around town a bit for a corporate fiduciary
who could and would serve as co-agent and co-executor, we can provide a list
of several banks and trust companies and introduce you to most in the city.

Baker Botts has no horse in this race other than you and Debbie, of course,
and we will not favor MSDW Trust or any other trust company, one over
another.  You favor MSDW, though, and I'd like to help you work out a plan
that uses them.

Please let me know your thoughts, as I know you are eager to put at least
some of this to bed soon, and Adam Schucher (here at Baker Botts) has
prepared first drafts that require only my review and revisions prior to
sending them to you.  It just looks now like there may be more revisions
than we originally anticipated.

Sorry for the news.  Please advise.  I'll be out today after 11:15 but will
be in tomorrow and next week.

One way to proceed could be  that I try to have an informal chat with Mr.

talk, if the answer is Yes probably have them sign a confidentiality and
then either meet them with you or your people or send them information,
whatever you think makes more sense to begin with .

Stan + Mark,

as you are probably aware Enel is actively looking at acquiring water
businesses, particularly, but not only, in the UK .

They are also generally interested in opportunities in South America .

We are always looking at things that could attract Enel' s interest in
order to help us get our hands on some power and potentially gas positions
in Italy .

Moreover, Enel is cash rich and has proven to be a very generous buyer,
when it comes to acquisitions in areas of business ( gas, water and
telecoms ) that can help them to fulfil their vision to become  a multi
utility .

 I have got some decent contacts at the decision making level . Would you
be interested in discussing a potential approach ?

The game was awesome.  Our tickets were directly behind homeplate.  Debbie 
said she could see me on every pitch and knew that I left the bootom half of 
the 8th inning.  She said I never picked my nose once on camera.  Pretty 
good, huh.

Have a good day.  Talk with you later.  By the way, your car is done.  They 
had no problem removing the oil filter at all.  They only had to wriggle it a 
little bit.

I am very happy for you.  It sounds as if everything in your life is going in 
the right direction.  I think you will enjoy working in the DC ofice and for 
Joe.  I am sure you will learn alt.  Also, thank you for remembering Jason 
and Jessica's 1 year birthday.  The designer T-shirts were great and they 
look really cute in them.  That was very thoughful of you to remember.  Good 
luck!

Stan,

As you probably know, I have accepted a position as Regulatory Analyst 
reporting to Joe Hartsoe.  My last day in Houston is June 29 and I will start 
my new responsibilities on July 16.

By means of this message I want to thank you for making this possible.  This 
is a big challenge for me and opens a new spectrum of possibilities in a 
completely different arena.

I am looking forward to being a part of the ETS team.

Thanks again,

Karina

Peggy:

Considering where we are in the divestiture process, I don't think it is the 
right time to have PGE contract for and administer the Health and Welfare 
Benefits noted in your memo dated 04/20/01.  In addition, it is likely that a 
potential buyer would want PGE to come under its own Health and Welfare 
Benefits.  Switching now could entail having PGE employees being under three 
Plans in a relatively short period of time.

Thank you for sending these reports to me.  They are informative and timely.  
By the way, did you get Randy Horton's power of attorney form?  She has asked 
me to invest some of her excess cash and I executed the form and thought she 
had mailed it in.  Please let me know.

Thanks for the report.  The level of detail was on target.  Let me know when 
you want to discuss comp issues.

Subject: EWC - Weekly Update/Week Ending 27 April


1.  Aura.
     -  Received revised bid from UBS which Metts describes as "real."  UBS
will now commence detailed 6-8 week due diligence on EWC (at Enron's
expense if deal busts).  Confidence re: UBS' ability to execute remains
mixed.
     -  LJM (Fastow) interest continues, but unclear how parallel process
can be run.  Umanoff concerned about conflict when management assists
seller as part of UBS deal but assists buyer as part of LJM deal.
     -  Now that '01 numbers scrubbed, in process of revising '02 financial
projections based on detailed internal review (as of December, 2000, '02
EBITDA projected at approximately $115mm; up from 1CE '01 projection of
$78mm). This is unrealistic; I expect 2002 EBITDA in the $90-95mm range,
showing solid 15-20% EBITDA growth.

2.  M&A Activity.
     -  acquisition of assets of bankrupt Dutch blade manufacturer, Aerpac,
continues; we have closed on several assets and expect final closing in
May.
     -  sale of Greek operating projects to German buyer continues, but
execution uncertain.  Closing targeted for June 30.  Sale of Greek
development company also launched, with 2 parties expressing interest.

3.  2001 Commercial Activity.
     -  US backlog remains firm.  Projected demand continues to exceed our
projected turbine supply.  Key execution issue is confimation of
suitability of 1.5 MW turbine (primarily its gearbox) in more rigorous US
wind regimes.
     -  American Electric Power has provided indicative bid to purchase the
two Texas projects we have under development (Indian Mesa I and Clear Sky);
indicative bid price is attractive.  AEP has requested Enron Corp guaranty
of EWC's turbine warranty, like they have received on previous sales with
EWC.  Enron Corp guaranty is approved internally, but, in light of Aura,
we will continue to bargain for no Enron Corp credit support. Finally, debt
financing expected to close on IMI in May and debt circled on Clear Sky in
June.  Turbine suitability due diligence is key pacing item for debt
closing.
     -  European backlog remains firm, expect for Spanish sales of 750kw
turbine, which remains soft. EWC attended Hannover Fair last week, the
largest industrial trade show in Europe.  Our exhibit was very well
received.  CEO of German competitor, Enercon, approached Umanoff to discuss
IP issues (Enercon is currently barred from US market on patent
infringement grounds).

4.  HR Issues.
     -  US has lost O&M director and 2 key commercial employees have
expressed concerns.  Need to finalize retention program (Umanoff to discuss
with Horton early in week).
     -  Key recruiting initiatives are: GM Spain; head of global
procurement/blade MFG; European GC.  Umanoff would also like to re-visit
hiring US GM/MD, as day-to-day US operations require more detailed
oversight than Umanoff is currently providing; not clear if we can recruit
for this position in the midst of Aura.

Stan - for the future, please let me know whether this is the right level
of focus.  Talk with you soon. Adam

It was so nice to hear from you.  I am glad all is well.  I am glad the new 
home is being enjoyed and that you have a job that you like.  I am anxious to 
get the news of the birth of your new grandchild.  Please let us know as soon 
as possible after the Geraldine delivers.  Also let us know what hospital she 
is in where we can send an appropiate gift to mother and child.  My best to 
you and your family.

Dear Stanley:
  Before hand I'll let you know that we are doing great back home at Down
Under. We have bought our new home and are enjoying it completly. We
receives the photos that you sent us of the twins and we must congradulate
you that they are absolutly beautiful.
  Please let us know how you and the family are doing. I'll let you know
that I'm working doing a small delivery job for a Bakers Factory, nothing to
do with what I was doing but I like it just the same. It's a very early
start but I finish before lunch and that gives me time to look for a part
time job in the afternoon. After I spoke with Paul in the meeting, he said
that he was going to introduce me to other companies from the field, but I
haven't heard from him since then. I won't lose my hope to work for Enron
some day.
  Geraldine is doing fine and has two weeks left before the baby's due,
Chris is doing very good at school and keeping up very well with his soccer
training and Vicky is doing fine also and very happy with what's going on.
Do you still watch Stock Car racing? Let us know how things are going
because we haven't got cable tv yet so we are pretty left out on sport news.
  Hope to hear from you real soon, here's my new address so we can send
letters apart from mailing.
         8 BENNISON ROAD, HINCHINBROOK - N.S.W. - 2168
              PH:(02) 8783 9273
  Our kindest regards for you and to the rest of the family and a special
kiss to the twins.
                      Dario and family

I am at EOTT this morning.  Glad we early voted.  I think Bush has it and I 
don't think it will be that close.  Watch how Florida and Pennslylvania go.  
If they go Bush; its over.  If Gore wins these two states he has a chance if 
he takes Michigan.  Key states are Florida, Pennslylvania,and Michigan.

I am still hoping for a last minute Nader rally.  

Sorry you don't feel well especially since this your your long day.  Good 
luck on your test.  I will be at the Rockets game tonight with tthe guys.

Email later this afternoon.

Love, Dad

Rick Causey came to see me asking us to firm up our Q2 numbers.  Can we let 
Rick know that your Q2 numbers are likely to be up?  If so by how much?

Subject: Weekly Update May 7-11, 2001 

-Presentation to potential buyer went well. Questions mostly around power
supply trading, and risk/reward formula with customers and shareholders, that
is in agreement with OPUC.
-California's rolling black-outs have pushed up prices in the West, allowing
opportunities for PGE to continue to sell into the market.
-All IOUs, State Agencies (OR,ID,WA), Power Councils, BPA, and security
coordinator met to address emergency preparedness. There is beginning to be
heightened concern about Fall and Winter supply.
-Union negotiations continued, and progress was made understanding needs and
issues. Next meeting scheduled for May 21. Union seems to be in no hurry, and
needs for time to get interests aligned.
-De-reg Bill continues to be uncertain. It has become a political football,
where legislatures are convinced, who ever carries or doesn't carry forward,
depending on future power situation, will determine which party ends up in
majority, and as governor in the state. Politics....ugh
-Final contracts should be received tomorrow. Will work to turn them around as
quickly as possible, but I know people will need a few days with them, and a
few more issues may need to be addressed. There are some employment
agreements, and other contracts that were put in place by others, that have
created some benefits, that people feel they are giving up with new
agreements. Some is perception, some is real, some is lack of trust for
Enron's  intent, when things are not written precisely.

You are beginning to realize that time goes by awfully fast and we had better 
enjoy what we are doing while we are doing it.  You never get another chance 
at today!!  End of my phiposophical analysis of life for tday!

You are welcome to the car.  I will try to bring it tonight or better still 
can your Mom bring you over to get it tomorrow.  Either way is ok.

I think the best way to handle this is for you to get with Mary Joyce and her 
team and work out the details.  I think the last item may be of some 
concern.  If there are issues that can't be resolved between Mary and you I 
will gladly get involved.  Does this sound like a good plan?

Thanks but I will pass for now.  I wouldn't mind looking at some muni's with 
shorter maturity dates though.  I am concerned about long-term yields 
increasing which would mean bond prices decreasing.  Doesn't it make since to 
go with shorter maturity dates ri8ght now?

The Muni desk called to say they are seeing a blip in the market and are
seeing  5 1/4% at par around 2021 to 2025. They think those rates won't
last.

They called about your portfolio because your ladder is is thin in those
years.

You have some cash. If you have an interest give me a call. I can fax your
maturity concentration schedule  to you if you need it. I didn't want to
send your portfolio info by fax  without your permission.

The Red Rock expansion needs to get  approval at the May 1st Board meeting.  
The procedure is to submit it to the Finance Committee of the Board for 
approval . Assuming the Finance Committee approves the project they would 
recommend it to the Board for approval.  By this memo, I am requesting that 
Rod coordinate with Rick Buy to get it on the Finance Committee agenda.

I will be in town for both the Board meeting and the Finance Committee 
meetings.  If formal presentations are required at the Finance Committee we 
can decide who should do them.  It is my understanding that no presentation 
needs to be done at the Board meeting.  I will check with Jeff to see if he 
wants a formal presentation to the Finance Committee or if he will do it 
himself.

Subject: Methane Auto

Hello Stan,

Couple of people called me to inquire about Enron's interest in investing in 
a methane car kit and filling infrastructure.  They wanted to submit an 
unsolicited proposal to Enron.  I indicated to the that I would first check 
to see if Enron would be interested in a venture of this type.  According to 
these two gentlemen the return on investment is very good, ranging from 15% 
-  40%.  

Would Enron be interested in this type of business?

Regards,

Henry

Cindy,
Will you please add my new Administrative Assistant to your future "cc" 
lists?  She is Sarita Garza.  Thanks so much.  John

P.S.  I have asked Sarita and Amelia to get with you and see when a favorable 
date would be that Phil Lowry and I could have about 30 minutes with Stan to 
go over the "Operations Alliances" with him (since his half day staff meeting 
was cancelled for May 16).  Anyway, this is just a heads-up that they will be 
in touch to get a date confirmed.  Thank you.  JHS

If you are bored go work out!  That is time consuming and good for you.  That 
is fine with the credit card.  If you work out it is ok to go shop and put it 
on the credit card.  Just not too much.  By the way DK's birthday is April 30 
and the JJ's are May 2.  No one expects presents but it would be nice if you 
got DK a card.  She is taking your car in today to be fixed.

Have fun at the game tonight.  My week is going just fine.  Nothing exciting
to report.  By the way, there is $50 at Mom's that is for you because David
flew home from here last night, and we had to order the ticket on the credit
card.  The ticket was $68.75 so he'll give you the last $20 next time he
sees you.  I hope that is ok.  You had said once that I could always use the
credit card for things like that as long as I paid you back so I did.  You
can either get it from Mom or wait till I get home and I'll bring it to you.
With all the prom excitement I completely forgot to give it to you before we
left - sorry.  Anyway, this week is pretty boring for me because I have
nothing due and no exams.  I'm glad to have a light week, but it leaves for
a lot of boredom and down time.  I may have to find something to do

I know how incredibly busy you all are, so I'm sure that making a pledge to
Jeff for the MS150 has simply slipped your mind.  Well the ride is this
weekend, time is running out and we need you!

Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise
$50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't
you consider helping him reach his goal?

Thanks for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you
tomorrow...

Sherri :-)

Thank you Cindy!   I check with Raveneaux this morning as I was already
there.  The Pro Shop said there was no tee time for Horton.   I am sure they
just over looked it.  Just in case however,  I reserved a 9:45 am on the New
Course as a backup.  You may want to double check with the Pro Shop.  Thank
you again.  Please meeting you via e-mail.

Best regards.

Subject: environmental insurance for EOTT

You asked for a time line on securing this quote.  

I have already discussed the general concept with Marsh Mac and a bit of 
strategy on how we would approach this with AIG.  

Lou,  I need you to give me the data that we have available on these lines.  
As I mentioned to you, I want to go to the carrier  with what I have to offer 
them instead of them dictating to me what they want.   Until I get this I am 
strictly talking in a vacuum and can get nothing moving forward.  

After that, I would think that I could have a quote from them within 30 
days..I will shoot for better than that.  I feel however that this quote/due 
diligence will be much more intensive on their part  given their experience 
with EOTT,  I can definitely ask for an answer within a specified time 
frame.  Is 30 days acceptable? 

 Hope this answers your questions.  If not please let me know.

Sounds good - thanks.   Peggy

>>> Horton, Stanley 04/11/01 07:13AM >>> 
I checked with Rick Buy's group on where they were on The RAROC analysis of
your proposed broadband project. They aren't doing anything according to Rod
who checked for me. It seems to me that we need to do several things to either
kick this into gear or to put it on hold pending completion of a sale. 

1. We need to find out from Mark Metts if this deal adds any value to the
transactions being proposed. I will talk with Mitch and Mark about this issue.

2. We need to determine EBS interest in this business..ie are they a buyer or
seller of Portland metro dark fiber. If they want to be in this business
wouldn't it make to develop this project as EBS and not to include it in a
sale? 
3. A project of this size will take Jeff's approval. The projected Phase I
capital is above my threshold. 

I will talk with Kevin Hannon and Mitch and then get back with you. Sound like
a plan?

Subject: PGE retention program

Here's the updated spreadsheet based on Peggy's email and our understanding 
of the programs.

Peggy, Joyce's reason for requesting an exception for Mary Turina (front 
loading and increasing retention bonus or guarantee payment of sales bonus) 
is "Due to the special nature of the trading floor and the on-going need we 
have to retain people in this area"...here's how I see it

Factors:
(1) seems like Mary just went into that position...but, if she's already 
established a reputation and is being heavily recruited, then maybe a higher 
number on retention is justifiable
(2) she works 80% - i know that's not indicative of productivity, but it 
seems our flexibility should be worth something in the retention bucket
(3) she only has about $100k of unvested equity remaining
(4) as currently contemplated, Piro and Lesh would get about $250k (compared 
to $200k for Mary) in retention value - but this points back to (2) somewhat 
and potential internal inequity issues if increased values or exceptions get 
out

The most important factors are:
(5) the risk of losing Mary to a competitor and 
(6) whether that loss would significantly disrupt the sale process or ongoing 
operations of PGE
If these factors are, in fact, problems, then it probably makes sense to 
increase Mary's retention bonus.  If we get into front loading her retention 
bonus, then I'd want to get some strong non-compete and non-solicitation 
language in the documents.  The reason for front-loading the retention grants 
for Fowler/Miller is to provide some consideration/incentive for giving up 
"window" payments.

Peggy, if you still feel strongly about increasing Mary's retention bonus 
after reviewing my thoughts, I don't have a problem with $250k, but if we 
start to get into the $300k - $400k range or front-loading any portion, I'd 
like to get Stan's sign-off.

Thank you for the summary Aaron, I don't think you misrepresented anything,
but there are a couple places that I have questions, or the amounts you show
are different than what I was expecting.
1)My records showed our last discussion around Lobdell showed his sales bonus
at $225,000. and this shows $250,000. which I am OK with, but if total dollars
are limited, I might need the $25,000. for some other individuals.
2) I had emailed before that Quennoz, Johnson, and Ryder were lower than the
last plan, although this was the 'old' retention  plan. I had propposed
Quennoz and Johnson going to $250,000., which gets them to previous level, and
Ryder to $225,000., and that Barnett would need an increase to keep equity to
$225,000. If $250,000. is too high for Johnson and Quennoz, I could probably
be OK with $225,000. for each of them, but they should be as high as Nichols,
and Barnett should also be as high as Nichols.
3)I had also had Joyce Bell ask you a question about Mary Turina, and payment
of sales bonus at earlier of sale or some timeframe like 2 to 3 years.
Probably what I'm really suggesting here, is maybe we need to increase her
retention, and decrease her sales or something like that, and a front loading
might work here too, with incentive to have to stay.   
Thanks for all your help and work on this Aaron. Please call if you have
problems understand my notes. 503-464-8401

Here are the numbers for the PGE retention programs.  

Stan, I've reviewed Peggy's recommendations for these programs (Retention and
Sales Bonus Programs) and they seem reasonable in light of the imminent
divestiture of PGE and our associated needs - let me know if you're ok with
the numbers.

Peggy, let me know if I've misrepresented anything.

I will be working with Kriste Sullivan (Enron attorney) to implement these
agreements and supercede the prior agreements.  We are hoping to have the
agreements signed and executed by May 13.

Aaron

 I understand we get one free use of the Museum, maybe we can use it for the 
Christmas Party. Thanks... JOHN.
