Awesome dude!  I'll definitely be around.  Hey, maybe you can bring my wine 
(or the empty bottles which is probably more likely).

I want my bed, too.  Ideally, I'm going to take a nap when I get home so I 
can go out later.  If I can't nap then I'm not going out because I definitely 
want to go out tomorrow...not too hard though because I'm saving some steam 
for NYC baby.  The AGA storage injection number came out low, so I think 
we're losing a bunch of money today.  Oh well, it's the new year.  Don't you 
want to hear about my new project, though?  I can tell because you're so 
inquisitive...I guess I'll just wait for the weekend.  Later.

Tom,

I believe that your right up correctly interprets the current model, but as 
we discussed, I think the more correct methodology is to use the next day's 
cash price since the Gas Daily print is for gas traded the previous day and 
delivered the same day as the print.  If I'm trading day gas on April 7th, 
the prices I'm basing my decisions on are those represented in the Gas Daily 
print for April 8th.  If we do not change the model, I think we need another 
sentence to clarify that the cash prices a day behind.  Of course, eventually 
we need to fix the model.

Mat

Tom,

I took a few days off and just got back....

Anyway, I haven't tried it without the key, but if you say it works, then I'm 
sure it does.  One thing I'm realizing, though, is that it's taking me way 
too much time to babysit this thing through multiple runs of the model even 
when it does work.  In order to get the full benefit of your model I want to 
run it a zillion times for many different combinations of parameters.  So, if 
you haven't guessed already, I'm wondering how hard it would be to get this 
thing to zip through some preset combinations of parameters and save the 
results without me tending to it.  I envision a spreadsheet where I list out 
all of the parameter values for each run, and the model picks out the 
parameters, runs through a year's worth of data, and saves the summary sheet, 
then steps to the next set of variables.  In this way I could set it to run a 
bunch of times over night or something so it wouldn't tie up the work day.  
Would this be just a separate macro?  What do you think?

Mat

Hi Mat,
I took away your licence key from the back of your PC yesterday.  The 
problems with our network licence for the solver have gone away - I do not 
really understand what happened.  Try the model aand see if it works OK - 
runs fine on my computer now, whereas it did not run 2 weeks ago.  I suspect 
some sort of network problem, and IT have not been able to figure out any 
more likely cause.

Just wanted to let you know I split the West_2 report into two reports as we 
discussed.  The other report is called West_3.  Also, the CIG/WIC report 
should be added to your webpage, but it's not ready yet.  Thanks.

Hey, we need to talk.  So far I've gotten Duncan's check and that's it.  I 
have not gotten the place yet, since I was waiting for you to tell me that 
they are on their way.  Since I have not heard from you, I'm assuming they 
are not....so what's up?  I still need everyone's email because I don't not 
have those original messages with everyones address on them.  I think it 
would be great if everyone who's commited could send me an email just saying 
when they plan on paying...I guess it's really only your friend and Duncan's 
friend, so I guess it's not really a big deal.  I don't know, I guess I just 
don't have a warm fuzzy feeling because you're the only person I speak to and 
I often times have trouble getting in touch with you, which by the way, you 
never did reply to my email asking how often you read you email so I know 
whether I should use it to get in touch with you.

Anyway, I just got back from NYC...had a great time, except for the fact that 
Scully feels the need to build a wall between us.  I can deal, but its just 
kind of annoying.  I just feel the need to put this skiing thing to bed 
quickly.

Hey baby,
If you haven't already, I say let's go with the 22nd-25th in Feb.  We have
our six and can add on others as they fill in, but I'm done waiting for
people to get back to me!!!! Did you get my card yet?
Can't wait!!!

The snow was heavy on Sunday but what a great time!!!   Last night I took a
lesson and we hit the moguls (or as those "in the know" refer to them as,
"the bumps").  What a rush.  My ski's are a tad long for me (180's) and so
it was tough at first but about three runs into it I started feeling the
rhythm and that was it....total addiction!!

So what's going on???

love, k

Chris said you had problems gettting to the manual entry website.  The link 
is http://fundamentals.dev.corp.enron.com/admin/manualentry/

Socal Manual Entry is the correct pipeline to choose (a slight change from 
Socal).  Also, we need to start entering the Clay basin numbers under the 
Questar Manual Entry pipeline, however, Chris Hyde is working to set up the 
page so that a delivery and a receipt value can be entered.

Thanks for reminding me, I was in the process of emailing you, but I got 
distracted.  Anyway, it was working for Ken because he had someone's password

Louis,

When I started July 31st, you arranged parking for me in the Regency garage 
until the time that a spot opened up to get on an Enron contract (I am not 
currently).  I haven't heard anything, and I know some people that have 
obtained Enron parking.  I signed my name to a list that you circulated at 
orientation.  Is there something further that I need to do?

Sara,

Yo, what's up?  How are things across the street?  Let me guess, you got all 
rested up saturday and sunday, then when out three nights already this week, 
and now are ready to go home, do laundry and sleep.  Unfortunately, I've been 
extremely lame, mostly because you got me sick...well maybe not.  Anyway, I 
haven't been feeling so hot, yet I did oversleep by two hours this morning 
which really helped.  Poor Ted had to pick the slack.  So, any big plans for 
the weekend besides laundry?  Superbowl?  Happy hour?  Toilet flushing into 
the phone?  Stupid drunk?  

Mat

Well, it wasn't that bad.  I was delayed a half an hour from Newark and then 
was only about a half an hour late getting into Houston.  I made it to bed by 
12:15 am and managed to drag myself out of bed at 5 am.  I have a bunch of 
work to do this week which SUCKS, but I'm interested and excited about what I 
have to do, so it's good.  Fortunately this scheduling thing has become 
second nature so I don't really have to think too much this morning.  How are 
you?

Mat

Well if you're still there, I hope the studying is going well.  Malo means 
bad.  I feel bad because today was a big cluster fuck on the socal system.  
The reason I feel bad is Jan was out today (she usually does Socal) and 
either Ted or I was going to fill in for her.  Neither of us wanted to do it, 
and Ted got stuck with it.  Well...I would have done it, but I was out until 
2 am last night and I didn't want to fuck up because of it.  Socal can be 
high stress because there are huge time constraints and its the most 
expensive gas in the country.  Anyway, a bunch of shit got fucked up.  It's 
not Ted's fault, but he really had a rough day because of it.  I think I 
might have been able to do a better job, but I knew there was chance for 
error because neither of us have done it in a while.  I feel bad.  
Regardless, I'm pretty whipped and am looking forward to going home.  Of 
course, I have a whole weekend of work to look forward to!  

Anwyay, it looks like I'm about done here, so I have one last word for 
you..........................Adios.

Well, thank you for the clarification.  I was confused because I was hanging 
out with him Friday at happy hour and he said he was busier than ever.  I 
mentioned that I talked to you, and he had nothing but nice things to say 
about you.  Hope all is well.

Phillip,

Here's a copy of the spreadsheet we gave to Bill Bradford.  Our exposure  on 
the financial deals increased relative to the february spreadsheet from $45 
mil to $71.  Also, we have one physical deal (next winter), which is not 
physical storage, that is marked at $12 mil.  The spreadsheet shows five 
synthetic storage deals with PGE Energy Trading that may have the wrong 
counterparty in our system.  I'm at the office and will be here through the 
meeting.  My cell number is 832-444-7702 if you have any questions.

Matt,

Hey, thanks for returning my call.  As you're probably out from work, I'll 
try you again when I get in tomorrow (thursday).  I basically just wanted to 
touch base again since Ken has now moved on and left me with our synthetic 
storage project.  I'm also looking for a legal and EOL contact to help us 
develop a contract and run the bid process through EOL.  You may have 
provided these to Ken, but I can't get in touch with him.  Thanks again.

Mat

David,

This one is very similar to the one you just did.  In fact, the data is 
almost identical.  We download power plant outage data from the California 
ISO website (manual until you guys get some free time to set up an automated 
scrape).  Anyway, the data gets into an Access database of mine in a table 
with key fields:  Date and Res Name.  The other fields include Type (planned 
or unplanned), Owner, Location, plant capacity, and of course, the quantity 
of the outage.  So, we need basically the large table as the one you did 
which lists each plant and the outage for "today" and let's say 1 week in the 
past.  We cannot go in the future because the data gets posted daily for that 
day only.  Then the other table will just summarize the total "Planned" and 
"Unplanned" by region.   A copy of the database is attached.  Let me know 
when you have a chance to start working on it.  Thanks.

Can you please add this link to the fundy website under the Power tab.  It 
should be called "Proposed Gas Generation Plants".  Thanks.

Chris, 

The IHS DRN's are identified in red below.  Please make one up for the 608 
Novelty Hill M/S point.  Thanks.  

Mat

PS.  This just reminded me that we need to start scraping that additional 
PG&E point that we discussed last week.

Subject: Northwest Foreign Key Problems

Hello...since I was working to reload some cycle 13 data for Northwest today, 
it seemed like a good a time as any to take care of these few foreign key 
violations as well.  These 4 points are reported on the Northwest site, but 
do not appear in our PIPELINE_LOCATION table as of yet (hence the foreign key 
violation):

458 OWYHEE COMPRESSOR - 3553
611 NORTH DOUGLAS RECEIPT (2001) - 37032
608 NOVELTY HILL M/S - (mkup one)
612 FOUNDATION CREEK PLANT (2001) - 2603


If we can get these matched to their IHS DRN counterparts, that would be 
great.  If not, we can make up the IHS number as we have in the past.

Thanks,
Chris

Start/End Date
Spreads
Max Inj/With rates
Max Storage volume
Selected Curve
Storage Facility

I'm free all week, so let me know when and where if you want to get together.

Hi Matt,
Multiple values for parameters - sounds OK.  I'd add an extra run option to 
the menu bar, and you could set up a list of parameters on a separate tab, 
each line corresponding to a complete run.  How about a meeting tomorrow when 
you could tell me what parameters need to be varied?

Tom,

I took a few days off and just got back....

Anyway, I haven't tried it without the key, but if you say it works, then I'm 
sure it does.  One thing I'm realizing, though, is that it's taking me way 
too much time to babysit this thing through multiple runs of the model even 
when it does work.  In order to get the full benefit of your model I want to 
run it a zillion times for many different combinations of parameters.  So, if 
you haven't guessed already, I'm wondering how hard it would be to get this 
thing to zip through some preset combinations of parameters and save the 
results without me tending to it.  I envision a spreadsheet where I list out 
all of the parameter values for each run, and the model picks out the 
parameters, runs through a year's worth of data, and saves the summary sheet, 
then steps to the next set of variables.  In this way I could set it to run a 
bunch of times over night or something so it wouldn't tie up the work day.  
Would this be just a separate macro?  What do you think?

Mat

Hi Mat,
I took away your licence key from the back of your PC yesterday.  The 
problems with our network licence for the solver have gone away - I do not 
really understand what happened.  Try the model aand see if it works OK - 
runs fine on my computer now, whereas it did not run 2 weeks ago.  I suspect 
some sort of network problem, and IT have not been able to figure out any 
more likely cause.

We need to work out a system here Kristen.  Why is it you are so freakin hard 
to get in touch with?  I asked you how often you check email, but you've 
never told me, once a day, week, what?  And this cell phone thing...Do you 
have it with you all the time...is it on...if not, how often do you check 
voicemail...how long after I leave a message should I expect to here from 
you?  I'm generally impatient, which is why it kills me to wait to hear from 
you, especially when I have not idea of what time frame to expect.  

Anyway, I really need to make plans, otherwise I'm going to go to Utah with 
Dave, or San Fran, or Puerto Rico.

Yan,

The merged reports look great.  I believe the only orientation changes are to 
"unmerge" the following six reports:  

31 Keystone Receipts
15 Questar Pipeline
40 Rockies Production
22 West_2
23 West_3
25 CIG_WIC

The orientation of the individual reports should be correct.  Thanks.

Mat

PS.  Just a reminder to add the "*" by the title of calculated points.

okay, i'm taking a break from trying to figure out this excel spreadsheet i'm 
working with.  it took me forever to remember how to use pivot tables.  it's 
pretty interesting though once i get past all the annoying parts.

well, i really would prefer to explain my thoughts to you through another 
media (i.e., speaking to you), but i guess you need to know asap, so i'll 
attempt it through email (even though i HATE email for explaining my thoughts 
b/c there's always misunderstandings).  i guess the reason i'm very hesitant 
about you coming is b/c i don't know what you expect from the visit.  we both 
know things are obviously different b/w us more recently than they had been 
when you initially moved.  i'm not sure about the reasons you feel different 
about me, but i can attempt to explain the reasons i feel different about 
you.  first, we don't really see each other often and that obviously makes 
someone feel less for a person, regardless of who it is (you have agreed with 
this).  second, since i started my job and have other things going on in my 
life, i realized that nothing will happen with us and i don't like being 
emotionally tied to someone knowing nothing will happen.  so, i've tried to 
get rid of all my feelings for you.  also, i don't like limiting myself as if 
something will happen. i don't know about you, but regardless of how much we 
said we weren't anything and we were free to do what we want, there was still 
a limit on what we could do.  with us visiting each other (in more than a 
friendly way), i felt somewhat limited. by limited i mean i always felt i 
could not be even slightly serious with someone else with us visiting each 
other as more than just friends.  don't worry, there isn't anyone else, it's 
just the thought of feeling limited if the opportunity arises that i don't 
like (especially when i've realized it's hopeless to expect anything with 
us).  so, i guess the reason i'm nervous about your visit is b/c i think you 
would want it to be like our other visits (i.e., you stay over my place...in 
my bed...and we hang out together all weekend) where i don't think i want 
that.  i would like if you visited, but not how we usually visit.  those are 
my thoughts (although not clearly explained b/c of hte email thing).

let me know what you think...

Trading was boring today, well, boring because I'm not participating yet.  
Soon though.  The superbowl isn't until 6 pm I think, so yes, I say we go 
someplace or your place.  I'll just tell everyone I have to work, which I do 
anyway.  It'll be my second to last weekend stint.  I'm jealous about you 
being in NY.  Have a drinky for me.  I'm going to look for some pussy on 
saturday...big "frat" style party at some chics place.  Too bad you're 
away...I'm sure we could do well.  Anyway, have fun in NY.

I need to be able to pull price curves from the Oracle database.  Can you 
please see to it that I get the proper access tomorrow.  This is required for 
a special project for Phillip, so it is high priority.  Let me know if you 
need any further clarification of what I need, but I think IT should know.

5.  MAXIMUM_CAPACITY_QTY
6.  UTILIZED_CAPACITY_QTY

I am available for any of those dates with very little preference which.  I 
would prefer a month long stay.  Ammenities required include, very large hot 
tub filled with booz, many beds with soft satin sheets, a fuck swing, a large 
(I mean really large) TV for various pleasure movies, a steam room, a maid, 
and a chef.  I also require that you keep me informed of the attending 
women.  I need to know as soon as possible whether I need to fly in my own to 
take advantage of such ammenities..  Gracious.

With love and anticipation of a memorable trip,

Mateo.

It's me, your favorite coworker!  Attached is, yet again, an Access file with 
a table of historicals for clay basin (Questar pipeline).  Before they can be 
loaded, however, a new location needs to be added with DRN:  EBBCLAYHIST

Brief, 

Sorry for being such  a loser by not getting in touch with you a little 
sooner.  It's totally my fault.  Anyway, I do want to catch up with you 
sometime.  Also, I will be back in NY in two weeks, but only for one day.  
So, check your calendar for the Sunday after Thanksgiving.  I'm getting in 
early in the morning, so maybe we could go out to lunch or something.  I'll 
give you  a call sometime this week.  When are the best times to get a hold 
of you?  Here's some digits for you:

w.  713-853-0472
h.  713-784-8180
m. 832-444-7702
p.  713-716-0795

You can pretty much get a hold of me anytime.  I usually work till around 6 
pm.  Anyway, I speak to you soon.  

El Presidente

Jennifer,

As it stands right now, don't count me in for dinner.  I may call you tonight 
or tomorrow if it works out that I can come.  I think my friends would like 
it, but they're here seeing someone else as well.  If I don't make it to 
dinner, we'll definitely meet you guys out afterwards.

What are we going to do, Brief.  I can only say that will probably hit the 
City sometime during the upcoming holidays.  I will promise to give you some 
warning so that we can get together, and maybe I'll even stay more than a day 
this time...

Anyway, I hope your Thanksgiving was nice, although it sounds like your work 
responsibilities are indifferent to holidays.  I had a nice time at home and 
I saw Rent while I was in the City Sunday.  I give you a call soon.

Good Morning.   Sorry I didn't call last night...I went out and it was late 
when I got home, and not knowing how late you were going to be out, I decided 
not to take the chance of waking you.  So did you have a good time?  Who did 
you go with?  I didn't think you were going out until the weekend - you 
little party animal.  That means you must have missed Buffy and Angel!  Oh I 
bet you taped it though, and no I didn't watch them incase you were 
wondering.  

Remind me to tell you about a new project I may get involved in.  If I kick 
ass, there's a small chance it could be a fast track to getting a trading 
book.  Oh, and have you talked to Dave lately?  He said his dinner went well, 
and although they didn't offer as much money as he was hoping, I think it was 
a lot and I bet the farm that he'll take it.  Anyway, I have to run.

Have a nice day.

Tom,

Thanks for the new version.  I finally got the other version to work, but 
only by running it on Ken's computer.  I have some questions regarding the 
summary sheet, and I plan on spending a significant amount of time with the 
model this weekend....so yes, let's meet tomorrow if possible.  I'm free 
anytime except between 9:30 am and noon.  Just name the time and place.  I 
also need to get familiar with the model used in Chicago for the real time 
decision making.  Speak to you soon.

Sounds fine anytime is good.  Basically the parameters that need changing are 
those on the Optimizer sheet:

Start/End Date
Spreads
Max Inj/With rates
Max Storage volume
Selected Curve
Storage Facility

I'm free all week, so let me know when and where if you want to get together.

Hi Matt,
Multiple values for parameters - sounds OK.  I'd add an extra run option to 
the menu bar, and you could set up a list of parameters on a separate tab, 
each line corresponding to a complete run.  How about a meeting tomorrow when 
you could tell me what parameters need to be varied?

Subject: Re: Solver Licence Key  

Tom,

I took a few days off and just got back....

Anyway, I haven't tried it without the key, but if you say it works, then I'm 
sure it does.  One thing I'm realizing, though, is that it's taking me way 
too much time to babysit this thing through multiple runs of the model even 
when it does work.  In order to get the full benefit of your model I want to 
run it a zillion times for many different combinations of parameters.  So, if 
you haven't guessed already, I'm wondering how hard it would be to get this 
thing to zip through some preset combinations of parameters and save the 
results without me tending to it.  I envision a spreadsheet where I list out 
all of the parameter values for each run, and the model picks out the 
parameters, runs through a year's worth of data, and saves the summary sheet, 
then steps to the next set of variables.  In this way I could set it to run a 
bunch of times over night or something so it wouldn't tie up the work day.  
Would this be just a separate macro?  What do you think?

Mat

Hi Mat,
I took away your licence key from the back of your PC yesterday.  The 
problems with our network licence for the solver have gone away - I do not 
really understand what happened.  Try the model aand see if it works OK - 
runs fine on my computer now, whereas it did not run 2 weeks ago.  I suspect 
some sort of network problem, and IT have not been able to figure out any 
more likely cause.

ClickAtHome
program, which will give each employee a computer for use at home. Where=20
technology permits, we will also subsidize an Internet connection. With the=
=20
click of a mouse, a home computer plus Internet access will put a world of=
=20
Internet knowledge at your family=01,s fingertips. =20

We have just signed an agreement with Dell Computer Corporation to provide=
=20
the computer hardware. We wanted to let you know about the program now in=
=20
case you and your family were considering the purchase or upgrade of a home=
=20
computer or Internet connection in the next few months. The scope of=20
ClickAtHome includes the following:

? Basic package: Dell desktop computer with a high-speed processor, floppy=
=20
disk drive, mouse, speakers, monitor, modem, CD-ROM drive and Windows 2000=
=20
software. Employees will have the option to receive a subsidized Internet=
=20
connection, including broadband, where commercially available.
? Participation: This program will be available to active regular full-time=
=20
and regular part-time employees of Enron and its wholly owned subsidiaries;=
=20
however, employees of some Enron companies (Portland General Electric, EOTT=
,=20
Enron Facility Services) may not be able to participate due to legal,=20
accounting, tax, labor or business reasons.  Eligibility includes being=20
employed at the time of implementation. =20
? Timing: U.S. employee sign-up will begin in early 2001, with delivery of=
=20
the equipment and Internet connection to follow shortly thereafter.  Delive=
ry=20
of equipment to participating non-U.S. employees is targeted for late 2001.

Details about this program are still being finalized.  To address some of=

We are excited to extend our investment in technology to you and your=20

Enron is a great place to work.

Chris,

I met with Phillip yesterday, and he had a few more items to add to his list 
of objectives for me.  For your information, the attached table provides the 
additional items.  Please let me know if you have any questions/comments.  
Also, the following e-mail from Mike Grigsby relates to the Socal sendout 
model objective.  Also for your information, I will be running Randy Gay's 
EOL product (Keystone Cash) next week and will be covering for Tori K during 
her maternity leave.  I don't expect these activities to interfere with my 
fundy responsibilities. 

Mat

Let's have Matt start on the following:

Database for hourly storage activity on Socal.  Begin forecasting hourly and 
daily activity by backing out receipts, using ISO load actuals and backing 
out real time imports to get in state gen numbers for gas consumption, and 
then using temps to estimate core gas load.  Back testing once he gets 
database created should help him forecast core demand.

Update Socal and PG&E forecast sheets.  Also, break out new gen by EPNG and 
TW pipelines.

Mike

Hey Anna,

Sorry, I took awhile getting back to you....I took the week off...

Ya, we tried meeting up, but I guess you guys must have left before we got
there.  Our dinner at Sambuca's took quite awhile, I think we made it to
Deans around 12:30 or so.  We checked there and the Hub, but no luck.  Hope
you guys had a good time, and I'm always up for another night out.

The happy hour tonight is at the Timbewolf near Bissonnet and Kirby.  It says 
6 pm, but whatever.  I'll probably go then.  If you guys aren't ready, maybe 
I'll go and check it out before you guys make the trip.

Yan,

Based on my review conducted the morning of February 6th, here is a list of 
items that need to be addressed in the next version of the West Desk's Flow 
Summary sheet:

PGT - These numbers appear to be one day off.  The numbers in the Test Sheet 
for February 6th are identical to those used by the West Desk yesterday for 
February 5th.  I verified that they are the Cycle 2 numbers posted on PGT's 
website for the 5th.  Generally, we use the Cycle 2 numbers, however, 
sometimes only Cycle one is available for our morning meeting.

Northwest - None of these numbers match our flow sheet.  It appears the Test 
Sheet pulls Cycle 3 nominations, whereas we use Cycle 6.  However, the 
website we use to pull the flows is generally not available to use until as 
late as 7 am (we are not sure why).  I understand you may pull the numbers 
from a different place, so we should find out whether you can get the numbers 
earlier.

TW - TW numbers appear to be correct, except for the IB Link number.  We pull 
the IB link number from the El Paso Blanco I/C point reported by TW.  It 
looks like your sheet pulls the number from the El Paso INWPLBLA point.  They 
differ by about 5,000, but I don't know if one is more correct than the 
other.  To be consistent, though, we should probably change the Test Sheet.

PGE - The numbers also appear to be one day off.  The numbers for February 
6th are identical to our Feb. 5th numbers.  Is this a reporting or a 
scrubbing problem?  It is possible you are pulling the data from the website 
before they update it with the next day's data.  We manually type these 
numbers in.  If you pull from our spreadsheet, then the latest numbers would 
not be in when this report is run.

El Paso - Most of the numbers appear to be correct, except for the plant 
receipts.  The numbers are close, but we should compare our formulas because 
I don't think this is a cycle problem.

General - The "Difference" column of the Test Sheet compares the latest cycle 
for the current with the final cycle of the previous day.  This can cause 
intraday fluxuations in scheduled quantities to appear as day to day 
fluxuations.  Any "Difference" column should compare identical cycles.  I 
suggest that we add additional cycles to the Test Sheet for the current day 
and the previous day.  This way we can compare identical cycles as well as 
pick up any intraday fluxuations.

As we discussed, you'll let me know when you're ready to revise this report.  
These notes should give us a great place to start.  I look forward to getting 
this report ready to use.

Mat

As a matter of fact, mark your damn calender......March 8-11....I'm in town 
and will hopefully be attending the Big Championship game Sat.. night, 
otherwise just partying.  Again, you name the time and place, and whoever 
else might be interested in "getting it done".  How's the residency going?  
Enron kicks ass, but I feel like it's going to take me forever to get where I 
need to be, and you won't believe where that is, but more on that later.  Go 
Syracuse.

off and Phillip is out this week, so I don't have much to do.  I'm pretty 
much done scheduling and I start next week in Gaskill's group.  

Anyway, you were going to send me the names of those guys in London we talked 
to about the synthetic storage, and if you did, I lost them.  Regardless, any 
chance of digging them up for me?  I may want to talk to them about their bid 
process.  I think Phillip is ok with going ahead with the idea, but I think I 
need to keep the ball rolling here with or without him.

Mat

Phillip,

I'm building a sheet for each person specifically for financial hedging.  
Each day it will pull in the previous days position and previous day price 
curve to calculate the mark to market.  Then that day's transactions can be 
entered to calculate the P & L of transactions which close out previous 
positions, as well as to calculate the new open positions.  Initially, I 
thought that daily P&L could be calculated by simply adjusting the P&L 
whenever a transaction was made by the difference between the bid/offer of 
the closed out position by the offer/bid of the new position (of course time 
value and storage costs would be included).  However, this only works if the 
person is 100% hedged, meaning they do not have any open positions which 
require marking.  As the seller of synthetic storage utilizing 100% hedging, 
I should be able to do this, except for the fact that I will have size limits 
on transactions that will probably leave me open here and there.  

The main question I have is simply, "Should I be calculating the P&L for each 
person's storage book for open and closed positions?"  Then beyond that, if 
we do calculate the P&L's from the buyer side, it seems that if their storage 
is not hedged, I will have to develop the market value of the storage in the 
ground and the remaining capacity to mark to market it.  So, I guess I could 
apply the model for that purpose.  Does this make sense to you?  Any comments 
are appreciated.  Thanks.

Mat

Scully, all to have this piece of shit freeze up....so I think perhaps I
will just try to get some time to call you tonight!!!!

You should now have checks from myself, Duncan and Bill.  Sharon said she

Hey Anna,

Sorry, I took awhile getting back to you....I took the week off...

Ya, we tried meeting up, but I guess you guys must have left before we got
there.  Our dinner at Sambuca's took quite awhile, I think we made it to
Deans around 12:30 or so.  We checked there and the Hub, but no luck.  Hope
you guys had a good time, and I'm always up for another night out.

Mike,

Sorry I missed you guys Friday night.  I made back from a golf outing around 
9 pm, but you guys must have already left the Front Porch.  Anyway,  I was 
out the other night and met some Dynegy talent that were interested in an 
Enron Analyst/Associate and Dynegy Pace Program happy hour.  What do you 
think about the prospectsof a combined happy hour.  They have a group that 
goes out on the third Thursday of every month, which would be this Thursday.

Jeanie,
 
I have a friend who is interested in an HR position with Enron.  She spoke of 
a rotational program for HR that I am not familiar with.  Do you know 
anything about the program, or who I might forward her resume to for an HR 
related position in general.  She has a few years of experience with a 
smaller firm, and I think she's looking for a company with a more established 
HR department like Enron.  Also, do you have knowledge of specific positions 
we are trying to fill in ENA?  Any info would be helpful.  Thanks.

Brad,

What's up cuz?  Are the lights on in San Francisco?  I think it's only a 
matter of time before the national guard comes in to prevent rioting in the 
streets!

Anyway, I was just wondering what plans you have in the next month or so 
because I want to go someplace and do something, but I'm just not sure what 
yet.  I have a bunch of vacation I need to take and I'd rather not sit around 
here and twidle my thumbs.  Let me know if you have any suggestions.

Kristen,

I thought Mark had called you, but I guess not.  He said that he can't have 
Wendy and Amy change their plans, so he can't go on the ski trip.  It was 
pathetic....I heard, "so, are you guys still planning on coming that 
weekend?...well good...."  He proceeded to talk for at least two hours on the 
phone, and just mentioned the outcome yesterday.  I pushed him to give me 
details, but all he said was the cost was a major factor and that Wendy had 
time off.  I think he was bullshiting and that he never really asked them 
(I'm such a skeptic).  Anyway, fuck'm.  Any ideas?

Mat

Hey cutie, I just spent forever writing you a nice little reply to your
email on the ski trip, my email availibility, phone b.s, your NYC trip and
Scully, all to have this piece of shit freeze up....so I think perhaps I
will just try to get some time to call you tonight!!!!
love, k

You should now have checks from myself, Duncan and Bill.  Sharon said she
would get back to me today, but I think we should jump on this lodge asap.

Jeanie,

As you may already know, I'm scheduling on the West Gas Desk....Socal, El 
Paso, TW, Williams, etc.  Do you need any more info?  Do you have any more 
info on how this program is going to be structured?  If so, I'd be 
interested.  

See you around,

Mat

David,

Here's the information for the Portland database:

Machine name:  napdx-sql1
user id:  gasintranet
password:  fundamentals

The Access database I created is located at:  O:\\fundy_ops\west 
desk\generation database\power_link_database.mdb

The qry_curtailments is the query i'm currently using (although it only has 
fields for today and yesterday, and i think i need more).  The tables for the 
query are dbo_LkpOUT_PlantCharacteristics and dbo_LkpOUT_PlantOutage.

In general, I think I need two tables.  One needs to show each plant and the 
other needs to summarize the outages by region and fuel type (both in the 
Plant table).  I don't really have a query that prepares the data for the 
summary table.  the other two queries in the Access database are a start.  
The attached Excel file has two sheets with what I would ideally like the 
report to look like.  It might be good to group the first table by region and 
then fuel type as well.  When you have a chance to look this stuff over, I'd 
be happy to discuss it further.  Thanks.

Mat

waking up with a toilet by my head was a wonderful feeling!

and, boy did i feel great the next day.  Get this....I get on my little rinky 
dink plane to Philadelphia, and as i walk passed the flight attendant, i hear 
this voice................."mat?".   I turn and the flight attendant is none 
other than.........Heather Chapin!  Although she offered me all the booz i 
could drink, i could drink none.  i would have eaten some food if offered, 
but judging by the double-chin she has developed, i'm guessing she ate it all.

Anyway, from what i remember, i had a great time, although a little 
dissappointed at the Syracuse'esk finish of the rest of the Brother Jimmy's 
team.  I'll be thinking about you guys this weekend when i'm outside drinking 
my green beer.

About the trips...i don't know anything yet, except that Jazzfest is looking 
bad since no one can seem to find a hotel with availability.

Later,
Mateo

Imad,

I don't think we have any open slots, but pass your resume on to me and I 
will pass it on.  When would your rotation begin and would this be a second 
or third rotation?

We have an Analyst/Associate program for HR.  If she has an MBA or graduate 
degree we would consider her for the assoc. program.  Otherwise, she might 
fit in the analyst program.  Forward her resume to me and I will pass it 
along.  She can contact Karen Buckley at 713 345 4667 after you give me the 
resume.  Karen is the lead recruiter/program manager.  Let me know if you 
need more info.

Jeanie,
 
I have a friend who is interested in an HR position with Enron.  She spoke of 
a rotational program for HR that I am not familiar with.  Do you know 
anything about the program, or who I might forward her resume to for an HR 
related position in general.  She has a few years of experience with a 
smaller firm, and I think she's looking for a company with a more established 
HR department like Enron.  Also, do you have knowledge of specific positions 
we are trying to fill in ENA?  Any info would be helpful.  Thanks.

Mat

Yo, sorry I haven't gotten back to you right away.  I am still trying to 
figure when and where I'm taking vacation.   Puerto Rico is right up there, 
buddy, so what's the latest on the whole contract extension?  I checked some 
airfares a couple of weeks ago and, WOW, it was a bit high, which is why I 
didn't jump right on this.  I'll do some checking tonight, and I'll let you 
know what I come up with.  Ideally, mid to end of February is best, but of 
course, that all depends on if you're still going to be there. Anyway,  I 
just wanted to let you know, I'm still considering.

Hey cutie

It's all good.  I e-mailed Sharon and Bill and gave Duncan the skinny.  Bill
is in and he, Duncan and I are sending you the $308 asap.   I did not yet
hear back from Sharon but I have to assume she is in.  Also, Sandra
Lewis(GK's Sandra)  said she may be into the trip, just waiting to hear back
on that.

While everyone seemed to feel the 22nd-25th sounded fine they all expressed
interest in mid-march as well.  Did you find out when it might be availible
then???  I'll call you today for a final chat!
love, k

Team,

The attached spreadsheet identifies the manual entry points for each 
pipeline.  Please send me additional points for your respective pipelines and 
highlight in green.  Make particular note of any information that will be 
tracked on a schedule other than the standard cycle schedule of the relative 
pipeline.  The blue highlighted meters already exist in the database.  Where 
appropriate add the IHS DRN.  If it does not exist, leave blank and the IT 
group will create an ID using the description provided.  Please let me know 
if you cannot get this done by the end of the day, since I'd like Hyde to 
incorporate these first thing tomorrow.  Call me if you have any questions.   

Mat

Ok Chris.  this is it.  Three tabs each with NEW meters to add to the 
database with unique identifiers.  The third tab has four points that need 
IHS numbers assigned.  These four should be assigned to the Questar 
pipeline.  Thanks.

Amanda,

Yes, it appears that the link you set up works properly, however, I have a 
slight change.  Please modify the title to read "WSCC Plant Outages 
(portlant)".  Also add the WSCC to the description.  In addition, please add 
an additional link under the Power tab called, "Cal Plant Outages (Cal ISO)", 
with a description of "Daily plant outages posted on the web by the 
California ISO."  The file will be called "ISO curtailments.xls".  Thanks.

I agree.  Everything is just peachy up here.  My scheduling group wants me to 
stay in this rotation for another month, and I think Philip has ok'ed it.  He 
also thinks that for my next rotation, he'll just switch me with an analyst 
in the risk group that works on our books, soooooooooo....I'm curious how 
this "track" will actually affect me.  

Happy hour tomorrow?

Reagan,

Charles just got a phone call for you!  Apparently, his phone number is 
listed in the directory for you.  Since I didn't remember your number, we 
told the guy we'd pass on his name and number.  His name is Ted Spackey with 
Annachem 1-800-966-1186.  

Oh, by the way, I ended up going to the Volcano last night til 12:30 and had 
a great time.  Those frozen screwdrivers will fuck you up.  I get half way in 
the door and one of the traders in my group comes running up to say.  I hung 
out with her and this other guy who's one of our brokers.  Random.  The 
broker was great to talk to because he had great things to say about Enron, 
and he wasn't kissing ass for the business because his last day is today and 
he's moving back East.  Anyway, I'm exhausted.  No partying for me tonight.

Steve,

I'm real flexible on timing, but this whole - you may not be there thing - 
definitely restricts the possibilities.  What are the chances of a follow-on 
tour?  Won't the contract be renewed?  If your tour was indeed over, would 
how long would you be there both with and without a contract extension?  
Which weekend do you intend to be around and wish to have company.  The later 
the better for me, but seriously, I could probably get on plane next weekend 
if that was the only opportunity.  I'll give a call sometime, but I don't 
think I have the number anywhere.  Can you send it to me?  FYI, my numbers 
are as follows:  w 713-853-0472, h 713-784-8180, m 832-444-7702. 

Later dude.

Hey bruddah:

Great to hear from you!!!  So hey, you are ALWAYS welcome stay at my house
(as long as you don't water down my liquor bottles...).  The only glitch is
that my tenure in PR may be coming to a close.  At this point, our contract
is over on January 30th and it's unclear what will happen after that.  When
are you thinking of coming?  It sounds like your new job is cool.  The
diving is AWESOME!!!

Steve,

Hey, what's up my friend?  I hear that business is well in Puerto Rico
(although that was quite awhile ago so who knows).  I'm assuming that you
are, indeed, still there.  I can't believe that I've just finished my fifth
month with Enron.  It's been great, though.  Everything is new so I'm
learning a ton.  Working on a trading floor is quite a different
environment than Pirnie.  My desk is so small it reminds of Puerto Rico,
although there are no bomb threats, the bell does not sound at lunch,  and
the number of holidays does not exceed the number of work days in the year.
I've recently been accepted into a subprogram of the program I'm in to
become a trader, so my next year is pretty much planned and eventually I'll
start trading.

Anyway... I was just thinking the other day that I miss my trips to the
island (especially my accomodations at the Excelsior), and I can't help
feeling a little shorted that I didn't get a follow-up event of the Reggae
tour or diving trip.  So I was wondering if maybe I should come down some
weekend and make it right., you know put all of the planets back in
alignment.  So I was wondering if you might be able to put me up for a
weekend and maybe do some diving or something.  If not, then no big deal,
there's about zillion places I'd like to visit in the next few months.
Just drop me a note sometime and let me know what you think.

Please say hello to Pat, Joanne and Juan Carlos for me.  By the way, it was
bittersweet to hear Barry left soon after I did.  Had he done so sooner, I
would have taken his spot!  Anyway, wish everyone well and I'm curious to
hear what's happening on the island these days.

Take care,

Mat

I think they met all of the candidates and decided to scrap the whole 
program.  Either that or Ted's buying time to go out and find more 
candidates.   It's very dissappointing that we have heard absolutely nothing 
thus far.  I'm too chickenshit to ask Phillip.  Early today three of the six 
people I interviewed with were in my area talking...its sucks just knowing 
that they know and aren't offering any info.

So, any more info regarding the chicks...or I mean ski trip?  As in, what 
people think of the digs, when people are wanting to go.  My update is that 
the best weekend for me is the first weekend in March.  As lucky as I am, 
it's probably the worst one for everyone.  Hey, do you think you could send 
me emails of all of those going.  I think we should start copying the whole 
group on correspondance.

I should be good for a place to say, but I certainly appreciate the offer.  
I'm definitely still coming, though.  Soooooooooooooooooooooooooooo, tell me 
when you're free, and we'll hang out.  You and Jess up for dinner?  Right 
now, saturday night is the only night I have plans (basketball game).  I'll 
be going out afterwards, though.  Just let me know.

Later.

you have a good weekend?  Hand out with Marky much?  I noticed some of my

Regan,

Hey, I hope things are still going well.  I've been thrown right into the mix 
right away and have barely had a minute to breathe.  I'm scheduling gas after 
the morning trades have been made which basically entails lining up the 
buyers and sellers to exchange contract numbers.  However, it's a great place 
to learn operational logistics.  The intent is that I'll be productive in the 
role immediately while learning the ropes.  As they hire the needed full-time 
schedulers and I get up to speed, I'll move into market research for the 
traders.  My first such assignment is to value storage in different markets 
based on historical gas pricing and injection-withdrawel strategies.  Let's 
just say my plate looks to be full.

By the way, I'm sure you saw the previous email from our buddy, Ted Bland.  
Looks like he got the message, although I'm still feeling like there's still 
some orientation regarding the A/A program itself that we're missing.  For 
instance, did you see that there's a whole page in the intranet dedicated to 
the program.  It mentions month guest speakers and lunches.  I also saw 
mention of a mentoring program.  Of course, the A/A happy hours important as 
well.  I'd like to know more. 

Anyway, the real reason I wanted to drop the line is to find out if you're 
spending all your time in Georgia, or if you want to grab lunch sometime this 
week or hear of any after work activities that would help in meeting other 
people at Enron.  You can reach me at 3-0472.  

Later,

Mat

Chris,

This spread sheet contains the new WIC meters, as discussed.  I also 
discovered that there are about 200 meters we current get manually for CIG 
that also need to be added to the database.  They are included in the 
attached file on separate sheets.  Meters already existing in the database 
are not included for either pipe.  Can you please dump these into the 
database and set up additional sheets in the Socal manual entry spreadsheet 
for these meters.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Well it's good to hear from you.  I'm glad the skiing was good.  I'm jealous, 
although I'm going to NY this weekend, and I'm trying to set up a day of 
skiing!  

I haven't reserved the place yet, but as of yesterday it was still 
available.  I was suprised to get mail from Duncan yesterday...then I 
realized it was a check...cool.  So, when do you think the rest will be on 
the way.  Once I know, I'll go ahead and get the place.  Give me a call, 
though.  I'll try you today if I don't hear from you first.  I'm leaving for 
NY tomorrow morning, but I'll have my phone all weekend.

Stay cool.

Mateo.

Hmmm, I don't if I could pass up an opportunity to dive the Caymen islands.  
Timing wise the end of February still works best, but if you're still working 
then it wouldn't be nearly as cool as if it were March and you weren't 
working, so I'm willing to hold out until you know your fate.  Definitely 
keep me informed, though.  I'll just plan a ski trip in the mean time to hold 
me over.  Say hi to the crew for me...and of course, Jewels.

The ones to Hobby are American, and the others are Continental.  On American, 
the one's I sent are the about the only ones.  Continental has many available

Leo,

Well, actually that is how I spell my name as well...but not Enron - one of 
the drawbacks to working for a large company.  Your analysis of the database 
structure and its intent is correct.  The extra table enables the use of a 
many-to-many relationship between regulatory items and facilities.  Joanne 
and I previously discussed the need to "keep track" of all facilities 
referenced in a particular order.  This relationship allows users to query 
facility and review data related to an order.  For instance, if an order 
required the upgrade of chlorination facilities at several plants, one could 
develop a query and report that produced the results of all equipment 
inspections for the related facilities.  This would not be possible (or at 
least not achieved as easily) without the many to many relationship.  So yes, 
you are giving up functionality, so I would only consider eliminating the 
table if it would causing undo problems with the database.  As far as 
actually modifying the database, there would be some manual labor required 
for those orders with multiple facilities already assigned.  

I have to go, but if you or Joanne need to discuss it over the phone, I'd be 
happy to with a little notice.  

Mat

No skiing yet.  Unfortunately, my trips are in limbo.  I'm pretty sure I'm 
going to South Padre island in two weeks, but the skiing might wait until 
March, except that I'm going to NY for the Big East Championship Game and my 
brother's coming down here for a week to hang out.  Oh well, I need the 
vacations...

No word yet-
Raul and John Batten are here today trying to sell our services to the new
administration - so we should hopefully know soon...  Did you go skiing?

Smith,
    Do you have any interest in this concert?   Matchbox Twenty, Life House,
and some other band....  I have a ticket and I don't know if I am going, but
if you want to go I can see if she has an extra ticket or you can have mine.
Let me know!

Just so you know, I should be home around six or so.  Definitely going to bed 
early, though, and the Street is on from 8-9.

Marlo,

As discussed, I am forwarding to you two spreadsheets with the requested 
information.  Each spreadsheets are identified by month.  Within each 
spreadsheet are a number of tabs.  Based on the customers you mentioned on 
the phone, I believe you need only to use the "OCCMarkets" tab.  Customers 
are along the horizontal with dates on the vertical.  For each customer, 
several columns are used to identify the gas supplied to the customer from 
each location.  Please call if you have any further questions.

Mat

Hey Anna,

Sorry, I took awhile getting back to you....I took the week off...

Ya, we tried meeting up, but I guess you guys must have left before we got 
there.  Our dinner at Sambuca's took quite awhile, I think we made it to 
Deans around 12:30 or so.  We checked there and the Hub, but no luck.  Hope 
you guys had a good time, and I'm always up for another night out.

Matt- I don't know if you remember me, but we met at Jennifer's party at the
Black Lab.  Thought we were meeting up with y'all last Sat, night, but I
guess we missed each other.  Maybe we can try it again sometime soon.  Hope
you had a fun night without us :)

Hello!  OK, for those of you who can make it (and I hope it will be all of
you), we are going to dinner at El Tiempo downtown (713-221-1695 @ Main &
Prairie) at 7:30 PM.  So, if you can make it to dinner, please come at 7:30
and we will reserve a big table.  If you can't make it to dinner, come to
El Tiempo for a margarita and then we will head over to Dean's after that.
Hope to see you all there!  And please feel free to invite others!  JB

If you need to reach me, my cell phone # is 713-417-8613.

Seeing as how its 6:13 pm central time and I didn't know you sent the email 
until I "manually" checked before packing up to go home, I'd say not.  How 
about that Instant Messenger, though.  Just think, you'd be able to send me a 
message and I instantly read it.  Almost better than email at Malcolm Pirnie.

Steve,

Yo, what's up?  I'm just sitting at work getting the weather updates from the 
meteorologists...................

Anyway, I was just wondering what the latest is on the the Pirnie/AFI saga.  
Are you out of a job yet?  I'm feeling the need to get the hell out of here 
and take a vacation.  Still thinking of your neck of the woods.  Got to run.

Tracy,

I believe I neglected to RSVP to you regarding the Associate orientation 
beginning February 12th.  If possible I would like to attend a portion of the 
activities.  Since I have been with Enron for five months, I do not think I 
should attend the entire program, but I believe the Derivatives, Modeling and 
Risk sessions would be of value to me.  Please let me know if I can still 
attend these sessions.  Thank you.

Mathew Smith

This is strictly for testing...provided it goes well, we will activate 
security and create a link in the tree for this (as well as move it up to 
production).

Hey, I hope you've gotton a chance to get a phone any everything.  I finally 
have access to all the computer applications that I need.  If only I had 
access to the directories with the required files!  

Anyway, I wondering what you thought about drinks after work thursday and if 
you had any venue preference?

Thanks.  I'll get her resume to you tomorrow.  She doesn't have a graduate 
degree, yet she probably has more experience than a typical analyst.

We have an Analyst/Associate program for HR.  If she has an MBA or graduate 
degree we would consider her for the assoc. program.  Otherwise, she might 
fit in the analyst program.  Forward her resume to me and I will pass it 
along.  She can contact Karen Buckley at 713 345 4667 after you give me the 
resume.  Karen is the lead recruiter/program manager.  Let me know if you 
need more info.

Jeanie,
 
I have a friend who is interested in an HR position with Enron.  She spoke of 
a rotational program for HR that I am not familiar with.  Do you know 
anything about the program, or who I might forward her resume to for an HR 
related position in general.  She has a few years of experience with a 
smaller firm, and I think she's looking for a company with a more established 
HR department like Enron.  Also, do you have knowledge of specific positions 
we are trying to fill in ENA?  Any info would be helpful.  Thanks.

Mat

Well March probably isn't great for me anyway...going to NYC 8-11, and my 
brother's coming for a week.  So, I guess just keep me posted.  I took a week 
off and went to South Padre island so it took the edge off my need to get 
away, but certainly did not completely satsify.  Still looking for more.

Talk to you later.

Dude

sorry for the long response period - howz it???

So the saga continues - we have no contract extension - in fact - today in
March 1 and our contract ended yesterday - it is anticipated that we will
get an extension through March - but it hasn't happened yet - aye bendito!!!

In a way I hope the whole thing just blows up so I can go hang in the
Caymans for a while - how sweet would that be???

anyway, March is not looking that good - going to CA on the 17,18 - got a
chickie visiting 24/25 - and going to NY for the Pirnie technical symposium
on the 3/31 and 4/1...  how did life get so freekin' hectic.

I'll keep you posted

Steve,

Yo, what's up?  I'm just sitting at work getting the weather updates from
the meteorologists...................

Anyway, I was just wondering what the latest is on the the Pirnie/AFI saga.
Are you out of a job yet?  I'm feeling the need to get the hell out of here
and take a vacation.  Still thinking of your neck of the woods.  Got to
run.

OH MY GOD, THIS IS WAY TOO FUCKING 
WEIRD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I sent you the message below earlier today and had two emails waiting for me 
this afternoon.  One indicating that I sent it to the wrong address and your 
email.  I can't believe it!  The worst part about it is that, yes, I am 
planning a trip to NYC, and I'm going to be there this weekend, which was the 
point of my email this morning!  HOLY SHIT!  THAT SUCKS!  I can't believe 
you're not going to be there.  When are you leaving/coming back?  I try to 
call you, but I don't know if I still have you're numbers (I've been useless 
since my Palm Pilot crashed).  Anyway, again, this is freaky.

Hey Jennifer, I actually have a couple friends in town this weekend as well, 
and we'll definitely be looking for some of Houston's finest entertainment 
(and although the strip clubs are rated highly here, that's not what I'm 
referring to).  I'd definitely be interested going out Sat., but I don't have 
any suggestions as of yet.  I'll see what I can come up with.

Steve,

Hey, what's up my friend?  I hear that business is well in Puerto Rico 
(although that was quite awhile ago so who knows).  I'm assuming that you 
are, indeed, still there.  I can't believe that I've just finished my fifth 
month with Enron.  It's been great, though.  Everything is new so I'm 
learning a ton.  Working on a trading floor is quite a different environment 
than Pirnie.  My desk is so small it reminds of Puerto Rico, although there 
are no bomb threats, the bell does not sound at lunch,  and the number of 
holidays does not exceed the number of work days in the year.  I've recently 
been accepted into a subprogram of the program I'm in to become a trader, so 
my next year is pretty much planned and eventually I'll start trading.

Anyway... I was just thinking the other day that I miss my trips to the 
island (especially my accomodations at the Excelsior), and I can't help 
feeling a little shorted that I didn't get a follow-up event of the Reggae 
tour or diving trip.  So I was wondering if maybe I should come down some 
weekend and make it right., you know put all of the planets back in 
alignment.  So I was wondering if you might be able to put me up for a 
weekend and maybe do some diving or something.  If not, then no big deal, 
there's about zillion places I'd like to visit in the next few months.  Just 
drop me a note sometime and let me know what you think.

Please say hello to Pat, Joanne and Juan Carlos for me.  By the way, it was 
bittersweet to hear Barry left soon after I did.  Had he done so sooner, I 
would have taken his spot!  Anyway, wish everyone well and I'm curious to 
hear what's happening on the island these days.  

Take care,

Mat
