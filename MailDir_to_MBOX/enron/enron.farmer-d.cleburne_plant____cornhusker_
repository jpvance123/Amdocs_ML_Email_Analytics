As you may know, the Generation Investments Group is in discussions with El Paso on the sale of upstream equity interests in the Cleburne, TX generating facility.  As part of El Paso's diligence, they've asked to meet with our experts in tax, insurance and gas management matters pertaining to the facility on Thursday, June 21 or Friday, June 22.  We intend to schedule three separate meetings in either the Enron Building or 3AC.  Please let me know what your availability is for a meeting on your area of expertise on either of those two days.  

Thanks.

Are you going to make the price changes to the Tenaska IV sale 384258 for 
10/00 and 11/00 that James details below?  Right now, we are showing a short 
pay of $351,201.49 for those two months.

Subject: Tenaska IV Gas

Daren, per review of the Gas agreements between Tenaska IV and 
Williams/Apache and our understanding of the Agency agreement, I had a few 
items I  wanted to discuss with you (in lieu of our meeting today that was 
cancelled):

1. Looking at the October gas supply to the plant, I think Tenaska IV should 
have been charged at the contract prices with Williams & Apache (i.e.  2.285) 
and not at what the final price that was actualized per Megan's summary - 
230,406 at $710,616.70, price of $3.084.  If this volume was charged  at 
2.285 the total would have been $526,477.71, a difference of $184,138.99.

2. Looking at the November gas supply to the plant, Tenaska IV was charged 
$2.91 per MMbtu, instead of $2.285 for volumes of 267,300.  At the $2.91  
price, the total settlement price was $777,843 instead of $610,780.50 at 
2.285, showing a difference of $167,062.50.

I reviewed the gas supply agreements and the Williams gas price (pg. 19) for 
2000 gas is 2.32, which can be adjusted by the Waha Transportation Adjustment 
if delivered at Waha.  This adjustment started in 1997 at $.03 per MMbtu and 
increase by 5% per year.  Thereby currently, the adjustment factor is at 
.0347, giving us a price of $2.2853 per MMbtu.

In reviewing the Apache gas agreement (pg. 22), I noticed that the gas price 
is 2.285 at Waha & 2.315 at Katy/Carthage for 2000.  Per review of the Apache 
invoices, it appears that we are not getting our gas at these points but at 
other places (i.e. Lomak-Sterling & Mendell CDP) at a price of $2.175.  If 
Enron has a separate agreement at these delivery points and can capture a 
margin difference then that is upside to Enron.  However, I think the plant 
should not be charged above the contract price of $2.285.

Looking at the daily gas that was scheduled to the plant for November and 
October, I did not see that their use went over the contracted volumes from 
Williams and Apache of 45,000 MMbtu per day.  Therefore I don't think spot 
prices are part of the equation here.  Additionally, I recall from our 
meeting last month that all Enron makes on this deal is the Agency Fee of 
$.04 per MMbtu (excluding the margin difference that Enron has on Apache gas 
delivery points if my scenario above is correct).

So based upon items 1 & 2 above, I am suggesting that Tenaska IV adjust their 
November invoice owed to Enron for gas used by the plant by the gas price 
differences showed above.  Therefore, I am planning to wire a payment of 
$484,234.03 (see breakout below) on Friday, 12/22, to Enron on behalf of 
Tenaska IV Texas Partners, Ltd. for this activity.

  Month   Plant Gas Price Amount
  November  267,300  2.91 $777,843 
  November adjustment    $(167,062.50)   
  October adjustment    $(184,138.99)
  Nov. Agency Fee 1,350,000 .04 $54,000
  Sept. Agency Fee 98,813  .04 $3,592.52
       Total $484,234.03

I discussed these issues with Mike Mazowita, Rick Hill & Jody Pierce before 
reaching this conclusion.  Should you have any different ideas or thoughts 
that I am not covering, please call me at 3-7280 and we can discuss.  Thanks.

James

Please change the demand fee on deal 384258 for April from $2,862,531.95 to $2,855,089.73.  We need to return some money to Tenaska IV.  The transport expenses are less than what was etimated on the spreadsheet.

Thanks for following up on this.

I think we're generally there in terms of the commercial terms, but need to 
think through just a few issues related to our plans for the asset.

I'd suggest we meet on Thursday as I believe the asset manager (Mike 
Mazowita) will be here in Houston.  In addition to John's list of attendees, 
Chuck Ward, John King and I should be in the meeting.  I'll ask Tina Tennant 
to corrdinate.

Rick,
Just following up my voicemail to you yesterday ---John Griffith has 
contacted me regarding the gas management agreement relating to the 
Cornhusker transaction. When Dan was in my office several weeks ago, we spoke 
with you and it appeared that some of the financial terms of the gas 
management agreement were yet to be worked out--has that occurred yet? Do you 
know the details of the extension on the transition agreement? Are you 
available to meet on this in the next day or two and is there anyone else you 
think should be included? (John Griffith has asked to be included and 
suggests Darren Farmer and Bob Hall be present as well)--Please let me know

Thank you,
Sandi

Tenaska IV has been operating without a "gas agency agreement" since that 
portion of the Transition Agreement expired on August 31.  We met with Sandy 
and the Texas gas desk on September 28 to firm up commercial terms (which I 
think we generally accomplished for all matters other than the price that 
would be charged by the desk).  Should we be concerned with the amount of 
time this is taking?  That is, is there any risk we face (bank-wise or 
otherwise) during the period of time before this agreement is inked and taken 
through the bank consent process?

Daren----

The invoices are being paid by us now....James Armstrong is taking care of 
them, so that is who I am forwarding them to.  He apparently is paying for 
them of an account set up for this.  He is out of the office, but he called 
me back and said to keep forwarding him the invoices.

Let me know if we have any questions,

Thanks,
Mark

Please change the demand fee on deal 384258 for June 2001 from $3,578,257.50 to $3,559,472.93.  Our transport expenses went down.  We are having some volume problems with this month, so we may need to change it again.  I'm trying to keep Kyle Lilly and Jim Pond happy on the GL side.

Gentlemen,

I wanted to clarify the length of the outage that started today at the 
Cleburne site. 

The earliest the plant will be on-line is Wednesday morning. If anything is 
found beyond a cracked transition piece or clogged fuel nozzle then it may 
extend the outage a few days. As soon as I hear something I will let you know.

We need to forward the money from the Feb 2001 Brazos sale to Tenaska IV.  I 
am assuming you want to handle this as before by entering a purchase demand 
fee on deal 529856 in the amount of $1,143,484.53.  There is already a demand 
fee for Feb 2001 for $29,851.64, so I think we just need to change that to 
the new amount.  Let me know if you want to handle this differently.

Please note that the Cleburne plant is expected to come back up on Sat. 
morning the 7th of October.  I have already submitted the nominations to 
Lonestar for the weekend (7th-9th), taking all gas to the plant.  If they 
come up early, we have imbalance gas that will serve them.   I have informed 
Mary of this, and will give her a copy of the noms, #'s and contacts, etc....


Thanks,
Mark

We are finally beginning to put closure on our outage. It has been

early Saturday morning startup barring any unseen problems.

We've talked this over at this end and agree we should be taking the following approach:

Remind Brazos that under Exhibit 7.12, page 2 of the PPA, Brazos is precluded on any gas day from taking a greater volume of gas than the plant's MDQ (45,000 Dth/d) less the amount needed to satisfy its generation request.

The partnership will accept total gas nominations as generation first, gas for resale second.  If Brazos' electric nominations by hour would, given ambient conditions, cause us to use at or above the plant's MDQ under its contracts with Apache/Williams (45,000 Dth/d), gas nominations will be zero.  This needs to be handled between the operators.  I've emphasized "at or above" on purpose; if an all electric nomination would cause Brazos to burn in excess of 45,000 Dth per day, we will honor that request (we're looking at this with the attorneys and may choose at a future date to change the way this has been administered in the past, as this situation currently causes the partnership to incur an economic loss).  

After being notified of the need for a schedule adjustment, Brazos is free to reset its hourly electric nominations to allow for gas deliveries to the extent it desires (provided they're still capped at 45,000 Dth/d if they take gas).  Whenever they go this route, however, we need to hold them to the electric nomination (i.e., they should get a courtesy call from an operator each and every time they go over the nominated electricity amount).  Remind Brazos that under the PPA, they will be billed for penalties associated with not adhering to their electric nominations on days on which they've elected to take gas.

If the issue of precedent comes up, remind them that we're operating in a new territory and that electric-gas nominations have only been made over the past 7 months; it wasn't until recently that we've been able to attribute imbalance penalties to Brazos, which has caused us to look at the scheduling provisions of the agreement much more closely.

As a show of good faith, we should also make an attempt to track gas consumed/nominated for redelivery and advise them toward the end of the month of opportunities to up their gas nominations.

Hope this helps to clarify where we are.

RH

Chuck,
I just wanted to make sure everyone has the same undertstanding of the gas
nominations and usage issue. Today with this most recent daily nomination
revision from Brazos, Brazos(WACO) now understands that we are going to hold
them to 45,000 Mbtu's when they are requesting electrical generation and gas
energy. However, I want everone of us to understand that a nomination from
Brazos for a 6312 MWH,s(263/hr),will require the plant to utilize 47,500 to
48,500 Mbtu's at this ambient temperature to deliver the requested energy.
To allow Brazos any gas the total delivered electrical energy would have to
be something less than 258MW loading per hour.
Regards, Ken

We need to change the demand fees for Tenaska IV based on actuals for Jan 
2001.   Tenaska owes us some additional money.  I have attached my netting 
spreadsheet if you need it.

Deal 514353  Change MMBtu from 45,000 to 46,113
Deal 384258  Change amount from $3,934,644.50 to $3,841,888.11



I got your message regarding Apache.  I will just leave the pay the lesser 
ofs there until they come back for it.   Also, Mark checked with TXU and we 
do not have the rights to get dailies for the Tenaska meters.  He said that 
only the interconnecting pipes get dailies.  For the spreadsheet, I am just 
going to prorate the actuals based on the noms.  

I will let you know when we receive the payment from Brazos for Feb 2001, so 
you can enter the demand fee to forward the cash to Tenaska IV.

Thanks,
Megan

Please change the demand fee on deal 384258 for July 2001 from $3,902,687.50 to $3,878,621.27.  We received the TXU statement for July and our expenses went down.  Also, please change the volume on deal 514353 from 45,000 to 47,901.  The plant took 1,484,933 MMBtu in July.

Sandi, 

Sorry for just now getting back with you.  I was out last week.  

The rate ($.04/mmbtu) will be charged on the greater of the volumes nominated 
on the supply contracts or the actual deliveries to the plant.  The fee will 
be adjusted yearly based on CPI.

Bob - I could not remember if we stated the type of settlement on the 
delivered volumes (actuals or nominations).  I think we should use actuals 
due to possibility that the plant could over pull with out our knowledge on a 
daily basis.  We would receive the estimates/actuals on a lag and may have to 
purchase gas to offset the imbalance, even though the plant kept the noms at 
the 45,000 base.  I also think that if the plant does increase the nom, they 
are more likely to pull the additional volume rather than pulling less.  Do 
you agree with this?

Daren,
When we met regarding the rate for the Tenaska Gas Management Agreement, you 
guys mentioned that it would be tied to an index--could you restate for me 
how that is to work--it will start out 4 cents per MMBTU based on the greater 
of the volumes nominated through the supply contracts or the actual 
deliveries to the plant. Then the fee will vary month to month? year to year? 
based on what index?

Thanks,
Sandi

Please let me know ASAP.

Subject: Tenaska IV 10/00

In most cases, ENA will be a net buyer from Tenaska IV for activity related 
to the Cleburne plant.  However, for October 2000, the plant was down the 
majority of the month and ENA sold off the supply, resulting in ENA owing 
money to Tenaska IV.

I have created deal 529856 with a demand of $1,798,389.73, which is the 
calculated amount of income on the Cleburne desk. (Please see the attached 
schedule.)   We need to pass this income on to Tenaska IV.  Do we need to pay 
this amount (wire from ENA to Tenaska IV) or is there another way to do 
this?  This is the case for October 2000 and could possibly happen again in 
the future.

Greg, Troy, Jim - Please let me know what you think about settling this.

Megan - Don't pay the amount until we here from the Greg, Troy and Jim.  
Also, make sure that we have received dollars from the spot sales before we 
reimburse Tenaska IV.

We have actuals.  The larger of the two volumes is 1,395,000, which is 
45,000/day, so the demand rate in deal 514353 is fine.  I am having a 
problem, though, with the way it is coming to settlements.  It is showing up 
with a Jan 2003 delivery date.  I think the demand fee needs to be on 10/1 
only.  Right now, it is on a line with a date of 10/1/00 to 12/31/36.   I 
think this is confusing the system some how.  Also, we still need the 
purchase deal for Tenaska IV.  It should be for a demand fee of $2,571,135.73 
booked to the Cleburne desk.  We actually owe $1,798,389.73, but I need to 
net the Tenaska IV sales with the purchase to clear those receivables.  James 
is calling me every day asking for an update.  Do you know when we will be 
able to get this in the system?  I have attached my spreadsheet so you can 
see the numbers.

I see the demand fee changes and the Williams price change.  That all looks 
great, but I still have a problem with the Apache prices.   For 10/00 and 
11/00, we have a price of 2.285 for deal 384247.  Apache billed 2.175 for 
both months.  Are we going to change the Apache prices?

I thought it might be helpful to summarize the next steps we agreed are 
necessary to put a "gas agency" agreement in place between the Texas desk and 
Ponderosa Pine Energy, LLC.

Mazowita and Farmer to work with plant manager (Mike Gough) to determine:
How power schedules are received from Brazos and translated into fuel 
requirements
The plant's operating flexibility to use fuel oil over natural gas
How the use of fuel oil is built into the dispatch/operation decision
The degree to which the plant has historically been involved with fuel 
suppliers beyond TGC (i.e., Apache, Williams, Lone Star)

Mazowita and Farmer to work with TGC (Nancy Stivers) to determine: 
How gas schedules are received from the plant
Why there were structural differences between the Apache/Williams fuel supply 
agreements and the TGC agency agreement
TGC's experience with optimizing value under the fuel supply agreements

Farmer to determine if a "form agreement" is available within ENA for 
transactions of this nature

Lyons/Hill to determine (a) if there is a need to have the gas agency 
agreement at the project vs. holding company level and (b) if bank approvals 
are needed as a result of the new agreement

Lyons/Mazowita/Farmer to draft agency agreement

Griffith to determine the best means of handling "duel fuel" capability at 
the plant within ENA

As an aside, I passed the information that Daren gave me in the meeting 
concerning the tax certificate for the use of fuel oil on to Rhett Jackson, 
who handled tax-related matters during the acquisition phase of this 
project.  

Please keep me in the loop as these contacts are made and let me know how I 
can help.

I looked at the service records and, for Oct 2000 through April 2001, we have paid $381,263.04 to TXU for transport.  We have another $159,745.14 in draft status.  The two amounts total $541,008.18.  I'm not sure why we have items in draft status.  Antoinette Beale handles the transport payments and I think she is out today.  I know she was having trouble with the volumes coming over.  I have left her a message to call me when she gets back so we can finalize those payments.  The May 2001 estimates total $57,249.44 in the system.  Let me know if you need any more information.

Section 6.4 of Tenaska IV's gas transportation agreement with Lone Star requires the shipper to pay transporter $1,040,000 in transportation fees and/or deficienty payments from the initial delivery date through December 31, 2003.  Do we know what the payments to Lone Star have been to date?  If not, can we find out by contacting Lone Star?

Daren, per review of the Gas agreements between Tenaska IV and 
Williams/Apache and our understanding of the Agency agreement, I had a few 
items I  wanted to discuss with you (in lieu of our meeting today that was 
cancelled):

1. Looking at the October gas supply to the plant, I think Tenaska IV should 
have been charged at the contract prices with Williams & Apache (i.e.  2.285) 
and not at what the final price that was actualized per Megan's summary - 
230,406 at $710,616.70, price of $3.084.  If this volume was charged  at 
2.285 the total would have been $526,477.71, a difference of $184,138.99.

2. Looking at the November gas supply to the plant, Tenaska IV was charged 
$2.91 per MMbtu, instead of $2.285 for volumes of 267,300.  At the $2.91  
price, the total settlement price was $777,843 instead of $610,780.50 at 
2.285, showing a difference of $167,062.50.

I reviewed the gas supply agreements and the Williams gas price (pg. 19) for 
2000 gas is 2.32, which can be adjusted by the Waha Transportation Adjustment 
if delivered at Waha.  This adjustment started in 1997 at $.03 per MMbtu and 
increase by 5% per year.  Thereby currently, the adjustment factor is at 
.0347, giving us a price of $2.2853 per MMbtu.

In reviewing the Apache gas agreement (pg. 22), I noticed that the gas price 
is 2.285 at Waha & 2.315 at Katy/Carthage for 2000.  Per review of the Apache 
invoices, it appears that we are not getting our gas at these points but at 
other places (i.e. Lomak-Sterling & Mendell CDP) at a price of $2.175.  If 
Enron has a separate agreement at these delivery points and can capture a 
margin difference then that is upside to Enron.  However, I think the plant 
should not be charged above the contract price of $2.285.

Looking at the daily gas that was scheduled to the plant for November and 
October, I did not see that their use went over the contracted volumes from 
Williams and Apache of 45,000 MMbtu per day.  Therefore I don't think spot 
prices are part of the equation here.  Additionally, I recall from our 
meeting last month that all Enron makes on this deal is the Agency Fee of 
$.04 per MMbtu (excluding the margin difference that Enron has on Apache gas 
delivery points if my scenario above is correct).

So based upon items 1 & 2 above, I am suggesting that Tenaska IV adjust their 
November invoice owed to Enron for gas used by the plant by the gas price 
differences showed above.  Therefore, I am planning to wire a payment of 
$484,234.03 (see breakout below) on Friday, 12/22, to Enron on behalf of 
Tenaska IV Texas Partners, Ltd. for this activity.

  Month   Plant Gas Price Amount
  November  267,300  2.91 $777,843 
  November adjustment    $(167,062.50)   
  October adjustment    $(184,138.99)
  Nov. Agency Fee 1,350,000 .04 $54,000
  Sept. Agency Fee 98,813  .04 $3,592.52
       Total $484,234.03

I discussed these issues with Mike Mazowita, Rick Hill & Jody Pierce before 
reaching this conclusion.  Should you have any different ideas or thoughts 
that I am not covering, please call me at 3-7280 and we can discuss.  Thanks.

James

John,

I did some preliminary work on your question concerning oil use at the 
Cleburne, Texas plant. See the attached document.

 I just answered all of your questions in an effort to save time. I'm still 
summarizing the procedures that are used for gas nominations. Call me with 
any questions.

Rick and Mike,

When you talk to plant manager I have a few other questions regarding the 
fuel oil. 

1)  What exact oil can they burn? What sulphur content?

2)  How much oil is in storage at the plant?

3)  What is the storage capacity at the plant?

4)  Are there any oil contracts at this time?  

5)  How do they normally buy oil?

6)  How is the oil transported to the plant?

7)  Are there any transport contracts for oil?

8)  What is the efficiency for the oil at the plant?

9)  What are the costs to burn oil?  Any downtime due to this?  Any costs to 
switch?  Time it takes to switch?

10)  What are the decisions that the plant goes through to decide to switch?

11)  What are the emission concerns?  Are they long emission credits?  Do 
they get credits annually?  How many?

12)  Does Brazos have any control over burning oil vs. burning natural gas?

13)  Can the plant run totally on oil?

14)  Any costs to switch back to natural gas?

Please let me know if you need anything from me.  Thanks.

John

That sounds great.  Because of the accrual, I cannot draft this today.  I 
will try it on Monday.  What about the demand fee for the payable to Tenaska 
IV.  Do you think that is a good idea?  I explained it to Kris Hanson and she 
agreed that it was the best way to book this payable.  We would need a new 
demand purchase ticket for Tenaska IV on the Cleburne desk in the amount of 
$2,803,586.41 with no volume and no commodity.  This is more than we owe 
Tenaska IV, but I will net it with the Tenaska IV sale and the $0.04 demand 
fee to pay a net amount of $1,551,050.76.  I have attached my spreadsheet 
which details our payment.  We will have to adjust this number once we get 
the actual volumes.  I would like to pay Tenaska IV next week, so please let 
me what you think.



Thanks,
Megan

Daren, I wanted to check with you on the current status of the of TXU Pipeline imbalance for Tenaska IV.  I noticed on the July statement I just received that the imbalance was at 125,374 MMBTU.  I am not sure if you have been told, but Enron recently entered into a sale agreement with El Paso to sale our interests in this plant by the end of September.  Talking with Rick Hill, he did not want to have a large imbalance liability with the pipeline at the end of September.  Do you think this imbalance will be significantly resolved by the end of the month?  You can call me at 3-7280 if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Can you clarify for me how the agency fee is suppose to be calculated?  I am getting mixed information.  I know that we use the higher of the two volumes (receipts vs. deliveries).  The question is do we use the nom volume or the actual volume.  Last month (March), we left the volume at the nom of 45,000/day.  In the past , we have changed the volume to the actual daily volume.  For April, the actuals are higher than the nom and we would need to bump the volume up to 47,089/day.  James Armstrong is using the actual volume.  The deal for the fee is 514353.

My other problem is that the spreadsheet is choosing the max of three volumes, receipts, deliveries and transport.  Should the transport volume be in the calculation?  Also, Mark added some payback volume to the spreadsheet and it is being included in the receipt volume.   Do I include the payback volume in the calculation of the agency fee if we use the nom?  If you have a copy of the contract that addresses the agency fee, I would like to have a copy.  You can fax it to 713-571-3141.  If none of this makes sense, give me a call and I can try and explain further.
 


Thanks,
Megan

OK, since we don't appear to be able to hook up by phone...

With respect to (1), if ENA can't effectively manage the plant's positions, who can you recommend that could under the same terms?  As you recall, the equity owners do have a buyer interested in the asset, so the arrangement would probably be short-term at best.

I think the bank that has collateral rights to the asset will be concerned with the payable.  With respect to (2), did your discussions with Legal lead to any conclusions with respect to compensating the project?  What is the amount of the claim the project has back to ENA?  I agree that the project should make payments directly to the suppliers and Lone Star.

I'm around, give me a call if you get a chance.

Rick, 

We need to talk about the ability of ENA to continue its the current role as agent of Tenaska IV.

1)  Since the end on November, ENA has not been able to complete gas trading transactions.  We cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in Texas.  This, of course, is due to the bankruptcy.  As a result, we are not able to sale Tenaska's excess fuel.  We did contact Brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a Gas Daily price, but they do not want it (gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while).  In December, we had to cut 10,000/day from the 7th through the 27th.  For January, we haven't had to cut yet, but I am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future.

2)  For November activity (which was settled in Dec), ENA owes Tenaska IV for the excess supply that we sold.  However, due to the bankruptcy, we could not make payments out.  ENA could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline.  James Armstrong paid the counterparties directly.  I think that he should continue to do this for Dec and Jan.  We should not transfer any funds from Tenaska IV to ENA.

I don't know how Enron's ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding.  But we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management.

Please give me a call or e-mail me.  We can get together sometime Thurs or Fri morning.

I think we need to remove some of the demand charges that have been set up 
for Williams and Apache.  On Williams deal 384237, the demand charge needs to 
be removed from Sept. 2000.  The demand charge should not have started until 
October 2000.   Because we did not know at the time what was happening with 
this deal, the demand fee was inadvertently paid to Williams for Sept. and we 
need to recoup our money.  On Apache deal 384247, James thinks we need to 
remove the demand charge completely.  He says it is not a part of the deal 
and Apache is not billing us for it.  We also need to talk about the pricing 
on both of these deals.  Williams and Apache are billing us less than what we 
have in Sitara.  To be able to keep this desk at zero, Jim Pond does not want 
me to use pay the lesser of  for the purchases, so we need to address the 
price differences.   You said you had some contract briefs that supported our 
prices.  Please fax a copy to me at 713-646-8420 and I will compare them to 
what James has.

Just a heads up...We are beginning to work on November 2000, so we will need 
a demand fee entered (hopefully next week).  I will email you the spreadsheet 
after we have received all of the cash and are ready to pay Tenaska IV.

Thanks,
Megan

I'm having trouble understanding this.  Is she referring to the unsigned agency agreement between ENA and Tenaska IV Texas Partners, Ltd. (aka Ponderosa Pine Energy Partners), an agency agreement between ENA and Lone Star (I'm not familiar w/the name TXU Gas Distribution), or an agreement between any of the former and Tenaska Gas, either relating to the Cleburne project or otherwise????

I am searching for an executed agency agreement between ENA and Tenaska Gas Company.  ENA is agent on the TXU Gas Distribution pipeline.


This agency agreement relates to Contract No. 1671 and Contract No. 1856 on the TXU Gas Distribution pipeline.


Please let me know if either of you are in possession of this agency agreement.

Our market typicially is the plant (Tenaska IV Partners)
If the plant is down, Brazos Utility has the right to the gas if they want it
If Brazos does not call for the gas, then we will sell off to whomever we can

We just get a flat fee on this gas per MMBtu, whether it goes to the plant or 
not

Daren Farmer knows the specifics about the deal

Hope this helps, call with any questions.

TXU revised their rates for Jan 2001. They are now billing us at $0.10 and 
$0.08 for contract 1671.  This was previously billed all at $0.10.  Please 
change the demand fee on deal 384258 from $3,841,888.11 to $3,830,131.18.

Also, I spoke to TXU about the rate on contract 1856 (deal 452475).  They 
have been billing us $0.11 and we have $0.10.  The extra cent is for the El 
Paso header fee.  The pricing you gave me is for contract 1671, but also has 
the header fee if you look on page 5 of 6.  You'll see a a section called 
"Compression & Header Expense if Utilized".  The current rate for 1856 is 
$0.01 and 0% fuel.  I will leave a copy of the contract in your chair.

Thanks,
Megan

we can use the same transport contract on Lone Star and transport on other

As individuals involved in the day-to-day oversight and management of PPEP's Cleburne facility, it's important that you are familiar with and follow the covenants set out under the purchase agreement signed with Mesquite Investors, LLC (an El Paso affiliate) on September 7.  Those covenants are contained in Section 5.4 of the purchase agreement, which is attached for your reference.

The covenants are fairly self-explanatory.  However, if you have any questions concerning their interpretation or implementation, please contact Joe Henry at (713) 345-1549 or me at (713) 853-6027.

Thanks,

Sandi, 

Sorry for just now getting back with you.  I was out last week.  

The rate ($.04/mmbtu) will be charged on the greater of the volumes nominated 
on the supply contracts or the actual deliveries to the plant.  The fee will 
be adjusted yearly based on CPI.

Bob - I could not remember if we stated the type of settlement on the 
delivered volumes (actuals or nominations).  I think we should use actuals 
due to possibility that the plant could over pull with out our knowledge on a 
daily basis.  We would receive the estimates/actuals on a lag and may have to 
purchase gas to offset the imbalance, even though the plant kept the noms at 
the 45,000 base.  I also think that if the plant does increase the nom, they 
are more likely to pull the additional volume rather than pulling less.  Do 
you agree with this?

Daren,
When we met regarding the rate for the Tenaska Gas Management Agreement, you 
guys mentioned that it would be tied to an index--could you restate for me 
how that is to work--it will start out 4 cents per MMBTU based on the greater 
of the volumes nominated through the supply contracts or the actual 
deliveries to the plant. Then the fee will vary month to month? year to year? 
based on what index?

Thanks,
Sandi

Rick, 

We need to talk about the ability of ENA to continue its the current role as agent of Tenaska IV.

1)  Since the end on November, ENA has not been able to complete gas trading transactions.  We cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in Texas.  This, of course, is due to the bankruptcy.  As a result, we are not able to sale Tenaska's excess fuel.  We did contact Brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a Gas Daily price, but they do not want it (gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while).  In December, we had to cut 10,000/day from the 7th through the 27th.  For January, we haven't had to cut yet, but I am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future.

2)  For November activity (which was settled in Dec), ENA owes Tenaska IV for the excess supply that we sold.  However, due to the bankruptcy, we could not make payments out.  ENA could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline.  James Armstrong paid the counterparties directly.  I think that he should continue to do this for Dec and Jan.  We should not transfer any funds from Tenaska IV to ENA.

I don't know how Enron's ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding.  But we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management.

Please give me a call or e-mail me.  We can get together sometime Thurs or Fri morning.

Mark,

I understand that you need a note for your files regarding the Tenaska plant.

On Saturday, October 14, 2000 at 5:14 am, the plant had a catastrophic 
failure of the gas turbine. The entire plant is essentially shutdown until 
these repairs can be made. This outage will last a minimum of 10 days. Ken 
Riesz will keep you informed of our progress.

I hope this is what you need. Let me know.

Can you please put this in so I can bill?  From your spreadsheet, it looks

agency fee from the Tenaska IV receipt number, since we already have that

Bob Hall, Daren Farmer and I met on Thursday regarding the fee--I have a very

However, I  spoke with Dan Lyons yesterday regarding some issues with the

them further. In addition, Bob Hall, Daren and I thought we might could use a 
brief tutorial on the structure of the transaction generally, the parties

Lyons has volunteered to give us that tutorial but will not be available

45,000/day, so the demand rate in deal 514353 is fine.  I am having a 
problem, though, with the way it is coming to settlements.  It is showing up 
with a Jan 2003 delivery date.  I think the demand fee needs to be on 10/1 
only.  Right now, it is on a line with a date of 10/1/00 to 12/31/36.   I 
think this is confusing the system some how.  Also, we still need the 
purchase deal for Tenaska IV.  It should be for a demand fee of $2,571,135.73 
booked to the Cleburne desk.  We actually owe $1,798,389.73, but I need to 
net the Tenaska IV sales with the purchase to clear those receivables.  James 
is calling me every day asking for an update.  Do you know when we will be 
able to get this in the system?  I have attached my spreadsheet so you can 
see the numbers.

Daren,

We are working with Mark McCoy on getting some things repathed in the 
system.  It appears that we have not been actualizing the receipts in Unify 
just the deliveries -not sure why????.  We have been paying the suppliers 
based on whatever they invoice us for, which typically has been a smaller 
number than what we have in Unify.  Also, we have not been able to get a 
contact for the allocation statement.  In some cases, we get the summary 
sheet, but no detail and some months we don't get anything at all.  Do you 
know of a good contact that we can call so that we receive the allocation on 
a timely and consistent basis?  The contacts on the allocation statements 
that we do have are not returning phone calls.  I also need to know what was 
the beginning balance when we took this on for Tenaska?   Anything else that 
we need from you, I will call you.

Thanks,
RW

We need to change the demand fees for Tenaska IV based on actuals for Jan 2001.   Tenaska owes us some additional money.  I have attached my netting spreadsheet if you need it.

Deal 514353		Change MMBtu from 45,000 to 46,113
Deal 384258		Change amount from $3,934,644.50 to $3,841,888.11

 

I got your message regarding Apache.  I will just leave the pay the lesser ofs there until they come back for it.   Also, Mark checked with TXU and we do not have the rights to get dailies for the Tenaska meters.  He said that only the interconnecting pipes get dailies.  For the spreadsheet, I am just going to prorate the actuals based on the noms.  

I will let you know when we receive the payment from Brazos for Feb 2001, so you can enter the demand fee to forward the cash to Tenaska IV.

Thanks,
Megan

Brazos is not requesting any gas volumes through September 25, 2001. We are forecasting to start the plant around September 26, 2001.

Hi Darrin,

Rita has asked me to provide her with all the "deal numbers" associated for 
the Cornhusker (Tenaska IV Texas Partners) Deal.  When you get a chance, 
would you please send me those deal numbers.   

Even though I can print reports such as the "Deal Volume Tracking Report" to 
retrieve some of the deal numbers, Rita was concerned that there might be 
other deals set-up in Unify, which we don't know about.

Thank you,

Kathy  :  )

We need to change the demand fee on deal 384258 for Tenaska IV for 4/01.  The Williams invoice was not as much as the spreadsheet showed, so our expenses decreased.  Please change the amount from $2,979,909.91 to $2,862,531.95.  I have attached the revised spreadsheet.

 

Thanks,
Megan

Rick,
Attached are drafts of the letters notifiying Williams, Apache and Lone Star  
that ENA will be acting as agent for Tenaska IV. Please review the letters 
and get back to me on the following items:

Person to send the letters to at the respective companies
Fax #'s to fax it to on Friday
Name and adress of ENA person to direct inquiries to
Name and phone number of person to direct questions re: the notification 
letter
People at Tenaska to copy and their address and fax #'s
Comments on substance of the letter (please review carefully my reference to 
what ENA is acting as agent for--it is specific as to noms, scheduling and 
billing, not a general agency for all things under the contract--is that 
correct?) 

If you don't mind, please forward any email response to Bob Walker and leave 
me a voicemail. I will be out of the office Friday, but checking voicemail 
and coordianting with Bob to get these out.



Also, once we send these letters out, we should be prepared for each of these 
entities to ask to see the agency agreement. They may, in fact, not be 
comfortable dealing with ENA with just this letter.

Daren---(Re: the email below from Kathy Benedict)  If I'm not mistaken, I 
thought we didnt take end up taking over Cornhusker completely until 
October?  I thought Tenaska was still doing it, at least accounting for it.  
Therefore, this gas wasn't pathed during the month...and I believe we didnt 
have all the tickets in at the time.  What do you recall?

Thanks,
Mark

Megan/James--

Here is a revised copy of the Tenaska business for April (per Megan's Eagle Eye).....sorry for the inconvenience.  

 

And don't forget to back out  20.000 less fuel to get the total delivered on the transports.......the 20.000 comes from
the last 4 days of the month at meter17-4335-00 and is payback by Williams....it is not figured in, because there noms are kept whole in this
worksheet.

I have several changes to the demand fees for Tenaska IV.  Let me know if you have any questions.

For Dec 2000, we need to adjust the demand fee on deal 529856 to account for a volume change on the receipt side.  We overpaid Williams and are going to take our money back.  We then need to refund Tenaska IV.  Please change the demand fee from $878,330.63 to $918,566.13.

For Feb 2001, please change the demand fee on deal 384258 from $2,341,675.50 to $3,438,325.95.  Tenaska IV owes us for the remaining expenses.  Also, please change the agency volume on deal 514353 from 45,000 to 45,067.

For March 2001, please change the demand fee on deal 384258 from $2,591,791.50 to $2,653,694.95.  I have attached the March spreadsheet I received from Mark in case you want to see it.

Darren,

How are things going?  Just a note to reiterate what we talked about 
yesterday.  Rick Hill wanted to know what the admin fee would be if the fee 
was for an outside counterparty.  This admin fee would be for the life of the 
project (through 2019).   Also, Mike Mazowita should be calling you to talk 
about the plant being down this week through the end of the month.  Please 
let me know if you have any questions or concerns.  Thanks.

John

James, thanks for following up on this.

FYI to all, the agreement we have with El Paso has a fairly tight confidentiality provision that goes to internal (as well as external) communication of the transaction:

"No party shall make any announcement of the transactions contemplated hereby to any of its officers, employees, representatives, consultants or advisors other than those who have a specific and strategic need to be advised of such information, all of whom shall be advised of the strict confidential nature of such information."
The language stems from a problem we had when East Coast Power was sold late last year, but probably works to our advantage in this case.  Suffice to say that this group needs to be plugged in on what's coming down the pipe.  However, we need to limit discussion of the transaction to the maximum extent possible.

Thanks, 

RH

Daren, I wanted to check with you on the current status of the of TXU Pipeline imbalance for Tenaska IV.  I noticed on the July statement I just received that the imbalance was at 125,374 MMBTU.  I am not sure if you have been told, but Enron recently entered into a sale agreement with El Paso to sale our interests in this plant by the end of September.  Talking with Rick Hill, he did not want to have a large imbalance liability with the pipeline at the end of September.  Do you think this imbalance will be significantly resolved by the end of the month?  You can call me at 3-7280 if you have any questions.  Thanks.

James

I have entered deals into Sitara.  The supply deals are 384247 and 384237.  
The sale is 384258.  The sale is not currently booked at the correct location 
or with a counterparty.  The pricing on the sale includes the admin fee, 
transport, demand charges, an average of the buy prices and 1% fuel charge.  
If the pricing is wrong (or anything else), please let me know and I'll redo 
it.  Please let me know of any concerns/questions.

If the plants become an external counterparty, the fee should probably go 
back to the 
scale in the original contract.  The assumption being that the original plant 
financing could afford
the escalating fee.

Let me know if you want me to look into it any further.

thanks

Daren, with Megan gone I just wanted to touch base with you on the status of the Enron payments owed to the Cleburne plant.  The current issues are as follows:

November Gas Sales					$600,377.50
October payment to ENA for TXU pipeline charges	$108,405.00
Cleburne receivable from Enron				$708,782.50

Less: November Gas Agency Fees			($54,000.00)

Net Cleburne Receivable from Enron			$654,782.50

Per my discussions with Megan, she stated that about $500K of the $600K Nov gas sales was intercompany (desk to desk) sales, with the remainder from TXU.  Are we able to settle any intercompany deals now? Are we able to settle with TXU?

Additionally, you'll see that I included the Oct TXU payment in the receivable owed to Cleburne also.  This is because I always pay Megan based upon the pipeline estimates in Michael's file, even though they are not finalized until the next month.  Therefore in my November payment to Enron, I paid ENA for October's estimate, of which Megan would have paid the final bill on 12/26/01 when it was finalized.  However, I had to pay the October bill directly last month, even though I had already sent the funds to ENA in November.  Therefore, I essentially paid this bill twice (once to ENA in Nov & once to TXU in Dec).  I deducted the November Agency Fees from these receivable totals to show the net amount owed to Cleburne.

Please advise as to the status of these bills.  You can reach me at 713-853-7280.  Thanks.

James

Daren,
When we met regarding the rate for the Tenaska Gas Management Agreement, you 
guys mentioned that it would be tied to an index--could you restate for me 
how that is to work--it will start out 4 cents per MMBTU based on the greater 
of the volumes nominated through the supply contracts or the actual 
deliveries to the plant. Then the fee will vary month to month? year to year? 
based on what index?

Thanks,
Sandi

Well, folks, the Cleburne deal has started.  The deal has not been finalized 
through legal.  However, we were able to "get between" a few deals and make 
some money before we finalized it.  The Cleburne plant was down 7/31-8/7 and 
8/31.  On these dates, we bought gas from Tenaska IV Texas Partners and sold 
to ANP and Tenaska Marketing.  Because things were not set up, I could not 
enter the deals until now.  Please review the following deals and settle with 
the customers. 

Buy from Tenaska IV
 July 399763
 Aug 399773

Sell to Tenaska Marketing
 July 399791
 Aug 399797

Sell to ANP
 Aug 399814

The trading desk these are on is "ENA-IM Cleburne".

Kris - I have forwarded invoices from Tenaska IV to you via intercompany 
mail.  (I received both invoices this week)

 I am sure there are questions, just give me a call.  Tanks.

FYI----

I checked with Ken Reisz with Tenaska IV this afternoon re: maintenance being 
completed, and at this point they are still on track to come back up on the 
9th sometime......however, he did say that they have not gotten a look at 
everything just yet, but expect to have a better idea as to their downtime in 
the morning.  He said he would call Mary with the latest news.  Mary, please 
check with him on Thursday to see where they are at, at if we need to nom gas 
to Lonestar or not.

Thanks,
Mark

Yes, the dollar amount is what we need to recoup from Williams.  I will take the credit with our payment to Williams on the 25th.  Tenaska  will send us their wire to us on the 24th.  I will make sure we receive the wire from Tenaska before I send the wire to Williams.  I will also let James know about the volume for the agency fee.  I thought it was suppose to be calculated on actual volume, not the nominated volume.

Subject:	RE: Tenaska IV March 2001

I have changed the demand fee.  But, is this adjusted by the dollar amount that we need to recoup from Williams?  I don't want to pay Tenaska until we get the money from Williams.  Additionally, I believe that we need to keep the volume at 45,000 for the admin fee, since we originally nominated 45,000/day.

We have the actuals from TXU for Tenaska IV for March 2001.  The receipt from Williams was not kept whole, so we have money to recoup from Williams and repay to Tenaska IV.  Please change the following deals.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Deal 384258	change demand fee from $2,653,694.95 to $2,607,176.02
Deal 514353	change volume from 45,000 to 44,590

TXU revised their rates for Jan 2001. They are now billing us at $0.10 and $0.08 for contract 1671.  This was previously billed all at $0.10.  Please change the demand fee on deal 384258 from $3,841,888.11 to $3,830,131.18.

Also, I spoke to TXU about the rate on contract 1856 (deal 452475).  They have been billing us $0.11 and we have $0.10.  The extra cent is for the El Paso header fee.  The pricing you gave me is for contract 1671, but also has the header fee if you look on page 5 of 6.  You'll see a a section called "Compression & Header Expense if Utilized".  The current rate for 1856 is $0.01 and 0% fuel.  I will leave a copy of the contract in your chair.

Thanks,
Megan

We need to change the demand fees for Tenaska IV based on actuals for Jan 2001.   Tenaska owes us some additional money.  I have attached my netting spreadsheet if you need it.

Deal 514353		Change MMBtu from 45,000 to 46,113
Deal 384258		Change amount from $3,934,644.50 to $3,841,888.11

 

I got your message regarding Apache.  I will just leave the pay the lesser ofs there until they come back for it.   Also, Mark checked with TXU and we do not have the rights to get dailies for the Tenaska meters.  He said that only the interconnecting pipes get dailies.  For the spreadsheet, I am just going to prorate the actuals based on the noms.  

I will let you know when we receive the payment from Brazos for Feb 2001, so you can enter the demand fee to forward the cash to Tenaska IV.

Thanks,
Megan

have a different price.  For deal 384247, we have a price of 2.285 and a 
demand fee of 0.457 for 25,000/day.  Apache is billing us at 2.175 with no

Darren, 
The demand fee is probably the best solution.  We can use it to create a 
recieivable/payable with Tenaska, depending on which way the calculation goes 
each month.  How are PMA's to be handled once the fee been calculated and the 
deal put in the system?

Attatched is a schedule detailing what is on the GL for Cleburne as of 
today.  Some of this info will change by the end of the month.  As you can 
see, there are some discrepancies between Megan's calculations and what is on 
the general ledger.  UA4 is also on my schedule.  Unless the buys/sells are 
volumetrically balanced, we book an entry to balance the desk.  This will 
change the calculation of what is due from/to Tenaska.  Should we be 
recording a UA4 entry for Cleburne?  Is it addressed in the agreement with 
Tenaska?

Subject: Tenaska IV 10/00

In most cases, ENA will be a net buyer from Tenaska IV for activity related 
to the Cleburne plant.  However, for October 2000, the plant was down the 
majority of the month and ENA sold off the supply, resulting in ENA owing 
money to Tenaska IV.

I have created deal 529856 with a demand of $1,798,389.73, which is the 
calculated amount of income on the Cleburne desk. (Please see the attached 
schedule.)   We need to pass this income on to Tenaska IV.  Do we need to pay 
this amount (wire from ENA to Tenaska IV) or is there another way to do 
this?  This is the case for October 2000 and could possibly happen again in 
the future.

Greg, Troy, Jim - Please let me know what you think about settling this.

Megan - Don't pay the amount until we here from the Greg, Troy and Jim.  
Also, make sure that we have received dollars from the spot sales before we 
reimburse Tenaska IV.

We have actuals.  The larger of the two volumes is 1,395,000, which is 
45,000/day, so the demand rate in deal 514353 is fine.  I am having a 
problem, though, with the way it is coming to settlements.  It is showing up 
with a Jan 2003 delivery date.  I think the demand fee needs to be on 10/1 
only.  Right now, it is on a line with a date of 10/1/00 to 12/31/36.   I 
think this is confusing the system some how.  Also, we still need the 
purchase deal for Tenaska IV.  It should be for a demand fee of $2,571,135.73 
booked to the Cleburne desk.  We actually owe $1,798,389.73, but I need to 
net the Tenaska IV sales with the purchase to clear those receivables.  James 
is calling me every day asking for an update.  Do you know when we will be 
able to get this in the system?  I have attached my spreadsheet so you can 
see the numbers.

Darren:
I am working with Jim Pond to clean up the UA4 that has been booked to Cleburne since the beginning of the deal.  We are starting with November 2000.  Gas accounting has booked 21,309 MMBtu as UA4 for November, which is related to deal 502861 on the Texas desk.  It looks like we took some of the gas we purchased from Williams (deal 384237) on the Cleburne desk and moved it to ENA's transport contract with deal 502861.  The print screen below shows the deal from Zone transport to ENA-Texas.  I think we need a deal from Cleburne to Zone Transport to complete to deal path and clean up the UA4.  Can you review the deals for November and let me know what you think?  Jim says there is UA4 every month of this deal and this may be the reason.  I will have to check each month.

Thanks,
Megan

Daren--

I know you're busy with bid week, so here are a couple questions & comments 
for you:

September
I need to know if a ticket has been set up for September for the market side 
of the Williams & Apache gas.  We still only the supply is in MOPS.  If it 
just needs points added to it, just let me know the deal ticket #.

August 31st
This was the day we scheduled the payback to our two transport contracts on 
Lonestar  1023 & 1460.  Currently, they do not have the supply points needed 
for the Williams & Apache gas in order for the gas to be pathed to 
imbalance...so I will get them added so this gas can be pathed.  

July 31 - Aug 7
These days were pathed as buy/sells from Tenaska IV to Tenaska Marketing 
Ventures.

I worked with volume management to get these out in time for payment (July & 
Aug business), and had them do a manual entry for Aug 31st.


Please let me know what you think when you get a chance.


Thanks,
Mark

I took a look at the transport for TXU Lone Star for Tenaska IV for 10/00.  
We mostly have price differences, but one deal needs some days added.  Let me 
know if you need copies of the invoices.  The meters below are delivery 
meters.  I wasn't sure what the receipt meters would be.

Deal 452491, Meter 20014903  Need to add days 24-26 and 28-31 
     Need to check rate - We show $0.01 and we were billed $0.02

Deal 452491, Meter 25000200  Need to check rate - We show $0.02 and we were 
billed $0.10

Deal 452475, Meter 25000200  Need to check rate - We show prices from $0.005 
to $0.02
      and we were billed $0.11

Can you look at this again?  I'm missing the 7 before the decimal point.

We have received all of the money from the spot sales for Tenaska IV in 
October 2000, except for the Tenaska IV sale and the $0.04 fee.

Spoke with Ken Reisz (Operations Mgr) and he said the plant is due to be up 
on Friday Nov. 24th, so we will need to start nominating the gas for that day 
on.  He expects a full load to be pulled.  Of course, that what we thought 
before the last catastrophy.

We need to forward the money from the Feb 2001 Brazos sale to Tenaska IV.  I am assuming you want to handle this as before by entering a purchase demand fee on deal 529856 in the amount of $1,143,484.53.  There is already a demand fee for Feb 2001 for $29,851.64, so I think we just need to change that to the new amount.  Let me know if you want to handle this differently.

Megan

I have a correction:

I changed the pipe code but the system will not allow me to save because the meter no. for PGTT 4100101 already exist on Facility No. 517817.  


Karl please contact me as soon as possible to discuss this matter.

Per authorization fromDaren Farmer, I have changed pipe code PGEV to PGTT.  The meter no. will remain the same.  The Rate Zone is PGTT and the Trade Zone is TUFCO.

Should you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Look thru the sequence history.  The Meter # on the opposite side did not change 
even though the pipe code did.  That is all I have to suggest.

I need to get the approval from Daren Farmer ext. 3-6905.  Please feel
free to contact him to discuss this matter.
Also, I do not believe the meter no. will be the same.  I searched PI
Grid and it shows HPL with DRN 92686 interconnect with meter no.
237-07-1-004, DRN 26879 for Teco Pipeline Co.
We have discrepencies/isssues.
What verifying information do you have for this meter?

I am having trouble with the transport deal for the Tenaska IV contracts on 
Lone Star.  We have deal 452491 in Sitara for meter 20014804 at a $0.01 
transport rate.  We received the statement from TXU Lone Star and it does not 
agree with our deal.  They are billing for meter 25000200 at $0.10 and meter 
20014903 at $0.02.  These meters relate to the Tenaska IV sale deal 384258 
and the Tenaska Marketing deal 459898, respectively.  Should our deal match 
what TXU is billing or is there another deal that I am missing?  I haven't 
worked with transport very much, so I could be confused.  I think we have 
this problem with Oct 2000, also, but I have not reviewed it yet.  I am going 
to look at it this afternoon.  Tenaska IV has already reimbursed us for the 
TXU transport, so we will need to pay this next week.  

Also, now that we have the actuals for Nov 2000, we need to update the demand 
fees to reflect the correct volumes.  Barring any changes, I have listed the 
adjustments below and attached my spreadsheet.  The Unify adjustments will be 
over by about $20.00 from the spreadsheet.  I thought it would be better have 
the Cleburne desk at zero, than to leave a balance.

1. Deal 529856 - Change 11/1 demand fee from $341,250.47 to $493,365.74 
(Difference $152,115.27)
2. Deal 529856 - Change 11/2 demand fee from $167,062.50 to $159,721.55 
(Difference $7,340.95)
3. Deal 514353 - Change Agency fee volume from 45,000/day to 45,016/day 
(Difference $19.72)



Thanks,
Megan

Have you been able to work out these transport pricing differences for Oct. 
2000?  We have only been able to pay $4,000.00 of the $28,000.00 invoice.  
The pricing for Nov. 2000 (deal 452491) has problems too.  We have $0.01 for 
11/3 at meter 20014804 and TXU is billing us $0.10 at meter 25000200 and 
$0.02 at meter 20014903 for the entire month.

I have also noticed that we are not accruing any transport for Dec 2000 
forward.  We have received the Dec. 2000 invoice from TXU, but we do not have 
a deal to pay them.  We should be getting Jan. 2001 next week.  Is there a 
deal for these months?

Subject: Tenaska IV Transport 10/00

I took a look at the transport for TXU Lone Star for Tenaska IV for 10/00.  
We mostly have price differences, but one deal needs some days added.  Let me 
know if you need copies of the invoices.  The meters below are delivery 
meters.  I wasn't sure what the receipt meters would be.

Deal 452491, Meter 20014903  Need to add days 24-26 and 28-31 
     Need to check rate - We show $0.01 and we were billed $0.02

Deal 452491, Meter 25000200  Need to check rate - We show $0.02 and we were 
billed $0.10

Deal 452475, Meter 25000200  Need to check rate - We show prices from $0.005 
to $0.02
      and we were billed $0.11

Thanks,
Megan

Rick,
Attached are drafts of the letters notifiying Williams, Apache and Lone Star  
that ENA will be acting as agent for Tenaska IV. Please review the letters 
and get back to me on the following items:

Person to send the letters to at the respective companies
Fax #'s to fax it to on Friday
Name and adress of ENA person to direct inquiries to
Name and phone number of person to direct questions re: the notification 
letter
People at Tenaska to copy and their address and fax #'s
Comments on substance of the letter (please review carefully my reference to 
what ENA is acting as agent for--it is specific as to noms, scheduling and 
billing, not a general agency for all things under the contract--is that 
correct?) 

If you don't mind, please forward any email response to Bob Walker and leave 
me a voicemail. I will be out of the office Friday, but checking voicemail 
and coordianting with Bob to get these out.



Also, once we send these letters out, we should be prepared for each of these 
entities to ask to see the agency agreement. They may, in fact, not be 
comfortable dealing with ENA with just this letter.

Daren, there were several points on your list that were previously created 
and the remainder have been created, with the exception explained below.

Donna and I researched your list and identified the ones that were on system 
(which she would create) and the ones that were off system (which I would 
create).

Standard Pooling Stations and West Texas (Line X) Pooling Stations had no 
meters, so they are not set up.  

The Hunt Fairway Plant (17-8477-01) was previously created as (178477), I 
need to know if the (01) needs to be added.

We need to verify HPL - Texoma (17-0973-13), it is set up as (17097613).  Is 
this the same point???

Please let Donna and myself know how to proceed with the ones in red.


Thanks,
Faye

Daren:
Can you shed a little light on this Tenaska IV deal?  James Armstrong is 
telling me that we should have a purchase deal in the system to pay Tenaska 
IV for the 9/00 and 10/00 gas that we are marketing for them.  I do not see a 
deal in Path Manager for either month.  I also need some detail on who we are 
buying and selling this gas from and to.  There are a number of 
counterparties at Lonestar for ENA and I'm not sure which ones go with this 
deal.  Is there a schedule you can email to me?  James is looking for an 
answer today on the Tenaska IV payment, so whatever you can tell me will be 
appreciated.

Thanks,
Megan

We have actuals.  The larger of the two volumes is 1,395,000, which is 
45,000/day, so the demand rate in deal 514353 is fine.  I am having a 
problem, though, with the way it is coming to settlements.  It is showing up 
with a Jan 2003 delivery date.  I think the demand fee needs to be on 10/1 
only.  Right now, it is on a line with a date of 10/1/00 to 12/31/36.   I 
think this is confusing the system some how.  Also, we still need the 
purchase deal for Tenaska IV.  It should be for a demand fee of $2,571,135.73 
booked to the Cleburne desk.  We actually owe $1,798,389.73, but I need to 
net the Tenaska IV sales with the purchase to clear those receivables.  James 
is calling me every day asking for an update.  Do you know when we will be 
able to get this in the system?  I have attached my spreadsheet so you can 
see the numbers.

Daren--

Bad news.....the Cleburne imbalance is out of control.  You might want to start some payback to Lonestar.  Lonestar's estimates for the accumulative imbalance at the beginning of May was 140.0 due them, now I guess their actuals came in and now at the beginning of May shows 214.0 due them.  I am waiting to hear back from Lisa with Lonestar to see why there is such a big discrepancy.  Through the 16th, her updated estimates reflect an imbalance of 240.0 due them....the plant continues to overpull, our nom to the plant which is not all 45.0 due to Brazos' take.  

Let me know what you want to do.

Mark

That's great.  What about deal 452475?  We have $0.10 and we are being billed 
$0.11 for meter 25000200 on contract 1856.  Also, I faxed the Oct 2000 TXU 
invoices to Trisha Hughes so she can look into the Dec 2000 and forward

According to the contract brief I received, the 2.175 is a 1999 price.  I 
believe my pricing is correct.  Bob or Darren may be able your questions

I got an invoice for the gas we bought from Apache for Tenaska IV and they

demand fee of 0.457 for 25,000/day.  Apache is billing us at 2.175 with no 
demand charge.  Can you verify this price for me and let me know which is 
correct?
