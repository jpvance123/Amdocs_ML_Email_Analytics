We bought the Genesys shares before the IPO.  It was a private placement.  I 
suspect that someone in India will have the initial offering if that will 
help you any.  Let me know if you want me to run it down.  

I wil have to get back with you on the symbol for Rediff.com.

Lauren,
Was  a FIP (Foreign Investor Proposal) obtained in order for us to buy the 
shares in the IPO?  If the Mauritiurs entity was authorized to obtain the 
shares through the IPO, doesn't it then make sense that we can sell the 
shares?
Please let me know your thoughts.
Sheila

Subject: Re: Contacts

Sheila, as discussed yesterday, I need to do the following:

Open a brokerage account at Morgan Stanley for Enron de Inversiones de 
Energia S.C.A. (an Argentine company) (EDIDE)
This account will hold ADRs that will be contributed or transferred into its 
account by Enron Pipeline Company-Argentina S.A.  (EPCA)(account #038-088357) 
at Morgan Stanley.
EPCA will contribute 431,300 ADRs in Transportadora Gas del Sur (TGS) into 
EDIDE's new account.  That contribution represents the capital contribution 
that EPCA is obligated to make under the capital increase resolution dated 
February 20th, 2000.
After the ADR's are transferred into EDIDE's accounts, EDIDE will need to 
convert such ADR's into ordinary Class B shares in TGS so that they can be 
registered accordingly in Argentina.

Sheila, I am forwarding a hard copy of this e-mail with appropriate support 
(corporate resolutions authorizing me to open this account, resolution 
authorizing the increase in capital and some forms that I had Eduardo 
Ojea-Quintana (President of EDIDE) sign).

Please review and advise of what else you need to finalize this transaction.

Best Regards,

RFR

Hello David,

I didn't want to bother you - you're probably more than busy right now.

In my continuing effort to get your account going, specifically,
completing the margin line of credit, I thought the following might
help:

When Jeff Shankman first told me of Enron's requirement to have a line
of credit for margining, nat gas initial margin was $2750 per contract.
It is now $3850 and likely to rise again.  The 'cheap financing' that
our line represents to John Arnold may be even more appealing now (if he
has a second to convince Sara Shackleton to work on the documentation).

Otherwise, thanks for the intro to Bill White.  We've only spoken
briefly so far, but he did say he was trying to free up some time to get
something going.

I'll be in Houston in about two weeks, but I hope to talk to you before
then.

Regards,
Jim Naughton

Subject: Morgan Stanley Acocunt request for London Credit.com

Per discussion with David, Theresa and myself this morning, we have agreed 
that the current most effective approach is for Trena/Jeff K. to do the 
executions for London Credit.com and for Equity/Debt Trading to do the 
settlements.

The trades will be executed in the name of London Credit.com.  We need to set 
up a Morgan Stanley account in the name of London Credit.com to facilitate 
settlements.  

We contacted Ketan Parekh, Morgan Stanley, VP, Prime Brokerage, to discuss 
the impact of housing the account in NY vs. Morgan Stanley London.  Ketan 
said that they have many clients that are settling activity from Europe in 
their NY prime brokerage accounts with no problems.  Since the NY and London 
would be different settlement streams and in light of the current anticipated 
activity, we are requesting we open an account in Morgan Stanley NY.  

Sara, David suggested that Paul Simons would be the contact for account 
opening information.

Please do not hesitate to call if questions.
Thanks. Sheila

Everybody

Further to the sell-down of Sutton Bridge it looks like the originators are 
planning, as part of that deal to assign infinity deal number 25556, a 
currency swap we have with Sutton Bridge to EDF/London Electricity.  The 
hedge for this deal is a back to back deal with Natwest, infinity deal number 
25555.

My questions are:
When this swap was originally entered into there would have been a credit 
reserve taken for it, which will have to be released.  How much is this and 
what is the process?  I am assuming this release of credit will not effect my 
traders P&L.  Can you please confirm this.

What else do we need to look at to complete this assignment?  What are the 
legal implications?


The originator is looking to do this fairly quickly and so a quick response 
would be greatly appreciated.


Thanks
Trena

Disregard my prior question... Donna Lowry responded below that the 
investor/seller of the shares does not have to be registered with the BSE.
Thanks Sheila

I still would like the ticker of rediff.com if you have it or a copy of the

Dear Ms. Shackleton,

I refer to your fax dated 6th March, 2000.

The seller whether it is an Indian company or a foreign company is not
required to be registered with the BSE for the purpose of selling publicly
traded shares held by it of an Indian Company.  Only brokers and other
intermediaries such as merchant bankers etc. are required to be registered
with SEBI or BSE.

Please note that Vinay Dwarkadas is no longer working with us.

Regards,


S N Talwar

Hagerty/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 

Subject: Genesys : Sale of Shares : RBI approvall

Dear Rahul,

Your mail on the above subject refers.

As regards to the approvals to be followed in sale of the Genesys shares by 
Enron Distribution Ventures MHC Ltd., Mauritius, i list below the following:

(A) Approvals required:
Per section 10 B (1) the FEMA Regulations effective 1 June 2000, transfer by 
way of sale by a person resident outside India of the shares / debentures 
held by him to person resident in India will require prior permission of RBI. 
Veena, your activity chart shows that Form TS 1 is to be filed after the sale 
is effected, money received and at the time of remittance of sale proceeds. 
Since, the Act prescribes prior approval, we should sell only after receipt 
of RBI approval and not before.
The requisite form to be filed for seeking approval is Form TS1. 
If we are effecting the sale through a private arrangement , the application 
should be supported with the average quotation of the share price ( average 
of daily high and low) for one week proceeding the date of application, duly 
certified by a Chartered Accountant. If the sale proposed to be effected on 
the floor of the exchange to the general public at the prevailing market 
price, the Chartered Accountant's certification is not required. Since, we 
intend selling at the floor, this certification is not required.

(B) Thinly Traded:
I refer to Veena's query on whether Genesys shares are thinly traded. Per 
section 10 - Explanation i) the share will be treated as thinly traded if the 
annualised trading turnover in that share, on a main stock exchanges in 
India, during the six  calendar months preceding the month in which the 
application is made, is less than 2%( by number of shares) of the listed 
stock.
Though we can take a view that Genesys shares are listed for trading only 
from 5 June 2000, it is to be noted that the new shares issued to (a) the 
erstwhile Genesys shareholders are issued as a result of the scheme of 
amalgamation approved by the High Court, Mumbai & (b)  the applicants of the 
private placement ( incl. Enron) and the new amalgamated company, Genesys 
International Corporation Limited, whose previous name was Aeke Trading and 
Investments Limited, was a listed Company at the Mumbai Stock Exchange. 
Hence, it is advisable to check whether the shares of AEKE were thinly traded 
or not. FYI, the Paid - Up Equity of AEKE prior to the Amalgamation was 
2,40,000 Equity Shares of Rs. 10/- each aggregating Rs. 24,00,000/-. We can 
apply the test as explained above on the AEKE shares prior to Genesys 
amalgamation just to satisfy ourselves that it was not thinly traded.
It is better to check this provision. 

(C) Formalities for remittance:
Per section 11of the FEMA Regulations, remittance of sale proceeds shall be 
made by a authorised dealer upon:
satisfying himself that the security was held by the seller on repatriation 
basis ( we need to submit the Foreign Collaboration Approval Letter No. 3/9 
SIA/NFC 99 NRI to the AD)
submission of the contract note of the Broker effecting the sale and 
submission of a No Objection Certificate/ tax clearance certificate.

(D) Income Tax - NoC / TCC:
I understand from Veena that there is a current thinking that through a 
Chartered Accountants Certificate stating the double taxation treaty, we need 
not obtain the NoC of the IT. In my view, since the regulation stipulates an 
NoC / TCC from the IT Department, i doubt whether it is doable without a BoC 
/ TCC of the IT. 
In the past, this was followed and with an Undertaking from the Company, 
supported with a Chartered Accountants Certificate,confirming there are no 
tax implications in the underlying transaction, one could remit the funds 
without a NoC/TCC from IT. But, given a very specific statement u/s 11 of the 
FEMA Regulations and the same being introduced only from 1 June and hasn't 
been time tested, i doubt whether the Authorised Dealer will accept our view 
and effect fund transfer with an Undertaking and CA Certification. 
In my view, NoC would be a pre requisite. 

(E) Bank Account:
Assuming that the NoC is required, there will be a timing difference between 
we receive the sale proceeds and remitting the money to Mauritius after 
obtaining the NoC from IT. It is certainly not advisable to hold the 
instrument without encashing it. Hence, opening of a Bank Account in India to 
encash the instrument  is warranted. I refer to Mike's mail on allowing the 
Broker to hold the funds in a trust account for EDVMHC. In my view, instead 
of the Broker holding the same, the AD himself can hold it on trust for 
EDVMHC. But this needs to checked and properly documented with the Bank ( 
Authorised Dealer) and as well at EDVMHC. From Due Diligence and Compliance 
point of view, i would suggest to take the route of opening of an rupee Bank 
Account than the trust route. 
Since it is not a demated shares, opening of an custodial account is not 
required. This needs to be checked with the authorised dealer.

(F) Application to RBI / TS 1:
I suggest that while making the RBI Application under TS 1, it is advisable 
to state and seek their concurrence or keep them informed as to point E 
above. We could mention in our application to RBI and seek approval as to (a) 
opening of an rupee account or (b) authorising the AD to hold the same in an 
trust account for EDVMHC. RBI while according its approval, will look in to 
the transaction and accord approval for this as well. 
May be, before filing the application with RBI, we could meet with the 
concerned official in Exchange Control Department and walk him through with 
the transaction so that the approval is obtained at the earliest.

(G) Original Funds:
I understand that while making this investment, the funds have not come in 
from EDVMHC, Mauritius or it has come from a Company from Caymon Islands. Tax 
need to confirm whether the money received from Cayco ( though on behalf of 
an Mauritius Company) would qualify for tax benefits.  

(H) Confirmation by Genesys on non Lock-in:
There are no documents available like the Board Resolution while alloting the 
Shares to EDVMHC or the application to Stock Exchange which would specify 
distinctive numbers of the Lock-in Shares nor it is stated in the Information 
Memorandum as whether shares offered under this IM are freely tradable. 
Though the SEBI Guidelines are clear that if the shares do not form part of 
the Promoters Quoto, they are freely tradable, it is advised that we take a 
certificate from Genesys on this. I have spoken this with Rajesh who 
confirmed that such a certificate from Genesys can be otained without any 
difficulty.

Please feel free and do call me for any further assistance from my end.

Regards

Subject: Genesys : Sale of Shares : RBI approval

Seems to me from a read of the regulations that we are required 

Clause 10 B (1) to get RBI approval for the transfer on a TS1 form. Please 
note that the TS1 form requires a CA certificate
If we sell on an exchange through a broker, clause 10 B (2) (a) (i) will 
apply. Since the transfer takes place when its recorded on the register held 
by the company, there is time from when the sale order is given to the 
broker. 
Clause 11 (2) provides the conditions by which the AD will repatriate the 
money to Mauritius. Please note the requirement for an IT clearance in clause 
11 (2) (c). Also, it seems from Clause 11 (2) (b) that if we sell through the 
exchange, then approval of RBI under the TS1 is not required for the 
repatriation.

Rahul

Rahul,
David did put in a bid  for 330,000 shares with a cap of $12 this afternoon.  
The order was placed with Graham Cook, Goldman Sachs' International Desk,  in 
Chicago.  Daivd also gave him the name and number of Vijay in Hong Kong.
We are working with Lauren and Sara to get an account set up to settle the 
trade for Enron India LLC.  
Please do not hesitate to call if questions.

Hi David & Sheila,

As you will see from the DASH that Rajesh Agarwal is separately faxing to 
you, Rediff.com India Limited is issuing American Depository Shares (ADSs)

As discussed, we would like to bid for $ 4 mn equivalent at the clearing 
price, subject to a maximum price of $12 per ADS. This works out to approx. 
333,333 shares - however if the clearing price is lower, then we would get a 
higher number of shares.

We would appreciate it if you could put in a word to your contact at Goldman 
to let them know that the order is coming in.

Our contact in Goldman Sachs, Hong Kong is Vijay Karnani: +852 2978 1685 (W),

Sara,
Maybe every other week.... or when we have a specific agenda item we want to 
cover in between (e.g. debt confirmations).
I would include Laurel who is probably impacted more than anyone.

initial view will include Master Swap Agreements and I am working on "Other

note, do you think we should schedule a regular [weekly] meeting to review

Sara,
Equity Trading has started a new executing broker relationship with Jeffries 
in Dallas.  They are an OTC Market Maker in names we are interested in. They 
have flow and research in the names we want to trade.
I have requested them to send an Executing Broker Agreement and I will 
forward when we get it.

Sara,

I have drafted the attached based on what we did for the GDR acquisition.  
Could you check the non-India trading names and titles to make sure they are 
current.  I checked with Samantha but she said she was having computer 
problems and wasn't familiar with the names.  And, obviously, we will not 
have this done by Monday morning.  Is there anything we can do to get the 
account opened on an expedited basis and then follow up with paperwork later?



Lena,

Once Sara checks the non-India names, may I have your permission to put your 
initials on these documents and get them signed?

Thanks,
Lauren

I spoke with Eugenie Sibeud at Goldman Sachs who is a local market expert.  
She spoke with someone from Hong Kong.

Per Eugenie, We probably do not need an FII (which takes the 9 months to 
obtain) but we will probably need a FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) Form to 
sell the shares.  This form needs to be approved by RBI (Royal Bank of India) 
taking approximately 3 weeks and is good for a specified period of time (e.g. 
3 months). 

She said that we may be able to complete the sale by opening a cash account 
with Standard Charter Bank (GSs agent) or a special purpose account which 
would stay open only for a month.
Eugenie is going to get back to me and forward to me the specifics which I 
have tried to summarize above.
Thanks. Sheila.

Per discussion with David, Theresa and myself this morning, we have agreed 
that the current most effective approach is for Trena/Jeff K. to do the 
executions for London Credit.com and for Equity/Debt Trading to do the 
settlements.

The trades will be executed in the name of London Credit.com.  We need to set 
up a Morgan Stanley account in the name of London Credit.com to facilitate 
settlements.  

We contacted Ketan Parekh, Morgan Stanley, VP, Prime Brokerage, to discuss 
the impact of housing the account in NY vs. Morgan Stanley London.  Ketan 
said that they have many clients that are settling activity from Europe in 
their NY prime brokerage accounts with no problems.  Since the NY and London 
would be different settlement streams and in light of the current anticipated 
activity, we are requesting we open an account in Morgan Stanley NY.  

Sara, David suggested that Paul Simons would be the contact for account 
opening information.

Please do not hesitate to call if questions.
Thanks. Sheila

Alan,
I spoke with Jeff on Tuesday regarding the overseas vehicle and where we want 
to proceed.   Jeff suggested that we document the current understanding based 
upon all the work which has been done to date.  

We are awaiting Goldman, Sach's preferential margining treatment of Short 
proceeds against longs in our current structure which would lessen the 
benefits of moving overseas at this time. 

Let me know your thoughts.
Thanks., Sheila

Carlos, 
This confirms our discussion this morning that CSFB will wire 17,539,200.25 
GBP to Enron Investments PLC's account at Morgan Stanley.  Enron Investments 
PLC will then receive 6 million shares DVP.  This provides the best trail for 
the transaction.  Settlement will be on Tuesday, 30/5/2000.  

Laurel Adams will e-mail you instructions for wiring funds to the Morgan 
Stanley account.  Please provide to her settlement instructions for the 
shares.
Laurel's direct number is 713-853-7035.

Thanks. Sheila

I send the request, dated 6/2/00, to Morgan Stanley to Contribute the shares

account for EDIDE is open.  Kelly has forwarded a copy to you.  

My understanding from Susan is that they are awaiting registration materials 
from you.  Please let me know when Legal can expect to receive these.

Subject: Re: Contacts

Sheila, as discussed yesterday, I need to do the following:

Open a brokerage account at Morgan Stanley for Enron de Inversiones de 
Energia S.C.A. (an Argentine company) (EDIDE)
This account will hold ADRs that will be contributed or transferred into its 
account by Enron Pipeline Company-Argentina S.A.  (EPCA)(account #038-088357) 
at Morgan Stanley.
EPCA will contribute 431,300 ADRs in Transportadora Gas del Sur (TGS) into 
EDIDE's new account.  That contribution represents the capital contribution 
that EPCA is obligated to make under the capital increase resolution dated 
February 20th, 2000.
After the ADR's are transferred into EDIDE's accounts, EDIDE will need to 
convert such ADR's into ordinary Class B shares in TGS so that they can be 
registered accordingly in Argentina.

Sheila, I am forwarding a hard copy of this e-mail with appropriate support 
(corporate resolutions authorizing me to open this account, resolution 
authorizing the increase in capital and some forms that I had Eduardo 
Ojea-Quintana (President of EDIDE) sign).

Please review and advise of what else you need to finalize this transaction.

Best Regards,

RFR

Sara,
I spoke with Gary regarding the clearing of this CSFB activity.  I have also 
spoken with Kathleen Goss, CSFB, to clarify the use of these different 
agreements.  
The Executing Broker Agreement, includes the "give-up" to another clearing 
broker.  That is, we may choose to execute through CSFB but Clear through our 
existing agreements with Prudential and Carr.  
The Clearing Agreement, is our abiltiy is for  CSFB to clear the 
transaction.  Gary does want to put this in place.
The PrimeTrade License Agreement is specifically for the electronic Trading.

CSFB is forwarding the other two agreements, Executing and Clearing,  to me 
and I will forward them to legal.
Thanks Sheila

Sara, We need to send back to them with the agreements the fee schedule.  I 
will forward a copy to you.
Thanks, Sheila

Sara, Ted,
CSFB has a new electronic access trading system for futures. 
Financial Trading, Enron North America, wants to establish a relationship to 
support this trading.  

To Trade Electronically, ENA will need a Standard Execution Agreement 
(Executing Broker) and a "Prime Trade" Agreement which supports the 
electronic trading.  
Financial Trading is still assessing whether we need a Give-up agreement with 
CSFB or will utilitze our current relationships with Carr and Prudential to 
hold the positions.  I have confirmed with Bob Klein that noone at Enron 
currently trades futures with CSFB.  
Trading will include Futures including, S&P, Nasdaq, Fixed Income (bonds, 
eurodollars) and Forex.

Hi David & Sheila,

As you will see from the DASH that Rajesh Agarwal is separately faxing to 
you, Rediff.com India Limited is issuing American Depository Shares (ADSs)

As discussed, we would like to bid for $ 4 mn equivalent at the clearing 
price, subject to a maximum price of $12 per ADS. This works out to approx. 
333,333 shares - however if the clearing price is lower, then we would get a 
higher number of shares.

We would appreciate it if you could put in a word to your contact at Goldman 
to let them know that the order is coming in.

Our contact in Goldman Sachs, Hong Kong is Vijay Karnani: +852 2978 1685 (W), 
+852 9188 3719 (M), vijay.karnani@gs.com

Our contact information is :

Sara,
Last week we spoke about a process to make sure we have Broker Agreements in 
place.
I spoke with John last week.  We will initiate the following immediately. 
 When we utilize a new executing broker, John will provide to us the name for 
entry into the middle office system and Kelly Templeton will follow up with 
the executing broker to get a customer agreement from the broker and forward 
to you in Legal for review.  
Kelly is currently following up with Hambrecht & Quist and Thomas Weisel 
Partners.  

John and I also discussed the level of risk related to different broker 
relationships and the required documentation:
Executing Broker: We do not have an account open with the broker nor do we 
hold positons .  We only have a trade settlement risk.
OTC Activity:  An ISDA agreement should be in place to cover the derivative 
activity.
Service Agreements: Instinet, Posit
Prime Broker/Futures Account:  Hold postions and dollars in account

Yes, please keep me in mind during the audit process.

Hi Sara,

I met with accounting regarding these amounts. I will be forwarding a copy to 
you.

We have a total of .77 cents remaining in our account with Cargill.

Since we have several acounts in addition to Crude Oil, it is my 
recommendation that
we do not cancel the account as traders may want to utilize Cargill for other 
commodities.

Regards,
David

Cargill said that we do not have a line of credit nor do we have money 
sitting in an account with them.
The account is inactive at this time.

Let's review our next step when you have an opportunity.

Sara,
 I have received a faxed copy from Merrill Lynch for prime brokerage 
clearance services agreement.  They are asking us to fill out the form and 
return to them.  We have reviewed our current listing of executing brokers 
and found that Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner and Smith has already been 
established.  Do you know when the executing broker agreement with Merrill 
was signed so I can forward this information to them?

Thanks,
Theresa

Subject: Re: Contacts

Sheila, as discussed yesterday, I need to do the following:

Open a brokerage account at Morgan Stanley for Enron de Inversiones de 
Energia S.C.A. (an Argentine company) (EDIDE)
This account will hold ADRs that will be contributed or transferred into its 
account by Enron Pipeline Company-Argentina S.A.  (EPCA)(account #038-088357) 
at Morgan Stanley.
EPCA will contribute 431,300 ADRs in Transportadora Gas del Sur (TGS) into 
EDIDE's new account.  That contribution represents the capital contribution 
that EPCA is obligated to make under the capital increase resolution dated 
February 20th, 2000.
After the ADR's are transferred into EDIDE's accounts, EDIDE will need to 
convert such ADR's into ordinary Class B shares in TGS so that they can be 
registered accordingly in Argentina.

Sheila, I am forwarding a hard copy of this e-mail with appropriate support 
(corporate resolutions authorizing me to open this account, resolution 
authorizing the increase in capital and some forms that I had Eduardo 
Ojea-Quintana (President of EDIDE) sign).

Please review and advise of what else you need to finalize this transaction.

Best Regards,

RFR

Damian -

Actually we will need a set of agreements for both entities:

Enron North America Corp.
and
ECT Investments, Inc.

as both do equity trading. I have doublechecked and we did agreements for
both entities when negotiating the US - GS & Co. documents.

With regard to the signature page, can you just duplicate it and make one
for Enron North America Corp.?

Please call if you have any questions (713-853-9477). Thanks!

Shari

Sara,

Are you going to be handling the opening of a bond custody account?  Shari 
had reviewed a bunch of paperwork related to opening one at Bank of New York, 
and Carol St. Clair had done some work on opening one with Chase Tx.  Are you 
at all familiar with either of these.  I think we are meeting at 4pm at 
Sheila's desk to discuss these agreements, although based on your email, I am 
guessing you won't be able to come down....

Everybody

Further to the sell-down of Sutton Bridge it looks like the originators are 
planning, as part of that deal to assign infinity deal number 25556, a 
currency swap we have with Sutton Bridge to EDF/London Electricity.  The 
hedge for this deal is a back to back deal with Natwest, infinity deal number 
25555.

My questions are:
When this swap was originally entered into there would have been a credit 
reserve taken for it, which will have to be released.  How much is this and 
what is the process?  I am assuming this release of credit will not effect my 
traders P&L.  Can you please confirm this.

What else do we need to look at to complete this assignment?  What are the 
legal implications?


The originator is looking to do this fairly quickly and so a quick response 
would be greatly appreciated.


Thanks
Trena

Subject: Re: Contacts

Sheila, as discussed yesterday, I need to do the following:

Open a brokerage account at Morgan Stanley for Enron de Inversiones de 
Energia S.C.A. (an Argentine company) (EDIDE)
This account will hold ADRs that will be contributed or transferred into its 
account by Enron Pipeline Company-Argentina S.A.  (EPCA)(account #038-088357) 
at Morgan Stanley.
EPCA will contribute 431,300 ADRs in Transportadora Gas del Sur (TGS) into 
EDIDE's new account.  That contribution represents the capital contribution 
that EPCA is obligated to make under the capital increase resolution dated 
February 20th, 2000.
After the ADR's are transferred into EPCA's accounts, EPCA will need to 
convert such ADR's into ordinary Class B shares in TGS so that they can be 
registered accordingly in Argentina.

Sheila, I am forwarding a hard copy of this e-mail with appropriate support 
(corporate resolutions authorizing me to open this account, resolution 
authorizing the increase in capital and some forms that I had Eduardo 
Ojea-Quintana (President of EDIDE) sign).

Please review and advise of what else you need to finalize this transaction.

Best Regards,

RFR

We are having difficulty in getting Executing Broker Agreements in place with

calling your contact and getting the name of a legal person Sara can talk to.
Thomas Weisel has never called Sara back and for Hambrecht & Quest we sent

We are going to use 76-0486649 for the tax id for Enron Distribution 
Ventures.  This is the number of Atlantic Commercial Finance, Inc., the 
parent of Enron Distribution Ventures.  See tax department e-mail traffic 
below.  If the brokerage firm has a problem with this, I guess we will need 
to put our tax people in touch with their legal department.  We can't undo 
our tax treatment just to satisfy the brokerage firm.

The answer was pretty straight forward, a disregarded entity uses the 
Employer ID# of is single-member owner, in this case ACFI (Federal ID #:  
76-0486649).  Fortunately, Cullen is a walking/talking tax code ... he amazes

Enron India LLC (EILLC) is a 'disregarded' sub of Atlantic Commercial 
Finance, Inc. (ACFI).  Both are US entities.
EILLC has today opened a US brokerage account and was asked to furnish its 
EIN on form W-9, Request for Txpr ID#.  

Query:  Do any of you have prior experience with determining whether EILLC 
can simply supply the EIN of ACFI or whether EILLC must apply for its own 
EIN?  If yes, how was your issue resolved?

Annette Glod will check with the Service tomorrow and will be glad to report 
back to this group with the answer.

Is there any way for Goldman to trade through a Bombay broker to sell the 
shares?  Is Enron Distribution Ventures MHC authorized to trade on the Bombay 
exchange?  This deal is going to be a challenge to sort through some of the 
issues.  We have one group in Enron that should be trading equities for the 
Enron companies and I am trying to determine how, given the issues listed 
below, we can accomplish this.  Is it an alternative  to set up a broker 
account in India and have one of the traders from the equity trading group  
listed as authorized to execute trades on behalf of EDV MHC.  I am not 
familiar with India law so the lawyers will need to verify that the entity is 
authorized to trade on the exchange.    What is the time frame on wanting to 
sell the shares?  Donna

Proceeds from sale of Genesys shares must be routed through a Mauritius bank 
account of Enron Distribution Ventures MHC.  This is important to maintaining 
EDV's Mauritius tax residency and therefore qualifying for exemption from 
India capital gains tax under the Indo/Mauritius Treaty.

Subject: Re: Genesys  


A brief background on the company is provided below to answer the questions 
raised:

Genesys International Corporation Limited is an Indian company. It was listed 
on Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) on Monday June 6, 2000 and is traded on the B2 
group on the  (BSE) under ticker code 6109.  We have purchased 190,000 shares 
at Rs. 225 per share (total of Rs. 42.75 million). (The site for the BSE is 
www.bseindia.com.)

1) The shares are owned by Enron Distribution Ventures MHC Limited (Mauritius 
Based). The physical share certificates are with Enron India in a vault in 
a     bank
2) There is no lock up restriction on the shares purchased by us and we are 
free to sell these shares.
3) I am not clear on the materal non-public information and who would need to 
give the certification. Could you clarify where the requirement for the 
certification arises, and send me a copy of the form of the certificate.
4) We would need a broker in India who is authorised to deal on the BSE to 
execute the transactions, A person acting on behalf of Enron Distribution 
Ventures  MHC Limited Mauritius would need to enter into the relevant 
agreements and authorisations
5) I do not think that Goldman Sachs would be able to sell these shares on 
our behalf on the BSE as we would need a broker here in India to execute the 
deal

Under Indian Regulations, the proceeds from the sale of shares on behalf of 
the foriegn company needs to be deposited in a rupee bank account and then 
can be onward remitted to Enron Distribution Ventures MHC Limited account. 
The bank has the responsibility of carrying out the due diligence for 
adherence to the current Reserve Baank of India rules regarding sale of 
shares in the Indian Market by an overseas company.

I hope that I have provided the relevant information required. In addition, I 
have enclosed a copy of the DASH for your reference.

Donna : Would request you to advise us on how to proceed further on this one.

Subject: Re: Genesys  

I have several questions:

1.  Where are the private shares held and in what name?
2. Is there a lock up agreement on our ability to sell our shares after the 
IPO?
3. Does anybody have material non-public info on the company and if not, I 
will need a certification from such people to that effect.
4.  Who is going to be responsible for executing broker agreements & 
preparing corporate resolutions, trading authorizations etc.
5.  Morgan Stanley will not be able to clear the trade, however, Goldman 
Sachs will be able.  We need account information necessary to set it up such 
as name, TIN etc.  John Greene in Kinnemans shop will be actually placing the 
trades and he needs to be listed with trading authorization.  

Before anything can be sold, we need to get the back office stuff set up 
properly. so whoever has appropriate info, please contact me asap.  Thanks

Subbu,
Thanks for the information.
This type of transaction has to go through our securities trading process.  
The first stop is Donna Lowry.  She must be involved in any transaction of 
this type.  She is on e-mail or you can reach her by phone at 713 853 1939.  
She will then direct you to a trader in Jeff Kinneman's group.  Current 
policy is that all market trades must be done through Jeff Kinneman's group.
Generally, Morgan Stanley is used as the custodian.  Their ability to provide 
services for India needs to be sorted out quickly.  Work this out with Donna 
and the trading group.
This will have to move quickly to meet your timeframe.  Please contact Donna 
right away.
Mary

FYI - if you recall, a bank account was not opened for Enron Distribution 
Ventures in Mauritius.  The funds were sent directly by its owner.  Can the 
proceeds of the sale go this way too or do we now need a Mauritius account?  
Let's try to avoid it if we can - let me know.

Hi,

Lena has directed me to you for the documentation required for the 
belowmentioned account opening. We need this account for efffecting the sale 
of the Genesys shares in the secondary market under the existing GoI 
regulations.

A suggestion I have is that in case the Mauritius venture has an account with 
a bank which has an Indian arm, we can open the account with the same bank in 
India as this would save us some trouble while remitting the funds back to 
the Mauritius venture.

I need your urgent help on this one as the shares get listed on Monday and we 
may want to sell some by Tuesday/Wednesday

Thanks and Regards

I have received a couple of forms from Morgan Stanley Dean Witter re Enron 
Investments Plc. They have asked that we sign and return to them a form W-8, 
"Certificate of Foreign Status", and also a form 1001, "Ownership, Exemption, 
or Reduced Rate Certificate".

These forms are in respect of a bank account number 038112215, which we have 
no record of here. Could you please let me know if you have any details of 
this account so that I can fill in the forms if appropriate. We only have 30 
days to complete and return the forms from the date the account opened, after 
which it is likely that any interest earned on the account will be subject to 
withholding tax.

thank you for your help.

Sara and Ann,
I have spoken with Morgan Stanley regarding opening up an account for Enron 
Investments PLC which is a  UK based company, and will receive UK shares on 
Settlement date, Tuesday, 5/30.  

We would like to have DVP delivery at Morgan on 5/30.  Therefore, we will

Everybody

Further to the sell-down of Sutton Bridge it looks like the originators are 
planning, as part of that deal to assign infinity deal number 25556, a 
currency swap we have with Sutton Bridge to EDF/London Electricity.  The 
hedge for this deal is a back to back deal with Natwest, infinity deal number 
25555.

My questions are:
When this swap was originally entered into there would have been a credit 
reserve taken for it, which will have to be released.  How much is this and 
what is the process?  I am assuming this release of credit will not effect my 
traders P&L.  Can you please confirm this.

What else do we need to look at to complete this assignment?  What are the 
legal implications?


The originator is looking to do this fairly quickly and so a quick response 
would be greatly appreciated.


Thanks
Trena

Below is the response that we received from our Agent.  Please call me at
(2120 902-1930 with any questions that you may have.


This has reference to our telecon. Enclosed is the relevant RBI regulation
for the captioned company (ABC) to sell its stake in the local company. To
effect the sale, ABC would require an approval from Reserve Bank of India
(RBI) even though the stock is listed. The documentation required varies
depending on whether the stock is thinly traded or actively traded. RBI's
definition of thinly traded is included in the regulation.

The company is required to fill out Form TS1 (I  am enclosing the format)
and submit this to RBI. In addition, the RBI requires certain documents
which are detailed in the form itself.

Trust this helps. Any other information that you require, please do not
hesitate to get in touch.

Sara,
May I have a copy of the Morgan Stanley Prime Broker Agreement and the 
Overseas Lending Agreement.
Jeff and I have been talking to Goldman Sachs about a similar arrangement and 
wanted to re-review the Morgan Stanley structure.

Sara,

Org chart attached.

Per conversation with Jeff Kinneman who was in London this week, London Credt 
Trading will be trading in Bank default swaps .  The name of the entity is 
still to be determined.  Jeff will be authorized to execute trades for the 
entity and the trades will be in the name of the entity and not back-to-back 
with our books.

Sheung,
I am resending this e-mail to you.
As soon as we have an account number for EDIDE we will give you a letter to 
transfer Shares as a contribution from EPCA  to EDIDE.
We will send a separate letter for instructions for EDIDE to convert the ADRs 
to ordinary Class B Shares.
Thanks. Sheila

Subject: Re: Contacts

Sheila, as discussed yesterday, I need to do the following:

Open a brokerage account at Morgan Stanley for Enron de Inversiones de 
Energia S.C.A. (an Argentine company) (EDIDE)
This account will hold ADRs that will be contributed or transferred into its 
account by Enron Pipeline Company-Argentina S.A.  (EPCA)(account #038-088357) 
at Morgan Stanley.
EPCA will contribute 431,300 ADRs in Transportadora Gas del Sur (TGS) into 
EDIDE's new account.  That contribution represents the capital contribution 
that EPCA is obligated to make under the capital increase resolution dated 
February 20th, 2000.
After the ADR's are transferred into EDIDE's accounts, EDIDE will need to 
convert such ADR's into ordinary Class B shares in TGS so that they can be 
registered accordingly in Argentina.

Sheila, I am forwarding a hard copy of this e-mail with appropriate support 
(corporate resolutions authorizing me to open this account, resolution 
authorizing the increase in capital and some forms that I had Eduardo 
Ojea-Quintana (President of EDIDE) sign).

Please review and advise of what else you need to finalize this transaction.

Best Regards,

RFR
