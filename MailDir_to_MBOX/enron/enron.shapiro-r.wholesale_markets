The Commission approved the NYISO's AMP proposal for Summer 2001, expiring on 
October 31, 2001.  The Commission acknowledges problems with the proposal, 
such as  1) the AMP may mitigate bids when market power was not the cause of 
the high bid,  and 2) generators will not have a chance to explain their bids 
prior to mitigation.  Nevertheless, FERC still approves the proposal, 
justifying its actions by saying that the proposal is only temporary.

The Commission notes that, while it prefers more limited automatic mitigation 
procedures (where market power mitigation is tied to structural market power 
problems), it will accept the NY proposal for this summer because NY is 
concerned that supplies will be tight and demand response may not be 
effective.

A copy of  the order is attached.  Please let us know if you have any 
questions.

We had a good visit with the FERC staff yesterday.  Their questions primarily 
focused on the business aspects of EOL (for example, how the different 
business units of trading and accounting/back office interface with the 
software and engineering aspects of EOL).  The attorney had two outstanding 
questions:

1.  What regulations govern EOL or the trades done on EOL?
2.  What types of internal controls are in place with regard to risk 
management of Enron's gas and power trading.  For example, what is the 
ability of Enron to take a position that could potentially affect the 
industry as a whole?

We plan to coordinate a possible call to the FERC attorney by regarding the 
regulation question.  In addition, Steve Kean plans to coordinate a call to 
the attorney with Rick Buy (or other appropriate risk management personnel.)

The Southeast RTO:=20
The "Backstory" Behind the Press Release=20

By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis=20

[IMAGE]Owners of transmission systems across Alabama, Florida, Georgia,=20
Mississippi, and South Carolina have announced the signing of a memorandum =
of=20
understanding (MOU) to develop a regional transmission organization (RTO) f=
or=20
the Southeast. A full list of the Southeast RTO members appears at the end =
of=20
this article. Two of the largest members of this new organization are=20
Southern Company (NYSE: SO) and Santee Cooper. If the transmission owners=
=20
prove successful in their efforts to develop this transmission entity, the=
=20
RTO would be one of the nation's largest, covering more than 39,000 miles o=
f=20
transmission with an investment in assets in excess of $6 billion.=20

Analysis: The dynamics behind this announcement create a backstory that is=
=20
not readily available in the press materials being circulated by Southern=
=20
Company. However, the development of this much-anticipated RTO illustrates=
=20
how transmission infrastructure in the Southeast is assimilating, answers=
=20
questions about how Southern Company will comply with federal directives, a=
nd=20
raises speculation about possible impact on the region's already-establishe=
d=20
RTO, GridSouth. Further, as FERC has encouraged RTOs to form across the=20
country, much of the commission's focus has been placed on the Southeastern=
=20
United States (along with the West). The Southeast is dominated by large IO=
Us=20
that control massive transmission assets. Thus, seeing that Southeastern=20
transmission systems are ultimately conjoined has been a key priority for=
=20
FERC.=20

You may recall that a few months ago Southern Company applied to FERC to fo=
rm=20
its own RTO (the organization that will manage a transmission network withi=
n=20
a particular region). FERC rejected the SeTrans Gridco concept because=20
Southern Company planned to funnel certain rate incentives to companies oth=
er=20
than the RTO operator, which violated FERC policy. In addition, it is FERC'=
s=20
general policy to consolidate operating RTOs across the country, and the=20
commission was concerned that Southern Company would remain too autonomous =
if=20
it was the only utility involved in a transmission entity. Thus, FERC=20
unequivocally told Southern Company to not re-apply for RTO status until it=
=20
had explored joining forces with neighboring companies.=20

Simultaneously, FERC gave conditional approval to GridSouth, an RTO formed =
by=20
Carolina Power & Light, Duke Energy and South Carolina Electric & Gas=20
(SCANA), Southern Company's neighbors to the north. The conditional approva=
l=20
came with the instruction that GridSouth should engage in dialogue with the=
=20
SeTrans Gridco, Santee Cooper and Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) about=20
joining GridSouth. Again, FERC sent the message that it ultimately hopes to=
=20
see a single, large RTO serving the entire Southeast region.=20

Nevertheless, now Southern Company and Santee Cooper have joined forces wit=
h=20
seven other companies to form a new RTO that will be a completely separate=
=20
entity from GridSouth. I contacted GridSouth for a response regarding what=
=20
impact (if any) the formation of the new Southeast RTO might have on=20
GridSouth. However, as of press time, representatives for GridSouth had not=
=20
prepared a public statement regarding the proposed transmission entity. =20

I spoke with John Sell, a Southern Company spokesperson on June 19. Sell=20
informed me that Southern Company had indeed engaged in negotiations with=
=20
GridSouth upon FERC's directive, but determined that GridSouth was "too far=
=20
down the road" in terms of its development, and that Southern Company plann=
ed=20
on taking a different approach toward its transmission assets. For instance=
,=20
while both entities are for-profit operations, the new Southeast RTO plans =
to=20
hire an independent third party to oversee its operations. Further, althoug=
h=20
the term "Southeast RTO" is being used in the press release, Sell told me=
=20
that among the companies involved the RTO is actually being referred to as=
=20
SeTrans (the name of Southern Company's rejected entity). Sell stressed tha=
t=20
the name SeTrans was chosen only because it had been previously established=
=20
by Southern Company and should not be seen as any indication that Southern=
=20
has majority power over the RTO. In fact, the name will be changed to=20
something else later this year.=20

On a related note, one statement that I found particularly interesting in t=
he=20
press release about the new RTO is that "the companies have also made it=20
clear that the process is not being controlled by any individual transmissi=
on=20
owner, but rather all participants will help establish the rules by which=
=20
they will operate and make decisions." This is clearly a veiled reference t=
o=20
Southern Company, which was criticized by FERC for being too autonomous in=
=20
its original RTO filing. When I spoke with John Sell, he volunteered that=
=20
Southern "is not the driver behind this RTO."=20

Santee Cooper's involvement in the SeTrans RTO also came about in a somewha=
t=20
precarious fashion. As noted, FERC specifically asked GridSouth to find a w=
ay=20
to incorporate Santee Cooper, a state-owned utility located in South=20
Carolina, into its RTO. As Santee Cooper controls about 4,200 miles of=20
transmission lines covering 75 percent of South Carolina, it is no wonder=
=20
that the commission would want to make sure that the public utility was=20
conjoined in some way to developing RTOs. There was just one problem with=
=20
this plan: the South Carolina constitution prohibits Santee Cooper from=20
joining for-profit enterprises. =20

The case was closely followed throughout the energy industry as other publi=
c=20
power agencies across the country are also involved in pending negotiations=
=20
to join RTOs. New reports indicate that, if the SeTrans RTO is approved by=
=20
FERC, it will be the largest RTO in the country to include a public power=
=20
entity. However, it is important to note that Desert Star, an RTO based in=
=20
Phoenix that connects transmission assets of seven Western states, includes=
=20
the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA), which owns about one-third of=
=20
the transmission system that serves Colorado and provides power to 28 of 29=
=20
of the state's municipal electric systems. =20

Naturally, as the SeTrans RTO is also classified as a for-profit entity, th=
e=20
question has been raised of how Santee Cooper will be allowed to join as a=
=20
member given the South Carolina law. I spoke with Stephen Pelcher, associat=
e=20
general counsel of rates and regulations for Santee Cooper, about this=20
conundrum. There is an important distinction that should be understood.=20
GridSouth is a wholly owned company under its three utility parents (Caroli=
na=20
Power & Light, Duke and SCANA). The obstacle facing Santee Cooper's=20
participation in GridSouth was that the company could not be a shareholder =
in=20
a private corporation. Under the SeTrans RTO, in which Santee Cooper is now=
 a=20
participant, none of the participating companies will have ownership over t=
he=20
transmission entity. As noted, this was one of Southern Company's main=20
interests in forming its own RTO as the company intends to hire an=20
independent third party to oversee its operations. Pelcher told me that the=
=20
SeTrans RTO is still in a "preliminary stage" and thus it appears at this=
=20
time that participants in the SeTrans RTO will retain ownership of their=20
transmission assets and only turn over operational control to the independe=
nt=20
third party. Interestingly, Pelcher also told me that Santee Cooper (and, b=
y=20
extension, the SeTrans RTO) remains in consultation with GridSouth for a=20
"coordination and implementation service agreement" that would in some way=
=20
interconnect the two entities.=20

One issue that will continue to impact RTOs throughout the country is how=
=20
electricity will be transported across independent transmission systems.=20
Specifically, FERC has been concerned about how power will be traded from o=
ne=20
RTO to another and the possibility that boundaries between two separate RTO=
s=20
could become "speed bumps" in the flow of electricity. In fact, the=20
commission met this week on the issue and continues to formulate policy=20
related to these "seam issues." Part of the reason that Southern Company's=
=20
original, independent RTO plan was rejected was FERC's concern that the=20
utility was resisting efforts to form a cohesive, interconnected system in=
=20
the region. At this point, it appears that FERC favors standardization in h=
ow=20
adjacent RTOs will relate to each other, and thus has instructed developing=
=20
RTOs to consult with each other on seam agreements. FERC reportedly is=20
planning to have a formal policy on the subject ready by the end of this=20
year. Related to the development of this policy is the debate over whether =
or=20
not FERC should take a more active role in forcing consolidation among=20
developing RTOs so that only a limited number of separate entities exist.=
=20

Thus, as the SeTrans RTO continues to grow, it will need to determine how i=
t=20
will be connected to GridSouth and GridFlorida (and any other adjacent RTOs=
).=20
In addition, Southern Company's John Sell disclosed to me that the SeTrans=
=20
RTO has formed an MOU with TVA for a seam agreement. At this point, TVA has=
=20
made no announcement that it is planning to join the new Southeast RTO and =
in=20
fact, as a federal agency, is under no obligation to join an RTO.=20

The SeTrans RTO plans to file an application with FERC and is preparing for=
=20
the commission's deadline of being formed by Dec. 15 of this year. If the=
=20
SeTrans RTO (or whatever it is ultimately called) gains FERC's approval, it=
=20
will represent a significant part of the Southeast's development into a=20
functionally competitive electric market. If FERC's stated policy of=20
consolidating RTOs is effectively applied, ultimately we could see that=20
GridSouth becomes conjoined to this new RTO, which now includes Southern=20
Company, Santee Cooper and (through a seam agreement) TVA. Moreover, the=20
development of the new Southeastern RTO illustrates the complexities of=20
conjoining companies that transcend federal, state and municipal levels,=20
along with the challenges of ensuring that adjacent RTOs form synergistic=

Supreme Court Grants Review of FERC Order No. 888

Earlier last week, the United States Supreme Court granted two petitions for
certiorari to review the D.C. Circuit's decision in Transmission Access
Study Group v. FERC, 225 F.3d 667 (2000) regarding FERC Order No. 888, which
required open-access and non-discriminatory transmission service.  The
Supreme Court has agreed to review legal challenges set forth in separate
petitions filed by several states led by New York and Enron Power Marketing.


The issue the multi-state petition presents for review is whether FERC may
preempt state jurisdiction over energy transmitted from generators to retail
customers in the same state.  The Court also granted Enron's petition to
consider two far-reaching questions with major implications for the power
industry: (1) does FERC have jurisdiction to regulate all transmission in
interstate commerce, including transmission for bundled retail sales; and
(2) does the Federal Power Act obligate FERC to eliminate undue
discrimination by requiring transmission-owning utilities to provide service
on the same terms to all users, including bundled retail sales?

The Court has joined the two petitions for purposes of oral argument and
decision.  Oral arguments in the two cases will not be scheduled before

Utilities, FERC At Odds Over RTO Plans 

By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis 

[News item from Energy Info Source] According to a new report from Energy 
Info Source, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has begun to 
articulate a position regarding regional transmission organizations (RTOs). 
With several approvals, a rejection and ordering changes to another RTO 
application, FERC is shaping RTO participation among investor-owned 
utilities. 

Analysis: The Energy Info Source report makes several conclusions regarding 
current approaches that FERC is taking with regard to pending RTO 
applications, based on decisions that the commission has made up to this 
point. According to Energy Info Source, FERC has concentrated its efforts on 
the Southeast and Western regions. Within the Southeast, FERC has essentially 
rejected Southern Company's SeTrans Gridco, while conditionally approving 
GridSouth and Grid Florida. In the West, the RTO West application-which 
represents an alliance among nine utilities-appears to have received FERC's 
favor and "is the preeminent leader among non-ISO RTO participation efforts." 
However, despite these established trends, FERC still remains at odds with 
many of the leading transmission owners in the nation, which foresee a 
potential conflict between the commission's rulemaking on transmission rates 
and its potential impact on retail rates, which are regulated by individual 
states.  

For background, an RTO is a regional entity that is designed to consolidate 
control and delivery of electricity across various types of transmission 
systems within a particular region. The origins of FERC's RTO policy dates 
back to its December 1999 Order 2000, in which it strongly encouraged all 
transmission-owning utilities to submit plans for joining or forming an RTO 
by Oct. 15, 2000, with actual membership established by December of this 
year. FERC is now sorting through the applications that it has received, and 
its approvals or rejections illuminate certain preferences that some members 
of the commission hold. Over the last year or two, FERC has engaged in an 
ongoing debate between its preference for transco (for-profit) models for 
RTOs, as opposed to independent system operators (non-profit). Chairman Curt 
H&eacutebert has been the most vocal supporter of the transco model, while 
other commissioners such as William Massey have supported ISOs. However, 
moving forward, it is becoming increasingly clear that FERC also seems to 
have other set agendas for how it wants the network of RTOs to operate, 
including the limit of one entity per region. 

As noted, FERC appears to be focusing on applications submitted for the 
Southeast and Western regions. In addition to the obvious need to establish 
stability in the West, another explanation for the commission's dual focus is 
that other regions in the United States (namely, the Midwest and the 
Northeast) already have successfully operating RTOs such as the New York ISO, 
the Alliance RTO and the Midwest ISO. FERC may be focusing on the West and 
Southeast as these are the two regions that arguably have not yet established 
an acceptable level of market independence. 

The Western region contains three separate RTO proposals that are pending 
before FERC. The RTO West, which FERC has referred to as the "anchor" of the 
region, has been generally accepted as a "broad concept." RTO West includes 
nine large transmission operators that are primarily located in the Pacific 
Northwest (Avista, Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), Idaho Power, 
Montana Power, PacifiCorp, Portland General Electric, Puget Sound Energy, and 
the Sierra Pacific units Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific Power). BPA is by 
far the largest of the RTO West members, controlling about 75 percent of the 
transmission system in the region. For the most part, RTO West is an ISO, 
although six of the nine utilities included in this operation have also 
applied to create a transco that would operate under the RTO West umbrella. 
The second western RTO is Desert Star, which includes utilities that are 
located in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas. The third proposed RTO 
for the Western region is the California ISO, which has been operational 
since April 1998 and wishes to remain a stand-alone entity. 

FERC's main point of contention with regard to the Western region is its 
desire for one RTO in the area, instead of three. The primary rationale for 
this position stems from a philosophical belief that one regional RTO will be 
more easily managed than multiple entities. In addition, gaming by power 
generators could more likely occur with multiple RTOs, which would require 
additional market rules to control the gaming (FERC's general approach has 
been to reduce rather than increase the amount of market rules needed). The 
California ISO has tweaked the commission's patience in particular, as this 
solo entity has steadfastly resisted any federal efforts to make it join 
other entities. The commission recently agreed to impose wholesale price caps 
in California whenever reserves fall below 7.5 percent. This has been 
something that the state has long requested, but the price caps come with the 
condition that California must file an application by June 1 to enter into an 
RTO with other Western states. Otherwise, the price caps will be lifted. 
California is currently contesting this condition. 

Under the leadership of Chairman H&eacutebert, it is clearly FERC's goal to 
establish only one RTO for the entire Western region, which puts the federal 
agency at odds with the California government once again. The Department of 
Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham shares H&eacutebert's belief that one 
regional RTO is the best strategy for the West, but also has said that 
proceeding without California for the time being may be necessary to get the 
new organization up and running. Other western governors have stood in unity 
that FERC should issue a decision on the three RTOs presently and postpone 
its effort to force a single western RTO for the time being. 

Across the country, there are similar issues facing the RTOs in the 
Southeast. For instance, Chairman H&eacutebert's preference for minimal RTOs 
within one region appears to be a national viewpoint. Yet, there are unique 
questions related to the formation of Southeast RTOs that have not emerged in 
the West. The status in the Southeast is that FERC has approved GridFlorida 
RTO-which includes Florida Power & Light, Florida Power Corp. and Tampa 
Electric-and GridSouth RTO, which includes Progress Energy, Duke Energy and 
South Carolina Electric & Gas. However, FERC rejected Southern Company's 
SeTrans GridCo because the gridco planned to funnel certain rate incentives 
to companies other than the RTO operator, which violated FERC policy. The 
commission not only rejected SeTransGridCo, but told Southern Company not to 
re-apply and to "explore joining neighboring utilities in an RTO." In 
addition, FERC only gave conditional approval to the Southwest Power Pool / 
Entergy Hybrid RTO because many of its members have not formally turned over 
control of their generation assets. The rejection and conditional approval 
from FERC, which followed the approvals of GridFlorida and GridSouth, have 
been perceived as a message from the commission that remaining utilities in 
the region should join the already-approved entities. In fact, FERC 
reportedly gave approval to GridSouth only with the agreement that it would 
engage in dialogue with Tennessee Valley Authority, Santee Cooper and SeTrans 
GridCo so that they might also join. Some reports indicate that, because the 
Southeast region does not presently have an ISO model (such as the one in 
California), FERC has high hopes for molding the region in accordance with 
its own long-term goals, which include a single RTO for the area. 

Nevertheless, despite receiving approval from FERC, GridSouth is taking issue 
with two aspects of the commission's approval. First, GridSouth questions 
FERC's jurisdiction over bundled retail service, and specifically wants the 
commission to determine whether or not it will exert control over bundled 
transmission rates. GridSouth is concerned that FERC is pushing for a 
contract with the approved RTO that would put retail rates, including the 
charge for transmission service, under FERC jurisdiction, which would allow 
the commission to change the rates in the future. FERC's Order 888, which 
essentially outlined electric deregulation in the United States, clearly 
states that FERC does not have jurisdiction over bundled retail service. 
GridSouth has asked for a rehearing of its RTO proposal in which FERC would 
agree to GridSouth's interpretation of state jurisdiction over bundled 
transmission rates.  

Despite these isolated disputes, the formation of RTOs across the United 
States appears to be coming together. While the industry awaits for further 
FERC action on pending RTO applications, it is clear that certain trends are 
emerging. FERC's long-standing preference for the transco model over the ISO 
model appears to be diminishing, as evidenced by the commission's approval of 
RTO West and apparent support of non-profit operations such as the New York 
ISO and the Midwest ISO. Rather, FERC has demonstrated a more primary 
preference for solitary RTO entities within a region, regardless of whether 
the entity operates as a transco or an ISO. From a philosophical perspective, 
establishing one RTO rather than several within a particular region arguably 
will help to reduce certain inefficiencies that might result from multiple 
entities. Further, a single RTO entity may help to avoid certain inter-tie 
problems that could occur between multiple RTOs within a region. However, it 
will be no easy task for FERC to convince utilities that are involved in 
independent RTOs (such as California) to relinquish their autonomy and join 
forces with other utilities that may have divergent philosophies regarding 
the operation of a transmission system.

Another victory at FERC!

Although Enron did not file a protest in this docket, nor was a signatory t=

against the proposed change to OASIS (first to confirm after scheduling=20

One of the main arguments I made at NERC and a chief reason why FERC denied=

the request is cited in the order:

"Dynegy/Coral argues that the proposed standard addresses the problem of=20

       System (OASIS) and Standards of           Docket No. RM95-9-013
       Conduct


     ORDER DENYING REQUEST FOR EXPERIMENTAL BUSINESS PRACTICE STANDARD

                           (Issued June 29, 2001)

          We will deny the request from the Market Interface Committee

     of the North American Electric Reliability Council (MIC) for

     expedited approval of its proposed experiment on the treatment of

     unconfirmed requests for daily, firm transmission service, for

     the reasons stated below.

     BACKGROUND

          On May 29, 2001, the MIC filed a request to modify the

     Commission's OASIS Business Practice Standards adopted in Order
             1
     No. 638,  to add a new business practice standard dealing with

     accepted daily, firm point-to-point transmission service that has

     not been confirmed and to modify a related footnote to Table 4-2

     on Reservation Timing Limits.  The MIC requests that the

     Commission implement this proposal on a mandatory, experimental

     basis for six months beginning no later than June 30, 2001.  The

     MIC further states that, within four months of the effective

     date, it will provide the Commission with an assessment of the

               1
                Open Access Same-Time Information System and Standards of
          Conduct, Order No. 638, FERC Stats. & Regs., Regulations
          Preambles 1996-2000 =0F4 31,092 (2000).







          Docket No. RM95-9-013     -2-

     experiment and whether it should be revised, discontinued, or

     made permanent.

          On June 5, 2001, the Commission issued a notice of filing

     and request for comments regarding the MIC filing.  The notice

     gave a brief description of the MIC proposal and invited comments
                                2
     on or before June 11, 2001.   Comments were invited on the MIC

     proposal generally and specifically on whether Commission action

     is needed by June 30, 2001, as requested by the MIC.

          On June 11, 2001, Dynegy Power Marketing, Inc. and Coral

     Power, LLC (collectively "Dynegy/Coral") jointly filed a protest

     opposing the MIC request.

     Dynegy/Coral argue that the MIC proposal should not be granted on

     an expedited basis and that it should be rejected outright.

     Dynegy/Coral's protest was the sole comment filed in response to

     the June 5, 2001 notice and request for comments.

     DISCUSSION

          We will deny the MIC s request for expedited approval of its

     proposed experiment on the treatment of unconfirmed requests for

     daily, firm transmission service for three reasons.  First,

     although the MIC requests expedited approval of its proposed

     experiment, the MIC s proposal presents no reason why expedited

     treatment is needed.  Moreover, although our June 5, 2001 notice

     specifically invited comment on this issue, no comments were

     filed in support of expedited treatment or giving reasons why


               2
                This shortened comment period was used to accommodate the
          MIC's request for action on or before June 30, 2001.







          Docket No. RM95-9-013     -3-

     prompt action is needed.  In fact, Dynegy/Coral s protest, the

     sole comment filed, argued against expedited approval of the

     proposed experiment both because it opposed approval of the

     experiment outright, and because Dynegy/Coral argues that

     implementation during the summer peak period would cause problems

     for customers denied service under the MIC s proposal.  Given the

     absence of a showing of need for expedited treatment, we will

     reject MIC s request for expedited approval of its proposed

     experiment.

          The MIC proposal would allow transmission providers, at

     reservation request deadlines, to retract their prior acceptance

     of unconfirmed customer requests for daily, firm transmission

     service and substitute pending pre-confirmed requests for such

     service, in order of queue time, up to the amount of daily, firm

     available transmission capability remaining.  The proposal

     includes phrases such as, "the transmission provider has the

     right to move to a retracted status" and "after which time that

     request may be retracted."  These phrases do not provide a

     standard for the transmission provider to use in deciding whether

     to retract customers' unconfirmed accepted requests for daily,

     firm point-to-point transmission service.  Careful monitoring

     would be necessary to insure that the proposal is not implemented

     in a discriminatory manner.  A customer whose request for

     transmission service had been accepted would have no way to

     predict whether a transmission provider might choose to retract







          Docket No. RM95-9-013     -4-

     its acceptance, which would make it difficult for the customer to

     make alternative arrangements.

          Dynegy/Coral argues that the proposed standard addresses the

     problem of unused transmission capacity caused by some customers

     not confirming accepted transmission requests, but does not

     address the underlying problem caused by the practice of some

     transmission providers of delaying their acceptance of requests

     for daily, firm transmission service, even when customers submit

     their requests early.  Dynegy/Coral contends this practice puts

     customers in a bind that forces them to make alternative

     arrangements as a protective mechanism.  Dynegy/Coral argues that

     customers should not be punished for taking such precautions,

     even if they result in some unused transmission capacity.

     Dynegy/Coral argues that a better solution to avoid unused

     capacity would be for transmission providers to more uniformly

     respond to requests for daily, firm transmission service on a

     timely basis, rather than by taking the unwarranted step of

     giving greater priority to pre-confirmed service requests.

     Further, Dynegy/Coral argues that the MIC proposal would force

     customers to purchase transmission services they will be unable

     to use.

          We agree with Dynegy/Coral that the MIC proposal does not

     address whether the time period for transmission providers to

     evaluate requests for daily, firm transmission service needs to

     be clarified or shortened and that this is a relevant issue.  If

     transmission providers would all respond to requests for daily,







          Docket No. RM95-9-013     -5-

     firm transmission service on a timely basis, then customers would

     have adequate time to confirm before reservations are scheduled,

     and the MIC's proposed business practice might not be needed.  We

     request that the MIC reconsider its motion in light of the

     concerns raised by Dynegy/Coral.  After considering these issues,

     the MIC may, at its option, make a revised request for an

Rick, Linda and I met with Dan Larcamp (Director of FERC's Office of Markets, 
Tariffs and Rates) yesterday.  He made several comments of interest:

Enron's Position on Market Structure

Dan says he's heard from the Enron traders that they like "PJM."  Dan would 
like us to have one of our traders come up to Washington to meet with his 
staff to talk about what attributes of PJM we really like.  For example:  

 - what brings liquidity
 - what benefits does liquidity bring -- to both Enron and utilities with end 
use customers -- how does    liquidity benefit consumers?
 - why do we support PJM over New York and New England
 - what facilitates trades, reduces transaction costs, gives the right 
signals to generators of where to site 


Gas Pipeline Issues

Dan also talked about his concerns with affiliate issues on the gas side.  He 
said INGAA has not been particularly helpful in the debate -- they disagree 
that changes are needed and do not provide much to the discussion.  Dan said 
he prefers structural changes over Code of Conduct fixes -- he doesn't want 
to have to look under rocks for violators.  He also questioned whether, if 
pipeline executives' compensation is based on the company's profits (through 
options and salary) which are derived in part from trading, whether this 
provides those executives with incentives to favor their affiliates.  

Regulatory Gap

Dan is concerned that there is a regulatory gap between FERC, the CFTC and 
the SEC.  He believes there is a large block of transactions -- primarily 
bookout transactions -- that are not being regulated by FERC or the CFTC.  We 
discussed that there is a physical component to bookouts, but he is still 
concerned that no one is overseeing these transactions.

He also compared FERC to the SEC and said they do not have the expertise or 
staff to provide market monitoring the way the SEC does.  I think FERC has 
been compared to the SEC recently and Dan's comments may have been somewhat 
defensive in response to those comparisons.

Open Access

Dan is a supporter of open access and hopes that the new Commission make up 
will lead the Commission to addressing and fixing the structural problems in 
the industry.  They have been frustrated by the amount of time and attention 
California has taken, and he is hopeful that they will be able to get 
California behind them and focus on transmission issues.  He believes FERC 
needs to have jurisdiction over native load and intimated that he would not 
be unhappy if FERC lost the Supreme Court case.

EPSA 

Dan said EPSA needs to be more focused.  We need to decide what issues are 
most important to the group and focus on those issues.  He also expressed 
concern that EPSA is always negative and does not give FERC enough credit for 
the progress it has made.  He also said EPSA needs to get the word out on the 
Hill that FERC's actions, right or wrong, are having the desired result 
(lower prices).

Overall, it was a good meeting.  Dan was happy to meet with us and said he 
and his office would like to hear from us about issues whenever we would like 
to visit with them.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments concerning the 
foregoing.

Sarah

		 Subject: Western Wholesale Activities - Gas & Power

Is there any way that this group of people (and other people who may want to 
participate) can begin to have weekly conference calls to keep everyone fully 
in the loop on what is happening and needs to happen going forward related to 
wholesale activities - gas & power?

When things settle down (will that ever happen?), maybe weekly calls won't be 
necessary.  But given the pace and intensity of matters, we should try and 
coordinate through a 30 minute call.  I suggest Friday afternoon (3pm 
Houston) - that should give us the ability to make sure the right RCRs are 
submitted for discussion Monday am.

Also, Sue Mara has been keeping a catalog of activities on Power Wholesale 
matters.  (1) Sue can you please send it out to all of these people, (2) Sue. 
should we let the DC team - Ray and Donna - keep the catalog to make sure 
that we are organized before FERC?  Appreciate your thoughts.

Let me know.  I'll ask Marcia to try and put this together for this Friday 
and going forward.

Jim

Sergio:

Attached are a few documents that set out Enron's position on governance 
issues.  Each document is somewhat case specific (eg. GridFlorida focuses on 
the governance problems in  Florida, etc) but you will see our general 
position from each document.  As you will see in the GridFlorida pleading, we 
urge FERC to order Florida to implement a governance structure similar to 
that in PJM, which has worked quite well over the past couple of years.  In 
the California White Paper, we focus on the problems with the stakeholder 
board which has since been disbanded and replaced with a board chosen by the 
California government.  In the last California protest, we focus on the 
problems with the California government putting in their own board.

Please let me know if you have any questions or if you need other documents.

Sarah



GridFlorida Final:



White paper filed in California, prepared by Frontier Economics and Tabors 
Caramanis.  See page 32, section 5, which discusses governance issues.



California pleading regarding the recent changes in the California ISO's 
board of directors.

MEMORANDUM

TO: Regulatory Affairs Committee
       Power Marketers Working Group

FROM: Joe Hartsoe, Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair
            Bob Reilley, Power Marketers Working Group Chair
            Julie Simon, Vice President of Policy

DATE: April 10, 2001

RE: Draft EPSA Brief to the Supreme Court in the Appeal of
      Order No. 888
      ? Comments due by Friday, April 13th

Attached is a draft of the brief EPSA's counsel has drafted for filing in 
support of Enron's position in the U.S. Supreme Court appeal of Order No. 
888.  EPSA's brief focuses on how FERC's failure to assert jurisdiction over 
interstate transmission bundled with retail power sales creates a regulatory 
gap that allows vertically integrated utilities substantial competitive 
advantages and creates incentives for discrimination.

Please review the draft brief and provide written comments to Julie Simon at 
202-628-8200 or jsimon@epsa.org by close of business on Friday, April 13th.  
The brief must be filed with the Court on Thursday, April 19th, but we need 
to allow adequate time from printing to the Court's specifications.   If you 
have any questions or concerns, please contact Julie.

FERC issued three CA orders today.  Ray Alvarez sent out a summary on the 
order related to increasing Generation and Transmission in the west. The 
report below came from IEP's attorney.

Underscheduling -- Enron has been on both sides on this issue -- here's 
what's happened

One CA order rejects the requests by PG&E, SoCal Edison and the CAISO to
suspend the underscheduling penalty adopted in the December 15th Order.  The
Commission is currently reviewing data filed by the CAISO in conjunction
with a request to waive the underscheduling and will address the
underscheduling penalty in a future order.  The Order does accept the
CAISO's proposal to split the BEEP stack into Operating Reserves and
Imbalance Energy.


QFs -- Ridgewood Complaint

The second order address QF issues.  Granting, in part, Ridgewood and CCC's
request for emergency relief, the Commission ruled that when QFs sell excess
power or make third party sales as authorized by a court, the California
utilities must provide interconnection and transmission service to make
those sales.  The Commission deferred decision on whether QFs that have not
been fully paid can make third party bilateral sales.


Obstacles -- Subject of Ray's earlier e-mail

The third order addresses obstacles to increased energy supply.  The
Commission takes a number of actions, including allowing premium returns on
equity (200 basis points) and accelerated depreciation (10 years) for
projects that increase transmission capacity in the short term (July 1,
2001).  The basis points go down if the project comes on later.  The order
also allows rolled-in treatment of interconnection and upgrade costs for new
supply, broadens and extends QF waivers of operating and efficiency
standards, waives prior notice requirements and grants market-based rate
authority for sales from back-up and self-generation in WSCC, authorizes
certain demand side sales and management programs, and encourages pipeline
construction projects.

More to follow when we review the orders.

Rick:

As agreed I have put down some thoughts summarizing how to proceed on these
issues (see attachment). I have kept the schedule as tight as possible given
the urgency in responding publicly. Let me know what you think.

I don't have everyone's email here (I am at home) so perhaps Ginger can
circulate it to Steve, Ron, etc. as appropriate.

By the way if you ever want to reach me you can try (617) 513-5904, which is
a cellphone that I generally have with me (but very rarely give out the
number).

Subject: Re: RTO Advocacy Positions  

To the discussion I would add the following -

1. Our efforts to push hard zonal markets has not been overly successful.  
The opponents of such schemes continue to win converts that the interzonal 
and intrazonal congestion costs will be large and that it is very difficult 
to get the "right" zones.  Moreover, in markets like ERCOT, the zonal 
structure has been co-opted by the large incumbents to frustrate the 
development of the market.

2. One solution discussed throughout the East is the "Hybrid" model - LMP in 
the real-time and Flowgates to manage forward transmission congestion.  If 
structured properly, this allows the power desk to have (a) a real-time 
energy market and (b) managable transmission risk.  There are disagreements 
between the policy "experts" about Flowgates (see point 5).

3. Our goal is to work within the RTO process and build markets that work for 
Enron.  Key goals - 1. single control area for the RTO, 2. real time energy 
market with no penalties for unbalanced positions, 3. market hubs (similar to 
PJM West) for liquidty, and 4. manageable transmission congestion using 
market solutions.

4. I agree with Tim that it is very difficult to come up with "one" perfect 
market structure proposal for Enron (both for technical and timing reasons - 
California is in a different place than SPP).  We are trying to coordinate 
our statements in each of the markets as much as possible.  Most importantly, 
and we have had some troubles in ERCOT lately, we need to make sure that 
saying something in one market doesn't damage our other advocacy efforts.  
Government Affairs is trying to make sure that we push at the right time and 
place and ensure that our messages have the necessary context.   

5. We still hear some open questions about the best form of market-based 
congestion managment (option vs. obligation; use it or lose it).  Christi 
Nicolay is having a call on Friday to discuss these issues.  Please contact 
her if anyone from your teams should attend.

Call with any other questions.  At some point, we need to ensure complete 
agreement of our policy(s) and our advocacy efforts on RTOs.

Jim

		 Subject: Re: RTO Advocacy Positions

Are you putting words in my mouth Tim.  

The East is absolutely adamant about having a liquid real-time energy markets 
with a "real supply curve" and a "real demand curve" such that hourly 
clearing prices reflect the true economic value of the commodity.   With 
respect to the number of hourly price signals within an RTO that is 
necessary, that is subject to much debate.   Although I prefer a zonal model 
for simplicity reasons, the reality is that congestion is more prevalent in 
the East in most of the markets and in order to get a functioning real time 
energy market, we may have settle for a limited LMP, in which nodal pricing 
is necessary for managing the congestion, but proxy buses are created in 
zones (3-5 per RTO) for purposes of real-time energy markets.

Our views, I believe, are still very much aligned, however, I need to make 
some progress on the creation of real time energy markets.   The zonal 
markets implemented in NEPOOL and contemplated for ERCOT result in a 
mis-priced commodity with no "real" price signal sent to the market.   Out of 
merit generation is and will continue to be dispatched because the congestion 
is managed through energy uplift payments (congestion price signal is not 
sent to the market).   This results in a very inefficient commodity market 
where the consumer gets screwed and market makers can't price the commodity 
or transportation on a forward basis.

I hope this clarifies any misunderstanding.

------------------------------------------------

Steve Walton was in Portland last week and updated me on the latest vision 
for RTO's that was developed by the east desk.  This vision seems to differ 
somewhat from what we are advocating in the west.  In particular, it seems 
like the east has embraced a nodal system while the west is firmly planted in 
the zonal / flow-gate camp.  I have asked Steve to flesh out more details of 
the nodal approach -- in particular, how do the nodes map to a fairly 
homogeneous zone and how does this impact pure trading positions (i.e., a 
transaction with no asset being directly scheduled to support it) versus 
asset-based trades where the meter must settle with the RTO while the trade 
settles with the market.

It may be that the physical characteristics of the east and west warrant 
different models.  For example, the west has large, long-distance, high 
voltage lines that are very amenable to a zonal approach.  The east has more 
local transmission bottlenecks that may not be modeled as easily.  It also 
could be that the political reality in the east and west require different 
positions.  As things sit now, there is no way that a zonal approach could 
fly in the northwest.  In contrast, PJM seems firmly planted in the nodal.  
Finally, it could be that the east desk and the west desk have a difference 
of opinion on what the "ideal" market structure should be.  If that is the 
case, then perhaps we need to talk some more.

Given the different advocacy positions in the east and the west, I don't 
think that we can come up with a broad, nationwide advocacy position at this 
time.  That is, I don't think that we should endorse either zonal or nodal as 
"the answer" at FERC.  Instead, I think that we should focus on the 
objectives that RTO's should try to achieve and be flexible as to what the 
best market structure should be to achieve these objectives.

What do you guys think about this?

Regards,
Tim

We received the attached document from Scott Miller on the OMTR staff at 
FERC.  Scott is concerned that the current discussion of a national energy 
strategy does not include a meaningful focus on critical electric issues.  
Both at FERC and with lawmakers, Scott is encouraging people to stress the 
issues identified in this paper in an effort to focus decision-makers on the 
needs of the electric industry in the current debate.  If you have any

The attached document is something of a quick primer on
Flow Gate versus Locational Marginal Pricing (PJM model).

The first portion is a recent article on the two models
and where the two camps are heading.

The last part is a write up by Randy Berry of ESCA
Marketing on the ESCA outlook.

I've not edited Randy's comments so you can see what are
some of our biases are though ESCA addresses BOTH models
in our RTO/ISO systems.  Bear in mind these are simply one
of our staff members comments, but they at least elucidate
some difficult concepts in a reasonable way.

This seemed like something some of you might want as
background, if it's superfluous to your job, please
delete.  dsg

E-Notes provides regular briefings on new developments in global energy and
public utility law.

July 2, 2001

Market-Based Rates for Ancillary Services

 Pursuant to Order No. 888, companies with general market-based rate
authority must separately obtain market-based rate authority for ancillary
services.  See Order No. 888 at 31,720 quoting the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) as stating: "The fact that we have authorized a utility to
sell wholesale power at market-based rates does not mean we have authorized
the utility to sell ancillary services at market-based rates."  Accordingly,
an entity with market-based rate authority must make a separate showing with
regard to securing market-based rates for ancillary services.

 In markets that are currently administered by independent system
operators ("ISOs") - i.e., the PJM Interconnection, LLC ("PJM"), the New
York ISO ("NYISO"), ISO-New England ("ISO-NE"), and the California ISO
("Cal-ISO") - the FERC has previously permitted entities with general
market-based rate authority to sell ancillary services in those markets to
the extent that it has authorized other suppliers to sell such ancillary
services.  See Canadian Niagara Power Co., Ltd., 87 FERC ? 61,070 (1999)

As a general proposition, companies that have sought authority to sell
ancillary services in these ISO markets have simply requested the blanket
authorization for sales of ancillary services.  Many companies have added
that they desire the authority to be extended to additional ancillary
services and geographic markets, as the FERC may specify and authorize in
the future in orders that extend such authority to all sellers previously
authorized to sell energy and/or capacity at market-based rates.  See Edison
Mission Mktg. and Trading, Docket No. ER99-2434-000 (unpublished delegated
letter order issued May 7, 1999).

 The authority to make sales of ancillary services at market-based
rates is not, merely, limited to only those markets were established by the
FERC with operating ISOs.  The criteria for seeking such authority in
non-ISO markets is found in the Avista case.  See Avista Corp., 87 FERC -
61,223, reh'g granted, 89 FERC - 61,136 (1999) ("Avista").  The problem
associated with obtaining market-based rates for ancillary services in
non-ISO markets has centered on the difficulty (or impossibility) of
obtaining estimates of other suppliers' abilities to supply ancillary
services to support a reliable market analysis that demonstrates that the
entity seeking such authority does not have market power in the relevant
markets for ancillary services.  However, in the Avista case, the FERC
authorized the provision of Regulation and Frequency Response, Energy
Imbalance, Operating Reserve - Spinning Reserve Service, and Operating
Reserve - Supplemental Reserve Service at market-based rates in non-ISO
markets with certain conditions.

 The Avista conditions require the Company to consider: (1) the
establishment of an internet site that provides information on, and
conducts, ancillary services transactions; (2) the posting on the internet
site of the offering prices of all available services; and (3) the ability
of customers to request services and make bids for those services using the
site.  Moreover, the entity must file with the FERC one year after the
internet site is operational, and at least three years thereafter, a report
describing its activities in the relevant ancillary services markets.  The
entity must also commit not to sell ancillary services at market-based rates
to:  (i) regional transmission organizations ("RTOs") such as an ISO or
transco, i.e., where the RTO has no ability to self-supply ancillary
services but instead depends on third parties; (ii) a traditional franchised
public utility affiliated with the entity, or sales where the underlying
transmission is on the system of a public utility affiliated with the
entity; or (iii) a public utility that is purchasing ancillary services to
satisfy its own open access transmission tariff requirements to offer
ancillary services to its own customers.  Id. at 61,833, note 12.

 The terms and conditions associated with the provision of ancillary
services at market-based rates must be included in the market-based rate
schedule filed with the FERC and address the limitations on that authority
as discussed above.  For entities which have already obtained general
market-based rate authority, an amendment could be filed in their underlying
market-based rate dockets before the FERC seeking the authority to also sell
ancillary services at market-based rates consistent with the referenced FERC
precedent.

Today's Washington Post reports on an interview with FERC commissioners Wood 
and Massey following yesterday's hearing before the Senate Governmental 
Affairs Committee.  According to the Post, each commissioner said they are 
prepared to make "heavy refunds" because of overcharging in California.  They 
each said they agreed to give the parties a chance to work it out in the 
upcoming settlement conference first.  The Post article (which was on the 
front page of the business section, perhaps an indication of the somewhat 
diminished press coverage of the issue) mentioned Enron in a list of 
companies "facing allegations of overcharges."

There are also news reports that Gov. Davis met with commissioners Wood and 
Brownell while he was in town.  The same reports say that Gov. Davis will 
meet with commissioner Wood in California on  Monday.

On December 15, 2000, EPSA, ELCON, Enron, Reliant and Dynegy filed a request 
for FERC to hold a technical conference to focus the industry on 
interregional coordination as prescribed in the RTO Order 2000 Function 8 
requirements.  Enron et al were concerned that the RTO initiatives underway 
were independently developing RTOs with little emphasis on coordination with 
neighboring business practices.  

At the May 30, 2001 FERC meeting, Chairman Hebert announced this FERC 
technical conference may be scheduled as early as June.  This is a reversal 
of the Chairman's earlier resistance to holding a technical conference when 
he instead favored the RTO filing process to individually address 
interregional coordination.

The key to the Chairman's change in direction can be attributed to Enron's 
active participation on the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative (ESC) a 
non-NERC industry collaborative effort formed to respond to the FERC ANOPR on 
OASIS Phase II.  

By working through a EPSA/ELCON joint filing in response to the ESC filing, 
Enron was able to raise awareness of the seams coordination threats to OASIS 
Phase II development and successfully sway the ESC to file in support of the 
earlier EPSA/ELCON/Enron/Reliant/Dynegy Request for Technical Conference. 

Govt Affairs will continue to monitor the development of the Technical 
Conference and provide needed support to resolve inter-RTO seams issues.

Attached is the second draft of Enron's comments to FERC on ICAP.  The structure of the paper is summarised below:

1.  RTO's are a positive step forward for the industry.
2.  Spot markets are a necessary part of RTO development to ensure that the RTO can manage real time realiability.
3.  A well functioning spot market eliminates the need for separate capacity type products such as ICAP, reserve margin (i.e. it achieves the objectives of iCap).  The paper incorporates theoretical and emperical evidence from other sectors of the economy and deregulation in other parts of the world to support this conclusion.
4.  During the transition from a regulated environment to RTO's there may be a 'political' need for ICAP.  Specifically states that any interim proposal should be limited to 2 years after RTO implementation.
5.  If that is the case, the paper sets out the two common theoretical platforms which can be used as a basis for ICAP.
6.  Proposes two options based on the theroetical platforms.  

We would appreciate input on two issues.

Firstly, Enron needs to make a decision on whether to limit our position to reliance on spot markets (i.e. don't suggest an interim solution).  While this is attractive, it is unlikely that Enron will get support from other participants (ICAP payments subsidize generation investment so no support from IPP's and consumers are not as confident as Enron that competitive markets will maintain reliability so they will want to sustain ICAP).

Secondly, drafting comments on the paper generally.  Please note that the final section, that proposes the Enron solution, requires substantial redrafting which will be done if the consensus is to propose such a solution.

A final draft will be sent out on the morning of Tuesday 10/16, the paper will be filed Wednesday.

regards
Mike ext. 57634

PS.  i don't want to sway opinion but i thought it may be useful to state my view.  I think that we concentrate on the rationale supporting RTO's and effective spot markets as mechanisms that achieve the goals of ICAP (i.e A spot market is Enrons solution).  Instead of proposing specific ICAP related solutions, we state that if others have different views, these should be debated in a specific FERC forum and any resulting separate iCap proposal if implemented should be interim in nature and minimise spot market distortions....

Seabron --

Here is a paper Brattle is putting together for Enron in Japan.  See Section 
5 - A Japanese Pool.  They make several good arguments as to why a mandatory 
pool with financial settlements around the pool is key for Japanese 
liberalization.   Maybe steal some of their ideas for our US policy arguments.

MEMORANDUM

TO: Regulatory Affairs Committee
       Power Marketers Working Group

FROM: Jim Steffes, Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair
            Bob Reilley, Power Marketers Working Group Chair
            Julie Simon, Vice President of Policy
            Mark Bennett, Senior Manager of Policy
            Erin Perrigo, Manager of Policy

DATE: May 29, 2001

RE: FERC Clarification of Market Mitigation Procedures

On Friday afternoon, the Commission issued an Order clarifying certain 
aspects of its April 26th Order on mitigation measures.  While not addressing 
the rehearing requests or the CAISO compliance filing, the Commission 
established procedures for the CAISO to use alternative information from a 
comparable unit for generators that refuse to provide heat rate and emission 
data to the CAISO.  If an alternative source of data doesn't exist, the CAISO 
can assume the generator is a price-taker and use a bid of $0/MWh for all 
available capacity from that unit.

Second, the Commission rejected the CAISO'a approach to calculating the proxy 
gas price and directed the CAISO to calculate the price using the published 
daily price for Malin, PG&E CityGate, Southern California Border (Kern River 
Station), SoCalGas large packages and PG&E large packages.

Third, the Commission rejected the CAISO's decision to apply price mitigation 
only to the Imbalance Energy Market and not to Ancillary Service spot markets 
or Adjustment Bids.

Finally, the Commission granted a request by several California cities to 
require that a creditworthy buyer be in place for all must offer power.

The order is attached.  If you have any questions, contact Julie Simon at 
EPSA at 202-628-8200 or jsimon@epsa.org.

Here is a first  publishable draft.? This has benefited greatly from comments 
by Richard,  Judy, and of course Dan, but wcp takes full responsibility.
?
Careful further  review by all is needed.? I can identify two basic problems: 
the repeated  statistics for use of the grids are believed to be about right, 
but we lack  authoritative sources and we need to go with something firmer 
(as we in the  power biz say); second, the examples given both late in the 
statement and near  the end of the brief have been reworked by me in light of 
some very helpful  conversations yesterday, but I may not have gotten them 
right, or put them as  well as I could have; these also need citations if 
possible.
?
I will be out of  play until late morning Monday (going to Charlottesville 
for a speech by my  spouse).? Comments should be routed to others on the WCP 
team as well  as?me.? We hope to have all significant comments by the end of 
next  week (earlier?where possible of course), so that we can put the brief 
in  final shape over the weekend.
?
Thanks to  all.

Susan and I will circulate a draft response against Dynegy's position later today.  ComEd plans to file a lengthy answer disputing Dynegy stating that there are no transmission problems due to the use of the firm LD resources and that FERC precedent does not support a capacity payment requirement.

Enron will respond similarly and include an argument that Dynegy is actually trying to create an "icap/capacity" requirement where there is none (Dynegy's pleading states "ComEd's failure to enforce the network designation provisions of its OATT also deprives Dynegy of capacity payments to which it is entitled.)  We will also include statements that the continuation of the network v. PTP transmission tariffs perpetuates these types of issues and the market/tariff design that we advocate should be approved to stop these problems.

Subject:	Dynegy vs. ComEd (EL02-6) -- further info

As I mentioned in my previous e-mail, on October 17 Dynegy filed a complaint against ComEd.  This proceeding may be of particular interest to Enron given EES's plans to offer physical delivery in Illinois in early 2002.  I've outlined Dynegy's principal arguments below.  Dynegy requested fast-track processing, so any intervention and comments we file are due Friday, Oct. 26.  In order to file a timely intervention (and meaningful comments, if we decide to comment), I need to know your thoughts on this as soon as possible.  Elizabeth and Harlan, I'm copying you because I would especially like to know what you think of Dynegy's characterization of the Firm LD product.

Main argument:
Dynegy challenges ComEd's published Business Practice that allows "marketer firm" (Firm LD) contracts to be designated as Network Resources.  Dynegy argues that this practice conflicts with the OATT provisions that 1) Network Resources are generation "owned, purchased or leased by the Network Customer designated to serve Network Load," and 2) a Network Customer "must demonstrate that it owns or has committed to purchase generation pursuant to an executed contract" in order to designate a Network Resource.

Dynegy's theory on why Firm LD should not be a Network Resource:

	- permits designation of network resources that are committed for sale to others, creating reliability problems
	- Firm LD under the EEI contract is not capacity-backed, nor is it a commitment to purchase generation
	- allows transmission customers to get the advantage of generation capacity without actually paying the cost of that capacity
	- since retail providers are allowed to rely on "over-the-counter" firm instead of securing long-term contracts, adequate reserves are not being carried to serve retail load
	
Dynegy claims that ComEd's practice has deprived DMG of payments for capacity and the ability to earn revenues for capacity properly designated as network resources.  It cites specific instances in which ComEd has accepted transmission reservation requests from New Energy and Cilco in which these parties designated Illinois Power as a network resource, when only a Firm LD contracts were in place with IP.

Two weeks ago, EPSA had a FERC Outreach meeting with FERC's Office of Markets 
Rates and Tariffs staff to discuss issues of importance to EPSA members.  Jim 
Steffes attended the meeting on behalf of Enron.  During the meeting, one of 
the issues raised was the lack of comparable transmission service between 
network and point to point service.  Several staffers (including Don Gelinas) 
expressed interest in ways that FERC could address this comparability 
problem.   After the meeting, Julie Simon met with Andrea Wolfman (head of 
Market Oversight) and Andrea also expressed an interest in the issue.

Julie scheduled a meeting with Andrea and Ginny Strasser for today for EPSA 
members.  I attended the meeting, along with representatives from Williams, 
Duke, Dynegy, Mirant, and Reliant.   We told Andrea and Ginny that now that 
FERC has issued its order on California, it's time to focus on the rest of 
the country, and we have real problems, one being lack of comparable 
transmission service -- namely, that utilities have network service and we 
have point to point service.  

While a lot of the conversation was based on generators' problems in 
interconnecting to the grid (due to the problems with using point to point 
rather than network service), we also discussed that this is a problem for 
all transmission customers, not just generators.  Andrea asked if providing 
some kind of new "Network Plus" type of service would also require 
elimination of the native load exception.  We explained that while the native 
load exception must be eliminated,  there is still a need for a Network Plus 
type service because network is a superior service to point to point, and 
utilities will still have access to this superior service, even when the 
native load exception is eliminated.  The point of this meeting was not to 
ask FERC to deal with the native load issue in this meeting -- Julie felt 
that because Don Gelinas expressed interest in solving the network problem, 
that we should respond to his interest, rather than trying to get our entire 
agenda passed all at once.

Andrea seemed receptive to our ideas and suggested that we need to educate 
FERC staff.  She also noted that if the Commissioners make this a priority of 
theirs, that FERC staff will be much more willing to learn the issue and find 
a way to solve the problem.  

EPSA is going to work on a position paper on this new type of service.  At 
the Function 8 (seams issues) Technical Conference yesterday, both Pat Wood 
and Nora Brownell were interested in the comparability issue and ways to 
address it.   So, we need to get the Commissioners on board with the idea 
(Massey is already there, which he indicated in his concurrence in the 
Entergy Source and Sink order) and begin to educate FERC staff.  

Please let me know if you have any comments or ideas.  I will circulate the 
EPSA draft position paper once I receive it.

Attached is Lou Cohen's (of Wilmer Cutler) write up of the Supreme Court's 
grant of two petitions for certiorari in the appeals of FERC's Order No. 888 
on transmission open access.  While too much should never be read into a 
grant of certiorari, this seems to be auspicious for Enron and to validate 
Joe's conclusion that it would be imprudent for Enron to rest on its victory 
in the court of appeals and not oppose proactively New York, et al. who are 
asking the Court to expand the native load exception.  It should also be 
noted that the broadside against FERC's authority to act (the Dalton cert. 
petition), which Enron took the lead in opposing, was rejected outright.  
Enron's brief is due in 45 days.  Joe and I shall meet with Lou early next 
week to get this process started.  Please call me if you have any questions.

Here is a  summary.? I included the cites just in case.? Let me know if you 
need  more.
?
The Supreme Court  today granted two petitions for certiorari to review the 
D.C. Circuit's decision  in Transmission Access Policy Study Group v. FERC, 
225 F.3d 667  (2000).? The Court granted the petition of New York and other 
states (New  York?v. FERC, No. 00-568)) to consider?whether FERC may preempt 
state  jurisdiction over transmission of energy from generators to retail 
customers in  the same state.? (The Court declined other questions?New 
York?had  raised.)? The Court also granted the petition of Enron Power 
Marketing,  Inc. (EPMI v. FERC, No. 00-809) to consider whether FERC has 
jurisdiction to  regulate all transmission in interstate commerce, including 
transmission for  bundled retail sales, and whether FERC is obligated under 
the Federal Power Act  to eliminate undue discrimination by requiring 
transmission-owning utilities to  provide service on the same terms to all 
users, including bundled retail  sales.? The cases will be argued together, 
probably not before October  2001.

Dick -- I totally agree with you that allowing the TPs to work in some 
"credit" for adjustments that can only be made to their generation (and that 
by definition will not be transparent to anyone) is bad.  Can you send me a 
paper, email, etc. where they have said this and we can pursue it (whether by 
alerting FERC, etc.)  Thanks.

Subject: Re: Update on PFTF   IMPORTANT  

Bill, Charles,  Keep in mind that the system physically operates 
automatically with the actual flow effected by the net schedules thus we 
should come up with a way to net schedules for the IDC and TLR process.  I 
have one major concern in the netting dialog and in the current TLR 
discussions.  The providers are proposing that they be given credit for not 
only netting of unit generation which is probably OK but also they want 
credit in the TLR process for units whose generation has been adjusted prior 
to the TLR being called.  They say they sometimes adjust generation before 
calling a TLR to try and prevent the need for a TLR.  Sounds good and it is 
good that some of them try to do this but to give them credit for adjusting 
generation that was adjusted prior to a TLR being called after the TLR is 
then implemented will be a source of abuse that will be dificult to police.  
It is the Native Load issue again, though they never bring Native Load into 
the discussions.  I am looking for a solution that will encourage them to 
adjust generation prior to calling a TLR and would not then be abused in the 
TLR process.  Anyone have any IDEAS let me know.

		 Subject: Update on PFTF

Dick/Charles,

Here's a very brief update of the PFTF conference call held on Friday 27 APR.

Tom Mallinger opened the call by briefly going over our seven alternatives 
for the inclusion of netted effects in the TLR 5 relief assignment. We talked 
about the presentation Tom gave before the SCS. Tom said that the SCS shot 
down any alternative that did not give credit to the PSE. That left our most 
complicated alternative as the only solution. I asked if the complexity was 
worth the benefit.

At this point Tom said (emphatically) that both Dick and Lydia Volmer 
insisted that the PFTF come up with a solution other than the existing 
solution and that the new solution be one which gives PSEs incentive to 
create counter flows.

Our call settled on the PFTF selecting our seventh alternative, which is also 
the most complex. This alternative will give the PSE credit for counter flows 
(by PSE) and will also give control areas credit for counter flows (by CA). 
Details are to be worked out.

COMMENTS:

The existing method looked at positive contributions to the flow gate and 
ignores negative contributions (netting effects).

Dick - what is your position on sticking with the existing procedure vs. 
creating a new procedure which allows netting? Did Tom characterize your and 
Lydia's opinion correctly above? My concern is that the CAs will always have 
netted affects available and thus will always benefit from the new procedure 
(at the expense of point-to-point). We will have to predict when and where 
the TLR 5 will occur and then create a transaction, before the fact, to 
benefit from the new netting procedure. This procedure will not be useful 
after the fact. 

My real question - Is the SCS insisting on a netting procedure, or does Tom 
just not want to go back empty handed? In each PFTF meeting he is adamant 
that we reach consensus on a new solution that includes netting. If this is 
really what the SCS wants, the we'll push for the complex solution. I just 
think this is another NERC band-aid approach that is unnecessarily complex 
and may not benefit Enron.

Let me know your thoughts.

Bill Rust

PLEASE FORWARD TO ANYONE APPROPRIATE:

Judge Wagner issued a public Proposed Recommendation (the media was in the 
room) to resolve the matters before the Settlement process late Monday 
afternoon.

He initially talked about "can bring a horse to water, but can't make him 
drink."  

He went on to detail that the Suppliers had offered $716.1MM for Settlement 
($510MM for Duke, Dynegy, Mirant, Williams, Reliant + $125MM for Powerex + 
$49.6MM for 15 marketers + $6.5MM for 6 CMUA members + $25MM for outside 
Calif Utilities [includes PGE]).  He said thought refunds in the hundred of 
$millions or maybe $1billion were right.

His will propose the following method to the Commission.  

1. Retroactively apply the June 19 Order from Oct 2 - June 19.
2. Modify that decision to (a) use actual heat rates from marginal unit in 
NP15 and SP15, (b) use two daily gas prices - north CA and south CA, (c) 
incorporate NOx costs, (c) add a 10% credit premium.
3. Commission should hold an expedited 60 day hearing on matters relating to 
questions of material facts (Mwh sold, gas prices, etc).

He did indicate that his perspective was that the moneys owed could be offset 
against CAISO bills.

Importantly, we are unsure if the Judge will recommend to have FERC  (a) 
determine that upon the application of this refund Order the rates are 
determined to be J&R, (b) ensure that all buyers in these markets get similar 
refunds, (c) limit the refund to not include CDWR and CAISO Out-of-Market 
transactions.

We are intending to communicate with the Judge's staff tomorrow on these 
issues to seek clarity.

Finally, is it appropriate to have Charles River Associates attempt to 
calculate the refund liability?  We may want to understand the risk under 
different assumptions.

Thanks,

Jim

The Commission issued a couple of orders in PJM last week:

PJM=01,s Load Response Program:  FERC approved implementation of two load=
=20
response pilot programs proposed by PJM which will be effective June 1, 200=
1=20
through May 31, 2002.  Under the first program, referred to as the =01&Emer=
gency=20
Option,=018 a PJM member may sign up to be a participant in the program and=
 will=20
be paid the higher of the relevant zonal LMP or $500/MWh for the actual kWh=
=20
relief provided when the PJM member nominates load reduction in response to=
 a=20
request from PJM.  Under the second option, referred to as the =01&Economic=
=20
Option,=018 the PJM member will be able to reduce load in response to econo=
mic=20
signals, regardless of whether emergency conditions exist.  PJM will bill t=
he=20
LSE serving the end-use customer the LMP that would have been charged absen=
t=20
the reduction.  PJM will then refund to the LSE the retail generation and=
=20
transmission charges that the LSE would have received had the load not been=
=20
reduced.  The difference between the amount billed and refunded to the LSE=
=20
will be paid to the end-user.

Several customers opposed PJM=01,s programs, particularly the Economic Opti=
on. =20
However, FERC found that both programs allow end use customers to see price=
s=20
and respond to them when it is economically beneficial for them to do so. =
=20
FERC noted that because PJM's current market structure does not communicate=
=20
wholesale prices to retail customers in real time, they have no incentive t=
o=20
reduce demand when prices increase.  FERC finds that PJM's plan will, in=20
part, fix this flaw in its market structure.  PJM is required to file a=20
report with FERC by the end of the year evaluating the effectiveness of the=
=20
program.

Changes to PJM's Reliability Assurance Agreement (RAA):  FERC also approved=
=20
PJM's proposed changes to its RAA, effective June 1.  PJM had requested FER=
C=20
authorization to change the RAA by i) adjusting the time period over which =
an=20
LSE must commit generation resources to PJM to meet its capacity obligation=
s=20
under the RAA, from a daily to a seasonal commitment; ii) adjusting the=20
deficiency charge provisions to provide for a seasonal, rather than a daily=
,=20
penalty for LSEs; and iii) requiring generation owners to commit excess=20
capacity to PJM seasonally, rather than daily, in order to participate in a=
ny=20
distribution of revenues from capacity deficiency charges paid by LSEs.  EP=
MI=20
supported PJM's changes, stating that although the ICAP requirement should =
be=20
eliminated entirely, the proposed changes are a step in the right direction=
=20
in resolving the delisting problem.

In approving the changes, FERC stated that moving from daily to seasonal=20
deficiency charges discourages generators from delisting capacity during th=
e=20
summer and gives LSEs the incentive to meet their capacity obligations,=20
thereby helping PJM to meet its short-term and long-term reliability goals.=
 =20
FERC also said that PJM's Market Monitoring Unit will be able to monitor=20
generator gaming behavior and take appropriate action if necessary.

Attached is the final draft of this paper for comment.  It incorporates the comments of those who responded but there is time for further redrafting.  However, given the filing deadline (Wednesday) further changes are likely to be wordsmithing unless someone vehemently objects to the structure.

Mike ext. 57634

PS.  There were no objections to my thoughts on structure so we have concentrated on the rationale supporting RTO's and effective spot markets as mechanisms that achieve the goals of ICAP (i.e A spot market is Enrons solution).  We then state that if others have different views, any resulting separate iCap proposal if implemented should be interim in nature and minimise spot market distortions.  Finally we attach a simple interim solution as an appendix (so it does not detract from our main argument structure) so that if there is an ongoing debate we will be able to take part...

MEMORANDUM

TO: Regulatory Affairs Committee
Power Marketers Working Group

FROM: Joe Hartsoe, Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair
Bob Reilley, Power Marketers Working Group Chair
Julie Simon, Vice President of Policy
Mark Bennett, Senior Manager of Policy
Erin Perrigo, Manager of Policy

DATE: April 6, 2001

RE: FERC Orders Issued April 6th (1) CalPX Chargebacks;
(2)CalPX  Rate Recalculations; and (3) Kern River
Certificate

We want to inform you of three significant orders FERC issued today, two 
relating to the California Power Exchange (CalPX), and the third concerning a 
pipeline project from Wyoming to California.

(1) Pacific Gas & Electric Company v. California Power Exchange Corporation, 
et al. (Docket Nos. EL01-29/33/36/37/43-000) "Order on Complaints Concerning 
Use of Chargebacks and Liquidation of Collateral"
In this order, the Commission addressed five complaints against the CalPx 
concerning its response to alleged defaults by Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) 
and Southern California Edison Company (SoCal Edison).  Among other things, 
the Commission determined that "the chargeback provision in the PX tariff was 
not designed to address default of this magnitude and, thus, its application 
in these circumstances is unjust and unreasonable."  Accordingly, the 
Commission directed the CalPX to rescind all prior chargeback actions and 
refrain from any future chargeback actions relating to PG&E and SoCal 
Edison's liabilities, subject to further Commission action in accordance with 
the order.
Regarding the ultimate question of how the PX should account for the 
nonpayments by SoCal Edison and PG&E, the Commission deferred further action 
pending the outcome of SoCal Edison's State Court Complaint, as well as the 
Government Claims Board Complaint.  Finally, with respect to the PX's 
bankruptcy proceeding, the Commission concluded that section 362(b)(4) of the 
Bankruptcy Code allowed it to lawfully exercise its regulatory power under 
sections 205 and 206 of the Federal Power Act, so long as it did not threaten 
the bankruptcy court's control over the property of the bankruptcy estate.

(2) San Diego Gas & Electric Company v. Sellers of Energy and Ancillary 
Services (Docket Nos. EL00-95-015/016 and Docket Nos. EL00-98-014/015) "Order 
Dismissing Rehearing, Accepting Compliance Filing, and Directing the 
Recalculation of Lower Wholesale Rates"
In this order, the Commission dismissed the CalPX's request for rehearing of 
the Commission's January 29, 2001 order, which found that the CalPX had 
violated the Commission's December 15, 2000 order and the Federal Power Act.  
The December 15 order required the CalPX to pay suppliers in the CalPX 
markets their as-bid price above the $150/MWh breakpoint.  Additionally, the 
Commission accepted the PX's compliance filing and provided guidance to the 
PX on an acceptable methodology so that the PX may implement the $150/MWh 
breakpoint for its January 1, 2001 invoices.  Additionally, as in the 
chargeback case, the Commission determined that its action in the instant 
case was exempt from the automatic stay provision of the Bankruptcy Code.

(3) Kern River Gas Transmission Company (Docket No. CP01-106-000) "Order 
Issuing Certificate"
Pursuant to section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act, the Commission denied the 
protests that had been filed and issued a certificate of public convenience 
and necessity to Kern River authorizing it to construct and operate its 
California Action Project, subject to resolution of the proceeding pending in 
Docket No. CP01-61-000.  However, the Commission rejected Kern River's 
proposal to utilize a return on equity for this project of 15.25 percent.  
Instead, the Commission directed Kern River to file a revised incremental 
rate to reflect a return on equity of 13.25 percent at least 30 days prior to 
commencing service.  Finally, the Commission conditioned the certificate on 
Kern River's compliance with the environmental conditions set forth in 
Appendix C to the order.

These orders can be found on the Bulk Power section of FERC's website, at 
www.ferc.fed.us/electric/bulkpower.htm.  If you have any questions, comments 
or would like additional information relating to these orders, please contact 
either Julie Simon (jsimon@epsa.org) or Mark Bennett (mbennett@epsa.org) at 
(202) 628-8200.

RE: Commission Actions to Increase Supply and Decrease
Consumption in the Western United States--Key Points for
EPSA Comments Due MARCH 30TH

As we previously reported, on March 14, 2001, FERC announced certain actions 
to address the energy problems in California and other areas of the West in 
an Order Removing Obstacles to Increased Electric Generation and Natural Gas 
Supply in the Western United States and Requesting Comments on Further 
Actions to Increase Energy Supply and Decrease Energy Consumption.  The 
following is an overview of the steps the Commission proposes to "immediately 
help increase supply from existing power sources and to provide regulatory 
incentives to build new electric and natural gas infrastructure."  The 
Commission also invited comments on certain proposals.  This memo includes a 
list of key points we intend to make in comments that are due by March 30th.

Overview of Order

The Order reflects a thorough review of  "all of [FERC's] rate and facility 
certification authorities in the areas of electric energy, natural gas, 
hydroelectric and oil to determine how it can increase electric energy 
supply"; however, the Commission noted that its authority is "somewhat 
limited."  While the Commission believes state regulators must assume the 
lead role due to their authority over siting of generation and transmission, 
as well as demand reduction measures, the Commission noted that the impact of 
California's energy shortage on the Western Interconnection "underscores the 
regional, interstate nature of the energy marketplace."  Accordingly, it 
encouraged the formation of a single regional transmission organization for 
western markets.

EPSA appreciates the Commission's effort to exercise the full extent of its 
authority to help ease the West's energy problems.  Taken together, the 
Commission's proposed actions represent positive steps toward rational 
solutions to the difficult circumstances in the West.  Most importantly, the 
Order highlights the importance of promoting infrastructure investment, 
including increased generation, transmission and natural gas pipeline 
facilities.

The Commission's immediate actions, which will expire on December 31, 2001, 
include:

-Requiring the California ISO and transmission owners within the WSCC to 
provide FERC with a list of short-term grid enhancements.

-Extending and broadening waivers of operating and efficiency standards and 
fuel use requirements for qualifying facilities (QF).

-Providing wholesale power sales from generation used primarily for backup 
and self-generation for businesses with prior notice waivers and market-based 
rate authorization.

-Allowing wholesale and retail load reduction to be resold at wholesale 
market-based rates.

The Commission seeks comment on several other proposals, including:

-Rolling in new supply interconnection and upgrade costs.

-Increasing the rate of return on equity for projects that significantly 
increase transmission on constrained and new routes in the near term.

-10-year depreciation for short-term transmission projects, and 15-year 
depreciation for upgrades involving new rights of way that can be in service 
by November 1, 2002.

-Use of the interconnection authority set forth in FPA  o210(d) to help 
alleviate obstacles to electric supply reaching load.

EPSA's Comments

In its conclusion, the Commission stated that comments should be "concise and 
focused."  Accordingly, we suggest that EPSA's comments focus on the 
following areas:

? Applaud the Commission's effort to increase supplies from QFs, but 
encourage it to provide relief from existing contracts by allowing QFs to 
sell to creditworthy parties.

? We understand that there are ongoing differences of opinion regarding the 
relative merits of an incremental versus a "rolled in" approach to 
interconnection and upgrade costs.  Therefore, while we may lack a consensus 
on the question as a final policy position, we believe that the extreme 
circumstances surrounding the Order, and the urgent need to move power 
quickly into the Western system, make it wise to endorse FERC's instant 
recommendation.

? The Commission's proposed actions to create and enhance incentives relating 
to expanding and improving the transmission infrastructure through higher 
ROEs and accelerated depreciation schedules are positive steps.  The 
Commission normally conditions such premiums on meaningful participation in 
regional transmission organizations.  However, given the current situation 
and the immediate impact of any projects that might be entitled to the higher 
ROE, EPSA could support this proposal.

? Constraints on the gas infrastructure have a generally adverse impact on 
the energy supply system.  Therefore, the Commission's proposed waivers of 
blanket certificates and rate incentives to expedite construction projects, 
are favorable developments.

We will discuss the Order and EPSA's comments during tomorrow's Regulatory 
Affairs/Power Marketers' conference call.  In addition, we have been asked to 
consider what type of short-term relief could be included in federal 
legislation.  We will discuss this question as well.  To access the call, 
dial 1-800-937-6563 and ask for the Julie Simon/EPSA call. In the meantime, 
if you have any questions, please contact either Julie Simon, jsimon@epsa.org 
or Mark Bennett, mbennett@epsa.org at (202 628-8200).

Subject: Arizona Public Service v. FERC


I think that you should intervene and possibly take an active role for a 
number of reasons.  Only if Enron were to win outright in the S.Ct. would 
petitioners' challenge in Arizona become moot.  But as we have always 
cautioned, the likelihood of overturning FERC and getting an S. Ct. decision 
putting all transmission on the OATT remains a long shot.  It is more likely 
that FERC will be affirmed and the DC Circuit's deference to FERC will remain 
as to what it must be unbundled.  In that scenario, it will be important to 
Enron that the Arizona precedent be upheld against challenge.  Specifically, 
that precedent is that once retail choice is implemented, all transmission 
becomes unbundled and subject to the OATT, even if later bundled in a default 
standard offer.   Absent legislation, this precedent and the lackadaisical  
RTOs are the only apparent vehicles for expanding open-access in the near 
term.

For these reasons, Enron should intervene at minimal cost and monitor how 
well FERC defends itself.  If FERC does a good job, that will be the end of 
its.  However, if FERC does a poor job, Enron should then consider filing a 
supporting brief.

Some things to consider --

A. Enron Response to Alliance Compliance Filing (pre-MISO/ARTO discussions)

1. Stakeholder Process
 a. Getting better, more meetings post EPSA letter
2. Day One Congestion Management (not much to discuss, already approved by 
FERC)
3. Key Issue - Many details left uncertain until ARTO filing 120 days prior 
to 12/15/01

RECOMMENDATION - Don't file right now.  Talk with FERC staff about our Wish 
List for RTOs. Work through RTO process to implement.

B. National Grid Operation of ARTO (Comments June 14/01)

1. Should Enron Oppose NG?

Yes a. Unclear about how much control NG has in the process (complete tariff 
control?).
 b. There are issues about NG independence from market (NE and NY assets).

No a. NG wants to be a Transco in the ultimate state.
 b. This is a mid-term solution that could work.
 c. If done right, better opportunity to deal with transmission issues than 
current structure.

RECOMMENDATION - Enron should file comments on key open policy issues with 
for-profit Gridco model.  

We don't oppose, but we are concerned that controls must be in place to 
ensure well functioning markets.
The Transco model is the best model for transmission operation.  If this 
action by NG leads ultimately to a Transco, it is a good outcome.
The operator of RTO tariff must be independent of all market players (NG owns 
generation and has distribution in New England).  Transelect wrote "I believe 
quite strongly that FERC should deny this petition because the Grid is a 
significant owner of both distribution and generation assets in the Northeast 
(New England Electric and Niagara Mohawk).  It is a very small step from this 
decision to one that would allow Southern to operate GridSouth, or one that 
would allow Entergy to operate the Florida RTO in exchange for FP&L operating 
the Entergy RTO.  As a matter of National policy, transmission operators 
should be independent of either the wholesale or retail electric markets.  As 
a business issue, many transmission owners are reluctant to divest of 
transmission because they retain hope that their transmission can be used to 
protect above market native generation.  How would you like to try shipping 
power into the Northeast with the Grid, a major retail supplier and a 
significant generator, controlling access to the market?"  We  should make 
this argument very strongly.  NG must have a plan to divest itself of the 
generation and distribution side of the business because NE and NY are 
economically viable markets impacted by the Alliance RTO.
The Operator of RTO must have full authority to modify the tariff and 
operations of the RTO.  The Transmission Providers should not be able to 
restrict or limit in any fashion the for-profit Gridco Operator beyond 
ensuring (1) technical proficency, (2) assets returned in reasonable manner, 
and (3) recovery of FERC approved revenue requirement.

Today at FERC, Enron filed a pleading requesting the complete elimination of "icap" as a product (including any "reserve type" products) based on the fact that the real time spot markets of the RTOS can effectively price this in the cost of energy.  The pleading also includes a proposed interim approach (with a two year sunset date).  This pleading was made in response to FERC's request for comments on "Ensuring Sufficient Capacity Reserves In Today's Energy Markets."

The pleading and affidavit of Larry Ruff, PhD are attached.

In yesterday's prepared testimony before Barton's subcommittee, Chairman 
Hebert stated:  "Finally, I emphasize that the Commission's open access 
program for natural gas transportation has resulted in a vibrant, 
transparent, liquid competitive market for natural gas.  It is critical that 
we continue to develop the same type of competitive, comparable markets for 
electric energy and transmission as well, and to do so as expeditiously as 
possible."

      ?Conference Call on Friday, November 16th at 11:00 AM 
       (EST)

On Friday, November 2nd EPSA held a conference call to discuss the second draft of our leave-behind on market-based rate authority, which details our position on possible changes to FERC's market-based rate authorization standard and the Commission's recently released staff report outlining several alternatives to the currently used hub-and-spoke method.  

Please review the attached draft, which has been extensively revised since the November 2nd call.  An investigation on market-based rate authorization has been noticed for next week's FERC meeting agenda, which makes it important that we come to closure on these issues.  We have scheduled a conference call on Friday, November 16th at 11:00 a.m. (EST) to discuss this draft.  To access the call, please dial 1-800-937-6563.  Ask for the Erin Perrigo/EPSA Call. If you have any questions, comments or edits before the call, please contact Erin Perrigo at 202-628-8200 or eperrigo@epsa.org.

Dickstein Shapiro Morin & Oshinsky has prepared the attached position
paper in connection with tomorrow's FERC conference on the scope of
interconnection studies and services.  It attempts to reflect what we
believe was the consensus position reached during today's and earlier
conference calls regarding the types of interconnection studies/products.

Also included are several additional points covered in the EPSA issues pape=
r relating to both the scope of studies and the rights of
interconnecting parties.  Finally, included is a proposal for an additional=
 interconnection service product sent to us late this afternoon by
Tenaska.  We look forward to your reactions either by email this evening, o=
r
at the initial caucus meeting at 9 a.m tomorrow.  If there are concerns,
will we make adjustments at the caucus.  Thanks.

public utility law.

ANCILLARY SERVICES - THE NEXT FRONTIER

 Since the issuance of Order Nos. 888-889 by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission ("Commission") in 1996, market recognition of the
value of ancillary services provided in this regulatory initiative, has
increased dramatically.  Shortly thereafter, the FERC recognized that
market-based rates could also be provided for certain of these ancillary
services, which include voltage regulation, spinning reserves, non-spinning
reserves and reactive power that were critical elements of historically
bundled service.  This regulatory recognition was intended to serve as a
stimulus for market penetration and development of ancillary services in a
competitive marketplace.  With the formation of independent system operators
(ISOs) and the consideration of movement to regional transmission
organizations (RTOs), ancillary services have received increased discussion
and attention.  Frequently, markets do not have yet sufficient market makers
to create adequate transparencies in a robust competitive market for certain
services.  For example, because of market deficiencies in California and New
York, ancillary services have come under increased scrutiny.

 This short history and limited development of ancillary services is
about to change with the advent of material consideration of RTOs.  It can
be expected that a revamped Bush-era FERC will finalize most RTO proposals
this summer undertaken by former Chairman James Hoecker and his colleagues
on the Commission.  That process should conclude by the end of 2001 with
increased enforcement and market monitoring, new mechanisms to resolve
disputes, increased resolution of seams management concerns, new
transmission pricing and return policies, and major market validation of
for-profit transcos as the underlying vehicle for regional growth and
development of transmission in the future.

Key Considerations

 This market growth and recognition will not come too quickly given
the continual demise of transmission investment and development by the
regulated utility industry.  Over the past 25 years the utility industry has
whittled away its transmission legacy, with little real growth and
development of the national transmission system to support the advent and
movement to competitive markets which has accelerated since 1988.  Ancillary
services will become a critical element of that market as they become the
future call-waiting, *69, and call-forward services of the electric utility
industry - borrowing from the telephone industry parallels and paradigm from
the prior decade of experience.  Formation of RTOs will provide stronger
market validation and recognition of ancillary services.  This will
necessitate the development of separate pricing, new forms of contracting,
new revised pricing methodologies for those ancillary services through
separate contracts, and pricing opportunities through formal agreements.  In
many instances, agreements still need to be developed for ancillary service
sales or need to be materially enhanced in existing service agreements with
the electric utility.  Several areas require current consideration at this
time to ensure a smooth and effective transition:

* Interconnection agreements should fully anticipate the separate
provision of ancillary services in their technical review of a generating
facility and requirements for that facility with the electric utility.
* The interface of utility systems with control areas and RTO's need
further understanding and management for risks, liabilities and cost
consequences.
* Recognition for adequate compensation and market-based pricing for
ancillary services should be provided with the opportunity to supplement
that pricing with amended and restated schedules in relevant agreements.
* Transition of existing transmission and interconnection agreements
to the RTOs should be contemplated in current agreements.  Assignment of
those agreements should only be permitted with appropriate notice and review
rights by the generator, and the opportunity to accept, amend or reject the
terms of that assignment or transfer depending on whether it provides for
enhanced sale and market development opportunities for the market value of
ancillary services.
* There are other ancillary services yet to unfold that have not been
recognized by Order Nos. 888-889 and they should be analyzed and evaluated.
Any specificity that can be undertaken to capture recognition of those
future services, including development and pricing opportunities for those
services, should be separately retained in existing agreements now.
Otherwise, the spectre exists that those services may ultimately be provided
to the regulated utility at no charge.
Future Course of Action
Why has this occurred?  Individual utilities managing the needs of their
systems - with the public utility obligation to serve and paramount
reliability responsibilities were not willing to separately recognize the
value of ancillary services.  Bundled service also disguised this value and
did not provide an adequate and accurate platform for such recognition.
Utility divestitures of generation resources started the ball running.
Moreover, utilities operating in a monopoly, cost-of-service regime did not
have the incentive or ability to seek out new revenue streams through
creative unbundling and repackaging of ancillary services.  With the
evolution to RTOs and broader scope and markets, a shift will be undertaken
in the provision of ancillary services, such as security, emergency
planning, risk management, and reliability from discrete utility systems to
all potential players in the competitive market, including generators,
regulated utilities, transmitting utilities, power marketers and traders and
large scale industrial and commercial users.  This restructuring of the
market also provides an enhanced opportunity to assess the delivery of
critical ancillary services, their recognition as a matter of contract, and
the appropriate elements of market-based rates and cost of service analysis
(as applicable) and new methodologies justifying pricing for these new,
essential products.

 Enlightened generators and developers will be thoughtfully analyzing
this issue at this time with the goal of protecting their interests in
anticipation of the evolution of these ancillary services as part of
competitive markets, which will allow them to capture contracting and
pricing opportunities for the benefit of their owners or shareholders.

Dear Colleague:

The Edison Electric Institute just published a report I wrote on Real-Time 
Balancing Operations and Markets: Key to Competitive Wholesale Electricity 
Markets. The report is available from the Publications page of my website, 
www.EHirst.com. Here is a summary of the report:

Electricity production and consumption must occur at essentially the same 
time. Therefore, real-time (minute-to-minute) operations and the associated 
markets and prices are essential ingredients of a competitive wholesale 
electricity industry. In addition, these intrahour markets are the foundation 
of all forward markets and contracts, including hour- and day-ahead markets, 
monthly futures, and bilateral contracts. Finally, these intrahour operations 
maintain system reliability by ensuring that enough and the right kinds of 
supply and demand resources are available when needed. 

Because of various load, generation, and transmission factors, balancing 
generation to load on a minute-to-minute basis is complicated. Loads are 
volatile, both from hour to hour and from minute to minute during the morning 
rampup and evening dropoff. Generators differ substantially in their costs of 
electricity production. In addition, generators have various idiosyncratic 
characteristics, such as maximum and minimum output levels and maximum 
ramprates, that limit their ability to respond rapidly to changes in system 
load or generation. Finally, transmission characteristics affect the 
real-time balancing function because of congestion and sudden transmission 
outages. These factors can lead to dramatic and rapid changes in electricity 
prices, including occasional negative prices when generators pay someone to 
take their output.

The early years of operations by independent system operators (ISOs), based 
on the experiences in New England, New York, and California, show how 
difficult it is to translate the theory and initial design of competitive 
markets into ones that work efficiently. These ISOs have been plagued with 
various startup problems that artificially raise electricity costs to 
consumers, implicitly encourage strategic bidding by some generators, do not 
sufficiently discipline generator market power, sometimes yield insufficient 
resources, and impair reliability. Fortunately, the ISOs have been quick to 
identify and remedy flaws in their initial market designs. On the other hand, 
the ISOs have done a poor job of documenting these problems and their 
resolutions.

This report is primarily a primer on how such intrahour operations and 
markets should work. It demonstrates these principles through several 
examples. These examples deal with generator ramprate limits, low-operating 
limits, startup costs, and other generator characteristics. Other examples 
show how energy-limited (e.g., hydro) units differ in their bidding and 
operations from capacity-constrained (e.g., thermal) units, how the 
consideration of multiple time intervals affects operations and pricing, how 
generators located outside the control area are treated differently from 
those within the control-area boundary, how interval pricing combined with 
hourly settlements can encourage generators to ignore dispatch signals, and 
how intermittent resources (such as wind) affect control-area operations. 

Although U.S. wholesale competitive markets today suffer from a variety of 
problems, there is reason to be optimistic. Ultimately, the ISOs (and, later 
on, RTOs) will identify and fix the problems within their market structures, 
and they will adequately document their problems and the associated 
resolutions so that their market participants and the designers of other 
systems can learn from past mistakes. Ultimately, efficient real-time markets 
should allow reliability councils and system operators to largely replace 
command-and-control rules with market signals (i.e., prices that vary rapidly 
in response to changes in system security). These changes should lower the 
costs of maintaining reliability; deploy supply and demand resources more 
efficiently; and guide investments in new generation, transmission, and 
demand-side resources.

On May 16, FERC clarified its policy regarding credits for network upgrades 
associated with the interconnection of a generating facility -- all network 
upgrade costs (the cost of all facilities from the point where the generator 
connects to the grid), including those necessary to remedy short-circuit and 
stability problems, should be credited back to the customer that funded the 
upgrades once the delivery service begins.

Once a customer signs up for transmission, then the transmission provider is 
limited to charging the higher of the expansion cost or an embedded cost rate.

Generally, Enron has not procured transmission at the time of interconnection 
and therefore, may be required to pay the network upgrades at the time of 
interconnection; however, the order clarifies that a credit should be 
available to the interconnecting customer or a third party that contracts for 
transmission away from the generator.

ISO New England and PJM Interconnection Propose a
Standard Market Design for Wholesale Electricity Markets

March 29, 2001 - HOLYOKE, MA -  Two of the country's leading wholesale
electricity market administrators, ISO New England Inc. and PJM
Interconnection, L.L.C., together with ALSTOM ESCA Corporation, a systems
developer for electric utilities, today announce their intent to formalize
an agreement that will not only standardize their electricity markets, but
will lead, they believe, to the standardization of wholesale electricity
markets across the country.

Today, ISO New England delivered a letter to the Chairman and Commissioners
of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), enclosing a report
concerning its proposed comprehensive wholesale market program that combines
salient features of the PJM market model with elements of its own existing
wholesale market design.  The combination would create a standardized
wholesale market structure called the Standard Market Design for wholesale
electricity markets ("Standard Market Design").

ISO New England, ALSTOM ESCA and PJM, acting through its wholly-owned
subsidiary, PJM Technologies Inc., have agreed to proceed with the
negotiation of an agreement where ISO New England will purchase the existing
PJM market design and certain software components from ALSTOM ESCA and PJM.
The two ISOs and ALSTOM ESCA will work together to create a standardized
market design that includes solutions to reserve markets and a common
solution to unit dispatch.

"This new market standard should put into place the necessary market
improvements more quickly and at a reduced cost than if we were to implement
a customized market system for New England," said William W. Berry, Chairman
and Acting CEO of ISO New England.  "Now is the time to stop the
experimentation.  Ultimately, we hope the Standard Market Design will serve
as the benchmark for wholesale electricity marketplaces across the country,
if not around the world."

"PJM is very excited to further standardize a design for a competitive
wholesale electricity market," said Phillip G. Harris, Chairman and CEO of
PJM. "Along with the progress in the implementation of the PJM West concept,
this initiative will provide an even broader standardized market design."

This approach should further expedite the elimination of trading barriers
across different markets and promote FERC's goal of creating a seamless
marketplace.  "We intend to continue to work with the New York ISO on issues
of mutual importance," stated Mr. Berry.  "This new market design, together
with our efforts to address the market "seams" and other coordination
issues, will eventually bring the three northeast ISO markets closer
together."  ISO New England and the New York ISO will continue to work
together on these issues under a joint board resolution passed on January
16, 2001.

"Because of our geographic location, New York is in the center of the
Northeast markets, with ISO New England, PJM and IMO each on one of our
borders.  We support the continued elimination of barriers across Northeast
trading markets to develop a more seamless marketplace where everyone will
benefit," said William J. Museler, President and CEO of the New York
Independent System Operator. "The New York ISO will continue to work with
our neighboring markets to remove barriers to trading across the region and
to move towards larger regional markets."

This proposed market design standard will be developed jointly with
stakeholder input. ISO New England will propose the Standard Market Design
to the New England Conference of Public Utility Commissioners and the New
England Power Pool in a series of meetings next week.  Additional meetings
will be conducted in the next few weeks. The Standard Market Design for New
England will be subject to FERC approval.

"Standardization requires consistent and reliable technology to facilitate a
market's efficiency.  A market that moderates price fluctuations and
encourages investment based on an expected return is an efficient market --
and efficiency is the key to establishing market liquidity," said Alain
Steven, CEO of ALSTOM ESCA.  "In the future, this agreement will be viewed
as a catalyst in establishing more robust electricity markets."

ISO New England Inc. is the not-for-profit corporation responsible for the
day-to-day reliable operation of New England's bulk generation and
transmission systems with an installed capacity of almost 26,000 megawatts.
In addition to operating the bulk power grid, ISO New England is the
administrator of the region's wholesale electricity marketplace and the Open
Access Transmission Tariff on behalf of the New England Power Pool. ISO New
England is based in Holyoke, Massachusetts.

The PJM Interconnection, L.L.C., is an Independent System Operator,
administering the PJM Open Access Transmission Tariff and operating the PJM
Energy Markets and Capacity Markets. PJM currently administers the largest
wholesale electricity market in the world and has a membership of more than
200. It is headquartered in Norristown, Pennsylvania. PJM Technologies, Inc.
is a wholly-owned subsidiary of PJM Interconnection, L.L.C., designed to
respond to market opportunities by bringing cost-effective, reliable
solutions to the energy marketplace. It was created to commercialize PJM's
knowledge capital, experience, and proven success in electric energy
markets, system operations, and applications development.

Attached are draft RTO comments.  The comments reflect EPMI's views on RTO development, given the Commission's apparent recent changes in position on the number of RTOs to be created.  We urge Right Sized RTOs without choosing a number.  


The comments reflect input from Christi, Dave Perrino, Steve Walton, Mike Roan, Andy and Charles.  Please review the sections where you have had input to make sure we adequately reflected your points, but please also review the entire document and let us know your thoughts.

I'm still filling in cites and Bernadette will be working on the formatting, but the document is hopefully in pretty good shape.  There is no filing deadline for these comments, but we would like to submit them on Monday if possible.  It shouldn't take more than an hour to review.  In sending your comments, please "Reply to All" so everyone receives your comments.  

Thanks for everyone's help.

Susan:  we should also have Kevin review the comments

Alan:  Tim should probably review the comments as well, but check with Dave and Steve to see if the "LMP in the West" argument is correct before you show him the comments.

The following are a few summaries of recent New England orders.  Please let=
=20
us know if you have any questions.

FERC Approves NEPOOL's Three-Part Bids

On April 25, FERC approved NEPOOL=01,s proposal to implement a system where=
=20
generators can submit three-part supply offers consisting of a start-up=20
price, an hourly no-load price, and an incremental energy price.  NEPOOL al=
so=20
proposed that when a supplier=01,s total revenues over a day from the energ=
y and=20
operating reserves markets were less than its total bid costs, the shortfal=
l=20
would be paid to the supplier as net commitment period compensation (NCPC)=
=20
uplift.  There was disagreement within NEPOOL as to who will pay these upli=
ft=20
costs.

In approving NEPOOL=01,s three-part bid system, FERC finds that the system =
is=20
consistent with the policies in place in New York and PJM.  With regard to=
=20
NCPC uplift cost allocation, FERC finds that NEPOOL=01,s exiting method of=
=20
allocating NCPC uplift costs broadly, based on electrical load, is=20
appropriate since it is difficult to determine who causes what amount of=20
uplift costs.  The new three-part bid system will take effect July 1, 2001.

FERC Rejects Proposal to Disclose Bidding Information

In an April 13 FERC order of no overall interest to us, FERC includes a=20
discussion about the rules for disclosure of bidding and other data gathere=
d=20
by the ISO.  Braintree had argued that FERC should require public disclosur=
e=20
of bidding and other data in order to allow NEPOOL participants to monitor=
=20
the actions of others.  FERC rejected Braintree=01,s arguments, finding tha=
t=20
FERC=01,s rules strike an appropriate balance between the need to disclose =
as=20
much information as possible and the desire to avoid disclosure requirement=
s=20
that will make it more difficult for the ISO to obtain information from=20
market participants in the first place.  FERC states that because data=20
collection is critical to the ISO=01,s ability to monitor the NEPOOL market=
s, it=20
does not want to take action that would impede the ISO=01,s ability to coll=
ect=20
this information.

Information Policy

NEPOOL submitted a March 5, 2001 request for revisions to NEPOOL=01,s=20
Information Policy, to be effective May 5, 2001, which permits FERC to obta=
in=20
NEPOOL Participant confidential information directly from ISO-NE.  On April=
=20
25, 2001, FERC issued an order approving the filing.  FERC stated that ISO-=
NE=20
should be able to turn over confidential information to FERC without first=
=20
being required to notify the affected member of receipt of a request for=20
information.  However, the Commission notes that the information given to=
=20
FERC will be treated confidentially by FERC until FERC rules otherwise, and=
=20
those Participants' whose information is given to FERC will retain the=20
opportunity to oppose release of that information to the general public=20
before FERC makes the information public.

Market Monitor Information Collection

ISO filed revised procedures intended to give ISO the authority to monitor=
=20
for generator physical and economic withholding as a way to raise prices. =
=20
Under the revised procedures, a reference price is calculated for each 10MW=
=20
block for each generating unit.  The specific reference price is an average=
=20
of in-merit bids over the last 30 days.  ISO will investigate all bids that=
=20
deviate significantly from the reference price. =20

Under the ISO's proposed procedures, prospective mitigation will occur if I=
SO=20
determines that the bid will have a significant effect on the relevant mark=
et=20
clearing price or uplift payment and the generator cannot adequately justif=
y=20
why its bid is not anti-competitive.  If a bid is mitigated, ISO will=20
substitute the generator=01,s reference price as its default bid.  ISO will=
=20
implement these new mitigation measures on July 1.  ISO also proposed to=20
release bid data after a 3 months delay (FERC previously ordered ISO to=20
release bid data after a 6 month delay).

Many generators opposed the procedures; Braintree argued they do not go far=
=20
enough.  On April 26, FERC accepted ISO=01,s changes, finding that they do =
not=20
give ISO too much discretion and are consistent with NYISO mitigation=20
procedures.  FERC rejected ISO=01,s proposal to release data 3 months=20
after-the-fact and directed ISO to wait 6 months before release.

Jim asked me to send to you the attached filing we submitted in the three 
northeast RTO dockets (PJM, New York and New England) urging FERC to 
consolidate the three RTOs into one based on the PJM market design structure.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
