Debra,
 Please prepare another Master.  Deal should be identical to the one we did 
for your buddy.  That one was between ENA and ECT Merchant Investment Corp. 
This one should be with Brazos VPP Limited Partnership, a Texas limited 
partnership, and ENA. Check with Teresa regarding the ownership of Brazos.

Gary,  
 Please review the foregoing to see if it is your understanding of the deal.  
We have no documentation from Shell Chemical Company to evidence their 
assignment of the contract to Shell Chemical L.P., so I have left the 
Transaction under Shell Chemical Company.  I assume that you are have Steve

Okay, I wasn't sure who to route this to, but one of our traders gave Claire 
Neri at UGI my name and number to help with information about our contracts. 
As it turns out, we do not have a Master Contract with UGI but have a firm 
term deal  attached to a GTC (Deal #345010, running from 11/1/00 - 3/31/01, 
5380 MMBTu/day @ $4.78, meter #103702 on ANR).

UGI's hope is to get a Master agreement in place ASAP to cover the above 
mentioned deal & any new inter gas deals (since she sent their master, I'm 
assuming that their intent is to put their master in place ASAP). Claire Neri 
can be reached at 610-796-3505 for additional information of 
changes/negotiations. 

Note: UGI is also an EOL "Investment Grade" counterparty for non-Texas natual 
gas.

 Two items regarding the Panther deal.   What is meant by "Greenhouse

this point, is it currently in existence, if so, how was it put in, who was 
the deal maker for the installation, etc.  After this information is

Attached is the revised amendment quickly redrafted in  an attempt to assist 
PQPC.  The amendment has nothing to do with the 1996 letter which was totally 
superseded by the new fuel supply arrangements.  It is strictly an 
accommodation to PQPC without the benefit of any consideration to EPOS.

 You know the answer.  Can you call the central desk for the price for spot 
gas to be sold to Heartland.  I spoke with Sylvia Pollan and she was to get 
back to me.

Charles,
 Can you redo the statement for physical gas through the 23rd and include a 
line item for the Mark-to-market true-up value as a result of the termination 
triggered by their bankruptcy filing.  Jason R Williams of the Credit group 
was to redo the termination payment amount.

Mary,
 I see that Phil Bair from JWorthan has responded to Phil DeMoes concerning 
the bond term.  No comments were made concerning the legal opinion for the 
legal counsel for the bond provider.  I was going to suggest that the 
contract language be modified to provide that the Company had a reasonable 
amount of time at the end of the lst 5 yr bond term to provide a substitute 
bond for the remaining term and that if the Company was able to get a 
replacement bond in place before the expiration of such period, no default 
would occur.  Can you tell from the letter that Phil Bair is proposing if 
their are any other issues that either ENRON or the Bond Provider would have 
concerning the terms of the Bond and the Customer's methods of getting 
funding thereunder.

Dan,

Take a look at this letter prepared by our surety provider on the PEAK 
pre-pay.  In particular, note the last paragraph.  I'm concerned on the 
unwind if there is a default.   We plan to meet tomorrow with Joe Deffner and 
Breese tomorrow morning.  Are you available?

Phil-Attached is a first round draft of a reference letter for the PEAK 
project.  Please review and let me know what changes are suggested.

I've made calls to several of the major sureties this morning to re-confirm 
the availability of long term/non-cancellable bonds.  Five years is the 
general ceiling.  We need to be careful  PEAK understands that if the surety 
elects not to renew at the end of the first five years, this does not trigger 
an automatic demand against the bond.  PEAK should already know the issues 
involved from the surety side based on previous negotiations they had with 
other energy marketers when this project was negotiated (without success) 
last fall.  This is not an Enron issue-it goes to commercial availability.

Call me with your comments.  Thanks.

All of the assignment documents are supposed to be filed in the contract 
file.  Please review the contract file for these assignment effective dates.  
The date something is invoiced has nothing to do with the tariff filings, 
what is important is the delivery period and terms.  imbalance cashouts 
should be reported as such under the transport tariff, not a sales tariff, 
unless the transport does not provide for cash-out in which case a separate 
sales tariff needs to be set up to go with the Sales Contract which should be 
in the contract file.  Do you agree?

		 Subject: Missing Tariff Numbers on HPL Annual Report



Dan:  The following sales contracts were listed on the HPL Annual Report 
without a tariff number.  

Would you review the following information and advise as to whether a sales 
tariff filing is required.  It appears that the transactions related to these 
sales contracts took place prior to the time the contracts were assigned to 
Houston Pipe Line Company.  Let me know if the tariffs we prepared to respond 
to the Auditors query, should truly be included with our November 10th TRRC 
Tariff Filing Report..

Contract #96022611:  H&D Operating Company - Gas Lift Sales:  Delivery period 
01/99 Invoiced 9/10/99; Delivery period 02/99 Invoiced 10/12/99.   HPL needs 
sales tariff for period after assignment.

Contract #96019866:  OXY USA. Inc. - Imbalance Cashout Contract: Delivery 
period 03/99; Demand Charge Invoiced 3/26/99.  Why shouldn't this be under 
the transport tariff for this transport imbalance.

Contract #96022610: Preferred Pipeline Company - GTC Sale Spot: Delivery 
period 01/99 and 02/99; Invoiced 08/27/99. Who issued the GTC, if HPL, then 
HPL needs to file a sales tariff.

Contract #96019865: Texcol Gas Services Inc. - Imbalance Cashout Contract 
(Contract was set up per Tommy Yanowski relating to the imbalance on 
Terminated Transport Agreement 12-88974-204  (311a2(284C)Offshore Tx); 
Delivery period 02/99; Invoiced 03/25/99. Cashout under 311transport should 
not require a tariff filing, however, it may require a FERC filing.

Contract #9600821: HPL Resources Company - Master Purchase Sale Firm.
Delivery period 01/99, Invoiced 02/12/99
Delivery period 02/99, Invoiced 03/24/99
Delivery period 04/99, Invoiced 06/10/99; 09/10/99
Accounting Summary Report of Manual Invoices recorded in the G/L for 01/99, 
03/99, 04/99, 05/99, 06/99, 07/99, 09/99, 10/99, 11/99 and  12/99.
Do you know when this contract came back to HPL and should the tariff reflect 
activity that took place prior to when it was assigned to HPL?  This 
information should be in the contract file.  The tariff should not  reflect 
activity prior to the time the contract was assigned to HPL.
 
I will need to get final information to Carla Nguyen by Monday October 30 so 
she can make the appropriate notations to the annual report pages 31a2, 31a3 
and 31a4.

Thanks for all your help!

Russell,
 Regarding their first point, we should only guarantee amounts that are 
covered by our contracts.  Non contract amounts should not be subject the the 
guarantee, incoming or outgoing.  
 Remember that we need to keep the guaranty amounts specific as to each enron 
entity.  This is because the part that pertains to Houston Pipe Line Company 
will need to be deleted from the guaranty and a separate guaranty from HPL's 
new parent will need to take its place.  
 Somehow we need them to accept buyin on the fact that the new guarantee will 
not be effective until the old guaranty has been superceded, even if this 
takes the action of their spun off entity.

Clement,
 Do you agree?

Clement, Dan,

Below is an e-mail from my counterpart at Coastal with comments to the 
revised Enron Corp draft that Clement provided to me in his e-mail on Dec.. 
21st.  Can each of you please review these concerns.  If the Master will not 
be executed until after their merger with El Paso, I think it is OK to accept 
a Unified guaranty cap instead of specifif limits.  I was origninally thought 
the reason for the specific dollar limits was because of Contracts.

Thanks
Russell

Subject: RE: Pending Guaranty for Physical Business




Russell, 

We looked at the revised redline on the Enron physical business sent by you 
on Dec 21st 00. 

We have the following important comments: 

(1) The first page of the Guaranty refers to specific Contracts that will be 
covered by the Guaranty and one identified Contract is the Enfolio Master 
Firm Purchase/ Sale Agreement.? As you are aware, this Contract has not been 
signed between Coastal Merchant Energy and Enron companies and will not 
probably be signed (if and) until our pending merger is completed.? Therefore 
we request that the Guaranty language be broadened to include all Obligations 
of the Enron entities to CME (and not be Contract specific).

(2)The third page of the Guaranty discusses Maximum Limit (Section 2) and 
sets specific numerical caps for each of the covered Enron entities.? We had 
requested for a unified Cap earlier and once again request that a unified Cap 
be set for all entities.? 

(3)The fifth page of the Guaranty (Section 9), says that this Guaranty will 
supersede the Old Guaranty that was issued jointly to Engage US and Engage 
Canada.? As you are aware, we are not affiliated or connected with Engage 
Canada and therefore cannot bind Engage Canada whatsoever in the proposed 
Guaranty.? That was the rationale for our insert in that paragraph ("insofar 
as it respects Contract Party").? This was deleted in your revised redline.

We are anxious to complete this Guaranty as soon as possible.? We suggest, if 
it is necessary, a conference call involving ourselves and our Counsel.

Please respond at your earliest convenience. 

Thanks 
Kiran

Michael,
 I have reviewed the assignment documennt.  I intend to make two changes 
which I hope you make in the copies that the other parties are signing.  
These being that the Assignment be effective as of April 1, 2001 and the left 
over reference to Alberta be deleted from Enron North America Corp.'s 
address.  I will attach Transaction No. 1 to the Assignment Document and have 
it executed by Enron.  If you will provide me with the fax numbers for each 
party, I will fax to these numbers.  My fax number is (713)646-3490.

Not with all of their changes.  We were going back to our original language 
relating to representations and implied warranties.  Otherwise, I believe 
that their language only deleted reference to a Texas law designed to protect 
individuals from big business making improper warranties, i.e. triple damages 
for little guy, big guy only gets his damages.

Phil DeMoes asked if we could put together a contract with these folks.  I 
was going done the route of the master because he thought that they would 
want to buy from us and sell to their commercial customers.  In reviewing the 
attached information, they appear to be doing something more intuned to 
putting the parties together.  Is this similar to the deals that Travis and

Debra,
 I have looked over the cancelled GISB that CES tried to put in place with 
FGU.  Nothing in there of note.  Therefore, please prepare our standard GISB, 
do not use any of their language.  When it is ready, please email to Michelle 
Klein and to Jared Kaiser .

Dan,

ENA and FGU currently operate under an interruptible agreement inherited 
through the CES purchase.  FGU has interest in getting a GISB in place with 
the attached provisions.  Could you please review and let me know you 
comments.  I would like to complete this process quickly.

Jared,
As we discussed earlier today, FGU is interested in purchasing firm supply at 
a fixed price for summer and/or winter.  Currently, Enron and FGU only have 
an interruptible contract in place for supply purchases.  In order to get a 
firm contract in place in a short amount of time, I think we should execute a 
GISB contract if Enron is acceptable to that.  I have attached two word 
documents to be implemented into the GISB contract.  One is FGU's general 
information and the other is our special provisions.  Please have your 
contract department implement the attached information into a GISB contract 
and have it sent to me for review and execution.  If your contract department 
has any questions, please have them call me at 352-334-0776.
Thank you!
Michelle

Enjoyed having lunch.  I got back and Time Warner was available for my zip 
code, so I signed up for Time Warner Road Runner internet service.  The price 
is $15.00 per month plus installation.  I will let you know when it is hooked 
up.  Are you sure that you want to come back to the rat race.  It has to be a 
lot of fun staying home and playing with the baby.  That will all change if 
you decide to come back to work.  See you.

Janet,
 Two items regarding the Panther deal.   What is meant by "Greenhouse 
requirements"?  New delivery point, can be get a better description about 
this point, is it currently in existence, if so, how was it put in, who was 
the deal maker for the installation, etc.  After this information is 
provided, I see no reason why this shouldn't be documented by the confirm 
desk using a standard    GTC confirm.

As we discussed this morning, I have reviewed the subject agreement that you 
faxed to me.  As I indicated yesterday, if I had been provided to agreement 
for approval by HPL, I would have approved it for execution.  I still feel 
that we should always have a waiver of consequential damages provision in the 
agreements, however, as I indicated to Mitch, the risk of such damages is 
very minimal.  I think the resolution that you, Stacey and Mitch worked out 
by changing the term to monthly is excellent.  This will allow you to replace 
the agreement in the future when TXU has developed it new form.  Please call 
me if you need anything further regarding this matter.

Per the request of Alan Kilpatrick, I am forwarding to you Southern's
comments on your proposed confidentiality agreement.  As you can see,
they are almost entirely editorial and relate to the inclusion of
seemingly duplicative provisions.  The one substantive point is that we
do not agree to venue provisions, although we will agree in this case to
Texas choice of law.

Please let us know if these changes are acceptable in advance of the
Thursday meeting.

Richard,
 The GTC is okay to send out for this deal; however, please note the change 
that must be made to the Delivery Point for this deal.  Call if you have any 
questions.
 In the future please advise Barbara Gray of any supply deals at points where 
an interconnection with HPL is possible, excluding EOL transactions of less 
than one month.

Anne,
 I have incorporated the changes you requested in the above confirmations.  
We deleted the language "and Enron confirms the nomination" in the third 
paragraph of OTHER in the Spot Confirm and replaced it with "and Enron 
receives the notification of the nomination at least 30 minutes prior to the 
1st GISB nomination cycle deadline,".  
 If these are in order, please print 2 originals of each, have them signed, 
and forward them to Grand Oh at the Calgary office for his follow-up so that 
they can be executed by Enron.  
 Please do not hesitate to call if you have any further questions.

Dan

I did two gas deals with Oxy Vinyls LP, and repeated a Keep Ready Agreement
with Occidental Chemical.


For the gas deals, we can use the same special purpose GTC that we used
last year (it is unique to Oxy).  Here are the deals:

Document used last year: o:\Legal\DHYVL\DJH\2000\Ltr\2000-39crfm.doc
5,000 MMBtu per day
Battleground Road plant HPL meter # 1485
Inside FERC Houston Ship Channel index minus $0.0075
July 1, 2001 to June 30, 2002

Document used last year: o:\Legal\DHYVL\DJH\2000\Ltr\2000-39acrfm.doc
5,000 MMBtu per day
La Porte plant HPL meter # 1444
Inside FERC Houston Ship Channel index minus $0.0075
July 1, 2001 to June 30, 2002


For the Keep Ready Agreement, everything is the same as last year .....

Document used last year: o:\Legal\DHYVL\DJH\2000\Ltr\2000-47ltr.doc
Term June 1, 2001 to May 31, 2002
One change ... at the end of Section 4, need to delete the last 5 words "OR
THE BILL OF SALE" .... we had come up with this agreement by adapting
another one, and had to manually strike these words because they are not
relevant.


Thanks

Lee

Subject: Haldor Topsoe

Darren,
I am going to send three options to Haldor Topsoe to choose from; all three 
will require a master physical:
 1) Leave current deal at 125% Index and add 1200 mmbtu/d new volumes through 
8/31/2002 @ 115% Index
 2) Price existing deal and new volumes through 8/31/2002 @ 120% Index
 3)  Show a variety of floors and collars to reduce the index percentage 
through 8/31/2002 for all volumes.
I believe I have approval for these three options.  MTM value for all options 
should calculate to be around $230,000.

However, now is an outstanding time to increase the value to Enron by 
extending this deal another two years and hence doubling the MTM value.  They 
will not transact at  these levels two years from now without us having to 
put facilities in the ground.  Please consider a two year extension or tell 
me what requirements would have to be met to do this.

Thanks,

Gary

Gary,
 As I stated before, I will forward a new worksheet to Dan Hyvl for JER/BRE, 
but we are NOT to enter into another transaction until the document is 
executed. Seeing as JER wanted to fix a price this week, I think that it will 
be difficult to get this deal completed. Please follow up with Wayne at JER.
 In addition, I am forwading a worksheet for Haldor Topsoe as well. We can 
NOT enter into the new transaction with additional volumes with them until 
their master is signed as well. 

If you have any questions please call.

Hey Dan, Gary,

Gary entered into this transation to sell this counterparty 1,000 mmbtu/d at 
an Index related price with a Put option of $3.50 and a premium of 0.095.  As 
I understand it, Gary will never be buying gas from his counterparty and this 
is the only transaction he plans on doing with the counterparty.  If this is 
the case, I would think only a Master Sales agreement would be needed instead 
of a Master Purchase Sale Agreement and thus a Credit Worksheet is not 
needed. Please let me know if this is not the case.

Thanks
Russell

Dan, 

Thanks for looking at this for me.  I did remove the phrase you mention in 
number 1 below.  As for a volume cap, I don't think that one is necessary in 
this case.  Their TW contract limits them to 1000 MMBtu/day.  Any prices that 
are fixed will not include TW transport charges.

Thanks again,

Kim

ps, once their board approves this term sheet, we will need to do a 
confirmation.  Will this be generated by you or when the deal is entered into 
the system?

 I have reviewed your term sheet and have the following questions.  
1.  Under Term, you have included the phrase "with annual redetermination" 
however I find no redetermination language in the Price  section.  I would 
suggest that the phrase be deleted.
2.  Under Quantity, you indicate there expected volumes, however, we need to 
put some cap on the maximum, With a 5 year term, we should offer some maximum 
such as 200% of the expected volumes.  Any thoughts relating to a cap?
3.  Under Price you indicate that the price could be changed to a Fixed 
Price, I assume that you do not intend to include the Transwestern 
transportation charges as a part of the Fixed Price.  Is this correct?  and 
if so, does the Fixed Price language need to be qualified?  
 Otherwise, the term sheet appears okay.

I believe that the Crestar deal is almost finalized.  According to my 
records, Transaction Number NV8176/370753 was partially documeted with a GTC 
confirm (2000-087crfm.doc attached) dated January 4, 2001.  This covers a 
firm sale of 21,100 MMBtu by Crestar to ENA for the period November 1, 2000 
through October 31, 2001.  The remainder of Transaction Number NV8176/370753 
has been documented with two GTC confirms (2001-023crfm.doc and 
2001-023acrfm.doc also attached) dated March 22, 2001 (Revised).  
2001-023crfm covers the firm sale of 0 - 8,260 MMBtu per day for the period 
November 1, 2000 through October 31, 2001 and 2001-023acrfm covers the firm 
sale of 0 -11,740 MMBtu per day, also for the period November 1, 2000 through 
October 31, 2001.  By assignment agreement (Crestar assignment.doc attached) 
dated effective as of April 1, 2001, Crestar assigned 2001-023acrfm to BP 
Canada Energy Marketing Corp.   
Ellen Wallumrod has requested that documentation be provided to her to enable 
her to rebook the portion documented by 2001-023acrfm for the period 4/01/01 
- 10/31/01 as a result of the assignment.  Please provide Ellen with the 
necessary paperwork or forward to the party who needs to provide her with the 
necessary paperwork.

Christian,
 I received your email when I got back this morning.  Yes I had a great 
holiday.  Hopefully yours was the same.  Our Credit group has agreed to 
changing the collateral threshold from 10MM to 15MM for both parties.  Please 
make that change in the contract in section 4.5 in each of the places where 
10MM is located, print 2 originals of each, have them signed, and forward to 
me for further handling with Enron North America Corp.

Mr. Hyvl,

Happy New Year!  Hope you enjoyed the holidays.  Did you have a chance to
see if we could raise the threshold of $10 million for a Letter of Credit?
(see message below)

I agree.  The Accounting Dept. informed me that there are two days that
sometimes land on the 25th that CPS considers a holiday.  One is the day
after Thanksgiving and the other is during Fiesta for the Battle of Flowers
Parade.  I requested that they just pay a day early if the 25th lands on one
of these CPS holidays.

I have one more request, however.  In 4.5. Collateral
Requirement/Termination Payment Threshold, could you raise the threshold of
$10 million for a Letter of Credit to $15 or $20 million (whatever you feel
comforable with)?

Christian,
     I believe this is covered because the language states that if the 25th
is not a
Business Day, the payment will be due the next Business Day.  Business Day
is a defined term as a day when the Federal Reserve Banks is New York are
open for business.  I cannot agree to a Customer's Business Day because it
is not a defined term and may differ from the standard definition of
Business Day.  Therefore that change should not be incorporated.  Do you
agree?

Mr. Hyvl,

There was one change that you did not make that I requested.  It was
difficult to tell since only a single word was bolded.

APPENDIX "1"  FINANCIAL MATTERS  BILLING, INVOICE DATE, CHARGES AND PAYMENT

"Buyer shall remit any amounts due on the 25th day of the Month in which
Seller's statement was received.  If the due date for any payment to be
made
under this Agreement is not a Customer's Business Day, the due date for
such
payment shall be the following Customer's Business Day."

There are very few instances where our Business Day would be different from
your business day.  However, as an example, the day after Thanksgiving is a
CPS holiday.  This year, we had a gas payment due on that date which we
sent
on the following Monday.  This is probably the only holiday CPS has that
your company may not have.

Unfortunately, we don't have a purchase order issued yet so I can't give
you
a number.  I know that would make it easier for you guys, but I don't think
we can issue one until right before the first gas purchase.  First, a
purchase requisition needs to be issued.  Then, a purchase order will be
released following approvals by the various individuals authorized to sign
off on them.

Dave,
     As we discussed, the change that you made referring to the index for
the applicable delivery point is okay because the Index for Enron Online is
the Midpoint price in Gas Daily for the location closet to the relevant

please finalize the amendment, have it signed and forward to me for
execution by Enron.

Attached please find a red-line of the changes for the referenced proposal.  
Please review and let me have your comments.  I had to start from scratch.   
I limited this to a single transaction as provided in the proposal.  You may 
recall that you had requested Debra to convert the single proposal into a 
Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement so that it could be utilized by adding 
future transactions by way of a Confirmation Letter.  The short review time 
to get something in place will not permit the global changes which may be 
necessary to cover all the points to make the proposal into a Master.

Dan-

I appreciate the effort you are making and I realize you, and everyone else,
have a lot on your plate.  However, Enron has had a general base contract
since mid-August and a draft Enron-specific contract since mid-September.
We are now 2 weeks from the contract start and you've indicated that a great
deal of work is still needed.

I've reviewed an Enron North America sample contract and I do not see
significant, irresolvable differences.  Furthermore, I had hoped my
voicemail offer to you this morning to remove all references to Locked
Prices would further minimize our differences.  I will be in tomorrow,
except for approximately 9-12, and will be available to discuss our options.
I do not think a GISB contract attached to the term sheet is an acceptable
alternative.  I would be more than happy to come downtown next week and
spend as much time as needed to hammer out the issues.

Thanks in advance for your help.

Karen,
     I have reviewed the redline document that Debra Perlingiere spent time
on.  It is not a finished product and needs a great deal of work.  I will
continue to work on it.  Apparently the redlining must have been confusing
and I need to start fresh.  I will try to get the redline to you as soon as
possible.  If we need to put something in place before the contract is
executed, maybe we can document the transaction under the existing GISB
contract currently in place between the parties and agree that the
transaction will be rolled up under the new master once the Master is
executed.

My last communication with Monica's attorney was that he was satisfied with 
our responses to his request and that he was going to run the contract 
through other groups at the city and would get back to us.  I can insert the 
last wording change in the previous draft that I had provided to the parties 
if you think that will speed up their attorney's signoff.
Attached is the final version of the contract.  Please feel free to forward 
it to Monica.  If they are agreeable, please have them accept the red-line 
changes, print 2 originals, sign and forward to Enron for final execution.

Dan,

What is our status with the Palo Alto Agreement?  According to Monica, they 
are waiting on a final copy with the language that has been agreed to by both 
parties.  She is ready to sign.  I know that we have lost one transaction due 
to paper not being in place.  Can you send me the final document and I will 
forward to Monica?

Also, can we discuss El Paso on Tuesday?

Thanks,

Kim

Dan,

Per the earlier e-mail, Jason's intention was to send this information on 
this transaction to the confirm group, as listed below - Joe Hunter and Janie 
Aquayo.  Jason is a new person in the Credit Group and was responding to a 
transaction that we were looking into for credit approval.  There is no 
additional credit information that is required to be placed in this confirm 
for this transaction, as is occasionally added by your group.

Thanks
Russell

CHOOSING A NEW  BATHING SUIT

Apparently a true e-mail a woman wrote to  her friend after shopping for
a bathing suit.

I have just been through the annual pilgrimage of torture and
humiliation known as buying a bathing suit.  When I  was a child in the
1950's, the bathing suit for a woman with a  mature figure was designed
for a woman with a mature, figure  - boned, trussed and reinforced, not
so much sewn as engineered. They were built to hold back and uplift and
they did a good job.

Today's stretch fabrics are designed for the pre-pubescent  girl with a
figure carved from a potato chip.  The mature  woman has a choice - she
can either front up at the  maternity department and try on a floral
suit with a skirt, coming away looking like a hippopotamus who escaped
from Disney's Fantasia - or she can wander around every run-of-the-mill
department store trying to make a sensible choice from what  amounts to
a designer range of fluorescent rubber bands.

What choice did I have?  I wandered around, made my  sensible choice and
entered the chamber of horrors known as the  fitting room.  The first
thing I noticed was the extraordinary  tensile strength of the stretch
material.

The  Lycra used in bathing costumes was developed, I believe, by NASA to
launch small rockets from a slingshot, which give the added bonus that
if you manage to actually lever yourself into one, you are protected
from shark attacks.  The reason for this is  that any shark taking a
swipe at your passing midriff would  immediately suffer whiplash.

I fought my way into the  bathing suit, but as I twanged the shoulder
strap in place, I  gasped in horror - my bosom had disappeared!
Eventually, I found one bosom cowering under my left armpit.  It took a
while to  find the other.

At last I located it  flattened beside my seventh rib.  The problem is
that   modern bathing suits have no bra cups.  The mature woman is meant
to wear her bosom spread across her chest like a speed  hump.

I realigned my speed hump and lurched toward the  mirror to take a full
view assessment.  The bathing suit fit  all right, but unfortunately, it
only fit those bits of me  willing to stay inside it.  The rest of me
oozed out rebelliously from top, bottom, and sides.  I looked like a
lump of  play dough wearing undersized cling wrap.

As I tried to work out where all those extra bits had come from, the
pre-pubescent sales girl popped head through the curtains, "Oh There you
are!" she said, admiring the bathing suit...I replied that I wasn't so
sure and asked what else she had to show me.

I tried on a cream crinkled one that made me look like a lump  of
masking tape, and a floral two piece which gave the appearance  of an
oversized napkin in a serviette ring.  I struggled into  a pair of
leopard skin bathers with ragged frill and came  out looking like
Tarzan's Jane pregnant with triplets and having a  rough day.

I tried on a black number with a midriff  and looked like a jellyfish in
mourning.  I tried on a bright  pink pair with such a high cut leg I
thought I would have to wax my  eyebrows to wear them.

Finally, I found a suit that  fit...a two piece affair with shorts style
bottom and a loose  blouse-type top.  It was cheap, comfortable, and
bulge  friendly, so I bought it.

When I got home, I read the  label which said "Material may become

transparent in water." I'm  determined to wear it anyway...I'll just
have to stay out of  the water!

While I'm in the process of getting the appropriate information for Mr.

Pls advise.

Dan,

I have not followed through with this guaranty because there is currently a 
multiproduct, multientity guaranty in place for several Aquila entities.  HPL 
is already included in the guarantee.  The guarantee is capped at 
$115,000,000.  Just want to make sure that you are aware of why the request 
was not finalized.  Is this in line with your view?

 Try the transport group, Steve VanHooser, Gerald Nemec, Eric Gillaspie, and 
maybe Shonnie Daniel.  I did not assign any transport contracts, especially

In the Global Contracts database, reference is made to an assignment letter

Ruth,
 Please review to verify that I have included all of your changes.  I believe 
that the language in the first 3 cover us if the last agmt isn't done, 
otherwise, the last one covers the trueup of negative values.  Do you 
concur?  Please let me know if these are okay, and I will get my secretary to 
deliver to you originals on ENA stationary.

Ed,
 We have removed the specific examples of Force Majeure as not being needed 
because the revised 11.2 defines force majeure as an event not anticipated as 
of the date hereof, which is not within the reasonable control of the party 
and which by the exercise of due diligence such party is unable to overcome 
or obtain a commercially reasonable substitute performance thereof, all 
without listing specific types of events which might be considered.
  You are correct in presuming that force majeure cannot be claimed for 
economic purposes which is the reason for the underlined clause in the 
preceding sentence.  By example, assuming that more than one transporter 
could be used to effectuate deliveries to a particular point, if the 
transporter utilized by a party experienced an event of force majeure, the 
Enron revision would require a party to continue performance by obtaining 
transportation on another transporter, irrespective of the cost.  
 I trust that this answers your questions. If not, please feel free to call 
me at (713)853-6895.

Disregard my question about the arbitration process.    AAA selects 5,
Enron/Tea can strike 2 and then AAA can appoint the one arbitrator.   But
even after that, Enron/TEA can challenge AAA selection.   In short, we have
no problem with Enron's arbitration language.

Gisb





Jared,

Our atty suggests we find get clarification on a couple of issues regarding
your amendments:

Special Provision 11.1:  T GISB is already fairly broad in scope "...any
cause not reasonably withing the control of the party claiming
suspension...."  The amendment to 11.2 repeats the same, but removes
specific examples.
1. Why are the specific examples removed?
2. Am I correct in presuming that Enron wants to make it clear that Force
Majuere cannot be claimed for economic purposes?

Special Provision 13.9:  Under the AAA rules, is only one arbitrator
selected from the very beginning, or are a few arbitrators selected
initially, and then each party can pick and choose until eventually there
is only one official arbitrator?   Like a jury selection...sort of.

Thanks,

Ed

Molly,
 When you brought me the resumes last week, you indicated that you had 
screened certain of the applicants and that Janette had certain ideals 
concerning the group.  I have had the resumes reviewed by Harry Collins, 
Carlos Sole, and myself and would like your opinion regarding the following 
applicants:

 Vanessa G. Griffin She is the current temp that is filling in for this 
position.
 Mary G. Martinez Enron employee whose group has been disbanded.
 Esmeralda Gonzales I believe that Mary Cook has talked to her on more than 
one occasion.
 Sheryle E. Malek
 M. Denise Keauquier
 Maggie Valles
 Mary Lou Browder Enron employee whose group has been disbanded.
Additionally, Travis McCullough has been lobbying for us to talk to the temp 
that is currently filling the position for which he has hired his old 
secretary.

 If the foregoing list is okay, we would like to start the interview process 
Wednesday afternoon.  I have suggested to Harry and Carlos, that we jointly 
interview each applicant.  If this is acceptable, I will obtain access to a 
conference room for this purpose.

 Please let me know if there are any problems relating to anyone on the above 
list.

Please see item 8 of the attached GTC.  When the outside party does not 
provide the Gas from an alternate source or fails to take the Gas to an 
alternate market, such event is a default allowing us to collect damages for 
non-performance.  No different than any of our standard Enfolio contracts.  
The current language in our GISB form gets us to the same result.

Sorry to keep bothering you, but does what we talked about earlier pertain to 
EOL trades as well given the language in those contracts, i.e. requiring 
outside parties to honor contracts if they claim "force majeure"?


Thanks,

Mark,
 Jeff is in London and asked me to make the requested changes to the 
Contract.  I have taken the redline version that he previously provided and 
added the additional changes.  The changes that I made were in 4.2 (15 days), 
Art. 5 (deleted "but for no longer period"), and in  Arbitration (added 
language for independent arbitrators based on the amount in controversy), and 
changed (Texas to New York in the 12th line).   I have also attached a clean 
copy which accepted all of the redline changes.  If acceptable, please print 
2 originals of the clean copy, have them signed, fax me a copy of the signed 
signature page at 7136463490, and mail the two signed originals to me.  Once 
I receive the faxed signature page, I will let Jennifer know so that she can 
have any subsequent transactions entered into pursuant to the terms of this 
contract.  Please call me at 7138536895 if you have any questions.

Texas City Facility -
 The relationship between HPL and Calpine has become and continues to be 
strained.  Calpine purchased the Texas City Cogeneration Facility from Enron 
and Dominion Resources in early 1998.  Prior to that time ENA supplied 45,000 
MMBtu of gas under a fixed price contract and a Market Price agreement was in 
place to provide any additional volumes that might be needed in addition to 
that which Union Carbide Corporation had the contractual right to supply 
under the historic arrangement, since they were the steam host for the 
facility.  After Calpine took over, these contracts either expired or were 
terminated.  At this point HPL became the sole supplier to the facility 
although the interconnection with the Union Carbide delivery point with the 
Calpine facility remained active and a new Transaction Agreement was put in 
place whereby Calpine agreed to certain minimum and maximum quantity 
obligations and agreed on the prices that would be paid for any short fall in 
volumes.  Since then, measurement disputes have been alleged and Calpine has 
shortpaid HPL's invoices even after verbally agreeing that the amounts 
invoiced were correct.  Additionally, as a result of Calpine's power 
purchaser's last minute notification to Calpine of reductions in the purchase 
of power for the next day, which notification is usually after Calpine's next 
day notification deadline to HPL, Calpine has resorted to the use of  
creative force majeure situations in an effort to reduce their costs.  These 
notifications have occurred some thirteen (I think) times and Calpine has 
provided little explanation to HPL of the nature of these events of force 
majeure.  When pressed for a more detailed explanation, they merely state 
that they had to take down various unit(s) to repair or replace leaking 
valves, etc.

Clear Lake Facility -
 The relationship between Calpine and HPL is not as strained with regard to 
deliveries at this facility.  This may be because the contract covering the 
base volume of gas being delivered by HPL has not changed since it was 
negotiated by ENA in 1995.  Midcon remains connected to the facility and 
delivers certain quantities of market priced gas.  Market priced gas is 
required by the facility when its requirements exceed the base volumes 
supplied under the 1995 agreement.  Should the power purchase agreement be 
amended to allow Calpine not to deliver powered or should the power purchaser 
cancel the power purchase agreement, Calpine has negotiated an amendment 
allowing for the delivery of the base volumes at alternative delivery 
points.  Currently, HPL has advised Calpine of an upcoming event of force 
majeure which will require a cessation of deliveries of gas to the facility 
which certain regulatory mandated tests are being performed on the A-S 
pipeline.  It is not known whether the Midcon delivery point has the capacity 
to handle the entire facility gas requirements or not.

Barbara,
 Tom Martin called and said it was his understanding that he could buy gas at 
any EOL point such as Exxon Katy, Waha or Carthage for any term and that he 
could resell such gas into HPL.  I explained to him that the EOL carve out 
was for transactions of less than one month.  He asked if you could call him 
if his understanding was incorrect and then he asked if you wouldn't mind 
just calling him to discuss the matter.

Barbara,
 This appears to be supply deal for deliveries at Katy that would be subject 
to the 90 day non-compete.  Sandi is in the process of getting me a copy of 
the non-compete so that I can determine if this deal is covered.  Do you have 
any thoughts.

Travis,
 Peter Keohane was the attorney who was working with PG&E to put a contract 
in place similar to what ENA agreed to.  I have not seen any amendments 
proposed by PG&E, did they get omitted from my email?  I am attaching the 
proposed amendment which I had forwarded to PG&E last year to enable them to 
trade on Enron Online.  
Please let me know if you need anything further.

PG&E made a proposal to John Lavorato and Bill Bradford today to secure some 
additional gas supplies from ENA and Enron Canada.  I am faxing a copy of the 
presentation and relevant documents to each of you.  I think that this is a 
deal that we are interested in looking at.

John and Jim, I think the only question we will have for you immediately are 
the bankruptcy implications associated with the advance payments.  PG&E 
claims there are none (of course).

Dan, since you reviewed the original PG&E (Core) Master Agreement, can you 
review the proposed amendments to that Master?    

Mark -- I don't think Enron Canada is a party to the PGE Master.  Can you 
take a look at the form ENA executed and see if there is any reason why Enron 
Canada couldn't execute the same form?

Note that PG&E also wants to be re-established to trade on EnronOnline.  I 
understand the only impediment to that is that the masters need to be amended 
to provide that Enron, not PG&E, is the confirming party, and that we were on 
our way to documenting those amendments when this all blew up a few months 
ago.  Dan, can you resurrect those amendments so we can see if we can weave 
them into these amendments?

 Attached is the modified contract with the changes you requested.  Please 
print off 2 originals and have them signed.  Please fill in the purchase 
order number information on the invoices section of Exhibit A.  If the number 
is not available, them please delete the information requiring the number 
from the billing and payment provision.  Forward the signed copies to me or 
Janet Wallis and we will proceed with execution by ENA.

Unfortunately, we don't have a purchase order issued yet so I can't give you
a number.  I know that would make it easier for you guys, but I don't think
we can issue one until right before the first gas purchase.  First, a
purchase requisition needs to be issued.  Then, a purchase order will be
released following approvals by the various individuals authorized to sign
off on them.

Craig,
 Attached please find a revised draft of the Ormet Contract.  I have 
incorporated the language from the Credit Worksheet prepared by Jason 
Williams.  That language is included in Sections 4.2 and 4.3 of the Contract 
and in the definitions for Material Adverse Change, Guarantor, Funded Debt, 
Current Ratio, and Net Worth.  
 Regarding Amy Baird's memo, I have made the requested changes in Article 3 
of the Contract regarding changing "Schedule" and "Scheduled" to "deliver" 
and "delivered" and "receive" and "received".  I did not add the language 
requested in (iii) because that language is already included in the 
definition of "Replacement Price Differential".  I included the language she 
requested under (iv) as (iii) in Section 3.2  I omitted the last sentence 
relating to consequential damages of $1,000,000 per occurrence as we 
discussed and left in the language in Section 8.3 which limits the 
consequential damages to a maximum of $1,000,000 during the term of the 
Agreement.  Likewise, I did not delete the language from Section 8.3 
providing that the gas is being supplied solely on the express 
representations and warranties provided in the Agreement and that all other 
warranties are being waived.  I did delete the language relating to Texas law 
and sentence starting with "Therefore, the Parties agree that (i) three" 
because we had agreed to delete the language from Section 4.1 which set forth 
the method of determining a party's liquidated damages.
I added a sentence at the end of Section 8.5 relating to trial before the 
court with waiver of right to jury trial.  I deleted the language relating to 
arbitration in Appendix 1.  
As we discussed, I did not make the change to force majeure.  We need to 
discuss this.  Our obligation should be limited to having firm transportation 
on one of the pipelines with interruptible transportation on the other.  If 
the firm transportation is interrupted because of force majeure, our 
obligation should be limited to using commercially reasonable efforts to 
cause the volumes to be delivered via the other pipeline if there was 
available capacity on such other pipeline.  
 Please review the contract and if you agree that it represents your 
understanding, you may forward it to the folks at Ormet.  I will be out of 
the office on Monday, but will be available by phone.

Linda,
 I am looking for the follow-up assignment.  I remember having it prepared 
and signed when the AEP people were looking at the contracts across the 
street.  The reason it was assigned back to ENA was that it needed to reside 
in ENA through July 1999.  Thereafter it could be assigned to HPL.  If I 
don't find the copy, everything got scuffled in the move, I will reassign 
effective as of August 1, 1999.  Is this acceptable?

Dan,

This contract was assigned to HPLC effective 5/1/00 and reassigned to ENA on 
the same date.  The reassignment included a note from you dated 5/23/00 
stating  "the Union Carbide contract has been assigned in error and is 
reassigned to ENA because that contract was included in one of the prior ECT 
monetizations".  This contract is included on the Exhibit A of the assignment 
back to ENA.

 Is there another assignment reassigning the contract back to HPLC from ENA?

Please adivse.

Thanks,

Linda

An issue has come to light regarding this contract.  HPL has received an 
amendment to contract 96002201 between HPL and Union wherein it refers to an 
assignment between EING and HPL.   Our clerk, Cathy Harris, spoke to Dan Hyvl 
concerning the Enron entity name discrepancy and obtained a copy of the 
assignment effective 5/1/00 which includes Union Carbide as a contract to be 
assigned.  The contract was evidently not assigned on the 5/1/00 date.  
Please have someone in your group make this correction and let me know when 
the correction is completed so that we can process the amendment timely.

NEW LANGUAGE
-Submitted by PATRICIA L GOONETILLEKE

The European Commission has just announced an agreement whereby English will 
be the official language of the EU rather than German which was the other 
possibility. As part of the negotiations, Her Majesty's Government conceded 
that English spelling had some room for improvement and has accepted a 5 year 
phase-in plan that would be known as "Euro-English".

In the first year, "s" will replace the soft "c". Sertainly, this will make 
the sivil servants jump with joy. The hard "c" will be dropped in favour of 
the"k". This should klear up konfusion and keyboards kan have 1 less letter.

There will be growing publik enthusiasm in the sekond year,?when the 
troublesome "ph" will be replaced with "f". This will make words like 
"fotograf" 20% shorter.

In the 3rd year, publik akseptanse of the new spelling kan be ekspekted to 
reach the stage where more komplikated changes are possible. Governments will 
enkorage the removal of double letters, which have always ben a deterent to 
akurate speling. Also, al wil agre that the horible mes of the silent "e"s in 
the language is disgraseful, and they should go away.

By the fourth year, peopl wil be reseptiv to steps such as replasing "th" 
with "z" and "w" with "v". During ze fifz year,?ze unesesary "o" kan be dropd 
from vords kontaining "ou" and similar changes vud of kors be aplid to ozer 
kombinations of leters.

After zis fifz yer, ve vil hav a reli sensibl riten styl. Zer vil be no mor 
trubl or difikultis and evrivun vil find it ezi to understand ech ozer. Ze 
drem vil finali kum tru! And zen ve vil tak over ze  world!

Doug,
 As we discussed, Larry Pardue has requested that I get you to sign an 
officer's certificate regarding the execution and delivery of the Fuel Supply 
Agreements.  The document that he forwarded to me does not define the 
agreements that he wants you to certify as to.  They are vaguely referred to 
as Transaction Agreements which have been delivered.  As far as I know, he 
may be wanting a certification as to the Consent documents.  If they get back 
to me, I will request that they modify the document to reflect the Fuel 
Supply Agreements only and that you are not aware of any reason why they 
would not be valid under New York law, that you are not aware of any lawsuit 
threatened against EPOS as a result of it entering into these Fuel Supply 
Agreements and that so far as you know, EPOS is not an investment company as 
such term is defined.  I will let you know what Larry is able to modify.

A store owner was tacking a sign above his door
that read "Puppies for Sale."

The signs have a way of attracting children.
Soon a little boy appeared at the sign and asked, "How much are you gonna
sell
those puppies for?".

The store owner replied, "Anywhere from $30-$50."
The little boy reached into his pocket and pulled out some change.
"I have $2.37, can I look at them?"

The store owner smiled and whistled.* Out of the kennel came his dog
named Lady, running down the aisle of his store followed by five little
puppies.* One puppy was lagging considerably behind.

Immediately the little boy singled out the lagging, limping puppy.* He
asked "What's wrong with that little dog?"

The man explained that when the puppy was born the vet said that
this puppy had a bad hip socket and would limp for the rest of his life.

The little boy got really excited and said, "That's the puppy I want to
buy!"

The man replied "No, you don't want to buy that little dog. If you
really want him, I'll give him to you." The little boy got upset. He
looked straight into the man's eyes and said "I don't want you to give him
to
me.
He is worth every bit as much as the other dogs and I'll pay the full
price.* In fact I will give you $2.37 now and 50 cents every month until I
have him paid for."

The man countered, "You really don't want to buy this puppy son.
He is never gonna be able to run, jump and play like other puppies."
The little boy reached down and rolled up his pant leg to reveal a
badly twisted, crippled left leg supported by a big metal brace.* He
looked up at the man and said, "Well, I don't run so well myself and the
little puppy will need someone who understands."

The man was now biting his bottom lip.* Tears welled up in his
eyes....He smiled and said, "Son, I hope and pray that each and every one
of

these puppies will have an owner such as you."

IN LIFE, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO YOU ARE, BUT WHETHER SOMEONE
APPRECIATES YOU FOR WHAT YOU ARE, ACCEPTS YOU AND LOVES YOU
UNCONDITIONALLY.




A REAL FRIEND IS ONE WHO WALKS IN WHEN THE REST OF THE WORLD WALKS AWAY.

SEND THIS TO ALL THE PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE YOU CONSIDER TO BE SPECIAL.

These are general conceptual concepts that need to be addressed.  I have not 
attempted to redraft the language, only to point out areas where we will need 
to work on modifications to the Contract language.


1. Section 5.01 Provision needs to be changed so that Termination Payment is 
first paid by Company to Customer and if not paid by Company after notice, 
then the Customer would be entitled to make a draw under the Surety Bond.

2. Section 5.03   Provision needs to be changed to reflect that the initial 
bond term shall be __5__ years.  At the end of the initial term, the Company 
shall either replace the bond with a new bond for remaining  term of 
prepayment, provide a letter of credit for the remaining amount of 
prepayment, or provide a corporate guaranty.  

3. Section 7.01 This provision should be okay under the Commodity Futures 
Modernization Act of 2000 enacted as of December 14, 2000.  The Customer 
needs to represent to the Company that the Customer is an "eligible contract 
participant" under the Act.

4. Section 10.02 10.02.05 - Company has no control on the substance of the 
opinion of counsel for the surety bond provider.   The substance of such 
opinion should be as negotiated between the bond providers counsel and the 
Customer.   10.02.06  Should Customers inablility to get funding be an out 
for the Customer?   10.02.08  Likewise, should the Customer's inability to 
complete any swap agreements be an out for the Customer?

5. Section 21.01 21.01.02  Company should get aleast 5 business days notice 
of nonpayment before the Customer should be entitled to cause an Early 
Termination Date.  21.01.03  As previously noted in 5.03, Company should have 
the option to provide alternative surety - as referenced in the Term Sheet.  
Contract and Term Sheet need to be made consistent.

6. Section 21.03 and 21.04   Provisions of the Contract need to be consistent 
so that all obligations of the parties are netted before any payment is 
made.  Also 21.03 should first provide for payment by the Company and if not 
made, then by the surety or other security provider.  We shouldn't have to 
pay the Termination Payment to the Customer and then invoice the Customer for 
any Market Exposure Damages under section 21.06.  These should be netted or 
aggregated in computing the Termination Payment.

Russell,
 We need closure on the guaranty issue.  All of the guaranty formats you 
provided to me covered specific enron entities under specific contracts that 
were identified in the guaranty.  If you can give me the specific contracts 
for each of the other enron entities you want covered by the Gas physical 
master contract of ENA whose payment obligations to Engage Energy Marketing, 
L.P.you want guarantied by Enron, I will take the lead to draft the guaranty 
and have it forward to Enron Corp for approval prior to sending it out as a 
draft to Engage Energy Marketing, L.P.

Dan,

This is in response to my continued efforts with legal to make note of my 
intended priority of executing a Master Firm with Coastal Energy (formerly 
Engage US).  As previous e-mails below indicate and phone calls with the ENA 
legal group and Coastal, the draft has yet to be sent out.  I have confirmed 
with Coastal today, they have STILL not received the draft although are 
expecting this from ENA.  We have outstanding exposure with this entity and 
is important from a credit, legal, and contractual standpoint that an 
agreement is executed.  I understand that in the past they have been 
unwilling to negotiate a Master although I want one put in place. Please do 
what you need to, to get this draft sent to the counterparty.

Regards,
Russell

Dan,

Per Debra's e-mail to me, why can we not include other entities on this 
guaranty, it seems we have got guaranty's in place with other counterparty's 
in which they reference specific contracts as well as entities not related to 
the  contract, i.e. Sempra, Duke, Aquila, Dynegy,......  

Dan,
I see the execution of this contract as a priority considering the trading 
volumes on Enron Online and current market conditions.  I know in the past, 
we have been unable to negotiate a Master Firm with Engage US, although their 
legal group is fully aware of our request to negotiate a contract. Please 
send the draft out to the contact listed on the credit worksheet and 
priortize the negotiation of this contract.

My Dear Thanksgiving Dinner Guests,

Martha Stewart will not be dining with us this Thanksgiving.  I'm telling
you in advance, so don't act surprised.  Since Ms. Stewart won't be coming,
I've made a few small changes:
Our sidewalk will not be lined with homemade, paper bag luminaries.  After a
trial run, it was decided that no matter how cleverly done, rows of  flaming
lunch sacks do not have the desired welcoming effect.  Once inside, our
guests will note that the entry hall is not decorated with the swags of
Indian corn and fall foliage I had planned to make.  Instead, I've gotten
the kids involved in the decorating by having them track in colorful autumn
leaves from the front yard.  The mud was their idea.

The dining table will not be covered with expensive linens, fancy china, or
crystal goblets.  If possible, we will use dishes that match and everyone
will get a fork.  Since this IS Thanksgiving, we will refrain from using the
plastic Peter Rabbit plate and the Santa napkins from last Christmas.

Our centerpiece will not be the tower of fresh fruit and flowers that I
promised.  Instead we will be displaying a hedgehog-like decoration
hand-crafted from the finest construction paper.  The artist assures me it
is a turkey.

We will be dining fashionably late.  The children will entertain you while
you wait.  I'm sure they will be happy to share every choice comment I  have
made regarding Thanksgiving, pilgrims, and the turkey hotline.  Please
remember that most of these comments were made at 5:00 a.m. upon discovering
that the turkey was still hard enough to cut diamonds.
As accompaniment to the children's recital, I will play a recording of
tribal drumming.  If the children should mention that I don't own a
recording of tribal drumming, or that tribal drumming sounds suspiciously
like a frozen turkey in a clothes dryer, ignore them.

They are lying.
We toyed with the idea of ringing a dainty silver bell to announce the start
of our feast.  In the end, we chose to keep our traditional method.

We've also decided against a formal seating arrangement.  When the smoke
alarm sounds, please gather around the table and sit where you like.


In the spirit of harmony, we will ask the children to sit at a separate
table.  In a separate room.  Next door.

Now, I know you have all seen pictures of one person carving a turkey in
front of a crowd of appreciative onlookers.  This will not be happening at
our dinner.  For safety reasons, the turkey will be carved in a private
ceremony.  I stress "private", meaning:  Do not, under any circumstances,
enter the kitchen to laugh at me.  Do not  send small, unsuspecting children
to check on my progress.  I have an electric knife.  The turkey is unarmed.
It stands to reason that I will eventually win.  When I do, we will eat.

I would like to take this opportunity to remind my young diners that
"passing the rolls" is not a football play.  Nor is it a request to bean
your sister in the head with warm tasty bread.  Oh, and one reminder for the
adults:  For the duration of the meal, and especially while in the presence
of young diners, we will refer to the giblet gravy by its  lesser-known
name:  Cheese Sauce.  If a young diner questions you regarding the origins
or type of Cheese Sauce, plead ignorance.

Before I forget, there is one last change.  Instead of offering a choice
between 12 different scrumptious desserts, we will be serving the
traditional pumpkin pie, garnished with whipped cream and small
fingerprints.  You will still have a choice:  take it or leave it.


Martha Stewart will not be dining with us this Thanksgiving.  She probably
won't come next year either.    I am thankful.

Stacy,
 The Reliant Energy changes which Ellen Dailey sent to you in August appeared 
in my chair this morning.  I had discussed the Enovate/Reliant changes with 
Ellen yesterday and we resolved most of the language except for the items I 
noted as being Credit Dept calls, which Russell has yet to respond to.  I 
agreed to make similar changes to the ENA/Reliant contract to that agreed 
upon in the Enovate/Reliant contract.  In reviewing the materials that Ellen 
sent you as marked, it appears that we had resolved all of the items in the 
ENA/Reliant markup except for the credit driven items.  Therefore, I will 
create a red-line and send back to Ellen next week, if Russell responds to my 
earlier emails and to this email.  Call if this is not what you desire.

It wasn't too bad.  The phone company sent out a repairman Saturday morning 
and that is how I found out about all of the flooding because we had less 
than normal water accumulation from the rain Friday night.  Lots of sunshine 
Saturday afternoon and most of the day Sunday.  I spent some time shopping at 
Sam's Saturday and Haley and I cleaned my back room of the garage Sunday 
afternoon.  I notice that the bikini car wash is still operating.  They were 
out Friday afternoon when I went home about 5:30 just a few minutes before it 
started raining at the house, of course it rained hard on me most of the way 
home till I got about a mile from the house.  I also noticed them out 
yesterday, however, I think they may have aged.  Are you sure that James 
doesn't have an opening for them.  They seem to be hard workers, at least 
they go through the motions.

I would recommend that once the trueup information is available and verified, 
a credit statement be prepared and forwarded to Heartland, such statement to 
provide that the credit statement is to be used in determining the next 
month's (April) prepayment.  I would not wire them the true-up amount so long 
as we have any reason to believe that they will continue to be in some level 
of operation requiring some level of gas purchases.  John, any comments.

So what should the invoice look like for the March prepayment?  Should I just 
bill them the 1,500/day at the NX3+.34 next Monday; let them pre-pay that and 
then wire them whatever money is owed back to them after the trueup (probably 
sometime mid-April after the pipeline statements have been received and the 
volumes have been acutalized)?  Or does somebody want to estimate what the 
buyback volume and price would be so I can deduct that up front?

Subject: Re: Heartland Invoice for March  

Chuck, The price obtained as the average of the closing price for the last 
three trading days for the month plus $0.34 is to be the price for the next 
month.  We need to give them a credit for the volumes that we purchase back 
due to their volume defaults in the month.  Our buyback price  is to be Gas 
Daily midpoint less $0.15 for the shortfall in volumes.  The $0.15 is the 
penalty for the default and the Gas Daily Midpoint price is what we purchase 
the shortfall back for; but remember if the Gas Daily Midpoint is higher that 
the Nx3, we use the Nx3 as the buyback price for the shortfall.  I know that 
you will not have  all of the information at the time you send them the 
invoice for the next month's prepayment, so you need to keep a schedule and 
trueup each month for the prior months activity.  

John and Patrice, Do you agree with the foregoing?

John,

When do you want me to send an invoice to Heartland so they can pre-pay for 
March gas?  I can bill the 1,500/day but I'll need the pricing.  Are we still 
going to use the NX3+.34 for March or do you want to use something else?  The 
NX3 will not be available for March until Monday so that would be the 
earliest I could send it using that price.

Let me know...
Chuck

Michael,
 
 Gary asked me to review your requested changes and provide revised documents 
for your review and, if acceptable, execution. Attached please find 
2001-012bcrfm which is the extension document, 2001-012abbcrfm which is the 
clean copy of the long term document modified as discussed in 1,2 and 3 
below, and 2001-012abbrcrfm with is the red-line of the changes which have 
been incorporated in the clean version of the long term document.

 1.  I have left the reference in 3) to MinDQ, because the DCQ should always 
be less than the MinDQ and as such, any short fall in required purchases less 
than the MinDQ (which includes the DCQ) will be bought back by the Company.   
I have added a sentence at the end to provide that Customer will be credited 
for the Buyback Volume which Company purchases from Customer.  By way of 
examples,  (A) assume that the DCQ for a day was set at 15,000; that 
Customer's total natural gas requirements for such day was 20,000; and 
Customer's actual purchases from Company for such day was 12,000.  In that 
event the MinDQ would be 20,000 and Customer would purchase 15,000 from 
Company at the price in 1); Customer would purchase 5,000 from Company at the 
price in 2); and Company would purchase 8,000 from Customer at the price in 
3).  (B) assume that the DCQ for a day was set at 15,000; that Customer's 
total natural gas requirements for such day was 12,000; and Customer's actual 
purchases from the Company for such day was 12,000.  In that event the MinDQ 
would be 15,000 and Customer would purchase 15,000 from Company at the price 
in 1) and Company would purchase 3,000 from Customer at the price in 3).

 2. I have added your requested paragraph 4) to provide that should

Help, Time Warner is my cable service provider, however, when I attempted to 
open the ordering information, I am told that a discount for TimeWarner cable 
modern service is not available in my area.  What do I need to do?  So far as 
I know, I can subscribe to cable modem service with TimeWarner, however, I 
have been waiting until the ClickAtHome rollout before I committed to any 
service contract.  Can someone get back to me regarding when the discounted 
service might be available, if not, what is the possibility for a discounted 
DSL service from ATT.  Thank you.

If ENA has a contract with Dynegy that the East Desk is using currently, then 
that contract will not be going with HPL.  If ENA is currently doing business 
with Dynegy in Texas, then the Texs Desk of ENA should be using the same 
contract as the East Desk of ENA is using.

Just for my own knowledge ... does Texas need to negotiate contracts or do we 
have contracts that cover all activity no matter what region.  For example, 
if Dynegy currently does business with our East desk, does Texas need a 
separate contract or do we use the same contract?

Linda,
 It is my understanding that all of the existing contracts for business done 
in Texas that somehow touches the HPL system will go with HPL or its 
marketing entity.  This will mean that ENA will have to negotiate a contract 
with each of those parties whose exiasting contracts will go with the HPL 
sale to AEP.

Linda, Elizabeth Hernandez thought I should contact you about ENA Texas 
contracts.  Are the contracts we have in place as ENA sufficient to handle 
deals that once was done as HPL but will be done as ENA going forward?  We 
are wanting to make sure that we do not have to renegotiate contracts with 
our counterparties or be caught off guard by a contract not being in place 
once the AEP transaction is complete.  Basically, do we have the contracts in 
place to hit the floor running after the HPL sale to AEP goes through?

The original Unit Agreement was described as follows:

Unit Agreement covering the Bammel Gas Unit, Harris County, Texas, entered 
into as of the 1st day of January, 1966 by Houston Natural Gas Production 
Company, called Operator, and other subscribers, namely, H. M. Harrell, Sr.; 
John R. Harrell; H. M. Harrell, Jr.; John  M. Robinson, Individually, and as 
Trustee of the Clayton M. Harrell Trust, and as Executor or the Estate of 
William Ehrhardt; Carlyle W. Urban as Trustee of the Harrell 1963 Trust; 
Werner G. Zapp; Claud B. Hamill; Doris Key as Attorney-in-Fact for John Fred 
Bahr; R. E. Smith; Letitia Zapp Morgan; Floyd Williams, et ux; Paul Kautz, et 
ux; Howard key, et ux; Garland Wilson, et ux; Ernest S. Sears, et ux; Doris 
Key, Individually; and Ella Koinm.  

First Amendment of Unit Agreement was executed by Houston Natural Gas 
Production Company on November 22, 1966 providing for additional escalation 
in the Minimum Volumes of Dry Gas from the Unitized Formation, as provided in 
Paragraph 6.4 of the Unit Agreement, effective after the 25th calendar year.

The Second and Third Amendments of Unit Agreement expanded the acreage 
covered by the Unit Agreement from 6,979.478 acres to 7,438.478 acres.  I do 
not have copies of these 2 amendments.  

At approximately the same point in time Houston Natural Gas Production 
Company conveyed an undivided 50% interest in the Unitized Formation to 
Houston Pipe Line Company.  The remaining interest of Houston Natural Gas 
Production Company was later transferred to HNG Fossil Fuels Company (merged 
into Enron Oil & Gas Company) and that interest was transferred to HPL 
Resources Company, which is a subsidiary of Houston Pipe Line Company.

Please call me at (713)853-6895 if you need anything further to describe 
these documents.

Clement,
 Russell Diamond of the Enron Credit group would like Enron to issue to 
Engage (now known as Coastal Merchant Energy, L.P.) a blanket guarantee 
covering obligations of ENA, EPMI, ECC and Clinton Energy Management 
Services, Inc. without necessarily tying those obligations to specific 
contracts.  Do you have a form of guaranty that could be used for this.  I 
think that the guaranty would still have a limit ($25MM)?.  Please advise.

Russell,
 The below two documents are the credit worksheet and the contract 
relationship documents which you provided.  The credit worksheet states that 
the guaranty should cover ENA, EPMI, ECC and Clinton Energy Management 
Services, Inc. and additionally should cover the master energy agreement with 
EPMI.  Do we have a date of execution or effective date for such master 
energy agreement.  The contract relationship document merely states that the 
guaranty should cover the new master firm purchase sale agreement  that ENA 
is negotiating with Engage and an master energy agreement between EPMI and 
____.  No agreements of any type are specified for ECC or Clinton Energy 
Management Services, Inc.  Also, are any of the Master Swap agreements that 
ENA has with Engage to be covered by the requested guaranty?  I believe that 
we need to get together at your convenience and determine exactly which 
contracts Enron Corp. is to cover with the guaranty agreement being offered 
as a part of the security for the Master Firm Purchase Sale Agreement.  
Please let me know when you will be available to discuss.

with the Contracts that needed to be reference.  If you need a copy the

 We need closure on the guaranty issue.  All of the guaranty formats you

L.P.you want guarantied by Enron, I will take the lead to draft the guaranty

Dan,

This is in response to my continued efforts with legal to make note of my 
intended priority of executing a Master Firm with Coastal Energy (formerly 
Engage US).  As previous e-mails below indicate and phone calls with the ENA 
legal group and Coastal, the draft has yet to be sent out.  I have confirmed 
with Coastal today, they have STILL not received the draft although are 
expecting this from ENA.  We have outstanding exposure with this entity and 
is important from a credit, legal, and contractual standpoint that an 
agreement is executed.  I understand that in the past they have been 
unwilling to negotiate a Master although I want one put in place. Please do 
what you need to, to get this draft sent to the counterparty.

Regards,
Russell

Per Debra's e-mail to me, why can we not include other entities on this 
guaranty, it seems we have got guaranty's in place with other counterparty's 
in which they reference specific contracts as well as entities not related to 
the  contract, i.e. Sempra, Duke, Aquila, Dynegy,......  

Dan,
I see the execution of this contract as a priority considering the trading 
volumes on Enron Online and current market conditions.  I know in the past, 
we have been unable to negotiate a Master Firm with Engage US, although their 
legal group is fully aware of our request to negotiate a contract. Please 
send the draft out to the contact listed on the credit worksheet and 
priortize the negotiation of this contract.

Read the text before looking at the picture.

A class of elementary students started a class project to
make a planter to take home and wanted to have a plant in
it that was easy to take care of, so it was decided to use
cactus plants. The students were given greenware pottery
of a clown planter, and they painted them with glaze and
had them professionally fired at a class outing so they
could see the process. It was  great fun.

They planted the cactus seeds in the finished planters, and
they grew nicely but unfortunately the children were not
allowed to take them home.

The cactus plants were removed and a small ivy replaced
them, and the children were then allowed to take the
planters home.

The teacher said cactus seemed like a good idea at the time....

A Master Agreement  for execution has been sent to Ennovate.  Dan Hyvl is 
working with the Chicago office in this matter.   I  understand Reliant 
desires to change some of the terms of the deal and we are waiting to proceed 
pending those changes.

What is the status of the credit worksheet for this counterparty?  Looks as 
if we need a Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement.  Please advise?

Okay, I wasn't sure who to route this to, but one of our traders gave Claire 
Neri at UGI my name and number to help with information about our contracts. 
As it turns out, we do not have a Master Contract with UGI but have a firm 
term deal  attached to a GTC (Deal #345010, running from 11/1/00 - 3/31/01, 
5380 MMBTu/day @ $4.78, meter #103702 on ANR).

UGI's hope is to get a Master agreement in place ASAP to cover the above 
mentioned deal & any new inter gas deals (since she sent their master, I'm 
assuming that their intent is to put their master in place ASAP). Claire Neri 
can be reached at 610-796-3505 for additional information of 
changes/negotiations. 

Note: UGI is also an EOL "Investment Grade" counterparty for non-Texas natual 
gas.

Dan:

I have a dilemma and I'm almost too embarrassed to ask you to help me
resolve it.  As a matter of policy in this department, we are to stress the
fact that we "need" "financially firm" language in all contracts.  When the
Trader requested a contract with Enovate, he was not clear about his
trading intentions and it was assumed that "financially firm" "needed" to
be in the contract.  It seems that this language is now holding up the
execution process of the Enovate LLC contract.  The Business Unit wants
"financially firm" out and "firm" substituted.

The definition for "firm" that they want in the contract is the standard
definition for "firm" that is in the GISB as follows:

"Firm" shall mean that either party may interrupt its performance without
liability only to the extent that such performance is prevented for reasons
of Force Majeure; provided, however, that during Force Majeure
interruptions, the party invoking Force Majeure may be responsible for any
imbalance charges as set forth in Section 7.2 related to its interruption
after the nomination is made to the Transporter and until the change in
deliveries and/or receipts is confirmed by the Transporter.

I believe the only other place in the contract that "Financially Firm"
appears is on the first page, Article 2. SCOPE OF AGREEMENT:, second line,
would you please change that occurrence of "Financially Firm" to just
"firm"?

Dan, can you help me with this without trashing the whole contract?  On the
first page, we can line through "Financially" and initial, and then just
the definition page on the first page of APPENDIX "1" would have to be
redone to replace "Financially Firm" with just "Firm".

Please let me know if this is able to be done.

Thanks and I'm so sorry,

Ellen Dailey

 LET'S MAKE SOME COOKIES!!!

THIS IS A TRUE STORY

A little background: Neiman-Marcus, if you
 don't know already is a very
expensive store i.e. they sell your typical
 $8.00 t-shirt for $50.00.Lets let them have it!!!
My daughter and I had just finished a salad
at a Neiman-Marcus Cafe
 in Dallas and decided to have a small dessert. Because
 both of us are such
 cookie lovers, we decided to try the "Neiman-Marcus
Cookie." It was so excellent
 that I asked if they would give me the recipe
 and the waitress said with a
small frown, "I'm afraid not but, you can buy
 the recipe."

 Well, I asked how much, and she responded,
"Only two fifty, it's a great deal!" I agreed with approval, just add it to
 my tab I told her. Thirty days later, I received my VISA statement and it was
 $285.00. I looked again and
 I remembered I had only spent $9.95 for two salads and about $20.00
 for a scarf. As I glanced at the bottom of the
 statement, it said, Cookie Recipe -$250.00" That was outrageous!

I called Neiman's Accounting Dept. and told them the waitress said it
 was "two-fifty," which clearly does not mean "twohundred and fifty dollars"
by any *POSSIBLE* interpretation of the phrase.= Neiman-Marcus
 refused to budge.They would not refund my money, because
 according to them, "What the
 waitress told you is not our problem. You have already seen the
 recipe. We absolutely will not refund you money at this point."

 I explained to her the criminal statues which
 govern fraud in Texas. I threatened to refer them to The Better
 Business Bureau and the State Attorney General Office for engaging in fraud.
I was basically told,"Do what you want, it doesn't matter, we're not refunding
 your money." I waited, thinking of how I could get even, or even try and get 
any
 of my money back.
 I just said, "Okay, you folks got my $250, and now I'm going to have
 $250.00 worth of fun."
 I told her that I was going to see to it that every Cookie lover in
the United States with an e-mail account has a $250.00 cookie recipe from
 Neiman-Marcus...for free. She replied, "I wish you wouldn't do this." I
said, "Well, you should have thought of that before you ripped me off," and
 slammed down the phone on her.

So here it is!!! Please, please, please pass it on to everyone youcan
 possibly think of. I paid $250 for this...I don't want Neiman-Marcus
to *ever* get another penny off of this recipe....

 NEIMAN MARCUS COOKIES (Recipe may be halved)
2 cups butter
 4 cups flour
2 tsp. soda
 2 cups sugar
 5 cups blended oatmeal ***
24 oz. chocolate chips
 2 cups brown sugar
 1 tsp. salt
 4 eggs
1 - 8 oz. Hershey Bar (grated
 2 tsp. baking powder
 2 tsp. vanilla
3 cups chopped nuts (your choice)

* Measure oatmeal and blend in a blender to a fine powder.
 * Cream the butter and both sugars.
 * Add eggs and vanilla, mix together with flour, oatmeal, salt, baking 
powder, and soda.
 * Add chocolate chips, Hershey Bar and nuts.

 Roll into balls and place two inches apart on
 a cookie sheet.
* Bake for 10 minutes at 375 degrees.
 * Makes 112 cookies.

 PLEASE READ IT AND SEND TO EVERY PERSON YOU
KNOW WHO HAS AN E-MAIL
ADDRESS!
 THIS IS REALLY TERRIFIC!

 Have fun!!! This is not a joke-this is a true
story. Ride free,
 citizens

 If you can get me a copy of the contractual documents that govern the 
physical deals that we are doing with the counterparty, I will modify the 
language to reflect the contractual arrangement that we are relying upon.

Thank you for the quick reply, but I am not sure if this form is applicable. 
The counterparty PSNC Production Corp. is not governed by a Master Physical, 
which this current form references. Is there an open grty. format that can be 
used to cover PSNC's physical business with ENA?

While I'm in the process of getting the appropriate information for Mr.
Earp, one question.  Shouldn't we also have a bill of sale to accompany
this document, registering the value to be paid for this property?

Pls advise.

Kim,
 Please review this draft.  I have not modified any language from the Enfolio 
to that contained in the draft of their form of contract which you forwarded 
to me last week.  I will read their long form and see if it makes sense to 
include their language.  Remember, in their short form, they had language for 
short breaks which was slightly diffent from ours but with a little torture, 
we could have incorporated their language once we got over the hurdle that we 
can't agree to let them audit our contracts,  which means we could never show 
them what we got for the default quantity.

Dave,
 Volume, term and price are necessary components of the confirm.  Do not send 
out without these components being in place.  Also, changing from the January 
dates will require additional language changes.  I will make those changes 
when we fill in the rest of the information.  How do we stand on getting the 
final version of the Master Contract drafted and submitted to them for 
signature.  Remember, we need that in place before we do the confirm.,

darren,
 This was done as a signed GTC transaction.  I do not know if they have 
signed or not.  The paperwork provides a zero collateral threshold.  The 
counterparty is a limited partnership.  J. E. Robert Companies is the general 
partner.  The enron counterparty is Houston Pipe Line Company.  I see no 
reason to redo the paperwork if the original GTC has been signed.  Do you 
agree?

Oscar,
 I changed para 2 back to unilateral because there is no way for Enron to 
have the information to issue a notice of termination on 11/30/99, only AEC 
will be privy to that and in the event they do not issue notice by that date 
they should remain bound to the deal. I assume that is the only change you 
made to the agreement I drafted last night.  As such I have attached the 
modified version for your use with Credit prior to sending same to AEC this 
morning.

 The only change of any significance that Anne requested is the deletion of

first line of the third paragraph under Other of the Spot Confirmation.  
Please confirm if this deletion is okay.  If not, please let me know and I 
will put the words back.  The other changes were form type and did not change

Interesting facts about this election  
------------------------------------- 
States won by Gore: 19 
States  won by Bush: 29 

Counties won by Gore: 677 
Counties won by Bush:  2,434 

Pop. of counties won by Gore: 127 million 
Pop. of counties won  by Bush: 143 million 


Sq miles of country won by Gore: 580,000 
Sq  miles of country won by Bush: 2,427,000 


Now Professor Joseph Olson  of the Hamline University School of Law in
St. 
Paul Minnesota has  produced another interesting new statistic. Professor

Olson looked up the  crime statistics for all of these counties and came
up 
with this:  

Avg Murder per 100,000 residents in counties won by Gore: 13.2 
Avg  Murder per 100,000 residents in counties won by Bush: 2.1 

Now, what area  of this country do you want electing the President of the

United States,  Gore's or Bush's?

Chuck, The price obtained as the average of the closing price for the last 
three trading days for the month plus $0.34 is to be the price for the next 
month.  We need to give them a credit for the volumes that we purchase back 
due to their volume defaults in the month.  Our buyback price  is to be Gas 
Daily midpoint less $0.15 for the shortfall in volumes.  The $0.15 is the 
penalty for the default and the Gas Daily Midpoint price is what we purchase 
the shortfall back for; but remember if the Gas Daily Midpoint is higher that 
the Nx3, we use the Nx3 as the buyback price for the shortfall.  I know that 
you will not have  all of the information at the time you send them the 
invoice for the next month's prepayment, so you need to keep a schedule and 
trueup each month for the prior months activity.  

John and Patrice, Do you agree with the foregoing?

John,

When do you want me to send an invoice to Heartland so they can pre-pay for 
March gas?  I can bill the 1,500/day but I'll need the pricing.  Are we still 
going to use the NX3+.34 for March or do you want to use something else?  The 
NX3 will not be available for March until Monday so that would be the 
earliest I could send it using that price.

Let me know...
Chuck

Grant,
 I do not think that their new language will work in the way they think it 
will.  What Bruce indicated to me was that if they determined that they had 
volumes after 9:00 they would offer to us.  If we didn't accept, then they 
wanted the right to go to another market which might be in the Chicage area.  
 My understanding of this deal was that we were only obligated to take 
volumes if they were nominated before 9:00.  Is that correct?  Please call me 
so that we can discuss.

Dan, after talking to Mike Kleiner from Gulf and Grant Oh we determined the
wording in the contract handcuffs Crestar to move volumes after 9:00am MST
if additional volumes become available that Crestar did not have prior to
9:00am MST. Mike came up with the wording below to give Crestar the option
to move gas after 9:00am.

Please review and if you are in agreement please make the change to the
subject agreement.

Thanks,

RE: Transaction No. 1a; March 22, 2001

We are writing to obtain your waiver of certain requirements under the
subject agreement.

The specific circumstance of concern arises where, prior to 9:00 am on a
Nomination Day, CEMC advises Enron that it will not deliver gas or will
deliver less than the maximum DCQ, because CEMC does not expect to have
sufficient volumes available on the next Gas Day to enable it to utilize
all
of Customer's AOS.  Should circumstances change after 9:00 am on a
Nomination Day such that CEMC expects to have additional volumes available
on the next Gas Day, CEMC wishes to be authorized to utilize Customer's AOS
to deliver those additional volumes.

If you agree to allow CEMC to deliver volumes in the circumstance outlined
above, we request that you confirm your agreement on the duplicate copy of
this letter provided for that purpose.

Phil,

At the request of Alan Kilpatrick I am forwarding to your for your
review and comment a proposed letter agreement relating to the sale of
regassified LNG to SCS for use  in a potential new plant to be built in
McIntosh, Georgia, together with the confirmation letter containing the
terms of such sale.  The latter has been modified from the version you
last reviewed to add certain additional provisions we felt necessary and
to flesh out the unique force majeure provisions that we felt should
apply to this transaction.

A woman goes to her boyfriend's parents' house for dinner. This is to be her 
first time meeting the family and she is very nervous. They all sit down and 
begin eating a fine meal.

The woman is beginning to feel a little discomfort, thanks to her nervousness 
and the broccoli casserole. The gas pains are almost making her eyes water. 
Left with no other choice, she decides to relieve herself a bit and lets out 
a dainty fart. It wasn't loud, but everyone at the table heard the poof. 
Before she even had a chance to be embarrassed, her boyfriend's father looked 
over at the dog that had been snoozing at the woman's feet and said in a 
rather stern voice, "Skippy!"

The woman thought, "This is great!" and a big smile came across her face. A 
couple of minutes later, she was beginning to feel the pain again. This time, 
she didn't even hesitate. She let a much louder and longer fart rip. The 
father again looked and the dog and yelled, "Dammit Skippy!"

Once again the woman smiled and thought "Yes!" A few minutes later the woman 
had to let another one rip. This time she didn't even think about it. She let 
rip a fart that rivaled a train whistle blowing.

Once again, the father looked at the dog with disgust and yelled, "Dammit 
Skippy, get away from her before she craps all over you!"

Irene,
 These become HPL contracts on the effective date of the assignment.  As such 
I would use that date as the effective contract date and the assignment 
date.  The original contact date can remain the same as in the contract 
file.  Tom/Steve - Do you agree?

Dan, to follow up on the phone message I just left for you!

In the ongoing process of automating TRRC Sales Tariff Filings,  we have 
encountered several issues for which we need legal clarification in reference 
to all the sales contracts that were assigned from ENA Sales to HPL Sales.

What date should be filed as the Original Contract Date?

 What date should be filed as the Contract Effective Date?

What date should be used for the Contract Amendment Date - i.e. the 
assignment date?

Dan,

I need your help with this confirmation please. 
It is a buyback, which we currently don't confirm. However we have had a 
request to send a confirmation out this time and I guess going forward we 
should confirm these deals.
We haven't got a template, but I've put something together I want you to look 
at and especially where it's highlighted in red, we need some legal language.
Please have a look and let me know what you think or if you need more 
information, please contact me.



Thanks
Ellen

Fran,
 I understand from John Blaylock that I am to direct an email to you 
regarding the treatment of certain vested Enron benefits.  My name was 
included on the list of attorneys and paralegals with whom AEP could talk to 
regarding possible employment for continuation of legal representation for 
HPL's business lines.  I met with Gary Prescott yesterday and do not know 
whether AEP will or will not make an offer.  However, in the event they elect 
to make an offer, I would like to know what my options are relating to (1) my 
vested Enron stock options, (2) any unvested options, (3) the Enron Savings 
Plan.  Regarding the Savings Plan, would I be allowed to leave the funds in 
the plan, as if I had retired, or would I be required or permitted to roll 
those amounts into a rollover IRA?  What actions would I need to take 
regarding the amounts that are in the Deferred Compensation Plan?  

 Enron is currently subsidizing a portion of the costs of internet services 
through Time Warner Roadrunner.  Will these costs continue to be subsidized, 
and if so, by whom?

Mike,
 I have reviewed the attached marked copy of the transaction agreement and 
have gone over the changes with Craig.  Please change the term "best efforts" 
which was added in the 14th line of Item 1 under Other to read "commercially 
reasonable best efforts".  This will keep the concept the same throughout the 
document where we use the term "commercially reasonable best efforts".  With 
this change, please print out two copies of the contract and two copies of 
the transaction agreement and proceed with execution of each.  Please call if 
you have any questions.

Richard Sanders and I talked with Elizabeth (an attorney with AEP).  She was 
not sure that their was a question that needed to be answered.  Richard 
opined that the question may have related to the effect on HPL if it lost the 
Taub lawsuit.  This suit relates to an alleged violation of the surface 
rights agreement (Collateral Agreement) which was entered into with certain 
surface owners after the Unit Agreement was signed.  Richard explained that 
if HPL lost the suit, it would lose its rights to maintain a pipeline and 
well facilities on the property subject to the lawsuit.  In that event HPL 
would have to either locate its pipeline around the property or  use its 
condemnation rights to acquire an easement across the property.  Because the 
Collateral Agreement relates to surface rights, losing those rights would not 
affect HPL's rights under the Unit Agreement and thus the Taubs would not 
have the right to drill a well to produce the gas that HPL has in storage.

I have drafted and attached a basic offer to an adjacent land owner for a
property sale.  He and I have negotiated this for some time and this is
basically my final offer.

Please critique this letter and advise me at your earliest convenience of
the changes you would require before this is sent out.

Candy,
 My initial reaction to the letter is that we should not commit to do a 
contract for deed for the buyer.  The buyer needs to obtain financing from 
another source and take us out completely; otherwise why are we doing it.  
Another buyer may come along during the interim.  Let's discuss this with Ann 
Elizabeth next week.

Charlotte,
 Please explain what you are referring to when you state that Article 12.7 
was omitted by accident.  My copy of the signed agreement has 12.7.  I am 
attaching the proposed Amendment for your review and comments.   I added the 
Gas Daily Midpoint Price to  be used as a default index when a index was not 
specified and for online transactions.  Please review and let me have your 
comments,  if okay, please start the execution process and forward 2 to me 
for signature by ENA.

Kim,
 The gas portion of the RFP does not appear to be of concern assuming we are 
willing to handle the swing in their requirements.  The RFP does require that 
we attach our contract form, which I think should be the contract draft we 
are currently negotiating together with a completed form of Transaction 
Agreement for the RFP response.  Do you agree?  I am still waiting for a 
response from the City Attorney regarding his requested changes and our 
response as to each of his points.  I called Christian Yoder for a download 
of his conversation with the City Attorney last Friday but I have yet to hear 
from Christian.  At this point I think that we need to include language in 
the RFP response that our bid is based on them executing the contract as 
attached.

Walter,
 I do not think that they reviewed the language with their legal group.  They 
just did a cut of the revised document we sent to them.  As cut the language 
makes no sense.  Their is no connection between the Financial Statements and 
the Confidential Information.    Additionally their is no term.  As 
redrafted, the document is totally unacceptable.  Please tell them we need to 
go back to the Enron response document which we previously provided.  Thank 
you.

Lisa,
 Barbara Gray requested that I fax a copy of the subject guaranty to you for 
your review.  This guaranty was not included in the initial list of 
guarantees provided by the credit group.  Apparently one of the analyst had 
the file pulled and on his desk for review.  
 Barbara has also asked that you prepare a Substitution and Release Agreement 
for this guaranty.

 Please call me if you have any questions.  My phone number is 713-853-6895.

Brant,
 EnergyOne has responded to the requested changes.  They agree to the 
revision of the MAC language but threw in a money wrench by adding a warm and 
fuzzy triggering event  if a party refused to provide security within 48 
hours of a reasonable request therefore.  No standard is provided as to the 
reason for the request.    They also deleted the original Collateral 
Threshold language which was in their first draft.  Please respond to these 
matters to me and to Sylvia Pollan.

My understanding, after discussing the matter with Jim Carr, is that the

Deirdre,
 A red line provided by Kim Decell is attached at the end of this email.  
Without getting into the language specifics which need to be addressed, the 
areas of concern relate to Transaction formation procedure (verbal versus 
signed agreement), Nominated Quantity and Maximum Daily Quantity is used 
interchangeably when the term most likely should be Daily Contract Quantity 
or Minimum Daily Quantity.  Term Purchase Quantity is used which means that a 
default cannot occur until the end of the term when there is no longer any 
time left for the buyer to be able to request the necessary quantities 
(default to be determined by using the last day(s) of term prices eventhough 
default may have occurred on the front end of transaction), Provides for 
fixed prices without obligation of any fixed volumes, Point of Sale and Point 
of Receipt needs to be made the same, Limitation of Liability and 
Responsibility for Taxes need to be changed to Enron language, Triggering 
Events needs to be expanded to fit Enron concepts, No free walks for 
regulatory risks, force majeure needs to address Enron concepts, corporate 
guaranty needs to be payment not performance, collateral threshold needs to 
be reinserted and updated by Credit for Master verses one-off language.

Dan,

I have attached a document which compares the draft Master Contract to last
year's contract.  The majority of the changes you will see are necessary to
convert a deal-specific contract to something more like a set of "general
terms and conditions" that will be supplemented with the deal-specifics in a
Transaction Confirmation.  These essential changes include (1) the
replacement of any deal-specific item such as price, point of sale, contract
quantity with a reference to the Transaction Confirmation, (2) the inclusion
of language for Firm Baseload, Firm Swing and Firm Swing with Term Purchase
Quantity so that all types of purchase arrangements are addressed and (3)
the addition of Sections 1, 2 and 4 to introduce and explain "Master
Contract" and "Transaction Confirmation".  These changes necessarily lead to
more definitions.

In addition, we have created our own Events of Default language which is
almost identical to Enron's Triggering Events language.  We can discuss any
changes you might like to make to our language.

The remaining variances, with 2 notable exceptions, are subject to
negotiation and these include liability language at Section 10.3 and the
removal or replacement of Locked Prices language at Section 8.3.  The 2
items we are not willing to change are (1) Section 9 Taxes and (2) the
addition of the previous Collateral Requirement/Termination Payment
Threshold language.  These were accepted last year ONLY because the parties
had agreed to certain purchase terms and the effective date of the contract
had passed.

For all the reasons above, we cannot use last year's contract verbatim.
However, I believe what we have is, with the 2 exceptions, very similar to
last year's contract.  I appreciate that we all spent a lot of time getting
last year's contract finalized and it reinforced the need for us to have an
executed set of general terms & conditions in place PRIOR to the bidding
process.  We are targeting March 31 for execution of Master Contracts with
all parties desiring to bid in Wisconsin Public Service's RFP, which is
expected to take place in early April.

I will be out of the office from 10 am today until Monday, but if you need
to contact me during this time, either leave a voice mail, which I will be
checking, or send an email which will be forwarded to Tim Sexton.

Thanks for your help Dan.

Kim,
     I am again in receipt of the proposed Wisconsin Public Service form of
Master Contract.  My comments remain the same as they were last year.  If
we need to get to a contract quickly, I would suggest we start with the
version that was signed last year, or simply amend last years contract for
this years volume and price.  What is your preference?

A jeweler watched as a huge truck pulled up in front of his store. The back 
came down and an elephant walked out. It broke one of the windows with its 
tusk and then, using its trunk like
a vacuum cleaner sucked up all of the jewelry. The elephant then got back in 
the truck and it disappeared out of sight.

When the jeweler finally regained his senses he called the police. The 
detectives came and he told them his story.

"Could you describe the elephant?" the cop asked.

"An elephant is an elephant," he replied. "You've seen one you've seen them 
all. What do you mean 'describe' him?"

"Well," said the policeman, "there are two types of elephants, African and 
Indian. The Indian elephant has smaller ears and is not as large as the 
African elephant."

"I can't help you out," said the frustrated jeweler, "he had a stocking 
pulled over his head."

Dan, thanks for your submission of all the contracts, I've not been able to
devote all of my time to them, but they are in varying stages of
completion.  This will be a short week with the holiday, so I wanted to
touch base with you and let you know that we probably will not be able to
address these contract issues until the week of Nov. 27th.

I hope you have a safe and happy Thanksgiving.

Kim,
 I am again in receipt of the proposed Wisconsin Public Service form of 
Master Contract.  My comments remain the same as they were last year.  If we 
need to get to a contract quickly, I would suggest we start with the version 
that was signed last year, or simply amend last years contract for this years 
volume and price.  What is your preference?

Susan,
 I have reviewed the contract form that you provided in November and have 
attempted to make the changes which would be required for Enron to utilize 
the form.  I believe that the red line document attached  should address a 
majority of the issues which  need to be changed.  Please review and give me 
you comments as to the suggested changes.

Cheryl,
 I am the person who asked Debra if she could find the confirms for the 
deal.  The system indicated that the deals were confirmed in legal and I knew 
that I had not received a request for any deals covering the time period post 
of 3/31/99 under that GISB.  If done in legal it should have been by me or 
Debra.  In any case if a confirm was done, it should have been filed with the 
confirm desk, and not with the HPL contract.  I apologize for not contacting 
you directly.  We needed the document immediately and the HPL contract group 
has already indicated that they did not have it.

Debra,

The only confirm I've been able to print is for Sitara deal 131153 (Tagg 
N47394.1) and this one is weird:  the deal was a two-month firm deal covering 
12/01/99 - 01/31/00.  Since firm deals over a month should not be confirmed 
under a GISB, this deal was split and 01/00 was moved to Sitara deal 133958 
(cannot find Tagg number).  Deal 131153 was originally confirmed under a 
Master Purchase Sale Firm but moved to the GISB following the correction of 
the CP name on the deal ticket.  The deal was not reconfirmed under the GISB 
to the best of my knowledge; I couldn't locate the deal in Livelink (the only 
confirms under that deal number were for EPMI deals) and could only print the 
confirm out of Tagg. 

I could not locate the other deal numbers at all in Tagg and there are no 
records in Livelink of the confirms either (only EPMI deals).  I'm guessing 
the deals were confirmed out of DCAF, but I don't have access to that.  
Someone in the Confirms group will have to print those for you.  One note:  
The last deal, Sitara 107197, is a five-month firm deal that should NOT have 
been attached to the GISB.

Since these are HPL deals, I'm not sure who confirms them, but you could 
probably get some help from either Ellen Wallumrod, Ann Osire, or Richard 
Deming.  On the contract side, Cheryl Dudley or Amelia Alland should be able 
to help.  I'm afraid I've done all I can on this end.

I'm getting ready to fax the confirm for deal 131153 (before it was split) 
since it's the only record I could pull up.

Sorry I couldn't find you everything!

Jeff,
 We talked about my joining HPL after the sale was consummated several weeks 
ago.  You had indicated that you would work up some information and send it 
to me.  Is it ready?  Gary Prescott and I have verbally agreed to a level of 
compensation which I understand you are working into a document.  He has also 
assured me that I will be credited with my initial start date which is March 
9, 1967 and be fully vested in the various benefit, retirement and vacation 
plans.  Can you confirm this?  Enron has indicated that since I am over 55, I 
will be fully vested in any unvested options, however, all of my options will 
need to be exercised on the earlier of the original expiration date or a date 
that is 3 years from the time I leave Enron's employment.  They indicated 
that it makes no difference if I retire or terminate.  I can see no benefit 
in retirement from Enron because I am currently vested in the savings plan 
which I will roll over to an investment account when I leave Enron and I see 
no reason to sign up for the Enron Retirement Health Benefits because AEP 
appears to have a similar retirement health benefit plan.  Isn't this the 
case?
 Please respond at your earliest opportunity so that I can better understand 
how I need to approach Enron concerning my possible departure from Enron for 
a career opportunity with HPL.

Gentlemen:

Here are the revised documents in both clean and marked form.  I made the 
requested change in the Term section.  That section defines a Early 
Termination as any termination prior to the end of 3 contract years.  As such 
no change was needed to the Buyer's Contract section.  Please call if you 
need anything further.  

        Thanks, Dan

   Health Tips and News
   The Straight Dope On Food, Health, & Exercise:

   Q:  I've heard that cardiovascular exercise can prolong life. Is this
 true?
   A:  Your heart is only good for so many beats, and that's it. Everything
 wears out eventually. Speeding up your heart will not make you live
 longer; that's like saying you can extend the life of your car by driving it
 faster.  Want to live longer? Take a nap.

   Q:  Should I cut down on meat and eat more fruits and vegetables?
   A:  You must grasp logistical efficiencies. What does a cow eat? Hay and
  corn. And what are these? Vegetables. So a steak is nothing more than an
  efficient mechanism of delivering vegetables to your system. Need grain?
  Eat chicken. Beef is also a good source of field grass (green leafy
  vegetable). And a pork chop can give you 100% of your recommended daily
  allowance of vegetable slop.

   Q: Is beer or wine bad for me?
   A: Look, it goes to the earlier point about fruits and vegetables. As we
  all know, scientists divide everything in the world into three categories:
  animal, mineral, and vegetable. We all know that beer and wine are not
  animal, and they are not on the periodic table of elements, so that only
  leaves one thing, right? My advice: Have a burger and a beer and enjoy
 your liquid vegetables.

   Q: How can I calculate my body/fat ratio?
   A: Well, if you have a body, and you have body fat, your ratio is one to
  one. If you have two bodies, your ratio is two to one, etc.

    Q: At the gym, a guy asked me to "spot" for him while he did the bench
  press. What did he mean?
   A: "Spotting" for someone means you stand over him while he blows air up
  your shorts. It's an accepted practice at health clubs; though if you find
  that it becomes the ONLY reason why you're going in, you probably ought to
  reevaluate your exercise program.

   Q: What are some of the advantages of participating in a regular exercise
  program?
   A: Can't think of a single one, sorry.  My philosophy is: No Pain-No
 Pain.

   Q: If I stop drinking, will I live longer?
   A: Nope. Drinking enhances individual expression and peace of mind. If
  you stop, you'll probably stress yourself to death in record time.

   Q: Aren't fried foods bad for you?
   A: You're not listening. Foods are fried these days in vegetable oil. In
  fact, they're permeated in it. How could getting more vegetables be bad for
  you?

   Q: What's the secret to healthy eating?
   A: Thicker gravy.

   Q: Will sit-ups help prevent me from getting a little soft around the
  middle?
   A: Definitely not! When you exercise a muscle, it gets bigger. You should
  only be doing sit-ups if you want a bigger stomach.

  I hope this has cleared up any misconceptions you may have had.

Chris,
 The above document is the November 17, 1999 document which has been changed 
to a 3 month deal with the price change you specified.  I have received the 
copy of the type of contract that they would like us to use.  I note that we 
will have to make a lot of changes which is probably not warranted for a 3 
month deal.  If you want us to consider using their form for a long term 
deal, I will start making the necessary changes and send you back a red-lined 
single transaction contract.  Will the long term deal have the same terms as 
our last long term deal except for price?

Not sure who's available for this, but here goes.

Mississippi Valley Gas Company has shown up for review in EOL.  There are two 
executed masters.  One is a CES GISB (96028960) dated 1/1/98.  The other is 
our MPSF (96001043) dated 1/1/93.

My vote is for the CES GISB.  Can I please get an official call on the best 
one for EOL, including collateral language?  They are attached for your 
review.

Thanks!!

Susan

Christian,
 I believe this is covered because the language states that if the 25th is 
not a 
Business Day, the payment will be due the next Business Day.  Business Day is 
a defined term as a day when the Federal Reserve Banks is New York are open 
for business.  I cannot agree to a Customer's Business Day because it is not 
a defined term and may differ from the standard definition of Business Day.  
Therefore that change should not be incorporated.  Do you agree?

Mr. Hyvl,

There was one change that you did not make that I requested.  It was
difficult to tell since only a single word was bolded.

APPENDIX "1"  FINANCIAL MATTERS  BILLING, INVOICE DATE, CHARGES AND PAYMENT

"Buyer shall remit any amounts due on the 25th day of the Month in which
Seller's statement was received.  If the due date for any payment to be made
under this Agreement is not a Customer's Business Day, the due date for such
payment shall be the following Customer's Business Day."

There are very few instances where our Business Day would be different from
your business day.  However, as an example, the day after Thanksgiving is a
CPS holiday.  This year, we had a gas payment due on that date which we sent
on the following Monday.  This is probably the only holiday CPS has that
your company may not have.

Unfortunately, we don't have a purchase order issued yet so I can't give
you
a number.  I know that would make it easier for you guys, but I don't think
we can issue one until right before the first gas purchase.  First, a
purchase requisition needs to be issued.  Then, a purchase order will be
released following approvals by the various individuals authorized to sign
off on them.

Now they both say shall however I have tied it to the preceding sentence of

Just to confirm what Dan Hyvl told me:

Use GTCs on both those deals until he can review the Single Transaction 
Purchase Firm contract (96005067).  Based on preliminary information, he 
feels that this contract was not set up to use as a master.  If Dan later 
determines that those transactions should indeed be under the contract, we 
can change the contract and inform the Confirms group (and Logistics if 
necessary) accordingly.  

Please keep Elizabeth informed of what's going on.

I'll keep you posted on what Dan wants us to do.

Thanks,

Sharon,

I'm not trying to make a big deal of it.  I also think that Elizabeth would 
let you know if there was an issue on a particular deal.  

This deal did NOT have a contract attached; I checked the audit tab to see 
when Elizabeth approved it (the comment will read "added user tag").  I just 
realized that the time was actually 5:30 when she approved it (gee, I can't 
subtract 12:00 from military time).  I apologize.

I'm still showing the deal without a contract attached.  Maybe we have a 
Sitara issue if you've already attached a deal.  I know we sometimes to have 
to open another version of deal manager to see a contract, but I've done that 
already and still don't see a contract.  Let me know if you see the same 
thing.

I'm sorry if I came across the wrong way - the trouble with email vs. 
face-to-face communication.  I just wanted to make sure you knew about our 
policy and was afraid someone had overlooked telling you during training.

FYI - once a telephonic deal has a contract attached, it will stay in your 
portfolio until the deal is VALIDATED.

Hope this clears everything up!

Thanks,
SBR

Hi Stacey,

I was not aware of that deal, and actually did not leave till about 5:15 on 
Friday. I have never left any outstanding deals out that I know of.  I have 
two scenarios, either it did not show up on my portfolio immediately after 
being released ( this has happened; where Liz has called and a particulary 
deal has not shown up yet. In that case, I closed and re-opened the 
portfolio) or either there were several fwd's still sitting out in that 
portfolio that had not been removed even though a contract was attached.

It has always been my practice to keep checking the telephonic and make sure 
they do have contracts attached since they sit out there so long.

Thanks,
Sharon

Hi Sharon,

I was checking the portfolios this morning and noticed a deal input on Friday 
around 4:30 that didn't have a contract attached.  We usually don't get too 
many deals coming in that late in the day, but please make sure to check your 
portfolios throughout the day and before you leave.  Even though this deal 
won't flow until 03/01/01, it is our policy to make sure that there are NO 
outstanding deals without contracts attached when we leave the office every 
day.  We will have exceptions, such as waiting on addition information or 
requesting clarification on something, that are OK to leave unattached.  I 
also know that Deal Capture does not always validate deals once we have 
attached contracts, but our group has committed to clear all unattached 
(non-problem) deals each day.

Please let me know if you have any questions or issues with that particular 
deal.  I wasn't sure if you knew our group policy and I just wanted to make 
sure we don't get nailed on it some day.  I know you've been pretty busy 
handling other desks as well, and I appreciate that.

Thanks!
SBR

If you could redraft the "representations and warranties" provision to be
simpler and clearer, I think that we could agree to it.  The other items
look fine.

My reading is that Enron seeks a continuing representation that (i) all
transactions have the appropriate approval, waiving any defense of lack of
authority, (ii) there is no sovereign immunity (something is left out of
thelanguage) defense to any transaction, (iii) payment for the gas will be
first in the flow of funds, and (iv) the obligations are not subject to debt
restrictions or other public funds restrictions of the Texas Constitution,
statutes or CPS constituency documents.  I think we can legally make these
representations and warranties, but the language needs some work.  You
should ask them to redraft this provision so it is simpler and clearer.  Jon

Mr. Wood,

This is a spot gas contract with Enron that you reviewed on August 8th for
Mary Pelayo and Danny McWhirter.  Enron has added a paragraph under
"Representations and Warranties" that I would like you to review.  I am not
sure exactly what it means.  Thank you.

Kathy,

This spot gas contract was reviewed by Jon Wood a few months ago.  The
following was added under "Representations and Warranties" by Enron.  I have
highlighted the text in the attachment so you can see where it was
incorporated (page 2 of Appendix 1).

"Further and with respect to Customer only, Customer represents and warrants
to Company continuing throughout the term of this Agreement as follows:  (i)
all acts necessary to the valid execution and performance of this Agreement
have been duly adopted, (ii) with respect to the contractual obligations
hereunder and performance thereof, it is not entitled to itself or its
revenues or assets from (a) suit, (b) jurisdiction of court, (c) relief by
way of injunction, order for specific performance or recovery of property,
(d) attachment of assets or (e) execution or enforcement of any judgment,
(iii) its obligations to make payments hereunder are unsubordinated
obligations and such payments are operating and maintenance costs which
enjoy first priority of payment at all times under any and all indentures to
which it is a party, its constitutional and governing documents and
applicable law, and (iv) its obligations to make payments hereunder do not
constitute any kind of indebtedness of Customer or create any kind of lien
on, or security interest in, any property or revenues of Customer which, in
either case , is proscribed by any provision of its constitutional and
governing documents, any order to judgment of any court or other agency of
government applicable to it or its assets, or any contractual restriction
binding on or affecting it or any of its assets."

Do you think this is acceptable, or do you think I should show this added
paragraph to Jon Wood?

Please reconfirm as necessary. These were all riding on contracts that have 
been "assigned" to AEP/HPL/Lodisco effective 6/1/01. ENA is no longer party 
to the original agreements. Please note that several of these are EOL 
transactions.

Thank you!

PS, Accounting was not copied on this message as there is no accounting 
impact on the contract # changes (all deals moved have production beginning 
6/1/01 (no additional production was finalized or cleared on these 
transactions under the prior agreement).

Kim,
 I have reviewed your markup of the redlined contract I forwarded to you last 
Wednesday.  Since you confirmed that we were merely putting into place a 
three month contract, we should be able to resolve the issues rather 
quickly.  If we were working on the Master, I would agree that we are a long 
way apart.  Let me respond to the changes you put in your last redline.

 1. Delete the definition of "Credit Support Provider".
 2. Add definition as follows:  The term "Guarantor" means, as to Seller, 
Seller's ultimate parent, Enron Corp.
 3. Restore the definition of Material Adverse Change to the language as 
provided in my redline to you.  It is the position of our Credit Department 
that a rating of BBB- is considered investment grade and as such that is the 
benchmark below which a material adverse change would be triggered.  Enron 
Corp. is currently rates as BBB.
 4. The changes that you made in 2.1.1, 2.1.2, and 2.2.1 are okay.  The 
change that was made to 2.2.2. should be deleted.
 5. The change that was made to 2.3.1 and 2.4.1 is okay. 
 6. The changes that were made in 9.1 should be removed because the sale and 
purchase quantity is based on the DCQ.   Note that all settlements under the 
Contract are based on the DCQ and any variations between actual and DCQ is to 
be handled between the party and its transporter. 
 7. The change in 9.3 should be changed back to five (5) Days instead of 10 
Days.  5 days is the equivalent of 60 days deliveries, changing to 10 would 
mean 65 delivery days have elapsed before the Seller can notify Buyer of a 
payment default.
 8. The change in 10.2 of "at or" should be restored.  This is a 3 month 
deal.  Seller's position is that Buyer is responsible for any taxes at or 
after delivery.  Future Taxes are not applicable to a 3 month deal.
 9. All of the changes made to 12.2, 12.3 and 12.5 should be removed.  There 
is no partial force majeure, a party is either unable to perform because of 
the event or the party can perform.  Please explain how the loss of Buyer's 
market could be due to an event of Force Majeure and why the Buyer should not 
be required to find a new market during such period.  Force Majeure should 
only allow termination if the period extends for more than 180 Days and then 
it should only be a triggering event allowing the other party to terminate 
and collect a Termination Payment.
 10.   The change in 14 should be deleted.  There is no event which would 
allow early termination other than a Triggering Event.  
 11. Please explain the changes in 16.4.  Seller has provided all of the 
notice address information that will be put in the Contract.  No telephone 
number or other address will be added.
 12. All of the changes made to 17.1, 17.2, 17.3 and 17.4 should be deleted 
and the original language provided in my previous redline should be 
restored.  These are requirements set forth by Enron's credit requirement and 
are not subject to negotiation by me.  
 13. I have no problem with the changes proposed for 18.1, 18.2, 18.3 nor the 
addition of 18.4; however, I do not believe that either party would be able 
to locate qualified arbitrators who would agree to the shortened periods.  
Please reconsider.
 14. The changes made to the guaranty document appear to be acceptable and I 
would forward same to Enron Corp. for their consideration.

 Please review the Contract in light of the matters raised above and let me 
have your comments so that we can get this finalized as soon as possible.

Dan-

Attached is a redline document showing our counter to your redline proposal.
The majority of your changes were fine, from my perspective, with minor
tweaking (for example, timelines in arbitration).  The two primary items I
think we will need to discuss are (1) Taxes and (2) the definition of a
Material Adverse Change.  Please see my suggestions and then we can discuss.
As part of this discussion, could you please provide Enron North America
Corp's and Enron Corp's S&P debt ratings?

Please note that any changes we discuss will be subject to the final
approval of Wisconsin Public Service.

Please provide me with an estimated response time (ie, this afternoon,
tomorrow morning), so I can keep WPSC apprised.

Thanks for your help!

referring to (which I believe are rare), I believe the gas is flowing.  The 
meter has been turned on and isn't the pipeline accepting the gas?  We are 
still not nominating the gas, and because we have not put the ticket into the 
system, we are withholding payment.  Now, from what I understand, client 
services will make a manual payment, if they are called by the producer.  
But, for 1 month or even 2 months, we have not made a payment, because client 
services would not have known to make a payment, therefore, we are still in 
violation.  It appears the best solution legally, would be not to turn on the 
meter until the contract is signed.  I'm not sure that is a good business 
decission though.

I know that there are cases where we don't know that the meter is still 
flowing, or that it has been turned on.  I think the easiest thing would be 
to make sure that we are covered with a GTC spot, taking out the language of 
the recorded line.

Julie, 

In response to your concerns below:

1.  The traders on 35 are currently attempting to install a recorded line to 
be used when negotiating.

2.  The difficulty with putting in a contract as unexecuted is that Unify 
will not prevent the payment from going out the door.  I do not believe Unify 
Settlements drafts based on contract status, it drafts on any Sitara deal 
that replicated down, and Sitara reads unexecuted as a valid contract.  

3.  We have posed the possibility of entering the contract as unexecuted and 
enhancing Unify to hold payment as long as there was VP approval to hold 
payment, but Mary Cook said that this process would be in violation of the 
UCC based on the fact that we would partially perform (by accepting the gas 
via the nom/scheduling process).  With this partial performance, withholding 
the payment would not be appropriate under the law.  

Please let me know your thoughts after reviewing my comments.

Thank you, 
Melissa

Subject: GTC'S AND CONFIRMS


While going through our confirmation process, there was some concern raised 
on deals that we are not confirming.  I'm sure you are aware of the concern 
that George W. had with not wanting a confirmation to go out to the producers 
when they were trying to get a firm contract signed.  I spoke with Dan Hyvl 
today and I wanted to relay to you his thoughts.

His first concern was if the Asset Traders were trading on a recorded phone 
lines.  Apparently the GTC's specify that if there is a dispute with what is 
on the confirmation, the recorded phone call would be the back up.  He said 
that if these calls are not recorded, then we should not be using the GTC's.  
In the case where the tickets are being held back until the contract is 
signed (example: a ticket was submitted today to start back in June), then we 
should be putting the contract in as unexecuted so the deal can be valued and 
tracked.  His decision on that issue was based on my memory that if a 
contract is marked unexecuted, Unify would not make payment.  If that is not 
the case, we could still put the contract and deal in the systems, and have a 
VP signed off that payment would not go out the door.

If deals are being done on an unrecorded phone line, Dan said that we would 
need to do something different if the payment is to go out the door.  Like 
for example, have the producer sign a one month contract.  Which I'm not sure 
you would want to do that.  Otherwise, he said that the trades should be sent 
down to 31 so they will be recorded.

I hope this makes sense.  Please call me, and let me know your thoughts.

Julie

I would recommend that once the trueup information is available and verified, 
a credit statement be prepared and forwarded to Heartland, such statement to 
provide that the credit statement is to be used in determining the next 
month's (April) prepayment.  I would not wire them the true-up amount so long

So what should the invoice look like for the March prepayment?  Should I just 
bill them the 1,500/day at the NX3+.34 next Monday; let them pre-pay that and 
then wire them whatever money is owed back to them after the trueup (probably 
sometime mid-April after the pipeline statements have been received and the 
volumes have been acutalized)?  Or does somebody want to estimate what the 
buyback volume and price would be so I can deduct that up front?

Subject: Re: Heartland Invoice for March  

Chuck, The price obtained as the average of the closing price for the last 
three trading days for the month plus $0.34 is to be the price for the next 
month.  We need to give them a credit for the volumes that we purchase back 
due to their volume defaults in the month.  Our buyback price  is to be Gas 
Daily midpoint less $0.15 for the shortfall in volumes.  The $0.15 is the 
penalty for the default and the Gas Daily Midpoint price is what we purchase 
the shortfall back for; but remember if the Gas Daily Midpoint is higher that 
the Nx3, we use the Nx3 as the buyback price for the shortfall.  I know that 
you will not have  all of the information at the time you send them the 
invoice for the next month's prepayment, so you need to keep a schedule and 
trueup each month for the prior months activity.  

John and Patrice, Do you agree with the foregoing?

invoice.  Thanks.

John,

When do you want me to send an invoice to Heartland so they can pre-pay for 
March gas?  I can bill the 1,500/day but I'll need the pricing.  Are we still 
going to use the NX3+.34 for March or do you want to use something else?  The 
NX3 will not be available for March until Monday so that would be the 
earliest I could send it using that price.

Let me know...
Chuck

George,
 I would suggest that the necessary language be added to the Special 
Conditions block of the Transaction Confirmation.  I would suggest the 
following language be inserted in each applicable Transaction Confirmation.

"Notwithstanding anything to the contrary otherwise contained in the 
sentences previously added to the end of Section 13.5, the parties agree that 
the price to be applicable with regard to any volumes outside of the +/-10% 
tolerance shall be the Gas Daily "Daily Mid-point" price for the day 
following the day that the parties discover the existence of volumes outside 
of the +/-10% tolerance."

THE GIFT OF LIFE
 submitted by Amber Tozer
 
On the very first day, God created the cow.  He said to the cow, "Today I 
have created you!  As a cow, you must go to the field with the farmer all day 
long.  You will work all day under the sun!  I will give you a life span of 
50 years."

The cow objected, "What? This kind of tough life you want me to live for 50 
years? Let me have 20 years, and the 30 years I'll give back to you."  So God 
agreed.

On the second day, God created the dog.  God said to the dog, "What you are 
supposed to do is to sit all day by the door of your house.  Any people that 
come in, you will have to bark at them!  I'll give a life span of 20 years."

The dog objected, "What?  All day long to sit by the door? No way!  I give 
you back my other 10 years of life!"  So God agreed.

On the third day, God created the monkey.  He said to the monkey, "Monkeys 
have to entertain people.  You've got to make them laugh and do monkey 
tricks.  I'll give you 20 years life span."

The monkey objected. "What?  Make them laugh?  Do monkey faces and tricks?  
Ten years will do, and the other 10 years I'll give you back."  So God agreed.

On the fourth day, God created man and said to him, "Your job is to sleep, 
eat, and play.  You will enjoy very much in your life.  All you need to do is 
to enjoy and do nothing.  This kind of life, I'll give you a 20 year life 
span."

The man objected.  "What?  Such a good life!  Eat, play, sleep, do nothing?  
Enjoy the best and you expect me to live only for 20 years?  No way, 
man!....Why don't we make a deal?  Since the cow gave you back 30 years, and 
the dog gave you back 10 years and the monkey gave you back 10 years, I will 
take them from you!  That makes my life span 70 years, right?"  So God agreed.

AND THAT'S WHY....
In our first 20 years, we eat, sleep, play, enjoy the best and do nothing 
much.  For the next 30 years, we work all day long, suffer and get to support 
the family.  For the next 10 years, we entertain our grandchildren by making 
monkey faces and monkey tricks.  And for the last 10 years, we stay at home, 
sit by the front door and bark at people!

My time is my own.  I make efficient use of it, and I still have no time for 
reading novels.  If you are inquiring about time that I may have been out of 
the office during the two week period ending today, I was out on Vacation one 
day, that being March 9, 2001.  Any questions?

Dave,
 I have attached the above sample form for your review.  I have been unable 
to find any documentation where we act as an agent for the shipper and 
contractually agree to remarket their unused capacity.  As soon as I find 
some language, I will forward same to you.  As we discussed, the major 
concerns that I have concerning the Energy Marketing Services Agreement form 
that Kaiser provided relates to the duties of the Marketer thereunder.  ENA 
is in the business of buying and selling natural gas for its own account and 
as such any services it agreed to provide relating to most of the items under 
Articles III and IV would be subject to claims of abuse or violation of 
fiduciary duties.  Specifically, ENA should not agree to perform the items 
under  Article IV, Section A. Parts 1-8, 11; Article IV, Section B.  
Parts1-2, 4, 6; Article IV, Sections C, E, and F.  Otherwise, ENA sales 
obligations should be patterned in the manner set forth in the Enfolio 
Contract which provides safeguards for both parties in the event of a default 
by either.  
 Therefore, we need to work from our Enfolio contract and I will get you some 
agency language for the confirm to address how we would share any 
transportation savings that we were able to obtain for them during the term 
of our sales transaction with them.  
 Please call me after you have had a chance to review the contract.

I have received the list of CES agreements which George put together as 
having Texas delivery points and have been attempting to put together a back 
to back agreement similar to the back to back agreement which ENA has with 
CES; however, I keep running into confidentially agreement problems.  I 
understand that these CES agreements relate to June business and have no 
deals and/or term beyond that point.  I suggest that the deliveries under 
these agreements be documented as a GTC Confirmation between ENA and HPL and 
thus avoid the confidentiality agreement problems.  George Weissman and Bob 
Hall feel that this is a workable solution.  We will proceed with the 
preparation of GTC's for each deal unless I hear otherwise.

Teresa,
 I think that the problem is what is meant by "these costs".  Currently we 
think that it will be negative, but until we get the allocations, we won't 
know.  That is the reason we want to go monthly.  Is there a problem getting 
them to sign something if we need to do it for another month.  The terms may 
be different with regard to next months deal.  Please advise.

Teresa,
 I have reviewed the revisions to the VPP transaction with Charlie Otto.  We 
have a concern relating to the term.  The term of this letter should be for 
the period ending April 30, 2001.  The reason for our reluctance in extending 
the term is that we do not know what conditions Texas Gas may put on the next 
OFO nor do we know what conditions El Paso may put on the processing.

Sandi,
 As you know, I am out of the loop relating to the assignment issue.  I 
believe that George Weismann needs to give us an updated list of contracts 
that currently exist together with a list of contracts that need to be put in 
place to match the ENA contracts that ENA now intends to keep, but HPL also 
wants.  The assignment issue has gotten very complicated.  I think that ENA 
wants us to enter into new contracts with the counterparties.  I do not think 
that there are any ENA contracts which need to be assigned to HPL.  There are 
certain contracts that need to be assigned to the new HPL marketing company, 
these being the contracts with Entex, etc., after we decide how ENA also 
wants to keep the right to do business with these entities.  We probably need 
a meeting with George to get updated information on what needs to be done.

Dan,
I am preparing the assignments of ENA contracts going into Lodisco as well as 
those going to HPL. The PSA at exhibit 4.13 (x) lists those going to Lodisco. 
Is that still accurate? If not, can you forward to me an updated list? Also, 
is there a list of those ENA contracts that are to be assigned to HPL rather 
than Lodisco? Let me know--

Thanks,
Sandi

Larry,

Thank you to you and your team for allowing us the opportunity to come and
present.  I apologize for not getting back to you sooner, my attempt to
track down information on Enron and an ammonia forward market has not as of
yet yielded results (I will continue to investigate).

Pursuant to the decision to focus initially financial hedging, risk
management strategies, and to understand Mississippi Chemical's risk
appetite and hedging objectives,  I offer the following questions:

1.  Historically, what percentage of your natural gas consumption have you
hedged?  Are your required to have a specific percentage of your exposure
hedged, with hedge levels depending differing time horizons?
2.  What policies/procedures govern what you can and cannot do with respect
to hedging instruments?
3.  What is Mississippi Chemical's position on transacting over-the-counter
swaps and options?  Is their any policy which requires you to transact on
the exchange?
4.  How far out on the curve can you hedge?
5.  What is the appropriate conversion factor to be used to calculate
natural gas per ton of product produced (our estimate is 25 MMBtu/ton)?
6.  What Green Markets posting (or other postings) are your products tied
to?  If your products are sold based on forward contracts, what is the
normal term of such contracts?  If sold on spot, to what index(es) are they
tied?
7.  What is your internal price forecast for the price of ammonia for the
next year, 2 years, etc?

Hopefully I am not asking for anything too difficult to obtain.  I do
realize we may need to get a confidentiality agreement in place to protect
the transferral of sensitive information.  Please let me know how to
proceed.

Best regards,

Troy Black

Sunday really was good. We had a really good time also. I think Mom enjoyed
it also. Getting together for Mom's birthday sounds great to me Only have
one suggestion. Tell Mom that we are taking her out for her birthday or else
she will try to cook everthing. Then we can all show up with the food.
I don't know what to say about how she would feel about losing control of
her checking account. Some days she seems really concerned about what she
has in the bank and other times she handles things well. She did give Buddy
a signed blank check to go pay for fertilizer on a Sat. and then when he
went to pay for it on Mom. evening she had already gone in and paid for it
herself that morning. She had forgotten she had told him to do it.She still
thinks she will be put in a nursing home if she forgets things. She told us
again Sunday that they put Aunt Minnie in a nursing home because she forgot
the stove on. Though i'm sure it was more to it than that. I'm open to
suggestions.

 All of the sales to Reliant Energy Entex and/or Entex Gas Marketing Company 
should be made by Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.  Please identify the 
two deals that you have under HPL so that we can get them documented under 
the proper ECT agreement.

Dan,

 Why is it that all sells to Reliant Energy - Entex are billed under ECT & 
not HPLC?  I have two spot deals billed to Entex Gas Marketing under HPLC.  
Should these two deals been billed under ECT or is it ok to have a billing to 
Entex Gas Marketing under HPLC?  Could you let me know.

Thanks,

This is in follow-up to the deal transfer matter we discussed this morning.

Julie Meyers called me and stated that Tom Martin had called her to put the 
deal transfer from HPL to ENA on hold till Monday; however, she had already 
moved them in the system.  I asked her to find out if the deals had been 
confirmed under HPL and if so, I would need to prepare a document to transfer 
them from HPL to ENA.  She agreed to send me a list of the deals that had 
been moved and whether or not they had been documented with the 
counterparty.  Apparently, they had been and Jennifer Blay has now 
redocumented two of the deals as ENA deals.

Apparently there is some concern of these deals being moved.  Dan Hyvl would 
like to know if the following deals have been confirmed already under HPLC.

Duke Energy - Q04182
Duke Energy - NZ7880
Western Gas Resources - Q10831

If they have let me know.  I need to send something to Dan and some others.

Robin,
 At Jeff's request, I have reviewed the attached form which National Fuel 
provided.  It is not designed to operate as a Trading Contract.  Transactions 
are only formed by signing an Exhibit A to be prepared by National.  The 
Exhibit A is to have a Daily Transaction Quantity and National may nominate 
from 0 to 100% of that quantity each day.  Penalties only arise if the actual 
quantity deviates from their nominated quantity.  Seller to pay difference 
between Buyer's replacement price and the Gas Commodity Charge times the 
deficiency quantity.  Buyer to pay difference between the Gas Commodity 
Charge and the Daily Midpoint Price times the deficiency quantity.   Does not 
state what quantity is to be applied against the Gas Demand Charge; however, 
does state that if Seller has a force majeure the Gas Demand Charge is only

Demand Charge is not reduced if Buyer declares a Force Majeure.  Buyer's 
payments are to be trued up to the actual quantities delivered should actuals 
deviate from the nominated quantities.  
 Please note the comments I provided to you last year relating to this

Dan:

Could you look at this?  I think we have reviewed it several times before and 
there should be a file.

Thanks

Help, Time Warner is my cable service provider, however, when I attempted to 
open the ordering information, I am told that a discount for TimeWarner cable 
modern service is not available in my area.  What do I need to do?  So far as 
I know, I can subscribe to cable modem service with TimeWarner, however, I 
have been waiting until the ClickAtHome rollout before I committed to any 
service contract.  Can someone get back to me regarding when the discounted 
service might be available, if not, what is the possibility for a discounted 
DSL service from ATT.  Thank you.

Yes if you complete and change "following calendar year" to the "next twelve

Thanks Dan,

They have the Master right now, it should be signed today.  I will fill in 
the blanks on Tuesday morning when we hear from the desk.  Given that they 
sign the Master and we agree on terms, can I use this confirm?

Dave,
 Volume, term and price are necessary components of the confirm.  Do not send 
out without these components being in place.  Also, changing from the January 
dates will require additional language changes.  I will make those changes 
when we fill in the rest of the information.  How do we stand on getting the 
final version of the Master Contract drafted and submitted to them for 
signature.  Remember, we need that in place before we do the confirm.,

Attached is the Clark County confirm you made for me with some minor changes 
(volume term price).  Let me know if it still looks OK.

Thanks,

Gerald,
 Please comment on section 1.6 of the attached document.  I am concerned that 
we might be on the hook for a reimbursement for periods beyond the Term.  Can 
this happen?  If so, is the language in the second attachment sufficient?

 Let's try to get this signed as soon as possible.  The changes are as we 
discussed.  I will be out Monday, but will be able to approve the final

Attached redline contract compares changes we discussed today to the

Charlotte,
 Please explain what you are referring to when you state that Article 12.7 
was omitted by accident.  My copy of the signed agreement has 12.7.  I am 
attaching the proposed Amendment for your review and comments.   I added the 
Gas Daily Midpoint Price to  be used as a default index when a index was not 
specified and for online transactions.  Please review and let me have your 
comments,  if okay, please start the execution process and forward 2 to me 
for signature by ENA.

Kyle,
 All of the sales to Reliant Energy Entex and/or Entex Gas Marketing Company 
should be made by Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.  Please identify the 
two deals that you have under HPL so that we can get them documented under 
the proper ECT agreement.

Dan,

 Why is it that all sells to Reliant Energy - Entex are billed under ECT & 
not HPLC?  I have two spot deals billed to Entex Gas Marketing under HPLC.  
Should these two deals been billed under ECT or is it ok to have a billing to 
Entex Gas Marketing under HPLC?  Could you let me know.

Thanks,
Kyle

If you could redraft the "representations and warranties" provision to be
simpler and clearer, I think that we could agree to it.  The other items
look fine.

My reading is that Enron seeks a continuing representation that (i) all
transactions have the appropriate approval, waiving any defense of lack of
authority, (ii) there is no sovereign immunity (something is left out of
thelanguage) defense to any transaction, (iii) payment for the gas will be
first in the flow of funds, and (iv) the obligations are not subject to debt
restrictions or other public funds restrictions of the Texas Constitution,
statutes or CPS constituency documents.  I think we can legally make these
representations and warranties, but the language needs some work.  You
should ask them to redraft this provision so it is simpler and clearer.  Jon

Mr. Wood,

This is a spot gas contract with Enron that you reviewed on August 8th for
Mary Pelayo and Danny McWhirter.  Enron has added a paragraph under
"Representations and Warranties" that I would like you to review.  I am not
sure exactly what it means.  Thank you.

Kathy,

This spot gas contract was reviewed by Jon Wood a few months ago.  The
following was added under "Representations and Warranties" by Enron.  I have
highlighted the text in the attachment so you can see where it was
incorporated (page 2 of Appendix 1).

"Further and with respect to Customer only, Customer represents and warrants
to Company continuing throughout the term of this Agreement as follows:  (i)
all acts necessary to the valid execution and performance of this Agreement
have been duly adopted, (ii) with respect to the contractual obligations
hereunder and performance thereof, it is not entitled to itself or its
revenues or assets from (a) suit, (b) jurisdiction of court, (c) relief by
way of injunction, order for specific performance or recovery of property,
(d) attachment of assets or (e) execution or enforcement of any judgment,
(iii) its obligations to make payments hereunder are unsubordinated
obligations and such payments are operating and maintenance costs which
enjoy first priority of payment at all times under any and all indentures to
which it is a party, its constitutional and governing documents and
applicable law, and (iv) its obligations to make payments hereunder do not
constitute any kind of indebtedness of Customer or create any kind of lien
on, or security interest in, any property or revenues of Customer which, in
either case , is proscribed by any provision of its constitutional and
governing documents, any order to judgment of any court or other agency of
government applicable to it or its assets, or any contractual restriction
binding on or affecting it or any of its assets."

Do you think this is acceptable, or do you think I should show this added
paragraph to Jon Wood?

Gerald/Eric-

I have a couple of questions regarding TGLO transport contract 
012-88494-202.  We are currently delivering a volume of 28.000mm into various 
Midcon interconnects on this contract that are designated to go to 
Reliant/Entex for the purpose of heating HISD schools.  The transport 
contract stipulates different rates for this delivery depending on whether 
the gas is intended for state facilities or not.  My first question, then, 
is:  are HISD schools considered state facilities?  And, if HISD schools are 
considered state facilities, does the fact that this gas is being delivered 
to them via Reliant/Entex utilizing Midcon's pipe make any difference?

I am asking these questions not only to assure that we are recouping the 
correct transport rate, but also to determine what the consequences might be 
if I interrupt this delivery.  We are having difficulty getting enough gas 
into Midcon to cover our Entex noms and I am just exploring my options.  I 
would also expect that this volume should decrease when HISD closes for the 
Christmas holidays- does the fact that this is an IT agreement give me enough 
leverage to cut this nom if TGLO does not do so voluntarily?

Thanks for your help.

THE BLONDE KIDNAPPER

A blonde was down on her luck. In order to raise some money, she decided to 
kidnap a kid and hold him for ransom. She went to the playground, grabbed a 
kid, took him behind a tree, and told him, "I've kidnapped you." She then 
wrote a note saying, "I've kidnapped your kid. Tomorrow morning, put $10,000 
in a paper bag and put it under the pecan tree next to the slide on the north 
side of the playground. Signed, a blonde." The blonde then pinned the note to 
the kid's shirt and sent him home to show it to his parents.

The next morning the blonde checked, and sure enough, a paper bag was sitting 
beneath the pecan tree. The blonde opened the bag and found the $10,000 with 
a note that said, "How could you do this to a fellow blonde?"

Please generate a GISB for Jared using the attached.  Let's discuss their 
addendum.  I don't think we will use it.  Let's get a copy of our current 
interruptible agreement so that we can see what has been previously agreed to.

Dan,

ENA and FGU currently operate under an interruptible agreement inherited 
through the CES purchase.  FGU has interest in getting a GISB in place with 
the attached provisions.  Could you please review and let me know you 
comments.  I would like to complete this process quickly.

Jared,
As we discussed earlier today, FGU is interested in purchasing firm supply at 
a fixed price for summer and/or winter.  Currently, Enron and FGU only have 
an interruptible contract in place for supply purchases.  In order to get a 
firm contract in place in a short amount of time, I think we should execute a 
GISB contract if Enron is acceptable to that.  I have attached two word 
documents to be implemented into the GISB contract.  One is FGU's general 
information and the other is our special provisions.  Please have your 
contract department implement the attached information into a GISB contract 
and have it sent to me for review and execution.  If your contract department 
has any questions, please have them call me at 352-334-0776.
Thank you!
Michelle

copies of each document and give them to her boss for signature.  I have 
reviewed the form of the agreements with Mitch Dutton and agreed that they 
are these transporter's typical form.  If time would permit, I suggested they 
negotiate the penalty language, otherwise the forms are okay.  Call me at

Ellen,
 I received your voice mail and your email this morning.  I made each of the 
changes from your email to the two contract documents.  Please review and if 
acceptable, please start the execution process by printing two originals of 
each document.  Once signed by Reliant, please forward to me and I will have 
ENA sign their contract and I will attempt to get Enovate to sign and return 
their contract and the two transaction agreements to me for forwarding one 
fully set to you.  Please call if you have any questions.  My phone number is

Bridgette,
 To the best of my knowledge, we are not working on a contract with 
Washington Energy.  Has anyone asked the gas trader assigned to that account 
about any contract drafts that the gas trader may have received and not 
forwarded to legal.

Jeanne,

As I explained to Terry on Monday or Tuesday, according to the notes within 
Global Contracts database, K#96030149 is an unexecuted contract and it 
currently has a status of expired .  Because of these factors, we suggested 
that the deal be re-entered and a GTC attached to it until a contract can be 
negotiated and executed.  

Unfortunately Global Contracts database is inoperative this morning so I 
cannot give you any further information regarding any other notes for that 
particular K#.  Please let me know if the suggestion that has been made is 
feasible. 

Dan- to the best of your knowledge, has there or will there be a contract 
drafted for Washington Energy?

Regards,
Bridgette

Extend the deal as a month to month ( that would be the default of the

John - I am trying to cover to Terry who is out of the office for the rest of 
the week.      I am working on some issue with Gloria and I need your help on 
one:

The deal ticket (#226330)  for Washington Energy Company for purchases from 
meters 602368 and 602467 on CGAS was only set up through 10/31/00.    It had 
a fixed price of $2.91  with a gathering deduct of ($0.27).          Is ENA 
still purchasing this gas in November ?   What is the pricing structure 
?      I was reluctant to have Global contracts extend the existing contract 
with the fixed price without your approval.

Please let me know via email what the terms of this purchase deal should be 
going forward.

If you need to call me,  I am still working from home   281-286-7153     ( I 
will be gone from about 9:30 - 1:00 on Thursday for physical therapy)

Okay, I wasn't sure who to route this to, but one of our traders gave Claire 
Neri at UGI my name and number to help with information about our contracts. 
As it turns out, we do not have a Master Contract with UGI but have a firm 
term deal  attached to a GTC (Deal #345010, running from 11/1/00 - 3/31/01, 
5380 MMBTu/day @ $4.78, meter #103702 on ANR).

UGI's hope is to get a Master agreement in place ASAP to cover the above 
mentioned deal & any new inter gas deals (since she sent their master, I'm 
assuming that their intent is to put their master in place ASAP). Claire Neri 
can be reached at 610-796-3505 for additional information of 
changes/negotiations. 

Note: UGI is also an EOL "Investment Grade" counterparty for non-Texas natual 
gas.

Dan,

Sorry it's taken me so long to get back to you on this -- I got
sent out to the field for most of the day.

Can you send me your fax number so I can get you the
legal description.

Also, I don't think a duration time is necessary.  It would
be in HPL's best interest to have this easement in
perpetuity.  HPL will have the right to abandon the line
in place if it so chooses.

Thank you for your excellent and fast help!!!

Robert,
 Where is the description of our right-of-way which we want to put in this 
document before we send it out.  I think we need to change the first 
paragraph, but I need to see the description to verify.  Is it intended that 
we are dealing with only one owner, or is this developer using a different 
ownership for each development.  Maybe it is all one development?  Otherwise 
the form looks okay.  Should we consider adding language regarding duration 
of easement grant, i.e. abandonment after 5 years of non-use.

Dan,

I have previously discussed this proposed easement with Barbara
and Ann Elizabeth.  In a nutshell, a large developer wishes us to
define a series of mainly undefined easements in Fort Bend 
and Brazoria Counties.  My response to them was to release the
earlier easements and in their place sign a single new easement with
language most favorable to HPL.

Attached is a draft of my proposed easement.  Please review
and make any changes you deem necessary or desirable.

Thanks!!!

Arthur Davidson, of the Harley Davidson Motorcycle Corporation, died and
went to heaven.  At the gates, St.  Peter told Arthur, "Since you've
such a good man and your motorcycles have changed the world, your reward is,
you can hang out with anyone you want in Heaven." Arthur thought about it
for a minute and then said, "I want to hang out with God." St.  Peter took 
Arthur to the Throne Room, and introduced him to God.  Arthur then asked God, 
"Hey,aren't you the inventor of woman?" God said, "Ah, yes." "Well," said 
Arthur,"professional to professional, you have some major design flaws in 
your invention. 
1.  There's too much inconsistency in the front-end protrusion. 
2.  It chatters constantly at high speeds. 
3.  Most of the rear ends are too soft and wobble too much. 
4.  The intake is placed way to close to the exhaust.  And finally, 
5.  The maintenance costs are outrageous." 
"Hmmmm, you may have some good points there," replied God, "hold on." God 
went to his Celestial super computer, typed in a few words and waited for the 
results.  The computer printed out a slip of paper and God read it.  "Well, 
it may be true that my invention is flawed," God said to Arthur, "but 
according to these numbers,more men are riding my invention than yours."

Kim,
 What is meant by a "new review of this agreement"?  Have they reviewed the 
master previously?  If so, I have been wasting my time inserting the credit 
requirements into the standard agreement?  
 I have reviewed the contract form that they provided and it is lacking in 
numerous areas.  I think it is a form they put together for use with a 
Canadian producer.  The remedy for a default is determined by the sales or 
purchase price that the other party can negotiate, as such ENA cannot comply 
because we do not allow anyone the ability to review our contracts with other 
parties.  The form also has no credit provisions, no limitation of liability 
provisions, no acceleration provisions in the event of default, etc.  
Additionally, a transaction can only be done by signing a confirm, and if not 
signed, no agreement.  
 Let's discuss where we go from here.

Kim,
 I received the documents late yesterday.  I am in the process of comparing 
the hard copy to the marked up version we have been working with.  Once I 
finish, I will forward the two originals of the guaranty document to Enron 
Corp for their review and execution.  Once I receive it back, I will let you 
know.  I will forward two copies of the contract document to the deal contact 
for that departments review.  Likewise, I will let you know when it has been 
signed.  I cannot at this time tell you when this may be. 
 If you need quicker turnaround, we might consider counterpart execution 
which would permit the documents to be signed simultaneously by WPSC.  
 Why are you requesting an original signed copy for the consultant.  A copy 
should be sufficient. Don't you agree.

regassified LNG to SCS for use  in a potential new plant to be built in
McIntosh, Georgia, together with the confirmation letter containing the

 Attached are the two transactions that result from spliting the original

to reflect an agreement for Transaction No. 1 dated March 22, 2001 instead of 
March 5, 2001 and they should provide for a complete assignment of that 
Transaction No. 1. Document 2001-23acrfm relates to Transaction No. 1.  Don't 
you agree?  If you agree, please print off 2 originals each and send one of 
each to Crestar, and email a copy of each to Bob Bowen for his Confirm 
Records.

There is one revision to the volumes, they are  11,740  and 8260     rather

 The problem is that they do not want to assign the agreement.  They want to 
do a partial assignment which is unacceptable unless we can severe the 
document so that we have two separate stand alone pieces of paper after the 
assignment.  Talk to them about doing two Spot Confirmations, one for 0 to 
8,400 MMBtu per day which would not be assignable, and the other one for 0 to 
11,600 MMBtu per day which would be assignable to BP.  Call me so that we can

Mary,
 I see that Phil Bair from JWorthan has responded to Phil DeMoes concerning 
the bond term.  No comments were made concerning the legal opinion for the 
legal counsel for the bond provider.  I was going to suggest that the 
contract language be modified to provide that the Company had a reasonable 
amount of time at the end of the lst 5 yr bond term to provide a substitute 
bond for the remaining term and that if the Company was able to get a 
replacement bond in place before the expiration of such period, no default 
would occur.  Can you tell from the letter that Phil Bair is proposing if 
their are any other issues that either ENRON or the Bond Provider would have 
concerning the terms of the Bond and the Customer's methods of getting 
funding thereunder.

Take a look at this letter prepared by our surety provider on the PEAK

I've made calls to several of the major sureties this morning to re-confirm 
the availability of long term/non-cancellable bonds.  Five years is the 
general ceiling.  We need to be careful  PEAK understands that if the surety 
elects not to renew at the end of the first five years, this does not trigger 
an automatic demand against the bond.  PEAK should already know the issues 
involved from the surety side based on previous negotiations they had with 
other energy marketers when this project was negotiated (without success) 
last fall.  This is not an Enron issue-it goes to commercial availability.

Call me with your comments.  Thanks.

Can you handle this for Mark?  I have taken a quick run through and one thing

limitation of liability section similar to section 13.2 from the Duke form 
should be added and that (ii) of Section X (C0) be deleted unless the company 
can make the warranty relating to all gas being ultimately consumed in 
Texas.  Please call if you need anything further.

Jared,
 The CES GISB was never entered into between CES and FGU.  I have reviewed 
their requested special provisions and they do not make any sense.  Why 
should we pay the 5 days before they pay us if we are each selling to the 
other, the imbalance provisions works the way it is set up in the GISB and 
their language does not.  Theirs attempts to roll defaults and imbalances 
together and those are two separate concepts.  As such I have instructed 
Debra to prepare our standard GISB with our standard special provisions and 
forward same to Michelle and yourself.  If you have any questions please call 
me and we can discuss.

Jared,
As we discussed earlier today, FGU is interested in purchasing firm supply at 
a fixed price for summer and/or winter.  Currently, Enron and FGU only have 
an interruptible contract in place for supply purchases.  In order to get a 
firm contract in place in a short amount of time, I think we should execute a 
GISB contract if Enron is acceptable to that.  I have attached two word 
documents to be implemented into the GISB contract.  One is FGU's general 
information and the other is our special provisions.  Please have your 
contract department implement the attached information into a GISB contract 
and have it sent to me for review and execution.  If your contract department 
has any questions, please have them call me at 352-334-0776.
Thank you!
Michelle

Jim,
 I will work on the Transaction Agreement which will go with the Master Sales 
Contract.  I just go a voice mail from Credit indicating who was working on 
your deal.  I am waiting for a credit worksheet from them so that I can start 
on the Contract.  Once the contract is completed, I will prepare the 
Transaction Agreement.  I will need to talk with you cause I noted several 
omissions in the language.  Under certain conditions, the transporter will 
not allow the over supplier to resell the volumes, they may be merely cashed 
out.  Do you agree.  What is the Purchase Index?  Is it Inside FERC Henry Hub 
first of the month  or is it some other index or is it daily.  Let's 
discuss.  I will be here today and next week.  Friday is iffy.

Veronica,
 The credit language is only one of many areas of disagreement between the 
consultants view of what the contract should look like and our version.  
Their last response was that the MAC would be triggered if Enron Corp. fell 
below an A rating.  I informed them that we could not agree because it was my 
understanding that Enron Corp. was currently rated as BBB.  I will let you 
know if you need to be involved in the contract negotiation or 
non-negotiation in the future.  I do not currently have a response from the 
consultant as to our last position on her nonagreement to make the necessary 
changes so that we could agree to document the 3month deal.

Dan,

I've looked through the contract (at least the credit terms).  Of course I 
prefer to keep our credit language w/ the mac language of ratings decline.  I 
am not too familiar w/ the transaction itself.  I simply feel that if it 
truly is just a 3 month transaction, we may not need to 1) argue this much 
further and add special language to a confirm 2) issue out a $10MM gty (or if 
we do make it valid for only the three month term as it ties to the contract 
itself)

Please let me know what you think.  The marketer and the counterparty contact 
on the deal have been calling me for a response.

Veronica

Subject: WPS: redline version




Veronica,

Attached is a redline version of the entire contract with Wisconsin Public
Service.  It includes all the changes requested by Dan Hyvl.  It has been
edited with my counter (i.e. - striking what not acceptable/relevant and
providing underlined substitute).

One thing I'd like you to consider in your review is the term and scope of
this contract.  The contract is for 12/00 - 2/01, 3 months, only.
Furthermore, the contract language covers just this transaction - it is NOT
the base document for future transactions.  I will begin work with Enron
early next year on a Master Contract to cover all future transactions.

With that in mind, I'd like to suggest that we remove any reference to a
Material Adverse Change.  It is currently a new and unsettling concept to
WPS, particularly their Credit Dept.  Given that (1) the contract is short
duration and (2) it is extremely unlikely that WPS will fall even to a BBB
ratings within this time period, I feel removal of this language would
greatly improve the chances of getting a meaningful contract in place
quickly (note today is the effective date).  I will work with WPS on this
concept for the future Master Contract.

I am leaving for lunch but will be back shortly.

Thanks for your help with this.

A couple of changes need to be made:

? Les thought we should add Enron LNG Marketing LLC as a signature party.  
Will having just ENA cover us?  If not, do we need to have both ENA and Enron 
LNG be named throughout the document?
? typo on Southern on 2nd and 3rd page titles.

We are ok with the structure of the deal as discussed ( Purchase 4000 @ day 
MichCon @ NYMEX + 0.21(0.20) with an option to fix the price -  APR - OCT).  
However we would like to have this done under a contract. 

Dan, we want to know whether we should do this under a "Master Purchase" or a 
"Master Purchase, Sale".  


Thanks

Cary,
 Please review the attached netting agreement.  It only applies to the two 
contracts referenced in Paragraph No. 1.  If acceptable, please print two 
originals, sign and return to me.  I will have it signed by ENA and return a 
fully executed original to you.

Barry,
 Item 2 of the attached document states that Section 8 does not apply to this 
confirmation.  Why can't we change the language to state that Sections 2, 5 
and 8 do not apply to this confirmation.  I would prefer to do this in lieu 
of changing the standard GTC terms and conditions.  Otherwise, what is meant 
by the language "if the replacement price is not representative of the market 
price, the parties may agree to use a fixed price in lieu of the index price"?

Michael,
 
 Gary asked me to review your requested changes and provide revised documents 
for your review and, if acceptable, execution. Attached please find 
2001-012bcrfm which is the extension document, 2001-012abbcrfm which is the 
clean copy of the long term document modified as discussed in 1,2 and 3 
below, and 2001-012abbrcrfm with is the red-line of the changes which have 
been incorporated in the clean version of the long term document.

 1.  I have left the reference in 3) to MinDQ, because the DCQ should always 
be less than the MinDQ and as such, any short fall in required purchases less 
than the MinDQ (which includes the DCQ) will be bought back by the Company.   
I have added a sentence at the end to provide that Customer will be credited 
for the Buyback Volume which Company purchases from Customer.  By way of 
examples,  (A) assume that the DCQ for a day was set at 15,000; that 
Customer's total natural gas requirements for such day was 20,000; and 
Customer's actual purchases from Company for such day was 12,000.  In that 
event the MinDQ would be 20,000 and Customer would purchase 15,000 from 
Company at the price in 1); Customer would purchase 5,000 from Company at the 
price in 2); and Company would purchase 8,000 from Customer at the price in 
3).  (B) assume that the DCQ for a day was set at 15,000; that Customer's 
total natural gas requirements for such day was 12,000; and Customer's actual 
purchases from the Company for such day was 12,000.  In that event the MinDQ 
would be 15,000 and Customer would purchase 15,000 from Company at the price 
in 1) and Company would purchase 3,000 from Customer at the price in 3).

 2. I have added your requested paragraph 4) to provide that should 
Customer's total natural gas requirements be below the DCQ and the parties 
are able to agree on a reduced DCQ below Customer's total natural gas 
requirements, then no buyback would be applicable.

 3. I have revised the last sentence of the Fixed Price Strategies as you 
requested.

Dan and Craig,

Can you please take a look at Tenaska's incoming gty format, as their 
guarantor has changed and subsequently new gty's need to be issued for both 
ENA and ECC.  As the current gty's expire at the end of the month, it is 
imperative that we give Tenaska feedback as soon as we are able to in order 
to have the gty's executed on their end.  The gty format is attached in the 
email below.

Thanks again for your prompt attention,

Lavonne and I  visited with Mom Sunday afternoon.  We cooked outside and had 
a great time.  Mom said that she might want to fix noodle soup on Mothers 
Day.  That would be great.  We can supplement with sausage or hamburgers on 
the grill.  What do you think.  Mom's memory appears to be good about many 
things, and then some things just don't seem to register.  She seemed 
confused about whether Bettye had been their for Easter.  Is this normal, 
what type of medication is the doctor having her take to combat the loss of 
memory?  Maybe we can all get together Mothers Day and visit.  Email me back 
please.

 Another matter to deduct from the payments to be credited as a result of 
Heartland's deficiency receipts.
Let me know if you have any problems getting the info from Patrice.

In addition, to learning about the $0.15 default allowance for buyback 
volumes, I have also discovered that we need to deduct another $0.15 to $0.18 
per MMBtu to cover firm transportation costs that we incur as a result of 
this transaction.  The cost will vary depending on the fuel costs.  The 
transport cost is made up of $0.0103 commodity fee, $0.07 demand fee and fuel 
of 1%.

Please provide some direction on this, as I will need to adjust the pricing 
in sitara, but would like to make sure that I'm performing the correct 
procedure.

Thanks for your help.

P.S. I do agree with your last e-mail .

If she notifies you that the changes are okay, then you may print 2

Kim,
 Stacy (Dickson) Granmayeh has reviewed the proposed Master Contract that y=
ou=20
drafted for enovate, L.L.C. and I have likewise reviewed the proposed Maste=
r=20
Contract that you forwarded to Enron North America Corp.

 As I indicated earlier, these contracts are similar to the contract we=20
started with last year in documenting the transaction that was ultimately=
=20
entered into.  I recall providing a copy of our Sample Enfolio Master Firm=
=20
Purchase/Sale Agreement together with the credit departments requirements=
=20
which they required in order to enter into the transaction.  I am told that=
=20
those credit requirements relating to triggering events and collateral=20
threshold will also be necessary before Enron North America Corp. can enter=
=20
into a transaction this year.

 Unless I specifically state that a comment relates to enovate or to Enron,=
=20
these comments relate to both entities.

 1. The correct name for enovate is:  enovate, L.L.C.

 2. Change the Confirming Party in Section 3.12 to Seller.

 3. Section 4.1 needs to be altered in such a way to make the verbal=20
agreement of the Parties binding at the time of the phone call.  As written=
,=20
any agreement between the Parties is not binding until a Transaction=20
Confirmation is executed by both Parties.

 4. The word "Contract" in Section 5.1.1.b. should be changed to=20
"Transaction".

 5. The concept of "Point(s) of Receipt" and "Point(s) of Sale" need to be=
=20
collapsed into Point(s) of Delivery at which point title and possession is=
=20
transferred from the Seller to the Buyer. No need for two separate concepts=
.

 6. Delete Sections 6.5 and 6.6 in their entireties.

 7. Alter Section 8.3.3 concerning Locked Prices in such a way to make the=
=20
Locked Prices binding at the time of the phone call; not upon the passage o=
f=20
48 hours for receipt of confirmation.

 8. The term "Commodity Charge Index Adjustment" used in Section 8.1, 8.2 a=
nd=20
8.3 needs to be defined.

 9. The first sentence of Section 10.3 should be altered to delete the last=
=20
phrase =01&of the negligence of the other Party=018 and include the followi=
ng=20
phrase in its place:  =01&the gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad f=
aith=20
of the other Party.=018
=20
 10. Delete the phrase =01&(not via facsimile)=018 from the first sentence =
of=20
Section 12.1.

 11. Add the following phrase at the end of Section 15.3: =01&; the loss of=
=20
Buyer=01,s Markets; or Buyer=01,s inability economically to use or resell g=
as=20
purchased hereunder.=018

 12. Delete the phrase =01&or Buyer or Seller claims force majeure for a pe=
riod=20
exceeding seven (7) cumulative days or five (5) consecutive days during the=
=20
Transaction Term=018 in Section 16.1.b.

 13. Add the following sentence to the end of Section 16.1.e:  =01&Party fa=
ils=20
to perform any covenant set forth in this Contract.=018

 14. Delete the third sentence of Section 16.2 in its entirety.

 15. Delete Section 16.3.d in its entirety.

 16. The Corporate Guarantee in Section 19 should be a payment guarantee no=
t=20
a performance guarantee.

 17. With regard to enovate, change =01&Wisconsin=018 to =01&Illinois=018 i=
n Section=20
21.5; and with regard to Enron, change "Wisconsin" to "Texas" in Section 21=
.5.

 18. Section 21.7 requires =01&mutual execution of an appropriate supplemen=
tal=20
written Transaction Confirmation=018 for an effective modification.  This=
=20
conflicts with Section 8.3.3, which does not require execution of a=20
Transaction Confirmation for a Locked Price.

 19. Delete Section 22.e in its entirety.

 20. In Exhibit A, delete Section 12, Regulatory Contingency, in its entire=
ty.

 Please review the foregoing and provide revised contracts to both enovate=
=20
and Enron for further review in accordance with the foregoing matters.

Hello Dan,

I'm going to be in Houston next week and I wonder if you might have a few 
minutes that I could stop by and speak with you about my Kaiser gas deal.  
Please let me know if there might be a good time on Tuesday or Wednesday.

Thanks,

Subject: Sample Enfolio Contract Form Attached



Dave,
 I have attached the above sample form for your review.  I have been unable 
to find any documentation where we act as an agent for the shipper and 
contractually agree to remarket their unused capacity.  As soon as I find 
some language, I will forward same to you.  As we discussed, the major 
concerns that I have concerning the Energy Marketing Services Agreement form 
that Kaiser provided relates to the duties of the Marketer thereunder.  ENA 
is in the business of buying and selling natural gas for its own account and 
as such any services it agreed to provide relating to most of the items under 
Articles III and IV would be subject to claims of abuse or violation of 
fiduciary duties.  Specifically, ENA should not agree to perform the items 
under  Article IV, Section A. Parts 1-8, 11; Article IV, Section B.  
Parts1-2, 4, 6; Article IV, Sections C, E, and F.  Otherwise, ENA sales 
obligations should be patterned in the manner set forth in the Enfolio 
Contract which provides safeguards for both parties in the event of a default 
by either.  
 Therefore, we need to work from our Enfolio contract and I will get you some 
agency language for the confirm to address how we would share any 
transportation savings that we were able to obtain for them during the term 
of our sales transaction with them.  
 Please call me after you have had a chance to review the contract.

Ellen,
 Is this what you are talking about.  If so, I prepared this amendment so 
that we could get out of a bad trading position.  The customer had the right 
to use first of the month pricing on volume swings.  I believe that Lee 
Papayoti did the deal.  Gary Chapman with Union Carbide indicated that the 
deal is done, however, we are waiting on signatures.

Leslie,
 I have reviewed the product descriptions for the natural gas products on 
Dynegydirect and they appear to be standard descriptions which should be 
easily understood by our traders.  As such, I am comfortable with such 
descriptions.

Please notify both me and Sheri Thomas via e-mail as soon as you are

Thank you so much.  Have a happy holiday.

not, please fill in the name and forward to me for initialling before the

Joan,
 Attached is the Letter Agreement for St. Mary's Production LLC.  According 
to Charlie, St. Mary's production is being delivered at the same points as is 
the Hunt Southern Louisiana production.  Therefore, the St. Mary's letter is 
identical to the Hunt letter which Charlie is sending to Hunt today.  If this 
is not the case, please let me know and I will modify to fit the terms of the 
St. Mary's deal.  Otherwise, please print off as many originals as you need 
and send them to St. Mary's for their execution and return.  Please call if 
you have any questions.

Steve,
 I made the same change to both Oneok and PG&E regarding payment following 
the service month.  Is this correct.  Please check each document and if okay, 
please forward to the counterparty for their execution and return.

 Normally, the bill of sale is used to transfer personal property and the 
deed to transfer real property.  If we are only selling the real property, no 
bill of sale is needed.

Richard,
 This is getting out of hand.  Do we have any master type documents with any 
Sempra entities and if so what is the relationship of the current party to 
the one we may have a master with?  If we have no master, then of course we 
need to have a fully signed GTC confirm signed by both enron and sempra.  
Thank you.

Dan, istead of assigning the contract I would prefer to set up another 
contract under HPLC and assign that one.
What do you think?  I understood that the purchaser of HPl was to get all 
Texas deals and since this was in ENA for regulatory reasons, just like 
Entex, it would be assigned to the new marketing entity that was being set 
up.  Has something changed so that these utility accounts are not going to 
the purchaser of HPL business?
Also, I need to amend the Southern union contract  at Austin (Colorado River 
Sation) to refect a swap from index to fixed price.  Can someone send me the 
original deal so that I can see what needs to be amended?

Russell,
 Please review the attached draft of the draft Enfolio Master Firm 
Purchase/Sale Agreement which has been drafted based on Exxon's comments as 
necessary changes before they will allow the Mobil plant to schedule gas 
under the terms of the October 1, 1995 Agreement.  I have merely incorporated 
the credit language that was used in the October 1, 1995 agreement into this 
agreement and have attempted to make the other changes that Exxon was 
requesting.  Question, is the parent company still Mobil Corp. for the 
purposes of the MAC.  Do you still agree with the prior credit requirements 
as provided in the October 1, 1995 agreement, and if not, please provide me 
with your updated requirements as early as possible this morning so that I 
can incorporate into the agreement prior to presenting it to them for further 
negotiation later today.

Lee,
 Please review the attached so that we can discuss which of their changes 
have been made, which we did not make and the reasons therefor.  The quick 
points being:  sentence at end of 2.3 which takes the place of their items 
1-4; $0.15 to $0.05 in 3.2 and 3.4; item (iii) in 4.2 per their request #5 
except I changes 30 business days to simply 30 days; I did not give them 
their request #6 except I did incorporate the last two sentences of their 
request; I attempted to give them all of their requested #7 except I reworded 
slightly for balance and the items we previously discussed; did not do 
request #8 because we will incorporate that in the Transaction Agreement; 
gave them their request #9, gave them their request #10 except I left in the 
"as is, where is" and the line they omitted when they retyped; did not do 
their item #11, added section 8.9 for termination of prior agreement; added 
their items #12 and #13 but modified as we discussed; otherwise I updated the 
contract and changed references for Buyer's Transporter to simply Company.  
Anything else?

.

Linda, Elizabeth Hernandez thought I should contact you about ENA Texas 
contracts.  Are the contracts we have in place as ENA sufficient to handle 
deals that once was done as HPL but will be done as ENA going forward?  We 
are wanting to make sure that we do not have to renegotiate contracts with 
our counterparties or be caught off guard by a contract not being in place 
once the AEP transaction is complete.  Basically, do we have the contracts in 
place to hit the floor running after the HPL sale to AEP goes through?

I agree, Sunday was really enjoyable. It was so nice to have all the moms
that are still with us around and to be able to serve them for once.
Celebrating Mom's birthday on Saturday should be great. Just let me know
what to bring and I'll be there.
In regards to Mom...yes, she seems quite concerned about us putting her into
a nursing home if she lets on that she forgets things; she was almost in
tears when she talked about it, remember Doris? Anyway, we need to attempt
to assure her that won't happen as long as she continues to take her tests
and medicines as she needs to.
I agree with Bill that we might want to consider a checking account which
requires 2 signatures over a certain amount (say $500 or $1000..whatever we
agree is a "safe" amount)...Doris would be the most likely candidate, I
feel, since she is there and much more aware of Mom's daily needs or
desires. She must understand that by doing this, we would not "take control"
of her money...just help her "remember" payment of large purchases. She
still needs to be able to buy what she wants or needs...Our concern is
someone "conning" her out of money without her realization of it.Requiring 2
signatures on checks over a certain dollar amount would help, I feel.
Anyway, you'all think about it. Other suggestions? Doris, you see the
day-to-day activities, so you are probably best to bring to Dan and my
attention matters that appear to be a problem for Mom....and between the 3
of us, surely we can work out a solution that helps Mom and still lets her
maintain her dignity and respect.
OK>>>>see you'all on the 3rd...let me know what things I need to
bring..Wanna get a gift? I was thinking that a Bunn coffee maker would be so
nice for her...quick coffee, and ready whenever she wants it...plus maybe it
won't spill all over the counter, etc. when poured..Think about it, if
you'all want to go in on it together...If not for her birthday..maybe
Christmas? ..Just a thought.

Effective 2/1/01 the above mentioned CP's merged to form El Paso Merchant 
Energy, L.P.   Both CP's has an acceptable GISB.  Could you please look over 
the GISB for Coastal  (attached) so that we can determine whether to 
terminate this contract?  In case you wanted to view El Paso's GISB, I have 
attached it also.



Thanks,
Bridgette

No, I did not get a call from Jessica.  Therefore, I do not know if this got 
resolved or not.  Did Jessica know anything about someone nominating gas at 
Pip 3152 on NGPL and if so, had they resolved the issues with Falesc Oil 
Company.  The attorney name was Greg Bandelee, spelling unknown, at (217) 
234-4204.

I just wanted to make sure that you got your problem resolved last Friday.  
Jessica White, who schedules NGPL, should have given you a call.  I meant to 
call and check that afternoon to make sure, but got busy on something.  If 
you would just respond to this email letting me know if everything is 
resolved, that would be great.

Thanks,

Steve

Here is another incident stemming from the A-S 30 inch pipeline rupture of 
December 4, 2000.  Although the facts are still being developed, this 
customer was also being supplied off of the A-S line and when it went down, 
HPL had to activate another pipeline to serve this customer from a different 
source or direction.  This line may have had some liquids settled in the line 
or other sediments which became dislodged and ultimately may have caused a 
failure at Ameripol's boiler.  This resulted in a fire which they claim 
caused equipment and product damages.  Liquids are not identified in the 
quality specifications for the gas to be delivered to Ameripol, only not more 
than 20 grains of sulfur or 7 pounds of water vapor.
Additionally, the contract does contain a waiver of consequential damages.  
Gary indicated to me that they told him that about $130,000 of the loss was a 
result of lost sales due to the inability to produce product.  They have 
faxed us a written demand or notification which I will forward as soon as I 
receive it.

Wayne,
 I have modified the above contract as we discussed.  The "Customer's Agent" 
language is contained in Appendix "1".  Please have the contract signed by 
JER Partners, a J.E. Robert Company and fax it back to me.  I will then have 
it signed by Houston Pipe Line Company.  I have left the attachment at the 
end as originally drafted until I am able to talk to Gary Lamphier.  If it is 
truly correct that there are no minimum quantity obligations under the deal, 
then Gary may have to reprice the $0.09 discount for the 1000/d.  I will 
leave that up to Gary and you to resolve.

Robert,
 Where is the description of our right-of-way which we want to put in this 
document before we send it out.  I think we need to change the first 
paragraph, but I need to see the description to verify.  Is it intended that 
we are dealing with only one owner, or is this developer using a different 
ownership for each development.  Maybe it is all one development?  Otherwise 
the form looks okay.  Should we consider adding language regarding duration 
of easement grant, i.e. abandonment after 5 years of non-use.

I have previously discussed this proposed easement with Barbara
and Ann Elizabeth.  In a nutshell, a large developer wishes us to
define a series of mainly undefined easements in Fort Bend 
and Brazoria Counties.  My response to them was to release the
earlier easements and in their place sign a single new easement with
language most favorable to HPL.

Attached is a draft of my proposed easement.  Please review
and make any changes you deem necessary or desirable.

Thanks!!!

Please review the attached document to see if it reflects the matters we 
discussed.  I continued Les's marking and added some red-line changes and 
removed some of Les's language which no longer applied.  It will take more 
than an simple accept all changes to get to a clean copy.  Let me know if you 
need a clean copy so that I can clean up the different colors and methods of 
showing changes.

Bridgette,
 I would stay with the April 1, 1998 agreement.  The 10/01/00 agreement was 
with the canadian el paso entity.

Dan,

I have yet another El Paso question.  We currently have two masters with El 
Paso Merchant Energy, L.P..  As you are probably aware, they have gone 
through several name changes.  We need to know which master to keep 
especially for EOL purposes.  Please advise.

Blanca,
 I believe that you will need to get this form approved by the legal group in 
Columbus before it is signed.  It is my understanding that Pemex has agreed 
to New York law in the past.  I would not approve it unless they agreed to 
New York law and arbitration conducted in English.  If you need a quick 
turnaround, please check with Gary Prescott.

Mike,
 I have checked with the credit group and the suggested changes to the 
confidentiality agreement and to Exhibit "C" and "D" are acceptable.  They 
did point out a typo in the collateral threshold provision.  It should read 
$1,500,000 instead of $1,5000,000.  Please accept the redlined changes to the 
documents and make the above correction and the documents should be ready for 
you to start the execution process.  I am informed that credit will not make 
any changes of the $1,500,000 collateral threshold amount until they have had 
an opportunity to review the Ormet financial information.  Thereafter we can 
work on an amendment if they feel that the financial information warrants 
making a change.

John,
 My first question is how does Cutter determine Harley's volume?  This 
procedure should be added to the document providing for the fixed price.  Has 
Harley set up Cutter as his Seller's Representative so that he can provide us 
notices, volumes, statements and receive Harley payments?  If not, we should 
add that to the Harley agreement and have Cutter sign in the capacity of 
Seller's Representative.  Call me at (713) 853-6895 to discuss in further 
detail.

Dan,
Cutter Oil Company, one of my producers has a meter connected to a Columbia 
Gas Transmission line.  Harley Drilling & Producing is currently putting a 
small volume of gas through this meter.  I pay Cutter for all the flowing 
gas, Cutter then pays Harley for his portion.  Harley is wanting to lock-in a 
fixed price for a firm volume for part of his gas, about 40%-50%.  Cutter has 
in the past locked-in fixed prices for firm volumes and most likey will do so 
in the future.  

Two producers, Cutter Oil & Harley Drilling, wanting to lock-in fixed prices 
for firm volumes for gas flowing through one meter owned by Cutter Oil:
Is there a method to lock-in a portion of Harley's production at a fixed 
price which flows through Cutter's meter?
What contractual language needs be added to the ENFOLIO GAS PURCHASE 
AGREEMENT?
Should an addendum be added to both contracts (Harley and Cutter)?

John

Brodgette.
 Below is the notification that I sent to Bob Bowen on 12/22 to let the 
confirm group know about the transaction agreement which has been signed by 
the customer.  I talked with Craig Breslau this afternoon and he said he 
would sign in behalf of ENA and sent to me asap.  As soon as I get the signed 
agreements, I will sent the confirm to Ellen Wallumrod and the contract to 
Cyndie Balfour-Flangan.  Any questions?

******************************************************************************
**************************************************************
The attached confirm has been signed and is being sent to me by federal 
express.  It did not arrive on Friday so it should be here next week.  I am 
sending you this in case you get a deal ticket for the deal being documented 
by this confirm.  They have  also signed a master to cover this transaction.

Dan,

On 12/29/00 deal # 548711 was entered into Sitara for a contract to be 
attached.  Within this deal there were Special Handling Instructions which 
read: "This is a firm, full requirements sale to Ormet.  Also served to 
Cypress.  Please use the Transaction Agreement prepared by Dan Hyvl already 
executed by Ormet, rather than generate a new confirm."  

I created a GTC Sale Firm for this deal because the agreement mentioned in 
red could not be found in the Global database.  Since the notes mentioned 
that this particular agreement was prepard by you, I was hoping that you 
could clarify if this agreement was circulated our way (meaning if it had 
been sent to the Global Contracts group).  Please Advise.

Barry Tycholiz says that the attached is in final form and should be Raised 
directly with Crestar in the final state and send  to them.  Assuming they 
have no problem with the paper.... we should be done on the monthly firm deal.

Therefore, please issue this negotiated GTC confirm on ENA stationary.  Stacy 
Dickson has been working with Barry on this and I made the last changes which 
had been negotiated.  Call if you have any questions?

me a hard copy of what is sent out.  As written, the document does not need

Dan

I did two gas deals with Oxy Vinyls LP, and repeated a Keep Ready Agreement
with Occidental Chemical.


For the gas deals, we can use the same special purpose GTC that we used
last year (it is unique to Oxy).  Here are the deals:

Document used last year: o:\Legal\DHYVL\DJH\2000\Ltr\2000-39crfm.doc
5,000 MMBtu per day
Battleground Road plant HPL meter # 1485
Inside FERC Houston Ship Channel index minus $0.0075
July 1, 2001 to June 30, 2002

Document used last year: o:\Legal\DHYVL\DJH\2000\Ltr\2000-39acrfm.doc
5,000 MMBtu per day
La Porte plant HPL meter # 1444
Inside FERC Houston Ship Channel index minus $0.0075
July 1, 2001 to June 30, 2002


For the Keep Ready Agreement, everything is the same as last year .....

Document used last year: o:\Legal\DHYVL\DJH\2000\Ltr\2000-47ltr.doc
Term June 1, 2001 to May 31, 2002
One change ... at the end of Section 4, need to delete the last 5 words "OR
THE BILL OF SALE" .... we had come up with this agreement by adapting
another one, and had to manually strike these words because they are not
relevant.


Thanks

Lee

Melissa,
 The maximum rate which HPL is authorized to impose for 311 transportation 
service may be established by either a rate proceeding before the FERC which 
would have to be renewed every 3 years or by using the margin component of a 
city gate rate which has been approved by the state regulatory agency.  In 
HPL's case, HPL has filed with the FERC that its rates will be the margin 
component of the City Gate Rate approved in Docket No. 592 before the Texas 
Railroad Commission.  This allows HPL to use this margin determined as 
provided in the February 8, 1974 contract between Entex and HPL as its 
maximum rate for 311 service.  That is one of the reasons that HPL continues 
to sell certain volumes of gas to Entex under that contract.   You can 
probably contact Steve VanHooser for any documentation that he may have 
concerning the applicable FERC filings if Tom Shelton does not already have 
such information.

 Please reforward your message to me after the 18th so that I can contact 
Aquila concerning where we next proceed concerning HPL's contract.

Dan,

Per our phone conversation, please contact Kathy Dirks with Aquila Energy
Marketing, Corporation regarding the final negotiations of their master
contract.  Per Kathy, this HPL contract has been in negotiations for almost
a year, and they are very close to finalizing.  Her phone number is:
816-527-1560.

Also, at yesterday's meeting regarding the various AEP Entities, you
mentioned that HPL has 311 Transportation with a Grandfathered Rate.  Do
you have any documentation regarding this arrangement, or can you refer me
to the person that could provide this?

Thank you,
Melissa Graves

Dave,
 I will be glad to generate the form of Transaction Agreement; however, I 
have a number of questions.
1.  Relationship of Delivery Point and the use of Interruptible Transport on 
Northwest Pipeline.  Is the transport upstream or downstream of the delivery 
point?  If downstream, why isn't it being contracted for by EWEB.  
2.  What volume is being sold each day.  You use the term DCQ and you also 
talk about a 20% tolerance above or below the estimated quantity.  Normally 
their would be no tolerance with a DCQ transaction.  
3.  Is this envisioned to be a requirements transaction.  Is the price the 
same for volumes in excess of the estimated quantity up to an additional 
20%.  Is no penalty to apply if the actual volumes are 0% to 20% less than 
the estimated quantity?  What if they take more than 20% in excess without 
making any arrangements for incremental gas.  What price is to be used for 
such non scheduled excess volumes? 
 Please call me regarding the foregoing so that I can start to work on the 
transaction agreement.

Dan,

The attached term sheet describes a gas sale we are proposing to the Eugene 
Water and Electric Board.  Please have a look and let me know how you think 
the actual confirm should look.  They have an Enfolio in legal review now.



Thanks,

Mike,
 I have reviewed the requested changes to Exhibit D, I am okay with the 
proposed changes so long as the same changes are made to Exhibit C.  The 
change to Suspension of performance on Appendix 1 is okay.  The collateral 
requirement language has been in the contract for some time so I am concerned 
with bringing up changes at this late date; however, please let me know your 
concern so that we can resolve the issue with the Enron Credit group.

CBS is showing "Survivor 2" this winter. In response, Texas is planning
"Survivor, Texas Style."

The contestants will start in Dallas, travel through Waco, Austin, San
Antonio, down to Houston and Brownsville. They will proceed up to Del Rio,
on to El Paso, then to Midland/Odessa, up to Lubbock and Amarillo. From
there, they proceed to Abilene, and on to Ft. Worth and back to Dallas.

Each will be driving a pink Volvo, with a bumper sticker that reads "I'm
gay, I voted for Al Gore, and I'm here to confiscate your guns."

The first one to make it back to Dallas wins.

 Please get with the Peoples attorney regarding the use of the attached Spot 
GTC to confirm spot transactions of enovate.  The only change that I would

Dan, Bruce Kohrs of Keyspan left me a message this weekend with respect to 
the schedule 'A' that they would like attached.  Assuming that the central 
desk has agreed to the contents of schedule 'A' - and they have been involved 
in drafting this document - I don't see a lot of commercial risk, especially 
given the lack of 'damages' in the event of any defaults to schedule 'A'.  My 
understanding was that we would all work together on a reasonable efforts 
basis to allow gas to flow daily.  They contents of schedule 'A' and its true 
enforceability does not seem to really change the spirit of the agreement.
If they are really adamant about including the schedule 'A', and the central 
desk has reviewed and expressly agreed to its contents, then I would not 
object to including the schedule 'A' as part of the contract.

Janet,
 The amendment is effective as of June 1, 2001.  That is the date on which 
the price changes and the date that the term is extended and the date the 
meter number is added.  I have corrected the contract number on the first 
line for the proper reference to the assigned contract.

Kim,
 The language is awkward but okay.  Question, for weekends, Sat, Sun & Mon 
you probably want to use the Gas Daily Midpoint Price published on Tuesday. 
Otherwise, the Tues price is published wednesday, etc  and the friday price 
is published on Monday.  Or do you want to use and average of the price 
applicable for Friday flow and the price applicable for Monday flow for the 
weekend period.  Just questions to consider.  Please call if you need to 
include any of the above concepts in the offer.

I am working with Roche Vitamins, who are trying to trigger a fixed price for 
the remaining term of their HPL contract, from June01 to Feb02.  They want to 
trigger a fixed price for about 400 MMBtu/d.

Rudwell - we discussed a collateral threshold of $100,000 with this entity, 
based on the limited information that we have received from this privately 
held company.  I assume this is still correct?

Dan - could you send me some draft language that we would insert into the HPL 
contract for the collateral threshold matter???  It is a typical HPL physical 
contract (HPL already has the right to request payment securities for good 
cause) - if you don't already have a copy of the contract, let me know and 
I'll fax it to you.

Roche want to review the language and get it approved internally before doing 
anything.

Thanks

Lee

Dan:

Will Enovate cause us to become "undone" or what?  Today, one of our
Accountants asked me to change the address for Enovate to the Enron,
Houston address.  Just the day before, I had set contracts up in our gas
management system and used the Notices/Correspondence/Invoices section from
the Enovate contract to complete the areas of the contract that would feed
the Accounting module as well as the Contracts module, this being the
Chicago, Illinois information.  So, I politely told the Accountant that the
info in the gas management system was correct as entered.  He (the
Accountant) had spoken with an Accountant from ENA (Doug Nelson at
713/853-0560) and Doug told him that the invoices, etc. should go to
Enovate c/o Enron at 1400 Smith, Room EB3718, Houston, TX 77002.  Do you
have any objection to changing this in the contract?  Please advise, we'd
like to do what would best streamline this process.

Well Dan, hopefully, this will be ironed out one day soon and everything
will run smoothly.  Thanks again for your help.

Regards,
Ellen

Subject:  Enovate, L.L.C. Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement

Dan:

I have a dilemma and I'm almost too embarrassed to ask you to help me
resolve it.  As a matter of policy in this department, we are to stress the
fact that we "need" "financially firm" language in all contracts.  When the
Trader requested a contract with Enovate, he was not clear about his
trading intentions and it was assumed that "financially firm" "needed" to
be in the contract.  It seems that this language is now holding up the
execution process of the Enovate LLC contract.  The Business Unit wants
"financially firm" out and "firm" substituted.

The definition for "firm" that they want in the contract is the standard
definition for "firm" that is in the GISB as follows:

"Firm" shall mean that either party may interrupt its performance without
liability only to the extent that such performance is prevented for reasons
of Force Majeure; provided, however, that during Force Majeure
interruptions, the party invoking Force Majeure may be responsible for any
imbalance charges as set forth in Section 7.2 related to its interruption
after the nomination is made to the Transporter and until the change in
deliveries and/or receipts is confirmed by the Transporter.

I believe the only other place in the contract that "Financially Firm"
appears is on the first page, Article 2. SCOPE OF AGREEMENT:, second line,
would you please change that occurrence of "Financially Firm" to just
"firm"?

Dan, can you help me with this without trashing the whole contract?  On the
first page, we can line through "Financially" and initial, and then just
the definition page on the first page of APPENDIX "1" would have to be
redone to replace "Financially Firm" with just "Firm".

Please let me know if this is able to be done.

Thanks and I'm so sorry,

Ellen Dailey

THE STRONGEST MAN

Ted walks into a bar and shouts out, "Who's the strongest person in here?"

The toughest guy looks at him and says, "I am the strongest person around 
these parts!"

Ted politely asks, "Can you help me push my car to the gas station?"



HE SAID/SHE SAID

He said... I don't know why you wear a bra;  you've got nothing to put in it.
She said...You wear briefs, don't you?

He said....Do you love me just because my father left me a fortune?
She said...Not at all honey, I would love you no matter who left you the 
money.

She said...What do you mean by coming home half drunk?
He said....It's not my fault...I ran out of money.

He said... Since I first laid eyes on you, I've wanted to make love to you in 
the worst way.
She said...Well, you succeeded.

He said... What have you been doing with all the grocery money I gave you?
She said...Turn sideways and look in the mirror.

He said... Let's go out and have some fun tonight.
She said...Okay, but if you get home before I do, leave the hallway light on.

He said... Why don't you tell me when you have an orgasm?
She said...I would, but you're never there.

He said....Shall we try a different position tonight?
She said...That's a good idea, you stand by the ironing board while I sit on 
the sofa and fart."

Brant,
 EnergyOne has responded to the requested changes.  They agree to the 
revision of the MAC language but threw in a money wrench by adding a warm and 
fuzzy triggering event  if a party refused to provide security within 48 
hours of a reasonable request therefore.  No standard is provided as to the 
reason for the request.    They also deleted the original Collateral 
Threshold language which was in their first draft.  Please respond to these

Kim,
 I am reviewing the changes you made to see if they conform to our 
discussion.  I understand from your comments in the email that you disagree 
with the items we discussed and are attempting to go back to the previous 
language which I indicated would be unacceptable.  As such, I have gone back 
over the redlined contract and have only commented on the things that differ 
from our previous agreement.  Please review these and call me in the morning 
if you feel that your client cannot agree to these changes.  
1. The sentence added at the end of 9.1 should be deleted.  Any differences 
between the DCQ and actual is to be handled between the party and its 
transporter.  As I explained, if we schedule a DCQ of 10,000 with you and the 
pipeline and only deliver 9,500 to the pipeline, the pipeline will deliver 
10,000 to you and collect the 500 shortfall from us.  Likewise, if we 
schedule 10,000 with you and the pipeline and you only take 9,500, we still 
sell you the 10,000 and the 500 you didn't take is between you and your 
pipeline transporter.
2. 10.3 and 10.4 need to be deleted.  What we agree to say was as follows:
  "10.3  Buyer represents that no taxes are applicable at the Point of Sale.  
In the event such representation is false, then such misrepresentation shall 
be a Triggering Event allowing Seller to terminate the Contract pursuant to 
Section 17.1."
3. Delete the language "not otherwise due to an event of force majeure" that 
you added in the 2nd and 8th lines of 12.3.  
4. Delete the language added at the end of 12.5 and add language after the 
word "expired" at the end of the second sentence.  "In no event shall any 
event of force majeure extend for a period in excess of 10 days during the 
term of this Contract.  After such 10 day period, the parties shall be 
obligated to resume performance as if the event of force majeure had been 
remedied, and if such party does not resume performance, such nonperformance 
shall be deemed a Triggering Event allowing the other party to terminate 
pursuant to Section 17.1."
5. Delete item (vii) added in 17.2 because it is adequately covered by my 
inserted language in 12.5.
6. The $15,000,000 changed in the 3rd line of 17.4 needs to be changed back 
to $10,000,000.  If the exposure exceeds $10,000,000, that is the reason 
additional security would be required.  This contract contemplates that 
Seller has to provide security for any exposure in excess of $0 whereas the 
Buyer only has to provide security for exposure in excess of $10,000,000.  
Not a very balanced obligation because the Seller is bearing all risk of 
payment after it makes deliveries under the contract.

Dan,

Attached is a redline document which compares our current version to your
11/22 version.  I have summarized our differences below, but I will call you
at about 10:30, subject to your calendar, to discuss the items.

Significant Differences
(1) Taxes
 I deleted Enron reference to Buyer paying taxes AT the Point of Sale.  I
(a) kept our 10.3 but added sentence that "no taxes currently applicable at
POS and (b) added Sec 10.4, which we discussed gives either Party right to
terminate contract if they are assessed an unduly burdensome tax.

(2) Exceptions to Force Majeure
 I added "not otherwise due to an event of force majeure" to the section
addressing failure of reserves/insufficient production from reserves.  This
should clarify that if a force majeure event, ie explosion, occurred at
Seller's supply point, Seller would NOT be obligated to perform (except as
identified in Triggering Events).

(3) Billing
 We cannot accept Enron's requested changes.  It is the industry-standard to
bill Buyer's based on what WAS, not what was TO BE, delivered.  If actuals
are not available, it is acceptable to bill based on DCQ, but once actuals
are available, prior period adjustments would be made to the next invoice.
 To demand a procedure different than the accepted industry-standard is
something that should have been stipulated by Enron at the time the Contract
Terms were established in 8/00.
 Given the tremendous progress we've made to this point, I am hopeful that
Enron will accept the industry-standard (billing on actuals) for this
contract.  We can address this issue next month when we begin preparation of
the future Enron/WPS Master Contract.

(4) Credit Terms
 Based on our 12/6 discussion, I (a) removed Enron's Material Adverse Change
definition, (b) removed Enron's Sec 17.2(vii) regarded MAC and (c) added
back our Section 16.10 Credit Terms, whereby either Party has the right to
demand credit support if in their sole and non-discriminatory assessment the
other Party might not be able to meet its financial obligations pursuant to
the Contract.  Failure to provide credit support is considered a Triggering
Event per Enron's language.

(5) Effect of Force Majeure
 Based on our 12/6 discussion, I (a) removed language referring to
consequences of extended force majeure but revised to refer to Sec 17.2
Triggering Events and (b) added Sec 17.2 (vii) to make extended FM a
Triggering Event.

(6) Collateral Requirement
 THIS IS A NEW REQUEST.  I would like to change the Termination Payment
threshold from $10MM to $15MM.  In light of soaring gas prices, WPS could
find itself owing more than $10MM strictly based on standard,
full-performance Accounts Receivable (for example:  15,000 (MDQ) * $10 (gas
price) * 60 (days) = $9MM.)  I believe your provision was intended to keep
Buyer's from having multi-month A/R and/or non-performance charges.
 Since I believe we agree WPS is fully capable of meeting its financial
obligations, we should not set a threshold below potential standard,
full-performance A/R.


MINOR ITEMS
(1) Throughout document, I made changes to your comments to make consistent
with form of entire document, including changing Daily Contract Quantity to
DCQ and putting days in words (ie 20 days became twenty (20) days).
(2) Deleted Nominated Quantity definition as this term was replaced by DCQ.
(3) Other changes that we agreed to yesterday.

Dan, please let me know the earliest, convenient time for you to discuss
these items with me on the phone.

Thanks for your help.

Kim

Russell,
 I have no problems with their few editing word changes other than we need to 
have a separate guaranty for the HPL contract.  However, until they sign the 
master, their is no need to do anything because this is the identical 
guaranty that you currently have from coastal.

I have forwarded you the Guaranty from Coastal.  This Guaranty is a redline 
version that Coastal has provided comments on.  At this time they do not want 
to negotiate the Master Agreement until they fully understand how their 
current positions will fit into El Paso's trading book with the upcoming 
merger.  Please review the attached Guaranty and provide your comments.  The 
contact ar Coastal is Dai Nguyen, her phone number is 713-418-4229.

Thank you,

Russell

 The subject contact that you faxed to me appears to be their standard 
interruptible 311 contract.  t is a month to month interruptible contract.  I 
see no reason why it should not be signed.   Please call me if you need 
anything further.  I will be in the AEP Houston Metro building office 
starting on Monday.

Gary,  
 Please review the foregoing to see if it is your understanding of the deal.  
We have no documentation from Shell Chemical Company to evidence their 
assignment of the contract to Shell Chemical L.P., so I have left the 
Transaction under Shell Chemical Company.  I assume that you are having Steve 
Van Hooser work on the Lease Amendment.  Call me if you need anything further.

DAve,
 Once you decide which way you would like to go, We will issue a new 
Confirmation Letter which will cancel the two previous confirmation letters 
effective as of February 1, 2001.  Because the term extends some 17 months, 
we will require them to sign the confirmation letter with attached GTC.  Let 
me know, and I will generate.

I have a proposed restructuring transaction with City of Mesa, Arizona.  It 
works like this:

1) Half their volume is currently priced at 3.74 (fixed, physical deal with 
us)
2) That deal runs through July 01
3) I want to reprice that deal at a higher price and use that equity to 
finance a discount to index for an extra six months.
4) They will do one of two transactions (shown below) one extends half the 
volume one extends the full volume.


       

I need help with a couple of things:

1) Since they canceled their Enfolio Agmt. can I get a contract from legal 
that will allow us to transact without it.
2) How do we get this deal in Mike's book and the risk system

Thanks,

Cathy,
 At the request of Mitch Dutton, I have reviewed the form of 311 and 
intrastate gas transportation agreements provided to AEP by Duke Energy 
Guadalupe Pipeline, Inc. and by EPGT Texas Pipeline, L.P.   As we discussed 
this morning, these agreements appear to be the standard form of agreement 
utilized by these counterparties.  Although I have no authority to approve 
them for execution by AEP, had they been provided to me for execution by HPL, 
I would approve them for execution.  
 Please note the Balancing and Penalties provision of the agreements for the 
charges which these parties could impose should receipts and deliveries get 
out of balance.  If time permitted I would suggest that these charges be 
negotiated to something closer to the actual costs incurred by the 
transporter.   However, it has been my experience that these parties are 
reluctant to change the standard form for standard transportation services.   
 No contract documents have been provided concerning the TXU Lone Star 
Pipeline.  The only documents faxed were two transportation services request 
forms.

Could you change paragraph iii at the end of Representations and Warranties
to read:

"(iii) its obligations to make payments hereunder are unsubordinated
obligations and such payments are operating and maintenance costs which
enjoy first priority of payment under the ordinances of the City of San
Antonio which govern payments by Customer."

There are no indentures to which CPS is a party.  Thanks ...

Change the clause after "first priority payment" in (iii) to "under the

Mr. Wood,

As requested, Enfolio shortened and simplified the section on
Representations and Warranties.  The new language is highlighted on page 2
of the Appendix and states the following:

"Further and with respect to Customer only, Customer represents and warrants
to Company continuing throughout the term of this Agreement as follows: (i)
all acts necessary to the valid execution and performance of this Agreement
have been duly adopted, (ii) with respect to the contractual obligations
hereunder and performance thereof, it is not entitled to claim immunity on
the grounds of sovereignty or similar grounds with respect to itself or its
revenues, (iii) its obligations to make payments hereunder are
unsubordinated obligations and such payments are operating and maintenance
costs which enjoy first priority of payment at all times under any and all
indentures to which it is a party."

Do you feel that this language is acceptable?  Thank you for your advice.

If you could redraft the "representations and warranties" provision to be
simpler and clearer, I think that we could agree to it.  The other items
look fine.

My reading is that Enron seeks a continuing representation that (i) all
transactions have the appropriate approval, waiving any defense of lack of
authority, (ii) there is no sovereign immunity (something is left out of
thelanguage) defense to any transaction, (iii) payment for the gas will be
first in the flow of funds, and (iv) the obligations are not subject to
debt
restrictions or other public funds restrictions of the Texas Constitution,
statutes or CPS constituency documents.  I think we can legally make these
representations and warranties, but the language needs some work.  You
should ask them to redraft this provision so it is simpler and clearer.

Mr. Wood,

This is a spot gas contract with Enron that you reviewed on August 8th for
Mary Pelayo and Danny McWhirter.  Enron has added a paragraph under
"Representations and Warranties" that I would like you to review.  I am not
sure exactly what it means.  Thank you.

Kathy,

This spot gas contract was reviewed by Jon Wood a few months ago.  The
following was added under "Representations and Warranties" by Enron.  I
have
highlighted the text in the attachment so you can see where it was
incorporated (page 2 of Appendix 1).

"Further and with respect to Customer only, Customer represents and
warrants
to Company continuing throughout the term of this Agreement as follows:
(i)
all acts necessary to the valid execution and performance of this Agreement
have been duly adopted, (ii) with respect to the contractual obligations
hereunder and performance thereof, it is not entitled to itself or its
revenues or assets from (a) suit, (b) jurisdiction of court, (c) relief by
way of injunction, order for specific performance or recovery of property,
(d) attachment of assets or (e) execution or enforcement of any judgment,
(iii) its obligations to make payments hereunder are unsubordinated
obligations and such payments are operating and maintenance costs which
enjoy first priority of payment at all times under any and all indentures
to
which it is a party, its constitutional and governing documents and
applicable law, and (iv) its obligations to make payments hereunder do not
constitute any kind of indebtedness of Customer or create any kind of lien
on, or security interest in, any property or revenues of Customer which, in
either case , is proscribed by any provision of its constitutional and
governing documents, any order to judgment of any court or other agency of
government applicable to it or its assets, or any contractual restriction
binding on or affecting it or any of its assets."

Do you think this is acceptable, or do you think I should show this added
paragraph to Jon Wood?

Don't know what you are talking about.  They gave Sylvia their form with 
their view of how the world should revolve around their wishes in October 
2000.  She sent it up here is late January for Legal's initial review.  I 
understand it mimics the Utilicorp agreement.  If you have some incite that 
would lead you to believe that they would sign our Master, please send me a 
credit worksheet so that I can prepare a Master Firm Purchase/Sale 
Agreement.  Also please give me a contact so that we can forward the new 
contract to that person for execution.

A Sixth Grade student has a penis so large, his parents warn him not to have 
anything to do with girls.  They caution him he could easily kill someone.  
Through the grapevine, his teacher learns about his unusual size, keeps him 
after school and suggests they have sex.  He refuses expressing concern he 
might kill her.   She laughs and scoffs at the idea and says she will elect 
to be on top, in complete control, and nothing bad can happen.  He 
reluctantly agrees but the teacher experiences such wonderful sensations, she 
faints from pure joy.  Thinking he's killed her, the student runs from the 
class room sobbing and crying, "Oh my God!... I killed her!  I killed her!"  
All at once he stops dead in his tracks, and a look of dawning comprehension 
appears on his face as he says,... "Wait just a minute!  I didn't kill her.  
She committed suicide!"

So you only email me when you want something.  No, I do not know what I am 
going to do.  They tell me Time Warner Cable Modem service is not available 
in my area, however, Time Warner tells me it is.  They tell me that I can 
sign up for DSL and expense it on my expense account until they allow it 
sometimes next month.  I guess I need to talk with them some more about which 
is better.  People tell me the cable modem service is actually faster than 
the response we currently have in the office.  Let me know what you decide to 
do, so that I can ponder the reasons for your choice.

Dan, I will not be sending this document to Crestar.  Raise this confirm 
directly with Crestar in the final state and send  to them.  Assuming they 
have no problem with the paper.... we should be done on the monthly firm deal.

Can you send down the paper on the AOS daily balancing agreement. This is a 
seperate agreement that is secondary to the firm deal.

Thanks.

Linda,
 It is my understanding that all of the existing contracts for business done 
in Texas that somehow touches the HPL system will go with HPL or its 
marketing entity.  This will mean that ENA will have to negotiate a contract 
with each of those parties whose exiasting contracts will go with the HPL 
sale to AEP.

Linda, Elizabeth Hernandez thought I should contact you about ENA Texas 
contracts.  Are the contracts we have in place as ENA sufficient to handle 
deals that once was done as HPL but will be done as ENA going forward?  We 
are wanting to make sure that we do not have to renegotiate contracts with 
our counterparties or be caught off guard by a contract not being in place 
once the AEP transaction is complete.  Basically, do we have the contracts in 
place to hit the floor running after the HPL sale to AEP goes through?

Pontchartrain Natural Gas System and Calcasieu Gas Gathering System.  Please 
review them and let me know if there are any comments or questions.  The one

Jeff,
 I had informed them that I was out Monday, however they scheduled the 
meeting anyway.  I forwarded our standard enfolio to Teresa for this deal.  
She wants to delete the $0.15 from 3.2 and 3.4.  I suggested that we delete 
it in the transaction documents, but I think she will insist that it be taken 
out of the master.  I had requested that they invite Scott Neal to the 
meeting to discuss what they viewed as their obligation if the producer did 
not deliver the production payment volumes.  They had suggested that they use 
the enfolio default mechanism to calculated the $ damages, but in lieu of 
paying the $s, they would deliver a volume equal to such $s in a future 
undefined period.  Later they agreed that because of the financial hedge that 
was being put into place, they could pay such $ damages  at the time of 
default.  
 If they need someone from gas trading, can you attend Monday.  I am going to 
leave Teresa a message requesting that she try to get Scott Neal or his 
representative to attend and to let you know if your attendance was needed.

Dan,

Sorry it's taken me so long to get back to you on this -- I got
sent out to the field for most of the day.

Can you send me your fax number so I can get you the
legal description.

Also, I don't think a duration time is necessary.  It would
be in HPL's best interest to have this easement in
perpetuity.  HPL will have the right to abandon the line
in place if it so chooses.

Thank you for your excellent and fast help!!!

Robert,
 Where is the description of our right-of-way which we want to put in this 
document before we send it out.  I think we need to change the first 
paragraph, but I need to see the description to verify.  Is it intended that 
we are dealing with only one owner, or is this developer using a different 
ownership for each development.  Maybe it is all one development?  Otherwise 
the form looks okay.  Should we consider adding language regarding duration 
of easement grant, i.e. abandonment after 5 years of non-use.

Dan,

I have previously discussed this proposed easement with Barbara
and Ann Elizabeth.  In a nutshell, a large developer wishes us to
define a series of mainly undefined easements in Fort Bend 
and Brazoria Counties.  My response to them was to release the
earlier easements and in their place sign a single new easement with
language most favorable to HPL.

Attached is a draft of my proposed easement.  Please review
and make any changes you deem necessary or desirable.

Thanks!!!

 I confirmed with the Transportation Desk that the designation "TETCO M3" is 
a zone designation that includes all points within the zone.  Therefore the 
language "and all downstream delivery on the M3" is not needed.  Please call

Hi Stacy -

Dick Jenkins has expressed concern with the description of an EnronOnline 
location and wants an immediate revision.  The location description needing 
revision is the TETCO M3.  It is currently defined as follows:

The transaction is for delivery at Texas Eastern Transmission Corp. - Zone M3.


Dick wants to ensure that the delivery shall also include any location on the 
M3.  Therefore, please advise as follows:

The transaction is for delivery at Texas Eastern Transmission Corp. - Zone 
M3, and all downstream delivery on the M3.  

We need to get a ticker item posted on the website as soon as possible.  

Thanks -

Rob

Kim,
 I have reviewed your term sheet and have the following questions.  
1.  Under Term, you have included the phrase "with annual redetermination" 
however I find no redetermination language in the Price  section.  I would 
suggest that the phrase be deleted.
2.  Under Quantity, you indicate there expected volumes, however, we need to 
put some cap on the maximum, With a 5 year term, we should offer some maximum 
such as 200% of the expected volumes.  Any thoughts relating to a cap?
3.  Under Price you indicate that the price could be changed to a Fixed 
Price, I assume that you do not intend to include the Transwestern 
transportation charges as a part of the Fixed Price.  Is this correct?  and 
if so, does the Fixed Price language need to be qualified?  
 Otherwise, the term sheet appears okay.

Thank you for your prompt response.  We cannot issue a purchase order until

Unfortunately, we don't have a purchase order issued yet so I can't give
you
a number.  I know that would make it easier for you guys, but I don't think
we can issue one until right before the first gas purchase.  First, a
purchase requisition needs to be issued.  Then, a purchase order will be
released following approvals by the various individuals authorized to sign
off on them.

Brian Riley contacted me regarding the subject company and the fact that HPL 
had overpaid them to the tune of $328,508.61and would it be appropriate for 
HPL to withhold that amount from the next payment being sent to Upstream.  
The documentation that has been provided to me shows that this amount relates 
to overpayments made in 1997 and early 1998.  The 1997 payments were made 
pursuant to a spot contract and that they had confirmed a nomination of 500 a 
day however, Killam Oil Company, the operator of the wells, has made a 
reallocation of volumes from these wells from the parties that Upstream 
represents to Enron Oil and Gas Company.  The information provided does not 
indicate when Killam made the reallocation.  Based on the reallocation, HPL 
or its predecessor has paid Upstream for 97,384 MMBtu that has now been 
allocated to EOG.  I am told that Upstream has not denied its responsibility 
for repaying the money, only that it needed time to collect the money from 
the parties that it represents.  Upstream's attorney, Ty Kelly written 
correspondence indicates that the Spot contract was not complete because it 
did not provide a document evidencing the delivery point and volumes.  That 
contract provides that the remittance advice serves as the confirmation 
evidencing the transaction.  He also stated that the volumes should have been 
sold to HPL under the Big Cowboy agreement which they did not have a copy 
of.  Brian Riley has indicated that the purchase price was the same under the 
Big Cowboy and the Spot contract.  Kelly also indicated that since HPL's 
agreements routinely provide for arbitration, the issue should be resolved 
through arbitration.

Based on my review of the information available, HPL should withhold the sum 
of $328,508.61 from the next payment to be made to Upstream and hold such sum 
in suspense until the issue is resolved.  HPL needs to be aware that in the 
event it is not able to prevail on its claim for such sum, it will need to 
remit such amount together with interest to Upstream.

The Guarantor is Centrica plc; the entities that the Guarantor is 
guaranteeing are Accord Energy Limited and Direct Energy Marketing Limited.  
Enron Capital & Trade Resources Limited; Enron Capital & Trade Resources 
International Corp.; Enron Canada Corp.; and Enron North America Corp. and 
the Enron entities named whose transactions with the named Guarantor's 
subsidiaries are being guaranteed up to 75 million pounds sterling.  The 
Guarantor can terminate  on five days notice.
 Do we know what type of business ENA intends to do with these entities for 
which this Guaranty has been drafted.  If so, let me know so that I can 
forward to that group for them to approve and obtain ENA's signature.

Grant,  
 Sorry for the delay in responding to your additional inquiries.
 7. Re 4.2(iv)(b) - I would propose the clause to read:  "(b) file a petition 
or otherwise commence, authorize or acquiesce in the commencement of a 
proceeding or cause under any bankruptcy or similar law of the protection of 
creditors, or have such petition filed against it and such proceeding remains 
undismissed for 30 Days, provided if a petition is filed against the Affected 
Party and the  Affected Party is actively pursuing all steps to have such 
proceeding dismissed and provides the other party with reasonable 
documentation supporting its actions to cause such proceeding to be 
dismissed, then such Affected Party shall have an additional 30 Days to 
effectuate such dismissal,"
 8.  Re 4.2 (v) and 4.2 (vi) -  "20 or more Gas Days" is acceptable.
 13. I will change the definition of "Act" as you suggest.
 21. I propose that language be added whereby the parties shall first attempt 
to settle the matters to be resolved by the use of binding Arbitration by 
mon-binding mediation and if that does not resolve the issue to the 
satisfaction of the parties, such matter shall thereafter be resolved by the 
use of binding Arbitration.  Is this an acceptable resolution?
 22. We cannot agree to any list of parties who are authorized to enter into 
transactions under the contract.  Our position is that whoever answers the 
trading phone during trading hours is authorized to bind the company.  
However, we will provide the City with an initial contact list of the people 
on the trading floor whom the city can contact as of the date the contract is 
signed; however, the persons who are authorized to enter into a transaction 
with the city will not be limited to the initial contact list.  Of course, 
the city could always attempt to contact someone on the initial contact 
list.  Will an initial contact list be acceptable?  

Please let me have your thoughts concerning the above.  
          Dan.

Dan, please accept my apologies for replying so late.  I was out of town
again, and am back at trying to complete 5+ days of work within 3 days.

Thanks for accepting a lot of our requests.  Let me follow up with a couple
of additional inquiries.

7.  Re 4.2(iv), please suggest language as you've indicated in sentence 2.
Anything along the lines you've proposed likely will be agreeable.

8.  Re 4.2(v) and (vi).  How about 20 days?

13. Definition of "Act."  I suggest you refer to Article 11, sections 5 and
9 of the California Constitution, to be more specific.  Section 3 is not
regularly cited as the line of authority to the best of my knowledge, though
I can see how the language could lead  one to cite it.

21.  In California, the concept of binding mediation is not recognized, if I
have understood our outside counsel at prior mediations in which I've
participated.  Mediation is non-binding.  As a practical matter, it can cost
almost as much in terms of time, money and effort to proceed to mediation,
but the "rules of engagement" are not as tight as are found in arbitration.
We avoid the rigid procedures.  I believe Enron should consider this
approach at times.  Having gone through a couple, I would not recommend to
my client that we would proceed any further once the mediator makes a
proposal that's acceptable to the parties.  The cost of arbitration is not
worth it.  That's why we in California tend to prefer mediation to
arbitration.

22.  I have to insist on behalf of my client that we assemble some list.
Surely, Enron can submit a list of people that will be initially approved to
engage in authorized transactions.  We can do the same.  We've had an
unfavorable experience with another Texas-based
energy company regarding the scope of its representative's authority.  We
don't want to litigate the issue of due authority.  That list would help
It's not a matter of the city claiming the authority to back out of the
contract, because someone arguably didn't have the authority.  There are a
ton of cases which would make it extremely difficult to make that claim.

Thanks.  Grant.

  (See attached file: 2001-002ctr.doc)

  Grant,
       I have reviewed your requested changes and have made
the changes which
  do not require explanation or clarification.  Those changes
are reflected
  in the above document.  Let me go over your list of items:
       1.   I have deleted the word "DRAFT".
       2.   I have left a blank for the date within the month
of March 2001
  when the contract would be executed by the City.
       3.   I have changed the word "may" to "shall".
       4.   Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity does not fit
in a
  Deficiency Default, it is just the maximum quantity that can
be handled by
  a party at a particular point.  I do not think their is an
omission.
       5.   I have added the word "reasonable".
       6.   The procedue for how the Termination Payment is
determined is
  provided, if the City disagrees with the method and values
provided in the
  statement and is unable to convince the Company to revise,
the statement,
  then the issue is to be resolved in arbitration.  At the
point that a
  Termination Payment calculation is necessary, a long drawn
out period
  should not be necessary to attain closure.
       7.   We need to limit the duration to 30 days,  neither
party should
  be required to wait 60 days before it could accelerate the
other party's
  obligations under the Contract.  We might be able to add
language to extend
  the period if we had some documentation stating the steps
that a party was
  pursuing to cause the proceeding to be dismissed and the
other party was
  otherwise kept whole from a credit exposure.
       8.   I have kept the 30 days because 5 days is too
short a period.
  During a holiday period, one scheduling error could cover
the entire
  period.  Article 3 has language which provides a remedy for
a party if a
  scheduling default extends for more than 5 days during any
month.
       9.   The reason is because Enron Corp. is the rated
entity and no
  separate rating applies to ENA.
       10.  I have changed "a" to "the"
       11.  I have eliminated the  60 day limitation on the
duration of an
  event of Force Majeure.
       12.  This merely addressed the possibility of a
imbalance amount being
  due when a pipeline aggregates imbalances using multiple
points, and the
  language would allocated the payment based on the amount of
the imbalance
  that a particular party may have caused.  I think the
language is clear as
  written.
       13.  The definition of Act was one of the items that I
had requested
  that you review and complete as necessary so that all
appropriate statutes
  were referenced.  I am still waiting for your language.  I
started filling
  it in using language that had been provided by the City.
       14.  I added the word "reasonable".
       15.  I have made the requested change relating to
GAAAP.
       16.  This is a late payment provision and as such a
believe that the
  provision should be more than a party's rating, as such I
have kept the 2%
  over prime language.
       17.  These amounts were determined by the credit group
and any change
  needs to be discussed with that group.  BBB-  is considered
investment
  grade and I understand that Enron Corp.'s rating is BBB.
ENA is not a
  rated entity and that is why the language relates to Enron
Corp.'s rating.
       18.  The elimination of the opinion of counsel did not
change the
  requirements relating to the representations that we expect
the City to
  have made.  If the City cannot make these representations,
then we need to
  know that before we execute the Contract.
       19.  I have added the word "reasonable".
       20.  The party that has the Transport Agreement with
the Transporter
  should have the legal right to obtain the information based
on its
  contract.
       21.  It is our position that any dispute be arbitrated.
We can agree
  to meditation if we can make the outcome binding on the
parties.  I am
  willing to discuss any changed language that you might care
to offer.
       22.  We have found that personnel of both our Company
and that of our
  Customers change so rapidily that the list is not workable
and merely
  allows a party to back out of transactions it does not like
on the basis
  that the person who agreed to such transaction was not on
the list.
  Therefore , we object to any listing of approved parties who
can transact.
  We believe that each party should be responsible for the
actions of its
  employees and should stand behind any transactions that
those parties may
  enter into pursuant to the terms and provisions of the
Contract.

       I will be out of the office on Friday, but will be in
all next week if
  you care to discuss any of these matters.

Subject:     RE: Enfolio Master Firm

Purchase/Sale Agreement






   <<0071988 RESO Enron.doc>>

  Dan:

  First, I've attached the proposed resolution which
authorizes the City
  Manager to execute the Enfolio agreement.

  More importantly, I need to inform you that our senior
management has
  reviewed the referenced contract; I have been asked to
present additional
  changes to the agreement for Enron's consideration and to
raise questions
  about certain of its terms and conditions.

  Let me start from page 1, top to bottom, and proceed to the
end of the
  exhibits.

  1.  There is the word "DRAFT" above the title of the Enfolio
agreement
  which
  should be deleted.

  2.  The introductory paragraph, line 5, should not contain
the words "1st
  of
  January, 2001."  It should be left blank, until the parties
have signed the
  contract.  Otherwise, the City will be in breach as of the
date it signs
  the
  contract, because Article 2, section 2.1 requires the City
to proffer the
  to-be-approved-by-Council resolution as of 1/1/01.

  3.  Article 2, Section 2.4, line 2.  The City (Customer)
wants Enron
  (Company) to confirm every recorded telephonic Transaction,
as defined.
  Therefore, the City requests the word "may" should be
changed to "shall."

  4.  Article 3, Sections 3.1 and 3.2, first sentence:
Buyer's Requested
  Quantity refers to the DCQ or MaxDQ.  Seller's failure to
Schedule the
  Buyer's Requested Quantity shall constitute a Seller's
Deficiency Default.
  How does a Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity fit into a
Seller's
  Deficiency Default if the Buyer's Requested Quantity does
not include a
  Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity?  What is the reason
for the
  omission?

  5.  Article 4, Section 4.1, lines 15 and 23:  Line 23 refers
to "reasonable
  attorneys' fees" yet line 15 refers to "attorneys' fees."
To be internally
  consistent, line 15 should say "reasonable attorneys' fees."

  6.  Section 4.1, right hand column, lines 3-4.  A statement
showing the
  determination of the Termination Payment will be prepared.
It's unclear
  whether the City is entitled to review and challenge the
determination
  before a dispute is referred to arbitration.  The City
should be entitled
  to
  receive a copy of the determination and to question it
before it is
  obligated to pay the Termination Payment.  Please clarify,
or permit the
  City to exercise these rights.

  7.  Section 4.2(iv) specifies that a Triggering Event will
exist if a
  bankruptcy petition is undismissed within 30 days.  Is this
(under
  bankruptcy laws) the minimum period of time within which one
may seek
  dismissal of a bankruptcy petition?  Please refer to the 11
USC section
  that
  backs up this provision, or change to 60 days.

  8.  Section 4.2(v) and (vi):  Please change "30 days" to "5
days."  The
  City
  is concerned with the number of days that Enron may be
permitted to fail to
  Schedule before a Triggering Event is triggered by Enron.

  9.  Section 4.2(ix):  this language discusses a default by
Enron Corp.
  (ENA's parent?), but no mention is made of ENA's default in
this regard?
  Please explain.

  10. Section 4.5, line 4:  Is "a Company" supposed to refer
to "the Company"
  ?

  11. Article 5.  The City is uncomfortable with the force
majeure provision
  as drafted.  It states that the parties must perform even if
a FM event
  (earthquake) would prevent either or both parties from
performing with the
  60-day period stated therein.  There is no such limitation
under California
  law in the absence of a contract provision to the contrary.

  12.  Article 7, Section 7.2:  Could Enron translate the last
sentence?  We
  don't understand it.

  13.  Appendix "1":  Act:  Please explain why Section 3 is
referred to?

  14.  Appendix "1", Claims, line 4:  Please add "reasonable"
before
  "attorneys' fees.

   15.  Appendix "1", GAAP:  This should read: "GAAP means
generally accepted
  accounting principles, consistently applied, with respect to
Company, and
  governmental generally accepted accounting principles,
consistently
  applied,
  with respect to Customer."

  16.  Appendix "1", Interest Rate:  Please delete "two
percent over".  The
  City has a AAA bond rating, therefore, the  City believes
the 2% over prime
  should not apply to it.

  17.  Appendix "1", Material Adverse Change:  What does Enron
believe the
  City's Net Worth to be?  The $400 million threshold is
mentioned.  Also,
  what is ENA's bond rating?  Is "BBB-" an investment grade
rating?

  18.  Representations and Warranties:  Because we have agreed
that the
  opinion of counsel will not be required, the reps and
warranties are being
  deleted.  But the "Representations and Warranties" is
nevertheless included
  in the agreement.  Item (i) should be deleted, because the
City has not
  undertaken a court search as is our custom and practice
whenever we issue
  an
  opinion.  We would like to delete "and (vii) it is not ...
Party."

  19.  Operational Flow Orders, line 8:  Please add
"reasonable" before
  "attorneys' fees."

  20.  Financial Matters, line 8:  What is meant by "to the
extent it has a
  legal right of access thereto and/or ...etc."

  21.  Arbitration, Disputes to be Arbitrated.  We do not as a
matter of
  legal
  policy agree to arbitration, but we will mediate disputes.
Is Enron
  amenable to mediation?  This process is less formal and less
costly in my
  opinion.

  22.  Authority for Transactions.  Staff would like the
Agreement to include
  a list of employees for Company and Customer who are
authorized to trade on
  behalf of their employers.  Could a statement be added to
this section to
  this effect?  Then, we could attach the list(s) as an
Exhibit C.

  Thank you so much for considering these issues.  There are
others which I
  hope to receive from staff next week and which I will
forward to you for
  response.

  Look forward to hearing from you soon.  I will be out of
town after today
  until Wednesday, March 7.

  Sincerely,

  Grant Kolling

            Grant,
                 I have incorporated the language you provided
to me in
  the attached
            document.  I have been informed by the Corporate
Secretary's
  office that
            they will issue a Certificate of Incumbency
showing that the
  person
            executing the contract for ENA is authorized to
execute
  contracts for ENA.
            No other party signs as to form or terms, however,
the
  officer executing
            for ENA will require that the deal person and I
initial on
  the line next to
            his signature.  I have reviewed the proposed draft
  resolution.  ENA will
            accept the enacted resolution and will not require
that the
  City Attorney
            issue an opinion.  If the attached contract is
acceptable,
  please print off
            2 originals, have them approved, signed and
forward to me
  for ENA's
            approval and signature.  Once the contract is
fully
  executed, I will return
            one fully executed original to you for the City's
file.

Mr. Hyvl,

There was one change that you did not make that I requested.  It was
difficult to tell since only a single word was bolded.

APPENDIX "1"  FINANCIAL MATTERS  BILLING, INVOICE DATE, CHARGES AND PAYMENT

"Buyer shall remit any amounts due on the 25th day of the Month in which
Seller's statement was received.  If the due date for any payment to be made
under this Agreement is not a Customer's Business Day, the due date for such
payment shall be the following Customer's Business Day."

There are very few instances where our Business Day would be different from
your business day.  However, as an example, the day after Thanksgiving is a
CPS holiday.  This year, we had a gas payment due on that date which we sent
on the following Monday.  This is probably the only holiday CPS has that
your company may not have.

Unfortunately, we don't have a purchase order issued yet so I can't give
you
a number.  I know that would make it easier for you guys, but I don't think
we can issue one until right before the first gas purchase.  First, a
purchase requisition needs to be issued.  Then, a purchase order will be
released following approvals by the various individuals authorized to sign
off on them.

Thanksgiving is set at Mom's for Thursday, November 23, 2000 at noon.  Hope 
to see each of you there.   Try to cheer Mom up.  She seems to be a little 
depressed.  Maybe its the fact that her job has been cut back and she feels 
that she has no outside activities to occupy her mind.

Russell,
 The below two documents are the credit worksheet and the contract 
relationship documents which you provided.  The credit worksheet states that 
the guaranty should cover ENA, EPMI, ECC and Clinton Energy Management 
Services, Inc. and additionally should cover the master energy agreement with 
EPMI.  Do we have a date of execution or effective date for such master 
energy agreement.  The contract relationship document merely states that the 
guaranty should cover the new master firm purchase sale agreement  that ENA 
is negotiating with Engage and an master energy agreement between EPMI and 
____.  No agreements of any type are specified for ECC or Clinton Energy 
Management Services, Inc.  Also, are any of the Master Swap agreements that 
ENA has with Engage to be covered by the requested guaranty?  I believe that 
we need to get together at your convenience and determine exactly which 
contracts Enron Corp. is to cover with the guaranty agreement being offered 
as a part of the security for the Master Firm Purchase Sale Agreement.  
Please let me know when you will be available to discuss.

I provided all the information that you are asking for on the original credit 
worksheet I e-mailed to ENA legal on August 29.  You will notice in the 
comments section the Enron entities I wanted covered in the guaranty along 
with the Contracts that needed to be reference.  If you need a copy the 
specific contracts that need to be covered they can be obtained through the 
documentation group, or through 'Live Link' on our computers.  Please make 
note of the name change that has now occurred with respect to Engage.

 We need closure on the guaranty issue.  All of the guaranty formats you

for each of the other enron entities you want covered by the Gas physical

L.P.you want guarantied by Enron, I will take the lead to draft the guaranty

Dan,

This is in response to my continued efforts with legal to make note of my 
intended priority of executing a Master Firm with Coastal Energy (formerly 
Engage US).  As previous e-mails below indicate and phone calls with the ENA 
legal group and Coastal, the draft has yet to be sent out.  I have confirmed 
with Coastal today, they have STILL not received the draft although are 
expecting this from ENA.  We have outstanding exposure with this entity and 
is important from a credit, legal, and contractual standpoint that an 
agreement is executed.  I understand that in the past they have been 
unwilling to negotiate a Master although I want one put in place. Please do 
what you need to, to get this draft sent to the counterparty.

Regards,
Russell

in which they reference specific contracts as well as entities not related to 
the  contract, i.e. Sempra, Duke, Aquila, Dynegy,......  

Dan,
I see the execution of this contract as a priority considering the trading 
volumes on Enron Online and current market conditions.  I know in the past, 
we have been unable to negotiate a Master Firm with Engage US, although their 
legal group is fully aware of our request to negotiate a contract. Please 
send the draft out to the contact listed on the credit worksheet and 
priortize the negotiation of this contract.

Regards,
Russell

Michael,

 I have reviewed the attached agreement and offer the following comments.

1. Change the reference to Consenting Party to read as follows:
  
Enron North America Corp. is a Delaware corporation having an office located 
at 1400 Smith St., Houston, Texas (hereinafter referred to as "Consenting 
Party")

2. Paragraph No. 5.  Please delete the last two sentences, this had some 
applicability when the agreement was intended to be a partial assignment, 
however, once the assignment is completed, Assignee will be responsible for 
making its own nominations each day.

3. Paragraph No. 8.  Please limit this paragraph solely to Assignor and 
Assignee, otherwise change the reference to the State of Texas.

 Please call if you have any questions.

       Dan Hyvl

So you only email me when you want something.  No, I do not know what I am 
going to do.  They tell me Time Warner Cable Modem service is not available 
in my area, however, Time Warner tells me it is.  They tell me that I can 
sign up for DSL and expense it on my expense account until they allow it 
sometimes next month.  I guess I need to talk with them some more about which 
is better.  People tell me the cable modem service is actually faster than 
the response we currently have in the office.  Let me know what you decide to 
do, so that I can ponder the reasons for your choice.

 I talked with Ellen Dailey, Reliant's attorney, yesterday.  Subject to the 
credit departments approval of the credit items that Reliant copied from the 
ENA/Reliant proposed contract, the other items in the contract requested by 
Reliant have been discussed and resolved.  As soon as I hear from Russell 
Diamond, I will finalize the contract and sent to you and to Reliant.

Karen,
 I have reviewed the redline document that Debra Perlingiere spent time on.  
It is not a finished product and needs a great deal of work.  I will continue 
to work on it.  Apparently the redlining must have been confusing and I need 
to start fresh.  I will try to get the redline to you as soon as possible.  
If we need to put something in place before the contract is executed, maybe 
we can document the transaction under the existing GISB contract currently in 
place between the parties and agree that the transaction will be rolled up 
under the new master once the Master is executed.

Lisa,
 Barbara Gray requested that I fax a copy of the subject guaranty to you for 
your review.  This guaranty was not included in the initial list of 
guarantees provided by the credit group.  Apparently one of the analyst had 
the file pulled and on his desk for review.  
 Barbara has also asked that you prepare a Substitution and Release Agreement 
for this guaranty.

Mary,
 I see that Phil Bair from JWorthan has responded to Phil DeMoes concerning 
the bond term.  No comments were made concerning the legal opinion for the 
legal counsel for the bond provider.  I was going to suggest that the 
contract language be modified to provide that the Company had a reasonable 
amount of time at the end of the lst 5 yr bond term to provide a substitute 
bond for the remaining term and that if the Company was able to get a 
replacement bond in place before the expiration of such period, no default 
would occur.  Can you tell from the letter that Phil Bair is proposing if 
their are any other issues that either ENRON or the Bond Provider would have 
concerning the terms of the Bond and the Customer's methods of getting 
funding thereunder.

Dan,

Take a look at this letter prepared by our surety provider on the PEAK 
pre-pay.  In particular, note the last paragraph.  I'm concerned on the 
unwind if there is a default.   We plan to meet tomorrow with Joe Deffner and 
Breese tomorrow morning.  Are you available?

Subject: PEAK Surety Reference Letter


Phil-Attached is a first round draft of a reference letter for the PEAK 
project.  Please review and let me know what changes are suggested.

I've made calls to several of the major sureties this morning to re-confirm 
the availability of long term/non-cancellable bonds.  Five years is the 
general ceiling.  We need to be careful  PEAK understands that if the surety 
elects not to renew at the end of the first five years, this does not trigger 
an automatic demand against the bond.  PEAK should already know the issues 
involved from the surety side based on previous negotiations they had with 
other energy marketers when this project was negotiated (without success) 
last fall.  This is not an Enron issue-it goes to commercial availability.

Call me with your comments.  Thanks.

Dan:

As you know I will be in London next week .  Could you work with Barry to get 
this finalized.  It sound to me like all that needs to be done is print the 
document and put your initials on it.  There is also an index confirm to 
prepare.

Jeff, I understand that Stacey is on maternity leave.  This confirm is long 
over due. I have been working with Stacey to get it done. The attached 
document in it's finished state is what the customer and I have agreed to .  
Can you please have someone finalize the document and send back down to me 
for signatures.  

Barry 

PS. I also need the daily index confirm and we will clean it up also. BT

Stacey,  please find attached the completed marked up GTC that we need to 
finalize and re-submit to Crestar.

TO DO:    I have added a line in part 3 ( blue).  Add this section .  Either 
add in other terms that section 2 and 5 are not applicable for just delete 
them.. my preference is to just exclude them in the other terms piece rather 
than delete completely.


This will complete the monthy volumes confirm for Crestar. Make these changes 
and send back to me today. 

Thanks.

OTHER:  Please e-mail to me the latest version of the AOS balancing confirm 
and I will add changes that we went through. 

Call me if you have any questions but we are almost there... 

PS.  we must get this done now because as of Nov. 6 Crestar loses some of 
their staff and I don't want to start over on this process with new people.

iBuyit Payables Overview
When?  iBuyit Payables, a web-based system that will enable you to code and=
=20
approve invoices on-line, was activated on May 1st.

Who?  Invoices that were previously submitted to Houston Accounts Payable f=

2)  The goods and services are received and the vendor sends the invoice=20
(with the company name and number, the contact name, and coder's EID number=

to the new PO box.
3)  Accounts Payable scans the invoice, enters invoice header information=
=20
into SAP, and electronically routes the invoice through iBuyit Payables for=
=20
coding.
4)  The coder receives an e-mail with a link to iBuyit Payables, logs into=
=20
the system with their PID and password (SAP/eHRonline password), and codes=
=20
the invoice.
5)  The coder should either forward the invoice for approval or approve the=
=20
invoice, according to the invoice review and approval guidelines of their=
=20
business unit.
6)  Upon approval, the invoice is finalized, posted in SAP, and paid.=20

Dave,
 I am still waiting on the Credit Worksheet so that I can draft the 
agreement.  The Houston credit group claims that they have no request for 
this.  Please verify with the Credit Group so that  they would provide a 
credit worksheet directly to me for use in preparation of the contract.  
Otherwise, let me know how your negotiations on the transactions components 
is proceeding.

   Health Tips and News
   The Straight Dope On Food, Health, & Exercise:

   Q:  I've heard that cardiovascular exercise can prolong life. Is this
 true?
   A:  Your heart is only good for so many beats, and that's it. Everything
  wears out eventually. Speeding up your heart will not make you live
 longer;
  that's like saying you can extend the life of your car by driving it
  faster.  Want to live longer? Take a nap.

   Q: Should I cut down on meat and eat more fruits and vegetables?
   A: You must grasp logistical efficiencies. What does a cow eat? Hay and
  corn. And what are these? Vegetables. So a steak is nothing more than an
  efficient mechanism of delivering vegetables to your system. Need grain?
  Eat chicken. Beef is also a good source of field grass (green leafy
  vegetable). And a pork chop can give you 100% of your recommended daily
  allowance of vegetable slop.

   Q: Is beer or wine bad for me?
   A: Look, it goes to the earlier point about fruits and vegetables. As we
  all know, scientists divide everything in the world into three categories=
:
  animal, mineral, and vegetable. We all know that beer and wine are not
  animal, and they are not on the periodic table of elements, so that only
  leaves one thing, right? My advice: Have a burger and a beer and enjoy
 your
  liquid vegetables.

   Q: How can I calculate my body/fat ratio?
   A: Well, if you have a body, and you have body fat, your ratio is one to
  one. If you have two bodies, your ratio is two to one, etc.

    Q: At the gym, a guy asked me to "spot" for him while he did the bench
  press. What did he mean?
   A: "Spotting" for someone means you stand over him while he blows air up
  your shorts. It's an accepted practice at health clubs; though if you fin=
d
  that it becomes the ONLY reason why you're going in, you probably ought t=
o
  reevaluate your exercise program.

   Q: What are some of the advantages of participating in a regular exercis=
e
  program?
   A: Can't think of a single one, sorry.  My philosophy is: No Pain-No
 Pain.

   Q: If I stop drinking, will I live longer?
   A: Nope. Drinking enhances individual expression and peace of mind. If
  you stop, you'll probably stress yourself to death in record time.

   Q: Aren't fried foods bad for you?
   A: You're not listening. Foods are fried these days in vegetable oil. In
  fact, they're permeated in it. How could getting more vegetables be
 bad for
  you?

   Q: What's the secret to healthy eating?
   A: Thicker gravy.

   Q: Will sit-ups help prevent me from getting a little soft around the
  middle?
   A: Definitely not! When you exercise a muscle, it gets bigger. You shoul=
d
  only be doing sit-ups if you want a bigger stomach.

  I hope this has cleared up any misconceptions you may have had.

Dan and Greg,

Attached is a proposed combined gty that TXU is now proposing because of the 
time constraints (one Gty expired yesterday and another is about to expire on 
the 15th).  They would like to combine the business of ENA, ECC with two of 
their trading entities for a total of $50MM.  This format does not include 
the deregulation  language that the prior gty that I sent you both to review 
back in March (they are doing this simply to expedite the process).  Please 
review this format and get back to me with any comments/revisions so that I 
can communicate them to the counterparty ASAP.

Thanks--

Peter and Dan--

TXU is in the process of amending the current Guaranty to have the cap amount 
increased due to an increase in trading.  Please review the attached document 
and send any commentary back to my attention.  The beneficiaries involved are 
both Enron North America Corp. and Enron Canada Corp.

I would appreciate a prompt response in order to have the Guaranty executed 
as soon as possible by the counterparty due to the current exposure that we 
currently have out to them.



Thank you,

Veronica Espinoza

Ellen,
 We need to resend because the trader agreed to some additional modifications 
after that date.

Dan,

I've had a look into this, and my system show that Jennifer Blay sent the 
confirm to the counterparty October 2, after it was revised by Stacy Dickson.
I will confirm this with Jennifer in the morning.

Would you like a copy of what was sent out ?

Regards
Ellen

Barry Tycholiz says that the attached is in final form and should be Raised 
directly with Crestar in the final state and send  to them.  Assuming they 
have no problem with the paper.... we should be done on the monthly firm deal.

Therefore, please issue this negotiated GTC confirm on ENA stationary.  Stacy 
Dickson has been working with Barry on this and I made the last changes which 
had been negotiated.  Call if you have any questions?

Barry,
 The attached document appears to be in final form.  It is ready to be put on 
ENA stationary and sent to Crestar.  If you are going to do this please send 
me a hard copy of what is sent out.  As written, the document does not need 
to be signed by either party.  If you want the ENA confirm desk to send it 
out, please let me know and I will forward it to them to send, however, in 
each case, the document will not need to be signed by either party.  Please 
advise.

A GISB can be used for deals longer than a month if they are fully 
interruptible.  However, we would only use the GISB for firm business If they 
limit their business to one month or less which would include a 31 day 
month.   The $20MM credit line represents the mark-to-market exposure of all 
business that ENA would be doing with the customer so that any deal that 
would tend to exceed the aggregate credit line would need to be separately 
supported with additional credit documentation, i.e., a letter of credit or a 
increase in the coverage under a parent guarantee.

Subject: RE: Physical Contracts


Phil,

Thank you for your explanation of the billing process.  Your email raised
some questions for us.

Specifically, we do not understand your statement that the GISB is an
interruptible contract for gas supply that is 30 days or less.

The GISB form you mailed us is similar to GISB's which we have received from
other companies.  All specifically state in the bottom disclaimer paragraph
of the first page that "This Contract is intended for Interruptible
transactions or Firm transactions of one month or less and may not be
suitable for Firm transactions of longer than one month."  Further, in the
interior of the GISB, on Exhibit A, there is a place to check whether one
wants firm or interruptible.

The intent of this email is to clarify.  Our interpretation is that GISBs
can be for firm (which is what we would want to do), and they would be for
31 day months as well as 30 day or less. Do you agree with this?

If our interpretation is correct, it is not clear why a Master Firm is
needed.  Can you explain what the value add is to our doing business?
[Perhaps it would be useful for a case where we wanted to cover our long
term purchases for a combined cycle plant which we intended to operate every
day of the year other than scheduled maintenance outages.]

Lastly, in our notes from our meeting, I wrote that Enron had offered an
initial $20MM credit line for Oglethorpe. When doing physical contracts
either under a GISB or your Master Firm, does this amount represent a Mark
to Market limit or a nominal limit?

We have our people reviewing GISB, ISDA, and Master Firm as I write this. We
look forward to your responses.

Hey Laurence,

Good meeting you and Larry yesterday.   I think we had some good discussion
yesterday and it seems like we have some things we can work on together.

As far as the contracts, a couple of clarifications and an answer to your
question below.

You should have received a Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement via email
and hard copy.  Additionally, you have already received  a GISB contract
and a ISDA Agreement.  Here is a brief description of what each of them do:

   GISB - Gas Industry Standards Board Agreement - this is an interruptible
   contract for gas supply that is 30 days or less.  OPC would not be able
   to lock forward NYMEX prices on this contract but can purchase short
   term supplies.
   ISDA - this contract is for financial positions only.  If you wanted to
   enter into swaps or derivative based products, you can perform them
   under this contract without ever having to take physcial delivery.
   Master Firm - Under this contract, OPC will be purchasing firm gas
   supply and will be able to lock forward values on the NYMEX.  Note that
   this is a physcial contract which will require OPC to take delivery.
   OPC will receive a bill from Enron around the 5th after the month of
   delivery and will be required to pay no later than the 25th.  If the
   25th is on a weekend or holdiay, then the invoice will be due on the
   next business day.  OPC payment obligations are always after the month
   of delivery no later than the 25th with no need for any payments
   beforehand.  Note that under Triggering Event in Section 4.2, either
   party may need to provide additional credit assurances in the event of a
   material change which could cause a letter of credit to be issued.

Let me know if you did not receive the Master Firm Agreement or if you have
any more questions.

Thanks.

Phil DeMoes

Phil,

One quick question we forgot to ask yesterday.  If OPC were to to place an
order for physical contract for a delivery month of this summer,  when
would
we have to pay for this?  Would it be so many days after the end of the
month in which
received, etc? Would there be any cash due upon placing the order?

There is a second document that Stacey was working on that is pretty much 
identical as the Monthly firm deal but involves only gas on Alliance called 
AOS ( this is like Interuptable gas, but a little different ). The confirms 
has been raised previously, and you should have this on file. 

This is the file name on the bottom of Stacey's last document.  
o:\common\legal\sdickson\agreements\crestarspotcnfm.doc. 

Let me know... 

PS . did you send the confirm to Crestar on the firm volumes. BT

will issue a Certificate of Incumbency showing that the person executing the 
contract for ENA is authorized to execute contracts for ENA.  No other party 
signs as to form or terms, however, the officer executing for ENA will 
require that the deal person and I initial on the line next to his 
signature.  I have reviewed the proposed draft resolution.  ENA will accept 
the enacted resolution and will not require that the City Attorney issue an 
opinion.  If the attached contract is acceptable, please print off 2 
originals, have them approved, signed and forward to me for ENA's approval 
and signature.  Once the contract is fully executed, I will return one fully 
executed original to you for the City's file.

THE NEW NEWLYWEDGAME
 submitted by MeanBabaJean

This couple had only been married for two weeks. The husband, although very 
much in love, couldn't wait to go out into town and party with his old 
buddies, so he says to his new wife, "Honey, I'll be right back..."?

"Where are you going Coochy Cooh...?" asked the wife.?

"I'm going to the bar, Pretty Face. I'm going to have a beer."?

The wife says to him, "You want a beer my love?" Then she opens the door to 
the refrigerator and shows him 25 different kinds of beer brands from 12 
different countries: Germany, Holland, Japan, India, etc.?

The husband doesn't know what to do, and the only thing that he can think of 
saying is, "Yes, Honey Pie...but the bar you know...the frozen glass..."?

He didn't get to finish the sentence, when the wife interrupts him by 
saying,"You want a frozen glass Puppy Face?" She takes a mug out of the 
freezer so frozen that she was getting chills holding it.?

The husband, looking a bit pale, says, "Yes, Tootsie Roll, but at the bar 
they have those hors d'oeuvres that are really delicious... I won't be long 
I'll be right back. I promise. OK?"?

"You want hors d'oeuvres Pookie Pooh?" She opens the oven and takes out 15 
dishes of different hors d'oeuvres: chicken wings, pigs in a blanket, 
mushroom caps, pork strips, etc.?

"But Sweetie, Honey...at the bar...you know...the swearing, the dirty words 
and all that. .."?

"You want dirty words Cutie Pie?..HERE, DRINK YOUR F*****G BEER IN YOUR 
FROZEN F*****G MUG AND EAT YOUR F*****G SNACKS, BECAUSE YOU AREN'T GOING 
ANYWHERE! GOT IT A*****E?!!"


Subject: FW: Fw: HER BALLONS



    A small boy walks into his mother's room and catches her topless.
     "Mummy, Mummy, what are those?" he says pointing to her breasts. "Well,
son,"she says, These are balloons, and when you die, they inflate and float
    you up to heaven," Incredibly, he appears to believe this explanation
and
goes
    off quite satisfied.
    Two days later while his mother is making tea, he rushes into the
kitchen.
    "Mummy, mummy, Aunt Eliza is dying!" "What do you mean?" says his
    mother."Well she's out in the garden shed, lying on the floor with both
of
    her balloons out. Dad's trying to blow themup for her and she keeps
yelling,
"God, I'm coming! God, I'm coming!"

Teresa,
 I have reviewed the revisions to the VPP transaction with Charlie Otto.  We 
have a concern relating to the term.  The term of this letter should be for 
the period ending April 30, 2001.  The reason for our reluctance in extending 
the term is that we do not know what conditions Texas Gas may put on the next 
OFO nor do we know what conditions El Paso may put on the processing.

Ellen,
 This should be okay.  I would prefer that all GTCs in excess of 6 months be 
prepared for signature by both ENA and the counterparty.  Is this a problem?

 You are correct.  I do not have the information at this time.  Can you 
execute without the information.  I will get Enovate to fill in the

Ellen,
     I received your voice mail and your email this morning.  I made each
of the changes from your email to the two contract documents.  Please
review and if acceptable, please start the execution process by printing
two originals of each document.  Once signed by Reliant, please forward to
me and I will have ENA sign their contract and I will attempt to get
Enovate to sign and return their contract and the two transaction
agreements to me for forwarding one fully set to you.  Please call if you
have any questions.  My phone number is (713)853-6895.

I have reviewed the pro-forma May 17, 2000 draft of the Gas Purchase Contract 
provided to you by the subject party.  The only item that has to be changed 
is the second sentence of 22.2 relating to venue in Cook County, Illinois.  
This sentence needs to be deleted.  Enron would prefer to be the confirming 
party in sections 2.2 and 2.3; however, that is our preference but we can 
agree to let the other party be the confirming party when necessary.  Please 
get with your counterparty and let me know how you would like to proceed.

Darren,
 There are no previous confirmations.  You have one single purpose contract 
that was done in 1994 that has a primary term through 8/31/02.  What do you 
mean "preceding confirmations".  Confirmations are only done under trading 
type master contracts.  That does not apply to the current contract with 
Haldor.  You should become familar with the current contract before you 
request changes to that deal.

Dan,
I am under the impression that this Master Physical Contract will supercede 
any preceding confirmations.Please correct me if I am wrong.

Darren,
 Please reread.  This confirm covers the period 9/1/02 - 8/31/04.  The 
current deal stays in effect until 8/31/02.  Let me know about the hyphen.  
That is the way they signed the last contract.  You have their published 
financials,  How is it in the signature portion of those.

Dan,
Everything looks good. In the openning paragraph, I think that 
"Haldor-Topsoe" should not have the hyphen. Am I correct in assuming that 
this master supercedes all existing confirms?

Darren,
I am going to send three options to Haldor Topsoe to choose from; all three 
will require a master physical:
 1) Leave current deal at 125% Index and add 1200 mmbtu/d new volumes through 
8/31/2002 @ 115% Index
 2) Price existing deal and new volumes through 8/31/2002 @ 120% Index
 3)  Show a variety of floors and collars to reduce the index percentage 
through 8/31/2002 for all volumes.
I believe I have approval for these three options.  MTM value for all options 
should calculate to be around $230,000.

However, now is an outstanding time to increase the value to Enron by 
extending this deal another two years and hence doubling the MTM value.  They 
will not transact at  these levels two years from now without us having to 
put facilities in the ground.  Please consider a two year extension or tell 
me what requirements would have to be met to do this.

Thanks,

Gary

Gary,
 As I stated before, I will forward a new worksheet to Dan Hyvl for JER/BRE, 
but we are NOT to enter into another transaction until the document is 
executed. Seeing as JER wanted to fix a price this week, I think that it will 
be difficult to get this deal completed. Please follow up with Wayne at JER.
 In addition, I am forwading a worksheet for Haldor Topsoe as well. We can 
NOT enter into the new transaction with additional volumes with them until 
their master is signed as well. 

If you have any questions please call.

Hey Dan, Gary,

Gary entered into this transation to sell this counterparty 1,000 mmbtu/d at 
an Index related price with a Put option of $3.50 and a premium of 0.095.  As 
I understand it, Gary will never be buying gas from his counterparty and this 
is the only transaction he plans on doing with the counterparty.  If this is 
the case, I would think only a Master Sales agreement would be needed instead 
of a Master Purchase Sale Agreement and thus a Credit Worksheet is not 
needed. Please let me know if this is not the case.

Thanks
Russell

Ed,
 I am still waiting for you to tell me which Deal Person is the contact for 
the counterparty.  I need the Deal Person to initial the contract before an 
officer will sign.  If I send it to Scott Neal or one of the other desk 
heads, they will want the deal person to initial before they sign.  
Therefore, I am still waiting on you to tell me who trades with this 
counterparty.  I am holding the contract for that person.  If it is someone 
on the HPL desk, then we have to start over because you requested that the 
contract be done in ENA's name.

I appreciate the time you took to have Enron's legal department review the 
non-disclosure agreement.  Unfortunately, Silgan cannot accept the requested 
changes, and specifically the deletion of paragraph 5.  As a result we have 
decided not to pursue a business relationship with Enron.

Thanks again for your time.

 I believe that the schedule is self explanatory and no letter needs to be

As you are aware, Franklin Adkins has removeed his meters from ENA effective 
February 1, 2001.  Mr. Adkins has a fixed price, firm deal with ENA  for 
13,000 Dth/month @ $3.075.  The term is 4/1/00 through 3/31/01.  Mr. Adkins 
has breached his contract with ENA by pulling his meters 2 months before the 
end of the contract.

Attached you will find a schedule calculating what we owe Mr. Adkins for 
January 2001 Actuals, LESS the contractual commitments for February and March 
2001.

Should a letter as well as this schedule be sent to Mr. Adkins explaining 
that ENA is reducing his January payment by the February and March 
commitment?  If so, would you write the letter?


John

The November 2000 contract is the new deal with reliant.  We need to verify 
that we have a master between HPL and Reliant Energy Services, Inc.  If not, 
the old contract needs to be assigned to HPL.  Certain deals that were shown 
to the purchaser of HPL included business being done with Reliant Energy 
Services, Inc.  That means that if we don't have an HPL master, we need to do 
one for them.  Two deals were shown as HPL, however, they may have been GTCs, 
if so, we would need to create a master, and if the old master still exists, 
i would like to assign it to HPL so that they would have a contract to use 
after July.  Call me if you have any questions.

Mike,
     I have reviewed the attached marked copy of the transaction agreement
and have gone over the changes with Craig.  Please change the term "best
efforts" which was added in the 14th line of Item 1 under Other to read
"commercially reasonable best efforts".  This will keep the concept the
same throughout the document where we use the term "commercially reasonable
best efforts".  With this change, please print out two copies of the
contract and two copies of the transaction agreement and proceed with
execution of each.  Please call if you have any questions.

I agree with you on points 2,5,8.  just delete them in the confirm.

With regards to point 2. As long as the language reflects that best efforts 
are taken to buy/sell gas at Daily Index when required and then it goes to a 
fixed price I am fine with it.

Lisa,
 Barbara Gray requested that I fax a copy of the subject guaranty to you for 
your review.  This guaranty was not included in the initial list of 
guarantees provided by the credit group.  Apparently one of the analyst had 
the file pulled and on his desk for review.  
 Barbara has also asked that you prepare a Substitution and Release Agreement 
for this guaranty.

 Please call me if you have any questions.  My phone number is 713-853-6895.

Grant,
 I have reviewed your requested changes and have made the changes which do 
not require explanation or clarification.  Those changes are reflected in the 
above document.  Let me go over your list of items:
 1. I have deleted the word "DRAFT".
 2. I have left a blank for the date within the month of March 2001 when the 
contract would be executed by the City.
 3. I have changed the word "may" to "shall".
 4. Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity does not fit in a Deficiency 
Default, it is just the maximum quantity that can be handled by a party at a 
particular point.  I do not think their is an omission.
 5. I have added the word "reasonable".
 6. The procedue for how the Termination Payment is determined is provided, 
if the City disagrees with the method and values provided in the statement 
and is unable to convince the Company to revise, the statement, then the 
issue is to be resolved in arbitration.  At the point that a Termination 
Payment calculation is necessary, a long drawn out period should not be 
necessary to attain closure.
 7. We need to limit the duration to 30 days,  neither party should be 
required to wait 60 days before it could accelerate the other party's 
obligations under the Contract.  We might be able to add language to extend 
the period if we had some documentation stating the steps that a party was 
pursuing to cause the proceeding to be dismissed and the other party was 
otherwise kept whole from a credit exposure.
 8. I have kept the 30 days because 5 days is too short a period.  During a 
holiday period, one scheduling error could cover the entire period.  Article 
3 has language which provides a remedy for a party if a scheduling default 
extends for more than 5 days during any month. 
 9. The reason is because Enron Corp. is the rated entity and no separate 
rating applies to ENA.
 10. I have changed "a" to "the"
 11. I have eliminated the  60 day limitation on the duration of an event of 
Force Majeure.
 12. This merely addressed the possibility of a imbalance amount being due 
when a pipeline aggregates imbalances using multiple points, and the language 
would allocated the payment based on the amount of the imbalance that a 
particular party may have caused.  I think the language is clear as written.
 13. The definition of Act was one of the items that I had requested that you 
review and complete as necessary so that all appropriate statutes were 
referenced.  I am still waiting for your language.  I started filling it in 
using language that had been provided by the City.
 14. I added the word "reasonable".
 15. I have made the requested change relating to GAAAP.
 16. This is a late payment provision and as such a believe that the 
provision should be more than a party's rating, as such I have kept the 2% 
over prime language.
 17. These amounts were determined by the credit group and any change needs 
to be discussed with that group.  BBB-  is considered investment grade and I 
understand that Enron Corp.'s rating is BBB.  ENA is not a rated entity and 
that is why the language relates to Enron Corp.'s rating.
 18. The elimination of the opinion of counsel did not change the 
requirements relating to the representations that we expect the City to have 
made.  If the City cannot make these representations, then we need to know 
that before we execute the Contract.
 19. I have added the word "reasonable".
 20. The party that has the Transport Agreement with the Transporter should 
have the legal right to obtain the information based on its contract.  
 21. It is our position that any dispute be arbitrated.  We can agree to 
meditation if we can make the outcome binding on the parties.  I am willing 
to discuss any changed language that you might care to offer.
 22. We have found that personnel of both our Company and that of our 
Customers change so rapidily that the list is not workable and merely allows 
a party to back out of transactions it does not like on the basis that the 
person who agreed to such transaction was not on the list.  Therefore , we 
object to any listing of approved parties who can transact.  We believe that 
each party should be responsible for the actions of its employees and should 
stand behind any transactions that those parties may enter into pursuant to 
the terms and provisions of the Contract.  

 I will be out of the office on Friday, but will be in all next week if you 
care to discuss any of these matters.

		 Subject: RE: Enfolio Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement


 <<0071988 RESO Enron.doc>>

Dan:

First, I've attached the proposed resolution which authorizes the City
Manager to execute the Enfolio agreement.

More importantly, I need to inform you that our senior management has
reviewed the referenced contract; I have been asked to present additional
changes to the agreement for Enron's consideration and to raise questions
about certain of its terms and conditions.

Let me start from page 1, top to bottom, and proceed to the end of the
exhibits.

1.  There is the word "DRAFT" above the title of the Enfolio agreement which
should be deleted.

2.  The introductory paragraph, line 5, should not contain the words "1st of
January, 2001."  It should be left blank, until the parties have signed the
contract.  Otherwise, the City will be in breach as of the date it signs the
contract, because Article 2, section 2.1 requires the City to proffer the
to-be-approved-by-Council resolution as of 1/1/01.

3.  Article 2, Section 2.4, line 2.  The City (Customer) wants Enron
(Company) to confirm every recorded telephonic Transaction, as defined.
Therefore, the City requests the word "may" should be changed to "shall."

4.  Article 3, Sections 3.1 and 3.2, first sentence:   Buyer's Requested
Quantity refers to the DCQ or MaxDQ.  Seller's failure to Schedule the
Buyer's Requested Quantity shall constitute a Seller's Deficiency Default.
How does a Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity fit into a Seller's
Deficiency Default if the Buyer's Requested Quantity does not include a
Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity?  What is the reason for the omission?

5.  Article 4, Section 4.1, lines 15 and 23:  Line 23 refers to "reasonable
attorneys' fees" yet line 15 refers to "attorneys' fees."  To be internally
consistent, line 15 should say "reasonable attorneys' fees."

6.  Section 4.1, right hand column, lines 3-4.  A statement showing the
determination of the Termination Payment will be prepared.  It's unclear
whether the City is entitled to review and challenge the determination
before a dispute is referred to arbitration.  The City should be entitled to
receive a copy of the determination and to question it before it is
obligated to pay the Termination Payment.  Please clarify, or permit the
City to exercise these rights.

7.  Section 4.2(iv) specifies that a Triggering Event will exist if a
bankruptcy petition is undismissed within 30 days.  Is this (under
bankruptcy laws) the minimum period of time within which one may seek
dismissal of a bankruptcy petition?  Please refer to the 11 USC section that
backs up this provision, or change to 60 days.

8.  Section 4.2(v) and (vi):  Please change "30 days" to "5 days."  The City
is concerned with the number of days that Enron may be permitted to fail to
Schedule before a Triggering Event is triggered by Enron.

9.  Section 4.2(ix):  this language discusses a default by Enron Corp.
(ENA's parent?), but no mention is made of ENA's default in this regard?
Please explain.

10. Section 4.5, line 4:  Is "a Company" supposed to refer to "the Company"
?

11. Article 5.  The City is uncomfortable with the force majeure provision
as drafted.  It states that the parties must perform even if a FM event
(earthquake) would prevent either or both parties from performing with the
60-day period stated therein.  There is no such limitation under California
law in the absence of a contract provision to the contrary.

12.  Article 7, Section 7.2:  Could Enron translate the last sentence?  We
don't understand it.

13.  Appendix "1":  Act:  Please explain why Section 3 is referred to?

14.  Appendix "1", Claims, line 4:  Please add "reasonable" before
"attorneys' fees.

 15.  Appendix "1", GAAP:  This should read: "GAAP means generally accepted
accounting principles, consistently applied, with respect to Company, and
governmental generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied,
with respect to Customer."

16.  Appendix "1", Interest Rate:  Please delete "two percent over".  The
City has a AAA bond rating, therefore, the  City believes the 2% over prime
should not apply to it.

17.  Appendix "1", Material Adverse Change:  What does Enron believe the
City's Net Worth to be?  The $400 million threshold is mentioned.  Also,
what is ENA's bond rating?  Is "BBB-" an investment grade rating?

18.  Representations and Warranties:  Because we have agreed that the
opinion of counsel will not be required, the reps and warranties are being
deleted.  But the "Representations and Warranties" is nevertheless included
in the agreement.  Item (i) should be deleted, because the City has not
undertaken a court search as is our custom and practice whenever we issue an
opinion.  We would like to delete "and (vii) it is not ... Party."

19.  Operational Flow Orders, line 8:  Please add "reasonable" before
"attorneys' fees."

20.  Financial Matters, line 8:  What is meant by "to the extent it has a
legal right of access thereto and/or ...etc."

21.  Arbitration, Disputes to be Arbitrated.  We do not as a matter of legal
policy agree to arbitration, but we will mediate disputes.  Is Enron
amenable to mediation?  This process is less formal and less costly in my
opinion.

22.  Authority for Transactions.  Staff would like the Agreement to include
a list of employees for Company and Customer who are authorized to trade on
behalf of their employers.  Could a statement be added to this section to
this effect?  Then, we could attach the list(s) as an Exhibit C.

Thank you so much for considering these issues.  There are others which I
hope to receive from staff next week and which I will forward to you for
response.

Look forward to hearing from you soon.  I will be out of town after today
until Wednesday, March 7.

Sincerely,

Grant Kolling

Dan,

Per our conversation on Friday regarding HPL, please coordinate with Clement 
to issue a new guaranty.  As you recall, Aquila Energy Marketing Corporation 
has $50MM of exposure from HPL and they have requested additional security 
above the amount in the current guaranty listing HPL (gty2846.doc).  Please 
issue a new guaranty for HPL covering Aquila Energy Marketing Corporation for 
physical natural gas in the amount of $50MM.  In addition, please put 
language in this guaranty which would amend the existing guaranty 
(gty2846.doc) that would remove HPL. 

Thank you,

Russell

however, any new wording is shown in red.  I attempted to complete the 
reference to the Act by going to the California constitution for a site

counsel feels that this is incorrect, please have them furnish me with the 
proper reference.  If the agreement is in order, please print off two

volumes through such points which should have been received from Company.

Instead of saying that the customer has just 10 days written notice to get

Ellen,
 The enovate office in Chicago tells me that the addresses in the Contract 
are correct as written and that they have gotten with the people in Houston 
to get them to leave the addresses as contained in the contract.  Regarding 
the Financially Firm language, I would suggest that you line through the word 
Financially in each case where it occurs in the contract, line through the 
entire definition of Financially Firm and have the person who signs for 
Reliant initial each of the line outs.   I do not feel that we need to define 
the term Firm.  Our view of the contract is that the obligations are always 
firm so no further clarification is needed.  Do you concur?  If so, forward 
the signed and initialled contracts together with the signed Transaction 
Agreements and I will have the enovate officer also initial the line outs and 
return a final fully executed contract to you.

Will Enovate cause us to become "undone" or what?  Today, one of our
Accountants asked me to change the address for Enovate to the Enron,
Houston address.  Just the day before, I had set contracts up in our gas
management system and used the Notices/Correspondence/Invoices section from
the Enovate contract to complete the areas of the contract that would feed
the Accounting module as well as the Contracts module, this being the
Chicago, Illinois information.  So, I politely told the Accountant that the
info in the gas management system was correct as entered.  He (the
Accountant) had spoken with an Accountant from ENA (Doug Nelson at
713/853-0560) and Doug told him that the invoices, etc. should go to
Enovate c/o Enron at 1400 Smith, Room EB3718, Houston, TX 77002.  Do you
have any objection to changing this in the contract?  Please advise, we'd
like to do what would best streamline this process.

Well Dan, hopefully, this will be ironed out one day soon and everything
will run smoothly.  Thanks again for your help.

Regards,
Ellen

Subject:  Enovate, L.L.C. Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement

Dan:

I have a dilemma and I'm almost too embarrassed to ask you to help me
resolve it.  As a matter of policy in this department, we are to stress the
fact that we "need" "financially firm" language in all contracts.  When the
Trader requested a contract with Enovate, he was not clear about his
trading intentions and it was assumed that "financially firm" "needed" to
be in the contract.  It seems that this language is now holding up the
execution process of the Enovate LLC contract.  The Business Unit wants
"financially firm" out and "firm" substituted.

The definition for "firm" that they want in the contract is the standard
definition for "firm" that is in the GISB as follows:

"Firm" shall mean that either party may interrupt its performance without
liability only to the extent that such performance is prevented for reasons
of Force Majeure; provided, however, that during Force Majeure
interruptions, the party invoking Force Majeure may be responsible for any
imbalance charges as set forth in Section 7.2 related to its interruption
after the nomination is made to the Transporter and until the change in
deliveries and/or receipts is confirmed by the Transporter.

I believe the only other place in the contract that "Financially Firm"
appears is on the first page, Article 2. SCOPE OF AGREEMENT:, second line,
would you please change that occurrence of "Financially Firm" to just
"firm"?

Dan, can you help me with this without trashing the whole contract?  On the
first page, we can line through "Financially" and initial, and then just
the definition page on the first page of APPENDIX "1" would have to be
redone to replace "Financially Firm" with just "Firm".

Please let me know if this is able to be done.

Thanks and I'm so sorry,

Ellen Dailey

It is my understanding that cashouts coming from Unify look like regular 
sales and purchases.  The accounts used are as follows:

TYPE                                                                ACCOUNT

Cashout Sale - Third Party                             483
Cashout Sale - Intercompany                       484
Cashout Purchase - Third Party                   803
Cashout Purchase - Intercompany              803?

This is how the FERC module in SAP is mapping them.

Rita/Kris - let me know if my understanding of Unify is correct.

See Tom's message regarding cashouts.  Please reply directly to him and copy 
me so I will know how to list these transactions on the tariffs and whether 
the revenue is applicable for TRRC Gross Receipts Tax.  Thanks!

I guess the transport tariff is as good a place to refer to cashouts as 
anywhere.  How should they be listed on the tariffs?  And what (NARUC) 
account are cashouts booked under?

All of the assignment documents are supposed to be filed in the contract 
file.  Please review the contract file for these assignment effective dates.  
The date something is invoiced has nothing to do with the tariff filings, 
what is important is the delivery period and terms.  imbalance cashouts 
should be reported as such under the transport tariff, not a sales tariff, 
unless the transport does not provide for cash-out in which case a separate 
sales tariff needs to be set up to go with the Sales Contract which should be 
in the contract file.  Do you agree?

Dan:  The following sales contracts were listed on the HPL Annual Report 
without a tariff number.  

Would you review the following information and advise as to whether a sales 
tariff filing is required.  It appears that the transactions related to these 
sales contracts took place prior to the time the contracts were assigned to 
Houston Pipe Line Company.  Let me know if the tariffs we prepared to respond 
to the Auditors query, should truly be included with our November 10th TRRC 
Tariff Filing Report..

Contract #96022611:  H&D Operating Company - Gas Lift Sales:  Delivery period 
01/99 Invoiced 9/10/99; Delivery period 02/99 Invoiced 10/12/99.   HPL needs 
sales tariff for period after assignment.  (When did this get assigned to 
HPL?)

Contract #96019866:  OXY USA. Inc. - Imbalance Cashout Contract: Delivery 
period 03/99; Demand Charge Invoiced 3/26/99.  Why shouldn't this be under 
the transport tariff for this transport imbalance. DAN

Contract #96022610: Preferred Pipeline Company - GTC Sale Spot: Delivery 
period 01/99 and 02/99; Invoiced 08/27/99. Who issued the GTC, if HPL, then 
HPL needs to file a sales tariff. DAN

Contract #96019865: Texcol Gas Services Inc. - Imbalance Cashout Contract 
(Contract was set up per Tommy Yanowski relating to the imbalance on 
Terminated Transport Agreement 12-88974-204  (311a2(284C)Offshore Tx); 
Delivery period 02/99; Invoiced 03/25/99. Cashout under 311transport should 
not require a tariff filing, however, it may require a FERC filing. DAN

Contract #9600821: HPL Resources Company - Master Purchase Sale Firm.
Delivery period 01/99, Invoiced 02/12/99
Delivery period 02/99, Invoiced 03/24/99
Delivery period 04/99, Invoiced 06/10/99; 09/10/99
Accounting Summary Report of Manual Invoices recorded in the G/L for 01/99, 
03/99, 04/99, 05/99, 06/99, 07/99, 09/99, 10/99, 11/99 and  12/99.
Do you know when this contract came back to HPL and should the tariff reflect 
activity that took place prior to when it was assigned to HPL?  This 
information should be in the contract file.  The tariff should not  reflect 
activity prior to the time the contract was assigned to HPL.  DAN
 
I will need to get final information to Carla Nguyen AS SOON AS POSSIBLE so 
she can make the appropriate notations to the annual report pages 31a2, 31a3 
and 31a4.

Thanks for all your help!

Grant, 
 I have removed the red-line from the above document.  If it is in order, 
please print 2 originals, have them signed, and forward to me for signature 
by Enron.  I will attach a list of current traders who might be available to 
handle a trade with Palo Alto, and I will also have  a certificate of 
incumbency attached for the officer signing in behalf of Enron, and return a 
fully executed contract for your files.
 Regarding the OFO language, usually the pipeline notifies its customers of 
the OFO event and leave it to those customers to notify their parties.  
Therefore, if Enron is scheduling gas into your transport contract and your 
transporter declares an OFO, you will get notice and be responsible for 
giving that notice to Enron after which time Enron would be responsible for 
its actions that were not in accord with the OFO notification.  Likewise, if 
Enron receives notification from its transporter and notified Palo Alto and 
Palo Alto failed to adjust its actions in compliance with the OFO 
notification, Palo Alto would be responsible for the consequences of such 
failure.  Usually, the OFO notification would require that the parties make 
their receipts and deliveries balance in accordance with their scheduled 
volumes.    I am not familiar with the concept of EFO, but do not think that  
the OFO provisions apply.  Please advise as to what is meant by EFO so that I 
can verify with the transport group.

Dan,
 I have attached the first draft of the Petrogulf Corporation purchase 
agreement and gathering agreement.  As we discussed this morning, I have made 
no mention to the Bear Paw issue.  Additionally, your proposal is to purchase 
up to 10,000/d at NGPL (OK) Index.  Is the next item in error, it reads 
"above 5,000 up to 80%".  I changed it to "above 10,000 up to 80%".  Please 
review, I believe I incorporated all of your items in the form, if not, 
please call and I will modify.

 The transaction agreement (2000-90crfm.doc) still needs to be finalized by 
including the missing information to be added in the blanks as well as 
finalization of the price to be applicable.  The contract documents should be

Not long ago and far away, Santa was getting 
?ready for his annual trip...but there were 
?problems everywhere. 

?Four of his elves got sick, and the trainee elves 
?did not produce the toys as fast as the regular 
?ones so Santa was beginning to feel the pressure 
?of being behind schedule. 

?Then Mrs. Claus told Santa that her mom was coming 
?to visit. This stressed Santa even more. 

?When he went to harness the reindeer, he found that 
?three of them were about to give birth and two had 
?jumped the fence and were out, heaven knows where. 
?More Stress. 

?Then when he began to load the sleigh, one of the 
?boards cracked and the toy bag fell to the ground 
?and scattered the toys. 

?Totally frustrated, Santa went into the house for 
?a cup of coffee and a shot of whiskey. When he went 
?to the cupboard, he found the elves had hit the 
?liquor and there was nothing to drink. 

?In his frustration, he dropped the coffee pot 
?and it broke into hundreds of little pieces all 
over the kitchen floor. He went to get the broom 
?and found that mice had eaten the straw it was made 
?from. 

?Just then the door bell rang and Santa cussed 
?on his way to the door. He opened the door and 
?there was a little angel with a great big 
?Christmas tree. The angel said: "Where would you 
?like to put this tree fat man?" 

And that my friend, is how the little angel came 
?to be on top of the Christmas tree

Kevin,
 As we discussed, here are the changes I feel need to be made to the form 
before Enron North America Corp.  can agree to use it.

1.  Change 1.1 to read as follows:  This Agreement shall be effective upon 
its execution and shall continue in full force and effect through December 
31, 2000.

2.  Change 3.1 to read as follows:  Upon not less than 36 hours advance 
notification by Vector, Seller shall be obligated to sell and deliver to 
Vector, and Vector shall be obligated to purchase and receive from Seller, at 
the time stipulated by Vector in the advance written notification, at a Point 
of Sale, a quantity of gas equal to Seller's PSQ for such Point of Sale, as 
specified in Exhibit A to this Agreement.  The parties agree that time is of 
the essence in this Agreement..

3.  Add 4.2 to read as follows:  4.2  If Vector fails to purchase and receive 
from Seller the quantity of gas required to be purchased and received by it 
under Article 3.1 for any reason other than the occurrence of an event of 
Force Majeure, Vector shall indemnify Seller and shall be liable to pay 
Seller an amount equal to the difference between the price that would have 
been paid to Seller and the Gas Daily low price, set forth in Gas Daily under 
the heading "Daily Price Survey" under the listing applicable to Chicago and 
using the low price in the range of prices published for the day that Vector 
failed to perform multiplied by the volume Vector failed to purchase and 
receive from Seller for such day.

4.  Add the following language at the end of 9.1.  For breach of any 
provision for which an express remedy or measure of damages is herein 
provided, such express remedy or measure of damages shall be the sole and 
exclusive remedy hereunder.  If no remedy or measure of damages is expressly 
herein provided, the obligor's liability shall be limited to direct actual 
damages only, such direct actual damages shall be the sole and exclusive 
remedy hereunder and all other remedies or damages at law or in equity are 
waived.  Unless expressly herein provided, neither party shall be liable for 
consequential, incidental, punitive, exemplary or indirect damages, lost 
profits or other business interruption damages, in tort, contract, under any 
indemnity provision or otherwise.

5.  Add the following Seller's information in 10.1.

Kim,
 We currently have a Master with Eastern New Mexico Natural Gas Association,

once it is put in the system.

Dan, 

Thanks for looking at this for me.  I did remove the phrase you mention in 
number 1 below.  As for a volume cap, I don't think that one is necessary in 
this case.  Their TW contract limits them to 1000 MMBtu/day.  Any prices that 
are fixed will not include TW transport charges.

Thanks again,

Kim

ps, once their board approves this term sheet, we will need to do a 
confirmation.  Will this be generated by you or when the deal is entered into 
the system?

Kim,
 I have reviewed your term sheet and have the following questions.  
1.  Under Term, you have included the phrase "with annual redetermination" 
however I find no redetermination language in the Price  section.  I would 
suggest that the phrase be deleted.
2.  Under Quantity, you indicate there expected volumes, however, we need to 
put some cap on the maximum, With a 5 year term, we should offer some maximum 
such as 200% of the expected volumes.  Any thoughts relating to a cap?
3.  Under Price you indicate that the price could be changed to a Fixed 
Price, I assume that you do not intend to include the Transwestern 
transportation charges as a part of the Fixed Price.  Is this correct?  and 
if so, does the Fixed Price language need to be qualified?  
 Otherwise, the term sheet appears okay.

Attached is a term sheet that has been sent to Eastern New Mexico gas company 
to extend a four year deal that ends on April 30, 2001.  Could you look into 
the confirmation for this transaction?  They will be going to the board for 
approval at the end of next week so you have some time.  Sorry to bombard 
you!!  This one should be easy.

Thanks,

Kim

Cheryl,
 Can you please have someone get me a copy of the Valero deal that expired 
10/31/00 so that I can see how we documented that deal.  For all I know, I 
may have prepared that documentation, however, I can't find a signed document.

Dan, here is what I have found regarding the contracts we discussed yesterday:

I don't know what Marathon entity Gary Lamphier is trying to extend the term 
under, but I found the following:

There is a GTC-Sale Firm with Marathon Ashland Petroleum, LLC that expired 
9/30/00 (Contract# 96023515).  It was for Deal# 119068 at meter 1431.  The 
confirmation is in Livelink.

The last GTC-Sale Firm with Marathon Oil Company expired 9/30/98.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----

There is a GTC-Sale Firm with Valero Marketing & Supply Co. which expired 
10/31/00 (Contract# 96023503).  It was for deal #116542.  There isn't 
anything in Livelink regarding this contract/deal (which probably means that 
the File Room doesn't have anything either).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----

As for Formosa, there is a Master Purchase Sale Firm (Contract# 96000517) 
with Formosa Hydrocarbons Company, Inc. which had a primary term of 8/1/95 
thru 7/31/96 & is still on evergreen.  The confirmation is in Livelink.

There is also a Master Purchase Sale Interruptible (Contract# 96000522) with 
the same counterparty which had a primary term of 12/1/94 thru 12/31/94 & is 
still on evergreen.  There isn't anything in Livelink except the generic 
assignment from HPLR to HPLC (which probably means that there isn't anything 
else in the File Room).

There aren't any GTC's of any type in Global Contracts with Formosa.
______________________________________________________________________________
__________________________________________________________

I can print copies for you of the Marathon GTC & the Valero Master (Firm) 
from Livelink.

Please let me know what you want me to do.

Stacy,
 I am trying to assess credit for a new customer, National Gas & Oil 
Cooperative. I know that there are certain restrictions for financial trading 
with COOPs, but I am unaware if any restrictions exist for physical gas. Can 
you please let me know if there is any additional information that we need to 
obtain before granting credit to this company?

Sounds good.  We intend to bring the fixings for the burgers, that is , meat, 
onions, lettuce, tomatoes, 16 big buns and 8 small buns.  I think that mom 
has enough mustard and mayonnaise.  If you think we need more buns, let me 
know.  I don't know how many are going to show and eat.  I will leave the 
beans, potato salad, chips and desserts to you and Bettye.

Dan,

Enermetrix will be matching us up with the Buyers.  We would have the right 
to perform a credit check and turn around in 48 hours however we should know 
the counterparty before we submit a bid.  This would be for both gas and 
power.  Additionally, the agreement that I sent to you was already negotiated 
by EES and has concessions in it that can speed up the process.

Lets discuss.

Hi Dan:

Just an update to let you know the status of the agreements between Reliant
and Enovate and Enron.  They are both being routed internally prior to
execution.  However, due to the "Notices" section missing from the Enovate
contract, Legal has asked that I forward that to you for execution prior to
Reliant's execution.  I hope that this is not a problem.

Dan, I don't want this contract to get misdirected, Enron's so large and
that could easily happen.  Could you please send me your direct mailing
address so that I may send it directly to you for your further handling?
Thanks, I appreciate so much your help in getting these two agreements
completed.

YOu can either call me or email me your direct mailing address and I'll
send you the Enovate contract as soon as I receive it.

Thank you,
Ellen

Please review the language under B of Contract Price of the Transaction 
Agreement to see if it isn't sufficient to cover the concept under item 8 of 
Pasadena Usage under your term sheet.  Likewise, I have added item C under El 
Paso Capacity to cover the sale of 1456 MMBtu/d.  Please check the language 
to ascertain that everything is covered.  Have a good weekend.  I will be in 
all next week if we need to further tweak the language.

I agree, however, I will exercise my right to vote in the morning to 
hopefully ignore the long line of traffic trying to get into downtown.

I believe that the attached is ready.  I have printed 2 copies and have 
initialled those which are in my office EB3878.  Please send someone up if 
you need to sign first.  Otherwise if they are signing first, forward the 
above document to them, have them print it, sign it and forward it to ENA for 
ENA's signature.

Susan,
 Okay, I see the old contract and I know about one that is currently being 
negotiated. Is the one that I am  working on different than the one that you 
are moving the existing deals to?  Has one been assigned to HPL?

Debra & Dan,

We currently have two Master Purchase Sale Firm contracts with Reliant Energy 
Services, Inc.  The new master (96055225) is being used for all firm trading 
(including EOL), and the old master (96001135) needs to be terminated.  I 
have spoken with the counterparty about moving certain long term deals 
currently riding on the old contract over to the new contract (re-confirming 
as required), and they are agreeable.  There are 10 Nov-Mar deals also riding 
on the old master.  The terms of the old master require only 30 days written 
notice to terminate, but I would like to send a notice of termination to be 
effective on the date those ten deals expire (March 31).

I've attached the contract for review.  Does legal draft a letter, or do I?  
Please let me know how to proceed.

Thanks,
Susan

Dan,

Ann Elizabeth prepared an agreement last week whereby
Harris County MUD No. 23 would be allowed certain
access across HPL Bammel property to do work on
their drainage ditches.  After a review of the agreement
by Steve Schneider, he suggested that language be
added concerning a matting of the property over
the pipelines when "heavy machinery" is used.  Also,
he suggested that language as to property/road
restoration be added.

Taffy, can you email a copy of the agreement to Dan
so he can make these changes (I was only provided
hard copies)?

Please let me know if you have any questions!

Thank you very much,

r

Please review and give me your comments.  I have talked with Brant Reves and 
he said he is not requiring any credit provisions to be in place up front of 
this deal.  Note that the GTC gives us the option to request credit support 
during the term of the deal.

Dave,
 I have taken your word file that you forwarded to Travis McCullough and 
merged it into the Amendment that I had previously forwarded.  The only item 
that needs explanation is your comment concerning Paragraph 11.4.  The signed 
version of the contract that was provided after signature by Charlotte goes 
directly from the SDP language to paragraph 11.5.  As such I would like the 
language inserted that you indicate is already in the contract.  I agree that 
the language was in the versions prior to the final version.  Please call me 
at (713)853-6895 if you have any questions.  If not, please have PG&E sign 
two copies and forward to me.  I will have them signed by ENA and will return 
a fully executed original for your files.

Dave,
 As we discussed, the change that you made referring to the index for the 
applicable delivery point is okay because the Index for Enron Online is the 
Midpoint price in Gas Daily for the location closet to the relevant delivery 
point.  I do not think that your change affects that.  Therefore, please 
finalize the amendment, have it signed and forward to me for execution by 
Enron.

Paul,
 Please check with your counterparty at Reliant for the full name of the 
Reliant Energy entity.  Is it Reliant Energy Gas Resources Corp. or some 
other name?  I am still confused about the fuel component of the volume.  We 
probably need to expand on the language in the prior draft to specify the 
fuel volume for the movement of the gas from the Delivery Point to 
___________________.   Have the attached documents been sent to Reliant 
Energy and if so have we received any comments from them?  I will draft a 
Transaction Agreement for the latest deal that will be similar to the prior 
deal.

Christian,
 I have made the change to Section 8.8 as requested in the attached contract 
document.  You are correct about the second item, it is intended that the 
Purchase Order Number be a part of the address to be included on any invoice 
that is issued to the company.  This is absolutely the only way that we have 
to include the Purchase Order Number on any statements.  Therefore, i have 
not removed that line from the address,  At such time as the Purchase Order 
Number is available, please send a revised address notice to the company 
containing such number.  Until that happens, it will be understood that no 
number has been provided.  Please call if you have any questions.

Mr. Hyvl,

I just now had a chance to make a final review of the contract and noticed a
couple of items:

1.  Section 8.8. Confidentiality (page 5)

"and wire instructions" was inserted in the wrong place.  Could you change
it to read:  "The provisions of the Agreement, other than the terms of any
Transaction and wire instructions, are not subject to this confidentiality
obligation."

2.  Exhibit "A"  Customer Invoices

Under the address for CPS invoices, you inserted "Purchase Order Number
_________."  Since we do not know at this time what the purchase order
number will be, could we delete this.  Otherwise, it looks as if the
purchase order number is supposed to be part of the address.

If you have any questions, please feel free to call me at (210)353-3725.
Thanks ...

Ellen,
 Attached please find a GTC confirm that I prepared for the requested deal 
done by Janet Wallis.  Please call if you have any questions.  I have asked 
Janet to forward to New Gulf if the GTC correctly reflects her transaction.  
I will notify you if there are any changes.

I have reviewed the above proposed confidentiality agreement and have made 
certain modifications which are in line with the confidentiality agreement 
presently in effect between ENA and Markwest.  Since the new agreement is to 
cover Markwest for the period that they are letting Enron review Markwest's 
financials which are scheduled to be publicly released next week, the term 
references therein need to only cover the period from the date hereof until 
such financials are scheduled to be released, which I understand to be next 
week.  The change to Enron Corp was made because the employees who will 
receive the information are now employees of Enron Corp.   Please have your 
attorney contact me if there are any problems with the manner or substance of 
the changes noted in the document.

It wasn't too bad.  The phone company sent out a repairman Saturday morning 
and that is how I found out about all of the flooding because we had less 
than normal water accumulation from the rain Friday night.  Lots of sunshine 
Saturday afternoon and most of the day Sunday.  I spent some time shopping at 
Sam's Saturday and Haley and I cleaned my back room of the garage Sunday 
afternoon.  I notice that the bikini car wash is still operating.  They were 
out Friday afternoon when I went home about 5:30 just a few minutes before it 
started raining at the house, of course it rained hard on me most of the way 
home till I got about a mile from the house.  I also noticed them out 
yesterday, however, I think they may have aged.  Are you sure that James 
doesn't have an opening for them.  They seem to be hard workers, at least 
they go through the motions.

Regarding the January 1, 1998 GISB and the April 1, 1998 GISB, the January 1, 
1998 agreement appears to be a better fit for trading matters which could 
extend beyond one month.  I assume that this was assigned to ENA.

Barbara & Anne,
 I spoke with Joe Defner this morning and  he reconfirmed that we only needed 
to provide him with a list of the ENA contracts that were being transferred 
to HPL or Newco.  If any of these contracts are involved in a monetization, 
the preferred solution would be for Enron Corp. to indemnify the lender for 
the lost of any revenues attributable to such contract.  Therefore, 
transferring ENA contracts to HPL or Newco should not be an issue, however, 
Joe would like as much up front notice as possible.

Susan, 
 That is correct.  If ENA wants to trade with Coral, It will need to use its 
Firm GTC and document accordingly until a new contract is negotiated with 
Coral.

Hi Dan,

I have a copy of a letter dated 8/2/99 from ECT to Coral Energy Resources, 
L.P. assigning the referenced contract to Houston Pipe Line Company.  The 
assignment was never made in Global Contracts.

If you agree that it should have been assigned, as the letter says, I will 
assign it today.  If I do assign it, Coral will no longer have a firm master 
contract for trading.  I will also have to remove it from EOL.

Please advise at your earliest convenience.

Thanks!
Susan

Brant,
 EnergyOne has responded to the requested changes.  They agree to the 
revision of the MAC language but threw in a money wrench by adding a warm and 
fuzzy triggering event  if a party refused to provide security within 48 
hours of a reasonable request therefore.  No standard is provided as to the 
reason for the request.    They also deleted the original Collateral 
Threshold language which was in their first draft.  Please respond to these 
matters to me and to Sylvia Pollan.

Bob Bruce has set up a meeting with Ken Raceler to go over the changes that 
went into effect 12/21 of last year.  They will meet on March 5th from 1 to 3 
p.m. at the Hyatt Regency - Sandelwood Room A.  He says that eventhough they 
are trying to keep the group small it makes sense that you and I attend.  He 
did say that space was not a problem.  I told him that you and I did want to 
attend if for no other reason than to find out about the gray areas that we 
still need to be watchful of.  i.e. who is an "eligible contract participant" 
under the revised law.  What representations need ot be made, if any, by the

Dave,
 Spoke with credit and they are permitting us to go forward without adding 
credit provisions.  In reviewing your email, are both of the existing deals 
being modified for the period Feb  through July.  your chart says half for 
each deal.  I will do a new GTC confirm that terminates the old and rolls the 
old volumes and new pricing for the period FEb 01 through Jan O2.  Please 
give me a call (713) 853-6895.

That's great Dan, the extension is actually only 6 months (Aug 01 - Jan 02).  
Also, can we make it an "ammendment" to the existing deal?

DAve,
 Once you decide which way you would like to go, We will issue a new 
Confirmation Letter which will cancel the two previous confirmation letters 
effective as of February 1, 2001.  Because the term extends some 17 months, 
we will require them to sign the confirmation letter with attached GTC.  Let 
me know, and I will generate.

I have a proposed restructuring transaction with City of Mesa, Arizona.  It 
works like this:

1) Half their volume is currently priced at 3.74 (fixed, physical deal with 
us)
2) That deal runs through July 01
3) I want to reprice that deal at a higher price and use that equity to 
finance a discount to index for an extra six months.
4) They will do one of two transactions (shown below) one extends half the 
volume one extends the full volume.


       

I need help with a couple of things:

1) Since they canceled their Enfolio Agmt. can I get a contract from legal 
that will allow us to transact without it.
2) How do we get this deal in Mike's book and the risk system

Thanks,

Dave Fuller

Please review the attached revised document.  I left the references to 
Louisiana in the document because of all the changes to section numbers and 
exhibits that deletion of that section would cause.  At some time in the 
future, I will modify to delete, but it should be okay with the references 
left in for the time being.  Additionally, I suspect that we may need to 
leave it in because we may need to generate a version for the LEG system that 
AEP has in Louisiana.  Let me know if you think we need any other changes.

Pontchartrain Natural Gas System and Calcasieu Gas Gathering System.  Please 
review them and let me know if there are any comments or questions.  The one 
comment I'll make is that we are unsure of our comfort with the dollar amount

Janet,
 I have reviewed the attached contract and it gives me a lot of concern.  
First brush, it is one sided in their favor and offers us no breakage 
protection.  Specifically, 
 Section 4.4 --- HPL should be the confirming party.
 Section 4.5 --- HPl also needs to have the right to call for security.  
Clause should be balanced.
 Section 5.5a -- "its best efforts" should be changed to "commercially 
reasonable efforts".
 Sections 5.8 & 5.9 --  Need clauses addressing "undertakes by Buyer" and 
"overtakes by Buyer".  
 Section 6.3b --  20 days should be changed to 15 days in each location in 
this section.
 Section 6.4 ---  Needs a lot of explanation.  Why is it here?  Why would we 
agree to such?
 Article 10 - Force Majeure -  Need to add Enron language as to items which 
are not force majeure.
 Article 11 - Default -  Need to add additional Triggering Events, Early 
Termination, and Termination Damage provisions.
 Also, need to add provisions for limitation of liability and waiver of 
consequential damages.

 Let me know how you would like to proceed.  I do not think that they will 
agree to make any of the changes we would need to do the deal.  Would they be 
willing to contract using the GISB form of agreement?

See attached contract below.  Ignore 4.1 and 4.2, those will have to be 
changed.  Also, keep an eye
out in 4.4 - the default language for confirmations; 10.2 - the Force Majeure 
language; 18.2 - 3 rd party beneficiary; and 10.4 - transportion is not (?) 
subject
to force Majeure?

Thanks,

Janet,

Attached is our "standard" gas enabling agreement that we plan to use with
Enron.  It is the same agreement we put in place last year when Enron did
not submit a bid.

If you will provide proper corporate / address information for Enron we will
generate an original contract.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Kim,
 The response to III P. should be Not Applicable, unless you are having 
someone obtain a Certificate of Good Standing from the State of California.  
 The response to III Q. should be that the Final Contract and Transaction 
Agreement will be signed by a Vice President of Enron North America Corp. and 
as agreed with the City's counsel, a Certificate of Incumbency shall be 
provided to verify that the person signing is an officer of the Company.
 The remainder of the document appears okay.  I was curious as to how you 
were going to respond to their statement regarding their potential purchase 
of interstate transportation assets and their request that we manage these 
assets for them.  Repricing should work.

 Call me if you have any further questions.

So you do check your mail.  Yes, I am doing this.  I ordered my equipment 
yesterday.  I went with the Advanced Desktop.  The difference was $333.  I 
also paid for additional upgrades of speed and memory.  Call me if you want

 Kim Ward asked me to forward the attached general terms and conditions to 
you for your review.  These general terms and conditions are used in 
conjunction with a Confirmation Agreement which would be signed by both 
parties.  The Confirmation Letter sets forth the volumes, delivery point, 
price terms which are to be applicable for the gas to be sold pursuant to the 
general terms and conditions.

Dan,

Today, I entered into some conversations with the City of Palo Alto regarding 
fixing forward gas prices for them.  They have a copy of a Master agreement 
and a copy of an ISDA which are currently in their legal department.  They 
have requested a copy of the GTC language which would allow us to transact in 
the immediate future, although I am still pushing for a Master.  They 
currently have a Power Master in place with EPMI.  

Could you forward a copy of the General Terms and Conditions to Monica 
Padilla with the City of Palo Alto at Monica_Padilla@city.palo-alto.ca.us 
first thing in the morning?  Please let me know if you have any questions or 
issues.

Thanks,

Please send hard copy of deal ticket.  We do not have access.  Otherwise, I 
think the worksheet is incomplete.  Please complete and include with hard 
copy of deal ticket.  Has the counterparty requested an Enron Corp guaranty 
as a condition of doing the deal?

FEMALE FLYERS

As the airliner pushed back from the gate, the flight attendant gave the 
passergers the usual information regarding seat belts etc. Finally, she said, 
"Now sit back and enjoy your trip while your captain, Judith Campbell and 
crew take you safely to your destination."?

Joe sitting in the 8th row thought to himself, "Did hear her right; is the 
captain a woman? I think I better have scotch and soda. When the attendants 
came by with drink cart, he said, "Did I understand you right?  Is the 
captain a woman?"

"Yes," said the attendant, "In fact, this entire crew is female."

"My God," said Joe, "I'd better have two scotch and sodas. I don't know what 
to think of all those women up there in the cockpit."

"That's another thing," said the attendant, "We no longer call it the 
cockpit."

Charlotte,
 Please explain what you are referring to when you state that Article 12.7 
was omitted by accident.  My copy of the signed agreement has 12.7.  I am 
attaching the proposed Amendment for your review and comments.   I added the 
Gas Daily Midpoint Price to  be used as a default index when a index was not 
specified and for online transactions.  Please review and let me have your 
comments,  if okay, please start the execution process and forward 2 to me 
for signature by ENA.

Grant,
 The problem is that they do not want to assign the agreement.  They want to 
do a partial assignment which is unacceptable unless we can severe the 
document so that we have two separate stand alone pieces of paper after the 
assignment.  Talk to them about doing two Spot Confirmations, one for 0 to 
8,400 MMBtu per day which would not be assignable, and the other one for 0 to 
11,600 MMBtu per day which would be assignable to BP.  Call me so that we can 
discuss.

I am waiting on your response to my voice mail regarding the assignment to 
BP.  Shouldn't we break the confirm into two documents, covering 42% of the 
entitlements to Crestar and 58% to BP.

There appears to be a typo in the amount due HPL from Upstream.  It should be 
$238,508.61.  I will withhold this amount on the 25th.

Subject: Re: Upstream Energy Services Cio, L.L.C.  

Brian Riley contacted me regarding the subject company and the fact that HPL 
had overpaid them to the tune of $328,508.61(should be $238,508.61) and would 
it be appropriate for HPL to withhold that amount from the next payment being 
sent to Upstream.  The documentation that has been provided to me shows that 
this amount relates to overpayments made in 1997 and early 1998.  The 1997 
payments were made pursuant to a spot contract and that they had confirmed a 
nomination of 500 a day however, Killam Oil Company, the operator of the 
wells, has made a reallocation of volumes from these wells from the parties 
that Upstream represents to Enron Oil and Gas Company.  The information 
provided does not indicate when Killam made the reallocation.  Based on the 
reallocation, HPL or its predecessor has paid Upstream for 97,384 MMBtu that 
has now been allocated to EOG.  I am told that Upstream has not denied its 
responsibility for repaying the money, only that it needed time to collect 
the money from the parties that it represents.  Upstream's attorney, Ty Kelly 
written correspondence indicates that the Spot contract was not complete 
because it did not provide a document evidencing the delivery point and 
volumes.  That contract provides that the remittance advice serves as the 
confirmation evidencing the transaction.  He also stated that the volumes 
should have been sold to HPL under the Big Cowboy agreement which they did 
not have a copy of.  Brian Riley has indicated that the purchase price was 
the same under the Big Cowboy and the Spot contract.  Kelly also indicated 
that since HPL's agreements routinely provide for arbitration, the issue 
should be resolved through arbitration.

Based on my review of the information available, HPL should withhold the sum 
of $328,508.61(should be $238,508.61) from the next payment to be made to 
Upstream and hold such sum in suspense until the issue is resolved.  HPL 
needs to be aware that in the event it is not able to prevail on its claim 
for such sum, it will need to remit such amount together with interest to 
Upstream.

Clement, attached is a guaranty draft from Enterprise Products Operating, LP 
who is providing a guaranty to cover two new potential EOL counterparties, 
Pontchartrain Natural Gas System and Calcasieu Gas Gathering System.  Please 
review them and let me know if there are any comments or questions.  The one 
comment I'll make is that we are unsure of our comfort with the dollar amount 
that they propose, but everything else is probably OK.  I can be reached at
