Based on my knowledge of Ga market, C&I have been more satisfied than RES customers, however the "billing" problems that have been talked about in Ga were across all classes.  RES customers had never been accustomed to disconnects for Non payment before.

This story appears to be about residential.  

Do we know if C&I has feared so poorly?  What are the problems with entering the market for those customers?  Have these customers been angry or pleased?

Gas deregulation: unfulfilled promises It was meant to foster competition, lower bills and improve customer service for Georgians. It hasn't. 
MATTHEW C. QUINN 
STAFF

(Copyright, The Atlanta Journal and Constitution - 2001) 

Three years after Georgia deregulated natural gas, there's widespread sentiment the landmark law has failed to live up to its promise and needs to be fixed. 

When the state allowed unregulated marketing companies to sell natural gas to 1.5 million homes and businesses, the goal was to drive prices down and improve service. 

Instead, here's what resulted: A relentless wave of billing errors, confusion and customer service complaints. Residential gas prices that remained high even as wholesale prices plunged. Tens of thousands of customers whose service was disconnected for nonpayment of bills dating to last winter's record cold. Marketing companies saddled with millions of dollars in debt resulting from unpaid bills. Three marketers have gone bankrupt, reducing competition. Some survivors appear to be barely hanging on.

The situation is so strained that players on virtually all sides of the debate now agree that deregulation has gone very wrong. No easy fixes are at hand.

"No responsible executive in the world would have ever subjected customers to what they've had to go through," said Paula G. Rosput, chief executive of AGL Resources, parent of Atlanta Gas Light Co., which pushed the Legislature to enact deregulation in 1997 and remains a monopoly distributor of gas sold by marketers.

Rosput, who joined the company in 1998 when deregulation was already under way, now says that deregulating natural gas in Georgia was probably "swimming against the tide."

Georgia's relatively short heating season offers limited opportunity for profit, she said. Rosput faults the Public Service Commission for meddling and the marketers for lacking the expertise to do the job properly.

"There's plenty of blame to go around here," she said, noting that "never in the history of Georgia" has the gap between wholesale and retail prices been so wide.

Gov. Roy Barnes has stepped into the morass. He plans to name a consumer protection task force to come up with solutions before the Legislature convenes in January. Barnes said deregulation has been good for many industrial and business customers, but he has "profound concerns" about the impact on consumers.

Barnes said he's not out to scrap deregulation. That's a problematic option that nonetheless is expected to be discussed by the task force and the Legislature, along with more limited steps to prop up the existing system with consumer protection measures.

The most immediate problem is households without gas as winter cold sets in. According to Atlanta Gas Light, more than 50,000 consumers who were shut off for nonpayment have still not been reconnected.

The top marketers are insisting that balances be paid in full before service is restored, except in certain hardship cases.

The PSC has allocated $10 million to help low-income senior citizens pay their bills, and the federal government has kicked in $15 million for low-income families --- but those measures will help only a small fraction of consumers. 

As a result, social services agencies are overwhelmed with pleas for help from gas customers. The Sullivan Center, a southwest Atlanta nonprofit, is holding weekly classes to help advise people having trouble paying their bills.

Many of them haven't paid since last winter's frigid temperatures sent bills soaring in Georgia and across the country. 

The PSC responded in January by slapping a moratorium on shut- offs --- but that actually may have exacerbated the situation in the long term. When the moratorium expired in April, more than 220,000 customers were targeted for disconnection, and marketers were stuck with a reported $100 million in bad debt. Since then, 142,000 homes and businesses have been shut off; 87,500 of those were reconnected after paying their bills.

Nancy D. Coveny, executive director of Buckhead Christian Ministry, which offers assistance to low-income residents, said deregulation has made it more difficult to help people straighten out their accounts because of the multitude of marketers and policies. Before deregulation, "it was a lot easier" to straighten out problems, Coveny said. "We would call Atlanta Gas Light. We had relationships."

High prices

Jessie Champion, 54, of southwest Atlanta, said she had her gas cut off after failing to pay a $2,081 bill dating back months.

Champion said she had been making budget billing payments to Georgia Natural Gas Services, the state's top marketer and an affiliate of Atlanta Gas Light, and was told by the company that "the computer messed up." She's been using an electric heater for her household, which includes three grandchildren and a disabled son. 

Catherine Land-Waters, vice president/customer service at Georgia Natural Gas, said Champion's service was shut off after she failed to keep up with her payments. She said the company has no record of a disability claimed by Champion but added that the company will work with her to get her service restored.

Denise McGregory of Norcross had her gas shut off two weeks ago after confusion over bills from two marketers for two apartments she briefly had during a move. She said Infinite Energy turned off her gas, even though she sent a check. Service was restored two days later, but only after she "yelled and screamed" and complained to the PSC. "I have to have gas," she said. "I have seven children." 

Dave Benfield, a spokesman for Infinite, said McGregory had been notified that she faced disconnection. The small, Florida-based marketer approved her account for reconnection the same day it received payment.

"If people don't pay us in 45 days, they get a notice," Benfield said. "In most cases they pay."

The PSC has logged more than 12,000 complaints about natural gas service since January over such things as pricing, billing inaccuracies, disconnection notices sent in error and demands for payment of hefty overdue balances. That dwarfs the number of complaints the PSC gets about electricity and telecommunications.

"People aren't being treated right," says PSC member Stan Wise, a supporter of deregulation who wants to save the system. 

Marketers say many billing problems have been straightened out, and complaints to the PSC have tapered off.

What remains a major concern for virtually everyone involved is the price consumers are paying for natural gas. When the wholesale price of gas dropped substantially in recent months, residential prices charged by marketers remained high. Last week, wholesale prices shot up 75 percent in advance of cold weather but are still much lower than last year.

Marketers say prices have remained high in part because of bad debt they are carrying from nonpaying customers. The PSC is expected to launch an inquiry this week into whether bad debt is the reason retail and wholesale prices have been out of synch. 

It's not clear "how much is bad debt and how much is marketers taking advantage of the situation," said state Consumer Utility Counsel Kristy Holley.

Reeling from bad debt

Residential consumers enjoyed rebates and lower prices at the outset of deregulation. Those who locked in fixed prices benefited when prices shot up last winter and their gas costs did not.

But relatively few customers opted for a fixed price, which was not heavily promoted as an option. 

A recent analysis by the PSC staff shows typical monthly residential gas bills between April and September have been higher than those in neighboring states with regulated utilities. The average September bill for customers served by Georgia marketers was $37.12, compared with an average of $27.03 for six regulated utilities in nearby states. Even the lowest Georgia bill was higher than the regulated average.

But the Georgia bill includes marketer charges for natural gas and customer service, plus Atlanta Gas Light's distribution charges. PSC member Robert Baker says AGL's charges, which account for 40 percent of typical bills, may be partly to blame for high bills.

On the basis of a PSC staff finding that the utility has been earning up to $52.5 million a year above what's authorized, the commission has launched an earnings review that could lead to reduced rates. AGL, meanwhile, claims it's entitled to a rate increase of up to $48 million.

With the exception of large industrial customers that had distribution costs slashed and got more leeway to shop for gas from competing wholesale suppliers, it's hard to find anyone who gives deregulation high marks.

Marketers flocked to Georgia with hopes of getting in on the ground floor of an expanding national deregulated business for electricity and natural gas. What was supposed to be Georgia's gradual transition to an exciting new market with lower prices and superior customer service moved faster than anyone predicted. That touched off an array of billing problems and errors. When unusually cold weather hit last winter and prices skyrocketed, many consumers, already angered by the billing problems, blamed deregulation --- and didn't pay their bills. 

While those problems were evolving in Georgia, California had its electricity implosion. Many marketers had based their investment in Georgia on an expectation they'd recoup by expanding into other markets and offer new services, including electricity and telecommunications. But the California debacle dashed hopes for a national deregulated market for natural gas and electricity. "California did for electricity deregulation what Three Mile Island did for nuclear power," said Warren Darby, retired senior vice president of Scana Energy and now a consultant in Columbia, S.C.

When Georgia's moratorium on shut-offs expired in April, marketers found themselves reeling from an estimated $100 million in bad debt. Instead of building market share, they had to focus on disconnecting nonpaying customers.

"You went from an invasion to an occupation mentality," Darby said.

Shell Energy, an affiliate of Shell Oil Co., recently aborted its entry into the newly deregulated electricity market in its home state of Texas. The crash program by Georgia's No. 3 marketer to recoup bad debt by disconnecting nonpaying customers in the state has triggered an outpouring of complaints. Darby said Shell is "circling the wagons."

Shell Energy President Alan Raymond concedes that Georgia "has not been an exciting profit picture for us," but he insists his company has no plans to pull out. He added, however: "Unless things get better, no company can survive this."

Georgia Natural Gas Services, the state's top marketer, has been one big headache for AGL Resources, its parent, which recently took a $13.5 million pretax charge related to accounting discrepancies at the marketing affiliate and is engaged in messy litigation with a minority partner. "It's not been a good business for us," said Rosput of AGL.

No. 2 marketer Scana Energy has reported $4 million in profit from its Georgia operations so far this year, or about $1 per month per customer after accounting for bad debt. The South Carolina-based company had hoped to sell its Georgia customers wireless telephone and home security services but has gotten out of both businesses. The company says it's in for the long term.

New Power Co. made a late and aggressive entry into Georgia's natural gas market this year as part of a national push into deregulated gas and electricity markets. Wall Street didn't like the idea. The company's stock has plunged from $21 a year ago to less than $1. Its top financial backer, Enron Corp., last month wrote down about $270 million of its investment. But New Power President Eugene Lockhart insists Georgia is profitable for the company and that it's not planning to pull out.

Still, there's concern about the impact on competition if Shell or New Power quits. The PSC has designated New Power as emergency backup supplier if another company goes out of business. 

The ranks of marketers has already thinned from 19 three years ago to eight. The top four control 94 percent of the market.

PSC member Baker already sees an "oligopoly" with limited competition. Consumer choice "is supposed to be the hallmark" of deregulation, said Commissioner David Burgess. Instead, he said, "consumers have less and less."

'Re-regulation' calls

So far, no one has come forward with a solution to the deregulation problems. 

Calls for "re-regulation" are expected to grow when the General Assembly convenes in January. Already, a key backer of the 1997 deregulation law has jumped ship.

"We can't let Georgia consumers suffer for another year," said state Sen. Sonny Perdue of Bonaire, who said he will introduce legislation to re-regulate natural gas. Perdue, the main Senate sponsor of the 1997 deregulation law, is expected this week to announce his candidacy for the Republican nomination for governor. He would oppose Barnes. 

State Rep. Jimmy Skipper (D-Americus), the main House sponsor of the '97 law, said he's concerned about gas prices, but he's not sure re-regulation is "doable at this point."

Marketers are pressing for more time to give deregulation a chance. 

"We believe a year from now, weather permitting, that this will be a much calmer market and people will value the choices they have," saId Scana spokeswoman Cathy Love.

Returning to regulated natural gas would present a whole new host of problems, including dilemma No. 1: "If it's re-regulated, who takes the ball?" says PSC Chairman Lauren "Bubba" McDonald Jr.

Returning Atlanta Gas Light to the role of regulated utility would require the very expensive proposition of reconstructing billing and customer service systems for 1.5 million customers, which was turned over to marketers.

Then there's the question of whether marketers would be entitled to a "bailout" to recover their costs if forced from the market Georgia invited them into. 

One option being discussed is to have Atlanta Gas Light --- or even a marketer --- offer a regulated gas service alongside unregulated marketers. That would make Georgia more like other states that have deregulated.

Other measures could include new standards for billing, customer service and meter reading; more authority for the PSC, including emergency power to regulate prices; reducing the sales tax for gas bills; and increasing competition by allowing nonprofit electric cooperatives to become gas marketers.

But there are significant problems associated with every option that has been floated for "fixing" deregulation. In fact, there may be no good fix.

Rosput said she's "prepared to get to a solution," but like everyone else, she doesn't have an answer.

"It is my job to do the best I can to guide this ship," she said, "and there's no safe shore or good place to land."

Below is a rough estimate of the book impact if ComEd succeeds in ending PPO 
early.  That is, if they terminate PPO starting Jan. 2005 it should cost us 
$1.2m, if they want to terminate Jan. 2004 it would be an impact of $3.1m 
($1.2m for 2005 + $1.9m for 2004), etc.



These costs can be reduced with a liquid market for wholesale power and 
ancillary services.

Let's discuss our suggested changes.

Subject: Com Ed

Last week, Sue and I, along with Phil O'Connor of New Energy met with Frank 
Clark ( Senior V.P. Exelon - Government Affairs, etc) and Arlene Juracek 
(V.P. Rates and Tariffs).  Sue and I also met with Commissioners Hurley and 
Harvill.

Information Gleaned From the Meeting:

1.  Com Ed does not think price volatility will be acceptable to the 
residential customers and wants to create a structured rate.  They are not 
open to any alternative that causes them to lose money.
2.  They will file a rate case in 2004 to be effective in 2005.  They are not 
sure the statute requires them to file an MVI plus 10% at the end of the PPO 
period and need to study the statutory requirements.  Their preference is to 
initiate performanced based ratemaking instead for bundled rates.
3.  Com Ed's view is that the energy situation is a  national problem.  Com 
Ed wants to be protected through its commodity price.
4.  Com Ed does not want the obligation to serve industrial customers and on 
a longer term basis, would like to shed its obligation to serve residential.
5.  Com Ed has arbitrarily defined mass market as 400kw or less and has 
therefore lumped these commercial customers in with their residential, 
however, they are open to separating them out.
6.  Com Ed does not want the legislation reopened which may provide us with 
some leverage.

At the conclusion of the meeting it was decided to start an open forum 
process to get ideas on the table.  Com Ed is shying away from any formal 
process.  Their concern seems to be that they do not want to take the 
political heat for high prices and volatility and would rather give up its 
default customer service obligations.

Possible Deal Opportunities:

1.  Either through negotiations (preferred choice) or through competitive 
bidding, become the default service provider for some or all of Com Ed's 
industrial customers.  This would allow us to upsell additional products to 
the industrial class.
2.  Segregate the commercial customers (100 - 400 Kw) customers from the 
residential customers and negotiate to become the default service provider.
3.  Joint venture between ENA and New Power to be the default service 
provider for portions of the residential class through an opt-out program 
like municipal aggregation or some other format.

Next Steps:

1.  Mark Ulrich is to complete an analysis of the Com Ed proposal in terms of 
its impact on our current book of business
2.   Develop a position boiled down to just a few key points that we can push 
with regulators and Com Ed.  In a conference call with Harry, Mark, Roy, Sue 
and me, we have tentatively distilled the list to the following:
 a.  Default deal for industrial customers
 b.  Negotiate for Com Ed to provide load following and balancing
 c.  Default deal for commercial as opposed to PBR

Colleagues:

Please find below the first glimpse of the plan to update, and review, the 
largest 50 curves; they represent 75% of URM exposure.  I am confident of 
your cooperation and support; both are absolutely essential to complete this 
ambitious schedule on time  (the process will start on April 23rd and 
conclude by May 25th, 2001).

Stella, Pat and I are currently working on streamlining the regulatory inputs 
required from you  in a faster, and more cost-effective manner.  We are also 
working on ensuring that documentation will be compiled in a very user 
friendly database (with the help/support of Elizabeth it shall be on the 
intranet) that will make the process next time a cinch, and provide the 
required inputs for your suggested strategy for the curve/utility when the 
time comes (it is the second stage of the process).   

Stella, Pat and I shall seek your permission for an appropriate time this 
coming week to discuss the details of the plan and take stock of your 
comments and suggestions.  

Best regards

This story appears to be about residential.  

Do we know if C&I has feared so poorly?  What are the problems with entering the market for those customers?  Have these customers been angry or pleased?

Subject:	GA Gas: Did Deregulation Work?

Gas deregulation: unfulfilled promises It was meant to foster competition, lower bills and improve customer service for Georgians. It hasn't.

Three years after Georgia deregulated natural gas, there's widespread sentiment the landmark law has failed to live up to its promise and needs to be fixed. 

When the state allowed unregulated marketing companies to sell natural gas to 1.5 million homes and businesses, the goal was to drive prices down and improve service. 

Instead, here's what resulted: A relentless wave of billing errors, confusion and customer service complaints. Residential gas prices that remained high even as wholesale prices plunged. Tens of thousands of customers whose service was disconnected for nonpayment of bills dating to last winter's record cold. Marketing companies saddled with millions of dollars in debt resulting from unpaid bills. Three marketers have gone bankrupt, reducing competition. Some survivors appear to be barely hanging on.

The situation is so strained that players on virtually all sides of the debate now agree that deregulation has gone very wrong. No easy fixes are at hand.

"No responsible executive in the world would have ever subjected customers to what they've had to go through," said Paula G. Rosput, chief executive of AGL Resources, parent of Atlanta Gas Light Co., which pushed the Legislature to enact deregulation in 1997 and remains a monopoly distributor of gas sold by marketers.

Rosput, who joined the company in 1998 when deregulation was already under way, now says that deregulating natural gas in Georgia was probably "swimming against the tide."

Georgia's relatively short heating season offers limited opportunity for profit, she said. Rosput faults the Public Service Commission for meddling and the marketers for lacking the expertise to do the job properly.

"There's plenty of blame to go around here," she said, noting that "never in the history of Georgia" has the gap between wholesale and retail prices been so wide.

Gov. Roy Barnes has stepped into the morass. He plans to name a consumer protection task force to come up with solutions before the Legislature convenes in January. Barnes said deregulation has been good for many industrial and business customers, but he has "profound concerns" about the impact on consumers.

Barnes said he's not out to scrap deregulation. That's a problematic option that nonetheless is expected to be discussed by the task force and the Legislature, along with more limited steps to prop up the existing system with consumer protection measures.

The most immediate problem is households without gas as winter cold sets in. According to Atlanta Gas Light, more than 50,000 consumers who were shut off for nonpayment have still not been reconnected.

The top marketers are insisting that balances be paid in full before service is restored, except in certain hardship cases.

The PSC has allocated $10 million to help low-income senior citizens pay their bills, and the federal government has kicked in $15 million for low-income families --- but those measures will help only a small fraction of consumers. 

As a result, social services agencies are overwhelmed with pleas for help from gas customers. The Sullivan Center, a southwest Atlanta nonprofit, is holding weekly classes to help advise people having trouble paying their bills.

Many of them haven't paid since last winter's frigid temperatures sent bills soaring in Georgia and across the country. 

The PSC responded in January by slapping a moratorium on shut- offs --- but that actually may have exacerbated the situation in the long term. When the moratorium expired in April, more than 220,000 customers were targeted for disconnection, and marketers were stuck with a reported $100 million in bad debt. Since then, 142,000 homes and businesses have been shut off; 87,500 of those were reconnected after paying their bills.

Nancy D. Coveny, executive director of Buckhead Christian Ministry, which offers assistance to low-income residents, said deregulation has made it more difficult to help people straighten out their accounts because of the multitude of marketers and policies. Before deregulation, "it was a lot easier" to straighten out problems, Coveny said. "We would call Atlanta Gas Light. We had relationships."

High prices

Jessie Champion, 54, of southwest Atlanta, said she had her gas cut off after failing to pay a $2,081 bill dating back months.

Champion said she had been making budget billing payments to Georgia Natural Gas Services, the state's top marketer and an affiliate of Atlanta Gas Light, and was told by the company that "the computer messed up." She's been using an electric heater for her household, which includes three grandchildren and a disabled son. 

Catherine Land-Waters, vice president/customer service at Georgia Natural Gas, said Champion's service was shut off after she failed to keep up with her payments. She said the company has no record of a disability claimed by Champion but added that the company will work with her to get her service restored.

Denise McGregory of Norcross had her gas shut off two weeks ago after confusion over bills from two marketers for two apartments she briefly had during a move. She said Infinite Energy turned off her gas, even though she sent a check. Service was restored two days later, but only after she "yelled and screamed" and complained to the PSC. "I have to have gas," she said. "I have seven children." 

Dave Benfield, a spokesman for Infinite, said McGregory had been notified that she faced disconnection. The small, Florida-based marketer approved her account for reconnection the same day it received payment.

"If people don't pay us in 45 days, they get a notice," Benfield said. "In most cases they pay."

The PSC has logged more than 12,000 complaints about natural gas service since January over such things as pricing, billing inaccuracies, disconnection notices sent in error and demands for payment of hefty overdue balances. That dwarfs the number of complaints the PSC gets about electricity and telecommunications.

"People aren't being treated right," says PSC member Stan Wise, a supporter of deregulation who wants to save the system. 

Marketers say many billing problems have been straightened out, and complaints to the PSC have tapered off.

What remains a major concern for virtually everyone involved is the price consumers are paying for natural gas. When the wholesale price of gas dropped substantially in recent months, residential prices charged by marketers remained high. Last week, wholesale prices shot up 75 percent in advance of cold weather but are still much lower than last year.

Marketers say prices have remained high in part because of bad debt they are carrying from nonpaying customers. The PSC is expected to launch an inquiry this week into whether bad debt is the reason retail and wholesale prices have been out of synch. 

It's not clear "how much is bad debt and how much is marketers taking advantage of the situation," said state Consumer Utility Counsel Kristy Holley.

Reeling from bad debt

Residential consumers enjoyed rebates and lower prices at the outset of deregulation. Those who locked in fixed prices benefited when prices shot up last winter and their gas costs did not.

But relatively few customers opted for a fixed price, which was not heavily promoted as an option. 

A recent analysis by the PSC staff shows typical monthly residential gas bills between April and September have been higher than those in neighboring states with regulated utilities. The average September bill for customers served by Georgia marketers was $37.12, compared with an average of $27.03 for six regulated utilities in nearby states. Even the lowest Georgia bill was higher than the regulated average.

But the Georgia bill includes marketer charges for natural gas and customer service, plus Atlanta Gas Light's distribution charges. PSC member Robert Baker says AGL's charges, which account for 40 percent of typical bills, may be partly to blame for high bills.

On the basis of a PSC staff finding that the utility has been earning up to $52.5 million a year above what's authorized, the commission has launched an earnings review that could lead to reduced rates. AGL, meanwhile, claims it's entitled to a rate increase of up to $48 million.

With the exception of large industrial customers that had distribution costs slashed and got more leeway to shop for gas from competing wholesale suppliers, it's hard to find anyone who gives deregulation high marks.

Marketers flocked to Georgia with hopes of getting in on the ground floor of an expanding national deregulated business for electricity and natural gas. What was supposed to be Georgia's gradual transition to an exciting new market with lower prices and superior customer service moved faster than anyone predicted. That touched off an array of billing problems and errors. When unusually cold weather hit last winter and prices skyrocketed, many consumers, already angered by the billing problems, blamed deregulation --- and didn't pay their bills. 

While those problems were evolving in Georgia, California had its electricity implosion. Many marketers had based their investment in Georgia on an expectation they'd recoup by expanding into other markets and offer new services, including electricity and telecommunications. But the California debacle dashed hopes for a national deregulated market for natural gas and electricity. "California did for electricity deregulation what Three Mile Island did for nuclear power," said Warren Darby, retired senior vice president of Scana Energy and now a consultant in Columbia, S.C.

When Georgia's moratorium on shut-offs expired in April, marketers found themselves reeling from an estimated $100 million in bad debt. Instead of building market share, they had to focus on disconnecting nonpaying customers.

"You went from an invasion to an occupation mentality," Darby said.

Shell Energy, an affiliate of Shell Oil Co., recently aborted its entry into the newly deregulated electricity market in its home state of Texas. The crash program by Georgia's No. 3 marketer to recoup bad debt by disconnecting nonpaying customers in the state has triggered an outpouring of complaints. Darby said Shell is "circling the wagons."

Shell Energy President Alan Raymond concedes that Georgia "has not been an exciting profit picture for us," but he insists his company has no plans to pull out. He added, however: "Unless things get better, no company can survive this."

Georgia Natural Gas Services, the state's top marketer, has been one big headache for AGL Resources, its parent, which recently took a $13.5 million pretax charge related to accounting discrepancies at the marketing affiliate and is engaged in messy litigation with a minority partner. "It's not been a good business for us," said Rosput of AGL.

No. 2 marketer Scana Energy has reported $4 million in profit from its Georgia operations so far this year, or about $1 per month per customer after accounting for bad debt. The South Carolina-based company had hoped to sell its Georgia customers wireless telephone and home security services but has gotten out of both businesses. The company says it's in for the long term.

New Power Co. made a late and aggressive entry into Georgia's natural gas market this year as part of a national push into deregulated gas and electricity markets. Wall Street didn't like the idea. The company's stock has plunged from $21 a year ago to less than $1. Its top financial backer, Enron Corp., last month wrote down about $270 million of its investment. But New Power President Eugene Lockhart insists Georgia is profitable for the company and that it's not planning to pull out.

Still, there's concern about the impact on competition if Shell or New Power quits. The PSC has designated New Power as emergency backup supplier if another company goes out of business. 

The ranks of marketers has already thinned from 19 three years ago to eight. The top four control 94 percent of the market.

PSC member Baker already sees an "oligopoly" with limited competition. Consumer choice "is supposed to be the hallmark" of deregulation, said Commissioner David Burgess. Instead, he said, "consumers have less and less."

'Re-regulation' calls

So far, no one has come forward with a solution to the deregulation problems. 

Calls for "re-regulation" are expected to grow when the General Assembly convenes in January. Already, a key backer of the 1997 deregulation law has jumped ship.

"We can't let Georgia consumers suffer for another year," said state Sen. Sonny Perdue of Bonaire, who said he will introduce legislation to re-regulate natural gas. Perdue, the main Senate sponsor of the 1997 deregulation law, is expected this week to announce his candidacy for the Republican nomination for governor. He would oppose Barnes. 

State Rep. Jimmy Skipper (D-Americus), the main House sponsor of the '97 law, said he's concerned about gas prices, but he's not sure re-regulation is "doable at this point."

Marketers are pressing for more time to give deregulation a chance. 

"We believe a year from now, weather permitting, that this will be a much calmer market and people will value the choices they have," saId Scana spokeswoman Cathy Love.

Returning to regulated natural gas would present a whole new host of problems, including dilemma No. 1: "If it's re-regulated, who takes the ball?" says PSC Chairman Lauren "Bubba" McDonald Jr.

Returning Atlanta Gas Light to the role of regulated utility would require the very expensive proposition of reconstructing billing and customer service systems for 1.5 million customers, which was turned over to marketers.

Then there's the question of whether marketers would be entitled to a "bailout" to recover their costs if forced from the market Georgia invited them into. 

One option being discussed is to have Atlanta Gas Light --- or even a marketer --- offer a regulated gas service alongside unregulated marketers. That would make Georgia more like other states that have deregulated.

Other measures could include new standards for billing, customer service and meter reading; more authority for the PSC, including emergency power to regulate prices; reducing the sales tax for gas bills; and increasing competition by allowing nonprofit electric cooperatives to become gas marketers.

But there are significant problems associated with every option that has been floated for "fixing" deregulation. In fact, there may be no good fix.

Rosput said she's "prepared to get to a solution," but like everyone else, she doesn't have an answer.

"It is my job to do the best I can to guide this ship," she said, "and there's no safe shore or good place to land."

I don't think past absences of reasoned decision making by the ACC should prejudice our attempt to re-engage, if there is a cause worth fighting for.  We had a good case then, and they blew us off.  One of the guys mainly responsible for that has since been run out of the state.   It's not like opportunities are as abundant as they once were nor are the commercial people going to go out of their way to tell us to engage.  Retail guys periodically ask about AZ but there is little to tell them.  If we see a worthy cause, let's go for it.   

Leslie - where do we start?

We fought this issue at the ACC when it was first presented several years ago.  Recall that this was the settlement where we were joined at the hip with the industrials, the industrials cut and run for a rate reduction, and we ended up litigating the case (testimony by Mark Frankena--on local market power, Tom Delaney, Harry Kingerski, and another consultant).  We got our bottoms kicked--although I think we won on the credit for billing our own customers (APS wanted to credit ESPs $0.25/customer--we got the number up somewhere above the cost of postage).

My recollection is simliar to Leslie's re:  the asset transfer and affiliate as the PLR.  It was part of the settlement.  We fought the arrangement and lost.  Recall that we appealled the ACC's decision on the basis of bias and lost.  I'm not a big fan of the ACC ... given our track record.  We have much better political contacts in Arizona now; however, the contacts are with the Gov's office and not the ACC.  Recall that the ACC is elected and is one of Arizona's four branches of government--i.e., the judiciary, the legislature, the executive branch and the ACC (by virtue of Arizona's constitution).

APS may be pushing back a little hard here (25% by 2008), but I'd want a firm indication that there was interest in Arizona before we fight it, and I'd want a clear indication that the market wasn't competitive from a retail perspective without the PLR being 100% short.  When we fought it last time, Frank Vickers and ENA had some interest in the PLR.  We tried to negotiate a deal with Jack Davis to swap some power so the PLR was instaneously being served by other than APS.  We were entirely unsuccessful and Vickers dropped Arizona like it had the plague.  

Having said all that, I'm always up for a good fight.  If we can EPSA to step in and spend some money, I'd be happy to help out in any way I can.

Are we (or EPSA) taking an active role in the filing APS made with the Arizona Commission to use the unregulated affiliate of its parent as the wholesale provider of last resort?  (There's an article on the filing in today's Electric Power Daily that says they've filed to push back the requirement that they purchase 100% of their power from the competitive market by 2004 to a requirement that they purchase 25% of their power competitively by 2008).

Yesterday, the Federal Trade Commission issued a staff report on electricity restructuring issues.  It is an update of the July 2000 report done at the request of House Energy Chairman Tauzin and Subcommittee Chairman Barton.  They requested the report be updated.  A summary of the report and the full 80+ page text is on the FTC web site at www.ftc.gov on the upper left side of the home page.

I read the summary and will read the balance.  So far, so good.  It basically says that even states that have opened up to retail competition are in transition with a hybrid of regulation and competition, thus the expected benefits of competition have not yet emerged.  However, the report states that nothing to date indicates that competition, once the transition period is over, will not produce additional benefits for consumers.  The report's major conclusion is that competitive wholesale markets are important to achieving effective competition in retail markets.  

The summary includes something that sounds promising on RTO policy, saying "And as wholesale and retail markets become regional, governing policies and jurisdictional approaches also must move in that direction for wholesale and retail competition to be successful."

We have intervened in Georgia Power's rate case.  Bob Frank will be our counsel and any issues regarding external communication about this case should be directed through him.  

We plan to address 3 issues: 1) GP's proposal for weather-related revenue sharing proposal (we'd like to see use of weather risk management; 2) support for GP's proposed capacity cost recovery rider, under certain conditions, and 3) reflection of risk reduction these first 2 issues would allow in GP's authorized ROE  (we will not address the underlying ROE).

Donald Lassere, Stella Chan and I will be working with Andy Anderson in URM and the weather desk (through Lisa Yoho)to develop our positions and testimony.

This morning Enron was interviewed by the Federal Reserve, CFTC, SEC, and the Department of Treasury (also attending were the OCC and the FDIC).  Scott Gahn from the commercial group lead the discussion and Vicki Sharp (legal), Mark Taylor (legal) and I supported Scott on the legal and regulatory issues.
The goal in the meeting was to provide the agencies information so they can draft an interagency document on the retail swap market and its regulation by end of the year as required by the CFMA.

Going into the meeting we knew that the CFTC and the Fed were more likely to support the retail swap industry expansion, with the SEC and Treasury more interested in a regulatory structure that allows their "clients" , the banks and broker/dealers to offer the swaps and protect against systemic risk.  The agency which extended lead the meeting - in our case the CFTC.   The other firms interviewed are Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Lehman, JP Morgan-Chase, Bank of America, ISDA, and Blackbird.

First, we noted that our targeted customers are the small to medium size business, not the residential consumer.  We argued that we can offer bundled retail swaps to those not meeting the eligible contract participant (ECP) requirements in deregulated markets where physically deliver is legal and possible, but unbundling the swap from the physical prohibits retail swaps to non-ECP customers.  This is a large markets (8.1 million potential mass market and small mass market customers) and the benefits of swaps to manage the volatility of deregulating markets should not be reserved to the Fortune 1,000.   The consumers would be full requirements consumers, so speculation would be managed.  If speculation and market manipulation were to occur state and common-law antifraud provisions are available.

We were able to isolate the SEC at the beginning the meeting by noting that we were not planning equity swaps.  The Treasury representative asked questions about manipulation, consumer protection, and the California situation for retail consumers.The OCC was concerned about coordination with state financial regulators and if this would be a barrier to market entry.

The USG agency officials acknowledged that the retail swaps in energy and other commodities were useful risk management products, but some disagree as the regulatory treatment. At the end of meeting, Treasury said that "do you expect us to exempt Enron solely in from regulation in offering these products?".  We said yes if we are willing to offer sound risk management products to our customers 

Best development: The CFTC official pulled us aside after the meeting and said that while Treasury may not willing to solely exempting Enron, the CFTC has the authority and is willing to consider just an exemption.  The CFTC is  interested in acting quickly to offer regulatory relief and legal certainty for those firms interested in offering these products under the ECP level.  She wants to sit down with us very shortly to decide how best to get move this at the CFTC, either through a formal rulemaking or no action letter.   The goal would be to act before the swap report is released in December, avoid legislative changes (which we strongly oppose), and allow for product innovation.

Call with any questions and I will keep you updated.

Unlike TX, creditworthiness standards for Alternative Retail Electric Suppliers (ARES) in IL is not uniform accross utility lines. The creditworthiness standards vary by utility, and also depends on the billing option chosen by the ARES. However, the single billing option (SBO) has creditworthiness standards that have general application because SBO certification is an ICC responsibility with uniform qualification criteria. All the applicable credit requirements set out below are cumulative.

Enron's Credit Rating of BBB(S&P), and Baa2(Moody's)
General Creditworthiness: Under Section 451.50 Subchapter C of the IL Admin. Code, as part of the qualification as an ARES all applicants must fulfill a general license bond requirement. In IL, EES is licensed to serve nonresidential retail customers with maximum electrical demand of 1MW or more. To secure this license, EES was required to post bond in the sum of $30,000. The bond is valid for one year, and conditioned on the full and faithful performance of all duties and obligations of EES as an ARES. If the license bond is cancelled, modified, expires or is drawn upon, EES must execute and maintain an additional or replacement bond, such that the cumulative value of all outstanding bonds never falls below the required amount. The EES license bond expired on June 2001. EES must issue another bond or provide an extension certificate up to June 2002, and annually thereafter.

Registration Under SubPart B:
EES is registered as an ARES under Subpart B of Section 451.100 - expedited certification for ARES that seek to serve only non-residential customers with maximum demand of  1MW or more. Subpart B has additional financial qualifications
	1. To maintain certification under Subpart B, EES needs to maintain at least one of the following long-term credit ratings of BBB- (S&P), Baa3 (Moody's), BBB- (Duff 	& Phelps), or BBB- (Fitch); or

	2.  Maintain a borrowing agreement with an affiliate that has the above ratings. The amount of credit available to EES under the borrowing agreement shall 
	not be less than $500,000 or 5% of EES' revenue for last fiscal year; or
	
	3. Show that the EES obligations arising from electric energy and fuel purchases are covered by an unconditional guaranty, bond, or LC, in an amount not less than  	$500,000 or 5% of EES's revenue for the last fiscal year; or

	4. Certify that it will reimburse its IL retail customers for additional costs they incur to acquire electricity upon EES' contractual failure. This certification shall be 	covered by an unconditional guaranty, bond, or LC in the sum of 1080 times the maximum MW EES estimates to schedule in the next 12 months, multiplied by the 	average of the 45 highest daily market prices of energy traded in the previous year; or
	
	5. EES maintains a  line of credit or revolving credit agreement in the amount of $500,000 or 5% of its revenue for last fiscal year, from an "A" rated financial 	insitution; or
	
	6. EES earns 12 points on the financial ratios - pre-tax interest coverage, funds from operations interest coverage, funds from operations to total debt, and total debt 	to total capital.

Enron's Credit Rating and downgrades: To satisfy the Subpart B requirements, EES provided an unconditional guaranty from Enron Corp. Given our current credit rating of BBB(S&P) and Baa2 (Moody's), that guaranty is still valid. However, if Enron Corp is downgraded below the required credit level, EES will have to provide any of the above alternative forms of creditworthiness.

IMPACT: The above creditworthiness requirements relate to EES's ability to do business in IL. Failure to maintain the foregoing standards will result in the loss of our IL license. This will trigger contractual default for all our customers, both financial and physical. Please note that, EES is out of compliance on the license bond and needs to post a new bond ASAP.

Single Bill Option:
Pursuant to Section 451.500, Subpart F, any ARES that chooses the Single Bill Option (SBO), must demonstrate ability to establish and maintain sufficient financial resources to satisfy the obligation to remit to the utilities, monies that it collects under the SBO tariff. To satisfy these additional creditworthiness standards, EES must either:
	1. Post and maintain bond in the amount of 15% of its estimated obligation to the utility under the SBO

	2. Provide an irrevocable LC issued by a financial insitution with an "A" rating

	3. Maintain at least the following long term credit ratings, a BBB- (S&P), Baa3 (Moody's), BBB-(duff &Phelps, BBB- (Fitch)
	
	4. Provide an unconditional guaranty from an affiliate with the above ratings.
Enron's Current Rating: EES is currently working to obtain ICC certification under the SBO tariff. This means that EES must maintain the minimum long term credit ratings set out in 3, or provide a guaranty from an affiliate with those ratings. EES is not rated. However, given Enron Corp's current credit rating of BBB and Baa2, a parental guaranty will suffice to meet the qualification under the SBO tariff. 

Further Downgrades: If Enron Corp is down graded below the required minimum ratings, EES will need to provide a bond or LC, or forego the SBO option.

IMPACT: EES will continue to do business in IL as an ARES. Thus EES will maintain its ability to service its customers both financial and physical. However, there could be substantial impact on EES customer service and operation, particularly our ability to meet customer expectations and timely collect outstanding receivables.

Instrument Fund Charges: (akin to stranded costs)
Under the Illinois tariffs, EES can choose annually, one of two remittance timelines for IFC charges. (1) To remit IFC charges within 7 days of receipt of customer payment, or more frequently as required; or (2) within 15 days of utility invoicing, whether or not customer has paid. If EES chooses the 2nd option, it has to provide a security deposit equal to one month's estimated IFC charges for all EES' customers. Deposit amount will be determined based on monthly KW customer usage, and the IFC charge per KWH. If the expected IFC charge for EES' customers is $5,000,000 or more, this deposit amount will be revised monthly.

If EES chooses the 2nd option - remittance of bills within 15 days of utility invoicing, we will be required to provide the deposit.

IMPACT: This deposit requirement for the IFC charges relate to Illinois Power customers and not to ComEd. For ComEd, IFC charges nets out to zero, and customers do not pay those charges. EES is currently doing business as a billing agent in IP's service territory, and is required to execute the Billing Agent Agreement which will implement the deposit requirement. If EES chooses the first remittance option, it will avoid the deposit requirement. However, this may have operational implications.

It is decision time.  The City has verbally agreed to ALL of our "5" major 
issues.  Their General Counsel and Ed Essandoh are trading drafts of proposed 
language today and tomorrow.  The deal is not without risk in the next 30 
days.  However, the City has responded to all of our demands, has gotten the 
proper people involved, and seems very interested in completing this 
transaction.  Overall, from what I have seen in the last 3 weeks, it appears 
we have a good deal here.  Following you will find:

Notional Deal Valuation
 
 -  You will only find the deals we anticipate would close at the July 
Council mtg, good chance others may come but they are not considered here.

Positive Forces for Enron

Risks for Enron (w/Plan to Mitigate)

Estimated Costs to Finish the Deal (conservative estimate)

Action Plan/Timeline


Notional Deal Valuation 

Department   Estimates Ann Spend  TCV  MTM

Airports *    $15   $120  $2.0

Water Dept    $10   $80  $1.2

DGS     $10   $80  $1.2

CTA - Non-Traction   $15   $120  $2.0

Total     $50   $400  $6.4

Note: We are currently working on the Airports.  The City has commit the 
other facilities if we can do it by the June City Council meeting.  We think 
the above deals are similar in nature and can be ready by June introduction.


Positive Forces for Enron

The Mayor has endorsed this to his people and is willing to do so publicly.

Powerful political forces are removing obstacles to this deal.

City Officials are ready to back this deal in front of City Council.

Concessions from the City to this point have been unprecedented (according to 
outside counsel, consultants, and City employees/officials).

Risks for Enron

MBE/MWE perception of total contract value versus obligations to MBE/MWE 
requirements.  The Compliance Department has agreed to evaluate the rule of 
law against our administrative costs since this is a commodity deal.  
Perception needs to be managed.  Plan to mitigate:  Hire MWE/MBE consultant 
to work with appropriate Enron people to develop a plan.  THIS needs to be 
resolved before any public announcement.

Public perception needs to managed.  Plan to mitigate:  It is our intent to 
work with Peggy's group to hire a local PR consultant.  The Enron people will 
manage how we interact with this group.

There is a chance that City Council could possibly not approve our contract 
and ordinance once the Mayor submits it.  Plan to mitigate:  We are designing 
a plan to deploy political consultants and lobbyists to influence the process.

Enron will need a "face" in Chicago to work with City Council, deal issues, 
and potentially the media.  Plan to mitigate:  Eric does his current job from 
Chicago in June and part of July.

Estimated Costs to Finish the Deal (conservative estimate)

Outside Counsel (Contract, City Council work)    $30,000

PR Consultant        $20,000

MBE/MWE Consultant       $20,000

Travel and Housing (Eric)      $15,000

Internal Structuring & Legal        $5,000

Total         $90,000

Action Plan/Timeline

Final written language for major issues     5/9

Ed Essandoh to finalize all language (in Chicago)   5/10

Meetings to set plan to mitigate Risks for Enron    5/11 

Meeting with City to discuss action plan and roll-out to Council  5/14

Action Plan Further Defined      5/15


It is imperative that we make a decision on this deal now.  We look bad 
enough killing it after all the city's concessions.  However, we will look 
worse in the public eye if we back out later.

What is your view on this?  On the one hand Arkansa is not a major state on the radar screen, but on the other hand this adds to the steady decline of dereg and the perception that dereg is bad.  I would recommend that we review the report and weigh in at the hearing on October 18.  I think we should take the view that repealing legislation is not necessary and that the PSC should keep its options open.  Also we could talk about the EPSA study findings and the fact that wholesale prices are going down.  Moreover, I am concerned that studies like that of the Consumer Federation are not weighing into their analysis price increases that would have occurred under dereg simply due to the need for more capacity.

Subject:        Arkansas PSC to Scrap Deregulation 


PSC staff advises against deregulation

Sep. 7, 2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

LITTLE ROCK (AP) - The staff for state utility regulators is recommending that Arkansas postpone deregulation of its electricity industry or scrap state law altogether that calls for electric deregulation and start over.

The staff of the state Public Service Commission arrived at the recommendation based on a study by Washington, D.C.-based consultants La Capra Associates, which found that deregulation would lead to higher and unstable rates.

The study, conducted for the PSC staff, said undeveloped wholesale electric markets would cause higher, potentially volatile electric rates if retail markets were deregulated in October 2003.

In addition, La Capra said regional groups to oversee interstate electric transmission haven't been formed and utility back-office systems required to switch customers between service providers haven't been developed or tested.

The staff recommended scrapping deregulation or at least delaying it until October 2004. John Bethel, the commission's executive director, said he favored repealing the law deregulating the state's retail electric markets and starting over when conditions change.

"A repeal is probably the most effective path," he said. "Based on our analysis, it doesn't appear that there are substantial benefits to customers over the long term."

Under a 1999 law, electricity deregulation was to begin between Jan. 1, 2002, and June 30, 2003. This year, the Legislature amended the law to delay deregulation, setting a new start time between Oct. 1, 2003 and Oct. 1, 2005. Any further delay will require legislative.

And if Arkansas puts off deregulation again, it will continue a pattern. Five states besides Arkansas have delayed competition so far and no states have passed electric deregulation laws since problems began in California last year.

Senate president pro-tem Mike Beebe, D-Searcy, said the urgency to deregulate the state's retail electric market wasn't the same as in 1999, when neighboring states were crafting similar laws and local officials feared the state would suffer in the battle to recruit industry.

Utilities, industrial customers, and the attorney general's office Thursday were reviewing the PSC staff recommendation.

The staff recommendation will be considered by the PSC, along with the views of Arkansas utilities, consumers and the attorney general's office. A hearing is set for Oct. 18.

Sorry.  Don't know how we left you off the final distribution.



As for Ader, yes he is making progress.  We have three good opportunities in 
NEPOOL, one in PJM and are travelling next week to TN.  Also, Illinois looks 
very promising.  The main challenge for Jeff at the moment is getting staffed 
up to pursue all the opportunities we are uncovering.  I am helping Jeff on 
each of the leads, working with the appropriate regional people in our group 
to get plugged in.  I know you are probably buried but I would love to catch 
you for 10 minutes some time and bring you up to date in a little more 
detail.  I will call Ginger and see if she set something up.

Janine - my thoughts -

On the rate cases, I don't think we need any change of direction.  For the IP case, our argument is just the legal one of whether they can discriminate.  And there were a lot more parties involved with ComEd than IP, even though the issues are basically the same, so I wouldn't worry there about perception.

The bigger deal may be our protest of Dynergy's protest of Com Ed's treatment of Firm LD for marketers.  The filing has already been made, so we should stay on track.

Subject:	Illinois

Given the recent developments with the potential merger between Enron and Dynergy, there are a few policy questions in Illinois for which we would like guidance:

Illinois Power

We have intervened in the delivery service tariff case and are handling it primarily inhouse and solo - no other marketers.  Yesterday, we filed a Reply (greatly toned down - sticking to the facts only) to IP's memo contra our Motion to Dismiss.  URM decided not to do testimony so at this point we contemplate not showing up at the hearing and briefing only.  Recall that the issue is that to raise distribution tariffs for only unbundled customers taking service from an alternative supplier is unlawful and also anticompetitive and discriminatory, etc.  Our book impact could be around $2 million, I believe should IP get the full increase.  Moreover, it would stifle future competition.  

query:  Should our course of action be altered?


ComEd

ComEd parallels IP except that it is going forward first.  We made the same arguments on the Motion to Dismiss, which was denied by the Judge.  Our plan is to seek rehearing with the full Commission and to point out that the ICC filed comments at FERC with respect to increasing only unbundled transmission rates that were fully consistent with our arguments respecting distribution!

The case is currently in hearing and we have an Enron witness testifying.

In a separate move in this case, the City of Chicago and Cook county have filed a separate action requesting an audit and investigation of ComEd's books and records alleging basically that ComEd is seeking double recovery of costs.  If we intervened it might be possible to do so without paying any of the costs, assuming Blackhawk and AES/New Energy agree (we have done this for them in the past).
Upsides are that it would be viewed positively by the City of Chicago and Cook County as supporting them.  Downsides are that this really gets into rate issues that in previous RCR discussions we were told to stay away from and secondly, do we really want to be supporting an audit and investigation of another utility's books and records right now, given Enron's position?  

The last point is whether there is a perception problem in being more aggressive with Com Ed than IP on the rate discrimination issue, should we decide to take that path.

Janine

Seems to me that we need to engage in AZ (along with NV and OR?) in the Western states to try and push competition forward.  Why don't we first assemble a (1) what we know - what we don't know memo and then (2) look at oppotunities to push our agenda.  

Leslie - everyone is looking to you to lead us to the promised land in AZ...  GO GET 'EM!!!!!!

I don't think past absences of reasoned decision making by the ACC should prejudice our attempt to re-engage, if there is a cause worth fighting for.  We had a good case then, and they blew us off.  One of the guys mainly responsible for that has since been run out of the state.   It's not like opportunities are as abundant as they once were nor are the commercial people going to go out of their way to tell us to engage.  Retail guys periodically ask about AZ but there is little to tell them.  If we see a worthy cause, let's go for it.   

Leslie - where do we start?

Subject:	RE: APS Filing 

We fought this issue at the ACC when it was first presented several years ago.  Recall that this was the settlement where we were joined at the hip with the industrials, the industrials cut and run for a rate reduction, and we ended up litigating the case (testimony by Mark Frankena--on local market power, Tom Delaney, Harry Kingerski, and another consultant).  We got our bottoms kicked--although I think we won on the credit for billing our own customers (APS wanted to credit ESPs $0.25/customer--we got the number up somewhere above the cost of postage).

My recollection is simliar to Leslie's re:  the asset transfer and affiliate as the PLR.  It was part of the settlement.  We fought the arrangement and lost.  Recall that we appealled the ACC's decision on the basis of bias and lost.  I'm not a big fan of the ACC ... given our track record.  We have much better political contacts in Arizona now; however, the contacts are with the Gov's office and not the ACC.  Recall that the ACC is elected and is one of Arizona's four branches of government--i.e., the judiciary, the legislature, the executive branch and the ACC (by virtue of Arizona's constitution).

APS may be pushing back a little hard here (25% by 2008), but I'd want a firm indication that there was interest in Arizona before we fight it, and I'd want a clear indication that the market wasn't competitive from a retail perspective without the PLR being 100% short.  When we fought it last time, Frank Vickers and ENA had some interest in the PLR.  We tried to negotiate a deal with Jack Davis to swap some power so the PLR was instaneously being served by other than APS.  We were entirely unsuccessful and Vickers dropped Arizona like it had the plague.  

Having said all that, I'm always up for a good fight.  If we can EPSA to step in and spend some money, I'd be happy to help out in any way I can.

Are we (or EPSA) taking an active role in the filing APS made with the Arizona Commission to use the unregulated affiliate of its parent as the wholesale provider of last resort?  (There's an article on the filing in today's Electric Power Daily that says they've filed to push back the requirement that they purchase 100% of their power from the competitive market by 2004 to a requirement that they purchase 25% of their power competitively by 2008).

Following my 8/8/01 e-mail on this subject, below is an update.

NY and NJ
We have finalized the customer scripts for NY and NJ. Attached are the latest drafts with final amendments. Per the below e-mail, I have determined that Enron will not be required to register as a telemarketer in NY. This removes the additional time required to process the registration application and a $25,000 bonding requirement. Barring further amendments today, a clean copy of the scripts will be generated for roll out.
  
TX
We have finalized the Your Rights as a Customer (YRC) disclosure, the Terms of Service(TOS), and the Electricity Facts Label (EFT) to insure compliance with the specific rule provisions regarding telemarketing. Attached are the latest drafts with final amendments. A clean copy will be generated for roll out.
   
I also attach the latest timeline for the conclusion of the process.
 
I have emphasized to relevant business people, that to protect Enron from any rule violations by our outsourced telemarketing agent, we must show that we have established and implemented written procedures, and have trained their personnel to comply. I will be happy to review training materials to insure compliance.

Please call with any questions.

Thanks,
Gloria

Subject:	RE: Texas Terms of Service and Your Rights as a Customer with questions

I have just received confirmation from Michael Elmendorf, Snr. Investigator at the New York Secretary of State's office, that pursuant to Section 399-pp, paragraph 10, Enron Energy Services is exempt from registration as a telemarketer and bonding. This is because EESI is registered with the NYPSC as an ESCO to market electricity to customers in NY. Rich Roman of the NYPSC Office of Consumer Education and Advocacy concurred with this interpretation.

Also John Walters of the NY Consumer Protection Board confirmed that because EESI's marketing calls will be to "for-profit businesses" we are not required to fulfill the Telemarketer Registration and Bonding Requirement. This is good news. As it takes aware the 10-15 day processing timeline.

It is my understanding that we do not need a permit to telemarket in TX. EESI is licensed as a REP and bound to comply with the specific telemarketing rules
set out in the Customer Protection Rules.There is no additional licensing requirement. I have placed calls with the Customer Protection Department to confirm.

Thank you for your speedy response.

I still haven't gotten confirmation from the Brobeck lawyers on whether we really need to file the permit application in NY.   Have you heard from the Sec. of State?

Also,  are we correct that we don't need a permit in Texas since we are on registered with the SEC and are on the Stock Exhchange?  Apparently entities regulated by the PUC also don't have to register as a telemarketer but I don't think we are "regulated" unless that includes the quasi regulation of us as a REP.  What are your thoughts?

Janet --

Going forward Govt Affairs will coordinate with Services and Product Development (and other EWS and EES groups as appropriate, e.g. Credit) to ensure compliance with (1) licensing/registration, (2) bonding/security, (3) regulatory reporting, and (4) other.  I have asked Gloria Ogenyi to lead this effort for us.  We will need other groups to appoint a Lead for their teams as soon as possible (I will work with Evan, Legal, and Product Development to find out the appropriate people).

I fully concur with Rogers that within all new Product Development activities there must be a clear analysis of our obligations and appropriate resource allocation to continue supporting the market activity.   As important, just because we don't want to attract new business in a given market doesn't mean that our responsibilities have ended.  We need to ensure that our Product Development activities are accounting for the costs of these obligations over the long-term.  To ensure that we are selling in accordance with applicable regulations, I would recommend that Gloria be on the Product Development sign-off sheet.

In addition, we have already begun reviewing obligations, etc. for our current market activity (both wholesale and retail).  I will talk with Gloria to build the matrix of issues you referenced.  Our goal is to make current all of our market obligations.

I will call you to provide an update on the market review when I have more information.  If you want to talk about this, please call.

Thanks,

Jim

PS - I'll ask Gloria to give you an update on the IL bonding status.

We are not managing bonds, etc.  This is a market entry requirement and should be documented by Product Development/Services upon entering new markets.  We had a meeting earlier this week with Vicki Sharp and came to general agreement that this was a Services/Regulatory maintenance requirement.  Will follow up and make sure they are pulling this together.  This is one of the issues I have been hammering on re: new product development/new market entry - I want proof of all data requirements/costs/license requirements/processes before new products are released and markets are entered.  In the past, I believe sign offs have occurred without a complete understanding of the requirements.  I have refused to sign any new products until Product Development can prove the above exists - even for markets where we are already doing business.

Why did this expire without renewal? Who is managing this specific issue and what is the status of the bond renewal? I would like a matrix outlining each state we do business in for gas and power, the requirements/obligations for EES to be a retail seller (gas & power)
 in each of those states, and status of those requirements (i.e.- dates when next action is needed). I'd also like the name of the individuals responsible for ensuring these requirements are met listed beside the states. I'd like to have this pulled together within a week.

Also, Rogers, could you forward to me the status of the bond requirement referred to below- thanks.

Subject:	IMPORTANT: Illinois - Creditworthiness Issues

Unlike TX, creditworthiness standards for Alternative Retail Electric Suppliers (ARES) in IL is not uniform accross utility lines. The creditworthiness standards vary by utility, and also depends on the billing option chosen by the ARES. However, the single billing option (SBO) has creditworthiness standards that have general application because SBO certification is an ICC responsibility with uniform qualification criteria. All the applicable credit requirements set out below are cumulative.

Enron's Credit Rating of BBB(S&P), and Baa2(Moody's)
General Creditworthiness: Under Section 451.50 Subchapter C of the IL Admin. Code, as part of the qualification as an ARES all applicants must fulfill a general license bond requirement. In IL, EES is licensed to serve nonresidential retail customers with maximum electrical demand of 1MW or more. To secure this license, EES was required to post bond in the sum of $30,000. The bond is valid for one year, and conditioned on the full and faithful performance of all duties and obligations of EES as an ARES. If the license bond is cancelled, modified, expires or is drawn upon, EES must execute and maintain an additional or replacement bond, such that the cumulative value of all outstanding bonds never falls below the required amount. The EES license bond expired on June 2001. EES must issue another bond or provide an extension certificate up to June 2002, and annually thereafter.

Registration Under SubPart B:
EES is registered as an ARES under Subpart B of Section 451.100 - expedited certification for ARES that seek to serve only non-residential customers with maximum demand of  1MW or more. Subpart B has additional financial qualifications
	1. To maintain certification under Subpart B, EES needs to maintain at least one of the following long-term credit ratings of BBB- (S&P), Baa3 (Moody's), BBB- (Duff 	& Phelps), or BBB- (Fitch); or

	2.  Maintain a borrowing agreement with an affiliate that has the above ratings. The amount of credit available to EES under the borrowing agreement shall 
	not be less than $500,000 or 5% of EES' revenue for last fiscal year; or
	
	3. Show that the EES obligations arising from electric energy and fuel purchases are covered by an unconditional guaranty, bond, or LC, in an amount not less than  	$500,000 or 5% of EES's revenue for the last fiscal year; or

	4. Certify that it will reimburse its IL retail customers for additional costs they incur to acquire electricity upon EES' contractual failure. This certification shall be 	covered by an unconditional guaranty, bond, or LC in the sum of 1080 times the maximum MW EES estimates to schedule in the next 12 months, multiplied by the 	average of the 45 highest daily market prices of energy traded in the previous year; or
	
	5. EES maintains a  line of credit or revolving credit agreement in the amount of $500,000 or 5% of its revenue for last fiscal year, from an "A" rated financial 	insitution; or
	
	6. EES earns 12 points on the financial ratios - pre-tax interest coverage, funds from operations interest coverage, funds from operations to total debt, and total debt 	to total capital.

Enron's Credit Rating and downgrades: To satisfy the Subpart B requirements, EES provided an unconditional guaranty from Enron Corp. Given our current credit rating of BBB(S&P) and Baa2 (Moody's), that guaranty is still valid. However, if Enron Corp is downgraded below the required credit level, EES will have to provide any of the above alternative forms of creditworthiness.

IMPACT: The above creditworthiness requirements relate to EES's ability to do business in IL. Failure to maintain the foregoing standards will result in the loss of our IL license. This will trigger contractual default for all our customers, both financial and physical. Please note that, EES is out of compliance on the license bond and needs to post a new bond ASAP.

Single Bill Option:
Pursuant to Section 451.500, Subpart F, any ARES that chooses the Single Bill Option (SBO), must demonstrate ability to establish and maintain sufficient financial resources to satisfy the obligation to remit to the utilities, monies that it collects under the SBO tariff. To satisfy these additional creditworthiness standards, EES must either:
	1. Post and maintain bond in the amount of 15% of its estimated obligation to the utility under the SBO

	2. Provide an irrevocable LC issued by a financial insitution with an "A" rating

	3. Maintain at least the following long term credit ratings, a BBB- (S&P), Baa3 (Moody's), BBB-(duff &Phelps, BBB- (Fitch)
	
	4. Provide an unconditional guaranty from an affiliate with the above ratings.
Enron's Current Rating: EES is currently working to obtain ICC certification under the SBO tariff. This means that EES must maintain the minimum long term credit ratings set out in 3, or provide a guaranty from an affiliate with those ratings. EES is not rated. However, given Enron Corp's current credit rating of BBB and Baa2, a parental guaranty will suffice to meet the qualification under the SBO tariff. 

Further Downgrades: If Enron Corp is down graded below the required minimum ratings, EES will need to provide a bond or LC, or forego the SBO option.

IMPACT: EES will continue to do business in IL as an ARES. Thus EES will maintain its ability to service its customers both financial and physical. However, there could be substantial impact on EES customer service and operation, particularly our ability to meet customer expectations and timely collect outstanding receivables.

Instrument Fund Charges: (akin to stranded costs)
Under the Illinois tariffs, EES can choose annually, one of two remittance timelines for IFC charges. (1) To remit IFC charges within 7 days of receipt of customer payment, or more frequently as required; or (2) within 15 days of utility invoicing, whether or not customer has paid. If EES chooses the 2nd option, it has to provide a security deposit equal to one month's estimated IFC charges for all EES' customers. Deposit amount will be determined based on monthly KW customer usage, and the IFC charge per KWH. If the expected IFC charge for EES' customers is $5,000,000 or more, this deposit amount will be revised monthly.

If EES chooses the 2nd option - remittance of bills within 15 days of utility invoicing, we will be required to provide the deposit.

IMPACT: This deposit requirement for the IFC charges relate to Illinois Power customers and not to ComEd. For ComEd, IFC charges nets out to zero, and customers do not pay those charges. EES is currently doing business as a billing agent in IP's service territory, and is required to execute the Billing Agent Agreement which will implement the deposit requirement. If EES chooses the first remittance option, it will avoid the deposit requirement. However, this may have operational implications.

Dynegy has 800 MW of generation in Georgia and is trying to get more.  They want to make sure nothing hurts the competitive bidding process for new generation.  They also say they are a "consumer", but I don't know the size of their load  (may just be the two plants). 

We'll be meeting with them next week to discuss further.

Attached is the first draft of our intervention in the Georgia Power rate case.
 << File: Georgia Power Case3.doc >> 

Our goals are to get:
Georgia Power's weather risk transferred to the market through purchase of weather hedges, in lieu of GP's proposal to refund a portion of above normal weather revenues in exchange for supposedly bearing downside weather risk (for EGM, principally);
Disclosure of new capacity contracts whose costs are proposed to be recovered through a new automatic capacity recovery mechanism, to help our own ability to hedge existing retail positions (for EWS);
Application of an earnings test that would limit when the capacity cost recovery mechanism goes into place, to help keep down rate increases on our existing retail positions (for EWS);
A reduction in GP's ROE if the automatic capacity recovery mechanism is approved; to limit rate increases on our existing retail positions (for EWS).

Andy and Mark, please give me your suggestions.  I will schedule follow-ups as needed.  Mark, I have talked to Gary Taylor and he is working up some hedge examples that will be very useful.  Also, Bob Frank and I had a very general discussion with Dynegy about our issues.  They have intervened in this case also and may be supportive.  Do you have any objection to sharing our views with them?  They could be very helpful.  

Mike, I think this is the first rate case where Enron is intervening in a closed state (Georgia).  It's certainly likely other parties will want to know our interests.  Most of the retail position is from Springs, Owens Corning, Quebecor, Rich, and Simon.  Another half-dozen contracts also have positions there.  I want to make sure you have no objection to Enron's participation.  Any suggestion on how best to characterize our interest would be great.

We have four weeks before this must be finalized so there is time.  But hearings start next week for GP's witnesses so any immediate feedback in terms of direction, etc. would be great.

Thank you.

Attached is a description of the action plan for the Load Curtailment efforts 
in CA, ME, and NY this Summer.  If someone from the deal team has not yet 
contacted you, they will be very soon.  If not, let me know.  

The general idea is that we will play against the ISO Load programs with our 
new technology (Sue I know about Cal ISO credit risk).  EES believes that 
with the tremendous amount of volatility this may be a great product.

Fred - I'll leave it to you to set up either one big call or some other 
process to contact appropriate Govt Affairs people.

Thanks for the update.  It is disappointing that AGA is not opening the pro=

Also, what are we doing to get the different states to adopt these protocol=

		 Subject: EES Position at the customer/utility level. 

Colleagues:

GA Support Services and Risk Analytics Groups shall communicate, shortly, a 
system that shall allow you to have a monthly update on EES positions in your 
service territories.  The system shall also provide the position to ad-hoc 
requests as needed.
  
The update shall be on monthly basis, and could be customized as per your 
needs/requests.    The primary sources can provide the following:
The position (long, short, and net) in electric utility "x"
The position (long, short, and net) per customer in the electric utility "x".
The position (long, short, and net) per rate schedule/customer class in 
electric utility "x".
Aggregates of the above per State, NERC Region, and Customer.

GA Support, and Risk Analytics aim at providing the data on a 
request-by-request basis in a user initiated system.  The Team is working on 
building a system to answer your data request within 180 working minutes of 
receiving it.  You shall receive an email of the persons to contact with 
their coordinates (e.g., telephone numbers, location...etc.) shortly.   

In designing this system, the Team is constrained by the EES stringent 
request to guarantee that no third party can have access to data.  Part of 
this concern  is mitigated by the request-by-request approach followed as it 
will communicate the lowest level of disaggregated data.  Your utmost care in 
dealing with these data, in my opinion, should satisfy any remaining concerns 
for EES.     

This the  beginning of a longer series of products and services in the 
pipeline.  The Team is keen to know your opinion, and advice.  Any advice on 
the likely frequency of needing this data, the level of details/aggregation 
will be greatly useful and appreciated.

and highlights where our retail priorites will need to shift.  

Total Cash Value of commodity deals closed in the first 2 months of 2001 and 
commodity deals that are currently resourced internally for possible Q1 or Q2 
closure:

NY    $1615 million
TX      $905 million

enough of these circular e-mails reinventing the wheel (or circle).  We are 
getting nowhere fast.  The 5 of us need to talk.  Please set something up.

If you are more comfortable with your plan, this will work for us.  Our 
objective is the objective, not necessarily the path taken.  I think there is 
more than one way to draw a circle, and your proposal looks equally as good.

We will perform step 1.  We hope to have something to you in 3 to 4 weeks.  
In the meantime, we will provide you a list of the right URM personnel 
associated with each position.

With respect to step 2, we will assume that the top 30 is reported accurately 
with respect to the risk we have assumed and we will manage the portfolio 
versus any particular deal.  Given all of our responsibilities, we will most 
likely have difficulty analyzing the specific transactions associated with 
the position, but we will do what we can if you think this is a useful 
exercise.    

Government Affairs can start thinking about step 3 in parallel or wait to get 
the results from step 1, either is fine.

We will wait to do step 4 after steps 1 and  2 are finished.  If you choose 
to start step 3, you may also want to filter out any plans that are 
improbable or impossible.

We will gladly accept the offer for GA to perform step 5.

Step 6 is the objective.

(The e-mail you sent was encoded to prevent forwarding, copying or any other 
form of duplication, so my response needs to be by reference to it..)

You asked if GA can provide a list of regulatory and statutory activities 
that may impact our position on your top 30 utilities.  That's not the way we 
need to proceed.

Instead, what I'd like to do (and what I think Scott also agrees with) is 
have the right people from the desk and the right people from GA jointly 
develop what the regulatory hedge strategy should be for each of the major 
utility positions.   In each case, the process should be something like - 

1) re-review the curve, identify major uncertainties and major certainties,
2) re-review the position, identify what the major deals are that constitute 
the position, and any nuances about the deal that would be beneficial to know 
about , like term, type of pricing, etc.,
3) brainstorm the things that could be done, legislatively, regulatorily, or 
other, to protect or improve the position,
4) brainstorm how the things identified in #3 could best be done, what 
resources would be required, and whether the chances for success warrant the 
expenditure and effort
5) have GA take the lead in writing up a regulatory strategy, complete with 
milestones and timelines for when we should expect to see things happen, and 
what the off-ramps to the strategy will be, perhaps including the point at 
which the curve would be changed
6) have GA and the desk interactively communicate on the success of the 
strategy.

So far, we are at about :
stage 2 for Com Ed, Duke, SPS, Ohio Power, and Illinois Power
stage 4 for PG&E, 
stage 3 for HL&P,
and ready to get started for the rest.

The integration of people so far is 
Com Ed, IP  (Sue L, Roy Boston, Ajit Gill)
Ohio Power (Janine, Burranit?)
PG&E  (Roger, Mona )
HL&P  (Jeff, Pat Keene, Robin Kittel)

So, my recommendation for next steps is to drive these existing efforts 
through to stage 6, and get the rest of the utilities started by naming the 
right personnel.  Thoughts?

Wanda, Vladi - Dave Foti described the interest rate hedge for a few of us in 
Govt Affairs yesterday.  He said you wanted feedback from us before you 
completed the process.  I raised a few issues with Dave, and since he is out 
today and I will be in Calgary next Monday/Tuesday on business, here are my 
issues:

The $17 million MTM essentially amounts to monetizing an expected decrease in 
regulated distribution and transmission rates.  Two assumptions seem to be 
driving this: 

 1) net T&D plant will not grow as fast relative to sales as it has in the 
past.  Stated another way, load growth will be met by less new investment.  
Dave was going to quantify the effect.  Given the push for increased T&D 
reliability, this assumption is not intuitive and seems to be at odds with 
our own business strategy of using energy efficiency and distributed 
generation to lessen electric sales.

2) regulated utility capital structures will become more debt-oriented 
relative to equity than they are now (move to 60/40 from 50/50).  This is a 
reasonable
assumption, but the change is likely to occur over time and not instantly.  I 
do not know how quickly this change is reflected in the model.

Regulatory assumption on how long frozen rates are in place and how often 
rate cases occur appear reasonable.  I would just note several of our 
significant positions are behind utilities with Performance-based Rates and I 
am not aware of how these have been modelled.  

As an aside, it would be useful to know how much of the regulated T&D 
position is actually hedged by interest rates - in other words, how much of 
the T&D rate is actually comprised of utility return on investment.  I'm 
guessing this is about 25 - 35% or so.

Dave and others working on this project have done a lot of great work here 
and with answers on the above issues we would be on board.

I can be reached via Rubena Buerger, x31516.
