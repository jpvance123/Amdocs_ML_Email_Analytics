Richard,

After going throught the numbers on this peaker. I can only pay 4-5 cents for 
a 10 day peaker at Chicago. That would be a net payment to you of 
$604,000. 

You are giving me 6.6% of the underlying days and I will pay 10% of the 
underlying price to get the optionality.  As a relative value NYZ6 or Socal 
is worth much more.  Alliance seems to have taken all of the strong interest 
out of this market. Hunter won't pay any additional premium as Chicago is too 
liquid physically to justify a premium for the molecules.  

Call me to go over the numbers if you want 

Pete

Louise,

Thanks for your reply to my email.  

The fixes implemented over the weekend appear to have worked extremely well.  

I am sure that the changes your team made also contributed to the record  147 
external and 263 total trades that I executed today.

Thanks for all your help.

Pete Keavey

I assume that the tokenized products for gas daily and daily basis with 
continue to be coded for my book on a forward basis.   I also am assuming 
that the Henry Hub products have been moved to FT East who is now managing 
them.

Thanks for your help

Jeff,

since Dutch is still out could you take care of this ??  I'm not exactly sure 
what he is talking about.  The trades should be part of a spread in whcich 
reliant is also buying or selling the hub.  
Thanks

Pete,

I'm seeing some trades with your name as Trader which are at extremely high 
prices.   Transco Z6 vs. Henry Hub trades at prices of $15.6025 from Trade 
Date of 12/5.  Are these errors?  EOL numbers are 658961 and 658985 (both 
with Reliant).  No confirmation has been sent on these.  Please have your 
Book Admin notify me as soon as you get a chance to look at these.

Thanks,
Joe Hunter

I put in an offsetting trade for the phys/financial swap.  You will have to 
process three confirmations to get it done 2 offsetting phys and 1 
financial.

Subject: Spread option on Tiverton for Bal '00

Calpine-EMI wants to get a bid from us on a spread option on their Tiverton 
plant in Tiverton, Rhode Island for Sept 1, 00 through Dec 31, 00.  (Tiverton 
apparently has achieved full commercial status as of today)  I will be 
pulling together a price today/tomorrow and was hoping to get back to them no 
later than end of this week.  They are shopping this around to 4-5 entities 
including us.  Here are some details FYI:

Day-ahead on-peak call on either power or gas
Power qty = 250 MW
Power strike = $45/Mwh
Gas qty = 30,666 mmBtu per day (16 on-peak hours), which results in an 
implied heat rate of about 7667 mmbtu/GWh
Gas strike is $5.90/mmBtu
Gas is delivered to plant; they will assign their Algonquin gas capacity 
rights which will allow secondary rights anywhere on the Algonquin G lateral
Power firmness:  unit contingent with availability guarantee of not less than 
95%
Gas firmness:  secondary firm

Please get back to me ASAP with any comments or questions, including any 
feedback on the degree of "strategic fit" this position would provide us.  
Ed, I could especially use some gas expertise in scrubbing down the gas piece 
and to make sure our gas curves are in the market (some miscellaneous 
customer feedback I've gotten suggests our Northeast gas numbers are a bit 
off).  Thanks all

John

I just  spoke to Jeff and he is interested in talking to you.  He saw your 
name on some kind of list for "redeployment" and asked if I knew you.   The 
job is in his fundamental analysis group.  He wants you to send your resume 
today.

Hey Peter, Could you pass this on to the proper person. For the past week or
so, we've been getting some very low prices from Enron in the San Juan
Basin. The non-Bondad and Bondad price have been the same, and non-Bondad
been very much below the rest of the market especially considering the
volume reported. Today, I understand you posted a 4.145 for your online
trading average. You reported 4.07 for 600,000 to us. What gives? Thanks. T

Louise,

I received the attached questions from Gas Daily regarding our disaster 
preparedness.

Jeff Shankman asked me to forward them to you.  I would also be interested to 
know what disaster plans have been made for EOL .

Thanks

The main issue that I see with the description you sent me is the same one 
that we spoke about a few weeks ago.  

 What should the consistent market convention for determining the first 
tranaction be?  If we use the current NG trading convention we will quote the 
premium swap as the "first transaction"  and the discount as the second.  
This will present consistency problems if we are trading near parity in the 
calendar with different months changing position in the curve. You just have 
to look at some of the summer spreads to see the confusion that may result.  
Having the near dated swap as the first transaction in all cases would 
eliminate that issue but will not match the current trading convention.  I 
will check with John to see if he has any opinion on the matter.  The product 
description would have to be written such that any customer would be easily 
be able to determine the correct direction to trade.  

I will discuss this and the entire description with John on Tues. and get 
back to you .

Thanks 

Pete

oh how the truth hurts. As a Texas resident i can tell you that Bush is by 
far the worse of these two evils.  Never has a more expensive suit been 
filled by such cheap intellect (or lack thereof).  But as usual whoever is 
elected will make no difference anyway.

Sorry guys, I was on vacation yesterday.  Here are the photos.  Some of you 
have asked......the furniture is four years old.  My husband and I both work 
outside the home, so it has really just been used to surf the internet and do 
family finances.  It is in great condition.  Come over any evening or weekend 
and see for yourself.  We still like it, but we have to give up our study to 
make room for the twins we are expecting in September!  Mima, I would prefer 
to keep all the pieces together, but I may consider selling the bookcase 
separately, I'll let you know.

Thanks,
Kate

Dale,

To follow up on our conversation, our only problem is in the short 
description. We would like to make in simpler. 

Possibly  reading  " Gas Daily Index" as the product type

Also it seems that the long description in product manager  that we approve 
while  copying  a product does not match the long description after the 
product is created ???

Kyle is doing fine. Larry is doing pretty well.  We are actually buying Z6 
vol for the first time in years.  

As far as the rest of the stuff I am so far outside the loop on these things 
my desk has a different zip code.

Subject: Focus Group with traders -- EnronOnline Commercial

As per our conversation today, I am helping Enron's ad agency develop a 
television commercial about EnronOnline.  Their creative team would like to 
meet with a few Enron traders to learn first hand about what traders like, 
dislike, what motivates them, their work environment, etc.  This will help us 
make the commercial more realistic.  Would you or a couple of traders in your 
team be able to attend a focus group next Tuesday, March 21st from 11:45 to 1 
p.m. in the Enron Building? I'll send you the meeting room info. later.  We 
will serve lunch.  Please let me know.  Your input will be very useful in 
creating an effective ad.

i don't think our rosters have a good trade match because i'm sure you are 
not ready to deal Davis and Robinson. Ricky was my # 1 pick for a reason and 
Warrick is the only decent receiver in Cin.  the two guys you are offering 
are not top players.

Louise,

Those numbers are impressive without a doubt.  The success has had the 
unfortunate consequence of showing the limits of our current internet 
technology.  The delays in messages from the stacks to the website have 
gotten worse in recent weeks.  This is only anecdotal evidence but as a 
trader on the system it has been very frustrating.  


Regards, 

Pete Keavey

Please approve my authorization request for control over daily and monthly  
basis products on enrononline.  
I will need these products available for management on my stack manager. I 
currently cannot access basis products on my stack manager.  They were 
removed to facilitate timely messaging updates between my stack and the 
website.  
I will be managing monthly and daily  basis products for the East Desk.   I 
will also be retaining my management of gas daily products for the east desk.
I will be managing these products as of 10/2/2000.

Please call id there anre any problems

Thanks for the note.  

Will I be able to cover the child from the time when we get leal custody?  
There will be a time lag possibly up to a year until the adoption will be 
final .

Thanks you,

Is it possible that the Gas Daily swaps that you set up for the west are not 
mapped for our other gas dailly locations??

That may be the cause of some of our confusion

The gas group would like to roll out some new products and new locations for 
existing products in the next few weeks. 
The new products are Gas Daily and Physical index trades. I know that the Gas 
Daily products currently exist but the long and short descriptions need some 
work. 
I should have a list of new locations shortly.

Please let me know who I need to work with to make each of these things 
happen.  

Thanks,

Pete

Subject: Focus Group with traders -- EnronOnline Commercial

As per our conversation today, I am helping Enron's ad agency develop a 
television commercial about EnronOnline.  Their creative team would like to 
meet with a few Enron traders to learn first hand about what traders like, 
dislike, what motivates them, their work environment, etc.  This will help us 
make the commercial more realistic.  Would you or a couple of traders in your 
team be able to attend a focus group next Tuesday, March 21st from 11:45 to 1 
p.m. in the Enron Building? I'll send you the meeting room info. later.  We 
will serve lunch.  Please let me know.  Your input will be very useful in 
creating an effective ad.

US Gas

Liquidity

EOL has allowed Enron to simultaneously provide internal and external 
customers with realtime  markets in many of the physical and financial 
products that we trade.  The ability of all customers to execute trades and 
receive instantaneous confimations has resulted in rapidly growing volumes 
and growing customer participation.  One of the benefits of this system is to 
allow all customers access to the market prices rather than being funnelled 
through third party brokers.  

Enron has committed to providing both depth of volume and tight bid/offer 
spreads. This committment has been main driver of the growth in volume since 
rollout last Nov.29.


Transparency

The existence of our two way market has removed all doubt about the firmness 
of bids and offers.  We will trade on the price and volume on our bid and 
offer.   The growing volumes over our system has lessened our dependance on 
the sometimes unreliable broker served market.  Many of our customers and 
competitors now use EOL as an information source as well as a trading 
vehicle.  EOL is the only service that provides free real time information on 
as many traded markets in the physical and financial worlds.  We have no 
competition in this regard.  This aspect of EOL has been helpful to the 
smaller customers that are not primarily trading operations.  

Deal Flow

As the market maker on this system we do derive some tangible trading 
benefits.  We are collecting the bid/offer spread on our transactions and 
over time this results in a direct bottom line benefit.    Enron's market 
share of financial tranactions will also increase overtime as we have become 
the easiest and most reliable way to transact in the market.
