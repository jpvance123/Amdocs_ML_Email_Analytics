 Richard,

My wife Marilyn does research for our law firm on a part time basis, and I
have had her do a couple of projects on the NSM cases:  she worked a lot on
the contribution/indemnity memo that I sent you a few weeks ago, and more
recently she prepared a memorandum on the law concerning whether a non-lead
underwriter can make a separate "reasonable care" showing under our state
securities law even where the lead underwriter may not be able successfully to
carry its own burden of reasonable care.  Marilyn's memorandum on this subject
is attached.  This memorandum also surveys the cases on who is a "seller"
under the state law.

These issues, ECT Securities' own reasonable care and ECT's not having sold
NSM securities to plaintiffs, will all be key points in our Memorandum of
Contentions of Fact and Law now under preparation and, if we get a motion for
summary judgment, will form the principal elements of our opposition to the
motion.

Steve

Richard, looks like a new case for your group.   I would be glad to introduce 
you to John.  He has been recommended to me by others before, but as you know 
my businesses only get sued in Curitiba and San Salvador, and I didn't want 
to visit that on him.

Bob,

I came across this new federal filing on case stream that I thought you might 
want to know about.  It looks like a breach of contract case filed against 
ECT and ENA in Judge Hoyt's court.

Let us know if you need any assistance with the defense of this matter as we 
would love to have the opportunity to show you our capabilities.  I've done 
some work for the litigation unit, but none yet for ECT or ENA.  From my 
previous conversations with Jim Derrick, I understand that we are approved 
for general litigation matters.  Also, I'd love the opportunity to work with 
you and/or Richard Sanders.

Best Regards,

John

P.S.

I saw that you and Elaine got your tree this weekend.  We are still on our 
quest for a tree after striking out at four different places yesterday.  
Where did you find yours?

Here is a proposed modification of the indemnification language based on our 
telephone conversation earlier today:

5. Indemnification. Company represents that it is a successor corporation to 
Enron Milford, Inc. and that the Certificate of Incorporation of Enron 
Milford, Inc. on file in the Division of Corporations Files of the Secretary 
of State, State of Delaware, applies to Company.  Company further represents 
that it will act in good faith in investigating and making a determination 
with respect to any claim for indemnification made by Consultant pursuant to 
the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation should an indemnifiable 
event arise.

Let me know what you think.  Thanks.

As you know we're in the process of trying to close a transaction to sell 
substantially all of the assets of Ecogas to Pacific Natural Energy.  As part 
of the process, and in order to close, we have to settle over 80 account 
payables issues (totaling > $4.7MM).  Several of these are law firms which 
were representing or had represented Ecogas.  They are as follows:

Bracewell Patterson
Locke Liddell
Millbank Tweed
V&E
Fulbright & Jaworski

It was my understanding the ENA Legal had discussed the payment (or lack 
thereof) issues with these firms.  However, I'm getting calls from them (F&J 
and Millbank Tweed, so far) now that they've received the Creditor Settlement 
& Release Agreement which was sent to them last Friday and they're acting 
very surprised!

I need to know who should interface w/ these firms and that these issues are 
being settled.  We will need to address this among other issues tomorrow 
morning at our 9 a.m. meeting.

I recommend reading CAISO's response.  This letter was reported in last 
week's trade press.

I am told that BPA does not consider this letter confidential even though it 
is labeled as such by CAISO.

Many of the  CAISO "backpedal" statements made re: claims of strategic 
bidding would apply equally to other importers.

Any merit to mentioning that there has been an initial "supply" response in

Recognizing the time constraints you face, I've tried to 1) clear up a few 
inaccuracies and 2) massage some of the sharper language without taking a 
chainsaw to the otherwise good job.

Privileged and Confidential Joint Defense Communication

To:      Grynberg JDT
From:  Don Schultz
Re:      Template Answer

           The Coordinating Counsel Committee has asked me to solicit 
proposals for a firm to draft and circulate a template answer to the Grynberg 
complaints.   Analysis and drafting of affirmative defenses should be more 
cost effective for everyone if one firm develops a template.  There may also 
be fact allegations, e.g. those respecting scientific propositions, where 
efficiency and consistency can be promoted by use of a template.   I suggest 
we aim to have the template available for circulation and comments by June 
20th.  The separate counsel for individual defendants would retain the 
responsibility for the sufficiency of the answers filed for their clients.   
If your law firm is interested in undertaking this scope of work, please send 
me a very brief proposal to describe how you would staff this and an estimate 
of the fees involved, for review by the Coordinating Counsel Committee.

What was the average price or the high and low price?

I asked him to if FERC wa asking other market participants.  He said more and 
more every day and they would continue this until prices started going down.  
I asked him if the Commission intended to keep this information 
confidential.  He said he didn't know.  Christi - could you work with Phillip 
on this?  Bill's number is (202) 208-1268.

Julie,  I'm working with Legal and Bob Surles with Lynx Energy Company on 
some pricing issues regarding meter 6677.  I have verified with Bob Fischer 
in the Transport Group the transportation rates that HPLC is paying to Gulf 
Coast Pipeline Company, which in turn must be paid to HPLC by Lynx Energy.   
Would you please change Sitara to reflect the transportation rates shown on

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL: SUBJECT TO ATTORNEY CLIENT AND OTHER PRIVILEGES

Mark:

I assume that you and Richard are very familiar with the day-to-day 
developments in the heavily publicized FERC case involving the investigation 
by FERC of El Paso's sale of pipeline capacity into the CA market to its 
merchant arm last year that CA officials have partly blamed for the spike in 
gas and power prices.  As you know, this is the case where the highest 
executives of El Paso recently were called to testify at FERC.

An article in this morning's New York Times (which begins on page 1), in 
discussing El Paso's significant earnings generated by the El Paso merchant 
arm from the pipeline capacity purchase, says that the parties with which El 
Paso hedged its position also made sizeable profits.  The article notes that 
about half of El Paso's trades were with Enron "according to people present 
at the briefings El Paso officials have given to California officials."  
While this probably is not surprising in light of our size and breadth in the 
market, it nonetheless is made to sound somewhat sinister, and my sense is 
that it is just another potential barb for the CA officials to throw at us.  
Since the article quotes a response from Mark Palmer (in which he suggests 
that Enron, in turn, likely would have resold the capacity and would not have 
realized the benefit of the rising market), I assumed that you were aware of 
it, but I thought I would err on the side of putting an extra e-mail in your 
in-box.

Subject: SCE Motion for Supoena to MSC


On December, SCE filed a motion with FERC in which it request FERC to issue
a subpoena for the production of documentary evidence to the ISO's Market
Surveillance Committee.  The subpoena seeks information related to the
exercise of market power

While FERC's regulations allow 15 days to file an answer to motion, I
recommend that we file a response as soon as possible if this is something
that we either wish to oppose or have conditions established.

I an having a copy of the motion and subpoena faxed to you.  Ron

EOB Developments (Peter Meringolo)
On December 4, 2000, the Electricity Oversight Board ("EOB") issued a
subpoena to the ISO.  (The EOB previously issued a subpoena to the ISO on
July 20, 2000).  The 12/4/2000 subpoena seeks data related to, among other
things:  actual transmission flow; scheduled outages; out-of-sequence calls;
schedules, forecasts, and reserve information for Day Ahead and Hour Ahead;
Ancillary Service bids; and information related to BEEP calls.

 It is my understanding that Enron must inform the ISO on Monday,
December 11 whether or not it has any concerns with regard to
confidentiality.

 The Chief Counsel of the EOB has stated that it "will maintain the
confidentiality of individual market participant information that reflects
proprietary business practices and that has been identified as confidential
when submitted" to the EOB.  The EOB can disclose to the PUC and AG if they
agree to maintain confidentiality.

 This raises two questions:

 (1) Will the ISO be producing data that reflects Enron's
"proprietary business practices?"

 (2)  If so, who makes the confidentiality designation:  Enron or
ISO?  In other words, does Enron intend to rely on the ISO's confidentiality
designations, or should Enron seek an opportunity to review the data in
order to make its own decisions regarding confidentiality before the
production?

 To date, Enron has not objected to these requests from the various
agencies investigating the electricity market.  We believe the same strategy
should be followed here.  In other words, this does not appear to be a
battle worth fighting.

Calendar Dates

 Here is a summary of the immediate calendar dates:

12/4   Complaint Served
12/14  Last day for plaintiff to exercise preemptory challenge
12/14  Plaintiff may commence discovery by interrogatories, request for
production or    request for  admissions
12/26  First day for plaintiff to serve notice of deposition
1/3/01 Last Day to plead in response to complaint

Note: If Enron's first appearance is on 1/3/01, then the last date to file a
preemptory challenge for Enron will be within 10 days after first appearance
or 1/12/01.
1/29/01 Last day for plaintiff to serve complaint and file proof of servicre
4/30/01 Last day to hold case management conference.

Investigation Report Materials

They have been sent for Saturday delivery at the addresses indicated.

Thanks

 I have today spoken with Dean Vanek, Scottsboro's general counsel, and 
advised him that subject to confirmation that all the loads on which Alabama 
Carriers is suing are our loads, Enron Metals intends to indemnify and defend 
Scottsboro.  I told him that our plan is to retain his usual attorneys to ask 
for an extension of time within which Scottsboro should answer, so as to see 
whether ICTS will do the right thing and pay off.  If they won't, I told 
Vanek our plan to was to have his attorneys negotiate the best possible 
settlement.

 Vanek told me that Scottsboro had sent all available information to our 
Montreal office and that we should check there to confirm that all these 
loads were ours.  Michelin has kindly agreed to handle this task, and will 
try to get back to me tomorrow morning.  I left a message to this effect with 
Vanek.

 Once this has been done, I will be sending a letter to Scottsboro regarding 
defense and indemnification.

Bruce MacLeod at Hennigan's firm has informed me that plaintiffs will NOT file
a summary judgment motion against ECT Securities.

Also, next week Ralph Hellmold will be deposed on 6/13 and 6/14, but we will
not be expected to produce McGrath until July.

Question:  Do we want to pay McGrath to attend Hellmold's deposition on 6/13
and 6/14 to help me out (and maybe keep Hellmold a little more honest by his
presence in the room)?

Richard --

I was wondering if Enron had any formal policies on the release of 
information?  This is promoted by a call we had from Rep. Waxman's office.  
The Rep would like a copy of the 4 page handout that Lay gave to key 
California Republican leaders in a "private" meeting in Beverly Hills 
reported in the LA Times recently.

I think that we are going to give this information to Rep. Waxman's office, 
but we probably want a formal policy (ie, written) that would allow our 
legislative professionals in DC and elsewhere to say that some info is public 
and can be provided and other info will not be released.

Appreciate your help.

Jim

As you know there are several litigations pending against Ecogas, EZ Products 
and/or Enron (or a combination) which could be problematic to our current 
strategy of selling the assets to PNE.  They are as follows (with 
comments/status provided):

Wisvest - both PNE and Ecogas are working towards a settlement/restructuring 
which will include them releasing Ecogas from all obligations and dismissal 
of their pending suit.  We're trying to get this completed prior to closing.
Tom Hall - Ecogas owes Tom $41K (Tom says $46K) for which we've offered to 
settle with thim pari-passu with all other creditors at 50 c/$ ($21K).  He 
has rejected the offer and is planning to move forward with depositions, 
etc...  Our plan per my conversation w/ Lisa yesterday is to escrow the money 
($21K) we offered in the Settlement sent to him last Friday, 12/1.
Lyon Credit/United Hudson Bank - I am trying to contact them to see if I can 
get them to either dismiss the suit or settle for $25K or less.
WMI/Davis St. - Richard is supposed to be contacting WMI's legal to discuss.
Victoria Sterling - I am trying to contact her to see if she'll settle for 
$25K or less.
ISCO (has sued EZ Products, Ecogas and Enron) - Richard is supposed to 
contact their legal counsel to discuss merits of suing Enron.

Is there anything else we should be doing to mitigate potential problems if 
we can't get any of them to settle/dismiss their suits?  Who is handling 
responses, filings, pleadings, etc... for each of these cases while they're 
status is uncertain?  Currently, we have no counsel re: Victoria Sterling and 
ISCO.  I'm not sure who's doing what on Wisvest, Tom Hall or Lyon Credit.  
Previously, Milbank Tweed was handling WMI but I haven't seen or heard of 
anything being done so I'm not sure about this either.

Doug Daniels at Bracewell has encouraged us on several occasions to run our 
strategy by bankruptcy counsel in the event they won't settle and end up 
putting Ecogas into bankruptcy.  Per my discussion with Lisa yesterday, she 
does not feel the cost is warranted.

I see no problem in obtaining a signature to the Statement currently drafted 
for
Eric Tan.  It is his evidence after all and I doubt if there will be much
substance to change.  We can keep it in our files as a privileged document
without any obligation to disclose it.  When we are firmly into the 
proceedings,
we shall have to think about disclosing a Statement of Eric Tan if that is 
what
we want to do.  It may be, as the case develops, we will want to either delete
or add to the Statement by asking more questions.  For this purpose, it is a
good idea to remain in contact with Eric Tan.  I do not think we need to have
anything as formal as a consulting agreement.  It is just important that one
person makes sure that we know where Eric Tan is at all times in the event 
that
we need to contact him.

In the meantime, SRT are going to appoint a UK chemist and are pressing
Mitsubishi very hard now for formal consent to the release of the samples.  I
think I shall firm up on the appointment of the arbitrator (now agreed to by
SRT) when we have the decision on the samples.  Obviously I have pointed out
again on the telephone the potential shelf life problem.

Regards,
David Best.

Andrew,

Dan Rogers and I have spoken with Wayne Perry, who is the Enron contact for 
the negotiations with Exmar.  He was unaware of this arbitration and believes 
that his contacts with Exmar are similarly unaware of it.  Perry will be in 
London Wednesday for a conference with Exmar and wants to bring this 
arbitration to Exmar's attention, in the hopes that it can be quickly 
resolved on a business relationship basis.

At your earliest convenience, would you please e-mail (my first choice) or 
telefax (my second choice) to me an executive summary of this matter 
(something very succinct, preferably in very easily readable bullet-point 
format) with (1) facts, (2) status, (3) best points worst/points, and (4) 
recovery/exposure briefly outlined?  Also, would you please advise me who our 
opposing solicitor is, and his or her firm?  Last, if you are aware of the 
name of the primary Exmar in-house lawyer or business person on this matter.

For this information to have the maximum impact, I need to have it in Perry's 
hands before he meets with Exmar, and the sooner before, the better.  Perry 
knows that he is not to hand this information over to Exmar, although if you 
wanted (and have the time) to make a second executive summary specifically 
for him to give to Exmar, that would be fine as well.   

Many thanks for your prompt response.  Again, my hope is to try to get this 
thing dismissed by year-end.

Britt

		 Subject: In re M/V SANTA CLARA

Andrew,

This will confirm our telephone conference of yesterday.  Again, I will be 
your new contact at Enron in the above-referenced case.  You advised that 
Exmar, the disponent owner of the M/V SANTA CLARA, has made a demurrage claim 
against EGLI, who fixed the charter with Exmar, of  approximately $165,000, 
arising out of the loading of a cargo of propane on the ship in March of 
1991.  You also advised that EGLI has a counterclaim for recovery of 
deadfreight in the amount of approximately $150,000.  This matter has 
reportedly been only sporadically active over the many years since the claims 
were made, and is now ready to be set for an arbitration date.

You mentioned that Exmar's attorney had been unresponsive to your suggestion 
that the parties just drop their respective claims.  I understand that you 
feel this may be due to Exmar's attorney, rather than his client.  You 
further mentioned that you have read that some Enron entity is or has in the 
recent past entered into charters with Exmar.

It makes no sense for Enron and Exmar to pursue this matter further, given 
what you have told me.  My plan is to confirm that Enron has in fact a 
business relationship with Exmar that would allow us to go forward with a 
"drop hands" settlement.  If you retained the publication in which you read 
about the recent charters, I would ask that you send it to me immediately.  
Since I don't yet have the file from my clients, please also send me the 
correct spelling of Exmar's name at your earliest convenience.

By copy of this e-mail, I am asking everyone who I can think of whether they 
know if any Enron entity has (or has had in the recent past) a ship under 
charter to Exmar.  If one of you can suggest other names I might check, 
please let me know.  I would like to put this old dog out of its misery 
before year end if it is humanly possible to do so.

Britt

Yes, McGrath is off.  (MacLeod does not want to formally cancel the
deposition--posturing about the trial date-but he has assured me that he does
not really expect McGrath to start on 6/14.  I do not intend to prepare
McGrath  for any examination until July.  He may or may not attend Hellmold's
deposition to assist me.  So for your planning purposes, if not "for the
record," McGrath is off.) Are the two of you available for McGrath's 
deposition in the 7/9-7/12 time
frame?  I want to get the schedule pinned down right away, because we don't
have many dates to work with.

Could the three of us talk at 5:00 pm east coast time TODAY?  Are you in your
respective offices or traveling?

I can talk today or Monday, and I'll be at Malashevich tomorrow. Does this
mean that McGrath is definitely off for June 14th? And by the way, everybody
fears Frank.

Bruce, is it OK if I notice Hellmold's deposition on 6/13-14 for your
offices??

By now you should see that Mr. Hellmold's second report is a 50-page
single-spaced document consisting primarily of argument of plaintiff's
entire
case and written obviously by MacLeod, not Hellmold.  MacLeod told me last
night that, by virtue of the length and breadth of this second report,
MacLeod
expects the two of you, in addition to me, to have extensive questions, that
he does not intend to argue that you "finished" your questions in the first
two-day session of Hellmold's deposition, and that he expects Hellmold's
deposition to take up all or substantially all of 6/14 as well as 6/13.

We should probably talk live among the three of us about coordinating our
approach to this deposition.  By the way, I have it on very good authority
that Hellmold fears Frank and is not relishing the prospect of further
questions from him.   (I can fill you in.)

		 Subject: AB 2xx passes fiscal cmte

In a hearing off the Floor this afternoon, the Assembly Appropriations 
Committee voted on a partisan basis (14-7) to pass AB 2xx (Corbett), which 
would enact a gross receipts tax on power generators.  Please note that three 
amendments were adopted by the author:  (1) exempt state contracts (not all 
long-term contracts like SB 1xx does) and the taxpayer would have to go to 
DWR for this exemption; (2) taxpayer would get a credit for any similar tax 
paid in another state (assuming other states will actually enact windfall 
profits tax bills; (3) PUC will adjust the base price quarterly (rather than 
"from time-to-time").
Next stop is the Assembly Floor, planned for Thursday morning.

Dear Jessie,

expire on 8/31/01.  We are required to advise the beneficiary by 6/1/01 in
case of non renewal.

Could you please let us have your instructions?

Thanks and regards,

Richard

Following our meeting I have been discussing the voice recording requirements 
with other members of the project team, and I need to correct one piece of 
information I supplied to you. 

Regarding the recording of internal calls, it is possible to not record calls 
made on the Lucent digital phones internally, but ALL calls made on turrets 
(the phones the traders use) would have to be recorded, whether internal or 
external. This is due to the way in which the voice recording system must be 
connected to the turret system. Therefore, could you assume when considering 
what the corporate requirements are that we cannot exclude internal calls. 

My apologies for this mistake, we are going to investigate the development of 
a solution to this problem with the vendors under consideration. I will keep 
you in touch with all progress that is made. 

Many thanks for your time this morning. 

Regards

Stuart Fieldhouse

I talked to Claudia about this and she says that she has not seen it since we 
found it some two months ago and gave you the only executed copy we could 
find.  We checked with the vault to see if they had a copy.  They do not.  I 
searched your green files and miscellaneous papers in your office -- all to 
no avail.  Can you remember what you did with the copy I gave you?

Dear John:

Thank you for your prompt response regarding the matter.
I have received you mail asking me to call you and I have reached Mr. Randy 
Pais.

According to the discussed with him, please be informed that Mr. Arap 
Sobrinho  as delegate manager in EPCB articles of association is able to sign 
both the company representative letter, as well as the power of attorney to 
Tozzini Freire.

It is important to clarify that Ms. Cunha shall be representing EPCB in 
court, since the labor action has been filed against both EPCB and EPE and 
not SCC.

Unfortunately, these documents have to be filed before court in their 
originals. Mr. Pais has requested me to fax me a copy of the signed power of 
attorney as soon as I have it.

As regards the correspondence regarding this matter, I am already copying all 
of the people mentioned by you.

Should you need any further assistance in connection with the matter, please 
advise.

Best regards,
Ana Paula Gon?alves

>>> <John.Schwartzenburg@enron.com> 15/05/01 20:32 >>>


Ana Paula, thanks for keeping after me on this.

We have decided to rely on Ms. Cunha as the company representative to be
present in court. This will avoid the need for an official, court appointed
tramslator. She will be supported by Randy Pais, Nate Neuman or others as
needed either from Houston or traveling to Brazil as needed. The SCC expat
presence in Brazil will be greatly diminished in the next several weeks.

Please copy Ms. Cunha  Mr. Randy Pais and Mr. Richard Sanders on all
correspondence related to this matter. Randy Pais is the internal
transactional lawyer at EEOS/SCC working the Cuiaba project; Richard
Sanders is the internal litigation management lawyer at Enron Wholesale who
supports our business unit.

I want to make sure I understand what is meant by the power of attorney and
company representative letter. Are these the documents that appoint Ms.
Cunha as the SCC company representative for the purposes of this matter?
Sami,  if this is right I would have no objections for you signing these
documents, but you don't have any position with SCC. Weren't these to be
give n to Nate Neuman for him to have executed at the SCC office in Cuiaba?

Ana Paula, is it possible to e-mail or fax the documents to us here, and
for us to signand fax back, or does the court need originals?

Dear John:

Reference is made to our mail dated as of May 11th, 2001, in order to
inform you that, according to understandings held with Ms. Daniele Cunha,
the power of attorney and the company representative letter related to the
labor action filed by Luiz Alexandre Zago has already been forwarded to Mr.
Sami Arap Sobrinho.

Taking into account the fact that Mr. Arap Sobrinho shall only sign the
above mentioned documents with your express consent, we kindly request you
to contact him regarding the issue, the sooner the possible. In fact, we
will appreciate if you could contact him tomorrow, so that the documents
may be filed at the labor court within the established deadline.

Since Ms. Daniele Cunha shall be functioning as the company representative
at this case, I would like to know if she may be copied of all of the
exchanged mail regarding the matter.

At last, we await your guidance as to whom shall the legal fees billing
related to this case be addressed to.

Best regards,
APG

Privileged and confidential

Dear John:

The purpose of this mail is to provide you with the term of the hearing at
court, copy attached hereto, which took place on May 07th, 2001, at the
labor action filed by Luis Alexandre Zago, occasion in which the written
defense has been presented by EPCB, copy also attached hereto.

According to such a hearing term, it has been designated a discovery
hearing at court for May 30th, 2001, at 3 p.m., occasion in which a company
representative of EPCB, with his employee booklet (CTPS), shall attend the
hearing, as well as up to three witnesses  that may be able to testify
favorably to EPCB.

In this sense, below please find the subject over which evidence shall be
produced by EPCB at such a discovery hearing:

i) that EPE hired the Superior Construction Company in order to build the
thermo electric plant;

ii) that the Superior Construction Company has entered into a re-hiring
agreement with the Siemens Ltda. company in order to build the thermo
electric plant, company which, in its turn, has hired the ENESA company for
such a purpose;

iii) that the Superior Construction Company has used EPCB in order to
diligence in the sense that the thermo electric plant building was been
performed in accordance with the hired by and between the EPE and Superior
Company Construction companies;

iv) that the claimant was an employee of the ENESA company; that ENESA
company paid the employee's salaries; that EPE and EPCB have never
contacted the claimant; that the ENESA company was the responsible for the
selection of the professionals that it understood as necessary for the
services compliance; that it was up to ENESA company to give commands to
the claimant; that it was ENESA company that determined  the services to be
performed by the claimant.

We would also like to inform that it has been determined by the court the
deadline of 15 days for EPCB to present at the case files (i) its articles
of associations; (ii) power of attorney and (iii) company representative
letter. For such, we kindly request that such documents, duly certified, be
forwarded directly to our local correspondent attorney in Cuiab? - Ms.
Luciana Cristina Pereira Cardoso, at the address, Av. Historiador Rubens de
Mendon?a, 1836, sala 905, bairro Bosque da Sa?de, Cuiab?, MT, up till May
18th, 2001, so that we may present them at the case files in the stipulated
deadline.

Also, we would like to stress that in case EPCB decides to indicate a
company representative that has not the Portuguese as his mother language
to attend the hearing at court, it will be necessary to request court the
indication of a public sworn translator. Therefore, we kindly request you
to inform us, up till May 21st, 2001, if such will be needed so that we may
take the necessary measures in this regard in time.

We do clarify, however, that we find it unnecessary the attendance of a
foreign company representative in the extent that Ms. Daniele Cunha, who
attended the first hearing at court, has shown enough and necessary
knowledge in order to function as company representative at the present
case.

At last, please advise as to whom shall the legal fees billing related to
this case be addressed to.

Please contact us should you need any further clarification on the above.

Best regards,
Ana Paula Gon?alves.

P.S. Please advise should you need a free translation of both the term of
the hearing, as well as of the written defense presented by EPCB in the
case.

Bruce, is it OK if I notice Hellmold's deposition on 6/13-14 for your
offices??

By now you should see that Mr. Hellmold's second report is a 50-page
single-spaced document consisting primarily of argument of plaintiff's entire
case and written obviously by MacLeod, not Hellmold.  MacLeod told me last
night that, by virtue of the length and breadth of this second report, MacLeod
expects the two of you, in addition to me, to have extensive questions, that
he does not intend to argue that you "finished" your questions in the first
two-day session of Hellmold's deposition, and that he expects Hellmold's
deposition to take up all or substantially all of 6/14 as well as 6/13.

We should probably talk live among the three of us about coordinating our
approach to this deposition.  By the way, I have it on very good authority
that Hellmold fears Frank and is not relishing the prospect of further
questions from him.   (I can fill you in.)

Please feel free to utilize the equipment and if you need assistance  feel

Michel,

I have your urgent message below.  This is the first that I have heard that 
you needed two originals to file.  Luckily, I have an extra set of originals, 
which I will tonight give to Federal Express to courier to Bernard's office, 
assuming that the jets are flying despite the freezing weather/sleet that is 
expected in Houston tonight.  If the jets are flying, I assume that Bernard 
will get the originals by Thursday.

I would appreciate Bernard's office advising me by the close of business in 
Paris Thursday whether they have received this package.

Parenthetically, I repeat my two prior requests that I be advised as soon as 
possible what qualifications are necessary for a liquidator, so that we can 
speedily substitute someone in and for the place of John Echols, who has 
signed the originals we are now using only with my promise that we would 
speedily find a substitute.  Based on Bernard's advice, I told Echols that 
this could be done within 60 days.  Echols signed the documents on December 
5.  I accordingly anticipate that you and Bernard will be working with me to 
get the substitution accomplished by no later than Monday, February 5, 2001.  
I have made myself personally responsible to my clients that this will be 
accomplished timely.  

Britt

Privileged and Confidential Joint Defense Communication

From:  Don Schultz
To:     All Grynberg JDT Participants
Re:     Reply to Grynberg letter requesting discovery.

           Thanks to Doug Robinson's good thinking and writing (once again), 
I have set out below a draft letter to Judge Downes in response to Phil 
Figa's letter seeking limited discovery.   The Coordinating Counsel Committee 
and Original Source Committee have provided input to this draft, and plan to 
meet again by conference call early this afternoon.  Please email 
ddavis@hollandhart.com or dschultz@hollandhart.com to provide written 
feedback on this draft before 2:00 p.m. Central time.  Two logistics notes:  
1.  Judge Downes has granted us until close of business Thursday to deliver 
this letter to him, but he expects the Grynberg defendants to coordinate/ 
consolidate input -  please work through the committee to avoid separate 
submissions;  2.  This letter likely will be executed by Mike Beatty on 
behalf of the Coordinated Defendants, but can certainly be modified to show 
support by other/all defendants as appropriate;


        Re:    In re Natural Gas Royalties Qui Tam Litigtion, MDL Docket No. 
1293, All Cases

Dear Judge Downes:

        The Coordinated Defendants in the Grynberg cases respond as follows 
to the Court's invitation to submit comments on discovery issues related to 
the Government's motion to dismiss portions of the Grynberg complaints:

        First, the Coordinated Defendants' silence, as a group, regarding the 
Government's motion to dismiss should not be viewed as an indication that we 
believe the Government's motion lacks merit.  The Defendants have simply been 
at a disadvantage in presenting their views because the Government's motion 
is in large measure dependent upon facts, such as the adequacy of the 
submissions Grynberg made to the Government, not known to the Defendants (due 
in part, as discussed below, to Grynberg's failure to serve the Defendants 
with materials he has submitted to the Court).

        The Coordinated Defendants remain of one mind, however, in their 
belief that all of the Grynberg complaints should be dismissed for the 
entirely separate reasons that they are improperly pled under Fed. R. Civ. 
Proc. 9(b) and fail to state a claim under Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 12(b)(6).  The 
Coordinated Defendants are also united in their belief that consideration of 
the Government's motion should not take precedence over the Coordinated 
Defendants' pending motion to dismiss.  We were thus pleased to learn at the 
status conference on December 7, 2000 and from the Court's Order Following 
Status Conference that the Court proceeding ahead with a ruling on the 
Defendants' pending motions to dismiss without regard to other pending 
matters.

        Specifically with regard to Grynberg's position on discovery, as 
outlined in Mr. Figa's letter to the Court on December 8, 2000, we feel 
compelled to point out that the Grynberg request for discovery has 
implications far beyond the narrow issues raised by the government's motion 
to dismiss.  Grynberg essentially is requesting discovery on whether he or 
Wright is the proper relator on royalty valuation claims.  See Dec. 8 letter 
at 2-3.  While Grynberg is not necessarily volunteering to open himself up to 
discovery on whether he is the original source of the information he claims 
to have given to Wright's attorneys, he is specifically asking for public 
disclosure/original source discovery from Wright, and certainly the discovery 
Grynberg is seeking may well overlap discovery on whether he himself was the 
original source.

        In light of this fact, we remind the Court that the Coordinated 
Defendants have, with the Court's concurrence, delayed seeking discovery on 
and filing their own public disclosure/original source motion until the Court 
has ruled on the pending motions to dismiss the Grynberg complaints and, if 
necessary, any subsequent constitutional challenges to the Grynberg 
complaints.  That orderly progression should not be upset by the sudden 
intrusion of the Government's motion and Grynberg's request for discovery.  
Therefore, if the Court should decide that some discovery between and among 
Grynberg, Wright and the Government is appropriate to resolve the limited 
issues raised by the Government's motion to dismiss, we respectfully request 
that the Court make it abundantly clear that such discovery will in no way 
prejudice or restrict the right of the Defendants in the Grynberg cases to 
take their own discovery at the appropriate time (and assuming these cases 
have not previously been dismissed) on the public disclosure/original source 
issues.

        Finally, we respectfully request that, whether or not the Court 
grants Grynberg's request for discovery, it enter an order directing that any 
information produced in discovery or submitted to the Court in this case be 
provided to all parties alike.  This requirement is so fundamental that it 
ordinarily does not require an order of the Court to implement.  However, 
Grynberg has already submitted to this Court under seal documents that he 
claims support his position on the Government's motion to dismiss, and he has 
requested that the Clerk not make those documents available to the 
Defendants.  Absent direction to the contrary from the Court, the Clerk has 
thus far complied with Grynberg's request and denied the Defendants access to 
those documents.  This submission of documents to the Court by Mr. Gynberg is 
a clear violation of Fed. R. Civ. P. 5(a), which requires that all filings, 
with the limited exception of motions that the movant specifically requests 
be heard ex parte, be served on all parties.  If Grynberg truly has a 
legitimate reason for asking that the documents be placed under seal (such as 
that they contain proprietary information), the Defendants will happy to 
agree to an appropriate protective order restricting access to those 
documents.  But in no event should the Defendants be denied any access 
whatsoever to documents relevant to these cases.

        The Coordinated Defendants appreciate this opportunity to present 
these views to the Court.

                        Respectfully submitted,

Could you check with the telephonic IT group there and see if they can do

type of recording systems (London has the ability to record every single 
conversation in or out of the building).

I am drafting a note to go out in the next Euroflash to launch the service

Thanks

Andy

Have you found anything out on this for the Houston and Singapore offices 
yet?  How would the Sydney office handle this?   Thanks for doing this for 
London.  Did the email go out telling traders how to do this?   Thanks Cindy

This is great news!!!  Can you handle sending this announcement as I assume 
this was an audit issue for the other trading groups as well!!

Also,  how can we get this same process in place for the Houston and 
Singapore offices??  They have the same issues on their audits.  Thanks you 
guys did a great job!!!!   Cindy

Subject: Recording Trades from made on Mobile phones  

Cindy,

We have some good news for you.  We have set up a number which can only be 
called from Enron Mobile phones (37373), when you dial this number you will 
hear dialtone.  The dialtone is coming from the phone system at Enron House, 
you are then able to dial exactly as if you were at your desk, ie dial '9' 
and the number you wish to reach.

All calls coming through this route will be recorded and can be retrieved by 
the telecoms team for playback / reference.

We have also ensured that external people cannot dial this number from 
outside the building by using 020 7783 7373.

Let me know if you want to issue a note as a General Announcement or whether 
you wish to handle the distribution of the number.

Regards,

Andy

Instead of providing a phone number could there be a short code or something 
that they do that in the background dials this number so no one gets access 
to this number?   I know that this is an issue in all of the offices with 
traders making deals on cell phones on unrecorded lines.  I do not want to do 
something that puts Enron at risk though.  Thanks Cindy

Subject: Re: Who should I talk to on this one?

Cindy,

We can provide a telephone number in the office which the traders can call 
from their mobile phone, they would then be offered dialtone from the 
telephone system and can then dial on to an external party.

The call would then be routed out from the office and would be subject the 
the normal recording criteria.

However I wouldn't recommend this approach as we are opening up an external 
gateway for people to use our telephone system, this would be unmetered and 
not secure. The potential for toll-fraud is something that we need to take 
into account.

Regards,

Andy Cowx

I'll ask Andy Cowx (Telecoms Manager) to investigate - my initial thoughts

If the traders do a deal from their cell phone, is there a way they can have 
that call routed back through the phones in the building so it gets done on a 
recorded line?  I know if you call someone and then dial some numbers it 
takes you to their cell phone.  Can it work backwards so they hit some 
numbers and it routes the call through the office?   This would help with 
some of our AA issues.  Thanks Cindy

The following article is from this afternoon's AP newswire: 

Energy wholesalers on PG&E committee accused of conflict 


Updated: June 1, 2001 - 2:26 p.m. 
SAN FRANCISCO -- Two of the same energy wholesalers accused of driving 
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. into bankruptcy with high power prices asked a 
federal bankruptcy judge Friday to let them keep selling electricity to the 
utility.

Critics say that could result in higher bills for ratepayers and less money 
for the rest of PG&E's creditors to share, if the wholesalers' high prices 
keep whittling away at the utility's remaining money.

"We certainly don't believe they should get a safe harbor order so that they 
can do what they've done in the past," said Irving Sulmeyer, an attorney 
representing the city and county of San Francisco.

Houston-based Enron Corp. and Dynegy Inc., like other power wholesalers, have 
denied gouging Californians on the price they pay for power.

On Friday, the two companies asked U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali to 
let them keep selling electricity to PG&E's customers via the state 
Department of Water Resources, which has bought electricity on PG&E's behalf 
since January.

Dynegy and Enron sit on the 11-member creditors committee that will play a 
huge role in how PG&E's fortunes are divided among the more than 50,000 
banks, energy companies and cities to whom the utility owes money.

The "safe harbor" would shield them from conflict of interest accusations. 
The committee members would be honor-bound not to share information with any 
branches of their companies able to profit from it.

"They want to be absolved in advance," Sulmeyer said. "What are they so 
concerned about if they're not doing anything wrong?"

Robert Moore, an attorney representing the voluntary creditors committee, 
said other committee members such as Bank of America and Merrill Lynch also 
are requesting safe harbors so they can continue trading stock and remain 
members.

"At least four members of the committee would have to resign without it," 
Moore told the judge.

Montali asked each committee member to file a declaration with the court 
requesting to trade either commodities (electricity) or securities (stock), 
and scheduled another hearing on the issue for June 12.

Linda,

Could you send the WFW bill down to me please?  I just changed admin 
assistants and my new a/a, Lee, could not find that in the file.  Richard 
wanted me to take a look and try to apportion it between his r/c and Alan's, 
given my statement to Richard that the WFW bill contains a lot of time that I 
(and I believe Matt shares this belief) was directed to resolution of the 
dispute with FGH.  

Britt

P.S. to Matt-- what do you think about asking Neale if he would take a look 
at that bill and apportion the time spent between the cargo claim versus the 
FGH matter?

 Our next step is to file a pleading with the Versailles Court of Appeals, 
which puts our spin on the Court-appointed expert's report.  

 The deadline for filing our pleading is next Friday, although we need to 
file it as early next week as possible, given that this is our third 
extension of time.

 I have reviewed Bernard Mettatal's draft, had him make changes, and think we 
hit the right points.

 In short, Interfert knew the Court was going to limit its recovery to 
commissions on deals it actively participated in with EGLE, Interfert had its 
shot at producing  information to support this position to the 
Court-appointed expert, but Interfert failed to do so.  
 
 Our brief prays for recovery for all of the preliminary award made to 
Interfert of 810,000 FF, and our attorneys' fees.

 A key issue is what the Court meant when it required that Interfert be 
actively involved in the deal.  The trial judge wasn't very specific.  We say 
it means Interfert had  to bring a real deal to us, not just introduce us to 
a purchaser at lunch.  

 Importantly, I just learned that a new judge will hear this case.  We don't 
know who it will be yet; the judges in France move around quite a bit.  I've 
got my fingers  crossed that Enron will get a better shake this time around.

 Given that this matter will not be set for hearing until March 2002, we may 
get a ruling on our appeal from the French Supreme Court before then.

 Let me know what else you need from me so I can authorize Mettatal to file 
our pleading.

 Thanks.

 Britt

Privileged and Confidential Joint Defense Communication
To:       Grynberg JDT Participants
From:  Don Schultz for Coordinating Counsel Committee
Re:       Attached Draft letter
            Before notice of this week's status conference arose, Doug 
Robinson raised with the Coordinating Counsel Committee a suggested 
communication to Judge Downes as reflected in the attached proposed 
letter.    The Coordinating Counsel Committee is in favor of sending this 
letter, which has already undergone some circulation and editing among those 
who worked actively on the dismissal briefing.
            We would like to deliver the letter to Judge Downes in advance of 
the status conference, preferably on Wednesday, and so I would appreciate 
hearing of any objections or suggestions for revisions or alternate courses 
of action right away.   Thanks for your cooperation.  Don.

On January 14, 2000, we transacted with Conective via NatSource for a Nov '00 
- March '01 basis swap @ Transco Z6.  Our ticket/booking/confirmation 
indicates we bought the swap.  The broker confirm indicates we sold the 
swap.  Our confirm to the counterparty was executed as Enron buying by their 
operations manager, Joseph Glace.  The counterparty is contending that the 
broker confirm is correct.  Trading contends our confirm is correct and 
binding.  How should we proceed?  The value of the position is roughly $3MM 
of revenue.

Thanks,

Here is follow-up research on the question of whether we could remove a
criminal case against Enron to federal court.  It is not as promising as we
first thought.

I apologize for accidentally hitting the wrong button and sending the below 
e-mail.  Here's the rest of my e-mail:

1. (cont'd.) and any other form language typically used.

2. confirmation that MG Metals indeed paid the freight to ICTS in advance for 
all the shipments to Scottsborough.

3.  copies of anything that MG Metals has received in the past from this 
carrier, ICTS or Scottsborough regarding these particular dispute.

I will keep you closely advised.

		 Subject: In re ICTS

I have received a telefax from Scottsborough, our good customer, which 
attaches the lawsuit filed by the trucker against it and ICTS, in Alabama 
state court.  The complaint prays for recovery of about $15,000, plus 
interest and attorneys' fees.  I was not sent the service papers, which would 
allow me to confirm Scottsborough's advice that its "return date" is December 
16 (a Saturday, so it can't be right).  I was not sent any documents that 
would allow me to confirm Scottsborough's representation that all the loads 
(which were allegedly shipped from 4/10-5/23/00) were purchased from MG 
Metals, freight prepaid.

I am sending a follow-up letter to Scottsborough asking for specific 
additional documentation, including the service papers; you will be 
blind-copied on the letter.  I will also have Becky, my legal assistant, (a) 
call the Court to see if process has been issued against ICTS and whether it 
has been served and (b) check on Pacer, the federal bankruptcy database, to 
see if ICTS has filed for bankruptcy.

Meanwhile, I wonder if Nicole could advise me of/send me the following:

1. a copy of the MG Metals/Scottsborough master agreement, if there is one,

Campbell v. SDGE
 Enclosed is that docket sheet, complaint and removal petition for
the Campbell case filed against SDGE in November and removed to federal
court.
  <<Campbell.v.SDGE.PDF>>
EPMI Current Trading Activities
 We reviewed the FERC orders from Friday night and discovered that a
penalty has been created for generators that refuse to sell energy to the
ISO in an emergency.  You will recall Tim Belden telling us that he had made
the decision not to sell out of market to the ISO because of the refund risk
and the credit issues.  When I asked Tim whether in his view we would be
considered a generator if we are long on power that we have the exclusive
right to sell.  He said he did not know and welcomed our advice on the
topic.  He wanted to know, for example, when is it an emergency.  He also
told me that the ISO has sought from the Secretary of Energy a declaration
of emergency under Section 202(c) of the power act.  Under that provision,
apparently if asked for energy, you have to deliver and worry about getting
paid later (my uninformed interpretation.)  At Robin's suggestion, I
contacted Dan Watkiss who was going to get his team to evaluate quickly and
provide advice by tomorrow morning.
Selected Contract Analysis  (Randy Conner)
 Tomorrow we will be sending to all of you copies of the contracts
and draft contracts selected by Christian Yoder and Steve Hall that might
relate to marketing of various strategies to customers.
Subpoena Scorecard
 Peter Meringolo is preparing a scorecard of which agency has asked
for what documents and information for distribution.
Extended Contact List
 Here is a contact list that includes experts and some key Enron
personnel.

 This is a file I have had set up for some years.  From time to time, we 
receive third party subpoenas from the parties.

 I recently received (through Carrin Patman) an informal request from Exxon's 
counsel in this matter for some old Exxon/Intratex gas supply contracts.  
Exxon's expert wants to use these contracts as part of his database to show 
that, contrary to the royalty class's primary theory of recovery, Exxon did 
adequately market the royalty owners' gas.  

 Exxon's attorney has already tried to find these old contracts at Exxon, but 
there is no cross-reference index available on these old documents.  Exxon 
will pay for our costs in responding and has no problem with us wanting them 
to be kept confidential.  The parties recently got a trial setting for August 
28 in Winkler County state court (Kermit Texas).  Exxon will file a motion 
for continuance, but of course can't be sure that it will be granted.
 
 Parenthetically, plaintiffs are asking for $53 million in actual damages, 
and up to twenty times that in punitives, plus 40% attorneys' fees.  I do 
not, however, believe that Intratex or any present or former Enron entity has 
any exposure.  This case has been around for five years, and no Enron entity 
has ever been made a party, nor has there been any hint of that.  You should 
also be aware that a subset of the class brought exactly the same case 
against Exxon about a year ago and the jury poured them out.  That case, 
Haley v. Exxon, also involved the same plaintiffs' experts.

 I am working with Bonnie to find out who the right business records 
custodian would be; it may be that V&E actually has all these old documents.  
Once I find this out, we will coordinate a response.

 Britt

Subject: RE: Agreement and Release of Claim

Steve,

Thank you for the offer and your follow-up phone call.
I have reviewed the offer and cannot accept it.  I am owed more than the
$44,463.88 you admit in the offer.  At this time I am not anywhere near
being agreeable to releasing ECOGAS, its shareholders, partners, or
affiliates or each of their respective directors, officers, employees,
agents, representatives, and insurers as specified in the document.
If you in fact have $22,231.94 allocated to pay me, I would strongly
encourage you to consult with counsel and then to go ahead and make another
partial payment against the ECOGAS indebtedness.  Doing so will certainly
mitigate some of the damages that have been caused by a member or members of
the group you have defined as ECOGAS Related Parties.  Put simply, the more
I receive from ECOGAS, the less I will be seeking to collect from a related
party who is liable to me.  Nothing stops you from making the appropriate
partial payment other than your continued practice of making preferential
payments to my detriment.  Until the ECOGAS Related Parties or its member(s)
are prepared to fully compensate me, I will not execute any release.  If
ECOGAS declares insolvency in the interim, so be it, I look forward to
working with the trustee to reverse the preferential payments in accordance
with the bankruptcy code.
I repeatedly advised you against making preferential payments if you had
knowledge that the company was insolvent.  In Felipe Vega's presence, I
repeatedly advised you to seek counsel.  If I should determine that you, or
any other party, in fact authorized me to perform work at a time that you or
another party knew or should have known that ECOGAS was or was becoming
insolvent, and therefore had no intention to pay for the work being
authorized, I am fully prepared to collect for any shortfall or other
damages from the appropriate party or parties.  Since the documents indicate
that Mr. Maffett stated that you and the controller knew that the company
was insolvent when you were authorizing work, I conclude that you were at
least complicit in leading me to perform work at a time that you had no
intention of compensating me from company funds.  Therefore, I must
reasonably assume, unless your intention was fraudulent, that you intended
to compensate me from your own funds, or from funds promised by another
party.
I am sure that you have been fully compensated for the time you have spent
at ECOGAS since February and I fully expect to be compensated for the work I
performed during the same period.  I recommend that you look seriously at
the path ahead, consult with your counsel, and then immediately pay me in
full.  Please let me know if you need my wire transfer instructions again.
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to continue contacting me
or to have your attorney contact me.  Since you continue to contact me and I
have received no response from Doug Daniels, I am assuming that Bracewell &
Patterson prefers not to accumulate any additional billable hours with an
allegedly insolvent client.  Doug and I had agreed not to unilaterally
notice depositions in my current lawsuit, but I need to proceed with
discovery.  I am prepared to take your deposition on any workday between
December 18th and December 29th.  I sincerely regret that the Holiday season
is going to be interrupted on this task, which regrettably will be
unpleasant, but you are one of the parties that has forced this timeline.

Great -- I look forward to receiving your proposed reply. Once the "Enron" 
team is comfortable with its position, I have no objection to coordinating 
with the other defendants -- primarily because we would like to know the 
position of each of the Coordinated Defendants, but it would seem to me that 
interest in resolving these cases (or at least hearing what Grynberg would 
propose) should be an independent, company by company, determination.

In process.  We will coordinate this with the other defendants, as the
letter did not come directly to us.  Note also that we have served (but have
not filed) Rule 11 motions on Grynberg.  A reminder of that may be part of
the response.

Lisa - The attached schedule calculates interest on overdue interest at the 
9.9% rate.  This is fine except that I do not know if we are able to charge 
interest on overdue interest.  That is Richard Sanders call - Richard, please 
let us know.  If we can charge interest on interest, this schedule is fine.  
Otherwise, we will have to recalculate using simple interest.

John-

Attached is the schedule that we had at Monday's meeting which has been 
updated through 10/31/00.   After looking more closely at the schedule and 
the way it is calculating interest, it appears that interest is being 
compounded.  The estimate that we had used in Monday's meeting was simple 
interest for one year calculated on the sum of $1,061,300.90 and $264,452.89 
(October 1999 values) which equated to roughly $131,246.65.  However,  based 
on the schedule's calculation, I believe the total interest and principal due 
is $1,171,585.67.  Please look over this schedule and see if you agree with 
my thinking.

Thank you,
Lisa

Privileged and Confidential Joint Defense Communication

From:  Don Schultz
To:      Quinque  Defendants
Re:     Extension of time for discovery letter

Judge Downes' law clerk called to report that Judge Downes did not intend to 
impose such scheduling duress on the Grynberg and Wright groups seeking to 
coordinate on a discovery letter, so is granting us until the close of 
business on Thursday to submit a coordinated letter reply.   A draft reply is 
in process and should be circulated early tomorrow with requests for your 
prompt feedback.  (Quinque defendants may not have a separate interest in the 
discovery requested by Grynberg, but I am repeating this message for the 
benefit of those in the email group who are not also counsel in the Grynberg 
cases) Don.

A portion of the defense conference call today related to argument of the 
remand opposition. I reminded the group that you wished to argue. Apparently 
all three defendants who filed briefs will argue through counsel. Per the 
Order, defendants have one hour total to divide. It was agreed that it would 
be beneficial to have you, Jim Springer (Duke), and John Sturgeon (Mirant) 
caucus by telephone to iron out the details including time allocation, order 
of presentation, subjects to be covered, strategy etc. Other counsel are free 
to forward their thoughts as to likely questions etc. Chris Healy advised 
that he would like to be involved in your discussions on these points. 
Thereafter you would distribute argument outlines for review and comment by 
all. There will then be a Conference call involving the Defense Group on the 
preceding Friday 6/15 @ 9 A.M. to iron out any issues. Do you have any 
problems with this approach? I will leave it to you to coordinate these 
efforts with your calendar. If you want me to assist please let me know.

Defendants are still continuing in their position that Judge Whaley should 
defer these rulings until the MDL has acted. A letter to the Court to this 
effect is being delivered today. However we are proceeding on the assumption 
that the hearing will proceed on 6/18. Query what the impact would be if the 
M.L. assigned all cases to Judge Whaley prior to 6/18. Would this result in a 
continuance to permit the other remand issues to be heard all at once? I'll 
certainly advise you ASAP of any hearing date change.

Panel OKs Subpoenas for Energy Companies 
Electricity: Special state Senate committee will demand pricing information 
in inquiry into whether California has been gouged. 
By CARL INGRAM, MIGUEL BUSTILLO, Times Staff Writers


SACRAMENTO--The Senate Rules Committee agreed Monday to issue subpoenas to 
eight out-of-state power generating companies demanding documents on pricing, 
bidding and other aspects of electricity sales in the state. 
Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana), chairman of the special Senate committee that is 
investigating whether power wholesalers are illegally profiteering from 
California's energy crisis, said he expects the companies to resist. That 
would set the stage for a court fight, he said. 
In addition to subpoenas aimed at the private generating companies, the 
committee also put the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power on notice 
that unless it voluntarily provides information on its power sales to the 
state, the data will be subpoenaed as well. And the panel threatened to 
subpoena records of the state Department of Water Resources unless it turns 
over information on how it has spent more than $7 billion to keep electricity 
flowing in California. 
Under Senate regulations, Dunn's panel needed approval of the Rules Committee 
to issue the subpoenas. 
Industry executives deny that they have broken any laws in selling 
electricity at premium prices to California's financially strapped utilities 
and the state water department. 
The subpoenas will be issued to Reliant Energy, which Gov. Gray Davis has 
publicly accused of price gouging, Dynegy Energy Services Inc., Williams 
Energy, Enron Corp., NRG Energy Inc., Duke Energy, Mirant Inc., and AES Corp. 
Dunn said executives of the generators seemed cooperative when the 
investigation was launched two months ago. Since then, he said, they have 
raised barriers, including demands that the confidentiality of their 
documents be protected. 
The demand for information from the Los Angeles DWP and the state's water 
resources department were pushed by Sen. Ross Johnson (R-Irvine), vice 
chairman of the rules panel. 
"Why are we not attempting to subpoena the Los Angeles Department of Water 
and Power? There certainly have been suggestions that they have profited," 
Johnson said, referring to reports from the California Independent System 
Operator about large profits that DWP made by selling power to the rest of 
the state. 
Reflecting the views of many lawmakers, Johnson said the Legislature also 
needs information on power purchases that the state water department makes 
from wholesalers and the bidding strategies used to make the bids. 
Davis has refused to make details of the purchases public. He contends that 
if generators knew how much the state was spending on power, they might raise 
their prices. Several news organizations and a legislator are suing to make 
the information public. 
Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco), chairman of the Rules 
Committee, opposed issuing subpoenas to the city and state departments, at 
least temporarily, leading to the agreement for a one-week delay before 
subpoenas would be issued to the agencies. 
The big energy companies also took a hit Monday from a leading advocacy group 
for the poor. 
The Pacific Institute for Community Organization, a coalition of faith-based 
groups that has pressed for California to cover more of the millions of 
working citizens without any health insurance, voiced concern that the energy 
crisis is hitting the poor hardest. 
The group, which scheduled a Capitol rally today, plans to urge political 
leaders to use the economic power of the state's huge pension funds to 
leverage the companies. 
The two pension funds own at least $1.2 billion in stocks and bonds in most 
of the major firms involved in the state energy crisis, from Enron of Texas 
to Duke of North Carolina, the advocates said. 
"They could bring the voice of stockholders into the debate, as a major 
stockholder, and take a more enlightened view of what is happening to 
California," said activist Jim Keddy. "We really have no voice inside those 
companies right now."

I got a voice-mail from Dean Vanek, Scottsborough's general counsel, just a 
moment ago.  He has just come off a road trip and had a chance to read my 
telefax.  Vanek will apparently send me some of the documentation I 
requested, although it is not clear that he will send me the documents that 
reflect that all the loads for which Scottsborough is being sued were in fact 
purchased from MG Metals.

My last question on my telefax to Vanek was what attorney Vanek would 
typically retain in a lawsuit such as this to defend Scottsborough.  Vanek 
said in his voice-mail that in this suit, he does not intend to hire an 
attorney.  Vanek said he would pay whatever the carrier was suing for, then 
deduct that amount from whatever Scottsborough owes us for aluminum.  Then, 
contradicting himself, Vanek said that he would join MG Metals as a party 
(which would of course require him to retain an attorney).  I assume that he 
probably could join us as a party on a breach of contract theory, given that 
Scottsborough purchased the metal from us "freight prepaid".   I'm not sure 
that an Alabama court has personal jurisdiction over Enron Metals sufficient 
to allow joinder, but it might.

Vanek also seemed irritated at the time MG Metals had taken to reply to his 
earlier communications, and directed me to our Montreal office if I wanted 
copies of things he had previously sent to us.  Of course, we all decided 
some time ago to take a "let sleeping dogs lie" strategy in hopes that a 
carrier like Alabama wouldn't actually file suit.  In any case, I don't know 
how much of this apparent irritation is real or is strategy.

I called Vanek back and again missed him, but left a voice-mail to the effect 
that I read his message "loud and clear" and would jump on reviewing the 
exhibits he was sending me as soon as I received them.  I told him that I was 
particularly interested in them because if the bs/l were marked "freight 
prepaid", then Scottsborough may have a good defense to the carrier's case.

As you may recall, ICTS has been joined as a party to this action.  ICTS is 
the party that didn't pay the carrier.  I try to call ICTS and see what it 
intends to do in this matter.   

Britt

Works for me.

Deb -- Unless you or Mark Haedicke advise otherwise, Becky Stephens will 
process SOP for Ste. Aurelie Timberlands as she does for other companies in 
the Enron Wholesale Group, i.e. Service Recipient -- Richard Sanders; Copy 
Recipient -- Linda Guinn; ELU Contact -- Bonnie White.

Kate -- Please confirm with Becky when the change of agent has been effected.

Deb and Kate -- During the interim, I understand that service will be handled 
by the current agent and notice of service will be issued by that agent to 
whomever Deb has designated. If that is to be Becky during this transition, 
Deb will need to so instruct the current agent with a copy of the 
instructions to Becky.

Thanks.

Thanks Deb.  We'll proceed to prepare change of agent forms.  Will you also 
be able to provide information on officer or director slates?  At present we 
have no info. at all so we will not be able to get a signature(s) on the 
forms.

Please advise whether minute books, seals, stock certs., etc. will continue 
to be maintained by Canadian counsel in Quebec.

Which are the "documents" referred to in your message below?

Thanks for your help.  It's much appreciated.

I understand that you have expressed a preference that service of process 
upon this recently acquired domestic company be received by Canadian counsel. 
This is contrary to the procedure that we implemented a couple of years ago, 
whereby a corporate agent has been assigned as agent for service of process 
relative to all domestic entities affiliated with Enron Corp. in all states. 
Currently, that agent is NRAI. 

There are two exceptions -- PGE and Limbach. Both of these companies 
requested and were granted exceptions to the SOP procedure for specific 
business needs. 

Please provide me the basis for the requested exception as to the captioned 
company. Of course, we will make every effort to accommodate the specific 
business needs of this company. Also, please advise whether you or someone on 
your behalf has determined that the laws in each state in which the company 
is incorporated and does business permits SOP on a foreign individual.

Thanks.

Privileged and Confidential Joint Defense Communication
?
From:? Don Schultz
To:????? Grynberg JDT
Re:??????Grynberg's Motion for Scheduling  Conference
?????????? I propose a  short Reply to Grynberg's request for a scheduling 
conference.?  Proposed?rough text is set out below for discussion purposes.?? 
I  will?seek your views on this in this afternoon's conference call.
????????????"  The Coordinated Defendants agree that a scheduling conference 
would assist the  Court.?? They reply to?specific?concerns raised  
by?Relator's Motion."
??????????? 1.?  Relator asserts that Rule 26 self-executing 
discovery?obligations were  triggered by issuance of?the Court's?Order 
Denying Motions to Dismiss.  ?Motion,?__.?? To the contrary, by operation of 
the Court's  November 16, 1999 Practice and Procedure Order (paragraph 13) 
and January 13,  2000 Order on First Pretrial Conference (paragraph 11), 
discovery remains stayed  and all obligations under Rules 26 through 37 
remain tolled, pending a  separate?order of the Court to establish a 
discovery  schedule.??
?????????2.???Similarly,  deadlines for filing answers or other responsive 
pleadings were stayed in all  cases by?this Court's October 18, 2000 order.??
?????????3.???After  the Order Denying Motions to Dismiss was posted, Mr. 
Beatty contacted Mr. Figa  at the request of the Coordinated Defendants and 
advised Mr. Figa of defendants'  belief that under the Court's prior orders, 
there are no deadlines currently  running?on discovery obligations or to file 
answers or  motions.??Mr. Figa then expressed agreement and indicated that a  
scheduling conference would be needed to set such deadlines.?? 
???????? 4.? The Coordinated  Defendants agree with Relator that a scheduling 
conference is appropriate.?  They believe such a conference should occur 
after the Court has  issued?orders anticipated on motions argued in the 
later-transferred  actions, and, particularly the United States' motions to 
dismiss allegations or  proceedings in the Grynberg, Perry, Dutton and 
Ousterhoudt actions.? The  Court indicated its desire to issue?such orders, 
or announce rulings on  those motions, by?about June 27, 2001.? ?Coordinated 
Defendants  respectfully request that an overall scheduling conference be set 
for a date  which allows for the parties several days to study?the 
anticipated orders  once they are issued,?to determine the results and 
effects?on case  management and planning, and?to make their respective 
scheduling proposals  to the Court."

WPTF will be submitting a ton of data to the AG office tomorrow.  It consists 
of all WPTF-related data -- no member-specific data.  It includes a password 
to the WPTF web site so that the guy can read all the regulatory filings 
we've made -- and the burritos (weekly newsletters to the membership).  Also 
they are submitting all meeting minutes, Gary's day planner and the bylaws.  
This seems fine.

Hi Angeline --

I received your fax this date regarding the WFW pacific virgo invoice.  What 
I am looking for is  a copy of the back-up to the statement you sent.  In 
other words, I need a breakdown of the time billed by each attorney working 
on this matter.   All I have is the one page listing $137,455.18 -- what does 
this consist of?  Please forward this to me so I can arrange for payment of 
this invoice.  Thanks.

Please see the message from Dianne Langeland regarding the additional 
charge.  Please bring the additional charge when you pick up your tickets.

Subject: CORRECTION -- "THE NUTCRACKER"



All tickets should have the $.25 service charge, which you did not include in 
the cost of the ticket.  I have included that service charge in the amounts 
shown above.  However, you will need to collect that amount from each person 
for the remaining 52 tickets ($13.00).  The Club had to pay this service fee 
for all the tickets (59 x .25 = $14.75).  

A breakdown of that amount will be as follows:
Lois Black =   $1.00
Candy Willard =  $1.00
Paulita Olvera =  $0.75
Nicole Mendez =  $0.75
Tammy Kovalcik = $0.50
Paige Wilkinson =  $0.50
Valeria Hope =   $1.00
Susan Skarness =  $0.75
Bill Rogers =   $0.75
Leesa Hutcherson = $0.75
Blanca Martinez =  $0.75
Antoinette Forret = $0.75
Lupy Gonzalez = $0.00 (paid in check above)
Dianne Langeland = $1.00 (given to Margaret with paperwork)
Debbie Roman = $0.75
Tommy Garza =  $1.00
Richard Sanders $1.00
Sarita Garza =  $0.00 (included in above)

Please discuss this outstanding amount of $13.00 with Margaret.  I think the 
best is for you to pay this amount to the Club and then you will be 
reimbursed when you collect the outstanding service fees from the individual 
purchasers.  (I will give Margaret the $1.00 for service charge on my tickets 
and that will leave you a $12.00 amount to collect.)

If you have any questions, please let me know immediately.  

Thanks,

Dianne

In our quest to get a handle on all of these lawsuits....I was wondering if 
you have an estimate of when Ice Drilling may come to a conclusion and how 
much more $$$ it will cost.  Kristi gave me a year to date schedule if that 
helps.

Thanks,

IMPORTANT EPMI POLICY REGARDING HARD COPY DOCUMENTS
WHILE LITIGATION IS PENDING

This policy is in addition to my prior email about the procedure for
handling email and electronic documents.  While most of what we do is
contained within Enron's electronic systems, there still are times when
hard
copies are made or needed for running our business.  Here is how you must
handle those hard copy documents:

1.   The basic rule is that if you have hard copies of documents that are
used in EPMI's business of selling energy in the WSCC, you must keep those
documents until further notice.  If space becomes a problem, please contact
Debra Davidson who can arrange for storage.

2.   What constitutes a document?  In some instances you will have one
copy of a document that has your handwritten notes on it, and another copy
that may be clean.  For these purposes both are considered documents and
both must be saved.  Similarly, if several people have copies of the same
document, each separate copy is considered a separate document.  On the
other hand, if you made 10 copies for a meeting and there were 4 left over
that were never handed out or were not used, those may be recycled so long
as you keep the ones that were used.   If you keep handwritten notes for
your work, those would be considered documents as well.  Telephone notes,
charts, printouts of data, spreadsheets etc. all constitute documents.   If
you have a question about what constitutes a document and whether it should
be saved, please ask Christian Yoder and Steve Hall.

3.   The goal and purpose of this policy is to make sure that no hard
copies of documents are discarded that are relevant to the wholesale
electricity market litigation.  If hard copy documents are discarded, at a
later point in time EPMI and/or its employees will be criticized for
failing
to preserve documents relevant to the wholesale electricity litigation.

4.   Personal documents such as shopping lists, personal messages from
friends unrelated to the energy business etc. are not covered by this
policy
and you may do with them as you wish.

Hennegan's office will be seeking to depose Brian Barth as well as Kevin 
McConville.? They feel they have to depose Brian and Kevin, because they fear 
that ECT Securities will file a motion for summary judgment and they are 
looking for testimony to use in opposition.

Linda,

Could you send the WFW bill down to me please?  I just changed admin 
assistants and my new a/a, Lee, could not find that in the file.  Richard 
wanted me to take a look and try to apportion it between his r/c and Alan's, 
given my statement to Richard that the WFW bill contains a lot of time that I 
(and I believe Matt shares this belief) was directed to resolution of the 
dispute with FGH.  

Britt

P.S. to Matt-- what do you think about asking Neale if he would take a look 
at that bill and apportion the time spent between the cargo claim versus the 
FGH matter?

Hi Angeline --

I received your fax this date regarding the WFW pacific virgo invoice.  What 
I am looking for is  a copy of the back-up to the statement you sent.  In 
other words, I need a breakdown of the time billed by each attorney working 
on this matter.   All I have is the one page listing $137,455.18 -- what does 
this consist of?  Please forward this to me so I can arrange for payment of 
this invoice.  Thanks.

Bob:
You asked us to determine whether there are defects on the face of the
subpoena served upon EES which may prevent its enforcement in superior
court.  Assuming the court  holds the subpoena to the standard of a
"deposition subpoena" - and we think it should - it is defective in at least
two respects.  First, it was not served upon Enron by personal service as
required by CCP o2020(f).  Second, Government Code o1189 provides that the
Attorney General must first file a petition in superior court to require the
custodian of records to appear and testify. While the subpoena requests a
deposition of the Enron EES custodian of records, the AG did not file such a
petition. In addition, Government Code o1185 provides that  a person served
with such a subpoena is not obliged to attend as a witness if he or she does
not reside or do business within 50 miles of the court in which he or she is
asked to appear.
At your request we are now researching and will draft over the weekend a
memorandum to address three issues arising from this subpoena:  (1) whether
EES has substantive grounds to refuse to comply with the subpoena or to
disqualify the AG from enforcing it  (2) whether EES may successfully remove
any compliance proceeding brought by the AG to federal court; and (3) the
consequences to EES if it should be held in contempt for refusal to comply.
A discussion of the defects in the EES subpoena follows:
There are three defects in the subpoena  served on Enron Enery Services
("EES") on May 25, 2001, pursuant to California Government Code section
11180-11189.  The subpoena purports to require EES to produce its custodian
of record on June 25, 2001, to "testify and to answer questions" and to
"produce documents responsive to the document requests."  (Subpoena at
2:1-5).  Accordingly, its demands are in the nature of a subpoena for
deposition and we analyze it on this basis.
1. Defective Service
  The subpoena appears defective because it was served by mail
instead of personal service.  Service of a deposition subpoena pursuant to
California Code of Civil Procedure section 2020(f) requires that the
subpoena be served personally, not by mail.  For the reasons discussed
below, we believe that the subpoena served on EES is deposition subpoena
subject to the personal service requirements of C.C.P. o 2020(f).
  First, the subpoena is a deposition subpoena because it
seeks to compel oral testimony from EES's custodian of records.  The method
of taking oral testimony in California outside of court is by way of
deposition.  C.C.P. o 2002, et seq.  Here, the subpoena commands EES'
custodian of records "to testify and to answer questions."  (Subpoena at
2:1).  It also states that the custodian of records "will be questioned
under oath regarding methods of compliance and whether all documents
described in this subpoena have been produced."  (Subpoena at 7:5).
Moreover, the subpoena is issued "pursuant to the powers conferred by
California Government Code sections 11180-11189...".  Government Code
section 1189 is entitled "Depositions;  petition;  order;  enforcement"
(emphasis supplied).  The subpoena should thus properly be considered a
deposition subpoena.
  Second, the requirements of the California Code of Civil
Procedure governing deposition subpoenas applies to the subpoena served on
EES.  Government Code section 11185 provides that in the case of deposition
subpoenas, the deposition is governed by the California Code of Civil
Procedure.  The Attorney General has also issued a formal opinion stating
that the Code of Civil Procedure governs subpoenas issued pursuant to Gov.
Code o 11180:
    Presumably [Gov. Code o 11180] authorizing
the head of the Department to issue a subpoena for the production of books,
papers, or documents would be governed by the general law relating to
subpoenas duces tecum. (see Sec. 1985, C.C.P).

9 Attorney General's Opinions 35, Opinion No. 46-341;  see also, 11 Attorney
General's Opinions 66, Opinion No. 48-21 (service of subpoena pursuant to
Gov. Code o 11184 must comply with Code of Civil Procedure o 410).

  Because the subpoena is a deposition subpoena subject to the
Code of Civil Procedure, the requirement that it be served personally, not
by mail, should apply.

2. The Subpoena is Defective Because the Attorney General Failed to
First File a Petition in Superior Court and Obtain a Court Order Requiring
the Custodian of Records to Appear and Testify

  Government Code section 11189 provides:

    In any matter pending before a department
head, the department head may cause the deposition of persons residing
within or without the state to be taken by causing a petition to be filed in
the Superior Court in the County of Sacramento reciting the nature of the
matter pending, the name and residence of the person whose testimony is
desired, and asking that an order be made requiring the person to appear and
testify before an officer named in the petition for that purpose.

The Attorney General, while purporting to serve the subpoena pursuant to
this section ("Pursuant to the powers conferred by California Government
Code section 11180-11189..."), failed to comply with Government Code section
11189 by first filing a petition and obtaining a court order permitting the
taking of testimony.  For this reason, the subpoena should be considered
defective.

3. The Supoena is Defective for Purporting to Compel Attendance by the
Custodian of Records at a Location More than Fifty Miles from His Residence


  Government Code section 11185 provides:

    a person is not obliged to attend as a
witness in any matter under this article at a place out of the county in
which he resides, unless the distance is less than 50 miles from his place
of business.  (emphasis supplied).

The subpoena is addressed to EES's custodian of records, and is "issued
primarily for the purpose of having [EES], through your most knowledgeable
person" testify and produce documents.  (Subpoena at 2:4-6).  Presumably,
EES's custodian of records who is most knowledgeable with respect to the
documents requested in the subpoena resides more than 50 miles from San
Francisco.  If so, the subpoena would be defective, and EES's custodian of
records would not be obliged to attend as a witness.

Here is today's status report:

FERC

 Megawatt Daily reports that requests for rehearing before FERC have
been filed even though the November 1, 2000 draft order is not yet final.
Cal PX said they could not implement the software necessary to run the soft
caps by January 1st.    The City San Diego requested rehearing on the issue
of whether FERC has the authority to order refunds.  The City of San Diego's
Friday filing said the SDG&E had $800M in its "balancing account" that it
would be seeking from ratepayers.  The City argued that because their were
not just and reasonable rates, the filed rate doctrine is not called into
question.

Charles Dick

 I spoke with Charles Dick about his personal availability.  He told
me that he understood we were asking for a personal commitment from him.  He
has one matter that is set for arbitration in June, 2001 that will take a
significant amount of this time.  He has other matters, but is willing to
personally commit the time necessary for this engagement.  He had the same
approach as in the interview- not selling himself, but being completely
responsive.

David Noonan

 David called to tell me he had left messages for Richard but they
had not connected yet.  In part, it was because David was in deposition.  We
discussed conflict issues at some length.  In the copper cases where he
represents SCE, they have a 1.5% and 3% share of the damages at issue.
Thus, he is not acting as longstanding SCE counsel.  He said that he did not
believe that he could get a written forward looking waiver, since the
general counsel does not see this representation as a current conflict.  He
agreed, however, that he would be able to confirm that in the event that
Enron and SCE become adverse, while he would not be able to represent either
entity in that litigation, if he is still representing them in the copper
litigation, SCE would not claim that his continued representation of Enron
in the non-adverse matters was a violation of the duty of loyalty.  David
was going to continue to try and connect with Richard.

Larry Ruff

 Larry has reviewed the preliminary data that we were proposing to
release to the PUC.  In particular, I asked him to take the view of a
regulator and use the data to show market power, withholding electricity,
etc.  He told me that the data was not all that helpful in any of those
regards.  First, he found the same anomalies later in the year with respect
to energy purchased and energy sold.  He also had some questions about the
identity of various counterparties used in the system.  He found that the
data did not include price by the hour -- instead only the 24 hour
aggregate.  To the extent that we want to understand what happened during
peak periods, we would need the detailed data.  We also discussed finding
out what sources of public market data were available to understand what was
happening in the market to compare the Enron data with.  Larry has completed
the initial quick look that we asked for.  He will be in Australia for the
next few months.  We have made arrangements for encrypted email etc. to be
available so that we may consult with him as needed.

Tariffs and FERC related Materials

 Jean asked for the reference to the legal requirement to submit a
balanced schedule etc.  Peter Meringolo from our office gathered this
material earlier and we include it below.  We also enclose Ron Carol's brief
that he sent us that challenges the penalty provisions of the ISO tariff.
That litigation has been ongoing for a number of years.

 The requirement for EPMI to submit a balanced schedule is found in
the ISO tariff at section 2.2.7.2:

  A Scheduling Coordinator shall submit to the ISO only
Balanced Schedules in the Day-Ahead Market and the Hour-Ahead Market.  A
Schedule shall be treated as a Balanced Schedule when aggregate Generation,
Inter-Scheduling Coordinator Energy Trades (whether purchases or sales), and
imports or exports to or from external Control Areas adjusted for
Transmission Losses as appropriate, equals aggregate forecast Demand with
respect to all entities for which the Scheduling Coordinator schedules in
each zone.  If a Scheduling Coordinator submits a Schedule that is not a
Balanced Schedule, the ISO shall reject that Schedule provided that
Scheduling Coordinators shall have an opportunity to validate their
schedules prior to the deadline for submission to the ISO by requesting such
validation prior to the applicable deadline.

 The ISO Market Monitoring & Information Protocol ("MMIP") sets forth
the standards for Anomalous Market Behavior.  See MMIP 2.1.1.

  Anomalous market behavior, which is defined as behavior that
departs significantly from the normal behavior in competitive markets that
do not require continuing regulation or as behavior leading to unusual or
unexplained market outcomes.  Evidence of such behavior may be derived from
a number of circumstances, including:

  withholding Generation capacity under circumstances in which
it would normally be offered in a competitive market;

  unexplained or unusual redeclarations of availability by
Generators;

  unusual trades or transactions;

  pricing and bidding patterns that are inconsistent with
prevailing supply and demand conditions, e.g., prices and bids that appear
consistently excessive for or otherwise inconsistent with such conditions;
and

  unusual activity or circumstances relating to imports form
or exports to other markets and exchanges.

 The MMIP also prohibits Gaming.  See MMIP 2.1.3.

  'Gaming,' or taking unfair advantage of the rules and
procedures set forth in the PX or ISO Tariffs, Protocols or Activity Rules,
or of transmission constraints in periods in which exist substantial
Congestion, to the detriment of the efficiency of, and of consumers in, the
ISO Markets.  'Gaming" may also include taking undue advantage of other
conditions that may affect the availability of transmission and generation
capacity, such as loop flow, facility outages, level of hydropower output or
seasonal limits on energy imports from out-of-state, or actions or behaviors
that may otherwise render the system and the ISO Markets vulnerable to price
manipulation to the detriment of their efficiency.

 The ISO MMIP allows the ISO to do any of the following, among other
things, as a result of an entity's Anomalous Market Behavior or Gaming:

* "impose such sanctions or penalties as it believes necessary and as
are permitted under the ISO Tariff."  See MMIP 7.3.

* refer "to such regulatory or antitrust agency as it sees fit to
recommend the imposition of sanctions and penalties."  See MMIP 7.3.

* publicize "in whatever medium it believes most appropriate" the
"activities or behavior of Market Participants in the ISO Markets [revealed
to] have the effect of, or potential for, undermining the efficiency,
workability or reliability of the ISO Markets to give or to serve such
Market Participants an unfair competitive advantage over other Market
Participants."  See MMIP 2.3.2.

I have found the correct path of the data files requested 
\\nahoutrd\houston\pwr\common\electric\west\incremnt\2000. The requested

that EES has been served.
California Attorney General Contact
 I spoke with Richard Rochman, Deputy Attorney General.  He told me
that he wanted a contact person for Enron for the AG's investigation.  I
told him that I would be that contact.  He said that in the next few days he
would be sending me a letter requesting that documents be preserved.  That
will be followed in 2-3 weeks by a subpoena.  He anticipated a 3 week period
to respond to the subpoena.  Enron is not the only entity that has been

you is accurate.  A more complete contact sheet with Enron witnesses,
experts etc. will be distributed in the next few days.
Defendants Contact Sheet
 Dave Noonan, Mike Kirby, Mike Day and I will try to figure out who
is representing whom in San Diego.
Removal
 Diversity
  Mike Kirby pointed out that even if we solved the
citizenship issue, it is unlikely that every class member will meet the
$75,000 amount in controversy requirement.  We also have the preliminary
reports that Sempra Energy Resources is a California corporation that is
selling electrical energy into the California PX market. (See December 1
status report.) I need to followup and find out if Sempra Energy Resources
has outside counsel yet and confirm their understanding on this issue.
 Federal Question and Related Primary Jurisdiction Argument
  All of us need to understand the interrelationship between
the FERC/PUC/ISO investigations and this class action.  There is also the
pending challenge to the ISO MMIP's by Enron and others that has been
pending for some time.  Does the complaint fairly raise or necessarily
implicate a federal question.
Change of Venue  (Additional Research by Peter Meringolo)

 I have researched case law involving class actions where class
members are jurors.  I found only two non-California cases, and both involve
change of venue motions.  See Beech v. Leaf River Forest Prods., 691 So. 2d
446 (Miss. 1997); Toledo Fair Hous. Ctr. v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 704
N.E.2d 663 (Ohio Ct. Com. Pl. 1996).  These cases, however, do not change
the analysis required under C.C.P. o 397(b).

 In Beech, plaintiffs brought a non-class action lawsuit against
defendants for polluting two rivers with dioxin.  Defendants moved for a
change of venue.  In addition to evidence of negative publicity, defendants
showed that of the 8,909 potential jurors, 750 were plaintiffs in other
dioxin cases against these defendants, and "even more were potential class
members in a class action brought against these same defendants" in another
county.  Beech, 691 So. 2d at 450.  The trial court granted defendants'
motion because the negative publicity and the large number of jurors
involved in similar litigation "would prevent the defendants from receiving
a fair trial."  Id.  The Mississippi Supreme Court affirmed, holding that
the trial court did not abuse its discretion.  Id.

 Toledo Fair involved a class action against Nationwide Mutual
Insurance Company.  Nationwide moved for a change of venue, arguing, among
other things, that because of the large size of the class "a significant
percentage of veniremen would be either class members or relatives of class
members and would thus be ineligible to sit as jurors."  Toledo Fair, 704
N.E.2d at 664.  Plaintiffs argued that Nationwide exaggerated the size of
the class.  Id.  The court denied the motion, holding that because of the
dispute regarding the size of the class, it was too early to determine
whether an impartial jury could be impaneled.  The court clearly left open
the possibility for Nationwide to renew this motion.

 We also discussed the remote possibility of challenging the judge
who would hear this case under Section 170.1, for cause, because the Judge
would be part of the class.  Dave Noonan has had experience in the egg case
with this type of challenge.
Consolidation
 Dave and Mike will look at how to manage a consolidation with Judge
Amos under San Diego local rules, if that is what we decided to do.  Keeping
in mind that the 17200 claims are not jury claims, the selection of the
judge is critical.
Coordination with Defense Counsel
 Dave and Mike will be responsible with Robin for coordinating among
defense counsel in San Diego.  Right now, we do not intend to enter any
formal defense sharing agreements.
Coordination with Plaintiffs' Counsel
 Dave and Mike with Robin will be responsible for coordinating our
efforts with lead plaintiffs' counsel.
Analysis of FERC/PUC Enron Positions
 Robin will work with me to understand from Ron Carroll (FERC) and

I am glad to report that we have received word from Rex Sharp, the 
plaintiffs' lawyer in the Quinque litigation, that he intends to dismiss 
Enron North America Corp. from this litigation.  We provided Rex with an 
affidavit explaining that ENA is not a first measurer of gas, and he let us 
know this morning that as a result, he does not intend to pursue ENA.  I will 
believe it when I see the amended petition, which should be filed by the 
close of business tomorrow.  

I will keep you updated.

After the completion of lengthy legal review (which concluded the invoices 
were correctly due and payable), please have Tenaska IV Texas Partners pay 
SWPC's charges for the February and April outages.  I show that these 
invoices total $1,627,541.81.  Additionally, these invoices need to be paid 
for us to file our insurance claim related to the outages (claims process 
currently underway, recoverable amount of the invoice totals less $500,000).

For everybody concerned, we will inform Tenaska of our decision by cc'ing 
their insurance representative, Doug Troop, on our claim notification letter.

If for any reason, we cannot immediately pay these invoices, please contact 
me immediately, as I have a meeting with SWPC tomorrow on other matters and 
they will be inquiring about the status of payment.

Thanks,  Chuck Ward

Privileged and Confidential Joint Defense Communication
From:? Don Schultz

Re:??????Wright's Motion to Take His Own  Deposition
??????????The Wright JDT  group authorized me to share the attached draft 
responsive brief and order  prepared by Kirkland & Ellis's Martin Tully.?? 
Further edits  are?underway.???I believe the scheduling discussion and  
proposal will be cut back to address only the initial?period of?time  
required to get?documents?and prepare for?the deposition of  Wright (rather 
than looking further down the calendar). 
?????????As of last week,  the?Grynberg Coordinating Counsel Committee?was 
inclined to recommend  "no action" by Grynberg defendants,?because the 
deposition issues  are?of primary concern to Wright defendants, and because 
of the probability  that the Wright and Grynberg defendants share the same 
interests as to the  deposition schedule and logistics, so that a separate 
voice for the Grynberg  group likely would not?add anything.? The Committe 
asked me, though,  to?monitor what the Wright defendants plan to do and 
report further.
??????????The Wright  Defendants' approach is reflected in their draft 
motion.??I think it  is consistent with what the Grynberg Coordinating 
Counsel Committee anticipated  last week.? 
???????? To assure that any  proposals for a separate Grynberg filing can be 
discussed, and that any  suggestions this group may want to raise to the 
Wright drafters,  can?be?considered, I asked Dawne Davis to schedule the 
call?she  announced for tomorrow afternoon.? If there is a Wright re-write  
available?before the call, I will circulate it.?
????????? It may help?the  call proceed?more efficiently if you will?email 
me?any proposals,  questions or?concerns you would like to have?raised?for  
discussion on this topic of Gene Wright's deposition.? Thanks, Don.
P.S.? We didn't?try to flood you with emails at the end of today  -our

On May 8, 2001, in greater San Juan, Puerto Rico, a San Juan Metro bus 
dropped into a hole that had been excavated by a work crew from San Juan Gas 
Company. The hole had been excavated by a San Juan Gas crew (or contract 
labor) under the supervision of a San Juan Gas operations supervisor as part 
of the project in which new plastic gas pipe and fiber optic conduit were 
being inserted into a portion of the existing San Juan Gas distribution 
system.

At the request of Risk Management, the Litigation Unit engaged local counsel 
and a local investigator for the purpose of obtaining the details of the 
incident. Initial reports indicate that at approximately 5:00 pm on May 8, 
the rear wheels of a Metro bus dropped into the excavation described above. 
The bus was traveling in a contra-flow bus lane and apparently struck and 
damaged three private vehicles as a result of the incident.

The incident also caused personal injury to the bus driver, some passengers 
and others. The bus driver and two passengers were taken to the hospital, but 
do not appear to be seriously injured. The driver complained of being 
overcome by the fumes of the diesel fuel that was spilled from the fuel tank 
of the bus. An elderly male passenger was thrown form his seat and may have 
injured his ribs. A 9 year old girl received a contusion to her forehead. 
Additionally, approximately 20 other individuals claimed to have been 
passengers on the bus and complained to the police of injuries. None required 
immediate hospital treatment.

The facts obtained to date, indicate that the hole was excavated by the San 
Juan Gas crew (as part of the insertion program mentioned above) in the bus 
lane as allowed by permit on April 30, 2001. The hole was not filled on that 
date, but was left with a large, heavy steel plate over it so that further 
work could be done. Between April 30 and May 8, the hole remained unfilled 
with the steel plate covering it and some further work may have been 
undertaken. The hole was filled in shortly after the incident.

In light of the facts that have been obtained, it is the view of Risk 
Management that the incident is a covered event and is, therefore, an insured 
matter. They wish to proceed immediately to address the personal injury and 
property claims in an effort to obtain an efficient resolution of such claims 
before suits are brought and the cost of litigation is incurred. Based on the 
facts of this incident and our litigation experience in San Juan, the 
Litigation Unit concurs with the desire of Risk Management to seek an 
expedited resolution of the claims that will arise out of this incident.

Risk Management has made arrangements with a local claims adjuster, in 
conjunction with our local counsel, to undertake the task of resolving the 
claims. Since the goal is to resolve the claims before litigation, Risk 
Management is prepared to initiate the process on Monday, May 21, and will do 
so, unless an objection is received. If you have an objection or wish to have 
further information, simply respond to this email.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Richard:

Mark is being asked to deliver his customary "no litigation" legal opinion in 
connection with this project, which is a securitization of eligible 
receivables generated by EPMI and ENA as a result of power and gas 
transactions.  Please note that ENA and EPMI have been performing under a 
similar agreement for over a year; this transaction is an amendment of the 
existing transaction to add another purchaser, and we are being asked to 
deliver new legal opinions.  I understand that Derrick delivered the opinion 
on behalf of ENA and EPMI when the transaction was first closed.   

This is a revolving facility, with ENA and EPMI selling receivables to 
Sequoia on a monthly basis as those receivables are generated.  The 
transaction documents define the type of receivables that may go into this 
facility (we are required to represent that we have title, there are no 
adverse claims, there are no restrictions on assignment, etc.).   Therefore, 
as long as our back office is doing their job right, we should not be selling 
any receivables into the project that are problematic.

Are you aware of any judgment, injunction, order, decree, or pending or 
threatened litigation:

 1. Against Sequoia Financial Assets, LLC; Cherokee Finance V.O.F.; or Enron 
Finance Partners LLC (these are the special purpose entities that exist only 
for this transaction);

 2. Against ENA or EPMI (Derrick is giving the opinion for Enron Corp.) that 
would prohibit ENA or EPMI from selling/transferring/conveying receivables 
owned by them and generated in connection with power/crude/natural gas sales?

          Attached is the latest revision by Doug Robinson to the letter to 
Judge Downes.  Doug has incorporated further committee comments, plus 
editorial suggestions received by email to the extent they were consistent 
with the consensus of input received.  I believe we are ready to finalize and

Britt

Please find below the answers to your queries re the AES shipment. Please do 
not hesitate to contact Harry or I if you need further information. David 
Minns (our in-house counsel) is actually on vacation until 2nd January 2001 
and is not on email during this time. You may also be interested to know that 
we understand Glencore (a fellow Australian coal trading company) has 
received a similar subpoena re trading with AES during this period. 

Enron Coal Asia Pacific Pty Ltd (ECAP) was the counterparty to this deal. 
ECAP sold to AES approx 60 000 metric tonnes of coal +/-10% as per the  
contract signed 7th September. (The effective date of the agreement was 10 
August 2000). The actually delivery amount was 54 152.35 metric tonnes a the 
cargo was loaded 3rd October 2000. ECAP is incorporated in Australia. 
The deal was negotiated by our Harry Papadopoulos and the contract signed 
here in Sydney by myself, Heidi Mason under delegated authority from  Stuart 
Staley. (My delegated authority is based on Stu's prior approval which in 
this case was received via email on 6th September 2000)
We have a copy of the contract here in Sydney, but as the coal was bought 
under LC and such LC was issued out of London, all shipping   documentation 
for this load was forwarded to London to the attention of Claire Veijou and 
Cornelia Luptowitsch. London office also issued the invoice  to AES on behalf 
of ECAP and this was done by Rebecca Millerchip or Maya Beyhem. 

Also, for your information, Harrry has prior travel plans that put him in 
China on the date of the hearing. While these could be changed, it would be 
less than desirable. Will it be necessary for the trader to be the Enron rep 
who appears on behalf of the company or could it ideally be someone from 
Houston (or London if needs be) simply because this is a long way to go for 
one appearance. John Bowman has resigned from Enron since the time this deal 
was done and therefore we have not advised him of this action. 

With thanks

Heidi Mason

		 Subject: PT Kaltim Rima Coal v. AES Barbers Point/Third-party subpoena on 
Enron Coal Company

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL:  ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION, ATTORNEY WORK 
PRODUCT--URGENT

Harry, Heidi and David,

 The above-referenced lawsuit is filed in the Southern District of New York 
by PT Kaltim Rima Coal, who allegedly had a long-term coal purchase agreement 
with AES Barbers Point, for delivery to AES in Hawaii.  In brief, PT contends 
that AES breached that agreement through the use of a bogus force majeure 
letter, in order to allow AES to purchase coal from some Enron entity at a 
cheaper spot market price in September or October of this year.

 PT's attorneys, Lord, Bissell & Brook out of Chicago, have served us with a 
subpoena on Enron Coal Company.  How they decided that Enron Coal Company was 
the correct entity is not something I yet know.   I have been advised that 
Enron Coal Company is a long-dormant subsidiary of Enron Property.  Although 
using Enron Coal Company's name throughout, the subpoena also references 
Harry, Riaz Rizvi, Allen Childress, Stuart Staley and/or John Bowman.  I 
understand that we probably did do a deal (maybe more than one) with AES, but 
need to be corrected if I am wrong.

 The subpoena requests that a corporate representative for Enron Coal Company 
appear with documents on January 8 in Houston to be deposed about the deal 
with AES.

 I would like to respond tomorrow, by telefax, to PT's attorneys and advise 
that Enron Coal Company is the wrong company.  If all I do is stall them, 
however, they can yank the information from us the hard way (assuming that we 
did do the deal in question) and eventually get what they want.  The suit is 
for about $4,000,000, so it is worth the while of PT's attorneys to pursue 
this subpoena.  Accordingly, I need one of you to tell me as soon as possible 
whether 

 (a) we did such a deal with AES during the relevant time frame, and if so, 
the exact name of the Enron entity on the deal;

 (b) who the trader on the deal was; and,

 (c) who has the documents regarding the deal.

Although I have briefly described the information I need, I also need to get 
the name of the right person to telefax the subpoena to for review, to see 
how broad the scope of the request for documents/witnesses really is. 

I would greatly appreciate this preliminary information by the close of 
business tomorrow, Thursday, in London/Australia.  I apologize for the 
extremely short time frame.  I was only given this subpoena last Friday, and 
have spent the days since chasing people down.  Please don't shoot the 
messenger. 

Britt

Enron needs a day (maybe less) of your time, hopefully this week.

We have to submit our proposed exhibits on July 3, 2001.  I am leaving for
Peru on Sunday 6/17, not returning until 7/6 (after the list is due, unless
the final status conference changes).

I have gone through my high priority documents and listed potential exhibits. 
I would like you to come out to our offices and go thru (1) the accordions of
key docs that you put together earlier this year and (2) all of the deposition
exhibits, to see what should be added to my list.

I am not trying to pack our list.  In fact I would like NOT to list (a) any
document that we are sure one or more of the other parties will submit (e.g.,
I haven't put any of the offering memos or road show slides on the list) or
(b) any document that contains anything negative for us, unless there is also
something very positive in the document that we really need (e.g., I haven't
listed Brian's memo re topics for Management Company discussion or any of the
work by the Enron auditors in August-September 1998.)

The reason that I would like you to do this work this week is so that I can
discuss any questions you come up with before I leave.  I will be in traveling
and in NY on Tues-Thurs, but you can come here on any of those days; I'll be
back in the office on Friday (6/15); we could talk out any questions then.

Let me know what you can do.

Here is a letter detailing what I feel our response should be. It makes no 
absolute statement regarding pricing errors, but does commit to the validity 
of "in the market" online trades. I do want to check the audio tapes to 
review exactly what the trader said, before we send anything back. I feel 
this letter highlights the difference between the situation on June 1 and the 
other events. I also feel this should significantly quiet their stance.

I have found the correct path of the data files requested 
\\nahoutrd\houston\pwr\common\electric\west\incremnt\2000. The requested 
directory has numerous files, not just the real-time spreadsheets. The below 
attachment contains the file names of the files within the above directory

Are you authorizing the copy of all of these files? Please advise...

The ISO filed a response at FERC to the PX's request to remove the hard cap=
=20
on adjustment bids and=20
replace it with a floating cap that would track the price of energy in the=
=20
market. =20

The ISO opposes the proposal arguing that it may produce extremely high=20
constrained Zonal market clearing=20
prices in the forward markets and may be subject to the exercise of market=
=20
power and to gaming. =20

The ISO suggests the PX fix this by anchoring its Adjustment Bids=20
(incremental and  decremental bids) prices=20
to the unconstrained market clearing price, as opposed to absolute Energy=
=20
bids.  In other words, the PX would=20
establish its constrained market clearing price as the sum of the=20
unconstrained market clearing price and the=20
Usage Charge resulting from the ISO=01,s Congestion Management process. =20

To effectuate this change, the PX would have to impose a new rule that=20
Adjustment Bids be within $125 of the=20
unconstrained market clearing price. The PX would then be required to proce=
ss=20
the Adjustment Bids prior to=20
passing them on to the ISO. The PX would have to subtract the unconstrained=
=20
market clearing price from each=20
Adjustment Bid prior to submitting it to the ISO. The ISO would then utiliz=
e=20
these Adjustment Bids, as well as=20
those submitted by other Scheduling Coordinators, to run its Congestion=20
Management system. After the ISO=20
completes its  Congestion Management process, the ISO would then=20
"post-process" the Adjustment Bids=20
(add back the unconstrained market clearing price) for use by the PX in=20
establishing its constrained Zonal=20
Energy prices and, as needed, by the ISO in real-time Congestion Management=
.=20

The ISO says it does not intend, by presenting this alternative to the PX=
=01,s=20
proposal, to preclude consideration=20
of other solutions that may be presented by one or more of the utilities or=
=20
by the EOB. =20

The ISO also argued that the Commission should impose reporting requirement=
s=20
on those entities who submit=20
Adjustment Bids in the ISO=01,s Congestion Management process.  It recommen=
ds=20
that the Commission require=20
the submission of all Adjustment Bids to the Commission, the ISO and the=20
EOB.  It also asked the Commission=20
to direct the PX Market Monitoring Unit, in concert with the ISO=01,s Depar=
tment=20
of Market Analysis, to increase its=20
monitoring of Adjustment Bids and bids submitted in the PX forward Energy=
=20
markets for evidence of the=20
exercise of market power.

The ISO argues that the effect of the FERC's December 8 Order on supply=20
sufficiency in the ISO=01,s real time=20
Imbalance Energy market was immediate and beneficial.  It states the=20
following in support.  Although supply=20
in California is still very tight, after implementation of Amendment No. 33=
,=20
there were bids available in the ISO=01,s=20
"BEEP Stack" to address California=01,s real time balancing needs for the f=
irst=20
time in nearly a week. Immediately=20
after the order was issued 3000 to 5000 MW of Generation internal to=20
California and up to an additional 1990 MW=20
of imports became available to the ISO.  The following day there was only o=
ne=20
hour in which reserves dropped=20
below 6% and one hour in which reserves were as great as 10%. In addition, =
it=20
alleges that the implementation=20
of Amendment No. 33 has substantially relieved the burden which had=20
previously been placed on the ISO=01,s=20
operators by in-state Generators attempting to negotiate prices in real tim=
e=20
in response to ISO Dispatch instructions.

The ISO also requests that the Commission clarify its December 8 Order to=
=20
confirm that sellers submitting bids=20
above $250 in the ISO=01,s Imbalance Energy Market are required to report t=
heir=20
bids and provide cost information=20
on a weekly basis not only to the Commission, but also to the California=20
Electricity Oversight Board and the ISO. =20

The ISO requests clarification that the Commission intended to approve the=
=20
proposed December 12,=20
2000 effective date for the cost allocation elements of Amendment No. 33.

Tracy,  Do we have concerns here.  We pointed out to the PX that there was 
excess credit.  By using collateral to pay these bills are we not keeping 
required levels available?

Richard, My thought is that the first sentence is ok, but not the second, and 
Bonnie is conveying that to McConville's lawyer.  MHC

McConville's counsel has asked us for language in addition to a mere 
representation that the Enron Milford certificate of incorporation applies to 
ENA to the effect that we will cooperate or at least not unreasonably oppose 
Kevin's making a claim for indemnification should the situation arise.  I 
have drafted language along the lines of what I think he is asking for.  Is 
this something that we would consider agreeing to?

Several weeks ago Ecogas entered into an LOI to sell substantially all of the 
assets to a company called Pacific Natural Energy in return for cash ($3.25 
MM) and forgiveness of debt ($750K) at the Ecogas Corp. level.  The assets 
being acquired are as follows:

Ecogas McCommas Bluff, Inc. (100% of the securities)
Ecovest-Nelson Gardens, LLC (100% of Ecogas' equity = 50.1% of the project 
equity)
Medio Creek, LLC (100% of the securities)
Rosenberg project (currently an Ecogas Corp. asset, not an SPV)
both the Skyline and Westside projects (also currently Ecogas Corp. assets)

PNE is NOT acquiring Ecogas' 50% W.I. in Fresh Gas, LLC (the other 50% owned 
by Montauk Energy).  Ecogas is settling all outstanding accounts, issues, 
etc... with Montauk via a "global settlement" which will include Ecogas 
transferring to Montauk its 50% equity in Fresh Gas.  

PNE paid $150K as a down payment (when the LOI was signed) and will fund the 
balance at closing with the exception of a 10% holdback ($325K) for a 6 month 
period to cover unknown contingencies.  The net cash at closing ($2.775MM) is 
being used as follows:

$139K to bring the bonds at McCommas Bluff (which is being acquired by PNE) 
current
$75 - 100K for misc. legal contingencies (pending litigation)
$118K to true up a Letter of Credit for the Rosenberg project which Ecogas 
used for W/C
$101K to settle 70+ Tier 2 (<$10K ea.) Creditors = 100 cents/$
$1,953K to settle 20+ Tier 1 (>$10K ea.) Creditors, including Montauk Energy 
= 50 cents/$
$380K to settle the 5 Employment Contracts = 50 cents/$
The balance of funds, if any, will be used as a "cushion" against misc 
unexpected/unknown items

As part of the creditor settlements mentioned above, Ecogas will have 
executed Separation and Release Agreements with all 5 employees currently 
under Employment Contracts, including Jerrel Branson.  However, as part of 
Jerrel's settlement, he will agree to transfer ownership of his 15% equity in 
Ecogas Corp. back to either the company or over to ENA.  After the 
transaction is completed, Ecogas Corp. will essentially be a shell company 
with only one project asset left, which is in Austin.  Ecogas' intent is to 
notify the City of Austin (after closing the sale to PNE) that it intends to 
exercise its "commercial out" under the contract with the City.  Once this is 
done Ecogas will only have misc assets (desks, computers, etc... which PNE 
doesn't want) and a small amount of cash (maybe $20-50K) left (not including 
any money from the 10% holdback which may be refunded after 6 months).  Our 
intent is to have all the remaining files, records, etc... transferred here 
to Enron (I will have them shipped to me) as ENA will be the only shareholder 
left.  

Let me know if there are any other issues, action items, etc... I need to 
initiate in order to make the final transition to ENA complete.  If you have 
any questions or if I can be of any assistance please don't hesitate to call 
me at x33212.

IS TRADING AN INSIDER'S GAME?
Buying, selling of electricity is a growth business, but some say deck is 
stacked against consumers


By Craig D. Rose
STAFF WRITER

June 6, 2001



While Californians decry deregulation's failure to deliver a competitive 
market, electricity wholesalers have quietly developed a vast and rapidly 
growing business of buying and selling power among themselves.

The deals take place on high-tech trading floors in Houston and elsewhere 
around the country, as well as on Internet-based trading systems.

Some experts say this electricity trading is a key mechanism for raising 
consumer power prices, yet it's largely unregulated.

"Electricity trading is like buying stock -- when you have ability to change 
the stock price," said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economics professor 
and member of the state grid operator's market surveillance group.

Energy companies say the buying and selling of contracts to deliver power 
provides risk management, allowing plant owners to presell their electricity, 
lock in prices and avoid fluctuations. The rough and tumble of the free 
market, they add, is the most efficient means of allocating a resource like 
electricity.

But industry critics say trading is far from a competitive market paradigm. 
In their view, it's a means of communication -- a way for energy insiders to 
collude and raise prices under the guise of competition.

To be sure, the trading arms of major energy companies have emerged as stars 
in an industry where profit surges of 300 percent or 400 percent are not 
uncommon.

The transactions, shrouded in secrecy, can leave ownership of a critical 
commodity in unknown hands. Consider the case of power generated by AES 
Corp.'s California plants.

In 1998, AES made a bold move. Immediately after purchasing power plants that 
gave it control of 10 percent of the state's electric generating capacity, 
the company sold the output from its plants for the next 20 years to Williams 
Cos.

Williams did not sit on this treasure trove of electrons. The Tulsa, Okla., 
company soon sold 80 percent of what it bought.

It is difficult to say who owns that power now. Some might be owned by Sempra 
Trading, a sister company of SDG&E. Or some could be owned by Enron Corp., 
the nation's biggest electricity trader.

A spokeswoman for Williams conceded that Williams itself may have repurchased 
some of the electricity it sold earlier. But trading companies closely guard 
their positions.

This much can be said with certainty: Electricity that AES sold for less than 
5 cents per kilowatt-hour to Williams changed hands perhaps 10 times in the 
wholesale market and emerged at times in recent months with a price tag for 
consumers that was 300 percent higher.

Williams' trading profits increased by 523 percent in the first quarter this 
year.


Advance sales
All this buying and selling creates curious confluences.
In their attempt to deflect criticism over high prices, generating companies 
such as Duke Energy -- operator of the South Bay Power Plant in Chula and 
others in the state -- frequently note that they sell most of their 
electricity far in advance. But they acknowledge less often that their 
trading units may also be buying power, which could boost the company's 
electricity inventory.

Duke was the fourth biggest electricity trader last year and cited its 
trading activity as a prime contributor to its wholesale business profits, 
which soared 324 percent in the first quarter to $348 million.

It is a company's power traders who frequently direct plant operators to 
increase or decrease the generation of power in response to market conditions.

Energy companies have little option but to turn to trading for profits. One 
of the better kept secrets of electrical deregulation and its promise of 
competition is that there is remarkably little competition in the production 
side of the business.

For one thing, electricity is a commodity; power from one company is 
indistinguishable from that generated by others.

More important, nearly all modern plants generate power from turbines built 
by a handful of manufacturers. The result? Modern plants owned by different 
companies produce power at nearly identical cost.

"The cost of power produced by modern plants is all within a mil 
(one-thousandth of a dollar)," said Michael Peevey, an adviser to Gov. Gray 
Davis and former president of Southern California Edison.

So the extraction of profit in the electricity business relies much more on 
trading. Traders' profits rise when prices are volatile -- plunging, or even 
better, rising sharply.


Little regulation
But despite the obvious temptation to manipulate the market, the burgeoning 
electricity trading business has remained largely unregulated.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission does require quarterly filings from 
energy traders, but these often provide incomplete information, or at least 
little that has been of concern to FERC.

In fact, although the trading of electricity grew more than a hundredfold 
from 1996 to 2000, FERC has taken no major enforcement action against a 
trader. After the onset of the California crisis last year, FERC has acted 
once. That was against Williams, which agreed to pay $8 million without 
admitting guilt to resolve an allegation that it withheld supply to pump up 
prices.

FERC's record of enforcement in the area of power trading stands in contrast 
to a long list of enforcement actions within other markets taken by the 
Securities Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

FERC has recently added staff to its market oversight operations. But William 
Massey, a FERC commissioner, says the agency's effort is still inadequate.

"Electricity can be flipped, stripped and chopped up," Massey said. "It's an 
extraordinarily complicated market.

"The sophisticated marketers and traders have simply moved past us. We're 
kind of horse and buggy in our approach and they're out there in rocket ships 
flying around ... The problem is that sophisticated traders don't necessarily 
produce reasonable prices. They produce profits."

Before deregulation, electricity trading was a low-key affair. Regulated 
utilities dealt power back and forth on a reciprocal basis to fill 
electricity shortfalls in their control areas. There was little trading for 
profit until the mid-1990s, after federal legislation and FERC rulings opened 
the market.

Major traders include large energy companies, sister companies of 
California's major utilities and Wall Street firms.


Market volatility
In many ways, the trading of power is similar to that of other commodities. 
But there are important differences. Because it cannot be stored and its use 
is so fundamental, the price of electricity is the most volatile of all.
When supplies are tight, a single supplier can rapidly raise prices to 
budget-busting levels, as evidenced by Duke Energy's recent admission that it 
charged California nearly $4,000 for a megawatt-hour of power, a quantity 
that probably sold hours earlier for one-tenth of that sum or less.

Wolak, the Stanford economist, and state Sen. Joseph Dunn, D-Garden Grove, 
who is investigating the state power market, say trading allows companies to 
collude under the guise of competition. Instead of wringing out lowest costs, 
the wholesale trading market serves to raise prices, they say.

"As I trade to you and you trade to me, we communicate to each other what 
price we would like to get," said Wolak. "It's not collusive. It's just 
communicating price."

Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Enron, the nation's biggest power trader, said 
California's problem is not the result of trading.

"It's a result of shortages," Palmer said.

Underscoring its emphasis on trading, Enron's new headquarters tower in 
downtown Houston rises from a six-story block of new trading floors, 
including expanded space for electricity trading.

Enron also pioneered trading in cyberspace and its Enron Online site claims 
to be the most active computer-based trading market.

The Houston company argues that consumers won't fully benefit from power 
trading and deregulation until they have greater choice in choosing their 
power supplier. And the company says FERC has not done enough to open access 
to transmission lines, which would allow traders to move power around the 
country. To that end, Enron has lobbied hard for President Bush's plan for a 
national electricity grid.

Palmer says the notion that the price of electricity rises each time it is 
traded is mistaken.

"The market is always looking for the real price of a commodity," Palmer said.

Dunn, the California state senator, says his investigation found a different 
function for trading. At a time when supply barely meets or falls short of 
demand, he noted, companies with electricity to sell have to worry only about 
how high to set their price.

"The trader is a pawn in the generator's game to drive up prices," said Dunn. 
"Trading develops a level of trust. You, my alleged competitor, will bid in 
the same patterns and I will respond not in a competitive pattern but in a 
complimentary pattern."

The state senator said his investigation found evidence that on several days, 
energy companies appeared to test their ability to drive prices up, without 
being undercut by competitors.

This ability to drive up prices without competitive consequence is a key test 
of market power, the technical term for manipulation or price fixing.

But Dunn also conceded that antitrust violations can be hard to prove in 
court. He suggested that even if the trading behavior falls short of 
antitrust violations, it remains anti-competitive and devastating for the 
California economy.

To Harry Trebing, a utility industry expert and professor emeritus at 
Michigan State University, wholesale electricity trading is reminiscent of 
what took place in the 1920s and early '30s. Back then, utility companies 
created complex networks of holding companies that traded stock among 
themselves, driving up prices in the process.

Undoing that scheme was a focus of President Franklin Roosevelt's 
administration. Congress ended up barring national power companies and 
tightening regulation of utilities, in an effort to counteract their tendency 
to create markets that work only for insiders.

"The broad goals of trading are the same," Trebing said.

"The goal is to maximize profits through raising prices."

Chuck,

The total SWPC outstanding invoices for the Feb. and Apr. wrecks which we
have received at the plant comes to a total of $1,641,273.54 which is a
little more than what you indicated. This figure includes SWPC: parts
credit; repair labor; balance instruments & labor; NDE testing.

On a separate note shouldn't the actual insurance claim include not only the
SWPC charges but also other costs absorbed by the plant such as bolting kit
parts, plant labor costs, consultants cost, etc. We have these costs broken
out as well as the SWPC charges.

The ISO plans to comply with recent EOB and CPUC subpoenas unless FERC or a
court tells them not to.  DO we care about this?

Question for  Mary and Ron -- Are they trying to get around the FERC--
given the CPUC's filing there asking for authority to get info?

Also, as Mary is aware, the WPTF will be submitting a protest to SCE's
request to FERC to have the ISO's MSC release data to SCE that the MSC
claims identify those who have abused market power.

To Market Participants and Scheduling Coordinators:

The CA ISO believes it has complied with its obligations under CA ISO
Tariff
section 20.3.4 as to the December 4 EOB subpoena and the September 21 CPUC

the CA ISO will comply with the EOB and  CPUC subpoenas on December 20
unless it receives and order to the contrary from a court or the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission.

In addition, the CA ISO has received requests from the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission and the state agencies for information on generator
unit outages.  This information is not subject to tariff section 20.3.4
which protects only Generator Outage programs.  Nonetheless, the CA ISO is
providing this notice as a curtesy matter.  The CA ISO will provide the
requested information to FERC and the state agencies.  The CA ISO has in
the
past requested confidential treatment for information on the cause of an
outage and projected in service date since this information could be used
by
Market Participants to manipulate the market, and it will make such a
request as to cause and in service dates in the context of the current
requests.

       David,

chemist may meet with theirs.  Please so advise Steve Jones, provide him with 
a copy of Underwriters' response to our claim, and have him meet with 
Underwriters' adjuster as soon as possible.

 Jim,

 This will confirm our telephone conference about this matter, in light of 
Underwriters' recent response to our claim.  You will ask Underwriters' 
adjuster for permission for our chemist to speak directly with their chemist 
immediately about the facts.  You will also ask for a meeting to be set up 
for you, our broker, and Underwriters' adjuster to see whether Underwriters 
mean to take a hard line on our claim.

 Interestingly, Underwriters' position seems to be, at least preliminarily, 
and subject to further comment by their chemists, that nothing was wrong with 
our cargo or the ship; the cargo was simply misdescribed as turbine 
fuel-grade condensate by SGS due to flawed testing by SGS at loadport, when 
it was in fact nothing better than crude. Meanwhile, we all noted that 
Underwriters' adjuster included the following statement in her report:  "It 
has not been demonstrated that the oil suffered from inherent vice."  I am 
both pleased and surprised that this was included in Underwriters' report, 
and share David's feeling that the adjuster probably inadvertantly copied 
this from a confidential report from her chemist.  If we can successfully 
hammer at Underwriters' preliminary theory, Underwriters will find it more 
difficult to fall back on an inherent vice defense.

 I await further word from you.  Many thanks for your help.

 Britt

Privileged and Confidential Joint Defense Communication

To:     Grynberg JDT Participants
From:  Don Schultz
Re:     Deadline Tomorrow - 3 points.
          1.  Attached is a draft letter to Judge Downes as discussed in this 
afternoon's telephone conference.  Please share any feedback or edits as soon 
as you can, as this needs to be filed tomorrow.
          2.  I asked Dana Eismeier if Grynberg plans to file anything on 
this Wright motion.  He said Hosie has a footnote in his motion to assert no 
other relators should be permitted to participate in the deposition.  This 
was a hostile reaction to the letter Grynberg counsel had sent to Hosie on 
the subject.  For tomorrow, Eismeier wants to refrain from the high state of 
animosity that has marked prior exchanges with Hosie and so plans to file a 
motion to extend the deadline for a week to promote discussions to work 
something out.  If they don't work something out Grynberg will file something 
to demand participation.   I don't think this changes what we discussed today 
and think we should go ahead to finalize our letter.
         3.  Attached is a revision of the Wright group brief.  This version 
goes further in proposing schedule steps for original source issues than I 
expected the rewrite would go (and predicted in this afternoon's call).  
Please take a look at this version.   Let me know if you feel we should 
arrange a call fairly early tomorrow to try to provide feedback to the Wright 
drafters, or, send me your comments to be collected and forwarded to those 
folks.  Thanks.

Hello, Mr. Sanders.  I am Marty Sunde's assistant and I am writing regarding 
the 11/22/00 letter from Palmer, Guest & Esses regarding Euell Energy 
Resources.  The letter was addressed to Mr. Lay and Marty Sunde in EES 
received a copy.  We sent the letter to our General Counsel, Vicki Sharp, who 
advises that she passed it on to you for handling.  As the 12/15/00 deadline 
(set forth in Mr. Esses' letter) is approaching, I thought I would follow up 
to see if a response has been provided to them.  If this has already been 
taken care of, would you be so kind as to fax a copy of the letter to us for 
our file.  Our fax number is (713) 646-2199.

Please let me know.  

Thank you.

In process.  We will coordinate this with the other defendants, as the
letter did not come directly to us.  Note also that we have served (but have
not filed) Rule 11 motions on Grynberg.  A reminder of that may be part of
the response.

Richard and Bill,

The following clean up needs to be done before we finalize our pre-trial
materials due 7/3/01:

          1.  Interview Enron employees Paul Pizzolato, Chris Helfrich, and
Jim Easter to ascertain (a) whether they have sufficient memory of the NSM
transaction that we should add them to our witness list to strengthen our
testimony about the quality and quantity of Enron's due diligence and (b)
whether they have any documents or computer files that should have been
produced earlier in response to the basic document requests in the case. 
(This is not an entirely defensive exercise; Pizzolato or Helfrich might have
computer models that would strengthen our case.)

          2.  Go back to Ray Bowen and find out if he/ECM has documents
relating to NSM.  We asked him before, but he never responded.  Jim Easter
might know the answer to this question, if he is still in ECM

          3.  Talk to Chris Hunt to ascertain whether he or someone else in
his (former?) group should be added to our witness list to discuss due
diligence carried out by Enron International.

          4.  Figure out how we can prove with admissible evidence the precise
amounts of all of Enron's investments in NSM and the identity of the
particular Enron entity making each of those investments.  I have pieced most
of the necessary facts together from McDonald documents and a privileged Akin
Gump memo.  This will not do at trial, unless everyone stipulates to the
facts, which I would not count on.  I know it sounds simple, but we need a
witness on this point and records to back him/her up.

          5.  Consider whether we need to include someone from Bear Stearns,
ECT Securities' clearing firm, on our witness list.  We have to prove that ECT
Securities did not purchase or sell any NSM securities.  Donna Lowry (or
possibly Kevin) may be able to flat out testify to this, but it would be a lot
better to back her/him up with account records.  Donna has recently obtained
the necessary records from Bear Stearns; but, unless everyone will stipulate
to admissibility of these records, I am not sure that Donna alone can get them
in.  We may need a Bear Stearns person.  Maybe we could just list such a
person generically on our witness until we see if the parties will stipulate.

Bill, a number of these matters may still be open when I leave in a week, so
you will have to follow up (unless the 7/3 deadline gets extended on 6/21). 
Jonathan Goldblatt can help.  Typically, Richard likes to talk with any
present or former Enron employee before we do.

Steve

Rich,
 Thank you for the update.  I would like to speak to you today about
some other practical suggestions that we have relating to email handling.  I
also want to tell you about a situation that came up in the past few days.
In short, one employee's computer hard drive ran out of space related to the
do not delete directive.  We decided to have the employee move sufficient
files from the hard drive on to the network (so they would be backed up on
tape) and then authorized the employee to delete those files that had been
moved to create sufficient work space so that they could do their job.  We
anticipate that this issue may arise again and we intend to follow the same
procedure.

 I will call you to discuss these issues.

Thanks
Gary

Gentlemen:

Tom Hall wrote me today saying (among other things) that he wants to take 
Steve Hamilton's deposition either the week of Dec. 18 or Dec. 25 (no, that's 
not a typo).  I have attached my proposed response.  Let me know if you 
cannot open it and I'll re-send the text.

Steve:  Since we will eventually have to present you, and I doubt we can push 
it off very far, start thinking about when you're available for depo. in 
early to mid-January.

Thanks,

Max, we agree with you 100% that there are much stronger defenses to
McKenna's claims and appreciate the importance of not involving the
offtakers into this dispute.  However, we want to be prepared for what is
likely to be McKenna's "strongest" argument, especially if he digs up some
affidavits from some of his cronies, or if he tries to take some
depositions.  Can we talk more about this next week?  Does Wednesday work
for you?  Thanks.  Ileana

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL:  ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION, ATTORNEY WORK 
PRODUCT--URGENT

Harry, Heidi and David,

 The above-referenced lawsuit is filed in the Southern District of New York 
by PT Kaltim Rima Coal, who allegedly had a long-term coal purchase agreement 
with AES Barbers Point, for delivery to AES in Hawaii.  In brief, PT contends 
that AES breached that agreement through the use of a bogus force majeure 
letter, in order to allow AES to purchase coal from some Enron entity at a 
cheaper spot market price in September or October of this year.

 PT's attorneys, Lord, Bissell & Brook out of Chicago, have served us with a 
subpoena on Enron Coal Company.  How they decided that Enron Coal Company was 
the correct entity is not something I yet know.   I have been advised that 
Enron Coal Company is a long-dormant subsidiary of Enron Property.  Although 
using Enron Coal Company's name throughout, the subpoena also references 
Harry, Riaz Rizvi, Allen Childress, Stuart Staley and/or John Bowman.  I 
understand that we probably did do a deal (maybe more than one) with AES, but 
need to be corrected if I am wrong.

 The subpoena requests that a corporate representative for Enron Coal Company 
appear with documents on January 8 in Houston to be deposed about the deal 
with AES.

 I would like to respond tomorrow, by telefax, to PT's attorneys and advise 
that Enron Coal Company is the wrong company.  If all I do is stall them, 
however, they can yank the information from us the hard way (assuming that we 
did do the deal in question) and eventually get what they want.  The suit is 
for about $4,000,000, so it is worth the while of PT's attorneys to pursue 
this subpoena.  Accordingly, I need one of you to tell me as soon as possible 
whether 

 (a) we did such a deal with AES during the relevant time frame, and if so, 
the exact name of the Enron entity on the deal;

 (b) who the trader on the deal was; and,

 (c) who has the documents regarding the deal.

Although I have briefly described the information I need, I also need to get 
the name of the right person to telefax the subpoena to for review, to see 
how broad the scope of the request for documents/witnesses really is. 

I would greatly appreciate this preliminary information by the close of 
business tomorrow, Thursday, in London/Australia.  I apologize for the 
extremely short time frame.  I was only given this subpoena last Friday, and 
have spent the days since chasing people down.  Please don't shoot the 
messenger. 

Britt

 At our meeting in San Francisco yesterday a group of you asked we
re-publish our memorandum regarding the subpoena power of California
legislative committee. Here is a slightly edited version.



1. What is the basis of a  Legislative Committee's Subpoena Power?

Authority:   Government Code Section 9401, provides that "a subpoena
requiring the attendance of any witness before the Senate, Assembly, or a
committee may be issued by the President of the Senate, Speaker of the
Assembly, or the chairman of any committee before whom the attendance of the
witness is desired if permission has been secured from the rules committee
of the respective house."

Govt. Code Section 9402 provides that a subpoena is sufficient if it "(a)
states whether the proceeding is before the Senate, Assembly or a committee.
(b) is addressed to the witness [presumably the custodian of records when
documents are sought]. (c) requires the attendance of the witness at a time
and place certain and (d) is signed by the President of the Senate, Speaker
of the Assembly or chairman of the committee before whom attendance of the
witness is desired."

Contempt Power:  If the witness does not appear or refuses to testify or
"neglects or refuses ... to produce upon reasonable notice any material and
proper books, papers or document sin his possession or under his control, he
has committed a contempt."  Govt. Code Section 9405.   If the contempt is
committed while the Legislature is in session, Govt. Code Section 9407
provides that the committee shall report the contempt to the Senate or
Assembly "for such action as may be deemed necessary by the Senate or
Assembly."  If the Legislature is not in session, "the superior court in and
for the county in which any inquiry, investigation hearing or proceeding
[is] held ... may compel the ... production of books, papers, documents and
accounts, as required by the subpoena issued by the committee, on the filing
by the committee of a petition to the court asking that the witness be so
compelled."

Govt. Code Section 9409 provides that "any witness neglecting or refusing to
attend in obedience to subpoena may be arrested...."  It is unclear how this
provision would or could be applied to a subpoena issued to the custodian of
records of a non-resident company.

Motion to Quash Subpoena: California courts have held, under C.C.P. Section
1985, that a motion to quash is the procedurally appropriate method of
testing the validity of a subpoena duces tecum.  See e.g. People ex rel.
Dept. of Public Works v. Younger (1970) 5 Cal.App.3d 575.  My research has
revealed no case in which a subpoena issued by a legislative committee has
been challenged by a motion to quash, but, as noted above, there appear to
be only a very few cases interpreting Govt. Code 9401 et seq.   Therefore,
it appears that a superior court may be able to grant a motion to quash a
subpoena issued by a legislative committee (assuming that we want to take
the risk of state court jurisdiction).

In one early case, the Court of Appeal held that the contempt order and
accompanying affidavit issued by the Court upon the request of a Senate
Committee were fatally defective.  Ex Parte McLain (1950) 99 Cal.App.2d 274.
In McLain, the Senate Interim Committee on Social Welfare served upon Mr.
McLain, the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of a corporation a subpoena
calling for the production of various books, papers and documents.  Mr.
McLain appeared before the committee but refused to answer questions or
produce the documents.  Upon representation of the Committee, the Superior
Court issued an order directing Mr. McLain to produce the documents.  Mr.
McLain again appeared before the Committee and again refused to produce the
documents at which point, an affidavit was filed in Superior Court stating:

"That, based upon evidence in its possession, the said Senate Interim
Committee has determined that each of the books, papers, and documents
specified in said subpoena duces tecum is material to the matters now under
investigation by the said Senate Interim Committee, and the production of
such books, papers and documents is necessary in order to enable said Senate
Interim Committee properly to perform the duties imposed upon it and to
report to the Senate of the State of California pursuant to said Senate
Resolution No. 162." and "That each of the books, papers and documents
specified in said subpoena duces tecum is material to the matters now under
investigation by the said Senate Interim Committee and that the production
of such books, papers and documents is necessary in order to enable said
Senate Interim Committee properly to perform the duties imposed upon it and
to report to the Senate of the State of California pursuant to said Senate
Resolution No. 162."

The Superior Court found Mr. McLain guilty of contempt and ordered him
committed to the sheriff until he produced the records.  The Court of
Appeals found that the order and affidavit were defective because "a witness
who is otherwise orderly and respectful cannot be adjudged guilty of
contempt unless the order affirmatively sets forth the materiality and
pertinency of the books and papers called for.  In cases of constructive
contempt, as is this, not only the order but also the affidavit upon which
it is based must sufficiently charge the alleged facts constituting the
offense."  McLain at 276.

This holding appears to be somewhat consistent with cases interpreting
C.C.P. 1985, which hold that the subpoena and affidavits must allege
material facts rather than conclusory statements.  See e.g. Grannis v. Board
of Medical Examiners (1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 551.

However, cases interpreting C.C.P. 1985 also require the subpoena to
demonstrate a level of specificity, materiality and relevance to be held
proper.  See e.g. Pacific Auto Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1969) 273
Cal.App.2d 61.  It is unclear, but arguable that subpoenas issued by
legislative committees will be held to this same standard.


2.  What is the likely impact of a legislative committee subpoena issued
against Enron for out-of-state Enron documents?


 There is little case law interpreting Govt. Code 9401 et seq. and the Govt.
Code reporters cross reference to the Code of Civil Procedure Sections on
issuance of subpoenas (C.C.P. 1985, et seq.).  Therefore, it is likely that
the provisions of both the Govt. Code and the C.C.P. will govern the
issuance and enforceability of a subpoena issued by a legislative committee.
Accordingly we use these provisions to analyze this question.


 (a)  Subpoenas against out-of-state residents under C.C.P. 1985 et
seq.

C.C.P. 1989 is entitled "Residency requirements for attendance of witnesses"
and provides that "A witness, including a witness specified in subdivision
(b) of Section 1987, is not obliged to attend as a witness before any court,
judge, justice or any other officer, unless the witness is a resident within
the state at the time of service."

However, there is a statutory limitation on the residency requirement
imposed by Section 1989.  Section 1987.3 provides "[w]hen a subpoena duces
tecum is served upon a custodian of records or other qualified witness as
provided in Article 4 (commencing with Section 1560) of Chapter 2 of
Division 11 of the Evidence Code, and his personal attendance is not
required by the terms of the subpoena, Section 1989 shall not apply."
(Evade. Code 1650 lays out the terms for compliance with a subpoena for
business records where the business is "neither a party nor the place where
any cause of action is alleged to have arisen.")

On commentator noted the following with respect to C.C.P. 1987.3:

"The rule limiting subpoenas to California "residents" (C.C.P. 1989) does
not apply to a subpoena duces tecum served on custodians of records unless
their personal attendance is required. See C.C.P. 1987.3; Amoco Chem. Co. v.
Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's of London (1995) 34 Cal.App.4th 554, 561 fn.
9.  Thus, a nonresident custodian of business records may be required to
respond to a subpoena duces tecum served upon him or her while present in
California, by producing the records in accordance with Cal. Evid. Code 1560
(delivering copies of the records and accompanying affidavit to the court
clerk)... [However], C.C.P. 1987.3 probably applies only where the
nonresident custodian is employed by a business entity subject to California
jurisdiction. Otherwise, there would be no way for the court to enforce
compliance with a subpoena served on a nonresident.  See Amoco Chem. Co. v.
Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's of London, supra."

Werner, Fairbanks & Epstein, Rutter Group, California Practice Guide: Civil
Procedure & Trials at 1.57-58

Moreover, in one unpublished case, Allee v. King (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 1081,
the court held that it lacked power to compel a nonresident defendant to
produce original out-of-state documents at trial.  In so holding, the court
stated that:

"even though King apparently voluntarily attended the trial, his presence
does not confer jurisdiction on the court to oblige him to deliver the
out-of-state documents.   Although section 1989 uses the word "witness" and
does not refer to documents, it has long been presumed under common law that
documents in other states are outside the court's territorial jurisdiction,
so that a court will allow the use of copies or other secondary evidence
instead of originals.  (See, e.g., Heinz v. Heinz (1946) 73 Cal.App.2d 61,
66, 165 P.2d 967, and cases cited therein.)   The recognition that
out-of-state documents are not subject to the court's process is in
conformity with the general rule under common law that, absent a statute
properly conferring broader powers, the extent of a state's subpoena power
and its accompanying subpoena duces tecum power is coterminous with its
borders.  (See 97 C.J.S., Witnesses, S 17, p. 367, S 23, p. 375, S 25, p.
380;  81 Am.Jur.2d, Witnesses, S 8, p. 32, S 14, p. 39.)

However, the Allee court notes that the "state-border" limitation on
subpoena power has not been extended to local branches of national
corporations who are subpoenaed to deliver documents which are out-of-state.
Therefore, even under Allee, if a subpoena was issued to an  Enron entity
within California that possessed responsive documents, that Enron entity may
be obligated to respond.  See Boal v. Price Waterhouse & Co. (1985) 165
Cal.App.3d 806.

Therefore, if a subpoena is issued which requires the attendance of an
out-of-state officer of Enron, Enron has a very good argument that that
witness is not obligated to attend under C.C.P. 1989.  It also seems
probable that, under Amoco and Allele cited above, if a subpoena is served
on an Enron custodian of records who is employed by a non-California Enron
entity, the subpoena may be invalid.  However, if a subpoena seeking the
production of documents is served on the custodian of records (or someone
similarly situated) who is employed by an Enron entity that possesses
responsive documents and is subject to personal jurisdiction in California,
that Enron entity most likely is obligated to produce the documents.  While
it is an open question, Enron can certainly argue that the custodian of
records employed by an Enron entity in California would only be required to
produce the Enron documents in the possession of the Enron California
entity.  (This question is addressed somewhat in the commentary on the
C.C.P. 2020 statutory scheme, see below, but is still open.)


 (b)  Subpoenas against out-of-state residents under C.C.P. 2020 et
seq.

An additional threshold question regarding the territorial effect of this
subpoena concerns whether it is should be considered a deposition subpoena.
The question is:  If the legislative subpoena was treated as a "deposition
subpoena," would a court deciding the enforceability of a legislative
subpoena treat Enron as a "party" or as a "non-party"?

The rules governing the reach of discovery in California are obviously
different for the two.  The deposition of a party or party-affiliated
witness may be noticed (without a subpoena) for a place within 75 miles of
the witness' residence.  It is unclear how a court would resolve this issue.
After all, if a court was resolving the issue at all, an Enron entity will
have appeared before it. and would be a "party."  However, it seems
moderately more likely that the court would treat Enron's obligations under
the legislative committee subpoena as similar to its obligations if it was
served with a "non-party" subpoena.

There are three types of "deposition subpoena":  a "testimony only subpoena"
(requires only the attendance and testimony of the witness), a "business
records subpoena" (requires only the production of business records) and a
"records and testimony subpoena" (requires both -- also formerly called
subpoena duces tecum).  The second of these is the most relevant to Enron.

The attendance of an non party out-of-state witness or the production of
documents can be compelled only under the law of the place where the
deposition is to be taken.  C.C.P. 2026 (b)(2).  Specifically, C.C.P.
2026(b)(2) provides "If the deponent is not a party to the action or an
officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party, a party serving a
deposition notice under this section shall use any process and procedures
required and available under the laws of the state, territory, or insular
possession where the deposition is to be taken to compel the deponent to
attend and to testify, as well as to produce any document or tangible thing
for inspection, copying, and any related activity."

Some states issue subpoenas routinely, some require a showing of materiality
or relevancy, and some require a commission from the court where the action
is pending.    This question will depend on the law of the state when the
custodian of records resides.

Regarding the question of whether the service of a deposition subpoena on an
in-state custodian of records would compel the production of out-of-state
documents.  Weil & Brown, Rutter Group, California Practice Guide: Civil
Procedure Before Trial at 5:540.4 notes:

"It is unclear whether service of a "business records" subpoena on a
nonparty corporation in California compels production of its records located
outside the state. ... C.C.P. 2020(d) requires that the subpoena be directed
to the records "custodian" (or someone authorized to certify the records).
Whether "custodian" requires actual custody of the records is unclear. If it
does, serving an officer or agent in California would not compel production
of business records located elsewhere. The result is different where a
"records and testimony" subpoena is used. That procedure extends to records
in control of the subpoenaed party, not merely in his or her custody."

Here is the letter I was referring to yesterday sent by Reliant's Sacramento
counsel to Senator Dunn.  In paragraph no. 1, Charles Stevens refers to how
small Reliant's market share is in the WSCC power market.  He suggests that
the Committee obtain the entire database, which reflects all bidders in the
market.  He goes on to say that the information from obtaining all of the
data would give a far more accurate picture than could be obtained by
looking at the data of a few "generators".

This letter plus some comments that Larry Drivon made to Michael Molland
gave rise to the inference that Reliant's counsel, Charles Stevens, may have
been suggesting in his discussions with Senator Dunn's staff that Enron
should be included in the process.  It may be that the inference will turn
out not to be accurate.  That is all the information we have on the subject.


Thanks.

 Jim,

 This will confirm our telephone conference about this matter, in light of 
Underwriters' recent response to our claim.  You will ask Underwriters' 
adjuster for permission for our chemist to speak directly with their chemist 
immediately about the facts.  You will also ask for a meeting to be set up 
for you, our broker, and Underwriters' adjuster to see whether Underwriters 
mean to take a hard line on our claim.

 Interestingly, Underwriters' position seems to be, at least preliminarily, 
and subject to further comment by their chemists, that nothing was wrong with 
our cargo or the ship; the cargo was simply misdescribed as turbine 
fuel-grade condensate by SGS due to flawed testing by SGS at loadport, when 
it was in fact nothing better than crude. Meanwhile, we all noted that 
Underwriters' adjuster included the following statement in her report:  "It 
has not been demonstrated that the oil suffered from inherent vice."  I am 
both pleased and surprised that this was included in Underwriters' report, 
and share David's feeling that the adjuster probably inadvertantly copied 
this from a confidential report from her chemist.  If we can successfully 
hammer at Underwriters' preliminary theory, Underwriters will find it more 
difficult to fall back on an inherent vice defense.

 I await further word from you.  Many thanks for your help.

 Britt

There was a lengthy status conference this afternoon, lasting about an hour
and a quarter.  It was marred by extremely poor telephone connections.  The
technical difficulties frustrated the parties and the judge and made the
conference a mess.

Without trying to summarize the conference, I note a few things that the
Court decided to do based on the discussions.


1.   Quinque.  Judge Downes agreed to have oral argument on the motion to
remand in Quinque on January 3, 2001 at 1:15 p.m. in Casper.  One hour was
set aside for argument.  He declined Mike Beatty's suggestion of an
additional executive summary of the briefing.  The judge was the first one
to suggest the oral argument.  The plaintiffs suggested that the Court rule
on the papers, but quickly acquiesced to the Court's suggestion when the
defendants said that they wanted argument.

2.    Osterhoudt.   Osterhoudt appeared pro se.  Motion to disqualify
Wright's counsel (Phillips & Cohen) and estopping Mr. Wright on some claims.
Both Osterhoudt and Wright want oral argument.  Wright defendants and DOJ
didn't object.  Osterhoudt was appearing pro se, and so there was a long
rambling discussion of the matter.  The judge was reluctant to cut off a pro
se party, but ultimately did.  Regrettably, the rambling discussion set the
tone for the rest of the call.

3.   Osterhoudt.   Government's motion to dismiss Ousterhoudt's case.
Government wants its motion to dismiss Grynberg's valuation claims to be
heard at the same time.  The government claims these relator status issues
are holding up the Shell $56 million settlement and any future settlements.
Grynberg objected to having the motion in Grynberg heard at the same time.
Grynberg wants discovery from Wright and the government.

4.    Pending Motions.  The Court, of out frustration at the inability to
hear the parties and at the attempts by some to argue the merits of things
that the Court was not prepared to address, set down two hours for oral
argument on February 22, 2001, at 10:00 a.m. on all pending  motions in
Wright and Grynberg that address the jurisdictional issues discussed on the
call and the motions to dismiss.  This obviously will create some problems.
It was far from clear precisely which motions that the Court had in mind.
While there are not that many motions pending, some of the pending
government motions likely could affect public disclosure / original source
motions that the defendants could, but have not yet, filed.  The defendants
have not filed those motions yet because of a desire to first test the
complaints on Rule 9(b) grounds.

5.   Discovery.   Parties who want discovery on those issues (Grynberg and
probably the Wright defendants) were given one day to present their position
by letter to the Court.  Other parties then will have two days to respond.

6.    Liaison Counsel.   The Court designated Tom Nicholas as Liaison
Counsel for the defendants in the Wright case and Don Schultz as Liaison
Counsel for the defendants in the Quinque case.

7.    February 22 hearing.  Phil Figa, one of Grynberg's lawyers, was given
the task of leading the consultation among counsel concerning how the
pending motions should be addressed at the hearing and how the time should
be divided.

Lisa and Richard,

I wanted to give you both a heads up on the two latest bankruptcies:  Arcadia 
Energy Corp and Armstrong World Industries.  EES is the only Enron entity 
with exposure to Arcadia (approx $4MM); ECC and EES have limited exposure 
(<100K) to Armstrong and its Canadian subsidiary.  If you have any questions, 
please give Tanya, Bill, or myself a call.

Thanks,
Veronica

Please consider the following retired judges from Chicago.  I don't know any
of them personally and there is a good chance that neither does Paul Weiss:
Abner Mikva, Seymour Simon, Frank McGarr.  They come highly recommended by
my friend Marv Aspen, the Ch. Judge of the ND Ill.

in response to their request for comments on reimposition of the maximum rate 
price caps on short-term capacity releases into California.  The request for 
comments was issued in the proceedings for the San Diego complaint and the 
LADWP complaint against El Paso.

In our comments, we briefly summarize our view of how the California natural 
gas problems developed, explain how a basis differential differs from 
transportation costs, and answer the Commission's five questions.  Our major 
points are that reimposition of the price cap will not do anything to further 
reduce natural gas costs, that the market is already responding to the 
pricing signals because several pipeline projects have been announced which 
would increase capacity into and within California, and that FERC should not 
reimpose the price caps.

Please let me know ASAP if you have any problems with this filing.  I will 
have to release it to the D.C. office for filing by no later than 2:30 this 
afternoon.

Martin, Nicole and Marcus,

This will confirm our telephone conference of today's date.  Again, you 
authorized me to go forward immediately with the recommendation set forth in 
the attached Word document.  I will accordingly contact Scottsboro today and 
get the ball rolling.

Britt

P.S. to Richard--I just left you a voice-mail on this.  Marcus is fully up to 
speed if you can't catch me (my day today is pretty crazy).  I plan to 
contact Scottsboro after lunch to go forward with this.

Ruling was as follows:  if a witness appears on P's witness list AND was
deposed in the California cases and is within the "control" of a defendant
(only Barth at most, for us), then plaintiff and that defendant meet and
confer to determine whether that witness will appear live in P's case or in
D's case with cross-examination NOT limited to direct examination in either
instance (unless defendant agrees to produce the witness twice, in which case
ordinary rules apply.)  If a defendant claims that a witness is not within its
control, the court will look very skeptically on any effort by that defendant
to produce that witness later in its own case.

Hennigan tried to make the ruling include McConville and Glanville, but I beat
him back on that.  Also, defendants do NOT have to identify their own
witnesses until all parties do so simultaneously.  Hennigan tried to make the
defense go first but judge wouldn't buy it.

I suggested that the Final Status Conference be moved from 7/9 to 7/23 (since
summary judgment motions won't be heard til 7/17.).  Judge Berle seemed to
have some inclination to do this but said to raise the subject on 6/21, when
the motion to continue the trial is heard.

To Market Participants and Scheduling Coordinators:

The CA ISO believes it has complied with its obligations under CA ISO Tariff
section 20.3.4 as to the December 4 EOB subpoena and the September 21 CPUC
subpoena.  Our reasoning is explained in the attached letter.  Accordingly,
the CA ISO will comply with the EOB and  CPUC subpoenas on December 20
unless it receives and order to the contrary from a court or the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission.

In addition, the CA ISO has received requests from the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission and the state agencies for information on generator
unit outages.  This information is not subject to tariff section 20.3.4
which protects only Generator Outage programs.  Nonetheless, the CA ISO is
providing this notice as a curtesy matter.  The CA ISO will provide the
requested information to FERC and the state agencies.  The CA ISO has in the
past requested confidential treatment for information on the cause of an
outage and projected in service date since this information could be used by
Market Participants to manipulate the market, and it will make such a
request as to cause and in service dates in the context of the current
requests.

Enclosed is my proposed response (which I intend to fax to Mr. Drivon 
tomorrow) to the May 30, 2001 letter from Senator Dunn's Committee regarding 
document retention.  As indicated, the letter does not say anything of 
substance, but we have at least acknowledged receipt of the letter.  My not 
getting a copy directly from the Senate Committee is a legitimate excuse to 
extend the time to respond (recognizing that the May 30 letter did not set a 
deadline for a response).  I will have a proposed response sent via e-mail on 
Friday and we can discuss it in Houston next week.  Given our strategy of 
proceeding with all deliberate speed, I do not want to respond any sooner 
than necessary to anything from the Senate Committee, particularly when we 
know that the subpoenas are going to be issued this week or next and will 
apparently call for a 15-day response time.  If you have a different strategy 
in mind, give me a call or e-mail a response.  MLK

Wayne,

Here is a brief  privileged and confidential (not to be handed to the other 
side) description of the above-referenced matter from our attorney, Andrew 
Bicknell of Clyde & Co. in London.  Andrew is available for further 
consultation with you on Wednesday if you so desire.  His direct telephone # 
is 9-011-44-207-648-1833 (that's calling from the US, of course).  Andrew's 
e-mail address is "andrew.bicknell@clyde.co.uk"

I appreciate any help you can give us at your negotiations on Wednesday with 
Exmar.  The best of all possible worlds is if both EGLI and Exmar could agree 
to withdraw/dismiss their claims against each other and walk away from this 
case before year end.  If you wouldn't mind, I would appreciate a short 
e-mail from you regarding Exmar's response during your meeting with them.

Many thanks for your help.

Britt

I would summarise the main facts/status of this matter as follows:

(1)  Enron voyage chartered "SANTA CLARA" from Exmar N.V. by a C/P dated 
5.2.91
to carry cargo of 4,200 mt 5% more or less at owner's option of propane, from
Houston to Dunkirk.  Under the Charterparty Enron had the option to load cargo
either fully refrigerated or ambient or chilled.

(2)  On 26th February 1991 the Master advised Enron that the maximum quantity
that the cargo could load at ambient temperature was 3,760 mt having regard to
the vessel's pressure settings and the USCG and IMO Rules and Regulations. The
Master was in fact absolutely correct but Exmar tried to make out that the
vessel could load the full charterparty quantity.

(3)  It is our case that in order to load more than 3,760 mt (the cargo was
loaded at ambient temperature) Exmar refrigerated the cargo as it came on 
board
to reduce the volume.  This caused the loading to be excessively slow.  We say
this method of loading was actually illegal.  It was only by loading illegally
in this way that Exmar could load more than 3760 mt at the required pressure
setting.  We also say it was an express term of the charterparty that the 
entire
contractual cargo could be loaded within the contractual lay time.   The 
vessel
also had to raise the temperature and discharge causing further delays.

(4) There was great commerical pressure on Enron at the time.  The market for
propane was falling rapidly in March 1991 (the end of the Northern European
winter) and Enron had arranged the on sale of a minimum quantity of 3,990 mt 
on
CIF terms based on an expected loading of 1st-7th March 1991.  Enron were
extremely concerned that this would lead purchasers Vitol  to repudiate the 
sale
contract leading to a very substantial trading loss (Vitol did try to 
repudiate
the sale contract due to the loading delays and this developed into a very 
major
trading dispute with Vitol which we eventually won in the House of Lords).

(5)  Exmar made out that slow loading was due to low back pressure in his
Enterprise loading lines.  We believe this is wrong but at this distance in 
time
it is difficult to get clear evidence.

(6)  In the circumstances, on 7th March 1991to try and speed up loading Enron
agreed that the minimum cargo of 3,760 mt should be loaded and agreed to pay
Exmar deadfreight on the balance in the sum of US$22,714.84.

(7)  Furthermore, because of the slow loading of the vessel the Enterprise
Terminal had to throw "SANTA CLARA" off berth.  This would have caused a very
substantial delay and might have justified Vitol in throwing  over the sales
contract.  In the circumstances Enron negotiated an agreement with another
vessel ("DONAU") to permit "SANTA CLARA" to be loaded ahead of "DONAU".  The 
sum
paid to "DONAU" amounted to US$153,472.15.    We believe the "DONAU" was also
operated by Exmar.

(8) Accordingly, Enron deny liability for demurrage for the extended loading
which Exmar have claimed in the sum of US$165,652.78 and Enron have
counterclaimed a total of US$176,186.99 (i.e. the deadfreight and "DONAU"
payments).

Exmar are represented by London Solicitors, Lawrence Graham where the matter 
is
being handled by Mike Lax and his assistant Stuart Dench.

Lawrence Graham have always sought to charactercise this claim as a
straightforward demurrage dispute and suggest that we have invented the
technical arguments after the event.  However, we consider there is merit in 
our
case and that if the arbitrators properly understand the expert evidence we 
have
reasonable prospects of successfully defending the demurrage claim and
establishing the counterclaim.  There is of course however an inevitable
litigation risk in pursuing the matter to an arbitration and we have, to some
extent, been inconvenienced by the loss of our original expert, Mr Ivor 
Jorstad,
who sadly passed away earlier this year.   Also some costs will be 
irrecoverable
(if we win approximately two thirds of our costs should be recoverable).

If you have any further queries, please do not hesitate to ring me and I would
of course be pleased to speak to Wayne Perry when he is in London if he needs
any further information to assist in negotiations.

Best Regards.


Andrew Bicknell

I think it would be very beneficial to pay McGrath to be present,  mainly to 
keep Hellmold honest.

>>> <showard@agsk.com> 06/06/01 08:16PM >>>
Bruce MacLeod at Hennigan's firm has informed me that plaintiffs will NOT file
a summary judgment motion against ECT Securities.

Also, next week Ralph Hellmold will be deposed on 6/13 and 6/14, but we will
not be expected to produce McGrath until July.

Question:  Do we want to pay McGrath to attend Hellmold's deposition on 6/13
and 6/14 to help me out (and maybe keep Hellmold a little more honest by his
presence in the room)?

Here is my status report on today's activities:

Attorney General Investigation

 Mike Day, Enron's outside counsel that does work before the PUC
called me late tonight to tell me that he was contacted by another attorney
that has done work for Enron in the past.  This other attorney received a
call from the California State Attorney General's office, Richard Rothman
(phonetic) stating that the AG was going to be sending out preservation of
documents letters to market participants including Enron and that they were
going to be issuing subpoenas in the very near future.

California Energy Oversight Board

 Some recipients of this email may not have been included on the list
that got copies of the subpoena requests to the California ISO and
California PX so I will duplicate them here.

Change of Venue Research by Peter Meringolo

 Here's preliminary analysis of change of venue:

 The court may change the venue of a trial "where there is reason to
believe that an impartial trial cannot be had therein."  C.C.P. o 397(b).
The party requesting a change of venue must show actual "widespread"
prejudice "extending over a long period of time."  Nguyen v. Superior Court,
49 Cal. App. 4th 1781, 1791 (1996).  Whether such a showing has been made is
left to the discretion of the trial court.  Id.

 Case law provides little guidance regarding how much evidence is
enough for a party to show actual prejudice.  As Witkin states, this
"challenge is so vague and difficult to sustain."  3 Witkin, Cal. Procedure,
Actions, o 871 (4th ed. 1996).  In fact, a change of venue on these grounds
has been granted in very few reported cases, the most recent of which was in
1938.  See People v. Ocean Shore R.R., 24 Cal. App. 2d 420 (1938); San
Joaquin and Kings River Canal and Irrigation Co. v. Stevinson, 179 Cal. 533
(1919).

 Ocean Shore was an eminent domain proceeding against 32 defendant
land owners to acquire lands to build a state highway, one defendant's
motion for change of venue was granted.  People v. Ocean Shore R.R., 24 Cal.
App. 2d 420 (1938).  The defendant filed nearly 200 affidavits, which
referenced newspaper articles, reports from civic meetings, and statements
by citizens showing a widespread prejudice against the defendants and its
cause extending over a long period of years.  Id. at 427-28.  The Court
affirmed the trial court's discretion, noting that the affidavits show that
"it would at least make it extremely doubtful whether an impartial trial
could be had before a jury in that county."  Id. at 428.

 San Joaquin was a condemnation action for the use of waters of a
river for the benefit of landowners on the west side of the river.  San
Joaquin and Kings River Canal and Irrigation Co. v. Stevinson, 179 Cal. 533
(1919).  In that action, the defendant operated an irrigation system for the
benefit of the landowners on the east side of the river.  Plaintiff filed
one affidavit showing that the people on the east side of the river felt
widespread prejudice against plaintiff and people on the west side of the
river were disqualified as jurors because they were using defendant's
irrigation system.  Id. at 537-38.  Defendant filed 22 affidavits in
opposition.  According to the Court, "if numbers of affiants or of
affidavits were the determining factor in questions of this character the
defendant herein would have been entitled to prevail upon said motion; but .
. . this is not the rule."  Id. at 538.  Rather, the question is whether the
trial court abused its discretion, and the Court held that it did not.

 These cases are contrasted with two case reported since 1938 in
which change of venue motions were denied.  See Riverside County Flood
Control and Water Conservation Dist. v. Joseph W. Wolfskill Co., 147 Cal.
App. 2d 714 (1957); Nguyen v. Superior Court, 49 Cal. App. 4th 1781, 1791
(1996).

 Riverside County was an eminent domain proceeding, where plaintiff
was seeking to condemn property for the purposes of flood control.
Defendants moved for a change of venue by presenting evidence that the
advantages of the flood control project was widely publicized, the
newspapers portrayed defendants as trying to prevent flood controls, that
the cost of purchasing defendant's property was to come from county funds
and therefore every taxpayer was adverse to defendant.  147 Cal. App. 2d at
716.  Plaintiff's affidavit contradicted these facts.  The trial court
denied the motion, and this decision was affirmed on appeal.  Id. at 717.

 In Nguyen, the State brought a suit against business owners in order
to shut down a red light district in San Mateo.  The defendant businesses
moved for a change of venue.  Defendants' evidence consisted of two
newspaper articles reporting the raid on the businesses, that the city spent
over $5000 investigating, and one affidavit of an employee of defendants'
lawyer.  The trial court denied the motion because the evidence fell "far
short of proving actual prejudice."  49 Cal. App. 4th at 1791.  Moreover,
the trial was to be a court trial, not a jury trial, and defendants showed
no prejudice by the court.  Id.

 Ross v. Kalin, 53 Cal. App. 616 (1921), although an extreme case,
exemplifies that a change of venue motion most likely requires a high
standard of proof.  In Ross, plaintiff's motion for change of venue was
denied.  Plaintiff filed numerous affidavits, in which uncontroverted facts
showed that, as a result of plaintiff's "crusade against vice conditions' in
the City of venue, plaintiff was assaulted by a mob, beaten, tarred and
feathered, and chained to a tree.  Id. at 617.  The local newspaper
published editorials approving the mob action.  Id.  Plaintiff's attorney
was also assaulted and beaten, and banned from two organizations.  Id.  Of
the 8000 to 12000 potential jurors, between 30 and 300 were prejudiced
against the plaintiff at some point in time.  Id. at 619.  The appellate
court affirmed, holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in
finding that this prejudice against the plaintiffs did not outweigh the
defendants' right to have their case tried in the county where they reside
and their witnesses reside.  Id.

Summary of Business & Professions Code 17200 Cases
I sent a two volume set to each of you with a summary of the California
17200 cases.  (Dave and Mike, I know this may be superfluous for you but I
thought you should see what I sent to everybody.)  While the cases do not
break out cleanly, I tried to divide the cases  into those that defined
unfair, preemption, the filed rate doctrine, conspiracy and damages.

Sampling of Tapes
I spoke with Steve Hall today (Stoel Rives).  He has listened to
approximately 2 hours of tapes.  He said they are best described as using
colorful language.  There is some chit chat about what the participants
guess the price might be or what they heard the price might be and some
discussion about a line that may have gone down.

Projects Underway

Data Resolution - No progress today
Fact Memo - I received Steve Hall's memorandum and will incorporate with the
materials I have for distribution tomorrow.
Contracts - We hope to have that package sent out tomorrow.
PUC- No contact from Harvey Morris (PUC in house counsel.)

Thanks
Gary

Photo Sessions for Next Pictorial Roster Set for June 19-20, August 14-15

 The Houston Bar Association has contracted with a new publisher for
the 2002 edition of the HBA Pictorial Roster, and photography sessions have
been scheduled for members who would like to have a new picture taken for
the Roster -- free of charge.
 Any member who would like to have his or her photo taken may come by
the Houston Bar Association office between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 5:00
p.m. on June 19 or June 20. Another session will be scheduled August 14 and
August 15. There is no charge for the photo, no appointment is necessary,
and the photo sessions will take only a few minutes. The Houston Bar
Association office is located downtown at 1001 Fannin, Suite 1300.
 Members may also submit their own photo for the Roster, or use an
existing photo already on file with the HBA.

You will have received notice of service of process in the above-referenced 
case today.  This is a slip and fall case filed against San Juan Gas.  The 
Risk Management group already has a file on this matter, as the plaintiff had 
previously filed a demand.  Upon investigation, Risk Management determined 
that the plaintiff's alleged accident occurred at a facility that is NOT 
owned by San Juan Gas, and, thus, denied the claim.  The matter will be 
handled as a Risk Management matter, and Dave Grant will manage the 
activities of outside counsel.  If you need any further information on this 
matter, please contact Dave.

Rich,
 I just received a phone call from the IT department at EPMI.  They
have two computers which require immediate maintenance.  The first is a
desktop of an individual who sits at the front desk.  Her work station is
inoperable and part of the fix may be to format the hard drive.  Second,
there is a laptop for someone who is not a trader, which will not boot.  In
order to repair that machine, they may have to format the hard drive as
well.  At the present time, there is no easy way to copy the contents of the
hard drive before those machines are repaired, because they are inoperable.

 Based on our prior discussions, it is my understanding that for
operational needs such as these, EPMI is free to repair these machines
notwithstanding the request for preservation of data.

 If for any reason you have a different understanding, please let me
know immediately.

Sincerely,
Gary Fergus

circulated.

Subject: Pacific Virgo - Eric Tan's Statement

Matt,

Thanks for the heads-up; if you told me in the past that Eric was leaving, I 
had forgotten.  Eric is obviously a key witness in this case for us; I very 
much hope that he can be available to help us after he leaves and that he is 
indeed leaving in good graces.   Based on my recollection of my review of his 
statement, I don't have any problem if he has already signed it.  

If he hasn't signed it already, I would ask Eric to hold off a few more days 
and let David and Neale immediately consider whether the statement needs to 
be amended in any respect, so that this can be done before he signs it.  My 
feeling is that it is much better not to have more than one version of a 
signed witness statement.  I would also like to have David's thoughts on 
whether, under the circumstances, we should go forward with some sort of 
consulting agreement with Eric.  I am inclined to do it, if the business 
clients can shake loose the money, but do not want to if an English 
arbitrator would think that such an agreement does not pass the smell test.

As you know, Eric is scheduled to leave Enron at the end of the year. He will 
be clearing the remainder of his leave shortly. I have asked Chismar on 
several occasions whether an arrangement can be made to keep Eric as some 
sort of consultant, seeing that he would be a key witness if the matter goes 
to arbitration.  Chismar said he would discuss with Nowlan but has yet to 
reverted to me.

Although I believe Eric is leaving with good graces, seeing that there is 
some uncertainty about his availability as a witness, I have yesterday asked 
Eric to sign his statement. I also think it is advantageous for Eric to sign 
the statement whilst still an employee. I have reveiwed the statement and am 
comfortable with it. If there are to be subsequent changes, we can ask Eric 
to sign another.

I will circulate the signed statement to the team for reference.

Regards
Matt

The proof of claim filing date is January 8, 2001.  I can have a junior
level staff person prepare ENA's proof of claim.  To do that, we will need
copies of any contracts, agreements upon which ENA's claim is based and
copies of any outstanding invoices that make up the prepetition claim.
Those documents should be attached to the proof of claim.  I will review
the claim and get it over to you for signing.

Perry Gas listed ENA's claim as $1,848,197.  The amount should be
confirmed.  I assume that the claim is against  Perry Gas Companies, Inc.,
as opposed to the other two debtor subsidiaries, but that should be
confirmed as well.

Let me know how you want to proceed on this.  FYI, Christy Finelli (a
paralegal) at Enron has been very helpful in connection with  EES and she
may be able to gather everything for you.

If you'd like me to work directly with someone else in connection with
ENA's proof of claim, let me know.  Thanks.

What is the status of Kevin McConville? 

I? learned today from one of the other plaintiff's lawyers that Hennegan 
wants to take Kevin's deposition before the end of discovery, so this may 
come to a head soon.

The purpose of this message is to update employees on the
status of the California Attorney General's order regarding the
preservation
of business information.  Please NOTE THE IMPORTANT POLICIES DESCRIBED
BELOW.

We have negotiated procedures with the
California Attorney General's office allowing each of you to manage your
email and hard drive capacity while still preserving business information.


Starting today, please implement the
following business information retention policies:

(1) PERSONAL EMAIL: can be kept, discarded,
etc. at will.

(2) BUSINESS EMAIL: do not delete any
business email sent or received for 24 hours.  This 24 hour delay will
allow
the network to save a backup copy of the email.  After 24 hours, BUSINESS
EMAIL may be kept, discarded, etc. at will.

(3) WORD PROCESSING FILES OR FILE FRAGMENTS:
do not delete any SAVED FILE or any FILE FRAGMENT.  This policy covers any
FILE or FILE FRAGMENT that you have saved on your hard disk or the network.

(4) DATABASES: do not delete any information
in DATABASES.

(5) EXCEL SPREADSHEETS: do not delete any
information in EXCEL SPREADSHEETS.

(6) CALENDARS OR SCHEDULING PROGRAMS: do not
delete any information.

(7) OTHER ELECTRONIC DATA: do not delete any
OTHER ELECTRONIC DATA.

(8) HARD DRIVE CAPACITY: in the event that
you run out of disk space on your personal computer, you may copy files to
the network (where they will be backed up), then delete the files from your
personal computer to create the work space you need.  DO NOT DELETE ANY
FILE
BEFORE YOU HAVE COPIED IT TO THE NETWORK.


In our negotiations we have discovered no
reason to believe that Enron has been singled out for investigation by the
Attorney General.  We will update you as we learn more.

Please respond promptly to this notice via
email an e-mail to me.  Your email should state that you understand and
intend to comply
with the important business information retention policies stated above.

Thanks for your help in this matter.

Subject: FERC request for gas prices

Bill Howard from FERC just called me.  The Chairman of FERC is asking for the 
following information by the end of the day today:

How much gas did we buy today by basin either: as of the beginning of the day 
or as of midnight?
How much of the gas went into California?
What was the average price or the high and low price?

I asked him to if FERC wa asking other market participants.  He said more and 
more every day and they would continue this until prices started going down.  
I asked him if the Commission intended to keep this information 
confidential.  He said he didn't know.  Christi - could you work with Phillip 
on this?  Bill's number is (202) 208-1268.

Looks like 2/3 of the way down on pg. 2 he clearly says we have a deal 
pending the LC, a requirement which we later waved.

Sara, here's the transcript of a conversation with Bob whereby I mistakenly 
inform him that he needs to post a $240k LC and he doesn't object.  Please 
comment on how useful this will be to our efforts to enforce the deal.  Also, 
as mentioned previously, I called Bob a week ago, left him a message and 
haven't heard any response.  Should I try again?????  What are our next 
steps?   (I'm pulling more tapes to try to find the conversation or message 
in which I tell Bob that he's actually got $250k of credit).



Thanks,
Alan

I just received a fifty page "expert" report about PaineWebber and ECT
Securities over Ralph Hellmold's signature.  The report is totally
argumentative and was obviously written by lawyers and not by Hellmold.

This is an unfortunate development for one reason.  When we make Farallon a
settlement offer in a day or so, they may well believe that it came in
reaction to this report.  I will try to disabuse them of that, but I may or
may not be successful.

I'll fax you the report.

Britt,

We have received the fedex package you sent yesterday, carrying copies of 
bills of ladings.  I have checked each of those bills
of ladings, and they do belong to MG, and we have been billed for these loads 
by ICTS and have paid ICTS in full.

		 Subject: In re ICTS/Alabama Carriers v. Scottsboro and ICTS

 I have today spoken with Dean Vanek, Scottsboro's general counsel, and 
advised him that subject to confirmation that all the loads on which Alabama 
Carriers is suing are our loads, Enron Metals intends to indemnify and defend 
Scottsboro.  I told him that our plan is to retain his usual attorneys to ask 
for an extension of time within which Scottsboro should answer, so as to see 
whether ICTS will do the right thing and pay off.  If they won't, I told 
Vanek our plan to was to have his attorneys negotiate the best possible 
settlement.

 Vanek told me that Scottsboro had sent all available information to our 
Montreal office and that we should check there to confirm that all these 
loads were ours.  Michelin has kindly agreed to handle this task, and will 
try to get back to me tomorrow morning.  I left a message to this effect with 
Vanek.

 Once this has been done, I will be sending a letter to Scottsboro regarding 
defense and indemnification.

NEW SEMINARS FOR THIS MONTH...

The following are brief descriptions of our new seminars for this month.
Full details on each are available on our Web site:

--> Legal Writing: Meet the New Citation Manual

We are pleased to introduce a new seminar this month from Professor Wayne
Schiess of the University of Texas School of Law on a cutting edge issue
facing lawyers in citations in legal writings.  This seminar is designed
to review criticisms of the most widely used citation manual-- The
Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation -- and to introduce attorneys to
the latest and most viable alternative to the Bluebook-- the ALWD
Citation Manual.  This seminar is accredited for 1.0 hour of CLE.

--> Selected Issues in Ethics for California Lawyers [2.0 ETHICS]

We are also pleased to present a new ethics seminar from another one of
our most popular authors and instructors on our site.  David Hricik has

California lawyers that will explore a variety of new ethical issues and
challenges facing California practitioners.  This seminar is accredited
for 2.0 credit hours, all in the area of legal ethics.

The case on which judge Whaley is starting trial this month is being tried
by my partner, John Allcock.  It is  a patent infringement case in which we
represent the plaintiff, Hewlett Packard pursuing patent infringement claims
against a company named Mustek for infringing the scanner patents owned by
HP.  It is a factually and legally complex case with fairly high stakes.

Judge Whaley demands preparation and diligence of the lawyers but is
reasonable and easy to get along with.  He is described as hard working and
thorough.  He is apparently not experienced in patent cases but has taken
the time to learn what he needs to learn to get it right.  One notable
result: he granted summary judgement against our client on a very factually
complex record and then granted a motion to reconsider and reversed himself.
His orders are well reasoned and reflect great care and attention.

He works very hard; his trial week is Monday through Friday 8-5.  Below are
some emails we received from lawyers familiar with Judge Whaley which we
gathered in preparation for the HP case.  I will, of course, keep you
informed as the trial proceeds.  It sounds like there are some pluses and
minus' but overall we could have done worse.


here are the series of messages we had on Judge Whaley

Subject: RE: Judge Whaley, E.D.Wash.


Maria:

I heard a lot more about Judge Whaley.  Overall he has a very good
reputation.  Professional, courteous, and well-prepared.  Was an
accomplished trial lawyer and head of WSTLA (trial lawyers' assn.)
before
going on the bench.  Probably liberal; considered to be
plaintiff-oriented
(in P.I. or employment cases, at least), but fair.

One lawyer in our office had an employment case before him, where the
plaintiffs' attorney was literally incompetent.  She said it was obvious
that Whaley was doing independent research on his own (w/out a clerk) to
cover for the guy, and she was impressed by that.  He eventually called
the
attorney's law partners into court and had him removed from the case.

People say he doesn't grant summary judgment easily.  That is mainly
based
on experience defending employment actions, but at least one attorney
thought it would probably carry over to other cases (i.e., a judge who
believes that juries should decide facts).

Another lawyer described him as technically very sound (rulings on
evidence
etc.) but not intellectually brilliant.

Everyone I heard from felt that he is a very good judge, and said they
would
be happy to have him for just about any case.

Maria,

Here are a few comments re Judge Whaley.  I understand that one of our
attorneys, Alex Higgins, recently tried a case before him and might be
the
best resource.  He's out this morning but I'll let you know what he
says.

**************

From: Denise Ashbaugh
....
I've had two cases in front of him.  Very reluctant to get overturned -
so
tentative to make any "borderline" decisions.  I have won and lost a
summary
judgment motion in front of him - both employment law cases.

-----Original Message-----
From: Lisa Herb
....
He is very fair - but also can be very firm about doing things by the
book.
He pushes attorneys very hard to keep to trial schedules.  He can lose
his
temper - but in a calm way.  He seemed smart, well informed and he paid
attention.  I liked him a lot as a judge.  But make sure you are well
prepared.

Richard,

It looks like the London office has been able to set up a way their traders 
can record trades, via their cellular phones.  Can you tell us if this is 
putting Enron at legal risk?

Could you check with the telephonic IT group there and see if they can do 
something similar so that even the traders trading off of their cell phones 
can go to a recorded line?  Trade capture via cell phones has been a 
consistent audit point.    Let me know if I can assist.  Thanks Cindy

Cindy,

It's not feasible at all in the other offices as they don't utilise the same 
type of recording systems (London has the ability to record every single 
conversation in or out of the building).

I am drafting a note to go out in the next Euroflash to launch the service

Thanks

Andy

Have you found anything out on this for the Houston and Singapore offices 
yet?  How would the Sydney office handle this?   Thanks for doing this for 
London.  Did the email go out telling traders how to do this?   Thanks Cindy

This is great news!!!  Can you handle sending this announcement as I assume 
this was an audit issue for the other trading groups as well!!

Also,  how can we get this same process in place for the Houston and 
Singapore offices??  They have the same issues on their audits.  Thanks you 
guys did a great job!!!!   Cindy

Subject: Recording Trades from made on Mobile phones  

Cindy,

We have some good news for you.  We have set up a number which can only be 
called from Enron Mobile phones (37373), when you dial this number you will 
hear dialtone.  The dialtone is coming from the phone system at Enron House, 
you are then able to dial exactly as if you were at your desk, ie dial '9' 
and the number you wish to reach.

All calls coming through this route will be recorded and can be retrieved by 
the telecoms team for playback / reference.

We have also ensured that external people cannot dial this number from 
outside the building by using 020 7783 7373.

Let me know if you want to issue a note as a General Announcement or whether 
you wish to handle the distribution of the number.

Regards,

Andy

Subject: Re: Who should I talk to on this one?  

Instead of providing a phone number could there be a short code or something 
that they do that in the background dials this number so no one gets access 
to this number?   I know that this is an issue in all of the offices with 
traders making deals on cell phones on unrecorded lines.  I do not want to do 
something that puts Enron at risk though.  Thanks Cindy

Subject: Re: Who should I talk to on this one?

Cindy,

We can provide a telephone number in the office which the traders can call 
from their mobile phone, they would then be offered dialtone from the 
telephone system and can then dial on to an external party.

The call would then be routed out from the office and would be subject the 
the normal recording criteria.

However I wouldn't recommend this approach as we are opening up an external 
gateway for people to use our telephone system, this would be unmetered and 
not secure. The potential for toll-fraud is something that we need to take 
into account.

Regards,

Andy Cowx

If the traders do a deal from their cell phone, is there a way they can have 
that call routed back through the phones in the building so it gets done on a 
recorded line?  I know if you call someone and then dial some numbers it 
takes you to their cell phone.  Can it work backwards so they hit some 
numbers and it routes the call through the office?   This would help with 
some of our AA issues.  Thanks Cindy

Pls take the lead in coordinating our response to these requests.

It is critical that legal litigation counsel (Richard Sanders and Bob

Colleagues:

Attached hereto is Norma Formanek's transcribed voicemail message confirming
that ISO will not produce documents to plaintiffs until after a protective
order has been entered in whichever court this case winds up.  As discussed,
I propose to send the following confirming letter:

"Thank you for your voicemail confirming that ISO is continuing to abide by
our agreement that there will be no production of documents to plaintiffs'
counsel until after plaintiffs' remand motion has been heard and we know
which court will be entering the protective order that will preserve the
confidentiality of documents that are produced.  Defense counsel are
reviewing the proposed protective order and will provide comments in the
near future."

Please let me know if you have any suggestions or changes.

Thanks.

		 Subject: FERC Order

The following is an excerpt from a FERC order issued on Friday:
 
"Ridgewood Power LLC (Ridgewood) filed comments suggesting that the shortage 
of supply could be remedied in part by relaxing the operating efficiency and 
other regulatory requirements pertaining to Qualifying Facilities (QFs).  
Ridgewood states that the total power production capacity of QFs in 
California is approximately 9,000 MWs, of which, between 4,000 and 5,500 MW 
are from qualifying cogeneration facilities (Cogeneration QFs) and the 
remainder from small power production facilities (Small Power QFs).  
Ridgewood states that the Cogeneration segment of the industry is 
underutilized because of operating efficiency and other QF requirements.   
With a limited waiver or other equivalent relief, Ridgewood states that these 
underutilized resources could help relieve current shortages during both peak 
and off-peak periods.  Ridgewood estimates that as much as 1,000 MWs would be 
immediately available by allowing QFs to sell to the purchasing utility or 
into the competitive market their "above-baseline" output for a limited time 
period.   Ridgewood suggests that any such sale would be made at market-based 
rates and would not be subject to the operating and efficiency 
standards......... Section 292.205(c) of the Commission's regulations 
provides that the Commission may waive any of its operating and efficiency 
standards "upon a showing that the facility will produce significant energy 
savings".   However, the Commission has exercised its waiver authority in a 
number of cases based on factors such as the limited durations of the 
requested waiver, whether further waivers would be necessary, whether the 
request was intended to remedy specific problems associated with an 
innovative technology, and whether granting waiver would fulfill PURPA's 
goals.   We find that many of these same factors are present here.  
Consistent with the goals of PURPA, we find that granting such waiver in this 
circumstance will provide for increased efficiency in the use of the 
Cogeneration facilities and improved reliability of electric service through 
increasing the availability of needed capacity.  Therefore, we will grant 
temporary waiver of the operating and efficiency standards to Cogeneration 
QFs for sales into California, effective as of the date of this order.  We 
will terminate the waiver effective January 1, 2001."
 
Let me know if you want the entire order.
 
Dan

Randy / Richard:

Here is the text of the letter I forwarded in WordPerfect yesterday.  Since 
Randy couldn't open it, I assume Richard could not either.

- Doug


Dear Tom:

Thank you for your letter of December 6, 2000.  As previously indicated, we 
are very willing to work with you to schedule our mutual discovery efforts 
efficiently and with a minimum of disruption to everyone's schedules.  
Unfortunately, we are unable to conduct a deposition during either of the 
weeks you propose.  I would suggest that we attempt to schedule the 
deposition you seek after the holidays.  I have a two or three-day trial 
setting on the two-week docket beginning January 8, 2001.  However, I will be 
happy to schedule a deposition around that conflict.

With respect to the lengthy "Outline of Documents Requested and Relevant 
Witnesses," please let me know whether you intend that list as a formal 
request for production under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 196.  Of course, 
we reserve our rights under the applicable discovery rules to raise any and 
all appropriate objections to the documents requested and to the topics 
listed on your "preliminary witness list."

I have also received a copy of your e-mail to Steve Hamilton dated December 
6, 2000, at 12:46 a.m., rejecting Ecogas's offer of settlement.  As the 
majority of the comments in your e-mail are not relevant to the claims in 
your lawsuit, I will not respond to the statements made there except to say 
that Ecogas does not agree with those statements or your characterization of 
the facts.

I previously had indicated no objection to your communicating with Steve 
Hamilton directly, as we felt it would facilitate settlement efforts.  In 
light of your rejection of Ecogas's offer, I would ask that you direct all 
future communications on this matter to me rather than to my client.

    Very truly yours,

                   Bracewell & Patterson, L.L.P.

    Douglas A. Daniels

After tennis yesterday with Dave Kleiman counsel to the creditor's committee 
our conversation turned to Heartland Steel.  You will recall that the 
committee  had launched a series of 2004 exams concerning activities of the 
company board.  It appears that the committee is looking at potential actions 
against the board arising out of decisions to create short term operating 
capital by stretching unsecured creditors.  David, intimated to me that they 
had discovered certain minutes of the board which discuss these issues 
specifically.

>
> 1. In Portland, we proposed to handle business email related to the

> any email sent or received for 24 hours.  Email that is personal and does
> not relate to the business topics you have identified can be kept,
> discarded etc. at the employee's pleasure.  Each day there is a backup
> made that will capture the email in those employees mailboxes.  After 24
> hours, each employee is free to manage their email box as they deem
> appropriate to the business needs (e.g. keep, discard).  From our
> conversation, I understand that you agree that this is an acceptable
> procedure.
>
> 2. With respect to the hard drives on individual computers, you would
> like to get an organizational chart for Portland that would enable us to
> discuss 6-12 individual's computers that would be copied using ProQuest
> Drive Image Pro 4.0.  In addition, there may be some other individuals
> that you would like to have us use a software product called Robocopy to
> copy files from their hard drives onto the network.  Until we figure out
> which computers to copy etc. we will not begin this process.  We discussed
> that because of the holiday period, it may not be practical to get this
> started until after the new year.
>
> 3. Outside of Portland, we have proposed making a snapshot backup along
> business function lines reasonably called for by the subject matter of
> your request.  We propose not to backup any other business units or
> functions.  On a going forward basis, those business functions that
> related to the subject matter of your request would be instructed not to
> delete business email.
>
> 4. We believe that relevant database  backups have been and will
> continue to be made and preserved.
>
> 5. When an employee runs out of hard disk space on their computer, it
> is an acceptable practice to copy files form their hard disk to the
> network (where they will be backed up) and then delete those copied files
> to make sufficient work space for the employee to work.
>
> 6. For EES, I explained that their IT services are outsourced so we do
> not have as detailed information immediately available.
>
> As I mentioned on the phone, all of these discussions and efforts being
> made are done without waiving any objections that any of the Enron
> entities may have to your request including scope, burden, jurisdiction,
> relevance, privilege, privacy, vagueness etc. and Enron specifically
> reserves each and every right and objection it or its employees may have.
>
> Please let me know if your general understanding of our conversation is
> different than the above.

Before we discuss our Committee's position on the PG&E document production
motion on Friday, can you discuss with Joe Eisenberg and find out what
CalPX's position will be.  I was discussing the motion with PG&E's counsel
(Marty Courson) yesterday, mostly on timing issues (his schedule for
requiring  meet & confer this week, objections end of next week, and
production in five days, etc. is unrealistic), and he was complaining
bitterly that CalPX is "stonewalling", telling him it would one year and
millions of dollars to produce documents.  We need to be careful when we
formulate our position that we don't support (or look like we're supporting)
unreasonable positions by CalPX, who, I'm sure, doesn't want to allow access
to its records by anybody, anytime; at the same time, the Committee has an
interest in not draining the resources of CalPX (i.e., our money) on
overbroad and unreasonable document requests and fishing expeditions.

Hi Angeline --

I received your fax this date regarding the WFW pacific virgo invoice.  What 
I am looking for is  a copy of the back-up to the statement you sent.  In 
other words, I need a breakdown of the time billed by each attorney working 
on this matter.   All I have is the one page listing $137,455.18 -- what does 
this consist of?  Please forward this to me so I can arrange for payment of 
this invoice.  Thanks.

Subject: Dec. 7 - SDG&E Press Release


CRECers,

Note attached SDG&E press release calling on Governor Davis to use his
emergency powers to remedy the accelerating energy crisis by taking a
number of actions, e.g., directing local air districts to temporarily lift
emissions limits for in-state power plants so that the plants which have
met or exceeded their air-emissions limits can run.  In addition, SDG&E
reported it made an emergency filing with FERC requesting an immediate
reinstatement of price caps on interstate natural gas pipeline
transportation to the CA border.

As I mentioned on the phone, SCE moved FERC (in the FERC docket investigati=
ng=20
the California market) for a subpoena to produce information from the ISO's=
=20
Market Surveillance Committee.  In particular, SCE is requesting informatio=
n=20
that the MSC referenced in its December 4, 2000 report to the FERC, wherein=
=20
it stated that "MSC stands ready to provide the Commission with what we=20
suspect are instances of the exercise of significant market power by specif=
ic=20
market participants.  We encourage not only the Commission, but other law=
=20
enforcement agencies as well, to use their authority to request from these=
=20
market participants the necessary information to confirm whether these=20
suspicions about the exercise of significant market power are in fact=20
correct."  The MSC also stated that it "could provide a number of instances=
=20
of what it suspects are suspicious bidding and scheduling behavior during t=
he=20
summer and Autumn of 2000."

Here's an outline of the positions I think we should make in an answer:

The Commission should reject SoCal Edison's request for a subpoena because=
=20
FERC did not set its investigation for hearing.  Therefore, SCE's request i=
s=20
a collateral attack on the Commission's order establishing the process for=
=20
its investigation in this case.  Further, it would allow Edison to access=
=20
this information to pursue its case against power marketers while denying=
=20
marketers an opportunity to prosecute their cases by denying them an equal=
=20
opportunity to serve discovery upon others (including the UDCs).
In the alternative, the Commission should allow all parties full discovery=
=20
rights and establish an appropriate protective order.
There may also be an argument that, since the MSC has delegated its authori=
ty=20
by FERC, some of the information Edison requested might fall under the=20
deliberative process privilege.  Gary Fergus suggested this argument.  Not=
=20
having done any legal research, I don't know how good of an argument it is.

Are there any other arguments we should make?  Should we have a conference=
=20
call on this?  Jim suggested that we should try to have WPTF file this answ=
er=20
and I agreed.  At first, I was thinking that it would be okay for Ron to=20
draft the answer for WPTF.  However, on further consideration, if we end up=
=20
wanting to argue that another member of WPTF exercised market power,=20
Bracewell would have a conflict of interest that would prohibit it from=20
representing us.  Accordingly, WPTF should use other counsel.

Ana Paula, thanks for keeping after me on this.

We have decided to rely on Ms. Cunha as the company representative to be 
present in court. This will avoid the need for an official, court appointed 
tramslator. She will be supported by Randy Pais, Nate Neuman or others as 
needed either from Houston or traveling to Brazil as needed. The SCC expat 
presence in Brazil will be greatly diminished in the next several weeks. 

Please copy Ms. Cunha  Mr. Randy Pais and Mr. Richard Sanders on all 
correspondence related to this matter. Randy Pais is the internal 
transactional lawyer at EEOS/SCC working the Cuiaba project; Richard Sanders 
is the internal litigation management lawyer at Enron Wholesale who supports 
our business unit.

I want to make sure I understand what is meant by the power of attorney and 
company representative letter. Are these the documents that appoint Ms. Cunha 
as the SCC company representative for the purposes of this matter? Sami,  if 
this is right I would have no objections for you signing these documents, but 
you don't have any position with SCC. Weren't these to be give n to Nate 
Neuman for him to have executed at the SCC office in Cuiaba?

Ana Paula, is it possible to e-mail or fax the documents to us here, and for 
us to signand fax back, or does the court need originals?

Dear John:

Reference is made to our mail dated as of May 11th, 2001, in order to inform 
you that, according to understandings held with Ms. Daniele Cunha, the power 
of attorney and the company representative letter related to the labor action 
filed by Luiz Alexandre Zago has already been forwarded to Mr. Sami Arap 
Sobrinho.

Taking into account the fact that Mr. Arap Sobrinho shall only sign the above 
mentioned documents with your express consent, we kindly request you to 
contact him regarding the issue, the sooner the possible. In fact, we will 
appreciate if you could contact him tomorrow, so that the documents may be 
filed at the labor court within the established deadline.

Since Ms. Daniele Cunha shall be functioning as the company representative at 
this case, I would like to know if she may be copied of all of the exchanged 
mail regarding the matter.

At last, we await your guidance as to whom shall the legal fees billing 
related to this case be addressed to.

Best regards,

Privileged and confidential

Dear John:

The purpose of this mail is to provide you with the term of the hearing at 
court, copy attached hereto, which took place on May 07th, 2001, at the labor 
action filed by Luis Alexandre Zago, occasion in which the written defense 
has been presented by EPCB, copy also attached hereto.

According to such a hearing term, it has been designated a discovery hearing 
at court for May 30th, 2001, at 3 p.m., occasion in which a company 
representative of EPCB, with his employee booklet (CTPS), shall attend the 
hearing, as well as up to three witnesses  that may be able to testify 
favorably to EPCB.

In this sense, below please find the subject over which evidence shall be 
produced by EPCB at such a discovery hearing:

i) that EPE hired the Superior Construction Company in order to build the 
thermo electric plant;

ii) that the Superior Construction Company has entered into a re-hiring 
agreement with the Siemens Ltda. company in order to build the thermo 
electric plant, company which, in its turn, has hired the ENESA company for 
such a purpose;

iii) that the Superior Construction Company has used EPCB in order to 
diligence in the sense that the thermo electric plant building was been 
performed in accordance with the hired by and between the EPE and Superior 
Company Construction companies;

iv) that the claimant was an employee of the ENESA company; that ENESA 
company paid the employee's salaries; that EPE and EPCB have never contacted 
the claimant; that the ENESA company was the responsible for the selection of 
the professionals that it understood as necessary for the services 
compliance; that it was up to ENESA company to give commands to the claimant; 
that it was ENESA company that determined  the services to be performed by 
the claimant.

We would also like to inform that it has been determined by the court the 
deadline of 15 days for EPCB to present at the case files (i) its articles of 
associations; (ii) power of attorney and (iii) company representative letter. 
For such, we kindly request that such documents, duly certified, be forwarded 
directly to our local correspondent attorney in Cuiab? - Ms.  Luciana 
Cristina Pereira Cardoso, at the address, Av. Historiador Rubens de Mendon?a, 
1836, sala 905, bairro Bosque da Sa?de, Cuiab?, MT, up till May 18th, 2001, 
so that we may present them at the case files in the stipulated deadline.

Also, we would like to stress that in case EPCB decides to indicate a company 
representative that has not the Portuguese as his mother language to attend 
the hearing at court, it will be necessary to request court the indication of 
a public sworn translator. Therefore, we kindly request you to inform us, up 
till May 21st, 2001, if such will be needed so that we may take the necessary 
measures in this regard in time.

We do clarify, however, that we find it unnecessary the attendance of a 
foreign company representative in the extent that Ms. Daniele Cunha, who 
attended the first hearing at court, has shown enough and necessary knowledge 
in order to function as company representative at the present case.

At last, please advise as to whom shall the legal fees billing related to 
this case be addressed to.

Please contact us should you need any further clarification on the above.

Best regards,
Ana Paula Gon?alves.

P.S. Please advise should you need a free translation of both the term of the 
hearing, as well as of the written defense presented by EPCB in the case.

It sounds of interest, but before subscribing, could we see a sample -- 
perhaps 4th Qtr. '00, if they are unwilling to send a courtesy copy of the 
current report?

1.  Responding to Don's voicemail of earlier today, I will be able to
participate in the Quinque conference call tomorrow.

2.  With regard to Clay Mahaffey's question, the MDL Order itself envisions
that the transferee judge (i.e., Judge Downes) will decide the remand
motion.  See page 2 of the Panel's April 10, 2000 Transfer Order.

3.  To be sure, the Transfer Order says that the remand motion can be
decided by the transferee judge.  It does not say that it must be. Also, the
Transfer Order has the standard boilerplate paragraph telling the transferee
judge that he can remand claims or actions as appropriate.   However, the
context strongly indicates that the Panel thinks the remand decision is for
Judge Downes.  Indeed, at oral argument before the Panel, the plaintiffs'
lawyer made a big deal about how the Kansas judge was about to rule on the
remand motion.  The response from the Panel essentially was "tell it to the
transferee judge."

4.   There is case law that envisions that the transferee judge can decide
removal / remand issues.  Those cases are cited in the KN brief to the
Panel.  A couple of the cites are also picked up in the Transfer Order.

This will confirm my conference with Scott and Tanya, who instructed me to 
proceed forward with arbitration against Triad.

Attached for your review is the proposed arbitration demand in the 
above-referenced action.  I may change the description of ENA as an "energy 
marketer" and just leave it blank, given how difficult it is to describe 
everything ENA does.  I may do the same thing with the description of Triad.  

Please let me know if you have any comments and whether you approve my filing 
it.  Once I have your authority, I will file it as soon as I have received 
the $8,500 filing fee check, which I am requesting from accounting.

Many thanks.

Last evening we discussed with Robin Gibbs an e-mail we would send to the 
"List of 100," telling them to be circumspect with electronic mail 
communications.  I prepared a short e-mail and had Barrett Reasoner take a 
look and approve it
last night.  Here it is:

Andy Wu from the EES side is the most familiar with this contract and the 
negotiations surrounding it.  Very soon we could be asking John Lavoratto to 
make a call that would be partially based on the legal strength of our 
ability to blow up this deal instead of re-negotiating it for a loss.  Jay 
and I are trying to give you a heads up before John calls you for advice.

Subject: Pacbell Contract

Richard,

Don Black would like to get your opinion on Enron's right to cancel the 
Pacbell contract under section 41. (What odds would you give Enron of winning 
in court?) The current view on the EES side is that other sections of the 
contract provide Pac bell with a cap, which trumps section 41.  If you have 
any questions, please give me a call.

Thanks
Jay

Dear Bernard,

I am grateful for your reply.  I assume that you need nothing further in the 
way of documentation from me regarding the liquidator issue at this time.  If 
that is not correct, I trust that you will let me know immediately.  In the 
future, in order to streamline these matters, please include me in the 
communication loop.  I realize that you did not know that I would be involved 
in the the process of re-extending the liquidation of EGLE.

I need your (and/or Michel's) immediate help in substituting a new 
liquidator.  Please let me know what qualifications are necessary at your 
earliest convenience.  I want to have the necessary papers filed in France 
before year end unless there is a reason that this absolutely cannot be done.

Britt

Please call (or have your office call) or fax me Monday and let me know

you have not received them.

I'm forwarding a notice from the California ISO, telling us it will be 
responding to a very broad Subpoena from the Electricity Oversight Board 
(EOB).  Many of the questions relate to the period of from September 2000 
through November 2000.  The ISO indicates that it will be answering the 
requests because the EOB has granted what it believes is an adequate 
protective order.  This order agrees to keep the answers to certain questions 
confidential, but to provide them to the CPUC and the AG if they agree to 
keep them confidential.  If we have concerns about the confidential order we 
are supposed to advise the ISO by Monday 12/1, at 9:00 a.m.  The subpoeana, 
and confidential order, and a letter explaining the treatment of the various 
requests are attached.

I am assuming that because the order appears to protect our commercial 
interests, we will not protest this.  Richard - let me know if you want to 
have a conference call on this and I'll have Lysa set one up.

Subject: CAISO Notice - Electricity Oversight Board (EOB) Further Subpoena


  ISO Market Participants and Scheduling Coordinators:

  The Electricity Oversight Board ("EOB") has issued a further
subpoena to the ISO in the context of its ongoing investigation of
California's electricity grid and markets during and subsequent to the
Summer 2000. The subpoena seeks information that is confidential under ISO
Tariff Section 20.3.2. This notice is provided in accordance with Tariff
Section 20.3.4 and includes the subpoena as an attachment.

  The EOB has issued three letters in which it sets forth the
confidential treatment it will afford confidential information produced by
the ISO including:

* an initial letter dated July 20 which addresses data subject to ISO
Tariff Section 20.3.;
* a letter dated July 28 which addresses additional data; and
* a letter dated October 3 which clarifies that the confidential
treatment set forth in the July 20 and 28 letters will be applied by the EOB
on an ongoing basis in its investigation of the electricity markets.

  The three letters are attached to this notice.

  The ISO will mark as confidential documents it produces to
the EOB that contain information subject to 20.3.2. It is the ISO's
understanding that the confidential treatment provided by the EOB to
information subject to 20.3.2 is satisfactory to Market Participants. The
ISO intends to comply with the EOB subpoena in a timely manner on December
18. If a Market Participant requires any further confidentiality protection,
the ISO expects such Market Participant to take timely action to obtain
directly from the EOB such further protection so that production by the ISO
is not delayed. The ISO would appreciate being notified of any such action
and its resolution so that it can comply with its responsibilities as set
forth in ISO Tariff section 20.3.

  The EOB contact related to the subpoena is Eric Saltmarsh
who can be reached at (916) 322-8601.

  Any concerns relating to the EOB's subpoena should be
communicated by 9:00 a.m. on Monday, December 11th, to Jeanne Sol, at
jsole@caiso.com <mailto:jsole@caiso.comburns@caiso.com> , and copied to
Charlie Robinson at crobinson@caiso.com <mailto:crobinson@caiso.com>  and

Thanks Richard,

The reason I asked was because our IT people in Houston have told us that we 
cannot transfer emails that we need beyond the retention period to word 
documents.  That seemed a bit strange, but they were quite emphatic.   I have 
clarified the rule with our IT head.

Thanks a lot, and take care,

Hi Richard,

Someone made an inquiry to me regarding the policy.  

It is my understanding that if email is not deleted or copied into a word 
document in order to avoid deletion, then it will be (or should be) destroyed 
automatically after the expiration of the retention period.  We have been 
telling our people to only move information from Outlook to Word documents if 
they feel that they need to retain it for more than the appropriate retention 
period.

Please let me know if this is consistent with the policy.

Thanks, and hope all is well with you.

Earlier today you asked what McKenna's damage figures are.  In response to 
interrogatories, McKenna contends that he is entitled to "$2,775,000 plus an 
additional amount of up to $1,000,000 depending on the MW capacity of Enron's 
plant."  Under the agreement, he would be entitled -  if the power plant in 
question fell under the contract's terms --  to $175,000 when the PPA was 
signed, $1.5 milllion five days after financing and another $1.5 million when 
the plant was completed.  In addition, he would be entitled to $4,000 for 
each MW above 200MW.

Are you receiving and are you reviewing the monthly fee statements from the
professionals, including Greenberg Glusker?  I believe you agreed to do this
and it would surely help share some of the load.  Let me know.  Best,

Richard,

Don Black would like to get your opinion on Enron's right to cancel the 
Pacbell contract under section 41. (What odds would you give Enron of winning 
in court?) The current view on the EES side is that other sections of the 
contract provide Pac bell with a cap, which trumps section 41.  If you have 
any questions, please give me a call.

Thanks
Jay

As feared, the judge denied our motion to compel arbitration.  Liz said the
judge had read all the pleadings and the cases, and he seemed prepared to
rule before argument.  After listening to argument, the judge denied the
motion to compel arbitration because

--  12 other adversaries are pending dealing with similar issues
--  arbitration would interfere with efficient administration of the estate
--  a Discovery Mediator has been appointed to supervise cases
--  not convinced claims I and II are non-core proceedings
--  2 counts of the complaint would be left with him in any event
--  he has discretion.

Interestingly, from the bench, he did not rule that Claims I and II are
core matters, he simply stated that he was not convinced they were
non-core.  We have a right to an immediate appeal.  There are definitely
pros and cons to it.  I'd be happy to discuss them with you in person or do
an email for your consideration.  Let me know which way you'd like the
analysis.

We have only 10 days from the entry of the order to file a notice of
appeal.  I'm not certain whether the order denying the arbitration was
entered today, but if not, it probably will be entered tomorrow.   For
planning purposes, let's assume that our notice of appeal has to be filed
on December 22, which is next Friday.

Wish the results had gone the other way, but it's not over yet!

Privileged and confidential

Dear John:

Thank you for your prompt response regarding the matter.
I have received you mail asking me to call you and I have reached Mr. Randy 
Pais.

According to the discussed with him, please be informed that Mr. Arap 
Sobrinho  as delegate manager in EPCB articles of association is able to sign 
both the company representative letter, as well as the power of attorney to 
Tozzini Freire.

It is important to clarify that Ms. Cunha shall be representing EPCB in 
court, since the labor action has been filed against both EPCB and EPE and 
not SCC.

Unfortunately, these documents have to be filed before court in their 
originals. Mr. Pais has requested me to fax me a copy of the signed power of 
attorney as soon as I have it.

As regards the correspondence regarding this matter, I am already copying all 
of the people mentioned by you.

Should you need any further assistance in connection with the matter, please 
advise.

Best regards,
Ana Paula Gon?alves

>>> <John.Schwartzenburg@enron.com> 15/05/01 20:32 >>>


Ana Paula, thanks for keeping after me on this.

We have decided to rely on Ms. Cunha as the company representative to be
present in court. This will avoid the need for an official, court appointed
tramslator. She will be supported by Randy Pais, Nate Neuman or others as
needed either from Houston or traveling to Brazil as needed. The SCC expat
presence in Brazil will be greatly diminished in the next several weeks.

Please copy Ms. Cunha  Mr. Randy Pais and Mr. Richard Sanders on all
correspondence related to this matter. Randy Pais is the internal
transactional lawyer at EEOS/SCC working the Cuiaba project; Richard
Sanders is the internal litigation management lawyer at Enron Wholesale who
supports our business unit.

I want to make sure I understand what is meant by the power of attorney and
company representative letter. Are these the documents that appoint Ms.
Cunha as the SCC company representative for the purposes of this matter?
Sami,  if this is right I would have no objections for you signing these
documents, but you don't have any position with SCC. Weren't these to be
give n to Nate Neuman for him to have executed at the SCC office in Cuiaba?

Ana Paula, is it possible to e-mail or fax the documents to us here, and
for us to signand fax back, or does the court need originals?

Dear John:

Reference is made to our mail dated as of May 11th, 2001, in order to
inform you that, according to understandings held with Ms. Daniele Cunha,
the power of attorney and the company representative letter related to the
labor action filed by Luiz Alexandre Zago has already been forwarded to Mr.
Sami Arap Sobrinho.

Taking into account the fact that Mr. Arap Sobrinho shall only sign the
above mentioned documents with your express consent, we kindly request you
to contact him regarding the issue, the sooner the possible. In fact, we
will appreciate if you could contact him tomorrow, so that the documents
may be filed at the labor court within the established deadline.

Since Ms. Daniele Cunha shall be functioning as the company representative
at this case, I would like to know if she may be copied of all of the
exchanged mail regarding the matter.

At last, we await your guidance as to whom shall the legal fees billing
related to this case be addressed to.

Best regards,
APG

Privileged and confidential

Dear John:

The purpose of this mail is to provide you with the term of the hearing at
court, copy attached hereto, which took place on May 07th, 2001, at the
labor action filed by Luis Alexandre Zago, occasion in which the written
defense has been presented by EPCB, copy also attached hereto.

According to such a hearing term, it has been designated a discovery
hearing at court for May 30th, 2001, at 3 p.m., occasion in which a company
representative of EPCB, with his employee booklet (CTPS), shall attend the
hearing, as well as up to three witnesses  that may be able to testify
favorably to EPCB.

In this sense, below please find the subject over which evidence shall be
produced by EPCB at such a discovery hearing:

i) that EPE hired the Superior Construction Company in order to build the
thermo electric plant;

ii) that the Superior Construction Company has entered into a re-hiring
agreement with the Siemens Ltda. company in order to build the thermo
electric plant, company which, in its turn, has hired the ENESA company for
such a purpose;

iii) that the Superior Construction Company has used EPCB in order to
diligence in the sense that the thermo electric plant building was been
performed in accordance with the hired by and between the EPE and Superior
Company Construction companies;

iv) that the claimant was an employee of the ENESA company; that ENESA
company paid the employee's salaries; that EPE and EPCB have never
contacted the claimant; that the ENESA company was the responsible for the
selection of the professionals that it understood as necessary for the
services compliance; that it was up to ENESA company to give commands to
the claimant; that it was ENESA company that determined  the services to be
performed by the claimant.

We would also like to inform that it has been determined by the court the
deadline of 15 days for EPCB to present at the case files (i) its articles
of associations; (ii) power of attorney and (iii) company representative
letter. For such, we kindly request that such documents, duly certified, be
forwarded directly to our local correspondent attorney in Cuiab? - Ms.
Luciana Cristina Pereira Cardoso, at the address, Av. Historiador Rubens de
Mendon?a, 1836, sala 905, bairro Bosque da Sa?de, Cuiab?, MT, up till May
18th, 2001, so that we may present them at the case files in the stipulated
deadline.

Also, we would like to stress that in case EPCB decides to indicate a
company representative that has not the Portuguese as his mother language
to attend the hearing at court, it will be necessary to request court the
indication of a public sworn translator. Therefore, we kindly request you
to inform us, up till May 21st, 2001, if such will be needed so that we may
take the necessary measures in this regard in time.

We do clarify, however, that we find it unnecessary the attendance of a
foreign company representative in the extent that Ms. Daniele Cunha, who
attended the first hearing at court, has shown enough and necessary
knowledge in order to function as company representative at the present
case.

At last, please advise as to whom shall the legal fees billing related to
this case be addressed to.

Please contact us should you need any further clarification on the above.

Best regards,
Ana Paula Gon?alves.

P.S. Please advise should you need a free translation of both the term of
the hearing, as well as of the written defense presented by EPCB in the
case.

Attached is a revised draft of the document I sent to you all earlier this 
morning.  Given Marcus's well-placed concern that this letter would probably 
not be privileged from discovery in this or other related matters, I (a) 
beefed up the confidentiality provisions and (b) eliminated references to the 
reasons that we are including a confidentiality provision.  I also mentioned 
that Enron would be billed directly by Scottsboro's outside counsel in this 
matter, which I know was a specific concern of Dean Varnek, Scottsboro's 
attorney.

Please let me have your other comments/authority at your earliest convenience.

Attached for your immediate review and approval is a proposed letter from 
Enron (please make sure I correctly identified the right Enron entity) 
agreeing to idemnify and defend Scottsboro in this matter.  I told 
Scottsboro's attorney yesterday that this would be coming once we confirmed 
that all the loads for which Scottsboro is being sued are our loads.  Nicole 
tells me that this is in fact the case.  I would like to send out this letter 
ASAP today, to give us time to make arrangements with Scottsboro's usual 
attorneys, who then will be asked to get an extension of time for Scottsboro 
to answer from the trucker's counsel.

I await your advice (Richard, per your instructions today, I will assume that 
you have no problem with this letter).

This morning I received a copy of service of process that was served on Cogen 
Technologies Linden Venture in the Roger Atkinson matter.  Cogen Technologies 
Linden Venture had previously been served with a summons and complaint in the 
Atkinson matter in mid April.  I forwarded the matter to El Paso Energy 
Company, who had purchased ENA's interest in the Cogen companies effective 
late February 2001.  El Paso retained Ed Fanning of McCarter & English to 
represent Cogen's interests.  We have worked with Ed in other Cogen matters 
before, and I have found him to be both effective and efficient.  This matter 
relates to personal injuries allegedly suffered by Atkinson while working at 
a construction site at the Linden facility in December 2000.  David Waterson 
of El Paso recently called me concerning potential defense and indemnity 
obligations that El Paso believes NEPCO may owe Cogen with respect to this 
incident.  We will need to review NEPCO's contract with Cogen to determine if 
any such obligations exist.

The document that I received today is a Notice of Motion to Consolidate and 
to Compel Inspection.  This motion seeks to consolidate the Atkinson v. Cogen 
case with a case that was apparently also filed in New Jersey state court as 
Roger Atkinson v. JEDI Linden and NEPCO and to compel an inspection of the 
construction site where the accident allegedly occurred.  I have asked Becky 
Stephens whether we have received service of process on either JEDI Linden or 
NEPCO.  To date, we have not.  However, I expect that service of process is 
in the works, and I have asked Becky to be on the look out for it.  As this 
new suit also apparently concerns personal injury claims, I am forwarding a 
copy to both Rob and Bob, so that you can begin to process and investigate 
the claim in your usual manner. 

Please let me know if there is any other information you need in order to 
begin our review for potential defense/indemnity to Cogen.  Thanks.

Subject: Bullet Summary of the ISO's Amendment No. 33 (December 8 Filing)

After I wrote this I was forwarded Steve Hall's summary.  There's some=20
redundancy but hopefully, this provides a few more details.    Also, Mary H=
.=20
and I are informed that on Friday the FERC issued an order that appears to=
=20
approve the ISO=01,s request in full.

Bullet Summary of the ISO's Amendment No. 33 (December 8 Filing):

The following is a summary of the filing made by the ISO.

1) ISO=01,s $250/MWh Soft Cap
a) Summarized: ISO Claims its proposal is identical to the FERC proposed so=
ft=20
cap but raises the soft cap level to $250 from the $150/MWh proposed by the=
=20
FERC: =01&The ISO would replace the current cap on Imbalance Energy bids wi=

e=20
Commission=01,s November 1 Order. The ISO=01,s scheduling system will not r=
eject=20
Energy bids priced in excess of the $250/MWh price cap, but will evaluate=
=20
those bids in price merit order. However, if the ISO issues Dispatch=20
instructions to Scheduling Coordinators for Energy that has been bid in=20
excess of the $250 soft cap, those bids will not set the Market Clearing=20
Price for Imbalance Energy. Rather, those Scheduling Coordinators will be=
=20
paid in accordance with their bids.=018

b) Refund risk and cost documentation above $250. =01&Imbalance Energy abov=
e the=20
level of the soft price cap would be subject to refund, based on subsequent=
=20
review by the Commission. It also should require Scheduling Coordinators th=

submit such bids to supply supporting cost information to the Commission, a=
s=20
well as to the ISO and to the California Electricity Oversight Board so tha=
t=20
they may bring questionable bids to the Commission=01,s attention.

i) Appears to imply that the proposed reporting requirement is supplemental=
=20
to what was requested by the FERC. See p. 8

ii) Regarding production costs:  fuel, taxes, emission credits, startup cos=
ts=20
are all listed as costs.  However, no mention of noncontiguous scheduling=
=20
costs or reasonable profit.

iii) Quasi safe harbor on opportunity costs:  In a footnote to cover letter=

ISO states it will particularly scrutinize any opportunity costs in excess =
of=20
10% of the production costs or $25/MWh, whichever is lesser.

c) Useful quote: =01&In light of current fuel prices and the ISO=01,s recen=

experience in receiving less than a thousand MW of Imbalance Energy bids at=
=20
prices of $150 or less in many hours, the ISO believes that a $150 soft cap=
=20
would be tantamount to procuring all Imbalance Energy on an as-bid basis.=
=018

d) Effective date: 4 p.m. PST 12/8/00.=20

e) Term of this soft cap:  lesser of 3 mo (3/8/01) or whenever the Commissi=
on=20
supercedes it by its own order.

f) Applicable tariff sections.  Section 2.5.23.2 and .3.  See attachments=

A1/B1 to the filing.


2) Participating Generator Penalties
a) Summary: =01&the ISO proposes in Amendment No. 33 to assess penalties ag=

Participating Generators that refuse to operate in response to an ISO=20
Dispatch instruction during a System Emergency or when the ISO is acting to=
=20

=20
than Load that has not been designated by agreement or regulation as=20
interruptible, the Participating Generator would pay an additional penalty =

$1000/MWh for the Energy that it failed to deliver.=018
b) Allowed excuse:  The penalties would not apply if the Participating=20

subsequently demonstrates (documentation within 72 hours) , that its=20
Generating Unit, System Unit or System Resource was physically unable to=20

c) Applicable tariff sections. Amends portions of 5.6.1 .2 and .3. See=20
attachments A2/B2 to the filing.

d) Effective date: Same as the ISO=01,s new soft cap: 4 p.m. PST 12/8/00

Gary,

In preparation for the Outlook migration, we have come up with the basic 
structure of the public folders needed for EWS Legal.  The initial access to 
create and/or rename folders should be given to the users identified next to 
the group and/or subgroup (i.e. for Enron Global Markets - grant access to 
Alan Aronowitz and Nita Garcia).   Upon completion of the migration, the 
assistant assigned to each of these groups will procure access to others in 
her group and create additional folders as they may be needed.

Please let us know if you have any questions regarding the attached 
information.

Thanks.

Janette Elbertson and Nony Flores

Attached for your immediate review and approval is a proposed letter from 
Enron (please make sure I correctly identified the right Enron entity) 
agreeing to idemnify and defend Scottsboro in this matter.  I told 
Scottsboro's attorney yesterday that this would be coming once we confirmed 
that all the loads for which Scottsboro is being sued are our loads.  Nicole 
tells me that this is in fact the case.  I would like to send out this letter 
ASAP today, to give us time to make arrangements with Scottsboro's usual 
attorneys, who then will be asked to get an extension of time for Scottsboro 
to answer from the trucker's counsel.

I await your advice (Richard, per your instructions today, I will assume that 
you have no problem with this letter).

IS TRADING AN INSIDER'S GAME?
Buying, selling of electricity is a growth business, but some say deck is 
stacked against consumers


By Craig D. Rose
STAFF WRITER

June 6, 2001



While Californians decry deregulation's failure to deliver a competitive 
market, electricity wholesalers have quietly developed a vast and rapidly 
growing business of buying and selling power among themselves.

The deals take place on high-tech trading floors in Houston and elsewhere 
around the country, as well as on Internet-based trading systems.

Some experts say this electricity trading is a key mechanism for raising 
consumer power prices, yet it's largely unregulated.

"Electricity trading is like buying stock -- when you have ability to change 
the stock price," said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economics professor 
and member of the state grid operator's market surveillance group.

Energy companies say the buying and selling of contracts to deliver power 
provides risk management, allowing plant owners to presell their electricity, 
lock in prices and avoid fluctuations. The rough and tumble of the free 
market, they add, is the most efficient means of allocating a resource like 
electricity.

But industry critics say trading is far from a competitive market paradigm. 
In their view, it's a means of communication -- a way for energy insiders to 
collude and raise prices under the guise of competition.

To be sure, the trading arms of major energy companies have emerged as stars 
in an industry where profit surges of 300 percent or 400 percent are not 
uncommon.

The transactions, shrouded in secrecy, can leave ownership of a critical 
commodity in unknown hands. Consider the case of power generated by AES 
Corp.'s California plants.

In 1998, AES made a bold move. Immediately after purchasing power plants that 
gave it control of 10 percent of the state's electric generating capacity, 
the company sold the output from its plants for the next 20 years to Williams 
Cos.

Williams did not sit on this treasure trove of electrons. The Tulsa, Okla., 
company soon sold 80 percent of what it bought.

It is difficult to say who owns that power now. Some might be owned by Sempra 
Trading, a sister company of SDG&E. Or some could be owned by Enron Corp., 
the nation's biggest electricity trader.

A spokeswoman for Williams conceded that Williams itself may have repurchased 
some of the electricity it sold earlier. But trading companies closely guard 
their positions.

This much can be said with certainty: Electricity that AES sold for less than 
5 cents per kilowatt-hour to Williams changed hands perhaps 10 times in the 
wholesale market and emerged at times in recent months with a price tag for 
consumers that was 300 percent higher.

Williams' trading profits increased by 523 percent in the first quarter this 
year.


Advance sales
All this buying and selling creates curious confluences.
In their attempt to deflect criticism over high prices, generating companies 
such as Duke Energy -- operator of the South Bay Power Plant in Chula and 
others in the state -- frequently note that they sell most of their 
electricity far in advance. But they acknowledge less often that their 
trading units may also be buying power, which could boost the company's 
electricity inventory.

Duke was the fourth biggest electricity trader last year and cited its 
trading activity as a prime contributor to its wholesale business profits, 
which soared 324 percent in the first quarter to $348 million.

It is a company's power traders who frequently direct plant operators to 
increase or decrease the generation of power in response to market conditions.

Energy companies have little option but to turn to trading for profits. One 
of the better kept secrets of electrical deregulation and its promise of 
competition is that there is remarkably little competition in the production 
side of the business.

For one thing, electricity is a commodity; power from one company is 
indistinguishable from that generated by others.

More important, nearly all modern plants generate power from turbines built 
by a handful of manufacturers. The result? Modern plants owned by different 
companies produce power at nearly identical cost.

"The cost of power produced by modern plants is all within a mil 
(one-thousandth of a dollar)," said Michael Peevey, an adviser to Gov. Gray 
Davis and former president of Southern California Edison.

So the extraction of profit in the electricity business relies much more on 
trading. Traders' profits rise when prices are volatile -- plunging, or even 
better, rising sharply.


Little regulation
But despite the obvious temptation to manipulate the market, the burgeoning 
electricity trading business has remained largely unregulated.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission does require quarterly filings from 
energy traders, but these often provide incomplete information, or at least 
little that has been of concern to FERC.

In fact, although the trading of electricity grew more than a hundredfold 
from 1996 to 2000, FERC has taken no major enforcement action against a 
trader. After the onset of the California crisis last year, FERC has acted 
once. That was against Williams, which agreed to pay $8 million without 
admitting guilt to resolve an allegation that it withheld supply to pump up 
prices.

FERC's record of enforcement in the area of power trading stands in contrast 
to a long list of enforcement actions within other markets taken by the 
Securities Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

FERC has recently added staff to its market oversight operations. But William 
Massey, a FERC commissioner, says the agency's effort is still inadequate.

"Electricity can be flipped, stripped and chopped up," Massey said. "It's an 
extraordinarily complicated market.

"The sophisticated marketers and traders have simply moved past us. We're 
kind of horse and buggy in our approach and they're out there in rocket ships 
flying around ... The problem is that sophisticated traders don't necessarily 
produce reasonable prices. They produce profits."

Before deregulation, electricity trading was a low-key affair. Regulated 
utilities dealt power back and forth on a reciprocal basis to fill 
electricity shortfalls in their control areas. There was little trading for 
profit until the mid-1990s, after federal legislation and FERC rulings opened 
the market.

Major traders include large energy companies, sister companies of 
California's major utilities and Wall Street firms.


Market volatility
In many ways, the trading of power is similar to that of other commodities. 
But there are important differences. Because it cannot be stored and its use 
is so fundamental, the price of electricity is the most volatile of all.
When supplies are tight, a single supplier can rapidly raise prices to 
budget-busting levels, as evidenced by Duke Energy's recent admission that it 
charged California nearly $4,000 for a megawatt-hour of power, a quantity 
that probably sold hours earlier for one-tenth of that sum or less.

Wolak, the Stanford economist, and state Sen. Joseph Dunn, D-Garden Grove, 
who is investigating the state power market, say trading allows companies to 
collude under the guise of competition. Instead of wringing out lowest costs, 
the wholesale trading market serves to raise prices, they say.

"As I trade to you and you trade to me, we communicate to each other what 
price we would like to get," said Wolak. "It's not collusive. It's just 
communicating price."

Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Enron, the nation's biggest power trader, said 
California's problem is not the result of trading.

"It's a result of shortages," Palmer said.

Underscoring its emphasis on trading, Enron's new headquarters tower in 
downtown Houston rises from a six-story block of new trading floors, 
including expanded space for electricity trading.

Enron also pioneered trading in cyberspace and its Enron Online site claims 
to be the most active computer-based trading market.

The Houston company argues that consumers won't fully benefit from power 
trading and deregulation until they have greater choice in choosing their 
power supplier. And the company says FERC has not done enough to open access 
to transmission lines, which would allow traders to move power around the 
country. To that end, Enron has lobbied hard for President Bush's plan for a 
national electricity grid.

Palmer says the notion that the price of electricity rises each time it is 
traded is mistaken.

"The market is always looking for the real price of a commodity," Palmer said.

Dunn, the California state senator, says his investigation found a different 
function for trading. At a time when supply barely meets or falls short of 
demand, he noted, companies with electricity to sell have to worry only about 
how high to set their price.

"The trader is a pawn in the generator's game to drive up prices," said Dunn. 
"Trading develops a level of trust. You, my alleged competitor, will bid in 
the same patterns and I will respond not in a competitive pattern but in a 
complimentary pattern."

The state senator said his investigation found evidence that on several days, 
energy companies appeared to test their ability to drive prices up, without 
being undercut by competitors.

This ability to drive up prices without competitive consequence is a key test 
of market power, the technical term for manipulation or price fixing.

But Dunn also conceded that antitrust violations can be hard to prove in 
court. He suggested that even if the trading behavior falls short of 
antitrust violations, it remains anti-competitive and devastating for the 
California economy.

To Harry Trebing, a utility industry expert and professor emeritus at 
Michigan State University, wholesale electricity trading is reminiscent of 
what took place in the 1920s and early '30s. Back then, utility companies 
created complex networks of holding companies that traded stock among 
themselves, driving up prices in the process.

Undoing that scheme was a focus of President Franklin Roosevelt's 
administration. Congress ended up barring national power companies and 
tightening regulation of utilities, in an effort to counteract their tendency 
to create markets that work only for insiders.

"The broad goals of trading are the same," Trebing said.

"The goal is to maximize profits through raising prices."

See below.  The settlement figures that I gave you last week ($13 million v.
"high 20s") were for Farallon and Oaktree together, but NOT Legg Mason. 
Farallon's damages are about 62% of the Farallon/Oaktree total, so it appears
that Hennigan is looking for around $17 million to settle Farallon

Richard-

I have two requests that I hope you can help me with.  First, I wanted to see 
if there was an executed document removing Intrust.  If there is, I would 
like to get a copy of that.  Also, you mentioned a "side letter" agreement 
drawn up to allow the GPs to have the right to remove Intrust.  I would also 
like to get a copy of that document.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Russ

Meeting of Insurance Law Section
 Four Seasons Hotel - Austin
 Room: San Jacinto West
 June 14, 2001

The Insurance Law Section would like to personally invite you to attend the 
Insurance Law Section meeting and the free CLE which will be presented next 
Thursday, June 14, 2001 at the State Bar convention in Austin.

On June 14, 2001, the Insurance Law Section will hold its annual meeting and 
sponsor its annual 3 hour CLE program at the Four Season's Hotel. As usual, 
Council members and Committee chairs will be elected  by the Section members  
at the annual meeting. The schedule for the meeting and the CLE program is 
set out below. We hope that you can attend the annual meeting and the CLE 
presentations.

1:30 PM to 2:00 PM - - annual section meeting and election of Council members

2:00 PM to 5:00 PM  FREE   CLE program


2 p.m. - 3 p.m.
Insurance Declaratory Judgment Actions
Topic: This panel will consider declaratory judgment actions regarding 
insurance coverage. When should they be filed? Who should file them? What 
discovery is necessary and appropriate? Can they usually be resolved by 
summary judgment? How should these cases be tried? What is the proper role of 
the expert? What is the proper role of the jury? What are the appellate 
twists?

Comment: The Supreme Court of Texas has repeatedly suggested that insurers 
and insureds alike put this procedural device to more use.

Panelists:
Mike Huddleston
Karen Keltz
Rusty McMains
Claudia Volaire
Beth Bradley
Stephen Walraven

3 p.m.- 4 p.m.

When Negligence Blindly Assists Deliberateness

Topic: Suppose Mr. Sleeze Ball sets out to kill his business partner, Cheese 
Square. Suppose further that Mrs. Ball helps Sleeze in various ways which 
turn out to be necessary. Suppose further that Mrs. Ball does not realize 
what Sleeze is up to and does not foresee the consequences of her actions. 
Finally, suppose Sleeze is convicted of murder and then a wrongful death 
action is brought by Cheesey's family (Swiss, Cheddar, and the rest) against 
both Mr. and Mrs. Ball, and their dog Astral. Naturally the Balls have 
homeowner's coverage and Mrs. Ball wants a defense. Question: Should she get 
it?

Comment: This is a burning issue in contemporary liability insurance law, and 
a great deal turns on it. Plaintiff's personal injuries lawyers take note.

Debaters:
Michael Sean Quinn - Affirmative
Christopher Martin - Negative

4 p.m. - 5:00 p.m.

Insurance Defense Guidelines

Topic: Many liability insurers have attempted to issue guidelines and rules 
to govern the ways in which defense lawyers may conduct defenses. Often, if 
the activities of defense counsel do not conform to these guidelines defense 
counsel do not get paid. Recently the Texas legislature outlawed these 
guidelines, or at least some of them. Is this law a good idea, or a bad one? 
Will it be effective? Will it be enforced? Is it really in the interest of 
insureds who are defendants in law suits or is it designed to help lawyers?

Panelists:
Charles Levy
Roland Leon
Clark Richards

Format: Audience participation on all of these topics is welcomed.
 It is positively encouraged, not that it could be stopped anyway.

We hope to see you there next week.

Subject: Responses to FERC Data Request

Attached are the cover letter and narrative responses ENA will provide this 
afternoon to FERC for the non-public investigation into California natural 
gas prices.  Please advise me as soon as possible if you have any concerns.  

These are basically requests for the same information as we have provided 
previously in the San Diego  and the CPUC complaint proceedings.  The main 
difference is in the time period covered.  The San Diego and CPUC data 
requests were for November-December, 2000 and January-April, 2001, 
respectively, and this request is for information from May 1999 for any 
contracts in effect on May 10, 2001. 

I am still waiting for the files with the actual data, and I will forward 
them as soon as available.

Today's Washington Post and Wall Street Journal report that in filings to
the SEC, AES has advised that it and Wiliams are being investigated for
price manipulation by the Department of Justice for alleged withholding of
output in April and May 2000.

This is not a surprise to me, but I had not seen a formal announcement
before.

The Post notes the relationship to the $8 million fine that Williams paid to
settle the FERC complaint.

I have not yet read the SEC filing.

Attached is a draft arbitration demand our outside counsel has prepared on 
the confidentiality issue only.  For what it is worth, outside counsel does 
have some concerns with just arbitrating the confidentiality issue. First, 
they raise the possibility that by only raising the confidentiality issue, we 
might be waiving the guaranty assignability issue. To try to prevent this 
argument, you will note that we have put preservation language in the 
arbitration statement of claim.  We will need to do some additional legal 
research to make sure that would do the trick.  Second, outside counsel tends 
to think the two claims together (confidentiality and the guarantee 
assignability) work better together.  Let's talk soon.

I assume that you have seen the attached letter from Grynberg by now.  For
some people it would be amazing.  For Grynberg, it is simply typical.

Working through the Coordinated Defendants group, it seems to me that the
two viable options are (1) telling Grynberg to get lost or (2) ignoring him.
If you have something else in mind, please let me know.  Thanks.

The committee had a lengthy conference call today.  Let me touch on key
topics.  First, the application to employ PriceWaterhouse is being
contested by both the debtor and the US trustee.  There was a meeting today
with the debtor to narrow differences.  The debtor will provide a list of
its key concerns and we'll see if we can deal with them.  The UST just
believes that there is too much of a chance of conflict between roles in
the two cases.  We'll be setting a hearing soon to get the issue resolved
on way or the other.  Second, PGE has sought broad discovery from PX not
only of individual participants' claims against PGE but also underlying
trading information.  PX contends that much of this information cannot be
disclosed under the tariffs.  For that reason, PX hasn't even kprovided
this information to its participants.  Eisenberg is opposing the discovery
for that reason as well as based on burden to the debtor.  The PX committee
feels that Montali will accomodate discovery, at least to some extent.
Therefore, in the meet and confer this afternoon, the committee probably
will support disclosure if (1) participants get whatever of their
information as is disclosed to PGE, (2) substantial limitations are imposed
on the parties that will have access to the information and the use to
which it can be put and (3) PGE reimburses PX for a part of the cost.  In
addition, the committee intends to file a motion in the PX case requesting
that the debtor be ordered to turn information over to individual
participants and to our accountants who will have the responsibility to
test numbers but not to make general disclosure of accounts of individual
participants.  Third, Howard Weg believes that without some agreement on
the chargeback issue, FERC will take a long time to rule on whether PX
should return collateral.  Accordingly, Weg wants the participants to come
to an agreement that for any specified period, shortfalls will be shared
prorata among participants.  I asked Weg to send an email out to committee
members describing in detail his proposal and the basis for it so that we
could discuss it in detail during our next call.  Fourth, the commandeering
matters are proceeding.  The committee will complete interviews of
prospective counsel next Monday.  In the meantime, the Victims Compensation
Claims Board should rule June 22.  A summary denial is expected.
Interestingly, only about 30% of the participants submitted claims to the
board.  PX's expert opinion was made available to the committee.  He fixes
the value of commandeered contracts at $1.060 billion minus $350 million of
contract prices for a loss of just under $700 million.  We are following up
to test these numbers.  The committee's counsel has been negotiating a
stipulation for relief from stay in the PGE case.  It's moving too slowly,
so our counsel is drafting a stay relief motion for our review.  No one
seems inclined to start a commandeering suit until relief is granted.
Fifth, our counsel is having second thoughts about a stipulation with
Edison that would address the bond, the force majeur litigation and related
matters.  The question that is under review is whether the proposed deal
could be unwound if SCE files its own cha;pter 11 case.  On force majeur,
Judge Montali apparently rejected PGE's argument on that point.  Sixth,
there is still no deal with the trade creditors' committee.  They want
about double the $4 million we're offering.  We expect any day a motion to
extend plan exclusivity by the debtor.  Seventh, we discussed some
committee representation issues.  The committee voted against adding Puget
Sound as a member.  The committee agreed that it represented those who had
claims based on the scheduling coordinator role performed by PX for ISO.
The committee discussed whether it represented IOU's and concluded that it
did if they were owed in their role as sellers to the PX.  Finally, the
next meeting was set at 10 pst on June 25.  Feel free to call if there are
questions.  Bob Nelson

Today's Washington Post and Wall Street Journal report that in filings to
the SEC, AES has advised that it and Wiliams are being investigated for
price manipulation by the Department of Justice for alleged withholding of
output in April and May 2000.

This is not a surprise to me, but I had not seen a formal announcement
before.

The Post notes the relationship to the $8 million fine that Williams paid to
settle the FERC complaint.

I have not yet read the SEC filing.

Subject: Recording Trades from made on Mobile phones  

Cindy,

We have some good news for you.  We have set up a number which can only be 
called from Enron Mobile phones (37373), when you dial this number you will 
hear dialtone.  The dialtone is coming from the phone system at Enron House, 
you are then able to dial exactly as if you were at your desk, ie dial '9' 
and the number you wish to reach.

All calls coming through this route will be recorded and can be retrieved by 
the telecoms team for playback / reference.

We have also ensured that external people cannot dial this number from 
outside the building by using 020 7783 7373.

Let me know if you want to issue a note as a General Announcement or whether 
you wish to handle the distribution of the number.

Regards,

Andy

Instead of providing a phone number could there be a short code or something 
that they do that in the background dials this number so no one gets access 
to this number?   I know that this is an issue in all of the offices with 
traders making deals on cell phones on unrecorded lines.  I do not want to do 
something that puts Enron at risk though.  Thanks Cindy

Cindy,

We can provide a telephone number in the office which the traders can call 
from their mobile phone, they would then be offered dialtone from the 
telephone system and can then dial on to an external party.

The call would then be routed out from the office and would be subject the 
the normal recording criteria.

However I wouldn't recommend this approach as we are opening up an external 
gateway for people to use our telephone system, this would be unmetered and 
not secure. The potential for toll-fraud is something that we need to take 
into account.

Regards,

Andy Cowx

If the traders do a deal from their cell phone, is there a way they can have 
that call routed back through the phones in the building so it gets done on a 
recorded line?  I know if you call someone and then dial some numbers it 
takes you to their cell phone.  Can it work backwards so they hit some 
numbers and it routes the call through the office?   This would help with 
some of our AA issues.  Thanks Cindy

Loretta Lynch, President, California Public Utilities Commission



June 10, 2001

Lynch was appointed March 22, 2000. Previously she was director of Gov. Gray 
Davis' Office of Planning and Research.
Question: What is this summer going to be like in terms of blackouts? What is 
the economic impact going to be?

Answer: I don't think anybody can predict. They are wild guesses or at least 
estimates based on assumptions that we don't know. Three factors influence 
the level of blackouts. One is how hot it's going to be. The second is 
conservation and whether folks will really step up to the plate, both 
business and residences, and conserve their hearts out and load shift to 
non-peak times. We reduced the load 8 to 9 percent in March and April and 
slightly more (11 percent) in May. We're going to have to do better than that 
to avoid blackouts.

The third factor is making sure that the generation that can run does run and 
right now we're doing an abysmal job of that. We have record levels of 
unplanned outages at generating plants. This week 10,000 megawatts were out 
of 35,000 megawatts (42,000 megawatts including municipal utilities) in state 
capacity. Historically, there has only been 3,000 to 4,000 megawatts off at 
any one time.

Does the PUC have no control over when utilities take a plant off line?

Utilities yes, private generators no. Since November the unplanned outages 
have been three, four times what history would show over a 20-year period. 
Exactly what explains that is the heart of one of our investigations.

What can the PUC do about it?

We have been in the plants since mid-January. In January we had 25 days of 
stage 2 alerts, two days of stage 3 in 31 days. We started going in those 
plants although we've had lots of difficulty getting into plants on time and 
most importantly getting the operations and maintenance logs.

Why don't you get an injunction from a judge to tell the private companies 
they have to give the PUC everything it wants?

Frankly, because in this last 100-day period I was trying to not be that 
aggressive, I was trying to work it out with these generators. And we have 
made significant movement with some of those generators.

Is it illegal for a privately owned power company to shut down in order to 
drive up prices?

Isn't that the multibillion dollar question? That's where you match you legal 
theories.

Is the PUC joining in any of these legal actions against FERC and the private 
power generators?

You know we actually asked for help from FERC in getting data from generators 
because FERC has wide access to all sorts of market data. I talked to (former 
chairman James) Hoecker directly in September. He said, 'No problem. You just 
send us your data request and we'll make sure they comply.' But we had no 
informal help from the FERC and so we filed a motion, in November, I believe, 
for FERC to compel those people under its jurisdiction to give us basic 
documents. FERC has yet to move on those motions to compel.

Is the PUC is joining in any of the civil actions?

At this point we haven't joined in the private civil lawsuits.

What else can the PUC do?

Well there's a ton of stuff that the PUC does in front of FERC. We appear on 
electricity and natural gas issues and we continue to file formal complaints 
to that administrative agency. For instance, it was the PUC that brought the 
complaint at FERC against El Paso Corp., three weeks after I became president 
of the PUC. We complained about anti-competitive activity. We have brought 
all the motions at FERC to prevent the generators from re-upping their market 
price authority.

If FERC does nothing and allows this market-based rate authority to continue, 
what would you do?

California is experiencing the real time consequences of justice delayed is 
justice denied. Eventually the administrative procedure act would allow us to 
go to court but frankly a variety of utilities and other folks have been 
trying to kick it up to either the D.C. Circuit or the 9th Circuit. 
Preliminary responses from the courts have been that they have failed to 
exhaust administrative remedies.

What's in store for San Diego in terms of price hikes?

Bottom line, it's unrealistic to think that San Diego can continue to be 
charged in the 6 to 7 cent range when everybody else now is being charged in 
the 10 to 11 cent range. But I can't prejudge the level because we're just 
starting to hear the evidence.

How do you think the escrow accounts -- 'our individual charge accounts with 
SDG&E' -- are going to shake down eventually?

Frankly, that's an issue that's also before the commission. What the 
legislation clearly says is that there's this balancing account that San 
Diego is billing things into as a regulatory accounting matter but that's not 
the end of the inquiry. They put the money in and they charge it to a 
regulatory account and then they come to the PUC. Then the PUC judges the 
reasonableness of those charges. And the separate watch dog component of the 
PUC, the Office of Ratepayer Advocates, has done some preliminary analysis on 
SDG&E's charges up through I believe August of 2000 and has questioned a 
large percentage of those charges as unreasonable because of SDG&E's failure 
to hedge when they had hedging opportunities.

Utility executives criticize the PUC on two major counts. They say only half 
the utility plants had to be divested but the PUC set the rate of return and 
other restrictions in such a fashion that it really encouraged utilities to 
dispose of the other half. Second, they say that when the PUC eventually 
allowed them to enter long-term contracts, it did not spell out procedures in 
case the contracts turned out to be unfortunate moves. How would you respond?

The first part wasn't on my watch in terms of the rate of return. That was 
set by the prior PUC. However on that question of rate of return and 50 
percent versus more I think SDG&E is a little separately situated because I 
do think there were some encouragement of SDG&E selling off in order to be 
able to merge. The rate of return may have been lower than the utilities 
wanted . . .

And the criticism about long-term contracts?

I think the long-term contract issue has been painted in simplistic terms and 
it's not a simplistic question. When the utilities came to the commission in 
2000 seeking permission the commission acted faster than it usually acts. On 
July 21 of last year PG&E and Edison came to the commission and said they 
wanted authority to enter into direct bilateral contracts. By Aug. 3 we said 
yes.

But they claim that you did not give them the ground rules.

Oh, we certainly did. We applied the historic reasonableness test. But they 
wanted an up-front guarantee that they would not be second-guessed and my 
concern on that was heightened because they have all these unregulated 
subsidiaries. Because they're now energy trading in the market . . . The 
facts are they did enter contracts and we can show you the contracts they 
entered into in August, September, October and November of last year.

When California's deregulation law was being shaped, why was nobody concerned 
about abuse of market power by the private generating companies?

It is truly astonishing and I believe it's because of an ideological bias 
from my predecessors who said, 'Well, we will have a flood of competition 
into this market because it's just a commodity.' But, in fact, this commodity 
is uniquely situated to not have a flood of competition because you have high 
capital barriers to entry. You have long lead times to increase supply. It's 
a fundamental economic necessity which can't be stored and you can't choose 
not to buy it, there's no effective substitute.

Other states such as Texas and Pennsylvania appear to be doing deregulation 
right. Do you believe it can be done right?

I think the jury's out on that question. Texas started from a position of 
supply and is energy independent and does not report to the FERC in terms of 
its own intrastate transmission grid. Pennsylvania already had an integrated 
utility sharing relationship with other states. The utilities had buy-back 
contracts with the plants that they sold so that they got long-term contracts 
at the time of sale. The utilities also sold a much smaller percentage of 
their plants. I say California went the farthest fastest with the least 
amount of safeguards.

In retrospect, what was the central flaw in this deregulation plan?

The central flaw was not to realize the market power would be exercised by 
the sellers of a fundamental economic necessity for which there is no 
effective substitute.

In the current argument over temporary price caps, the Bush administration 
says this might diminish short-term pain but in the long term would 
discourage new supply. What's your reaction to that?

My reaction is price caps or cost-based pricing is an absolute economic 
necessity for California. The market is broken. Regardless of who broke it 
and how it broke, it's broken, maybe irrevocably. Until we can make a market 
work here we must have some protection for our economy. We really are going 
back a hundred years and reaching back, these companies are re-creating the 
kinds of trust that led to trust busting.

The economy can't withstand this and in terms of the supply argument, yeah 
supply is a state issue. Gov. Davis is streamlining and we have all these 
plants being built and plus we are conserving like never before. We have 
supply coming on line, it's being built, it's not being abandoned and if it 
were abandoned in the unlikely event the people that sunk in hundreds of 
millions of dollars into an investment decided to walk and abandon their 
investment, which isn't rational economic behavior, then the utilities could 
take those over and build it at cost-based building or the power authority or 
whoever. Most of those plants entered the permitting process when the price 
cap was $250 a megawatt.

Talking about rational behavior, it's certainly in the political and economic 
interest of the Bush administration not to see California's economy go in the 
tank, not to see the economy of the whole West Coast be hammered and suffer 
accordingly. If you presume rational behavior on their part, you'd have to 
presume that they're doing what they think is the right thing.

But once again it's a question of are you going to stand on your ideology 
regardless of all facts to the contrary or are you going to try and fix given 
the actual facts that are at play in that market? I think even the most 
committed free market person, if they're principled, recognizes that you need 
a market cop in any market. This market's being gamed in a myriad of ways.

Are you getting anywhere with the FERC in making the arguments that you're 
stating here?

The question right now is who is the FERC? I have not met formally with the 
two new FERC commissioners since they've been confirmed which just occurred 
last week. I look forward to a transition period where the FERC gets off its 
ideology and gets back to practicality and doing its job as a regulator.

Will that happen as long as George Bush and Dick Cheney are saying quite the 
opposite?

California needs to do what it needs to do to protect itself, but I do think 
we may have an opportunity in transition. We can't count on it, but we 
shouldn't close the door to it.

The new electricity plants coming on line for the most part are natural 
gas-fired. Would we still be in a crunch if natural gas prices remain high?

The PUC has been doing everything it possibly can in the last two months and 
will continue to do it in the next several months to encourage utilities to 
add natural gas infrastructure. The other thing is they have to inject 
natural gas into storage right now, even though we know that the price of 
natural gas is too high. California is being gouged on natural gas.

Isn't everybody else being gouged on natural gas prices?

No, God no. Prices at the California border are two to three times higher 
than anyplace else in the country. The problem here is the El Paso line is 
the market maker for the price of gas coming in to California because of 
anti-competitive behavior which I believe was intentional to raise prices. 
That evidence is being heard at the FERC right now.

Are you expecting anything from that administrative law judge at FERC?

We have to be hopeful. The astonishing thing here is that we, California, 
cannot count on the federal government to do its job.

Our department will be migrated to Outlook in two groups.  The first group 
will be migrated on Monday, June 11,  and the second group will be migrated 
on Tuesday, June 12.   You will receive four e-mails from the Outlook 
migration team.  Please do not delete them.  You will need to open the four 
e-mails and follow the instructions to migrate to Outlook.

Assistants, you will be responsible for scheduling training for yourself and 
your assignments.  It is recommended everyone attend a one hour training 
class.  Training can be scheduled by contacting Maggie Cruz at extension 
3-1816.  (Assistants, please coordinate training with your backup so both of 
you are not in training at the same time.)  Outlook migration specialists 
will be on the 38th floor to answer questions Tuesday and Wednesday, June 12 
and 13.

Listed below is useful information provided to us by the Outlook Migration 
team.  

E-mail Policies

Users will be restricted to a Mailbox size of 100 MB.  

Further mailbox size restrictions are detailed as follows:

Issue Warning at 75 MB - users are automatically sent a warning from the 
System Administrator explaining they are near their Mailbox limit.

Prohibit Send at 100 MB - users are prevented from sending e-mail, yet they 
can still receive internal and external messages.  Users must reduce the size 
of their mailbox by deleting old mail, saving attachments to a local drive, 
etc. before they can send e-mail again.   

Inbound/Outbound Mail Size Limits - inbound and outbound e-mail messages will 
be limited to a size of 10MB.

Deleted Item Retention - users will be able to recover deleted items from 
their mailbox as old as 8 days.  Deleted items include e-mail messages, 
folders, contacts, calendar entries, tasks, notes, journal entries and 
meeting notices.

Archiving - archiving will not be a supported feature of Outlook 2000. 

Migration Preparation

Clean Your Mailbox - due to new space limitations on your mailbox, you are 
advised to clean your Notes mailbox of old, unneeded messages BEFORE 
migration.  If you are at the 100MB limit on the day of migration, you will 
not be able to send messages once you are in Outlook.

Limits on Items Migrated  - from the day of your migration, only 30 days of 
old mail will be migrated from your mailbox.  This includes mail in your 
inbox and other folders.  Calendar items dating back one year from the day of 
migration will be migrated (with the exception of repeating appointments).

Subject: Recording Trades from made on Mobile phones  

Cindy,

We have some good news for you.  We have set up a number which can only be 
called from Enron Mobile phones (37373), when you dial this number you will 
hear dialtone.  The dialtone is coming from the phone system at Enron House, 
you are then able to dial exactly as if you were at your desk, ie dial '9' 
and the number you wish to reach.

All calls coming through this route will be recorded and can be retrieved by 
the telecoms team for playback / reference.

We have also ensured that external people cannot dial this number from 
outside the building by using 020 7783 7373.

Let me know if you want to issue a note as a General Announcement or whether 
you wish to handle the distribution of the number.

Regards,

Andy

Instead of providing a phone number could there be a short code or something 
that they do that in the background dials this number so no one gets access 
to this number?   I know that this is an issue in all of the offices with 
traders making deals on cell phones on unrecorded lines.  I do not want to do 
something that puts Enron at risk though.  Thanks Cindy

Subject: Re: Who should I talk to on this one?

Cindy,

We can provide a telephone number in the office which the traders can call 
from their mobile phone, they would then be offered dialtone from the 
telephone system and can then dial on to an external party.

The call would then be routed out from the office and would be subject the 
the normal recording criteria.

However I wouldn't recommend this approach as we are opening up an external 
gateway for people to use our telephone system, this would be unmetered and 
not secure. The potential for toll-fraud is something that we need to take 
into account.

Regards,

Andy Cowx

If the traders do a deal from their cell phone, is there a way they can have 
that call routed back through the phones in the building so it gets done on a 
recorded line?  I know if you call someone and then dial some numbers it 
takes you to their cell phone.  Can it work backwards so they hit some 
numbers and it routes the call through the office?   This would help with 
some of our AA issues.  Thanks Cindy

I am following up on Bill's request for information related to the Southern 
Minerals bankruptcy.  I heard back today from Jan Abel, Debtor's counsel.  As 
you know, ENA has an unsecured claim for $25,334.  An objection to the claim 
was filed, but later withdrawn.  First distributions were made in this 
bankruptcy in October, but the objection to ENA's claim may still have been 
pending at that time, so that ENA would not have received a distribution.  
The next distribution will be in January  and the distributions will occur 
quarterly thereafter.  If we did not receive a distribution in October, we 
will get both our first and second distributions in January.  ENA is a Class 
V unsecured creditor, which, according to the Plan, will receive 100% of the 
principal amount of the debt paid without interest over time.

I am familiar with the Southern Mineral Corp. bankruptcy.  ENA filed a proof 
of claim for an unsecured debt in the amount of $25,334.  As far as I have 
been able to determine, no objection was filed to this proof of claim.  The 
debtors' Chapter 11 plan of reorganization was approved by the Court on July 
21, 2000.  Unsecured creditors were to receive some combination of stock and 
cash.  I have a call in to Debtors' counsel to find out when to expect 
distributions, but I have not yet heard back.  I will let you know as soon as 
I do.

I am not familiar with the Alma Energy Corp. bankruptcy.  We looked the 
matter up in the bankruptcy court computer records, which show that Alma 
Energy Corp. and an affiliated company, Equinox Oil Company, Inc. filed for 
bankruptcy in the Eastern District of Louisiana in June 1999.  The docket 
sheet reflects that a first meeting of creditors was set for August 1999.  
The only other entry in the docket sheet reflects that the bankruptcy was 
closed in December 1999.  The current telephone directory has a listing for 
Equinox Oil Company at the 10077 Grogans Mill Road address that appears in 
the bankruptcy records, but there is no current telephone listing for Alma.  
It appears that Alma has simply gone out of business.  We did place a call to 
the lawyer who was listed as Debtors' counsel in the bankruptcy to try to 
find out more.  I will let you know if I find anything further.

Lisa/Richard/Bonnie,

Please give me an update of the following bankruptcy claims.  We need to make 
a determination if we should write off these receivables but would like to 
get input from you on any potential recovery before we move forward.  On a 
broader issue, do you have any report outlining outstanding bankruptcy 
preceedings or litigation that I may get a copy of on a regular basis so we 
can more effectively manage the credit and workout related issues on the 
trading portfolio?

Please advise.

Bill

Hi Tanya and Debbie,

I was wondering if I could get an update as to the status of the following 
bankrupt companies:

Alma Energy Corp.
Kimball Trading Company
Southern Mineral Corp.

For each company, we have an outstanding receivable on our A/R.  I was 
wondering if, in each case, we expected to see some money to offset the 
receivable, or if there was a slim chance that we would receive anything in 
bankruptcy proceedings.  

Please advise.

Thank you,
Becky

I just spoke to the Judge's law clerk and she indicated the Judge was
contemplating a very short hearing, perhaps 1/2 hr, next week or the week
thereafter regarding Wright's Motion, our response and any other pleadings
that are filed regarding Wright's Motion.  I have the impression the Judge
does not want this to blossom into a hearing which everyone feels they have
to attend.  I think the Judge simply wants to make sure everyone is on the
same page regarding this deposition and that if there are any disputes he
needs to decide that those can be resolved immediately during the hearing.

I told the law clerk I would give her a heads-up if more that 1/2 hr was
needed for the hearing.

Yours very truly,

Please see the e-mail below asking for production of the models created by
Enron separate from the McDonald models.  Enron's models were, I am told,
prepared within ECM by Paul Pizzolato  based on proprietary software of Enron,
something called "RAROC," risk adjusted return on capital.  Many iterations of
these models were run, varying different elements of data.

Brian and Ray Bowen have both stated that it is unlikely that these models
were retained Brian, Tom, and Kevin each testified in their depositions about 
these models;
and the Farallon plaintiffs are now specifically asking about them.  Before we
say that these models no longer exist, I believe someone at Enron should make
an effort to look for them.  Frankly, it would probably be very helpful to
Enron's case if we could in fact find these models.  Right now our witnesses
and our expert are saying things about the models but, without the actual
models, this testimony is a bit self-serving.

Britt

I would summarise the main facts/status of this matter as follows:

(1)  Enron voyage chartered "SANTA CLARA" from Exmar N.V. by a C/P dated 
5.2.91
to carry cargo of 4,200 mt 5% more or less at owner's option of propane, from
Houston to Dunkirk.  Under the Charterparty Enron had the option to load cargo
either fully refrigerated or ambient or chilled.

(2)  On 26th February 1991 the Master advised Enron that the maximum quantity
that the cargo could load at ambient temperature was 3,760 mt having regard to
the vessel's pressure settings and the USCG and IMO Rules and Regulations. The
Master was in fact absolutely correct but Exmar tried to make out that the
vessel could load the full charterparty quantity.

(3)  It is our case that in order to load more than 3,760 mt (the cargo was
loaded at ambient temperature) Exmar refrigerated the cargo as it came on 
board
to reduce the volume.  This caused the loading to be excessively slow.  We say
this method of loading was actually illegal.  It was only by loading illegally
in this way that Exmar could load more than 3760 mt at the required pressure
setting.  We also say it was an express term of the charterparty that the 
entire
contractual cargo could be loaded within the contractual lay time.   The 
vessel
also had to raise the temperature and discharge causing further delays.

(4) There was great commerical pressure on Enron at the time.  The market for
propane was falling rapidly in March 1991 (the end of the Northern European
winter) and Enron had arranged the on sale of a minimum quantity of 3,990 mt 
on
CIF terms based on an expected loading of 1st-7th March 1991.  Enron were
extremely concerned that this would lead purchasers Vitol  to repudiate the 
sale
contract leading to a very substantial trading loss (Vitol did try to 
repudiate
the sale contract due to the loading delays and this developed into a very 
major
trading dispute with Vitol which we eventually won in the House of Lords).

(5)  Exmar made out that slow loading was due to low back pressure in his
Enterprise loading lines.  We believe this is wrong but at this distance in 
time
it is difficult to get clear evidence.

(6)  In the circumstances, on 7th March 1991to try and speed up loading Enron
agreed that the minimum cargo of 3,760 mt should be loaded and agreed to pay
Exmar deadfreight on the balance in the sum of US$22,714.84.

(7)  Furthermore, because of the slow loading of the vessel the Enterprise
Terminal had to throw "SANTA CLARA" off berth.  This would have caused a very
substantial delay and might have justified Vitol in throwing  over the sales
contract.  In the circumstances Enron negotiated an agreement with another
vessel ("DONAU") to permit "SANTA CLARA" to be loaded ahead of "DONAU".  The 
sum
paid to "DONAU" amounted to US$153,472.15.    We believe the "DONAU" was also
operated by Exmar.

(8) Accordingly, Enron deny liability for demurrage for the extended loading
which Exmar have claimed in the sum of US$165,652.78 and Enron have
counterclaimed a total of US$176,186.99 (i.e. the deadfreight and "DONAU"
payments).

Exmar are represented by London Solicitors, Lawrence Graham where the matter 
is
being handled by Mike Lax and his assistant Stuart Dench.

Lawrence Graham have always sought to charactercise this claim as a
straightforward demurrage dispute and suggest that we have invented the
technical arguments after the event.  However, we consider there is merit in 
our
case and that if the arbitrators properly understand the expert evidence we 
have
reasonable prospects of successfully defending the demurrage claim and
establishing the counterclaim.  There is of course however an inevitable
litigation risk in pursuing the matter to an arbitration and we have, to some
extent, been inconvenienced by the loss of our original expert, Mr Ivor 
Jorstad,
who sadly passed away earlier this year.   Also some costs will be 
irrecoverable
(if we win approximately two thirds of our costs should be recoverable).

If you have any further queries, please do not hesitate to ring me and I would
of course be pleased to speak to Wayne Perry when he is in London if he needs
any further information to assist in negotiations.

Best Regards.


Andrew Bicknell

Privileged and Confidential Joint Defense Communication

From:  Don Schultz
To:     All Quinque JDT Participants
Re:     Reply to Grynberg letter requesting discovery.

           Set out below is a draft letter which is being circulated among 
the Grynberg defendants for possible submission to Judge Downes.  I have not 
heard any suggestion that the Quinque defendants should weigh in on the 
subject of whether or not Grynberg should be allowed the discovery he 
requests, which seems to be a FCA subject.   There is no requirement that the 
Quinque defendants submit anything on this.  Please let me know if you think 
there is a need for the Quinque defendants to speak to this topic.  Don.




        Re:    In re Natural Gas Royalties Qui Tam Litigtion, MDL Docket No. 
1293, All Cases

Dear Judge Downes:

        The Coordinated Defendants in the Grynberg cases respond as follows 
to the Court's invitation to submit comments on discovery issues related to 
the Government's motion to dismiss portions of the Grynberg complaints:

        First, the Coordinated Defendants' silence, as a group, regarding the 
Government's motion to dismiss should not be viewed as an indication that we 
believe the Government's motion lacks merit.  The Defendants have simply been 
at a disadvantage in presenting their views because the Government's motion 
is in large measure dependent upon facts, such as the adequacy of the 
submissions Grynberg made to the Government, not known to the Defendants (due 
in part, as discussed below, to Grynberg's failure to serve the Defendants 
with materials he has submitted to the Court).

        The Coordinated Defendants remain of one mind, however, in their 
belief that all of the Grynberg complaints should be dismissed for the 
entirely separate reasons that they are improperly pled under Fed. R. Civ. 
Proc. 9(b) and fail to state a claim under Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 12(b)(6).  The 
Coordinated Defendants are also united in their belief that consideration of 
the Government's motion should not take precedence over the Coordinated 
Defendants' pending motion to dismiss.  We were thus pleased to learn at the 
status conference on December 7, 2000 and from the Court's Order Following 
Status Conference that the Court proceeding ahead with a ruling on the 
Defendants' pending motions to dismiss without regard to other pending 
matters.

        Specifically with regard to Grynberg's position on discovery, as 
outlined in Mr. Figa's letter to the Court on December 8, 2000, we feel 
compelled to point out that the Grynberg request for discovery has 
implications far beyond the narrow issues raised by the government's motion 
to dismiss.  Grynberg essentially is requesting discovery on whether he or 
Wright is the proper relator on royalty valuation claims.  See Dec. 8 letter 
at 2-3.  While Grynberg is not necessarily volunteering to open himself up to 
discovery on whether he is the original source of the information he claims 
to have given to Wright's attorneys, he is specifically asking for public 
disclosure/original source discovery from Wright, and certainly the discovery 
Grynberg is seeking may well overlap discovery on whether he himself was the 
original source.

        In light of this fact, we remind the Court that the Coordinated 
Defendants have, with the Court's concurrence, delayed seeking discovery on 
and filing their own public disclosure/original source motion until the Court 
has ruled on the pending motions to dismiss the Grynberg complaints and, if 
necessary, any subsequent constitutional challenges to the Grynberg 
complaints.  That orderly progression should not be upset by the sudden 
intrusion of the Government's motion and Grynberg's request for discovery.  
Therefore, if the Court should decide that some discovery between and among 
Grynberg, Wright and the Government is appropriate to resolve the limited 
issues raised by the Government's motion to dismiss, we respectfully request 
that the Court make it abundantly clear that such discovery will in no way 
prejudice or restrict the right of the Defendants in the Grynberg cases to 
take their own discovery at the appropriate time (and assuming these cases 
have not previously been dismissed) on the public disclosure/original source 
issues.

        Finally, we respectfully request that, whether or not the Court 
grants Grynberg's request for discovery, it enter an order directing that any 
information produced in discovery or submitted to the Court in this case be 
provided to all parties alike.  This requirement is so fundamental that it 
ordinarily does not require an order of the Court to implement.  However, 
Grynberg has already submitted to this Court under seal documents that he 
claims support his position on the Government's motion to dismiss, and he has 
requested that the Clerk not make those documents available to the 
Defendants.  Absent direction to the contrary from the Court, the Clerk has 
thus far complied with Grynberg's request and denied the Defendants access to 
those documents.  This submission of documents to the Court by Mr. Gynberg is 
a clear violation of Fed. R. Civ. P. 5(a), which requires that all filings, 
with the limited exception of motions that the movant specifically requests 
be heard ex parte, be served on all parties.  If Grynberg truly has a 
legitimate reason for asking that the documents be placed under seal (such as 
that they contain proprietary information), the Defendants will happy to 
agree to an appropriate protective order restricting access to those 
documents.  But in no event should the Defendants be denied any access 
whatsoever to documents relevant to these cases.

        The Coordinated Defendants appreciate this opportunity to present 
these views to the Court.

                        Respectfully submitted,

You will have received notice of service of process in the above-referenced 
case today.  This is a slip and fall case filed against San Juan Gas.  The 
Risk Management group already has a file on this matter, as the plaintiff had 
previously filed a demand.  Upon investigation, Risk Management determined 
that the plaintiff's alleged accident occurred at a facility that is NOT 
owned by San Juan Gas, and, thus, denied the claim.  The matter will be 
handled as a Risk Management matter, and Dave Grant will manage the 
activities of outside counsel.  If you need any further information on this 
matter, please contact Dave.

Dear all,

Please find herewith a recap of my observations relating to Mitsubishi's 
demurrage claim, which does not take the outcome of the liability question 
i.c.w. the rejection of the cargo by receivers at Batangas into account:

1. Claim is time barred (ECTS clause 43)
Owners/owners' brokers did not return signed original of charterparty within 
90 days from completion of discharge ("cod"), notwithstanding that the 
original and duplicate were sent to them on 16.08.00, which is 21 days after 
cod (case law: Commercial Court 1999 - "Obo Venture").  

2. Start laytime at Elang (ECTS clauses 1(e) and 10)
Notice of Readiness ("NOR") shall not be tendered before 06h00 on first day 
of laydays.  In addition, Enron is entitled to a complete 6 hours notice 
time, as the notice-time entitlement is unqualified (contrary to clause 6 of 
the Asbatankvoy C/P).  Deduction: 5h 59m.

3. Slow loading Elang (ECTS clause 11(b))
Shore lodged Letter of Protest stating that Terminal loading rate is 
4200m3/hr and vessel was unable to load at a rate greater than 3600m3/hr.  
However, we do not know what the max. receiving rate of the vessel is.  
Moreover, vessel has 3 manifolds and shore only connected 1x 16" arm.

4. Start laytime at Koh Sichang (ECTS clauses 1(e) and 10)
As per point 2 above.  Deduction: 3h 39m.

5. Excess pumping time at Koh Sichang (ECTS clause 16)
Vessel neither discharged this part cargo in 15h 58m (based on 24 hours for 
entire cargo as warranted) nor did she maintain a pressure of 100psi at 
manifold.  The vessel discharged this part of cargo in 36h 5m.  However, 
shore had imposed pressure and rate restrictions on vessel.  Taking these 
restrictions into consideration, the vessel in breach of owners' pumping 
warranty used 8h 32m in excess of what she should have used.  Deduction: 8h 
32m.

6. Bad weather related port closure at Batangas (ECTS clause 10(h) and 10(f))
Agents reported that all terminals in Batangas were closed for berthing due 
high winds during the first 112.5h (from arrival on 04.07.00 to 08.07.00).  
According to clause 10(h), the delay in berthing resulting from weather 
conditions counts at one-half of such time.  Deduction: 53h 15m (=(112.5h - 
6h)/2).  In the alternative, we may be able to fully deduct the 112.5h delay 
pursuant to clause 10(f), if there is a local law or regulation we can rely 
on to except this delay (Eric Tan has requested a copy of the port 
regulations).

7. Start laytime at Yosu (clause 6 of Asbatankvoy C/P)
a) NOR was allegedly tendered on 23.07.00 at 19h00.  However, NOR attached to 
claim shows that it was received on 25.07.00 at 12h45 (when vessel all fast 
in berth).  Moreover, the NOR is dated 25.07.00.  As per clause 6 laytime 
shall only start 6 hours after receipt of notice by charterers/their agents.  
I do not believe that Enron Spore received an NOR by telex.  They only 
received a telex from their nominated agents (Samsun) on 24.07.00 at 08h40 
with the vessel's arrival times including the EOSP and NOR tendered time 
(23.07.00 at 18h42).  
b) Alternatively, vessel anchored at waiting place on 23.07.00 at 20h15, but 
tendered NOR at EOSP (18h42) or on arrival pilot station (19h00).  As per 
clause 6 the NOR has to be tendered on arrival at customary anchorage.  As a 
result, the NOR tendered by master was given prematurely and at the wrong 
place.  This renders the NOR invalid.  As the master did not retender a fresh 
NOR when the vessel arrived at customary anchorage, laytime shall not 
commence, if at all, until the commencement of discharge (case law: High 
Court 1997 - "Agamemnon").

8. Excess pumping time at Yosu (ECTS clause 16)
Vessel neither discharged this part cargo in 9h 2m (based on 24 hours for 
entire cargo) nor did she maintain the max. allowable shore pressure of 
4.9kg/cm2 (= less than 100psi) at manifold.  The vessel discharged this part 
of cargo in 11h 15m.  Deduction: 2h 13m.

Please let me know, if you have any questions.

B regards,
Wietze.

wietze,

sorry to come back to you on this matter but appreciate your input once again.

from your msg of 17 nov, seems worse case is we owe about $222,652.78 but 
could be better. would appreciate if you could put together a "recap" of the 
various positions for britt/david, including possibiliy of the time bar 
whereby it could be zero, so they can determine best position.

if, as you say, we may have a strong arguement at the time bar, my suggestion 
would be that david discuss this possibility with mitsubishi's lawyers to try 
to determine a reaction, if possible, to that position. we can always agree 
to pay a lower amount later.

as usual, thanks to copy us on whatever is sent so we have a copy for the 
files. also, thanks again for your help.

best regards

Mitsubishi has just agreed to have Mr. Hamblen, one of the arbitrators that 
we proposed, appointed in this matter.  David Best will follow up with Mr. 
Hamblen with this.  

David will also go forward with negotiating the without-prejudice payment of 
Mitsubishi's freight and demurrage claim (the latter payment being based on 
what our demurrage department thinks it is really worth--Paul, I need to get 
with you on this), as I had previously authorized him to do.

Mitsubishi has been advised of the shelf-life issue and is being pressed by 
its solicitors for a reply to our suggestion that the joint survey take place 
in the U.K.  Mitsubishi advises their solicitors that they will revert as 
soon as possible regarding this. 

I will continue to keep you advised.

Britt

Jeff, Bill,

Per your request, attached is a spreadsheet which details counterparty 
exposure in the West region.  The spreadsheet contains several tabs which 
detail each the Physical MTM and Financial MTM exposure.  Please be sure you 
are looking at the correct spreadsheets.  Also, these exposure amounts do not 
reflect the overall exposure with each counterparty, just the exposure for 
the West region.

Thanks
Russell

 Alvin Suggs, one of the El Paso Energy attorneys who is working on the A-S 
Line incident from last week, just told me that he called Richard Sanders 
last week (pursuant to Barbara Gray's suggestion)  about how to allow Enron 
people to be involved in the investigation without waiving the 
attorney-client privilege.  Alvin said they want to cooperate fully but need 
to be sure that El Paso and Enron aren't  disadvantaged from a privilege 
standpoint.   I have left a phone message with Richard Sanders asking him to 
call me.
 Richard, feel free to call Dave Johnson (Ext 67885) directly to discuss this 
with him.

		 Subject: AB 81 passes fiscal cmte

In a hearing off the Floor this afternoon, the Assembly Appropriations 
Committee voted on a partisan basis (14-7) to pass AB 81 (Migden), which 
would make power plants state-assessed.  Please note that two amendments were 
adopted by the author:  (1) allocate property tax revenues derivbed from 
state-assessed property according to the same formula used by county 
assessors "in order to hold local agencies harmless."  (2) Exempt 
qualififying facilities from the bill "because QFs have never been subject to 
state assessment."  The bill will be on the Floor for Thursday morning's 
session.

Tanya,

This will confirm that you and my other clients have decided to go forward 
with initiating arbitration in the above-referenced matter, despite the 
up-front costs, and are comfortable with your own assessment of the risks of 
Triad having no executable assets, as well your own view that from a policy 
basis, this matter needs to go forward to make sure that other traders don't 
try the same thing.

I will prepare an arbitration demand and submit it for the review of anyone 
who needs to see it before it goes out.  It will be very short.  Please let 
me know who (if anyone) would like to see a draft first.

Britt

I have received a telefax from Scottsborough, our good customer, which 
attaches the lawsuit filed by the trucker against it and ICTS, in Alabama 
state court.  The complaint prays for recovery of about $15,000, plus 
interest and attorneys' fees.  I was not sent the service papers, which would 
allow me to confirm Scottsborough's advice that its "return date" is December 
16 (a Saturday, so it can't be right).  I was not sent any documents that 
would allow me to confirm Scottsborough's representation that all the loads 
(which were allegedly shipped from 4/10-5/23/00) were purchased from MG 
Metals, freight prepaid.

I am sending a follow-up letter to Scottsborough asking for specific 
additional documentation, including the service papers; you will be 
blind-copied on the letter.  I will also have Becky, my legal assistant, (a) 
call the Court to see if process has been issued against ICTS and whether it 
has been served and (b) check on Pacer, the federal bankruptcy database, to 
see if ICTS has filed for bankruptcy.

Meanwhile, I wonder if Nicole could advise me of/send me the following:

1. a copy of the MG Metals/Scottsborough master agreement, if there is one,

You and I spoke about this in October and concluded that we'd revisit the 
document after the legal summit but prior to the end of the year.  I'm 
attaching a redline version of the document Hugh Lennox sent to Carl in 
October.  Let me know when you have time to discuss the document this week 
and I'll make the arrangements.

Larry and I spoke for ten minutes earlier this afternoon.  The subpoenas
have been authorized for the five generators plus Enron.  They will be
identical to the request of April 5.  They will issue in "a couple of days."
I declined to accept service for Duke, but requested a copy by fax (which he
will provide).  The subpoena provides 15 days for response.

Regarding protective order, Larry "hates to say there is no flexibility," bu
there is "not much."  Disclosure to the Attorney General is just one of a
number of issues.  It is very unlikely that we could negotiate from the
draft order we provided to the Committee.  He suggested that we revisit the
form of "agreement" he offered a month ago, but I told him that Duke
individually (and, I believed, others as well) had rejected that notion.  I
also deflected his suggestion that we revisit the notion of a "Sacramento
depository."

I then inquired whether they are stil interested in working our way through
the paragraphs of the subpoena.  I suggested that knowing what the Committee
wants might be useful in addressing protective order issues with a court.
Larry responded that he had anticipated doing that on May 3, but time did
not permit.  He thinks we should see whether we can put requests into three
piles: "yes," "no" and "lets fight."  I told him that some might be
legitimately pessimistic, given the fact that the Committee reneged on its
commitments regarding a protective order, but that I would pass the
information on.

I think we need a further conference call.  We should decide whether to
avail ourselves of the opportunity to discuss the subjects first before we
address confidentiality.  Please check the circulation list on this email,
and forward as you think appropriate.

I do not have a copy of the WFW invoice.  I have requested same from Angeline 
and she indicated she would be forwarding to it to me.  I will forward on to

Linda,

Could you send the WFW bill down to me please?  I just changed admin 
assistants and my new a/a, Lee, could not find that in the file.  Richard 
wanted me to take a look and try to apportion it between his r/c and Alan's, 
given my statement to Richard that the WFW bill contains a lot of time that I 
(and I believe Matt shares this belief) was directed to resolution of the 
dispute with FGH.  

Britt

P.S. to Matt-- what do you think about asking Neale if he would take a look 
at that bill and apportion the time spent between the cargo claim versus the 
FGH matter?

Hi Linda

I have just faxed to you the statement that reflects the various items

apologies for any inconvenience caused.

Hi Angeline --

I received your fax this date regarding the WFW pacific virgo invoice.  What 
I am looking for is  a copy of the back-up to the statement you sent.  In 
other words, I need a breakdown of the time billed by each attorney working 
on this matter.   All I have is the one page listing $137,455.18 -- what does 
this consist of?  Please forward this to me so I can arrange for payment of 
this invoice.  Thanks.

 As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More

britt,

will not be able to discuss your question about eric tan with commercial 
people until monday as john chismar is traveling right now. however, 
hopefully the testing will answer a lot of questions such that we may not 
need his services after year end.

Subject: In re M/V PACIFIC VIRGO

 I am pleased to report that Mitsubishi has agreed to have the joint analysis 
take place in the U.K.  We have instructed our chemist to immediately arrange 
for this.  We still await Mitsubishi's response to our request that they 
share the costs of transportation from Singapore to the U.K.   

 Paul, given that Eric Tan is apparently leaving very soon, would you let me 
know whether (a) he still needs to be kept in the loop on this and (b) 
whether some other business person in Singapore will be the liaison person? 

 David Best will shortly confirm the appointment of the arbitrator.  Once 
that is done, he will approach Mitsubishi's solicitors regarding the 
without-prejudice payment of freight and demurrage.  David has indicated that 
he likes the time bar argument against Mitsubishi's demurrage claim and that 
before offering to negotiate the demurrage claim at all, he will ask 
Mitsubishi's solicitors how they would get around that problem, and see what 
they say.

 I will keep you advised.

 Britt

Just a reminder that you were going to fax or email me a copy of the letter 
or letters exchanged with the Atty General's office re retaining documents. I 
need to see that before drafting and circulating any proposed response to Sen 
Dunn's Committee on the same subject. Thanks

Bonnie, please forward to Jim Studdert in the customary manner.  He will most 
likely assign the matter to me, but it needs to go to him direct...thanks,

Subject: Roger Atkinson v. Cogen, et al.; Roger Atkinson v. JEDI Linden and 
NEPCO.

This morning I received a copy of service of process that was served on Cogen 
Technologies Linden Venture in the Roger Atkinson matter.  Cogen Technologies 
Linden Venture had previously been served with a summons and complaint in the 
Atkinson matter in mid April.  I forwarded the matter to El Paso Energy 
Company, who had purchased ENA's interest in the Cogen companies effective 
late February 2001.  El Paso retained Ed Fanning of McCarter & English to 
represent Cogen's interests.  We have worked with Ed in other Cogen matters 
before, and I have found him to be both effective and efficient.  This matter 
relates to personal injuries allegedly suffered by Atkinson while working at 
a construction site at the Linden facility in December 2000.  David Waterson 
of El Paso recently called me concerning potential defense and indemnity 
obligations that El Paso believes NEPCO may owe Cogen with respect to this 
incident.  We will need to review NEPCO's contract with Cogen to determine if 
any such obligations exist.

The document that I received today is a Notice of Motion to Consolidate and 
to Compel Inspection.  This motion seeks to consolidate the Atkinson v. Cogen 
case with a case that was apparently also filed in New Jersey state court as 
Roger Atkinson v. JEDI Linden and NEPCO and to compel an inspection of the 
construction site where the accident allegedly occurred.  I have asked Becky 
Stephens whether we have received service of process on either JEDI Linden or 
NEPCO.  To date, we have not.  However, I expect that service of process is 
in the works, and I have asked Becky to be on the look out for it.  As this 
new suit also apparently concerns personal injury claims, I am forwarding a 
copy to both Rob and Bob, so that you can begin to process and investigate 
the claim in your usual manner. 

Please let me know if there is any other information you need in order to 
begin our review for potential defense/indemnity to Cogen.  Thanks.

Privileged and Confidential Joint Defense Communication

To:  Grynberg JDT
From:  Don Schultz

             Attached is the final version of the letter I am now sending to 
Judge Downes on the subject of Gene Wright's deposition.   I added some text 
along the lines of Gerry Pecht's suggestions in yesterday's phone conference, 
and with his input this afternoon.  I did this so the letter better fits with 
the editing done by the Wright Defendants in the last 24 hours on their 
submission.
           I believe this final version is consistent with the views you have 
all expressed to me.  Please let me know if you see anything problematic.  
(There was not enough time available, after I could review the latest changes 
in the Wright Defendants' brief, to circulate another draft of this letter.  
And, the changes did not seem to warrant asking the Court to extend the time 
for filing this.)  Thanks for your cooperation.  Don.
