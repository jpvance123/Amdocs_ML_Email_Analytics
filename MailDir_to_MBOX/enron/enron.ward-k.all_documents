Gentlemen:
In an earlier communication, I had asked Gelber to forward a summary
spreadsheet of Citizens' forward purchases position monthly before the 10th
of the following month.  To avert potential problems, I would request,
instead, that the summary spreadsheet be sent out on or before the last
trading day of the current month. Kindly copy Chris Foster at Enron on these
transmissions.  Please call if you have any questions.  Thanks.

This note is in reference to our phone conversation  earlier today.? As a 
result of that conversation the following actions will  be taken:

Gelber will add to its deal tracking spreadsheet  a?column for Enron's 
transaction number and make sure the field is  maintained for all Enron 
transactions;
A copy of the deal tracking spreadsheet for  January 2001 will be sent to 
Enron;
Linking of Basis transactions with NYMEX  transactions will be done as 
follows for any particular transaction  month:

??? If fixed Basis volumes are less  than fixed NYMEX??volumes, Gelber will 
link Basis volumes to  an?equivalent?volume of fixed NYMEX gas;
??? If fixed Basis volumes  are?greater than fixed NYMEX volumes, all NYMEX 
transactions will be  linked to one or more?Basis transactions and the 
balance of Basis volumes  will be assumed to be linked to Index gas?
??? If there are no fixed NYMEX  transactions, any Basis transactions will be 
assumed linked to Index  gas.

Please contact me if any of this is unclear or you  have?issues.? Thanks.?

Kim Ward in Houston x3-0685 is taking over management of this account.  My 
understanding of the new deal is that the fixed price deal expires 12/31 and  
Kim has renegotiated the arrangment at index + .05/MMBtu.  Please contact her 
to confirm.

Chris,
I am back to this issue.  I have been told that the way we can fix the a/r 
issues is to change the way the deal is entered in sitara.  I wanted to make 
sure you agree with the change.  The way the deal is entered now is 
1,125 daily  and the rest at the NGI index.
The days that Akzo takes less than the 1,125 the volumes allocation changes.  
Making the system want to charge them more since it adds more volumes to the 
NGI price.

I was wondering if we can change the deal to:
1,125 * #of days in month @ $2.6676
remaning volume  @ $NGI index.
This way it reflex the way ENA has invoice Akzo(since Akzo takes the require 
1,125 on a monthly basis.

Please e-mail me back letting me know if this change agrees with how you 
wanted Akzo to be invoice and that will reflex how Akzo has been invoice.
thanks

Subject: akzo

Good morning Chris,
I have a question on Akzo's invoicing.  Since we invoice Akzo manually I am 
trying to reconcile the system with what we have invoice Akzo.
The way we are invoicing them is that we assume that they take the 1125 mmbtu 
daily.  However, there is one or two days of each month(almost) that they 
take less than the 1125/day.  That changes the numbers.  As it looks I may 
have to go back and do PMA invoices to invoice them balance.  I wanted to 
speak with you on this before I actually do anything.  Here is an example:

August manual invoice:
34,875 @ 2.6676 =  $93,032.55
24,520 @ 4.4775 =  $109,790.09
Total        $202,822.64


System Invoice:
34,633  @  2.6676  = $92,386.99
24,762  @   4.4775=   $110,871.86
Total          $203,258.85

Difference         $436.21
The reason to the difference in volume is that on 8/8 only 883 mmtu flowed. 

The balance is not a big one but it is over my limit to overwrite. 
My questions is do you want me to go back and send Akzo PMA invoices???
Give me a call if you need to speak to me about this.
thanks
isabel

John:

Space on EP to Nogales out of Permian Keystone or Waha is not available.  It 
might become available in early Feb. We can watch it and look for a good day 
to do this.  If it absolutely needs to happen in Jan we might be able to do a 
flow day diversion from the SoCal border but that will add a significant 
amount to the price as it would cost SoCAl Border plus.  Can we wait?

Thank both of you for stopping by to visit last Friday.  It was good to see 
you.
I hope Enron can get some of their "creative juices" going and figure out a 
way
that the City of Mesa can compliment their gas contract with their electric
needs.   I think there are some opportunities out there.

Kim, two things.  One regarding capacity releasing:  our billing determinant 
is
14,247 and we can release the difference of this number and what our load will
be.  Sorry, I just had to think about it after the meeting.  Also, regarding
this matter, one must consider the conditions of pre-arranged deals.  There 
are
some hurdles, but all "doable" once we get our thinking caps on.

Two, I did not realize that you were on the electric side for awhile.  I am in
somewhat of a "learning mode" regarding electric and was wondering if you 
could
just "jam" with me about the electric side.  I understand the concepts because
of my position on the gas side, but I want to learn the players and some
strategies.  Dave, I think you could teach me a thing or two also.

Let me know.

Jan

We'd like to thank you for puttting together this offer for bundled supply to
our Griffith facility.  We are very agreeable to the structure and general
framework that you have laid out.  We did make a few modifications however and
you can find them in the attached redlined version of your proposal.  We will

Listed below are dates and actions required to finish the year-end PRC 
process.  Please make a note of these dates and perform any required 
actions.  If you have questions, please contact me.

December 15:  All PRC meetings and ratings will be finalized for Sr. Director 
and below positions.
January 25:  Performance reviews must be completed by this date.  All 
performance review information, including bonus payment and salary increase, 
must be communicated to employees.
February 5:  Bonus payment made to eligible employees.

Since we have many new employees, I thought I would provide the following 
information and philosophy about our performance review system.  Enron is 
very proud of its employees and is known for hiring the most talented people 
available in the marketplace.  I believe that is true in West Power Trading.  
The challenge for managers is to provide valuable feedback, and the most 
accurate rating, to employees so they can enhance their performance and 
progress in their current roles and within the company.

There are basically two objectives to our performance review system.

Career Development/Feedback on Performance:  This part of our performance 
review system includes the meetings and discussions surrounding the following 
four documents that are in each review package:  Goals, Expectations, 
Accomplishments, Feedback.  Employees prepare a listing of their Goals to 
accomplish by the next review period and a list of their Accomplishments 
since the previous review period.  Managers prepare Feedback and prepare a 
list of Expectations during the next review period.  These documents are the 
cornerstone for constructive two-way feedback during a performance review.

Performance Rating:  Enron uses a merit-based approach to determine 
promotions, raises, and bonuses.  This is accomplished in the PRC 
(Performance Review Committee) meetings.  In these meetings, the ENA 
management team assigns a performance rating to each employee.  We attempt to 
make this process as fair and objective as possible.  For West Power Trading 
employees, each person's performance is assessed relative to responsibilities 
defined in the "Expectations" document.  Performance is also gauged relative 
to your peers throughout ENA--Portland, Houston, and Calgary.  Each person's 
manager had tremendous input into this process.  I personally represented 
each person in our group in the final ENA PRC meeting in Houston.  I feel 
confident the process was fair and that the tremendous achievements of our 
office were acknowledged.

The following is a review of the various rating categories.

NEEDS IMPROVEMENT:  Does not meet most expectations.  Demonstrates some of 
the criteria.  Further development needed in most areas.

SATISFACTORY:  Meets many but not all expectations.  Demonstrates most of the 
criteria.  Further development needed in many areas.

STRONG:  Meets most and exceeds some expectations.  Role model for some of 
the criteria.  Further development needed in some areas.

EXCELLENT:  Exceeds most expectations.  Role model for most criteria.  
Further development needs are minimal.

SUPERIOR:  Consistently goes above and beyond expectations.  Role model for 
criteria.  Very little need for growth and change at current level.

My commitment to you is that by January 25, you will receive your 
career/development feedback and your performance rating.  Hopefully this 
information aids you in understanding the PRC review system.  If you have any 
questions about the process, please see your manager or me.  Also, Amy 
FitzPatrick would be happy to answer any questions you have or provide 
assistance with the PRC Process.

Kim
Talked to SSCC today regarding natural gas contracts for  CA.? 
Wanted a summary from Enron on pricing you could provide  for
1) Month to month deal for all facilities
2)? One year term deal for all facilities less LA Vernon  and month-month for 
LA Vernon.
3) One year for all facilities.
I know that the box plants are benefiting from LA Vernon on  the Index 
deal.?Too many variables still exist to lock into long term Index  deal for 
LA Vernon.? Can you price them separately?

Chris, Frank

Below the notes on the Phelps Dodge meeting of last week. Chris, I would like 
to discuss later today if possible. Frank, thanks for your input. You will be 
glad to hear that nothing much has changed there. If I didn't think PD was 
such a strong take-over candidate, I would be shorting their stock massively.

--CM


The meeting with Phelps Dodge to further discuss their energy/metals 
situation accomplished little. During the course of a 2 1/2 hour meeting with 
Bill Brack (Head of Engineering, and therefore of energy 
management/procurement) and Tim Summers plus Mike McElrath (two of his Energy 
Managers) the following points were covered:

PD will build two new power plants, one in cooperation with Duke and the 
other with BP Amoco. Both to be located in AZ, NM. Coal fired, ca 300 MW, gas 
fired ca 250 MW. They will enter long term contracts for power off-take from 
these power plants to meet their needs. Discussions with potential partners 
have been on-going since last summer. PD sees investment in power plants as 
the only answer to the power crunch. Gas has not yet been sourced. Enron not 
consulted back then due to our non-asset strategy. Details deliberately vague 
on their side.
PD's energy group is unable to discuss any transaction structures which 
involve copper plays. We have probed this to death, and Summers finally 
admitted that their board will not tolerate any suggestions that copper 
upside be "sacrificed" to secure lower/stable priced power. The clear problem 
they are experiencing--that energy price relative to copper price is killing 
them--is being addressed as an energy price problem only. There is interest 
but no mandate within PD's energy group to attempt to address the spread 
issue. 
Medium and long term energy risk management is limited to physical solutions. 
Financial and cross commodity solutions "would never be approved by the 
board".
PD continues to search for "5's and low 6's" on baseload power in a market 
showing 7's and 8's. They remain 100 MW short, which is driving their 
decision to curtail production. We put 5 year indicative low 6's on the table 
through a combination of clipped profiles and calls on copper (at 90 cts/lb) 
but the copper element in the structure sent them running.
After Brack left the room, Summers admitted that the energy group has done no 
deals directly with ENA since Enron almost won the beauty contest to be their 
energy partner two years ago, but included power procurement as an area of 
value add in our presentation to their board, against the wishes of their 
energy team. This clearly rubbed the energy guys the wrong way, and they 
haven't forgotten it--too close to home, clearly.  I can only conclude that 
PD's board would be in a much better position today had they taken Enron's 
advice then. 
A bit of insight (Frank, you'll enjoy this)--PD claims Enron offered "their 
ideas, sold back to them" and "no upside" in our final energy partner 
proposal to them two years ago. When I asked how their counter-proposal to 
Enron back then (identified projects first put to tender--if Enron is low 
bidder, Enron wins project) differed from free consulting, they had no answer.

Summary:
It is clear how PD got into their current energy fix. By admission of the 
energy group, nothing much has changed in the last few years there, either in 
terms of personnel or in terms of mandate. This, despite the fact that the 
viability of a number of PD facilities is in doubt due to energy 
mismanagement. Without top-down involvement, we will get no further with 
their energy team.

We are currently finalising the energy-copper structure we discussed during 
the meeting as I think it is the best option for them. I will also work 
further with Foster in Portland to give them the straight commodity offer. 
Perhaps this can serve as a focal point for future higher level discussions 
outside the sphere of PD's energy group. Joe/Michael-- I will make sure you 
get this, as Kalidas may yet have a role to play. It is unfortunate that the 
approach PD uses to manage their copper position seems much more 
sophisticated than their approach to energy. Results notwithstanding, the 
meeting was surprisingly open and candid on their part--no harm done to the 
metals part of the business.

Attached find quick-look results of our site analysis. Toured the Sierrita 
mine, no easy indication it will be closed end of this month. Personnel 
tight-lipped, though their head of environmental affairs lost little time in 
asking for a job. I have asked Bucky to keep you informed of developments in 
West Coast power, as I suspect their decision on facility closure (at least 
Sierrita) will be determined by power price developments between now and end 
March.

Kim,
 I have reviewed your term sheet and have the following questions.  
1.  Under Term, you have included the phrase "with annual redetermination" 
however I find no redetermination language in the Price  section.  I would 
suggest that the phrase be deleted.
2.  Under Quantity, you indicate there expected volumes, however, we need to 
put some cap on the maximum, With a 5 year term, we should offer some maximum 
such as 200% of the expected volumes.  Any thoughts relating to a cap?
3.  Under Price you indicate that the price could be changed to a Fixed 
Price, I assume that you do not intend to include the Transwestern 
transportation charges as a part of the Fixed Price.  Is this correct?  and 
if so, does the Fixed Price language need to be qualified?  
 Otherwise, the term sheet appears okay.  
      Dan

Dan,

Attached is a term sheet that has been sent to Eastern New Mexico gas company 
to extend a four year deal that ends on April 30, 2001.  Could you look into 
the confirmation for this transaction?  They will be going to the board for 
approval at the end of next week so you have some time.  Sorry to bombard 
you!!  This one should be easy.

Thanks,

Kim

I was thrilled to hear from you today.

I sure miss you and Robin.  Seems strange not to be driving to your house
on Thursdays now.  I have a little more free time now so I can quilt and
visit with my grandchildren.

Mel is back to work now and maybe things will be getting back to some
what of a normal life for us.  The past year and half has been hard on
us. I know we just have to be patient and things will get better.  You
just go along with life and then when you or your spouse has health
problems it creates a whole new ball game.  I have great faith in the
Lord to see us through any thing.  Mel said to say hi too. ( he just came
up to my office)

When you get an address please email me that so when I finish your quilt
I can mail it to you.

Hope you find a nice man and your life becomes so full that
maybe work will take a back seat.  Maybe a  big house you can fill with
kids?????

Take care of yourself and let me hear from you again.

Love, Kathy

Genia - These documents are FINE with me and they conform to Ed's Credit 
Worksheet. As far as I am concerned they are ready to be sent out. 

I did see Ed's email though and I have tried to call him to ask if he wants a 
Unilateral MAC to apply to Enron as well (the language is in there for the 
CP.) Can you please get an answer from him on this?

If for some reason Ed wants a unilateral MAC to apply to Enron too- just put 
it in where it needs to go and send the doc's out. The doc's need to go to 
Dave Hutchens who is the trader at TECP.  His email address is 
dhutchens@tucsonelectric.com.  His number is 520-745-7118. He is a client of 
our marketer - Kim Ward. Please mention her name in the email as well as mine.

I can be reached today on (503) 464-8814.

Thanks!

Kim,
 The gas portion of the RFP does not appear to be of concern assuming we are 
willing to handle the swing in their requirements.  The RFP does require that 
we attach our contract form, which I think should be the contract draft we 
are currently negotiating together with a completed form of Transaction 
Agreement for the RFP response.  Do you agree?  I am still waiting for a 
response from the City Attorney regarding his requested changes and our 
response as to each of his points.  I called Christian Yoder for a download 
of his conversation with the City Attorney last Friday but I have yet to hear 
from Christian.  At this point I think that we need to include language in 
the RFP response that our bid is based on them executing the contract as 
attached.

Just to let you know, sort of a "heads up", that I have also invited Dave 
Plumb
to the meeting this Friday.  I hope you can understand that I must follow
protocol here.  I suspect out past unsuccessful negotiations may be a topic of
discussion for him, however, I do not know this for a fact.

I told him you two were in the Valley making your Spring customer calls and 
Mesa
was slated for approximately 10:30 a.m. until noon+(?) with lunch included.  I
thought we would go up the street to Rigatony's.  Sound good??

Dave, this might be an opportunity for you to ask any questions regarding the
electric RFP.  I don't know the results or if they have even made a decision
yet.

Hopefully we can talk about where we have been, where we are now, and what the
future looks like.  Also the possibilities and potential for continued 
business.

Looking forward to seeing and visiting with both of you this Friday.

Jan

I agree with the way you wnat to change the deal in the system (i.e. making 
the 1125 MMBtu * # of days/month the first gas through the meter on a monthly 
basis rather than a daily basis) is the correct way to do it.  That is what 
the client expects and it will be difficult to get money out of them based on 
the other way.  Kim might want to contact the client if she wants to use the 
daily approach for future business.

Chris,
I am back to this issue.  I have been told that the way we can fix the a/r 
issues is to change the way the deal is entered in sitara.  I wanted to make 
sure you agree with the change.  The way the deal is entered now is 
1,125 daily  and the rest at the NGI index.
The days that Akzo takes less than the 1,125 the volumes allocation changes.  
Making the system want to charge them more since it adds more volumes to the 
NGI price.

I was wondering if we can change the deal to:
1,125 * #of days in month @ $2.6676
remaning volume  @ $NGI index.
This way it reflex the way ENA has invoice Akzo(since Akzo takes the require 
1,125 on a monthly basis.

Please e-mail me back letting me know if this change agrees with how you 
wanted Akzo to be invoice and that will reflex how Akzo has been invoice.
thanks

Subject: akzo

Good morning Chris,
I have a question on Akzo's invoicing.  Since we invoice Akzo manually I am 
trying to reconcile the system with what we have invoice Akzo.
The way we are invoicing them is that we assume that they take the 1125 mmbtu 
daily.  However, there is one or two days of each month(almost) that they 
take less than the 1125/day.  That changes the numbers.  As it looks I may 
have to go back and do PMA invoices to invoice them balance.  I wanted to 
speak with you on this before I actually do anything.  Here is an example:

August manual invoice:
34,875 @ 2.6676 =  $93,032.55
24,520 @ 4.4775 =  $109,790.09
Total        $202,822.64


System Invoice:
34,633  @  2.6676  = $92,386.99
24,762  @   4.4775=   $110,871.86
Total          $203,258.85

Difference         $436.21
The reason to the difference in volume is that on 8/8 only 883 mmtu flowed. 

The balance is not a big one but it is over my limit to overwrite. 
My questions is do you want me to go back and send Akzo PMA invoices???
Give me a call if you need to speak to me about this.
thanks
isabel

I had a good "clear the air" talk with Art yesterday.  We came up with a 
couple things that will improve the process. 

1.  Citizens needs to subscribe to EOL so that Art can execute trades without 
calling me or anyone else at Enron.  This will improve execution.  Sean, 
please make this a priority.  Call the 800 number and make it happen.  Call 
me if you need help.

2.      Kim Ward will be the point person for gettting NYMEX and Basis 
quotes.  Kim's number is 713/853-0685.  I will be helping Kim, but she is in 
a better position to execute trades as she is on the desk.

3.  Citizens should consider getting swap contracts in place with 
counterparties other than Enron (and Enron as well) so that you can do fixed 
price deals with others in the event that you can obtain more attractive 
pricing than what Enron is offering at any point in time.

Please let me know if you want further follow-up re: your e-mail below.  
Also, please push forward on the 2 contracts (gas contract amendedment and 
power contract master).

Thanks

Subject: NYMEX fixed prices obtained from Enron

Sean,
?
As we discussed on  the telephone today, I have a concern surrounding the 
pricing Enron gave  us?while establishing NYMEX fixed pricing for the months 
of April 2001, May  2001, June 2001, July 2001 and August 2001.
?
Today, we first  contacted Enron to obtain market quotes at 10:58 am cst.? In 
every month we  requested a quote on NYMEX, Enron gave a quote that was no 
less than two cents  higher than the offer on the floor of the NYMEX.? Gelber 
questioned the  quotes as being outside the market.? Gelber chose to end the 
telephone call  after questioning the quotes.? At 11:08 am, Gelber called 
Enron  again.? The election was made to proceed with execution of the 
necessary  positions.? For the months of April, May, June, and August we 
received  prices that were at the offer side of the NYMEX bid/offer spread.? 
However,  on the month of July the price received was not only outside of the 
then current  NYMEX bid/offer range but was indeed higher than the NYMEX high 
for the day on  the July contract.? Specifically, the Citizen's Arizona Gas 
price received  for July 2001 from Enron is $5.340, the high for the day on 
NYMEX was  $5.290.
?
I do not currently  feel comfortable with Enron's pricing methods.? My 
assessment after today's  transactions is only partially favorable.? It is my 
understanding that  Citizen's compensates Enron in other parts of your 
business relationship and  their should be no need for them to mark prices up 
when executing either NYMEX,  basis, or a combination of the two.
?
Citizen's may want  to consider pursuing alternative mechanism's?for securing 
fixed pricing via  other accessible markets.
?
Sincerely,
?

Dear Tom and Ron, 

Attached please find the revised EEI Cover Sheet which hopefully captures all 
the modifications agreed between SMUD and Enron. I have blacklined in all the 
modifications for ease of reference.  Please let me know if I have overlooked 
something. 

The Amendment Agreement for the ISDA should be coming shortly from my

Please let me know if you have any comments to the EEI.

Lynn,

Attached is a gas proposal that was submitted to  John Ewing at Smurfit
Stone Container Corporation on January 17, 2001 by  Chris Foster.? This is
an index proposal with the assumption that Enron  and Smurfit would
regularly enter into forward fixed price transactions to  hedge Smurfit's
cash flows.? Enron would be actively assisting Smurfit  Stone in making
forward price decisions by providing insight into market  fundamentals.

I can provide fixed price indicators if you need.?  Give me a call with your
questions.

Thanks,

Kim  Ward

John/Sean:

A few thoughts on the Griffith deal:

1.  Term:  PPL indicates they want to do the deal through 2003.  That is 
really 2003 - 2004 as it incldues Nov - Mar.  Extension until this time might 
require extension of our underlying deal.  This would be OK with us.
2.  Character of service:   The text indicates that PPL would have the right 
to request deliveries be made to an alternqate point on TW.  Why would they 
want this?  This could be a problem if we know the gas wouldn't flow as we 
would shut in puchases.  We would like to make this on a mutually acceptable 
basis.
3.  Pricing:  Does the reservation cahrge include variable transport?  I 
think that is what we proposed.  If not, then the Commodity rate flow needs 
to include the variable cost of  transport plus fuel.
4.  Conditions:  Noms must be in at 8:00 am.  This is very important and the 
a deal killer.  We need time to manage the position.  Also, the weekend issue 
needs to be addressed.  As we have discussed, weekends trade as the same 
quantity each day.  If they want to vary the daily amoount during the weekend 
and make Sunday higher than Sat or Monday, that is fairly ewaasy to deal 
with.  If they want to have lower takes on Sunday, this is more difficult ad 
increases costs.  We might be able to craft a solution to this however.

All-

The total nomination for month of April 2001 is 10,506MMBtu per day.  This
includes:

1. 4,135MMBtu/day purchase from Engage @ Kingsgate (4,006MMBtu/day @ Malin);
2. 3,000MMBtu/day APEA gas;
3. 1,000MMBtu/day balance of year strip purchased on behalf of Azusa @
$7.71/MMBtu;
4. 2,000MMBtu/day under two separate fixed contracts of 1,000MMBtu/day each;
4. 500MMBtu/day March 2001 through Feb strip purchased @ $7.63;

Losses on the PG & E line have decreased from March 2001 to 3.12%.  We have
not sold any of the APEA gas (3,000MMBtu/day)at this time.

To review the phone conversation between Jan and me, we are planning to shut
down our last steam plant for maintenance from midnight March 30, 2001
through 1800 or so April 11, 2001.  Kim and I have arranged for Enron to
purchase the non-APEA gas during that period.  At this time, we believe that
the power plant will burn enough gas during the last 20 days of the month to
use the APEA gas.  If anything changes, I will notify you.

If you have any questions, please contact me.

Thanks.

It was a billing error. We didn't bill them for enough back in early 2000 and 
then too much in Dec.  I don't think you need to worry about it unless they 
mention it to you.  If so, try to blame me and have them call me to explain.

I am assuming this is ok.  Why would they be invoiced for Feb - April now?  
Was this an error?

Have they called you with any questions and should I get back with them?

Chris,
I am sorry to keep bring this account up.  Thank you for the price change.  I 
have all the months corrected; however, Akzo got invoice incorrectly for 
February, March and April.  The coordinator who invoice them use the January 
NGI index price instead of the correct month index.  The amount they owe ENA 
is $17,561.05.  ENA owes them (7,922.93) for some volume allocation for 
December 2000.  So the net amount they owe ENA is $9,638.12.
I need to invoice them for the incorrect NGI index used and also to give them 
back the credit owed to them.   Let me know if this is ok with you.
isabel


PS I promise this is it.

My last communication with Monica's attorney was that he was satisfied with 
our responses to his request and that he was going to run the contract 
through other groups at the city and would get back to us.  I can insert the 
last wording change in the previous draft that I had provided to the parties 
if you think that will speed up their attorney's signoff.
Attached is the final version of the contract.  Please feel free to forward 
it to Monica.  If they are agreeable, please have them accept the red-line 
changes, print 2 originals, sign and forward to Enron for final execution.

Dan,

What is our status with the Palo Alto Agreement?  According to Monica, they 
are waiting on a final copy with the language that has been agreed to by both 
parties.  She is ready to sign.  I know that we have lost one transaction due 
to paper not being in place.  Can you send me the final document and I will 
forward to Monica?

Also, can we discuss El Paso on Tuesday?

Thanks,

Kim

Patti Sullivan has cerated a new El Paso interruptible contract for 
delivering to Griffith.  It is an Enron contract.  This agreemnet is 9M52.  
For the gas we delivered yesterday, we will be invoicing Citizens based on 
deliveries as a special deal over and above our base deal.  You will have an 
imbalance at Griffith that will go to your OBA.  I will get you the price 
later today.

Nogales used some gas last month.  Citizens has an IT contract 989N that we 
can use to deliver to this point.  I am still a little uncertain as to how 
you want us to handle this.  Please advise if the following procedure is how 
you want it handled:

1.  EPMI will deliver gas to Nogales on 989N
2.  When gas is delivered, we will bill Citizens based on the price when gas 
is delivered rather then when used, as you want this account isolated.
3.  We should "0-out" any current imbalance position at Noglaes based on 1 
and 2 above.

Please call to discuss.

Chris

Grant,  
 Sorry for the delay in responding to your additional inquiries.
 7. Re 4.2(iv)(b) - I would propose the clause to read:  "(b) file a petition 
or otherwise commence, authorize or acquiesce in the commencement of a 
proceeding or cause under any bankruptcy or similar law of the protection of 
creditors, or have such petition filed against it and such proceeding remains 
undismissed for 30 Days, provided if a petition is filed against the Affected 
Party and the  Affected Party is actively pursuing all steps to have such 
proceeding dismissed and provides the other party with reasonable 
documentation supporting its actions to cause such proceeding to be 
dismissed, then such Affected Party shall have an additional 30 Days to 
effectuate such dismissal,"
 8.  Re 4.2 (v) and 4.2 (vi) -  "20 or more Gas Days" is acceptable.
 13. I will change the definition of "Act" as you suggest.
 21. I propose that language be added whereby the parties shall first attempt 
to settle the matters to be resolved by the use of binding Arbitration by 
mon-binding mediation and if that does not resolve the issue to the 
satisfaction of the parties, such matter shall thereafter be resolved by the 
use of binding Arbitration.  Is this an acceptable resolution?
 22. We cannot agree to any list of parties who are authorized to enter into 
transactions under the contract.  Our position is that whoever answers the 
trading phone during trading hours is authorized to bind the company.  
However, we will provide the City with an initial contact list of the people 
on the trading floor whom the city can contact as of the date the contract is 
signed; however, the persons who are authorized to enter into a transaction 
with the city will not be limited to the initial contact list.  Of course, 
the city could always attempt to contact someone on the initial contact 
list.  Will an initial contact list be acceptable?  

Please let me have your thoughts concerning the above.  
          Dan.

Dan, please accept my apologies for replying so late.  I was out of town
again, and am back at trying to complete 5+ days of work within 3 days.

Thanks for accepting a lot of our requests.  Let me follow up with a couple
of additional inquiries.

7.  Re 4.2(iv), please suggest language as you've indicated in sentence 2.
Anything along the lines you've proposed likely will be agreeable.

8.  Re 4.2(v) and (vi).  How about 20 days?

13. Definition of "Act."  I suggest you refer to Article 11, sections 5 and
9 of the California Constitution, to be more specific.  Section 3 is not
regularly cited as the line of authority to the best of my knowledge, though
I can see how the language could lead  one to cite it.

21.  In California, the concept of binding mediation is not recognized, if I
have understood our outside counsel at prior mediations in which I've
participated.  Mediation is non-binding.  As a practical matter, it can cost
almost as much in terms of time, money and effort to proceed to mediation,
but the "rules of engagement" are not as tight as are found in arbitration.
We avoid the rigid procedures.  I believe Enron should consider this
approach at times.  Having gone through a couple, I would not recommend to
my client that we would proceed any further once the mediator makes a
proposal that's acceptable to the parties.  The cost of arbitration is not
worth it.  That's why we in California tend to prefer mediation to
arbitration.

22.  I have to insist on behalf of my client that we assemble some list.
Surely, Enron can submit a list of people that will be initially approved to
engage in authorized transactions.  We can do the same.  We've had an
unfavorable experience with another Texas-based
energy company regarding the scope of its representative's authority.  We
don't want to litigate the issue of due authority.  That list would help
It's not a matter of the city claiming the authority to back out of the
contract, because someone arguably didn't have the authority.  There are a
ton of cases which would make it extremely difficult to make that claim.

Thanks.  Grant.

>>
  (See attached file: 2001-002ctr.doc)

  Grant,
       I have reviewed your requested changes and have made
the changes which
  do not require explanation or clarification.  Those changes
are reflected
  in the above document.  Let me go over your list of items:
       1.   I have deleted the word "DRAFT".
       2.   I have left a blank for the date within the month
of March 2001
  when the contract would be executed by the City.
       3.   I have changed the word "may" to "shall".
       4.   Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity does not fit
in a
  Deficiency Default, it is just the maximum quantity that can
be handled by
  a party at a particular point.  I do not think their is an
omission.
       5.   I have added the word "reasonable".
       6.   The procedue for how the Termination Payment is
determined is
  provided, if the City disagrees with the method and values
provided in the
  statement and is unable to convince the Company to revise,
the statement,
  then the issue is to be resolved in arbitration.  At the
point that a
  Termination Payment calculation is necessary, a long drawn
out period
  should not be necessary to attain closure.
       7.   We need to limit the duration to 30 days,  neither
party should
  be required to wait 60 days before it could accelerate the
other party's
  obligations under the Contract.  We might be able to add
language to extend
  the period if we had some documentation stating the steps
that a party was
  pursuing to cause the proceeding to be dismissed and the
other party was
  otherwise kept whole from a credit exposure.
       8.   I have kept the 30 days because 5 days is too
short a period.
  During a holiday period, one scheduling error could cover
the entire
  period.  Article 3 has language which provides a remedy for
a party if a
  scheduling default extends for more than 5 days during any
month.
       9.   The reason is because Enron Corp. is the rated
entity and no
  separate rating applies to ENA.
       10.  I have changed "a" to "the"
       11.  I have eliminated the  60 day limitation on the
duration of an
  event of Force Majeure.
       12.  This merely addressed the possibility of a
imbalance amount being
  due when a pipeline aggregates imbalances using multiple
points, and the
  language would allocated the payment based on the amount of
the imbalance
  that a particular party may have caused.  I think the
language is clear as
  written.
       13.  The definition of Act was one of the items that I
had requested
  that you review and complete as necessary so that all
appropriate statutes
  were referenced.  I am still waiting for your language.  I
started filling
  it in using language that had been provided by the City.
       14.  I added the word "reasonable".
       15.  I have made the requested change relating to
GAAAP.
       16.  This is a late payment provision and as such a
believe that the
  provision should be more than a party's rating, as such I
have kept the 2%
  over prime language.
       17.  These amounts were determined by the credit group
and any change
  needs to be discussed with that group.  BBB-  is considered
investment
  grade and I understand that Enron Corp.'s rating is BBB.
ENA is not a
  rated entity and that is why the language relates to Enron
Corp.'s rating.
       18.  The elimination of the opinion of counsel did not
change the
  requirements relating to the representations that we expect
the City to
  have made.  If the City cannot make these representations,
then we need to
  know that before we execute the Contract.
       19.  I have added the word "reasonable".
       20.  The party that has the Transport Agreement with
the Transporter
  should have the legal right to obtain the information based
on its
  contract.
       21.  It is our position that any dispute be arbitrated.
We can agree
  to meditation if we can make the outcome binding on the
parties.  I am
  willing to discuss any changed language that you might care
to offer.
       22.  We have found that personnel of both our Company
and that of our
  Customers change so rapidily that the list is not workable
and merely
  allows a party to back out of transactions it does not like
on the basis
  that the person who agreed to such transaction was not on
the list.
  Therefore , we object to any listing of approved parties who
can transact.
  We believe that each party should be responsible for the
actions of its
  employees and should stand behind any transactions that
those parties may
  enter into pursuant to the terms and provisions of the
Contract.

       I will be out of the office on Friday, but will be in
all next week if
  you care to discuss any of these matters.

Subject:     RE: Enfolio Master Firm

Purchase/Sale Agreement






   <<0071988 RESO Enron.doc>>

  Dan:

  First, I've attached the proposed resolution which
authorizes the City
  Manager to execute the Enfolio agreement.

  More importantly, I need to inform you that our senior
management has
  reviewed the referenced contract; I have been asked to
present additional
  changes to the agreement for Enron's consideration and to
raise questions
  about certain of its terms and conditions.

  Let me start from page 1, top to bottom, and proceed to the
end of the
  exhibits.

  1.  There is the word "DRAFT" above the title of the Enfolio
agreement
  which
  should be deleted.

  2.  The introductory paragraph, line 5, should not contain
the words "1st
  of
  January, 2001."  It should be left blank, until the parties
have signed the
  contract.  Otherwise, the City will be in breach as of the
date it signs
  the
  contract, because Article 2, section 2.1 requires the City
to proffer the
  to-be-approved-by-Council resolution as of 1/1/01.

  3.  Article 2, Section 2.4, line 2.  The City (Customer)
wants Enron
  (Company) to confirm every recorded telephonic Transaction,
as defined.
  Therefore, the City requests the word "may" should be
changed to "shall."

  4.  Article 3, Sections 3.1 and 3.2, first sentence:
Buyer's Requested
  Quantity refers to the DCQ or MaxDQ.  Seller's failure to
Schedule the
  Buyer's Requested Quantity shall constitute a Seller's
Deficiency Default.
  How does a Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity fit into a
Seller's
  Deficiency Default if the Buyer's Requested Quantity does
not include a
  Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity?  What is the reason
for the
  omission?

  5.  Article 4, Section 4.1, lines 15 and 23:  Line 23 refers
to "reasonable
  attorneys' fees" yet line 15 refers to "attorneys' fees."
To be internally
  consistent, line 15 should say "reasonable attorneys' fees."

  6.  Section 4.1, right hand column, lines 3-4.  A statement
showing the
  determination of the Termination Payment will be prepared.
It's unclear
  whether the City is entitled to review and challenge the
determination
  before a dispute is referred to arbitration.  The City
should be entitled
  to
  receive a copy of the determination and to question it
before it is
  obligated to pay the Termination Payment.  Please clarify,
or permit the
  City to exercise these rights.

  7.  Section 4.2(iv) specifies that a Triggering Event will
exist if a
  bankruptcy petition is undismissed within 30 days.  Is this
(under
  bankruptcy laws) the minimum period of time within which one
may seek
  dismissal of a bankruptcy petition?  Please refer to the 11
USC section
  that
  backs up this provision, or change to 60 days.

  8.  Section 4.2(v) and (vi):  Please change "30 days" to "5
days."  The
  City
  is concerned with the number of days that Enron may be
permitted to fail to
  Schedule before a Triggering Event is triggered by Enron.

  9.  Section 4.2(ix):  this language discusses a default by
Enron Corp.
  (ENA's parent?), but no mention is made of ENA's default in
this regard?
  Please explain.

  10. Section 4.5, line 4:  Is "a Company" supposed to refer
to "the Company"
  ?

  11. Article 5.  The City is uncomfortable with the force
majeure provision
  as drafted.  It states that the parties must perform even if
a FM event
  (earthquake) would prevent either or both parties from
performing with the
  60-day period stated therein.  There is no such limitation
under California
  law in the absence of a contract provision to the contrary.

  12.  Article 7, Section 7.2:  Could Enron translate the last
sentence?  We
  don't understand it.

  13.  Appendix "1":  Act:  Please explain why Section 3 is
referred to?

  14.  Appendix "1", Claims, line 4:  Please add "reasonable"
before
  "attorneys' fees.

   15.  Appendix "1", GAAP:  This should read: "GAAP means
generally accepted
  accounting principles, consistently applied, with respect to
Company, and
  governmental generally accepted accounting principles,
consistently
  applied,
  with respect to Customer."

  16.  Appendix "1", Interest Rate:  Please delete "two
percent over".  The
  City has a AAA bond rating, therefore, the  City believes
the 2% over prime
  should not apply to it.

  17.  Appendix "1", Material Adverse Change:  What does Enron
believe the
  City's Net Worth to be?  The $400 million threshold is
mentioned.  Also,
  what is ENA's bond rating?  Is "BBB-" an investment grade
rating?

  18.  Representations and Warranties:  Because we have agreed
that the
  opinion of counsel will not be required, the reps and
warranties are being
  deleted.  But the "Representations and Warranties" is
nevertheless included
  in the agreement.  Item (i) should be deleted, because the
City has not
  undertaken a court search as is our custom and practice
whenever we issue
  an
  opinion.  We would like to delete "and (vii) it is not ...
Party."

  19.  Operational Flow Orders, line 8:  Please add
"reasonable" before
  "attorneys' fees."

  20.  Financial Matters, line 8:  What is meant by "to the
extent it has a
  legal right of access thereto and/or ...etc."

  21.  Arbitration, Disputes to be Arbitrated.  We do not as a
matter of
  legal
  policy agree to arbitration, but we will mediate disputes.
Is Enron
  amenable to mediation?  This process is less formal and less
costly in my
  opinion.

  22.  Authority for Transactions.  Staff would like the
Agreement to include
  a list of employees for Company and Customer who are
authorized to trade on
  behalf of their employers.  Could a statement be added to
this section to
  this effect?  Then, we could attach the list(s) as an
Exhibit C.

  Thank you so much for considering these issues.  There are
others which I
  hope to receive from staff next week and which I will
forward to you for
  response.

  Look forward to hearing from you soon.  I will be out of
town after today
  until Wednesday, March 7.

  Sincerely,

  Grant Kolling

            Grant,
                 I have incorporated the language you provided
to me in
  the attached
            document.  I have been informed by the Corporate
Secretary's
  office that
            they will issue a Certificate of Incumbency
showing that the
  person
            executing the contract for ENA is authorized to
execute
  contracts for ENA.
            No other party signs as to form or terms, however,
the
  officer executing
            for ENA will require that the deal person and I
initial on
  the line next to
            his signature.  I have reviewed the proposed draft
  resolution.  ENA will
            accept the enacted resolution and will not require
that the
  City Attorney
            issue an opinion.  If the attached contract is
acceptable,
  please print off
            2 originals, have them approved, signed and
forward to me
  for ENA's
            approval and signature.  Once the contract is
fully
  executed, I will return
            one fully executed original to you for the City's
file.

John

Talked to Kim Ward at  Enron this afternoon to confirm pricing for rolling 
the contract forward.?  She expressed concern that there are specific 
tolerances that Enron has to abide  by or they will incur penalties.? She 
stated that Enron contacted the LA  Vernon site today to see if you were 
running.? They were told no, and she  said that later today that changed 
without notice to Enron.

This may have  been an oversight today, but a concern when trying to move 
forward with any  marketer.? 
To eliminate the baseload requirements and Gas Daily pricing  for swing 
volumes, the plant has to be proactive in notifying Enron of any  significant 
changes in usage.? Otherwise, Enron will force the penalties  back to SSCC.

Thank you,
Lynn

I spoke to Choi Lee today.  It is hard for me to remain professional with him 
as his arrogance and illogic is very frustrating, but our discussion was very 
cordial.  He indicated that Enron has not brought forth any proposal of 
substance.  This apprarently means we have not offered them energy at below 
market prices.  I indicated that should he find some of that energy in the 
"$50 - $60" range to give me a call as we would be willing to buy in the "70s 
and the 80s."  I was not able to learn when he would be in the market to buy, 
but I encouraged him to give me a call if he wanted a price quote.  I don't 
have much confidence that he would call even if he was buying.  I will leave 
it up to him to call rather than make this a priority to chase as the 
opportunities with PD seem to be limited.  If they do need energy I expect 
they will keep the term short and shop it pretty hard.  There mining 
operation plans seem tenuous and they think prices are going to fall.  With 
APS and Salt River out there in the shorter duration markets we wouldn't make 
much money anyway.

Please do not hesitate to call if the situation changes and you need a 
electricy price quote for a structure you are working on.

Thanks!

Chris

Ahoy again,
Because of all the positive response, I called the  Windjammer Barefoot 
Cruise ?group department and negotiated a 20% savings  for two different 
cruises. 
?
LEGACY: October  28-November 3?cruise
**?Aruba, Bonaire, Curacao, Venezuela,  Aruba
??? Ensign Cabins  (bunks)??? Reg. $1000, our cruise, $800
??? Commodore (Double Bed)? Reg.  $1125, our cruise, $900??
????Port  charges,?????????????????  $90.00 
??? NO CHARGE FOR THE  STOWAWAY
??? Fare Share  will apply. It is $890 from PDX, will be less for those of 
you to the  East. Once you have made a deposit I can get the Fare Share rate 
from your  airport. ?
?
WJ is in the process of negotiating with hotels in Aruba. I  will not be 
doing group hotel arrangements; I will share info about  hotels, and those 
who want to stay over can do their own.
?
POLYNESIA: November 5-10  Repositioning Cruise (For those wanting to do a 
Back to Back)
**From St. Lucia to St. Maarten
Theme Cruise: Sea of Wellness,  
??? ??? with Massage  Therapists, Yoga, etc. 
?? ?Deck  Cabins,??????? Reg. $1100, our cruise,  $880
??? Standard Cabins,? Reg. $900,  our cruise:? $720
???  BQ,?????????????????????  Reg. $700, our cruise?? $560
??? Port  Charges?????? ?$65
?
THE CATCH: WJ group department will only  deal with one person, so all 
payments and questions have to?pass through  me. If we don't get 15 people, 
the rate reverts to the regular  rate. So, enlist your funnest?buddies to 
come along, too.  
?
HOW TO GET IN ON THE DEAL:
1). Decide which week(s) you want to sail
2). Send a $200 deposit for each cruise and $100 additional  if you plan to 
use Fare Share
??? Checks can be made out to WJ or to me,  and sent?to ??? me at: PO BOX 
1723, Newport, Oregon  97365
??? You can use your credit card.? Send  me the # and ??? expiration date, or 
you can give it to me on the  ??? ??? phone. My number is:  (541)765-4577. 
3). IF you want to use Fare Share, let me know which days  you want to arrive 
and depart, and from which airport.
?
Simple as 1-2-3.? 
?
Looking forward to seeing you!
Gail

Chris, attorneys have indicated there is no affiliate problem with EAMR 
negotiating a contract with ENA for the operation of the Citizens assets as 
described in the contract I sent you Friday.   IF we can make it work it 
makes more sense this way and tells a good story in support of the "One 
Enron" message. 

Please let me know what your availability is for Wednesday so I can set up a 
conference call with legal and marketing services to discuss the work to be 
done so we can flush out the liability issue.  You and I can continue our 
discussion on price one on one.

Thanks,

Don

Kim,
 The response to III P. should be Not Applicable, unless you are having 
someone obtain a Certificate of Good Standing from the State of California.  
 The response to III Q. should be that the Final Contract and Transaction 
Agreement will be signed by a Vice President of Enron North America Corp. and 
as agreed with the City's counsel, a Certificate of Incumbency shall be 
provided to verify that the person signing is an officer of the Company.
 The remainder of the document appears okay.  I was curious as to how you 
were going to respond to their statement regarding their potential purchase 
of interstate transportation assets and their request that we manage these 
assets for them.  Repricing should work.

 Call me if you have any further questions.

Ann,

Attached is a draft of Enron's response to your request for proposals for
gas supply to power generation plant in development by Calpeak Power, LLC.
As requested, Enron has provided indexed pricing with the option to convert
to various fixed priced products during the term of the agreement.

The  options  presented  are  not  intended to represent a complete list of
opportunities,  but  are representative of the different pricing structures
Enron  offers.   There  are several additional structures available  and we
look forward to discussing these options with you.

Please call me with any questions you might have regarding the proposal.  I
look forward to hearing from you soon.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

wimby and under our contract with him, he will back to back each trade with 
public Service Company of colorado.  In other words, he doesn't have his own 
credit.  Could you set him up, at least with a temporary password?  His info

Kim,

It is that time again. We do this 4 times/year. I need to get a cost
forecast by month from you for natural gas through the end of this year.

p.s. I know it is early but is our price for March available yet?

Chris,

Would you try to get the 3,000 scheduled under the IT agreement everyday.  If
the back fill price from California, can get done for $10.00 or less, Sean
has agreed that we can use the back fill option.

Congrats Kim. Having heard the rumor on the street about the success you
folks have enjoyed this quarter, I'd say you couldn't have timed the move
any better. The next time I am in Houston (which will be the first time)I am
expecting to have you show me the town. I'll give you enough notice so you
can book the next day off sick.

Sound O.K.?

It was good to hear from you.

Talk to you sometime soon.

Cheers

Congratulations on a healthy new baby!  Tyler is sort of a southern name -
I like it!  As for me - I got a call last November to come back and market
gas in the west.  I didn't think there was much going on out there but
decided to go for it for personal reasons.  got here Jan. 2 and gas had
completely blown out in the west.  So far, it seems like it was a good move
for me.

My house in PDX sold in 4 days and I came to Houston between Christmas and
New years and found a place here.  Still trying to move in as I can't get
anything done during the week!  Just had new blinds put in yesterday.

Let me know if you are ever in town - keep in touch

Kim

Hey you. I didn't know you were in Houston. You are over there on the gas
side?! WOW!! When did that happen?
You always did like Houston didn't you. I bet you are having a great time
doing gas. It is quite a market these days.

I didn't go to Phoenix because I just had a baby boy. Tyler is his name. He
was born March 6th. I have a couple of boys now  they will be just fine if
they take after their daddy.

Other than the new arrival things are pretty much steady in my life. Things
are going very well here at Mirant (quite the new name eh!).

Give me an update on your life - being in Houston and all now.

Talk to you soon


Cheers

Scotty,

Didn't see you in Phoenix last week - I actually was in PHX for meetings
and crashed the power party!  How are things?  Houston is good and gas is
great right now.  Let me know how you are -

Chris,
The refinery is potentially interested in a swap for Mid-C firm power, 20MW
block for:

1Q 2001

2001 full year

2001-2003 (3-year)

Can you provide an indicative quote for these periods?  Current price
levels
are forcing us to reevaluate our plans and targets for hedging.  'Not sure
how liquid the market is this week with all the news and price swings.  If
there isn't a market, that'd be useful information too....

Thanks,
-------Mark

Kim,
 The language is awkward but okay.  Question, for weekends, Sat, Sun & Mon 
you probably want to use the Gas Daily Midpoint Price published on Tuesday. 
Otherwise, the Tues price is published wednesday, etc  and the friday price 
is published on Monday.  Or do you want to use and average of the price 
applicable for Friday flow and the price applicable for Monday flow for the 
weekend period.  Just questions to consider.  Please call if you need to 
include any of the above concepts in the offer.

Kim:

This is to confirm my conversation with you this morning pertaining to
ENRON's 2002-2003 long-term gas supply (at a fixed price of $4.62/MMBtu)
offer.  Currently, EPE can not accept several of the terms and conditions
included in your confirmation draft letter (dated January 22, 2001) and the
attached ENFOLIO.

EPE appreciates your efforts in attempting to meet our LT gas supply
requirements and we look forward to a continued business relationship.

Thanks,

Barry

Arco has surfaced again.  They are looking at buying a fixed price for term. 
I will be out for a few days.  Kim Ward will be handling this transaction in 
my abscence.  Her extension is x3826.  I am assuming that we can use the 
short form of ISDA we used previously.  I am assuming we are OK on credit for 
up to 1 year.  If longer wie will double check with Tracy.  Please contact me 
and let me now if this is OK.

Kim,

Thanks for all your help today.  I apologize for my propensity to catch you
away from your desk.  We all have to be good at something, right?  Anyway,
here are the fixed-price volumes associated with a portion of the basis
transactions done in June and Q3.  I'm missing some deal numbers, but I'm
guessing you won't need those.

Deal Number  Month  Date  Volume Price

   June  12/28/2000 50,000 5.320
EU8529.X/67851 June  2/16/2001 50,000 5.530

   July  12/28/2000 50,000 5.340
EU8529.P/67851 July  1/19/2001 50,000 5.630

   August 12/28/2000 50,000 5.290

EU8529.G-L/67851 September 1/10/2001 60,000 6.020
QS5478.1/67851 September 2/16/2001 50,000 5.530


In other news, a few of us, including Art and I, are getting together for
drinks after work tomorrow if you or anyone else is interested.
Coincidentally, the State Bar is the location of choice, so I hope you
aren't State Bar-ed out.  Let us know.  I believe everyone will be swinging
by around 5 or so.

Thanks again,


Charlie Sanchez

Kim
Good morning.? I spoke with Jason yesterday  afternoon.? Summit had the 
Irvine plant's contract expiring at the end of  April 2001.? The RFP we sent 
out shows that the new contract start date is  May 1, 2001 for that site.? I 
will check the contract today to see what the  situation is because Jason had 
in his letter that the proposed deal would start  March 1, 2001.
This site has a month to month deal and must have had a  notification date, 
which I will look into.
Also, we have compiled information for  another Smurfit site that is on 
tariff.? Every month, we paid less for the  tariff customer, which has less 
usage, than for Irvine.
I can show you that information if you would like. I brought  up this issue 
with Jason, and he said we could look at switching to a fixed  rate.? This 
doesn't really solve the problem.? I had wanted to look  into the possibility 
of switching back to tariff for that customer. It seems  that for the smaller 
customers, tariff is the better option.? Certainly for  the month of December 
(I haven't even seen that bill), it would've been the  better choice.? 
I did want to review the pricing for the larger Smurfit  facilities also.? 
When you get a chance, please give me?a call.?  
Thanks Kim!

Lynn,

I received your message after you left  today.? Jason is from our retail
company who does serve some of  Smurfit's box plants.? I have left a message
with him to discuss your  RFP and what make sense for us to do.? We may need
to split things up  between the box plants and the Mill.? Call me when you
get a chance  and hopefully I will have had a discussion with  him.

Thanks,

Kim

I have been told by Kim and Dan that the City is currently not authorized to 
trade in derivatives, but that the city council will vote on an authorizing 
resolution at an April meeting.

In terms of negotiation of the ISDA, we sent out a draft to them a few weeks 
ago, but I have heard nothing back.  We are requiring a legal opinion on the 
same form that we require other municipals to give for financial trading.

Dan- Have you looked into the authority of Palo Alto to buy and sell physical 
gas? 

Bob- I understand that you may be doing an ISDA with them. Have you looked 
into the authority issues yet?

I would suggest that you get the middle market group together and tell them 
as a group.  Then write an e-mail to send out to the floor.  The e-mail can 
either come from me or from Kim.  I am fine however you want to handle it.

For April the indexes were as follows:

San Juan NGI - $4.51/MMBtu
SoCal:  $12.56
PG&E SoCal:  $7.71

So, PG&E is a  lot less valuable but still decent at $3.31 spread.  

Re: your question, the more I think about it the more I think PG&E is the 
relevant index.  A basket would be better for Citizens but less attractive to 
Griffith.  Can you sell them on the basket?

Thanks, Chris. 

What are your thoughts on using a basket approach to the index? ?As an  
alternative to just using either SoCal or PGE, we could use the average. ? 
Would any other index points be appropriate? 

See the attached file. ?I have provided for averaging the two indexes.

Grant,
 I have reviewed your requested changes and have made the changes which do 
not require explanation or clarification.  Those changes are reflected in the 
above document.  Let me go over your list of items:
 1. I have deleted the word "DRAFT".
 2. I have left a blank for the date within the month of March 2001 when the 
contract would be executed by the City.
 3. I have changed the word "may" to "shall".
 4. Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity does not fit in a Deficiency 
Default, it is just the maximum quantity that can be handled by a party at a 
particular point.  I do not think their is an omission.
 5. I have added the word "reasonable".
 6. The procedue for how the Termination Payment is determined is provided, 
if the City disagrees with the method and values provided in the statement 
and is unable to convince the Company to revise, the statement, then the 
issue is to be resolved in arbitration.  At the point that a Termination 
Payment calculation is necessary, a long drawn out period should not be 
necessary to attain closure.
 7. We need to limit the duration to 30 days,  neither party should be 
required to wait 60 days before it could accelerate the other party's 
obligations under the Contract.  We might be able to add language to extend 
the period if we had some documentation stating the steps that a party was 
pursuing to cause the proceeding to be dismissed and the other party was 
otherwise kept whole from a credit exposure.
 8. I have kept the 30 days because 5 days is too short a period.  During a 
holiday period, one scheduling error could cover the entire period.  Article 
3 has language which provides a remedy for a party if a scheduling default 
extends for more than 5 days during any month. 
 9. The reason is because Enron Corp. is the rated entity and no separate 
rating applies to ENA.
 10. I have changed "a" to "the"
 11. I have eliminated the  60 day limitation on the duration of an event of 
Force Majeure.
 12. This merely addressed the possibility of a imbalance amount being due 
when a pipeline aggregates imbalances using multiple points, and the language 
would allocated the payment based on the amount of the imbalance that a 
particular party may have caused.  I think the language is clear as written.
 13. The definition of Act was one of the items that I had requested that you 
review and complete as necessary so that all appropriate statutes were 
referenced.  I am still waiting for your language.  I started filling it in 
using language that had been provided by the City.
 14. I added the word "reasonable".
 15. I have made the requested change relating to GAAAP.
 16. This is a late payment provision and as such a believe that the 
provision should be more than a party's rating, as such I have kept the 2% 
over prime language.
 17. These amounts were determined by the credit group and any change needs 
to be discussed with that group.  BBB-  is considered investment grade and I 
understand that Enron Corp.'s rating is BBB.  ENA is not a rated entity and 
that is why the language relates to Enron Corp.'s rating.
 18. The elimination of the opinion of counsel did not change the 
requirements relating to the representations that we expect the City to have 
made.  If the City cannot make these representations, then we need to know 
that before we execute the Contract.
 19. I have added the word "reasonable".
 20. The party that has the Transport Agreement with the Transporter should 
have the legal right to obtain the information based on its contract.  
 21. It is our position that any dispute be arbitrated.  We can agree to 
meditation if we can make the outcome binding on the parties.  I am willing 
to discuss any changed language that you might care to offer.
 22. We have found that personnel of both our Company and that of our 
Customers change so rapidily that the list is not workable and merely allows 
a party to back out of transactions it does not like on the basis that the 
person who agreed to such transaction was not on the list.  Therefore , we 
object to any listing of approved parties who can transact.  We believe that 
each party should be responsible for the actions of its employees and should 
stand behind any transactions that those parties may enter into pursuant to 
the terms and provisions of the Contract.  

 I will be out of the office on Friday, but will be in all next week if you 
care to discuss any of these matters.

 <<0071988 RESO Enron.doc>>

Dan:

First, I've attached the proposed resolution which authorizes the City
Manager to execute the Enfolio agreement.

More importantly, I need to inform you that our senior management has
reviewed the referenced contract; I have been asked to present additional
changes to the agreement for Enron's consideration and to raise questions
about certain of its terms and conditions.

Let me start from page 1, top to bottom, and proceed to the end of the
exhibits.

1.  There is the word "DRAFT" above the title of the Enfolio agreement which
should be deleted.

2.  The introductory paragraph, line 5, should not contain the words "1st of
January, 2001."  It should be left blank, until the parties have signed the
contract.  Otherwise, the City will be in breach as of the date it signs the
contract, because Article 2, section 2.1 requires the City to proffer the
to-be-approved-by-Council resolution as of 1/1/01.

3.  Article 2, Section 2.4, line 2.  The City (Customer) wants Enron
(Company) to confirm every recorded telephonic Transaction, as defined.
Therefore, the City requests the word "may" should be changed to "shall."

4.  Article 3, Sections 3.1 and 3.2, first sentence:   Buyer's Requested
Quantity refers to the DCQ or MaxDQ.  Seller's failure to Schedule the
Buyer's Requested Quantity shall constitute a Seller's Deficiency Default.
How does a Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity fit into a Seller's
Deficiency Default if the Buyer's Requested Quantity does not include a
Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity?  What is the reason for the omission?

5.  Article 4, Section 4.1, lines 15 and 23:  Line 23 refers to "reasonable
attorneys' fees" yet line 15 refers to "attorneys' fees."  To be internally
consistent, line 15 should say "reasonable attorneys' fees."

6.  Section 4.1, right hand column, lines 3-4.  A statement showing the
determination of the Termination Payment will be prepared.  It's unclear
whether the City is entitled to review and challenge the determination
before a dispute is referred to arbitration.  The City should be entitled to
receive a copy of the determination and to question it before it is
obligated to pay the Termination Payment.  Please clarify, or permit the
City to exercise these rights.

7.  Section 4.2(iv) specifies that a Triggering Event will exist if a
bankruptcy petition is undismissed within 30 days.  Is this (under
bankruptcy laws) the minimum period of time within which one may seek
dismissal of a bankruptcy petition?  Please refer to the 11 USC section that
backs up this provision, or change to 60 days.

8.  Section 4.2(v) and (vi):  Please change "30 days" to "5 days."  The City
is concerned with the number of days that Enron may be permitted to fail to
Schedule before a Triggering Event is triggered by Enron.

9.  Section 4.2(ix):  this language discusses a default by Enron Corp.
(ENA's parent?), but no mention is made of ENA's default in this regard?
Please explain.

10. Section 4.5, line 4:  Is "a Company" supposed to refer to "the Company"
?

11. Article 5.  The City is uncomfortable with the force majeure provision
as drafted.  It states that the parties must perform even if a FM event
(earthquake) would prevent either or both parties from performing with the
60-day period stated therein.  There is no such limitation under California
law in the absence of a contract provision to the contrary.

12.  Article 7, Section 7.2:  Could Enron translate the last sentence?  We
don't understand it.

13.  Appendix "1":  Act:  Please explain why Section 3 is referred to?

14.  Appendix "1", Claims, line 4:  Please add "reasonable" before
"attorneys' fees.

 15.  Appendix "1", GAAP:  This should read: "GAAP means generally accepted
accounting principles, consistently applied, with respect to Company, and
governmental generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied,
with respect to Customer."

16.  Appendix "1", Interest Rate:  Please delete "two percent over".  The
City has a AAA bond rating, therefore, the  City believes the 2% over prime
should not apply to it.

17.  Appendix "1", Material Adverse Change:  What does Enron believe the
City's Net Worth to be?  The $400 million threshold is mentioned.  Also,
what is ENA's bond rating?  Is "BBB-" an investment grade rating?

18.  Representations and Warranties:  Because we have agreed that the
opinion of counsel will not be required, the reps and warranties are being
deleted.  But the "Representations and Warranties" is nevertheless included
in the agreement.  Item (i) should be deleted, because the City has not
undertaken a court search as is our custom and practice whenever we issue an
opinion.  We would like to delete "and (vii) it is not ... Party."

19.  Operational Flow Orders, line 8:  Please add "reasonable" before
"attorneys' fees."

20.  Financial Matters, line 8:  What is meant by "to the extent it has a
legal right of access thereto and/or ...etc."

21.  Arbitration, Disputes to be Arbitrated.  We do not as a matter of legal
policy agree to arbitration, but we will mediate disputes.  Is Enron
amenable to mediation?  This process is less formal and less costly in my
opinion.

22.  Authority for Transactions.  Staff would like the Agreement to include
a list of employees for Company and Customer who are authorized to trade on
behalf of their employers.  Could a statement be added to this section to
this effect?  Then, we could attach the list(s) as an Exhibit C.

Thank you so much for considering these issues.  There are others which I
hope to receive from staff next week and which I will forward to you for
response.

Look forward to hearing from you soon.  I will be out of town after today
until Wednesday, March 7.

Sincerely,

Grant Kolling

  Grant,
       I have incorporated the language you provided to me in
the attached
  document.  I have been informed by the Corporate Secretary's
office that
  they will issue a Certificate of Incumbency showing that the
person
  executing the contract for ENA is authorized to execute
contracts for ENA.
  No other party signs as to form or terms, however, the
officer executing
  for ENA will require that the deal person and I initial on
the line next to
  his signature.  I have reviewed the proposed draft
resolution.  ENA will
  accept the enacted resolution and will not require that the
City Attorney
  issue an opinion.  If the attached contract is acceptable,
please print off
  2 originals, have them approved, signed and forward to me
for ENA's
  approval and signature.  Once the contract is fully
executed, I will return
  one fully executed original to you for the City's file.

Kim,
 We currently have a Master with Eastern New Mexico Natural Gas Association, 
Inc. (Contract No. 96009607) therefor, the Confirm Desk can do the confirm 
once it is put in the system.  
 
Ellen,
 Do you agree?

Dan, 

Thanks for looking at this for me.  I did remove the phrase you mention in 
number 1 below.  As for a volume cap, I don't think that one is necessary in 
this case.  Their TW contract limits them to 1000 MMBtu/day.  Any prices that 
are fixed will not include TW transport charges.

Thanks again,

Kim

ps, once their board approves this term sheet, we will need to do a 
confirmation.  Will this be generated by you or when the deal is entered into 
the system?

Kim,
 I have reviewed your term sheet and have the following questions.  
1.  Under Term, you have included the phrase "with annual redetermination" 
however I find no redetermination language in the Price  section.  I would 
suggest that the phrase be deleted.
2.  Under Quantity, you indicate there expected volumes, however, we need to 
put some cap on the maximum, With a 5 year term, we should offer some maximum 
such as 200% of the expected volumes.  Any thoughts relating to a cap?
3.  Under Price you indicate that the price could be changed to a Fixed 
Price, I assume that you do not intend to include the Transwestern 
transportation charges as a part of the Fixed Price.  Is this correct?  and 
if so, does the Fixed Price language need to be qualified?  
 Otherwise, the term sheet appears okay.  
      Dan

Attached is a term sheet that has been sent to Eastern New Mexico gas company 
to extend a four year deal that ends on April 30, 2001.  Could you look into 
the confirmation for this transaction?  They will be going to the board for

Vito:

To give you an indication of the current value of your generation,  San Juan 
offers are running about NYMEX less $.20/MMBtu for most forward months.  That 
puts the fixed price about $5.50 - $5.75.  Peak Palo Verde Bids are

Q3 - $520
Q4 - $190
Q1 2001 - $125

It looks like you are in the money at least through the end of the year.

We have been looking at the transmission issue.  What substation would you be 
able to deliver to?  We can determine if transmission is available.  

Irrespective of availability, I still believe Salt River or APS will be the 
best physical bid for your energy as they can keep it in their system and 
avoid transmission.  

I would like to push forward to get ISDA swap contracts in place with BHP.  I 
remember losing a deal with Francis Mcalister a few years ago despite being a 
better offer because contracts were not in place.  Enron North America does 
not have an ISDA with BHP.  We could also push to get a physical electricity 
contract in place.  I think we have a physical gas contract.

Would you like to push ahead to get contracts in place?  Let me know.  It is 
not too early to start the process as it typically takes a month or so to 
make it happen.  What would be the name of the counterparty?  You are the US 
subsidiary of BHP correct?

Chris,
 Kim Ward asked me to forward this draft of the proposed Enfolio contract to 
you so that you could give it to her.  She said that she would send it to the 
city for its review.  The draft contains certain blanks which the city's 
counsel needs to provide.  Please call if you have any questions.

Mike,

Sorry this has taken me so long!  Still trying to get access to some
programs with the good info!  Indicative prices for 5 year gas out of April
01 at the PG&E city gate is about $5.85 and 10 years out of April 01 is
about $5.12.  I hope this helps.  Let me know if you need anything else!

Thanks,

Kim

Let me know all about what materializes with your man hunt?????
Everyone needs a mate, I think.  It is nice to share with another person
who is kind and loving towards you and will be there through thick and
thin.
I know I wish I could see all of you in Houston, but that isn't in the
cards.  I just bet Robin and Katie will have a great time with the new
little girls.  I just love Molly and Liam and I now think I am a
grandmother by adoption.  Molly is growing so much.
I am still cleaning houses while Mel is back at work.  It is tough for
him as he still doesn't feel good.  I just handle one day at a time right
now.  Things have been better for us and I pray they will be that way
again.  One never knows what the good Lord has in store for us.
In June we are going to Sand Point, Idaho for a week with our daughter,
her husband and 8 year old grandson.  A working dude ranch.  Can you
believe that??  They have a lake with fish and nice golf course for Mel,
horses for those who want to ride all day, even a cattle drive, but for
me I just want to rest, read and not clean houses.
I am getting anxious for summer now.  Nice weather always brings out the
best in people.
Now that I have been so long wined and yakked your ear off I will go
clean my own house.
Love, Kathy
ps-  If you ever get back here on business or whatever and need a place
to lite my home is open to you.  I have 2 extra bedrooms that are ready
for visitors.  Guess I could open a Bed and Breaks fast!!!

The meeting with Enron on April 6 will be by conference call at 8:30 am
Pacific time, 10:30 am Central time.  The agenda will be approximately what
has been distributed previously.  This format will permit Kim to include
several of her colleagues in the meeting, and will give CalPeak more time to
establish the appropriate credit relationships.

The call-in numbers are:

1-888-550-5969
Access code: 140108 followed by the pound sign

If there are any problems getting into the call, phone the CalPeak number
shown at the top of the agenda, which is 619-239-1212, or my mobile phone
503-539-4022.

The West Gas Desk built up a negative imbalance on Citizen's TA 
(Transportation Agreement) 97ZH.  Citizens purchased 23,175 MMBtu to apply to 
this imbalance.  For the May invoice, we need to subtract this amount from 
usage.  Enter the volume into the area where we show transportation by others 
to the citygate.  This is logical as we otherwise would have to transport 
this gas in ourselves.

After this trade, the TA imbalance on 97ZH will be 30,688 MMBtu.  ENA is 
responsible for this imbalance.  It is my understanding that future 
imbalances will go to the 97ZH OBA rather than the TA.  Therefore, this 
current TA imbalance will be there until it is eliminated.

Call me with any questions.

Chris

I bought the following gas today from Enron:

1. Nov 01 - Mar 02, 2500 MMBtu/day @ CG for $11.86
2. Jul 03 - Jun 04, 2500 MMBtu/day @ Malin for $5.05
3. Nov 03-Mar04, 1000 MMBtu/day @ Malin for $5.13

I'll update you on the status of reaching our hedging goals soon.

Raveen, I'll get you the paperwork once I get it from Enron.

For your information--

Eric Thode, the Director of Public Relations for Enron, sent the email below 
to let us know that after a lot of discussion with the legal department, the 
decision was made to retain our company name of Enron North America, while 
the offices of Dave Delainey and John Lavorato will use Enron Americas.  Eric 
suggested that if we have ordered any business cards or stationery with Enron 
Americas that we re-order and use Enron North America.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

Stop the presses....I just received new information regarding the name 
change.  We have decided to keep everyone as Enron NOrth America or Enron 
South America.  The only people who will use Enron Americas are Dave Delainey 
and John Lavorato.  Hope this does not cause a problem.  If it does, please 
call me to discuss.  I'm sorry for the incorrect information a week or so ago.

adopted family a very happy holiday!   I noticed some of the cards did not 
say sizes.  The mother wears size 10 in clothes and 6 1/2 in shoes.  Kassi 
wears a size 10 in girls' clothes and size 2 1/2 in shoes.  Josh wears a size 
10 in boys' clothes and a size 2 1/2 in shoes.
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                              
Also - Please raid your kitchen for extra cans of food or other 
non-perishable items.  If we each bring in three items, our family will be 
well fed this holiday season!  

This is also a great way to teach your children about giving.  Let them help 
with the shopping, or even donate part of their allowance to the cause.  

Thanks for your help in making this holiday season bright for people who are 
less fortunate than ourselves.

If you have questions about gifts, let me know.  Thanks.  Teri Whitcomb X 
7794.

Ken:

Please take a look at this deal summary sheet.  As we discussed, our goal is 
to come up with a structure that we can use for all of our "pool" sales 
behind SoCal and PG&E.  CAn you get with the key folks and see if they like 
the approach and to set the index premiums and discounts?

Talked to TWPL today - they will try to structure something we can work with 
(Citizens and PNM deals).  Will advise as soon as I hear something.

The person that directs their strorage efforts will be at the same conference 
with me. I'll talk to her then.

Dan, thanks.  I will review the contract changes later today or tomorrow.
And thank you for the response on the resolution.  I've heard that this item
will be presented to the council for adoption on March 12.  That's the
earliest date.  I will coordinate with our staff on other matters that need
attending to get this done.  Thanks for your help.  Grant Kolling.

  Grant,
       I have incorporated the language you provided to me in
the attached
  document.  I have been informed by the Corporate Secretary's
office that
  they will issue a Certificate of Incumbency showing that the
person
  executing the contract for ENA is authorized to execute
contracts for ENA.
  No other party signs as to form or terms, however, the
officer executing
  for ENA will require that the deal person and I initial on
the line next to
  his signature.  I have reviewed the proposed draft
resolution.  ENA will
  accept the enacted resolution and will not require that the
City Attorney
  issue an opinion.  If the attached contract is acceptable,
please print off
  2 originals, have them approved, signed and forward to me
for ENA's
  approval and signature.  Once the contract is fully
executed, I will return
  one fully executed original to you for the City's file.

I wouldn't spend a bunch of time on them.  Originally, the guy calls me up 
and says...you know we are looking to put in a gas turbine cogen and would 
like to know if Enron is interested in working with us......the thing 
is....the oilfield can't really pay anything for the steam....are you 
interested?

Yea thanks for the heads up Kimbo,

Black Hills wanted to get on EOL to look at pricing but apparently they can't 
get read only access like we can (they need to put up credit).  Anyway they 
got access through Enserco.

Did that Texaco lead we talked about ever get anywhere?  Let me know.

Kim,

As promised, here are all the files I have on California entities' gas 
assets/contracts.  I have summarized what they are below.  Some of the data 
is old; however, I think most of it largely reflects current usage, etc.....



1.  GS_ACCRD:  Palo Alto gas load summary.
2,  SMUD Assets & Load
3.  CA-Power-Plants:  summary of all generation assets in California
4   DWP Gas Assets:  Summary of gas Transport Assets & Contracts

Dear Mr. Gore:

I am completely appalled at your behavior in all your "on behalf of the
people"
efforts.  The people have spoken and been counted twice by a computerized
process.  Now you have fought to pick and select certain counties in which
to
hand count and "further allow the people to have a voice".  The voice you
want
to hear can be created through your legal manipulations, which by the way,
you
learned well through your boss over these past few years (great job on
copying
his character, sir).  But the genuine voice of the people has already been
heard.  And since it wasn't the voice YOU wanted to hear, now is being
overruled
by your political ploys.

I have always been so proud of America.  I've lived overseas for graduate
work
and travel frequently overseas for the work I do.  But now, sir, I am
ashamed.
You have shown complete lack of integrity and character.  You do not care,
sir,
about this country.  You clearly care much more about your obtaining this
office.  You do not care, sir, about the voice of the people, but rather
that
the right voices be heard and all others squelched.  I am ashamed of you
and
find this completely a disgrace to the office you are so bitterly and
petulantly
fighting for and a disgrace to the nation.  Our America was built on
integrity,
character and honor.  You sir, have gutted that foundation.

Do you recall the phrase "God's Country" -- it still is, sir.  And you
someday
will have to discuss this with Him directly.  He also favors truth and
justice.
And I'm not sure your attorney's will be available to help you rewrite His
definitions quite as well as you've rewritten America's.

Mr. Gore, you are NOT a man to lead this country.  And you've proven that
so
very clearly in your actions over this election.  Shame on you, sir.

And that's "a voice of the people" for you

(Downey, CA)




CAPACITY FORUM

The need for expanded gas infrastructure, and in particular expanded gas 
pipeline transportation capacity, to serve the market in Southern California 
is an important subject that is receiving increasing attention.? SoCalGas 
believes it is an appropriate time to begin a dialog on this important issue, 
and to describe SoCalGas' view of the expansion options that exist on its 
system.

??????? To begin this process, SoCalGas will be conducting a Pipeline 
Capacity Forum on Wednesday, March 14th .? The forum will take place at 
SoCalGas' Energy Resource Center (ERC), located at? 9240 E. Firestone Blvd., 
Downey beginning at 1:00 P.M. and concluding at 4:00 P.M.? Refreshments? will 
be provided and the dress code will be business casual.? For a map to the 
ERC, visit our website below.

this meeting. This invitation is to being extended to Energy Service Provider 
and Contracted Marketers in SoCalGas' programs.

Lad Lorenz, Director Capacity Operations & Planning, will make the 
presentation.? The basic agenda for the meeting will be to discuss three 
topics:

The current status of operations on the SoCalGas' system.
The outlook for operations on the SoCalGas' system for the balance
of this year and through next winter.
The need for, and opportunities for expansion of the SoCalGas
backbone transmission system.

Subject: PPL Proposal


Gentlemen,

I tried to reach both of you late in the evening, but was unsuccessful.  I
will be traveling starting at 7 am Las Vegas time back to NO.  I have a brief
layover in Phoenix and will try to contact you.

Initial reaction to our proposal during the day was that it looked pretty
good.  This I got from Terry Crupi.  At that time Terry had not seen the
proposal, but was relaying what he had gotten from Barbara Veety back in
Allentown. In the early evening I met with John Baileys, Terry Crupi, and Joe
Cammarano of PPL.  At that meeting they expressed concern for the reservation
charge and floor, especially since the Citizens' TW contract has no
alternative market.  I asked if a cap would help ease their concerns and they
said that they did not think so.  They are really struggling with the
reservation charge as we have currently proposed it.  They agree that we
should at a minimum recover all of our fixed pipeline fees in a reservation
charge.  We did not have a chance to get into discussions about other
potential cost that would be appropriately placed in the reservation charge.

They would prefer a pure index based deal and could agree to a load factor of
about 80%, but indicated that they could live with some monthly reservation
fee based upon the monthly index, but we did not get into much detail on
exactly how that would work.

Perhaps the biggest issue that came out of this meeting is that they do not
believe that the SoCal Border is the appropriate index.  They believe that
the PG&E City Gate is more reflective of what the market price is.  They
claim that the SoCal point reflects the El Paso cuts.

In a passing comment John Baileys indicated that they have gotten a number of
 proposals that are attractive on both El Paso and TW.

John Baileys wants to do something with Citizens and is interested in a term
that would go for a least 2 years.  I ask if going through September 03 had
appeal and he responded affirmatively.  He also said that a provision that
allowed for available capacity to move up or down would be acceptable.

PPL wants to keep this process on a fast track, as do we.

The next steps:

1) PPL will provide a counter proposal on Monday.

2) Chris, what insight can you provide on the index issue.  I do not have
much history on that point, but on Friday of last week PGE City Gate was
$9.08 while SoCal Border was $10.90.  What are the historical prices for PGE?
 What are the drivers for the price differences between PGE and SoCal?  Is
the PGE index mature?  I have not followed it.  Is it a more appropriate
index for TW?

Hopefully we can catch up in the morning from Phoenix.

John

Subject: smurfit stone

Tracy,

Smurfit is trying to do one of two things and maybe a combination of the 
two.  They want to buy Cal 01 & 02 (Mid-c) for $100 flat.  Right now, prices 
are about $144.  They are also considering shuting down their plant, similar 
to Kaiser, and selling us their power contract back for Cal 01- prices right 
now are about $170.  This would book out our previous sale to them for cal 
01.   I am not familiar with their contracts or credit.  If they do 
something, they might want to do it today.  What do I need to do to be 
prepared to transact. And how do I find out about their contracts?

Thanks for your help.

Kim

  Rationale


    Debt reduction, cost cutting, and increased sales have brought El Paso=
=20
Electric Co. back toward
    investment-grade benchmarks. The company has exceeded debt-reduction=20
targets and expects debt to be
    about 50% of total capital by 2002. If sales continue to grow at even=
=20
one-half the historical 3% to 4% per year,
    cash flow interest coverage should improve to 3.5 times by then. Still,=
=20
the ratings on El Paso Electric continue to
    reflect the company=01,s high leverage, dependence on nuclear power, hi=
gh=20
fixed costs, and high rates.=20

    The company borrowed heavily to fund its 15.8% interest in the Palo Ver=
de=20
nuclear plant, which supplies 50% of
    the utility=01,s power. The plant=01,s past operating problems and cont=
inued=20
structural problems add some risk to the
    company=01,s already weak financial profile. Most importantly, customer=
s in=20
the generally low-income service
    territory fought against rate increases needed to recover the nuclear=
=20
investment, helping to put El Paso Electric
    in bankruptcy. A settlement signed with Texas customers in 1995 allowed=
=20
the company to keep a $25 million
    rate increase implemented in 1994, permitted accelerated depreciation o=
f=20
generation and transmission assets,
    and froze rates until 2005 in exchange for extending the El Paso Electr=
ic=20
franchise.=20

    In 1998, the company agreed to reduce rates--mainly residential--in New=
=20
Mexico and Texas, bringing them
    more in line with Southwestern averages. By the time retail competition=
=20
comes to either state (2002), El Paso
    Electric will have a fairly competitive cost structure which should all=
ow=20
them to retain retail customers. By that
    time, El Paso Electric will have separated its assets into a regulated=
=20
transmission and distribution business
    and an unregulated electricity generation business, as required by New=
=20
Mexico and Texas law. Costs incurred
    to effect this change will be recovered in a competitive transition=20
charge. Stranded costs (accrued charges
    related to generating plant costs which would have been recovered in a=
=20
regulated market) will be recovered over
    a five-year transition period in New Mexico. In Texas, the rate=20
settlement allowed El Paso to recover those costs
    through accelerated depreciation over the 10-year period of the=20
settlement agreement.=20

    In the wholesale market, El Paso successfully renegotiated contracts wi=

the Comision Federal de
    Electricidad, the national utility of Mexico, to supply peaking capacit=

Chris,

this looks good to me.  Stephanie is checking with Transwestern to see what 
their parking/lending fees would be for weekends, just for an idea.  I am 
also talking to the desk.  I will keep you posted.

Kim:

Please review and add anything you want and return.

John/Sean:

A few thoughts on the Griffith deal:

1.  Term:  PPL indicates they want to do the deal through 2003.  That is 
really 2003 - 2004 as it incldues Nov - Mar.  Extension until this time might 
require extension of our underlying deal.  This would be OK with us.
2.  Character of service:   The text indicates that PPL would have the right 
to request deliveries be made to an alternqate point on TW.  Why would they 
want this?  This could be a problem if we know the gas wouldn't flow as we 
would shut in puchases.  We would like to make this on a mutually acceptable 
basis.
3.  Pricing:  Does the reservation cahrge include variable transport?  I 
think that is what we proposed.  If not, then the Commodity rate flow needs 
to include the variable cost of  transport plus fuel.
4.  Conditions:  Noms must be in at 8:00 am.  This is very important and the 
a deal killer.  We need time to manage the position.  Also, the weekend issue 
needs to be addressed.  As we have discussed, weekends trade as the same 
quantity each day.  If they want to vary the daily amoount during the weekend 
and make Sunday higher than Sat or Monday, that is fairly ewaasy to deal 
with.  If they want to have lower takes on Sunday, this is more difficult ad 
increases costs.  We might be able to craft a solution to this however.

Sean/John,
We'd like to thank you for puttting together this offer for bundled supply to
our Griffith facility.  We are very agreeable to the structure and general
framework that you have laid out.  We did make a few modifications however and
you can find them in the attached redlined version of your proposal.  We will
available to discuss this proposal with Citizens.

Thanks

Terry

Kim
?
Wanted to follow up with yesterday's emails when you get in  this morning.
Let's address:
1)??? Pricing for rolling contract forward on a  month-to-month basis until 
changes are made to the way SoCal Edison purchases  power.
2)??? Pricing for contracting for all of the  other sites on an Index plus 
cost for a one year term and leaving the LA Vernon  site to roll 
month-to-month.
3)????What exactly are the penalties that  Enron is subject to should LA 
Vernon cause Enron to be out of balance for the  day?? What are the options 
we need to present to SSCC to address this issue  in a contract?
4) ??? The Irvine location.? When we first  spoke, Jason was involved with 
this location.? I had stated that I thought  they would be better off on 
tariff.? Due to the recent closing (December  2000) of the core program to 
customers with the exception of those whose  suppliers leave the market, this 
option is now not available.? Jason  mentioned doing a long term fixed deal.? 
This decision needs to be  addressed by SSCC corporate and the plant.? We 
will provide the costs to  SSCC corporate for this customer and decide on 
pricing from there.
5)??? Set up a conference call for the  beginning of next week with John 
Ewing at the LA Vernon site to discuss power  opportunities after August 2001.
?
Thanks, hope you had a great night anyway!
Lynn

 <<Book2.xls>> Kim. This is a view of a gas customer in our service
territory. Forecasted load over the next ten years, to the nearest thousand
MMBTU.  Let me know how you like to quote something like this. (To the
nearest thousand or five thousand.)  I want to give these guys full
requirements contract to their meter with a take or pay amount with whatever
imbalance met at spot index prices.  I am leaning toward using the low
forecast (thinking gas prices may go down in the long term.)  How would you
like to proceed on this?  Mike.

P.S. I only gave you the other forecasts in case you thought it would be a
good idea to go another way.  They are for information, not action.

PPS Please confirm receipt of this.

Dan,

Per the request of Jay Williams, attached please find a credit worksheet for 
a draft Enfolio Master Firm Purchase and Sale Agreement between ENA and 
Sacramento Municipal Utility District.  Please note that there are tiered 
collateral threshold and third-party cross default matrices.  Additionally, 
the attachment contains a second sheet elaborating on the Enron Corp. 
guaranty amount as well as a Compliance Letter as an additional CP Event of 
Default.

Shari Stack is working on the draft EEI Master Power agreement as well as the 
ISDA Master Swap agreement.  Please contact Shari Stack should you need 
clarification to the legal terms in the contract in order to ensure 
consistency across all three trading agreements.

I am also available should you have any questions pertaining to credit.

Regards,
Tracy

In This Issue:

* Third World or Third Rate?  We compare California's regulatory
system to Argentina's and find the latter's to be far superior.  Despite the
fact that American consultants played a substantial role in designing superb
regulatory systems for many Latin American countries, the lessons were not
well-applied at home.

* Energy Technology News:  A very busy week, highlighted by events
surrounding the power "crisis" in California and the Pacific Northwest.  Our
news summary and analysis begins on page 10.

* Energy Technology Stock Performance Tables

Prometheus Unbound:  Navigating the Structural Revolution in Electric Power,
will be back from the printer on Monday.  To be sure you receive a copy,
email us to request one.  (While the report is information-packed, at 330
pages we don't recommend it as a stocking stuffer.  Reading it might
alleviate the holiday blahs, especially if you're snowed in).

I just spoke with Kim and she updated me that her credit manager is very
satisfied with the creditworthiness of United Technologies (he thoroughly

CalPeak Power, LLC is a project company and is now a wholly owned subisdiary
of Untited Technologies Corporation (NYSE: UTC).  UTC information is
available at www.utc.com, and from the commercial rating services.

It is not invisioned that CalPeak will benifit from an absolute gurantee
from UTC; however, some credit suport mechanism will be built into the
project and into the fuel supply agreements.

Kim,
 This appears a little too iffy.  Please get with SCGC to find out the notice 
period. If it is greater than 10 days then we will change our language to the 
greater notice period.  If less, we will leave our notice period at 10 days 
prior to the month.  Please call if you would care to discuss.

Dan,

Instead of saying that the customer has just 10 days written notice to get 
out of the deal, we should add something to this effect - "subject to the 
monthly deadline established by Southern California Gas Company for 
terminating authorized marketer arrangements."

Let me know if you have any quesitons - 503-464-3826 or cell 503-805-2117.

Kim:

Here is another one.  We have a deal with this muni - Eastern New Mexico Gas 
Company.  The price is Permian plus $05/MMBtu plus transport.  Deliveries are 
on TW.  The deal is expiring 4/30/01.  John Mattics is the contact 
(505/355-2468).  He called me yesterday to see if we were interested in 
extending the deal.  The desk likes the deal as it gives them some 
flexibility on TW (I am not sure exactly what the value is there, but I think 
Janie likes the deal).  Can you check with Tori or Janie and see if they want 
to extend the deal?  Is the price OK?  Also, what is your fax number....I 
will fax you the contract.

Dan, I offer my apologies once again for the delayed response.  It would be
nice if the California energy crisis would evaporate the away gas vaporizes
under normal atmospheric conditions, so that my work load could ease
dramatically.  But, no such luck.

With respect to your modifications to 4.2(iv)(b), 4.2(v), (4.2((vi), the
definition of "Act", the changes to "Arbitration Disputes to be Arbitrated",
they are acceptable.  However, at the risk of being a nitpicker, the word
"parties" in the language added to the "Arbitration Disputes to be
Arbitrated" paragraph should read "Parties."

Also, on or before the Effective Date, it would be appreciated if the City
could receive a list of the initial contact staff members of Enron who are
located on the trade floor.

For your information, the certified copy of the resolution no. 8040, adopted
March 12, 2001 by the city council, authorizing the city manager to sign the
Enfolio contract, will be delivered in the very near future.  I could fax to
you as soon as I get a fax number.  Please omit the draft resolution and the
deleted opinion of counsel in the final dispatch to me.  If the red-line and
strike-out changes [introductory paragraph, 4.2(iv)(b), 4.2(v) and (vi),
Act, Arbitration Disputes to be Arbitrated] could be removed, that would be
great.

The City has another inquiry.  The OFO language on page 2 of Appendix "1"
suggests that Enron is not responsible for OFO-related charges if it doesn't
receive properly or timely notice of an OFO condition.  Is this so?
Further, under what conditions would the City be required to give Enron
notice of an OFO?  Finally, EFOs are not addressed in this contract.  Do the
words "or other order or notice from a Transporter" in the Operational Flow
Orders paragraph contemplate EFOs?

I'm optimistic that we can wrap this up pretty soon.  Look forward to your
response to this e-mail.  Thanks, Grant.

Grant,
     Sorry for the delay in responding to your additional inquiries.
     7.   Re 4.2(iv)(b) - I would propose the clause to read:  "(b) file a
petition or otherwise commence, authorize or acquiesce in the commencement
of a proceeding or cause under any bankruptcy or similar law of the
protection of creditors, or have such petition filed against it and such
proceeding remains undismissed for 30 Days, provided if a petition is filed
against the Affected Party and the  Affected Party is actively pursuing all
steps to have such proceeding dismissed and provides the other party with
reasonable documentation supporting its actions to cause such proceeding to
be dismissed, then such Affected Party shall have an additional 30 Days to
effectuate such dismissal,"
     8.   Re 4.2 (v) and 4.2 (vi) -  "20 or more Gas Days" is acceptable.
     13.  I will change the definition of "Act" as you suggest.
     21.  I propose that language be added whereby the parties shall first
attempt to settle the matters to be resolved by the use of binding
Arbitration by mon-binding mediation and if that does not resolve the issue
to the satisfaction of the parties, such matter shall thereafter be
resolved by the use of binding Arbitration.  Is this an acceptable
resolution?
     22.  We cannot agree to any list of parties who are authorized to
enter into transactions under the contract.  Our position is that whoever
answers the trading phone during trading hours is authorized to bind the
company.  However, we will provide the City with an initial contact list of
the people on the trading floor whom the city can contact as of the date
the contract is signed; however, the persons who are authorized to enter
into a transaction with the city will not be limited to the initial contact
list.  Of course, the city could always attempt to contact someone on the
initial contact list.  Will an initial contact list be acceptable?

Please let me have your thoughts concerning the above.
                                                   Dan.

Agreement






Dan, please accept my apologies for replying so late.  I was out of town
again, and am back at trying to complete 5+ days of work within 3 days.

Thanks for accepting a lot of our requests.  Let me follow up with a couple
of additional inquiries.

7.  Re 4.2(iv), please suggest language as you've indicated in sentence 2.
Anything along the lines you've proposed likely will be agreeable.

8.  Re 4.2(v) and (vi).  How about 20 days?

13. Definition of "Act."  I suggest you refer to Article 11, sections 5 and
9 of the California Constitution, to be more specific.  Section 3 is not
regularly cited as the line of authority to the best of my knowledge,
though
I can see how the language could lead  one to cite it.

21.  In California, the concept of binding mediation is not recognized, if
I
have understood our outside counsel at prior mediations in which I've
participated.  Mediation is non-binding.  As a practical matter, it can
cost
almost as much in terms of time, money and effort to proceed to mediation,
but the "rules of engagement" are not as tight as are found in arbitration.
We avoid the rigid procedures.  I believe Enron should consider this
approach at times.  Having gone through a couple, I would not recommend to
my client that we would proceed any further once the mediator makes a
proposal that's acceptable to the parties.  The cost of arbitration is not
worth it.  That's why we in California tend to prefer mediation to
arbitration.

22.  I have to insist on behalf of my client that we assemble some list.
Surely, Enron can submit a list of people that will be initially approved
to
engage in authorized transactions.  We can do the same.  We've had an
unfavorable experience with another Texas-based
energy company regarding the scope of its representative's authority.  We
don't want to litigate the issue of due authority.  That list would help
It's not a matter of the city claiming the authority to back out of the
contract, because someone arguably didn't have the authority.  There are a
ton of cases which would make it extremely difficult to make that claim.

Thanks.  Grant.

>>
          (See attached file: 2001-002ctr.doc)

          Grant,
               I have reviewed your requested changes and have made
the changes which
          do not require explanation or clarification.  Those changes
are reflected
          in the above document.  Let me go over your list of items:
               1.   I have deleted the word "DRAFT".
               2.   I have left a blank for the date within the month
of March 2001
          when the contract would be executed by the City.
               3.   I have changed the word "may" to "shall".
               4.   Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity does not fit
in a
          Deficiency Default, it is just the maximum quantity that can
be handled by
          a party at a particular point.  I do not think their is an
omission.
               5.   I have added the word "reasonable".
               6.   The procedue for how the Termination Payment is
determined is
          provided, if the City disagrees with the method and values
provided in the
          statement and is unable to convince the Company to revise,
the statement,
          then the issue is to be resolved in arbitration.  At the
point that a
          Termination Payment calculation is necessary, a long drawn
out period
          should not be necessary to attain closure.
               7.   We need to limit the duration to 30 days,  neither
party should
          be required to wait 60 days before it could accelerate the
other party's
          obligations under the Contract.  We might be able to add
language to extend
          the period if we had some documentation stating the steps
that a party was
          pursuing to cause the proceeding to be dismissed and the
other party was
          otherwise kept whole from a credit exposure.
               8.   I have kept the 30 days because 5 days is too
short a period.
          During a holiday period, one scheduling error could cover
the entire
          period.  Article 3 has language which provides a remedy for
a party if a
          scheduling default extends for more than 5 days during any
month.
               9.   The reason is because Enron Corp. is the rated
entity and no
          separate rating applies to ENA.
               10.  I have changed "a" to "the"
               11.  I have eliminated the  60 day limitation on the
duration of an
          event of Force Majeure.
               12.  This merely addressed the possibility of a
imbalance amount being
          due when a pipeline aggregates imbalances using multiple
points, and the
          language would allocated the payment based on the amount of
the imbalance
          that a particular party may have caused.  I think the
language is clear as
          written.
               13.  The definition of Act was one of the items that I
had requested
          that you review and complete as necessary so that all
appropriate statutes
          were referenced.  I am still waiting for your language.  I
started filling
          it in using language that had been provided by the City.
               14.  I added the word "reasonable".
               15.  I have made the requested change relating to
GAAAP.
               16.  This is a late payment provision and as such a
believe that the
          provision should be more than a party's rating, as such I
have kept the 2%
          over prime language.
               17.  These amounts were determined by the credit group
and any change
          needs to be discussed with that group.  BBB-  is considered
investment
          grade and I understand that Enron Corp.'s rating is BBB.
ENA is not a
          rated entity and that is why the language relates to Enron
Corp.'s rating.
               18.  The elimination of the opinion of counsel did not
change the
          requirements relating to the representations that we expect
the City to
          have made.  If the City cannot make these representations,
then we need to
          know that before we execute the Contract.
               19.  I have added the word "reasonable".
               20.  The party that has the Transport Agreement with
the Transporter
          should have the legal right to obtain the information based
on its
          contract.
               21.  It is our position that any dispute be arbitrated.
We can agree
          to meditation if we can make the outcome binding on the
parties.  I am
          willing to discuss any changed language that you might care
to offer.
               22.  We have found that personnel of both our Company
and that of our
          Customers change so rapidily that the list is not workable
and merely
          allows a party to back out of transactions it does not like
on the basis
          that the person who agreed to such transaction was not on
the list.
          Therefore , we object to any listing of approved parties who
can transact.
          We believe that each party should be responsible for the
actions of its
          employees and should stand behind any transactions that
those parties may
          enter into pursuant to the terms and provisions of the
Contract.

               I will be out of the office on Friday, but will be in
all next week if
          you care to discuss any of these matters.

Subject:     RE: Enfolio Master Firm

Purchase/Sale Agreement






           <<0071988 RESO Enron.doc>>

          Dan:

          First, I've attached the proposed resolution which
authorizes the City
          Manager to execute the Enfolio agreement.

          More importantly, I need to inform you that our senior
management has
          reviewed the referenced contract; I have been asked to
present additional
          changes to the agreement for Enron's consideration and to
raise questions
          about certain of its terms and conditions.

          Let me start from page 1, top to bottom, and proceed to the
end of the
          exhibits.

          1.  There is the word "DRAFT" above the title of the Enfolio
agreement
          which
          should be deleted.

          2.  The introductory paragraph, line 5, should not contain
the words "1st
          of
          January, 2001."  It should be left blank, until the parties
have signed the
          contract.  Otherwise, the City will be in breach as of the
date it signs
          the
          contract, because Article 2, section 2.1 requires the City
to proffer the
          to-be-approved-by-Council resolution as of 1/1/01.

          3.  Article 2, Section 2.4, line 2.  The City (Customer)
wants Enron
          (Company) to confirm every recorded telephonic Transaction,
as defined.
          Therefore, the City requests the word "may" should be
changed to "shall."

          4.  Article 3, Sections 3.1 and 3.2, first sentence:
Buyer's Requested
          Quantity refers to the DCQ or MaxDQ.  Seller's failure to
Schedule the
          Buyer's Requested Quantity shall constitute a Seller's
Deficiency Default.
          How does a Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity fit into a
Seller's
          Deficiency Default if the Buyer's Requested Quantity does
not include a
          Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity?  What is the reason
for the
          omission?

          5.  Article 4, Section 4.1, lines 15 and 23:  Line 23 refers
to "reasonable
          attorneys' fees" yet line 15 refers to "attorneys' fees."
To be internally
          consistent, line 15 should say "reasonable attorneys' fees."

          6.  Section 4.1, right hand column, lines 3-4.  A statement
showing the
          determination of the Termination Payment will be prepared.
It's unclear
          whether the City is entitled to review and challenge the
determination
          before a dispute is referred to arbitration.  The City
should be entitled
          to
          receive a copy of the determination and to question it
before it is
          obligated to pay the Termination Payment.  Please clarify,
or permit the
          City to exercise these rights.

          7.  Section 4.2(iv) specifies that a Triggering Event will
exist if a
          bankruptcy petition is undismissed within 30 days.  Is this
(under
          bankruptcy laws) the minimum period of time within which one
may seek
          dismissal of a bankruptcy petition?  Please refer to the 11
USC section
          that
          backs up this provision, or change to 60 days.

          8.  Section 4.2(v) and (vi):  Please change "30 days" to "5
days."  The
          City
          is concerned with the number of days that Enron may be
permitted to fail to
          Schedule before a Triggering Event is triggered by Enron.

          9.  Section 4.2(ix):  this language discusses a default by
Enron Corp.
          (ENA's parent?), but no mention is made of ENA's default in
this regard?
          Please explain.

          10. Section 4.5, line 4:  Is "a Company" supposed to refer
to "the Company"
          ?

          11. Article 5.  The City is uncomfortable with the force
majeure provision
          as drafted.  It states that the parties must perform even if
a FM event
          (earthquake) would prevent either or both parties from
performing with the
          60-day period stated therein.  There is no such limitation
under California
          law in the absence of a contract provision to the contrary.

          12.  Article 7, Section 7.2:  Could Enron translate the last
sentence?  We
          don't understand it.

          13.  Appendix "1":  Act:  Please explain why Section 3 is
referred to?

          14.  Appendix "1", Claims, line 4:  Please add "reasonable"
before
          "attorneys' fees.

           15.  Appendix "1", GAAP:  This should read: "GAAP means
generally accepted
          accounting principles, consistently applied, with respect to
Company, and
          governmental generally accepted accounting principles,
consistently
          applied,
          with respect to Customer."

          16.  Appendix "1", Interest Rate:  Please delete "two
percent over".  The
          City has a AAA bond rating, therefore, the  City believes
the 2% over prime
          should not apply to it.

          17.  Appendix "1", Material Adverse Change:  What does Enron
believe the
          City's Net Worth to be?  The $400 million threshold is
mentioned.  Also,
          what is ENA's bond rating?  Is "BBB-" an investment grade
rating?

          18.  Representations and Warranties:  Because we have agreed
that the
          opinion of counsel will not be required, the reps and
warranties are being
          deleted.  But the "Representations and Warranties" is
nevertheless included
          in the agreement.  Item (i) should be deleted, because the
City has not
          undertaken a court search as is our custom and practice
whenever we issue
          an
          opinion.  We would like to delete "and (vii) it is not ...
Party."

          19.  Operational Flow Orders, line 8:  Please add
"reasonable" before
          "attorneys' fees."

          20.  Financial Matters, line 8:  What is meant by "to the
extent it has a
          legal right of access thereto and/or ...etc."

          21.  Arbitration, Disputes to be Arbitrated.  We do not as a
matter of
          legal
          policy agree to arbitration, but we will mediate disputes.
Is Enron
          amenable to mediation?  This process is less formal and less
costly in my
          opinion.

          22.  Authority for Transactions.  Staff would like the
Agreement to include
          a list of employees for Company and Customer who are
authorized to trade on
          behalf of their employers.  Could a statement be added to
this section to
          this effect?  Then, we could attach the list(s) as an
Exhibit C.

          Thank you so much for considering these issues.  There are
others which I
          hope to receive from staff next week and which I will
forward to you for
          response.

          Look forward to hearing from you soon.  I will be out of
town after today
          until Wednesday, March 7.

          Sincerely,

          Grant Kolling

Kim and Barry -

I had a couple of thoughts with respect to our meeting yesterday on 
municipals.  It appears to me that with the California municipals especially, 
accellerating the entire sales process will be critical.  I'm thinking about 
how we can get in place as much of the required paper as possible prior to 
negotiating deal terms.  Much of the required documentation (proof of 
authority to transact, outside legal opinion, etc.) will be difficult to push 
until you are actually negotiating with these counterparties, as there won't 
be any incentive on their part to drive these issues.  However, from our end, 
we can prepare all of the required contracts prior to any meetings with these 
counterparties so that we don't lose any time on that front.

With that in mind, do you have a list of target counterparties that you will 
be attacking in the near term?  If so, please forward to me and I will begin 
the process of reviewing from a credit standpoint and putting together draft 
Master contracts to put in front of the counterparties.  It will take me some 
time to get through reviews/contracts/etc., but if you have a list of 
targets, I can at least get started.

If you have any thoughts on how I can help you develop some of this business, 
please let me know.


Thanks,

Jay

Kim, 

Here is the summary.  The bottom line is that by unwinding balance of 
February (2/20-2/28) and the rest of the deal (Mar '01-Jul '02) from a $3.74 
price to a $4.18 price nets Mesa a $.24 discount of the new Index deal (Aug 
'01-Jan '02)

To get them to a $.30 discount on the new Index deal, Mesa would need to 
raise the fix price on the current deal to $4.26.

Eric

Lynn,

Attached is a gas proposal that was submitted  to John Ewing at Smurfit
Stone Container Corporation on January 17, 2001 by  Chris Foster.? This is
an index proposal with the assumption that  Enron and Smurfit would
regularly enter into forward fixed price  transactions to hedge Smurfit's
cash flows.? Enron would be actively  assisting Smurfit Stone in making
forward price decisions by providing  insight into market fundamentals.

I can provide fixed price indicators  if you need.? Give me a call with  your
questions.

Thanks,

Kim:

Following our discussion of last Thur., we need to prepare the term sheet for 
Citizens. I want to focus on the TW deal first.  There are a number of things 
that I hope you can get from the desk by early afternoon my time, so we have 
time to do the term sheet.

I want to show them a structure that would give them right to call on gas 
each day.  What there be a demand charge?  What would be the Gas Daily 
adder?  High end of the range?  Mid point?  What would the demand charge be 
for mid-point of the range?  We would also compensate the desk to receive a 
demand charge equal to the full monthly cost of the lateral.  The desk should 
love that much of the structure.  Try to get some numbers from Janie.

 I have had numerous conversations with Citizens and TW.  TW will do the deal 
but want their liability limited to $140,000 year.  Citizens wants this 
liability increased to $1,000,000.  We could do this by buying insurance.  We 
might subcontract with TW to do this so the services deals is between ENA and 
Citizens. We would need to increase the demand charge to pay for this 
increase in laibility.

Once we know all our costs, we would bundle this together and then increase 
the demand charge for orig. 

Call me first thing on Monday

Group,

Just wanted to let you know that Anna will be handing out the December 
Coverage Metrics Sheets this afternoon.  She will also be collecting your 
November Coverage Metrics Sheets, which you should have filled out the 
"November Actual Column," representing how many times you talked with each 
counterparty during the month of November.

Thanks for your co-operation,
Stan

I have been told by Kim and Dan that the City is currently not authorized to 
trade in derivatives, but that the city council will vote on an authorizing 
resolution at an April meeting.

In terms of negotiation of the ISDA, we sent out a draft to them a few weeks 
ago, but I have heard nothing back.  We are requiring a legal opinion on the 
same form that we require other municipals to give for financial trading.

Dan- Have you looked into the authority of Palo Alto to buy and sell physical 
gas? 

Bob- I understand that you may be doing an ISDA with them. Have you looked 
into the authority issues yet? 

Thanks,

Shari -

Kim Ward is working with Rudwell Johnson (Credit) and Dan Hyvl (legal) to get 
authority and a master completed at Palo Alto - Can you coordinate with them 
because we need to get them an EEI?

Kim: 

As we discussed, you will be sending in the response to the SDG&E RFP due on 
Thursday morning at 6:00 am.  You can send the prices at the end of the day 
Tuesday as I have conditioned the offer as "subject to change for any reason 
by EPMI."   In our response, send  via e-mail, 2 documents.  These are 
attached.  Shari Stack prepared the red lined version of the EEI  contract.  
We tried to get SDG&E to discuss these proposed changes with us, but they 
have not called us back.  Tracy put the credit terms together some time ago 
so please check to see if these need to be revised.  If so, get aSHari to put 
the revised terms into the red lined version.  Our changes are fairly 
significant.  It is highly unlikely that they would agree to these terms 
prior to our responding to their RFP.  I want to send them prices anyway.  
This would be done by completing the Attachment A2 below.  Get prices from 
Mike and Matt.  

Thanks

Chris

Dear Fitness Center Members:

The Fitness Center staff is pleased that you have taken a positive step in 
improving your personal health and fitness.  The following information 
applies to those individuals who are beginning an exercise program for the 
first time or who are are renewing and exercise program after a lengthly 
layoff.

Many of us become overzealous when initiating an exercise program in 
anticipation of losing weight, toning up or getting fit.  We start out too 
aggresively only to lose our enthusiasm, or worse, create health problems 
and/or injuries that we are trying to avoid.

It is natural to expect results as quickly as possible. However, results will 
not occur overnight.  Attempting to counteract years of sedentary living in a 
couple of weeks is unrealistic and dangerous.  It takes time and continuous 
effort.

The most important concept to remember when starting a new exercise program 
is o begin safely, slowly and progressively.  Always go at your own pace- too 
much, too soon may be counterproductive.

Please take a moment to read the attached document to familiarize yourself 
with the guidelines for a safe and healthy exercise program.  If you have any 
questions or concerns, please contact either myself or any member of the 
fitness staff for assistance.

Joshua Wooten
Health and Fitness Specialist

In that case, it's just the SoCalGas core procurement charge (including
brokerage fee -- e.g. their March price was $7.404/dth) that we need to be
comparable to or beat.  We have more control over the transmission rates so 
the
price from Enron we are looking for is just for the commodity at the border.
I'll provide you with our monthly WACOG that customers are charged as the
commodity portion of their bill versus SoCalGas' core procurement charge.  
I'll
be sending you the data today.

Ahoy, 
?
We already have 11 people confirmed for the Aruba cruise, and  lots who have 
expressed interest in going; the 20% group discount is a given.  So, if you 
want to join us on the Oct. 28-Nov 3 cruise on the Legacy be sure and  let me 
know while we still have group space. 
?
For those of you who have paid your deposit, they are already  turned in to 
Windjammer, and your cabins are secure. Those of you who have told  me that 
you won't be able to join us, I hope you don't mind that I included you  in 
this post. If you have any friends who might want to join us, you'll have 
the  information. 
?
CANCELLATION POLICY
You can get a full refund of all moneys paid up until July  1.? 
>From July 1--Aug 1, if you cancel you pay a $45 penalty, and  are given 
cruise credit for the remaining to be used in the next two  years.
After Aug. 1, there is no refund. You can sell your space to  someone else, 
though. 
Total payment is due August 1. 
?
TO CONFIRM SPACE
1. E-Mail me at: gail@teleport.com? or
2. Phone me at: (541)765-4577 with your credit card  number? or
3. Send a check to PO Box 1723, Newport, Oregon,  97365.
The deposit for the cruise is $200. If you want Fare Share it  is an 
additional $100.
Let me know the following:
1. What type of cabin do you want? 
??? Commodore Doubles have full sized beds, and  are $900.?
????Standards have?bunks, and are  $800.
2. Do you want Fare Share? 
??? From which airport and which day do you  want to arrive in Aruba and 
depart ??? ??? from  Aruba?
??? Here are some samples of Fare Share Rates  round trip to Aruba:
??? ??? PDX?  $899
??? ??? GSO $649
??????? LEX?  $679
??? ??? SDF  ?$679
??? ??? PHL?  $679
??? ??? CVG?  $727
??? ??? SYR?  $679
??? If you arrive on Sunday and leave on  Saturday, or if Windjammer books 
two ??? ???  nights in a hotel for you, there is no deviation fee. But if you 
only stay one  night, ??? or deviate otherwise, there is a $35 deviation  fee.
3. Do you want trip insurance? It is $85.? 
??? We'll be way?south of the hurricane  belt, but you have to fly over it to 
get to ???  ??? ??? Aruba.? I highly recommend trip  insurance. 
4. Do you want me to make a hotel reservation for you with the  group? 
??? ??? ???  ??? ??? Windjammer's Hotel Dept. is still  negotiating with one 
hotel in Aruba, and it ???  ??? sounds like we'll get a much better rate as a 
group than  trying to book ??? ??? ???  ??? individually. So, in contrast to 
what I said earlier, if you  want a hotel room, let ??? ??? me know which 
night  to book for you. (Right now there is no need to send a ???  ??? 
deposit for the hotel.? If you choose to stay elsewhere  once you find out 
where ??? they put us, that is  fine.)
?
POLY REPO CRUISE
The Poly repo cruise is Nov. 4 through November 10, from St.  Lucia to St. 
Maarten. She will be coming out of dry dock with a whole new top  deck, and a 
reconfigured bar area. We only have 6 confirmed so far on the Poly,  but 
quite a few are interested, and we still have plenty of time yet to find 9  
more passengers. Deck cabins are $880, Standard Cabins are $720, and the BQ 
is  $560.? Fare Share rates are the same as to Aruba, but they have an  
additional $35 fee because you fly into St. Lucia and out of St. Maarten.  
?
The bad news for those who want to do both weeks, is that  there are no 
direct flights from Aruba to St. Lucia, and you have to go through  San Juan 
to get there. The fare for that leg is close to $400.?  
?
The good news for those who want to do both weeks and have  Aadvantage 
Frequent Flyer miles, is that you can fly from your home to Aruba,  then up 
to St. Lucia, and then home from St. Maarten, all for 30.000 miles, and  
$255. 
?
Hope to see a whole bunch of you next Fall!
Gail

I wonder if you can get the scoop here.  Why would Tucson sell to Phelps 
Dodge at a below market?  Are they doing it for jobs, etc.?  Let's discuss.

16:36 29Mar2001 TEP, Phelps Dodge Sign Long-Term Power Contract <UNS.N>

TEP, Phelps Dodge Sign Long-Term Power
Contract
   TUCSON, Ariz.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 29, 2001--Tucson Electric
Power Co. (TEP) has signed a five-year wholesale contract to supply 60
megawatts of electricity to Phelps Dodge Energy Services.
   The contract calls for TEP, beginning in March of 2001, to supply
the power at all times except during the company's peak customer
energy demand periods from July through September of each year.
   TEP Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer James S.
Pignatelli said the contract is an important one for both companies.
"This agreement provides a comfort factor for Phelps Dodge as it plans
ahead for its energy needs," Pignatelli said. "And for TEP, the
contract provides a stable, profitable margin for five years and a
solid boost to our financial outlook in a volatile energy market."
   Pignatelli said the company expects the agreement to generate
revenues of about $30 million annually.
   The contract gives Phelps Dodge the option of receiving the power
at several of its operations outside TEP's service territory. Under
the contract, TEP also can interrupt delivery of power to Phelps Dodge
if the utility experiences significant loss of any electric generating
resources.
   Separate from this agreement, the Phelps Dodge Sierrita copper and
molybdenum mine south of Tucson is a TEP retail customer.
   TEP is the primary subsidiary of UniSource Energy Corp.
(NYSE: UNS), and Arizona's second-largest investor-owned electric
utility.

Kim,
 Please review this draft.  I have not modified any language from the Enfolio 
to that contained in the draft of their form of contract which you forwarded 
to me last week.  I will read their long form and see if it makes sense to 
include their language.  Remember, in their short form, they had language for 
short breaks which was slightly diffent from ours but with a little torture, 
we could have incorporated their language once we got over the hurdle that we 
can't agree to let them audit our contracts,  which means we could never show 
them what we got for the default quantity.

Kent,

Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical
natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into
transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a
year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully,
we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get
ready to transact.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing
by to help, too.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

I just opened the holiday card with the group photo.  Great picture.  It
shows how beautiful the weather is in Portland!  When our group used to do
pictures, we usually ended up looking into the sun - just like you.  We end
up squinting, but otherwise it makes a good picture.  Thank you for thinking
of me.  Be sure to show this to Bob Badeer since I do not have his email
address.  May God bless you all with a wonderful holiday season; and may we
all be exempt from refunds!

I have attached my latest version below.  I still have not located historical 
monthly index prices for AECO and PG&E City Gate.  However, in lieu of the 
index numbers I have dropped in the average historical daily prices for each 
month.  Please let me know if you think this is sufficient for your 
purposes.  Also, let me know if you need any other 
interpretations/representations of the historical data.

It looks like the Smurfit deal is a gas only deal.  Susan works for Summit a 
consulting firm representing Smurfit.  I sent you the RFP last week.  In 
addition to Smurfit they are looking for gas for several other accounts.  I 
would give all the others to EES and focus your time on Smurfit.

Susan,
 I have reviewed the contract form that you provided in November and have 
attempted to make the changes which would be required for Enron to utilize 
the form.  I believe that the red line document attached  should address a 
majority of the issues which  need to be changed.  Please review and give me 
you comments as to the suggested changes.

Kim, please find attached spreadsheet of our anticipated gas usage begining
in August of this year.  This plant is currently under development in
simple cycle configuration and will be converted to combined cycle
operation in the near future.  Its output, 48-60 MW will be sold to the
State of California through the water department.  Delivery point for gas
will be SDG&E city gate.

Please provide 1yr, 3yr, and 5yr price indications including firm capacity.
 At a later date we may want to discuss fixed transportation and a NYMEX
based float.

The Hanover Company, 12001 North Houston Rosslyn, Houston, TX 77086, is a
leader in oil field processing and compression services and is traded under
stock symbol HC.

Kim:

I would argue that the physical premium should actually be ($.012/MMBtu) as 
you are displacing gas that would have to be sold as indexed.  That said, we 
have never done it that way.  My thought is that you would simply do it at 
the swap offer and have no physical premium arguing that that approach still 
leaves the desk better off compared to a sale at minus .012.  You could book 
it as a physical sale with no phyisical premium.

Chris,

The deals I do with Tom Broderick, are these volumes priced at I-.012 as 
well, or when I fix the prices, do I need to add a new phys premium?

Although we will miss her greatly, both personally and professionally, we 
wish the best for Kim Ward who will be moving to Houston to be part of a new 
Gas Middle Marketing Group.  She will  be focusing on marketing physical and 
financial trading products to gas consumers in the Southwest and California.  
Kim was part of the first pioneering crew that moved to Portland to start-up 
our trading operation.  Her contributions have been tremendous.   Kim's last 
day in the Portland office will be Tuesday, December 19.

Barry,

Attached is a copy of the CPUC order changing the SRAC payment formula from 
SoCal to Malin.  Also attached is a diagram showing how we could structure a 
hedge for those QFs buying term gas at SoCal index (or simply sell SoCal 
priced at Malin).

As everyone is surely aware after last night's going away party, John Forney 
is heading back to Houston to trade the Short Term Entergy market.  Bill 
Williams III will be assuming responsibility for the Real Time desk and will 
report to Greg Wolfe.  There are three major areas of responsibility that 
Greg and Bill will be focussing on in 2001.  The first is the management of 
EPMI's physical power flows.  This entails checking out with counterparties, 
handling cuts, and ensuring that all of our risk and settlement systems 
reflect the proper information.  The second area is trading done by the Real 
Time group.  Each day, our Real Time desk combs the market looking for 
attractive trading opportunities.  The third area is the Services Desk.  The 
Services Desk provides scheduling and settlements services to customers who 
don't have the staff or systems to do it themselves.  We have seen our 
Services business grow dramatically this year.

Greg Wolfe will be ultimately responsible for the efforts of the Real Time 
desk and our Services business.  Les Rawson will continue in his role on the 
Services desk and will report to Greg.  Bill Williams will be responsible for 
the day to day operations of the Real Time desk.  Greg will continue to work 
closely with the middle market group and will maintain some of his coverage 
responsibilities.  Chris Foster will continue to manage the Middle Market 
group.

California=01,s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve=
ral=20
months.  Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We=
=20
want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.=
 =20
Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation=
=20
and our position on California energy issues.

What happened in California

The source of California=01,s current problem is as straightforward as supp=
ly=20
and demand.  California=01,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This incr=
eased=20
the demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory=20
restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So=
=20
demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The resul=
t,=20
predictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10=20
percent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.

In addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related=
=20
factors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state=01,s regulations=
=20
forced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for=
=20
power is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market=
=20
when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo=
ng=20
term, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  I=
n=20
California, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the=20
equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th=
e=20
most volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine=20
while the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat=
t=20
was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.

Second, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remain=
ed=20
in effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20
competition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa=
le=20
prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20
regulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.

In short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat=
ion. =20
Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new=
=20
generation from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile=
=20
spot prices.

At the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned=
=20
the state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w=
hich,=20
if adopted, would have averted the current crisis.

Enron=01,s Role

Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f=
ix=20
the problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20
politicians and the media.  Here are the facts:

? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the=
=20
state of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the=
=20
same market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a=20
market maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We ar=
e=20
interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc=
ts=20
for our customers.
? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from=
=20
the problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We=
=20
protected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.

You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20
power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on=
=20
the open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&turnback=018=
 of our=20
customers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:

? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20
market, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct=
ly=20
from the utilities.  This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20
allowing EES to access lower utility rates.
? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue =
to=20
receive the financial benefits of their contract prices.
? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them=
=20
with other energy-related products and services, including assistance in=20
reducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.

Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its=
=20
crisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron=20
continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western=
=20
power markets.  Enron=01,s primary business is managing risk for our custom=
ers=20
with solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more=
=20
demand for our products and services.

The Solution

The solution to California=01,s crisis is also straightforward.  In summary=
, the=20
state must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot mark=
et=20
and shore up the financial stability of the state=01,s utilities.

Increasing Supply

California=01,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing=
=20
short of Byzantine.  Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les=
s=20
than a year.  In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.  California simpl=
y=20
must streamline this process.  Ironically, while many of the regulations=20
generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the=
=20
regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and=20
displacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.  California can=
=20
have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new=20
facilities.

Reducing Demand

Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand. =
=20
They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail=
=20
market would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and deman=
d=20
at lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market=
.

Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market

In a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from=20
volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer=
=20
term, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the han=
ds=20
of the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market=
. =20
Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the=
ir=20
price risk.

Restoring the Financial Integrity of the State=01,s Institutions

The utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to=20
greater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to=
=20
arrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recov=
er=20
their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and=
=20
distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is=
=20
needed.

Just as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that=
,=20
while politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters=
=20
worse.  Price caps have been proposed.  They don=01,t work; have never work=
ed;=20
and they will not work here.  Price caps succeed only in creating shortages=
,=20
which then have to be allocated among competing users.  Imagine how=20
ineffectively the government would be in determining, for example, whether =
it=20
is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall=
ey=20
or Silicon Valley.  Price caps are a surefire way to make the current=20
shortage worse.

The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in=20
California.  There is no reason to believe, and every reason to doubt, that=
=20
the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in,=20
constructing, operating and maintaining assets.  This will also result in=
=20
California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power=20
generation -- which the private sector can do -- instead of education, road=
s=20
and other public goods -- which the private sector cannot do.

As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t=
he=20
crisis from the media, it=01,s important for you to know this:  We at Enron=
 will=20
continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real=20
solutions to the state.

Lynn,

On Friday I spoke to Jan at operations, Chris  Foster and Accounting. Not one
of them was aware of the potential of us not  being supplied with natural gas
in April. Jan already had our volumes bid and  scheduled. It a good thing
this whole thing was cleared  up.

Hi, Kim.

Finally had a chance to look over the term sheet.  Unfortunately, I won't be
in on Friday.  Can we talk about this on Monday?  Looks mostly okay; just
want to discuss some of the terms.  I assume this is mostly in accordance
with our agreement.  Also, there may be a few errors with the numbers...
Offhand: because of the losses on the PG&E pipe, our KRS will be
3944MMBtu/day at KRS.

Monday is a completely unfettered (meetingwise) day for me.  I'll be in at
7:30 PST.

Have a nice weekend.

-Steve

Steve,

Attached is a term sheet detailing how we would like to handle your gas
supply  for February, 2001. Once I get through the Feb crunch, I hope to
provide you with a similar proposal for March through the balance of the
year.

Please let me know if you have any questions or if you would like to
discuss any of the items in the term sheet.

Thanks,

Kim

Citizens has come back with some questions on the amendment you drafted.  I 
have discussed these changes with them and redrafted the agreement to adopt 
some of their ideas but in a manner to make it more acceptable to us.  This 
is attached.  Please review and edit this document and return to me so I can

Do we hold any material past due receivables for gas supply against specific

prospect of getting 15 cents on the dollar for old receivables and a 
mechanism in place for future QF payments, this might be a time to consider

Here's what you have to deal with at Mesa!  I'm gonna make one more run at 
this and she's alllllll yours.  Maybe we should meet in AZ some time in Feb., 
we can go see Jan, Hutchens, etc.  Does Tucson have any power shorts?  We're 
trying to sell a toll on LV-II and I thought they might be interested if they 
are short.

Subject: Today is January 24th





I am out of the office almost all day today; however, I wanted to let you 
know I
had a brief chat with Dave Plumb.  At this point, he does not think Enron is
offering us a good deal, mostly because the  -.30 is only on the half load and
not the total and originally in Deal One it was on the full load.  He did like
that the$4.25 had come down to $4.14.

I was set back a little by his next remark which was, "There is no hurry 
because
I want to take this to the Utilities Committee of Council and they don't meet
until next week."  I told him the numbers would change significantly if we
waited until February.  Again, he replied, "Jan, I want to take this to the
Utilities Committee anyway!!"  He also indicated about working within a range.
So probably tomorrow, I will put the pencil to the paper and try to make
something presentable for him to take to the Utilities Committee.  It will 
have
to be in layman's terms and easy to follow numbers because these guys don't 
deal
in this every day.  I am a little miffed that he thinks and wants to go to the
Committee first.  We have never done that before.  Usually we just get a deal
worked up, present it in an affirmative manner to the City Manager and he buys
off on it.  So we will see.  He is the boss!!

I am telling you all of this because I will probably be asking for your help 
to
make this in a presentable manner.

Talk to you later today or tomorrow for sure.  I am in the office all day
Thursday.

Thanks Dave,

Jan

Dan, thanks for your help on this. I've forwarded the latest to John Ulrich
for signature.  In case I forget, please remind me to send you a certified
copy of the resolution.  I know it's been signed by all, including the
mayor.  The PG&E bankruptcy has taken up a lot of my attention, and I may
not remember to ensure that staff gets a copy to send with the executed
contract.  Grant Kolling.

Grant,
     One last change,  Kim Ward agreed to reduce the penalty provisions in
3.2 and 3.4 from $0.15 to $0.015.  The rest of the contract was unchanged.
As stated in previous email, please forward two signed originals to me for

Darla,

I have completed reviewing your invoice revisions for October and November
1999 and January, February, June and July 2000.  I have found a couple of
discrepancies in the worksheets that you sent on December 22, 1999.  Those
discrepancies are as follows:

1) October 1999 - Transwestern - Commodity sale/purchase cost and pipeline
transportation cost do not equal the total Transwestern cost.  This is do to
not using the rounding option in the detail computations.  While this
difference is only $0.01, the spreadsheet should total correctly.

2) January 2000 - EPNG - Total transportation cost was not equal to sum of
details.  Use of rounding option corrects the discrepancy.

3) July 2000 - Transwestern - Transportation commodity charges were based
upon a volume of 153,272.  The net usage after deducting 3rd party deliveries
of 5,187 from measured city gate throughput of 160,650 is 155,463.  Net usage
should have used in calculating transportation commodity charges.

Attached are revised Enron worksheets for the above stated months that have
been modified to reflect these changes.

In an attempt to close the book on invoicing and payment issues, I have
extended Enron's "Citizens Revisions" worksheet to cover the period November
1998 through July 2000, file attached.  The data presented for the months
January through July 2000, were taken from Citizens' records.  I request that
you verify the accuracy of that data with Enron's records and advise me of
any discrepancies. It should be noted that all corrections that you made plus
the one stated above are reflected in the worksheet.

I will be in Houston next week and would like to meet with you to bring
closure to these invoicing issues.  I am scheduled to meet with Frank Vickers
and other Enron folks at 10 AM on Wednesday, January 10, 2001.  I have a
flight to return to New Orleans at 4:30 PM.  My morning meeting with Enron
should conclude by noon.  Please check your schedule and see if there is time
either before 10 AM or after noon, that you can meet with me.  I am willing
to meet before and after my morning meeting, if necessary.

Please advise on your availability to meet and should you have any questions,
please let me know.  Thanks for your assistance.

I will be out of the office beginning Wed Dec 20, returning on January 3.  
Over this time I will be checking my voice mail, pretty much every day, and 
working on some ongoing business.  In my absence, please ask callers if 
someone else can help them.  If not, put them into voice mail and I will be 
able to get back to them within a day or so.

Hi Kim

I'm OK with the March deal. After that, it's a little iffy.

I'm still not comfortable with the April-August El Paso arrangement,
especially since we really don't know how this line will work out after the
split. My preference would be to:
1) buy 1,456/day + loss gas at San Juan Index + 0.05 and flow it to So Cal
Topock(subject to true-up for curtailments); and,
2) sell other El Paso -> PG&E capacity at a future price, tbd.

I've attached my version of the term sheet.

Have a good weekend and trip. See you soon!

Eric,

Attached is an updated term sheet.  As you know, any fixed prices are
subject to change until we reach an agreement.  Also, in the Canadian
Supply section, I left that part up to further negotiations in the case
that you get rid of the engage supply.  I found out after our conversation
that Enron Canada would be selling and nominating the AECO gas as well as
acting as agent for any transport down to Kingsgate.  This can be done but
I will have to work such negotiations with them.  Are you comfortable with
this for now?

Also, Q3 socal basis is now offered at $2.10.  FYI.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will go ahead and put a deal in
the system for March since I will be gone next week.  Just let me know if
you agree with El Paso capacity bid for March.

Thanks for your help!

Kim

Hey you. I didn't know you were in Houston. You are over there on the gas
side?! WOW!! When did that happen?
You always did like Houston didn't you. I bet you are having a great time
doing gas. It is quite a market these days.

I didn't go to Phoenix because I just had a baby boy. Tyler is his name. He
was born March 6th. I have a couple of boys now  they will be just fine if
they take after their daddy.

Other than the new arrival things are pretty much steady in my life. Things
are going very well here at Mirant (quite the new name eh!).

Give me an update on your life - being in Houston and all now.

Talk to you soon


Cheers

Attached are the completed Exhibit A's that are required for the Kern Open 
Season.  The bid requires that a seperate Precedent Agreement (PA) be 
submitted with each Exhibit A, so that means your customers must sign two 
PA's and submit one Exhibit with each.  Also the credit worthiness and the 
affiliate statement must be submitted with each PA.  Instead of submitting 
all your affiliates you can instead submit the following statement:

 "Shipper warrants and represents that no other affiliate is participating in

Darla Saucier to keep things on even keel.  I would like to stay involved as 
I think that is in the interest of the client and EPMI. but continue to ramp 
down.  This has been occurring  as you have already taken over the 
transaction side of the deal.  If you want to take over everything that is 
fine too, and no offense will be taken, but doing so will take a significant 
investment of time on your part to get up to spped on the deal structure and 
the nuances of transport on El Paso.

As I discussed they want to get together next week to discuss the "new deal" 
and the TW operator transaction.  These deals are somewhat hairy and will be 
hard to close, but there is a significant amount of money that we could 
make.  I would like to help close that deal.  With respect to the orig 
question, my thought is I am very comfortable having you determine how much 
orig (if any) you think I deserve after the fact based on the value you think 
I added to the transaction if it gets done.  If you want to handle it 
yourself and use me as a consultant that is OK too.

Let me know what you think on Monday

Check Case 2, it seems like the gas cost to Enron could excced the floor 
price as we would be charging pipeline costs.  Isn't the floor San Juan plus 
$07 plus fixed plus variable pipeline cost plus fuel?

Mary,

I have been unsuccessful at finding your phone number so I will try this 
email address I received from Kim Olinger.  I have recently moved from 
Enron's Portland office where I worked for Chris Foster, to Houston to 
re-initiate our gas marketing efforts in the west.  Chris has been turning 
over the gas responsibilities he retained after moving to Portland.  Could 
you change the Enron contact that you have in your system from Chris Foster 
to me?  My name is Kim Ward and my number is 713-853-0685.  Please call me 
with any questions you might have. 

Thanks,

Kim,

Mike McDonald and I are meeting with the President of Knauf next week.  The 
topic for discussion is energy supply to their facility currently under 
construction in Shasta Lake, CA.  We have previously bid power supplies to 
Shasta who, in turn, sell the power to Knauf.  Knauf wants to meet directly.  
They also want us to look at providing their gas needs - about 2.5 MMcfd.

Can I get your help in getting quotes for natural gas supplies to their 
facility.  I need PG&E city-gate prices for a 1, 4 and 9 year, 2.5 MMcfd 
baseload supply starting July 1, 2001.  I will ask Tracy Ngo about credit.

We are meeting with Knauf next Thursday in Indianapolis, so I need pricing by 
late Tuesday.  We need to leave at the crack of dawn on Wednesday to get to 
Indy.

Thanks,

Laird

Hi There!

Here's the scoop on Friday night.  I have attached the "e mail" I received in 
case you are wondering what's going on.  I reserve the right to blow it all 
off and go to dinner or whatever we feel like, OK!  

It was great up at Lake Conroe this last weekend.  Weather was perfect.  It 
was even warm enough to go out on the wave runners.  This weekend should be 
even better!  

I might go to Las Vegas tonight .  A friend was served with divorce papers 
today and is not doing real well and wants to go for 24 hours.  We would have 
to be back Wednesday night since he has to be over in Louisiana Thursday.  If 
I go what number do you want me to bet for you on roulette?  I would have 
said 38 but that's to high a number, (JUST KIDDING)   Your laughing , right!  
Its not really a great time since I have such a large position, but Its 
something I need to do.  I would appreciate it if you did not say anything 
about Las Vegas here at work since Im not sure how much Im going to tell 
everyone.

Im looking forward to Friday night!
Don't forget your number for roulette.

 Jim

Kim-
This is true.  The master agreement would apply only in the event we would
be buying gas from Enron on a long-term basis.  Typically, Nova and ANG
would have your company assign the capacity to SMUD on their contracts.
Same with PGT on the capacity release mechanism.  Calvin

I was thinking last night, if we were to come to terms on the pgt capacity
sale to you guys and you were willing to prepay, it wouldn't matter if we
had that master firm gas agreement in place.  Basically, you guys would
have the capacity, we would get paid upfront and everything wuld be done.

that we have.? Matt is currently assessing the  situation with regards to
penalties tomarrow.? We can buy intra-day  gas but it will be at a big
premium - and a cost to us.? I think that  we will need to include language
in our March contract to the effect that  if Smurfit doesn't schedule with
us and use a volume that is within Socal's  imposed tolerance level, we will
be able to pass the associated costs back  to Smurfit.

HOw do you think this will sit with  Smurfit?

Talked to Kim Ward  at? Enron this afternoon to confirm pricing for rolling
the contract  forward. ? She expressed concern that there are specific
tolerances  that Enron has to abide? by or they will incur penalties. She
stated  that Enron contacted the LA? Vernon site today to see if you  were
running. They were told no, and she? said that later today that  changed
without notice to Enron.

This may have? been an  oversight today, but a concern when trying to move
forward with any?  marketer.
To eliminate the baseload requirements and Gas Daily  pricing? for swing
volumes, the plant has to be proactive in notifying  Enron of any
significant changes in usage. Otherwise, Enron will force the  penalties
back to SSCC.

Thank  you,
Lynn

Kim,

I must await if credit wants new credit terms.  You may want to call Ed Sacks

Once you or Ed get back with me, we in Legal will be more than happy to

Kim,

Please be advised, an draft ISDA was sent to Dave Hutchens of TEP by FED EX 
on 5/11/2000.  To date ENA has never received any comments from TEP.

Ed,

Please advise if TEP's financial terms per your worksheet of 4/28/2000 can 
remain the same. If so Legal can provide TEP with a redraft.

Sara,

We are in the process of trying to lock in a fixed price for gas for Tucson 
Electric for the summer.  We need to get a contract in place ASAP that allows 
a financial transaction with these guys.  Have you guys ever looked into 
financial contracts with them?  Let me know what information you need or if 
you have any questions.  They are ready to do something today.  

Thanks,

How are you planning on keeping track of all the trades you do for Citizens 
and communicating that info to them?  We need to make sure that all the 
billing people have this info so the bills are correct.  My suggestion is 
that you maintain a spreadsheet that has all trades and send it to me and the

agree.

Chris,

Thank you for the conversation the other day.  Gelber's intent is to sit on
the side of AZ Gas and that does not necessarily mean in opposition to
Enron.  I personally hope to work constructively for their benefit, and to
the benefit of Enron, Gelber and others who may be involved.  Sometimes
however, our interests may be contrary and I apologize up front when that is
the case.

I have urged Sean to move ahead on EOL and he is doing so.  Moreover please
provide your fax number and I'll fax you audited financials.

Thanks.

I had a good "clear the air" talk with Art yesterday.  We came up with a
couple things that will improve the process.

1.  Citizens needs to subscribe to EOL so that Art can execute trades
without calling me or anyone else at Enron.  This will improve execution.
Sean, please make this a priority.  Call the 800 number and make it happen.
Call me if you need help.

2.      Kim Ward will be the point person for gettting NYMEX and Basis
quotes.  Kim's number is 713/853-0685.  I will be helping Kim, but she is
in a better position to execute trades as she is on the desk.

3.  Citizens should consider getting swap contracts in place with
counterparties other than Enron (and Enron as well) so that you can do
fixed price deals with others in the event that you can obtain more
attractive pricing than what Enron is offering at any point in time.

Please let me know if you want further follow-up re: your e-mail below.
Also, please push forward on the 2 contracts (gas contract amendedment and
power contract master).

Thanks

Chris

Subject: NYMEX fixed prices obtained from Enron

Sean,

As we discussed on  the telephone today, I have a concern surrounding the
pricing Enron gave  us?while establishing NYMEX fixed pricing for the
months of April 2001, May  2001, June 2001, July 2001 and August 2001.

Today, we first  contacted Enron to obtain market quotes at 10:58 am cst.
In every month we  requested a quote on NYMEX, Enron gave a quote that was
no less than two cents  higher than the offer on the floor of the NYMEX.
Gelber questioned the  quotes as being outside the market.? Gelber chose to
end the telephone call  after questioning the quotes.? At 11:08 am, Gelber
called Enron  again.? The election was made to proceed with execution of
the necessary  positions.? For the months of April, May, June, and August
we received  prices that were at the offer side of the NYMEX bid/offer
spread.? However,  on the month of July the price received was not only
outside of the then current  NYMEX bid/offer range but was indeed higher
than the NYMEX high for the day on  the July contract.? Specifically, the
Citizen's Arizona Gas price received  for July 2001 from Enron is $5.340,
the high for the day on NYMEX was  $5.290.

I do not currently  feel comfortable with Enron's pricing methods.? My
assessment after today's  transactions is only partially favorable.? It is
my understanding that  Citizen's compensates Enron in other parts of your
business relationship and  their should be no need for them to mark prices
up when executing either NYMEX,  basis, or a combination of the two.

Citizen's may want  to consider pursuing alternative mechanism's?for
securing fixed pricing via  other accessible markets.

Sincerely,

Art Gelber

    Debt reduction, cost cutting, and increased sales have brought El Paso=

    In 1998, the company agreed to reduce rates--mainly residential--in New=

Kim -

A couple of thoughts regarding Charles Hinckley's email and your pending trip 
to San Diego:

1.  I have scoured all of United Technologies' filings and even their 
website.  I found exactly ZERO references to CalPeak Power, LLC.  I'm not 
saying that CalPeak ISN'T a wholly-owned subsidiary of United Technologies, 
but I find it strange that I can't find anything on CalPeak in United's 
filings/online info.  

2.  If CalPeak is indeed a subsidiary and WILL guarantee CalPeak's 
obligations, then we are in great shape.  United Technologies is A+ rated, 
with lots of liquidity available in the form of unused lines of credit.

3.  If CalPeak will not benefit from a United Technologies guaranty, then we 
definitely need to see their financials/management notes.

Will they send you the financials/notes before you leave for San Diego?

What's your take on this?  They want to meet with me on friday in San Diego 
to discuss a potential deal as we were short listed on the RFP to supply gas

contracts in their hands, I don't know if we want to waste our time - or

CalPeak Power, LLC is a project company and is now a wholly owned subisdiary

It is not invisioned that CalPeak will benifit from an absolute gurantee

project and into the fuel supply agreements.

Good Morning,

Exciting News!!  We now have a new Portland Web based IT incident & tracking 
application to replace the existing Westdeskitissues.mde Access application.  
The new Web based solution adds several key enhancements that will hopefully 
improve IT response time and improve our communications back to you when 
problems are resolved.

Here are some of the key enhancments:
1.  Ability to query outstanding & resolved issues.
2.  IT problem/resolution knowledge base.
3.  Web page that displays important IT contact information.
4.  Automatic email notifications to resolution team members.
4.  And much, much, more.

For those of you who may be new to the office, or may have forgotten about 
the old Westitissues.mde application.  This application is continuously 
monitored by the production support team for infrastructure (PC's, Monitors, 
terminal-server, LAN, WAN, etc) and application (Enpower, Portcalc, CAPS, 
etc.) problems or enhancements requested by users.  This database is also 
summarized to capture metrics which are then used to evaluate the performance 
of the IT group.

Here are the steps to using the new West Desk Problem Tracking System:

New Login:

1. Go to http://westdesksupport/
2. Click the Login button towards the bottom of the page.
3. In the UserName Box, Enter:  ITWD.
4. For the Password type in: Password.
5. On the next Screen, fill out all the information. (Only certain fields are 
required, but filling out everything is preferable)
6. After Clicking the submit button, you are going to be asked to login with 
the new username and password you created in the New User Area.
7. Upon submitting, you will come to the main index page.

For your information, the organizational change below will not bring about a 
change in administrative coverage for West Power Trading.  Anna Mehrer will 
continue to support Greg Wolfe as part of the Middle Market and Services 
group.  Kathy Sheppard will continue to support Bill Williams III and Real 
Time.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Subject: Organizational Update

As everyone is surely aware after last night's going away party, John Forney 
is heading back to Houston to trade the Short Term Entergy market.  Bill 
Williams III will be assuming responsibility for the Real Time desk and will 
report to Greg Wolfe.  There are three major areas of responsibility that 
Greg and Bill will be focussing on in 2001.  The first is the management of 
EPMI's physical power flows.  This entails checking out with counterparties, 
handling cuts, and ensuring that all of our risk and settlement systems 
reflect the proper information.  The second area is trading done by the Real 
Time group.  Each day, our Real Time desk combs the market looking for 
attractive trading opportunities.  The third area is the Services Desk.  The 
Services Desk provides scheduling and settlements services to customers who 
don't have the staff or systems to do it themselves.  We have seen our 
Services business grow dramatically this year.

Greg Wolfe will be ultimately responsible for the efforts of the Real Time 
desk and our Services business.  Les Rawson will continue in his role on the 
Services desk and will report to Greg.  Bill Williams will be responsible for 
the day to day operations of the Real Time desk.  Greg will continue to work 
closely with the middle market group and will maintain some of his coverage 
responsibilities.  Chris Foster will continue to manage the Middle Market 
group.

The continued growth of the Enron Europe office and related businesses has 
prompted a change in the management of Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) in 
London.  Effective in early January, 2001, Ted Murphy will transfer to the 
London office and manage the RAC activities which includes credit/market risk 
and underwriting. Ted will continue to manage the Enron Global Market Risk 
activities.  Steve Young, currently managing RAC in London, will begin a new 
assignment within  EBS, also in London.

The Houston Market Risk group will be managed by David Port.

As Enron continues to expand its trading and risk management businesses, it 
is vital that trading and credit policies are administered in a consistent 
and accurate manner across the company.  Hopefully this realignment will 
accomplish that goal.

Please join me in congratulating Ted, David and Steve on their new 
assignments.

Attached is the link that will allow you access to referenced database.  
Please note, that we have just upgraded the database to add the ISDA 
definitions, branch offices approved for trading, and market disruption 
provisions.  This information should be inputted for the new master swap 
agreements on a going forward basis, but we still need to go back and 
repopulate the data for the existing master swap agreements.

Also, FYI, the "See" drop down is our nickname for the name changes and 
mergers reference.  If an item is filled in for that entity it should show 
you any prior or new names for the counterparty.  

If there is anyone else who would like the link, please let me know and I 
will forward it to them.

We hope you find the information provided in this database helpful.

Term sheet looks fine.
As for gas pricing, it seems we'd be better off just settling per the
contract.
I'm OK with PG&E Topock, but I'm hopeful that either (i) it will prove to be
more valuable (closer to So Cal) in the future, or (ii) we can work with
PG&E to deliver it to So Cal somehow.

Guys,

Attached is the latest and greatest term sheet for April through August,
2001.  Please let me know if I have addressed all of the issues we
discussed.  If not, just let me know and I can fix it.

Also, for your KRS supply for April 1 -10, we are a Gas Daily minus $.50
bid.  For the 3500 fixed priced gas at the Border, we will pay Gas Daily
minus $.10.  Also, for the EPNG capacity delivered to PG&E Topock, our
fixed price bid is $2.10 plus variable.

Let me know what you think about these prices so I can get them in the
system if we agree.  Also, call me if you have any questions!

Thanks,

Kim

This should probably be researched further.  If they can really build this 
many plants it could have a huge impact on the Cal border basis.  Obviously 
it is dependent on what capacity is added on Kern, PGT and TW but it is hard 
to envision enough subscriptions to meet this demand.  Even if it is 
subscribed it will take 18 months to 2 years to build new pipe therefore the 
El Paso 1.2 Bcf/d could be even more valuable.

Electric Co. back toward
    investment-grade benchmarks. The company has exceeded debt-reduction=20
targets and expects debt to be
    about 50% of total capital by 2002. If sales continue to grow at even=
=20
one-half the historical 3% to 4% per year,
    cash flow interest coverage should improve to 3.5 times by then. Still,=
=20
the ratings on El Paso Electric continue to
    reflect the company=01,s high leverage, dependence on nuclear power, hi=
gh=20
fixed costs, and high rates.=20

    The company borrowed heavily to fund its 15.8% interest in the Palo Ver=
de=20
nuclear plant, which supplies 50% of
    the utility=01,s power. The plant=01,s past operating problems and cont=
inued=20
structural problems add some risk to the
    company=01,s already weak financial profile. Most importantly, customer=
s in=20
the generally low-income service
    territory fought against rate increases needed to recover the nuclear=
=20
investment, helping to put El Paso Electric
    in bankruptcy. A settlement signed with Texas customers in 1995 allowed=
=20
the company to keep a $25 million
    rate increase implemented in 1994, permitted accelerated depreciation o=
f=20
generation and transmission assets,
    and froze rates until 2005 in exchange for extending the El Paso Electr=
ic=20
franchise.=20

    In 1998, the company agreed to reduce rates--mainly residential--in New=
=20
Mexico and Texas, bringing them
    more in line with Southwestern averages. By the time retail competition=
=20
comes to either state (2002), El Paso
    Electric will have a fairly competitive cost structure which should all=
ow=20
them to retain retail customers. By that
    time, El Paso Electric will have separated its assets into a regulated=
=20
transmission and distribution business
    and an unregulated electricity generation business, as required by New=
=20
Mexico and Texas law. Costs incurred
    to effect this change will be recovered in a competitive transition=20
charge. Stranded costs (accrued charges
    related to generating plant costs which would have been recovered in a=
=20
regulated market) will be recovered over
    a five-year transition period in New Mexico. In Texas, the rate=20
settlement allowed El Paso to recover those costs
    through accelerated depreciation over the 10-year period of the=20
settlement agreement.=20

    In the wholesale market, El Paso successfully renegotiated contracts wi=

the Comision Federal de

Texas cities over a four-year period.
    Importantly, El Paso Electric also reached a settlement with the city o=

Las Cruces, N.M., ending a long dispute

Las Cruces sales account for about 8% of

Thanks Kim.  It would be great if you could see these to me daily.  I use
the information for two purposes: 1) to run our portfolio VaR and
Mark-to-market numbers, and 2) to have an indication of where the market is
going.

Our attorney has contacted me to let me know that he is reviewing the
Enfolio.

Monica,

Attached are some VERY rough prices for 1,2,3 and 5 years out at Malin and
City Gate.   I am still working on access to the programs for options as
well as more ACCURATE prices.  I know you are just trying to get a feel for
what the market looks like right now so this should be good for that.

Also, it looks like we don't have a master agreement in place with NCPA
which would govern gas transactions.  Those transactions would be done
under the General Terms & Conditions as well.  Did you get a copy of those?
I am following up on getting you a Master Agreement as well as an ISDA and
will keep you posted.

Call me if you have questions or need more info!!

Thanks,

Kim

As you are aware, the Trading Floor adopted three families for the holiday 
season.  Thanks to your support all three families will have a better holiday 
than they would have without your help.  You have been more than generous!

We have one family (single mom with four children) who has a boy who's 
birthday is tomorrow.  We would like to make sure this 12 year old boy gets a 
birthday gift.  If you would like to help us with this, we are asking 
everyone to pitch-in a dollar or two.  Please forward your money to Theresa 
Villeggiante or Grace Rodriguez.

Thanks!

Kim,

Jeff Brown called me today asking for the following:

1.  A contract
2.  Updated pricing for 1 and 2 years out of Jan 1/02 @ PG&E City-gate.

I indicated that you were out until Monday and would get back with him then.

Hope that is okay.

Thanks,

 <<0071988 RESO Enron.doc>>

Dan:

First, I've attached the proposed resolution which authorizes the City
Manager to execute the Enfolio agreement.

More importantly, I need to inform you that our senior management has
reviewed the referenced contract; I have been asked to present additional
changes to the agreement for Enron's consideration and to raise questions
about certain of its terms and conditions.

Let me start from page 1, top to bottom, and proceed to the end of the
exhibits.

1.  There is the word "DRAFT" above the title of the Enfolio agreement which
should be deleted.

2.  The introductory paragraph, line 5, should not contain the words "1st of
January, 2001."  It should be left blank, until the parties have signed the
contract.  Otherwise, the City will be in breach as of the date it signs the
contract, because Article 2, section 2.1 requires the City to proffer the
to-be-approved-by-Council resolution as of 1/1/01.

3.  Article 2, Section 2.4, line 2.  The City (Customer) wants Enron
(Company) to confirm every recorded telephonic Transaction, as defined.
Therefore, the City requests the word "may" should be changed to "shall."

4.  Article 3, Sections 3.1 and 3.2, first sentence:   Buyer's Requested
Quantity refers to the DCQ or MaxDQ.  Seller's failure to Schedule the
Buyer's Requested Quantity shall constitute a Seller's Deficiency Default.
How does a Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity fit into a Seller's
Deficiency Default if the Buyer's Requested Quantity does not include a
Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity?  What is the reason for the omission?

5.  Article 4, Section 4.1, lines 15 and 23:  Line 23 refers to "reasonable
attorneys' fees" yet line 15 refers to "attorneys' fees."  To be internally
consistent, line 15 should say "reasonable attorneys' fees."

6.  Section 4.1, right hand column, lines 3-4.  A statement showing the
determination of the Termination Payment will be prepared.  It's unclear
whether the City is entitled to review and challenge the determination
before a dispute is referred to arbitration.  The City should be entitled to
receive a copy of the determination and to question it before it is
obligated to pay the Termination Payment.  Please clarify, or permit the
City to exercise these rights.

7.  Section 4.2(iv) specifies that a Triggering Event will exist if a
bankruptcy petition is undismissed within 30 days.  Is this (under
bankruptcy laws) the minimum period of time within which one may seek
dismissal of a bankruptcy petition?  Please refer to the 11 USC section that
backs up this provision, or change to 60 days.

8.  Section 4.2(v) and (vi):  Please change "30 days" to "5 days."  The City
is concerned with the number of days that Enron may be permitted to fail to
Schedule before a Triggering Event is triggered by Enron.

9.  Section 4.2(ix):  this language discusses a default by Enron Corp.
(ENA's parent?), but no mention is made of ENA's default in this regard?
Please explain.

10. Section 4.5, line 4:  Is "a Company" supposed to refer to "the Company"
?

11. Article 5.  The City is uncomfortable with the force majeure provision
as drafted.  It states that the parties must perform even if a FM event
(earthquake) would prevent either or both parties from performing with the
60-day period stated therein.  There is no such limitation under California
law in the absence of a contract provision to the contrary.

12.  Article 7, Section 7.2:  Could Enron translate the last sentence?  We
don't understand it.

13.  Appendix "1":  Act:  Please explain why Section 3 is referred to?

14.  Appendix "1", Claims, line 4:  Please add "reasonable" before
"attorneys' fees.

 15.  Appendix "1", GAAP:  This should read: "GAAP means generally accepted
accounting principles, consistently applied, with respect to Company, and
governmental generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied,
with respect to Customer."

16.  Appendix "1", Interest Rate:  Please delete "two percent over".  The
City has a AAA bond rating, therefore, the  City believes the 2% over prime
should not apply to it.

17.  Appendix "1", Material Adverse Change:  What does Enron believe the
City's Net Worth to be?  The $400 million threshold is mentioned.  Also,
what is ENA's bond rating?  Is "BBB-" an investment grade rating?

18.  Representations and Warranties:  Because we have agreed that the
opinion of counsel will not be required, the reps and warranties are being
deleted.  But the "Representations and Warranties" is nevertheless included
in the agreement.  Item (i) should be deleted, because the City has not
undertaken a court search as is our custom and practice whenever we issue an
opinion.  We would like to delete "and (vii) it is not ... Party."

19.  Operational Flow Orders, line 8:  Please add "reasonable" before
"attorneys' fees."

20.  Financial Matters, line 8:  What is meant by "to the extent it has a
legal right of access thereto and/or ...etc."

21.  Arbitration, Disputes to be Arbitrated.  We do not as a matter of legal
policy agree to arbitration, but we will mediate disputes.  Is Enron
amenable to mediation?  This process is less formal and less costly in my
opinion.

22.  Authority for Transactions.  Staff would like the Agreement to include
a list of employees for Company and Customer who are authorized to trade on
behalf of their employers.  Could a statement be added to this section to
this effect?  Then, we could attach the list(s) as an Exhibit C.

Thank you so much for considering these issues.  There are others which I
hope to receive from staff next week and which I will forward to you for
response.

Look forward to hearing from you soon.  I will be out of town after today
until Wednesday, March 7.

Sincerely,

Grant Kolling

  Grant,
       I have incorporated the language you provided to me in
the attached
  document.  I have been informed by the Corporate Secretary's
office that
  they will issue a Certificate of Incumbency showing that the
person
  executing the contract for ENA is authorized to execute
contracts for ENA.
  No other party signs as to form or terms, however, the
officer executing
  for ENA will require that the deal person and I initial on

  his signature.  I have reviewed the proposed draft
resolution.  ENA will
  accept the enacted resolution and will not require that the
City Attorney
  issue an opinion.  If the attached contract is acceptable,
please print off
  2 originals, have them approved, signed and forward to me
for ENA's
  approval and signature.  Once the contract is fully
executed, I will return
  one fully executed original to you for the City's file.

Barb,

No problem for a July 01 start date on the gas supply we discussed this
morning.  The offer would remain the same whether June is included or not.
Also, we would make a reasonable best efforts to take and/or remarket your
gas when the Griffith plant is down.  Of course, if we couldn't do anything
with it, we would be held harmless.  Pricing would be based on a San Juan
Gas Daily Index minus $.02.  If we have to designate the plant as the
primary delivery point on the capacity, we wouldn't be able to flow the gas
to the border on a firm basis.  We may only be able to sell it back in the
basin.

Give me a call if you have any questions -

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Sharen:

As we discussed, here is the Del. Pt. language for sales at NP and SP15.  For 
any sale beyond April 2002 (not purchases), we might want to use this 
language, but only if the trader requests it in a note on the deal entry.  If 
the trader does not request it, it is our understanding that you will try to 
catch it and notify us to make sure the new language is not desired by the 
trader (Use me as a contact and I will ask the trader).  It is understood, 
however, that if the trader does not request the language and you do not 
catch it the trader bears the risk.

Thanks

Chris

You quoted $5.10 as the total spread you would pay.

So:  $6 + $5.1 = $11.10

Question:  What is the credit you will give Pasadena time their capactiy of 
3886 MMBtu/d?

Answer:
To figure out what you are paying for the capacity:

Assume SJ Index = 6.00

Then, 
Basin Price/(1 - Fuel %) + Variable Cost + Demand Charge (Kim's # for 
Pasadena) = Border Index

Demand Charge = Border Index - $.026 - (Basin Price/(1- .0388)) 

x = 11.10 - .026 - 6.00/(.9612)

11.10 - .0266 - 6.2422

$4.83 is the implied demand charge 

$4.83 * 3,886 * 29 = Total Credit

Friends and co-workers:

 I have accepted a job trading next-day power in the Entergy region effective 
January 2nd.      I will be reporting directly  to Rogers Herndon and,  
ultimately,   Kevin Presto.        This move gives me the chance to be closer 
to family and an opportunity to further develop my trading skills.      This 
would not have been possible without  the tremendous opportunities that were 
available to me during my three year stay in Portland.    

I would like to thank the entire floor for their help in making the Real Time 
& also the Services Desk a success this year.       The decision to leave was 
extremely hard,   given this level of support.     

 I am confident that next year will be a great one for each of you and I wish 
you luck in your careers at the Big E!       

Thanks,     

JMF

Kim, the attached e-mail is from John Gregg.  He is a lawyer from Washington 
DC.  His firm represents alot of the Muni's across the country.  He 
represents Mesa and others in the West.  It appears that Enron is having some 
problems with WIlcox.  Did we give that account to EES ?  Do you know this 
JAmie Bellamy ?  If possible we need to get this cleared up so that John does 
not take it out on us in the furture.

Good to talk with you Frank.  Funny you called when you did.

While you were "gone," the mighty City of Wilcox, AZ signed up with Enron.  I 
got a call today from a frantic city clerk because Enron has fallen a few 
months behind in billing after many months of fine service.  This is bad for 
several reasons, not the least of which is that Enron is paying the pipeline 
for Wilcox.

The reps name is Jamie Bellamy.

Could you kick him in the butt for one of the smallest munis in the country?

  Grant,
       Sorry for the delay in responding to your additional
inquiries.
       7.   Re 4.2(iv)(b) - I would propose the clause to
read:  "(b) file a
  petition or otherwise commence, authorize or acquiesce in
the commencement
  of a proceeding or cause under any bankruptcy or similar law
of the
  protection of creditors, or have such petition filed against
it and such
  proceeding remains undismissed for 30 Days, provided if a
petition is filed
  against the Affected Party and the  Affected Party is
actively pursuing all
  steps to have such proceeding dismissed and provides the
other party with
  reasonable documentation supporting its actions to cause
such proceeding to
  be dismissed, then such Affected Party shall have an
additional 30 Days to
  effectuate such dismissal,"
       8.   Re 4.2 (v) and 4.2 (vi) -  "20 or more Gas Days"
is acceptable.
       13.  I will change the definition of "Act" as you
suggest.
       21.  I propose that language be added whereby the
parties shall first
  attempt to settle the matters to be resolved by the use of
binding
  Arbitration by mon-binding mediation and if that does not
resolve the issue
  to the satisfaction of the parties, such matter shall
thereafter be
  resolved by the use of binding Arbitration.  Is this an
acceptable
  resolution?
       22.  We cannot agree to any list of parties who are
authorized to
  enter into transactions under the contract.  Our position is
that whoever
  answers the trading phone during trading hours is authorized
to bind the
  company.  However, we will provide the City with an initial
contact list of
  the people on the trading floor whom the city can contact as
of the date
  the contract is signed; however, the persons who are
authorized to enter
  into a transaction with the city will not be limited to the
initial contact
  list.  Of course, the city could always attempt to contact
someone on the
  initial contact list.  Will an initial contact list be
acceptable?

  Please let me have your thoughts concerning the above.
                                                     Dan.

Purchase/Sale Agreement






  Dan, please accept my apologies for replying so late.  I was
out of town
  again, and am back at trying to complete 5+ days of work
within 3 days.

  Thanks for accepting a lot of our requests.  Let me follow
up with a couple
  of additional inquiries.

  7.  Re 4.2(iv), please suggest language as you've indicated
in sentence 2.
  Anything along the lines you've proposed likely will be
agreeable.

  8.  Re 4.2(v) and (vi).  How about 20 days?

  13. Definition of "Act."  I suggest you refer to Article 11,
sections 5 and
  9 of the California Constitution, to be more specific.
Section 3 is not
  regularly cited as the line of authority to the best of my
knowledge,
  though
  I can see how the language could lead  one to cite it.

  21.  In California, the concept of binding mediation is not
recognized, if
  I
  have understood our outside counsel at prior mediations in
which I've
  participated.  Mediation is non-binding.  As a practical
matter, it can
  cost
  almost as much in terms of time, money and effort to proceed
to mediation,
  but the "rules of engagement" are not as tight as are found
in arbitration.
  We avoid the rigid procedures.  I believe Enron should
consider this
  approach at times.  Having gone through a couple, I would
not recommend to
  my client that we would proceed any further once the
mediator makes a
  proposal that's acceptable to the parties.  The cost of
arbitration is not
  worth it.  That's why we in California tend to prefer
mediation to
  arbitration.

  22.  I have to insist on behalf of my client that we
assemble some list.
  Surely, Enron can submit a list of people that will be
initially approved
  to
  engage in authorized transactions.  We can do the same.
We've had an
  unfavorable experience with another Texas-based
  energy company regarding the scope of its representative's
authority.  We
  don't want to litigate the issue of due authority.  That
list would help
  It's not a matter of the city claiming the authority to back
out of the
  contract, because someone arguably didn't have the
authority.  There are a
  ton of cases which would make it extremely difficult to make
that claim.

  Thanks.  Grant.

  >>
            (See attached file: 2001-002ctr.doc)

            Grant,
                 I have reviewed your requested changes and
have made
  the changes which
            do not require explanation or clarification.
Those changes
  are reflected
            in the above document.  Let me go over your list
of items:
                 1.   I have deleted the word "DRAFT".
                 2.   I have left a blank for the date within
the month
  of March 2001
            when the contract would be executed by the City.
                 3.   I have changed the word "may" to
"shall".
                 4.   Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity
does not fit
  in a
            Deficiency Default, it is just the maximum
quantity that can
  be handled by
            a party at a particular point.  I do not think
their is an
  omission.
                 5.   I have added the word "reasonable".
                 6.   The procedue for how the Termination
Payment is
  determined is
            provided, if the City disagrees with the method
and values
  provided in the
            statement and is unable to convince the Company to
revise,
  the statement,
            then the issue is to be resolved in arbitration.
At the
  point that a
            Termination Payment calculation is necessary, a
long drawn
  out period
            should not be necessary to attain closure.
                 7.   We need to limit the duration to 30
days,  neither
  party should
            be required to wait 60 days before it could
accelerate the
  other party's
            obligations under the Contract.  We might be able
to add
  language to extend
            the period if we had some documentation stating
the steps
  that a party was
            pursuing to cause the proceeding to be dismissed
and the
  other party was
            otherwise kept whole from a credit exposure.
                 8.   I have kept the 30 days because 5 days
is too
  short a period.
            During a holiday period, one scheduling error
could cover
  the entire
            period.  Article 3 has language which provides a
remedy for
  a party if a
            scheduling default extends for more than 5 days
during any
  month.
                 9.   The reason is because Enron Corp. is the
rated
  entity and no
            separate rating applies to ENA.
                 10.  I have changed "a" to "the"
                 11.  I have eliminated the  60 day limitation
on the
  duration of an
            event of Force Majeure.
                 12.  This merely addressed the possibility of
a
  imbalance amount being
            due when a pipeline aggregates imbalances using
multiple
  points, and the
            language would allocated the payment based on the
amount of
  the imbalance
            that a particular party may have caused.  I think
the
  language is clear as
            written.
                 13.  The definition of Act was one of the
items that I
  had requested
            that you review and complete as necessary so that
all
  appropriate statutes
            were referenced.  I am still waiting for your
language.  I
  started filling
            it in using language that had been provided by the
City.
                 14.  I added the word "reasonable".
                 15.  I have made the requested change
relating to
  GAAAP.
                 16.  This is a late payment provision and as
such a
  believe that the
            provision should be more than a party's rating, as
such I
  have kept the 2%
            over prime language.
                 17.  These amounts were determined by the
credit group
  and any change
            needs to be discussed with that group.  BBB-  is
considered
  investment
            grade and I understand that Enron Corp.'s rating
is BBB.
  ENA is not a
            rated entity and that is why the language relates
to Enron
  Corp.'s rating.
                 18.  The elimination of the opinion of
counsel did not
  change the
            requirements relating to the representations that
we expect
  the City to
            have made.  If the City cannot make these
representations,
  then we need to
            know that before we execute the Contract.
                 19.  I have added the word "reasonable".
                 20.  The party that has the Transport
Agreement with
  the Transporter
            should have the legal right to obtain the
information based
  on its
            contract.
                 21.  It is our position that any dispute be
arbitrated.
  We can agree
            to meditation if we can make the outcome binding
on the
  parties.  I am
            willing to discuss any changed language that you
might care
  to offer.
                 22.  We have found that personnel of both our
Company
  and that of our
            Customers change so rapidily that the list is not
workable
  and merely
            allows a party to back out of transactions it does
not like
  on the basis
            that the person who agreed to such transaction was
not on
  the list.
            Therefore , we object to any listing of approved
parties who
  can transact.
            We believe that each party should be responsible
for the
  actions of its
            employees and should stand behind any transactions
that
  those parties may
            enter into pursuant to the terms and provisions of
the
  Contract.

                 I will be out of the office on Friday, but
will be in
  all next week if
            you care to discuss any of these matters.

  Subject:     RE: Enfolio Master Firm

  Purchase/Sale Agreement






             <<0071988 RESO Enron.doc>>

            Dan:

            First, I've attached the proposed resolution which
  authorizes the City
            Manager to execute the Enfolio agreement.

            More importantly, I need to inform you that our
senior
  management has
            reviewed the referenced contract; I have been
asked to
  present additional
            changes to the agreement for Enron's consideration
and to
  raise questions
            about certain of its terms and conditions.

            Let me start from page 1, top to bottom, and
proceed to the
  end of the
            exhibits.

            1.  There is the word "DRAFT" above the title of
the Enfolio
  agreement
            which
            should be deleted.

            2.  The introductory paragraph, line 5, should not
contain
  the words "1st
            of
            January, 2001."  It should be left blank, until
the parties
  have signed the
            contract.  Otherwise, the City will be in breach
as of the
  date it signs
            the
            contract, because Article 2, section 2.1 requires
the City
  to proffer the
            to-be-approved-by-Council resolution as of 1/1/01.

            3.  Article 2, Section 2.4, line 2.  The City
(Customer)
  wants Enron
            (Company) to confirm every recorded telephonic
Transaction,
  as defined.
            Therefore, the City requests the word "may" should
be
  changed to "shall."

            4.  Article 3, Sections 3.1 and 3.2, first
sentence:
  Buyer's Requested
            Quantity refers to the DCQ or MaxDQ.  Seller's
failure to
  Schedule the
            Buyer's Requested Quantity shall constitute a
Seller's
  Deficiency Default.
            How does a Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity
fit into a
  Seller's
            Deficiency Default if the Buyer's Requested
Quantity does
  not include a
            Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity?  What is
the reason
  for the
            omission?

            5.  Article 4, Section 4.1, lines 15 and 23:  Line
23 refers
  to "reasonable
            attorneys' fees" yet line 15 refers to "attorneys'
fees."
  To be internally
            consistent, line 15 should say "reasonable
attorneys' fees."

            6.  Section 4.1, right hand column, lines 3-4.  A
statement
  showing the
            determination of the Termination Payment will be
prepared.
  It's unclear
            whether the City is entitled to review and
challenge the
  determination
            before a dispute is referred to arbitration.  The
City
  should be entitled
            to
            receive a copy of the determination and to
question it
  before it is
            obligated to pay the Termination Payment.  Please
clarify,
  or permit the
            City to exercise these rights.

            7.  Section 4.2(iv) specifies that a Triggering
Event will
  exist if a
            bankruptcy petition is undismissed within 30 days.
Is this
  (under
            bankruptcy laws) the minimum period of time within
which one
  may seek
            dismissal of a bankruptcy petition?  Please refer
to the 11
  USC section
            that
            backs up this provision, or change to 60 days.

            8.  Section 4.2(v) and (vi):  Please change "30
days" to "5
  days."  The
            City
            is concerned with the number of days that Enron
may be
  permitted to fail to
            Schedule before a Triggering Event is triggered by
Enron.

            9.  Section 4.2(ix):  this language discusses a
default by
  Enron Corp.
            (ENA's parent?), but no mention is made of ENA's
default in
  this regard?
            Please explain.

            10. Section 4.5, line 4:  Is "a Company" supposed
to refer
  to "the Company"
            ?

            11. Article 5.  The City is uncomfortable with the
force
  majeure provision
            as drafted.  It states that the parties must
perform even if
  a FM event
            (earthquake) would prevent either or both parties
from
  performing with the
            60-day period stated therein.  There is no such
limitation
  under California
            law in the absence of a contract provision to the
contrary.

            12.  Article 7, Section 7.2:  Could Enron
translate the last
  sentence?  We
            don't understand it.

            13.  Appendix "1":  Act:  Please explain why
Section 3 is
  referred to?

            14.  Appendix "1", Claims, line 4:  Please add
"reasonable"
  before
            "attorneys' fees.

             15.  Appendix "1", GAAP:  This should read: "GAAP
means
  generally accepted
            accounting principles, consistently applied, with
respect to
  Company, and
            governmental generally accepted accounting
principles,
  consistently
            applied,
            with respect to Customer."

            16.  Appendix "1", Interest Rate:  Please delete
"two
  percent over".  The
            City has a AAA bond rating, therefore, the  City
believes
  the 2% over prime
            should not apply to it.

            17.  Appendix "1", Material Adverse Change:  What
does Enron
  believe the
            City's Net Worth to be?  The $400 million
threshold is
  mentioned.  Also,
            what is ENA's bond rating?  Is "BBB-" an
investment grade
  rating?

            18.  Representations and Warranties:  Because we
have agreed
  that the
            opinion of counsel will not be required, the reps
and
  warranties are being
            deleted.  But the "Representations and Warranties"
is
  nevertheless included
            in the agreement.  Item (i) should be deleted,
because the
  City has not
            undertaken a court search as is our custom and
practice
  whenever we issue
            an
            opinion.  We would like to delete "and (vii) it is
not ...
  Party."

            19.  Operational Flow Orders, line 8:  Please add
  "reasonable" before
            "attorneys' fees."

            20.  Financial Matters, line 8:  What is meant by
"to the
  extent it has a
            legal right of access thereto and/or ...etc."

            21.  Arbitration, Disputes to be Arbitrated.  We
do not as a
  matter of
            legal
            policy agree to arbitration, but we will mediate
disputes.
  Is Enron
            amenable to mediation?  This process is less
formal and less
  costly in my
            opinion.

            22.  Authority for Transactions.  Staff would like
the
  Agreement to include
            a list of employees for Company and Customer who
are
  authorized to trade on
            behalf of their employers.  Could a statement be
added to
  this section to
            this effect?  Then, we could attach the list(s) as
an
  Exhibit C.

            Thank you so much for considering these issues.
There are
  others which I
            hope to receive from staff next week and which I
will
  forward to you for
            response.

            Look forward to hearing from you soon.  I will be
out of
  town after today
            until Wednesday, March 7.

            Sincerely,

            Grant Kolling

                      Grant,
                           I have incorporated the language
you provided

Corporate
  Secretary's

                      they will issue a Certificate of
Incumbency
  showing that the
            person
                      executing the contract for ENA is
authorized to
  execute
            contracts for ENA.
                      No other party signs as to form or
terms, however,

                      his signature.  I have reviewed the
proposed draft
            resolution.  ENA will
                      accept the enacted resolution and will
not require
  that the
            City Attorney
                      issue an opinion.  If the attached
contract is

                      one fully executed original to you for
the City's

Chris,
I am sorry to keep bring this account up.  Thank you for the price change.  I 
have all the months corrected; however, Akzo got invoice incorrectly for 
February, March and April.  The coordinator who invoice them use the January 
NGI index price instead of the correct month index.  The amount they owe ENA 
is $17,561.05.  ENA owes them (7,922.93) for some volume allocation for 
December 2000.  So the net amount they owe ENA is $9,638.12.
I need to invoice them for the incorrect NGI index used and also to give them 
back the credit owed to them.   Let me know if this is ok with you.
isabel


PS I promise this is it.

I received your e-mail.  I did not know that you were sending "your Master
Agreement".  I'm not sure as to when I will be able to give a "new" review
of this agreement.

John/Sean:

I am a little confused on how the pricing indicated in your term sheet would 
work.  I think if we review the attached it will clarify things.  Please call 
me later to discuss.  I want to make sure we understand how the pricing would 
work for Griffith as well as Enron to Citizens.  

Also, I think the Commodity section of your proposal term sheet has some 
missing words.  You don't seem to be adding the spread value of interstate 
transport to the Commodity charge.  

I will be out for an hour.  Back at 1:00 Portland time.

Chris

I have found numerous pictures of Frank Vickers along with some of you.  
Since he is leaving Portland I plan on making a scrapbook to hold his 
memories of Portland and you!  If you would like to write a personal note to 
Frank, please do so and send it to me via email, a hand-written note via 
inner-office mail, or drop it at my desk.  Also, I have some special paper at 
my desk if you prefer to use that.  The sooner the better as time is quickly 
running out.

Thanks.

Mollie

Just wanted to say Hi, I know  you are at work but had to share something.
About two weeks ago, we had to go to dinner at the Peabody with some business
people in town and Jeff introduced me to someone named Cam Smith.  Jeff had
told me he was from Cleveland, MS and his dad was Dr. Smith, OK I put it
together it was Bruce Orman's nephew,  Ok I feel really old NOW!!   He is
young starting out with this particular company that sells to Jeff.  Anyway,
he remembered you and said he always liked you so much.  He gave me scoop on
Bruce and Nancy about moving to Oxford, etc.  He was really nice and quite
country talking but he is married and lives somewhere north of Memphis in Tn.
    What a small world.   Just think you could be living in Oxford town with
that Postmaster!! H A! Just kidding, I would love to see you soon.  Maybe I
can visit you one day.   CT

Next wednesday at 8:00 AM there is a conference call with Houston about EOL.  
Basically Bob Schults wants to communicate the objectives of his group in 
getting new accounts and getting existing accounts more active.  I have 
talked with him about our frustration in coordination with his sales team 
George Hope and Dan Diamond.  The objective of the call is to figure out a 
way to communicate better and act as a team.

Stewart - what is industry standard for settling natural gas swaps based
upon "first of month" index prices?  From the confirmation letter, it looks
like we will settle 5 days after the index is known.  For example, March
we'd settle March by March 9th or 12th assuming the index is published on
March 5.  Is this right?  Just want to confirm since this is obviously
different than when we settle things in the electric utility industry.

Tim,

Further to our discussion this morning, I have attached a draft of a term 
sheet regarding the development of generation at REU's Clear Creek site with 
the intent of marketing the output to DWR under a 3-6 year tolling agreement.


We think this summer will afford us a great opportunity to negotiate with DWR 
to obtain significant value substantially offsetting the installed cost of 
the unit.  To that end, we want to position ourselves so that we can move 
quickly should DWR make a strong bid for capacity and energy.  
Notwithstanding, we appreciate Redding's obligations regarding its load and 
think that there will be a lot of flexibility with DWR in structuring a 
transaction that meets everyone's needs.

If you are interested, we propose entering into an MOU that summarizes the 
general terms of the transaction and roles and responsibilities.  Let's talk 
after you have reviewed the attached term sheet.

Thanks for your time and interest regarding this opportunity.

Laird

Kim, 

Here is the summary.  The bottom line is that by unwinding balance of 
February (2/20-2/28) and the rest of the deal (Mar '01-Jul '02) from a $3.74 
price to a $4.18 price nets Mesa a $.24 discount of the new Index deal (Aug 
'01-Jan '02)

To get them to a $.30 discount on the new Index deal, Mesa would need to 
raise the fix price on the current deal to $4.26.

Eric

Hey Guys

I'm considering some fixed or indexed gas and energy purchase transactions
with built-in price caps and/or floors as a hedge.
Given our sparse resources, I know I won't be able to ISDA agreements or get
a NYMEX account opened anytime soon.

Here are a couple of concepts that I'd like to float in hopes that your
organizations may feel comfortable executing under WSPP or existing gas
supply agreements:
1) Fixed price purchase that converts to monthly index below a specific
strike (implicit put);
2) Collared index (put/call) or capped index (call).

I'm thinking of border gas and SP15 energy products with fixed volumes,
prices (as applicable) and strikes by quarter.

Any comments?

Chris, attorneys have indicated there is no affiliate problem with EAMR 
negotiating a contract with ENA for the operation of the Citizens assets as 
described in the contract I sent you Friday.   IF we can make it work it 
makes more sense this way and tells a good story in support of the "One

Please let me know what your availability is for Wednesday so I can set up a 
conference call with legal and marketing services to discuss the work to be 
done so we can flush out the liability issue.  You and I can continue our 
discussion on price one on one.

Thanks,

CalPeak was formed as a project company, and is being funded by UTC.

CalPeak was formed less than two months ago, and has no financials.

We will provide a pro forma balance sheet should the bidder be selected.

Types of typical project support are things like a UT gurantee for one
month's fuel supply, etc.

Attached are the completed Exhibit A's that are required for the Kern Open 
Season.  The bid requires that a seperate Precedent Agreement (PA) be 
submitted with each Exhibit A, so that means your customers must sign two 
PA's and submit one Exhibit with each.  Also the credit worthiness and the 
affiliate statement must be submitted with each PA.  Instead of submitting 
all your affiliates you can instead submit the following statement:

 "Shipper warrants and represents that no other affiliate is participating in 
the open season"

For clarification, the BOM Dec Sales to any of the three IOU's should be done 
through the BILATERAL market between EPMI and the Counterparty directly.

Any forward transactions beyond December must be approved by Credit on a 
deal-by-deal basis.

Please direct any questions to me 503-464-8755 (or cell 503-807-5633) or Bill 
Bradford in Houston (713-853-3831).

Kim,
 What is meant by a "new review of this agreement"?  Have they reviewed the 
master previously?  If so, I have been wasting my time inserting the credit 
requirements into the standard agreement?  
 I have reviewed the contract form that they provided and it is lacking in 
numerous areas.  I think it is a form they put together for use with a 
Canadian producer.  The remedy for a default is determined by the sales or 
purchase price that the other party can negotiate, as such ENA cannot comply 
because we do not allow anyone the ability to review our contracts with other 
parties.  The form also has no credit provisions, no limitation of liability 
provisions, no acceleration provisions in the event of default, etc.  
Additionally, a transaction can only be done by signing a confirm, and if not 
signed, no agreement.  
 Let's discuss where we go from here.

This was the reaction that I just got from SMUD.  I am assuming that we 
didn't incorporate any of their language, which is fine.  It would just be a 
point of discussion if I could point out that we were working with their 
language.

Thanks, 

Kim

I received your e-mail.  I did not know that you were sending "your Master
Agreement".  I'm not sure as to when I will be able to give a "new" review
of this agreement.

Sean:  The attached spreadsheet indicates that for Feb., Citizens has 5 fixed 
price deals, 3 of which you have locked in NYMEX and basis, and 2 of which 
you locked in NYMEX but basis will go to the default which I think is IFGMR - 
NX1.

Kim:  Can you check to see if this matches the way the deals are entered into 
our system and that the prices match the spreadsheet?

We're getting on this for you...

Hey, hopefully the info below will help you with transitioning back to 
Houston with respect to the "go to" people in credit to help you on your 
deals.

Hotline (x3-1803)

GAS TEAM contacts:
-Jay Williams (manager)- supports mainly Fred Lagrasta's desk
-Russell Diamond- is the gas credit guy that takes care of the domestic 
portfolio and some of Canada gas
-Veronica Espinoza- works with Jay and Russell
-Brant Reves- support mainly Bridgeline
-Darren Vanek- new addition to the gas team

Your best bet for "instantaneous" credit answers would be to call the credit 
hotline.  You should probably ask for Russell Diamond to get domestic gas 
questions answered.  Then Jay Williams or Veronica Espinoza as back up.  
Russell Diamond was the one who worked on Sandia Resources from a WMBE gas 
perspective.

On the legal front, your physical gas paralegal is Debra Perlingiere.
The physical gas attorneys that come to mind are Dan Hyvl and Stacy Dickson.  
Their boss I believe is Jeff Hodge.

Hope this info helps you.  Take care.   Happy New Year's!  Did you party in 
Houston???  Where are you gonna live?  Found a place yet?  I'm looking into 
ski lessons at Meadows.

Take Care.  I'm pushing on Tuscon so will advise of an update shortlty.

Tracy

Ed/Wendy,

In May, ENA sent a draft ISDA to Tuscon for review and comments.  However, 
the cp had misplace the draft and is requesting a new draft.  Can you scrub a 
quick review on Tuscon, review the physical power ITM position, and propose 
terms for a new draft ISDA?

Ed-please have Wendy work with you on the re-review if needed.  Please 
forward the cws to Sara in swaps legal.

The cp is looking for a power swap this summer.

Thanks,
Tracy

Chris:

I received a call from Mike Danielson today.  He works for the West Power 
Origination group under Chris Calger.  He was interested in learning more 
about what has been transpiring  with PD.  He recently met with Ariz. Elect. 
Power Coop, (AEPCO) who floated the idea of Enron selling them fixed price 
power at Palo Verde and AEPCO selling phyiscal to meet PD needs after the 
AEPCO contract with PD expires.  

We got Joe Robertson on the telephone who indicated you are meeting with PD 
perhaps today.

As we have discussed, our strategy is to not call PD and allow you guys to 
work your magic and let us know when you need assistance on gas or energy 
pricing or physical delivery.
 
Can you give us an update of your efforts so far?  Is there anything that we 
should be doing at this time?

Thanks!

Chris
