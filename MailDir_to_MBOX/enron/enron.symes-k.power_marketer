          POWER MARKETS 2001: CRISIS AND OPPORTUNITY

                March 14-16, 2001 Las Vegas

http://www.pmaconference.com/0103Agenda.pdf

EVERY CRISIS HOLDS OPPORTUNITIES:

Power shortages boost merchant power, distributed generation, peak shaving, 
real-time pricing and energy management. Some states are delaying their 
retail choice programs, but others are moving ahead, confident that they have 
benefited from the lessons learned by the pioneering jurisdictions. Electric 
price volatility drives growth in the risk management business.

Credit and cash flow are squeezed, but financial products provide solutions. 
Gas price volatility is a reminder-- coal was and remains the great source of 
energy for our country. Dot-coms seem to have been exposed as just ordinary 
businesses-- but online trading in energy is the single most robust area for 
transactions on the net. The IPO market hasn?t been kind to technology 
stocks-- but it likes energy issues. Broadband trading has been slow to take 
off, but powerline telecom may solve the real problem-- access to "the last 
mile".

Please join us at the Power Marketing Association?s annual spring meeting, 
"POWER MARKETS 2001: CRISIS AND OPPORTUNITY" March 14-16, 2001 Las Vegas, for 
presentations on these topics and more!

Warmest Regards,
Glenn Lovin
Executive Director

ELECTRONIC TRADING. Power is following natural gas to become an 
electronically-traded commodity. The products, the technology and the future 
of electricity transactions. Kevin Sluder, Vice President, HoustonStreet 
Exchange.

NUTS AND BOLTS OF RETAILING. What it takes to put an energy retailing 
operation together-- the cash and credit requirements, back office, 
information technology, staffing, marketing, sales and organizational 
considerations. Andrew Serri, Vice President, AmerenEnergy Marketing.

RETAIL: WHAT WENT WRONG, HOW TO FIX IT. Retail electric deregulation has thus 
far been an underwhelming success, but a great deal has been learned, and it 
is eminently fixable. By Dr. John O'Brien, Principal, Skipping Stone

execution, reduced transaction costs, increased number and frequency of 
transactions and increased specialization are just some of the changes to 
energy markets wrought by the web, and it's just beginning. Implecations of 
the internet for energy markets. E. Russell "Rusty" Braziel, Chairman and 
Director, Altra Energy Technologies.

Attend the Power Marketing Association?s annual spring meeting:

          POWER MARKETS 2001: CRISIS AND OPPORTUNITY

                March 14-16, 2001 Las Vegas

http://www.pmaconference.com/0103Agenda.pdf

EVERY CRISIS HOLDS OPPORTUNITIES:

Power shortages boost merchant power, distributed generation, peak shaving, 
real-time pricing and energy management. Some states are delaying their 
retail choice programs, but others are moving ahead, confident that they have 
benefited from the lessons learned by the pioneering jurisdictions. Electric 
price volatility drives growth in the risk management business.

Credit and cash flow are squeezed, but financial products provide solutions. 
Gas price volatility is a reminder-- coal was and remains the great source of 
energy for our country. Dot-coms seem to have been exposed as just ordinary 
businesses-- but online trading in energy is the single most robust area for 
transactions on the net. The IPO market hasn?t been kind to technology 
stocks-- but it likes energy issues. Broadband trading has been slow to take 
off, but powerline telecom may solve the real problem-- access to "the last 
mile".

Please join us at the Power Marketing Association?s annual spring meeting, 
"POWER MARKETS 2001: CRISIS AND OPPORTUNITY" March 14-16, 2001 Las Vegas, for 
presentations on these topics and more!

Warmest Regards,
Glenn Lovin
Executive Director

RETAIL: WHAT WENT WRONG, HOW TO FIX IT. Retail electric deregulation has thus 
far been an underwhelming success, but a great deal has been learned, and it 
is eminently fixable. By Dr. John O'Brien, Principal, Skipping Stone

MANAGING BILLING. The complex requirements for managing billing and 
commodities in the deregulating energy industry cannot be met with current 
CIS and CRM technology. Energy Retailers must embrace the next evolution of 
energy customer management (ECM) solutions. Paul Grey, Chief Technology 
Officer, Peace Software.

THE INTERNET AND THE VELOCITY FACTOR. Greater price transparency, faster 
execution, reduced transaction costs, increased number and frequency of 
transactions and increased specialization are just some of the changes to 
energy markets wrought by the web, and it's just beginning. Implecations of 
the internet for energy markets. E. Russell "Rusty" Braziel, Chairman and 
Director, Altra Energy Technologies.

          POWER MARKETS 2001: CRISIS AND OPPORTUNITY

                March 14-16, 2001 Las Vegas

http://www.pmaconference.com/0103Agenda.pdf

EVERY CRISIS HOLDS OPPORTUNITIES:

Power shortages boost merchant power, distributed generation, peak shaving, 
real-time pricing and energy management. Some states are delaying their 
retail choice programs, but others are moving ahead, confident that they have 
benefited from the lessons learned by the pioneering jurisdictions. Electric 
price volatility drives growth in the risk management business.

Credit and cash flow are squeezed, but financial products provide solutions. 
Gas price volatility is a reminder-- coal was and remains the great source of 
energy for our country. Dot-coms seem to have been exposed as just ordinary 
businesses-- but online trading in energy is the single most robust area for 
transactions on the net. The IPO market hasn?t been kind to technology 
stocks-- but it likes energy issues. Broadband trading has been slow to take 
off, but powerline telecom may solve the real problem-- access to "the last 
mile".

Please join us at the Power Marketing Association?s annual spring meeting, 
"POWER MARKETS 2001: CRISIS AND OPPORTUNITY" March 14-16, 2001 Las Vegas, for 
presentations on these topics and more!

Warmest Regards,

New! Five additional RealVideo-based powerpoint-based presentations, with the 
accompanying audio. Running about 30 minutes each, the new selections include:

ELECTRONIC TRADING. Power is following natural gas to become an 
electronically-traded commodity. The products, the technology and the future 
of electricity transactions. Kevin Sluder, Vice President, HoustonStreet 
Exchange.

NUTS AND BOLTS OF RETAILING. What it takes to put an energy retailing 
operation together-- the cash and credit requirements, back office, 
information technology, staffing, marketing, sales and organizational 
considerations. Andrew Serri, Vice President, AmerenEnergy Marketing.

RETAIL: WHAT WENT WRONG, HOW TO FIX IT. Retail electric deregulation has thus 
far been an underwhelming success, but a great deal has been learned, and it 
is eminently fixable. By Dr. John O'Brien, Principal, Skipping Stone

execution, reduced transaction costs, increased number and frequency of 
transactions and increased specialization are just some of the changes to

the internet for energy markets. E. Russell "Rusty" Braziel, Chairman and 
Director, Altra Energy Technologies.

Dear PMA Reader:

We've arranged with the publisher of the weekly newsletter, The Desk, to 
redistribute a copy of it's current Special Topic Issue, free to PMA 
subscribers. This week, The Desk goes beyond the realm of weather-based or 
other exotic derivatives and digs deep into the possibility of a market for 
solar (or space) weather derivatives. And more specifically, how they might 
be used in the power business. It's a fascinating topic and one that should 
be on everybody's radar screen. Enjoy the free issue.


Regards,
The Staff of the PMA

          POWER MARKETS 2001: CRISIS AND OPPORTUNITY

                March 14-16, 2001 Las Vegas

http://www.pmaconference.com/0103Agenda.pdf

EVERY CRISIS HOLDS OPPORTUNITIES:

Power shortages boost merchant power, distributed generation, peak shaving, 
real-time pricing and energy management. Some states are delaying their 
retail choice programs, but others are moving ahead, confident that they have 
benefited from the lessons learned by the pioneering jurisdictions. Electric 
price volatility drives growth in the risk management business.

Credit and cash flow are squeezed, but financial products provide solutions. 
Gas price volatility is a reminder-- coal was and remains the great source of 
energy for our country. Dot-coms seem to have been exposed as just ordinary 
businesses-- but online trading in energy is the single most robust area for 
transactions on the net. The IPO market hasn?t been kind to technology 
stocks-- but it likes energy issues. Broadband trading has been slow to take 
off, but powerline telecom may solve the real problem-- access to "the last 
mile".

Please join us at the Power Marketing Association?s annual spring meeting, 
"POWER MARKETS 2001: CRISIS AND OPPORTUNITY" March 14-16, 2001 Las Vegas, for 
presentations on these topics and more!

Warmest Regards,
Glenn Lovin

of electricity transactions. Kevin Sluder, Vice President, HoustonStreet 
Exchange.

considerations. Andrew Serri, Vice President, AmerenEnergy Marketing.

New! Five additional RealVideo-based powerpoint-based presentations, with the 
accompanying audio. Running about 30 minutes each, the new selections include:

ELECTRONIC TRADING. Power is following natural gas to become an 
electronically-traded commodity. The products, the technology and the future 
of electricity transactions. Kevin Sluder, Vice President, HoustonStreet 
Exchange.

NUTS AND BOLTS OF RETAILING. What it takes to put an energy retailing 
operation together-- the cash and credit requirements, back office, 
information technology, staffing, marketing, sales and organizational 
considerations. Andrew Serri, Vice President, AmerenEnergy Marketing.

RETAIL: WHAT WENT WRONG, HOW TO FIX IT. Retail electric deregulation has thus 
far been an underwhelming success, but a great deal has been learned, and it 
is eminently fixable. By Dr. John O'Brien, Principal, Skipping Stone

MANAGING BILLING. The complex requirements for managing billing and

Officer, Peace Software.

execution, reduced transaction costs, increased number and frequency of 
transactions and increased specialization are just some of the changes to 
energy markets wrought by the web, and it's just beginning. Implecations of 
the internet for energy markets. E. Russell "Rusty" Braziel, Chairman and 
Director, Altra Energy Technologies.

CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR SIGNS PLAN OFFERING INCENTIVES FOR ENERGY CONSERVATION

law Wednesday, saying the $850 million package should save thousands of 
megawatts and reduce the prospect of rolling blackouts this summer.

CALIFORNIA LEGISLATORS RENEW PLEA FOR POWER PRICE CAPS

marketers to reduce the huge markup that has been passed on to ratepayers.

REPORT: PACIFIC NORTHWEST POWER PRICES TOP CALIFORNIA

Drought and a lack of aggressive regulatory oversight has pushed spot market 
prices for wholesale electricity in the Pacific Northwest even above those 
paid in California, the Seattle Times said Friday.

Avista Utilities, a unit of Avista Corp., asked the Washington and Idaho 
utility commissions Friday for approval of a program under which the utility 
would pay customers to reduce electricity use, Avista said.

megawatts.

electronically-traded commodity. The products, the technology and the future 
of electricity transactions. Kevin Sluder, Vice President, HoustonStreet 
Exchange.

NUTS AND BOLTS OF RETAILING. What it takes to put an energy retailing 
operation together-- the cash and credit requirements, back office, 
information technology, staffing, marketing, sales and organizational 
considerations. Andrew Serri, Vice President, AmerenEnergy Marketing.

RETAIL: WHAT WENT WRONG, HOW TO FIX IT. Retail electric deregulation has thus 
far been an underwhelming success, but a great deal has been learned, and it 
is eminently fixable. By Dr. John O'Brien, Principal, Skipping Stone

MANAGING BILLING. The complex requirements for managing billing and 
commodities in the deregulating energy industry cannot be met with current 
CIS and CRM technology. Energy Retailers must embrace the next evolution of 
energy customer management (ECM) solutions. Paul Grey, Chief Technology 
Officer, Peace Software.

execution, reduced transaction costs, increased number and frequency of 
transactions and increased specialization are just some of the changes to 
energy markets wrought by the web, and it's just beginning. Implecations of 
the internet for energy markets. E. Russell "Rusty" Braziel, Chairman and 
Director, Altra Energy Technologies.

electronically-traded commodity. The products, the technology and the future 
of electricity transactions. Kevin Sluder, Vice President, HoustonStreet 
Exchange.

NUTS AND BOLTS OF RETAILING. What it takes to put an energy retailing 
operation together-- the cash and credit requirements, back office, 
information technology, staffing, marketing, sales and organizational 
considerations. Andrew Serri, Vice President, AmerenEnergy Marketing.

RETAIL: WHAT WENT WRONG, HOW TO FIX IT. Retail electric deregulation has thus 
far been an underwhelming success, but a great deal has been learned, and it 
is eminently fixable. By Dr. John O'Brien, Principal, Skipping Stone

MANAGING BILLING. The complex requirements for managing billing and

the internet for energy markets. E. Russell "Rusty" Braziel, Chairman and

          POWER MARKETS 2001: CRISIS AND OPPORTUNITY

                March 14-16, 2001 Las Vegas

http://www.pmaconference.com/0103Agenda.pdf

EVERY CRISIS HOLDS OPPORTUNITIES:

Power shortages boost merchant power, distributed generation, peak shaving, 
real-time pricing and energy management. Some states are delaying their 
retail choice programs, but others are moving ahead, confident that they have 
benefited from the lessons learned by the pioneering jurisdictions. Electric 
price volatility drives growth in the risk management business.

Credit and cash flow are squeezed, but financial products provide solutions. 
Gas price volatility is a reminder-- coal was and remains the great source of 
energy for our country. Dot-coms seem to have been exposed as just ordinary 
businesses-- but online trading in energy is the single most robust area for 
transactions on the net. The IPO market hasn?t been kind to technology 
stocks-- but it likes energy issues. Broadband trading has been slow to take 
off, but powerline telecom may solve the real problem-- access to "the last 
mile".

Please join us at the Power Marketing Association?s annual spring meeting, 
"POWER MARKETS 2001: CRISIS AND OPPORTUNITY" March 14-16, 2001 Las Vegas, for 
presentations on these topics and more!

Warmest Regards,
Glenn Lovin
Executive Director

of electricity transactions. Kevin Sluder, Vice President, HoustonStreet 
Exchange.

considerations. Andrew Serri, Vice President, AmerenEnergy Marketing.

of electricity transactions. Kevin Sluder, Vice President, HoustonStreet 
Exchange.

ELECTRONIC TRADING. Power is following natural gas to become an 
electronically-traded commodity. The products, the technology and the future 
of electricity transactions. Kevin Sluder, Vice President, HoustonStreet 
Exchange.

NUTS AND BOLTS OF RETAILING. What it takes to put an energy retailing 
operation together-- the cash and credit requirements, back office, 
information technology, staffing, marketing, sales and organizational 
considerations. Andrew Serri, Vice President, AmerenEnergy Marketing.

execution, reduced transaction costs, increased number and frequency of 
transactions and increased specialization are just some of the changes to 
energy markets wrought by the web, and it's just beginning. Implecations of 
the internet for energy markets. E. Russell "Rusty" Braziel, Chairman and 
Director, Altra Energy Technologies.

ELECTRONIC TRADING. Power is following natural gas to become an 
electronically-traded commodity. The products, the technology and the future 
of electricity transactions. Kevin Sluder, Vice President, HoustonStreet 
Exchange.

NUTS AND BOLTS OF RETAILING. What it takes to put an energy retailing 
operation together-- the cash and credit requirements, back office, 
information technology, staffing, marketing, sales and organizational 
considerations. Andrew Serri, Vice President, AmerenEnergy Marketing.

RETAIL: WHAT WENT WRONG, HOW TO FIX IT. Retail electric deregulation has thus 
far been an underwhelming success, but a great deal has been learned, and it 
is eminently fixable. By Dr. John O'Brien, Principal, Skipping Stone

MANAGING BILLING. The complex requirements for managing billing and

CIS and CRM technology. Energy Retailers must embrace the next evolution of

Officer, Peace Software.

execution, reduced transaction costs, increased number and frequency of 
transactions and increased specialization are just some of the changes to 
energy markets wrought by the web, and it's just beginning. Implecations of 
the internet for energy markets. E. Russell "Rusty" Braziel, Chairman and 
Director, Altra Energy Technologies.

?TOP STORIES

CALIFORNIA OFFICIAL SPARS WITH U.S. ON POWER POLICY

As California and other Western states grid for a summer of energy shortages 
and rising electricity costs, the chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission said that the Bush administration would do everything possible to 
ease the problem, except give California what it wants the most - price caps 
on wholesale fuel costs, The New York Times reported Tuesday.

CALIFORNIA'S POWER STRUGGLE DRAGS ON AMID HIGH PRICES, SHORTAGE OF ELECTRICITY

The way they lambasted each other for PG&E's plunge into bankruptcy Friday, 
Gov. Gray Davis and the utility's top executives sounded like innocent 
passengers on the Titanic, seemingly powerless to prevent it from sinking.

FPL GROUP PLANS NEW NATURAL GAS-FIRED ALABAMA PLANT

FPL Group Inc.'s FPL Energy LLC unit plans to build, own and operate a 
624-megawatt, natural gas-fired power plant in Calhoun County in northeastern 
Alabama.

E. ON, POWERGEN DEAL WILL CREATE SECOND-LARGEST UTILITY

E.ON AG unveiled plans to take over Powergen PLC for 8.2 billion euros in 
cash and assume 7.1 billion euros in debt, a deal that would create the 
world's second-largest electricity-service provider and strike one of the 
boldest moves yet to consolidate Europe's newly deregulated power industry.

AS DEMAND GROWS, INSUFFICIENT ELECTRIC LINES COULD CHOKE OFF POWER IN MIDWEST

Energy insiders are talking a lot among themselves this spring about the 
coming power squeeze caused by overloaded electric transmission lines.

TRANSALTA BEGINS CONSTRUCTION ON $210-MILLION US POWER PLANT IN PACIFIC 
NORTHWEST

TransAlta broke ground today on the site of its $210-million US ($310-million 
Cdn) 248-megawatt (MW), natural gas-fired combined-cycle power plant near 
Centralia, Washington. Washington Gov. Gary Locke joined Murray Nelson, 
TransAlta's executive vice-president Generation, at the plant site to dig the 
first spade into the ground for the Big Hanaford Project.

New! Now you can choose to stream the presentation immediately over the web, 
or download it to your computer for later viewing-- Free!

New! Five additional RealVideo-based powerpoint-based presentations, with the 
accompanying audio. Running about 30 minutes each, the new selections include:

ELECTRONIC TRADING. Power is following natural gas to become an 
electronically-traded commodity. The products, the technology and the future 
of electricity transactions. Kevin Sluder, Vice President, HoustonStreet 
Exchange.

NUTS AND BOLTS OF RETAILING. What it takes to put an energy retailing 
operation together-- the cash and credit requirements, back office, 
information technology, staffing, marketing, sales and organizational 
considerations. Andrew Serri, Vice President, AmerenEnergy Marketing.

RETAIL: WHAT WENT WRONG, HOW TO FIX IT. Retail electric deregulation has thus 
far been an underwhelming success, but a great deal has been learned, and it 
is eminently fixable. By Dr. John O'Brien, Principal, Skipping Stone

MANAGING BILLING. The complex requirements for managing billing and 
commodities in the deregulating energy industry cannot be met with current 
CIS and CRM technology. Energy Retailers must embrace the next evolution of 
energy customer management (ECM) solutions. Paul Grey, Chief Technology 
Officer, Peace Software.

THE INTERNET AND THE VELOCITY FACTOR. Greater price transparency, faster 
execution, reduced transaction costs, increased number and frequency of 
transactions and increased specialization are just some of the changes to 
energy markets wrought by the web, and it's just beginning. Implecations of 
the internet for energy markets. E. Russell "Rusty" Braziel, Chairman and 
Director, Altra Energy Technologies.

February 12, 2001:
Crisis and Opportunity Update

If you're like the tens of thousand of others who read the Power Marketing 
Association's Daily Power Report, you know that our industry faces 
unprecedented crisis.? Blackouts, credit crunch, electric and gas price 
volatility, low hydro levels--? and we're not even near the summer.?? What 
are we facing??

Now is the time to think, to plan, to solve tomorrow's problems before they 
arise.?? Join us at the Power Marketing Association's Seventh Annual Spring 
Meeting: Power Markets 2001: CRISIS AND OPPORTUNITY:? MARCH 14-16, 2001, 
Aladdin Hotel, Las Vegas, NV. 

Crisis grabs the attention, but the opportunities are almost palpable.? Just 
click on the headline for the full story at powermarketers.com:
 
SENATE PANEL PROBES EMERGENCY NATURAL GAS ORDER?
A Senate committee on Friday sharply questioned the way a Cold War-era law 
has been used to keep California's natural gas flowing.???Use of the 1950 
Defense Production Act to compel suppliers to sell to financially strapped 
Pacific Gas and Electric Co., California's largest utility, was a legal 
stretch that could theoretically leave taxpayers holding the bag, said Sen. 
Phil Gramm, R-Texas.

CRAIG HYDROELECTRIC POWER BILL TO STREAMLINE LICENSING PROCESS
With an energy crisis that is quickly seeping out from California to Idaho 
and other western states, the Senate is considering legislation that would 
streamline the licensing of hydroelectric power plants.?? The bill would 
place FERC back at the helm of the licensing process, reinstating its 
authority to balance environmental and corporate interests under the Federal 
Power Act. 

WESTERN LEADERS TALK ENERGY GOVERNORS SEEK TO SPEED POWER PLANT CONSTRUCTION
Facing an energy crisis expected to worsen by summer, 10 Western governors on 
Friday asked the Bush administration to streamline environmental regulations 
in an effort to speed construction of new power plants.? The request came as 
Western leaders meeting in Portland predicted California-style blackouts 
could plague the drought-stricken Pacific Northwest this summer unless the 
federal government intervenes immediately.

 CAPSTONE LAUNCHING GENERATOR SALES PUSH POWER SHORTAGE CREATES MARKET
Moving to capitalize on California's energy crisis, Capstone Turbine Corp. 
said Wednesday it is launching a subsidiary to serve that market while 
boosting the staff that sells its innovative power generators.

 NEW POWER PLANTS NEEDED QUICKLY
Hoping to stave off summer blackouts, California will dramatically speed up 
the approval process for new power plants in hopes of adding electricity for 
5 million homes by July, Gov. Gray Davis said Thursday.?? Under an executive 
order, Davis said the state will cut red tape and give bonuses to small power 
plants that operate only during peak hours of the day, provided those 
facilities can be up and running by summer.

of electricity transactions. Kevin Sluder, Vice President, HoustonStreet

considerations. Andrew Serri, Vice President, AmerenEnergy Marketing.

New! Five additional RealVideo-based powerpoint-based presentations, with the 
accompanying audio. Running about 30 minutes each, the new selections include:

ELECTRONIC TRADING. Power is following natural gas to become an 
electronically-traded commodity. The products, the technology and the future 
of electricity transactions. Kevin Sluder, Vice President, HoustonStreet 
Exchange.

NUTS AND BOLTS OF RETAILING. What it takes to put an energy retailing 
operation together-- the cash and credit requirements, back office, 
information technology, staffing, marketing, sales and organizational 
considerations. Andrew Serri, Vice President, AmerenEnergy Marketing.

transactions and increased specialization are just some of the changes to

ELECTRONIC TRADING. Power is following natural gas to become an

of electricity transactions. Kevin Sluder, Vice President, HoustonStreet 
Exchange.

information technology, staffing, marketing, sales and organizational 
considerations. Andrew Serri, Vice President, AmerenEnergy Marketing.

UTILITIES CONSIDER COAL AS A FUEL FOR FUTURE FOR FUTURE POWER PLANTS DUE TO 
STABLE PRICE AND SUPPLY ACTIVISTS ARE PREPARED TO MOVE TO COAL
  Skyrocketing oil and natural gas prices are leading power- generating

plants.?? "Coal tends to be more predictable, both in pricing and supply, 
than either oil or natural gas," said Vic Svec, vice president of public 
relations with Peabody Group. "We expect to see more coal- based generations 
in the future."

RealVideo-based powerpoint-based presentations, with the accompanying audio.

ELECTRONIC TRADING. Power is following natural gas to become an 
electronically-traded commodity. The products, the technology and the future 
of electricity transactions. Kevin Sluder, Vice President, HoustonStreet 
Exchange.

NUTS AND BOLTS OF RETAILING. What it takes to put an energy retailing 
operation together-- the cash and credit requirements, back office, 
information technology, staffing, marketing, sales and organizational 
considerations. Andrew Serri, Vice President, AmerenEnergy Marketing.

RETAIL: WHAT WENT WRONG, HOW TO FIX IT. Retail electric deregulation has thus 
far been an underwhelming success, but a great deal has been learned, and it 
is eminently fixable. By Dr. John O'Brien, Principal, Skipping Stone

MANAGING BILLING. The complex requirements for managing billing and 
commodities in the deregulating energy industry cannot be met with current 
CIS and CRM technology. Energy Retailers must embrace the next evolution of 
energy customer management (ECM) solutions. Paul Grey, Chief Technology 
Officer, Peace Software.

THE INTERNET AND THE VELOCITY FACTOR. Greater price transparency, faster 
execution, reduced transaction costs, increased number and frequency of 
transactions and increased specialization are just some of the changes to 
energy markets wrought by the web, and it's just beginning. Implecations of 
the internet for energy markets. E. Russell "Rusty" Braziel, Chairman and 
Director, Altra Energy Technologies.

POWER WOES, UPDATED DESIGN CREATE NEW BUZZ OVER NUCLEAR POWER
America's appetite for electricity -- highlighted by California's energy 
crunch -- is driving an interest in nuclear power to heights not seen in

is talking with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission about building new units 
somewhere in the United States, using a design completely different from 
plants anywhere else in the world.

New! Five additional RealVideo-based powerpoint-based presentations, with the 
accompanying audio. Running about 30 minutes each, the new selections include:

ELECTRONIC TRADING. Power is following natural gas to become an 
electronically-traded commodity. The products, the technology and the future 
of electricity transactions. Kevin Sluder, Vice President, HoustonStreet 
Exchange.

NUTS AND BOLTS OF RETAILING. What it takes to put an energy retailing 
operation together-- the cash and credit requirements, back office, 
information technology, staffing, marketing, sales and organizational 
considerations. Andrew Serri, Vice President, AmerenEnergy Marketing.

RETAIL: WHAT WENT WRONG, HOW TO FIX IT. Retail electric deregulation has thus 
far been an underwhelming success, but a great deal has been learned, and it 
is eminently fixable. By Dr. John O'Brien, Principal, Skipping Stone

MANAGING BILLING. The complex requirements for managing billing and

Officer, Peace Software.

execution, reduced transaction costs, increased number and frequency of 
transactions and increased specialization are just some of the changes to 
energy markets wrought by the web, and it's just beginning. Implecations of 
the internet for energy markets. E. Russell "Rusty" Braziel, Chairman and 
Director, Altra Energy Technologies.

British Energy, the nuclear electricity generator, is making plans to replace

prices, worries over Britain's dwindling North Sea gas supplies and over 
global warming.

February 26, 2001:
Crisis and Opportunity Update

If you're like the tens of thousand of others who read the Power Marketing 
Association's Daily Power Report, you know that our industry faces 
unprecedented crisis.? Blackouts, credit crunch, electric and gas price 
volatility, low hydro levels--? and we're not even near the summer.?? What 
are we facing??

Now is the time to think, to plan, to solve tomorrow's problems before they 
arise.?? Join us at the Power Marketing Association's Seventh Annual Spring 
Meeting: Power Markets 2001: CRISIS AND OPPORTUNITY:? MARCH 14-16, 2001, 
Aladdin Hotel, Las Vegas, NV. 

Crisis grabs the attention, but the opportunities are almost palpable.? Just 
click on the headline for the full story at powermarketers.com:
 

Duke Energy North America Breaks Ground on New Merchant Power ?Facility
 Duke Energy North America (DENA) ?breaks ground on a new $250 million 
electric power generating facility in Arlington Valley, Ariz. The Arlington 
Valley Energy Facility, a 570-megawatt merchant power plant, will supply 
electric power to the wholesale market by summer 2002.

Federal Power Agency Issues Largest Wind Solicitation Ever?
The Bonneville Power Administration's (BPA) decision to solicit proposals 
Feb. 21 for 1,000 megawatts (MW) of new wind energy generating capacity is a 
"major breakthrough" for the increasingly-competitive clean energy 
technology, the Washingon, D.C.-based American Wind Energy Association? 
(AWEA) said today.

THE POWER OF PEAK SHAVING -- and LIFE-CYCLE COSTING
With peak-demand-controlled rates, businesses can realize as much as a 
60-percent discount on monthly demand charges if they agree to reduce the 
electric power demand to a predetermined level when the utility imposes a 
control period.

A POWER GRAB BY POLITICIANS
...Where power plants were to be built, or where high-voltage lines would be 
strung, might well depend on who could, and could not, bring political 
influence to bear, rather than what the system needed to work efficiently. 
...With the threat of further blackouts looming, legislation is being drafted 
to designate which customers will suffer and which will not -- ?Should 
farmers be cut off, or biotechnology facilities, or computer chip plants, or 
schools?

TAX LAWS REWARD ENERGY-SAVING INVESTMENTS
The Internal Revenue Service business energy investment credit is equal to 10 
percent of the cost (or basis) of energy-saving property -- equipment or 
facilities -- placed in service during the year.

Enron's Chief Denies Role As Energy Villain / Critics Regard Kenneth Lay As 
Deregulation Opportunist
Kenneth Lay is one of the energy "pirates" accused by California's governor

trader, Lay is arguably the biggest, baddest buccaneer of them all. ?But 
that's not how he wants to be seen. And he certainly doesn't like taking 
knocks from Gov. Gray Davis for having contributed to California's energy 
mess.

Dear Daily Power Report Readers:

Attached to this message you'll find "Restructuring Today's Top CEO 
Interviews of Year 2000," a 28-page compilation of exclusive interviews of 
leaders of the new converging energy and communications industries.

The book is filled with insights into what CEOs forging the new industry 
expect and how they are planning for the unexpected:

Kenneth Lay, Enron, dean of the energy industry, spent 45 minutes telling 
veteran editor George Spencer about Enron's huge success on the web, his 
formula for success and how Enron is looking at "every industry in the 
world." May 5, 2000

David Sokol of MidAmerican Energy told about their key role in federal 
legislation. October 31, 2000

David Freeman, Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, told how they make 
big money from southern California turmoil. July 6, 2000

Glen McCullough of TVA was a member of the three person board when 
interviewed but is expected to be named chairman and CEO soon. July 21 & 24, 
2000

Wayne Brunetti, Xcel, although not widely known as yet, heads one of 
America's largest utilities operating from the Ontario border to the 
Arizona-Mexico border. October 4, 2000

Steve Baum of San Diego Gas and gave shocking news of underscheduling. 
October 8 & 9, 2000

Robert Best at Atmos Energy collects LDCs from his office in Dallas. April 21 
& 24, 2000

Paul Lewis, the former IBM web expert brought in to run Essential.com, talked 
about life on the internet. September 13 & 14, 2000

John Kean Jr may be the most innovative gas industry executive. He was not 
satisfied running a group of LDCs he got from his father.

Judi Johansen, when interviewed was at the helm of the federal agency that 
dominates Pacific Northwest pricing and transmission policy. May 24 &26, 2000

Harvey Padewar is CEO of Duke's unregulated family of companies and told of 
the firm's aggressive growth plans. June 8, 2000

Eugene Lockhart CEO of the leading firm in our business. December 8 & 11, 2000

John Rowe EEI Chairman and Exelon co-CEO. December 29, 2000
