We have two.  I have approved RCRs through November.

Edelman -- PR firm -- for about $2400/month.  The current retainer is due on Nov 15. AReM voted last week not to renew this retainer, so Enron's last payment will be for Nov.

AReM Lobbyist -- Norm Plotkin -- for $500/month.  This arrangement also comes due in Nov. AReM voted last week to continue this retainer on a month-to-month basis.

Greg - Aside from the justification of the EHS allocations to Europe, the larger question is where those charges should be applied.  Rick and I spoke yesterday about this, and we agreed that the EHS charges, as well as the small amount of Corp Gov't Affairs that's allocated to Europe, are more appropriately applied at the business unit level, as it's not the Regulatory Affairs group that actually receives the services.  Additionally, the Regulatory Affairs Europe charges are applied back to the business unit anyway, so it's rather like burying allocations within another allocation.

I've left a message for Mark Lindsey in the Corp. Finance group to find out who we need to talk to in Europe about this issue.  If you have any suggestion as to who would be best to talk to about this I'd appreciate that as well.

In the meantime, we'll be sure to update the allocation explanations for the two EHS departments concerned.

Thanks,
Elizabeth

Elizabeth,

Thanks for your reply. I think we need to re-visit the issue, you were a great help last year and I think we understand the allocations more than we ever did. 
I've attached the spreadsheet we received and have pulled our figures from. I think it is from Dawn Derr.

 << File: Corp Allocations.xls >> 
Paul has asked me to write the email in the hope that between us all we can agree if the charges are valid or can be reduced/removed.  Alan I have copied you in as Paul mentioned you were the most appropriate EHS person and if Reg Affairs don't take the charges perhaps your department (Asset Management) can. 

These are the EHS charges Reg Affairs are down to take at the moment.
>From the spreadsheet I could work out that we are paying for 10% Environment and 4% of Policy and Compliance total budgets.

The costs are not large but we are being made to explain all Corporate Allocations to our COO this year in length as to the value we get and what we use it for. 
 							
						% of 2002 budget		2002			2001

Government Affairs Environment			10%			$86k			$70k	Susan Warthen		
Environmental Policy & Compliance		  	4%			$27k			$76k	Jeffrey Keeler
Total									$113k			$146k


Rick / Paul / Alan I'd appreciate any comments from you as well as Stephen is expecting me to reach a resolution on this.
Thanks a lot.
Greg

Here is the description I have of each of the two areas in 2001. (I think I received them both from you.)      
Environment
My group's support services are more global in nature, rather than providing services to any one unit.  Services include the administration of the corporate EHS web site and regulatory subcsriptions, risk assessment of acquisitions, divestitures  & major capital projects, corprate responsibility initiatives, & performance reporting.  I divided the business unit allocations based on 2001 business growth, maturity of their EHS management systems, and historical use.

Environmental Policy and Compliance
Allocation to Enron Europe reflects an estimated 7.5% use of our group's time for FY2001 (revised dollar amount of $75,965).    As directed by Mike Terraso and Steve Kean, we expect to increase our commercial support focus in 2001 towards European and other international wholesale and retail markets, and will be hiring additional staff to focus in this area.   We expect our current North American activities to expand to Europe and other global markets, including:

Providing competitive intelligence (timely information and analysis) to commercial units based on environmental policy/regulation in Europe and worldwide.  Assist commercial groups with analysis of impacts on business and identify business opportunities related to environmental policies.  Subjects include:
Global Climate Change -- carbon dioxide/greenhouse gas emission regulation
Air quality regulation -- SO2/Acid Rain, NOx, mercury, particulate matter
Renewable Energy & Energy Efficiency - renewable mandates, credit/offset trading, environmental disclosure/labeling
Industrial/Global Markets - environmental issues facing new Enron markets, i.e. pulp & paper, steel, or existing markets, i.e emissions, coal, weather.

Coordinate advocacy on environmental policy issues worldwide, working closely with government affairs & public affairs units.     Maintain ongoing relationships with key environmental policy makers and build effective coalitions with industry organizations, NGOs, and other stakeholders on behalf of Enron businesses.

Doug - We had similar questions raised in 2001, I believe by Stephen, Greg and Peter Styles.  Without seeing the spreadsheet that outlines your numbers, I think the issue is in how Enron Europe distributes the allocation the business unit received from Corp.  I recall that last year (for 2001) the issue boiled down to how Europe handled the EH&S costs, which are separate from Gov't Affairs - but I don't have a record of what resolution was reached.  Would a similar resolution be in order for 2002, or do we need to re-visit the issue?  I'm happy to help out from the Houston end.

Regards,
Elizabeth

The budgeting period for 2002 is now upon us.  In order to assist  you in developing a budget for 2002 and meeting the potential expense reduction required by the Office of the Chair, we would like you,  with assistance from your management accountant/BUC,  to follow the steps below in preparing your budget.  All budgets need to be complete by FRIDAY SEPTEMBER 21st.  

STEP 1 - Calculate Potential Cost Reduction 

As part of our ongoing focus on cost the Office of the Chair has asked that you prepare an analysis of possible cost reductions.  Targets for these proposed cost reductions have been set at 10% to 20% of the lower of your 2001 Plan and your CE2 submission.   Your management accountant will prepare this analysis for you.

STEP 2 -  Prepare Your 2002 Budget

The attached pack will assist you in preparing your 2002 budget.   The pack identifies 5 key steps in preparing a budget and should only take a few minutes to read.   As a starting point to the 2002 budget process your management accountant will work with you  to calculate your  SUSTAINABLE/BASELINE spend.  This is the most important step in the budget process, as by fully understanding your baseline spend the remaining budget for 2002 can be built around that baseline, depending on commercially-driven projects or initiatives anticipated for 2002.  

 
  
Sustainable/ Baseline spend is defined as:  

Support Groups 
Your 2001 operational run rate  - i.e. the minimum cost required to run your area.  This does not include projects or other non-recurring items.   
If your area includes teams that work on deals then your baseline should include the employee needed to support the current level of deals.      

Commercial
 Based on your 2001 run rate and the headcount required to maintain current revenue levels.  This will include trading and origination staff.

Your management accountant has a completed pro-forma  template that they will use to help you calculate your sustainable/baseline budget.  Once you have agreed and understood your spend then the remainder of the budget process can be completed.

STEP 3 - How to Meet Your Targets.  

Once Step 2 is complete you will be in a position to assess the calculated cost base reductions in Step 1. If you have not met the target then you will be required to formulate a plan as to how the target reductions could be achieved and what services, tasks or initiatives cannot be performed if you were asked to meet the targets.  This analysis will be used during your budget meeting and will allow the Office of the Chair to decide if the specified services, tasks  or initiatives could be cut.  Your management accountant/BUC will assist you in preparing this analysis. 

WHAT NEXT?

Your management accountant will be contacting you shortly to discuss the budget process in more detail. 
A pro-forma final budget pack is available from your management accountant.  This pack will be used as the main discussion document in your budget meetings with the Office of the Chair.
We will be arranging times in your diary for meetings with the Office of the Chair which will commence in Mid September. 


If you have any question please contact your management accountant or  either myself or Suzanne Lane on x34254 

regards,
Stephen x34738

Thanks.  This is helpful to us in articulating the role of Govt Affairs here as our approach and initiatives are similar. 

In case you want to include something on Europe, I attach extracts from the presentation that Rob Bradley and I prepared for Ken Lay's speech in Davos last January.  This may be relevant as there's a strong belief in some quarters that continental Europe will contribute significantly to Enron's growth next year, which underestimates the strength of political opposition to liberalisation in a number of countries. So there might be value in sowing the message that there are still major hurdles to overcome in Europe.

If you need more (e.g. a description of some of the initiatives) let me know.

D.

As pre the discussion with Rick, please find attached the draft presentation that he intends to use next week.  It is a draft, and at least one iteration is still needed.  Furthermore, the figures related to the retail positions (in the last slides) are being compiled for the last day of the month of August (i.e., today) to make the presentation as up to date as possible.  

Please advise if you intend to add a slide, or two, in reference to Europe.  Finally, please let me know if you have any question.

Rick:

In case that Doug is considering adding  a couple of slides in reference to Europe, then may be an additional two slides for the rest of the assets world wide would be needed.  Please advise if you see it this way too.

As part of our 3d quarter exercise we terminated retainer relationships with Goodin McBride and McMullen Strategic Group.  

For the West, we have the following retainers remaining.  

Governmental Advocates, Lobbyist, California
Lang Hanson--Lobbyist, California
Mark Greenberg--Lobbyist, Washington
Dan Douglas--counsel on Tariff Advice review, California

I don't have copies of all the retainer letters, but they all expire at the close of 2001.    

Re:  2002.
Jeff D. and I are talking with our California lobbyists on Monday.
I've talked with Mark Greenberg.
I've asked Sue Mara to touch base with Dan Douglas.

Under separate cover, Sue Mara reported the state of the retainers for AReM.

Subject:	FW: EHS Corporate Allocations Plan 2002

Rick - For you to send to Stephen Wood.  Please copy me, Greg McMahon and Mike Terraso.  Thanks!

Stephen - We're trying to work out how certain allocations from Corp are applied within Enron Europe.

Currently, the allocations in question are being applied to Regulatory Affairs Europe (RA).  I received a message from Greg McMahon regarding the Environment and the Environmental Policy and Compliance cost centers' distribution to RA, but also would like to address the issue of the allocation from my cost center, Managing Dir Gov't Affairs, to RA.  I think all of these cost allocations should be at the Enron Europe level as a company, rather than distributed to the RA group.

Regarding the Environmental groups' allocations - these activities are on behalf of the business units' activities, not on behalf of RA. At least part of the activities are global in nature, and not even attributable to specific regions or countries within Europe.
Regarding the Mng Dir Gov't Affairs allocation - these costs reflect a portion of the activity in our DC office with federal legislators and agencies, again on behalf of the business units' activities, not on behalf of RA.

Another issue with the distribution of these costs to RA is the circle created when you allocate to a budget that then gets allocated.

Please let me know your thoughts on this issue.

Kind regards,
Richard Shapiro

thanks for the call Elizabeth,

I spoke to Stephen as he produces the reporting we do on corporate allocations.  He does not think Bob would be able to resolve it or want to get involved.
Can you please ask Rick to forward it to Stephen and he'll resolve it.  We have our Reg Affairs budget meeting with Michael Brown next week and he is sure to have some views on it. 

Stephen - the issue is that the Corp allocations Reg affairs are getting are for EHS work and general rather than specifically attributable to Reg affairs. Its $113k


Elizabeth, I'll send you a copy of the budget as soon as Paul Dawson as agreed it (probably monday next week)
thanks

Per my voicemail, I just wanted to give you a heads' up that Rick will be sending him a note regarding these issues.  We'll copy him on the messages to bring him up to speed on the history, and will include an updated explanation of the EHS charges (also attached here).  Please let me know if there's anyone else with whom we should be communicating to resolve the issue.

Thanks!

Subject:	RE: EHS Corporate Allocations Plan 2002

Greg - Aside from the justification of the EHS allocations to Europe, the larger question is where those charges should be applied.  Rick and I spoke yesterday about this, and we agreed that the EHS charges, as well as the small amount of Corp Gov't Affairs that's allocated to Europe, are more appropriately applied at the business unit level, as it's not the Regulatory Affairs group that actually receives the services.  Additionally, the Regulatory Affairs Europe charges are applied back to the business unit anyway, so it's rather like burying allocations within another allocation.

I've left a message for Mark Lindsey in the Corp. Finance group to find out who we need to talk to in Europe about this issue.  If you have any suggestion as to who would be best to talk to about this I'd appreciate that as well.

In the meantime, we'll be sure to update the allocation explanations for the two EHS departments concerned.

Thanks,
Elizabeth

Elizabeth,

Thanks for your reply. I think we need to re-visit the issue, you were a great help last year and I think we understand the allocations more than we ever did. 
I've attached the spreadsheet we received and have pulled our figures from. I think it is from Dawn Derr.

 << File: Corp Allocations.xls >> 
Paul has asked me to write the email in the hope that between us all we can agree if the charges are valid or can be reduced/removed.  Alan I have copied you in as Paul mentioned you were the most appropriate EHS person and if Reg Affairs don't take the charges perhaps your department (Asset Management) can. 

These are the EHS charges Reg Affairs are down to take at the moment.
>From the spreadsheet I could work out that we are paying for 10% Environment and 4% of Policy and Compliance total budgets.

The costs are not large but we are being made to explain all Corporate Allocations to our COO this year in length as to the value we get and what we use it for. 
 							
						% of 2002 budget		2002			2001

Government Affairs Environment			10%			$86k			$70k	Susan Warthen		
Environmental Policy & Compliance		  	4%			$27k			$76k	Jeffrey Keeler
Total									$113k			$146k


Rick / Paul / Alan I'd appreciate any comments from you as well as Stephen is expecting me to reach a resolution on this.
Thanks a lot.
Greg

Here is the description I have of each of the two areas in 2001. (I think I received them both from you.)      
Environment
My group's support services are more global in nature, rather than providing services to any one unit.  Services include the administration of the corporate EHS web site and regulatory subcsriptions, risk assessment of acquisitions, divestitures  & major capital projects, corprate responsibility initiatives, & performance reporting.  I divided the business unit allocations based on 2001 business growth, maturity of their EHS management systems, and historical use.

Environmental Policy and Compliance
Allocation to Enron Europe reflects an estimated 7.5% use of our group's time for FY2001 (revised dollar amount of $75,965).    As directed by Mike Terraso and Steve Kean, we expect to increase our commercial support focus in 2001 towards European and other international wholesale and retail markets, and will be hiring additional staff to focus in this area.   We expect our current North American activities to expand to Europe and other global markets, including:

Providing competitive intelligence (timely information and analysis) to commercial units based on environmental policy/regulation in Europe and worldwide.  Assist commercial groups with analysis of impacts on business and identify business opportunities related to environmental policies.  Subjects include:
Global Climate Change -- carbon dioxide/greenhouse gas emission regulation
Air quality regulation -- SO2/Acid Rain, NOx, mercury, particulate matter
Renewable Energy & Energy Efficiency - renewable mandates, credit/offset trading, environmental disclosure/labeling
Industrial/Global Markets - environmental issues facing new Enron markets, i.e. pulp & paper, steel, or existing markets, i.e emissions, coal, weather.

Coordinate advocacy on environmental policy issues worldwide, working closely with government affairs & public affairs units.     Maintain ongoing relationships with key environmental policy makers and build effective coalitions with industry organizations, NGOs, and other stakeholders on behalf of Enron businesses.

Doug - We had similar questions raised in 2001, I believe by Stephen, Greg and Peter Styles.  Without seeing the spreadsheet that outlines your numbers, I think the issue is in how Enron Europe distributes the allocation the business unit received from Corp.  I recall that last year (for 2001) the issue boiled down to how Europe handled the EH&S costs, which are separate from Gov't Affairs - but I don't have a record of what resolution was reached.  Would a similar resolution be in order for 2002, or do we need to re-visit the issue?  I'm happy to help out from the Houston end.

Regards,
Elizabeth

Elizabeth - (your "target" cell in scenario 3 reflects a 60% reduction, not 40%).

I have raised these as appropriate items for discussion.  I would prefer not to make these cuts, but I think they are sufficiently in the zone of discretion that we would want to "stack" these up against other items under discussion.  The travel reduction mainly reflects the amount budgeted for staff/Member of Congress travel, with nearly one-half of it representing a proposed trip to London.  I think such trips have enormous value, but I also think we have flexibility as to whether they occur, if at all,  in 2002 or '03 or later.  Right now, I am for 2001, about $400,000 under budget.  About $200,000 of that is travel savings.  The amount I have set out for travel reduction in '02 is about the savings I achieved this year.  

As for company memberships, $475K has been approved.  In my "ideal world" scenario, I requested $423,800.  The reductions I would make would leave me less than scenario two but more than my scenario three request for memberships.  The reductions would be achieved by cutting $100K for the Chamber, which we have agreed to drop.  The other cuts would be $60K for a Telecom Association, we no longer need.  The remaining amount in membership would be achieved through a combination of miscellaneous memberships, $55K of which would be CSI and AEI. 

As for contributions, in scenario two I proposed $640K.  Right now $720K has approved in the budget.  I could reduce the $720 to $620 by adhering to the levels contained in scenario two; the additional $20K would be spread out over all  the accounts by reducing them $2 to 5K.  

Again, I would prefer to keep the money described herein.  I do think as you look across the full range of government affairs, however, that you would want to have a full picture of potential (but within the zone of reasonableness) savings.  I would not air them but for the extraordinary times in which we find ourselves.  In sum, here is some food for thought.  I will be 100% supportive of whatever you decide.  Perhaps it is time to make some hard choices on personnel.

Rick - Linda and I had a "back of the envelope" discussion regarding the DC budget.  The numbers were proposed as follows:\

$200K in Travel (this includes $175K budgeted for Staff trips to Houston, Portland and London)

$275K in Company Memberships

$100 in Contributions
-------------------

$575K Total proposed cuts

You'll probably want to discuss the implications of these.  The cuts in Memberships and Contributions will bring these numbers below Scenario 2 proposal.  

I will await direction from the two of you before making these changes in the worksheet.

Subject:	Enron de Mexico - Legal and Regulatory Allocations

Hello Faith, I want to mention to that a couple of weeks ago, Louise Kitchen mentioned to me that we should review the Outside Legal and Regulatory cost allocations for our group, since the ammounts previously allocated were impacting our budget in a very important way.  I touched base with Susan Helton, who touched base with you and we were instructed to talk to legal (Jeff Hodge) and to Regulatory Affairs (Rick Shapiro), and so I did. They both listened to our 2002 business plan, and revised our numbers.

The cost allocation for Outside Legal that Jeff Hodge (and Mark Haediecke) are proposing for Enron de Mexico, for 2002 is $133,000 USD.
The cost allocation for Regulatory Affairs for the same period, proposed by Rick Shapiro, is $250,000.

I hope this is OK with you, but please do not hesitate to give me a call at your convenience.

Best regards.

FYI - this is the briefing that has now been shared with the team.  In accordance with HR advice, they are also aware that the likely reduction is also in the order of 50 per cent.  Note the time line, clearly we need to close down the remaining uncertainties in the near future.

Greg should also be sending you the budget numbers which I'm due to discuss with Michael on Thursday evening.  I'm also available for the meeting Maureen is arranging with Kean, Brown, Sherriff and us for Friday.

All,

I have meetings scheduled with most of you for Monday, and for those of you I don't I would really appreciate getting 1/2 hour to go through next steps with following the Voluntary Redundancy Programme. Rachel will call you.

Please find attached the following information I need to talk you through:


Bu Briefing Document. ( Clearly we need to make sure we are consistent across the Organisation )

 

Q&A Crib Sheet.

 
Draft Timeline.

 

Selection Criteria.  As you know it is imperative from a legal perspective that we document fully our selection criteria for both voluntary and if necessary, compulsory redundancy and our assessment of employees against those criteria . This information will be vital if we have to defend a claim on the basis of the fairness of our selection process.   

 

Finally for those who have remote offices, we need to decide a plan of action / timelines / legal implications etc.  Please note, these documents are still subject to final approval so I will bring any amendments when I see you.

Monday is going to be hectic, so if you need me call my mobile on 07818 077104.

Regards

Sophie

Didn't realise that this had been forwarded directly to Michael.
First document should be a summary, with detail in appendices.

Copy of Accounts' latest suggested forecast.  I made the following comments, but I think the copy to you may have failed.


Thanks for this.  First thoughts as follows : 
Headcount on last page is overstated - more realistic would be Aug/Sept 20, Oct 22, Nov 23, Dec24
For additional projects, we've shown $250K for PiecePipe and $250K for Arcos : we need further discussion about what the projects should really be - these were just examples, but I think the suggestion of $0.5m is valid to be going on with.
The last CE2 budget I saw was $11.2m.  Did we just lose all the underspend in June and July without any rephasing ?


 

Here's also a copy of my earlier headcount plan.  See particularly the new table at the end showing how our hours have been charged between Jan-Jul and costs that have been allocated to specific projects under the general headings.

 
Rick - finally, Michael asked us to list issues we were working on, and not working on because of lack of resource.  I'll forward the initial list separately.  We need to move this forward towards a regulatory strategy both as a justification for our expected spend (this year and next) but also Michael wants the reg strategy to be much more central to our commercial strategy, neither of which is adequately defined at this moment.

Doug

Rick - Linda and I had a "back of the envelope" discussion regarding the DC budget.  The numbers were proposed as follows:\

$200K in Travel (this includes $175K budgeted for Staff trips to Houston, Portland and London)

$275K in Company Memberships

$100 in Contributions
-------------------

$575K Total proposed cuts

You'll probably want to discuss the implications of these.  The cuts in Memberships and Contributions will bring these numbers below Scenario 2 proposal.  

I will await direction from the two of you before making these changes in the worksheet.

Rick after the joint Midwest-Atlantic Meeting on Wednes, I will have a better idea on possible candidates for dereg activity next year.  At this point, Missouri, Indiana and Louisiana are in the running.  Even W.V. has a shot at revitalization with less than a full corp press effort - if we care, of course.  Thus, I have kept the budgets for the 3 states at midlevel and will adjust to significantly decrease or increase modestly, based on what is decided, which is after your deadline.  If you would like me to revise this proposed budget to reflect those discussions, I will be happy to do so later this week.  Let me know.

This is the email forwarded to Elizabeth on October 2nd, 2001. The outside services for Risk Analytics are indeed minimal.

Please let me know if you have any question.

I do not have access to the spreadsheets.  Kindly consider $50K as a base case, $40K as conservative, and $30K is absolute minimum.  I hope that this is fine with you.  I am more than happy to populate the spreadsheet as soon as I get it.

Many thank

Jim Steffes forwarded to Janet late Monday the recommended organization and budget($ 6.4 million total for both companies). Jim should be the primary point of contact on both the budget and Gov't Affairs organization for ENA/EES( I'll address remainder of issues with Whalley, kean, and Fallon). As an aside, it's possible the $6.4 million could be reduced somewhat as we begin to mitigate legacy real estate issues and also  consider locating the Houston-based staff in the above-referenced organization in available space with the business unit(s). Thanks.

I have thought about this problem in at least three different ways in the last 24 hours. In anticipation of a short discussion with you late tomorrow (once I am finished with Melon) or some time Friday, here's a suggestion for the continental bit:

	1. Constitute a  continental power and gas regulatory team within the overall group.
	2. Make membership of that team as fluid as possible to achieve interaction with the equivalent UK team (i.e. consider overlaps and/ or swaps.)
	3. Within the team carve out skills and specialities which will give a focus to a percentage of each individual's work (languages - preferably mother tongue - and geography being inevitably the most important determinants in most cases); attribute the remaining percentage of work to team priorities (gas v. power, anti-trust v. policy, pan-EU v. national etc. etc.) from time to time.
	4. Consider attribution of manpower along following lines initially:
		1st individual: 80% Germany, 20% team
		2nd: 40% NL, 20% Austria, 20% CH, 20% team
		3rd: 40% F, 10% B, 50% team	
		4th: 40% EU/ pan-CWE, 60% team (inc. internal and external co-ordination of the priorities?)
		5th: 40% Spain, 10% Italy, 50% team

You can probably guess from these attributions who I am suggesting could do what, but I think we should establish job requirements before considering individuals on their merits. If there is no fifth position, I suppose I would vote for servicing Spain with a member of the current UK team posessing the necessary language skills, and abandoning Italy (until instructed otherwise.) I have also ducked the difficulty of allocating administrative assistance.

Doug - We had similar questions raised in 2001, I believe by Stephen, Greg and Peter Styles.  Without seeing the spreadsheet that outlines your numbers, I think the issue is in how Enron Europe distributes the allocation the business unit received from Corp.  I recall that last year (for 2001) the issue boiled down to how Europe handled the EH&S costs, which are separate from Gov't Affairs - but I don't have a record of what resolution was reached.  Would a similar resolution be in order for 2002, or do we need to re-visit the issue?  I'm happy to help out from the Houston end.

Regards,
Elizabeth

1. The $86K Government Affairs Environment charge is from Susan Warthan c/c 100222. Also the $27K for Environmental Policy and Compliance is from Jeffery Keeler c/c 100223. To query these please email Susan and Jeffery directly. (These charge outs have been based on anticipated usage).

2. Yes, you are correct about Rick's costs you are being allocated 0.9% of a $23.4M budget, (which I assume is his whole departmental costs). Should Europe's charge-out be based on Rick's or the Exec group's time only? You will need to forward an email to Rick for justification if required.

I'm fine with the 2001 numbers, not so sure about 2002.
1. Where does the 86K for Environment come from and is there anything we can do about it ?  We are covering Europe for ourselves and don't really see why we should pick up a share of Corp's spend on Kyoto etc.
2. If $200K for a Managing Director only represents 0.9% of his costs, then does that mean Rick Shapiro charges out at over $20million p.a. or am I missing something ?

Doug,
I have looked through the preliminary 2002 Corporate Allocations spreadsheet and summarised for European Government Affairs as follows:
(All in thousands)
					Plan 2001	Actual YTD 2001	Plan 2002
Government Affairs Environment		70		41			86
Environmental Policy & Compliance	76		44			27
Managing Director Government Affairs	0		0			200
Total					146		85			313

The current run rate indicates that we will be on plan for 2001. 

The allocation of Managing Dierctor Gov Affairs has been based on usage. The proportion to  Europe is 0.9%, however this does in total represent an increase to the European Gov Affairs Corporate Allocations Budget of 114%.

Was this your expectation?

(These exclude international project Finance which is now taken up by continental.)

Correspondence on Corp Allocations.  I slightly exaggerated the environmental costs.  Should have been $113K.

1. The $86K Government Affairs Environment charge is from Susan Warthan c/c 100222. Also the $27K for Environmental Policy and Compliance is from Jeffery Keeler c/c 100223. To query these please email Susan and Jeffery directly. (These charge outs have been based on anticipated usage).

2. Yes, you are correct about Rick's costs you are being allocated 0.9% of a $23.4M budget, (which I assume is his whole departmental costs). Should Europe's charge-out be based on Rick's or the Exec group's time only? You will need to forward an email to Rick for justification if required.

I'm fine with the 2001 numbers, not so sure about 2002.
1. Where does the 86K for Environment come from and is there anything we can do about it ?  We are covering Europe for ourselves and don't really see why we should pick up a share of Corp's spend on Kyoto etc.
2. If $200K for a Managing Director only represents 0.9% of his costs, then does that mean Rick Shapiro charges out at over $20million p.a. or am I missing something ?

Doug,
I have looked through the preliminary 2002 Corporate Allocations spreadsheet and summarised for European Government Affairs as follows:
(All in thousands)
					Plan 2001	Actual YTD 2001	Plan 2002
Government Affairs Environment		70		41			86
Environmental Policy & Compliance	76		44			27
Managing Director Government Affairs	0		0			200
Total					146		85			313

The current run rate indicates that we will be on plan for 2001. 

The allocation of Managing Dierctor Gov Affairs has been based on usage. The proportion to  Europe is 0.9%, however this does in total represent an increase to the European Gov Affairs Corporate Allocations Budget of 114%.

Was this your expectation?

(These exclude international project Finance which is now taken up by continental.)

Sally-Anne

Subject:	Enron Net Works 2002 Budget Process

The 2002 Enron Net Works budget will for the first time combine allocations to business units for four key services:  Enron Online, IT Infrastructure, Risk Management Operations and IT Maintenance and Development.  We are providing a level of detail for expense and capital spend that is greater than that provided in past years, and that will allow business units to make informed choices regarding the services that they receive.  

We are meeting with individual business unit Offices of the Chair to review in detail the four service areas delivered through Enron Net Works.  Some of these meetings have been completed and more will occur between now and October 12.  Please keep the following points in mind as we work with you to finalize budget:

Enron Networks today is very different from this time last year.  Additions to the 2002 ENW budget are Operations for EA, EIM and EGM.  Operations, IT Maintenance and Development, and IT Infrastructure for EES and EBS have been included under the ENW umbrella for the first time in the  2002  budget as well.  The 2001 budgets for these functions were approved and included in individual business units last year.   Any comparison of ENW's 2002 versus 2001 budget must be appropriately adjusted for these organizational changes to be relevant.  

For further detail for each business unit, ENW's 2002 expense and capital dollars are organized to mirror each business unit's lines of business (products or commodities) in order to create a transparent view at a more granular level of the costs involved in supporting each of the lines of business.  

The detail that is being provided to business units for IT costs delineates licensing fees, system maintenance costs and new development costs.  Detail on each IT development project identifies the purpose, business sponsor, line of business, "in progress" or "planned" designation, expense and capital spend, system impacted, and estimated completion date.   In order to finalize IT project budgets, decisions will be required from the business units on which projects to undertake in 2002.   

If you have questions about the ENW budgets as we are working with you to finalize them,  please call one of us.

Dan Staines and Joe Conner focus on Wholesale activities, you can work this out with Rick/Jim. I'm fine with the rest.

Janet -

1.	The best split is probably just 50/50 on personnel.  While everyone is in a specific box on the org chart, many if not all of the people are flexible enough that they can cover different roles.  The $ on outside services may be able to be split differently going forward (for example, if EES wants something specific on a state PUC matter).
2.	In terms of approving outside service expenditures, I would like to sit down with you, Louise, and Rick to work out what the best method of working through the approvals.  I will try and set up some time the first week of December.
4.	I have put Steve Montovano in the NE Gas box.  This will increase the budget by $400k (based on historical figures).  I have attached a new org chart to represent this change.

Also, Dan Staines (who is not on the Org Chart) has an Employment contract that ends 6/12/2002.  Dan has been working on Florida and Northeast RTO matters and continues to help East Power with the NYISO TCC auction.  We can sever him, but his contract will need to be paid off ($87k).  Govt Affairs also has a contract for support with Joe Connor (ex-Southern exec) to support our SE activities.  I am trying to get a copy of the contract, but I think that it is in place until 8/02.  My recommendation is to use these guys through their contracts instead of a large payment today.    

Thanks,

Jim

EES is fine with the Org. chart below. I understand the $6.4 million is total for both ENA & EES. Comments:

1.) Need a recommended split of the $6.4 million for ENA/EES.
2.) I understand the $6.4 million includes $0 for Outside Services. The OOC of ENA/EES needs to approve as these services are needed.
3.) The $6.4 million does include legacy real estate costs. Jim Fallon is the coordination point on our real estate costs-is this on his radar screen?
4.) We need to reconcile what we do with Steve Montovano. Because both ENA/EES want to utilize him, I might suggest leaving him in the regulatory group so that both groups can effectively utilize him. Louise/Jim- are you both OK with this? If so, Rick/Jim, I would suggest putting him in the NE Gas Box.
5.) Rick, I understand you're talking with Kean/Whalley on handling the Washington office activity in Corp. I agree.

Janet --

Here is the org chart that captures our discussions.  I think that this org and the # of people is the lowest level that can even try to meet the combined needs of ENA and EES.

Total headcount = 21.  The personnel cost = $6.4 MM (total for ENA and EES).    

Please let me know if you have any questions.
