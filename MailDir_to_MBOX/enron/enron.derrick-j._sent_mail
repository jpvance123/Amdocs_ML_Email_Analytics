Did you by any chance sign off on Justin's choice of Indian law firm?

Sandeep, 

Find out which firm Justin is discussing with. Hopefully, it is a "good" 
firm, both in terms of quality and absence of conflicts with what we've done 
in India to date. Let me know.

I hope Justin contacted someone in Enron legal with some experience in India 
before he hired a firm. Hopefully, he talked with you first, as this is 
common courtesy. Maybe he talked with Sarah G, and that would be fine also as 
she is generally aware of the Indian firms we use and don't use.

Wade:

Thank you for your quick response!

As I suspected, I was slow on the draw.  Justin Boyd with our London team has 
already directed a firm in India to start looking at these issues.

I'll forward your email to Justin, as he very well may want to coordinate 
some of this through Sandeep, if Sandeep has the capacity to help us out.  

Thanks again for your help.

Sandeep Katwala is our general counsel in India, and he should be able to 
work with you and outside counsel on this. Sandeep -- since this is a bit of 
a rush, I would like for either you or perhaps Lena to work directly with 
Travis and outside counsel and try to get some quick answers. 

Thanks,

Subject: Clickpaper.com - Indian legal issues

Wade:

I hope things are going well for you.  It was good to see you the other day.  
I'm not even sure where you are right now, but I imagine that you are 
checking your e-mail, wherever you are.  I was hoping you could give us a 
little guidance on tracking down some Indian legal issues -- perhaps a 
reference to someone that could assist us.

Clickpaper.com is Enron's electronic  trading marketplace for pulp, paper and 
lumber products (including derivative products).  It is modeled after 
EnronOnline, but specializes in these commodities.  The team is in the 
process of registering customers around the world to access and trade on the 
Clickpaper website;  in keeping with the EOL business model, Clickpaper 
enters into access and trading agreements with every customer that govern 
their use of and trading on the site.

Those access and trading agreements are "jurisdiction specific" -- customized 
for the particular country in which the customer accessing the site is based 
-- in order to deal with jurisdiction-specific legal issues associated with 
accessing, or contracting via, the internet, financial trading, regulatory 
issues, etc.   

The team has identified India as having a large number of potential 
customers, and is attending a trade show in New Delhi in early December, and 
they would like to be able to sign customers up at that trade show, or at the 
very least arrange to give them access to the site.  We therefore need to 
consult with legal counsel in India to identify any issues and prepare an 
apporpriate access and trading agreement.  EnronOnline has developed a due 
diligence checklist which is very helpful in describing our business model 
and raising specific legal issues that we are likely to encounter.

Could you refer me to in-house counsel or an outside firm that could assist 
us with this project on an expedited basis (isn't that always the case 
here)?  I would really appreciate any help you could give to us.

To the other  recipients of this message  -- I know that there are several 
people working on this project -- if you already have this project underway, 
please let Wade and I know so we aren't duplicating  your efforts.  Thanks.

Subject: SFA - UPDATING PERSONAL INFORMATION

I am writing to ask if there are any changes to your personal details 
originally forwarded to the SFA.

As you will recall, in obtaining your registration with the SFA, we were 
required to provide to the SFA information about you, including your personal 
details.  Enron must keep this information up-to-date.  If these details, or 
your SFA status, change in any way, the SFA must be notified within seven 
days.  It is important that you take a few moments to consider the points set 
out below, otherwise Enron will be in breach of its obligations under the SFA 
Rules.

Accordingly, if your details referred to below have changed recently (e.g.  
because you have got married or moved house), or will change in the near 
future, please let me know immediately:

1. personal details (name, address)

2. you are subject to a criminal conviction, regulatory investigation or 
civil litigation (other than as a witness)

3. category of registration (eg your registration will change from Trader to 
Representative or Director)

4.  changes in any directorships you hold 

5. internal transfer (ie if you have changed departments within Enron)

6. change in role (ie your job within your department changes)

7. if you plan to leave Enron and have a departure date

Many thanks.

Klett Rooney Lieber & Schorling - headquartered in Pittsburgh, PA - to

Subject: PGE legal report

Jim, I need to apologize and confess I skipped the call this morning because
of an uncontrollable addiction to the Presidential election proceedings. 
David Boies and Barry Richards were just too much to pass up.  Sorry.  
Not much here.  We settled the Beaver lease cases at the same price we paid
the other lessors and without any of their attorney fees.  Good result.  We
have FERC approval of the Sierra sale.  SEC looks good for Jan or Feb.  
I am working with Richard Sanders and Robin Gibb on defense to the California
class actions.  
We have a new offer from BNFL that will be the subject of a conference call
soon.  Looks like they will pay us about 75% of our damages to go away.  
One new risk is the upcoming cold spell and very high Northwest prices.  This
will cost us a lot of money, possibly not recoverable from customers, and may
spread the litigation over high prices to the Northwest.  This could develop
as a risk to the Sierra sale in the extreme, but right now appears manageble. 
More on this as it develops.  The Enron litigation team is here on Monday and
we will cooperate on strategy and resources as prudent.  
Finally, we have received a settlement offer on the Grant County case that
looks good and we are pursuing it.  Al.

Jim,                                In 1998,  ENA removed from its balance 
sheet a loan made to The American Coal Company through a transaction with 
Society Generale.  In 1999 the deal was restructured and Soc Gen was taken 
out by Bank of America.  As part of both transactions, there was an  absolute 
put agreement to Enron in favor of Soc Gen and B of A.  B of A has indicated 
it intends to exercise the put which will have the effect of moving the loan 
back on the books of Enron.  Enron's business people don't want this to 
happen and are going to arrange to have a Whitewing entity buy out the B of A 
position.  In order to timely complete the project, outside counsel needs to 
be engaged.  John Dawson at Vinson & Elkins worked on the original 
transaction and has been contacted about this project.  Please acknowledge 
that it is acceptable to use John Dawson and the firm of Vinson & Elkins on 
this project.  The dollar amount of the transaction is approximately

Rumors of Eni / Enron Merger Abound, Despite Denials from Eni
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
===============================================================

Eni, the Italian oil and gas group, is expected to complete the sale of
its Italian property interests next week as part of its strategy to focus
on its core activities of natural-gas and oil production. Vittorio Mincato,
Eni's chief executive, confirmed that the group is on the verge of
finalizing
the sale of its Immobiliare Metanopoli property subsidiary (Eni's real
estate company) with assets valued between $856 million and $1.3 billion.
Eni's decision to divest its property assets has been viewed by many
observers
of the company as an attempt to release funds to facilitate a merger with
another company. Enron Corp. has been among those on a rumored short list
of merger prospects for Eni.

ANALYSIS: Is the foundation being established for a mega-merger between
Eni and Enron? It is not too difficult to formulate a theoretical argument
in that direction.

Eni is Italy's state-owned, multi-faceted energy company, operating in
the oil and gas, power generation, petrochemicals, oilfield services, and
engineering industries. The company has a market capitalization of about
47 billion euros (approximately $40 billion), is present in over 70
countries
and produces more than one million barrels of oil equivalent a day. Across
the European energy market-which once it has fully privatized will represent

an arguably larger market than the United States-Eni is unquestionably
one of the Continent's leading champions.

Illustrating this point, Eni has taken several important steps within Europe

to, as it says, "play an increasingly important role" in the Continent's
competitive energy market. For instance, earlier this month, Eni inked
a deal to sell 2 billion cubic meters of natural gas to Gaz de France.
This deal followed a previous agreement in which Eni agreed to sell 4
billion
cubic meters of natural gas to Italy's largest private energy supplier,
Edison. With both agreements, Eni has given a substantial kick start to
the opening of the European natural-gas market. CEO Mincato has said that
Eni would recoup the losses made by giving up its market hold in Italy
by "focusing on international markets."

One move that Eni has made outside of Europe also came earlier this month.
Eni made a bid for Australia's Petroz NL, which wields an 8.25 percent
stake in Bayu-Undan, the giant gas and liquids project located off the
northern coast of Australia. Eni already owns 6.7 percent of Bayu-Undan
and apparently is attempting to gain a majority ownership over the project.
It is no wonder why-the Bayu-Undan field has recoverable reserves of 400
million barrels of liquefied petroleum gas and gas reserves of 3.4 trillion
cubic feet. Petroz has not yet accepted Eni's offer, but a favorable
decision
is expected shortly. Thus, whatever Eni may be divesting in Italy it is
trying to regain in other key areas of the world. In fact, Mincato recently
confirmed that Eni plans to increase its daily output of oil from a current
level of 1.2 million barrels to 1.5 million barrels by 2003.

Moreover, Eni has been making aggressive attempts at expansion, both within
Europe and beyond. Along with that expansion comes the development of merger

strategy. Eni does not want to be left as a target for a takeover, which
could be a strong possibility given its recent divestitures and the fact
that its profits remain strong. Net income for the company for the first
half of 2000 was 2,606 millions of euros (equivalent to approximately $2.2
billion), representing a 119-percent increase. Eni is largely considered
one of the best buys among the big oil stocks, but it would rather merge
with an equal partner than be sold to another company. As consolidation
of the oil industry continues, Eni reportedly believes that the only way
to remain a top player is to marry an equally large player on the world
stage.

Enron may be at the top of Eni's list of merger partners. Negotiations
with Spain's largest oil company, Repsol, appear to have stalled, as was
confirmed when Mincato stated that any "link-up with Repsol would not be
a merger of equals." French oil company TotalFina is also interested, but
is preoccupied with its own acquisition of fellow French oil company Elf.
Other companies that have been mentioned include Conoco and Phillips
Petroleum.
It is quite obvious that Eni's merger prospects are predominantly oil
companies,
which is quite clearly the company's intention. Thus, it may seem odd that
Enron is also included as a top prospect. Enron, while unquestionably a
world player, is known for its unorthodox approach to hard assets. Put
succinctly, Enron believes that it doesn't need to own physical assets
in order to be a major player, but rather it only needs to rely on strategic

contractual agreements.

However, if Eni wants to continue to expand globally, it arguably could
not find a better partner than Enron, generally considered North America's
biggest buyer and seller of electricity and natural gas. Enron's gas trading

and distribution activities in particular-along with its electricity
production,
raw material trading and broadband expansion-would all appear to be good
compliments to Eni's portfolio. Reports of talks between the two companies
first appeared in the Italian financial paper iL Sole 24 Ore, based on
input from an unnamed source. The report indicated that Enron is being
targeted by Eni for an equity partnership or even a full merger. Mincato,
as recently as Tuesday of this week, continues to adamantly deny that any
deal with Enron is being studied.

Not surprisingly, Enron is remaining mum on the rumors and has not even
mentioned Eni in any recent disclosures. However, the incorporation of
Eni's power production portfolio would support Enron's expansion into new
markets such as Japan, for example. Back in March, the Japanese government
began allowing non-utility firms to supply power to industrial and
commercial
end-users. Almost simultaneously, Enron established a new subsidiary, Enron
Japan Corp., to capitalize on new opportunities in the country. Enron
Japan's
first offer is a 10-percent discount off current electricity prices for
customers who sign on with Enron for two to four years. Operating against
its North American strategy, Enron also plans to build a power station
in northern Japan, beating to the punch several of its key rivals, including

Vivendi, Texaco and Royal Dutch Shell, which also have expressed interest
in establishing operations in the country.

Enron's proposed power plant should give the company prime access to
companies
in the Tohoku and Kanto regions, as well as Tokyo, the "big catch" of the
Japanese market. In my opinion, herein lies the primary synergy that would
make the partnership between Eni and Enron a strategic step for both
companies.
As Eni attempts to position itself in various key markets, Japan seems
like a natural location, and I've seen no reports that indicate Eni is
moving into Japan on its own. The fact that Enron is already there, along
with most other lucrative international markets, must certainly be appealing

to Eni. Regarding Enron's perspective on any potential partnering, Eni's
substantial oil and natural-gas generation assets, along with its current
lock on the European market, must be very attractive.

Enron's current market capitalization is about $48 billion, which actually
makes it larger than Eni. This raises the question of which company would
be the buying partner if a merger were to indeed take place. All of the
rumors flying around currently speak of Eni pursuing Enron, but it could
just as easily be the other way around. Those of us who follow Enron closely

may find it hard to believe that the powerhouse company would ever be the
target for a takeover or even a merger. In any case, the rumors continue
to fly as Eni responds to claims of "thou doth protest too much." Whether
or not any such merger between Eni and Enron, which appears smart on paper,
will materialize remains to be seen. However, it certainly seems like Eni
is lining up its chess pieces to cement some kind of partnership in the
very near future.

Dear Directors and Auditors:

We would like to rearrange the next BOD meeting schedule.
As you know, the BOD decided to have the next BOD meeting on Feb. 8th, 2001=
.
However, we think it is difficult to have the next BOD meeting on that date
because of preparation of financial statement.
Please understand that subsidiaries' financial statement should be=20
consolidated
prior to SK-Enron's financial statement and this process is our main concer=
n.
Considering this situation, we suggest to have the next BOD Meeting at 2pm =
on
Feb. 20th, 2001. in Houston.
And meeting place in Houston will be notified you when it is determined.
If you are uncomfortable with this schedule,
please let us know so that we can arrange it again.

Sincerely yours,

K.R.Choi

Hello James, 


Near the end of July Oscar Ballesteros asked me to sent the Annual Accounts for TEE for signature to Adam Umanoff, because Herbert Peels was on vacation. 

After Adam?s signature, he sent the documents to you directly. Do you have the documents yet? 

If you have the documents, please could you sign them and send them  to Herbert Peels as soon as possible. 

Thank you for your help in advance

Klett Rooney Lieber & Schorling - headquartered in Pittsburgh, PA - to

I just returned to town and picked up your message re Enron General
Counsel's son and SMU. I am going to Washington early in the morning,
returning Wednesday evening.

I would be delighted to send a letter of recommendation to SMU Law School.
As a member of the School's Board of Visitors, I have had some success with
admissions, and would be happy try to help here. If he will send me a copy
of his college summary, I will prepare a letter and send it this week.

Hopefully, it will help. As you know, SMU is a long-time client, and Kay and
I, as well as the Firm, are significant money contributors to the School.

Subject: Your Calls on My Behalf




Jim,

This is a note to let you know what happened as per your calls on my behalf.

The short answer is not much.

I had lunch with John Keffer and Randy Coles of King & Spalding.  We had a
cordial conversation, but I concluded and stated that the firm was well
covered regarding the skills that I might offer.

John Klauberg and I had a most enjoyable breakfast.  He seemed interested.
However, I haven't heard any thing.

Pat Oxford didn't return my call. I spoke with Lynn Coleman, but didn't hear
any thing back.

Vicky Price and I have exchanged calls, but haven't had a chance to speak.

On another fronts, I was contacted by Strasburger regarding their Mexico and
other Latin work.  They claim to have done a little work for Enron.  Also, I
am still in discussions with Shook, Hardy & Bacon, the Kansas City firm with
about 40 lawyers here in Houston.

Before anything get finalized, I would like to run it by you just to get an
independent reaction.

Thanks for your support and help.

Mont

Subject: Potential Lawsuit Versus Copel, Petrobras, Compagas, and Compagas 
Board Members

Privileged and Confidential Attorney-Client Communication;  Attorney Work 
Product

We may need to file a suit this week or next to enjoin the signing of a gas 
supply agreement between Petrobras and Compagas.  As you know, Enron 
(Dutapar), Copel, and Petrobras are the three shareholders of Compagas.  
Copel has as interest (along with El Paso) in the power plant which would use 
the gas.  A contract has already been signed between Compagas and the plant.  
The Compagas Board votes on the agreement tomorrow.  The gas supply contract 
would have a 20-year term and would be worth $1.2 billion.  The ground for 
the suit would be that, under Brazilian law, Compagas is required to solicit 
bids for the gas supply arrangement.   Compagas has sought to justify not 
soliciting bids on the basis that Petrobras is the only supplier capable of 
supplying the gas.  This is incorrect:  Enron, among others, is also capable 
of supplying the gas.  We have a legal opinion supporting our position. and 
have called for a special shareholders' meeting to discuss the issue.  We 
anticipate that Petrobras and Copel, despite their obvious conflict of 
interest, will force the issue and will vote in favor of the agreement 
nonetheless. 

Tozzini Freire has been advising us, and is doing an excellent job.  If you 
approve, we would like to continue to use them if litigation is necessary.   

Please call me or Randy with any comments or questions.

Thank you.

We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=

are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=

opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=

new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=

of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=

Jim, I need to apologize and confess I skipped the call this morning because
of an uncontrollable addiction to the Presidential election proceedings. 
David Boies and Barry Richards were just too much to pass up.  Sorry.  
Not much here.  We settled the Beaver lease cases at the same price we paid
the other lessors and without any of their attorney fees.  Good result.  We
have FERC approval of the Sierra sale.  SEC looks good for Jan or Feb.  
I am working with Richard Sanders and Robin Gibb on defense to the California
class actions.  
We have a new offer from BNFL that will be the subject of a conference call
soon.  Looks like they will pay us about 75% of our damages to go away.  
One new risk is the upcoming cold spell and very high Northwest prices.  This
will cost us a lot of money, possibly not recoverable from customers, and may
spread the litigation over high prices to the Northwest.  This could develop
as a risk to the Sierra sale in the extreme, but right now appears manageble. 
More on this as it develops.  The Enron litigation team is here on Monday and
we will cooperate on strategy and resources as prudent.  
Finally, we have received a settlement offer on the Grant County case that
looks good and we are pursuing it.  Al.

=DJ Enron, Powerex Investigated For Alberta Price Fixing
11/21/0 15:31 (New York)



      By Cheryl Devoe Kim
      Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

  TORONTO (Dow Jones)--Canada's Competition Bureau raided the offices of Enron
Canada Corp. in Calgary and Powerex Corp. in Vancouver earlier this year as
part of an investigation into suspected electricity price fixing by the two
companies, according to documents obtained by Dow Jones Newswires.
  Bureau investigator David Bloom alleges in an application for a warrant he
used to gain access to the offices that in the summer of 1999, Powerex and
Enron were coordinating bid restatements and inflating the price each received
for electricity as they traded on the Power Pool of Alberta.
  The investigation hasn't yet produced any charges against either of the
companies, according to Enron. The Competition Bureau declined to comment on
the status of the case.
  Both Enron Corp. (ENE), which owns Enron Canada, and Powerex, a unit of
provincially owned British Columbia Hydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), deny
breaking any rules or laws.
  From Powerex's point of view, Albertans are looking for someone to blame for
high power prices, which have become a political issue in the province.
  "They just find it easy to blame us for what are pretty fundamental market
design flaws," Powerex president and chief executive Ken Peterson told Dow
Jones Newswires in an interview.
   Deregulation Spurs Search For Someone To Blame
  The search for someone to blame has repeated itself across every 
deregulating
market Enron has participated in, Enron Corp. spokesman Mark Palmer said.
  "Almost every time that either power markets or natural gas markets or even
oil markets or gasoline markets have experienced any kind of price volatility,
there have been investigations done," Palmer said.
  Enron has been scrutinized before as part of wider energy markets
investigations, he said, but never found to be breaking the rules. This is the
first such investigation into Powerex's actions, Peterson said.
  The Competition Bureau, based in Ottawa, won't say whether the investigaion
is ongoing, citing disclosure rules under the Competition Act.
  The companies themselves said they're not sure of the investigation's 
status.
Their seized files were returned several months ago, but Powerex hasn't heard
from the Bureau since then. Enron did receive a call from the Bureau last week
with a question, according to Enron Corp. spokesman Eric Thode.
  The investigation began when the Power Pool of Alberta's system controllers
noticed the clearing price for a megawatt of electricity was topping C$100 
with
unusual frequency.
  The Pool's price is set by participants submitting bids to buy or sell power
for the following day. Until Oct. 19, 1999, a bidder could restate the amount
of power in a bid or offer an unlimited number of times, until 20 minutes
before the hour of transmission. The price paid for every megawatt of power
needed by the Pool in a given hour is set by the most expensive unit needed to
meet demand.
   Alleged Bid Rigging Methods Detailed
  According to the Competition Bureau search warrant application, Powerex and
Enron were rigging their bids in the following manner:
  Powerex would lower the volume of an existing offer. As little as two 
minutes
later, Enron would increase its offer for the same period by the same volume,
but at a "significantly higher price," according to the warrant application.
Sometimes, Enron would increase its offer even before Powerex had dropped its
offer.
  Power Pool market analyst Owen Craig, who once worked in Enron Canada's gas
trading group, found that "as a result of restatements, involving mostly
Powerex and Enron," the Pool price was raised once to C$200/MWh, four times to
between C$354.29 and C$499.93, three times to between C$500 and C$541.63, and
10 times to between C$801.02 and C$998.
  Based on the restatement patterns, Craig, and then the Bureau's Bloom,
concluded that no new energy was being offered to the Pool. They believed the
power was just being transferred from Powerex to Enron and then offered at the
higher price, according to the warrant application. By cutting the volume
offered by Powerex, the more expensive power offered by Enron would likely be
needed, and every participant would get the higher price.
  Powerex's Peterson doesn't take issue with the trade history as detailed by
the Bureau, but denies that the company's traders were doing anything wrong or
that the two companies had some sort of arrangement.
  "And we're adamant about that," Peterson said. "There was no deal with 
Enron.
There was no expectation about what their behavior would lead to in terms of a
change in prices or anything like that."
  Powerex traders were merely locking in their price, cutting the company's
risk, which Enron agreed to take on by buying the power at a fixed price,
Peterson said.
  "Whenever Enron's offer of high-priced energy was declined, within moments 
of
Enron being advised by the Pool that their energy would not be required,
Powerex would restate an identical volume of energy back into its lower priced
unit," according to the warrant application.
  Peterson's response: "We're operating in a very tight market there and we
felt an obligation to make sure the power got delivered into Alberta."
  Enron also denies it broke any Power Pool rules or Canadian laws.
  "It boils down to we were offered power at a price lower than we thought we
could sell it at," Enron's Thode said. "And that's what Enron and every other
company does that's in the business of trading."
  The May 25 search warrant covers the companies' actions between June 1, 
1999,
and Oct. 19, 1999. On Oct. 20, 1999, the Pool changed its restatement rules,
essentially closing the loophole, though it did so without ever making public
its investigation into Powerex and Enron.
  Power Pool spokesman Wayne St. Amour declined to discuss details of the
investigation.
  "Market surveillance is in place to, among other things, protect the
interests and activities of market participants," he said.
  Those convicted under Canadian law for bid-rigging can be fined an amount at
the court's discretion and/or jailed up to five years. A conviction wouldn't
likely affect Powerex's ability to trade in the U.S., Peterson said. In Canada
"there would have to have some follow-on action by the Alberta parties to
inhibit that. And so far, they still like to get our power."
  Companies Concerned About Reputations
  The bigger problem, Peterson said, is what the case will do to the Powerex
reputation.
  "Essentially both companies are concerned about it because we have a lot at
stake from a reputational point of view," Peterson said. "Both companies, I
believe, conduct themselves in the highest possible standard. But these are
difficult times in the business with prices going crazy in Alberta and
California and people looking for somebody to blame. There's always a
possibility of collateral damage when politics gets involved."
  Powerex parent company BC Hydro is also suspected by the Power Pool of
Alberta of unfairly providing access to transmission through British Columbia,
linking Washington with Alberta, as detailed in an Oct. 13 Power Pool market
surveillance report. Again, no charges have been laid.

 The very first time that I laid eyes on  Steve Susman , he was clad only in 
his underwear.  Moreover, he was  shouting  and angrily brandishing his fist 
at me!  The Northern Lights may have seen stranger sights, but I assure you I 
have not.

 In 1968 or 1969 (you will understand that I have repressed the actual date), 
I journeyed to Fort Worth, Texas as a representative of the Texas Law Review 
to attend some State Bar of Texas committee meeting, one being held, I think, 
in conjunction with an annual meeting of the Bar.  The Law Review had 
reserved a few rooms at one of the downtown hotels.  I arrived late at 
night,  dutifully registered at the hotel's desk, received my room  key,  
took the elevator to the designated floor, walked to my room, inserted the 
room key, and opened the door.  The darkness that shrouded the room was 
suddenly pierced by a flare of light that revealed to my astonished eyes a 
bear of a man, almost naked, leaping out of the bed toward me, shaking a very 
large fist in the vicinity of my face, and demanding to know why I had 
violated the sanctity of his room!  

 It will surprise none who know Steve to learn that although he was  
adamantly insisting  on an explanation, he refused to be quiet long enough 
for me to offer him one.  Knowing even at my then tender young age a madman 
when I see one, I exited  the scene of the controversy with as much speed as 
my terrified legs could muster and rushed back to the front desk with my tale 
of adventure and close escape from severe bodily injury.  There may well have 
been some talk of calling hotel security or the Fort Worth Police, but in the 
end I settled for a new room, the door of which I bolted immediately. 

 After a mostly sleepless night during which I anticipated the imminent 
reappearance of the madman, I arose, showered,  dressed, and carefully made 
my way to the meeting room.  During the course of the day, I spotted the 
madman across the ballroom engaged in conversation with another individual.  
Surreptitiously pointing him out to one of my friends, I asked if he knew 
him.  The answer was no, but he did know who he was.  "The name is Susman, my 
man, Steve Susman".  I immediately resolved that my path and that of  
"Susman, my man, Steve Susman" would never again cross.  

 Truth is indeed stranger than fiction.  How could I have possibly foreseen 
as I fled from the madman in  that Forth Worth hotel room so many years ago 
that not only would my path again cross his but that I would one day serve as 
his lawyer, that  he  would serve as mine,  and that I would count him  as 
one of my closest friends!  I hereby officially  forgive you, Steve, not only 
for stealing my  Fort Worth hotel room but also  for the injury you wished on 
me that night.  Looking back on it, I wouldn't want it to have been  any 
other way.

 I wish you the Happiest of Birthdays, Steve.  Thanks for your friendship--I 
treasure it. 

 All the best, 

 Jim

Subject: TECASO Project - Outside Counsel

Jim,

We are currently reviewing a new business opportunity with EES to enable 
EECC  to provide technical and commercial due diligence services for global 
infrastructure project financing.  If the new business opportunity receives 
approval from EES management, we see the need to retain outside counsel 
experienced in internet/web based issues.  Presently this need would be with 
the web, structuring, IP, and antitrust areas.

In an effort  to find a firm that Enron has used recently for web related 
matters, I spoke with Mark Taylor and Marianne Castano.  For Enron Online 
development, Mark used Sullivan and Cromwell and Milbank, Tweed for the 
web/trading effort and V & E for IP matters,  For a recent EES internet 
project Marianne used Vivian Polak of LeBeouf Lamb for web/transactional 
issues and V & E for IP matters.  She was very pleased with Vivian's 
support.  After discussing our specific requirements with Mark and Marianne 
and reviewing this matter with Vicki Sharp,  I spoke with Vivian briefly to 
confirm if she had the experience we needed.  I found she had exactly what we 
needed and subsequently discussed this with John Schwartzenburg.  John 
agreed. 

With your approval I would like permission to engage Vivian Polak of LeBeouf, 
Lamb for web, structuring and transactional related issues and Scott Brown of 
V & E for IP matters.  

If you should need any additional information concerning the TECASO Project 
or this request, please let me know.

Thank you,

Randy

Jim, in connection with your interest in identifying a top notch litigator
in California to look after Enron's interests in California, I would
recommend you consider David Balabian and Chris Hockett of the firm of
McCutchen Doyle Brown and Enerson LLP. McCutchen is a 300+ lawyer firm with
its main office in San Francisco and offices in Los Angles, Palo Alto and
Walnut Creek. The firm has a very strong reputation in major commercial
litigation (antitrust, securities fraud etc) and technical and IP
litigation. I believe ENA has worked with McCutchen in the past on some
power plant matters. Rob Walters has worked closely with Chris Hockett (who
I have also met) and has a very high opinion of his abilities. I concur that
Chris (a 40ish commercial litigator) is a very impressive individual. David
Balbanian, more senior than Chris, is apparently widely known as one of the
leading commercial litigators in  Northern California. Establishing a
relationship with David and Chris would give you the judgment and access I
assume you would want. Let me know if I can provide any additional
information.  Joe

Subject: Celina Ozorio

Jim: 

Celina Ozorio is a paralegal in the Rio office who has performed very well 
this past year and who we would like recommend for promotion to a junior 
attorney (Attorney I) position.  I have discussed this with both Randy and 
Rob and they support this move.  

Celina is a Brazilian-qualified lawyer with a U.S. LLM who was hired a year 
ago as a paralegal rather than as an attorney due to her relative lack of law 
firm experience.  During the past year she has been enthusiastic in pursuing 
her professional development and demonstrating her capabilites as a 
professional.  She has actively sought out opportunities to take on more 
responsibility and to learn more about our business and has worked very hard 
to win the confidence of the lawyers and clients with whom she works.  We 
believe that she has demonstrated the ability to operate at the junior 
attorney level now and the potential to develop into a solid senior Enron 
attorney in the future.  As a junior attorney, she would continue to work 
under the supervision of more senior attorneys and would have the opportunity 
to continue her professional development.  

I understand that we have done this elsewhere in the Company and believe that 
it sends the right message to others in the department that there are 
opportunities for advancement and that hard work and merit are rewarded.

Please let me know how you feel about this recommendation and whether you 
think it would be appropriate for us to schedule her to visit with you in 
Houston.  Thanks.

Regards,
 John

Vicki:  I am familiar with the firm, but we have never used them to represent 
any of the EFS companies to my knowledge.  I am certain that we do not have 
any current matters with this firm.  You will note that they do not appear on 
our list of approved counsel.  We typically use Reed Smith in Pittsburgh.

 I do know some people at this firm if I can be of any assistance.  I went to 
law school with Artie Rooney at Duquesne University.  You may know that his 
family owns the Pittsburgh Steelers.  Let me know the particular attorney you 
are having difficulty with and I will help in any way can.  By the way, New 
Power's ads have hit the airwaves in Pittsburgh.  I am enrolling as a New 
Power customer!  Thanks, Marty

Jim:  please see the attached, from Joe Halprin.  Does the Enron family have 
any relationships with the Klett Rooney law firm that we should bring to 
their attention?  In all events, please be aware that they are taking a 
particularly adverse position.  Thanks.  Marc

Marc:  In connection with a dispute regarding a commercial arrangement 
between NewPower and Campus Dimensions, Inc. (also known as College Credit 
Card Corporation), Campus Dimensions, Inc. ("CDI") has engaged the law firm 
Klett Rooney Lieber & Schorling - headquartered in Pittsburgh, PA - to 
represent them against NewPower.  Klett Rooney has conducted themselves in a 
fashion that I would consider to be particularly unreasonable.  I would like 
to know if Enron has a relationship with Klett Rooney or CDI. If they do, I 
would recommend that the firm be removed from further engagements. Thanks.

=09=09 cc:=20
=09=09 Subject: Organizational Changes

We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into Enron Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=
=20
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=
=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

Enron Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20
Americas.

Enron Europe
The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20
and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=
=20
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=
=20
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the=
=20
commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=
=20
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=
=20
EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=
=20
newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=
e=20
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,=
=20
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=
ed=20
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=
=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=
=20
the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=
=20
European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin=
ue=20
to support all other Enron businesses operating in their respective regions=
=20
and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi=
ef=20
of Staff.
Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region=
al=20
basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20
Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue=
=20
in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=
r=20
will have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as=
=20
well as providing support for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Assets.=
 =20
These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship=
=20
to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications.
Business Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to co=
ver=20
EWS reporting in addition to his current role in North America.

continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes.

around the world, we are considering a variety of options with respect to=

EGEP and EWC.  As a consequence, we are putting these businesses under Clif=
f=20
Baxter=01,s direction.  Jeff Sherrick, CEO of EGEP, and Jim Noles, CEO of E=
nron=20
Wind, will report to Cliff.

CORPORATE STAFF

 We are consolidating the corporate staff functions: Human Resources,=20
Government Affairs, Public Relations/Communications and Administration.  In=
=20
that regard, Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President of Human Resources and=
=20
Community Relations, will report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President an=
d=20
Chief of Staff.

COMMITTEE STRUCTURE

 In light of the increased leadership opportunities created by Enron=01,s=
=20
growth, the Executive Committee will be expanded to include more of our=20
business unit leaders.  The primary role of this committee will continue to=
=20
be the communication of relevant information across Enron=01,s businesses a=
nd=20
the coordination of activities across those businesses.  We will also be=20
drawing on this group to lead company-wide initiatives such as the=20
performance review process and evaluation and creation of new businesses. =
=20
The Executive Committee membership is shown on the attached list.

 We are also forming a new committee =01) the Enron Corporate Policy Commit=
tee. =20
This group will be responsible for overall corporate policy, personnel=20
