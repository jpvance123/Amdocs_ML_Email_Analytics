After a spell of private medical crisis which had the effect of distorting my 
professional schedule, I am, for better or worse, back in the professional 
saddle.  My private life remains, as always, full of much upheaval, creative 
energy and manic playfulness.  My beloved Dona Lisa is going to be fine. The 
trip to St. Louis was not meant to be.  Jan got everything cancelled without 
any loss of money to Enron shareholders.  I am back in the trenches trying to 
get the PacifiCorp EEI done so Harlan can have the pleasure of working 
through the big mother of all call options on JUNE 1, your big kickoff date 
for living happily ever after.  Hope everything went well with Steve down 
there.  I'm looking forward to assessing his reactions to the big E in 
Houston. ----cgy

Attached is the EWS Tax Group's analysis of California Assembly Bill No. 128 
- the proposed "excise tax" on energy marketer's gross receipts on the sale 
of electricity in excess of a predetermined amount (initially set at 
$60/megawatt).  Please call me with any questions.  Best regards.  Steve.

Elizabeth:
Sorry I haven't got back to you sooner.  Can you give me your home number?  I 
think that weekends would be easier to schedule since weekdays are still 
fairly hectic.  I'll call you soon.  How about this heat?  Fortunately, I've 
been playing early in the mornings or late at night so it's not too bad.  
I've also am hooked on watching the Open every day - a fringe benefit to 
maternity leave.  Tonight should be great.  I hope one of the Williams' gets 
beat.  talk to you soon.

Hi Carol!

Thrilled to hear all is going well.  I would love to play tennis anytime 
(hopefully sooner rather than later so I can take advantage of  that 
lingering fatigue that takes months? years? to abate).  We can play at the 
Met either around lunchtime or sometime after 4:00.  Weekends would also 
work.  Can you play next Tuesday or Wednesday?  Call or write.

See you soon

Elizabeth and Christian:

This morning I spoke with Geritt Hull, Bonneville's trading lawyer, about 
putting an EEI in place between Enron and BPA.  He said there was "no 
interest" in using the EEI at this time.  Before, the agency resisted using 
the agreement because it was unfamiliar with the EEI.  Now, however, the 
agency has reviewed the EEI---and decided it didn't like what it saw.  This 
"review" appears to have consisted of (1) an internal legal meeting and (2) a 
meeting this morning between Geritt and Dave Mills (who heads BPA's trading 
floor).  After a first look, BPA has the following concerns about the EEI:


1.  If BPA does some transactions under the EEI, it will then have two 
different agreements.  BPA prefers having one standardized agreement (WSPP).

2.  The Schedule M provisions are unfavorable to governmental entities.  The 
WSPP does not have these additional obligations.  

3.  Tracking of credit/mark to market exposure is a concern for BPA because 
it does not have systems in place to do this.  I explained to Geritt that 
these provisions would be for BPA's benefit.  BPA need not calculate these 
amounts day-to-day; it could wait until it hit the "nervous nellie" standard, 
and then do the calculations, at which time, if the thresholds had been met, 
it could call for more collateral.  This seemed to help; BPA had seen this 
part as a burden---"oh, we'll have to start doing daily mark-to-market 
calculations!"

4.  "This agreement seems to favor marketers."  I reminded Geritt that BPA is 
a marketer, too.  "Well, we haven't been selling much lately.  We're buyers 
now." (This is a disconcerting because at this time of year BPA is usually 
spilling water for salmon AND selling lots of extra power).  

5.  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the head of BPA's trading floor, 
Dave Mills, is opposed to the agreement because he doesn't want to use a 
second master.


I asked Geritt who could say "yes" to the EEI and he said, "Dave Mills, if 
anyone."  But he also said that "like everything at BPA, a decision like this 
would be part of a broad consensus."  

Geritt has been charged with preparing an analysis of the two agreements.

Next Steps

Christian has suggested that we ask Greg Wolfe and Holli Krebs to put 
pressure on the BPA traders to use this agreement.

I am taking Geritt to lunch on Wednesday.

----Steve

   





Geritt said that BPA has given the EEI an internal review and decided not to 
made the following conclusions:

1.  Using the EEI

Peter:

This note will confirm my voice mail to you.  I have spoken with LeBoeuf on 
this and I think we are all right here.  Remember that PG&E is responsible to 
pay post-filing, but pre-termination gas bills as post-petition obligations.  
That would explain somewhat the action taken by PG&E since the filing was 
made on April 6.  I do not think there would be a problem in sending a letter 
that would reserve our position as to the remainder of the pre-petition 
invoice, but would leave that up to you.  If you decide to go in that 
direction, I would like an opportunity to take a look at that letter.

Trust all else is well.

Jeff

I am just again following up as to what we should do with these partially 
paid invoices.  I would want to be careful that we do not set a precedent for 
accepting less than full payment.  Peter.

Hi Peter

Pacific Gas and Electric paid us for gas purchases on May 25 for April 
production.
They paid amounts larger than the post bankruptcy invoice totals. 


Here are the details:

1. Pre Bankruptcy invoice for April 1-12 deliveries.

  4136SA   852,780.50 US

  Payment Rec'd  458,687.37 US

 It appears that they paid 53.787% of the pre bankruptcy invoice.


2. Pre Bankruptcy invoices for April 1-12 deliveries

  4120SA   2,033,749.68 CDN
  4138SA   2,797,179.00 CDN
     ------------------
  Subtotal  4,830,928.68 CDN

 Post Bankruptcy invoices for Apr 13-30 deliveries

  4139SA   3,425,804.71 CDN


 Total all sales for April production

     8,256,733.39 CDN

  Payment Rec'd  6,024,238.66 CDN


 It appears that they paid 53.787% of the pre bankruptcy invoice.


Please let me know what you want me to do with the excess payment.
Thanks
Cheryl

I agree with their comments, although credit may have something to say about 
the change made in the ISDA language from "owed" to "payable".  Alos, should 
we include affiliates on both sides?

Hello Steve,

Thank you for returning my call.  Attached are two spreadsheets representing 
the exposure we have with the PX and ISO.  There has been no change to the 
receivables due.  PGE did not engage in transactions beyond the expiration of 
the DOE order February 7th.

The only other exposure we have with PG&E is a payable in the amount of 
$704.318 with PG&E Energy Trading, Canada Corp for gas we purchased in March.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks...

This is our argument now on appeal in Entergy source and sink -- that FERC 
has always deferred to NERC and totally disregarded the NERC letters against 
TVA and MAIN in the Entergy order.  FERC staff's quote should be helpful in 
our brief at the DC Circuit.

Subject: Trading on Inside Information

In a meeting yesterday with some ENA traders, it was argued that in the 
finanical markets people are not allowed to trade in a stock if they have 
material information that would move the market.

In the power business, people that control 15,000 MW are allowed to buy and 
sell financial products with the "inside" knowledge that their units may be 
off.  Is this illegal or could we make it illegal?  What are the restrictions 
here?

I guess the issue also involves CFTC regulation, or lack of regulation?  If 
FERC has the field, why don't we continue to push for more market 
transparency?

Jim

 It has become customary to prepare Unanimous Consents of Directors for many 
transactions even if such actions are not required by the relevant By-laws 
and/or Certificate of Incorporation.  Please consider carefully whether 
Unanimous Consents of Directors are necessary or appropriate in a particular 
transaction, i.e., the transaction is a significant transaction or evidence 
of authority is required for a legal opinion.  When in doubt, please review 
the By-laws and Certificate of Incorporation of the relevant entity and 
discuss the matter with a member of the Office of the General Counsel.

Thank you.

I've received requests to convene a meeting of the Drafting Committee.  The 
purpose of the meeting would be to reach closure on the optional product 
definitions and other provisions (esp. the credit annex) that would be made 
available on the EEI website.  We should also discuss how to rectify the 
numerous typos that have been identified on the cover sheet and the GT&Cs.    
Would meeting sometime during late May or during June pose a problem?  I am 
also pretty much open during July and the first two weeks of August. I've 
attached a calendar w/ dates I'm not available.  If you could print the 
calendar; fill dates you are not available and fax to Patricia at 
202-508-5673 by COB Friday we can come up with a meeting date.  My first 
choice would be to have the meeting in D.C., but would be willing to go to 
another location.

FYI, John Varholy and I will be speaking at a conference on competitve 
electricity markets from 5/7-5/10 in Zagreb Croatia hosted by USAID.  I'll be 
talking about U.S. standard commodity contracts and John will be discuss EFET 
and Nordpool.  Also, I'll be speaking in Houston on May 15 at Energy & Power 
Risk Management 2001 on the EEI.  If you want to talk about the drafting 
commitee meeting I'll been in the office for the rest of the week and then 
out for two weeks.

Elizabeth - Since Rogers Herndon has moved on to work on a special project 
for EES and Janice Moore has left, I wanted to revitalize our efforts on 
getting the necessary authority documents that we have discussed so many 
times in the past.  Since our trading volume seems to be picking up, I wanted 
to make sure that an atty is assigned the project.  

Please let me know who that person will be so that I can follow up.

Subject: How FERC's proposed order will affect Enron contracts
Mime-Version: 1.0

As a starting point for briefing Mark, I thought I would open the dialogue by 
listing the proposed remedies and my thoughts on whether each would impact 
Enron's existing contracts.  Keep in mind that FERC's remedies for the 
California market are only proposals that may or may not be adopted.

Below I have listed all of the proposed remedies, with comments next to or 
below each proposed remedy.

1.  Eliminating requirement that the California IOUs buy/sell into the Cal 
PX: The IOUs will no longer be required to sell all generation into and buy 
all of their requirements from the PX.  This will allow the IOUs to act as 
their own scheduling coordinator instead of using the PX as a scheduling 
coordinator.  It is expected that the IOUs will enter into more bilateral 
contracts.

 I can't think of how this would affect contacts, but I would suggest that if 
the IOUs pull out of the PX in a big way, the PX market will be more thinly 
traded/less liquid, leading to more volatile prices at the PX.  

2.  Penalty Charge for Load Deviations Greater Than 5% of Actual Load:  If 
actual load deviates from its schedule by more than 5%, the ISO will impose a 
penalty charge of two times the ISO's real time energy cost for balancing 
energy (twice the inc price).

 We should review our contracts to determine if they allocate this penalty to 
the appropriate party.  

3.  Removal of the Existing ISO and PX Governing Boards:  Probably a good 
idea, but I can't see how this will affect our contracts.

4.  Interconnection Procedures:  FERC has directed the ISO to develop 
standard tariff provisions to facilitate the interconnection of new and 
existing generators seeking to increase the rated capacity of their facility 
in California.

 Will this affect any contracts that the Origination group is working on?  
Because this proposed ISO's new tariff language has yet to be written, I 
would suggest that its effect on contracts at this time is remote.

5.  Long Term Suggestions:  The FERC also made the following suggestions:  
(1) The ISO and the load serving entities in California should develop market 
rules to ensure sufficient supply; (2) consider alternatives to the 
single-price auction; (3) eliminate the balanced schedule requirement by 
intergrating PX and ISO day-ahead demand and supply bids into one venue; (4) 
develop less-intrusive market mitigation remedies, i.e., no price caps; (5) 
redesign the congestion management system; (6) develop demand response 
programs that would allow loads to bid into the market offers to reduce 
demand; and, (6) conform the ISO to the requirements of RTOs under Order 888 
and Order 2000.  

 Since these are suggestions, and may never materialize, I do not think we 
need to modify our contracts at this time in response to these proposed 
changes.

6.  Refunds:  FERC has said that it will not order refunds for unjust and 
unreasonable rates for the period before October 2, 2000.  Going forward, 
FERC may order refunds for unjust and unreasonable rates for the period Oct 
2, 2000 through October 2, 2002.  

 Should we put a provision in our confirms or contracts that would make 
counterparties waive their rights to assert that such prices were unjust and 
unreasonable for that transaction?

7.  Price Caps:  FERC has proposed a $150 'soft' price cap.  The market 
clearing price would be capped at $150, but parties can submit higher bids.  
If a higher bid is submitted, that party would be required to submit 
transaction information to the ISO or PX detailing the generation cost and 
any legitimate opportunity cost.

 I would echo the point below about any reviewing any contracts tied to index 
prices.  
 
 How will we provide the "incremental generation cost," since we are only the 
marketer?  We may have to contractually require parties to provide us the 
information.  This would also raise confidentiality issues.

Joe Hartsoe, Rick Shapiro, or Jim Steffes can fill you in on the details of 
what FERC did today.  One question you need to think about is how their 
decision on price caps affects any contracts which we may have indexed to 
California's spot market.  The way it reports the market clearing price will 
change fundamentally if prices over 150 will be accepted but not used to 
clear the market for all bids.  So, if we are using this as a reference price 
in our contracts it may trigger the need to look for alternatives.

USA: FACTBOX-FERC details changes for Calif power market.

11/01/2000
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2000.

WASHINGTON, Nov 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
on Wednesday approved several actions to revamp California's power market 
over the next two years. 
Immediate changes include the following:
* Eliminate requirement that three utilities - Pacific Gas & Electric, San 
Diego Power and SoCal Edison - must sell all of their power to and buy all 
their power from the state Power Exchange (PX). 
* Require market participants to schedule 95 percent of their transactions in 
the day-ahead markets to reduce chronic underscheduling of load and 
generation and over-reliance on the ISO's real-time imbalance market to meet 
supply. FERC also proposed a penalty charge for scheduling deviations in 
excess of 5 percent of hourly load requirements. 
* Temporary modification of the single-price auction so bids above $150 MWh 
cannot set the market clearing price paid to all bidders. 
* Establish independent, non-stakeholder governing boards for the California 
Power Exchange (PX) and Independent System Operator (ISO). 
* Create congestion management design proposal. 
* Establish generation inter-connection procedures. 
* Explore alternatives to the single price auction by the ISO and PX. 
* Develop market rules to ensure sufficient supply is available to meet load 
and reserve requirements. 
FERC also approved changes to protect wholesale customers from unreasonable 
rates during the time it will take to adopt longer-term market remedies. The 
following price mitigation measures will remain in effect until Dec. 31, 
2002: 
* Single-price auctions for all sales in the ISO and PX markets at or below 
$150 MWh. The single price would be used for all load which clears below this 
amount in the auction. 
* If an auction does not clear below the $150 MWh level, suppliers who choose 
to bid above $150 would be paid their price bid. In other words, the highest 
bid of the day, if above $150 per MWh, would no longer be the clearing price 
paid by all. 
* Sellers receiving above $150 per MWh would be required to report their bids 
to FERC on a weekly basis and provide certain cost information to the agency. 
* The ISO and PX would be required to report monthly information on such 
bids, allowing FERC to monitor competitive conditions and assure just and 
reasonable rates. Sellers would be subject to potential refund liability but 
no lower than their marginal or opportunity cost if FERC finds 
non-competitive conditions. The potential refund liability would extend the 
full 24 months it would take to implement the market reforms.

Federal banking holidays which are not NERC holidays.  Since they want the=

Thanks for your message.  I can meet with Jim Derrick on the 30th, and have 
flexibility to attend training on either the 29th or 31st.  One consideration 
is that Christian will be in St. Louis on the 31st and 1st; if Christian 
wants to attend the training session we should hold it on the 29th.

Enron will pay for my travel expenses, yes?

Best,

Steve

Elizabeth:

ISDA is holding an Energy conference on March 6th, 2001 at The Four Seasons
Hotel in Houston.  We would be delighted to have you speak again on the same
issues you discussed at our North American Energy and Developing Products
Committee meeting last October at The Regency Hyatt.

Please find attached a DRAFT agenda for the morning discussion for your
information.  I am in the process of finalizing the agenda and would
appreciate advice on selecting bullet points to describe briefly the
discussion on the Comparison of Master Agreements used in North America and
Europe.  I have allowed 45 minutes for the discussion (12:15 PM - 1:00 PM).
In addition, we would welcome any suggestions you may have on inviting an
ISDA member from a another company to help you discuss topic.

 <<elizabeth sager.doc>>

I will call you soon to discuss.

Thanks and regards,
Liz

Elizabeth,

As punishment for ignoring its pleas for price controls, last week the CPUC 
issued an order requiring the California IOUs to develop market-based rate 
tariffs for their Federal customers, e.g., military installations, federal 
agencies.  The CPUC thinks that by exposing the Federal government to current 
market prices it will cause Bush/Cheney to rethink price caps.  In any case, 
while I think this proposal is unconstitutional under the principles of the 
McCulloch v. Maryland case (states can't tax the federal gov.), I also think 
there might be a business opportunity here for EPMI in helping Federal 
enclaves lock in a fixed price for electricity.  In other words, offer these 
Federal entities a fixed-for-floating deal.  

Stewart Rosman suggested that the best way to handle this would be to offer 
the Federal entities a purely financial deal.  The Federal entities would 
continue to receive physical delivery from their utility but could lock in a 
fixed rate through a financial swap.

Before we get too far down the road on this, what are your thoughts?  Can the 
Federal gov., besides the U.S. Treasury, enter into derivatives contracts?  
While financial deals would appear to be superior because they involve less 
ongoing work (no physical scheduling or real time support), are there 
benefits to a physical transaction?  Any other ideas?

Steve

Good morning, Genia!!

 Attached is SRE's response to Enron's proposed Cover Sheet.  Note
that in the first section the blanks have been completed with various basic
info for the SRE operation.  In addition, SRE has included proposed changes
to certain Articles and to the General Terms and Conditions.  SRE's proposed
changes have been indicated with blue or red print.  For clarification,
could you briefly provide an explanation of the Exhibit B referenced in the
Prior Transactions paragraph in Part 1?

 Additionally, attached is a draft of SRE's Guaranty that has been
negotiated between our credit people which I understand is in its final
form.

 If you have any questions or require clarification, please advise
me.  Thanks for your assistance in processing this agreement.    Ron

Please see below from ISDA.  Do we ever want to go to using the ISDA for 
physical and financial deals?  Should this be a long range plan?   Mark

		 Subject: Single Master Agreement


As we discussed at the Board meeting last week, the impetus for a single
master agreement will need to come from several fronts, but especially from
within each of your firms. The various trade associations will be most
responsive to the idea if they are hearing strong support for a single
agreement from decision-making levels within member firms. We will
separately continue or commence a dialogue with the trade associations that
sponsor various agreements or are active in the areas of the financial
products that would be covered by such an agreement.

The trade associations we have identified as likely to be important to this
project are the following:

Securities Industry Association (US)
The Bond Market Association (US)
International Securities Market Association (principally Europe)
European Banking Federation (Europe)
The Foreign Exchange Committee (NY, London, Tokyo)
Emerging Markets Traders Association

The following associations may also be helpful to the process:

Australian Financial Markets Association
British Bankers Association
Japan Securities Dealers Association
Canadian Bankers Association
International Primary Markets Association (London-based)
ACI (The Foreign Exchange Association)(Paris-based)_

If your firm is active in any of these organizations, we encourage you to
discuss as soon as possible with your representative within that
organization the need to support the development of a single agreement for
financial products and urge them to express their support to the
associations. If it would be useful to share with them the thoughts in my
memorandum to the board, please feel free to do so. I have attached an
edited version which deletes the last couple of sections on my discussions
with the BMA, the Russo-Carlin group, Ernie Patrikis's letter and possible
approaches for ISDA.

I will try to contact each of you over the course of the next week to get
your feedback. In the meantime, if you have any questions, please do not
hesitate to email me or call me (212-332-2554)

Unfortunately I came down the flu yesterday and wasn't able to attend the 
meeting.  Please send me the minutes too.

I don't know how far things got yesterday, but I was going to volunteer to be 
on the smaller drafting committee that was talked about at the previous 
meeting.  If they are still looking for volunteers, I would be happy to 
volunteer.

No problem Richard. I hope the weather isn't too inclement - we've
only just begun here.....

I'll send along notes when complete. Incidentally, I will also
include minutes from last meeting - regrettably other issues have
kept me form completing them until this evening.

Warmest regards (no pun intended)

Dave

Janice, can you look at it as soon as you get off the conference call.  
Rogers wanted the confirms out by 9:00 this morning.  Otherwise, can we get 
Elizabeth to look at it.  Sharen dropped the language into the confirm that 
Shari had drafted for the previous deals with Entergy confirmed under the 
WSPP.  We have used this language in the past with the only difference being 
these are options.

Janice,

I found out these involve an "east" delivery point and the trader, Rodgers 
Herndon needs them looked at this morning.  Is is possible for you to review 
these ASAP?

Thanks,
Genia

P.S.  Christian, you are "off the hook"!!!

Since this involves the WSPP, would you have time to look at these and 
respond to Sharen?

Shari Stack had agreed to confirm non-firm deals with Entergy Services under 
the WSPP.  Then she reluctantly agreed to use the WSPP for a few month long 
term deals.  Well, now we have two options that they want to confirm under 
the WSPP.  We do not have any other existing agreement with Entergy 
Services.  I have dropped in the language Shari prepared for the month long 
deal.  Can someone take a look at these and see if this will confirm the deal.

Thanks!

Dear Mike,

As various companies have expressed on several occasions, Enron, Reliant and 
Constellation strongly believe that the WSPP should provide some guidance to 
the membership as to the various issues that are unique but must be addressed 
when dealing with municipalities in the west (such as Public Utility 
Districts, Cities, etc...).  As was evident during the Las Vegas meeting, 
several members do not seem to have any experience in this regard and 
therefore should at the very least be apprised of the issues that might 
confront them when entering into transactions with such entities.

While we agree with you that an amendment might not be the appropriate 
mechanism at this time for addressing this issue, we think that it is 
imperative that the WSPP educate its membership as to the potential pitfalls 
involved.  Therefore, we propose that Wright and Talisman draft a memo that 
describes the authorizations that entities involved in trading other 
commodities commonly request (i.e. statutory authorizations to transact, 
signature authorizations, resolutions setting forth transaction parameters, 
board resolutions, city council approvals, etc.).  We would also request that 
W&T point to some relevant examples over the last few years - specifically, 
City of Springfield, Illinois and Orange County - as well as any other 
guidance that W&T might be able on the topic.  

Therefore, this issue is different than what Morgan Stanley proposed during 
the Las Vegas meeting. 

With regard to bringing up issues which have already been addressed, it is 
our understanding that the WSPP Working Group overwhelmingly voted not to 
incorporate East product definitions into the WSPP.   Therefore, we wonder 
why it appears in the agenda for SFO meeting.


Thank you, 

Shari Stack, Enron 
Randy Osteen, Constellation 
Dede Russo, Reliant

of the worst summer of recorded history.  That is what working for one of the 
Fortune 500's top companies is all about. It's one of those intangibles.

This is a proposed margin agreement from Pacificorp.  We are out of the money 
over $250mm and they are getting nervous.  Tracy and I are trying to get them 
to sign an EEI but they are dragging their feet.  Let's discuss a strategy 
for moving forward.   

If this agreement is not bad from a legal perspective than I am okay with 
moving forward with some changes to the credit levels.  However, if it is not 
acceptable we should put pressure on them to sign an EEI.

Let's discuss.
Bill

Bill:  As a follow-up to our discussions last night we are sending a draft
form of proposed margin agreement.  The threshold amounts can be changed
based on our discussions. While I would prefer to use an EEI agreement,
unfortunately until I get some direction from our contract people this is
the agreement we would like to go with.

Thanks

Consumer advocates propose suing energy suppliers, which is consistent with 
the focus of the subpoena that PG&E wants the bankruptcy court to issue to 
suppliers.---sch
Who'll pay billions in PG&E debt? Consumers, taxpayers and asset sales are 
among the options.
By Claire Cooper
Bee Legal Affairs Writer
(Published June 11, 2001) 
A judge's decision not to meddle with electric rates has left open the 
biggest question in the Pacific Gas and Electric Co. bankruptcy case: Who 
will pay the utility's nearly $10 billion in bills? 
Ratepayers? Last week's decision by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali left 
rate-setting to the state Public Utilities Commission. But experts aren't 
ruling out PUC approval of major increases in the prices charged to PG&E's 
customers. 
Taxpayers? They'd foot the bill if the state bailed out the utility, another 
reportedly live option. 
Creditors? They could, as one consumer advocate says, "cannibalize" each 
other in competing for PG&E's assets. Though PG&E says creditors will all be 
paid in full, it hasn't said how long that will take. 
PG&E Corp., the utility's parent? It might be forced to infuse the utility 
with cash. PG&E also could sue energy wholesalers to recoup overcharges or 
could sell off its own power generators to raise cash. 
Until last week, when Montali made it known that he won't raise retail rates, 
the two major players in the bankruptcy proceedings -- the utility and the 
official creditors committee -- had agreed on most matters that came up in 
court, including the need for a rate increase. 
"Now, it's going to get maybe a little uglier and less friendly," predicts 
Jesse Fried, a bankruptcy law professor at the University of California, 
Berkeley. "It looks like they're just going to have to sit down and decide 
who's going to eat the loss." 
Fried says the "right answer" should be PG&E Corp., which requested 
deregulation of the energy market and profited from it until soaring 
wholesale prices left the utility subsidiary with massive debt, in part 
because retail rates were frozen. 
Between the time deregulation was passed and the end of 2000, the utility 
transferred $3.9 billion to its parent corporation before filing for 
bankruptcy protection April 6, according to a state-ordered audit. 
To force the corporation to repay the money, says Sacramento bankruptcy 
lawyer W. Austin Cooper, Montali would have to conclude that the transfer 
defrauded the utility's creditors. 
Montali has the power "to pierce the corporate veil" to find the answer, says 
Harvey Rosenfield, president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer 
Rights. 
But Cooper predicted a different scenario: sale of significant portions of 
PG&E assets -- such as generators or transmission lines -- to pay creditors 
and repay the state for electricity it has purchased on the wholesale market. 
At a meeting Thursday between the utility and some of its creditors, PG&E 
chief financial officer Kent Harvey said the utility's hydroelectric 
facilities are worth between $3.9 billion and $4.2 billion. James Lopes, the 
utility's bankruptcy lawyer, declared the subject of a possible sale off 
limits at the meeting. 
Rosenfield predicts it will remain off limits because, he says, the state 
would begin talking about seizing the generators rather than risk a sale to 
an out-of-state buyer. 
He favors another option: suing the out-of-state companies that have been 
charging the highest wholesale energy rates. 
"If I were the small business that supplies pencils and paper clips to PG&E, 
I would want to collect some money from the energy companies that overcharged 
PG&E for power until the state stepped in to buy the power in the utility's 
place," he said. 
If PG&E filed an antitrust case against those companies, it could be tried in 
Bankruptcy Court, according to Cooper. 
Discussion on that subject also was ruled off limits by Lopes. 
However, Harvey said the utility has requested a probe by the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission. 
And PG&E has been providing information to state agencies probing the 
out-of-state firms, spokesman Ron Low said. 
Rosenfield predicts growing pressure for a state-sponsored PG&E bailout like 
the $2.76 billion plan proposed by Gov. Gray Davis to keep Southern 
California Edison out of bankruptcy. 
Under the Davis proposal, the state would have spent $2.76 billion to buy 
that utility's power transmission lines. But the Legislature shelved Davis' 
plan, and Rosenfield warned that any such bailout would be forced to a public 
referendum, "along with any politicians who supported it." 
Stanford University bankruptcy law professor Marcus Cole says the long-range 
success of any plan for PG&E "depends entirely on the prospects for 
profitability" -- that is, pegging retail energy rates to wholesale costs. 
"PG&E is not a charity," Cole says. "It's there to provide a service. The 
only way it's going to do that is if it can generate profits."

Janet:
I left my comments in your chair.  I think that we need to decide how these 
provisions work with Article 8 of the EEI Master, particularly Sections 
8.1(c), 8.2(c),  and 8.3.  My vote would be to replace the language in the 
EEI master with the provisions that you drafted so that everything is in one 
place.      Let me know what you think.

I think Lisa's suggestion is a very positive way to get others involved in
the process as well as working through issues that credit managers may raise
when they read through the proposed credit annex.

Elizabeth:

ISDA is holding an Energy conference on March 6th, 2001 at The Four Seasons
Hotel in Houston.  We would be delighted to have you speak again on the same
issues you discussed at our North American Energy and Developing Products
Committee meeting last October at The Regency Hyatt.

Please find attached a DRAFT agenda for the morning discussion for your
information.  I am in the process of finalizing the agenda and would
appreciate advice on selecting bullet points to describe briefly the
discussion on the Comparison of Master Agreements used in North America and
Europe.  I have allowed 45 minutes for the discussion (12:15 PM - 1:00 PM).
In addition, we would welcome any suggestions you may have on inviting an
ISDA member from a another company to help you discuss topic.

 <<elizabeth sager.doc>>

I will call you soon to discuss.

Thanks and regards,
Liz

Sheri

Provided there is no other documentation which the counterparties have agreed 
to which sets out the form of the Confirmation, it may be easier to change 
the definition of Confirmation Letter, simply to state that a letter will be 
sent confirming the Transaction, leaving us the flexibility to decide what 
the form and substance of that document should be from time to time.

I have checked the site today, and we do not show Exhibit A on the website 
(if it is there, I sure can not find it....).  Do you all (Legal) think that 
we should going forward since we are going to eliminate sending the GTCs with 
our confirms?

Thanks

Melissa
 
Attached is the suggested template for physical power confirmations as 
discussed.

 As you know the "Confirmation Letter" is defined in the GTCs as being in the 
form attached as Exhibit A to the GTCs, any changes to the confirmation that 
the counterparties can expect to receive should also be reflected on the 
Website in Exhibit A.
 
Kind regards,
 
Marcus

Hello, I wanted to make sure I understand where the new language is to be 
inserted in our EOL GTC confirmation letter.  Bob Bowen was telling me they 
are putting the new paragraph at the beginning of the confirm letter.  The 
only problem I see is that we have the trade date and the energy type (firm 
energy, etc.) in the first paragraph as well.  We also already have language 
in the last paragraph about returning the confirm to us within 2 days.  

Please look at the following template and let me know where you would prefer 
to see the language added.  We are planning on changing our templates 
tomorrow morning.

I am not sure of what involvement will be needed by Canadian counsel, but I 
have spoken to Robert Anderson at Blakes, who acted for us on Blue Range.  
Robert can be reached at 403.260.9624.  Who is US counsel and is it 
worthwhile to put Robert in touch?  Peter.

Subject: Margin Agreements

This is a proposed margin agreement from Pacificorp.  We are out of the money 
over $250mm and they are getting nervous.  Tracy and I are trying to get them 
to sign an EEI but they are dragging their feet.  Let's discuss a strategy 
for moving forward.   

If this agreement is not bad from a legal perspective than I am okay with 
moving forward with some changes to the credit levels.  However, if it is not 
acceptable we should put pressure on them to sign an EEI.

Let's discuss.
Bill

Bill:  As a follow-up to our discussions last night we are sending a draft
form of proposed margin agreement.  The threshold amounts can be changed
based on our discussions. While I would prefer to use an EEI agreement,
unfortunately until I get some direction from our contract people this is
the agreement we would like to go with.

Thanks

Elizabeth - Good news, bad news.   

I have been confirmed as the co-chair of the committee,  I have been 
confirmed as the co-chair of the committee.
They have agreed to use the Enron Canadian EEI as the starting point, they 
want me to put together a memo describing/explaining the key provisions.
They think a physical or hybrid (whatever that is) is the way to go, most 
still do not agree it is a physical market.
It is a beautiful day with white fluffy snow falling, it is probably around 
-10 celcius.


With respect to bullet number 2 above, do you have anything to give me so I 
don't have to do the work?  Didn't you and Mark prepare something?  Is Andy's 
paper a better starting place?

Regards
CJG

As predicted Consumers have started the arbitration process. Andy Edison has 
been kept up to speed with all of this by me so between him and Dynegy we 
should be in good shape to progress.
 
If you need any other information please ask, otherwise I will keep you 
informed as this matter progresses, both from an arbitration stand-point and 
any attempts to commercially settle this dispute.

Hi Elizabeth,

I've had a couple of originators approach me about working on asset 
management type deals, optimizing third parties' power assets and/or 
purchase/sale of commodities.  A little birdie told me that you worked on 
something somewhat similiar to that a while back, but the deal didn't go.  
When you have a minute I would appreciate hearing about what you did.

Thanks,

Kay

Mark --

Attached is PG&E Core's response to Enron Canada's comments (sent in March)
on the Core Gas Supply Contract.  We have been able to incorporate many of
your suggestions.

In addition to Enron's suggestions, I have made some additional revisions,
some stylistic, some substantive, which I believe improves the draft.

I have highlighted the revisions in Word's "Track Changes" (Word 2000),
based on the original draft sent to Enron Canada earlier this year.

In addition, we recieved Enron Canada's modification suggestions for a
pre-pay arrangement.  We have incorporated many of EC's suggestions there as
well.

Please don't hesitate to give me a call, at 415-973-6659, to discuss and to
move this to conclusion.

Thank you,

Dave Anderson, PG&E Law Dept

Subject:  Enron Canada Corp. Comments on the PG&E Form of Master

Pursuant to your meeting at our office yesterday, Peter Keohane asked me to
provide you with a brief list of key issues/amendments relating to the
Pacific Gas and Electric Company form of Master Gas Purchase and Sales
Agreement (the "Master").  In this regard, we have tried to restrict our
comments to those of our concerns which are most important to us.  Please
be aware that these comments are subject to Enron Canada Corp. ("Enron
Canada") being satisfied with all other matters which were discussed during
the meeting (i.e. set-off issues, credit issues, issues relating to the
Confirmation and Amendment to Gas Supply Agreement, the security and
inter-creditor agreement and the side letter agreement currently being
negotiated with Travis McCullough of Enron North America Corp., etc.).

Our concerns, in the order of the Master, are as follows:

1.Verbal Agreements.

We need to ensure that the agreement contemplates the fact that agreements
(whether they be for Baseload Gas, Multi-month Gas or Swing Gas) will be
binding upon the parties agreeing to the terms of the transaction (i.e.
determination of the buyer/seller, the DCQ, the period of delivery, the
delivery point, etc.) regardless of whether the transaction has been
reduced to writing.

This should be a relatively easy fix to:
a.   s.2.1 of the Transaction Procedures,
b.   modifying a number of definitions in Article 1 so that they do not
refer to "as agreed upon in Exhibit A" or "as set forth in Exhibit A" but
refer to "as agreed      upon by the Parties";
c.   modifying the definitions of "Baseload Gas", "Multi-month Gas" and
"Swing Gas";
d.   modifying sections such s.4.1, s.5.1, s.6.1, etc. accordingly.


2. Confirmation by Seller.

In connection with the issue above, the confirmation procedure should be
amended such that "Enron Canada" (as opposed to "Buyer" in s.1.1 and 1.17
and as opposed to "PG&E Core" in s.2.3) "may" confirm the transactions.
This change is in line with issue number 1 above and allows for the
potential for Enron Online transactions.

Please note, the Exhibit A will need to be slightly modified to account for
this change.


3. Canadian Delivery Points

Enron Canada requires s.4.2 to be amended such that transactions with "at
the border" delivery points will be deemed to occur on the Canadian side of
the border.  The section should state:

     "The Delivery Point for any Gas sold and purchased at Easport, Idaho
     or Sumas Washington by Seller or Seller's Transporter to Buyer or
     Buyer's Transporter shall be on the Canadian side of the international
     border at the interconnection of Kingsgate, British Columbia and
     Huntington, British Columbia, respectively, where Buyer will take
     title of the Gas, unless otherwise agreed."

4.   Invoicing.

Enron Canada requires that the clause ", subject to receiving a confirming
statement from Buyer's Transporter for the quantity of gas actually
delivered," be deleted from the second sentence of s.7.1.  Further, the
second to last sentence of s.7.1 should be replaced with the following:

     "If actual quantities are not available by the billing date, billing
     and payment will be prepared based upon the scheduled contract
     quantities."

In this regard, s.7.4 should also be deleted.


5.  Enron Canada Credit Support.

In s.8.1, any guarantee provided by Enron Corp. must be construed and
enforced under the laws of Texas.

Secondly, Enron Canada requires the following clause to be inserted at the
end of the first sentence of s.8.2:

     ", provided that Enron Canada shall only be required to provide
     assurances of payment in the event that PG&E Core's net exposure to
     Enron Canada under all Transactions under this Agreement exceeds US
     $ (to be determined upon completion of credit analysis)".


6.  Force Majeure

Enron Canada requires the removal of s.11.1, s.11.2 and s.11.3 relating to
"Force Majeure".  These sections are to be replaced with the following:

     11.1   Suspension   for  Force  Majeure.   This  Article  11  entitled
     Non-Performance  is  the sole and exclusive excuse for non-performance
     permitted  under  this  Agreement,  and all other excuses at law or in
     equity  are waived.  Except with regard to payment obligations, in the
     event  either  Party  is  rendered unable, wholly or in part, by Force
     Majeure  to  carry  out  its  obligations  under this Agreement, it is
     agreed  that  upon  such Party's giving notice and full particulars of
     such  Force Majeure to the other Party as soon as reasonably possible,
     such  notice  to  be confirmed in writing, then the obligations of the
     Party giving such notice, to the extent that they are affected by such
     Force  Majeure,  shall  be  suspended,  from  its inception during the
     continuance  of  the Force Majeure for a period of sixty (60) Days, in
     the  aggregate,  during  any  twelve-Month  period,  but for no longer
     period.   After  the  sixtieth  Day, the Parties shall be obligated to
     perform.


     11.2      Force Majeure for Transactions with a Delivery Point at NOVA
     Inventory  Transfer  ("NIT").   If  the  Delivery  Point  is NIT, this
     Article 11.2 shall apply.  "Force Majeure" means only an interruption,
     curtailment  or prorationing by NOVA of NIT service, which affects all
     NOVA  shippers  who  had  nominated for deliveries or receipts to take
     place  by NIT on that Gas day.  On any Gas day or any portion of a Gas
     day  that there is a Force Majeure and either Party provides notice of
     the  Force  Majeure  to  the other, Seller shall deliver to Buyer, and
     Buyer  shall  receive from Seller, that percentage of the DCQ which is
     equal to the percentage amount of Gas which according to NOVA had been
     nominated  by  all  NOVA  shippers  for  NIT  and  which  NOVA  is not
     interrupting,  curtailing  or  prorationing  on  that  Gas day or that
     portion of a Gas day.


     11.3       Force  Majeure for Transactions with a Delivery Point other
     than  NIT.  If the Delivery Point is other than NIT, this Article 11.3
     shall  apply. "Force Majeure" means only interruptions or curtailments
     of  firm  service  at the Delivery Point(s) by Seller's Transporter or
     Buyer's  Transporter,  regardless  of  whether  Buyer's Transporter or
     Seller's  Transporter is declaring any event of force majeure.  On any
     Gas  day  that  Force  Majeure  applies,  both Parties' obligations to
     deliver  and  receive Gas shall be reduced by the same percentage that
     Buyer's  Transporter  or  Seller's  Transporter interrupts or curtails
     firm service at the Delivery Point(s) on such Gas day."

Please note, the reference to Article 11.2 in s.11.4 should be amended to a
reference to Article 11.1 once the changes indicated above are made.


7.  Liquidated Damages Calculation

The calculation of liquidated damages in s.11.4 uses the highest daily
price and lowest daily price "in the index below".  However, I could locate
no reference to an index below to make the calculation.  As are result, we
need to specify an index.

We should probably insert a provision to deal with circumstances in which
the index ceases to be reported or there is a material change in the
formula for or method of calculation is changed (as per the recent CPGR
AECO "C" Daily Index changes).


8.   Eligible Financial Contract Representation

As a supplement to the provisions of s.12.6, Enron Canada requires the
following provisions to be added to the Master:

     "12.7      Eligible Financial Contract.  This Agreement, all
     Transactions under this Agreement, and any guarantee thereof as
     applicable, each and together constitute an "eligible financial
     contract" under and in all proceedings related to the Bankruptcy and
     Insolvency Act (Canada), the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act
     (Canada) or the Winding-up and Restructuring Act (Canada), as the same
     may be amended, restated, replaced or re-enacted from time to time,
     and will be treated similarly under and in all proceedings related to
     any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law (regardless of the
     jurisdiction of application or competence of such law) or any ruling,
     order, directive or pronouncement made pursuant thereto."


9.   Assignment

Enron Canada requires the assignment provisions of s.14.1 be replaced with
the following:

     "14.1      Transfer  or  Assignment.   Neither Party shall transfer or
     assign  this Agreement without the prior written approval of the other
     Party,  which approval may be withheld or given entirely at the option
     of  such Party; provided, however, either Party may transfer or assign
     its interest hereunder to an affiliate, subsidiary or to any person or
     entity  succeeding  to  all or substantially all of the assets of such
     Party,  all without the prior written approval of the other Party, but
     no such assignment will relieve the assigning Party of its obligations
     hereunder."


Further, a new s.14.3 should be inserted stating:

     "14.3      Enurement.   This  Agreement  shall enure to and be binding
     upon the successors and permitted assigns of the Parties hereto."


10.  Canadian Law Issues

Enron Canada requires the first two sentences of s.17.4 to be replaced with
the following:

     "This Agreement shall be governed by and construed, enforced and
     performed in accordance with the laws in force in the Province of
     Alberta, without regard to principles of conflicts of law, and each
     Party hereby submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
     of the Province of Alberta."

     For the purposes of this Agreement and all Transactions hereunder,
     unless otherwise specified, "dollars" and the symbol "$" means dollars
     in the lawful currency of Canada.


11.  Representations

Enron Canada requires the following section to be inserted in Article 17 ?
Miscellaneous:

     s.17.8     As  a  material inducement to entering into this Agreement,
     including each Transaction, each Party, with respect to itself, hereby
     represents  and warrants to the other Party, continuing throughout the
     term  of  this  Agreement  and  on  the  date that each Transaction is
     entered into, as follows:

(a)  there are no suits, proceedings, judgments or orders by or before any
court or any governmental authority that materially adversely affect its
ability to          perform this Agreement or the rights of the other Party
under this Agreement;
(b)  it is duly organized and validly existing, and it has the legal right,
power, authority and qualifications, and has obtained all necessary
consents and        regulatory authorizations, for it to conduct its
business, to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its
obligations hereunder and under each     Transaction;
(c)  (i) each Transaction shall constitute a "commodity contract" or an
"OTC derivative" or such other similar term as defined pursuant to the
securities          legislation in force in Alberta and British Columbia
and pursuant to the securities legislation of any other jurisdictions
having application to the          Transaction, and
     (ii) it is a "Qualified Party" within the meaning of paragraph 9.1 of
Alberta Securities Commission Order Doc.#394043 and paragraph 1.1 of the
British        Columbia Securities Commission Blanket Order BOR 91-501, in
any such case, as amended, restated, replaced or re-enacted from time to
time, and      pursuant to any equivalent order or other enactment made
pursuant to the securities laws of Alberta, British Columbia and any other
jurisdictions having     application to the Transaction;
(d)  the making and performance of this Agreement are within its powers,
have been duly authorized by all necessary action and do not and will not
violate   any provision of law or any rule, regulation, order, writ,
judgment, decree or other determination presently in effect applicable to
it or any provision of its    governing documents; and
(e)  this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid, and binding act and
obligation of it, enforceable against it, in accordance with its terms,
subject to bankruptcy,   insolvency, reorganization and other laws
affecting creditors' rights generally, and with regard to any equitable
remedies, to the discretion of the court           before which proceedings
to obtain such remedies may be pending.


Please give me a call when you have the opportunity to discuss the above.
You can reach me at (713) 345-2520 for the next few weeks and you can reach
Peter Keohane directly at (403) 974-6923.


Yours truly,

Mark Powell

Attached is a copy of section 8.3 from the EEI agreement.? I'm told that to 
get the security interest created by this section, a party would have to 
perfect their interest by making a UCC filing in a variety of states.? 

Are people doing this?

Elizabeth, I was also wondering whether you should include a statement in the 
enclosure letter to the effect that the amounts referred to do not include 
amounts that may be owing under any of the agreements in respect of the 
period from and after the termination dates.

As agreed on the 5/31 conference call, Enron will prepare an annex discussion 
draft which incorporates comments provided to the group.  Anyone wishing to, 
may send me comments on the intial draft prepared by Bill McCoy last winter 
by JUNE 6.  Enron's discussion draft will then be prepared based on comments 
received and circulated for further discussion.

Elizabeth, I am responding to your voice mail that today's meeting is 
canceled.  I agree with your suggestion that you, Mark, Jeff, Bill and Shari 
can come to a conclusion and just let us know.

I believe the issues come down to:

1. risk of intentional default by our counterparty

2. risk of unintentional default by us

3. what the market is doing

As agreed at our last call, I reviewed the issues commercially here, and I 
believe the commercial preference is to maintain cherry picking for the 
reasons in 1 above.  Please let Greg and mw know what is decided.

Elizabeth,
For various reasons, and from time to time,  these new RTO-type things come 
to legal because we presumably have some special "corporate law" expertise 
about board compostition and by-laws.  I'm not sure we do, but in any event,  
Steve and I have reviewed this three inch pile of paper and our conclusions 
are set forth below.  If you would like us to do anything further, please let 
us know. ----cgy

Subject: Western Connection Interface (WIO)

Christian,

Earlier this week you asked me to review a stack of documents (proposals and 
draft bylaws) relating to the proposed Western Interconnection Organization.  

Conclusion:  Based upon a quick review of the draft proposal, bylaws, and 
other materials, I see no major objections to Enron voting for the formation 
of the WIO.   The reason to vote for this organization would be to facilitate 
the development of uniform reliability standards and efficient electric 
markets in the Western Interconnection.  However, you should carefully 
consider the fact that the board of directors will be weighted towards 
transmission owners (who will have 8 of the 27 votes).  Power marketers, 
generators, and load-serving entities will only have 4 votes.  14 directors 
establish a quorum and the board only requires a majority vote of directors 
present, so it is conceivable that, for example, 15 directors show up, 8 of 
which are transmission owners, and the transmission owners are able to pass 
any resoultion they wish.  Related to this issue is the inability of one 
membership group, such as the power marketer's group, to be able to veto a 
proposal.  It will take three membership classes acting in unison, plus two 
other votes, to defeat a proposed action by the board.  Unfortunately, 
because I am not personally familiar with the internal dynamics of the WSCC 
membership, I am unable to offer any indication of the how much of a risk 
this presents.  

       Background and Overview
In General:  The Western Interconnection Organization ("WIO") will be formed 
by consolidating the Western Regional Transmission Association, the 
Southwestern Regional Transmission Association, the Northwestern Regional 
Transmission Association, and the Western States Coordinating Council (WRTA, 
SWRTA, NRTA, and WSCC, respectively) into one organization.  The WIO, a 
non-profit corporation, will assume and perform the functions of these 
organizations, and, eventually, those organizations will be disbanded.

The principal responsibilities of the WIO will be as follows:

 *The WIO will be the primary authority for promulgating regional 
reliability, operating, and procedural standards.
 *The WIO will work to resolve conflicting regional reliability standards, 
and work to develop compatible and efficient practices throughout the Western 
Interconnection.
 *The WIO will have no authority over commercial practices (but may work to 
promote compatible, efficient markets).
 *Provide a process for resolving disputes arising out of WIO functions and 
between WIO members.

Membership:

Any entity meeting the criteria for membership in one of the following 
membership classes may be Member of the WIO.  There are five classes of

We are contemplating taking a performance bond as collateral to secure our 
position with Duke.   I would like you to review the language of the 
performance bond from a legal perspective upon receipt.  My concerns are the 
claim process will be slow and will be subject to legal interpretation.  I 
would like to discuss with you the risks associated with this type of 
security.

Thanks,
Bill

Bill,
My corporate insurance people are working diligently on a form of
performance bond that will be acceptable to the insurance companies.
The insurance companies involved, so far, are Fireman's Fund and Traveler's
(both rated S&P: "AAA" and AM Best: "A++").  I say "so far" because we
contemplate needing to have those two insurance companies "agent" a deal
that will involve more names.  As soon as I have those names, I will let
you know.

This matter is top priority in Charlotte.

Thanks,
Randy

Elizabeth and Bill - As you are aware the NSTAR transaction has been split 
into a one year deal with a potential long term (3 year) deal to follow as 
NSTAR felt the structure of the long term deal was complex and would require 
certain regulatory approvals (which had long lead time and were potentially 
difficult to obtain).  The one year deal will not require such approvals and 
will be structured like the current 6-month deal with which NSTAR is 
comfortable.

This structure eliminates certain issues including the physical/financial 
netting issue.  This is because the financial swap and put is eliminated and 
in its place is simply a fixed energy offset amount which reduces the volumes 
Enron is required to deliver.

The short term structure was set up whereby EPMI would be obligated to supply 
each of the NSTAR operating subs (Boston Edison, Cambridge, and Commonwealth) 
under one agreement.  There are embedded cross defaults in the agreement 
(e.g. a ratings drop by any NSTAR sub results in a MAC).  However, the 
agreement also included a provision that each of the NSTAR subs is severally 
but not jointly liable.  Thus, in a NSTAR default termination scenario EPMI 
would likely need to stream volumes and calculate 3 separate termination 
payments and subsequently pursue each sub separately notwithstanding the 
obligation to pay the termination payment is set up as a collective 
obligation of the NSTAR subs.

Unlike the 6-month deal, the attached draft provides that NSTAR is obligated 
to deliver a parent guarantee.  This was resisted by NSTAR on the short term 
deal as each of the NSTAR subs has an above investment grade (I believe A-) 
credit rating.  I will leave it to Bill to determine whether a parent 
guarantee is required or appropriate; however, provision of the guarantee 
would provide somewhat of a fix to the several liability structure.

I have been advised that NSTAR has a board meeting on Monday and would like 
to see the draft tomorrow.  In this regard it would be greatly appreciate if 
you could provide comments on the document by tomorrow morning.

Regards
CJG

Jean -- Could you please determine how (if at all) the Protocols will treat 
these specific circumstances:   When a QSE becomes unable to pay its 
obligations to the  ERCOT ISO, does the ERCOT ISO have any ability (or is 
there any guidance anywhere on whether it will have any ability) to impose 
liability on the remaining functioning QSEs to cover dollar liabilities of 
the defaulting QSE not satisfied by the defaulting QSE's credit support?  
Mike Curry said a while ago that he understood the the new CFO in ERCOT to be 
gearing up to address/resolve this issue.  For purposes of the QSE agreements 
Enron Power Marketing, Inc. is trying to complete  with customers, we are 
seeking as much information on this as possible, when and as available.  I 
understand that in California the ISO sought to impose such liabilities on 
the remaining healthy scheduling entities, which authority remains in 
dispute.  Please call Mike or me to discuss if the substance of this query if 
not clear.

Alan,

Attached is the resume of Charles Glizzard, a candidate that would like to be 
considered for a Global Markets legal position.  We should probably consider 
him for the role of Marine Transportation specialist, but it appears his 
skill set also shows an ability to do quite a bit more for us.

Kind regards,
Dan

David, 
spoke to trader, Steve Lowe of SOCO, and his main concern for the added 
language on our Enron confirmations, was to add specification of the INTO 
SOCO delivery point.   Referenced when the do business into Cinergy and 
Entergy there are constraints on transmission.   Just now started placing 
language (5/24 deal 621448.01) to our confirms, when Firm LD into SOCO, when 
SOCO purchases. 

Steve also mentioned his legal contacts, would like to discuss the EOL GTC's.

Please contact SOCO's legal for further information:  Lyle Larson  (205)

Greg stopped by to say that  the in the aftermath of the BPA/Kaiser non-deal 
the following further sub-deals could materialize.

Kaiser already has exercised a 24 hour notice right to sell balance of the 
month energy to BPA at index.  If BPA does not want the index power 
(unlikely) we could buy it from BPA.  No prepay strings.

Kaiser may give BPA 48 hour notice to do a January remarketing deal at an 
unknown price.  I'm not sure if we would purchase the power from BPA.  

Kaiser may give BPA a seven day notice to do a five month deal beginning in 
February which we might consider doing a prepay for.

Alcoa and another company are trying to close a deal by the end of the year 
whereby they are going to purchase a power plant-industrial complex at 
Longview, Washington. (Our origination guys are always working on something 
at Longview and this is probably it.)  As part of the closing, they are going 
to want to shut down part of the site and sell the power on the forward 
market.  There is a  potential that we might buy the power from them through 
BPA and perhaps prepay for it.

I told Greg the legal team, having worked through many of the issues on this 
kind of transaction last week, would stand by to help with any further 
developments. ----cgy

Andy

Perhaps we could clarify the following issues at our next meeting:

* Is there a difference between credit assurances and performance
assurances?
* Is a guarantee considered a credit assurance or a performance
assurance?
* In sections 8.1 (c) and 8.2 (c), I am not sure that a margin call is
clearly defined. I believe that initial performance/credit assurance such as
a guarantee to support a collateral threshold should be excluded from this
definition, otherwise you would be reducing the overlimit amount by the
amount of the guarantee posted at the time of contract execution.

Your comments would be appreciated.

Leslie --Stuart Zisman is working to finalize a Purchase and Sale Agreement 
("P&SA") as to the New Albany plant and is trying to be fully informed  as to 
outstanding contracts in relation to the plant known to the legal's power 
trading group.  He will meet with a large group on this project at 11 a.m. 
this morning.  On information from the midmarket group, I have confirmed to 
him there are no trading contracts currently in effect, committing sales 
from  the plant.  He is also inquiring about a 'Station Service Agreement' or 
any other basic agreement(s) in effect  allowing the plant's operation 
(beyond those referenced in the P&SA --see Schedules 4.1(m) and 7.1 --I'll 
bring you a copy of these Schedules).   As you may have been involved when 
such contracts would have been negotiated or placed in effect, would you give 
Stuart any information you have on this at your soonest opportunity?  Thanks.

I have discussed with Doug Gilbert-Smith the transmission contingent language 
e-mailed to you on 4-27-01 and am communicating the revised text below for 
insertion into those written confirmations of EPMI's purchases in ERCOT being 
supplied across a DC tie, when designated by the ERCOT traders to require 
this insert .  This text is only for those specific transactions which the 
ERCOT traders indicate.    

"Transmission Contingent: DC Tie.  If Seller is unable to secure the 
transmission required for this Transaction on a DC tie line across the ERCOT 
system border ("DC tie"),  or transmission on such DC tie is curtailed in a 
manner affecting Seller's delivery hereunder, then Seller at its election 
shall not be required to deliver the affected portion of the Energy and, in 
the event of that election by Seller, neither party shall be liable to the 
other hereunder for failure to deliver/receive such Energy.  No other 
transmission contingency is designated by the parties to pertain to this 
Transaction."

Elizabeth, 
Carol and I had a  conversation (with Justin Boose mostly listening in) about 
how best to coordinate her much welcomed support for West Desk EEI deals and 
out of that conversation I would like to propose that we send the following 
message to Tim and the Mid-Marketers.  The message is designed to enforce a 
kind of teamwork discipline and approach to EEI work that Steve, Justin and 
me have been developing here.  Obviously the message will not be sent until 
you and Carol are happy with it, and my suggestion is that you, Elizabeth, 
should send the message.  

Mid-Marketers:
The legal team supporting West Desk Trading has been strengthened by the 
addition of Carol St. Clair of ENA's Houston legal department.  Carol is 
going to concentrate on negotiating high priority EEI Agreements.  We are 
trying to build an improved process  for supporting EEI negotiations that 
involves a teamwork approach among a team of lawyers working together  along 
the following lines.  The idea is to create a steady processing of all EEI 
agreements at one level,  while at the same time,  having the flexibility to 
keep our most experienced trading attorneys working on our highest EEI 
priorities at any given time. The highest priority EEI agreements will be 
those where we are trying to get new, long term business. 

Justin Boose of Stoel Rives will have the responsibility to drive Stage 1 and 
Stage 2 of the EEI process. 

Stage 1 is all internal steps required to send a Cover Sheet including credit 
terms to the Counterparty.  These steps will involve getting the credit work 
sheet from Credit to our paralegal, Genia Fitzgerald and getting the Cover 
Sheet including the credit terms from Genia, proofreading it and identifying 
who to send it to.  

Stage 2 is harassing the Counterparty and, in cooperation with Mid-Marketers, 
getting the right people from the CP  to look at our Cover Sheet and reply 
with comments.  

Christian and Carol will be primarily responsible for Stage 3 of the EEI 
process, with Steve Hall also involved in this stage from time to time as 
other priorities may permit.  

Stage 3 is driving  the negotiations from the completion of Stage 2 to 
closing. 

Pat Boyston will be asked to join Stage 3 to help address all muni issues and 
to close out other issues as well from time to time.  Eventually Justin will 
grow into providing Stage 3 support. 

The critical credit liaison function will be made by the responsible attorney 
as the process moves to completion, with Legal taking the responsibility to 
drive the overall process to completion. 

We believe this kind of disciplined approach by this team should provide an 
enhanced level of support for EEI negotiations day in and day out if 
everybody recognizes   who is expected to do what during the three Stages. 
Christian has the responsibility to see that either he or Carol or Steve are 
concentrating on the highest priority EEI negotiations at any given time. 

Support for EEI negotiations is only part of the legal work that must be done 
for the West Desk and prioritizing the other work will be handled by 
Christian and Steve, working with me in Houston.  ----E. Sager.

Below please find the new definition of CAISO Energy. Please update all 
Masters under negotiation to include it. (For the avoidance of doubt - we are 
no longer making reference to a Schedule Adjustment). 


"CAISO Energy" means with respect to a Transaction, a Product under which the 
Seller shall sell and the Buyer shall purchase a quantity of energy equal to 
the hourly quantity without Ancillary Services (as defined in the Tariff) 
that is or will be scheduled as a schedule coordinator to schedule 
coordinator transaction pursuant to the applicable tariff and protocol 
provisions of the California Independent System Operator ("CAISO") (as 
amended from time to time, the "Tariff") for which the only excuse for 
failure to deliver or receive is an "Uncontrollable Force" (as defined in the 
Tariff).

Brenda- I will help you insert this in our template EEI Cover Sheet.  

Regarding the Confirm Desk, I have already alerted them use this definition 
from here on and upon request in any outstanding confirms. I am also working 
with Leslie to get it changed on EOL. 

Lastly, the following entities verbally Ok'd this definition with us TODAY: 

1. AEP
2. Constellation
3. Edison Mission
4. Koch
5. Reliant
6. Southern Company Energy Marketing
7. Southern California Edison
8. Tractebel
9. Williams

Any questions, please call me or Christian (who, by the way, did an 
outstanding job on getting this definition finalized.)

Elizabeth & Christian:  I had trouble forwarding an e-mail relating to the 
same but have copied it below.  It describes a movement by certain CA 
legislators to attempt to enact a "windfall profits tax" on electricity 
sellers that essentially would be designed to claw back profits on 
electricity sales.  You will recall this was one of the items addressed in 
our "pass through" clause in the proposed CDWR contract.  I know that we, as 
Firm, looked into the various constitutional and other legal issues relating 
to such a tax a few months ago, so let me know if, in your spare time, you 
would like me to pull anything on it.  John

All:

Attached for your records is a copy of the final version of the proposal 
letter that went out to NiMo last week.




Also attached below is a first set of clarification questions I receved from 
Navigant regarding our proposal.   Responses to these questions are due no 
later than Weds 5/16 and we will be working to respond to these in an 
appropriate fashion.   You will see that the questions are rather shallow and 
do not really provide any sense as to their reaction to our proposal.  I have 
left msgs with the folks at Navigant so that I may speak with them in an 
attempt to cut to the chase and discern what NiMO's true intentions are at 
this point.  I do not want to waste time answering these questions and 
marking up the proposed contracts if they ultimately will decide to take 
another course of action.   My hope is to get a mtg with NiMO ASAP and 
short-circuit the RFP process as soon as possible.

Please provide any comments on the attached questions by Monday so that we 
can decide our form of response by Wednesday.  Kay - you will note they 
requested markups of the Transacton Docs -- let's continue holding off until 
I can get a better read if it will be worth the effort.  Ed/Paul - note the 
questions on how much credit requirements we have assumed.  I don't know how 
much more clearly we can state the fact that we require a claim on ALL of 
NiMOs assets, but any appropriate elaboration on this would be appreciated.

Crisis: Democrats, GOP fail to agree on a $13-billion emergency bond, putting 
California at risk of running out of funds this fall. 
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO, JULIE TAMAKI, Times Staff Writers
SACRAMENTO--California will not be able to reimburse state coffers the 
billions spent buying electricity during the energy crisis until August at 
the earliest, which will leave the state perilously close to running out of 
money this fall. 
Democrats and Republicans failed to come to terms Monday on emergency 
legislation that would authorize up to $13.4 billion in bonds to repay the 
state budget, leading Democrats to push forward with a last-gasp strategy. 
The Legislature's ruling party outflanked the minority GOP by introducing an 
identical, nonemergency measure that required only majority approval, not 
two-thirds passage. It was approved by the Assembly Monday evening on a 49-29 
vote, and is expected to receive final Senate approval Thursday. 
Though it guarantees California taxpayers will eventually be repaid in full 
for electricity purchases made to supply private utilities, the Democrats' 
action carries a series of negative consequences for the state as it seeks to 
escape the energy crisis. 
The nonemergency bill will take a minimum of 90 days to become law after the 
special session ends, effectively leaving the general fund with a massive 
hole as lawmakers prepare the state budget over the next two months. 
"We can't sell the bonds as quickly, and will probably need a contingency 
budget," said Assemblyman Speaker Pro Tem Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek). 
Keeley said lawmakers will probably have to prepare a spending plan with 
different levels of funding--one from July, the time the next fiscal year 
begins, to whenever the bonds are eventually sold. Lawmakers may also have to 
consider a worst-case scenario: the possibility that the bonds will not sell. 
"If [investors] don't buy the bonds," Keeley said, "the situation we're in is 
very, very dire because the general fund would be repaid very, very slowly." 
State Treasurer Phil Angelides had hoped to borrow $4.13 billion to partially 
repay the budget until bonds could be issued, but lawmakers said the new 
legislation will make that impossible. Angelides' tentative deal to borrow 
the money from several Wall Street firms expires today. The deal required 
authorization on the bonds, because bond proceeds were to be used to repay 
the loan. 
"The Assembly Republicans' refusal to support emergency legislation puts the 
state's fiscal integrity at great and continuing risk, and does serious harm 
to essential services from education to public safety to health care," 
Angelides said in a statement. 
The delay also means that Gov. Gray Davis will fail to keep his promise to 
repay the budget and take the state out of the energy buying business by the 
end of June. That is crucial, because many of the contracts to purchase 
electricity that the Davis administration signed contain language that may 
make them void if financing is not secured by July 1. If the contracts 
evaporate, the state will be forced to buy even more power on the expensive 
spot market to avoid blackouts. 
Davis plans to replenish state coffers and stop using taxpayer money on power 
purchases by floating a record bond issue, which would be repaid by utility 
ratepayers out of their monthly bills. But the bonds cannot be issued until 
the bill in question takes effect. 
In a statement, Davis also accused Republicans of "obstructing the solution" 
to the state's electricity problems, saying "their decision to play partisan 
politics with the energy crisis seriously complicates the budget process and 
could ultimately threaten our economy." 
So far this year, California has spent more than $5 billion from the budget 
buying power for the private utilities that were too financially strapped to 
continue doing so. 
Most critically, the measure will leave a dangerously narrow window of time 
for the bond to be issued so the budget could be reimbursed before state 
coffers begin to run dry in early fall. The $12.5-billion bond is expected to 
be the largest in American history, and experts say it will require a 
significant sales effort. The Democrats' bill authorizes a slightly larger 
amount in case the bond issue needs to grow. 
Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg (D--Sherman Oaks) said he will continue 
working with Republicans in hopes of passing legislation to authorize the 
bonds sooner. 
"I'm still holding out an olive branch to Republicans," Hertzberg said. 
Lastly, the bill's final passage will kill, temporarily at least, hundreds of 
energy-related bills now winding their way through the Legislature. That is 
because, for the bill to become law as quickly as possible, Democrats would 
have to adjourn the current special legislative session on the energy crisis. 
Democrats are vowing to quickly approve a host of important bills this week 
before the session is closed down. And Davis is expected to immediately call 
another special session, said spokesman Steve Maviglio, so most of the 
remaining bills could be reintroduced. 
Nonetheless, the process would slow down passage of numerous 
measures--especially for Republicans, who may have a harder time getting 
their bills through both houses a second time. Republicans hold only 30 of 
the Assembly's 80 seats, and 14 of the Senate's 40 seats, making them a 
distinct minority. 
Without question, the Democrats' move represents a ratcheting up of partisan 
politics on the energy crisis. 
Republicans held up the initial legislation in hopes of forcing Davis and his 
Democratic colleagues to alter their financial plan to get the state out of 
the crisis--even if it meant scaling back the next state budget. 
Davis has proposed borrowing the $12.5 billion to repay the budget and cover 
future power purchases over the next two years, which would allow his next 
state budget to move forward unimpeded by the crisis. 
GOP lawmakers, who are convinced that the size of the bond will need to be 
increased to finance Davis' plan, countered last week with a proposal to 
essentially gobble up most of the state's projected surplus by writing off $5 
billion in electricity purchases and borrowing less in bonds for future power 
buys. 
But Democrats balked at the Republican proposal, saying California had far 
too many needs in education, law enforcement, transportation and health care 
to permanently spend $5 billion on electricity. Furthermore, they said, using 
taxpayer money instead of electric rates to cover power purchases would favor 
big business. 
"Today, we take a bitter pill to fix a problem we all know needs to be 
fixed," Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza (D-Merced) said.

Subject: Easier for EPMI/EES to purchase from industrials

Attached is FERC authorization for EPMI and EES to purchase power from 
industrials NATIONWIDE (effective March 6, 2001--Does not expire).  The 
industrial does not have to obtain its own power marketer license from FERC 
(subject to EPMI and EES making certain after the fact quarterlty filings for 
the industrials). 

Specifics:

Owners of generating facilities located at business locations and used 
primarily for back-up for self-generation (who will be "public utilities" 
subject to the Federal Power Act only while they sell at wholesale) can sell 
power at wholesale from such facilities to EPMI and EES without prior notice 
under section 205 of FPA (would usually require 60 day advance notice 
filing).  
  -- Waives certain parts of the filing requirements for the industrial; 
however, the industrial will still be subject to shortened filing 
requirements for dispositions of facilities and interlocking positions while 
they are selling at wholesale.
 -- EPMI and EES will make the FERC quarterly filings on behalf of the 
industrials for any of these purchases.  Our report must show the names of 
the industrial; aggregate amount of capacity and/or energy purchased from 
each seller; and the aggregate compensation paid to each seller.  
Accounting/commercial folks for EPMI and EES-- please make sure these 
purchases are flagged in the accounting system, since the report will be 
separate from our big quarterly reports.
 -- This does not authorize the retail industrial customer to violate any 
rules or tariffs of its host utility.  This does not authorize an industrial 
to resell power it purchases (only can sell what it generates); unless 
otherwise allowed (or not precluded) by its retail tariff.

West Desk:  This is similar to the authorization that FERC gave last week to 
purchases from industrials in WSCC.


____________________________________
On April 27, FERC issued an order granting EPMI and EES the authority to 
purchase power from IPPs at market-based rates.  As the attached order 
indicates, the effective date of the EPMI and EES rate schedules is March 6, 
2001.

David:

The new version looks good. I made 1 change. In Section 2.9, I added a phrase 
that the Calendar will be posted on ERCOT MIS, so New Power will know where 
to go to find any changes or updates to the schedule made by ERCOT. Paul 
Radous is sending you a hard copy of the current Calendar to include as an 
attachment and he expects to have the credit language to you before noon. I 
am OK with the Confidentaility section. Let's just see what Anoush says.

Tom, Smith, Lloyd, Theresa, Jeff - please give us any comments you have. I 
have to send this document to Anoush today. However, I will make it clear 
that there may be additional comments.




Thanks,

Michelle

Subject: QSE Agreement with New Power

Attached is my preliminary mark-up of the draft sent by Mike Curry (5-2-01) 
incorporating the various following e-mails of Michelle to the best of my 
ability.  I ask that commercial persons rig up (or have someone else rig up 
for them) the "Attachment X" referenced in Michelle's new Section 2.9 
language.  Paul, I have reinstalled the Credit Support Annex in case you were 
intending to use that apparatus to install credit terms (and I'm presuming 
you are going to pull in an Enron Corp. guaranty, though I don't know your 
intentions.)  Please respond to me ASAP with your best efforts to state the 
final terms to be shown to 
New Power, and I will refine the document into shape suitable to be sent 
out.  Note -- I am uncertain how the confidentiality obligation in Section 
7.2 should be stated in view of the possibly converging relations of ENA 
Wholesale with EES, and therefore desire that it be stated as narrowly as can 
be done while addressing New Power's main concerns and stating an EPMI 
obligation with clear and livable boundaries.

I have asked my asst, Twanda Sweet, to set up a conf. call on this for 
Friday. Jim is right--we need to be prepared for anything. Bill- I heard 
today that PG&E has sent us a letter or otherwise communicated to us that 
they are looking for a letter from us on valuation and are going to challenge 
our setoffs. Any news?

I don't want to make a pest of myself, but I'm curious as to how the process 
of closing out the terminated contracts is coming.  In particular has Enron 
completed the process of obtaining quotes so that the amount of the 
Termination Payments is set.  I'm concerned that PG&E would be more likely to 
hit the LC's once the amounts have been set.  We'll be ready to file 
something if they try that, but I'd like a heads up so that we know the 
possibility is out there.

Attached is the suggested template for physical power confirmations as 
discussed.

 As you know the "Confirmation Letter" is defined in the GTCs as being in the 
form attached as Exhibit A to the GTCs, any changes to the confirmation that 
the counterparties can expect to receive should also be reflected on the 
Website in Exhibit A.
 
Kind regards,

Hello, I wanted to make sure I understand where the new language is to be 
inserted in our EOL GTC confirmation letter.  Bob Bowen was telling me they 
are putting the new paragraph at the beginning of the confirm letter.  The 
only problem I see is that we have the trade date and the energy type (firm 
energy, etc.) in the first paragraph as well.  We also already have language 
in the last paragraph about returning the confirm to us within 2 days.  

Please look at the following template and let me know where you would prefer 
to see the language added.  We are planning on changing our templates 
tomorrow morning.



Thanks,

HEre's the resume of someone that Lloyd met at a conference this week.  It 
looks like she has a lot of experience -- some of it  power related, and 
might be worth an interview.  Didn't want to send it to Michelle, since I'm

Dear Lloyd---I really enjoyed meeting you yesterday at the Greater Houston
Partnership luncheon and truly appreciate your prompt inquiries on my behalf!
 Attached are a resume, "highlights sheet" and summary of recent assignments
which outline my experience as a corporate attorney.  As I had mentioned,
there are two emphases in my generalist career: (1) finance and transactions;
and (2) labor and employment law.  Along the way I have also addressed
anti-trust, corporate secretarial, environmental, some intellectual property
and some real estate matters.  In the marketing/trading arena, you will see
the reference to ISDA's and GISB's plus commodities swap and futures trading
agreements.  I look forward to sitting down with you and/or others in the
Enron organization to detail my background in person.  Please let me know if
there is any problem opening this document.

vacation spot even if it weren't for the nearby Taos ski area--one of=20
the best in the Rockies.=20

Switzerland
For a winter getaway with a European flavor, Switzerland is the place=20
to be. The Swiss Alps are home to many ski/snowboarding areas, and a=20

Calif Controller:State Behind On Long Term Contract Buys Updated: Monday, May 
21, 2001 02:59 PM ET 
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--California State Controller Kathleen Connell said 
Monday that she anticipates the state will need to issue $4 billion in 
revenue anticipation notes in February, because a $13.4 billion revenue bond 
issue in mid-August will not be enough to cover power purchases. 
The state is likely to spend more on spot market purchases than the 
administration has anticipated because the price of summer power will be 
higher than expected and because the state has secured fewer long-term 
contracts than expected, she said. 
"The administration projected we'd spend $925 million for long-term contracts 
in the first six months (of 2001). We've now spent only $36.4 million on 
long-term contracts of a total $5.1 billion spent on energy purchases - less 
than 1%," Connell said. 
It is unlikely that an additional $890 million in long-term contracts will 
flow through her office in the next five weeks, Connell said.

		 Subject: Non-Compete Proposal

As you may already know, Scott Healy and I are working on revising the 
existing agreement with AES relating to the Calvert City development site in 
Kentucky.  In connection with that transaction, ENA agreed to non-compete 
language which is virtually identical to the provision set forth below.   The 
current deal contemplates switching from the Calvert City site to our Haywood 
County site in Tennessee.  As a result, AES has requested the following 
non-compete provision.  Please provide any thoughts that you might have.  I 
am available to discuss this with either of you on a moment's notice.



"For the period commencing on the Effective Date and terminating on the 
earlier to occur of (i) the termination of this Project Development Agreement 
or the Purchase Agreement in the event that Purchaser does not purchase the 
Interests or (ii) September 1, 2002, Developer [ENA] (including its 
subsidiaries but only to the extent that Developer owns greater than 50% of 
the voting securities of such subsidiaries) agrees not to pursue for its own 
account the development or acquisition of any power generation project 
(except for any transaction pursuant to which such power generation project 
is purely incidental to the overall transaction and is not a material part of 
the assets being acquired or merged in such transaction) where the point of 
interconnection of such project to TVA's Shelby to Weakley 500 kV 
transmission line is located in Haywood County, Tennessee."

Subject: QSE Liability Query

Jean -- Could you please determine how (if at all) the Protocols will treat 
these specific circumstances:   When a QSE becomes unable to pay its 
obligations to the  ERCOT ISO, does the ERCOT ISO have any ability (or is 
there any guidance anywhere on whether it will have any ability) to impose 
liability on the remaining functioning QSEs to cover dollar liabilities of 
the defaulting QSE not satisfied by the defaulting QSE's credit support?  
Mike Curry said a while ago that he understood the the new CFO in ERCOT to be 
gearing up to address/resolve this issue.  For purposes of the QSE agreements 
Enron Power Marketing, Inc. is trying to complete  with customers, we are 
seeking as much information on this as possible, when and as available.  I 
understand that in California the ISO sought to impose such liabilities on 
the remaining healthy scheduling entities, which authority remains in 
dispute.  Please call Mike or me to discuss if the substance of this query if 
not clear.  

Thanks,

Due to the size of this possible transaction, I thought I would keep you in 
the loop on its status.

We submitted a bid with caveats as to its non-binding nature, and suggested 
an alternative structure.  In response, Navigant issued questions. John 
Llodra has compiled answers, which appear to be fine to me.

 We  (Legal) have been instructed to standby, awaiting commercial guidance as 
to whether we will be going forward.  I believe Klauberg has either cleared 
conflicts or initiated the process, so if we go forward, he should be our man.

I will let you know once a go/no go decision is reached.

Michelle -- As discussed, attached is a redlined and an execution copy of the 
New Power QSE Agreement, for your review and transmission onwards to New 
Power's Anoush Farhangi.  The document is being cc'd to the EPMI recipients 
you had designated.  For their benefit I direct their attention to the 
confidentiality obligations stated in Section 7.2:  in particular, EPMI will 
be under obligations to keep New Power's scheduling and settlements 
information confidential from EES and EES personnel.
 
Michelle, please note to New Power that: (1) New Power still needs to fill in 
their contact/payments information on Schedule A. (2) the Enron Guarantee 
format was not referenced in the document as Schedule E and Schedule E was 
therefore eliminated.  Per the Credit Support Annex, each guarantee must be 
in a format acceptable to the other party.  (3) The lengthy ERCOT Calendar 
will be kept current on the MIS website, so it was not included as 
'Attachment X' to the document.

Please call me with any questions or comments. --David

Folks,

It appears from the comment below that the NYISO does not intend to revise 
October's bill until February 2001.  This is a very signifigant issue for 
Enron.  Recall that the NYISO intentionally billed for October with the 
incorrect prices for the proxy busses even though the prices had been revised 
on the NYISO web site for some time prior to the bill.  The impact of this 
was that the NYISO withheld about $3,000,000.00 from Enron for October.  In 
addition they have not updated the November bill to reflect revised prices 
and the payment date is approaching.  When asked about this last month, the 
NYISO indicated that they knew they were billing incorrectly and would rebill 
later but that, according to the tarriff, market participants must settle 
there bills as posted.  I believe this to be a blatent abuse of the tarriff 
and that the NYISO is intentionally "leaning" on market participants for 
credit.  With year end approaching I believe that there is an emphasis on 
maximizing working capital which makes this even more critical (this point is 
highly confidential).

I believe that if they are not going to address this with the November bill 
than we should be taking the most aggressive response.  Should we put this in 
an intervention to the NYSEG filing regarding payments  to the NYISO or 
should we file separately with FERC requesting as a separate issue?  What 
would get the quickest response?  Can and should we consider legal action 
outright?

Howard,  can you approach the NYISO at highest levels ASAP with this issue 
and find out if there is any intention to address this?  So much for there 
efforts to gain credibility in the Marketplace.

Following Howards inquiry, I suggest that we meet by phone to determine our 
course of action.  We have very little time if we have any hope of confincing 
them of revising the bill with the November billing due around the 15th.

On a similar issue, NYISO is asking us to repay $4.6 million in TCC revenues 
from earlier this year.  I believe that they must revise prices in order for 
them to do this and that they are outside the window for revising prices.

Howard, can you arrange for Sara Shackleton and Shari Stack to get the TCC 
rules that were in effect prior to August as well as any rules around price 
revisions.

Thanks,
Tom.

Response:

Rebecca,
Due to a coding error in calculating ancillary reserves for the 25 hour day
(Oct. 29), hour 1 was not charged on the bill and was overwritten by hour 2 
data
and all remaining hours were shifted up one hour. This error is scheduled to 
be
fixed prior to the October rebill (tentatively scheduled for 2/01).

Dave Evanoski
518-356-6031

Question:
The hours in the Transactions LBMP section are not
agreeing with the hours in the Ancillary section.
It looks like SH01 for 126mw is missing from the
Ancillary settlement file for 10/29/00 and all other
hours are shifted up one hour.  I have attached
a file as support.

EEI has been participating in discussion with FASB concerning the application 
of SFAS 133 and 138 to utility power purchase agreements where power is 
obtained to serve load obligations, as opposed to power marketing.  EEI's 
position is that such contracts should be treated under the  normal purchase 
and normal sale contracts exception under SFAS 138, for which derivatives 
accounting treatment would not apply.   Occaisonally a utility may agree to 
bookout certain transactions.  EEI's position is that a bookout is not a net 
settlement of the underlying purchase and sale contract because every party 
must fulfill each and every contractual transaction.  EEI also has maintains 
that even if there is a bookout title passes under the terms of the 
underlying contract.  See attached letter to FASB.

FASB has asked for additional information on the bookout issue.  In 
particular, it wants more information on the passing of title between 
entities in a bookout chain; what are the legal requirements for title to 
pass to another entity in a bookout chain?

FASB also wants to know whether under bookouts are cash payments always 
settled gross with each company paying the total contract price for the 
purchase involved and receiving the total contract price for its sale or are 
there exceptions in normal practice?  I assume settlment in gross does not 
occur in the case of a buyer and seller in the chain whose underlying 
contract(s) provide for payment and/or transaction netting.

The close of the comment period is on Friday, so we are trying to get a 
letter back to FASB asap.   I would appreciate it if anyone in our group

SUMMARY

                      On November 22, 2000, the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission ("CTFC")approved four releases setting out final rules for
regulatory reform (the "Final Rules").  The Final Rules largely follow
the proposed rules issued by the Commission on June 8, 2000.*
The Final Rules are to be effective 60 days after their publication in
the Federal Register.

Please find attached a copy of a summary I prepared relating to Enron Canada 
Corp. and its dealings with various "PG&E" entities.  We have prepared copies 
of the relevant documents referenced in the summary.  However, due to poor 
road conditions, we have no courier service available.  We will make sure 
that the copies go out first thing Monday morning.  In the meantime, the 
summary contains most of the relevant language and may be helpful.

If you have any questions, please give me a call.  In addition to my work 
number ((403) 974-6708) I can be reached at home at ((403) 263-1323) or on my 
cell ((403) 540-1640.

Thanks,

I haven't seen the ruling, but this sounds like bad news for PG&E 
creditors.---sch

Judge tosses out PG&E lawsuit
BY BAY CITY NEWS SERVICE 
A federal judge has thrown out a lawsuit filed against the state Public 
Utilities Commission by PG&E, which had sought to remove rate caps in the 
wake of the company's bankruptcy. 
The ruling, issued by U.S. District Judge Thomas Lew in Los Angeles, was 
announced by San Francisco City Attorney Louise Renne today. The lawsuit had 
originally been filed in the city, but was consolidated with a similar one 
filed by a Southern California utility company. 
Removing the rate caps, imposed by the commission before the utility filed 
for bankruptcy in mid-April, might have allowed Pacific Gas and Electric Co. 
to retrieve up to $10 billion from state ratepayers. 
The utility, charging that its financial problems were due in part to the 
rate caps, filed the lawsuit the Monday after its Friday bankruptcy filing. 
Earlier today, CPUC President Loretta Lynch said the lawsuit was ``directly 
challenging the PUC's regulatory authority over PG&E.'' She compared the 
suit's argument to a company wanting to recuse itself from public safety or 
environmental regulations merely because it had filed for bankruptcy. 
``We believe clearly that our regulatory authority continues unabated,'' 
Lynch said.

As agreed on the 5/31 conference call, Enron will prepare an annex discussion 
draft which incorporates comments provided to the group.  Anyone wishing to, 
may send me comments on the intial draft prepared by Bill McCoy last winter 
by JUNE 6.  Enron's discussion draft will then be prepared based on comments 
received and circulated for further discussion.

The collateral group agreed to meet in Houston on July 31.  I would like to 
schedule the Drafting Committee meeting either on the 7/30 or 8/1.

As I believe I have discussed with each of you, Calpine has refused to
produce contract summaries for contracts outside of ERCOT. Its stated bases
are: 1. Enron limited its requests to ERCOT (not true); and 2. customs vary
depending upon the NERC region.

Elizabeth, I would like to prepare an affidavit for you which tracks
paragraph 12 of draft 4 of your affidavit which was faxed to you yesterday
and which adds a sentence which says something to the effect of: "This
custom and practice of providing a parent guarantee as described above did
not vary depending upon the particular National Electric Reliability Council
("NERC") region involved in the contract."

Please let me know whether this addition presents a problem. I will need to
file our motion to compel on Monday. Bill Ogden and I will be meeting with
Bonnie and Bill Bradford at 1:30 and can coordinate the execution of
Elizabeth's affidavit while we are in the building. I look forward to
hearing from you. Laura Gibson

John,

We need to make sure we are valuing the spread option using only No. 2 oil in 
Dec, Jan & Feb.  We will almost certainly be curtailed during blow out events 
in the winter and, therefore, it is not appropriate to use nat gas as the 
winter fuel.

Liz,

Please disregard the following message.  I did get your voicemail. The AMA 
that we are doing started with basically this form and has been pretty 
watered down as to the decision process we must follow.  Thanks for your help.

Liz,

For some reason I didn't get your voicemail.  I'll stop by this afternoon to 
double check that you are OK with the EPMI entity in the role of  Asset 
Manager/Marketing  Agent in the North Carolina Power Holdings transaction 
that we are structuring with AIG/Highstar.

Steve/Christian,

The attached file is a draft of an asset management agreement prepared by Stu 
Zisman.  The later version obviously contained more negotiated points, so I 
think this one is more helpful.

I'm working on a transaction now which involves serving load as well as 
selling power. I found this one helpful for issue identification and 
exculpatory language, however.

Michael, how can we get with PG&E to determine where the discrepancy lies?

Subject: PX credits & Schedule F in the PG&E bankruptcy

PG&E filed their Schedule F which displays its nonpriority unsecured claims.  
Many of the claims were listed as unknown in amount.  The PX credit amounts 
were listed as disputed.   Two PX credit amounts were specified in the 
Schedule F:

Enron Energy Marketing      $201,964,905.64
Enron Energy Services       $ 19,737,979.97
Total disclosed PX credit   $221,702,885.61

Note that in the claims that were listed as unknown in amount, none were 
described as PX Credit in nature. 

Two points to be made: 1) this information is now public (but on page 5,066 
of 17,096 on a CD), along with $53,985,167 in other Enron related claims, and 
2) our calculation of the PX credit was $392,416,534 at the beginning of May.

Regards,


Michael

Are we still on for lunch Wed.?
(1) The PSEG tolling agreement is super high priority right now, b/c of mkt 
volatility, so I'm marking up the Black Hills deal (lots of it is not 
relevant or helpful b/c there are dispatch blocks in the PSEG deal, which 
need to be addressed somehow) and will speak to you tomorrow, I hope , after 
meeting w/ the commercial guys again.
(2) New deal from Woody -- Wisvest is trying to unload the SOS load they have 
for Connecticut Light & Power -- wholesale contract, about 11% of the CT SOS 
load and Dana is interested in doing this one.  Wisvest wants an MOU by next 
week.  Just got the CA this evening and am working on it so we can get the 
info needed for evaluation.
(3) TEPAC is still pretty hot, b/c TVA's short power, so this would be a good 
time to have a deal w/ them.  I still need to meet w/ everybody and go over 
the remaining risks on that one
(4) Reliant - Dave Fairley wants to do a 50 MW deal w/ them in FL just like 
the one we did w/ Reedy Creek, w/ a few wrinkles I haven't fully learned 
about yet, except that they own 2 units and about 50 MW from another unit; 
he's not sure who the interconnects are with; Reliant has no native load, of 
course, so the FM issues will be different.  Another one that has to close 
very soon b/c the price is only $26.
(5) E Trans is at it again, but all they need at the moment is a couple more 
confidentiality agreements so they can start talking to some new players.  
Apparently, the National Grid is interested in operating an RTO and PJM is 
forming its own jv to provide services to RTOs and they all want us to have 
some kind of role -- getting interesting again.
Will keep you posted.
Regards,
Janice

Due to the flooding, electrical and communications problems in Houston over 
the weekend, several Enron Information Technology systems experienced 
outages.  At this time all critical systems have been restored and should be 
operational.  

In the process of restoring service, several user and common data directories 
had to be restored from the backup tapes from Thursday evening.  Therefore, 
some of you may be missing data files on your H drive or M drive that you 
created or modified on Friday.  

If you have any questions or have any IT related problems, please contact the

Mike,

     I noticed that there is not an indemnity provision in the WSPP
Agreement and that the Limitation of Damages section (Section 21 entitled
"Liability and Damages"), excludes "direct" damages.  I was wondering if
there was ever a discussion/vote on these issues.

Here's the final draft that was sent out today.  Still waiting for credit 
terms to be worked out, as far as I know at the moment.  Thanks very much for 
your help today.  Made me feel better about this going out there for possible 
execution.  And even if this deal doesn't go, we all learned a lot about 
doing unit entitlement purchases -- which will come in handy if the National 
Grid deal goes through.  That RFP response was sent in w/ indicative 
pricing/terms, rather than a binding bid. 
Got your voicemail about JEA.  I brought all that stuff w/ me and planned to 
read it on the plane.  I'm sorry that I misunderstood  -- didn't realize that 
you needed the followup today.    
Regards,
Janice

For the purposes of implementing physical power masters with counterparties 
to buy and sell power in Alberta, please find attached the final forms of the 
following documents, which collectively comprise our Canadianized version of 
the EEI master and incorporate comments received from Elizabeth, Peter, Chris 
and Mark Powell:

1.  Cover Sheet (which contains notification information, credit elections 
and our specific amendments to the form of base contract)
2.  Base contract (which constitutes the actual agreement)
3.  Schedules (which describe the Products and set forth the form of 
confirmation letter and the forms of guarantees)

The idea is that there are no changes made to the actual form of the base 
contract.  Instead, any changes to the terms of the base contract are made 
through amendments contained in the cover sheet.  The enclosed form of cover 
sheet contains our preferred amendments and credit elections.

I would ask that Rob Hemstock review the description of the "Firm (LD)" 
product.  You will see that I have created a general description of "Firm 
(LD)" and then gone on to describe what it means specifically for the Alberta 
market.  Rob, this description is contained in Schedule P of the attached 
"Schedules" document.  Rob, please let me know if you have any comments on 
the Alberta specific description.

As it is still unclear as to how the documentation will evolve for trading 
physical power in Ontario, please be advised that we are still developing the 
appropriate product descriptions for Ontario, so for the time being we should 
probably not be using this document in Ontario.  If there is a counterparty 
that wishes to use it in Ontario, please contact Chris Gaffney to discuss 
same.

Dianne, the form of confirmation letter included in the "Schedules" document 
is the form that we should be setting up in your system.

Bill, the credit provisions contained in these documents are now basically 
identical to those in the EEI form in use by EPMI in the US, so there 
shouldn't be any real issues with the documentation from a credit perspective.

Finally, I wanted to reiterate that the process for putting this physical 
power master in place with counterparties is identical to that undertaken 
with the gas master.  In other words, (i) the commercial person who wants the 
master put in place will contact the credit department and provide them with 
the counterparty details, (ii) the credit department will prepare a credit 
worksheet and send it to the Calgary legal group, (iii) the legal group will 
prepare the master based upon the credit worksheet and forward it to the 
commercial person for review, and (iv) the commercial person will review and 
initial the master and return it to legal who will send it out to the 
counterparty for execution.  Milnthorp will then execute the master once we 
get the executed copy back from the counterparty.

Thanks,
Greg

Thanks for everyone's help with the schedules. 

We believe we now have "execution ready" schedules.  If you would like to 
review your relevant section once more, please contact Stuart Zisman.  
Otherwise we will assume no request for review is an acknowledgement that the 
schedules are complete and include everything that you feel is relevant.  As 
you all know, we will be making "reps and warranties" as to the accuracy of 
the schedules, so it is important for everyone to feel comfortable that the 
schedules are all inclusive and exhaustive.

We will be providing the schedules by midday Friday to all the counterparties 
evaluating Caledonia and Brownsville.

Sorry to belabour this point; however, as you all know, the accuracy of the 
schedules are key in a transaction such as this.

Thanks again for your help and support throughout this process.

Regards,

Don

Just wanted to let you know that Lee met us downstairs and he was bringing 
her home.  She said that Marcus had a rush contract but other than that 
things can wait for her to get back.  I will check with Lee before I leave to 
see if they need anything.

This is a Llodra deal to be closed by 12/31, which he sent to me and to Shari 
(I think she's travelling today?).  It's supposed to be a physical exchange 
of the capacity and output among several NEPOOL nukes in which we and Select 
own various % entitlements (Seabrook, Pilgrim, Millstone 2 and 3).  I gather 
it's "at par", since there's no real pricing or $ changing hands unless a 
party defaults.  We seem to have a unilateral sale and unilateral purchase 
agrement w/ Select -- David's counterparty -- don't know whether that will 
cause risk problems.  Who should work on this?
Regards,
Janice

All:

Attached is a first draft of a term sheet covering a nuclear diversity swap 
between us and Select Energy.

Dana/Paul  -- please give me your thoughts on this, particularly as relates 
to the 15-day outage trigger that would put this agreement on hold until any 
unit that is experiencing an ouage > 15 Business Days returns to service.  
>From a risk mitigation standpoint, I think we are well off in that we are 
diversifying one unit with two replacement units (actually three since I am 
proposing Mill 2 for Jan-Mar and then Mill 3 for balance of the year).

Ed/Tracy -- what credit issues if any do you see, keeping in mind that the 
contemplated nuke exchanges would be on a unit contingent basis.

Janice/Shari -- any legal comments or issues?

Please call or email me to discuss.   I am out tomorrow PM and traveling all 
day Wednesday.   I'd like to push this forward rather quickly so we can work 
things out quick enough for this to be effective 1/1/01.

Thanks!!

John

Tim,
The short answer to your question is:  "sort of."  Let me explain. 

 The perfect tax clause would say:  if there is ever a tax, you (meaning the 
other guy) will always pay it and we will pay nothing.  Obviously a contract 
containing  this kind of clause will not be signed by anyone. 

 So, a further, compromise type step is to say:  ok, if there is ever a 
future tax, and it is materially painful, and we can't work out a way of 
dealing with it among ourselves,  then we will terminate the contract and 
split the termination payment for mark to market exposure 50-50. A clause 
containing this kind of language has been used in the past, but it is not 
part of the EEI or WSPP, for example, and one cannot say it is widely in 
effect in our agreements. 

What the standard power contracts end up doing is compromising. They dodge 
the issue and I am not sure that a perfect bilateral contract could do any 
better.    They basically say that if there is ever a tax, either existing or 
future,  the Seller will pay it if it falls on the transaction before the 
Delivery Point,  and the Buyer will pay it if it falls on the transaction at 
and after the Delivery Point.  The poor innocent Delivery Point is forced to 
be the arbitrary fulcrum upon which tax allocation must precariously teeter.  

What the standard language forces us to do is anxiously hope that in every 
transaction we ever do that we will be on the side of the Delivery Point that 
will save us from the tax.  The other guy is in exactly the same boat.  

When a price cap is actually  imposed, whether it be called a price cap by 
the FERC or called windfall profits tax by California, there are two 
fundamental legal questions:  1.  Should we keep doing business at all?  2. 
Do our contracts protect us from the tax in respect of our existing 
business?  The Legal group (Elizabeth, Steve and me, keeping contact with 
Mark Haedicke) are working through an  analysis of this situation and are 
trying to get the Tax Department's  input which is very important and which 
we must ultimately be guided by.  My suggestion to you at this point is that 
we should not just plunge ahead doing long term deals in California, but 
should pause and make sure we have thought this thing out very carefully.  We 
will try to help as much with this big issue as soon as we can.  ----cgy

do our contracts have any standard language referring to the allocation of 
future tax burdens.  specifically, if california implemented a gross receipts 
tax whereby any revenue that we receive in excess of $60.00/MWh would be 
subject to a 50 percent tax.

Thanks for your call last night.  I am going to AA meetings almost every
night these days.  I find them useful and helpful, for sake of a better way
to describe it.  Unless I have some other activity plannd, I usually go
meetings that start at 8:30, so I don't get home until clost to 10.

I really like the idea of going to the beach with you.  The triathlon
weekend in late September would be great.   I don't know about doing the
triathlon though.  I would love to, but I am nowhere near in shape to do
the running.  I tried to start running a few weeks ago, after about a year
off, and I quickly developed a heel bruise.  Running is out of the question
for a while.  I have been swimming regularly since Memorial Day when the
pool opened, and I have been biking.

I watched parts of a public TV show about energy problems the last two
nights  Enron came off as something like the evil, rich king.

Liz
 
Attached are suggested changes to the Long Description to more closely align 
the Into product in the EEI with the EOL Into product.
 
The Force Majeure relief for this particular product has been clarified to 
ensure that Force Majeure relief is not available in the event that non-firm 
transmission is scheduled. 
 
If we add the EEI definition of Force Majeure, the applicability or otherwise 
to certain products would need to be set out in the Long Description. At this 
stage, since we are focusing on the Into product, I would propose that the 
GTCs remain the same, until we make the more widesweeping change to bring EOL 
in line with EEI.
 
When you are back lets meet to discuss how  best to take this forward.
 
As to the broader change to reflect the EEI, we will need to consider how to 
deal with the issues on the Cover Sheet. The credit terms are probably not 
something that we can achieve "click" approvals of just yet, however the 
changes we would like to see to the EEI could obviously be included as part 
of the "click" and accept concept on EOL.  I will be giving this further 
thought and will make some recommendations when I have had the opportunity to 
go through the documents and the issues which will need to be addressed.

 As a preliminary point, is it your understanding that, provided we display 
the  attribution to the copyright owners on the Website, we will not need to 
obtain any further licenses? This is not clear on the face of the document 
which does not envisage that the document will be displayed as part of a 
website's terms and conditions, capable of acceptance. Is there a licence I 
could have a look at, for example? I am concerned that the digital rights may 
still be retained by the copyright owners, however having regard to the 
tremendous exposure and endorsement the document would receive by being used 
on EOL, I would hope that any licenses, if required, could be concluded 
quickly and at no cost to EOL.
 
Regards,
 
Marcus

Duke Energy Releases Average Prices Charged for Electricity in California
Average Price of $76 Per Megawatt-Hour for 2000, $136 for First Quarter 2001
CHARLOTTE, N.C., June 1 /PRNewswire/ -- Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK - news) today 
released average prices the company charged over the last 15 months for 
wholesale electricity in California. The average prices of $76 per megawatt- 
hour charged in 2000 and $136 per megawatt-hour in first quarter 2001 are 
well below average spot market prices for the same periods.

``Clearly by selling the vast majority of our electricity into the forward 
markets through long-term contracts we have demonstrated that low average 
prices can be achieved for California's consumers,'' said Jim Donnell, 
president and chief executive officer of Duke Energy North America.

``The way for California to stabilize prices is to enter into long-term 
contracts at fixed prices. We continue to work with the California Department 
of Water Resources to negotiate long-term contracts to help the state avoid 
purchasing power on the volatile spot market. Just last July, we offered to 
sell 2,000 megawatts to the state at a fixed price of $50 per megawatt-hour 
for five years. The state did not act upon our offer,'' Donnell said.

Duke also reported that the highest price charged during first quarter 2001 
was $3,880 per megawatt-hour. That price was for less than 1/10 of 1 percent 
of the volume sold to California by the company in first quarter 2001 and 
reflected the significant credit risks associated with selling power through 
the California Independent System Operator (ISO) to Pacific Gas & Electric 
(NYSE: PCG - news; PG&E) and Southern California Edison (Amex: SCEQ - news) 
at that time.

``The few sales made at the highest price reflected the fact that the parties 
receiving the power were insolvent and would likely declare bankruptcy. In 
determining the price to charge, we took into account the likelihood that we 
would only be able to collect a fraction of the sales price if PG&E filed for 
bankruptcy protection. Obviously our concerns were valid because on April 6 
PG&E did file for bankruptcy protection and we still have not been paid,'' 
Donnell said.

``On March 26 we said that if we are paid we will not seek to collect the 
portion of the price charged for the poor credit risk,'' Donnell added.

Donnell emphasized Duke Energy's commitment to California -- citing the 
company's announcement in 1998 of its intention to add additional generation 
in California. Duke has currently under construction a 1,060-megawatt plant 
and eventually could add as much as 1,500 additional megawatts. He also said 
Duke Energy's California power plants generated 50 percent more electricity 
in 2000, providing 15.8 million megawatt-hours versus 9.5 million in 1999.

Duke Energy supplies just over 5 percent of California's electricity from 
four power plants in the state with a capacity of 3,351 megawatts -- enough 
energy to serve about 3.4 million households.

For more information about Duke Energy's California operations, our 
modernization projects and our perspective on the state's electricity crisis,

Duke Energy, a diversified multinational energy company, creates value for 
customers and shareholders through an integrated network of energy assets and

HOMEPAGE: http://www.thelaw.net
REMOVE: http://www.thelaw.net/remove.htm

     Legal research often comes in waves, but as night follows day, that 
onerous monthly commitment to West or Lexis is always there. But with so many 
new options, it doesn't have to be this way.


--VIABLE ALTERNATIVES ABOUND

     True though it may be that your West or Lexis rep is out to put you on 
that fat annual contract, both companies offer a variety of online 
alternatives. A person can:

----log in and buy most any document for a few bucks
----Shepardize or Keycite for around $4
----subscribe to KeyCite for $35 a month
----rent a state for a week for $40
----conduct transaction based case law searches only when you have to
----Supreme Court case law from 1790 is now available on the web for FREE
----California state case law from 1934 is now available on the web for FREE
----the landscape continues to change rapidly


--CHOOSE THE RIGHT TOOL FOR THE JOB

     There can be no question that the commercial value of proprietary legal 
research resources will continue to drop as more and more primary and 
secondary materials migrate online. At TheLaw.net Corporation we advocate 
choosing the right tool for the job. And one of the best single tools you can 
own these days is our flagship software solution, TheLaw.net Professional 
Legal Browser.


--LESS THAN $1 A DAY FOR EVERYTHING, UNLIMITED ACCESS

     For just $395 annually for an individual, TheLaw.net gives you a 
remarkable foundation of primary and secondary resources, on an unlimited use 
basis, with a national scope, including, but certainly not limited to, the 
following:

----A great proprietary, searchable case law database that includes the U.S. 
Supreme Court, the 13 Federal circuits, the 50 state supreme courts and 
intermediate appellate courts. See, http://www.thelaw.net/caselawgrid.htm

----Literally millions of searchable cases, updated four times daily, offered 
on an unlimited use basis

----Streamlined access to:
------Federal and state statutes, rules and regulations
------the CFR and Federal Register
------executive agency databases and bill trackers
------nearly 1,000 news resources
------another 1,000 reference desk tools
------nearly 10,000 practice area helpers and much, much more
------over 50,000 documents and databases
------all just a fast click or two away on your desktop 24 - 7 - 365


--THELAW.NET MAY OR MAY NOT BE ALL YOU NEED

     Depending on size, practice area and/or jurisdiction, TheLaw.net may 
well have everything you need. If not, West and Lexis are available online, a 
la carte for those times when you really need them. As an example, TheLaw.net 
is not yet a great resource for Federal District Court opinions.

     It all depends on what you want your life to look like. If the 
convenience and elegance of the gold standard is worth the rates charged by 
the legal research cartel, you should keep doing what you've been doing and 
renew that annual contract with Company A or Company B. If not, and you feel 
like you continue to get hammered at a time when given the efficiencies of 
computerized distribution of data, prices ought to be dropping, we can help.

Team:

Here are the final versions. A few comments:

I think we should specify 10 cents as our remarketing fee, as opposed to 
leaving it open. I think we need to provide some point to negotiate around. I 
know it may be less than our bid/mid/offer spreads, but I am also concerned 
that what we'd really need to charge would make us too expensive in an RFP 
process anyway.
Optimization of Existing Assets  - Index less 10 cents or just a 10 cent 
remarketing fee. A 10 cent flat fee makes them vulnerable because we could 
remarket at a price worse (for them) than index.
I changed the term to start June 1. If they want us to remarket their 
existing assets before the QSE is set up on June 1, we can discuss with them 
separately.


  


Please send me your comments no later than 10 am Monday. I plan to e-mail to 
TNMP at noon.

Thanks,

Michelle

I am interested in finding out who is attending the California session that 
you are speaking at.  If enough customers are going it might make sense to 
send someone from middle market to help cover those guys.  Do you think that 
is wise?  I am aware that City of Riverside is sending someone.

	BankruptcyDaschle Says Bankruptcy Reform Stuck 
As Party Roles in Conference Still in Limbo

Bankruptcy legislation (S. 420/H.R. 333) that separately passed the Senate 
and House earlier this spring remains in limbo, as the Senate still cannot 
agree on how to proceed to conference with the House, Senate Minority Leader 
Thomas Daschle (D-S.D.) told reporters April 23. 
The question of party representation in conference continues to stall efforts 
to bring the issue of bankruptcy reform to a close. Democrats, who occupy 
half of the Senate's seats, are insisting upon equal representation in 
conference, while Republicans oppose it. 
Efforts to forego a conference with the House are unlikely to succeed given 
House leadership concerns about a number of controversial amendments the 
Senate made to S. 420 before passing it. In particular, many Republicans 
object to provisions opposed by President Bush that are intended to make it 
harder for debtors to shield assets by purchasing expensive homes in states 
that bar creditors from seizing the homes in bankruptcy auctions. 
"There has been no resolution yet," Daschle said. "I would say that I think 
both [Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.)] and I and our staffs are 
working to try to resolve his concern, which is what do you do in a tie ... 
You know, I think what happens in a tie is [that] you just keep talking until 
you break the tie." 
Daschle said he is looking for an "opportunity to break through," but has yet 
to find one. Regardless, Daschle said he does not think "tie votes are all 
that big a problem, either in conference or in committee." 
With Daschle voting in the affirmative, the Senate March 14 approved 80-19 a 
cloture motion Lott filed late March 12. Sen. Paul Wellstone (D-Minn.), the 
bill's most outspoken opponent, argued passionately against cloture and Sen. 
Harry Reid (D-Nev.) foiled an attempt by Lott to secure unanimous consent to 
prepare the bill for a conference with House members after the bill passed 
the Senate March 15. 
In general, the bills aim to force more bankruptcy filers to file under 
Chapter 13, which requires some repayment of debts, instead of Chapter 7. The 
bills are a copy of last year's conference report worked out between the 
House and the Senate, which former President Clinton pocket-vetoed in 
December.

Elizabeth & Janice:

I put on the fax to you two articles from today's WSJ that I thought you 
would have some interest in if you have not seen the Journal today.

1.  I am assuming that the ENA Credit folks are all over the issues 
pertaining to the effect of the high wholesale prices on IOU counterparties 
that do not have the ability to pass on such higher costs to their retail 
customers, in most cases because the IOU distribution companies are subject 
to a rate freeze under their deregulation laws or, in some other cases, 
because they no longer have "power purchase" or fuel adjustment type adders 
in their tariffs to be able to pass through such added expenses, but I 
thought I would just pass this article along since it is clear that the 
rating agencies are going to start scrutinizing these situations very 
closely.  As you well know, this issue has been highly publicized in the CA 
situation, where I believe PG&E and SoCalEd have incurred "losses" on the 
difference between their wholesale power purchases and the amount they are 
allowed to sell that power for at retail.  That amount has been reported to 
be over $7B which if the situation continues as it is going will likely wipe 
out a substantial (if not all) of the companies' shareholder equity.  Of 
interest is that the CA utilities have not yet taken these "losses" for 
financial statement purposes since they are holding out the hope of a rate 
recovery, a fact that the capital markets are starting to focus on.  From our 
standpoint, as you know, this is not just a CA problem.  Similar, though not 
as dramatic wholesale power spike, problems exist in other parts of the 
country--for example, in New England because of the increase in gas prices 
(and in the Northwest).  Thus, as we are contracting with various IOU 
counterparties (even the straightforward T&D companies (i.e., those without 
generation) that traditionally were looked at as very safe from a credit 
perspective, we will need to be mindful (and perhaps get up to speed) on the 
state regulatory rules applicable to the recovery of wholesale power purchase 
prices by the those utilities, particularly since those counterparties could 
be adversely affected by deals other than ours.

2.  The second article discusses Constellation's contract to purchase of the 
Nine Mile 1 and 2 nuclear interests from some of the co-owners of those 
plants.  You will note that there also is a 10-year buy-back PPA between 
Constellation and the selling IOUs.  We will obtain a copy of the PPAs to see 
if there is anything of particular interest vis-a-vis the questions I spoke 
about the other day with Janice--but my guess is that, since the buyers are 
IOUs, the PPAs will look more like the Pilgrim, Clinton and Oyster Creek PPAs 
that Janice and I spoke about that are fairly "stripped down" and don't 
reflect many of the provisions we typically would want.  I'll follow up with 
Janice on this.

John

Doug -- As discussed, attached is a redlined copy and an execution copy of 
the off peak 2002-2004 confirmation letter reflecting the changes taking into 
account that modifications to product definitions are more likely to arise 
from  the efforts of industry participants than via ERCOT action as to the 
protocols or otherwise. The definition of UB itself makes clear this product 
is firm, and the term "Undelivered" currently carries the meaning that  Buyer 
must be capable of moving the firm energy from the Delivery Point to more 
than one potential destination.  Please contact me with any questions. --David

It looks like de-registering as an ESP is, in fact, a good option.  It would 
certainly make life easier from a compliance standpoint.  Christian, would 
you run this by your business guys just to make sure that they don't plan to 
serve small commercials under 20 KW?   Thanks!

Janet,

EPMI originally registered with the CPUC as required because EPMI was the
entity who actually contracted with all of Enron's retail customers for
service, including residential and small commercial, as well as larger
customers.  Later, EPMI transferred virtually all its customers to EES, who
was also registered as an ESP.  Our information is that EPMI still serves at
least one industrial customer -- the Can Fiber plant -- as well as possibly
others.  We agree that EPMI could reduce its regulatory compliance burdens
by deregistering as an ESP, so long as it did not intend to serve any
customers under 20 kW.  As I explained, EES has occasionally found it
necessary to serve customers of less than 20 kW in order to obtain larger
accounts.  This is not a problem with certain chain stores, ie. a fast food
restaurant, where several stores are over the 20 kW limit and a few are not.
In that situation, the CPUC has clarified that compliance with the small
customer consumer protection rules is not required,  However, EES has also
been asked to serve residential customers, such as employees and executives,
in order to get a large customer account.  We would not advise serving any
such customers without a valid ESP registration.  If, as you suggest, EPMI
is,and expects to remain, in a position where it will not consent to serve
such small customers, then de-registration is an option.  Please let us know
if there is anything further we can do to assist you in this matter.

Mike Day

Mike:  Per my voicemail, I am forwarding to you an email from an attorney
at LeBoeuf.  As mentioned, LeBoeuf has been helping us develop an overall
compliance plan for meeting the varied retail regulatory requirements in
the states where EPMI sells to industrials.  They came up with the
suggestion, as discussed further below, of having EPMI deregister as an ESP
in California, and instead become a non-registered ESP.  I understand that
EPMI could still sell to large industrials under this classification.
First, can you remember the historical reason of why EPMI registered as an
ESP to begin with, but with the qualification that it only intended to
serve large industrials?  There may have been an important strategic
decision to do so.  Second, is there any reason why EPMI should not
deregister as an ESP and become a non-registered ESP?
I look forward to hearing from you.  Please feel free to call me at
713-345-7400.

Janet,

As you know, EPMI is currently classified with the California Public
Utilities Commission ("CPUC") as a "Registered ESP" (ESP # 1086).  EPMI may
want to consider de-registering with the CPUC and, instead, benefit from
classification as a "Non-Registered ESP".  I have confirmed that an ESP
must only register with the CPUC prior to serving residential and small
commercial customers.  The CPUC defines a "small commercial customer" as a
customer that has a maximum peak demand of less than 20 kW per meter for at
least 9 billing periods during the most recent 12 month period (See
C.P.U.C. o 331(h) and PG&E Tariff, Rule 22).  As EPMI has indicated in its
license application that it only intends to serve large commercial
customers and, per our discussions, does not have immediate plans to serve
small commercial customers, EPMI may elect to de-register and become a
Non-Registered ESP.
     The primary advantage of de-registering is that EPMI, as a
Non-Registered ESP, would no longer have continued reporting and compliance
requirements with the CPUC, including the annual submission of a standard
service plan filing, application update and license renewal.  Additionally,
as a Non-Registered ESP, EPMI would no longer have the ongoing obligation
to notify the CPUC within 5 days of changes in address or phone numbers and
to notify the CPUC of all other "material changes", including changes to
officers and directors, within 60 days.  I have confirmed with a contact at
the energy division of the CPUC, on an anonymous basis, that a Registered
ESP can de-register with the CPUC by sending a letter to the address below
requesting cancellation of ESP registration status.
               California Public Utilities Commission
               Energy Division - Electric Service Provider Registration
               Fourth Floor
               505 Van Ness Avenue
               San Francisco, CA 94102
Our source at the CPUC also confirmed that the CPUC exercises no regulatory
jurisdiction over a Non-Registered ESP.  Non-Registered ESPs, however, can
file a complaint at the CPUC against a jurisdictional utility over issues
dealing with the utility's compliance with its tariffs with respect to
ESPs.

     Please note that while Non-Registered ESPs do not have ongoing
reporting and compliance requirements with the CPUC, both Registered ESPs
and Non-Registered ESPs must submit various environmental compliance
filings with the California Energy Commission and, if participating in the
Green-e Program, make additional filings with the Center for Resource
Solutions.  For additional information on these reporting and compliance
requirements for Registered ESPs and Non-Registered ESPs in California,
please refer to the LLGM website at
http://web-2.interliant.com/llgm/ENRON/llgm.nsf.

     If you have any questions about reporting requirements in California,
the de-registering process or would like our assistance with this process,
please contact me at 415.951.1137 or Sandy Cofer at 713.287.2002.

Hello, attached below is an example of a monthly option and a daily option.  
The only difference being one is exercised once a month and the other is 
exercised daily.  The times that options are exercised varies by delivery 
point and whether the option is daily or monthly.  We can send you a list of 
these rules if needed.

Here is a report on current Muni deals in the west.  

1. Grant County PUD:  (Washington)   we have orally agreed (no signed 
confirms) to two identical deals,  each calls for us to deliver power to 
Grant during year one and for Grant to deliver us power and money in year 4 
or 5.  Our effort to get an opinion from them that these deals have been 
properly authorized has foundered badly.  We have the classic situation of a 
PUD whose procedural practice does not fit with the statute.  They are 
irritated to have this pointed out to them and so far, unwilling to go back 
and fix their practices for fear of embarassment before the Board.  
Delicate,  complex, difficult mess.  Pat Boylston of Stoel Rives helping.   

2.  Clatskanie: (Oregon)  We have done a deal ( signed confirms and EEI soon 
to be signed) whereby we deliver Clatskanie power in year 1, for which we 
receive a monthly payment which is roughly akin to a contract price,  and 
they deliver us power in year 5.   We have every expectation of receiving a 
satisfactory legal opinion from them when they return the signed EEI 
agreement.

3. EWEB: (Oregon)   We have done a deal (being documented as a swap by the 
swap group) which I believe is a five year deal.  The deal was originally 
conceived as being a physical transaction.  We  received satisfactory 
documentation about authorization from EWEB for the physical transaction, but 
when it switched over to being a swap at the last minute,  and Sara 
subsequently reviewed the authorization issue,  her conclusion was that we 
were not satisfied with what EWEB had shown us.  I have gotten Pat Boylston  
to get EWEB to promise to give us a Board resolution in a couple of weeks 
addressing the financial risk concern.  

4. Valley Coop. (Nevada)  We have recently done a 4 year vanilla commodity 
sale to Valley and are in the process of checking out their authorization to 
do longer term deals.   We have a services agreement with them whereby we are 
their SC for load balancing purposes involving the California market.  A 
question has arisen as to whether or not certain sales we make to them as 
part of this arrangement  may generate revenue for them in excess of 15%,  if 
so, perhaps putting their tax exempt status as a muni in jeopardy.  It is a 
tax, accounting issue.  Pat Boylston of Stoel Rives is helping us sort it out.

5. LMUD (California)  City of Lassen.  We are trying to do a long term sale 
of power to them.  Attempts to check out authorization have run into a 
complex, California municipality statute and a small town lawyer and we are 
presently stalled out.  Sandy Skaggs of McCutcheon Doyle is helping as best 
he can.  The commercial deal died its first death yesterday but rigor mortis 
is not complete and we may have to revive authorization efforts.

6.  Tracy Ngo has given us a long list of munis, prioritized as to our credit 
exposure to them.  Presumably I am busy checking all of the most serious ones 
out and making sure we have proper authorizations.  In fact, I have done 
nothing with this  because I am busy with other immediate priorities.  

Pat Boylston of Stoel Rives and Sandy Skaggs of McCutcheon Doyle are 
providing very valuable service in this area.  They are both very good at 
dealing with these muni type folks and, with the exception of Grant, (and not 
because of Pat, who has been great)  have gotten fairly good results so 
far.----cgy

Dear Elizabeth,

Attached is the Mid-C Call Option Confirmation you reviewed this morning.
Many of the changes you suggested were quite valid - thanks for that!

The only modifications that we would prefer not to accept were the ones to
"Delivery Point" and in the last line of the "Description of Transaction".
Regarding the former- we would rather not place specific parameters as to
how to chose the replacement DP (this goes for all of our counterparties,
not just Enron).  Which DP will be similar to the original DP in terms of
homogeneity and liquidity to us or to Enron is truly subjective, and
furthermore we would not want to agree to stricter parameters with Enron
than with other counterparties . The reality is that the parties are likely
to disagree on the replacement DP when and if this event occurs, and thus
the method for resolving this and any other dispute is arbitration under
Section 10.2  of the EEI Master.

Please let me know if the attached revised draft Confirmation will be
acceptable to you.

Thanks,

Shari

Here is another Tolling that Stuart did and reviewed when we were thinking of 
taking back a PPA (in this case we were supplying gas and taking electricity, 
so your deal does not have the same perspective) when we sold the plants - 
this deal never happened and was very convoluted because of lease accounting 
issues. Anyway it may be helpful on your toll.

All:

I just wanted to thank everyone for their great effort on the Pepperell 
deal.  I know it was a bit frustrating at times, but in the end I think we 
will derive a lot of value out of this deal and benefit from the learning 
experience of managing generation in NEPOOL.   Kevin Presto and Dana Davis 
made it clear that this position will be a nice strategic addition to our 
NEPOOL book.

On to the next one!

Regards
John

Doug and Ed,

Based upon the additional information you have provided to me, I have revised 
our draft of EPMI's damages calculation.  Please review it ASAP, as I would 
like to be able to send it to our outside counsel this afternoon.  Also, 
there are a couple of blanks/question marks:  Doug, you indicated that you 
thought you could calculate our sales price per MWH for sales to LCRA during 
the months of June-September 2000 by getting an index price from your 
analyst.  Also, are we quoting natural gas prices in mcf or mmbtu?  Please 
call with your comments.  Thanks.

But on the other hand, the world's your playground. So go ahead--pick 
your playground! Whether you're looking for a romp in Mexico or the 
Caribbean, or fun in the sun in Orlando or Las Vegas, Excite Travel 
can help make your vacation plans a reality.

***FEATURED THIS MONTH***
Orlando
Save $150 on Your Orlando Vacation!
Orlando is one of the greatest all-ages playgrounds in the United 
States. There's Walt Disney World ("the happiest place on earth"), 
cutting-edge rides at Universal Orlando, underwater fun at SeaWorld, 
and more. If you haven't visited in a few years, come see what's new 
in Orlando! 

Jamaica
Win a Seven-Night Caribbean Cruise!
Reggae and rays. If that doesn't sound like fun, we don't know what 
does. Jamaica has that great Caribbean combination of laid-back 
mellowness combined with lively nightlife and tons of daytime 
activities. So lie back and relax on the beach. Or set off on an 
adventure exploring Dunn's River Falls, hiking, or scuba diving. 
The choice is yours. Book now!

Cabo San Lucas
Discover the Many Moods of Mexico!
Cabo San Lucas is world-famous for providing fun in the sun--and 
after the sun goes down, too. The waters of the Sea of Cortez are 
fabulous for water sports including diving, fishing, and sailing. 
There's also world-class golf. And after dark, the city throws a 
great party just about any night of the year. Don't let the town's 
small size fool you--there's enough fun here to fill a major city. 

Las Vegas
Vacation in Style at Caesars Palace!
The only hard part of a Vegas vacation is deciding what not to do. 
That, and picking a hotel! One property you can't go wrong with is 
Caesars Palace. Caesars celebrates the decadence of the Roman Empire 
with gorgeous gardens, sumptuous restaurants, and a 23,000 square-foot 
spa. As they say, when in Rome...

David:

The new version looks good. I made 1 change. In Section 2.9, I added a phrase 
that the Calendar will be posted on ERCOT MIS, so New Power will know where 
to go to find any changes or updates to the schedule made by ERCOT. Paul 
Radous is sending you a hard copy of the current Calendar to include as an 
attachment and he expects to have the credit language to you before noon. I 
am OK with the Confidentaility section. Let's just see what Anoush says.

Tom, Smith, Lloyd, Theresa, Jeff - please give us any comments you have. I 
have to send this document to Anoush today. However, I will make it clear 
that there may be additional comments.

Subject: QSE Agreement with New Power

Attached is my preliminary mark-up of the draft sent by Mike Curry (5-2-01) 
incorporating the various following e-mails of Michelle to the best of my 
ability.  I ask that commercial persons rig up (or have someone else rig up 
for them) the "Attachment X" referenced in Michelle's new Section 2.9 
language.  Paul, I have reinstalled the Credit Support Annex in case you were 
intending to use that apparatus to install credit terms (and I'm presuming 
you are going to pull in an Enron Corp. guaranty, though I don't know your 
intentions.)  Please respond to me ASAP with your best efforts to state the 
final terms to be shown to 
New Power, and I will refine the document into shape suitable to be sent 
out.  Note -- I am uncertain how the confidentiality obligation in Section 
7.2 should be stated in view of the possibly converging relations of ENA 
Wholesale with EES, and therefore desire that it be stated as narrowly as can 
be done while addressing New Power's main concerns and stating an EPMI 
obligation with clear and livable boundaries.

FYI. This is a pretty paper on legal/risk aspects of power trading. I think 
it would help in training future lawyers/staff.

Dear Jane,

Further to our discussions on Friday, I attach a copy of the Energy Trading
Paper prepared by our Washington office.

The paper is relevant to what we are focussing on now with EPSA, and 
discusses:
what is happening in the US and English markets, the legal issues in merchant
power sale contracts, the EEI agreement (on which Enron's EPSA is largely 
based,
or was it vice versa), and compliance issues.

A few of points I found particularly interesting:

* The way in which many of the risks are born seems to be reasonably
settled in the US market/EEI form.  The issue is to what extent Japan
will/should follow the same allocation, on which subject the Enron EPSA seems 
to
be setting the pace, at least for the moment.

* We cannot discount the danger that some of the counterparties in Japan
will in fact become insolvent or choose not to perform.  We have attempted to
cover this in EPSA.

* The treatment of force majeure, particularly non-performance by the
back-to-back supplier/customer, will need more attention as specific fact
situations arise.

* The need for a commercial/legal response system to be in place to
immediately address any failures.

I hope you find the paper useful and, as discussed, I rely on you to 
distribute
it to other persons within Enron who are likely to be interested.

Best regards

Paul Davis

Attached please find a Tax Review of California Senate Bill No. 1 ("SB 1X").  
The Tax Review sets out the practical implication (likely cessation of 
electricity sales and curtailment of investment in new generation assets) and 
constitutional deficiencies of SB 1X.  Please note, SB 1X will not apply to 
sales of electricity made pursuant to binding written contracts executed on 
or before the date SB 1X is signed into law (if ever).  

The California Senate has passed SB 1X.  The California Assembly has drafted 
their own version, Assembly Bill No. 128 ("AB 128X"), which the Assembly is 
presently debating.  A Tax Review of AB 128X is also attached.

We will keep you advised regarding the progress of both SB 1X and AB 128X.  
Please advise if you have questions and/or comments.  Thanks.

Bustamante Sues 5 Power Firms, Alleging Price-Fixing Conspiracy 
Courts: Lieutenant governor and a legislator file on behalf of taxpayers. 
Industry official says claim is 'totally without merit.' 
By JULIE TAMAKI, Times Staff Writer
SACRAMENTO--Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante sued five big power generators Wednesday 
in a bid to recover billions in taxpayer money. 
Filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, the lawsuit accuses the power 
producers and 14 of their executives of engaging in a price-fixing conspiracy 
that has drained California's treasury. 
The companies are Duke Energy, Mirant Inc., Reliant Energy, Williams Energy 
Services and Dynegy Inc. 
"This energy cartel has basically scammed California taxpayers by 
manipulating the energy market out of billions of dollars," Bustamante said. 
In filing the lawsuit as private citizens on behalf of state taxpayers, 
Bustamante and Assemblywoman Barbara Matthews (D-Tracy) are betting on a Los 
Angeles jury to find that the companies colluded to manipulate the state's 
energy market--a conclusion federal regulators have yet to draw. 
The lawsuit comes on the heels of a proposal by Duke Energy to the Davis 
administration that all state investigations and lawsuits into the company's 
pricing activities be dropped in exchange for monetary concessions. 
Bustamante said he would only consider withdrawing his suit if the companies 
agreed to return all of their illegal profits. 
Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley described the legal action as another 
example of the deteriorating business environment in California. 
"The allegations are false, defamatory and totally without merit," he said. 
"We will vigorously defend ourselves." 
The lawsuit, which is available on Bustamante's Web site at 
<http://www.ltg.ca.gov>, contends that after the generators gained control of 
19 power plants in California, they began setting electricity prices and 
exerting "market power" to drive them up and keep them high. 
The latter feat was accomplished in part by withholding supplies, the suit 
says. Consequently, California's spending on electricity is expected to jump 
from $7 billion in 1999to as much as $70 billion this year. 
The document accuses the companies of raising their prices even after Davis 
declared a state of emergency Jan. 17, and it cites a report by state 
officials that the five companies acted like monopolists 98% of the time they

Liz,

The attached draft Asset Management Agreement (clean and latest marked copy 
received from Milbank Tweed) documents essentially two separate 
transactions.  Article 2 governs EPMI's duties as an administrator and 
overseer of NCPH's contractual and physical assets.  Article 3 governs EPMI's 
obligations to market power and capacity from the 2 NCPH plants.    I am told 
by the key originator, Heather Kroll, that EPMI has a number of these types 
of transactions in place and/or in the works.

The primary reason for my call to you last week was to confirm that EPMI is 
not regulatorily or otherwise prohibited from engaging in the 2 separate 
types of transactions described above.  Any thoughts you may have on the 
subject would be very much appreciated.

Thanks,
Steve Van Hooser

Elizabeth;

I am based in the S?o Paulo Office and can be reached at

note that I am 3 hours ahead of Houston time.

Liz,

For some reason I didn't get your voicemail.  I'll stop by this afternoon to 
double check that you are OK with the EPMI entity in the role of  Asset 
Manager/Marketing  Agent in the North Carolina Power Holdings transaction 
that we are structuring with AIG/Highstar.

Steve/Christian,

The attached file is a draft of an asset management agreement prepared by Stu 
Zisman.  The later version obviously contained more negotiated points, so I 
think this one is more helpful.

I'm working on a transaction now which involves serving load as well as 
selling power. I found this one helpful for issue identification and 
exculpatory language, however.  


Kay

Hi Peter

Pacific Gas and Electric paid us for gas purchases on May 25 for April 
production.
They paid amounts larger than the post bankruptcy invoice totals. 


Here are the details:

1. Pre Bankruptcy invoice for April 1-12 deliveries.

  4136SA   852,780.50 US

  Payment Rec'd  458,687.37 US

 It appears that they paid 53.787% of the pre bankruptcy invoice.


2. Pre Bankruptcy invoices for April 1-12 deliveries

  4120SA   2,033,749.68 CDN
  4138SA   2,797,179.00 CDN
     ------------------
  Subtotal  4,830,928.68 CDN

 Post Bankruptcy invoices for Apr 13-30 deliveries

  4139SA   3,425,804.71 CDN


 Total all sales for April production

     8,256,733.39 CDN

  Payment Rec'd  6,024,238.66 CDN


 It appears that they paid 53.787% of the pre bankruptcy invoice.


Please let me know what you want me to do with the excess payment.
Thanks
Cheryl

Jim -- EPSA already acts as our agent on generic NERC matters, especially the 
Market Interface Committee.  EPSA will not get involved in the NERC regions 
such as WSPP, since these are local matters.  If we do not have the resources 
to be effective in the WSCC region, we should discuss pulling out with Tim.  

Christi -- Please forward these documents to Jeff Hodge or Elizabeth Sager 
and ask for their help.
I will need to vote on them early next week at the WSCC Board of Directors 
meeting.  Thanks  JOE

Not sure if we ever decided anything on this?  Have we ever thought about

I don't know if we have the $$ to review these documents.

Attached is a summation of the WSCC Executive Policy Issues Task Force 
meeting held in San Francisco on November 2,  In addition there are several 
attachnebts that will be voted on at the Board meeting in December including 
the By Laws for the formation of the WIO.  It is anticipated that the WIO 
will be ready for a FERC filing during the 1s half of 2001  There is a large 
amt of material and some of it needs review by legal in my opinion.   Note 
that we voted  "no" on the EHV ballot  because it restricts access to 
information.  The bylaws and the detail documents are most critical for legal 
review.  For clarity read them in the following order:  EPITF Nov 2;  
wiosummary; bylaws;detail doc.  If there aqre questions you can call me at 
520 646 5539 or E mail at richard.ingersoll@enron.com

Carol, did you look over Penny's resume?  Interested?  She just called this 
morning and said her job has been eliminated.  She's freaking out!  

Did you find a restaurant for your mom and sister? I didn't get the voice 
mail until this morning.  I'm so sorry. I don't know any vegetarian 
restaurants though.

I attach a summary of the 11 outstanding ECC transactions under ECC's GTC:



In summary, the principal risks are:

Principal Risks:

1. Unexecuted Confirmation Letters on approx. 75,000 GJs per day
2. Receivables (approx. US $25MM pre-petition and approx. US $300K per day 
post-petition)
3. MTM (aggregate negative MTM approx. US $1.9MM)

Please note:

1. I am trying to track down PG&E's back-up paper sent for each deal and will 
update the chart to indicate the differences to their GTCs.  We have found 
only one corresponding PG&E Confirmation Letter (for TAGG #N13588.1/2/3) 
which refers to PG&E's form of unexecuted Master Agreement.  I have 
summarized at the end of the chart the applicable provisions of PG&E's Master 
Agreement form if it were to govern.

2. I have not been successful in tracking down Canadian insolvency counsel 
over the weekend, but will keep trying.

Thanks, Michael.  By the way, can you confirm for me that Elizabeth's draft
really captures Enron's version of what we "agreed to" at our meeting?  It
looks off to us, and I wonder if it does to you, also.  I don't mean to go

 Pacific Gas & Electric Company
 77 Beale Street
 San Francisco, CA

 Attention: [                  and Lawrence C. Witalis]


      Re:  Contract Termination Payment Calculation Discussions

 Dear Sirs:

           As you know, pursuant to its rights under the Master Power
 Purchase Agreement between Enron Power Marketing, Inc. ("EPMI") and
Pacific
 Gas & Electric Company ("PG&E) (collectively, the "Parties"), dated
October
 9, 2000 (the "MPA"), EPMI elected to terminate the 3 power
transactions
 thereunder as a result of the bankruptcy filing made by PG&E on
April 6,
 2001. Such notice of termination was delivered to PG&E on April 9,
2001.
 Additional contract terminations either became effective
automatically as a
 result of PG&E's bankruptcy filing under the terms of the particular
 contract or were elected by certain affiliates of EPMI, namely Enron
Canada
 Corp. ("ECC") and Enron North America Corp. ("ENA"), as provided in
the
 relevant termination notices furnished by ECC and ENA to PG&E.
EPMI, ECC
 and ENA are referred to collectively herein, as appropriate, as
"Enron,"
 and the various contracts and/or transactions thereunder between
PG&E and
 Enron that were terminated are referred to as the "Contracts."

           Pursuant to such contract terminations, Enron provided
written
 notice to PG&E, as reflected in a letter dated April 24, 2001
(including
 all applicable supporting materials and calculations), of the
applicable
 termination payment calculations due and owing to Enron or PG&E, as
the
 case may be, under the Contracts.  Under each of the Contracts, once
the
 non-defaulting party, in this case Enron, furnishes the calculations
of the
 termination payments, the defaulting party, in this case PG&E, is
obligated
 to notify the non-defaulting party within a specified time frame
whether it
 disagrees with the non-defaulting party's termination value
calculations.
 For example, under Section 5.5 of the MPA, PG&E (as the defaulting
party
 due to its bankruptcy) is obligated to furnish EPMI within 2
business days
 of receipt of EPMI's calculations a detailed explanation of any
dispute it
 may have with Enron's termination payment calculations.  The other
 Contracts provide for different time periods by which the defaulting
party
 must respond to the non-defaulting party's calculations.

           At our meeting on April 25, 2001, we agreed to extend the
time
 period by which PG&E must provide notice to Enron of its dispute, if
any,
 with the termination calculations furnished by Enron under any of
the
 Contracts (a "Dispute Notice") in order to permit further
discussions
 between the Parties (the "Settlement Discussions") concerning (1)
the
 methodology and/or procedures employed by Enron to make such
calculations
 and the supporting material therefor and (2) a possible settlement
between
 the Parties with respect to the amount and nature of the Parties'
claims
 under the Contracts and the treatment thereof on an aggregate basis.
In
 order to provide the Parties with sufficient time to negotiate a
possible
 resolution, the date by which PG&E shall be required to furnish any
Dispute
 Notice shall be extended to [May 25, 2001] (the "Initial Extension
 Period"), or such later date as may be agreed by the Parties,
including any
 extension as may be effective during the period that any settlement
 agreement that may be executed by the Parties in connection herewith
 ("Settlement Agreement") may be under consideration by the
Bankruptcy
 Court.

           During the Initial Extension Period, Enron agrees to
maintain in
 full force and effect for the benefit of PG&E all five letters of
credit
 with respect to its obligations under the MPA (including the letters
of
 credit from Banca di Roma, in the amount of $7,000,000; from Banca
 Commerciale Italiana, in the amount of $5,750,000; from Bayerische
Hypo-und
 Vereinsbank AG, in the amount of $30,000,000; and from Banca
Nazionale del
 Lavorno, in the amounts of $44,000,000 and $13,500,000,
respectively),
 subject to the rights of EPMI to replace or provide substitutes for
such
 letters of credit, to assure payment by Enron of the termination
payment,
 if any, due from it to PG&E under the MPA.  In the event that the
 Settlement Discussions have not resulted in the execution of a
Settlement
 Agreement by [May 15, 2001], but the Parties are continuing to
negotiate in
 good faith with respect thereto, Enron agrees to extend for a period
of no
 less than __ days any letter of credit that shall be due to expire
within
 __ days after the end of the Initial Extension Period and Enron
shall
 promptly provide PG&E with confirmation of such extension.  In the
event
 that the Parties successfully conclude a Settlement Agreement and
such
 agreement is submitted to the Bankruptcy Court for approval, the
Parties
 anticipate that (1) such Settlement Agreement will include a
provision
 requiring the maintenance of letters of credit by Enron during the
period
 the Parties are awaiting Bankruptcy Court approval and (2) the
aggregate
 amount of the letters of credit will be reduced, as mutually agreed
by the
 Parties, to more closely match the agreed-upon amount of the
settlement
 amount due from Enron.

           In the event, for any reason, the Parties cannot reach
closure on
 a Settlement Agreement, or any such Settlement Agreement is agreed
to by
 the Parties but ultimately is not approved without modification by
the
 Bankruptcy Court, and thereafter PG&E issues to Enron a Dispute
Notice
 under the MPA, PG&E shall not make, or cause to be made, a draw
under the
 letters of credit securing Enron's payment obligation under the MPA
until
 (1) the amount of the applicable termination payment due to PG&E has
been
 finally determined pursuant to the terms of the MPA and (2) Enron
shall
 have failed to make payment required by it pursuant to Section 5.4,
subject
 to Section 10.12.

           The Parties further acknowledge that, in connection with
the
 Parties' desire to attempt to negotiate the terms of a Settlement
 Agreement, the Parties anticipate that they will simultaneously
commence
 negotiations concerning new master gas purchase and sale agreements
 pursuant to which ENA and EEC, respectively, would sell and PG&E
would
 purchase natural gas, including under term (as opposed to only
daily)
 transactions to the extent mutually agreed by the Parties.
Notwithstanding
 the foregoing, neither PG&E nor Enron shall be obligated to enter
into any
 such agreements or transactions, it being acknowledged and agreed by
the
 Parties that any decisions or commitments with respect thereto shall
be
 subject to the sole discretion of each of the Parties and no
contract or
 commitment shall occur or be deemed to have occurred until the
applicable
 terms and conditions have been agreed to and definitive agreements
have
 been executed by the Parties.



           If the foregoing accurately reflects our mutual
understandings,
 could you please execute a copy of this letter and return it to me
via
 facsimile at your earliest convenience, with a hard copy by
overnight mail.
 Thank you.


                                    Yours truly,

    Subject:  RE: PG&E and Enron Stand-Still Agreement

    Elizabeth:

    Four points.  First, I can't call up an attachment to your
e-mail; can
    you
    please resend it?  Second, I believe that the PG&E and Enron
    representatives
    at the meeting agreed that Enron would keep the LCs in place
    month-to-month
    for the entire period until a settlement is reached and approved
by the
    Bankruptcy Court; of course, if negotiations break down, that
    month-to-month
    requirement could end, but the LCs were a principal comfort point
for
    PG&E
    going forward, and your changes in this portion of the draft may
be
    unacceptable to us (again, I'll have to review them to be
certain).
    Third,
    I recall that we agreed generally, if not specifically, that we
would
    give
    ourselves breathing space to reach an agreement, without an
    artificially-imposed "window" as you call it, and I do not think
such a
    window is advisable at this time; PG&E is perhaps even more eager
than
    Enron
    to resolve the Termination Payment issue, and our discussions can
always
    be
    truncated if talks stall, but I do not think such windows do much
to
    promote
    cooperative efforts generally.  Fourth, I think PG&E was very
clear in
    its
    expectation that, as part of these discussions, Enron would both
enter
    into
    new Master Agreements with PG&E and into sales of gas on
commercially
    reasonable terms.  I recall no disagreement from anyone on
Enron's side
    of
    the table to this proposition, and think the draft I sent to you
    captures
    the gist of what PG&E would like to see.

    Admitterdly, without reviewing the mark-up I'm shooting blind a
bit
    here.  I
    mention these points mainly as background for my request that you
check
    in
    with the Enron reps who attended the meeting to see if perhaps
your
    comments
    are off the mark.  After I've read your mark-up and you have done
this
    minor
    bit of due diligence, we can talk, tomorrow hopefully, in an
attempt to
    resolve whatever differences we actually may have on the terms of
the
    stand-still agreement.  I very much hope any such differences are
more
    minor
    than your comments suggest, as otherwise this might not be a very
good
    start
    for our clients' efforts to reach an amicable resolution.

    I look forward to talking tomorrow.  Please suggest a time.

    Thanks.

    Larry

       Subject:  Re: PG&E and Enron Stand-Still Agreement



       Larry:  In accordance with our conversation late last week, I
am
    enclosing
       a revised draft of the proposed standstill agreement that was
    discussed on
       Wednesday.  My comments primarily involve the following:

       (1)  As you and I discussed last week,  I thought it made
sense to
    specify
       a reasonable date by which Enron and PG&E shall have reached
closure
    on a
       settlement agreement on the contract termination and related
claims.
    I
       proposed a one month period to do that.  If the parties can't
come
    to an
       agreement in that time period, then the "mechanics" in the MPA
for
       resolving a dispute dealing with the calculation of the
termination
    payment
       would be "reactivated."  Obviously, if we are making progress,
the
    parties
       can always extend the date.  I felt it was appropriate to
specify
    the
       window period to make sure that everyone is focused on
attempting to
    get a
       prompt resolution.  Assuming a final settlement agreement is
agreed
    upon,
       the conditions of the extension of the "stay" would be
embodied in
    the
       settlement agreement itself  (as opposed to this letter).

       (2)  Enron agreed at the meeting that it would keep the LCs in
place
    while
       the parties were working to see if a settlement agreement
could be
    reached,
       and that requirement is reflected in our revisions to the
letter.
    Thus,
       the revised letter provides that Enron will do this for the
"Initial
       Extension Period" (i.e., to May 25, 2001).  Your draft had
provided
    that
       Enron would be required to keep the LCs in place even if no
    settlement
       agreement were to be reached.  My view is that any requirement
to
    maintain
       the LCs beyond the Initial Extension Period and any conditions
with
    respect
       thereto, if agreed to by Enron, should be part of the final
    settlement
       agreement executed by the parties, rather than as part of this
    letter.
       Also, we note that, as a contractual matter, the MPA does not
    require the
       non-defaulting party to keep in place any security in favor of
the
       defaulting party when, as a result of a termination, the
    non-defaulting
       party owes a payment to the defaulting party.  See Sec. 5.5.

       (3)  Your draft of the letter provided that Enron "agrees" to
enter
    into
       new master gas agreements and consummate term transactions on
    "commercially
       reasonable terms."  The revised letter specifies that Enron
agrees
    to
       negotiate with PG&E in these respects simultaneously with the
    negotiations
       towards a settlement agreement, but any commitment on Enron's
part
    to
       effect a contract or transaction with PG&E will only arise as
a
    result of
       the parties' execution of the definitive transaction documents
(as
    opposed
       to this letter), the execution of which shall be in the sole
    discretion of
       each of the parties.


       Please call me at your convenience to discuss any questions on
the
       foregoing or on the revised letter.  Thanks in advance for
your help
    in
       moving this forward.

       Ms. Sager:

Payment
    and of
       other claims Enron may have against PG&E in Bankruptcy Court.
I do
    not
       have
       your mailing address; yet, PG&E would like to receive
assurance soon
    that
       Enron agrees with the terms of this proposed letter agreement.
    After
       reviewing the draft, please indicate Enron's agreement by
return
    e-mail to
       me.  Or, please call me (415-973-3817) to discuss.

       Thanks.

I wonder if Section 2.7 may need to go into the SD Warren K in some 
fashion...  I will discuss this with you tomorrow.

Here's the draft I was telling you about earlier today.  The CMS is addressed 
in sec. 2.7 I think.  The New Market Products concept was aimed at makeing 
sure that Enron wouldn't have responsibility for any ancillary services 
"invented" after the deal was signed, unless, of course, we had new 
negotiations w/ new price, etc.

What do you think of Schedule M to the EEI ?
Should we propose that it ---or something like it be considered ?
Since it is part of EEI, I am sure certain people will oppose it but for
the same reason might want a WSPP version.
Thoughts ?

Hi, Elizabeth!

Cynthia asked me to forward you our Master Services Agreement relating to our 
telecom products and the Master Media Services Agreement relating to 
advertising.  We will be making conforming changes to both agreements to 
correct nits as we find them, but will send you any substantive changes we 
may make.  Let us know if you have any questions or need anything else.

Marie

P.S.  I can't believe that the day I saw you so many times I forgot to 
congratulate you on becoming a VP!  Am I slow or what?(you really don't need 
to answer).  CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!!!!  You deserve it!

"David Paulker apologizes for cancelling yesterday.  They are all available on
11/2 or 11/3 at 9:30 am."

I can't do it on the 3rd, but I can do it on the 2d.  What do your schedules
look like?  Thanks.

I have discussed relocating Shari to Portland with both of you.  Elizabeth 
wanted to make sure that she had hired at least one additional attorney 
before Shari could move to Portland.  When I spoke to Mark earlier this week 
he indicated that January 1st  was a reasonable deadline.  I would like to 
get some closure/finality on this matter -- both from a business perspective 
and to allow Shari to know what the future holds.  Let me know your thoughts.

Marcus,

I spoke with two of our schedulers and they inform me that it is ok to 
utilize the term Eastern Prevailing Time to cover deliveries at MECS or Into 
Cinergy.  There is no issue on a 16 hour block since.  The problem usually 
happens when there is an off peak 8 hour block and there is confusion on the 
hour extending into midnight.

Attached is the latest draft with my comments and additional drafting. We 
need to be certain that Kevin Presto is clear as to the Products and the 
risks that we will be taking going forward.

In addition, as we discussed with Consumers this morning, from a scheduling 
perspective, we need to be comfortable that the time limits will be as per 
Eastern Prevailing Time and not Central Prevailing Time. If we are, then we 
need to change the Into Cinergy definition in EEI to address this.
 
As part of managing this process, as you know my wife is expecting our first 
child and with the due date having been passed I am on "baby alert" which 
could mean me leaving at any minute. I have therefore started to copy 
Elizabeth Sager on the negotiations and she, or another member of the team 
will be in a position to start running with this, in the event that it is not 
signed before I leave.
 
Regards,
 
Marcus

HOMEPAGE: http://www.thelaw.net
REMOVE: http://www.thelaw.net/remove.htm

     Legal research often comes in waves, but as night follows day, that 
onerous monthly commitment to West or Lexis is always there. But with so many 
new options, it doesn't have to be this way.


--VIABLE ALTERNATIVES ABOUND

     True though it may be that your West or Lexis rep is out to put you on 
that fat annual contract, both companies offer a variety of online 
alternatives. A person can:

----log in and buy most any document for a few bucks
----Shepardize or Keycite for around $4
----subscribe to KeyCite for $35 a month
----rent a state for a week for $40
----conduct transaction based case law searches only when you have to
----Supreme Court case law from 1790 is now available on the web for FREE
----California state case law from 1934 is now available on the web for FREE
----the landscape continues to change rapidly


--CHOOSE THE RIGHT TOOL FOR THE JOB

     There can be no question that the commercial value of proprietary legal 
research resources will continue to drop as more and more primary and 
secondary materials migrate online. At TheLaw.net Corporation we advocate 
choosing the right tool for the job. And one of the best single tools you can 
own these days is our flagship software solution, TheLaw.net Professional 
Legal Browser.


--LESS THAN $1 A DAY FOR EVERYTHING, UNLIMITED ACCESS

     For just $395 annually for an individual, TheLaw.net gives you a 
remarkable foundation of primary and secondary resources, on an unlimited use 
basis, with a national scope, including, but certainly not limited to, the 
following:

----A great proprietary, searchable case law database that includes the U.S. 
Supreme Court, the 13 Federal circuits, the 50 state supreme courts and 
intermediate appellate courts. See, http://www.thelaw.net/caselawgrid.htm

----Literally millions of searchable cases, updated four times daily, offered 
on an unlimited use basis

----Streamlined access to:
------Federal and state statutes, rules and regulations
------the CFR and Federal Register
------executive agency databases and bill trackers
------nearly 1,000 news resources
------another 1,000 reference desk tools
------nearly 10,000 practice area helpers and much, much more
------over 50,000 documents and databases
------all just a fast click or two away on your desktop 24 - 7 - 365


--THELAW.NET MAY OR MAY NOT BE ALL YOU NEED

     Depending on size, practice area and/or jurisdiction, TheLaw.net may 
well have everything you need. If not, West and Lexis are available online, a 
la carte for those times when you really need them. As an example, TheLaw.net 
is not yet a great resource for Federal District Court opinions.

     It all depends on what you want your life to look like. If the 
convenience and elegance of the gold standard is worth the rates charged by 
the legal research cartel, you should keep doing what you've been doing and 
renew that annual contract with Company A or Company B. If not, and you feel 
like you continue to get hammered at a time when given the efficiencies of 
computerized distribution of data, prices ought to be dropping, we can help.

All:
I haven't heard from Woody yet, but I thought I'd chime in to add something 
to John's excellent summary of the Maine SOS potential deal.

Perhaps the biggest legal risk is that Enron would be subjected to Maine 
rules and regulations on SOS, which could be changed at any time.  During 
phone conversations over the last 2 weeks, we explained to Maine PUC staff 
that, in a wholesale contract, we usually do not retain this risk.  We 
explained the clauses in the UI deal (anonymously, of course) that (1) 
prohibit UI from advocating change that would adversely affect us and (2) if 
such change occurs anyway, requires UI to negotiate w/ us to restore the 
original economic bargain.  The staff indicated a willingness to have the PUC 
issue its order awarding the SOS contract also say that the PUC would not 
change the rules for the term of that award.  But we don't know how they 
would do that (we might see a draft early this week), and that still doesn't 
really remove the regulatory change risk  -- only a statute could do that, 
and they don't appear to have much of an appetite for that.  

On the damages issues, the contract w/ the T&D company gives Enron no comfort 
at all.  The T&D company has virtually no liability to Enron, nor does anyone 
else.  However, under SOS Rule 301, if Enron defaults, the Maine PUC will 
order the T&D company how to handle finding replacement service and Enron 
would be exposed to the full replacement costs, in spite of the cap on the 
Enron Corp. guarantee.  Effectively, this means that Enron Corp.'s liability 
is capped, but the Enron entity that provides the SOS can potentially be sued 
by the Maine Attorney General for additional amounts needed to pay for the 
additional costs -- or the PUC can approve a rate increase from customers.  
(Sounds like this would be a political decision, eventually.)  The difference 
between this exposure and how we usually handle this issue is that our 
contract usually sets parameters on calculating replacement costs and 
requires commercially reasonable behavior, standards for which are widely 
accepted and ultimately interpreted by commercial arbitrators in a neutral 
forum.  In the Maine situation, if we want to dispute the amounts claimed, 
we'd have to argue about whether commercially reasonable behavior was even 
required, and we'd be doing that in litigation in a Maine court facing the 
Maine Attorney General.  

Please let me know if you'd like any other info or wish to discuss further. 
Regards,
Janice

Janet:

As promised, here is a brief synopsis of the Maine SOS transaction terms and 
issues.  I am in the office all day and free to discuss if you like.  Woody 
is actually on the way to Houston and is available after about noon central 
time.

Janice Moore (x31794) has worked on the many legal issues and can elaborate 
more fully on the issues there, including the lack of a real contract 
counterparty.  Jim Meyn and Pearce Hammond in structuring can give you more 
details on the load stats, etc in each of the classes for each utility.

I will also forward some old email correspondence I have which discusses the 
various legal issues and bidder qualification requirements, etc.

Please feel free to call to discuss.  (978-449-9936).

John

Janet, sorry I was unable to return your call today, but I was tied up most
of the day in meetings, one of which was with Powerex.  Though it dealt with
other matters I did have a chance to briefly discuss this matter with
Powerex and I am advised that the issue of the credit annex may be or become
academic.  The original $340,000,000 has been reduced to $240,000,000 and is
to be further reduced as a result of pricing changes.  In addition, Enron is
apparently providing a new or increased letter of credit, which will be
sufficient to cover the reduced liability.  As a result it is expected that
the necessity for the cash deposit will disappear next week, perhaps as
early as Tuesday.  If this proves to be the case, the credit annex will not
be required, thereby making life easier for both of us.  If the foregoing
result does not occur as early in the week as contemplated or if it becomes
necessary for your cash management purposes, Powerex has no objection to
signing a letter extending the interim letter agreement for, say, another 2
weeks (if it becomes apparent that the cash deposit will still be required
after that time we will have to revisit the drafting of the credit annex).

Further to my email of Nov. 29th, Tim has now signed off on the usage of this 
list. Chris Foster ok'd it several weeks ago. 

Tim has asked that both of you let me know of any objections/comments to this 
list by the close of business today. Otherwise,  it will be used from 
tomorrow onwards. As indicated previously, we only plan to send it to 
counterparties who request to have something in writing which details the key 
distinctions between the EEI and the WSPP.  

Thanks, 

Shari and Christian 

___________

1. WSPP Section 10 - Definition of "Uncontrollable Force": This definition is 
too broad.   It sets out a litany of events, any one of which may be 
considered an Uncontrollable Force  by a Party seeking to avoid having to pay 
liquidated damages in respect of a Firm Transaction under which it  has 
committed to sell or deliver "firm" energy. For instance, it is hard to 
imagine that a "drought" is a legitimate excuse to relieve a Party of its 
obligation to deliver Firm Power. How can a drought cause power not to flow? 
What is a "material shortage"? etc...  In contrast, EEI's definition of Force 
Majeure does not include a lengthy list from which a party could pick and 
choose to its advantage; rather the key to the EEI definition is that it 
characterizes FM as an event that "prevents one Party from performing its 
obligations".  

Related to this critically important concept of firm deliverability, where 
precise wording is very important,  is the puzzling existence of Section 25 
of the WSPP Agreement:   

"25. JUDGMENTS AND DETERMINATIONS: 
Whenever it is provided in this Agreement that a Party shall be the sole 
judge of whether, to what extent, or under what conditions it will provide a 
given service, its exercise of its judgment shall be final and not subject to 
challenge.  Whenever it is provided that (i) a service under a given 
transaction may be curtailed under certain conditions or circumstances, the 
existence of which are determined by or in the judgment of a Party, or ... 
that Party's or the Executive Committee's determination or exercise of 
judgment shall be final and not subject to challenge if it is made in good 
faith and not made arbitrarily or capriciously." 
 
Whatever the intent  of this wording may have been,   what is clear is that 
it could only cause problems  in resolving a deliverability issue.   
  
2.  WSPP Section 27- "Creditworthiness".  This clause is too subjective.  It 
would allow one party, for potentially wrong reasons,  to unilaterally 
question the other's financial viability and require it to post collateral in 
an amount which is a "reasonable estimate of the damages" to the requesting 
party.  If such collateral is not provided within the allotted time frame, an 
Event of Default occurs. In contrast, the EEI provides for an objective test 
in Section 8.1/8.2 (c) which is based on a set collateral threshold expressed 
in $ and which is likely to be commensurate with the amount of unsecured 
exposure that a party feels comfortable with.  In addition, Enron routinely 
includes an objectively determinable  bilateral "material adverse change" 
clause in the EEI Cover Sheet  as a Collateral Posting Event /additional 
Event of Default which would be  triggered by a party's credit rating not 
meeting investment grade criteria or certain financial covenants/ratios.  We 
believe that this combination provides an objectively determinable level of 
credit protection which both Parties can understand and agree to before 
entering into any transactions under the agreement.       

3. All of the following points related to early termination of an agreement 
are very  important to any Non-Defaulting party in the precarious 
circumstances surrounding the termination of a complex trading relationship.  
This is the area where the Agreement is going to have the most potential 
legal significance  to the Parties, and this is an area where the WSPP comes 
up short of the EEI in some fairly substantial ways. 

 Events of Default and Early Termination.   The list of events which can 
become Events of Default is too short.  The absence of important events  
creates significant legal risk.  For instance, Section 22.1(b) speaks to a 
failure by a party to have made accurate representations and warranties as 
required by Section 36.  Section 36 is the Trade Option Exemption. This begs 
the question as to what happens in the event of a breach of Section 37?  
Section 37 is where the parties represent that they have the authority to 
enter into these types of transactions, have all necessary regulatory 
authorizations, etc..  With no Event of Default relating to a breach of these 
Section 37  rep's and warranties, what would one's remedy be in the event of 
a breach of Section 37?  In contrast, the EEI has a clear Event of Default 
based on a breach of rep's and warranties.  And, consider this example:    
the WSPP Agreement does not make it an Event of Default if a Party breaches a 
material covenant of the Agreement.   This basic legal point which appears in 
the EEI agreement is entirely missing.   

In addition to those listed in the WSPP Agreement, the EEI contains the 
following additional Events of Default : Merger without Assumption, Cross 
Default, Default by a Party's Guarantor (breach of rep., failure to pay, 
bankruptcy, expiry of guarantee while transactions are outstanding, 
repudiation of guaranty).  

 Calculation of Early Termination Payment: In order to calculate the value of 
any prematurely terminated transactions occasioned by an Early Termination 
Event, the WSPP requires a party to use a "market quotation comparison" 
method and go out into the market and obtain the present value of the 
affected transactions. Any related hedges that the Non-Defaulting Party has 
in place and now no longer needs cannot be included in the calculations. In 
contrast, the EEI,  as supplemented in our proposed Cover Sheet,  would allow 
the Non-Defaulting Party the flexibility to calculate a good faith estimate 
of its Loss by using quotes or internal calculations. The NDP would also be 
allowed to take into account any hedges or breakage costs associated with 
having had to terminate the transactions early as a result of the other 
party's default.  

Another problematic point in the WSPP is in Section 22.2 where it requires 
the Non-Defaulting Party to exercise its right of termination within 30 days 
of learning about an Event of Default. (An event does not become an "Event of 
Default" until notice and failure to cure has occurred.) Where  an event has 
been established as an Event of Default,   if the Non-Defaulting Party does 
not call a termination within this timeframe (and, if no extension is granted 
by mutual agreement ), the Non-Defaulting Party forfeits its right to 
terminate.  This unnecessary time restriction can only cause trouble in the 
already difficult circumstances that will exist in a potential termination 
situation.   In contrast, under the EEI, at any time so long as an Event of 
Default has occurred and is continuing, the Non-Defaulting Party has the 
right to designate an Early Termination Date and terminate all transactions. 

4. Governing Law- The WSPP provides for Utah law to govern the agreement in 
most situations. Most physical power counterparties are not located in Utah 
and so are not familiar with this law. We would prefer to have a more 
developed state law govern a power trading contract. The EEI provides for NY 
law which is well suited to handling trading related disputes.  It is 
generally recognized that New York commercial law, expecially in the 
important trading related areas of oral trading and bankruptcy is superior to 
the law of most other states.  The ISDA, for example, uses New York law for 
these reasons.   

5. Dispute Resolution.   The WSPP Agreement invokes arbitration and the EEI 
agreement does not.  We prefer arbitration, however, the WSPP version of it 
is unnecessarily complex.   First, it is not clear under the WSPP Agreement 
that all claims or disputes arising under it are able to be arbitrated.  Some 
disputes can be arbitrated, some cannot.    Our preferred approach would be 
to use arbitration for all claims or disputes.  Then, assuming that a 
permissible dispute is being arbitrated, the WSPP has a complicated mandatory 
"informal" and then "formal" dispute resolution procedure which requires the 
constant involvement of the WSPP Chair and the Chair's pre-chosen list of 
mediators.  We think it would be better to have each party select an 
arbitrator, and then have these two arbitrators select a third independent 
arbitrator with at least 8 years experience in the electricity markets. We 
also think it would be fairer for the dispute to be settled using the 
arbitration methods set forth by the American Arbitration Association. 

6. Payment Netting and Closeout  Netting/Set-off.    A good master trading 
agreement should clearly address both  payment netting and close out netting 
and set-off in separate, explicit paragraphs of the agreement.  They are 
separate topics.    The EEI does this.  Section 6.4 deals with payment 
netting  and  Sections 5.3 and  5.6 deal with settlement netting and closeout 
setoffs.     These unambiguous paragraphs provide very explicit terms under 
which these important concepts are addressed and thus provide  a valuable 
credit management tool on which the parties can rely.   The WSPP Agreement, 
on the other hand, fails to clearly distinguish between payment netting and 
closeout netting/setoff.  Section 28.1 seems to be dealing with payment 
netting and the reference to set off is incomplete and ambiguous as to 
whether or not it applies to closeout setoff.  Furthermore, Section 28.2 
provides that a party that elects to use payment netting must post this 
information on the WSPP homepage "(once the WSPP Homepage possesses the 
necessary capability)."   What can be posted can be unposted.  This whole 
system of confirming netting seems unnecessarily complicated.   

7. Invoicing- Section 9.5 of the WSPP allows a party to send an invoice 
within two (2) years from the date on which the invoice should have been 
delivered.   In contrast, Section 6.1 of the EEI has no such time frame and 
the parties are encouraged to send out invoices as soon as possible after the 
end of each month.

9. Contested Amounts: Section 6.2 of the EEI provides that in the event of a 
dispute, the owing party pays only the uncontested amount and then tries to 
resolve the discrepancy. On the other hand, Section 9.4 of the WSPP requires 
the contesting party to pay the entire disputed amount upfront and then try 
to resolve the discrepancy. 

10. Breadth of Agreement: The EEI  is  a nationwide document, drafted 
recently, by participants from all parts of the country,  during the most 
recent phase of wholesale deregulation, when a number of typically difficult 
legal issues had already been painfully experienced by companies.        It  
includes definitions for East power products as well as West power products 
(including products transacted for a California Delivery Point as well as any 
other Delivery Point in the WSCC).   The WSPP Agreement on the other hand 
began in the west during the regulated era, and   still contains many 
vestiges of  its origins that are no longer necessary, and, therefore, it 
cannot yet claim the same national scope as the EEI.  For example,  it still 
contemplates the regional  notion of "Membership," in the Western System 
Power Pool.  What does this mean?  Why is this kind of membership necessary?  
What legal value does it have?  Why should a power trading master agreement 
need to have sections such as sections 8  dealing with Organization and 
Administration of various committees?   No other master agreement dealing 
with any other commodity, including the ISDA agreement, contains these 
notions of membership and committee structures and duties in their texts.

Just a friendly reminder that if you still want to a credit annex in place 
with Powerex, Powerex's outside counsel needs a "go ahead" from Powerex 
before he is willing to negotiate. (In other words, the Powerex folks 
probably need a push from you to authorize their outside counsel.) 

I realize that with the change in energy prices, this may not be a priority 
any longer.  However,  I wanted to bring it up in case you still wanted an 
annex in place for future reference.  

Please call me at x57400 with any questions.

Attached are some initial thoughts for discussion on our call.Your views are
appreciated.

Panel 1

WSPP and EEI
At this point, I have seen materials from Bobby Campo. Andy has circulated
to all. Bobby's presentation gives the background and evolution of the WSPP
tariff/agreement. Bobby also provides his conclusions regarding the future
of WSPP.
Since we have seem Bobby's presentation, how should we structure the
remainder of our presentation?

Mike -- Since Bobby is giving a business flavor to the presentation, it may
make sense for you to focus more on legal and regulatory elements. For
example: what is WSPP's current regulatory status? How does that affect its
use? How is it administered/modified etc?.What material changes have
occurred to its terms over time? Where do you see it going?

Liz/Harlan-- How do think you should approach this topic?.It seems to me
that one obvious issue is the distinction between the a tariff based doc and
a standardized bilateral agreement. Regional vs. nationwide also seems
appropriate  Further, I think a discussion of the evolution of the EEI
agreement and some of the reasons for its development would be useful.  For
example, the lack of common bilateral credit provisions and product
definitions in 1998-99.A discussion of documents like ISDA and other master
trading agreements for physicals would also be useful. In addition, since
Dynegy and Enron are major players, your firms perspective on trading
documentation would be helpfull.Does EEI provide appropriate flexibility for
use in varied markets?[[Bobby- can you speak for Mirant here- as you know,
Mirant was an important contributor to the EEI contract].What document does
Enron on-line use? Finally, I think Liz's pitch for the Master-Master may
make sense in this context.

Finally, I think we should leave some time for questions; to comment on one
another's presenations;and , to provide some real world trading issues we
have run into if appropriate.

Panel 2

Let's make a deal

There is a lot packed into this panel and I'm told many of our audience are
not that sophisticated. I think we should approach this as a primer.I will
volunteer to do thevfirst few slides and generally set up the context for
contract specific discussions. How about Dede doing "set up"-- i.e.
negotiating the cover sheet/elections and optional provisions-- Liz doing
trading mechanics /oral transactions/confirmations/ and(her favorite) "into"
and Fritz doing all other products.  We can all chime in.


Panel 3


Some of this panel will carry over from the previous panel. For this one,
how about Andy doing the obligations to deliver/receive under the contract
slide with Harlan describing some real world issues her has seem with
delivery points or transmission.Harlan can then do the liquidated damages
and force majeure slides (setting things up in theory). Fritz can bat
clean-up with run through of the examples. Of course, we can all chime in.

I talked to David Portz about MECS and have passed on the information that he 
gave me to Eileen.  He believes that we should not go back to confirming 
under the 1996 agreement since we have been confirming under the long form 
GTC and they have executed them in the past.  I am faxing an executed confirm 
to Eileen and told her that she could contact David regarding this matter 
since I could not convince her that the long form GTC controls.  We would 
have to get Leslie Reeves approval in order to change the payment terms of 
the long form confirm to 10 days after receipt..

Let me try and clear this up.  Based on the email thread, a conference call 
on the 14th is favored.  Since Bill McCoy is speaking at the NYC brown bag, 
my suggestion is to set up the conference call with the parties you 
identified for after the brown bag, which would be sometime after 2pm NY 
time.  I have a call in to Michael Shenberg at Strook, Strook & Lavan to see 
if it would be ok for Bill Fritz, (he's going to lunch) and I to stay at 
their offices for the call.  Otherwise we'd go somewhere else.  I would set 
up the call through our service.  ok?

On another note.  We will find out on the 11th what Southern wants to do for 
the credit workshop in February (January is too early).  Because of turmoil 
in the markets out west, Randy has now asked me to draft a program.  Any 
suggestions would be greatly appreciated.   Also, I am now going ahead and 
planning to do a California workshop for April 20th that would precede the 
EEI Legal Committee conference.

Elizabeth:  Not to add to your woes, but I am forwarding an e-mail from 
Michael re: SoCalEd which, as you know, could go the same route as PG&E in 
the not too distant future in light of the fact that its MOU with the State 
is not going anywhere.  We probably need to revisit our SCE exposures, 
including seeing whether we can get a better handle on what we may have 
running through the PX and ISO and any update on the "commandeered" contract 
(under which, I presume, we are still obligated to sell to CDWR (if I 
remember correctly the chain of events)). Also, we probably need to start 
thinking about extending the standstill letter with PG&E and dealing with 
renewing the LOCs on the EPMI power termination payment liability?  I have 
not heard anything on the PG&E front in this respect this week in terms of 
whether any further "settlement" talks have taken place.  Give me a call 
whenever you come up for air.  John

Ben:


Can I get in touch with one of your senior bankruptcy people in Los
Angeles?   We need to begin to acquant ourselves with one of your
partners there (I assume they would file in Los Angeles).  It would
appear to me that Edison will file shortly.    I want to assure that we
have a shot at the committee there.

Elizabeth, we issued late on Friday (as invoice date was May 20 (Sunday) and 
it was a long weekend) here the April invoices which were hand marked either 
April 1-12 (pre-petition) and April 13-30 (post-petition).  A couple of 
questions:  (i) is there anything more we need to do with these invoices, 
particularly to recover post-petition receivables?  (ii) do we need to send 
copies of the invoices to you or anyone else?

Peter.

What many of you have probably sensed was going to happen has now officially 
been confirmed: As of June 11,  Steve Hall will be changing his status from  
full time Enron-dedicated outside counsel to  full time Enron employee , 
reporting to Elizabeth Sager in Houston. 

 Coming as it does, at a time when trading legal expertise is much in demand 
in the market, this is a very positive event.  Our team will no doubt 
continue to benefit from Steve's significant contributions.  ---cgy

Fortunately, EPMI was a net debtor to the ISO for February, so we were not 
directly affected by this default.---sch

FYI and further to my vmail this afternoon -- Here are 3 proposals that 
Fairley sent to Reliant last week.  It's very likely that at least one of 
these will be concluded this week (Joe Wagner warned me just now that our 
prices are very close).

Nils,

We have kept our heat rates constant but changed the MW capacity in the 
summer and shoulders.  This shouldn't affect the $/kw-mo bid or offer so 
nothing has really changed except for the MW.  In answer to your question on 
the turbines.  They were 7B combustion turbines but have been upgraded, 
refurbished and all over rebuilt into a GE 7E equivalent.  I have attached 
your previous proposal with the new capacity schedules for your review.  
Let's revisit our numbers today and see where we stand on the bid/offer 
spread.    Also, if you could send over that tolling language for our review 
as soon as you are finished with it, I would appreciate it.  Thank you for 
working on that all day yesterday.  I will call you later today.

-Joe

Elizabeth - I just wanted to remind you that I have another Ontario standard 
contract meeting tomorrow.  If you do have a chance to either send me an 
email or give me a call with some more info on why it is a physical market it 
would be greatly appreciated.  Attached is a short slide presentation that 
was made at the last meeting regarding how the market settles.

I talked with Jim Steffes about the article below.  He stated that the PA 
company most at risk for a California type problem is GPU because it has 
divested its generation and will be in the market more.  (Maybe this creates 
an opportunity for EPMI selling a hedge product to GPU?)

Tom Chapman--Do you have additional info or insights on this?  Thanks.

Today's Electric Power daily discusses that due to high wholesale power 
prices, many PA customers are switching back to their utility that has capped 
prices.  Does this create the potential for a California situation with the 
utilities in PA?  I put in a call to Jim S too.  Thanks for your help.

Melissa  --  The attachment has modified language in response to your 
communication that EOL confirmations (and to a lesser extent, OTC 
confirmations) could not readily be issued confining this language to trades 
flowing on or after 1/1/03.  Accordingly, please have the revised text placed 
into confirmations with energy deliveries to occur at the "NEPOOL PTF" 
Delivery Point.  --David

Dana -- Attached is a draft confirmation template with text inserted in the

Dan Alleghretti worked with me to put this together, and believes that 
multi-settlement would not be implemented before 1/1/03.  The text is 
intended to balance Buyer's and Seller's intersests so that it can be placed 
in confirmations where EPMI is Buyer or Seller.  Please come back to me your 
comments or I will stop by your desk with a hard copy later this morning so 
that we can discuss.  --David

		 Subject: New language needed for Nepool trades

Hello, Dana Davis (Vice President of trading) just informed me of some new 
language that needs to be added to our confirmation letters for deals done at 
NEPOOL PTF (this is the delivery point).  The language he gave me is as 
follows:

In the event that multi settlement is implemented then NEPOOL PTF becomes 
seller's choice. (I am sure this needs to be worded differently)

I told Dana that I would have to run this language through one of the 
attorneys.  He said they could call him and he would explain further.

He also wants this language added to the NEPOOL PTF product on Enron Online 
(this would not be for NEPOOL ICAP deals, installed capacity).

I copied Marcus on this e-mail but I am not certain if he would be the 
correct person to work on this or not.  Dana would like to start adding this 
language as soon as possible.

Thanks,
Melissa

Effective today, there is a new legal review procedure for physical power 
contracts that are individually negotiated, with a term longer than one 
year.  Please notify me (Janette will maintain a list of contracts, 
counterparties and status) when drafting starts on such power contracts and 
provide me with a draft with sufficient time to make comments prior to 
closing.  My objective is to insure a consistent approach on these power 
contracts.  Thanks for your cooperation in this matter.  Please forward this 
memo on to the lawyers on your team.

Mike- 

As discussed, attached please find the agreement we currently use to document 
physical power transactions. It is the EEI Master Power Purchase and Sale 
Agreement and is comprised of boiler plate language  (see "EEI Master (6) 
4-25-00") and a Cover Sheet where the relevant elections are made (see "EEI 
Master CS with Prior Transactions"). 

For your purposes, please look at Article 8 in the boilerplate as it sets 
forth the language regarding collateral requirements. I think you will be 
most interested in Articles 8.1(c) and 8.2 (c).  Then, in the Cover Sheet, 
look on p. 2 under Article 8. This is where the relevant threshold numbers, 
etc... are inserted. 

Please call me if you have any questions - I will be happy to help guide you 
through it.   

Kind regards,

Shari Stack

For purposes of going forward, attached are the various drafts relating to 
ERCOT product changes we have been discussing:

1.  Re 11:00 am scheduling deadline.   This effort was sidelined because (i) 
it would fix the problem that surfaced with TXU, and (ii) in most instances I 
understand us to prefer the presence of the 11:00 am deadline to cuase the 
sheduling to be wrapped up under potential threat of LDs. 
  

2.  EOL financially firm UB product.  Doug, I believe you want to explore if 
the reference to the B product can be eliminated altogether.



3.  ERCOT wide and Zonal EOL products.  Questions clearly present are: (1) 
uncertain duration of the zones, and what should happen to the commitments of 
the parties when newly defined zones replace the old. The marketplace can't 
even be assured of zonal changeovers each October.  (Buyer serving load is 
most at risk)  (2)  uncertainty over whether the B product classification 
will persist, and what the Opertating guides will say about it or a 
subsequent Firm (LD) product, (3) whether delivery can only take place inside 
a zone, rather than at its border.   Doug you said you were considering 
rolling out an ERCOT wide product and then afterwards offering North and 
South Zones, followed by West Zone if there's market interest. 

 

Please come back to me with any thoughts you have on these draft efforts.

THE BUDDHA SAYS that we take wisdom where we find it. Perhaps the Buddha does 
not say that, but it's not a bad idea anyway. The Buddha would have said it, 
maybe, had he not been saying the other things. 
Our enemies can teach us lessons. Our adversaries can make us stronger. They 
can be consumed with greed and contempt, their very breath can be toxic, and 
yet their actions can open upward-flowing paths. 
Take Enron, the energy company, or Chevron, another energy company, or El 
Paso Natural Gas, yet another energy company. These organizations are the 
minions of Satan. They pillage and they profit. They are in the ascendant. 
Their enemies fall before them like cordwood. Ordinary citizens cower and 
meekly hand over tribute. 
And yet we thank them. We send our investigators after them and we pray that 
their executives land in jail, but we thank them. They have shown us the 
nature of our enslavement. They have defined the nature of our sloth. 
We have believed the Big Lie. We have believed in the free lunch. We have 
trusted those who would pander to us. We have eaten energy in great dripping 
gobs. Did we know it was not infinitely renewable? Oh yes. Did we understand 
that energy companies could create "shortages" whenever they wanted merely by 
closing plants for "maintenance"? You bet we did. And did we confuse the 
energy companies with charitable organizations and/or alchemists able to 
repeal the laws of nature? We did not. 
But it was more convenient to forget those things, and so we did. We have 
busy lives. We must do the things we must do. The infrastructure is 
everywhere crumbling, and we are patching it up ourselves. We are paying 
bureaucrats with taxes, but the bureaucrats are inadequate, so now the spirit 
of volunteerism is much praised. 
Volunteers are people who do jobs that other people are being paid to do but 
don't. 
AND SOMEHOW, EVEN in a society as relentlessly materialistic as this one, we 
forgot about our own checking accounts. Already seduced by the idea that 
credit card debt is good clean fun, we decided to waste a lot of money using 
energy we didn't need. 
I'm not talking about using a washing machine instead of going down to the 
river and beating your clothes with small stones -- I'm talking about washing 
machines with quarter-full loads and settings far too powerful for the task 
at hand. Right? Lights burning in unoccupied rooms. Appliances plugged in but 
never used. 
We pay for it. We send our wonderful money straight to the largest villains 
in American commerce because we are too stupid to do anything else. You 
wonder why they have contempt for us. You wonder why Dick Cheney believes he 
can fool all of the people all of the time. Because he has. 
Look: Last week the secretary of commerce suggested means-testing Social 
Security -- that is, means-testing a pension plan. You gave us the money, we 
kept it for 40 years, now -- prove that you need it! 
Why did he suggest that? Because he can! Why did PG&E demand additional 
compensation for its executives, who are moral dimbulbs and social criminals 
under any fair definition? Because they can get away with it! They will get 
away with it! You watch! 
I AM NOT saying that we have no one to blame but ourselves. There are active 
villains, and there are people who allow villainy to occur. Everyone in a 
corrupt system is corrupt. The fools are the ones who don't end up with any 
extra money. 
We are the fools. If we understand our foolishness, we begin to be wise. We 
send lovely bread-and-butter notes to Enron -- once we were blind, but now we 
see. And we await developments, or create them. 

It would be foolish to mention SUVs. When the brain is ready, the ear will 
hear.

We continue to receive a number of notices of motions, which my assistant has 
been sending to Jeff.  We have received a number more.  Should I continue to 
send to Jeff or to Richard or just discard them.  My concern is to ensure 
that we have notice of these proceedings and attend where appropriate.  If 
you are comfortable that you receive notice of proceedings affecting Enron 
generally, I would just discard what I receive here.  If it is possible that 
ECC is receiving notices in Calgary that are not going to Houston, I should 
fax them down to you as I receive them.

Peter.

I really don't want to beat this to death, but I'm afraid I don't know how to 
be more precise than this note, sent to you a month ago.  I didn't leave you 
a voicemail about this at the time b/c we were already leaving each other 
lots of voicemails about various deals and I didn't want the details, dates, 
etc. to get lost.  Since 1996 when I came to Enron, I've only stayed with my 
family during the holidays once -- because of year-end deals.  And last 
Thanksgiving, I spent the whole day on the telephone and flew out to 
Singapore the day after Thanksgiving to close the SK Korea deal.  I know what 
4Q is like around here, and I would never have asked except for the 
extraordinary occasion.  I'm sorry, but I just don't think that we're 
connecting and I don't know how to improve the quality of our communications.

Haven't heard about coordinating schedules for the group yet, and I know 
there might be some uncertainty just now b/c of the reorgs, but I'd like to 
know if the following is ok with you.  
Thanksgiving:  I'd like to go to my daughter's baby shower in VA on Sat. 
11/18, take my computer, and then work from VA on Mon, Tue, Wed -- rather 
than flying back here on Monday and flying back there again on Wed.  That's 
assuming there isn't a deal that needs me to go to meetings in Houston (or 
Singapore, for that matter) during that week.  
Christmas:  I'd like to use all remaining vacation days from 2000 after 
Christmas and not return til after mid January or after my grandson is born 
(his due date is 1/3/01), assuming I've used pretty much all vacation for 
2001at that point. 
Travel plans need to be made pretty soon, as you know, so the sooner I get 
your decision the better.  Thanks very much.

Subject: 

In light of the transition of the risk books to ENA, I need your input on 
whether we (EES) should continue to pursue our own master contracts with new 
trading partners.  In certain instances, ENA already has a master in place 
with the counterparty or in other instances (TransCanada Energy Marketing 
USA, Inc. & Aquila Energy Marketing Corporation), ENA Legal is currently 
negotiating a separate master with the counterparty.

The Gas Desk is pressing hard for a number of new masters with additional 
counterparties.  While we are set up to handle their requests, in light of 
the organization changes, it seems this may be unnecessary.  Even where ENA 
does not currently have or is not currently negotiating a master, they may 
prefer that the document be handled by ENA legal and avoid having to assign 
the master to them at a later date.    I would like to have your thoughts 
before I commit resources to handle these requests.

If you prefer that we continue to pursue these new master, we have the 
resources available to proceed.

 Jim

Happiness is looking at the new legal org chart (which Jan just now dropped 
on my desk).   I always approach these dry documents as though they were 
trigrams resulting  from throwing the coins and consulting the I-Ching.   At 
the top of the trigram which I find myself listed in I see a single name:  
Elizabeth Sager,  and at the bottom I see the name Genia FitzGerald.  The 
name at the top signifies all is well in the heavens and the name at the 
bottom signifies all is well on earth, and my name between the two means all 
is well beside the flowing river.  A new star has ascended into  the vault of 
the heavens above me and my most beloved of long standing friends from the 
trenches is steadfastly walking beside me below,  and all is very very 
blissful indeed for the itinerant, journeyman energy attorney.

To the Casino I say:   throw anything you've got at me and be damned!

All of you have expressed an interest in having a collateral annex to use 
with the EEI Master Contract.  A small group began working on an annex last 
winter.  Bill McCoy from Morgan Stanley circulated a "conceptual" draft which 
was commented on by a few companies.  Due to the intervening California 
market crisis, the group did not undertake further work.  After our credit 
workshop in Atlanta in March, many of you have asked to bring the working 
group together in order to reach closure on the annex.    As a starting, 
point I've attached Bill McCoy's draft and the comments circulated to date.  
I suggest that we develop a strawman from these documents that would serve as 
the basis for a consensus document adopted at a drafting meeting during the 
summer.  Before that meeting we could collaborate via email and conference 
calls.  Reliant has agreed to host a meeting in July which would coincide 
with a meeting  of the EEI contract drafting committee.  No specific date has 
been set, but many in the drafting committee are leaning towards meeting 
after mid-July.     Please use the attached calendar to show dates you would 
be unavailable in July so we can set a date.  Please fax this to Patricia 
Young at 202-508-5673 or email to pyoung@eei.org

So, we are looking for people who are willing to roll up their sleeves and 
get the job done.  We need the following to do this efficiently:  (1) someone 
to chair the group; (2) people willing to draft language; (3) someone to act 
as "scribe" to maintain the working draft and incorporate comments; and (4) 
input on what is drafted.  I propose holding a conference call next Friday to 
select a chair, set a schedule, and make assignments.  Please let me know 
your thoughts on this process.

This is still very much a work in progress, but this is where things stand 
tonight.  The Atlantic City Electric EEI Master was executed this afternoon 
(and the Enron Corp. guarantee is completely negotiated, too) so that we can 
actually get all signed up w/ a confirm if we win the 300MW bid on Friday, so 
it's no longer on the list.
Let me know if you'd like to discuss any of this.  I'm planning to leave all 
the files in my office when I go, and to update the power contracts database 
w/ comments about outstanding issues as one of the last things I do next week 
before I go.
Regards,
Janice

Pursuant to the various discussions over the past few days, attached please 
find the following documents which have been blacklined to show the 
revisions: 
1. EEI Cover Sheet: 

a. I have made most of the changes suggested in Gayle's fax of 11/29 except 
that the definition of Performance Assurance needs to stay as it is given 
that it does not only mean the Escrowed Funds (for instance, in the event of 
Downgrade Event with respect to Enron Corp., EPMI would have to post 
Performance Assurance). We have also not amended the last line of Section 5.5 
since, among other things, the two amendments taken together would mean that 
in the event of a dispute, the Non-Defaulting Party would be limited to 
receiving only what is in the Escrow Fund. First, that would not work if we 
were the Defaulting Party and secondly, we believe that the Non-Defaulting 
Party should receive an amount equal to the Termination Payment. 

Also, with respect to Section 5.5, Tracy Ngo was willing to extend the 
Defaulting Party's response time from two days to five days, but not all the 
way out to ten days.     

b. Pages 1-2 still need to have information filled in by Black Hills.

2. Confirmation: I have incorporated the modifications John suggested 
regarding Black Hills supplying Energy from an alternative source. I have 
also made a few minor typographical changes. In addition, the Confirmation 
contains revised Escrow language which reflects the recent discussions 
between Richard, Tracy and John. 

I will be happy to incorporate the Escrow language in the La Salle Bank 
Escrow Agreement once someone from Black Hills lets me know that the Escrow 
language is acceptable as written. 

Thank you,

I am just again following up as to what we should do with these partially 
paid invoices.  I would want to be careful that we do not set a precedent for 
accepting less than full payment.  Peter.

Hi Peter

Pacific Gas and Electric paid us for gas purchases on May 25 for April 
production.
They paid amounts larger than the post bankruptcy invoice totals. 


Here are the details:

1. Pre Bankruptcy invoice for April 1-12 deliveries.

  4136SA   852,780.50 US

  Payment Rec'd  458,687.37 US

 It appears that they paid 53.787% of the pre bankruptcy invoice.


2. Pre Bankruptcy invoices for April 1-12 deliveries

  4120SA   2,033,749.68 CDN
  4138SA   2,797,179.00 CDN
     ------------------
  Subtotal  4,830,928.68 CDN

 Post Bankruptcy invoices for Apr 13-30 deliveries

  4139SA   3,425,804.71 CDN


 Total all sales for April production

     8,256,733.39 CDN

  Payment Rec'd  6,024,238.66 CDN


 It appears that they paid 53.787% of the pre bankruptcy invoice.


Please let me know what you want me to do with the excess payment.
Thanks
Cheryl

The 3 FERC staffers will be at Dynegy next Tues to observe power and gas 
traders starting at 7 am.  They will then have a presentation from Dynegy's 
online platform person (like our Dave). 

While at Enron Monday afternoon, we will probably have them sit with both 
Kevin (power) and Phillip (gas) after Dave's presentation.

Rollin', rollin', rollin',
Though the state is golden,
Keep them blackouts rollin', statewide. A little colder weather,
And we all freeze together,
Wishin' more plants were on the line.
All the things I'm missin',
Like lights and television,
Are waiting 'til we can pay the price.

Turn 'em on, turn 'em off,
Shut 'em down, block 'em out,
Turn 'em on, turn 'em off, statewide!
Brown 'em out, black 'em out,
Charge 'em more, give 'em less,
Let the pols fix the mess, statewide!

Keep movin', movin', movin',
Though they're disapprovin',
Keep them rates a-movin', statewide.
Don't try to understand 'em,
Just raise, charge, and collect 'em.
Soon we'll be livin' high and wide.
My heart's calculatin',
Nuclear plants will be awaitin',
Be waitin' at the end of my ride.

I personally don't want the 10th, we are supposed to leave for vacation on 
the 11th of August.  Do you think having the meetings on the 8th and 9th 
would be a problem for those attending the WSPP meeting.  Perhaps, we could 
do the Collateral Annex meeting on 9th if Drafting Committee members 
attending the WSPP meeting need to travel that day.

>>> <Elizabeth.Sager@enron.com> 06/05/01 15:25 PM >>>

Hi Andy

 I would not be able to make the meetings during the week of July 23rd but
Carol could on the collateral annex. The WSPP is holding its meeting on
August 10th so that also may not be the best time for people, but again
Carol could likely attend the collateral annex meeting.  Hope all is well.
And as always thanks for your help.

Bill and Tracy,

Elizabeth, Shari and I  have gone over the three part exposure reducing trade 
idea together internally, and are going to review it with our outside 
counsel, Ken Raisler, before giving you our definitive comments on the merits 
or demerits of the proposed structure.  Unfortunately Ken is out until Monday 
and unavailable by phone.  If all goes well Monday,  we will have something 
to you by the end of the day or maybe on Tuesday. ----cgy

Aha!  Craig Johnstone (rather than Greg Johnston), who is a rather 
ineffectual sort from a local firm Thackray Burgess and who used to do some 
Masters and confirms for us a few years back on a seconded (or more 
accurately an Enron funded sabbatical) basis in the Mary Lee Hopkins days. 
(Lavo knows him well.  In fact Lavo once instructed me to keep hiring lawyers 
until Craig Johnstone ceased showing up here.)  Our Greg is constantly 
getting confused with him, which I really quite enjoy.  Regards, Peter.

Ms. Sager:
I'm trying to find out more about Enron's memory  chip futures--specifically 
I'd like to see if I could publish a standard  contract for the instruments.? 
A search of Enron's website did not yield  anything (though probably I don't 
know how to search the site).? Neither  could I find any corporate site for 
Kenneth Wang, listed as director of your  Global Semiconductor Group.? Any 
help you could give me in this regard  would be appreciated.
?
Thanks,

I attach a draft dated 5/10/01 of a Two Way Cash and Letter of Credit Form of 
Credit Support Annex to be used with EEI Masters.  Because the Draft Annex is 
based on the form  used by the Swap Group, I have also attached a version 
marked to show changes from the Swap Group's form.

While preparing this I also reviewed the Credit Annex draft prepared by 
Morgan Stanley and Shari Stack's comments on it.  Unlike the MS draft, mine 
doesn't contemplate any kinds of collateral other than cash and letters of 
credit (which is what EAS wanted, I believe.)  In addition, Shari had posed 
the question of whether any defaults under the Credit Annex itself should be 
made Events of Default under the Master Agreement.  Although my initial 
reaction is that we should not add any such additional defaults under the 
Credit Annex as Events of Default, please think about this question as you 
review the draft.

I look forward to your comments.
Janet

Elizabeth,

I understand from speaking with Genia that you have approved a baby shower 
for Leslie to be charged to your Cost Center number.  Leslie has chosen a 
tentative date of December 14th (or possibly the 13th, depending on 
conference room availability).  

Linda and I just finished organizing Stacy's shower at an approximate cost of 
$430 (breakdown as follows:  invitations $40, plates, tablecloths, 
decorations $40, cake $50, lunch from Vespucci's $300).  

Please let me know if this same estimate will be okay for Leslie's shower. 

Thanks!

Elizabeth,
My name is John Forney and I am the new Electricity  Cash trader in the 
Entergy region,  reporting to Kevin Presto.         I received a letter 
agreement from Entergy that seeks to clarify the Entergy  "Into"  
definition.   Rogers Herndon has relayed that we have tried to get them to 
transact under an EEI agreement,  where they have been willing to only 
operate under WSPP.    They are trying to get us to agree to use the WSPP 
contract with EEI  liquidated damages language.
I need to meet with you on this issue.   Rogers is available to anwer 
questions on the background of this ,   if necessary.


Thanks,
JMF

Great memo!

Just a couple of notes.

B 1 (b):  I think the master gas contract form includes Affiliates on 
non-defaulting party side--see end of Article 4.

If a Triggering Event occurs, the Notifying Party may (at its election) set 
off any or all amounts which the Affected Party owes to the Notifying Party 
or its Affiliates (under this Agreement or otherwise) against any or all 
amounts which the Notifying Party owes to the Affected Party (either under 
this Agreement or otherwise).

B 2 (f):  The analysis is based upon Enron default.  If counterparty default 
analysis is used, Enron benefits; and don't all contracts at least have all 
transactions terminating if bankruptcy is the triggering event?


Cordially,

Dear Elizabeth:

Thank you for accepting our invitation to speak at the Energy and Developing
Porducts conference in Houston on March 6th, 2001 at The Four Seasons Hotel.


I will need to finalize the agenda by next week in order to begin promoting
the conference.  For marketing purposes, all I need at this stage is a

contents of the discussion.

Also, we would welcome any suggestions you may have on inviting speakers to
help you discuss topic.

I will be in the office all week and can be reached at 212-332-2559 or let

Elizabeth,

Who will be taking over Janice's negotiations with VEPCO?  Their attorney, 
Shelley, called and wanted the new Enron attorney to give her a call.  Her 
number is 804-273-4149.  I apologize that I received this call this morning, 
but am not getting to you until now.

Elizabeth/Christi

The following is an e-mail I recieved from Wabash with regard to them looking 
at risk associated with a "Into" product and their concern over the RTO 
forcing the designation of firm point resources.

I thought you would like to see this in conjunction with our last 
conversation.

thanks

Oscar

Subject: Network Resource Requirements

Mr. Dalton,

As we have discussed, the control area operators we coordinate with in the
NIPSCo, AEP, IPL, and Cinergy areas are increasingly concerned about the
reliability of transmission and its dependence on expected power flows from
source to sink.  Much of this concern comes from incremental reliability
requirements being developed by ECAR and NERC, along with potentially
substantial fines for failure to comply.  In order for Wabash Valley to
obtain Network Transmission service we must have firm resources that can be
qualified as designated network resources.

We received a document from a control-area operator that defines their
criteria for network resources.  These criteria are defined as follows:

* Network resources do not include any generation that is committed
for sale to another party on a firm basis.

* For a  power purchase to qualify as a network resource it must be
available to the purchaser on a non-interruptible basis.  Power purchases
that can be interrupted by the seller for reliability reasons qualify as
network resources.  This includes power sales that are provided with a
curtailment priority below that of the seller's native load.  Purchased
power that can be interrupted by the seller for economic reasons does not
qualify as a network resource, but purchases that can be interrupted for
extreme economic penalties other than more economic sale or purchase
opportunities qualify as network resources.

* For a power purchase to qualify as a network resource, the purchaser
must have an obligation to take the power.  The obligation to purchase does
not need to be in the form of a capacity payment.  However, if there is no
capacity payment, the contract should include a minimum take obligation.
The Commission does not require an around-the-clock purchase obligation; it
has approved as a network resource a power purchase with a minimum capacity
factor of 80% during on-peak hours and no minimum take in off-peak hours.
How much lower a capacity factor the Commission would permit is not clear.

* The requirement that a network resource be non-interruptible applies
to the transmission service as well as the power supply itself.  Therefore,
a network customer that designates an off-system resource as a network
resource must obtain firm transmission service for the generator to the
system of the network transmission provider.  If transmission from the
generator to the network transmission provider is non-firm transmission
service, the power purchase does not qualify as a network resource.
However, the requirement of firm transmission service does not apply to any
generator that was serving the load on July 9, 1996, because such generation
is grandfathered by Order No. 888.

It may be that your organization can meet these criteria with documentation
of resources and transmission path agreements, so as to not require any
additional "firmness" of the power supply you have already proposed to us.
Please take a look, and contact me with any further information you can
provide.

Let me know, also, if you need any else from me.

Dear Mark and Liz::

I'm going to be in NYC for a mid-day meeting on 12/14  and was hoping to meet 
later with someone at ISDA to discuss how they operate.  I know you are both 
active in ISDA and was hoping you could help me set up a meeting with the 
right person(s).  Please let me know if you can help.

The reason for the request is that  I am in the information gathering stage 
of developing a business plan to establish a membership organization to 
manage the EEI contract  process.  Once my plan is fleshed out, I would like 
to come down to Houston and make a presentation to the participating members 
of the EEI-NEM contract group to get their reaction.

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being 
offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. 
Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an 
exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, 
will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

Can you pass this along to Elizabeth to ensure Sanders is on board as well?  
We are renewing our L/C's on a month to month basis for the PX per Sanders.  
However, the request below is to "replenish" the CASH that was drawn 
down...please advise.

Tracy,  Do we have concerns here.  We pointed out to the PX that there was 
excess credit.  By using collateral to pay these bills are we not keeping 
required levels available?

Wendy:


Bill may have already asked, but can we get the balances for the ISO/PX 
amounts we are showing?  PG&E has asked for the balances and the application 
of partial payments to reconcile against their records and the ISO/PX records 
which they have requested through the Bankruptcy court.    We need to review 
this with Lisa Mellencamp & Liz Sager prior to sending.


Thanks,


Michael

Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary="------------E36A7CD4CD12DC11F94F8638"

Andy,  As discussed, heer is MSDW's proposal for a draft version of a
Collateral Annex that can be used in connection with the EEI Agreement
(it would be advisable for a clause to be included in the EEI cover
sheet incorporating the collateral annex by reference).  We are offering
this draft as a starting point for the industry's efforts to develop an
EEI Collateral Annex.  Please feel free to distribute it and let Ed or
me know if you would like to have a conference call with others to
determine the next steps in getting feedback.  Bill McCoy

I will not be available after 7:00 pm tonight - I have a rare date with my 
wife at the U2 concert which could lead to a marital Early Termination Event 
if I default.  I will have my cell 403.819.5528, if you want to try and reach 
me or "bootleg" some tunes.  Peter.

Michael, how can we get with PG&E to determine where the discrepancy lies?

Subject: PX credits & Schedule F in the PG&E bankruptcy

PG&E filed their Schedule F which displays its nonpriority unsecured claims.  
Many of the claims were listed as unknown in amount.  The PX credit amounts 
were listed as disputed.   Two PX credit amounts were specified in the 
Schedule F:

Enron Energy Marketing      $201,964,905.64
Enron Energy Services       $ 19,737,979.97
Total disclosed PX credit   $221,702,885.61

Note that in the claims that were listed as unknown in amount, none were 
described as PX Credit in nature. 

Two points to be made: 1) this information is now public (but on page 5,066 
of 17,096 on a CD), along with $53,985,167 in other Enron related claims, and 
2) our calculation of the PX credit was $392,416,534 at the beginning of May.

Regards,


Michael

Attached is a draft of the reply brief.  I will continue to edit and
tighten it up, but I wanted to get it to you in ordre to give you some,
albiet limited, time to review.  We need to have it filed by 5:00pm EST
tomorrow, and need to have it on the fax to Jane Parver by 4:00 pm EST.
Pullman & Comley in Conn. will need some time to convert it to their
system, so if there is any way you could try to get  comments to me by noon
tomorrow, I'd greatly appreciate it.

I think we have a shot and feel much better about our chances than I did
upon initially reviewing the Trustee's brief.  Although well written, the
Trustee truly mischaracterizes a number of cases and loses a lot of
credibility.

Thanks.

We are renewing our L/C's on a month to month basis for the PX per Sanders.  
However, the request below is to "replenish" the CASH that was drawn

Tracy,  Do we have concerns here.  We pointed out to the PX that there was

It looks like Friday afternoon will be the only day i can do the meeting this

call them, can you give me an updated list of issues we want to discuss and 
who we would like for them have in attendance.  Also, if any documents have 
changed hands since our last meeting that have changed any status, please let

Phil's birthday is the 21st, so I was thinking that I might want to have a 
birthday type dinner for him this Saturday.  Some place relatively casual but 
good food (I obviously have put a lot of thought into this).  I was thinking 
about dinner around 7:30.  Are you and Grant interested in joining us?  Julie 
is babysitting for us.  I am going to see if she can come over around 3 so 
Phil and I can also finish our Christmas shopping.  S.

I am working with Sarah to put into place an LC reimbursement facility which, 
among other things, will allow for the placement of lcs to support trading 
activities. I wanted to find out what requirements you were faced with in 
placing lcs -- prescribed forms of the lcs and timing in particular (i.e.,

Gary,

In preparation for the Outlook migration, we have come up with the basic 
structure of the public folders needed for EWS Legal.  The initial access to 
create and/or rename folders should be given to the users identified next to 
the group and/or subgroup (i.e. for Enron Global Markets - grant access to 
Alan Aronowitz and Nita Garcia).   Upon completion of the migration, the 
assistant assigned to each of these groups will procure access to others in 
her group and create additional folders as they may be needed.

Please let us know if you have any questions regarding the attached 
information.

Thanks.

Janette Elbertson and Nony Flores

Oscar
 
Attached is the latest draft with my comments and additional drafting. We 
need to be certain that Kevin Presto is clear as to the Products and the 
risks that we will be taking going forward.

In addition, as we discussed with Consumers this morning, from a scheduling 
perspective, we need to be comfortable that the time limits will be as per 
Eastern Prevailing Time and not Central Prevailing Time. If we are, then we 
need to change the Into Cinergy definition in EEI to address this.
 
As part of managing this process, as you know my wife is expecting our first 
child and with the due date having been passed I am on "baby alert" which 
could mean me leaving at any minute. I have therefore started to copy 
Elizabeth Sager on the negotiations and she, or another member of the team 
will be in a position to start running with this, in the event that it is not 
signed before I leave.
 
Regards,
 
Marcus

Dear Bart

As per my VM, attached please find the Escrow Agreement which the Escrow 
Agent, La Salle Bank, would like to use. Could you please review this for us 
and let us know your thoughts?

I am also attaching a description of the Escrow procedures that we have 
tentatively agreed with our counterpart. Those will need to be incorporated 
in the Escrow Agreement. I can do that but I thought you might be interested 
to have the "full picture".

Please call me when you get a chance and I can more fully explain our role in 
the escrow ararngement. 

Thank you,

Mark LoIacono requested that I send you my model escrow agreement.
Although it is prepared as a "one-size-fits-all" agreement, please feel
free to revise it to fit the purposes of your proposed escrow.  In addition
to being in-house counsel for LaSalle Bank's Corporate Trust Services
Division, I also manage the Escrow Business Unit.  If you have any
questions, please contact me directly.

Thank you for providing LaSalle Bank with this opportunity.

Just making sure that you all were still planning on coming by and walking 
around Lights in the Heights with us on Saturday.  We'll have some snacks and 
toddies (sp? and I'm not looking it up) ready around 5:30ish.  I have invited 
Gail to come also, maybe she can fit it her busy social schedule.

Word around here spread like wildfire about my leaving.  I told 3 partners 
before I left to go out of town last week and by the time I got back, even my 
secretary knew.  It was a bit awkward.  I wanted to personally tell her.  Oh 
well.

See you guys Saturday.

Leslie --Stuart Zisman is working to finalize a Purchase and Sale Agreement 
("P&SA") as to the New Albany plant and is trying to be fully informed  as to 
outstanding contracts in relation to the plant known to the legal's power 
trading group.  He will meet with a large group on this project at 11 a.m. 
this morning.  On information from the midmarket group, I have confirmed to 
him there are no trading contracts currently in effect, committing sales 
from  the plant.  He is also inquiring about a 'Station Service Agreement' or 
any other basic agreement(s) in effect  allowing the plant's operation 
(beyond those referenced in the P&SA --see Schedules 4.1(m) and 7.1 --I'll 
bring you a copy of these Schedules).   As you may have been involved when 
such contracts would have been negotiated or placed in effect, would you give 
Stuart any information you have on this at your soonest opportunity?  Thanks.

Subject: Re: FW: optout language for TVA  

Elizabeth -- Three comments to consider:

In the first change, I think that I understand your change, but my impression 
was that "provided for in this Confirmation" was referring or tieing 
specifically to the "deal" defined in the Confirmation, therefore the change 
to say "may be agreed to" seems to weaken that reference.

On the 10th line, does adding the word "firm" in front of energy potentially 
conflict with the specific transaction if it is something more or something 
different than a simple firm deal.  Shouldn't the level of firmness be fully 
defined elsewhere in the confirm.

In (b), suggest adding some reference to quantity after your reference to 
timing along these lines:  " (b)  the starting and ending time and date, and 
the quantity of the release or interruption;"     Since partial quantity 
releases are possible/likely, probably even successive releases (due to 
gradual weather changes)  it would be equally as important to identify 
quantity and timing.  Example:  start with 200 MW for the month, release 50 
MW starting day 10 for balance of month, then another 50 MW over a weekend.

As always, thanks for your assistance. -- David

but before we start using and drop in confirm I will need to see the rest of

Marcus,

Peter and Kevin's concern with the language you suggested is that NERC=20
holidays do not coincide with Federal Reserve banking holidays.  Martin=20
Luther King Day, Washington's Day, Columbus Day, and Veteran's Day are all=
=20
Federal banking holidays which are not NERC holidays.  Since they want the=
=20
power to be scheduled the day before delivery, the language defining busine=
ss=20
day as " a day on which Federal Reserve member banks in New York City are=
=20

Please feel free to contact either myself or Peter Makkai with any question=

Gary,

Attached you will find a November RT (Real Time)  Market Default Invoice 
which was receive by EPMI from the PX this morning.

This invoice was published on the PX Settlement Web Site.  Again, the PX 
failed to notify market participants that this invoice was out there.  
Normally they would send an email out and inform all market participants of 
it's availability.  If Market Participants don't know about this invoice 
being out there they will end up defaulting on their payments.  (That may be 
what the PX wants so they can go after the collateral.

If you have any questions please let me know.

Good luck today! - MO

contract.  I'll also forward a copy of the 3/27 draft which reflected some 
additional changes.  I'll check further but we really had nott reached 
closure on those additional items., although most of them were in CDWR's 
"favor."  Thanks  John

John:  Following up on your voice mail, attached are revised drafts of the 
Confirm and the Master Agreement.  Please note that, as you may recall, 
Elizabeth Sager is out of town today and I have not been able to catch up 
with her to get her views on the things set forth in your e-mail to me, or 
with Christian.  However, we had a brief conversation after our call 
yesterday about some of the points on your "list" and I have tried to 
generally work with what you have proposed on a few of the points in light of 
my conversations with Elizabeth and Christian.  Since I have to leave the 
office within an hour or so today, I thought I would forward some proposed 
language on some of the points for your consideration with the hope of 
expediting the process.  These drafts, therefore, are subject to Enron's 
review and comment.

Please call me if you wish to discuss.

John

For those written confirmations of EPMI's purchases in ERCOT which the ERCOT 
traders designate as  being supplied across a DC tie, I suggest this draft 
text insert, which is subject to review and approval by Doug Gilbert-Smith 
and Clint Dean before incorporation into specific confirmations which the 
traders indicate.    

"Transmission Contingent.  If Seller is unable to secure the transmission 
required for this Transaction on a DC tie line across the ERCOT system border 
("DC tie"),  or transmission on such DC tie is curtailed in a manner 
affecting Seller's delivery hereunder, then Seller at its election shall not 
be required to deliver the affected portion of the Energy and, in the event 
of that election by Seller, neither party shall be liable to the other 
hereunder for failure to deliver/receive such Energy." 

I will be attempting to confirm this treatment with Doug and Clint today if 
possible,  and I or one of them will confirm that this text is to be inserted 
in pertinent confirmations.

Ben, I'd appreciate anything you have about Enron's claims.  We've discussed 
it with the debtor and it does not contest the energy providers are the real 
parties in interest and don't contest they ought to be represented on the 
committee. As for a meeting, I can't promise I have time for that at this 
point.  I will give you a call Monday or Tuesday.  Thanks.

As I mentioned in the voicemail I left for you today, we will get something 
to you in writing on Tuesday regarding Enron's claims.  The "back of the 
envelope" estimate I am getting is in the $600 to $700 million range.  Would 
it be possible to meet with you sometime on Tuesday fro ten to fifteen 
minutes to explain Enron's claims to you?

Are you still there?

could you call me?

I urgently need to talk to someone in UST's office.  We represent Enron and 
heard a rumor that a committee will be formed this weekend.  The debtor's 
info regarding Enron's claim is not accurate, and we want the opportunity to 
show what we think the right number should be.

North Carolina Power Holdings, LLC is a wholly owned sub of ENA and owns some 
power plants in NC.  On March 26, 2001, NCPH sold a daily call option for May 
through Dec 2001 to Carolina Power & Light Co. in March, and promised to 
deliver an Enron Corp. guarantee.  But it hasn't been delivered yet, and the 
counterparty has asked about its status.  The guarantee is attached -- 
standard form, describing the transaction.  Would you please date it and have 
it executed early week of May 7 and have it delivered to Genia Fitzgerald for 
delivery to the counterparty (Genia, the file is on your chair -- Paul Radous 
has been in touch w/ CP&L on this recently).  If you have any questions, 
please call Steve Van Hooser ( EB3877, ext. 37238).  Thanks so much -- hope 
to be in touch soon.

This was sent to me by one of the developers.  I believe it relates to an 
expansion (or new interconnection) of the Caledonia facility.  I don't know 
which lawyer has been working on it, so I'm sending it around to see if 
anyone claims it. Chris thought that someone from Power Trading may have been 
working on it.

Jeanne,

Looks great.  I don't have any changes.

I like your characterization of the "bond cap" issue Pat and I mentioned this 
morning.  My bet is that, ultimately, this will drive the CPUC to increase 
the CPA.  Once the legislators figure out that the general fund will not be 
fully reimbursed if the bond issue is less than $10 billion, they will put 
pressure on the CPUC to make sure the CPA is as large as possible.

Steve

Folks,

It appears from the comment below that the NYISO does not intend to revise 
October's bill until February 2001.  This is a very signifigant issue for 
Enron.  Recall that the NYISO intentionally billed for October with the 
incorrect prices for the proxy busses even though the prices had been revised 
on the NYISO web site for some time prior to the bill.  The impact of this 
was that the NYISO withheld about $3,000,000.00 from Enron for October.  In 
addition they have not updated the November bill to reflect revised prices 
and the payment date is approaching.  When asked about this last month, the 
NYISO indicated that they knew they were billing incorrectly and would rebill 
later but that, according to the tarriff, market participants must settle 
there bills as posted.  I believe this to be a blatent abuse of the tarriff 
and that the NYISO is intentionally "leaning" on market participants for 
credit.  With year end approaching I believe that there is an emphasis on 
maximizing working capital which makes this even more critical (this point is 
highly confidential).

I believe that if they are not going to address this with the November bill 
than we should be taking the most aggressive response.  Should we put this in 
an intervention to the NYSEG filing regarding payments  to the NYISO or 
should we file separately with FERC requesting as a separate issue?  What 
would get the quickest response?  Can and should we consider legal action 
outright?

Howard,  can you approach the NYISO at highest levels ASAP with this issue 
and find out if there is any intention to address this?  So much for there 
efforts to gain credibility in the Marketplace.

Following Howards inquiry, I suggest that we meet by phone to determine our 
course of action.  We have very little time if we have any hope of confincing 
them of revising the bill with the November billing due around the 15th.

On a similar issue, NYISO is asking us to repay $4.6 million in TCC revenues 
from earlier this year.  I believe that they must revise prices in order for 
them to do this and that they are outside the window for revising prices.

Howard, can you arrange for Sara Shackleton and Shari Stack to get the TCC 
rules that were in effect prior to August as well as any rules around price 
revisions.

Thanks,
Tom.

Response:

Rebecca,
Due to a coding error in calculating ancillary reserves for the 25 hour day
(Oct. 29), hour 1 was not charged on the bill and was overwritten by hour 2 
data
and all remaining hours were shifted up one hour. This error is scheduled to 
be
fixed prior to the October rebill (tentatively scheduled for 2/01).

Dave Evanoski
518-356-6031

Question:
The hours in the Transactions LBMP section are not
agreeing with the hours in the Ancillary section.
It looks like SH01 for 126mw is missing from the
Ancillary settlement file for 10/29/00 and all other
hours are shifted up one hour.  I have attached
a file as support.

David,

As this document stands, it is okay.  With respect to the QSE agreement, we 
will need to reinstate the New Power Holding's MACs since a $1MM line of 
credit will be extended to them under that agreement.  Those MACs were 
eliminated from the EEI since Enron is not extending credit under that 
agreement.

David,
Attached below is a revised EEI cover for the EPMI Power agreement.  Bill 
Bradford and I agreed to the revisions that I incorporated.  Please touch 
base with Bill to obtain his concurrence with the revisions I made.  If the 
revisions are ok, let me know and I'll get the document signed and send you 
two signed originals for Enron signature.  Once the document is signed could 
you work with Mary Cook to incorporate this agreement in the Master 
Cross-Product Netting....Agreement.  I would appreciate anything you can do 
to  move this along as EES will no longer be trading power and NPW needs to 
establish a power trading relationship with EPMI.

As feared, the judge denied our motion to compel arbitration.  Liz said the
judge had read all the pleadings and the cases, and he seemed prepared to
rule before argument.  After listening to argument, the judge denied the
motion to compel arbitration because

--  12 other adversaries are pending dealing with similar issues
--  arbitration would interfere with efficient administration of the estate
--  a Discovery Mediator has been appointed to supervise cases
--  not convinced claims I and II are non-core proceedings
--  2 counts of the complaint would be left with him in any event
--  he has discretion.

Interestingly, from the bench, he did not rule that Claims I and II are
core matters, he simply stated that he was not convinced they were
non-core.  We have a right to an immediate appeal.  There are definitely
pros and cons to it.  I'd be happy to discuss them with you in person or do
an email for your consideration.  Let me know which way you'd like the
analysis.

We have only 10 days from the entry of the order to file a notice of
appeal.  I'm not certain whether the order denying the arbitration was
entered today, but if not, it probably will be entered tomorrow.   For
planning purposes, let's assume that our notice of appeal has to be filed
on December 22, which is next Friday.

Wish the results had gone the other way, but it's not over yet!

I do not know who has agreed tothe governance.  At meetings I have gone to 
and in inhouse e mails I have opposed the make up of the proposed Board  It 
lacks independence and has two transmission segments.

Because WIO will be deciding issues involving the primary congested paths in 
the West, I believe the issues to be resolved by WIO may be very important.  
Accordingly, I have argued in-house (to anyone who will listen) that we 
should be arguing that WIO should be independent.  I don't believe that it is 
independent, it's a stakeholder board, like California and the WSCC, both of 
which we have had problems with. 

Historically, a number of people have worked on WIO.  Tom worked on it for a 
while.  Recently, I think Marcie Milner has been monitoring the meetings.  I 
think Steve Walton and DIck Ingersoll may also be following WIO to some 
degree.  Also Jim has suggested to Alan that he might want to be following 
"seams" issues.  A while ago Marcie asked me to review the governance 
structure.  I told her that I didn't like the lack of independence and 
suggested that we oppose it.  Nonetheless, I believe I was told that we had 
already agreed to it.

Subject: Western Connection Interface (WIO)

Christian,

Earlier this week you asked me to review a stack of documents (proposals and 
draft bylaws) relating to the proposed Western Interconnection Organization.  

Conclusion:  Based upon a quick review of the draft proposal, bylaws, and 
other materials, I see no major objections to Enron voting for the formation 
of the WIO.   The reason to vote for this organization would be to facilitate 
the development of uniform reliability standards and efficient electric 
markets in the Western Interconnection.  However, you should carefully 
consider the fact that the board of directors will be weighted towards 
transmission owners (who will have 8 of the 27 votes).  Power marketers, 
generators, and load-serving entities will only have 4 votes.  14 directors 
establish a quorum and the board only requires a majority vote of directors 
present, so it is conceivable that, for example, 15 directors show up, 8 of 
which are transmission owners, and the transmission owners are able to pass 
any resoultion they wish.  Related to this issue is the inability of one 
membership group, such as the power marketer's group, to be able to veto a 
proposal.  It will take three membership classes acting in unison, plus two 
other votes, to defeat a proposed action by the board.  Unfortunately, 
because I am not personally familiar with the internal dynamics of the WSCC 
membership, I am unable to offer any indication of the how much of a risk 
this presents.  

       Background and Overview
In General:  The Western Interconnection Organization ("WIO") will be formed 
by consolidating the Western Regional Transmission Association, the 
Southwestern Regional Transmission Association, the Northwestern Regional 
Transmission Association, and the Western States Coordinating Council (WRTA, 
SWRTA, NRTA, and WSCC, respectively) into one organization.  The WIO, a 
non-profit corporation, will assume and perform the functions of these 
organizations, and, eventually, those organizations will be disbanded.

The principal responsibilities of the WIO will be as follows:

 *The WIO will be the primary authority for promulgating regional 
reliability, operating, and procedural standards.
 *The WIO will work to resolve conflicting regional reliability standards, 
and work to develop compatible and efficient practices throughout the Western 
Interconnection.
 *The WIO will have no authority over commercial practices (but may work to 
promote compatible, efficient markets).
 *Provide a process for resolving disputes arising out of WIO functions and 
between WIO members.

Membership:

Any entity meeting the criteria for membership in one of the following 
membership classes may be Member of the WIO.  There are five classes of 
membership:  (1) Business entities owning more than 1000 miles of 
transmission lines, (2) Business entities owning less than 1000 miles of 
transmission lines; (3) Business entities that do not own, control, or 
operate transmission or distribution lines, e.g., power marketers, 
load-serving entities, independent power producers; (4) End users of 
electricity; and (5) Representatives of States and Provinces in the Western 
Interconnection.

 *Each class elects four (4) directors.
 *All of the classes select seven (7) non-affiliated directors, for a total 
of twenty-seven (27) directors.
 
Quorum:  A majority of all members, including a majority in at least three 
classes.  In the case of directors, there must be 14 directors.

Board Decisions:  A board decision requires a majority of the directors 
present.

Standing Committees:  There are three standing committees:  the Planning 
Coordination Committee, the Operating Committee, and the Market Interface 
Committee.  

Committee Voting:  For purposes of voting on recommendations to the board, 
committees are divided into three classes:  (1) transmission providers, (2) 
transmission customers, and (3) States and Provincial Members (which is Class 
5). In order to make a recommendation to the board, there must be a simple 
majority of votes from the transmission provider and transmission customer 
classes.

Termination:  The WIO can be terminated upon a vote of the majority of the 
members.

Elizabeth, I am responding to your voice mail that today's meeting is 
canceled.  I agree with your suggestion that you, Mark, Jeff, Bill and Shari 
can come to a conclusion and just let us know.

I believe the issues come down to:

1. risk of intentional default by our counterparty

2. risk of unintentional default by us

3. what the market is doing

As agreed at our last call, I reviewed the issues commercially here, and I 
believe the commercial preference is to maintain cherry picking for the 
reasons in 1 above.  Please let Greg and mw know what is decided.

Elizabeth,

We are working on a settlement transaction which will leave a variety of
relationships in place with a group of financially troubled companies. We'd 
been
negotiating a netting agreement, and after you spoke to our group, it occurred
to us that we ought to take a look at your netting agreements for potential 
use
in our transaction. Could you please forward an example of one to me? We would
be netting with multiple parties on both sides, so it will be a "rectangular"
netting arrangement, if I recall your descriptive terminology correctly.

Thanks much.

Paul Puchot

Leonardo -  Please be aware that the Wheatland IL peaking facility which was 
to support this EOL capacity product is being sold  -- therefore EPMI no 
longer seeks to roll out this exact product.  The Power Desk will consider 
whether they want to proceed with some  variant of the online capacity 
product, and if so, will advise us.  Please contact me with any questions, 
and thanks for your help.  --David

Leonardo

I understand and share the desire for a simple website, but have several 
times indicated that these are not GTC terms, but tailored to this product 
offering (and any subsequent capacity products to be offered), and it is 
therefore legal's belief that they should appear within the website itself.  
Please keep me updated as to the progress on the product, as it occurs.  
Thanks.  David

David,

Sorry for not replying to your message before.  All of our resources are 
still focused on the next phase of EnronOnline, thus we have had to delay all 
new products and new  auctions  development. We should be ready to start 
working on your auction in a couple of weeks. 

I agree that we had discussed the "contract section" before however, when I 
passed it through David Forster he did not like the format (legal wording). 
The reason for this is that we like to keep a same format an all of 
EnronOnline's offerings. Would it be possible to move this section to the 
GTC? We can always refer the clauses to the contracts. We would like to keep 
the contract section a  easy-to-read as possible.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks again for your help!

__________________

Leonardo -- I had addressed this with you in a telephone conversation on 
7/18/00:  The provisions would be part of an individual confirmation for this

documents, rather than being verbatim repetitions.  Three attorneys in the 
legal group had collaboratied to identitfy these provisions as those 
necessarily appearing in the website text.  Please call me with any further

David,

Thanks for the text. I reviewed it and think that there is only one major 
issue outstanding:

Additional Contract Terms: The clauses of this section seem to be extracted 
directly from a contract. They look like they are verbatim from a legal 
document. As you all know, the idea of the website text is to inform and 
guide your customers through the whole process. We need to substitute the 
current clauses with easy to read highlights appropriate to the web page. We 
can always refer the clauses to the contracts. We would like to keep this 
section a  easy-to-read as possible. A good example of the "Contract Section" 
is the one used for the Emission Auctions.


Please review and let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Thank you very much for your help!

Marketers:

Christian and I are pleased to announce that we have developed a short-form 
standardized agreement for the Services Desk to use with its customers based 
outside of California that are producing unit-contingent energy, e.g., Geneva 
Steel, Potlatch, and Morrow Power.  



1.  You can use this short, pre-approved agreement for new generator 
customers for whom you intend to market unit-contingent energy on a daily 
basis.  If you want to buy firm energy from your customer, or do a term deal, 
then you will need to upgrade to an EEI Master Agreement or make other 
arrangements.

2.  You can send this agreement out to customers by simply asking Jan King 
(nicely) to change the names in the agreement to conform to your prospective 
customer, and then sending out the updated version.  As a matter of courtesy, 
copy Christian, Tracy, and me on the e-mail you send to the customer.

3.  Tracy says that as long as these agreements are for daily purchases of 
unit-contingent energy outside of California, she will not require credit 
information from the customer.  However, it is important that Tracy be kept 
in the loop on these deals.

4.  By clarifying the credit standards and providing an off-the-shelf 
agreement that you can send over, get signed, and then schedule power for the 
next day with, I believe we will be able to win more business by reducing the 
internal review time for this low-risk, high-margin business.

5.  We invite your suggestions to improve this agreement.  Jan will always 
have the most recent version.

6.  Our next project is to develop a similar agreement for California 
generators.


Regards, 

Steve

Attached is FERC authorization for EPMI and EES to purchase power from 
industrials NATIONWIDE (effective March 6, 2001--Does not expire).  The 
industrial does not have to obtain its own power marketer license from FERC 
(subject to EPMI and EES making certain after the fact quarterlty filings for 
the industrials). 

Specifics:

Owners of generating facilities located at business locations and used 
primarily for back-up for self-generation (who will be "public utilities" 
subject to the Federal Power Act only while they sell at wholesale) can sell 
power at wholesale from such facilities to EPMI and EES without prior notice 
under section 205 of FPA (would usually require 60 day advance notice 
filing).  
  -- Waives certain parts of the filing requirements for the industrial; 
however, the industrial will still be subject to shortened filing 
requirements for dispositions of facilities and interlocking positions while 
they are selling at wholesale.
 -- EPMI and EES will make the FERC quarterly filings on behalf of the 
industrials for any of these purchases.  Our report must show the names of 
the industrial; aggregate amount of capacity and/or energy purchased from 
each seller; and the aggregate compensation paid to each seller.  
Accounting/commercial folks for EPMI and EES-- please make sure these 
purchases are flagged in the accounting system, since the report will be 
separate from our big quarterly reports.
 -- This does not authorize the retail industrial customer to violate any 
rules or tariffs of its host utility.  This does not authorize an industrial 
to resell power it purchases (only can sell what it generates); unless 
otherwise allowed (or not precluded) by its retail tariff.

West Desk:  This is similar to the authorization that FERC gave last week to 
purchases from industrials in WSCC.


____________________________________
On April 27, FERC issued an order granting EPMI and EES the authority to 
purchase power from IPPs at market-based rates.  As the attached order 
indicates, the effective date of the EPMI and EES rate schedules is March 6, 
2001.

PG&E filed their Schedule F which displays its nonpriority unsecured claims.  
Many of the claims were listed as unknown in amount.  The PX credit amounts 
were listed as disputed.   Two PX credit amounts were specified in the 
Schedule F:

Enron Energy Marketing      $201,964,905.64
Enron Energy Services       $ 19,737,979.97
Total disclosed PX credit   $221,702,885.61

Note that in the claims that were listed as unknown in amount, none were 
described as PX Credit in nature. 

Two points to be made: 1) this information is now public (but on page 5,066 
of 17,096 on a CD), along with $53,985,167 in other Enron related claims, and 
2) our calculation of the PX credit was $392,416,534 at the beginning of May.

Regards,


Michael

This chapter explains the pre-determined conditions for contracts in New 
England. I am still looking for the clearest explanation of the market rules 
and procedures with respect to these internal contracts.

See the attached regarding our discussions of yesterday with respect to the 
ISDA contracts.  Generally, transfers of financial transactions will require 
consents, and other than Duke, there is little value in "same counterparty."

Elizabeth:

I agree that it's probably better not to attend the conference.  After our 
conversation I, too, concluded that it would be awkward---just too much 
explaining to do!

I had a great time at Whistler and in Vancouver, but I'm glad to be back.  
This week is going to be exciting.

Mark H. gave me a call re offices on Friday.  I will try to follow up with 
him today.

I hope all is well with you.

Best,

Steve

These are the outstanding deals.  The criteria are for deals with end date 
greater than today.

    

The zero priced deals that Kim talked to Elizabeth about for PG&E Energy are 
Nos. 421891, 892, 893, and 894 in case Elizabeth wants to know.

By copy of this email, I am asking Mary Cook to send to you a draft of the 
latest form of MNA.  This MNA , I believe, is still a work in progress and is 
intended to include  only  Master Agreements for which we are comfortable 
that the underlying transactions are commodities subject to the special 
bankruptcy code protections.  Hope it helps.

Elizabeth,

We are working on a settlement transaction which will leave a variety of
relationships in place with a group of financially troubled companies. We'd 
been
negotiating a netting agreement, and after you spoke to our group, it occurred
to us that we ought to take a look at your netting agreements for potential 
use
in our transaction. Could you please forward an example of one to me? We would
be netting with multiple parties on both sides, so it will be a "rectangular"
netting arrangement, if I recall your descriptive terminology correctly.

Thanks much.

Paul Puchot

Default:

 Spray bottle manufacturer Indesco International, Inc. missed an interest=

Bankr. reform update:

 The Senate is now on track to vote on the bankruptcy reform bill this=20

some=20
hope in lenders=02=07 hearts that the bill could become law despite a Presi=

Nevertheless, a bank lobbyist sounded pessimistic about a successful overri=

Steel again?:

 The domestic steel industry was one of the most troubled sectors of the U.=

economy in the wake of the 1997 Asian financial crisis, as imports flooded=

the market.  For the past year, we have been writing little about the steel=

track to surpass the 1998 record.  Also, the price for hot rolled coil, for=

Hi Charlotte

I'd love to play but I can't this week. Yuck. Let's try next week.  

PS Doubles was fun - I haven't played much doubles and it really is a 
different rhythm. Maybe we could play doubles sometime soon too

See you soon

Attached is a resume from Les Adams, who is a friend of Bob Williams.  He saw 
the ad in the Texas Lawyer and contacted Bob about how to apply.  His resume 
does not indicate law school grades, but when I asked, he said he doesn't 
remember specifically since it has been 20 years, but that he seems to recall 
a B average, which was around top 20%.

Let me know if you want to talk with this applicant.

Dear Michelle: 

As we discussed, Bob Williams indicated that you would be willing to review  
my resume for the wholesale marketing position you are trying to fill. ?In 
my  
experience with The Coastal Corporation prior to the merger, I handled a 
very  
diverse range of marketing issues, from antitrust to collections, and have  
drafted marketing contracts for everything from coal to catalyst (and of  
course, oil and gas). 

I have attached a resume and cover letter. ?Please don't hesitate to call if  
I can provide you with any more information. 

Regards,  

Les Adams

Please find attached clean and blacklined copies of the base contract, cover 
sheet and schedules.  These drafts evidence changes made to the documents 
pursuant to comments from Elizabeth and Chris.  Given the urgency in the 
Alberta market to start putting masters in place, I would propose to 
distribute these versions to our commercial people in Calgary to start 
negotiating with Alberta counterparties for Jan 1.  We can update the form as 
we tweek it over the course of the drafting process in Ontario.  If anyone 
has any concerns with this approach, please let me know ASAP.

Thanks

Subject: Re: Intellectual Property Rights Protection in Confidentiality

Thanks for your replies. One area that has concerned me is the possibility of 
a claim by our CA counterparty that we developed an idea using in part their 
information, when in fact we independently developed the concept.  have seen 
some CA's that expressly address this as an exception to the definition of 
Confidential Information. Also, how should we address the point Mark raised 
about the development of ideas jointly while in discussions with the 
counterparty. I
Let's get together to talk further about this next week when Mark G. gets 
back from Canada.

I'll set up the meeting.

		 Subject: Re: Intellectual Property Rights Protection in Confidentiality 
Agreements

Not quite sure what you mean by "information developed" from a value or 
exploitation perspective, or understand the exposure you believe we have 
under our existing, well drafted confidentiality agreements, to which I take 
no credit whatsoever, unfortunately. 

We should not be using the information disclosed by a counterparty for any  
purpose other than to evaluate and negotiate any possible transaction with 
that counterparty. To use it for any other purpose would be in breach of the 
confidentiality agreement. Since we are discussing the information and 
disclosing it to each other it is caught by the confidentiality undertakings. 
 
If we develop any  information independently without the benefit of any 
confidential information received from the disclosing counterparty, then of 
course we can claim it as ours, before expiry of the term of the 
confidentiality agreement, and protect it accordingly and the counterparty 
would have to establish that we did not develop it independently without the 
benefit of their confidential information.
 
During the period of the confidentiality agreement, ownership of information 
that we developed using a counterparty's confidential information is not an 
issue, since we can only use it for the purposes set out in the relevant 
confidentiality agreement. If we want to use it for any other purpose, during 
the term of the confidentiality agreement, we will need to reach agreement 
with the counterparty as to any rights for exploitation in a substantive 
agreement, recognising that we may will be mixing intellectual property 
rights.

Marcus

Subject: Re: Intellectual Property Rights Protection in Confidentiality 
Agreements  

Alan -

I agree that we need to make some revisions and, having read Marcus' 
comments, I agree also that broad language covers the general concepts.  I 
believe ownership of information developed during discussions will be the hot 
area, especially where we are discussing projects with companies while we 
developed parallel projects.  These situations make Enron an easy target.  

Though the general language of the agreement covers this generally, enhanced 
language should be considered.

Please let me know if you want to pursue this further.

I have been thinking that we should enhance our Confidentiality Agreement 
forms to address IP issues to protect Enron's interests. Do you concur that 
we should do something? If so what modifications should be made? Peter Mims, 
the VE lawyer at the offsite last Octobe, might be a good person to work with 
on this project.

Advise me of your thoughts.

I want to sign Eleanor (and maybe Alice too) up for swim lessons at the
Houstonian.  What is the name of the woman that you liked?

Also, I was looking at a day camp for Eleanor.  There are the "Kidventure"
camps that look pretty good.  They do one at the Houstonian (Kidventure
does), but it is full already for the 3-4 year olds.  Kidventure also holds
a camp at St. Anne's on Westheimer (it appears to not be religiously
affiliated, if that matters).  There are some slots still available for the
3-4 year olds and the 5-13 year olds if you were interested in Ella also.
I thought Eleanor would be more comfortable initially if she knew someone
since it would be a new place.  Are you interested in signing Sam (and
Ella, although they would not be together) up for a week in late July/early
August?  All this stuff is on the Houstonian web cite under the Youth link.

On another note, we enjoyed dinner on Saturday.  As always, the food and
company were great.  I think Phil drank way too much since he was quite
hungover on Sunday, but other than that, no casualties.  Eleanor slept in
until 8 a.m.  a first for her.  I need to get Julie to keep her up later,
although we were still up at 7 with Alice.

To confirm, I am away from the office Thursday April 12 through Thursday 
April 19, but reachable by cell at most times.  As Thursday is the Early 
Termination Date, the following will need to be completed in my absence (with 
Section references to PG&E's Oct. 99 form of Master):

1.  PEGGY/JON:  Unless a replacement deal has been entered into, cut NITs as 
of 8:00 am Thursday morning.

2.  GREG:  Determine an estimate of our (i.e. ECC) costs and expenses as a 
result of the Default by PG&E, including for Canadian and US counsel under 
Section 12.2, and estimating future costs and expenses to be incurred.

3.  CHERYL/JON/GREG:  Determine receivables owing as of the Early Termination 
Date under Section 12.3, noting the portion that is pre-petition and the 
portion that is post-petition. 

4.  JON/GREG:  Obtain quotes from 3 dealers for the Market Value of the 
terminated Transactions under Section 12.4.  Greg needs to sit with Jon when 
the quotes are obtained, on a taped line, following the outline prepared by 
Houston for Portland.  The quotes obtained are to be entered into the log 
sheets prepared by Credit, and returned to Credit.  The calls are to be saved 
and kept by IT on tape/CD.  Quotation confirmation forms are to be completed 
and sent to the dealers providing the quotes, and their return pursued.  A 
single, aggregated MTM/early termination/liquidation amount for the 
terminated Transactions is to be determined by comparing the Market Value to 
the Contract Value and using the Prime Rate as the discount factor under 
Section 12.5.

5.  CHERYL/JON/GREG:  Prepare our claim as the aggregate of 2 (costs and 
expenses), 3 (receivables) and 4 (MTM) above.  Organize documentation and 
quantification in a binder and send copies to Jeff Hodge and Elizabeth 
Sager.  Once Jeff/Elizabeth have approved, to formalize the claim send a 
notice with a copy of our claim and demand for payment to PG&E under Article 
15 of the Master, with payment due on the next Business Day under Section 
12.4(iv).  US counsel under Elizabeth Sager's supervision should then pursue 
recovery through the bankruptcy proceedings, including by exercising any 
direct or affiliate set offs to other positions.

6.  JON/GREG:  If it has not been negotiated and documented before I leave, a 
replacement transaction for the 75MM/day may have to be put in place with 
PG&E, hopefully under our paper (GTC) with whatever amendments (i.e. 
California law) are approved by Jeff Hodge.  We may have to use their paper 
(Master) if necessary and approved by Jeff Hodge to obtain the security 
interest in their receivables - in which case certain (not all) of the 
amendments to their paper that we have been requesting will need to be made.

Peter.

Elizabeth:

ISDA is holding an Energy conference on March 6th, 2001 at The Four Seasons
Hotel in Houston.  We would be delighted to have you speak again on the
same
issues you discussed at our North American Energy and Developing Products
Committee meeting last October at The Regency Hyatt.

Please find attached a DRAFT agenda for the morning discussion for your
information.  I am in the process of finalizing the agenda and would
appreciate advice on selecting bullet points to describe briefly the
discussion on the Comparison of Master Agreements used in North America and
Europe.  I have allowed 45 minutes for the discussion (12:15 PM - 1:00 PM).
In addition, we would welcome any suggestions you may have on inviting an
ISDA member from a another company to help you discuss topic.

 <<elizabeth sager.doc>>

I will call you soon to discuss.

Thanks and regards,
Liz

notice issue raised by PCA.  I assume Enron's regulatory counsel, LeBoeuf,
Lamb, has provided you with a set. If, however, you'd like me to send a
complete set over, just let me know.  Thanks.

By agreeing to pay only for "reasonable" offers, DWR left itself a loophole 
big enough to drive a truck through:

"DWR will assume financial responsibility for
all purchases by the ISO in its ancillary services and imbalance energy
markets based bids or other offers determined to be reasonable. Such
determination of reasonableness will be made by DWR on a case by case basis
and communicated to the ISO."  (Emphasis added.)

Market Notice re Credit Issues

In response to the FERC order of April 6, 2001 re the issue of
creditworthiness, the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) has
authorized the ISO to make the following statement. To the extent (and only
to the extent) that a purchase is not otherwise paid by any party or payable
by another party meeting the credit standards set forth in the ISO Tariff
(another "Qualified Party"), DWR will assume financial responsibility for
all purchases by the ISO in its ancillary services and imbalance energy
markets based on bids or other offers determined to be reasonable. Such
determination of reasonableness will be made by DWR on a case by case basis
and communicated to the ISO.  All bids into the ancillary services and
imbalance energy markets will be deemed to be contingent on the acceptance
of financial responsibility by DWR, to the extent not paid or payable by
another Qualified Party.  Unless a supplier is otherwise notified, any bid
accepted by the ISO will be deemed to have the financial support of another
Qualified Party or DWR as specified in this notice.  In addition to the
foregoing, DWR will assume financial responsibility for all purchases
resulting from the issuance by the ISO of emergency dispatch instructions,
to the extent not paid or payable by another Qualified Party.  Payment for
such purchases shall be made according to the rate specified in the ISO
Tariff for emergency dispatch instructions.  The ISO and/or DWR reserve the
right to rescind or modify the foregoing arrangements at any time and for
any reason, including a successful rehearing or appeal from the April 6
order.

As the FERC determined in its February 14 order that DWR is a creditworthy
counterparty, the ISO believes that the foregoing arrangements meet the
requirements of FERC's April 6 Order. Accordingly, the ISO expects that
suppliers will honor their obligations under the ISO Tariff and related
agreements to respond to ISO dispatch instructions.

Don and Carol - Jim Keller suggested that I send the attached memo to you.  
EES is attempting to become licensed to provide competitive energy supply to 
New Jersey customers.  Conectiv has stated that they are unable to accept 
modifications to the Supplier Agreement.  The purpose of the attached memo is 
to provide a summary of the primary provisions we attempted to amend so that 
a determination may be made as to whether EES should execute the Supplier 
Agreement.  Please call me at x58456 if you have any questions or comments.  
Thanks.

This is a proposed margin agreement from Pacificorp.  We are out of the money 
over $250mm and they are getting nervous.  Tracy and I are trying to get them 
to sign an EEI but they are dragging their feet.  Let's discuss a strategy 
for moving forward.   

If this agreement is not bad from a legal perspective than I am okay with 
moving forward with some changes to the credit levels.  However, if it is not 
acceptable we should put pressure on them to sign an EEI.

Let's discuss.

Bill:  As a follow-up to our discussions last night we are sending a draft
form of proposed margin agreement.  The threshold amounts can be changed
based on our discussions. While I would prefer to use an EEI agreement,
unfortunately until I get some direction from our contract people this is
the agreement we would like to go with.

Thanks

Hi folks.  Marcus Wood recently contacted my about billing matters, and told 
me that Trading has double paid two bills - one in the amount of $9,305.50 
for "ENA, West Desk Trading", and in the amount of $52,674.90 for "ENA, 
California Power Matters" (perhaps this one is actually Sanders related??).  
Could one of you please contact Marcus and let him know if you want the 
amounts refunded or applied to any particular unpaid matters?  Thanks.

Enclosed is a draft collateral agreement for discusion at the next meeting.  
We attempted to develop one that was simple and not onerous to comply with.  
I expect to send out a note shortly announcing that the next meeting will be 
at the Broadmoor in Colorado Springs on August 10.

I attach a DRAFT of our revised Service Agreement to be submitted to 
FirstEnergy.  I have met with Elizabeth Sager and have tried to address the 
most serious problems in the underlying Tariff.  Note that because these 
changes, even if they are all accepted by FE, are not necessarily controlling 
(because they are in the Service Agmt rather than the Tariff)  but would at 
least give us arguments on our side in case of a dispute.  Ed Sacks, per my 
voicemail, I still need your credit comments please.  Janine and Ed Baughman, 
who would be appropriate to comment on Sec 2.1 re:  Scheduling? 

Because this is not blacklined to show changes, my changes from the original 
Service Agreement that FE published are as follows:

Section 3.1:  The last 2 sentences are copied from the EES Service Agmt
Sec. 3.3-3.10:  This is all new language suggested by EPMI.  (Note that I 
still need to run 3.10 by Elizabeth.)
Section 5.15:  I added a new final sentence.
Section 5.16:  I added this whole thing because the Tariff does not have any 
reps being given by FE (and this language makes the reps reciprocal). I also 
added reps from FE to us re:  its relationship as Agent for the 4 underlying 
utilities, which change  we have found to be critical b/c EPMI is not in 
direct privity of contract with such 4 utilities.)
Sec. 5.17:  This mirrors the change requested by EES.

I will return to the office on Monday.  Please feel free to call me at 57400.
Janet

As you are aware, some lawyers and legal specialists were recently moved into 
different groups within our department.  Time and expenses should continue to 
be charged through year end to the Cost Centers or WBS Elements which were 
already in place.  This is for budget purposes.

This means timekeepers need to continue to enter time as usual --- for the 
same people and groups you have been entering time for until we can charge 
time and expenses to the new Cost Centers at the beginning of 2001. 

In summary, your Cost Center will not change until January 2001.

I have been out of the loop on WIO for sometime, so I am not well informed on 
the governance.  When last I dealt with WIO, it was to be a standards 
organization with no operational authority.  I don't think there is a problem 
with a stakeholder board in that case.  If however, the board has operation 
authority, not just standards and review of compliance, than perhaps an 
indepent board is required.

Because WIO will be deciding issues involving the primary congested paths in 
the West, I believe the issues to be resolved by WIO may be very important.  
Accordingly, I have argued in-house (to anyone who will listen) that we 
should be arguing that WIO should be independent.  I don't believe that it is 
independent, it's a stakeholder board, like California and the WSCC, both of 
which we have had problems with. 

Historically, a number of people have worked on WIO.  Tom worked on it for a 
while.  Recently, I think Marcie Milner has been monitoring the meetings.  I 
think Steve Walton and DIck Ingersoll may also be following WIO to some 
degree.  Also Jim has suggested to Alan that he might want to be following 
"seams" issues.  A while ago Marcie asked me to review the governance 
structure.  I told her that I didn't like the lack of independence and 
suggested that we oppose it.  Nonetheless, I believe I was told that we had 
already agreed to it.

Subject: Western Connection Interface (WIO)

Christian,

Earlier this week you asked me to review a stack of documents (proposals and 
draft bylaws) relating to the proposed Western Interconnection Organization.  

Conclusion:  Based upon a quick review of the draft proposal, bylaws, and 
other materials, I see no major objections to Enron voting for the formation 
of the WIO.   The reason to vote for this organization would be to facilitate 
the development of uniform reliability standards and efficient electric 
markets in the Western Interconnection.  However, you should carefully 
consider the fact that the board of directors will be weighted towards 
transmission owners (who will have 8 of the 27 votes).  Power marketers, 
generators, and load-serving entities will only have 4 votes.  14 directors 
establish a quorum and the board only requires a majority vote of directors 
present, so it is conceivable that, for example, 15 directors show up, 8 of 
which are transmission owners, and the transmission owners are able to pass 
any resoultion they wish.  Related to this issue is the inability of one 
membership group, such as the power marketer's group, to be able to veto a 
proposal.  It will take three membership classes acting in unison, plus two 
other votes, to defeat a proposed action by the board.  Unfortunately, 
because I am not personally familiar with the internal dynamics of the WSCC 
membership, I am unable to offer any indication of the how much of a risk 
this presents.  

       Background and Overview
In General:  The Western Interconnection Organization ("WIO") will be formed 
by consolidating the Western Regional Transmission Association, the 
Southwestern Regional Transmission Association, the Northwestern Regional 
Transmission Association, and the Western States Coordinating Council (WRTA, 
SWRTA, NRTA, and WSCC, respectively) into one organization.  The WIO, a 
non-profit corporation, will assume and perform the functions of these 
organizations, and, eventually, those organizations will be disbanded.

The principal responsibilities of the WIO will be as follows:

 *The WIO will be the primary authority for promulgating regional 
reliability, operating, and procedural standards.
 *The WIO will work to resolve conflicting regional reliability standards, 
and work to develop compatible and efficient practices throughout the Western 
Interconnection.
 *The WIO will have no authority over commercial practices (but may work to 
promote compatible, efficient markets).
 *Provide a process for resolving disputes arising out of WIO functions and 
between WIO members.

Membership:

Any entity meeting the criteria for membership in one of the following 
membership classes may be Member of the WIO.  There are five classes of 
membership:  (1) Business entities owning more than 1000 miles of 
transmission lines, (2) Business entities owning less than 1000 miles of 
transmission lines; (3) Business entities that do not own, control, or 
operate transmission or distribution lines, e.g., power marketers, 
load-serving entities, independent power producers; (4) End users of 
electricity; and (5) Representatives of States and Provinces in the Western 
Interconnection.

 *Each class elects four (4) directors.
 *All of the classes select seven (7) non-affiliated directors, for a total 
of twenty-seven (27) directors.
 
Quorum:  A majority of all members, including a majority in at least three 
classes.  In the case of directors, there must be 14 directors.

Board Decisions:  A board decision requires a majority of the directors 
present.

Standing Committees:  There are three standing committees:  the Planning 
Coordination Committee, the Operating Committee, and the Market Interface 
Committee.  

Committee Voting:  For purposes of voting on recommendations to the board, 
committees are divided into three classes:  (1) transmission providers, (2) 
transmission customers, and (3) States and Provincial Members (which is Class 
5). In order to make a recommendation to the board, there must be a simple 
majority of votes from the transmission provider and transmission customer 
classes.

Termination:  The WIO can be terminated upon a vote of the majority of the 
members.

Elizabeth,

Well, I think I can safely say my biggest accomplishment this year was in my 
personal life however, I guess that will have to be "graded" by a higher 
being!!!!

1.  Understanding and implementing the EEI Master Power Purchase and Sale 
Agreement.  Fine tuning where necessary and adjusting per Counterparty.

2.  Supporting a larger staff of attorneys than previously, keeping the paper 
flow moving for all, assisting with special projects as needed and insuring a 
sense of urgency when warranted.

3.  Understanding the different personalities in the Group, acting as liason 
within the Group and promoting a team effort to help the overall success of 
the Power Trading Group.

4.  Performing my duties in a cheerful, helpful manner always remembering to 
be respectful of others and a good listener.

Genia

Shari
 
I have just spoken with Valarie Curry who has advised that the deal was 
signed, with no changes made by First Energy and guarantees are in place as 
well.

 Could not have been done without you. Thank you.
 
All the best.

Elizabeth:

We followed up on our discussions last week regarding the consequences of a 
possible bankruptcy of a municipal counterparty and our ability to terminate 
and liquidate our positions in such event, without regard to the generally 
applicable automatic stay.  Attached is a brief memo discussing this issue.  
The principal points to note are as follows:

(1) Municipalities, if they were to file for bankruptcy, do so under Chapter 
9 of the Bankruptcy Code ("BC")--e.g., Orange County, CA.

(2) The "forward contract" exception to the automatic stay found in Sec. 556 
of the BC presently is not explicitly made applicable to filings pursuant to 
Chapter 9.  As you recall, Sec. 556 allows termination of a forward contract 
because of the commencement of a bankruptcy case notwithstanding the general 
prohibition for termination of executory contracts for such grounds in Sec. 
365.  This appears to have been an oversight when Sec. 556 was added to the 
BC in 1982 (according to the National Bankruptcy Review Commission) and 
probably has not been a "high on the agenda item" to correct due to the fact 
that Chapter 9 bankruptcies are relatively rare.

(3) It appears that the other amendments to the BC dealing with forward 
contracts are applicable to Chapter 9, such as Sec. 362 (b) (6) which allows 
the non-defaulting party to setoff or settle without regards to the stay if 
there is an existing default other than an insolvency event.  Also note that 
Colliers on Bankruptcy, the "Bible" in this area, suggests that one can 
nonetheless make the argument that the forward contract exception can be read 
to apply to Chapter 9 filings under present law (see also the discussion at 
(6) below)--although it is uncertain whether a bankruptcy court would accept 
this argument to effectively write something into the statute.

(4) There currently is pending legislation that has been passed by both the 
House and the Senate (and is now the subject of a joint House/Senate 
Conference Committee) that would make it clear that the forward contract 
exception to the automatic stay shall apply to Chapter 9 bankruptcies.  
Adding Sec. 556 to Sec. 901 (the section delineating which sections are 
applicable to Chapter 9 bankruptcies) is not controversial and should survive 
the joint conference committee since similar provisions exist in both the 
House and Senate bills. These provisions are part of the overall legislation 
making fundamental changes in the BC (that has received a lot of press and 
which is controversial in terms of how it treats individual consumers filing 
for bankruptcy).  Our sense, however, is that the bill will be passed and 
signed by President Bush.

(5) Assuming the amendments to Chapter 9 filings are enacted, under the 
existing bills they would first become effective for bankruptcy cases filed 
after 180 days after the legislation is signed by the President.  Thus, to 
the extent that ENA has existing contracts with municipalities, ENA would be 
permitted to exercise its termination and liquidation rights thereunder 
without regard to the automatic stay as long as the municipal counter party 
does not file within 6 months after the date the legislation is signed.

(6) It is worth noting that the legislative committee reports describing the 
changes provide that Congress is "clarifying" that the forward contract 
provisions of the BC apply to municipal bankruptcies, noting that these 
provisions "by their terms are intended to apply to all proceedings under 
Title 11" (which includes Chapter 9 proceedings).  The Senate Report  goes on 
to say that:  "Although sections...556...provide that they apply in any 
proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code, this subsection makes a technical 
amendment in chapter 9 to clarify the applicability of these provisions."  
(Emphasis added).  Thus, this committee language would appear to support an 
argument that Sec. 556 applies to Chapter 9 bankruptcies under Congress's 
interpretation of existing law--obviously, the hoped for result from ENA's 
standpoint.

(7) For your information, when Orange County, CA, filed for bankruptcy the 
County filed under Chapter 9.  The investment pool that held the derivatives 
and other financial contracts initially also made a separate filing under 
Chapter 9. This filing was dismissed, essentially on the basis the investment 
pool was not eligible for relief under Chapter 9 because it did not qualify 
as a "municipality" and it had not been specifically authorized to file under 
Chapter 9.  The dealers and brokerage houses terminated and liquidated their 
positions shortly after the initial filing, based on their belief that the 
investment pool's use of Chapter 9 was improper.  Their terminations and 
liquidations were not undone.

(8) Lastly, as mentioned above, you should note that even if Sec. 556 is not 
applicable to Chapter 9 filings under existing law, if ENA terminated a power 
contract with a municipality prior to the filing date for a reason other than 
the act of filing a bankruptcy petition (e.g., a bond downgrade; failure to 
post collateral; a cross default; the existence of a condition where the 
counterparty is "unable to pay its debts as they come due," etc.), ENA would 
be permitted to proceed with the liquidation of its position (and it could 
exercise any set off or settlement rights) without regard to the automatic 
stay.

Hopefully, the pending legislation will be passed and the concern as to the 
applicability of Sec. 556 to municipalities will be completely eliminated 
within a relatively short period of time.  In the interim, particularly 
during the upcoming summer (when prices in many locations will be highly 
volatile and certain parties' credit positions could fluctuate rapidly and 
materially in some cases, particularly if they are filling open positions in 
the spot market), it may make sense to alert our credit group to be 
particularly vigilant in their monitoring of the ongoing financial condition 
of our municipal counterparties so that we preserve as much flexibility as 
possible with respect to exercising our termination rights under the 
contracts on account of defaults other than the filing of a bankruptcy 
petition by or against our counterparty.

Please give me (or Carl, 303 291-2630, or Jim, 303 291-2632) a call if you 
want to follow up on any of this.

Thanks.

John

Our external Counsel are reviewing the authority of FMPA to enter into the 
proposed transaction and will also advise as to the required representations 
and other specific due diligence we will need to conduct prior to entering 
into any such transaction.
 
Please ensure that credit get an early heads up on this proposed transaction, 
Ed Sacks is probably your first point of contact.
 
The form proposed by FMPA envisages a Master Agreement, which falls 
considerably short of what we would expect to see in a Master Agreement. As 
discussed with Billy I am viewing this as a single transaction and any 
discussion as to Master Agreements can be conducted in parallel to the 
proposed transaction. I attach the EEI Master, with Cover Sheet and

Weekly Deals:

June 4-9, 2001











Paul Jaboulet Parallele 45 C"tes du Rh"ne 750 ml.

[IMAGE]


This fifth-generation producer specializes in Rh"ne Valley wines from their 
ideally-situated, carefully tended vineyards. This blend of Syrah and 
Grenache has an intense, complex nose, with aromas of ripe red fruit 
(raspberries, cassis), violets and licorice. The palate is fresh and rich; 
its tannic structure and strength are harmonious and remarkable. Long, fruity 
finish.


Cash Discounted Sale Price: $7.88
Sale Price: $8.29













1999 Frei Brothers Reserve Sonoma County Merlot 750 ml.

[IMAGE]


The grapes for this wine were de-stemmed, but not crushed, to retain a 
substantial proportion of whole berries for fermentation.  This technique 
minimizes bitter tannin extraction in the wine. The wine was 100% barrel aged 
in a mixture of new and prior use French, European, and American oak for 
approximately a year. 


Cash Discounted Sale Price: $12.59
Sale Price: $13.25













Marcelina Vineyards, 1997 Cabernet Sauvignon, Napa Valley 750 ml.

[IMAGE]


Concentrated blackberry, black cherry and cassis fruit flavors framed by 
smoked bacon, tobacco, cedar notes, and coconut characteristics. Full-bodied 
with a velvety, silky texture and a lingering finish. 


Cash Discounted Sale Price: $19.99
Sale Price: $21.04













Gallo of Sonoma Barrelli Creek Vineyard Zinfandel 750 ml.

[IMAGE]


Our family's Barrelli Creek Vineyard is located in the temperate, Region III 
hillsides of Sonoma County's Alexander Valley; on a site first planted by 
Italian immigrants over a century ago. The low vigor of this vineyard's 
gravelly clay loam soils, in combination with its micro-climate and optimal 
viticultural practices, yield intensely concentrated Zinfandel and Petite 
Sirah grapes loaded with the zesty aromas and flavors of black cherries, 
boysenberry jam, and black pepper.


Cash Discounted Sale Price: $12.82
Sale Price: $13.49













Jim Beam Bourbon 80o 1.75L

[IMAGE]


A bourbon of great finesse and subtle nuance, neither light nor heavy, but 
rather a mellow "baritone" of a spirit. It is distinctive not because it is 
different, but because it is perfect. 


Cash Discounted Sale Price: $19.99
Sale Price: $21.04













Belvedere Vodka 80o750ml.

[IMAGE]


One of the first grain-based deluxe vodkas of Poland, known for its strong 
Polish character and its unique bottle, with a window on the front through 
which the illustration on the back (of the official residence of the Polish 
president in Warsaw) can be seen magnified by the vodka.


Cash Discounted Sale Price: $24.99
Sale Price: $26.31













Beaufond V.S.O.P. Cognac 80o750ml.

[IMAGE]


This small but excellent producer is situated in the heart of the Grande 
Champagne district. Masterfully blended and distinctively packaged, it is one 
of the best values for the price in Cognac.


Cash Discounted Sale Price: $14.99
Sale Price: $15.78













Edna Valley Chardonnay 750 ml.

[IMAGE]


Located just south of San Luis Obispo on California's Central Coast, Edna 
Valley is ideally situated for the production of premium Chardonnay and Pinot 
Noir. Their Chardonnay is full-bodied with smoky aromas of vanilla, oak and 
spice. The mouthfeel is soft and lush, but at the same time intense, with 
ripe flavors of white peach, apple and tropical fruits. A subtle mineral 
component complements the higher acid level, lending structure, balance, and 
complexity.


Cash Discounted Sale Price: $12.99
Sale Price: $13.67













Lindemans Shiraz/Cabernet, Cawarra 1.5L.

[IMAGE]


Dr. Henry Lindeman planted his first grape vines in 1843 along the Paterson 
River in New South Wales, Australia. His homestead, Cawarra, is named after 
the aboriginal term for "beside running water," and Cawarra Claret was the 
first wine he exported. Today, the Cawarra line commemorates these first 
wines. The Shiraz/Cabernet is easy drinking and approachable with generous 
varietal fruit flavors and aromatic oak in the background.


Cash Discounted Sale Price: $6.88
Sale Price: $7.24

Hey.

Hear that you didn't get to hit with Dan on Monday but instead got a few 
games of doubles under your belt.  How did that go?

I was wondering if you wanted to hit on Thursday either during lunch or after 
work.  I usually have a meeting during lunch on Thursday but heard it might 
be cancelled.  I am going to be up at the Met this evening and will book a 
court if you want to hit during either times.  I will just have to get back 
with you if you want to hit during lunch to let you know if we have our 
meeting or not.

Talk to you soon.

Char

On Friday, about 3:00 pm, the ISO filed for emergency tariff changes, some of 
which are effective as of December 8, 2000 beginning HE 1600, and others that 
take effect Tuesday, December 12, 2000.  As a consequence, we no longer have 
the luxury of waiting until Jan 1, 2001 to start documenting certain costs; 
we must start documenting the verifiable costs to support supplemental energy 
and ancillary services energy bids in excess of the $250 soft cap 
immediately.  I understand that at least some of the traders have been 
informed of these changes, but I thought that it might be helpful for 
everyone to have a concise summary of the main points of this filing.  

1.  The ISO has changed the $250 hard cap on Supplemental Energy bids and 
Ancillary Service Energy bids to a soft cap.  It's similar to the FERC's 
proposed soft cap in its Nov. 1 Order.  Sellers can bid over $250 for 
supplemental energy bids and ancillary services energy bids.   If the ISO 
accepts a bid greater than $250, settlement will be as-bid and subject to 
refund if costs cannot be verified.  SCs must submit cost documentation to 
the FERC, ISO, and California Electric Oversight Board for all energy 
dispatched in excess of the soft cap.  Effective December 8, 2000.

2.  Beginning Trade Day December 12, 2000, the ISO is going to charge SCs who 
underschedule load or schedule generation that does not show up in real time, 
based on each SC's net regional negative uninstructed deviations.  ("Net 
Negative Uninstructed Deviations" is a new ISO defined term, see below.)  
These SCs will be charged for (1) amounts paid by the ISO to purchase Energy 
from bids above the price cap, and (2) costs for Energy associated with 
out-of-market Dispatch instructions issued due to underscheduling.  

3.  Participating Generators that fail to respond to ISO Dispatch 
instructions will be assessed a penalty equal to double the highest price 
paid by the ISO for Energy for the hour in which the Generator failed to 
respond.  The penalty will not be assessed if the Generating Unit gave the 
ISO advance notice of a de-rate or outage that would limit the Generator's 
ability to respond to a Dispatch instruction.  If the outage or de-rate 
occurs in real-time, then a reason code provided with a decline or partial 
acceptance of an ADS instruction will constitute notice and no penalty will 
be assessed (subject to some additional conditions).  If the ISO has to 
curtail firm load to manage a System Emergency, the Generator will pay an 
additional penalty of $1000/MWh for dispatched energy it failed to deliver.

4.  Bilateral arrangements with the ISO, i.e., out of market purchases, will 
not be altered by the ISO's Amendment 33.

5.  From December 1-5, the ISO paid an average of $5 million per day for real 
time energy.  On December 5th, the ISO paid $36 million and on December 7th 
$81 million.  

6.  The published ex post price will not exceed $250.

7.  There is still a hard cap of $250 on Ancillary Services capacity bids.

8.  Net Negative Uninstructed Deviations:  Penalties for being short in 
real-time (either underscheduled load or generation scheduled in forward 
markets that does not show up) are based on net deviations for each BEEP 
interval, based on an SC's entire portfolio, including Load, Generation, 
Imports, and Exports. 


9.  Action:  We need to start documenting costs of Supplemental Energy and 
Ancillary Services Energy bids immediately.  Much of the groundwork for 
figuring out what information to collect has been done with respect to the 
real-time and services desks, but we need to make sure that someone is 
collecting this information on a daily basis.  For now, I am willing to be 
the point person to make sure the information is collected and filed with the 
appropriate agencies, but eventually  someone from the floor should take on 
this responsibility.  I will be here early on Monday, and we can coordinate 
our efforts then.

Elizabeth,
Your deposition has been rescheduled for Wednesday, June 13, 2001, at 10:00 
am.  I understand from your assistant that you are available on that date.  
(I remain hopeful that we will have the matter resolved by then, but we were 
not in a position to indefinitely postpone rescheduling the depo, and we 
pushed it out about as far as we reasonably could).  Please review the 
subpoena duces tecum that was attached to your original deposition notice to 
determine whether you have any responsive documents that have not been 
previously produced.  In particular, please determine whether you have any 
notes, calendar entries, or contract negotiation files that have not been 
previously produced.  If you have any responsive documents that you believe a 
covered by the attorney-client privilege or attorney work product privilege, 
please let  me know about them anyway, so that we can make sure to disclose 
them properly to preserve the privilege.  Also, we will need to schedule a 
deposition prep meeting, assuming the deposition goes forward.  Please let me 
know when you have a couple of hours to meet with me and outside counsel to 
prepare.  If you have time available on Thursday, June 7, that would be a 
good time to try to schedule it.  Otherwise, let me know your availability.  
We will do what we can to make this as painless as possible.  Thanks.

Tracy,

Yesterday at the EEI conference I had lunch with Sierra Pacific's credit, 
risk, and power contracting folks.  Their credit person (Pamela Hirts) is new 
and was very interested in learning how to manage credit and risk through the 
EEI.  I think they might be receptive to negotiating an EEI with Enron.  If 
the bankruptcy rumors are true, we want to make sure that we have the EEI 
setoff language in place.

Stop by today and we can coordinate our efforts.

Steve

Rhonda,

Can you confirm for me the forms of confirmations that we have been using to 
confirm our physical power transactions with both Sierra Pacific Power and 
Nevada Power?  We do not have a "golden" master agreement, so I believe that 
the transactions are probably confirmed under the WSPP.

Given the bankruptcy noise for both utilities, I'd like to be able to get our 
arms around all of our documentation.  Please advise as to the timeliness on 
getting this information and if we need to pull legal/credit resources to 
assist or if you are not the point of contact on this matter.

Thanks,
Tracy

David,

The Supplementary Agreement looks fine.  There needs to be a few changes made 
to the cover sheet with respect to the MAC provision (debt rating) and the 
financial reporting for Party B (AEPSC).  AEPSC does not provide its own 
financials and is not rated.  So, the MAC and financial reporting 
requirements are only required for the 9 utilities.

AEPSC is only on the hook for third-party cross-default along with the 9 
utilities.

I'm sorry that I missed you today...got bogged down with other emergencies.  
But we can always wait for the cp's response and amend the above, unless you 
want to send another version.

Regards,
Tracy

Yes, the cp is required to post to EPMI a standby, letter of credit in the 
amount of $10,000,000 (ten million USD) in a form acceptable to EPMI no later 
than the end of business day, December 7, 2000.

I believe we had a previous confirm that included an l/c requirement...you 
may want to look at the last long term deal for language to insert into this 
confirm...or discuss the language with EPMI legal.

Thanks,
Tracy

California's GO Rating Cut To Aa3 From Aa2 By Moody's Updated: Tuesday, May 
15, 2001 12:03 PM ET 
NEW YORK, May 15, 2001 -- Moody's has lowered the rating on $19.8 billion of 
State of California General Obligation bonds to Aa3 from Aa2. In addition, we 
have lowered the rating on $5.7 billion in lease revenue bonds from Aa3 to 
A1. 
The downgrade reflects increasing financial risks associated with the 
continuing energy crisis, as well as those related to trends in the broader 
U.S. and California economies. The recent setback in securing legislation to 
provide energy purchase bridge financing threatens to compound the risks and 
cost of the energy crisis. In addition, the newly released May Revision to 
the Governor's Budget Submission confirms the substantial revenue 
deterioration that is expected to emerge over the next eighteen months due to 
the weak high technology sector and stock market. The May Revision commences 
what is likely to be a difficult budget debate. 
Delay in External Energy Financing Will Continue to Erode State Financial 
Position 
To date, the state's general fund cash advances for power purchases total 
approximately $4 billion, and these advances are likely to grow very quickly 
in the coming months. Last week, the legislature passed a bill (Senate Bill 
31) authorizing the issuance of $13.4 billion in revenue bonds to fund future 
purchases and repay the General Fund for past advances. Unfortunately, this 
law will not go into effect until late summer, thereby scuttling the state's 
planned interim loan facility which would have provided temporary funding for 
power purchases. Importantly, the bridge financing would have begun the 
process of shifting the source of cash from the state treasury to the credit 
markets, and ultimately to ratepayers. That process is now delayed, and in 
the interim, the state treasury will continue to serve as the source of funds 
for power purchases. 
Net state power purchase advances are running at the rate of over $1 billion 
per month. Moody's estimates that the state's ending cash position will be 
approximately $10 billion at June 30, 2001, including both General Fund cash 
and internal "borrowable resources", which represents cash that can be 
borrowed by the General Fund beyond the end of the fiscal year. This estimate 
takes into account expected energy purchases through June 30th. 
In July and August, an additional $3 to $4 billion could be expended from the 
state treasury to purchase power until external financing is secured, 
bringing total General Fund advances for power purchases to almost $10 
billion by mid-August. As a result, the state's cash reserves are likely to 
be significantly depleted by the time long-term financing can be secured. The 
experience of the early 1990s indicates that a substantial portion of 
borrowable resources serve as a source of liquidity. Nevertheless, Moody's 
still anticipates this weakened cash position will lead the state to seek 
external cash flow borrowing for the General Fund in the form of Revenue 
Anticipation Notes during 2002, reversing the trend over the last two fiscal 
years in which the State has not needed to borrow externally for seasonal 
cash flow purposes. The state is expected to release refined cash projections 
later this week. 
Although the state's liquidity position is clearly weakening, we do not view 
the state's current financial outlook as severe enough to lower the rating to 
the A range. And Senate Bill 31 protects the General Fund from future 
energy-related advances by stipulating that after November 15, 2001, the 
amounts required for short-term cash flow power purchases cannot exceed $500 
million in the aggregate. The enacted bill further requires that such amounts 
be repaid from the Department of Water Resources Electric Power Fund within 
180 days. These provisions provide some assurances that DWR will seek rate 
increases to fund its purchases when bond proceeds have been depleted. We are 
currently assuming the state's General Fund may not be fully reimbursed by 
the proceeds of the long-term financing, as such full reimbursement would 
reduce the amount of bond proceeds available for future power purchases, and 
require DWR to seek additional rate increases during 2001. Given the lack of 
consensus as to how to distribute the cost of power between ratepayers and 
the state treasury, it is unclear whether additional rate increases during 
2001 will be politically feasible. 
May Revision Quantifies Expected Deterioration in Revenue Forecast 
As expected, the May Revision to the Governor's Fiscal 2002 Budget Submission 
revised tax revenue forecasts downward by a substantial magnitude, reflecting 
the economic and revenue effect of the weakening economic outlook compared to 
that underlying the Governor's January proposal. In particular, the weakening 
U.S. economic outlook and stock market performance, particularly in the 
technology-oriented NASDAQ market, produce major changes to the income and 
sales tax forecasts. Over the last several years, the percentage of General 
Fund revenues attributable to capital gains and stock options has grown from 
approximately 5% in fiscal 1996 to an estimated 23% in the current fiscal 
year. Based primarily on the downturn in the high technology sector, which 
relies heavily on options in compensation packages, and the sluggish 
performance of the stock market and its adverse affect on capital gains, the 
state has reduced its tax revenue estimate for the upcoming year by 
approximately $5.4 billion, including a $2.7 downward revision in the 
personal income tax. The drop in these sources of income will also temper 
growth in sales tax collections for the upcoming year. In total, the state 
now expects revenues to decline by approximately $3.2 billion year over year 
between the current fiscal year and fiscal 2002. The state has not seen year 
over year tax revenue declines since 1992. 
A number of budgetary actions taken in recent years will aid the state in 
adapting to the weaker revenue forecast. During fiscal 2001, as well as in 
the January proposal for 2002, the budget included substantial non-recurring 
spending items. As a result the base of recurring budget demands in fiscal 
2002 and beyond is lower than it otherwise would have been. The governor has 
proposed to cancel or defer some of these items, seeking to reduce General 
Fund spending by approximately $3.2 billion as compared to the January 
proposal. Spending cuts, however, do not match the revenue decline. Fiscal 
2002 spending is slated to drop by $600 million year on year, a drop of less 
than 1%, while revenues are expected to fall by 4% during the same period. 
Although the revenue forecast is relatively cautious, the target ending 
balance, at $1.8 billion, leaves little cushion for additional bad news. 
The proposed budgetary reductions, along with proposed spending levels for 
recurring items such as education, will likely lead to prolonged budget 
debate in the coming weeks. While such budget negotiations would not 
necessarily adversely affect the timing of the issuance of the long-term 
power bonds, delay could further weaken the state's fiscal position. 
Energy Crisis Compounds Uncertainty in Economic Outlook 
The energy crisis will have economic, as well as financial, consequences that 
add further uncertainty to an already complex economic outlook. The 
Governor's economic forecast calls for the economy to slow through 2002, 
taking a similar if not more slightly pessimistic view than other economists, 
including UCLA, Economy.com, and the economists surveyed by the Western Blue 
Chip. The state posted non-farm employment gains of nearly 4% in 2000, but 
the Governor's forecast expects job growth to moderate to 2.3% in 2001, and 
grow by less than 2% in 2002. Salary and wage income growth, which drives tax 
revenues, is expected to be even weaker than employment trends. The drivers 
of the forecasts include the outlook for the high technology sector, as well 
as the important housing sector. 
None of the economic forecasts explicitly quantifies the impact of the energy 
crisis. The California economy is not heavily dependent upon energy, and 
ranks lowest among states in terms of per capita electricity consumption. The 
industries that drive the California economy are not heavy users of energy 
and it is not a major cost factor for the California industry mix. However, 
uncertainty regarding cost and availability of energy and the threat of 
unreliable power going forward have already damaged the state's business 
climate, reputation, and longer-term growth prospects. In Moody's view, the 
forecasting techniques of the major economic services tend to underestimate 
the potential impact of these difficult to quantify dimensions of the energy 
crisis. 
OUTLOOK: 
Outlook Remains Negative 
At the moment, we expect that the substantial cash resources accumulated by 
the State of California during the expansion of the last decade, in 
combination with the planned long-term energy financing will enable it to 
avert the degree of fiscal damage that would call for the rating to fall to 
the A range. If a reasonably cautious balanced budget is enacted and the 
long-term energy financing completed, the state will still have reasonable 
margins of bondholder protection on its balance sheet. However, if the state 
or US economic outlook weakens further, or if the energy financing stalls, or 
if the enacted budget is only narrowly balanced, the rating could be adjusted 
further. While we expect that the state will be able to structure a viable 
long-term energy financing over the next few months, substantial obstacles 
must be overcome to meet that goal. In addition, the state will need to enact 
a balanced budget that leaves enough cushion to accommodate the remaining 
economic uncertainty not captured in its cautious revenue forecast. Given the 
recent failure to secure the supermajority necessary to enact emergency 
bridge energy financing legislation, we expect that the budget - which also 
requires a two-thirds majority vote - will also be the subject of a difficult 
debate.

David:

The new version looks good. I made 1 change. In Section 2.9, I added a phrase 
that the Calendar will be posted on ERCOT MIS, so New Power will know where 
to go to find any changes or updates to the schedule made by ERCOT. Paul 
Radous is sending you a hard copy of the current Calendar to include as an 
attachment and he expects to have the credit language to you before noon. I 
am OK with the Confidentaility section. Let's just see what Anoush says.

Tom, Smith, Lloyd, Theresa, Jeff - please give us any comments you have. I 
have to send this document to Anoush today. However, I will make it clear 
that there may be additional comments.




Thanks,

Michelle

Subject: QSE Agreement with New Power

Attached is my preliminary mark-up of the draft sent by Mike Curry (5-2-01) 
incorporating the various following e-mails of Michelle to the best of my 
ability.  I ask that commercial persons rig up (or have someone else rig up 
for them) the "Attachment X" referenced in Michelle's new Section 2.9 
language.  Paul, I have reinstalled the Credit Support Annex in case you were 
intending to use that apparatus to install credit terms (and I'm presuming 
you are going to pull in an Enron Corp. guaranty, though I don't know your 
intentions.)  Please respond to me ASAP with your best efforts to state the 
final terms to be shown to 
New Power, and I will refine the document into shape suitable to be sent 
out.  Note -- I am uncertain how the confidentiality obligation in Section 
7.2 should be stated in view of the possibly converging relations of ENA 
Wholesale with EES, and therefore desire that it be stated as narrowly as can 
be done while addressing New Power's main concerns and stating an EPMI 
obligation with clear and livable boundaries.

I just received the package of master agreements you asked Genia to send me.
Thank you so much.  I have some thoughts about an approach to a simple master
and will look through these documents over the next weeks to see if I think 
the
approach will work.

Please let me know if there is anything I can do to help you.  I am asking my
secretary to send you a copy of the recent supplement to Documentation for
Derivatives on cross-product risk management that Tony and I just published, 
in
case it is of interest.

Elizabeth,

Attached are the short form of GTC's that we would like to use in connection 
with our telecom transactions.  Certain provisions of these GTC's are 
bracketed and I would appreciate your view as to whether or not these 
provisions should be included.  Also please note that I have incorporated the 
termination provisions that you sent to me by fax and these provisions are 
bracketed and set forth in Section 4.  Let us have your feedback when you 
can, as we would like to start using these (and preparing a version for use 
with our advertising master!)  Thanks in advance for your help!!

Molly:

This has been on my calendar for 2;30 for quite a while, but a note sent 
earlier this week (while I was out sick) says it should be 2:00 -- is that 
right?  I'm afraid that I've set up a conference call w/ 4 other people for 
1:30 and it can't be changed at this point.  So I'm probably not going to be 
available at 2:00.  I don't want to appear rude to Alice, so could you let 
her know?  And I have no paperwork on her yet -- should I have a resume or 
something?  And you should also note that my location has changed. I'm now in 
EB3811.  

Thanks for your assistance.

Regards,
Janice

maybe.  He was in today and met with Mark Taylor, Travis, and Lance, to 
positive results.  I certainly could ask him if he's interested in trading.  
Leslie Hansen thinks highly of him.  Michelle

If David's time permits on Monday or Tuesday, please have him look at what 
you have put together so far for the above.  I would really like to get this 
done or at least have one done prior to a new attorney joining the group on 
June 1.  Thanks for your help.

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook 
client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail 
via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is 
configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is 
migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your 
web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and 
To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook 
client is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) 
for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while 
connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA 
available from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  
http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Substitute "john.doe" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You 
will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in "corp/your user 
id" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You 
will now be able to view your mailbox.

 

PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between 
the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things 
in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the 
functions NOT available via OWA:

Features NOT available using OWA:

-  Tasks
-  Journal
-  Spell Checker
-  Offline Use
-  Printing Templates
-  Reminders
-  Timed Delivery
-  Expiration
-  Outlook Rules
-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall
-  Sharing Contacts with others
-  Task Delegation
-  Direct Resource Booking
-  Personal Distribution Lists

QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?

If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the 
Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:

 Outlook.2000@enron.com

Otherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at:

 713-853-1411

Thank you,

Outlook 2000 Migration Team

I must agree with Mary, the governance structure in the WIO is fundimentally 
flawed and only sets up a board that fights to a stalemate end game.  This 
board should had been independent and Marys right.  that's my 2 cents.

I have reviewed Chris' version of the Confirmation below.  I have made a
few changes to it now that there is only one Delivery Period.  The attached
is red-lined for ease of reference.

As far as I am concerned, it is ready to go. Let's see if Elizabeth
concurs.

Thanks,

Shari

I did not know that Greg was speaking to her.  He is out till next week and I 
will follow-up at that time.  I did receive a voice message from her some 
time back regarding the same thing, althoug I do not remember the topics 
being trading contracts or e-trading. In any event, after considering the 
time and effort involved (noting Insight usually requires some form of paper 
to be prepared), any potential value, the commercial requirement for our 
resources, and after discussing it with Milnthorp, I decided not to get 
involved.  If we think it is worthwhile I am open to persuausion.  Regards, 
Peter.

Hi Phil
Just want to make arrangements for Sam's party Sat, at the zoo, at 1000
with the Foelbers( no parent), Millers(no parent) and you'all  - You are
invited with the girls and could meet us at the zoo or, if you want a more
leisurely morning, we could pick up Eleanor and/or Alice and bring them
home. If we were to pick them up, we would swing around about 945.  Let me
know what you would like.  thanks

We have two Summer Clerks coming in this summer which we have hired through 
the Houston Bar Association Minority Recruitment Program.   Majed Nachawati 
will be starting Monday May 21st.  He will be here 6 weeks and Alisha Mahibar 
will start on July 2 and be here the final 6 weeks.  

Enron Corp. also has hired two law summer clerks from UT .  These clerks will 
be doing 4 week rotations throughout Enron and we will have them each for a 
four week  period.  Dates are still being finalized.

Samantha Ferguson, an HBA law clerk from last summer, will again support the 
Global Market group this summer.

I would like to have a point person from each of your groups with the charge 
of getting these clerks involved in the project flow for each group.  My plan 
is to have these clerks work with two groups during their time here with the 
groups rotating during the summer.  Please, consider who in your groups would 
be best suited for this role and provide feedback as soon as possible.  I 
will take this role for the East Origination-Gas Trading group.  Thanks for 
all your help.

Please find our draft PX/ISO figures.    We have not received the allocation 
of defaults from the ISO (PG&E,SCE et al).   They did however estimate the 
PG&E portion at 80%.  If this was the case, this would put EPMI's PG&E claim 
at approximately $39.8 million (($41,504,394 + $19,263 + $8,253,866)  x 80%).

Subject:  Re: WSPP Agenda


I do not remember any discussions on indemnification.  As to the exclusion
of direct damages, we did discuss that concept.  The intent was that the
21.3 damage calculation would recoup the direct damages (though it doesn't
fully do so as it does not recoup additional adminstrative or legal costs),
It was decided not to add such additional costs to the 21.3 calculation.
If you want to add any of these items to the agenda, please let me know.
If you do so, please send me sample language.
If we could find a fourth we could play doubles assuming that Elizabeth is
coming to the meeting and assuming that there are courts nearby.

>>> <drusso@reliantenergy.com> 12/07/00 12:36PM >>>
Mike,

     I noticed that there is not an indemnity provision in the WSPP
Agreement and that the Limitation of Damages section (Section 21 entitled
"Liability and Damages"), excludes "direct" damages.  I was wondering if
there was ever a discussion/vote on these issues.

No problem Richard. I hope the weather isn't too inclement - we've
only just begun here.....

I'll send along notes when complete. Incidentally, I will also
include minutes from last meeting - regrettably other issues have
kept me form completing them until this evening.

Warmest regards (no pun intended)

Dave

Thank you for you birthday call.  I appreciate your calls, even if we don't
get a chance to speak directly.

I was just wondering, do you have copies or negatives of the pictures that
were taken of us with Mom at Bob's house?  I think it was Thanksgiving.  I
would like to see them, maybe get some enlargements.  My friend Austin took
some, but I am afraid he may have lost them--I asked him recently in part
of an e-mail, and he did not answer the question.

Any plans for a visit when we could maybe get to the beach?

After our conference call last week, I received word from Reliant (who has 
offered to host our meetings) that they cannot do meetings on 7/30, 7/31, or 
8/1.  Please respond to this email and indicate whether you would be 
available on either  7/23 - 7/26  or  8/8 - 8/10.   Again, one day would be 
used for the Collateral Annex and the other for the optional provisoins to be 
used with the Master Agreement.  I have sent a separate messgage to the 
Collateral Annex Group.  Thank-you.

GREAT AUSTRALIAN SHIRAZ
On Monday, December 11th at 7pm, join SPEC's and The
Wine School for GREAT AUSTRALIAN SHIRAZ. We'll taste
and talk about 12 of the best Shiraz wines Australia has
to offer. Topics of discussion will include how Shiraz got
to Australia, how Australian Shiraz developed into the
wine it is today, how Aussie Shiraz differs from Syrah
wines made in France or the US, and the winemaking that
goes into producing the best of these uniquely Australian
wines. The anticipated lineup includes Clarendon Hills
Liandra Shiraz 1998, Langmeil Shiraz 1998, Penny's Hill
Shiraz 1997, Haan Shiraz 1998, St. Hallet's Old Block
Shiraz 1995, Ausvetia Shiraz 1996, Rosemount Hill of
Gold Shiraz 1998, Rosemount Balmoral Shiraz 1997,
d'Arenberg Dead Arm Shiraz 1998, and Penfold's RWT
Shiraz 1997 along with the two giants of Aussie Shiraz,
Henschke's Hill of Grace 1995 and Penfold's Grange
Hermitage 1995. GREAT AUSTRALIAN SHIRAZ will cost
$92.00 per person (cash) with a $10.00 discount available
for 1,000  SPEC's KEY Points. The high cost of this class
is due to the expense of the wines to be tasted. For
directions, reservations, or more information on this
class, please call SPEC's at 713-526-8787. This event will
be held at l'Alliance Francaise, 427  Lovett Boulevard
(on the southeast corner of Lovett and Whitney, one block
south of  Westheimer). The price includes SPEC's famous
5% discount for cash.

DECEMBER 2000 12-UNDER-$12
    Sometimes you don't need a "great" bottle of wine. Sometimes you just 
want a cheap bottle and it wouldn't bother you at all if it were to taste 
really good. We're in the same boat. We're always looking for wine that 
tastes like it costs more than it does, preferably wine priced under $12.00. 
So here are twelve of our favorites, all priced under $12.00.

LOUIS M. MARTINI Cabernet Sauvignon, California, 1998  (12x750ml $8.21 
$91.85)  Fine classic California Cabernet nose with notes of dusty oak, 
cedar, tobacco, and lots of fine black and red berry fruit. Super juicy with 
great fruit flavor in the mouth, a dusty, Napa-like texture, and a really 
nice medium-weight feel. The dusty fruit and tobacco notes last to the end. 
Martini is making perhaps the best buy available in a value-priced California 
Cabernet. Solidly Fine. SPEC's Score: 89+ points.

CAPEZZANO Montalbano Chianti DOCG 1997  (12x750ml $10.43 $115.49)  From the 
best modern Tuscan vintage on record, this is a nicely balanced, subtle, 
well-integrated Chianti featuring great cherry fruit and some ripe plum along 
with hints of tobacco and exotic wood. Rich and satisfying in the mouth, it 
is juicy with fruit and flavor. Good length. Finishes dry and slightly chewy. 
Delicious and Fine. SPEC's Score: 90 points.

BOUCHARD Pere & Fils "Le Chamville" Macon-Villages, 1999  (12x750ml $9.23 
$102.43)  Crisp, well-focused, nicely balanced Macon Chardonnay featuring 
good tropical and banana fruit with a refreshing citrusy acidity and an 
unexpected but welcome mineral note. Has enough richness to keep it 
interesting. Long and fresh tasting. Very Good. SPEC's Score: 86+ points.

BOUCHARD Pere & Fils "La Vignee" Bourgogne Pinot Noir, 1999  (12x750ml $9.23 
$102.43)  This well-balanced Burgundy Pinot Noir shows plenty of cherry fruit 
and hints of earth and mineral that start on the nose and expand onto the 
palate. The flavors are well-focused but there is a good level of richness.  
The finish really lasts and stays fresh to the end. Very tasty cheap Pinot; 
Really Very Good. SPEC's Score: 87+ points.

Ch. de la GREFFIERRE Macon la Roche Vineuse (Vielles Vignes) 1999 (12x750ml 
$10.40 $115.48)  Very nicely structured estate-bottled, old-vine Macon with 
nice mineral and terroir notes and good banana and pear fruit with a fresh 
tropical lime acidity that emerges through the subtle oak component. Quite 
tasty but a little sneaky; this is one of those wines that really grows on 
you while you?re drinking it. Fine. SPEC's Score: 89 points.

OXFORD LANDING Limited Release Grenache, South Australia, 1998  (12x750ml 
$8.86 $98.30)  Here?s a juicy, grapy, peppery, vibrantly fruity Grenache with 
just enough acid to keep it somewhat balanced. No complexity at all but its 
thrill is that it's a real fruit bomb. Quite fresh tasting but also solid and 
satisfying. Quite yummy; Really very good. SPEC's Score: 87+ points.

Ch. MEUNIER St. LOUIS, Corbieres, 1998 (12x750ml $9.45 $98.28) Here?s another 
super value in a 1998 from the south of France. This well-built 
Grenache-dominated red is chock full of juicy black grapy-berry fruit and 
subtle spice with a hint of Corbieres? earthy terroir. The wine is  balanced 
and fresh in the mouth with a fine, medium-weight feel and a softly chewy 
texture. The fruit and spice last through the fine finish. This one has both 
the fruit to handle a bit of spice and the stuffing to handle beef. Served 
cool (58-60o), it may be the perfect fajita wine. Fine. SPEC's Score: 90 
points.

PENFOLD's Koonunga Hill Chardonnay, Southeastern Australia, 1999  (12x 750ml 
$6.57 $73.45)  Really surprising for a value-priced (read cheap) Aussie 
Chardonnay, this Koonunga Hill has plenty of fruit but it is more in the 
green apple and green banana range than it is like the typical Aussie 
pineapple juice Chardonnay. The fruit is well complimented with a welcome 
mineral component and  enough acidity to keep everything fresh and balanced. 
Quite elegant with good length showing mineral-character and fruit that lasts 
to the end. Good food Chardonnay. Fine. SPEC's Score: 88 points.

M. TRINCHERO Merlot, California Coastal, 1997  (12x750ml $8.57 $95.79)  Soft 
textured, juicy, everyday-priced Merlot with plenty of ripe cherry Merlot 
fruit. Fresh and lively and full of flavor in a medium weight, very 
drinkable, well-balanced style. Simple but delicious, it makes a super party 
red. Really Very Good.  SPEC's Score: 87 points.

HOGUE Fume Blanc, Columbia Valley, 1999  (12x750ml $5.75 $64.25)  Very fresh 
tasting, refreshing Sauvignon Blanc with good crisp pear and lemon fruit, 
hints of green melon, and a touch of perfume (and no grassiness). Long and 
lively, it finishes dry. Good as an aperitif or with simple seafoods 
(especially oysters). Think of it as a sort of American Entree Deux Mers. 
Very Good. Spec's Score: 86 points.

MARTIN & WYRICH Moscato Allegro, California, 1999  (12x750ml $9.95 $111.30)  
This delicious Orange Muscat is fresh, bright, and alive with lots of 
perfumed orange blossom and honeysuckle fruit. Surprisingly lively despite 
its sweetness, this wine is quite fresh in the mouth with just a touch of 
frizzante. Long and balanced with a clean, lemon candy-like finish it is very 
refreshing and quite delicious. Fine. SPEC's Score: 88 points.

RAMOS PINTO Ruby Port, NV  (6x750ml $10.96 $60.03) Here?s a juicy, grapy red 
Port featuring a good mix of fruit and fire along with good weight and 
richness. The fruit is in the dark berry and grape juice range with just a 
touch of extra ripeness. This solid, everyday Port has the ability to keep 
for many weeks after the bottle is opened but enough flavor to make sure it 
is drunk sooner. Very Good. SPEC's Score: 87 points.

Special for SPEC's KEY holders: Buy a mixed case consisting of one 750ml 
bottle of each of our December 2000 12-Under-$12 selections for only $99.09, 
a savings of $8.52 over SPEC's already low cash bottle price.

Prices for these items and for the mixed case are good in all SPEC's stores. 
Prices are good through January 3, 2001. The "12x750ml" means the wine comes 
in 750ml bottles packed 12 to the case. The first price listed for each 
selection is the cash discounted bottle price. The second price listed is the 
cash discounted case price.

"Spec's"  is a service mark of the Spec's Family Partners, Ltd. and is 
registered with the State of Texas. Prices are subject to change without 
notice. Prices listed include a 5% discount for cash. "Cash" includes checks 
and debit cards when you enter your PIN#.

Elizabeth -- Three comments to consider:

In the first change, I think that I understand your change, but my impression 
was that "provided for in this Confirmation" was referring or tieing 
specifically to the "deal" defined in the Confirmation, therefore the change 
to say "may be agreed to" seems to weaken that reference.

On the 10th line, does adding the word "firm" in front of energy potentially 
conflict with the specific transaction if it is something more or something 
different than a simple firm deal.  Shouldn't the level of firmness be fully 
defined elsewhere in the confirm.

In (b), suggest adding some reference to quantity after your reference to 
timing along these lines:  " (b)  the starting and ending time and date, and 
the quantity of the release or interruption;"     Since partial quantity 
releases are possible/likely, probably even successive releases (due to 
gradual weather changes)  it would be equally as important to identify 
quantity and timing.  Example:  start with 200 MW for the month, release 50 
MW starting day 10 for balance of month, then another 50 MW over a weekend.

As always, thanks for your assistance. -- David

Attached is TVA language, to which I made a few changes.  Concept is fine, 
but before we start using and drop in confirm I will need to see the rest of 
a draft confirm that we use with TVA.

Dear Mark and Elizabeth:

We wanted to send you both a quick note highlighting the tremendous efforts 
that Janice Moore has contributed to two recent opportunities, namely the 
RFPs for Maine and Western Mass Electric standard offer service.   Both of 
these opportunities involved significant legal and commercial landmines that 
Janice was a key contributor in identifying and mitigating.   Unfortunately, 
due to legal/commercial risks and other factors associated with the formal 
RFP processes, we were not able to respond with conforming proposals to 
either of these opportunities.  Therefore, we wanted to make sure Janice's 
significant contributions on both of these efforts were duly recognized, 
despite no commercial deal being struck.  Importantly, we anticipate that 
there will be continued opportunities to acquire some of the wholesale load 
in Maine under commercial and legal terms that are satisfactory to Enron, and 
given her familiarity with our work in Maine to date, Janice will surely be 
able to provide valuable legal support as we pursue those follow-on 
opportunities.

Regards,
John Llodra and George Wood

I have discussed relocating Shari to Portland with both of you.  Elizabeth 
wanted to make sure that she had hired at least one additional attorney 
before Shari could move to Portland.  When I spoke to Mark earlier this week 
he indicated that January 1st  was a reasonable deadline.  I would like to 
get some closure/finality on this matter -- both from a business perspective 
and to allow Shari to know what the future holds.  Let me know your thoughts.

Every cheerful little deal has a sticky point.  On the PacifiCorp-EEI 
journey, we have finally stumbled onto ours.  They like Option A for closeout 
setoff, which limits everything to just the parties,  no affiliates and no 
other agreements.  We like Option  B which brings in the whole universe.  
They justify their position in a very confident manner by just assuming that 
any attorney worth his salt would just automatically know that as a REGULATED 
UTILITY they just can't go to Option B.  Then, they turn to me and say:  
"Christian, we thought you would know this.  How do you justify your position 
with PGE?"  At which point I act like it is no problem at all, but do not 
offer a reason.  We are going to have to get into the reasons with these 
guys.  Is there any regulated utility reason why we cannot use the broader 
setoff approach?  Please help me think about this and Steve, prehaps someone 
at your former firm could guide us here. ----cgy

Just a few comments on the basis of this week's discussion.

1.  Use concept of amounts owed and accrued, but not yet payable

2.  Include deemed designations

3.  Do we want to include concepts of (a) amounts in any currency (or is this 
implied) or (b) amounts in respect of any booking or payment office?

Leslie --Stuart Zisman is working to finalize a Purchase and Sale Agreement 
("P&SA") as to the New Albany plant and is trying to be fully informed  as to 
outstanding contracts in relation to the plant known to the legal's power 
trading group.  He will meet with a large group on this project at 11 a.m. 
this morning.  On information from the midmarket group, I have confirmed to 
him there are no trading contracts currently in effect, committing sales 
from  the plant.  He is also inquiring about a 'Station Service Agreement' or 
any other basic agreement(s) in effect  allowing the plant's operation 
(beyond those referenced in the P&SA --see Schedules 4.1(m) and 7.1 --I'll 
bring you a copy of these Schedules).   As you may have been involved when 
such contracts would have been negotiated or placed in effect, would you give 
Stuart any information you have on this at your soonest opportunity?  Thanks.

sent to C/Ps executing the EEI cover sheet with us. The cover sheet 
references an Attachement A as of the Effective Date (May 4, 2001) --please 
generate it (without prices ) e-mail a copy ot me and circulate it to 
NewPower with execution documents. Please arrange to have the EEI cover sheet

this matter in relation to sleeved transactions through EES).  Thanks.

David,

As this document stands, it is okay.  With respect to the QSE agreement, we 
will need to reinstate the New Power Holding's MACs since a $1MM line of 
credit will be extended to them under that agreement.  Those MACs were 
eliminated from the EEI since Enron is not extending credit under that 
agreement.

you work with Mary Cook to incorporate this agreement in the Master 
Cross-Product Netting....Agreement.  I would appreciate anything you can do 
to  move this along as EES will no longer be trading power and NPW needs to 
establish a power trading relationship with EPMI.

Reliant has offered to host the next meeting of the drafting committee at 
their Houston offices.  I have also been asked to set up a drafting meeting 
for the purpose of finishing the collateral annex.   The participants in that 
process would like to hold that meeting in July in Houston.  Reliant is 
willing to host that meeting as well.  Let me know if its ok to take Reliant 
up on their offer to host one or both meetings.  Also, would holding both 
meetings consecutively over two days make sense?    Would July work for both 
meetings for everyone?  Holding a meeting in July will give ample time to 
review suggested language and prepare comments.  Please let me know.

As a starting point for the optional provisions, I've attached the ones Dede 
handed out at our workshop.  We still need an electronic trading platform 
provision (Babak).

I agree with and support  what Tracy is saying in her message below. However, 
in one regard, I would say it a little differently.  Legal was not 
"instructed" by anyone to approve any confirms.  I discussed the deal with 
both John and Mike and it was my understanding that the long term deal was 
conditional upon Ashgrove signing the EEI.  To me, (and this is where I think 
my understanding was identical with Tracy's)  this meant that the long term 
deal would not be booked until the EEI was signed. I was led to believe that 
Ashgrove would indeed sign the paper yesterday and we faxed a complete set 
of   documents signed by Tim up to them in mid afternoon with instructions 
for them to return fully signed copies.     They did not sign the paper and 
the deal has been booked.  Somehow, our teamwork process didn't work and we 
got the booking ahead of the signing and this is a process issue which we 
must all strive to address more effectively.  ----cgy

Subject: Ash Grove Cement Company - deal booked without approval

John,

I am sending this email to document the incorrect process that commercial 
independently took in handling the long-term deal with Ash Grove Cement 
Company [EPMI sale of 6MW (3MW in Jan/Feb); 7X24; 7/1/02 thru 6/30/07; fixed 
$42.25/MWh].

Credit and Legal worked diligently to expedite the due diligence/credit 
review and legal contract crafting of an EEI for Ash Grove Cement.  Credit 
also stated that based on the proposed credit terms in the EEI contract to 
support the terms in the transaction, there would be NO credit reserve for 
this deal so long as it is confirmed under the EEI.  

Credit had already approved a shorter term deal without any credit terms 
[EPMI sale of 6MW; 7X24; 10/1/2001 thru 6/30/2002; fixed $88.25/MWh] to be 
confirmed under a general long-term confirm.  Credit however required that 
the longer term deal be confirmed under an EEI with good legal and credit 
terms given the tenor of the transaction.

Yesterday, you agreed to the conditions and you/Mike Swerzbin informed me (in 
Tim Belden's presence) that the long term deal was not going in the system 
until the contract was executed.  However, somehow, Legal was instructed to 
approve TWO confirms to go out.

Consequently, to my dismay, the deal was booked yesterday evening.  My 
response to the blatant disregard for 'correct processes' is as follows:
- Should Credit/Legal work expeditiously for firedrill transactions that are 
not followed through with correctly? please keep in mind that other 
marketers' commercial requests are re-prioritized when a firedrill is coming 
through;
- Should Credit "trust" a marketer when a marketer informs Credit that the 
process is being handled correctly?
- Should Credit continue to stand by the 'no credit reserve quote'?
- Is this fair when other marketers are working hard to get contracts in 
place and to follow the process accordingly?
- How can we correct this process going forward?  I think that Credit and 
Legal handled the process in the most commercially sensitive manner; however, 
commercial decided to independently go against process control.

Comments are welcome.

Tracy

Alas, no agreement to execute at this point.  We have come a long way, 
however, and only 2 serious issues remain open.  (All the others are at least 
mostly resolved -- see my 5/1/01 revision w/ marginal notes made during my 
5/2/01 meeting w/ them.)  This file is in my office with all the others.

XOM requires that all of its contracts contain 2 provisions, both of which 
are problematic for Enron.

(1)  The Federal Contractor Supplement -- exhibit F to the EEI Master -- is 
designed to assure XOM's compliance w/ the U.S. federal government's 
requirements imposed on all government contractors.  There are 2 categories 
of requirements:  environmental laws compliance and small business 
participation in federal govt purchases of goods and services.  Since XOM has 
adoped a "General Commercial Plan" to comply with such requirements, XOM has 
promised the U.S. govt that ALL its contracts will contain these provisions.  
And that's what the auditors from the U.S. government would be looking to 
ascertain in a review of XOM's compliance.  As for Enron, we do engage in 
business w/ the U.S. govt, but we have not adopted a "General Commercial 
Plan," so we have to address these issues on an ad hoc basis.  Taking the 
last paragraph of this Supplement as an example (addressing the use of women 
and minority owned businesses by Enron in supplying services to XOM under 
this contract), at this point, Enron isn't really prepared to undertake such 
things and all those I dealt with on this seem a bit nervous about Enron's 
ability to comply.  I've communicated w/ Michelle Cash, George Wasaff, and 
Cathy Riley (at Calvin Eakins direction) on this topic, and I asked Cathy 
Riley to have her director, Calvin Eakins, phone me to discuss this further, 
but he did not call.  And there does not seem to be a very good solution to 
this.  XOM has suggested revising the language in Sec. 10.13 (based on my 
5/1/01 draft) to add a final sentence "The Federal Contract Supplement is 
attached as Exhibit F and each Party shall comply with such requirements to 
the extent appplicable."  This certainly takes care of all of XOM's concerns, 
but I'm not sure this gets Enron all the way where we need to be.  See, for 
example, Dave Nutt's markup of the environmental provisions (in the file), 
and Cathy Riley says there are no exceptions or exemptions to the small 
business requirements.  We might be able to get some outside expertise on 
this or get Sharon Butcher to help resolve it.

(2)  Limitation of Damages -- Article 7 waives consequentials, etc. for both 
parties.  XOM insists that this provision must carve out damages resulting 
from the "gross negligence and/or willful misconduct attributable to its 
managerial and senior supervisory personnel".  You can see the full details 
of the provisions they're looking for in the XOM language in sec 10.4 (same 
draft), the extensive indemnity language which they added in the last round 
and which we generally don't mind giving them.  But this impacts Article 7 
because the Enron version of the waiver expressly states that the waiver 
applies to indemnities, and, of course, XOM will not tolerate any exceptions 
to the liability of each party (yes, it's mutual) for the gross negligence of 
its managers, etc.  There's a true story behind all this that dates back to 
the EPA emissions requirements on Reformulated Gasoline (RFG).  Mobil hired a 
lab to do the testing, the managers of the lab company encouraged the testing 
staff to "fudge" the results, tons of RFG hit the market that was not in 
compliance, and a huge black mark on Mobil and zillions of dollars lost were 
the result.  And the contract provided that the lab's damages were limited to 
the testing fees, and apparently, that worked for the lab company.  So, it's 
a deal breaker for XOM  b/c they say that if Enron's managers decide to turn 
off the lights at all the refineries for some specious reason, they need to 
have proper recourse against Enron.   I''ve argued with them about this, 
based on the nature of this contract, the power trading business, etc. but to 
no avail .....  It would seem that Enron's language in Art. 7, w/ the 
following rather narrow change, might work for both parties, but it's up to 
you, now.
 UNLESS EXPRESSLY HEREIN PROVIDED, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE FOR 
CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, LOST 
PROFITS OR OTHER BUSINESS INTERRUPTION DAMAGES, BY STATUTE, IN TORT OR 
CONTRACT, UNDER ANY INDEMNITY PROVISION OR OTHERWISE provided, however, that 
nothing in this Article 7 shall be interpreted to limit either Party's 
liability under Article 10.4(b).  
Let me know if you have any questions about this.  
Regards,
Janice

Another day, another subpoena.  This one is from the CPUC's investigation and 
is directed to the CAISO.  Based on the requests in this subpoena, it looks 
as if the CPUC is not looking at the power marketers, but is focused on the 
in-state generators and the frequency, veracity and impact of their planned 
and forced outages.

Attached is the draft which now incorporates some comments Janelle gave me 
today.  Could you please advise as to the following: 

1. The LDC is the Default Provider, not NEPOOL. Are there any additional 
changes you would make because of this? I am sure that Sections 2 and 3 are 
affected somehow. What are your thoughts on the best way to capture this? 

2. In Section 9 under (a), she wants to allude to the fact that if the 
Congestion Management System comes into effect, then we will be "assigned 
their load". I kind of get what she is talking about but have no idea what to 
say about it. What would you recommend?

If you want, just fax to me the pages on which you have corrections. My fax 
no is (503) 464-8058. 

Thanks, 

Shari

Davis is moving at warp speed on bonds, too.  (No doubt this is connected 
with the state being placed on credit watch.)




Calif Pwr Bond May Be Delayed Until Aug - Gov. Advisor 


Updated: Friday, April 20, 2001 03:29 PM?ET 


?




NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--California's planned issue of $12 billion to $14 
billion in revenue bonds to finance the state's cost of buying power could be 
delayed until August, an advisor to Gov. Gray Davis said Friday. 
The issue for now appears to be proceeding on schedule, but delays could come 
from regulatory appeals by California's utilities, which have objected to the 
details of plans to service the debt with revenue collected from their 
ratepayers, the advisor said. 








?

"We hope it will be done this summer," said the advisor. "I think (the state 
treasurer) has said June. It might slip to July or August." 
The advisor said the issue's timing is ultimately up to State Treasurer Phil 
Angelides. A formal timeline for the issue hasn't been set, but a 
spokesperson for the treasurer said Angelides' June target hasn't changed. 
"That is still our operating goal," the spokesperson said. "We have not 
revised those or pushed those back because of the appeals." 
The state plans to use the revenue from the bonds to stretch out its costs of 
buying power in lieu of California's hamstrung utilities and to repay the 
state's general fund for power already purchased. The state has spent $4.4 
billion in general fund money on power since mid-January, a number growing by 
more than $70 million a day. 
The general-fund outlays technically are loans that carry interest charges. 
Nevertheless, delays in the bond issue may bring increased pressure from 
those concerned about the state's exposure, the advisor said. 

California's Department of Water Resources, which is handling the state's 
power purchases, will need to cover 41% of the 192 million megawatt-hours 
expected to be consumed by the state's largest utilities in 2001, the advisor 
said. 
The DWR's long-term contracts cover just over a third of that total, leaving 
the department to buy 48 million megawatt-hours of electricty - 25% of the 
utilities' demand - in the spot market, the advisor said. 
Western power for delivery this summer is trading at $400/MWh to $500/MWh, 
and power for the fourth quarter is trading at $200/MWh to $300/MWh. 
The DWR's spot-market purchases will fall to 14% in 2002, according to the 
Davis team's projections, the advisor said. 
As reported, Angelides has said that with power prices at $250/MWh, the 
planned bond issue will only cover the state's power purchases through 
September. The details of the DWR's power contracts and revenue requirements, 
however, haven't been released. Davis' advisor said they point to a much 
lower cost of power, one that can be managed with a bond issue in the lower 
end of the $12 billion to $14 billion range and without higher rates. 
"We project the financing mechanism will actually be in surplus by 2003," the 
adviser said. "We do have the tools to moderate this." 
If prices rise to "unreasonable levels," the state may opt to turn the lights 
out rather than pay them, the adviser said. 
"At some point, a decision will be made as a policy matter whether to pay the 
extra price or do a rolling blackout," he said. 
Outsiders are less optimistic than the state. Analysts continue to question 
the state's projections, and ratings agencies have put California's credit 
ratings on watch for a downgrade in light of the mounting power costs. 

Massive wholesale power costs have already crippled the state's two largest 
utilities, which haven't been able to recover $14 billion from customers, 
whose rates are frozen. PG&E Corp. (PCG, news, msgs) unit Pacific Gas & 
Electric Co. filed for bankruptcy-law protection April 6, and Edison 
International (EIX, news, msgs) unit Southern California Edison is insolvent. 
Last week, Southern California Edison and the DWR reached a memorandum of 
understanding under which the state would buy the utility's transmission 
lines and help it issue bonds to recover its uncollected power costs. 
The governor's negotiators plan to submit drafts of legislation need to 
implement the agreement to lawmakers next week. The drafts include 
authorization for the utilities to recover their power costs through bonds 
backed by a specified portion of their rates, authorization for the state to 
buy the utility's transmission lines and a variety of amendments to existing 
laws needed to facilitate the deal. 
"We will deliver the draft legislation to the Legislature early next week," 
one of the governor's legislative advisers said. 
The MOU requires the Legislature to act by Aug. 15, but Davis hopes to get 
the package through in four to six weeks. That may be optimistic. Republicans 
fiercely oppose the plan, as do a number of key Democrats who see it as a 
bailout. As reported, a number of lawmakers think ratepayers might be better 
off with Southern California Edison in bankruptcy. 
Davis met with lawmakers this week and is talking with the Senate leadershp 
to put together a small team to work through the bills, the legislative 
advisor said. The governor's negotiators are also in talks with lawmakers to 
add the measures to existing bills, namely a transmission-line buyout bill 
introduced months ago by Senate President Pro Tem John Burton and a broader 
bill introduced by Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg. So far, however, the 
governor hasn't found a backer. 
"We are having discussions, but we haven't identified the vehicle or the 
authors at this point," the legislative advisor said. 
Lawmakers have said the terms of the state's agreement with Southern 
California Edison will have to be altered, raising another roadblook for the 
deal. As reported, Edison has said the agreement must pass "as is," although 
the governor has expressed a willingness to negotiate. 
The governor's adviser said Friday any changes would have to maintain the 
balance of interests struck in the MOU. 
"If the Legislature wants to improve on it, it must keep that balance," he 
said. "(The governor) doesn't want the balance to be tipped in either 
direction." 
The governor's negotiators began discussions Monday with Sempra Energy (SRE, 
news, msgs) unit San Diego Gas & Electric for a similar deal, but had nothing 
to report. 
The parties were to meet again Friday and next week, and the governor hoped 
to reach agreement in the "next several weeks," the advisor said.

FYI -- Spoke to Rogers this a.m. and told him that you and I are all over 
this deal.  He was glad -- says there's "real money" in this deal.  Joe says 
that PSEG language should be here today.

Also, for Edith and Posey, I have attached the new MW/Heat Rate schedule.

Terri;

Attached are two draft contracts.

The first contract is for the Schedule K - Participation Power Purchase,
with a fixed price block of energy for $64 MWh, and capacity at $4,666.67
MW-Month (or $28-Kw season).  The repricing provisions are based off of a
loss of system resources of greater than 150 MW, with the units identified.

The second contract is for the Financially Firm Energy.  I structured this a
little differently than what I originally anticipated, based on a discussion
with Tim and how the ASC views "financially firm" accredited products.
Since EPRI wants to be able to accredit this transaction, the best way to
deal with the financial firm energy seemed to be by pulling it out and
putting it into an exhibit.  I'm open to discussion on this if EPMI has a
alternative way that they would like to see.  Also, please note that per our
discussion on Friday, December 1, I added a contingency into this document
that Split Rock and EPMI must enter into a Master Agreement by December 15
or the agreement will be void.

		 Subject: Proposed Changes Based on California Energy Shortages

Over the past several months, we have reviewed in detail our trading 
contracts and the companies through which we conduct our trading business in 
California.  In order to reduce Enron's non-market risks ( e.g. legal, credit 
and regulatory) in the volatile commodity markets in California or any " 
future California", we propose the following changes:

1.    Mandatory Uniform Set-Off Provisions in All Trading Contracts for All 
Commodities -- set-off language varies commodity by commodity in trading 
contracts.  Set-off is one of the most critical tools available to Enron in a 
major default situation and it is critical to have set-off language and to 
have it be uniform commodity to commodity so that Enron can get the best 
advantage from set-off and not just the least common denominator.

2.     Mandatory Master Netting Agreements For Counterparties With Multiple 
Masters With Significant Opposite Exposures -- where it is necessary to have 
multiple masters with a counterparty, a "bridge" should be put place between 
the masters whenever there is significant opposite exposures under the two or 
more masters.

3.     Merge EPMI into ENA -- power trades are done through EPMI.  Merging 
EPMI into ENA and conducting power trades through ENA is much more efficient 
from both a credit and legal point of view.

4.     No Automatic Termination for a Bankruptcy Event -- 

Let me know if you have any other proposed changes to our trading contracts 
or entities through which we conduct our trading.  I believe these changes 
will (i) improve efficiency, (ii) reduce risks, (iii) develop the opportunity 
to do more business with certain counterparties and (iv)substanially improve 
Enron's position in the next California type market.  The long range goal is 
conduct as much as possible of the trading business through a single entity 
and a single or limited number standardized agreements.

Per conversation with christian, and prior discussions with cadwalader i 
think the memo of cad is off on cross default too.  i had noted such on my 
first read.  i thought what we were after was if one leg is set aside in a 
bankruptcy then all legs are "set aside" this being different than 
defaulted.  Mary

Subject: Re: PA wholesale vs. retail prices  

The short answer is yes.  Both Duquesne and GPU have divested their 
generation assets, and both have already suffered problems with their POLR 
service.  

The implicit reason for the GPU-First Energy merger is that GPU has lost 
hundreds of millions over the last two years (and promises to do so 
indefinitely without help) providing POLR service.  First Energy can offer 
both hedging help, but generation in off-peak times (only off-peak because of 
system congestion in PJM).  Enron has an opportunity here to do some good 
things.  However, from a credit perspective, we should be aware that GPU is 
in a risky position.

Duquesne divested of their generation selling their assets to 
Orion/Constellation.  In turn, Duquesne contracted with Orion to provide 
energy to meet their load.  As part of this contract, Duquesne did two things 
that are questionable from a business perspective.  When turning over their 
assets to Orion, they also transferred the FTRs to Orion.  Thus, Duquesne's 
load no longer holds the FTRs making it difficult to hedge transmission 
risk.  Second, Duquesne did not contract for capacity.  For this reason, they 
are having problems joing an RTO because they have no capacity resources, and 
Orion is holding them hostage over this issue--expecting a large capcity 
payment.  Without some rectification, Duquesne is in conflict with both PJM's 
rules and PJM West's proposed rules.

For this reason, there is an opportunity in this effort.

I appreciate the succinct summary and lead time and we will get our thoughts 
to you on Friday.----cgy

Yoder/HOU/ECT@ECT

Subject: Forward Index Position

We potentially have a huge exposure associated with forward index sales in 
California.  If the FERC implements a "soft cap" then the index that they 
post will not exceed this "soft cap" even if the PX (for PX markets) or the 
ISO (for the ex post market) buys a material quantity of energy above the 
"soft cap" price.  The FERC is likely to implement either a $100 or $150 
"soft cap."  Let's say the FERC implements a $100 "soft cap."  It is likely 
that there would be 20,000 MW of demand at that price and perhaps 5,000 MW of 
supply (I made these numbers up).  I am not sure how the PX would allocate 
its scarce supply -- a logical way would be pro rata which means that each 
buyer would be awarded 25% of its bid.  So let's say we were short 100 MW of 
index and went to buy it back from the PX each day.  We would have to submit 
bids for 400 MW in hopes of getting 100 MW.  Eventually buyers would bid for 
many multiples of their load, driving demand up while supply remains fixed 
thus lowering the percentage that each buyer receives.  To fix this problem, 
the PX could limit the amount that you could bid for in their market based on 
how much load you serve.  EES might argue that they can bid since it is their 
load.  Long story short -- their are lots of ways for this to explode into a 
big problem for us and only a few ways for things to turn out fine.

Here's what I'd like to do.  First, I would like to get a download of all 
Index Forward deals currently on the books for delivery starting in January 
of 2001.  I want to see all important deal attributes in a spreadsheet.  I 
think that the result of this process will be that we are short up to a 
couple of hundred MW of index power in California over the next two years.  
Bob Badeer will lead that effort.  Then, I need to understand what our legal 
position is with respect to the FERC, ISO, and PX redefining the index.  Do 
our contracts give us an out if the index materially changes in a way so that 
it no longer reflects a competitive market clearing price where supply and 
demand balance?  Christian Yoder should be the point person on that effort.  
Thanks for your help on this matter.  I will be out of the office on 
Wednesday, Thursday, and most of Friday.  I would like some answers to this, 
to the extent that anwers are knowable on the legal side, by Friday.

Melissa -- The redlined confirmation below shows the language resolved after 
discussion with Dana as to what is being traded by the market participants. 
Going forward, the insert is to be placed in confirmations with a NEPOOL PTF 
Delivery Point where delivery will occur at or after 1/1/03, including 
confirmations issued in relation to EOL trading.   Please call me with any 
questions.  Thanks. --David

Dana -- Attached is a draft confirmation template with text inserted in the 
Delivery Point section to treat the multi-settlement issue you identified.  
Dan Alleghretti worked with me to put this together, and believes that 
multi-settlement would not be implemented before 1/1/03.  The text is 
intended to balance Buyer's and Seller's intersests so that it can be placed 
in confirmations where EPMI is Buyer or Seller.  Please come back to me your 
comments or I will stop by your desk with a hard copy later this morning so 
that we can discuss.  --David

Sorry about that, I assumed Janice was taking care of it while we were at the 
legal conference and she did not tell me otherwise.  By copy of this to 
Marcus, he can let me know if he can look at it or if I should re-assign.

		 Subject: New language needed for Nepool trades

Hello, Dana Davis (Vice President of trading) just informed me of some new 
language that needs to be added to our confirmation letters for deals done at 
NEPOOL PTF (this is the delivery point).  The language he gave me is as 
follows:

In the event that multi settlement is implemented then NEPOOL PTF becomes 
seller's choice. (I am sure this needs to be worded differently)

I told Dana that I would have to run this language through one of the 
attorneys.  He said they could call him and he would explain further.

He also wants this language added to the NEPOOL PTF product on Enron Online 
(this would not be for NEPOOL ICAP deals, installed capacity).

I copied Marcus on this e-mail but I am not certain if he would be the 
correct person to work on this or not.  Dana would like to start adding this 
language as soon as possible.

Thanks,
Melissa

Hi Liz -- I talked to Grant today and he told me you guys will be heading
to Washington for Christmas and for your sister's wedding.  We wish it
would have worked out for you to come to the big D but understand.  He also
filled me on on your unstoppable ascendancy to the top of the charts of
your club's tennis elite.  I'm not surprised and good luck.  Do you yell
every time you hit the ball yet?

We'll be working on a country weekend in January for us all to get together
in the beautiful Hico, Texas area.  As the realtors say, it is the "top of
the hill country".

Elizabeth -

I had a conversation with Carol yesterday about her new responsibilities 
helping the trading desk.  She mentioned that it was still up in the air as 
to her exact responsibilities and mentioned a staff meeting tomorrow.  I was 
hoping you could clarify for me (and I am sure everyone in Portland) if she 
will be dedicated to the West or also be working on East projects.

Would the drafting commitee and representative credit managers be interested 
in meeting in New York City on December 14 to discuss credit annex draft.  
Bill McCoy is giving a brown bag discussion on trading documentation at a law 
firm in NYC and perhaps we could meet with him afterwards?  Let me know asap 
and I'll ask Marving Goldstein, a partner at the firm, if we can meet after 
the brown bag.  Of course, that depends on Bill's availability too.

Leslie -- attached is an agreement Enron needs to execute.  Can you initial 
for us?  We need to do this ASAP since Keith needs to set up some training 
sessions with SPP.  It may be that Jim Steffes (VP) for Corp. or Kevin Presto 
should execute for EPMI.  Thanks.

After I wrote this I was forwarded Steve Hall's summary.  There's some=20
redundancy but hopefully, this provides a few more details.    Also, Mary H=
.=20
and I are informed that on Friday the FERC issued an order that appears to=
=20
approve the ISO=01,s request in full.

Bullet Summary of the ISO's Amendment No. 33 (December 8 Filing):

The following is a summary of the filing made by the ISO.

1) ISO=01,s $250/MWh Soft Cap
a) Summarized: ISO Claims its proposal is identical to the FERC proposed so=
ft=20
cap but raises the soft cap level to $250 from the $150/MWh proposed by the=
=20
FERC: =01&The ISO would replace the current cap on Imbalance Energy bids wi=
th an=20
interim =01&soft=018 price cap based on the price mitigation proposal in th=
e=20
Commission=01,s November 1 Order. The ISO=01,s scheduling system will not r=
eject=20
Energy bids priced in excess of the $250/MWh price cap, but will evaluate=
=20
those bids in price merit order. However, if the ISO issues Dispatch=20
instructions to Scheduling Coordinators for Energy that has been bid in=20
excess of the $250 soft cap, those bids will not set the Market Clearing=20
Price for Imbalance Energy. Rather, those Scheduling Coordinators will be=
=20
paid in accordance with their bids.=018

b) Refund risk and cost documentation above $250. =01&Imbalance Energy abov=
e the=20
level of the soft price cap would be subject to refund, based on subsequent=
=20
review by the Commission. It also should require Scheduling Coordinators th=
at=20
submit such bids to supply supporting cost information to the Commission, a=
s=20
well as to the ISO and to the California Electricity Oversight Board so tha=
t=20
they may bring questionable bids to the Commission=01,s attention.

i) Appears to imply that the proposed reporting requirement is supplemental=
=20
to what was requested by the FERC. See p. 8

ii) Regarding production costs:  fuel, taxes, emission credits, startup cos=
ts=20
are all listed as costs.  However, no mention of noncontiguous scheduling=
=20
costs or reasonable profit.

iii) Quasi safe harbor on opportunity costs:  In a footnote to cover letter=
,=20
ISO states it will particularly scrutinize any opportunity costs in excess =
of=20
10% of the production costs or $25/MWh, whichever is lesser.

c) Useful quote: =01&In light of current fuel prices and the ISO=01,s recen=
t=20
experience in receiving less than a thousand MW of Imbalance Energy bids at=
=20
prices of $150 or less in many hours, the ISO believes that a $150 soft cap=
=20
would be tantamount to procuring all Imbalance Energy on an as-bid basis.=
=018

d) Effective date: 4 p.m. PST 12/8/00.=20

e) Term of this soft cap:  lesser of 3 mo (3/8/01) or whenever the Commissi=
on=20
supercedes it by its own order.

f) Applicable tariff sections.  Section 2.5.23.2 and .3.  See attachments=
=20
A1/B1 to the filing.


2) Participating Generator Penalties
a) Summary: =01&the ISO proposes in Amendment No. 33 to assess penalties ag=
ainst=20
Participating Generators that refuse to operate in response to an ISO=20
Dispatch instruction during a System Emergency or when the ISO is acting to=
=20
avoid an imminent or threatened System Emergency. They would be charged an=
=20
amount equal to twice the highest price that the ISO paid for Energy for ea=
ch=20
hour in which the Participating Generator failed to respond. In addition, i=
f,=20
during that hour, the ISO curtailed Load to manage a System Emergency other=
=20
than Load that has not been designated by agreement or regulation as=20
interruptible, the Participating Generator would pay an additional penalty =
of=20
$1000/MWh for the Energy that it failed to deliver.=018
b) Allowed excuse:  The penalties would not apply if the Participating=20
Generator has notified the ISO (within the hour of instruction), and=20
subsequently demonstrates (documentation within 72 hours) , that its=20
Generating Unit, System Unit or System Resource was physically unable to=20
operate or that operation would violate a legal restriction that could not =
be=20
waived.

c) Applicable tariff sections. Amends portions of 5.6.1 .2 and .3. See=20
attachments A2/B2 to the filing.

d) Effective date: Same as the ISO=01,s new soft cap: 4 p.m. PST 12/8/00

e) Term:  I did not see any sort of sunset provision.

3) Load Imbalance Penalties

a) Summary: =01&Scheduling Coordinators who rely on that  market to serve t=
heir=20
Loads the ISO=01,s costs of obtaining Energy through bids above the propose=
d=20
soft price cap or through out-of-market Dispatches when bids are=20
insufficient. Specifically, those costs would be allocated to Scheduling=20
Coordinators in proportion to their Demand that appears unscheduled in=20
real-time (underscheduled Load) and Generation that is scheduled but does n=
ot=20
appear in real-time, except to the extent that the underscheduled Load or=
=20
undelivered Generation is balanced within the Scheduling Coordinator=01,s=
=20
portfolio.=018  The costs of dispatching units that have bid above the Mark=
et=20
Clearing Price for Energy to Scheduling Coordinators in proportion to their=
=20
Net Negative Uninstructed Deviations (in essence, the amount by which their=
=20
metered Demand exceed their metered Generation). Cover letter, p. 10.=20

b) Net Negative Uninstructed Deviation (NNUD) defined: =01&The real time ch=
ange=20
in Generation or Demand associated with underscheduled Load (i.e., Load tha=
t=20
appears unscheduled in real time) and overscheduled Generation (i.e.,=20
Generation that is scheduled in forward markets and does not appear in real=
=20
time). Deviations are netted for each BEEP Interval, apply to a Scheduling=
=20
Coordinator=01,s entire portfolio, and include Load, Generation, Imports an=
d=20
Exports=018


c) Applicable tariff sections. Amends portions of  11.2.4.2.1.  See=20
attachments A3/A3/B3 to the filing.

d) Effective date:  For loads scheduled for  12/12/00.  (Essentially, loads=
=20
scheduled on 11/11 for next day).

e) Term:  I did not see any sort of sunset provision.


4) Useful Info from the Detmers Declaration

a) =01&During the recent 7-day period from December 1, 2000 through Decembe=
r 7,=20
2000, planned Generating Unit outages have averaged roughly 4,000 MW. Durin=
g=20
this same 7-day period, forced or unplanned outages of generating have be=
=20
very high, averaging approximately 7,000 MW. =01&
b) =01&For example, for the last four days (December 4, 2000 to December 7,=
=20
2000) we have purchased 255,000 MWh of OOM Energy. The cost of these=20
purchases were approximately $167 million. MWh.=018  (Equivalent to an aver=
age=20
OOM cost of $655/MWh.)

Mike,

     I noticed that there is not an indemnity provision in the WSPP
Agreement and that the Limitation of Damages section (Section 21 entitled
"Liability and Damages"), excludes "direct" damages.  I was wondering if
there was ever a discussion/vote on these issues.

If PG&E's LOCs are related to the now cancelled long term power trades, they 
clearly should not be renewed. What are the SCE LOCs for?

I spoke with Richard and we will have to renew.  He is currently trying to 
get the PX bankruptcy court to allow us  to take back our security in light 
of the FERC ruling re chargebacks, but due to uncertainty of the FERC ruling, 
court has not been willing to allow us to remove. Richard continues on the 
case.  In the meanwhile, the PX/bankruptcy court will not allow the LC's to 
expire without drawing down.  So we should go ahead and renew.

Subject: Sysco

Attached below is the Sysco contract revised as discussed together with a 
redlined version marked to show the changes from the version sent to Sysco.  
The revisions reflect the points negotiated with Sysco and "lessons learned" 
from the current situation in California.   Sysco has not yet seen these 
revisions.

The following list summarizes the significant issues for presentation to the 
organization (including Don Black and Sean Holmes) and/or reflect differences 
from the standard form.

Section 3.4  has been revised to make it bilateral except for subsection (d) 
which remains applicable only to EESI.  The standard form permitted only EESI 
to exercise a right of termination.  Accordingly, subsection (a) has been 
revised to delete the phase addressing the tariff risks which is now 
addressed in the revised definitions for Distribution Charges, Transition 
Charges and Special Utility Charges.  
Revised Section 3.4 provides that a change in "Utility rates or Taxes is not 
a change that allows a party to invoke the provision.  
Revised Section 3.4 provides the parties with a right to terminate the 
contract for convenience after the 36th month.  An Early Termination payment 
based on the "cost to cover" is applicable.  
Sysco is permitted to close a facility under new Section 3.5 and pay the 
Early Termination Payment applicable to the closed facility based on the 
"cost to cover."
Sysco is permitted to substitute facilities under new Section 3.6 and 
transfer the consumption volumes applicable to a facility that is Closed, 
Disposed, or Non-Controlled as long as the substituted facility has, in 
EESI's reasonable opinion, substantially similar load profile and consumption 
of, and demand charges for power as the facility for which it is being 
substituted, and is served by the same utility.
Consistent with the form, Sysco's consumption outside of the 90%-110% 
Anticipated Usage band would result in Sysco's paying the additional costs 
resulting from the difference between the contract price and the market 
price.  However, under the revised contract (Sections 2.2.1 and 2.2.2), if 
the price difference results in cost savings, a credit will be issued to 
Sysco.  We should confirm that we have the capability to make these 
calculations.  Also under the revised contract, the 90%-110% band is 
calculated for groups of facilities served by the same utility (the Facility 
Group).
Section 4.5 has been revised to obligate Sysco to post a letter of credit (at 
EESI's request) if Sysco Corporation's credit rating falls below investment 
grade.  The letter of credit would be in an amount equal to (i) the amount 
equivalent to the Early Termination Payment as of the date of the requested 
letter of credit; plus (ii) three months receivables.

Please do not hesitate to contact either Mike Smith or me with questions.  dwa

So great is the humor about all this WSPP stuff and the tennis backdrop that 
I would be willing to "come out of retirement" and enter the doubles combat 
zone.  The thought of Clyde Durham, itinerant journeyman, former Bible School 
doubles player from Kansas, striding on to the court to do battle with that 
little runt of a MIke Small,  this fuels my competitive imagination to the 
point of red hot coals.    I need to go see my cousin in Boulder and could 
work something in around this event. If there is room for me to go to the 
WSPP meeting, not the full camp thing, and you don't mind,  consider me in.

done  ... and not just that; I'm cruising the internet, investigating the 
Broadmoor's "professional" tennis camp for the weekend of August 10, 11, 12 
and booking rooms.  I asked for 4.  How's your game?

In the meanwhile I've been trying to call you but I can't get through to 
Portland.  Is it raining there?  Give me a call.

Steve/Christian,

The attached file is a draft of an asset management agreement prepared by Stu 
Zisman.  The later version obviously contained more negotiated points, so I 
think this one is more helpful.

I'm working on a transaction now which involves serving load as well as 
selling power. I found this one helpful for issue identification and 
exculpatory language, however.  


Kay

I think Lisa's suggestion is a very positive way to get others involved in
the process as well as working through issues that credit managers may
raise
when they read through the proposed credit annex.

Hey Elizabeth.

Well I'm not sure when we will be able to make up the game.  I was out of 
town last week and am in St Louis as I write this to you.  I will be here 
till Friday and then back again on Sunday night until the end of the week.  I 
saw Dan yesterday during lunch and he reminded me of it too... he knows my 
situation so I think he will understand if we end up not playing until the 
new year.  I wish we could play it before then but it doesn't look like my 
schedule will accomodate it... I am also leaving for NY on the 25th for Xmas 
with Bryan's family till the 2nd.  

Hope all is well with you and your family.  Thanks for getting in contact 
with me... I am in way over my head not only with snow tonight :) but with 
work and school.  

Are you going out of town for Xmas?  

Don't practice too much... I haven't played in weeks so I am back to square 
one... I think Dan might have to show me what a racket looks like again!!!!!

Take care and I will keep you up to date on what's happening with my schedule 
and when we can get together.

Char

Hi Charlotte

Hope you had a good trip last week.  Work has been horrendous - power and gas 
prices are decimating my free time - hope EES commercial is not suffering the 
same onslaught.

When would be a good time to play (Dan keeps reminding me to finish up the 
tournament) This week looks bad, but I maybe could play this weekend (less 
preferable) or Monday, Tuesday (need to get baby-sitting but likely doable) 
or Wed next week.  Let me know what works for you.

See ya

Very interesting.  We are coming to an inevitable point.  The industry wants 
a standard agreement.  Agreement is expressed in the singular.  There cannot 
be two standard agreements, it defeats the whole idea of set off  and 
consistency.  I see the Newport session as perhaps akin to Fort Sumter 
itself.  Somebody has got to step up to the big public plate and fire a 
massive broadside at the WSPP and get it started.  Only one can survive.  Or, 
I can hear that weazely politician saying,  "why can't we have a "western 
EEI?"   ----cgy

Andy,

We still have some internal work to do before we can say whether there is
any chance BPA will use the EEI contract in the future.  Personally, I think
this depends largely on what the prevailing industry trading arrangements
are, and that seems to be the WSPP agreement right now.  But our eyes and
ears are open.  I will be attending the conference and expect it to be very
informative.  Thanks for sending out the brochure.

Here's the final conference brochure.  The last panel of the day has a
comparison of the EEI and the WSPP and what the future holds for each.  If
you were inclined, having your thoughts on which agreement the BPA would
likely embrace in the future would be helpful.  If you speak, you get to
attend the entire conference for free.  Also, please feel free to pass the
brochure on to any counterparties in the west that you think would benefit.
FYI, if there is enough interest we can try to arrange getting additional
rooms at the Four Seasons at the conference rate.  If that is not an option,
there is a Mariott that we have a national account w/ that is only 5 minutes
from the Four Seasons.  If we get enough overflow we will guarantee the
Mariott a block of rooms to get a discount rate.  I

I'm hoping to come to Newport, but am not yet sure it will work out.  What
did you have in mind re: the EEI presentation?  (It looks like you have some

I don't have a final brochure on this, but here is a draft.  I've also
attached my law review article on the EEI Contract.  I can't recall if I
gave you  one at the WSPP meeting in S.F.  Hope all is going well.  If BPA
would like me to do a separate presentation on the EEI Contract, I can
arrange that as well.

Seems that Rogers isn't as keen on this meeting as credit and legal had 
thought.  This is what Keegan got back when she tried to set the meeting on 
his calendar.  It's not really going to help much for me to stay in the 
middle of this, but it seems pretty clear to me that Rogers has a different 
view of where this was left than than you guys had.  The most efficient thing 
might be a quick phone call from Elizabeth to Rogers -- which might get the 
whole thing back on track.

Thank you for forwarding this e-mail.  Please pass on that I do not need to 
meet on the agency issues relating to Entergy again.  I have done this 
several times and unfortunately, nothing is ever resolved.  If legal/credit 
would like to meet with Entergy, have them provide me with a list of specific

some proposed dates.  I will try to arrange the meeting with Entergy from

Thanks again,

Elizabeth,
Just a quick note to let you know that the Long description for the PJM 
Western Hub Location has been revised from:
The transaction is for delivery or receipt of energy at the PJM Western Hub.
to
The transaction is for delivery or receipt of energy at the PJM Western Hub. 
Buyer assumes all risks associated with transmission of the energy away from 
the PJM Western Hub. Seller makes no representations that the energy can be 
moved out of PJM and shall have no liability if Buyer is unable to move the 
energy out of PJM. 

Please let me know if you have any questions/comments.
Thanks
Carlos

Please see the language in the e-mail below.  In August of last year we 
started adding this language to all confirmation letters done at the 
PJM-Western Hub delivery point.  I just realized that we never had this 
language added on EOL.  Leslie Hansen is the attorney that supplied us this 
information.  Leslie is on maternity leave but you can see the e-mail that 
she sent me below.

Please call me with any questions you may have.

I would like to add the following as an insert to all power transactions 
where we sell power for delivery at the PJM Western Hub.  

"Buyer assumes all risks associated with transmission of the energy away from 
the PJM Western Hub.  Seller makes no representations that the energy can be 
moved out of PJM and shall have no liability if Buyer is unable to move the 
energy out of PJM."

Please prepare a mock confirm for my review.  Also, please let me know if we 
sell at any other delivery points in PJM.

Hi, Liz.  Thank you for the call yesterday.  I am sorry I did not call
back.  I had Andrew till mid-afternoon and had planned to go over to Chi's,
but she went to Dege's uncle's.  Chi and I talked in the afternoon and she
was very sad.  I was pretty lonely myself.

About the car--I went around to different dealerships on Saturday and
couldn't get a clear offer of more than $2000 for it in a trade.  The
temporary tag expires this week, so  I imagine I (or Chi if she wants to)
will have to register it in Maryland to keep it or sell it.  It has a
couple of significant problems that would be clear to a buyer--one rear
window is broken and stuck in the fully open position, and the driver's
seat can not be moved backward.  If both were fixed, (both involve, at
least in part, electric motors--$500??) I think it might sell out of the
newspaper for about $4500.  I will discuss it with Chi.

Do you have any sense as to how long it will take you to complete settling
Mom's estate?  That definitely enters into my thinking about a new car.   I
had mentioned the possibility to you of wanting a loan in April or May--I
think I have managed to postpone my anticipated debt from legal expenses
until December.

Chris, the simple fact, which we know from past experience and which OPG is 
missing, is that there is a large segment of counterparties who for various 
reasons (logistics/scheduling fixed-priced physical requirements for term 
with a with a marketer; corporate authorizations for physical transacting 
only; industrial culture; commercial sophistication; etc) will only want to 
transact physically.  To ignore this is to ignore a large segment of the 
market.  

If OPG wants out of the process I nonetheless urge you to continue as I am 
confident that once the market opens, or gets closer to opening, they will 
realize this.  If they want to compete fully in the trading business they 
will come back to what the industry is using for physical settlement, which 
is the EEI form you will have developed.

I also think that OPG is missing the point on physical settlement.  As we 
discussed the IMO is merely the pool settlement mechanism.  That does not 
mean that the underlying transaction cannot be a physical bilateral which 
allocates physical settlement risk as between the parties for physical 
delivery obligations (such as for failure to deliver; increased costs and 
prudential support for failure to deliver even where the IMO mechanism makes 
up the deficiency volume; force majeure; volume management; etc).

I think it can be said in all markets that in many cases the distinctions 
between physical and financial trading can be distinctions without a 
difference, but nonetheless there are some real distinctions and more 
importantly, even if there are no differences, certain counterparties will 
only want to deal in what they believe to be a physically settled product. 

So it seems you are close with the other counterparties, and I suggest you 
just march on with them if OPG does not want to participate further.

Peter.

for them) the "Attachment X" referenced in Michelle's new Section 2.9 
language.  Paul, I have reinstalled the Credit Support Annex in case you were 
intending to use that apparatus to install credit terms (and I'm presuming

intentions.)  Please respond to me ASAP with your best efforts to state the 
final terms to be shown to 
New Power, and I will refine the document into shape suitable to be sent 
out.  Note -- I am uncertain how the confidentiality obligation in Section 
7.2 should be stated in view of the possibly converging relations of ENA 
Wholesale with EES, and therefore desire that it be stated as narrowly as can 
be done while addressing New Power's main concerns and stating an EPMI 
obligation with clear and livable boundaries.

As some of you may have seen through the e-mail system, Enron Corp. has begun 
a payables and procurement initiative under the name "iBuyit."  The 
initiative involves the implementation of an on-line procurement and payables 
system, the central focus of which will be to enable Enron to better track 
vendor expenses and overall costs. 

The implementation of the payables portion of the system will occur on May 1, 
2001 and will be applicable to all organizations supported by Houston-based 
Accounts Payable processing centers (e.g., our Legal Department).  I have 
been asked to be the stakeholder for this project for the Department and have 
been working with Dina Snow and Carolyn George (as the Department change 
agents) to get up to speed on this program and its impact.

Given that this program will present a marked changed in the manner in which 
we will be coding, reviewing and approving invoices for payment, it is 
important that each of you have an overview understanding of the system and 
how it will function.  This, in turn, will aid you in determining the best 
process to be implemented within your particular group for use of the 
system.  To assist in this general understanding, the iBuyit group prepared a 
system demonstration running through the functionality of the system and 
answering some general questions as to its use.  I believe it provides an 
appropriate overview and have provided the below link to the demonstration 
location:

http://ibuyit.enron.com/gss/ibuyit/iBuyitPayablesPresentation.ppt

Mark has asked that I speak on this program a bit at the upcoming OGC meeting 
(Monday, 4/23) and answer any questions you may have.  In the interim, if 
there are any questions about the program or the system's functionality, 
please do not hesitate to call me.

As expected, Lil Anne cannot baby sit next Saturday.  She has a Christmas 
party that night.  I left Ted a message that we were both have problems 
getting a baby sitter and suggested that perhaps the 16th would work.

We didn't talk about the Nutcracker, but are you interested in going on the 
same night?  I think Eleanor might sit and behave better if an older, more 
calm friend went also...

Talk to you later.  Sheryl.

Elizabeth,

I decided this weekend that I would like to go to the conference if there is 
still room.  In addition to the educational benefits, BPA may be sending some 
folks, which would give you and I an additional opportunity to sell  them on 
the EEI in a more relaxed setting (perhaps over dinner?).  Do you have a list 
of conference attendees?    

Also, as you know, we are trying to get an EEI in place with WAPA.  Because 
of the PG&E bankruptcy, WAPA and its customers cannot count on PG&E 
deliveries, and are therefore looking to cover perhaps 500 MW.  However, 
there is a bottleneck in the WAPA organization that is preventing 
implementation of an EEI, and therefore preventing EPMI from getting the 
business.  It would be helpful to know if WAPA is sending anyone.     

Also, if many customers or potential customers are attending, Stewart Rosman 
and possibly other traders may be interested in going to develop business.  
(Stewart expressed his interest.)  What do you think about that idea?

Best,

Steve

I discovered Thursday afternoon that ACES Power Marketing is entering into 
power transactions on behalf of Wabash Valley Power Association, Inc.  Our CP 
in En-Power is Wabash, and so far as documentation/global counterparties, all 
transactions are entered into directly by Wabash.  However, it is actually 
ACES that is making the call or using the EOL password to do a deal.  

I have requested a copy of the agency agreement between Aces and Wabash and 
have forwarded to Wabash the attached form of Consent and Acknowledgment for 
execution.

I would like to discuss with you whether you feel further steps are necessary 
with regard to either our general contractual relationship or EnronOnline and 
have set up a meeting through Brenda.

Leslie

David,

I believe that the ownership percentage in Section 2.11 should be 100%, not 
50%. If we were to sell off any meaningful portion of either subsidiary, we 
would likely want that entity to stand on its own credit; at a minimum, Enron 
Corp. would be due compensation for the guaranty it is providing from the 
minority shareholder(s).  Please call me to discuss if there are objections.

Paul

David, could you please insert a material adverse change clause in our QSE 
agreement with EES.  This is to cover EPMI in the event EES is sold partially 
or wholly to a third  party.  If this occurs, the third party would have to 
negotiate acceptable credit terms with EPMI.  In my meeting with Paul he said 
that this is standard in our other agreements with EES.  This is all we need 
for credit for EES QSE.

Ed:
I've reviewed these agreements, dated January, 2000 between Southern Company 
Services, Inc. ("SCS") and each of:  Alabama Power Company, Gulf Power 
Company, Savannah Electric and Power Company, George Power Company, and 
Mississippi Power Company (each, a "Client Company").
The agreements are identical.
The agreements are effective until terminated by either party upon written 
notice to the other party.
The agreements contain an obvious blank that was not filled in, but would 
have designated the state's laws that should govern the agreement
The agreements clearly authorize SCS to act for each company to purchase and 
sell electric power for resale and engage in derivative transactions, 
including negotiating executing, performing,  and administering agreements to 
do so, with no limits on the types or duration of such transactions.
The agreements clearly state that SCS has no liability under any such 
agreement, and only each Client Company will be liable under any such 
agreement, whether or not SCS's role as agent is disclosed to the other party 
to such an agreement.  
Based on this review, and since we are still informed that SCS will not 
allocate any trade at the time of the trade, you may wish to authorize 
trading w/ SCS, but only to the extent of the credit of the weakest Client 
Company (assuming that EPMI's maximum exposure is always to the weakest of 
the group).
Please let me know if you need any further input from legal.
Regards,
Janice

advised that on May 25, 2001, they will evaluate Enron's subcontracting 
program and compliance on any subcontracting plans in effect on current 
contracts.

This review will cover the last five (5) years.  All Forms 294 and 295 filed 
with the Small Business Adminstration along with the names of each 
Administrative Contracting Officer (U.S. Government employee responsible for 
monitoring the contract) for each contract will be subject to the review.

In addition, total subcontract placement with small businesses, small 
disadvantaged businesses, women-owned small businesses, and HubZone small 
businesses shall be reviewed.  Further, the amount of indirect or overhead 
costs, if any, apportioned to contract goals is subject to review.

We will also need information on the number of active suppliers Enron is 
currently using in the following categories:  large business, small business, 
small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business and HubZone 
business.  The review will cover these figures for one year ago if available."

I got a letter from Hodes, Ulman, Pessin & Katz asking me to sign a
personal representative resignation/consent form appointing Laurence Tracy
as representative.  Should I sign it?  It also says "I may not withdraw
this consent".  That seems absurd.

[I'll see you at approx. 1  p.m. today right?] 

Re the below, contact the credit group to see if they can speedily resolve 
the credit issues so as to bring the EEI to bear on the transansaction, 
clearly the best result.  Credit will also indicate whether the size of the 
trade is such that they want to insist the trade is done under a completed 
EEI Master, rather than being documented the 'old way' and then brought under 
the EEI Master upon its completion.  If the trade will be completed under the 
Tariff, you'll want to look at the Tariff to see what underlying terms you're 
dealing with (e.g., 1 year limit on term of trade completed under the Tariff, 
availability of LDs for a trade involving LD energy, etc.)

If not already known to you, Genia or Elizabeth may have input on where 
things stood in Janice's negotiations with CP&L.

CP&L has marked up a confirm that we sent to them for a deal that was done 
5/8/2001 to make it subject to their 5/18/98 Tariff agreement.  We are in the 
process of negotiating an EEI Master with them but have some outstanding 
credit issues.  How should I respond to their mark-up?  This was one of 
Janice's files.

Here are my thoughts so far:

1.  Initial Legal Team -- Jeff Hodge, Jim Keller, Carol St. Clair, Aaron 
Rothwarg

2.  Spot Check the Forms -- over the next week

3.  Conform Forms to ENA Forms -- over next two months

4.  Develop Form Approval Process -- dual approvals by EES and ENA

5.  Develop Deal Approval Process -- deals above a certain size (or material 
variations from the form) would require concurrent EWS approval

6.  Request List of Major Contract Concerns from Traders -- items that cannot 
be hedged

Elizabeth,

Attached are the short form of GTC's that we would like to use in connection 
with our telecom transactions.  Certain provisions of these GTC's are 
bracketed and I would appreciate your view as to whether or not these 
provisions should be included.  Also please note that I have incorporated the 
termination provisions that you sent to me by fax and these provisions are 
bracketed and set forth in Section 4.  Let us have your feedback when you 
can, as we would like to start using these (and preparing a version for use 
with our advertising master!)  Thanks in advance for your help!!

Elizabeth Sager forwarded your message to me.  I am currently working on the 
ENA form of master netting agreement.  The current state of the form is 
attached below.  The trading committee will be reviewing and commenting on it 
in the next few months as well.  We have used the agreement with a few 
counterparties.  In so doing we have coordinated with New York counsel.  
Please remember, this is currently still work in progress.  If you have any 
questions or want to discuss this matter further, feel free to call me.

I would like to acknowledge David Portz for his hard work and diligence in 
drafting and actively supporting the negotiation of the Green Mountain Power 
all-requirements transaction in ERCOT.   David worked long hours ensuring all 
tight timelines were met and facilitated quick contract turnarounds on 
numerous occasions.

In addition to Green Mountain, David has exhibited the same hard work and 
diligence on other Texas transactions (San Antonio, misc. QSE contracts, 
etc.)

	SoCal Ed Exec Sees Bankruptcy If Lawmakers Reject Deal

	LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Edison International (EIX, news, msgs) unit Southern 
California Edison will go into bankruptcy if state legislators don't approve 
a deal for the state to buy the company's transmission lines, an Edison 
executive told reporters Friday. 
	"It's the agreement or bankruptcy. Legislators need to understand the 
consequences of having no agreement," said Bob Foster, SoCal Ed's senior vice 
president of external affairs. "We've had almost a year of instability and 
chaos, and having 2-3 more years of uncertainty isn't the way to handle 
public policy."

	It wasn't immediately clear if Foster meant SoCal Ed would declare 
bankruptcy, or if he thought the utility would be forced into bankruptcy by 
creditors if legislative approval of the deal falls through. 
	Gov. Gray Davis is having a tough time convincing legislators to accept the 
deal, which must have legislative backing in order to be implemented. 
	As previously reported, several key lawmakers have said the deal would need 
to be heavily amended before it could pass. 
	
	The terms of the deal, signed last week by Davis and Edison International 
Chief Executive John Bryson, call for the state to buy SoCal Ed's 12,000 
miles of transmission lines for $2.76 billion and to allow the utility to 
issue bonds backed by ratepayers so that it can recoup $5.5 billion in 
unrecovered power costs. 
	Davis told Senate Democrats Wednesday he would consider amending the 
agreement based on their input, and asked the lawmakers to appoint a special 
committee to work with his administration on possible revisions. 
	Foster said that while small changes may be acceptable, the meat of the 
agreement must not change. 
	"I'd be foolish to say you can't change a word, but the fact is that the 
essence of the agreement must stay the same. It's an integrated, balanced 
agreement and it must stay that way. If you pull something out, you need to 
add something in," Foster said. 
	The deal's "essence" ensures the utility will eventually become creditworthy 
again, Foster said. 
	As reported, some lawmakers have said ratepayers and taxpayers may be better 
off if SoCal Ed declares bankruptcy, especially now that PG&E Corp. (PCG, 
news, msgs) unit Pacific Gas & Electric Co. has sought bankruptcy-law 
protection and is no longer negotiating with the state. 
	"I still don't see how ratepayers could be any worse off with (SoCal Ed) in 
bankruptcy than they would with the governor's plan," State Sen. Debra Bowen, 
D-Redondo Beach, said Thursday. Bowen is chairwoman of the senate energy 
committee. 
	Bankruptcy would be worse than any perceived shortcomings in the SoCal Ed 
agreement, Foster said, and the utility will spend the next week trying to 
educate lawmakers on why that is so. One reason is that the state may need to 
purchase more "net-short" power to keep the lights on if the utility's 
contracts with small generators, or qualifying facilities, are rejected by a 
bankruptcy judge 
	"Twenty-seven percent of our customer demand is met by qualifying facility 
contracts. If those get rejected, the state's net-short expands from its 
current 32%...Also, our distribution systems are old and require a 
substantial amount of investment (to keep running). If we go into bankruptcy, 
there'll be no investment," Foster said. 
	
	Foster said he thought legislators' skepticism about the deal was partly due 
to lack of knowledge about its intricacies. 
	"I believe when members fully understand what this agreement is, they will 
understand it's decent and preferable to bankruptcy. The agreement is 38 
pages but it's packed and requires explanation...there are real benefits here 
for the state," Foster said. 
	Foster also said it wasn't yet clear whether the deal would require another 
rate hike on top of the 3-cent-kilowatt-hour increase passed by regulators 
last month. That's partly because regulators haven't yet determined how 
revenue from that rate hike will be divided between the utility and the 
state's Department of Water Resources for its power purchases. 
	"We need to understand how the present rates will be allocated, and that 
depends on what the DWR is going to need. Under some assumptions we will be 
able to fit the deal under current rates. If we can get qualifying facility 
costs to a manageable level and the DWR can clearly indicate what it needs in 
revenue going forward, it's possible," Foster said.

Just a suggestion, it may be a better use of everyone's time if the Credit
Managers met to discuss the draft of the Credit Support Annex prepared by
Bill before we get the drafting committee involved.  I don't know about the
other Credit Managers but I am in the process of going through and making
comments to Bill's draft.  I was thinking  we could gain consensus amongst
the Credit Managers and then get the drafting committee involved.  Maybe
even have a conference call or two before we actually meet.  Any thoughts?

Would the drafting commitee and representative credit managers be
interested in meeting in New York City on December 14 to discuss credit
annex draft.  Bill McCoy is giving a brown bag discussion on trading
documentation at a law firm in NYC and perhaps we could meet with him
afterwards?  Let me know asap and I'll ask Marving Goldstein, a partner at
the firm, if we can meet after the brown bag.  Of course, that depends on
Bill's availability too.

Draft response. Please come back to me with questions/comments/ changes.  

Randy/Josh,

I'm putting aside the forwarded files and not letting anyone here review them 
until we've had a conversation on what sort of fee/percentage arrangement, if 
any, we could put in effect by a signed agreement.  Please don't send any 
more potential customers' information until we've gone over this.  Enron is a 
big place with a lot of marketers fanned out and soliciting customers -- I 
can't have you just sending me information of this sort and creating risk 
that you'll surface at some point and claim a fee on a deal you were not 
involved in.  Especially where you have a non-exclusive relationship with the 
customer.  In general, I would have preferred that you had told me simply the 
ERCOT region and the size of a load, without identifying the customer, and I 
could then signal back to you whether Enron was interested in going forward.  
Enron Power Marketing will not pay anything in this sort of 'finders' 
arrangement except under an executed agreement with the finder, presuming an 
agreement can be reached.  So we should explore, as to Tyco, a potential 
agreement as to a "success fee",  with a payment structure based on the 
completion of an identified type of deal within a stated time frame, and tied 
to your actual assistance in the completion of the transaction, not just 
identifying the prospect.    

Please come back to me when you have a chance.  

Drew

drew, 
we are working on the data for the corpus account and will forward it to you  
as soon as it is recevied. 
to keep it simple we'll only send our biggest accounts, one by one, if there  
is a problem with it, such as a conflict, let us know immediately.  we'll  
take the risk.  we would like a quote with a fixed rate, with transmission,  
distribution, billing and any other by pass charges included.  the quote  
should provide a comparison of your rate against the incumbants rate and a  
cost savings percentage.  we will present your to our clients rate as it is  
given to us.  we would like a sign up fee, and 2% of gross from enron  
(outside of our clients discount) for the term of the agreement between 
enron  
and our clients. 
attached are a few files from a customer tyco.  they are registered for the  
pilot program, and wants service to begin july 6 2001. 
we look forward to hearing from you..

Funny how it works, but one of my clients I am doing a year-end deal for also 
found out before I told her.  HORRIBLE.  Oh well.  I guess I need to spill

This change is acceptable.  Melissa, will you be able to issue the execution

cleaned out?  This can be signed  here before sending to Calpine, or can be

Doug -- As discussed, attached is a redlined copy and an execution copy of
the off peak 2002-2004 confirmation letter reflecting the changes taking
into account that modifications to product definitions are more likely to
arise from  the efforts of industry participants than via ERCOT action as
to the protocols or otherwise. The definition of UB itself makes clear this
product is firm, and the term "Undelivered" currently carries the meaning
that  Buyer must be capable of moving the firm energy from the Delivery
Point to more than one potential destination.  Please contact me with any
questions. --David

Christi,

We need to meet with David Portz to discuss the risk associated with 
transmission changes as a result of new RTO's.  This morning in Bauhgman's 
meeting I volunteered to work with you and David to prepare draft contract 
language on this issue.

Let me know when you can meet.

everything you have going on, but unfortunately, as you recall from your law

Hi John

I will look into this - Part of the problem is also that I don't have an
assistant (Brenda left a few weeks ago and my new assistant (Alice)( HOORAY
), doesn't start until June 1st) who can approve or knows anything about
invoicing.

After you and I talked, we did these confirms and faxed them out.  As for a 
meeting to discuss the agency issues (and, secondarily, the EEI Master), I'm 
asking Keegan Farrell to coordinate the schedules of the following people and 
set up a meeting w/ Entergy.  In light of my future plans, it's not necessary 
for me to be there.
Here are the Enron people (Keegan: get some dates/times when all of these 
people can meet):
Elizabeth Sager
Rogers Herndon
Ed Sacks

The Entergy name(s) should come from Rogers. (Keegan: After you get the Enron 
people's schedules, if you haven't heard from Rogers, call him for the 
Entergy contacts, then call them and coordinate the meeting.)

Regards,
Janice

This is another one of those agencies that we have no documentation 
evidencing the "authority" to transact on behalf of the utilities.  EPMI 
continues to trade a significant volume of trades in both the term and daily 
mkt.  Given that the option premium is prepaid, we should not hold the 
confirm up.  We do however need to arrange a time to meet with the 
counterparty to get everything resolved.  Rogers has mentioned in the past he 
is available and will arrange a conference call.  My calendar is open, so 
please let me know which atty we should be coordinating this through.

Janice, can you look at it as soon as you get off the conference call.  
Rogers wanted the confirms out by 9:00 this morning.  Otherwise, can we get 
Elizabeth to look at it.  Sharen dropped the language into the confirm that 
Shari had drafted for the previous deals with Entergy confirmed under the 
WSPP.  We have used this language in the past with the only difference being 
these are options.

Janice,

I found out these involve an "east" delivery point and the trader, Rodgers 
Herndon needs them looked at this morning.  Is is possible for you to review 
these ASAP?

Thanks,
Genia

P.S.  Christian, you are "off the hook"!!!

Since this involves the WSPP, would you have time to look at these and 
respond to Sharen?

Shari Stack had agreed to confirm non-firm deals with Entergy Services under 
the WSPP.  Then she reluctantly agreed to use the WSPP for a few month long 
term deals.  Well, now we have two options that they want to confirm under 
the WSPP.  We do not have any other existing agreement with Entergy 
Services.  I have dropped in the language Shari prepared for the month long 
deal.  Can someone take a look at these and see if this will confirm the deal.

Thanks!

I have reviewed the ADR proposal and have the following comments.

This ADR proposal is a double edged sword.  On the one hand - as members of 
WSCC it will help to protect us from antitrust liability.  On the other hand, 
only full members of WSCC are obligated under the ADR provisions (Section 
12.1), so just like the ADR provisions of NRTA/WRTA/SWRTA, entities merely 
have to quit WSCC to get out of the ADR obligation.  This is especially 
problematic with entities that are not FERC jurisdictional.  But, I think, on 
balance, we are probably more concerned about the antitrust protection, given 
that the WSCC usually makes decisions that effect operating systems much more 
than marketers, although this is changing over time.  What do others think?
 I agree with the proposal to have binding arbitration for such controversial 
matters as transmission path ratings.  Section 12.6.2.  The lack of such a 
mechanism has created extended FERC litigation concerning the Alturas line.   
Further, I agree with the grounds for appealing the arbitration decision 
(contrary to law, arbitrary and capricious, lack of a fair hearing, or 
serious arbitrator misconduct).  Section 12.9.1.  However, the process for 
requiring FERC filings (under Sections 12.11) seem to undermine the binding 
nature of the arbitration provisions.  To really be binding, it seems like 
once the appeals process has been completed, Section 12.11 should require the 
prevailing and non-prevailing party to file joint filings to carry out the 
binding arbitration decisions.

Hi Peter

Pacific Gas and Electric paid us for gas purchases on May 25 for April 
production.
They paid amounts larger than the post bankruptcy invoice totals. 


Here are the details:

1. Pre Bankruptcy invoice for April 1-12 deliveries.

  4136SA   852,780.50 US

  Payment Rec'd  458,687.37 US

 It appears that they paid 53.787% of the pre bankruptcy invoice.


2. Pre Bankruptcy invoices for April 1-12 deliveries

  4120SA   2,033,749.68 CDN
  4138SA   2,797,179.00 CDN
     ------------------
  Subtotal  4,830,928.68 CDN

 Post Bankruptcy invoices for Apr 13-30 deliveries

  4139SA   3,425,804.71 CDN


 Total all sales for April production

     8,256,733.39 CDN

  Payment Rec'd  6,024,238.66 CDN


 It appears that they paid 53.787% of the pre bankruptcy invoice.


Please let me know what you want me to do with the excess payment.

An excerpt from a recent article:  
"Davis - who told reporters Monday that the state "is at war" with 
Houston-based generators - is expected to meet with representatives from a 
dozen energy companies Wednesday to discuss "unpaid debts, credit issues and 
the supply of power." Those generators include Mirant, Williams and Duke 
Energy. 
At the meeting Wednesday, Davis will attempt to get the generators to take a 
haircut on hundreds of millions of dollars of power bills owed by PG&E Corp. 
unit Pacific Gas & Electric and Edison International unit Southern California 
Edison. In exchange, a person close to Davis said, the governor may promise 
to veto the windfall profits tax bill if it reaches his desk." 


Generators Warn Of Blackouts If Calif OKs Windfall Tax Updated: Tuesday, May 
8, 2001 07:19 PM ET 
By Jason Leopold 
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Legislation to place a windfall profits tax on sales 
of electricity into California will deter investments in new generation and 
drive power out of the state, raising the risk of blackouts, wholesale-market 
power suppliers said Tuesday. 
"It would be totally counterproductive and prolong California's misery for 
years to come," said Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power 
Trading Forum, an industry group. "New plants in California wouldn't get 
built, and existing plants would cease operating. There would be blackouts 
all day long" 
On Monday, the Senate passed, by a vote of 25-12, a bill to tax at 100% sales 
of electricity into California above $80 a megawatt-hour. A separate windfall 
profits tax bill with a three-tiered rate system is moving through the 
Assembly's committees and could come up for a vote in the full house later 
this week. Electricity priced at $60/MWh would be taxed at 50%, sales of 
power over $90/MWh would be taxed at 70% and electricity sales over $120/MWh 
would be taxed at 90%. 
Gov. Gray Davis has said he is "open" to the concept of windfall profits tax 
on electricity sold into California, but hasn't said whether he supports the 
bills moving through the Legislature. 
Generators said they would seriously consider scrapping plans to build 
much-needed new generation in California if the measure is signed into law. 
"We do have some concerns on how (the bill) would affect new generation," 
said Mirant Corp. spokesman Chuck Griffin, whose company is investing about 
$500 million in new power plants in Northern California. "We have said all 
along that before we are able to build this generation we need to make a good 
assessment of the business environment in the state, and the (windfall 
profits tax) is certainly a factor." 
Tim Thuston, managing director of government relations for Williams Cos., 
said a windfall profits tax is "confiscatory" and the state is trying to 
circumvent the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
"I can tell you we think its a very poor idea," Thuston said. "I'm 
speculating, but I think any time a state starts seizing profits it would 
deter investment in that state." 
Duke Energy, a power supplier investing more than $600 million in new power 
plants in California, wouldn't comment on how the tax would affect its plans. 
Mirant - following Williams' lead - supports short-term regional price 
controls if they would bring stability to the state's wholesale power market, 
Griffin said. 
"We have expressed that we may be comfortable with some form of temporary 
price mitigation in order to get through this crisis," Griffin said. 
But the base prices for electricity written into the windfall-tax bills are 
much lower than generators' actual costs, Ackerman said. 
"Today's gas prices are much higher than that," he said. "Everybody would 
automatically sell out of state." 
Lawmakers Unmoved 
Lawmakers aren't overly concerned with negative implications if the measure 
becomes law. 
"If the price for rolling out the welcome for generators is 10 to 30 times 
more than Californians paid for power last year, then we ought to build our 
own plants," said state Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Redondo Beach, and chairwoman of 
the Senate energy committee. "The state's motto is 'Eureka,' not 'Welcome to 
California, please come gouge us.'" 
Paul Van Dyke, press secretary to state Sen. Nell Soto, D-Ontario, who is 
sponsoring the windfall profits tax bill in the Senate, said "there's no 
evidence that leaving things the way they are now will be better." 
"California has a limited policy chest, and federal energy regulators are not 
moving fast enough to solve the problems," Van Dyke said. "California needs 
to build up its tool chest. So at the end of the day, whether we solve this 
problem through windfall profits or a negotiated agreement with the 
generators, the bottom line is consumers cannot be gouged." 
Davis - who told reporters Monday that the state "is at war" with 
Houston-based generators - is expected to meet with representatives from a 
dozen energy companies Wednesday to discuss "unpaid debts, credit issues and 
the supply of power." Those generators include Mirant, Williams and Duke 
Energy. 
At the meeting Wednesday, Davis will attempt to get the generators to take a 
haircut on hundreds of millions of dollars of power bills owed by PG&E Corp. 
unit Southern California Edison. In exchange, a person close to Davis said, 
the governor may promise to veto the windfall profits tax bill if it reaches 
his desk. 
The governor's office wouldn't comment on the substance of the meeting 
Wednesday. 
Wall Street analysts said the measure could have severe effects on 
California's economy if it passes and will pressure generators' shares as the 
bills move through the Legislature. 
"We expect weakness in (generators) shares with California exposure," Dan 
Ford, an analyst with Lehman Brothers, said in a research note Tuesday. "A 
windfall profits tax bill will motivate generation developers to remove 
existing and new capital to other states and potentially destroy California's 
already softening economy." 
Ultimately, however, Ford expects the bill to be used as a bargaining chip 
rather than passed. 
The tax also raises regulatory questions, several lawmakers said. In essence, 
California is attempting to set wholesale power rates, which are governed by 
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
A FERC commissioner wouldn't comment directly on the issue, but told Dow 
Jones Newswires that the state has "no jurisdiction on wholesale power rates 
and does not have the legal authority to adjust rates set by FERC."

Ajit--regarding the pending rate reduction petition that has been filed at 
the Iowa Utilities Board (IUB) by the Office of the Consumer Advocate (OCA) 
against Mid American.  We've been looking at the prudence of intervening and 
being active in the case, based on your suggestion that if the rate reduction 
of $77 million as requested were granted, we might benefit to the tune of 
about $1.2 million on the current customers that we have behind Mid Am.

We are looking at a number of issues,  including the probability of success, 
the prudence of us being on the witness stand if we provide testimony,  the 
effect of the proposed rate design if a reduction is granted, going back to 
the last case to see how much the OCA really won,etc.   The first testimony 
will be filed in  mid June, and we should have a better idea then of what the 
case is really going to look like. 

One threshold question is whether there is any language  in our  contracts 
for the customers  that prohibits us from representing their/our interests at 
the IUB.  I am thinking that there probably is not, but want to make sure.  
COuld you please forward to me and Harry a copy of each customers contract to 
review?  

Vicki/Elizabeth--wasn't sure who these contracts would fall under,  so Jim 
suggested I send to you as well.

 ANSWERS TO INTERROGATORIES


INTERROGATORY NO. 1:

Please describe in detail the factual and legal basis for your contention
that CPSC =01&breached the Assignment Agreement=018 by allegedly =01&failin=
g to
endeavor in good faith to obtain the consent from LCRA.=018

ANSWER:  On July 30, 1999, Calpine entered into an agreement with Enron in
which it agreed to assume Enron=01,s obligation to supply power to the LCRA
under the Enron/LCRA Power Purchase and Sale Agreement dated August 31, 199=
5
and as it was amended on April 15, 1999.  The July 30, 1999 Assignment
Agreement contains a condition that Calpine will obtain LCRA=01,s written
consent to the assignment and a release of Enron and its affiliates from an=
y
and all obligations and liabilities under the Agreement.  Calpine
specifically agreed to endeavor in good faith to obtain LCRA=01,s consent a=
s
soon as practicable following Enron=01,s execution of the Assignment Agreem=
ent.
Shortly after the execution of the Assignment Agreement, Ed Baughman and
Steve Snow spoke to determine the status of Calpine=01,s efforts to obtain =
LCRA
=01,s consent.  Mr. Baughman followed up with Mr. Snow during the week of
August 16, 1999 to determine the status of Calpine=01,s efforts to obtain L=
CRA=01,
s consent.  It was clear from Mr. Baughman=01,s conversation with Mr. Snow =
that
Calpine was not exercising its best efforts to obtain LCRA=01,s consent.  W=
hen
this became apparent, Mr. Baughman and others at Enron began making
inquiries of LCRA to determine what would be required to obtain LCRA=01,s
consent.  These conversations made it clear that Calpine had not explored
the issue with the LCRA.  Further, Enron representatives were advised by
representatives of the LCRA that Calpine had not furnished any financial
information to the LCRA to make it comfortable with Calpine=01,s assumption=
 of
the delivery obligations.  Such failure by Calpine to use due diligence in
obtaining LCRA=01,s consent combined with its failure to provide the LCRA w=
ith
any financial or credit information demonstrates that Calpine did not
endeavor in good faith to obtain the LCRA=01,s consent.



INTERROGATORY NO. 2:

Please describe in detail the factual and legal basis for your contention
that CPSC failed =01&to exercise  good faith in agreeing to reasonable requ=
ests
relating to the assignment,=018 specifically identifying each and every all=
eged
=01&reasonable request=018, and when, how, by whom, and under what circumst=
ances
the request was made, and CPSC=01,s response to each request.

ANSWER:  Calpine failed to exercise good faith in agreeing to reasonable
requests relating to the assignment by failing to endeavor in good faith to
obtain LCRA=01,s consent to the assignment, failing to provide LCRA with
financial information and failing to provide LCRA with a parent guaranty
guaranteeing Calpine Power Services Corporation=01,s performance of its
assumption of the Enron/LCRA Power Purchase and Sale Agreement.
Additionally, Calpine failed to agree to reasonable requests when it failed
to provide an indemnification from its parent corporation indemnifying Enro=
n
in the event that Enron paid any money out on its guaranty to the LCRA.  On
or about August 26, 1999, after it became clear that Calpine was not taking
any effort to endeavor in good faith to obtain the LCRA=01,s consent, David
Portz of Enron sent Ron Fischer of Calpine the documents necessary to
provide Calpine=01,s parent guaranty and indemnification of any payment by
Enron under the LCRA agreement.  Calpine refused to execute these documents
or to negotiate in good faith for any necessary modifications thereto.
Additionally, in a telephone conversation between Enron and Calpine
representatives, Calpine conceded that in the past, it had traditionally
provided a parent guaranty.



INTERROGATORY NO. 3:

Please describe in detail any and all damages allegedly suffered by you and
for which you seek redress herein, and describe in detail the method by
which such damages are calculated.

ANSWER:  Enron has not yet calculated the damages it has incurred as a
result of Calpine=01,s breach of its obligations under the Assignment
Agreement.  Enron continues to have an obligation to supply the LCRA with
power and will be required to do so until the contract terminates on
December 31, 2002.  Enron will supplement this interrogatory in accordance
with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.



INTERROGATORY NO. 4:

Do you contend that CPSC was obligated under the July 30, 1999 Letter to
seek and/or secure a guarantee from Calpine Corporation?  If you answer to
either is =01&yes,=018 please describe in detail the legal and factual basi=
s for
each such contention.

ANSWER:  Yes.  Beginning during approximately the summer of 1998, it became
customary in the wholesale power market to provide a parent guarantee when
the power was either being purchased by or sold to a marketing affiliate.
In a telephone conference on the afternoon of August 27, 1999, Calpine
representatives conceded that they generally provided a parent guaranty.
Additionally, the representatives conceded that it did not cost Calpine
Power Services Company any money to provide a parent guaranty.  In the
negotiations between Enron and Calpine prior to the execution of the
Assignment Agreement, it was understood that Calpine would provide a parent
guarantee.  When the transaction changed from the back-to-back transaction
to the assignment, in recognition of the increased risk, Enron increased th=
e
amount that it was willing to pay Calpine to assume its obligations under
the Enron/LCRA Power Purchase and Sale Agreement to $1.8 million.  In
recognition that parent guarantees are customary in the industry, in
December of 1999, Calpine and Enron exchanged parent guarantees.


INTERROGATORY NO. 5:

Identify each action which you contend is =01&customary and reasonable in t=
he
industry=018 and which you contend CPSC failed to undertake in order to =01=
&obtain
LCRA=01,s consent=018 to the assignment of the Power Agreement.

ANSWER:  Calpine failed to act in a customary and reasonable manner by
failing to act promptly to obtain the LCRA=01,s consent to Calpine=01,s
assignment.  Further, Calpine failed to act in a customary and reasonable
manner in failing to provide LCRA with any financial information concerning
Calpine Power Services Corporation or its parent in order to assure the LCR=
A
of Calpine=01,s financial ability to perform under the Assignment Agreement=
.
Calpine also failed to provide either Enron or LCRA with a parent guarantee
and to provide parent indemnification to Enron for any amounts paid by Enro=
n
to the LCRA as a result of Calpine=01,s failure to perform its obligations
under the Power Purchase and Sale  Agreement.


INTERROGATORY NO. 6:

Identify and describe in detail each and ever action taken by you to
mitigate your alleged damages in this matter.

ANSWER:  On December 8, 1999, Enron gave notice to the LCRA of its
termination of the Enron/LCRA Power Purchase and Sale Agreement dated Augus=
t
31, 1995, as amended on April 15, 1999 effective December 31, 2002.  On
December 31, 1999, Enron entered into an agreement with Oxy Vinyls, L.P.
wherein Enron Power Marketing, Inc. purchased electrical capacity and energ=
y
from Oxy.  Additionally, Enron has purchased the power necessary to supply
the LCRA at the lowest prices available to it in the market.

Our department will be migrated to Outlook in two groups.  The first group 
will be migrated on Monday, June 11,  and the second group will be migrated 
on Tuesday, June 12.   You will receive four e-mails from the Outlook 
migration team.  Please do not delete them.  You will need to open the four 
e-mails and follow the instructions to migrate to Outlook.

Assistants, you will be responsible for scheduling training for yourself and 
your assignments.  It is recommended everyone attend a one hour training 
class.  Training can be scheduled by contacting Maggie Cruz at extension 
3-1816.  (Assistants, please coordinate training with your backup so both of 
you are not in training at the same time.)  Outlook migration specialists 
will be on the 38th floor to answer questions Tuesday and Wednesday, June 12 
and 13.

Listed below is useful information provided to us by the Outlook Migration 
team.  

E-mail Policies

Users will be restricted to a Mailbox size of 100 MB.  

Further mailbox size restrictions are detailed as follows:

Issue Warning at 75 MB - users are automatically sent a warning from the 
System Administrator explaining they are near their Mailbox limit.

Prohibit Send at 100 MB - users are prevented from sending e-mail, yet they 
can still receive internal and external messages.  Users must reduce the size 
of their mailbox by deleting old mail, saving attachments to a local drive, 
etc. before they can send e-mail again.   

Inbound/Outbound Mail Size Limits - inbound and outbound e-mail messages will 
be limited to a size of 10MB.

Deleted Item Retention - users will be able to recover deleted items from 
their mailbox as old as 8 days.  Deleted items include e-mail messages, 
folders, contacts, calendar entries, tasks, notes, journal entries and 
meeting notices.

Archiving - archiving will not be a supported feature of Outlook 2000. 

Migration Preparation

Clean Your Mailbox - due to new space limitations on your mailbox, you are 
advised to clean your Notes mailbox of old, unneeded messages BEFORE 
migration.  If you are at the 100MB limit on the day of migration, you will 
not be able to send messages once you are in Outlook.

Limits on Items Migrated  - from the day of your migration, only 30 days of 
old mail will be migrated from your mailbox.  This includes mail in your 
inbox and other folders.  Calendar items dating back one year from the day of 
migration will be migrated (with the exception of repeating appointments).

Attached each of you will find a document that explains the timing and
objectives of the Accounts Receivable/Accounts Payable Reconciliation Project
that will be conducted by Arthur Andersen.  If you are not aware of the review
or have not been contacted by myself , I will be contacting you within the 
next
day or so to establish a convenient meeting time to discuss one of the key 
areas
of the project which relates to the statute of limitations.  We will be 
looking
at the term that balances have been in AR and AP, and we want to make sure we
understand the legal rights related to these balances for the specific
commodities and industries that you support.  We should only need to meet 
about
30 minutes or less.

If you have any questions prior to our meeting time or me contacting you, 
please
feel free to give me a call at ext. 6-6275

Thank you for taking time to review the attachment and I will be in contact 
with
each of you if we have not yet spoken.

Whenever or wherever people want to meet is fine with me.  Just remember 
there seemed to be a lot of interest in having a credit annex at the meeting 
on October 13tth.  I think the drafting committee should be responsive to 
that interest and not wait too long to produce a draft for consideration by 
the larger group.  Also, be mindful that for a lot of counterparties, a 
really complex document will be difficult to execute.  It essential to have a 
credit annex ready for the EEI Credit workshop in January or February (date 
is still to be determined).

Just a suggestion, it may be a better use of everyone's time if the Credit
Managers met to discuss the draft of the Credit Support Annex prepared by
Bill before we get the drafting committee involved.  I don't know about the
other Credit Managers but I am in the process of going through and making
comments to Bill's draft.  I was thinking  we could gain consensus amongst
the Credit Managers and then get the drafting committee involved.  Maybe
even have a conference call or two before we actually meet.  Any thoughts?

Would the drafting commitee and representative credit managers be
interested in meeting in New York City on December 14 to discuss credit
annex draft.  Bill McCoy is giving a brown bag discussion on trading
documentation at a law firm in NYC and perhaps we could meet with him
afterwards?  Let me know asap and I'll ask Marving Goldstein, a partner at
the firm, if we can meet after the brown bag.  Of course, that depends on
Bill's availability too.

Christi and I thought you should know about this development in New York 
regarding EnronOnline.  Please call me if you have any questions.

Andy is back now so this is all over to him.  There are lots of issues to 
consider in how all of this moves forward.  Let's just make sure Howard keeps 
Andy in the loop on this as the traders are not expected to understand the 
trading framework of EOL.

Thanks

Louise

Louise --

Government Affairs was not pushing for this outcome.  The NY PSC seems to 
have adopted this on their own (or with the support of the local utility).   
Howard Fromer (our NY reg affairs guy) indicates that the NY PSC was simply 
looking for a deep market index they could use to establish "non-switching" 
customer rates.  Howard has spoken with Dana Davis about publishing off-peak 
and on-peak prices and he said that the Desk could do it.

One other thing.  PGE is looking to transact with EPMI through EOL.  We are 
preparing a filing at FERC that would modify PGE's Code of Conduct to allow 
this.  There is a risk that FERC will use this filing (while small) to look 
again at "regulating" EOL.  Remember that APX is regulated by FERC.

I agree that we need to be more coordinated with EOL and state regulators 
(FERC is in the loop and we have had discussions with them).  

Of course, as our involvement in the markets through EOL continues to grow, 
regulators will begin to take a deeper look.

Lisa Yoho and I can come by today to discuss more fully if you'd like.

Jim

Subject: Re: NYPSC Adopts Enron Online as Index  

Have we had any interaction with them on this?  This is not good news at all 
(as indicated below) and has regulatory implications for EnronOnline - I 
presume we did not encourage this in any way or have any agreement in place.  

Did we have any involvement in the process at all or is this something one of 
your guys picked up - Anyway Andy Zipper is back today so I am sure he will 
handle this.

Physically they cannot get the prices and we don't (I think) publish power 
indices on EOL. 

I hope we haven't been the people pushing this as that would be a real 
problem and shows immense lack of co-ordination.

Not sure if you had seen this language from the NY PSC.  While great, this 
clearly means that NY PSC commissioners will begin to think alot about how 
EOL  and its relationships with other Enron companies.

Subject: NYPSC approves market-based backout credit for RG&E; Adopts Enron 
Online as Index

Another big victory for Enron in New York! In an Order issued by the NYPSC on 
March 29, the NYPSC has approved a proposal to modify the existing fixed 
backout credit of 2.8 cents per kwh for energy and capacity and replace it 
with a market-based backout credit. The additional retail adder of 0.4 cents 
per kwh would remain.  Load-serving entities (LSEs) will have the option of 
continuing to buy their energy and capacity from RG&E at the market based 
backout credit which will be determined 15 days prior to the beginning of 
each of the two six-month capability periods, and will be based on "a 
forecast of energy prices derived from Enron Corporation's (Enron) 
EnronOnline trading platform."  To my knowledge, this is the first occasion 
that a regulatory body has agreed to use Enron Online as an index!  LSEs can 
elect instead to procure their own commodity and get a market-based backout 
credit (MBBC). Under this option, the LSEs will get a market based backout 
credit. However, the Enron online prices for the six months determined as 
above will be reconciled on a lag basis against actual market prices.  The 
PSC has capped the amount of the reconciliation for any LSE to the product of 
the LSE's total load for the calendar year and $0.065 per kwh (PSC staff's 
estimate of RG&E's embedded power supply cost).  (The PSC Order actually says 
$0.015 but this appears to be a mistake since the attached settlement states 
$0.065.) A copy of the PSC's Order is available on its website:

Elizabeth, 

Please send me the name of the HR person Jeff is supposed to call.  He does 
not have a contact name or number.

Also, I made flight reservations for the 30th.  I can meet with Jim Derrick 
at either 2:30 or 3:30.  I would prefer 3:30, but you can pencil me in for 
either.

Steve

George,
We have been watching this "border state" very closely to see where they are 
going to go and it looks like we need to shore up our proactive mitigation 
maneuverings.  The muttering is getting to a pretty bitter level up there 
across the Columbia. You'd better take a ride up that way and have a look.

FYI

Seattle City Utility Racks Up $92 Million in Power Purchases in March
Jim Brunner , The Seattle Times

( April 17, 2001 )



Apr. 16--Seattle City Light spent a record $92 million buying power on the 
market in March, more than any month in its 91-year history.

City Light officials say the cost of buying power for local residents and 
businesses eclipsed the previous records -- $84 million set in February and 
nearly $80 million in January.

To put that in perspective: In 1999, before the current power crisis, the 
utility's total power bill for the entire year was $90 million. "We're 
spending that every month now. The dollars that are involved are staggering," 
said Paula Green, deputy superintendent of City Light.

It's a cash hemorrhage brought on by Washington's drought, which means less 
water in the reservoirs at city-owned dams. That increases Seattle's need to 
purchase electricity on a market where prices have zoomed to unprecedented 
levels.

Adding to the frustration for Seattle city officials is the fact that most of 
that money is flowing to out-of-state utilities and power brokers who are 
profiting enormously from the energy crunch.

Last month alone, the bill from Enron, a Houston-based corporation, was $25.5 
million, putting it well ahead of the No. 2 seller, California's Sempra 
Energy, which sold $7.4 million worth of electricity to City Light.

City Light still gets most of the 1,200 megawatts necessary to serve its load 
from city-owned dams and from its contract with the Bonneville Power 
Administration (BPA). The utility buys only about 15 percent of its power on 
the market. But that thin slice now accounts for more than 90 percent of its 
power costs.

Part of the explanation for March's record power-buying binge was City 
Light's recent decision to store up extra water behind Ross Dam on the Skagit 
River instead of spilling it through the dam's power turbines.

In a normal water year, City Light officials would be spilling water for 
energy and expecting it would be replaced with spring runoff. Now, they're 
saving the water so it can be spilled later to help salmon runs and to 
generate power for Seattle this summer, when energy prices are expected to 
surge even higher, to more than $400 per megawatt hour.

"We're insulating ourselves. By putting out one eye now, we're avoiding 
cutting off our head later," said Bob Royer, City Light spokesman.

Seattle ratepayers are feeling the pain, with a 28 percent City Light rate 
increase so far this year. More rate increases are likely on the way.

Higher rates have also led to plant closures and layoffs in Bellingham and 
Spokane.

Meanwhile, Enron's revenues more than doubled last year, to $101 billion. Its 
stock prices surged to end the year at $88 a share, up from $44 the year 
before. The stock was trading at $57 a share last week.

"It doesn't just feel unfair, but immoral that these major companies like 
Enron are making billions of dollars at the expense of everyday people and 
businesses," said City Councilwoman Heidi Wills, who chairs the Council's 
Energy and Environmental Policy Committee.

"There's this enormous transfer of wealth from our ratepayers to the 
shareholders of these companies," Wills said.

Northwest leaders have called for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to 
impose price caps. But opponents say price caps would do nothing to encourage 
the construction of new power plants, or energy conservation.

Karen Denne, an Enron spokeswoman, said it's unfair to fault the company for 
selling power at prices dictated by the free market. "Enron is providing 
electricity to a market that needs it," Denne said. "It's unfortunate when 
regulators are pointing fingers, looking to fix blame, when this is a problem 
of supply and demand."

The company hails from President George W. Bush's home state of Texas, and is 
one of the top "soft money" donors to political campaigns. Enron and its 
executives gave $435,000 to the Democrats and $1.2 million to Republicans 
last year, according to Common Cause.


Its chairman, Kenneth Lay, has consistently been one of the top donors to 
Bush's presidential and gubernatorial campaigns.

Enron doesn't own a lot of dams or power plants. Instead, the company makes 
money as a middleman -- buying power from utilities and then reselling it for 
a profit. The company, formed in 1985 from the merger of two pipeline 
companies, has become the largest trader of wholesale electricity in North 
America.

Part of its success in the energy market stems from its groundbreaking use of 
the Internet to make buying electricity as easy as ordering a book online. 
You just point, click and spend.

"It's easier than Amazon," said Steve Lewis, a power marketer with City 
Light, demonstrating the company's Web site. It lists available power 
"products" and the asking price for both buyers and sellers.

Lewis and other power marketers monitor City Light's projected power needs 
and then use the phone or Internet to schedule electricity for the next hour, 
next day or months ahead. They try to find the best price available, but it's 
clearly a sellers' market.

Utilities routinely buy power that used to cost $30 per megawatt hour for 
more than $200. At times last month, City Light was buying power for $450 a 
megawatt hour. And it's not because the cost of generation has gone up.

"This is pure profit," said Green, deputy superintendent of City Light.

There is evidence that the Northwest is in some ways being hit even harder 
than California, whose experiment with deregulation is blamed for roiling the 
power markets. A recent analysis found that Pacific Northwest utilities are 
paying the highest prices in the nation for the next-day delivery of 
wholesale power.

However, regional utilities also sell power for extraordinarily high prices. 
In fact, some of the highest average prices paid by City Light last month 
were to neighbors.

Puget Sound Energy, Western Washington's largest electric utility, charged 
City Light the highest average price of any seller last month, at $303 per 
megawatt hour, according to City Light's preliminary billing estimates. 
Spokane's Avista Energy charged $281.

That compares with Enron's average price of $173 per megawatt hour and an 
overall average of $194.

The BPA, by comparison, charges City Light $22 per megawatt hour.

City Light typically relies on local utilities more when it needs power 
delivered immediately. And prices for short-term deals can be higher 
depending on the time of day. The city has only a long-term contract with the 
BPA.
D
 espite the record-setting month, city officials hope they'll be in better 
shape before the year is out. Mayor Paul Schell has taken to calling Oct. 1 
Seattle's "energy independence day" because that's when the city will begin 
receiving more hydroelectric power under a new contract with the BPA.

The historically cheap BPA power, combined with a contract with a gas-fired 
power plant in Klamath Falls, Ore., should reduce the city's reliance on the 
open market, city officials say.

But the BPA, too, has been stricken by higher market power costs and may have 
to increase its rates to City Light by 250 percent. The City Council has 
already agreed to pass those higher costs on to Seattle ratepayers although 
it's unclear how much that would raise the bill of the average person.

Even at a higher rate, City Light officials regard the BPA power as a good 
long-term strategy for getting power costs under control. If they succeed, 
the rate increases approved this year could eventually be rescinded.

Until then, local ratepayers will have to keep writing bigger checks to City 
Light with the knowledge that some of their money will find its way to Texas.

Members of the working group for MISO

Attached are a set of files that many of you may have seen that are the
result of work undertaken to define the attributes of a real flow system for
SPP.  Because, at yesterday's meeting, several of you indicated that you had
not seen these I am including the full deck here.

The work reported in these documents was sponsored by:

Coral
Dynegy
Enron
PG&E Gen
Tanaska.

In addition to the FAQ attached we responded to about 40 other questions
that were posed by participants in SPP. These came in several waves and
tended to be far more specific to SPP and therefore are not attached.  I can
pull those together if you believe that they would be helpful.

My plan is to be at the meeting in Chicago next monday and I can answer
questions (off line so that I don't take committee time) about these
documents if that would be useful for individuals.

BEST

Shari:
I was not presently planning on participating.  I previously spoke with
Lisa Groff/Frank Hilton, my credit people participating on this
subcommittee, and we agreed that it was preferable to have the credit
managers and those on this mini-drafting group complete their assignment of
crafting a provision for the larger drafting committee of the EEI contract
to subsequently review.  The larger drafting committee would review to
ensure that the language, phrasing and structure of the document is
consistent with the existing EEI contract, and also have the larger group's
credit personnel involved in reviewing the subcommittee's work.  As a
result, I have not tried to redline at this juncture, because the smaller
drafting committee has not finished its work and created a consensus
document.

I agree that the timing at year end of this effort is really squeezing our
resources.

I am going to be on the call on Thursday  - are you? If so, how are you
approaching it? Are you going to come to the meeting with general comments
or are you going to circulate a redline in advance? Will your credit people
be on the line too?  It is quite a push to fit this in with everything else
that is going on at this time of year. I just wondered how you are treating
this from your company's perspective.

Personally I am going to try and get a redline out in advance of the call.
I will send it to everyone that is on the distribution list below.

Thanks!

Andy,  As discussed, heer is MSDW's proposal for a draft version of a
Collateral Annex that can be used in connection with the EEI Agreement
(it would be advisable for a clause to be included in the EEI cover
sheet incorporating the collateral annex by reference).  We are offering
this draft as a starting point for the industry's efforts to develop an
EEI Collateral Annex.  Please feel free to distribute it and let Ed or
me know if you would like to have a conference call with others to
determine the next steps in getting feedback.  Bill McCoy

credit terms







Becky:
Here's a revised cover sheet that includes everything we've discussed so
far (including the clause I sent you yesterday), plus credit terms.  These
terms have been based on general discussions b/w your credit people and
ours.  If you can get agreement quickly from your credit department, we can
execute this agreement this week.  If there are any questions, please have
your credit person get in touch w/ Ed Sacks directly (713-345-7712) or call
me if there are problems w/ anything at all.
As I mentioned this morning, the guarantee we have now from American
National Power, Inc. says that it will expire this month, so we'll be
needing an appropriate amendment.  May I suggest that you amend it to use
the language in Enron's standard guarantee, as follows:
          Guarantor  may  terminate  this  Guarantee  by  providing written
     notice  of such termination to Counterparty and upon the effectiveness
     of  such  termination,  Guarantor  shall  have  no  further  liability
     hereunder,  except as provided in the last sentence of this paragraph.
     No  such  termination  shall be effective until five (5) business days
     after  receipt  by  Counterparty  of such termination notice.  No such
     termination  shall  affect  Guarantor's  liability with respect to any
     Transaction  (as  defined  in the Agreement) entered into prior to the
     time  the  termination  is  effective,  which Transaction shall remain
     guaranteed pursuant to the terms of this Guarantee.

I have not been able to obtain a copy of this guarantee from our files, but
we also need to check to be sure that it covers power purchase and sale
transactions of ANP Marketing Company.
Friday is my last day at Enron, and it would be most efficient if we could
wrap this up before then.  Thanks so much for your kind assistance.

Regards,
Janice

By the way, I spoke to Chris Foster and Greg Wolfe about the relative merits 
of Steve Hall and Shari Stack.  Their thinking was that Steve is probably a 
better "deep thinker" (to use Elizabeth's words) but that he might be bored 
with the routine transaction work that Shari seems to really enjoy.  He also 
doesn't have the ISDA background which would provide tremendous benefit to 
us.  Therefore, I think Shari is a better fit for our current needs.  

Having said that, I am extremely impressed with Steve.  He has a better 
handle on this California work than anyone I've worked with yet.  He seems 
really bright and responsive.  I talked to him last week about working for 
Enron and he seemed interested.  I didn't get into any details about our 
needs, but gauged his general level of interest in the work that he is doing 
for us and his willingness to consider jobs other than his current one.  He 
basically said that he would be happy to hear about opportunities here.  I 
was talking to Richard Sanders yesterday and he also is impressed with Steve 
and said that he had considered trying to hire him.  I don't know if there is 
a position for Steve or not.  I just wanted to give you feedback on my 
discussions with him.  Let me know if you need any help or information from 
me on this matter.

Regards,
Tim

Subject: pacificorp

this is the term sheet that was produced by pacificorp for the outage 
protection.  it looks like it was developed with input from aquila and swiss 
re.  swiss re is generally not interested in doing anything in the est now, 
so that could be the reason behind their ridiculous bid of $200m (which is 
still just heresay).

there is some price, eg $100m, at which this risk is manageable through a 
combination of advance hedging and dynamic hedging as their system 
experiences outages.  we have 8 days notice before having to deliver, so the 
weather-related spike risk is not that severe.

we are doing stochastic modeling of the risk now, and we expect the "fair 
value" to be less than $50m.

this is a 3-year deal, and one of the benefits is that they may pay the 
premium up front and expense it by year.

this is a complex structure, so let me know if you have questions.

FYI. Certain aspects of this presentation will relate to PPA's/tolling 
agreements/interconnection studies and agreements  relating to Enron 
developed generation assets from which we intend to purchase power, etc.  

The cost/benefit would probably be marginal for you, but I will be there, and 
will get you any interesting handouts.

Subject: Asset Financing - Structured Finance Presentation

We are planning a presentation on certain structure and contracting issues 
related to power plant asset financing on Thursday, May 10th.  The 
presentation will include lunch from Treebeard's and will begin at 11:30.  We 
have scheduled 2.5 hours for the presentation; it may be shorter, depending 
on the number of questions. 

We plan to include the Portland folks by video-conference.   If you know of 
others who would benefit from this presentation, please pass on this 
invitation; I have not intended to exclude anyone who may want to attend.  If 
there are others at remote locations, please let me or Dina Snow know so that 
we can arrange for video-conferencing.  John, I asked Shirley for the names 
of your contracts folks and have included them; I still have no information 
as to whom else you want to include.  Therefore, please forward this to your 
team members as you see fit.

I think Lisa's suggestion is a very positive way to get others involved in
the process as well as working through issues that credit managers may
raise
when they read through the proposed credit annex.

		 Subject: MPLP Capacity Charges

THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION HAS BEEN PREPARED AT THE REQUEST OF COUNSEL:

Per the voicemail I left you yesterday concerning the billing of capacity 
charges by Consumers for electric service provided by MPLP:

Background

MPLP went into service on October 1, 1995 and provides service under a PPA 
for a term that ends September 30, 2030.  Capacity charges are billed under 
Section 10(a) of the PPA, which references a schedule of capacity rates 
provided as Exhibit D.  Exhibit D:  (1) shows Consumers' avoided cost rates 
for 35 years and (2) converts these rates into the specific rates applied 
under Section 10(a).  Presumably, any QF that signed a contract with 
Consumers for a facility due to go on line in 1995 would be subject to 
payment under the same avoided cost rate schedule, although the way these 
rates were manipulated to achieve any particular agreement might vary from 
project to project (i.e., in the case of MPLP, the rates are "backloaded" 
over ten years before levelizing for the remaining term of the PPA).

Consumers', which "self-bills" under the PPA, began applying "Year 2" 
capacity rates under Exhibit D on January 1, 1996 and implemented subsequent 
increases on January 1 of 1997, 1998 and 1999.  January 1 rate increases were 
not anticipated by the partnership.  However, there is no definition for 
"contract year" under the PPA and Exhibit D shows rates by "Year" without 
specific reference to what constitutes a "Year" (i.e., "contract year" vs. 
"calendar year").  Based on Consumers' past actions, it would appear that 
their interpretation of the PPA has been that Schedule D sets rates that are 
effective in a particular calendar year.  (NOTE FROM A RATE GEEK:  This would 
generally jive with the manner in which the avoided cost rates are determined 
and scheduled.  That is, it's unlikely that Consumers ran a new avoided cost 
study each time it entered into a contract with a QF.  Rather, one could 
interpret Column (b) of Exhibit D to lay out the avoided cost rates in effect 
in calendar year 1995, 1996, etc.)  Further to this interpretation, Section 
10(a) also lays out the manner in which total capacity charges are adjusted 
"if for any calendar year, beginning with the second calendar year after the 
calendar year during which the Commercial Operation Date occurs..." the 
project fails to achieve a 60% "Contract Capacity Factor" (which is 
determined based on results for any calendar year).  Based on Consumers' 
action and this language, the partnership remained silent on the 
interpretation leading to the rate increase.

As a result of restructuring legislation passed in June 2000, Consumers now 
operates under a "fuel cap"; that is, its Power Service Cost Recovery (PSCR) 
rate is frozen.  Accordingly, whereas costs incurred under the PPA were 
previously a pass-through (i.e., via Consumers' PSCR and/or base rates), 
Consumers now has a strong incentive to minimize purchased power costs as any 
savings will, in theory, flow directly to shareholders.  

Issue

It should come as no surprise that Consumers' recently concluded that it has 
implemented capacity rate increases erroneously.  While no action has been 
taken to date, Consumers has indicated in the course of discussing the 
reverse tolling transaction for MPLP that it does not intend to implement a 
rate increase on January 1, 2001 but will defer the increase until October 1, 
2001.  There was no suggestion that Consumers would attempt to reconcile past 
capacity rate billing differences (i.e., "backbilling"), but we need to 
assume that they will go after this value as well.  

Three side notes on this issue:

To the extent rates were erroneously applied in the past, it would appear 
that these costs to Consumers would have been recovered from ratepayers; Mike 
Mazowita has indicated that he's seen regulatory filings that would support 
this point.  Accordingly, it would appear that Consumers would face some 
regulatory issues to the extent it considered "backbilling"; it's not clear 
yet how these would play out in light of the currently effective fuel cap.

We identified this issue during due diligence on MPLP and modeled capacity 
charges on a going forward basis in a manner that reflects a contract year 
interpretation that has capacity rates running from October 1 to September 
30.  Accordingly, we have minimal exposure on value but for the issue of 
backbilling, however...

We need to know what rates should be in effect January 1, 2001 in order to 
structure a reverse tolling transaction.  It goes without saying, but this is 
an untimely issue in the context of reverse tolling discussions with 
Consumers. 

Legal Questions

Do we have a valid claim that Consumers is required to implement a capacity 
rate increase on January 1, 2001?

Does Consumers have a claim to value lost (i.e., backbilling) as a result of 
the manner in which rate increases have been previously applied?

To the extent that Consumers does have a claim on backbilling, do we have a 
right to recovery from MCN as we were not the owner of the facility during 
most of the period of time during which rates may have been applied 
erroneously?

Do we have any claims against Dynegy as the MGP of the asset?  That is, did 
they have a fiduciary responsibility to (1) pursue/resolve the issue when it 
first came up or (2) reserve for future claims by Consumers based on a 
different (an potentially correct) interpretation of the contract?

Let me know when you'll be prepared to discuss this and I'll pull together 
the right group.

Attached please find a confirmation which contains the new definition of 
CAISO. Please use this as soon as possible going forward. Also, if 
counterparties want to amend past or outstanding confirmations to include 
this language - that is fine with me.  In addition, we need to be requesting 
that this definition be included in all counterparty confirms for Calif. 
Delivery Points.

I am working with Leslie Hansen to put this as the CAISO definition on EOL 
asap.

Please call me if you have any questions. 

Thanks!

Shari

Mark - Attached is a draft of a 3 year, 30 MW power transaction that Enron 
Canada Corp. is contemplating entering into with Atlantic Packaging Products 
Ltd.  The form of agreement is the one-off industrial form that is 
back-to-backed  by the British Energy supply source.  We have used this form 
for the Sunoco, TransCanada and Ivaco transactions.  As with the other 
agreements, the transaction is conditional on, among other things, Ontario 
Market opening occurring by November 30, 2001.

 As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More 
comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

Elizabeth,

We have started doing transactions with TVA on the desk and we would like to 
increase these transactions going forward.  Could you look at this language 
they sent us regarding opt out clauses and interruption premiums on energy 
deals.  Let me know what you think.

Subject: New Power QSE Agreement- execution copy

Michelle -- As discussed, attached is a redlined and an execution copy of the 
New Power QSE Agreement, for your review and transmission onwards to New 
Power's Anoush Farhangi.  The document is being cc'd to the EPMI recipients 
you had designated.  For their benefit I direct their attention to the 
confidentiality obligations stated in Section 7.2:  in particular, EPMI will 
be under obligations to keep New Power's scheduling and settlements 
information confidential from EES and EES personnel.
 
Michelle, please note to New Power that: (1) New Power still needs to fill in 
their contact/payments information on Schedule A. (2) the Enron Guarantee 
format was not referenced in the document as Schedule E and Schedule E was 
therefore eliminated.  Per the Credit Support Annex, each guarantee must be 
in a format acceptable to the other party.  (3) The lengthy ERCOT Calendar 
will be kept current on the MIS website, so it was not included as 
'Attachment X' to the document.

Please call me with any questions or comments. --David

Dear Elizabeth---Just wanted you to know I truly enjoyed meeting you today.
Thank you for taking the time to learn more about my background and to share
your Enron experience with me.  On reflection, I still think Enron is more of
a financial company than a tech company - tech/broadband is just one of
Enron's many facets.  A few years ago I think Enron was having trouble
deciding whether it was an energy company or a financial company - and
settled on the latter to chart its direction.  I think Enron's innovative
processes and approaches to problem solving are what make the prospect of
working with you so exciting.  I am most interested in the available
opportunity and look forward to hearing from you soon,

Alice Ginsburgh

Leslie- Just to let you know that I spoke with Harlan Murphy today and he is 
fine to use the "agreed" definition of CAISO Energy on Dynegy Direct. He said 
it should be  on the site in a couple of days. I told him that I would follow 
up w/ him next Mon. to make sure that it was there. 

He said that he still had an issue to sort out w/ you regarding ERCOT. 

Please let me know if I can be of further assistance.

Subject: RE: Sysco Energy Services and Sales Agreement 

The following are my thoughts on the draft (without discussion with Sysco): 

1.? In Section 1.3.2, why should curtailed usage be applied towards Excess 
Usage?? How is EESI at risk if Actual Usage (not including curtailed energy) 
is within the permitted band?? Same comment in Section 2.2.4.

2.????? In Section 3.5, if we don't elect to treat the Facility as a Closed 
Facility for purposes of Schedule 2.0 within 24 months, your draft would have 
us making Deficiency Usage payments forever, which is inconsistent with the 
rationale you provided for requiring a 24 month cut-off.? We assumed that 
after 24 months, if we didn't make an election, we would be required to make 
an Early Termination Payment. 

3.????? In Section 3.6, I will send some changes that reflect the fact that 
we can substitute a Closed Facility with multiple Substitute Facilities, so 
long as we bear any additional costs (which I think is what we discussed).? 
Also, in the last sentence of that Section, we had discussed treating Excess 
and Deficiency Usage situations the same as we usually do, which means that 
EESI might end up owing Sysco money for such Usage.? I'll send proposed 
changes on this point.

4.????? In Section 4.6, the language you deleted still needs to apply to 
(b)(iii), unless EESI is willing to agree to continue to be obligated.

I'll follow up with a mark-up later. 

Thanks.

A little forward movement trying to get the Global Counterparty not to set up 
counterparties under division or trade names.  If the counterparties insist 
on doing so, we have been trying to get them to add the legal name as part of 
the counterparty's name in GCP.   For non-swap team members, you may want to 
forward this email on to your groups as well.

		 Subject: Counterparty Name Conventions


In accordance with the suggestions provided by Mary Cook in our Legal Dept., 
we have come to an agreement in regard to the naming conventions for 
divisions and trade names. For both divisions and dba/trade names, the 
counterparty name will be formatted to lead with the sub-entity name, 
followed by the parent legal name.

 i.e. division name, division of parent legal name  or  trade name, a dba of 
parent legal name

 Ex. Duke Power, a division of Duke Energy Corporation

This layout will make it easier to choose the correct counterparty name and 
avoid the misconception of duplicate records. Also the legal requirements 
will be met.

Please notify me by Friday, June 8th, if there are any issues with this 
format. Otherwise, the GCP group will commence using this proposed layout on 
current and future requests. 

Cleanup of existing records in GCP and Contracts will be accessed. In cases 
where the requested name could exceed the 90 character length maximum there 
will need to be an evaluation.

If there are any questions, please contact me @ 3-6517.

Thank you,
Marilyn

Because WIO will be deciding issues involving the primary congested paths in 
the West, I believe the issues to be resolved by WIO may be very important.  
Accordingly, I have argued in-house (to anyone who will listen) that we 
should be arguing that WIO should be independent.  I don't believe that it is 
independent, it's a stakeholder board, like California and the WSCC, both of 
which we have had problems with. 

Historically, a number of people have worked on WIO.  Tom worked on it for a 
while.  Recently, I think Marcie Milner has been monitoring the meetings.  I 
think Steve Walton and DIck Ingersoll may also be following WIO to some 
degree.  Also Jim has suggested to Alan that he might want to be following 
"seams" issues.  A while ago Marcie asked me to review the governance 
structure.  I told her that I didn't like the lack of independence and 
suggested that we oppose it.  Nonetheless, I believe I was told that we had 
already agreed to it.

Subject: Western Connection Interface (WIO)

Christian,

Earlier this week you asked me to review a stack of documents (proposals and 
draft bylaws) relating to the proposed Western Interconnection Organization.  

Conclusion:  Based upon a quick review of the draft proposal, bylaws, and 
other materials, I see no major objections to Enron voting for the formation 
of the WIO.   The reason to vote for this organization would be to facilitate 
the development of uniform reliability standards and efficient electric 
markets in the Western Interconnection.  However, you should carefully 
consider the fact that the board of directors will be weighted towards 
transmission owners (who will have 8 of the 27 votes).  Power marketers, 
generators, and load-serving entities will only have 4 votes.  14 directors 
establish a quorum and the board only requires a majority vote of directors 
present, so it is conceivable that, for example, 15 directors show up, 8 of 
which are transmission owners, and the transmission owners are able to pass 
any resoultion they wish.  Related to this issue is the inability of one 
membership group, such as the power marketer's group, to be able to veto a 
proposal.  It will take three membership classes acting in unison, plus two 
other votes, to defeat a proposed action by the board.  Unfortunately, 
because I am not personally familiar with the internal dynamics of the WSCC 
membership, I am unable to offer any indication of the how much of a risk 
this presents.  

       Background and Overview
In General:  The Western Interconnection Organization ("WIO") will be formed 
by consolidating the Western Regional Transmission Association, the 
Southwestern Regional Transmission Association, the Northwestern Regional 
Transmission Association, and the Western States Coordinating Council (WRTA, 
SWRTA, NRTA, and WSCC, respectively) into one organization.  The WIO, a 
non-profit corporation, will assume and perform the functions of these 
organizations, and, eventually, those organizations will be disbanded.

The principal responsibilities of the WIO will be as follows:

 *The WIO will be the primary authority for promulgating regional 
reliability, operating, and procedural standards.
 *The WIO will work to resolve conflicting regional reliability standards, 
and work to develop compatible and efficient practices throughout the Western 
Interconnection.
 *The WIO will have no authority over commercial practices (but may work to 
promote compatible, efficient markets).
 *Provide a process for resolving disputes arising out of WIO functions and 
between WIO members.

Membership:

Any entity meeting the criteria for membership in one of the following 
membership classes may be Member of the WIO.  There are five classes of 
membership:  (1) Business entities owning more than 1000 miles of 
transmission lines, (2) Business entities owning less than 1000 miles of 
transmission lines; (3) Business entities that do not own, control, or 
operate transmission or distribution lines, e.g., power marketers, 
load-serving entities, independent power producers; (4) End users of 
electricity; and (5) Representatives of States and Provinces in the Western 
Interconnection.

 *Each class elects four (4) directors.
 *All of the classes select seven (7) non-affiliated directors, for a total 
of twenty-seven (27) directors.
 
Quorum:  A majority of all members, including a majority in at least three 
classes.  In the case of directors, there must be 14 directors.

Board Decisions:  A board decision requires a majority of the directors 
present.

Standing Committees:  There are three standing committees:  the Planning 
Coordination Committee, the Operating Committee, and the Market Interface 
Committee.  

Committee Voting:  For purposes of voting on recommendations to the board, 
committees are divided into three classes:  (1) transmission providers, (2) 
transmission customers, and (3) States and Provincial Members (which is Class 
5). In order to make a recommendation to the board, there must be a simple 
majority of votes from the transmission provider and transmission customer 
classes.

Termination:  The WIO can be terminated upon a vote of the majority of the 
members.

At the last EEI meeting there was a strong interest in beefing up the 
collateral provisions of the EEI (what a great idea).  Bill McCoy at Morgan 
Stanley was asked to prepare the first draft, a copy of which I am forwarding 
to you for your review. Please review and let either Shari or I know if you 
have any comments or thoughts - while EEI's message does not indicate when 
comments are due ( I have a call into EEI but have not yet heard back), I 
have asked Shari to help coordinate all comments so we can get back in touch 
with EEI within the next week or so.  Thanks for your input.

Andy,  As discussed, heer is MSDW's proposal for a draft version of a
Collateral Annex that can be used in connection with the EEI Agreement
(it would be advisable for a clause to be included in the EEI cover
sheet incorporating the collateral annex by reference).  We are offering
this draft as a starting point for the industry's efforts to develop an
EEI Collateral Annex.  Please feel free to distribute it and let Ed or
me know if you would like to have a conference call with others to
determine the next steps in getting feedback.  Bill McCoy
