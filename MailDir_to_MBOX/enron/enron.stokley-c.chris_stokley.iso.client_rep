The ISO Settlements group has determined that based on the available
information the "Market" payment amount by Enron should be $8,000,000 due on
May 31, 2001 by 10am.   This is based on the adjusted meter data submitted
by Enron between 3/14/01-3/24/01 and final settlement statements that have
been generated only to March 18th, which has updated the preliminary
statements to this date.  Along with this, we have calculated that the GMC
payment should be $460,532.
Please note that any true-ups to the exact settlement statement charges will
be reflected in the final settlement statements for the dates in which we
had to trend (3/18 through 3/24).  Adjusted Payment / Charges will be made
within the normal market mechanisms.

Good news.  See e-mail below.  Epstein is our Controller.  Spence is our
Director of Settlements.  Bill Regan is our Chief Financial Officer.
On another note, it has been requested that a detailed explanation be given
and what will be done to prevent this in the future.  I hope you can
understand the reasoning for this request.

Keoni,

	Take a look at the file you sent last time and you will notice
that it does not contain 4/13/01. As far as the 4/29/01 file, you have
finalized this and should be able to send it to me.

 <<Keoni.zip>> Chris, per your request here are the 480 and 1480 charges
that have been tracked to date for Enron.  Please keep in mind that the
systems have not been built to incorporate this data into our Settlements
process so the normal validations built into our Settlements process are not
applied to the manual tracking of these charges. Therefore, this data should
not be considered Settlement quality.  If these charges ever to become
effective the proper systems will be built to pull in this data into the
Settlement process. 

I checked with some folks and found out that FERC should rule on this during
September. 
Take care.

I will check on this.  I may be incorrect in the 12/21 date based on the
following quoted response that I found.  I will get further clarification.
"In its November 1, 2000, Order, FERC outlined a series of flaws in the
California markets and proposed a number of measured designed to reform the
market.  One of such proposals what that the ISO modify its single price
auction "so that bids above $150/MWh could not set the market clearing price
that is paid to all bidders and imposing certain reporting and monitoring
requirements for transactions and bids above the $150/MWh breakpoint."
Pursuant to FERC's November 1 Order, the ISO filed Amendment 33 with FERC on
December 8, 2000, which was approved on the same day.  On December 15, 2000,
FERC issued an Order Directing Remedies for California Wholesale Electric
Markets, and further clarified its December 8, 2000 Order.

Pursuant to Amendment 33, effective December 8, 2000, FERC authorized the
ISO to set a "soft" bid cap for the purchase of real-time energy.  The order
specified that although the ISO would pay those entities bidding above the
soft cap as bid, all bids above the breakpoint would be are subject to
market refund following FERC's review of the bid data "in order to ensure
just and reasonable rates".  Effective December 12, 2000, FERC's order
authorized the ISO to assess the costs of real-time purchases above the soft
cap and allocate to SCs which under-schedule load the difference between the
interval MCP and the bid price above the soft cap bid prices to SCs which
underschedule load.  The ISO created CT 487 to accomplish this allocation.

Please see the following excerpt from the FERC December 15, 2000, order,
Docket No. EL00-95-000, et al:

"On December 8, 2000, the ISO filed Tariff Amendment No. 33 in Docket No.
ER01-607-000, seeking expedited consideration of tariff revisions to address
emergency reliability conditions.  The filing sought three modification of
the ISO's tariff: (1) immediate implementation of an interim price
mitigation proposal based on the breakpoint concept that was proposed in the
November 1 Order (at $250/MWh) to encourage greater participation of
generators in its markets; (2) provision of penalties on generators that
fail to respond to dispatch instructions during a system emergency, to
become effective December 8, 2000; and (3) allocation of the costs of
obtaining additional energy to Scheduling Coordinators who rely on the ISO's
real-time Imbalance Energy market, as an incentive to loads to purchase
energy in the forward markets.  The ISO requested an effective date of
December 12, 2000 for the third modification.

The commission approved the tariff revisions in an order issued December 8,
2000, with the effective dates requested by the ISO."

After an extensive review, the ISO has concluded that the charges for
purchases above the soft cap break point (currently set at $150/mwh),
although high, are consistent with the filing approved by FERC.  FERC
continues to review the just and reasonableness of all bids dispatched in
our real-time market that are above the $150.00 breakpoint, and will order
market refund if the dispatched bid price is not found to be just and
reasonable.  The ISO continues to review this issue, and is considering
alternative allocation methods, which would continue to be consistent with
the tariff. "

Thanks for the info Keoni.  I need further clarification.  If the price Cap
went into effect on 12/21/00, how is the CAISO able to charge above the
$150.00 soft price CAP in Uninstructed Energy (407) for 12/22/00-12/31/00?

I have not had time to really delve into the details of the plan but thought
I would let you know that the Market Stabilization Plan will have a big
impact on your business practices, just as 10-minute settlements did.  We
realize the pain 10 minute settlements brought, and continues to bring, and
we've expressed that any future changes needs to be done in a more pragmatic
manner.  I can only keep my fingers crossed.  Anyway, the implementation
date is June 1, so I thought I would send this out as a heads up.  I'm also
attached the filing.    Keep in mind that this is a detailed narrative and
the ISO believes that FERC will issue its order regarding market power
mitigation within the next 1-2 weeks, which would incorporate their review
of the narrative filing.  Specific tariff language would then be completed
and filed.

As a follow-up to the request I made from our Finance department here is a

I haven't heard from the person in Settlements that sent me the worksheets
to clarify the amounts adjusted.  Just thought I'd let you know.  I'll keep
after him first thing in the morning.

This is a draft, work in progress only.  Sorry for sending bits and pieces
but please realize we had a very short time frame in implementing the FERC
Order.  The folks I have working on these questions are from Market
Analysis, Legal, Comliance, Operations, and my Grandmother.

I have a request in for clarification, however, I believe that these are the
scheduled re-runs for settlements for post-final disputes that require
re-runs.  For example, your August 7, 8, and 9 disputes that have yet to be
adjusted, are scheduled for adjustment on June 29th.  Not all post-final
disputes need a market re-run, therefore, some of your postfinal disputes
may be done on an earlier date.  Once they do, I will be notified and then I
will in turn let you know.  At any rate, I will make sure my assumption here
is correct.

I confirmed that since Enron does not deviate from their schedules in real
time a good portion of the payments have been going to Enron.  It is still
up in the air what they will do with these charges.

Folks, because of the many meetings that take place and the difficulty of
staying on top of all the separate issues I thought I would forward to you a
newsletter put together by my former VP, Susan Schnieder (now a private
consultant).  These newsletters are nice in that they summarize the issues
in a concise, simple to review, format.  If you are interested in
subscribing her number is on the newsletter below.  The newsletters also
summarize the board meetings, such as the one in the last attached e-mail.

November Board Meeting
Part 1:  Voting Items
February 21st, 2001

Attached are the following documents:

>  First attachment:  February 21st Board Event Report, Part 1 (covering
Board votes at this meeting)

Despite the lengthy agenda, the Board made decisions on just two items:  The
Summer 2001Demand Response Program bid awards, and the third Metcalf
Substation transformer - altogether, around $100 million of decisions.

The remaining items were discussed (except Market Power Mitigation, where no
documents were issued and there was no discussion), but decisions were
deferred until at least the next Board meeting, scheduled for February 28th
(see below).  We'll cover the highlights of those discussions in Part 2 of
the Board Event Report (Management updates and other non-voting items),
which will reach you tomorrow or early Saturday.

>  Second attachment:  Updated calendar showing tentative Board meeting
dates through the end of March.

November Board Meeting
Part 2:  Management Reports and Other Non-Voting Items
February 21st, 2001

Attached are the following documents:

>  First attachment:  February 21st Board Event Report, Part 2.

A warning/apology:  This report is pretty long, even after condensation of
background and discussion sections, because it includes all the items
deferred for decision as well as the regular status reports.  As usual, we
use subtitles and font variation liberally to aid you in skimming.

A clarification about Market Power Mitigation:  While there was no written
or oral discussion about any Management proposals, there were "Public
Comment" remarks on that topic, and limitd discussion of those comments by
the Board.  They're covered in today's report.

> Remaining attachments: Previous reports referenced in today's report.

underschedule and folks over all scheduled appropriately.

	Take a look at the file you sent last time and you will notice
that it does not contain 4/13/01. As far as the 4/29/01 file, you have
finalized this and should be able to send it to me.

Chris,

I am working with John Rutledge on getting the Load Desk database up.  One of the data sources is the MV90 data coming from CSC.  I have learned that you are also in need of this data in order to compare our trades with actual consumption.  Attached is the proposal CSC gave us that outlines the tasks and the cost.  Are you the one who needs to approve it or does someone else usually approve such charges?

Thanks,
Charles

If it needs to come in after the calendar date on the far left, then we need

I received confirmation:  The Soft cap at $250.00, was effective on 12/08/00
and the soft cap at $150.00 was effective on 01/01/01.  Sorry for the
confusion, but there are so many changes going on its hard to keep up.  Here
is another market notice with further clarification on allocation:

-----Original Message-----
From:	CRCommunications
Sent:	Wednesday, January 31, 2001 4:38 PM
To:	SC Settlements Contacts
Cc:	ISO Market Participants
Subject:	CAISO Notification -  New Charge Types - Soft Cap


Effective trade day December 12, 2000, pursuant to Amendment 33, the ISO
will allocate the amount paid to purchase Energy above the soft price cap
and for energy procured out-of-market to those Scheduling Coordinators who
underschedule load or overschedule generation.  The ISO has developed the
following two new Charge Types for these Settlements.

CT 481 - Soft Cap Payment to SCs
The ISO will compensate Instructed Energy providers for energy instructed at
a price above the MCP in two parts.  The amount of instructed energy
delivered will be compensated in Charge Type 401 at the interval MCP.  The
difference between the interval MCP and the bid in price above the soft cap
will be compensated in Charge Type 481.

CT 487 - Soft Cap Cost Allocation to Market
The total payments made by ISO in charge type 481 will be allocated on a
regional basis to SCs based on their net negative Uninstructed Energy in the
corresponding region through Charge Type 487.  Units providing Regulation
are exempted from the charge type 487.

The supporting details for charge type 481 and 487 will be provided in the
Instructed/Uninstructed Energy Detail Records in the Imbalance Energy/No Pay
Settlement Detail File.  The Uninstructed energy file contains a new section
called Excess Cost section.  These statement file changes are reflected in
version 12.2a of the Settlement Statement File Specification which was
distributed to TSWG and SC Settlements Contacts January 30, 2001.

See note below. This is a mess.  I'm trying to get what the prices should be
for the error referenced below.  That way you can take the correct price,
figure out what your A/S obligation and payment should be, and pay that
accordingly.  This suggestion is not recommended by the ISO as the ISO
expects the market to pay their invoices in whole, however, when we only pay
two cents on the dollar, this is an alternative that you may want to
consider.

See inserted comments in parentheses.

Restating what I think you have indicated below,
biomass generators are not required to submit heat rate data (correct), but
they are
included in the FERC Order Program in that any "excess" capacity is bid in
to the ISO at a price of $0.  Is that correct? (You are required to "offer"
all available capacity to the ISO but the ISO will only insert a $0 standing
bid for those units that we have good data as to their available generation
(i.e. major PGA units). Can they submit heat rate
data if they want so a proxy price north of $0? (Proxy bid price are only
calculated for gas-fired units. If they don't want to be a price taker (i.e.
have a bid of $0), they simply need to bid their available capacity into the
real-time market at whatever bid price they feel is appropriate.)
