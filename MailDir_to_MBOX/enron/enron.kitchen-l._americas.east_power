No material current exposure, but we are continuing to review the BNY deal.  The CRO from EME indicated to me that he and the CFO were doing a road show to communicate the current position and direction for the company and said they include Enron.  I am still trying to schedule.

I'll keep you informed.

Given recent events, we are looking to cover our long protection ($15mm) in Edison Mission Energy.  Will keep the position if you are still interested or can sell it to ENA.  Bonds have rallied in, still looking for a market in the Default Swaps.  Pls. let me know if you have any interest.

We received their redraft of the doc yesterday, it needed a lot of work.  We will return the draft on Monday morning.  We are combining the QSE contract into the Energy Management Agreement.  In addition, there is a master purchase agreement as well.  This results in quite a bit of legal work.  TECO indicated they are undermanned at this time and the turnaround will be slow. From a business concept standpoint we really don't have any "deal killer" issues.   I think we can get the deal done by the quarter's end at the latest and probably late next week.  But then depends on TECO's turnaround time.  Stuart Zisman and Mark Haedicke are going to meet with Lavo on Wednesday to talk legal risks associated with this deal and these types of deals.  I'll be there and I'll let you know the time in case your are interested.

We have a verbal okay from El Paso to go to the insurance wrappers and get structure/pricing.  The insitituions will then pitch this back to us both (El Paso and Enron) for a decision.  Once the decision is made, the process should be fairly swift.

As a back up plan, Joe asked the institutions to have the insurers look at a wrap without fixing the confidentiality/guarantee and using an Enron to fill any potential holes.  We'll then be able to balance timing vs proceeds vs legal risk.

I have been working with Lehman and BofA this morning in an attempt to get a letter by close of business today so as to be in front of the insurance wrappers this week.

Cornhusker on track.  Ultimate (or perhaps penultimate) meeting on transaction docs this afternoon.

All projects are owned in a TRS/FOE structure (Total Return Swap / Friend o=
f Enron) as a result of our continued ownership in Portland General.

The two current East project companies are Motown and Cornhusker.

Motown consists of two 50% interests and has TRS of about $56 million and i=
s on the balance sheet for about $2 million:

Michigan Power - 129 MW power plant fully contracted for power 20+ years an=
d 14 remaining years of fixed cost gas.  The PPA is deep in the money versu=
s cost to generate (even after the swapped gas in 2015).  Dynegy operates a=
nd is Managing General Partner ("MGP") and Operator.  Fair performance reco=
rd on both at best.  Michigan is currently entering into QF stranded cost f=
ilings and the time is near to propose a restructuring.  We have waited for=
 about 9 months as Doug Clifford (the origination on the purchase) had been=
 attempting to purchase Dynegy's interest (they have too high a book value =
and are accrual based).

The proposed restructuring will take the form of an upfront payment in retu=
rn for an option to provide power from the market.  This approach gives Con=
sumer's (a BBB credit) much needed cash at a time when they are significant=
ly underrecovering due to increased fuel costs and set fuel recovery rates.=
 Consumer's ( like many other utilities) has a hard time seeing their expos=
ure (purchased power cost certainty for the volume and term) and doesn't se=
e any regulatory filing complications with their current stranded cost fili=
ngs.

The amended PPA is a non-unit contingent power short which we fill long-ter=
m with a contract from the power desk.  The desk takes the obligation becau=
se Generation Investments provides a full backstop pricing through their ow=
nership of the plant and the swapped gas (we either float past the swapped =
gas or contract for differences those years with the gas desk).  The PPA an=
d desk contract are securitized in the capital markets for the term of the =
PPA at 1.05 DSCR and about 75 bps over Consumer's current corporate bonds. =
 The plant essentially becomes a $0 NPV machine and the power desk has sign=
ificant optionality to call from the market rather than the plant for 20+ y=
ears.  During the term of the swapped gas, when the plant isn't called by t=
he desk we can sell the gas into the market for a profit.

It is fairly easy to see the increased value.  The project is currently pro=
ject financed at about 1.5 DSCR for about 14 years (lots of cash).  The des=
k has significant optionality and always a matched cost supply with the pla=
nt.  The plant gains efficiency due to revised O&M, insurance, reserves, et=
c. which are no longer required due to the removal of project financing.

Difficulties - Dynegy and Consumers.  Consumers can be rational.  Dynegy ei=
ther must sell or play along.  Current operational/project management issue=
s which Dynegy caused may make their interest available.

Ada - 29 MW plant fully contracted for power 20+ years.  Enron is the MGP. =
 GE operates for us.  50% owned by ConEd.  Fixed gas through 2008.  We woul=
d propose a restructuring at the same time as Michigan Power (this would le=
ave Consumers with only one unrestructured PPA).  Currently revisiting buyi=
ng ComEd's interest.

Cornhusker -  TRS of about $206 and about $24 on balance sheet.  A 100% int=
erest in a single 250 MW plant in Texas.  Small Coop which is very litigiou=
s.  Plant has had some rather spectacular failures (I have pictures which m=
ake the engineers on our floor shudder which I would be glad to pass along)=
 but the PPA only requires 60% availability before significantly in the mon=
ey capacity payments are reduced (essentially an impossible to reach loss).=
  The failures have been equipmentmanufacturer related (Westinghouse 501F).=
  Carl Tricoli spent the first 7 months (upto February) trying to sell the =
project to the Coop.  We spent last month determining that the Coop will ne=
ver buy the project (they just don't have the $ and we are a very expensive=
 lender.  We're taking a last stab at a restructuring proposal in the comin=
g month and upon appraisal of the Coop's intentions, we'll potentially ente=
r the sell mode.  El Paso has indicated an interest in the project already =
as the ex-Citizen's employee's over there attempted to restructure some tim=
e ago.  If we sell the closing should be by 9/30/01.

Again, I apologize for the delay in getting you this info.  Call with quest=
ions.

Louise

Thanks for the note about Dave.  I do not know Dave but will probably pay him a visit in Boston to see what we might do with them.   Acitivity out of their northeast office has primarily been on the nat gas side, but with their recent acquistion of Central Hudson's generation assets in NY they have been getting more active in power.  

I have been meaning to swing by and introduce myself on one of my trips to Houston, and will be sure to do so on the next trip.

Just in case you meet him - there is a guy who left Enron yesterday to join Dynegy in Boston.  Dave has been with Enron since 1996 (I think), joining as an associate and leaving as a VP.  Dave wanted to relocate back to the North East.

I've worked with Dave for about 4 years and he a very straightforward guy, I have no idea how much we do with Dynegy but Dave may be a good contact for you.

Louise -

We've negotiated an MOU with Alstom that has helped us fix the purchase price for CFB based power plants.  It does not commit us to spend any money today; it's really just a strong guideline for what the EPC will look like.

Having said that, Alstom considers it a BIG deal, and they are flying in some heavies from Paris for the signing ceremony.  The guy below is the lead person from Paris.  Additionally, Fritz Gautschi, Alstom's Country President will be coming.

Bottom line:  It's tentatively scheduled for the morning of 17 October here in Houston.  If you and Dave are available, I'll coordinate.  You won't need to sign, just provide some presence.  There's still some flexibility if that day doesn't work for you.

Thanks,

Mitch

Louise,

The attached, with some minor revisions to be discussed by ENA's business team today, is the return draft that we intend to send to AIG and their counsel before the end of the day.  As discussed in Friday's meeting, I have arranged a lawyers only conference call for this afternoon (2:00p.m.) to apprise AIG counsel (Jay Grushkin at Milbank Tweed) of the NASD Rule that likely prevents ENA from collecting its brokerage fee in the manner contemplated by the LOI.  I'll apprise you of those discussions later today.

Hey guys, don't mean to be a broken record here, but this is a regular occurence now. What's not working? Should we find an alternate solution for pricing and hedging these deals? Give me a call or let's set up some time to discuss. Thanks.

Louise,
Here are some bullet points for the discussions tomorrow:
-East Power, including Generation Investments made about $50 million in the first half. The greatest contribution came from Ben Jacoby, about $15 million. By the way, I hired Ben along with Scott Healy to acquire sites in 1998.
-All of the traders and structuring, including Bernie Aucoin told me that John Llodra drove both the CMP and NStar deals. Total income $8.5 million.
-I believe Delainey was correct in saying that Ozzie was the brains behind Alamac but Heather did the execution. Total income for the East $7.5 million.
-Most of the rest of the deals were done after I came in.
-Mid market sales have increased.(700% over the first half of 2000)
-This group was in meltdown when I came in(at least on the origination side). I would like to get some credit for stopping the bleeding and starting the rebuilding process in a difficult environment.

Subject: CSFB Independent Power Weekly--Issue #48; IPPs Rose
0.6%;Califor nia Contracts Get Some Attention; Major Earnings Week Ahead


 <<IPW102201.pdf>> 
Good Morning,

Attached, please find the latest issue of our Independent Power Weekly.

Summary:
1. IPPs Rise 0.6%   Last week our IPP composite rose 0.6%, outperforming
both the S&P 500 (-1.7%) and the NASDAQ (-1.9%).  Mirant, which was up 5.2%,
was the strongest generator in the group.  International Power was the
weakest performer, declining 5.8%.

2. Generation Oriented Utilities Fall 0.8%   Our universe of generation
oriented utilities declined 0.8%, outperforming both the S&P 500 and NASDAQ,
while underperforming the UTY (+0.6%).  Constellation Energy, which was up
3.3%, was the strongest performer in the group.  Black Hills was the weakest
performer, declining 5.6%.

3. California Contracts Dominate Investor Attention   Last week there was
some renewed concern among investors that the State of California would
attempt to renegotiate its 53 power sales contracts with various power
generators and marketers.  Over the long-term we see minimal risk for the
generators.  We believe California has few legal options with respect to
these agreements.  Further, the signing of these contracts played a key role
in reigning in spot power prices in the state.  Finally, Governor Davis
apparently does not support a massive contract renegotiation effort.  

4. Some Headline Risk Remains   The only issue we see involves headline
risk.  While the Governor and his administration appear to be taking a
restrained approach with regard to the contracts, political pressure to
renegotiate continues to grow from the CPUC and the state Attorney General's
office.  While we ultimately expect such efforts to be unsuccessful, in the
near term this issue will continue to attract media attention.  

5. Earnings Season Upon Us   This week the bulk of the IPP's and generation
oriented utilities are scheduled to report earnings.  In the IPP group,
results are expected from: AES, CPN and RRI.  In the generation oriented
utility group, results are expected from: CNL, DPL, ETR, FPL, PPL and XEL.
We expect capital discipline to be a recurring theme emphasized by companies
on their upcoming conference calls.  In response to stock prices which are
trading below private market asset values, we expect management teams across
the sector to de-emphasize growth and begin using stricter hurdle rates when
evaluating new investment opportunities.

Neil Stein   212/325-4217

Actually we have been waiting for TECO to return the draft, they we supposed to get it to us on Monday morning.  We are still waiting.  We scrapped the trip to Tampa tonight.  But there are no problems and they still want to proceed.  I expect to close by Tuesday.  I'll keep you posted.

Wes,

Just a note to confirm that on behalf of NCPH, the LLC that owns the Elizabethtown and Lumberton coal facilities in North Carolina, we have entered into a eight year contract with the coal desk.  For lack of an index, the contract is a cost based requirements contract which provides for physical delivery of coal to the Lumberton Handling facility.  The contract also allows NCPH to lock prices at an offer in-lieu of cost as we have done for the balance of 2001 for $72/ton in order to manage the CPL off take agreement.  Presently this is an intercompany transaction as NCPH is a wholly owned subsidiary of ENA with accrual treatment, however this contract is part of the sale of NCPH to AIG which will yield a true third party contract and MTM treatment.  The negotiations of the SPA and other agreements are going well and we will keep you apprised.

Regards,
Ozzie Pagan

Subject: CSFB Independent Power Weekly; Notes from EEI Included


 <<IPW110501.pdf>> 
Good Morning,

Attached, please find the latest issue of our Independent Power Weekly.

Summary:
1. IPPs Fall 3.7%   Last week our IPP composite declined 3.7%,
underperforming both the S&P 500 (-1.6%) and the NASDAQ (-1.3%).
International Power, which was up 4.0%, was the strongest generator in the
group.  Mirant was the weakest performer, declining 15.1%.

2. Generation Oriented Utilities Fall 0.2%   Our universe of generation
oriented utilities declined 0.2%, outperforming all major indices including
the UTY (-1.2%).  Black Hills, which was up 5.2%, was the strongest
performer in the group.  Entergy was the weakest performer, declining 3.8%.

3. Notes from EEI Conference   The 36th annual Edison Electric Institute
financial conference was held on October 28-31 in New Orleans, LA.  This
event was attended by the bulk of the investor-owned utilities and a few of
the pure play Independent Power Producers.  Discussions between the
conference participants at EEI revolved around 3 dominant themes: 1. The
state of the generation market; 2. Development activity slowing/Value driven
M&A activity possible; and, 3. Enron exposure.

4. Prevailing Mood at EEI: Uncertainty   Versus last year's conference, the
prevailing mood at EEI was one of uncertainty.  Given developments in the
equity market, commodity market and regulatory arenas, some investor concern
is not surprising.  However, we remain positive on the prospects of the
owners and developers of power generation assets for 2 reasons: 1. Long-term
industry fundamentals remain intact; and, 2. Current concerns are
discounted/IPPs trading at 20% below private market value.

5. Selectivity is Important; Focus On the Major IPPs: Highlighting CPN, MIR
and NRG   We continue to highlight Calpine (CPN, Strong Buy), Mirant (MIR,
Buy) and NRG Energy (NRG, Buy).  Owing to their combination of geographic
diversification, large scale operations and substantial hedging, our
analysis indicates that these companies are best positioned to deliver
sustainable earnings and growth in the face of volatile power market
conditions.  We believe the current environment should serve as a catalyst
to differentiate these companies from their peers.  

6. Debt Market Update   Last week Enron remained the focus of debt investor
attention, fueling a high level of trading activity for the IPPs.  Credit
spreads continue to be negatively influenced by concerns regarding exposure
to Enron.

Neil Stein   212/325-4217

El Paso Unveils Wholesale Trading Desk.

Business News Americas
Copyright 1996 - 2001 Business News Americas (BNamericas.com)

El Paso Energy InternationalTransportadora Brasileira Gasoduto
Bolivia-Brasil S.A.Gas Transboliviano S.A.

United States power company El Paso yesterday unveiled a wholesale
trading and risk management platform at its US$10mn headquarters in Rio
de Janeiro, which will cover all of El Paso's Latin American operations,
the company said in a statement.
"With the implementation of merchant power stations [in Brazil] the
company will begin to commercialize electric energy on the wholesale
market for distributors and large clients," El Paso said.

The trading desk has 54 stations, and is similar to that of a
stockbroker trading house, the company explained. It is the same system
used by El Paso's Merchant Energy Group at the company's Houston
headquarters, with 300 traders, and in London, where it has 150 traders.

Contracts are closed through the wholesale energy market (MAE) or
through bilateral contracts, El Paso explained.

The trading desk is part of El Paso's strategic shift to concentrate on
developing regional bases with integrated businesses, from exploring,
extracting and transporting natural gas to thermoelectric power
generation and electricity trading. Some US$5bn will be invested in
Brazil through 2005.

As well as a number of exploration and production activities in Brazil,
El Paso has generating projects under way or under evaluation which will
total 2,625MW installed capacity:

The projects are 100% ownership of the 400MW Manaus natural gas plant in
Amazonas state that began operations in 1997; 100% of the 870MW Macae
Merchant natural gas thermoelectric project in Rio de Janeiro, scheduled
to begin 200MW operations in September 2001 and full production in 2002;
50% of the 350MW Porto Velho thermoelectric project in Roraima,
scheduled for operations in September 2001. The plant will initially use
diesel fuel, until a natural gas pipeline can be built to supply the
plant, which will the be converted to use three natural gas turbines and
one steam turbine. Brazil's CS Participacoes the remaining 50%.

An additional projects is the 480MW Araucaria thermoelectric project in
Parana state, scheduled to begin operations in mid-2002, with two
natural gas turbines and one steam turbine. El Paso owns a 60% stake
while Brazil's Copel and Petrobras subsidiary Gaspetro each own 20%.

Projects under evaluation are the 300MW Termocatarinense Norte -
Guaramirim thermoelectric project in Santa Catarina, in which El Paso
owns 70%; and the 225MW Paracambi thermoelectric project in Rio de
Janeiro that would produce 125MW from early 2002 followed by a further
100MW from 2003. El Paso would own 100% of this project.

El Paso also owns a 9.67% stake in TBG, the Brazilian management company
of the Bolivia-Brazil natural gas pipeline, and a 2% stake in Bolivian
management company GTB.

 Kevin,   <?xml:namespace prefix =3D o ns =3D "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:of=
fice:office" />

EWC requires three clarifications to the PPA in order to get the project fi=
nanced and sold.  All previously requested amendments proposed by the equit=
y purchaser have been dropped, and EWC will take the resulting pricing redu=
ction. =20

I want to make sure you understand how minor these three clarifications are=
.   These clarifications conform to the original deal and are NOT changes t=
o the deal. =20

 1.  Banking Provisions.   EWC and EPMI agreed that energy and renewable en=
ergy credits ("RECS") produced by the Indian Mesa II wind generating facili=
ty in any year in excess of the annual minimum quantity would, on a cumulat=
ive basis, offset any deficiencies of energy and RECS in subsequent years. =
Section 4.04 of the agreement does not clearly provide the cumulative carry=
over mechanism which was contemplated by the parties. (This section origina=
lly provided for the carryover, but in an effort to simplify the language, =
the aggregate carryover concept was clouded.)  Both the project lenders and=
 the proposed equity purchaser have required that the point be clarified.  =
There has never been a disagreement between EPMI and EWC on the intention o=
f the carryover banking provisions. EPMI's most recent refusal to make this=
 clarification now appears to be a change in the original deal

 2.  Grid Curtailment EWC and EPMI  drafted the contract  with specific pro=
visions relating to  termination resulting from grid curtailment, Section 5=
.04  .  There is an ambiguity in that grid curtailment could also be covere=
d  under the termination provision relating  to force majeure under Section=
 5.02.  This  inconsistency is the problem.  Neither EWC nor EPMI were to p=
ay damages to the other party in the event of grid curtailment.  The propos=
ed equity purchasers have requested that the force majeure provisions of  t=
he PPA  be clarified to make it clear that extended grid curtailment would =
not give rise to termination payments.  This clarification is consistent wi=
th the original intent of the parties and is not a change to the deal.

 3.  EPMI Credit Support.  EPMI's obligations under the PPA are guaranteed =
by Enron.  The Indian Mesa II PPA permits EPMI to assign the PPA to certain=
 affiliates without consent of the seller.   Any assignment by EPMI would n=
ot relieve it of its duties and obligations under the contract, and the Enr=
on guarantee would remain in place.  However, the project lenders have requ=
ired clarification that the Enron guarantee would either explicitly remain =
in place or that the assignee would have a credit quality at least as good =
as Enron Corp's credit quality.  The project lender's have also requested t=
hat the termination payment provisions be clarified to provide that any sub=
stitute PPA used to calculate a termination payment would also need to be w=
ith a party that had a credit quality similar to Enron Corp's, since that i=
s the credit that is supporting the Indian Mesa II PPA.  This will not affe=
ct the value of the contract to a third party since Enron bears this obliga=
tion unless released by the project.

Under the dispute resolution provisions of the PPA we could certainly pursu=
e declaratory relief under arbitration.  Our sense is that this does nothin=
g but ensure delay.

 From an Enron perspective:

?     The sale of the equity and the financing of the non-recourse debt on =
the Indian Mesa II project is currently at a standstill due to issues surro=
unding the ambiguities in the PPA

?      While the debt financing for the Indian Mesa I project is in place (=
different offtaker) the proposed equity sale to AEP is linked to the sale o=
f the Indian Mesa II project.

?     If Enron cannot move forward with the financing of the project within=
 the next month, Enron will likely end up with approximately $153M less cas=
h at year end than it counted on in its plan, in addition to any decrease i=
n planned earnings

?    The after-tax return to Enron in a "hold" situation is 0%, due to Enro=
n being in the Alternative Minimum Tax position, i.e. it cannot use the tax=
 benefits.

It was clear in the discussions with the City of San Antonio that these cla=
rifications would have had no affect on value.  =20

I would like to make the message even more clear.  EPMI will not be making =
any changes, amendments, clarifications, interpretations, etc. to the curre=

I don't think it is productive to spend any more time on this discussion.  =

Dear Enron Friends

Some of you may know that I have been recently diagnosed with non-small cell
lung cancer.  This Wednesday May 23 I will have this cancerous tumor removed.
Hopefully that will be it and all will return to normal shortly and you will see
me again soon.  It is my understanding that I will be in the hospital for about
1 week and they say I will be down for another six (6) weeks after that.
Apparently they have not dealt with anyone that has the same tenacity and
inability to sit still as me.  At any rate I'll be out for a while.

During my absense my assistant, Karla Hesketh,  will continue to do the same
wonderful job that she has done for all of us throughout the years.  I have a
very good friend, John Vollen who is a rep for ABB out in the Great Northwest
that has graciously volunteered to come to Houston for 2-3 days a week for as
long as necessary to help us with the Enron business.  Randy Hayes will also
help John and will provide introductions when necessary and appropriate.  Please
welcome John as you have me in the past.  You will find that he is eager to help
and very capable.  He has been in sales for ten years and is a graduate
engineer.  Just don't get to used to him as I will return.

After I get home I'll call to check on all of you and make sure that all is well
with business and you personally.  I am very grateful to have the Enron account
and I have grown close to many of you and enjoy working on the interesting, and
yes, sometimes challenging projects that we are faced with.

Again, please continue to work with John and Karla as you have worked with me in
the past.  I'll keep you updated as to my progress.

Best Regards,
Mike

Given recent events, we are looking to cover our long protection ($15mm) in Edison Mission Energy.  Will keep the position if you are still interested or can sell it to ENA.  Bonds have rallied in, still looking for a market in the Default Swaps.  Pls. let me know if you have any interest.

Here's my understanding of what has happened with the interest rate swaps:

As I indicated earlier, the original $32mm was put on for the Linden 6 expansion which never occurred.
The second swap of $350mm was put on to protect the value of the cash flow from El Paso assuming we would monetize the asset shortly. This hedge does appear to have been set with the El Paso payment stream in mind.
The original $32mm of swaps DID NOT provide a clean hedge to the remaining El Paso cash flows as they were 10 year bullets while the El Paso payment stream is a 7 year monthly amortizer.
However, the $382mm of hedges did approximate notionally the asset to be hedged.

It appears that given the assumption the swaps were to have been monetized in a short period of time, a decision may have been made that unwinding and rewinding the "dirty" interest rate hedge was more expensive than wearing the basis risk for a brief time.
Given that the monetization never occurred, it does appear to me that the $32mm hedge is ineffective and should be removed or replaced if we determine that we should hedge the rate risk associated with the note.

Anyone have anything additional to add? That's the best I could turn up looking back after the fact given the many personnel departures.

Subject: CSFB Independent Power Weekly; IPPs Rose 5% Last Week;
7%Private Market Value Discount Remains


 <<IPW111901.pdf>> 

Good Morning,

Attached, please find the latest issue of our Independent Power Weekly.

Summary:
1. IPPs Rise 5.0%   Last week our IPP composite rose 5.0%, outperforming the
S&P 500 (+1.6%) and the NASDAQ (+3.8%). AES Corp (AES), which was up 22.2%,
was the strongest generator in the group followed by Reliant Resources (RRI)
which rose 11.0%.  Orion Power (ORN) was the weakest performer, rising 1.2%.

2. Generation Oriented Utilities Fall 2.8%   Our universe of
generation-oriented utilities fell 2.8%, in-line with the UTY (-2.5%).
Black Hills (BKH), Cleco (CNL) and Constellation Energy (CEG) all rose less
than 1%.  Allegheny Energy was the weakest performer, down 7.6%.

3. ENE/DYN + Attractive Valuations Boost Stock Prices   Last week was the
3rd consecutive week of positive stock price performance for the group.
Driving stock prices higher, investors continued to grow more comfortable
with the Enron situation following confirmation of Dynegy's intention to
acquire Enron and provide immediate liquidity support by investing $1.5
billion.  Further, we believe the group simply remains oversold.  The pure
play power producers are trading at a 7% average discount to their private
market asset values.  

4. Notes From Mirant Meeting   Mirant hosted an upbeat analyst meeting last
Tuesday.  MIR reiterated that 80% of its 2002 forecast is supported by
earnings from hedged (generation and natural gas) and franchise businesses
(distribution).  MIR also provided an in-depth review of how it accounts for
its risk management activities.  Management noted that it could maintain its
credit rating without any new equity issuance over the next 12 months.
However, it would be eager to access the equity market should conditions
improve in the near-term.  

5. Power Market Update   Last week the US power markets were generally weak
across the country owing to mild weather and falling natural gas prices.
While the Mirant National Power Index fell 17.1% last week, the Natural Gas
Week composite spot price fell 23.2%.  Spark spreads improved in the
Northeast and Texas, while compressing in California and the Southeast.  

6. Debt Market Update   Credit spreads tightened across the sector last week
due to diminished ENE concerns and positive stock price performance.

Georganne -

Attached is a brief presentation demonstrating 3 methods of correlating gas and power prices in Texas.  All show a high correlation (>85%).  This is to show Arthur Andersen that John's Nymex swap is a good hedge for the coal plant build option.

The spreadsheet provides the raw data.

My recommendation is to use the "Liquidated Price" method since it uses historical MW Daily and Gas Daily indexes and does not rely on internal curves.

Mitch

Thanks. I scheduled a meeting for tomorrow at 9:30 AM. I've attached a copy of the Doyle DASH which I would like you to sign tomorrow (we expect to have Haedicke's signature by then).

Hope the couple sentences I sent you last night on Onondaga and Doyle were sufficient for the board meeting today.

Regards,

Ben

I'd like to get on your calendar in the next couple of days to discuss a couple of items. Are you OK with me scheduling something with Tammy? I'll only need 45 minutes or so.

Per your request, I will start providing a daily status report on the Wind PPA MTM value.  As of the close of Thurs. 9/13, the PPA value was approx. $24.0 MM (after reserves).  When I receive the $100MM guaranty cost I will start incorporating this into a net calculation for an Enron Corp. view of the value.

Attached is a short summary of the permit question prepared by Dave Kellermeyer.  While there is always some risk in the permitting process, it is highly probable that this will be treated as a minor modification of the existing permit.

Louise:

I unfortunately was not able to attend your meeting this morning as I was interviewing analyst candidates, however the overall reaction from the group seems to be positive and I applaud you for your efforts in setting the tone.

I realize the company is in an interesting position with respect to liquidity and therefore I felt compelled to pass this thought by you with respect to a potential avenue power origination could pursue to assist with the current situation.  Since most of our activities seem to require some amount of capital, I was wondering whether you felt a viable strategy would be to turn Carl Tricoli's prepay concept for IPP's on its head and reverse the transaction with one or more counterparties where we pick up the upfront premium and deliver power in the future.  Assuming we can find the right counterparties, then we in essence would achieve a short position (which seems to be more in line with your strategic thoughts) and pick up liquidity in the short run.

Regards,

Charlie

This is the DASH that will be coming around. I spoke with Lisa Bills and learned that the 26 day period needed for bank review and approval will begin on Friday of next week.  While I am a bit disappointed about the small delay, I am not sure that there is much that I can do.

Regards,

Stuart

FYI, Wind is asking for changes to our PPA that we do not want.  AEP is putting the pressure on them for these changes.

We are not interested in these changes to the PPA.  These changes will weaken the language in the contract for us (i.e. improve it for AEP that is probably why they are asking for the "clarifications").  I will be out next week on vacation so please address any further concerns in my absence to Kevin Presto.  Regards, - Mike

Subject:	Amendment to IM II PPA

Mike:  Attached is our proposed amendment to the Indian Mesa II PPA.  It deals with the banking clarification (section 4.04 amendments), grid curtailment clarification (section 5.02 amendments), guaranty clarifications requested by the lenders (section 5.05 and 9.03 amendments), and the  ERCOT amendment (section 3.04 amendments) that we have discussed.  Please note that the ERCOT restriction would permit international sales, such as to Mexico, but would otherwise restrict EPMI's sales of energy from the wind facility to other locations within ERCOT.  In the preparation of this draft, we used the same amendment that was previously sent to you by e-mail on 8/22/01.  That e-mail had a redline with it to show the changes to the banking provisions.  Please let us know whether this draft is acceptable or whether you have any questions or comments on the amendment.  Thanks

Regards

John

Subject:=09QF projects summary

All projects are owned in a TRS/FOE structure (Total Return Swap / Friend o=
f Enron) as a result of our continued ownership in Portland General.

The two current East project companies are Motown and Cornhusker.

Motown consists of two 50% interests and has TRS of about $56 million and i=
s on the balance sheet for about $2 million:

Michigan Power - 129 MW power plant fully contracted for power 20+ years an=
d 14 remaining years of fixed cost gas.  The PPA is deep in the money versu=
s cost to generate (even after the swapped gas in 2015).  Dynegy operates a=
nd is Managing General Partner ("MGP") and Operator.  Fair performance reco=
rd on both at best.  Michigan is currently entering into QF stranded cost f=
ilings and the time is near to propose a restructuring.  We have waited for=
 about 9 months as Doug Clifford (the origination on the purchase) had been=
 attempting to purchase Dynegy's interest (they have too high a book value =
and are accrual based).

The proposed restructuring will take the form of an upfront payment in retu=
rn for an option to provide power from the market.  This approach gives Con=
sumer's (a BBB credit) much needed cash at a time when they are significant=
ly underrecovering due to increased fuel costs and set fuel recovery rates.=
 Consumer's ( like many other utilities) has a hard time seeing their expos=
ure (purchased power cost certainty for the volume and term) and doesn't se=
e any regulatory filing complications with their current stranded cost fili=
ngs.

The amended PPA is a non-unit contingent power short which we fill long-ter=
m with a contract from the power desk.  The desk takes the obligation becau=
se Generation Investments provides a full backstop pricing through their ow=
nership of the plant and the swapped gas (we either float past the swapped =
gas or contract for differences those years with the gas desk).  The PPA an=
d desk contract are securitized in the capital markets for the term of the =
PPA at 1.05 DSCR and about 75 bps over Consumer's current corporate bonds. =
 The plant essentially becomes a $0 NPV machine and the power desk has sign=
ificant optionality to call from the market rather than the plant for 20+ y=
ears.  During the term of the swapped gas, when the plant isn't called by t=
he desk we can sell the gas into the market for a profit.

It is fairly easy to see the increased value.  The project is currently pro=
ject financed at about 1.5 DSCR for about 14 years (lots of cash).  The des=
k has significant optionality and always a matched cost supply with the pla=
nt.  The plant gains efficiency due to revised O&M, insurance, reserves, et=
c. which are no longer required due to the removal of project financing.

Difficulties - Dynegy and Consumers.  Consumers can be rational.  Dynegy ei=
ther must sell or play along.  Current operational/project management issue=
s which Dynegy caused may make their interest available.

Ada - 29 MW plant fully contracted for power 20+ years.  Enron is the MGP. =
 GE operates for us.  50% owned by ConEd.  Fixed gas through 2008.  We woul=
d propose a restructuring at the same time as Michigan Power (this would le=
ave Consumers with only one unrestructured PPA).  Currently revisiting buyi=
ng ComEd's interest.

Cornhusker -  TRS of about $206 and about $24 on balance sheet.  A 100% int=
erest in a single 250 MW plant in Texas.  Small Coop which is very litigiou=
s.  Plant has had some rather spectacular failures (I have pictures which m=
ake the engineers on our floor shudder which I would be glad to pass along)=
 but the PPA only requires 60% availability before significantly in the mon=
ey capacity payments are reduced (essentially an impossible to reach loss).=
  The failures have been equipmentmanufacturer related (Westinghouse 501F).=
  Carl Tricoli spent the first 7 months (upto February) trying to sell the =
project to the Coop.  We spent last month determining that the Coop will ne=
ver buy the project (they just don't have the $ and we are a very expensive=
 lender.  We're taking a last stab at a restructuring proposal in the comin=
g month and upon appraisal of the Coop's intentions, we'll potentially ente=
r the sell mode.  El Paso has indicated an interest in the project already =
as the ex-Citizen's employee's over there attempted to restructure some tim=
e ago.  If we sell the closing should be by 9/30/01.

Again, I apologize for the delay in getting you this info.  Call with quest=
ions.

Update---The deal probably won't be signed until Monday, there are some legal issues on the guarantees (nothing major its just a logistical issue regarding the availability of the attorneys).  I'll keep you posted.  Not to worry, its done, as far as I'm concerned.

We have a # of counterparties whom credit will allow daily trading and/or balance of month trading (with no forward trading).  It would be much more efficient for the trading organization and the counterparties to have functionality within EOL that allowed for better credit screening.   We have moved away from the broker markets, and the current screening mechanism forces us to trade in the broker market with credit limited counterparties.

I would like to get this changed ASAP, if possible.

Thanks.

Kevin 

As I mentioned to you, due to some recent success in obtaining additional security, we are extending credit to Edison Mission Marketing & Trading, Inc. to transact on the day ahead and balance of week markets only.  We will not be granting them execution rights on EOL due to the lack of controls/functionality for daily transactions.  EOL, unlike ICE, has tenor function set by months versus number of days.  As a result, in the case of Edison Mission, if we set EOL for one month, Edison would have access to balance of the month plus next month.  It seems to make this work for Edison and perhaps other potential counterparties, it would either require reengineering of the system or possibly coming up with dividing the products to incorporate daily transactions.  If you would like to discuss further, please call.

Tod

Just to be clear I am expecting Mike to let San Antonio know today that we are out at that price.  We are therefore assuming the AEP deal will for with our PPA still in place.

Per your request, I will start providing a daily status report on the Wind PPA MTM value.  As of the close of Thurs. 9/13, the PPA value was approx. $24.0 MM (after reserves).  When I receive the $100MM guaranty cost I will start incorporating this into a net calculation for an Enron Corp. view of the value.

Title: One Tight Winter Peak Remains

***********************************************************************

WESTERN ENERGY--WINTER DEMAND PEAKS NOT EXPECTED TO RESULT IN PRICE SPIKES OR RELIABILITY PROBLEMS

Building natural gas and power supplies are providing a cushion for the western 
energy markets for this winter. Although seasonal gas and power demand spikes 
will again push prices higher, this winter will not look like the winter of 
2000/01. Unlike during the record high gas and power prices and blackouts last 
year winter, reduced demand, increased gas storage levels, and new gas and 
power supplies will significantly temper prices and significantly reduce the 
risk of supply disruptions. 

*  A supply build of 300 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day in the Rockies and 
900 MMcf in western Canada is meeting with declining demand in the West

*  Fourth quarter power demand is expected to be 13 percent below levels last 
year, while over 5,000 megawatts of new supply has been added this year

*  Only severe cold weather, prolonged drought, or a supply disruption could 
produce a reliability problem this winter

He is a scrap-metal dealer from Australia who has set up an office in the EconoLodge hotel in Pittsburgh and wants to sell a $3.5 million turbine to Enron for $35 million in order to finance his acquisition of a steel plant in Ohio which produces a kind of steel which is not of interest to our steel group (the plant produces a type of steel used in crankshafts).

He doesn't have any money or other security.

All:

As some of you may be aware, we appear to be getting close to entering a transaction with NSTAR to serve its all-requirements power needs for its Residential and Commercial customer class Default Service obligations.  The deal would be for a term of 6 or 12 months commencing July 1, 2001.  NSTAR's service territory covers Boston and surrounds, as well as south-eastern Massachusetts.  This prospective deal is very similar in nature to the Standard Offer Service deals we have entered into with United Illuminating, NSTAR, and most recently, Central Maine Power.

Here is the status at this point:
NSTAR achieved various levels of signoff for the basic deal structure (both with regulators and internal senior management).  NSTAR has indicated that it has basically come down to price and they could potentially pull the trigger as early as Monday, but certainly within a couple of days at the most.
NSTAR has requested updated pricing by 10 AM Eastern on Monday 3/26 to be held firm through COB same day (contingent upon execution of definitive agreements by that time).  They are seeking pricing updates from competing suppliers so we are not exclusive at this point.
NSTAR/Enron have worked through our extensive markups on their proposed contract, and have compiled a list of outstanding contract issues. (Note: Marcus Nettelton has been leading our legal efforts on this deal, and can be reached at 5-8161 to discuss contract issues).   While the number of outstanding contract items are numerous at this point, my sense is that there are no real deal breakers on either their end or ours.  In fact, they have agreed to many of the open issues in our previous contract with them for Standard Offer Service, so they could potentially agree to our terms without much delay, thereby potentially making execution on Monday a possibility.

Attached is a draft DASH for this deal .  I request that you review it promptly with a goal to have each of your signoffs for this deal in principle by mid-afternoon on Monday so as to enable us to transact on Monday if necessary.  The parameters that are still in motion are:  (1) price (again to e updated Monday morning), but will maintain same NPV value; (2) term (they may end up just going for 6 months); and (3) exact volume they source from us.  As for volume, they indicated they may want to go with us for something less than 100% of their requirements for the first 6 months (they estimate anywhere between 50-100%), and then potentially a smaller percentage for the second 6 months if they do end up doing a 12-month deal.  

Please feel free to call me (978-449-9936 office, 978-448-9260 home over the weekend) if you would like to discuss in more detail.   Berney Aucoin in Structuring will be on point to run internal traps on Monday as may be necessary.  Thanks in advance.

Regards
John

Louise,

I just received this confirmation that the (3) auxiliary boilers needed to provide the additional 600 kpph of steam to ConEd at Brooklyn Navy Yard should fit easily on the leased space adjacent to the existing water treatment building for the cogen plant. his is based on auxiliary boiler footprints just received from Babcock & Wilcox, an aux boiler OEM.

The attached layout shows the footprint of the boilers overlayed next to the water treatment building in the parking lot currently under lease by the partnership. It also shows the approximate 25% of space currently being used by others at the opposite end of the parking lot that is assumed not available for additional expansion.

The layout is as accurate as we can make it scaling the drawings available without an actual survey. However, it appears there is plenty of room available to add this equipment.

To all:

Attached below please find the draft agreement and term sheet between ENA and AIG/Highstar regarding the purchase and sale of the North Carolina Power Holdings coal facilities (Alamac).  The term sheet outlines 1) the asset sale, 2) the short-term call option agreement with CP&L, 3) a short-term financial put option between EPMI and AIG, 4) the asset management services agreement, 5) the agency or "brokerage" agreement whereby Enron acts on AIG's behalf to resell the plants to a third party, and 6) an agreement to offer AIG a financial hedge for 2002 or a long-term power purchase agreeement in the future if the plants are not sold as expected.

I have sent these drafts to AIG and expect to finalize them next week.

Regards,

Heather

Subject: POWER: Edison Mission Energy Lines Up $750 Mln Loan to
Refinance Debt


2001-07-26 15:30 (New York)


     Rosemead, California, July 26 (Bloomberg) -- Edison Mission
Energy, a subsidiary of Edison International, is lining up a $750
million loan to help refinance $1.25 billion of maturing bank
debt, according to people close to the company.
     Credit Suisse First Boston is leading the transaction, which
will be held by a small number of banks, those familiar with the
loan said.
     The generating company is a separate legal entity from Edison
and its insolvent utility subsidiary, Southern California Edison.
A holding company that owns all of Edison Mission's stock was set
up earlier this year to protect the company's assets in case the
utility ends up in bankruptcy.
     ``It would be harder to get any financing done at any of the
Edison subsidiaries after a bankruptcy filing'' by Southern
California Edison, said Jon Kyle Cartwright, a senior energy
credit analyst at Raymond James & Associates, Inc. in St.
Petersburg, Florida.
     Edison Mission borrowed from its three bank lines and has to
repay bank debt of $250 million by mid-August. The new loan will
replace the $1 billion of bank credit lines that the company has
to repay by Oct. 10, the people said.
     ``Getting this financing done is probably one of the reasons
that SoCalEd hasn't filed'' for bankruptcy protection, Cartwright
said.

                      Negotiating a Solution

     Southern California Edison ran up more than $5.4 billion in
debts to pay for soaring wholesale power costs last year. The
state's power deregulation laws prohibited the company from
passing on those costs in the form of higher consumer rates.
     In an effort to conserve cash, the utility defaulted on more
than $930 million of notes and commercial paper in January. The
utility also owes energy providers more than $1 billion. Any three
unsecured creditors can file a petition to put the utility into
involuntary bankruptcy.
     Ted Craver, chief financial officer at Edison, said that the
company believes that bankruptcy isn't an answer to the
``political/regulatory problem'' that put the utility into this
position. ``We continue to seek a negotiated solution to restore''
the utility's creditworthiness, Craver said on a conference call
with investors holding the defaulted debt.
     While Southern California Edison is junk-rated, Edison
Mission Energy has the lowest investment grade credit ratings --
``BBB-'' from Standard & Poor's and ``Baa3'' from Moody's
Investors Service.

                        Investment Grade

     Edison Mission sold $600 million of 10-year notes in April,
which are trading between 96 and 97 cents on the dollar, up from
between 92.5 and 95 cents on the dollar at the end of June.
     Moody's based the company's investment grade ratings on the
fact that it has enough cash flow to cover its debts and that its
assets ought to be protected in case Southern California Edison
either files for bankruptcy protection or is pushed into it.
     The new loans are split between 364-day and three-year
maturities, bankers familiar with the deal said.
     ``These are lottery tickets, not investments,'' said
Cartwright. Those who buy them are ``investing on optimism, not on
arithmetic, and that isn't a good investment strategy.''
     The bankruptcy remote structure, which PG&E Corp., the parent
of bankrupt Pacific Gas & Electric Co., also put in place to
protect its generating subsidiary's assets, hasn't been tested in
court yet, analysts said.

	Guy,

	Your intent for the conference calls was right. We need to have a dialog with these parties like we do with the rest of our structured suppliers. But it must be a coordinated effort. There was no need to cancel the calls. Please coordinate to reestablish the conference calls with these contacts and for any others you may have, please contact  the following people as they are directly responsible for customer coverage and structured supply in their respective regions. We appreciate your efforts and like ComEd and AEP, I am sure we will continue to work closely.

Working on 3 deals  - a full services RFP with CVEC, service offering for Cogentrix (would be more imp. now that we're not doing any asset deals with them), and a "blend and extend" for 600-800MW of load. Cogentrix and CVEC are slated for this year, while the last one is for '02. Trying to give them a push for this year though.

Subject: BNYCP Litigation Analysis:PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL


Attached are the memoranda prepared by outside counsel assessing the BNYCP litigation.  To avoid as much confusion as possible, I suggest reading the Andrews & Kurth memo first, the Bernstein memo second and the risk matrix last.
In a nutshell, all agree that this is a very fact intensive case and that there has been little factual discovery to date.  It is also agreed that we have been denied the benefit of some of the evidence available as a result of the confidentiality obligations in place. Accordingly, much of the analysis provided is really counsel's "best guess" based on the information available. 
That being said, there seems to be a general agreement that, based on the facts currently available and the "quick and dirty" analysis that we have been able to do, the exposure ranges from approximately $20 to $50 million. Interest and attorney fees could also prove significant. 
I am available to discuss this further if you think that would be helpful.  Thanks for your patience.

UPDATE 4-Dynegy hits upper end of Q3 earnings targets.

10/15/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

HOUSTON, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Natural gas and power marketer and trader Dynegy
Inc. said on Monday that third-quarter net earnings rose 62 percent, as its
backbone wholesale energy business nearly doubled its returns.

The Houston-based company said earnings rose to $286 million, or 85 cents per
diluted share, from $177 million, or 55 cents per diluted share, for the same
period of 2000.
Companywide operating revenues rose to $8.51 billion in the third quarter of
2001, versus $8.36 billion in the similar year-ago period.

Analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call expected earnings in a range
of 77 cents to 85 cents a share, with a mean estimate of 82 cents.

Dynegy also said it raised its earnings estimate for the 2001 year to a range
of $2.09 to $2.10 per diluted share from the $2.07 target set on Oct. 1. It
maintained a fourth-quarter forecast of 40 cents to 41 cents a share and a
2002 forecast of $2.50 to $2.60 share. All are in line with analysts'
estimates.

Chief Financial Officer Robert Doty said that the company was on track to
achieve 20 percent to 25 percent earnings growth next year.

"Our long-term strategy to focus on marketing and trading around physical
assets supports earnings sustainability," Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Chuck Watson said in a statement.

"I would say the company's ability to continuously post strong earnings growth
illustrates their ability to successfully navigate through wildly various
operating environments," UBS Warburg analyst Jay Yannello said. "This company
has rapidly emerged as the leading player in its field."

While stocks in its sector have been hammered sharply over the past six
months, Dynegy has been a better performer than similar companies. Dynegy's
stock this year has fallen some 15 percent, outperforming the Standard &
Poor's utilities index, which has lost 21 percent.

Despite the strong earnings growth, shares of Dynegy were down $1.02, or 2.34
percent, to $42.63 in Monday afternoon trading. Analysts cited rumors that the
California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) wants to renegotiate the power
purchase contracts that the California Department of Water Resources holds
with companies like Dynegy, Calpine Corp., Mirant Corp. and Williams Cos.
Inc..

A spokesman for the Department of Water Resources, however, said it doesn't
plan to renegotiate the deals.

"These companies renegotiate contracts all the time. The question is, do they
maintain value in the contracts or do they lose value in the contracts?" said
analyst Jeff Dietert of Simmons and Co. "And I think the assumption that the
market is making is that Dynegy and others would lose value in their
contracts."

Dynegy still has an accounts receivable balance of about $320 to $325 million
for power it produced for cash-challenged California utilities. "We're not out
of the woods yet," said President and Chief Operating Officer Stephen
Bergstrom on a conference call.

But he noted there could be some resolution by the second or third quarter of
next year. After all, PG&E Corp.'s Pacific and Gas Electric utility sought
bankruptcy in April and filed a reorganization plan on Sept. 20. Edison
International's Southern California Edison utility plans to pay off its
creditors by March, under a settlement it reached with the CPUC.

WHOLESALE INCOME NEARLY DOUBLES

Dynegy Marketing and Trade, the company's main wholesale business, reported an
85 percent year-over-year increase in recurring net income, taking in $263
million this year compared with $142 million in the comparable quarter in
2000.

Among other things, Dynegy trades wholesale natural gas, power, coal, emission
allowances and weather derivatives.

The company attributed part of its improved performance this quarter to better
results in European and Canadian operations, including increased gas marketing
in Canada.

North American natural gas volumes grew 12 percent to 11.0 billion cubic feet
per day (Bcf/d) in the quarter, rising from 9.8 Bcf/d in the year-earlier
period. Total physical power sales increased 86 percent to 90.5 million
megawatt hours (MWh) in the 2001 third quarter, compared with 48.7 million MWh
in the same quarter a year ago.

Dynegydirect, the company's online trading platform for more than 750 products
and services, recorded nearly $10 billion in transactions in the third
quarter, the company said. Since its birth in November 2000, Dynegydirect has
recorded $33 billion in transactions.

Dynegy recently expanded the platform, its answer to hometown rival Enron
Corp.'s wildly successful EnronOnline trading platform, into British energy
markets.

One nominally lower performer this year was Illinois Power, Dynegy's regulated
transmission and distribution subsidiary. It reported recurring net income of
$26 million versus $27 million a year earlier. Dynegy attributed the smaller
figure to a reduced industrial load.

The company's new communications segment took a $15 million loss for the
quarter, mostly from costs associated with developing its 16,000-mile network.
The network reaches 44 U.S. cities and is expected to be completed in the
fourth quarter.

Dynegy expects that segment to record a fourth-quarter loss of nil to 3 cents
a share and a full-year loss of 13 cents to 16 cents a share. For 2002, the
company expects the unit to be at breakeven by the end of the year.

	Subject:	FW: Onondaga

	Louise / Dave:

	We have been talking to accounting over the past several days regarding Onondaga as I mentioned in our meeting yesterday. For whatever reason, our interest in Onondaga (through the Cash Flow Interest Agreement) is viewed by accounting as a receivable. From a commercial standpoint, this is incorrect, but at the end of the day, it doesn't really matter. Billy's e-mail below basically states that because of how the Onondaga interest has been classified, we should reduce the $7.9 million by the $1.1 million payment received last week, but then readjust the value of the asset.

	Based on our internal valuation, and based on the written indication we received this week from a prospective purchaser, adjusting the value of the "receivable" to $10 million (after application of the $1.1 million payment received) would be very conservative. This would net a gain of $3.1 million for Q3.

	With your concurrence, I will work with Billy to support the adjustment of Onondaga to $10 million (and therefore the gain of $3.1 million). I will advise him to credit the gain to my profit center unless you tell me otherwise.

	Please let me know if you have any questions.

	Regards,

	Ben

	Ben,

	Based upon the review of the Cashflow Interest Agreement, Partnership Agreement and numerous discussions with internal accountants we have determined that it is inappropriate to recognize the cash payment received as income.  The basis that is carried on our books currently (approx. $7.9 mm) represents a long-term receivable that resulted from the tracking account arrangement under the original gas supply agreement between ENA and OCLP.  In addition, This asset does not qualify for the MTM or Fair Value accounting models.  The payment received from OCLP based on the Cashflow Interest Agreement should reduce the long term receivable that is currently recorded on our books.

	However,  it is also our understanding that in the prior year a management decision was made to reduce/write-off  $8 million of this long-term receivable based upon the best information available at the time.  As stated below our internal sales efforts now support the conclusion that the prior year write down was more than it should have been.  This would suggest that we need to effectively adjust the write down of the asset to reflect what we truly believe is collectible.  This will be considered a change in accounting estimate will flow through the current quarter earnings if management makes the decision that this asset was incorrectly written down in the prior year.  This basically gets you the the same accounting treatment as MTM.

	A few things need to be noted:

	1) Support will need to be provided that substantially supports the adjustment of our valuation of this asset. Please provide this to me 

	2) You will have to resolve the geography of the income that results from the increase in the asset.  Supposedly Corp took the write down....may cause problems.

	3) Somebody will have to accept responsibility for the valuation exposure that this will create.  It is my understanding that RAC and Credit are not involved.

	4) We need to be able to explain what basis we used in determining the write down in prior year.  We will probably get questioned by AA.

	Please call me if you would like to discuss.


	Regards,

	Billy

		Please book the payment received from Onondaga as Q3 income. In this morning's meeting with Louise, I have advised her that our internal valuation and sales efforts support this payment being taken as income.

		Please advise as I need to update her tomorrow.

No action needed on your part, but just in case you hear something through the grapevine, here is current situation:

Summary

- AEP/CP&L have economic interests in the Brownsville area which are best served if we do not locate our tie in Brownsville Public Utility Board's (BPUB's) service territory and BPUB does not obtain the  system upgrades which would be justified by our tie.
- AEP is trying to stall our Presidential Permit Application and to coerce us into moving the tie onto their system.
- BPUB sees this as an attack on their interests and is planning to challenge AEP.
- 5 MOU's have been signed with customers and discussions are continuing with 12 others, who have all been met and have expressed interest.
- We are optimistic that the PP will be issued and standard Ercot treatments will prevail, but we will likely be delayed to sometime early next year.


History

- Enron filed Presidential Permit (PP) Application
- CP&L (owned by AEP) intervened against the application and raised some technical issues
- DOE asked Enron and CP&L/AEP to meet and resolve issues
- Meeting occurred between Enron and CP&L/AEP. General technical solutions were identified, with specific solutions to be determined through a SPS study.
- Enron drafted a letter outlining the points covered in our meeting with CP&L/AEP, intending to have the letter signed by both of us and forwarded to DOE, requesting that DOE proceed with issuing the PP.
- AP&L/AEP refused to sign the letter and are now arguing that an SPS scheme is not sufficient for the proposed tie location (although AEP operates under SPS elsewhere within Ercot, they argue that ours is a special case. Independent opinion (and our own) is that there is little merit to the CP&L/AEP position).
- AEP have told us that if we move the tie to a location West of Brownsville (on AEP's proposed line expansion), that they would drop all opposition.
- AEP/CP&L have since approached the Ercot Board arguing that cost studies should be done on alternate tie locations and the system cost impact thereof.
- AEP/CP&L have submitted to the Ercot Board that Enron should be responsible for any costs associated building the tie at anything other than the least-cost (system perspective) location.

Current Status
- Brownsville (BPUB) are incensed at AEP/CP&L's behaviour and are planning the following actions:
	- Making submission to Ercot that:
		-  BPUB informed Ercot of the project 14 months ago and no further studies or committee reviews by Ercot should be necessary.
		- No changes to current Ercot procedures should be contemplated and the tie should be viewed as a firm, native BPUB load 
	- BPUB lawyer is drafting letter to go to AEP demanding that AEP honor their previous agreement with BPUB to be supportive of BPUB projects.
	- BPUB CEO, engineer and lawyer will visit PUC-T next week to make the case that no special arrangements should be made with regard to Enron or BPUB 	needing to pick up additional system costs
- At this point, BPUB is highly motivated and is striking out with an aggressive representation of their position as there are implications for them which go beyond the current project. Furthermore, there is little love lost between BPUB and AEP.
- Although moving to the AEP-proposed location would remove AEP as an obstacle, we would lose the work done to date preparing with BPUB and would probably make an enemy of BPUB.
- Bob Franks (regulatory), Scott Laidlaw (engineering/technical) and myself are coordinating with Bracewell Patterson (regulatory advisors) on Enron's strategy and level of support for BPUB.

They are supposed to be in the process of preparing pro-formas for us, since they hadn't done any real economic analysis before talking to us.  I put a call into Dana Litman, the Controller, who is pulling these numbers together, but have not yet heard from him.  I'll let you know the status as soon as I hear from Dana.

It is my recollection that EGM Coal changed the contract from take-or-pay fixed volumes, fixed price to an all-requirements, as-needed contract in order to mark the deal.  It was everyone's understanding that this contract was going to be sold, which it has been.  We no longer have any control or influence over this contract.

Ozzie and Heather,

In February time frame EGM Coal desk sold firm delivered coal to NC Power Holdings balance of year (2001) for $72/ton.  We also did a requirements deal beyond this point.  My understanding was Ozzie made the balance of the year trade per Kevin Presto.  Ozzie also verified this understanding in a phone conversation with me a couple of weeks back.  NC Power Holdings is currently not taking any coal on there take or pay obligation.  

There is liquidated damages associated with this transaction which need to be settled.  It will also be prudent to determine if the remaining tonnage obligation for balance of the year needs to be settled now or in the future.

Please let me know who is specifically responsible to settle this trade.

KJM

Thanks.  It was painful, but we got through it.

The contract says 5 business days after satisfying the CPs, that would be next Monday.  One problem though, AIG needs 10 business days to notify the investors and receive the funds to complete the sale.  I've got a call into them to see how we solve the inconsistency.

Firstly, congratulations on Alamac.  Not an easy job and you got there in the end.

A quick question, why are we not closing it this week?  Under the contract shouldn't we close on Friday?

Thanks

Louise,

It is possible that ABB will raise the subject of our option with them for the construction of the HVDC tie while in our meeting tomorrow.

As you know, we paid a considerable sum in the past for this option, which effectively expires at the end of November.

Under current market conditions, I think it will be possible to pay a much lower sum - and in fact, I think we can apply this sum against the ABB contracted project cost in the event we proceed. 

No decisions are needed on this tomorrow, and it might not even come up - but clearly, we've kept these guys hanging on the line for some time now and I expect that realistically we will not be in a position to give them a Notice to Proceed until middle of next year, given contracting and Presidential Permit issues.

Louise,

I have looked at this opportunity and am of the opinion that the expense of $7 million will not provide cost effective advertising or dealmaking benefits for Origination particularly or EWS generally.

I will advise M3 Management (the marketing consultant for Team Rahal) that we will not be participating.

Sorry, I was off the desk and did not read this message earlier.  We did price this put up - it comes out on our offer side in the $6 - $7 range. The best offer we'd make would be $6.  I think Rob gave this number to Rogers earlier this afternoon and hopefully it got to you.

I have just been informed that our P&L was overstated by approx $6 million on Friday.   Since it is quarter end, we are re-calcing to avoid numerous audit issues that would result.   The mistake was due to vol curves rolling forward one month (May became June, June became July, July became Aug, etc.).

Starting tommorow, Harry will be responsible for marking all vol curves for East Power.   The vol curve changes that Harry will be making over the next two days will result in a marginal gain in desk P&L (1-2 million).   Most of the regional books gain value due to short vol position, however, the New Albany spread option loses a corresponding amount.

The recent risk group difficulties are compounded by the Portland risk group being down to 2 people (total experience of 3 months) and many of our resources are getting sucked into West issues.   Continued system difficulties combined with understaffing has resulted in more frequent mistakes.

The $23 million of P&L for Friday business can be reconciled as follows:
$6 million from Thursday mistake (P&L understated on Thursday because Wednesday curves were used after Port Calc failed)
$10 million in "true" Friday P&L (summer 01, Cal 02 & Cal 03 all down approx. $1/Mwh)
$6 million overstated due to vol curve being off by one month from incorrect roll in vol curves.

The final P&L issued by 2:00 pm today (for COB Friday) will be approx. $17 million.

Subject:	ECP/Linden Swaps

Here's my understanding of what has happened with the interest rate swaps:

As I indicated earlier, the original $32mm was put on for the Linden 6 expansion which never occurred.
The second swap of $350mm was put on to protect the value of the cash flow from El Paso assuming we would monetize the asset shortly. This hedge does appear to have been set with the El Paso payment stream in mind.
The original $32mm of swaps DID NOT provide a clean hedge to the remaining El Paso cash flows as they were 10 year bullets while the El Paso payment stream is a 7 year monthly amortizer.
However, the $382mm of hedges did approximate notionally the asset to be hedged.

It appears that given the assumption the swaps were to have been monetized in a short period of time, a decision may have been made that unwinding and rewinding the "dirty" interest rate hedge was more expensive than wearing the basis risk for a brief time.
Given that the monetization never occurred, it does appear to me that the $32mm hedge is ineffective and should be removed or replaced if we determine that we should hedge the rate risk associated with the note.

Anyone have anything additional to add? That's the best I could turn up looking back after the fact given the many personnel departures.

Louise:

The base model was too large to send via e-mail, so I placed it into the common directory located at o:\_Dropbox\Dodger.  The file name is CASH_BrooklynNavyYard_070601,v4.  If you need help pulling it out of the dropbox, give me a call and I will walk upstairs to bring it up.

I also included the model output from Power Commodity Structuring's analysis of the transaction upsides.  Attached is a draft of the DASH (please note RAC has not officially signed off).  Please let me know if you would like to see anything else.

Thanks-
Bill

Yes. I've attached the most recent map, and can provide you with our list of each option if you like. This list includes all relevant terms of our site options, but as such is very detailed. Let me know if you want a copy.

Thanks,

Ben

Louise:

I do not have the names from Bob Virgo's area that will be in attendance, but the following should encompass everyone else that I am currently aware of:

	Stuart Zisman	-	Asset Marketing
	Sonya Gasdia	-	RAC
	Rick Bittner	-	RAC
	Bob Frank	-	Regulatory
	Kim Melodick	-	HR
	Ying Liu		-	Finance
	Dan Castagnola -	Finance
	Jeff Blumenthal	-	Tax
	Nancy Corbet	-	Legal
	Rick Whitaker	-	East Power
	Charlie Vetters	-	East Power
	John Lang	-	East Power
	Victor Munoz	-	East Power
	Dave Duran	-	East Power

I imagine a couple of people will go from Virgo's team for a grand total of sixteen.

I understand this group represents a large commitment of time and resources prior to making the business case to you on anything other than a superficial basis.  I am trying to position us so that by the end of next week we should be able to determine if a commercial fatal flaw exists while still keeping us in the game if we like what we see especially given the tight time frame associated with the final bid (end of the first week of November).

If you have any additional questions or concerns, please call me at your earliest convenience.

This will be a frequent report until we get all the quotes up and running.  In most cases, the missing quotes were quickly available through a direct phone call.  I left a mesage with Presto, and he responded via message last night saying he would investigate the Ercot, but that Fletch was overwhelmed on the Cin and Comed.  He would talk to the NY team and discuss the reasonableness of the deliverables.  He came to the conclusion that they definately need more traders across the board to keep the backs and offpeaks fresh, but they do not have them now.  I will continue to monitor the progress.

Good Morning,

Attached, please find the latest issue of our Independent Power Weekly.

 <<IPW061801.pdf>>

Summary:
1. IPPs Fall 5.1%   Last week our IPP composite fell 5.1%, outperforming the
NASDAQ (-8.1%), but lagging behind the S&P 500 (-4.0%).  AES Corp. was the
strongest performer in the group, rising 3.8%.  NRG Energy was the weakest
performer, falling 11%.

2. Investors Focus on Today's FERC Meeting   Putting pressure on stock
prices, investors expressed concern regarding the FERC's special upcoming
meeting, scheduled for today (6/18).  At today's meeting the commission is
expected to extend the scope of its previous April 25 California market
mitigation order.  In particular, we expect FERC to: 1) Extend floating
power price caps to all hours; and, 2. Extend floating caps to other western
states.

3. Minimal Impact on IPPs   We believe the expansion of the FERC's current
market mitigation plan will have an immaterial impact on the Independent
Power Producers with California exposure-AES, CPN, MIR, NRG, and RRI.  Our
reasons are as follows: 1) The bulk of their capacity is sold forward; 2.
The FERC's methodology is benign; and, 3) Valuations already reflect
political uncertainty and normalized power prices.

4. NRG Hosts Conference Call On Friday (6/15), NRG hosted a conference call
to address investor concerns surrounding near-term equity needs, pending
acquisitions and recent regulatory developments.  On the call management
noted that: 1) Barring a major acquisition, it will not issue equity in the
near-term; 2) NRG's pending acquisition of 1,767 MW of generation capacity
from Conectiv should close by June 30; and, 3) Expansion of the FERC's
Western market mitigation measures should not impact NRG's performance.
Also on the call, management reaffirmed its previous 2001 EPS guidance of
$1.35. .  Trading at 13.2 times our 2002 estimate versus a group average of
16.1 times, NRG represents the best relative value in the IPP group.  We
believe this discount is unwarranted and reiterate our Buy rating and $37
price target.

5. Review of ORN Analyst Conference   On Tuesday (6/12), Orion Power hosted
its first major investor conference in Baltimore, Maryland.  The meeting
featured presentations from 10 senior managers.  We do not believe investors
were previously aware of the full breadth and depth of the management team.
While no major announcements were made, the meeting served to confirm that
ORN is on track to achieve its strategic and growth objectives.

6. Coverage of GEG Initiated with a Buy Rating   On June 11, 2001 CSFB
initiated on Global Power Equipment Group (GEG) with a Buy rating and a
twelve-month price target of $42.  We co-cover GEG with John McGinty--CSFB's
machinery analyst.

Regards,

Neil Stein   212/325-4217

Kevin,
We are working on a way to trick the system into getting it done. Otherwise, restructuring the way credit is done requires a major back-end rewrite. Given that we can only do so much at any one time and the amount of resources we are pouring into restrucuturing limit orders, I can't promise this any time soon unless we can do it within the existing framework. I will keep you posted.

Andy

We have a # of counterparties whom credit will allow daily trading and/or balance of month trading (with no forward trading).  It would be much more efficient for the trading organization and the counterparties to have functionality within EOL that allowed for better credit screening.   We have moved away from the broker markets, and the current screening mechanism forces us to trade in the broker market with credit limited counterparties.

I would like to get this changed ASAP, if possible.

Thanks.

Kevin 

As I mentioned to you, due to some recent success in obtaining additional security, we are extending credit to Edison Mission Marketing & Trading, Inc. to transact on the day ahead and balance of week markets only.  We will not be granting them execution rights on EOL due to the lack of controls/functionality for daily transactions.  EOL, unlike ICE, has tenor function set by months versus number of days.  As a result, in the case of Edison Mission, if we set EOL for one month, Edison would have access to balance of the month plus next month.  It seems to make this work for Edison and perhaps other potential counterparties, it would either require reengineering of the system or possibly coming up with dividing the products to incorporate daily transactions.  If you would like to discuss further, please call.

Ed

As most of you know, NRG's proposed purchase of two coal plants in Conneticut (UI's territory) was recently cancelled due to regulatory issues at FERC.   The purchase and sale transaction between Wisvest and NRG was originally entered into almost two years ago.   The proposed purchase price of $350 million for 1000 MW of coal was a "bargain price" at the time due to environmental risks that are specific to the state of CT.
 
Over the past 2-3 years, the State of Conneticut has threatened to have these coal plants shut down due to pollution issues and Wisvest was concerned enough about this risk that they "puked" the plants to NRG for $350/kW in early 2000.   At a minimum, it is expected that $100-150/kW of SCR and/or scrubbers will be required at these facilities to appease the CT regulatory bodies.
 
My strong view is that, as a practical matter, the plants cannot be shut down or the lights would go out in CT.   The area where the plants are located is quite possibly the most congested area in the entire Eastern Interconnect.   The load pocket is significantly short MW and transmission import capability is inadequate to serve the load in this area.   In a true "locational marginal price" environment, the prices would likely be similar to Zone J in New York   Currently, pricing in NEPOOL is generally socialized with congestion costs spread equally to all loads, regardless of who causes the congestion.   
 
In the recently proposed "single NE RTO" model, it is about 80% certain that the PJM "locational marginal price" market model will be implemented sometime between mid-2003 and mid-2004.   At that point in time, consumers in the congested areas of NEPOOL (in-city Boston and CT) will be exposed to higher energy prices, while consumers in Maine, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island should see lower prices.
 
Given the facts above, coupled with traditional asset companies too long to show good bids for incremental assets, I think EWS should pursue discussions with Wisvest immediately and attempt to buy these coal plants at what could be extremely favorable economics relative to our forward curve in NEPOOL and our bullish view for relative pricing at the asset "node".   
 
If we could buy these plants for approx $250/kW with $150/kW of environmental upgrades, the resulting "all-in" (depr, fixed & variable O&M, fuel costs, NOx, SO2, capital reserve, interest) 7x24 plant cost would be approx. $34-36/Mwh.    This is lower than our energy only socialized NEPOOL curve.   Additional upside is derived from positive basis, ICAP, ancillary services, emissions allowances, and long term requirements sales to LSE's.
 
Lavo and Louise - This could be the "Alberta PPA" for 2002.   Lots of "hair" but lots of upside.
 
Any thoughts?

SSB Electrical Equipment Analyst Power Supply/Demand Outlook

*	Jeff Sprague, SSB's Electrical Equipment analyst, has an interesting
perspective on the supply/demand balance for power.  His forecast is based
on GE's order book for turbines, which we think is an excellent source of
info.
*	Jeff points out that no orders have been canceled so far.
*	Although there are slight differences in our estimations of new
plant builds (his is higher) and reserve margin (his is higher), we think
this info. supports our view.  On the margin, new plant builds exceed
demand, and reduce the tightness in the market, as measured by reserve
margins.  We think there will be downward pressure on power prices and spark
spreads in this environment.

I've also attached Jeff's comments below, which he sent to his clients,
vis-a-vis the Electrical Equipment sector and GE in particular, as well as
our recent PC6 report, for reference.  Any questions, please call. - Ray

 <<PC6final.pdf>>  <<Sprague--Supply&Demand--client.xls>>

Jeff's Sprague's (212-816-6699) comments:

GE stock has been weak in recent days as concerns about lower power prices
have hurt utility stocks and raised the fear that power capacity is being
overbuilt.

Ultimately enough capacity will be deployed in the US, but we do not believe
we are there yet.  Based on our analysis of GE's delivery plans, the US will
reach a 14% reserve margin (based on capability at summer peak load) in
2002.

We do not expect the industry to ever return to the 20%+ reserve margins of
yesteryear, but 14% seems far from excessive given the very severe
shortcomings of the electrical grid (see our 6/4 report on the grid).

If GE's output in '03 is flat with '02, reserve margins would rise to a
still reasonable 16%.  GE has filled 90-95% of its backlog for 2003 and has
experienced no cancellations or push-outs in orders to date.

The bottom line is we believe the sell-off in GE is overdone.  We will
publish a more detailed report on the supply demand equation in the U.S.
power market in the coming days.  Please see the attached spreadsheet for a
more detailed analysis.

Louise and Dave:

We should monitor this transaction this week.

This week, more than $3 billion of sales have been slated. The largest comes from independent power producer Calpine Corp. (NYSE:CPN </quickchart/quickchart.asp?symb=CPN>). It plans to sell $1.35 billion of bonds as part of a $2 billion financing drive after Moody's Investors Service last week upgraded its debt to investment-grade.
I would think it would give us some indication whether the credit markets are there or not.

Williams will have weather model and research material several minutes before the general market.   Universities receive the data before the market and this alliance will get the weather data to Williams as if they were part of the university.

Any thoughts?

Williams Signs $10 Million Weather and Climate Research Alliance with the University of Oklahoma
August 27, 2001 09:02:00 AM ET
Increased Accuracy of Weather Prediction Technology 
Provides Significant Economic Advantages for Energy Industry Leader 
TULSA, Okla., Aug. 27 /PRNewswire/ -- A unit of Williams WMB </inc/news/quoteredir.asp?symbol=us:WMB> today announced a $10 million strategic alliance with the University of Oklahoma (OU) to enhance weather and climate research, technology development, and undergraduate and graduate meteorology education. 
This commercial arrangement, the largest of its kind in the U.S. between a private corporation and a university meteorology program, is a mutually beneficial agreement that allows OU to expand its top-tier meteorology programs while Williams receives exclusive weather analysis and forecasting tools. This will give Williams a globally competitive advantage in energy marketing and trading, while related educational and research activities are expected to produce for Williams the nation's most qualified meteorologists and weather impact decision makers. 
"This is a partnership between business and higher education where both parties benefit," Keith E. Bailey, Williams chairman, president and CEO, said. "This alliance provides Williams access to weather research and technology that is dramatically superior than traditional government weather services and customized to Williams' unique needs. With weather being the number one driver of volatility in gas and power markets, we expect to see a significant return on our investment." 
"This history making agreement between Williams and the University of Oklahoma's School of Meteorology, a national leader in its field, is a dramatic demonstration of the power of a private sector-university partnership in the creation of economic productivity and growth, and the expansion of knowledge," said OU President David L. Boren. "I predict that this alliance will become a national model for joining together American international leadership in higher education with private sector creativity and vitality. We are deeply grateful for the confidence placed in this outstanding program at the University by Williams." 
Highlights of this expansive agreement include: 
    * Unique, advanced weather and climate prediction capabilities tailored by
      the University of Oklahoma's Weather Programs specifically for Williams'
      weather-sensitive businesses.
    * A grant of $8.1 million over five years to fund research in advanced
      weather analysis and prediction at the Center for Analysis and
      Prediction of Storms (CAPS).  This includes funding for a supercomputer
      that will be most powerful among all Big-12 institutions.
    * A grant of $1.6 million over five years to fund regional climate
      research at the Cooperative Institute for Mesoscale Meteorological
      Studies.  This money will bring to OU the most advanced climate system
      model in the world, and will fund research scientists as well as
      graduate and undergraduate students.
    * Gifts to create the Williams Endowed Chair, an advanced student computer
      laboratory, funding for three Williams Fellows in the Master of Science
      in Professional Meteorology Degree in the School of Meteorology and a
      gift to the Oklahoma Climatological Survey.
"We believe the outcome of this partnership will yield a world class suite of weather forecast and analysis products suited for use in the energy marketing and trading industry," says Denise Russell, director of Market Analysis at Williams' energy marketing and trading unit, who, in 1998 began to hire OU meteorology graduates. "We also will have a valuable pipeline for new technological and human resource capabilities with which to maintain these developments." 
According to Dr. John Snow, dean of the OU College of Geosciences and director of Oklahoma Weather Center programs, the School of Meteorology, has already begun to aggressively recruit some of the nation's top graduate students as part of the new partnership, and will expand this effort in the next several months now that the contracts are signed. 
"Through this alliance with Williams, The University of Oklahoma has obtained the resources necessary to continue generating new knowledge, defining the global standard for weather technology and developing outstanding graduates, all while bringing new jobs and opportunities to Oklahoma in weather-related fields," says Snow. 
The Williams/OU alliance was made possible through technology advances in computing resources and the enactment of Oklahoma State Questions 680 and 681, which provide for the establishment of commercial entities that are licensed for the exclusive right to commercialize the technology developed within research and development sections of universities.

I wanted each of you to know that the sale to AIG Highstar just closed.  We are in receipt of the wire from AIG (approx $27 million) and are in the process of sending the wires back out (approx $1 million).  Feel free to call with any questions.

I spoke to Mark Taylor, there is no legal restriction (eg any trademark issue)  on selling any turbines including putting all the names (ie specifically calling them GE 7FAs).  We did look at this once before but not with GE turbines.

Outstanding - on the exclusivity - he can have one if he pays for it.  Just like a turbine its an option price.  I suggest $2million for 3 weeks.

I think I have finally broken through the summer malaise in my colleagues here and gotten them fired up about Fort Pierce.  In a nutshell, we are very interested in moving forward on this deal.  I'm going to put together an LOI which I hope to have to you before the end of the week.  

One question - I know your senior management has a visceral dislike for any type of exclusivity, however my senior management is equally in love with the concept.  I'd like to try to massage something along the lines of our NCPH deal but we can discuss.  

How does the rest of your week look for getting on a call to go over some of this stuff?  My NCPH scars are fading, so I'm ready to re-engage!

I have been working with Lehman and BofA this morning in an attempt to get a letter by close of business today so as to be in front of the insurance wrappers this week.

Cornhusker on track.  Ultimate (or perhaps penultimate) meeting on transaction docs this afternoon.

Chuck

Subject: CSFB Independent Power Weekly-Issue #35


Good Morning,

Attached, please find the latest issue of our Independent Power Weekly.

 <<IPW071601.pdf>>  <<CSFB Power Generation Supply Chain Conference.pdf>> 
Summary:
1. IPPs Fall 1.9%   Last week our IPP composite fell 1.9%, underperforming
both the NASDAQ (+4.0%) and the S&P 500 (+2.1%).  Calpine was the strongest
performer in the group, rising 4.5%.  AES was the weakest performer, falling
9.5%.  

2. 4 Items to Focus On   In our view, there were four items worth focusing
on from last week: 1.) AES fell 10% owing to Latin American concerns.  We
see downside to our 2001 estimate; 2.) The FERC settlement conference
adjourned on July 9.  On July 12, the presiding ALJ issued a recommendation
favorable to generators; 3.) On July 12, the US bankruptcy court approved
Calpine's settlement with PG&E; and, 4.) On July 10, NRG Energy announced it
would acquire a 2,255 MW portfolio from Indeck.

3. Latin America Pressuring AES Earnings   The likelihood of downside to our
2001 EPS estimate for AES. Corp. of $1.89 has increased materially.  We
believe the ongoing currency weakness combined with power rationing have the
potential to negatively impact 2001 EPS by $0.25-$0.30 versus prior
expectations-on a stand-alone basis.  While management indicated in mid-May
that it could offset weakness in Brazil, the currency has materially
depreciated since that time and shows no signs of improvement in the
near-term.  AES's second quarter earnings conference call will take place on
July 26.  Following the call, we will adjust our 2001 estimate accordingly,
unless management indicates that it remains positioned to offset these items
through upside in other parts of its business.

4.  FERC ALJ Issues Report    On Thursday (7/12), Curtis Wagner, the
Administrative Law Judge who presided over the recent settlement conference,
issued a report presenting his findings and recommendations for next steps.
Overall, the report was very much consistent with our expectations.  While
Wagner notes that some refunds are due from the generators, he argues that
the $8.9 billion demanded by the State of California "cannot be
substantiated."   We believe Calpine and Mirant offer the greatest downside
protection from this issue.  

5. CSFB Power Generation Supply Chain Conference   On September 10 and 11,
CSFB will host a Power Generation Supply Chain Conference at the Plaza Hotel
in New York City.  This event is designed to provide investors with a
wholistic perspective on all aspects of the sector-from coal and natural gas
companies, to equipment and construction service providers, to the power
producers themselves.  Please contact us if you would like additional
information.

Regards,

Neil Stein   212/325-4217
Bryan Sifert   212/325-3906

I gather you heard about 6 to 7 for Cornhusker for this quarter.  About 4 in cash and about 2 in reval accretion.

East Coast s/b essentially flat.  Cash in and lower reval netting.

Any questions about these items and you can typically get the quickest estimate or actual from me.  We do need to discuss ECP debt today if you're available.

Louise,
I just spoke with Faith Killen and she enlightened me on exactly what you're looking for.  It is my understanding that you're not necessarily looking for hotlist information but more of a weekly deal update schedule which would identify deals being worked on and the status of each.  She also indicated that you were looking for this information to come directly from the commercial world and not accounting. 

Dave,
Gary Justice prepares a weekly deal schedule which includes a column for "Status/Follow-Up."  This schedule, if completely populated for each deal, should serve this purpose.  I will pass this information on to him.

Thanks, Paula.

Louise, we have discontinued any material work for AIG regarding their acquisition of TM Ventures. We will, however, advise them regarding the liquidation value of the 2 QF projects that they would be acquiring. This will not require any time or effort on our part and is compatible with the overall agreement with AIG. I do believe that the concept of creating a customer for Enron has the potential to create value for us and does not  create any incremental risk. Hope all is going well.

They are apparently not going to roll over.  

As you are well aware, we filed an arbitration against EPME under the swap agreement and El Paso Corp. under the guaranty. Our hope was that once the El Paso legal department got involved this would come to an amicable resolution. Not so fast.  While EPME recognizes that it is contractually obligated to arbitrate under the swap agreement, El Paso Corp. is claiming that it is not subject to arbitration and has filed a lawsuit asking a court to declare that El Paso Corp. is not subject to arbitration. 

We had a call with El Paso's lawyers early this morning to discuss where we are and where we are going. We told El Paso's lawyers that we will agree to drop El Paso Corp. from the arbitration if they agree to drop their lawsuit. (I have talked to Duran and Deffner about this and they have made it clear that our overriding objective is to monetize the swap agreement.  To do so, we need an arbitration panel's ruling on the confidentiality provision in the swap agreement.  The guaranty issue is, in their view, of secondary concern at this time). During the call, EPME asked for 10 days to name their party arbitrator.  We agreed. By the way, we have already appointed our party arbitrator.  El Paso's lawyers are going to check with their client today to confirm that the lawsuit will be dropped.

On the arbitration front, once EPME names its party arbitrator, the two party arbitrators will get together and select a neutral arbitrator.  We should expect that process to take about 30 days.  Then the entire arbitration panel will get together and set an arbitration schedule.

I will keep you updated.

Andy

Both John Llodra and Don Miller have had discussions with regard to pursuing these assets over the last week.  Essentially, these plants may be the first distress sales we see in the market place.
 
John/Don - can you let everyone know how you plan to move forward.

Subject: Conn. Coal Plants


As most of you know, NRG's proposed purchase of two coal plants in Conneticut (UI's territory) was recently cancelled due to regulatory issues at FERC.   The purchase and sale transaction between Wisvest and NRG was originally entered into almost two years ago.   The proposed purchase price of $350 million for 1000 MW of coal was a "bargain price" at the time due to environmental risks that are specific to the state of CT.
 
Over the past 2-3 years, the State of Conneticut has threatened to have these coal plants shut down due to pollution issues and Wisvest was concerned enough about this risk that they "puked" the plants to NRG for $350/kW in early 2000.   At a minimum, it is expected that $100-150/kW of SCR and/or scrubbers will be required at these facilities to appease the CT regulatory bodies.
 
My strong view is that, as a practical matter, the plants cannot be shut down or the lights would go out in CT.   The area where the plants are located is quite possibly the most congested area in the entire Eastern Interconnect.   The load pocket is significantly short MW and transmission import capability is inadequate to serve the load in this area.   In a true "locational marginal price" environment, the prices would likely be similar to Zone J in New York   Currently, pricing in NEPOOL is generally socialized with congestion costs spread equally to all loads, regardless of who causes the congestion.   
 
In the recently proposed "single NE RTO" model, it is about 80% certain that the PJM "locational marginal price" market model will be implemented sometime between mid-2003 and mid-2004.   At that point in time, consumers in the congested areas of NEPOOL (in-city Boston and CT) will be exposed to higher energy prices, while consumers in Maine, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island should see lower prices.
 
Given the facts above, coupled with traditional asset companies too long to show good bids for incremental assets, I think EWS should pursue discussions with Wisvest immediately and attempt to buy these coal plants at what could be extremely favorable economics relative to our forward curve in NEPOOL and our bullish view for relative pricing at the asset "node".   
 
If we could buy these plants for approx $250/kW with $150/kW of environmental upgrades, the resulting "all-in" (depr, fixed & variable O&M, fuel costs, NOx, SO2, capital reserve, interest) 7x24 plant cost would be approx. $34-36/Mwh.    This is lower than our energy only socialized NEPOOL curve.   Additional upside is derived from positive basis, ICAP, ancillary services, emissions allowances, and long term requirements sales to LSE's.
 
Lavo and Louise - This could be the "Alberta PPA" for 2002.   Lots of "hair" but lots of upside.
 
Any thoughts?

Louise:

Our proposal is for ENA to assume the nominal cost of the turbine as of Jan 1, '01, exclusive of carrying costs up to that date. From Jan 1 forward we will assume full responsibility for any carrying costs, and any continuing payment obligations under the purchase contract with Westinghouse.

The nominal cost of the turbine as of Jan 1, '01 exclusive of carrying costs, is $22,947,599. This is the amount that we propose ENA to assume with respect to the turbine. 

The carrying cost through Jan 1 to be assumed by CALME as part of this proposal is $2,055,330. This amount reflects the actual carrying charges imposed by Enron Corp on CALME based upon the payments made to Westinghouse under the purchase agreement.

The continuing payment obligation to be assumed by ENA under the purchase contract with Westinghouse is $1,558,401. This amount reflects the actual final payment due under the contract, which is due at commercial operations.

Please let me know if you need anything else to resolve this, or if you have any questions.

Regards,

Ben

Louise,
Here are some bullet points for the discussions tomorrow:
-East Power, including Generation Investments made about $50 million in the first half. The greatest contribution came from Ben Jacoby, about $15 million. By the way, I hired Ben along with Scott Healy to acquire sites in 1998.
-All of the traders and structuring, including Bernie Aucoin told me that John Llodra drove both the CMP and NStar deals. Total income $8.5 million.
-I believe Delainey was correct in saying that Ozzie was the brains behind Alamac but Heather did the execution. Total income for the East $7.5 million.
-Most of the rest of the deals were done after I came in.
-Mid market sales have increased.(700% over the first half of 2000)
-This group was in meltdown when I came in(at least on the origination side). I would like to get some credit for stopping the bleeding and starting the rebuilding process in a difficult environment.

Gentlemen,

Based on our phase 2 valuation analysis and detailed discussion with Dana Davis, we do not feel we can get to the numbers which we are told are being offered by competitors.  We are significantly short of the $45 to $55MM that the sellers indicated was shown in the first round.  Thus, it would be imprudent to incur the costs of on-site due diligence required to complete the process.

We still like the plant at the right price and if those other bids do not materialize we may reconsider if contacted by Arclight.  Thank you for your help during this process.

Best regards,

Pete

Good Morning,

Attached, please find the latest issue of our Independent Power Weekly.

 <<IPW062501a.pdf>>  <<ROIC_Under_FERC.xls>>

Summary:
1. IPPs Fall 10.4%   Last week our IPP composite fell 10.4%, underperforming
both the NASDAQ (+0.3%) and the S&P 500 (+0.9%).  International Power was
the strongest performer in the group, rising 1.7%.  Shaw Group was the
weakest performer, falling 18.1%.

2. Same Old Story--Politics   Last week's lackluster stock price performance
reflected lingering political and regulatory uncertainties.  These concerns
were heightened by the FERC's latest order issued on Monday (6/18), calling
for expanded price controls in the Western markets.  In addition, the
subject of retroactive refunds received renewed attention.

3 The Litmus Test: Impact on Forward Earnings, Returns and Growth Rates   In
our view, the market's litmus test for evaluating these stories must focus
on whether any event has taken place that negatively impacts forward
earnings, returns or growth rates for the sector.  Our analysis of recent
events points to an unchanged forward earnings profile for the sector.  On
that basis, we regard the recent stock price activity as irrational.

4. Significant ROIC Possible Under FERC Plan   Under a best case scenario,
assuming power prices remain at their maximum allowable levels under a power
emergency, we estimate that a new combined cycle natural gas-fired power
plant can earn up to a 68% ROIC.  Under a more likely scenario, assuming
average power prices approximate 60% of the maximum allowable level, such a
plant could earn a 25% ROIC.  Importantly, 2-3 years ago, power plant
developers were predicating their investment decisions on a targeted 12%
ROIC.  We have attached a spreadsheet containing our analysis.
5. FERC Settlement Conference Begins Today   Today a FERC hosted settlement
conference will begin, bringing together California power generators and
utilities.  The goal will be to get the parties to arrive at an agreement on
this issue of refunds and the repayment of past receivables.  While the
possibility of retroactive refunds presents some uncertainties for the
IPP's, we believe closure on this issue could be imminent.  The settlement
conference may bring some resolution to the situation.  Regardless, if no

According to Bloomberg, the Mission Energy Holdings deal has been cut from $1.2 billion to $700 million with price talk as high as 14%.

 

Tuesday June 26 6:32 PM ET 
Sources: Edison Reworking Bond Sale
By Jonathan Stempel 
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Edison International(NYSE:EIX <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=eix&d=t> - news <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/e/eix.html>), in a last-ditch bid to stay solvent, is restructuring a $1.2 billion junk bond sale because investors are afraid of getting caught in a second big California utility bankruptcy, bond market analysts and investors said on Tuesday. 
Edison, the parent of cash-strapped utility Southern California Edison (news <http://rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/manual/*http://search.news.yahoo.com/search/news?p=%22Southern%0ACalifornia%20Edison%22&c=&n=20&yn=c&c=news&cs=nw> - web sites <http://rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/manual/*http://search.yahoo.com/bin/search?p=Southern%20California%20Edison&cs=nw>), is considering trimming its bond sale and adding a bank term loan, the analysts and investors said. 
Rosemead, California-based Edison needs cash this week as it struggles with California's power crisis, analysts said. The company is trying to rid itself of debt maturing this year, including a fully drawn down $618 million bank credit line expiring Saturday. 
The seven-year secured notes being sold by Mission Energy Holding Co. have not found enough buyers despite carrying yields as high as 13.5 percent, analysts said. That's more than four percentage points above the recent 9.33 percent yield on a typical junk-rated electric utility bond, according to Merrill Lynch & Co. 
``We were hearing it was significantly undersubscribed around midday when the deal was scheduled to price, so the assumption is it will resurface in another form, probably much cheaper and restructured,'' said John Atkins, a corporate bond analyst at IDEAglobal.com <http://IDEAglobal.com>, a New York-based research firm. 
In the utility's semi-weekly conference call with holders of defaulted SoCal Edison debt, Chief Financial Officer Jim Scilacci said Tuesday afternoon there is ``virtually nothing the company can say'' about the private bond sale. 
Goldman Sachs & Co., which sources said is arranging the bond sale, also declined to comment. 
Edison said earlier this month it intended to use bond sale proceeds to pay down the bank credit line, as well as $250 million of notes due July 18 and $350 million due Nov. 1. 
Mission Energy Holding, which Edison created specifically to raise cash, was designed to be shielded from any bankruptcy of SoCal Edison, Edison or Edison Mission Energy. Some investors have said they are concerned the shield may not prove strong enough. 
Moody's Investors Service rated Mission Energy Holding's notes ``Ba2,'' its second highest junk grade. Standard & Poor's, rated them ``BB-minus,'' one notch lower. 
SoCal Edison, which has defaulted on $931 million of bonds and commercial paper, ran up more than $5.4 billion of debt because California's utility deregulation blocked it from recouping its soaring wholesale power costs. It agreed in April with Gov. Gray Davis (news <http://rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/manual/*http://search.news.yahoo.com/search/news?p=%22Gov.%20Gray%20Davis%22&c=&n=20&yn=c&c=news&cs=nw> - web sites <http://rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/manual/*http://search.yahoo.com/bin/search?p=Gov.%20Gray%20Davis&cs=nw>) on a rescue plan, but regulators have been slow to implement it, and many legislators oppose it. 
The utility is California's second largest; the largest, Pacific Gas & Electric Co., a unit of San Francisco-based PG&E Corp.(NYSE:PCG <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=pcg&d=t> - news <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/p/pcg.html>), filed for bankruptcy protection on April 6. 
Shares of Edison closed Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange (news <http://rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/manual/*http://search.news.yahoo.com/search/news?p=%22New%20York%20Stock%0AExchange%22&c=&n=20&yn=c&c=news&cs=nw> - web sites <http://rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/manual/*http://search.yahoo.com/bin/search?p=York%20Stock%20Exchange>) at $11.24, down 33 cents. They have fallen 28 percent this year.

Mike:  Attached is a revised draft of the First Amendment to the Indian Mess II PPA. This draft contains the banking clarification (section 4.04), assignment clarification concerning the Enron guaranty (section 5.05) and the termination payment fix requested by the lenders (section (9.03).  I understand that David Mitchell and Joe Deffner are still looking at the section 5.05 and section 9.03 changes on behalf of EPMI, but I wanted to get this out for review so that we can finalize it as soon as possible in order to move forward with our Indian Mesa II project debt and equity providers.  Please pass this draft along to the appropriate in-house counsel at EPMI and let me know if you have any comments.  Thanks

Regards

John

In our meeting this week, I forgot to mention that we need to move the accounting responsibility for Onondaga from the gas group over to Chris Sherman and Billy Fleenor. Billy wanted me to check with you before they move it. If you're ok with this, please send me a return e-mail.

I've spoken with Pushkar regarding the ECP interest rate hedges. There were two sets of hedges put in place. Notional value of $32.68mm executed 5/16/2000 and $350mm on 3/15/2001. I have asked Pushkar to research the cash flows he hedged to determine how those tranche sizes came about. 

The Fair Value of Enron's equity and sub debt (net of the $30mm Merlin piece) per the DASH of December 7, 2000 indicated a value at that time of $360mm. Additionally, the DASH assumed further gain in the base case of approximately $8mm suggesting there might have been $368mm of value to hedge. Because the generic five year Treasury yields also declined from 5.262% on Dec 7 (DASH date) to 4.508% by March 15 (closing/hedging date), the value of the El Paso fixed cash flow stream would have increased in value above $368mm (perhaps to the $380mm range - that's what I've asked Pushkar to check), it would seem to indicate that the original hedges were rolled into the subsequent hedges to represent the value of the entire transaction at final closing. In that case, the original Linden 6 hedges would not be open positions at all but rather a part of the hedging strategy that was required at closing per the executed DASH.

Pushkar has indicated he will look into his files to ascertain how the hedges were sized. Assuming the above accurately portrays what occurred, it would appear the transaction steps at execution followed the DASH requirements. I will followup as early as possible next week.

Joe

The DASH requires that Enron Corp provide additional security behind its gu=
aranty of EPMI's obligations (capped at $100mm) to India Mesa 2 in the even=
t Enron Corp's senior unsecured rating drops below investment grade. My pos=
ition to EWC was that given there is no cause for alarm (or better said, av=
ailable remedy) from the creditor/equity side whether our credit is BBB+ or=
 BBB-, why should it matter that we assign to an entity that is BBB-. Tod a=
greed to that this morning after his discussion with Jay. I will verify wit=

anking Provisions and their original intent.  We also agree that if we assi=
gn the PPA to an affiliate the Enron Corp guarantee will follow.
=20
So you have two remaining points to address which can be managed outside of=
 EPMI. =20
=20
(i)     The right to assign to a BBB- or above.  Joe has read the DASH whic=
h also indicates a BBB- assignment provision.  I think this is something th=
at the lenders should be able to price for you.
(ii)     The curtailment issue which is a buyer / AEP issue which should be=
 solved by them managing this risk through curtailment credits or some othe=
r means through their portfolio as mentioned by Tod in our meeting.
=20
We obviously can price these if necessary as indicated by Kevin in his prev=
ious note to ensure you are making the right decision.  The contract is wor=
th around $11mm today.

Joe has been working with the finance guys on Indian Mesa II and should be =
able to offer some assistance, but unless the economics state we should cha=

 Kevin,   <?xml:namespace prefix =3D o ns =3D "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:of=
fice:office" />

EWC requires three clarifications to the PPA in order to get the project fi=
nanced and sold.  All previously requested amendments proposed by the equit=
y purchaser have been dropped, and EWC will take the resulting pricing redu=
ction. =20

I want to make sure you understand how minor these three clarifications are=
.   These clarifications conform to the original deal and are NOT changes t=
o the deal. =20

 1.  Banking Provisions.   EWC and EPMI agreed that energy and renewable en=
ergy credits ("RECS") produced by the Indian Mesa II wind generating facili=
ty in any year in excess of the annual minimum quantity would, on a cumulat=
ive basis, offset any deficiencies of energy and RECS in subsequent years. =
Section 4.04 of the agreement does not clearly provide the cumulative carry=
over mechanism which was contemplated by the parties. (This section origina=
lly provided for the carryover, but in an effort to simplify the language, =
the aggregate carryover concept was clouded.)  Both the project lenders and=
 the proposed equity purchaser have required that the point be clarified.  =
There has never been a disagreement between EPMI and EWC on the intention o=
f the carryover banking provisions. EPMI's most recent refusal to make this=
 clarification now appears to be a change in the original deal

 2.  Grid Curtailment EWC and EPMI  drafted the contract  with specific pro=
visions relating to  termination resulting from grid curtailment, Section 5=
.04  .  There is an ambiguity in that grid curtailment could also be covere=
d  under the termination provision relating  to force majeure under Section=
 5.02.  This  inconsistency is the problem.  Neither EWC nor EPMI were to p=
ay damages to the other party in the event of grid curtailment.  The propos=
ed equity purchasers have requested that the force majeure provisions of  t=
he PPA  be clarified to make it clear that extended grid curtailment would =
not give rise to termination payments.  This clarification is consistent wi=
th the original intent of the parties and is not a change to the deal.

 3.  EPMI Credit Support.  EPMI's obligations under the PPA are guaranteed =
by Enron.  The Indian Mesa II PPA permits EPMI to assign the PPA to certain=
 affiliates without consent of the seller.   Any assignment by EPMI would n=
ot relieve it of its duties and obligations under the contract, and the Enr=
on guarantee would remain in place.  However, the project lenders have requ=
ired clarification that the Enron guarantee would either explicitly remain =
in place or that the assignee would have a credit quality at least as good =
as Enron Corp's credit quality.  The project lender's have also requested t=
hat the termination payment provisions be clarified to provide that any sub=
stitute PPA used to calculate a termination payment would also need to be w=
ith a party that had a credit quality similar to Enron Corp's, since that i=
s the credit that is supporting the Indian Mesa II PPA.  This will not affe=
ct the value of the contract to a third party since Enron bears this obliga=
tion unless released by the project.

Under the dispute resolution provisions of the PPA we could certainly pursu=
e declaratory relief under arbitration.  Our sense is that this does nothin=
g but ensure delay.

 From an Enron perspective:

?     The sale of the equity and the financing of the non-recourse debt on =
the Indian Mesa II project is currently at a standstill due to issues surro=
unding the ambiguities in the PPA

?      While the debt financing for the Indian Mesa I project is in place (=
different offtaker) the proposed equity sale to AEP is linked to the sale o=
f the Indian Mesa II project.

?     If Enron cannot move forward with the financing of the project within=
 the next month, Enron will likely end up with approximately $153M less cas=
h at year end than it counted on in its plan, in addition to any decrease i=
n planned earnings

?    The after-tax return to Enron in a "hold" situation is 0%, due to Enro=
n being in the Alternative Minimum Tax position, i.e. it cannot use the tax=
 benefits.

It was clear in the discussions with the City of San Antonio that these cla=
rifications would have had no affect on value.  =20

You asked me to look into this (the Ford sponsorship thing).

I think they will be unlikely to deliver on the benefits promised by M3 Management (their marketing consultant) and will add little value to our dealmaking opportunities with Ford.

I will pass the info. along to EES to see if they have any interest in paying the $7 million for general advertising exposure.

I expect to have an agreement with ABB by then end of the week providing primarily for:

1.  Increasing contract price of no more than $6.2MM, from $46.5MM to $52.7MM (note however that this increase is spread over the construction schedule - no cash out until NTP is given).
2.  Lowering the specific performance targets for line losses on the asset from 5.9% to 4.3%.  The NPV associated with the lower line losses offsets the increase in contract price.  
3.  ENA option to give NTP any time between June and December 31.  After NTP is given, ABB will have 15.5 months to deliver the asset.

We sent a proposal to ABB (providing for a contract increase of only $3.0MM even though $6.2 works economically) last week (attached).  On the customer side, Enron de Mexico is still working with DeAcero and the CFE.  The current agreement with DeAcero expires a the end of June.

We are also pitching the deal to GM and Ford in the U.S., as well as Kimberly Clark in Mexico.  I am trying to get to Detroit within the next couple of weeks (we are exchanging CA's with GM).  We have filed the Presidential Permit application - it should be public in a week or so.  I am hoping this will help stir demand in the U.S.

There should be no change in valuation.  We have run the ABB proposal by RAC and they approved it, subject of course to management approval.

Louise,

- Please let me know if you want me to push for Karen's involvement in the Origination track.


When you have a moment, would appreciate some time to go over some or all of the following:

- EES approach/response
- Update on TexMex
- My various homework assignments (Origination Track, brownbag lunches, new contact mgmt system, etc.)
- Realistic expectation of MidWest earnings in Q4 (I know I'm already hung, but what the heck).
- Some ideas for elephants 
- General catch up

Thanks,

Dave

I just spoke with Karla Haislip, who heads up the Origination Group at VEPCO.  She was fairly upset about the last meeting Enron had with them and was adamant that our next meeting be dramatically different from the previous one.  I assured her that we would have the appropriate decision makers at the meeting who could intelligently discuss the various options.  I also told her that we were committed to working with them and that our COO, Louise Kitchen, would be calling Kevin Howell,  President of Dominion Energy Clearinghouse (their trading division).  She said she'd communicate that to Kevin.

We have agreed to meet early part of the week of November 5th.  Will give you feedback re. this after our meeting with Richard and Elizabeth on Monday.

Once again, Kevin Howell's contact details are as follows:

We currently have an EPC contract with the City of Austin to develop a project using the LM 6000's that we sold to them. This is followed by a 2 year PPA at a fixed heat rate. It is currently being managed by Mike Curry. Doug Gilbert-Smith and I are both ready to elevate Drew Tingleaf to a leadership position in ERCOT. We both think that his leadership would be valuable for the group and that the Mike Curry issue can be managed. Any problems?

Good Morning,

Attached, please find the latest issue of our Independent Power Weekly.

 <<IPW080601.pdf>> 
Also note that on September 10 and 11, CSFB will host a Power Generation
Supply Chain Conference at the Plaza Hotel in New York City.  This event is
designed to provide investors with a wholistic perspective on all aspects of
the sector-from coal and natural gas companies, to equipment and
construction service providers, to the power producers themselves.  Please
contact us if you would like additional information.

1. IPPs Rise 0.4%   Last week our IPP composite rose 0.4%, slightly
underperforming both the NASDAQ (+1.8%) and the S&P 500 (+0.7%).  Mirant,
which was up 6.1%, was the strongest performer in the group.  Shaw Group was
the weakest performer, falling 5.9%.

2. Barrons Predicts "Power Glut"   Over the weekend an article in Barrons
suggested that the industry was facing a generation capacity glut, which
would have negative investment implications for some of the Independent
Power Producers.  In support of this thesis, the article cited the large
number of announced capacity additions as well as recent power price trends.
We dispute this article's conclusions for 3 reasons.  1. Announced capacity
additions cannot be taken at face value; 2. The article's thesis does not
consider the potential for retirement of existing capacity, and 3. The
regional characteristics of the power generation market resist such broad
sweeping generalizations.

3. Credit Spreads Continue to Improve   Importantly, while our IPP equity
composite has traded off more than 10% over the last few weeks, IPP credit
spreads continue to tighten.  For example, while Calpine shares have traded
off 11% since July 6, the spreads on CPN's 10 year 8.5% notes due 2011 have
actually tightened by more than 50 basis points.  Last week alone, CPN
spreads tightened by 12 basis points, while the stock traded off 3%.  To
cite another example, while Mirant shares have traded off 8% over the same
period, the spreads on MIR's 7.9% notes due 2009 have tightened by 55 basis
points.  

4. Q2 Earnings Review   Last week second quarter earnings results were
reported by Black Hills, Cleco, DPL, Entergy, Mirant and Orion Power.
Upside surprises were reported by DPL, ETR, MIR and ORN.  Versus
expectations, Mirant's results were the strongest, coming in 21% above our
estimate.  Cleco was the only company that posted an earnings
disappointment, reporting Q2 results that were 22% below our estimate.  

5. Power Market Update   Last week power prices were up considerably as
evidenced by the 27% increase in the Mirant National Power Index.  With the
exception of the Western market, power prices got a boost from hot
temperatures that blanketed most of the country.  The Texas market
experienced unusual volatility owing to recent wholesale market design
changes and the initiation of a retail competition pilot program.

Regards,

I don't know what his experience has been, but Mr. Cartwright appears to be a bit pessimistic on EME credit.  Could he be confusing the EME loans with the Mission Holdings loans?

Subject: POWER: Edison Mission Energy Lines Up $750 Mln Loan to
Refinance Debt


2001-07-26 15:30 (New York)


     Rosemead, California, July 26 (Bloomberg) -- Edison Mission
Energy, a subsidiary of Edison International, is lining up a $750
million loan to help refinance $1.25 billion of maturing bank
debt, according to people close to the company.
     Credit Suisse First Boston is leading the transaction, which
will be held by a small number of banks, those familiar with the
loan said.
     The generating company is a separate legal entity from Edison
and its insolvent utility subsidiary, Southern California Edison.
A holding company that owns all of Edison Mission's stock was set
up earlier this year to protect the company's assets in case the
utility ends up in bankruptcy.
     ``It would be harder to get any financing done at any of the
Edison subsidiaries after a bankruptcy filing'' by Southern
California Edison, said Jon Kyle Cartwright, a senior energy
credit analyst at Raymond James & Associates, Inc. in St.
Petersburg, Florida.
     Edison Mission borrowed from its three bank lines and has to
repay bank debt of $250 million by mid-August. The new loan will
replace the $1 billion of bank credit lines that the company has
to repay by Oct. 10, the people said.
     ``Getting this financing done is probably one of the reasons
that SoCalEd hasn't filed'' for bankruptcy protection, Cartwright
said.

                      Negotiating a Solution

     Southern California Edison ran up more than $5.4 billion in
debts to pay for soaring wholesale power costs last year. The
state's power deregulation laws prohibited the company from
passing on those costs in the form of higher consumer rates.
     In an effort to conserve cash, the utility defaulted on more
than $930 million of notes and commercial paper in January. The
utility also owes energy providers more than $1 billion. Any three
unsecured creditors can file a petition to put the utility into
involuntary bankruptcy.
     Ted Craver, chief financial officer at Edison, said that the
company believes that bankruptcy isn't an answer to the
``political/regulatory problem'' that put the utility into this
position. ``We continue to seek a negotiated solution to restore''
the utility's creditworthiness, Craver said on a conference call
with investors holding the defaulted debt.
     While Southern California Edison is junk-rated, Edison
Mission Energy has the lowest investment grade credit ratings --
``BBB-'' from Standard & Poor's and ``Baa3'' from Moody's
Investors Service.

                        Investment Grade

     Edison Mission sold $600 million of 10-year notes in April,
which are trading between 96 and 97 cents on the dollar, up from
between 92.5 and 95 cents on the dollar at the end of June.
     Moody's based the company's investment grade ratings on the
fact that it has enough cash flow to cover its debts and that its
assets ought to be protected in case Southern California Edison
either files for bankruptcy protection or is pushed into it.
     The new loans are split between 364-day and three-year
maturities, bankers familiar with the deal said.
     ``These are lottery tickets, not investments,'' said
Cartwright. Those who buy them are ``investing on optimism, not on
arithmetic, and that isn't a good investment strategy.''
     The bankruptcy remote structure, which PG&E Corp., the parent
of bankrupt Pacific Gas & Electric Co., also put in place to
protect its generating subsidiary's assets, hasn't been tested in
court yet, analysts said.

BelowConse nsus Estimates; Reducing Target Price


 <<RRI092701.pdf>> 
Good Morning,

Attached, please find our FC note on Reliant Resources.

Summary:
	1. On September 27, 2001, RRI announced it would acquire Orion Power
for $26.80 in an all-cash transaction.
	?	2. In our view this deal has very positive implications for
the sector.  The purchase price is essentially in-line with our estimate of
the private market value of ORN's asset portfolio ($26.83).  Overall, the
deal gives us addition confidence in our valuation framework and reinforces
our view that valuations in the sector are extremely attractive.  
	?	3. RRI is leaving unchanged its 2002 EPS guidance of
$2.05-$2.15.  In doing so, RRI noted that the earnings contribution from
this deal (+$0.30) will offset the negative impact of sluggish conditions in
the Western power markets.  
	?	4. Our 2001 and 2002 EPS estimates remain unchanged at $1.62
and $1.95.  Our 2002 estimate continues to be below company guidance, giving
us comfort in our forecast.  
	?	5. Importantly, for 2002 RRI's Western generation assets are
currently less than 50% hedged, which is well below the company's peers
including CPN (Strong Buy, $19.75) and MIR (Buy, $19.60).  As such, the
company is relatively more exposed to commodity price volatility in that
region of the country.    
6. We are reducing our target price to $30 from $40.  We derive this
valuation from our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis, which employs an
11.4% discount rate.  Our revised target price reflects: 1. The $2.9 billion
acquisition expenditure; 2. The $1.8 billion of assumed net debt; 3. The
incremental earnings and synergies associated with the deal; and, 4. The
earnings shortfall at RRI's Western operations and slower overall growth
prospects for the business.  

Regards,

Neil Stein   212/325-4217

Sources: Edison Reworking Bond Sale
By Jonathan Stempel 
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Edison International(NYSE:EIX <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=eix&d=t> - news <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/e/eix.html>), in a last-ditch bid to stay solvent, is restructuring a $1.2 billion junk bond sale because investors are afraid of getting caught in a second big California utility bankruptcy, bond market analysts and investors said on Tuesday. 
Edison, the parent of cash-strapped utility Southern California Edison (news <http://rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/manual/*http://search.news.yahoo.com/search/news?p=%22Southern%0ACalifornia%20Edison%22&c=&n=20&yn=c&c=news&cs=nw> - web sites <http://rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/manual/*http://search.yahoo.com/bin/search?p=Southern%20California%20Edison&cs=nw>), is considering trimming its bond sale and adding a bank term loan, the analysts and investors said. 
Rosemead, California-based Edison needs cash this week as it struggles with California's power crisis, analysts said. The company is trying to rid itself of debt maturing this year, including a fully drawn down $618 million bank credit line expiring Saturday. 
The seven-year secured notes being sold by Mission Energy Holding Co. have not found enough buyers despite carrying yields as high as 13.5 percent, analysts said. That's more than four percentage points above the recent 9.33 percent yield on a typical junk-rated electric utility bond, according to Merrill Lynch & Co. 
``We were hearing it was significantly undersubscribed around midday when the deal was scheduled to price, so the assumption is it will resurface in another form, probably much cheaper and restructured,'' said John Atkins, a corporate bond analyst at IDEAglobal.com <http://IDEAglobal.com>, a New York-based research firm. 
In the utility's semi-weekly conference call with holders of defaulted SoCal Edison debt, Chief Financial Officer Jim Scilacci said Tuesday afternoon there is ``virtually nothing the company can say'' about the private bond sale. 
Goldman Sachs & Co., which sources said is arranging the bond sale, also declined to comment. 
Edison said earlier this month it intended to use bond sale proceeds to pay down the bank credit line, as well as $250 million of notes due July 18 and $350 million due Nov. 1. 
Mission Energy Holding, which Edison created specifically to raise cash, was designed to be shielded from any bankruptcy of SoCal Edison, Edison or Edison Mission Energy. Some investors have said they are concerned the shield may not prove strong enough. 
Moody's Investors Service rated Mission Energy Holding's notes ``Ba2,'' its second highest junk grade. Standard & Poor's, rated them ``BB-minus,'' one notch lower. 
SoCal Edison, which has defaulted on $931 million of bonds and commercial paper, ran up more than $5.4 billion of debt because California's utility deregulation blocked it from recouping its soaring wholesale power costs. It agreed in April with Gov. Gray Davis (news <http://rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/manual/*http://search.news.yahoo.com/search/news?p=%22Gov.%20Gray%20Davis%22&c=&n=20&yn=c&c=news&cs=nw> - web sites <http://rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/manual/*http://search.yahoo.com/bin/search?p=Gov.%20Gray%20Davis&cs=nw>) on a rescue plan, but regulators have been slow to implement it, and many legislators oppose it. 
The utility is California's second largest; the largest, Pacific Gas & Electric Co., a unit of San Francisco-based PG&E Corp.(NYSE:PCG <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=pcg&d=t> - news <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/p/pcg.html>), filed for bankruptcy protection on April 6. 
Shares of Edison closed Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange (news <http://rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/manual/*http://search.news.yahoo.com/search/news?p=%22New%20York%20Stock%0AExchange%22&c=&n=20&yn=c&c=news&cs=nw> - web sites <http://rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/manual/*http://search.yahoo.com/bin/search?p=York%20Stock%20Exchange>) at $11.24, down 33 cents. They have fallen 28 percent this year.

Louise,

I understand there is concern that the value associated with the assignment of the Lincoln Electric Sales Agreement to OPPD is not sufficient to justify paying $1.3 million to OPPD in order for them to assume this contract. 

There are some considerations on this contract which I think are important and which may not have been mentioned to you:

- The original sales contract to Lincoln was entered into several years ago and is one of the contracts sometimes referred to internally as "toxic waste".
- About a month ago, we agreed verbally with OPPD to accept assignment of the sales contract, as OPPD is one of the few parties which can serve it.
- The execution of the documents has been delayed by Lincoln, who were initially refusing to consent to the assignment
- We have another, larger under-water transaction with OPPD which we would like to move off the books at some point. We'd like to keep OPPD happy to improve the chances that we can negotiate their buyout of our other sales contract to them)
- If we fail to deliver, we will be subject to penalties in the amount of $45,0000 per MW on top of Liquidated Damages (Lincoln is 15 MW for 02 and 30 MW for 03).
- This is a highly constrained area (only 6 counterparties can physically deliver in this area and OPPD is the only one which has the surplus power in order to serve Lincoln): the chance that we will be unable to deliver is high.
- There is intangible value associated with not being in a situation where Enron fails to deliver.
- Even if we do wind up serving the contract, the highly constrained nature of the area means we will likely be forced to pay extortionate prices for the power we do acquire.
- Trading wishes to be out of this contract for aforementioned reasons and the fact that it will be very labour intensive to serve (day-ahead notice on 20% monthly load factor)

Obviously, if the above is not sufficient justification to put the money out the door now, then we will smooth things as much as possible with OPPD - but I wanted to make sure you had all the info. before we kill the deal. 

Terri has stalled OPPD until Monday.

Dave

As you probably know, Rogers (in the East) and Don (in the West) will be working directly with the wholesale desk.   Tim and I will ensure a fair balance is achieved between retail and wholesale.

As an Enron shareholder, I fully appreciate that we need explosive growth and profitability out of EES, particularly with reduced volatility in gas and power markets over the next several years.

I am commited to ensuring that the retail risk management organization is offered all the tools, information, systems, competitive pricing, etc. to allow EES to offer fully bundled competitively priced products to retail customers.

I look forward to working with you and Dave in continuing to grow this business.

  Belgian energy group Tractebel has won a large electricity contract in
the US. Tractebel will manage all electricity acquisitions of US
electricity distributor Niagara Mohawk Corporation, which has a customer
base of 1.5 million in the north of New York State. The value of the
contract has not been revealed.

  Temi, Tractebel's US electricity trading and sales division, will
supply 35,000 gigawatt hours of electricity to the US distributor. In
comparison: total Belgian electricity usage amounted to 75,000 gigawatt
hours in the year 2000. Niagara's customer base includes both private
and industrial users. Temi is taking over all current contracts for
electricity supply to Niagara.

Stuart,

Per our discussion of earlier this afternoon, I am forwarding a series of e:mails that contain the latest drafts of the three principal documents--the SPA, the Asset Management Agreement, and the Brokerage Agreement--as well as the Schedules & Exhibits to the SPA.  The SPA and the Schedules/Exhibits are ENA's latest drafts and the other two documents are AIG (Milbank Tweed's) responses.

Heather Kroll and I plan to meet at Bracewell tomorrow morning at 9:00a.m.  The AIG/Milbank folks are expected to arrive around 10:00, and we believe you could provide valuable input should you be in a position to attend on such short notice.  

As you will see from the Milbank markups a number of significant issues remain.  For example, their addition of (ii) to Section 8(c) of the Brokerage Agreement shows that AIG has yet to agree that ECT Securities liability for performance defaults should be limited to termination. 

Its going to be an interesting week.  Glad to have your insight.

Steve

Attached please find clean and black-lined versions of the SPA.  The black-lined version is marked to show changes against the draft distributed by MTH&M on April 27, 2001.  The riders distributed last night have been incorporated into this draft without any modifications.

Dear All, 

Please find attached hereto our comments to (1) the Brokerage Agreement; (2) the Riders to the Securities Purchase Agreement and (3) the Asset Management Agreement.  We have included clean and marked versions of each (marked versus the most recent drafts received from B&P).  Highstar has not reviewed in detail the drafts being distributed, and they remain subject to Highstar's comment.

In addition, we have not yet completed our review of the revised SPA.  However, we note two SPA-related issues that have arisen independent of the revised draft:

1.      As a condition to the Closing Date, Highstar requests that Seller provide it with a bringdown on the title policies to the Closing Date.

2.      Highstar believes that, due to, among other things, the uncertainty regarding the timing of receipt of the approval from the NCPUC, the "drop dead" date in the SPA should be extended to July 31.

We look forward to discussing the documents with you next week. 

Best regards, 

Bill

I have already spoken with the guy at Wisvest charged with re-marketing the assets.  I expressed to him our desire to discuss acquisition of the plants and that we are prepared to move quickly.   He indicated that they are going to take the next couple of weeks to assess how best to re-market these facilities, and that they were leaning towards an "open RFP" type process, perhaps with the help of an i-bank advisor.
 
My objective is to steer them away from this path, and in that regard, I gave him a run-down of a number of reasons why they would do well to enter discussions with us ASAP (e.g., unique situation in that we serve load in UI's area, good relationship with the CT regulators, no market power concerns that killed the NRG deal, ability to affect improvements/clean-up at the sites, etc.).  He asked me to send him a letter outlining these qualifiers, and was recptive to a meeting in the near future (I am going to try and hook up with him in CT as he is on business there this week).
 
As for location, these plants definitely are in a good spot given that southern CT is quite constrained.  However, the really binding constraint is in the Norwalk-Stamford area --  these plants are located outside of this area.  I am trying to get some more granular information on the locations/severity of constraints in southern CT to help assess constraints in the Bridgeport-New Haven area where the plants are.
 
One other point is that the one of the units at the Bridgeport station is in deactived reserve (an 80 MW oil plant), so there may be some relatively cheap expansion/repowering plays.
 
I did learn that they have an asset management deal with a 3rd-party through mid next year, unless they sell off the plants before then.
 
I will update with status as we move along
 
John

Both John Llodra and Don Miller have had discussions with regard to pursuing these assets over the last week.  Essentially, these plants may be the first distress sales we see in the market place.
 
John/Don - can you let everyone know how you plan to move forward.

Subject: Conn. Coal Plants


As most of you know, NRG's proposed purchase of two coal plants in Conneticut (UI's territory) was recently cancelled due to regulatory issues at FERC.   The purchase and sale transaction between Wisvest and NRG was originally entered into almost two years ago.   The proposed purchase price of $350 million for 1000 MW of coal was a "bargain price" at the time due to environmental risks that are specific to the state of CT.
 
Over the past 2-3 years, the State of Conneticut has threatened to have these coal plants shut down due to pollution issues and Wisvest was concerned enough about this risk that they "puked" the plants to NRG for $350/kW in early 2000.   At a minimum, it is expected that $100-150/kW of SCR and/or scrubbers will be required at these facilities to appease the CT regulatory bodies.
 
My strong view is that, as a practical matter, the plants cannot be shut down or the lights would go out in CT.   The area where the plants are located is quite possibly the most congested area in the entire Eastern Interconnect.   The load pocket is significantly short MW and transmission import capability is inadequate to serve the load in this area.   In a true "locational marginal price" environment, the prices would likely be similar to Zone J in New York   Currently, pricing in NEPOOL is generally socialized with congestion costs spread equally to all loads, regardless of who causes the congestion.   
 
In the recently proposed "single NE RTO" model, it is about 80% certain that the PJM "locational marginal price" market model will be implemented sometime between mid-2003 and mid-2004.   At that point in time, consumers in the congested areas of NEPOOL (in-city Boston and CT) will be exposed to higher energy prices, while consumers in Maine, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island should see lower prices.
 
Given the facts above, coupled with traditional asset companies too long to show good bids for incremental assets, I think EWS should pursue discussions with Wisvest immediately and attempt to buy these coal plants at what could be extremely favorable economics relative to our forward curve in NEPOOL and our bullish view for relative pricing at the asset "node".   
 
If we could buy these plants for approx $250/kW with $150/kW of environmental upgrades, the resulting "all-in" (depr, fixed & variable O&M, fuel costs, NOx, SO2, capital reserve, interest) 7x24 plant cost would be approx. $34-36/Mwh.    This is lower than our energy only socialized NEPOOL curve.   Additional upside is derived from positive basis, ICAP, ancillary services, emissions allowances, and long term requirements sales to LSE's.
 
Lavo and Louise - This could be the "Alberta PPA" for 2002.   Lots of "hair" but lots of upside.
 
Any thoughts?

Subject:	Loretta Pricing

John and Louise -

Based on your meeting with Kevin and Dave earlier today, I understand you would like a breakdown of the expenditures expected to develop a Texas coal plant to the point that it can be monetized.

The below is my best estimate for developing the Brownsville site to get to the monetization point (permits in hand and EPC contract signed).  I expect to have both an EPC contract and permits in hand some time around Sep '02 if we start with the expenditures in mid July '01.  Expenditures will be incurred at the rate of approximately $350,000 per month for the next 12 months.  We can back out at any time with only prompt month plus one additional month committed.

Costs for a Florida site will be similar; however, expenditures will not start until we achieve site control.

My recommendation is to start fully developing the Brownsville, TX site with a plan to flip the site once we have a permit, as market conditions warrant.  I recommend holding off on significant expenditures in Florida until we get more comfortable with site control.

Mitch

I would like to make the message even more clear.  EPMI will not be making any changes, amendments, clarifications, interpretations, etc. to the current Indian Mesa II PPA.   Therefore, any proposed purchaser of the Indian Mesa facility must evaluate the contract based on their own legal and commercial interpretation.
 
I don't think it is productive to spend any more time on this discussion.   We will continue provide Enron Wind with the PPA value on a daily basis such that total shareholder value is maximized for any proposed wind transaction (sale of company and/or sale of IM project).
 
Please feel free to call me to discuss (713-853-5035)

We are not interested in these changes to the PPA.  These changes will weaken the language in the contract for us (i.e. improve it for AEP that is probably why they are asking for the "clarifications").  I will be out next week on vacation so please address any further concerns in my absence to Kevin Presto.  Regards, - Mike

Subject:        Amendment to IM II PPA 

Mike:  Attached is our proposed amendment to the Indian Mesa II PPA.  It deals with the banking clarification (section 4.04 amendments), grid curtailment clarification (section 5.02 amendments), guaranty clarifications requested by the lenders (section 5.05 and 9.03 amendments), and the  ERCOT amendment (section 3.04 amendments) that we have discussed.  Please note that the ERCOT restriction would permit international sales, such as to Mexico, but would otherwise restrict EPMI's sales of energy from the wind facility to other locations within ERCOT.  In the preparation of this draft, we used the same amendment that was previously sent to you by e-mail on 8/22/01.  That e-mail had a redline with it to show the changes to the banking provisions.  Please let us know whether this draft is acceptable or whether you have any questions or comments on the amendment.  Thanks

Regards 

John

Subject: CSFB Independent Power Weekly--Issue #41


 <<IPW082701.pdf>> 
Good Morning,

Attached, please find the latest issue of our Independent Power Weekly.

Also note that on September 10 and 11, CSFB will host a Power Generation
Supply Chain Conference at the Plaza Hotel in New York City.  The power
generators will speak on the morning of 9/11.  Companies presenting include:
CPN, MIR, NRG, ORN, RRI and TE.

1. IPPs Rise 3.9%   Last week our IPP composite rose 3.9%, outperforming
both the NASDAQ (+2.7%) and the S&P 500 (+2.0%).  This was the strongest
performance for our composite since the second week of July.  Calpine, which
was up 10.9%, was the strongest performer in the group.  Global Power
Equipment Group was the weakest performer, falling 3.4%.

2. Recognition of Attractive Valuations and CPN Conference Call Boost Stock
Prices   We attribute last week's performance to a growing recognition that
the group is simply oversold.  Indeed, on average the pure play IPPs are
trading at 11.6x 2002 EPS, which represents a 40%+ valuation compression
year to date.  More immediately, we believe a conference call hosted by
Calpine on Monday (8/20) helped ease investor concerns regarding the
supply/demand outlook for the sector and the ability of power generators to
attract capital to grow their businesses.  

3. Calpine Hosting Final Special Topic Conference Call   On Tuesday (8/28),
Calpine will conclude its special topic conference call series with a
discussion of the California power market.  The call will take place at 2 pm
EDT.  The dial-in number is 877/692-2137.  On the call, management will
provide a regulatory update and describe the steps it has taken to respond
to the power shortages in the state.

4. California Windfall Profits Tax Bill Resurfaces   Today (8/27), the
California Assembly Revenue and Taxation Committee will consider SB 1 XX-the
power generator Windfall Profits Tax bill.  Importantly, while earlier
versions of the bill implied that the tax would be retroactive and applied
to power sales going back to January 1, 2001, the current version of the
bill suggests that the tax will not be implemented until early 2002.  In
addition, an internal analysis of the bill done by the Assembly Revenue and
Taxation Committee suggests that the bill could be subject to several legal
challenges if it is passed.  

Regards,

Neil Stein   212/325-4217

We finally connected.

Beau Normark (sp?), ABB President is coming for a visit to the local ABB office and wants to meet with Enron as part of a general meet n' greet (as suspected).

They don't have any particular agenda in mind, but will probably want to talk a bit about the business relationship Enron and ABB have enjoyed in the past, our current projects (e.g. TexMex) and any plans we might care to share about the future.

John & Louise -

To follow up on our previous meeting regarding the coal initiative, I've attached a brief description of the approach going forward, including some first-cut proforma results.  Our goal over the next month is to more fully vet the cost and operations numbers in the attached and to nail down probable sites.

In mid-April, after we've more fully vetted the costs, we'll route our detailed proforma.

After reviewing, let me know if you have questions or want to discuss further.

Mitch

Louise / Dave:

We have been talking to accounting over the past several days regarding Onondaga as I mentioned in our meeting yesterday. For whatever reason, our interest in Onondaga (through the Cash Flow Interest Agreement) is viewed by accounting as a receivable. From a commercial standpoint, this is incorrect, but at the end of the day, it doesn't really matter. Billy's e-mail below basically states that because of how the Onondaga interest has been classified, we should reduce the $7.9 million by the $1.1 million payment received last week, but then readjust the value of the asset.

Based on our internal valuation, and based on the written indication we received this week from a prospective purchaser, adjusting the value of the "receivable" to $10 million (after application of the $1.1 million payment received) would be very conservative. This would net a gain of $3.1 million for Q3.

With your concurrence, I will work with Billy to support the adjustment of Onondaga to $10 million (and therefore the gain of $3.1 million). I will advise him to credit the gain to my profit center unless you tell me otherwise.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Regards,

Ben

Ben,

Based upon the review of the Cashflow Interest Agreement, Partnership Agreement and numerous discussions with internal accountants we have determined that it is inappropriate to recognize the cash payment received as income.  The basis that is carried on our books currently (approx. $7.9 mm) represents a long-term receivable that resulted from the tracking account arrangement under the original gas supply agreement between ENA and OCLP.  In addition, This asset does not qualify for the MTM or Fair Value accounting models.  The payment received from OCLP based on the Cashflow Interest Agreement should reduce the long term receivable that is currently recorded on our books.

However,  it is also our understanding that in the prior year a management decision was made to reduce/write-off  $8 million of this long-term receivable based upon the best information available at the time.  As stated below our internal sales efforts now support the conclusion that the prior year write down was more than it should have been.  This would suggest that we need to effectively adjust the write down of the asset to reflect what we truly believe is collectible.  This will be considered a change in accounting estimate will flow through the current quarter earnings if management makes the decision that this asset was incorrectly written down in the prior year.  This basically gets you the the same accounting treatment as MTM.

A few things need to be noted:

1) Support will need to be provided that substantially supports the adjustment of our valuation of this asset. Please provide this to me 

2) You will have to resolve the geography of the income that results from the increase in the asset.  Supposedly Corp took the write down....may cause problems.

3) Somebody will have to accept responsibility for the valuation exposure that this will create.  It is my understanding that RAC and Credit are not involved.

4) We need to be able to explain what basis we used in determining the write down in prior year.  We will probably get questioned by AA.

Please call me if you would like to discuss.


Regards,

Billy

Please book the payment received from Onondaga as Q3 income. In this morning's meeting with Louise, I have advised her that our internal valuation and sales efforts support this payment being taken as income.

Please advise as I need to update her tomorrow.

Thanks much.

Joe,

The following is the language from the DASH which Ben signed..."acceptable to RAC"

?	A $100 million guaranty by Enron Corporate of EPMI's obligations under the PPA has been put in place.  As a condition to closing the financing for the project, the lender (Clarica Life) has required a MAC provision stating that in the event that Enron's credit rating falls below investment grade, Enron is required to provide alternative means, acceptable to RAC, to cover its guaranty obligation.

Rogers offer is $8.00/Mwh.   This is the price he gave Ozzie and Heather approx. 1 month ago.   This value needs to be extracted from the deal and put in the trading books.

Louise:

I followed up with Markus.  He requested information on the level of exposure that was expected under the DeAcero contract, i.e. total capacity and energy payments exposed given our curves.  I am working with credit to get this to him ASAP.  I will keep you informed.

Regards,
DTT

Louise - some news and views for yourself on this credit.

Hedging this name for any duration past 5 years is all but impossible at present.
Insurance companies will write protection, with 10% first loss being taken by ENE; but proof of loss must exist and all covents must be adhered to otherwise payout can be made void.   Believe the offering you have from Zurich should be used to cover first 35 mil of 65 mil exposure at the front end.   This is the cheapest alternative but does come with certain hindrances; ie timeliness of payments and proof of loss.   An additional constraint here is the BB or better private rating ENE must get for Deacero.

What EnronCredit can offer is to hedge the excess exposure above the insurance coverage.   We would cover failure to pay and bankruptcy of said name.  We would offer protection in either a 2 or 3 year rolling tranche format.    Protection can either be bought for the duration (15yrs NPV) at 3.5%, cash settlement (Louise you get paid out 100- recovery (of financial assets)= payout).  Or on a rolling basis at 30 Bpts over where EnronCreit hedges itself in the market (expect to get 2 yr protection off at 2% per annum at present).    We have the ability to structure this tranche on an accreting or amortising basis to either suit the P95 or actual exposures (payment can be made digital; cost would be stated cost/(1-.35%(expected recovery)).

Louise if you want to call me today to discuss I will be in till 18:00 London time.

Bill, we would hedge out the credit exposure on a 1to1 basis and run the duration risk, require permission from yourself to run/manage this risk.

MKF

Hi Louise,
To refresh your memory, ENA OOC took a loss of ($1.4M) in 2nd quarter for  Doyle equity earnings per Ben Jacoby's request. He is to reimburse you upon the sale of this investment.

I am now told that he will not sell Doyle until October. The 3Q forecasted loss for Doyle is ($662K).  Should I again flash this loss in OOC, or to East Development (Jacoby)? Please advise. Thanks!

John and Louise -

Based on your meeting with Kevin and Dave earlier today, I understand you would like a breakdown of the expenditures expected to develop a Texas coal plant to the point that it can be monetized.

The below is my best estimate for developing the Brownsville site to get to the monetization point (permits in hand and EPC contract signed).  I expect to have both an EPC contract and permits in hand some time around Sep '02 if we start with the expenditures in mid July '01.  Expenditures will be incurred at the rate of approximately $350,000 per month for the next 12 months.  We can back out at any time with only prompt month plus one additional month committed.

Costs for a Florida site will be similar; however, expenditures will not start until we achieve site control.

My recommendation is to start fully developing the Brownsville, TX site with a plan to flip the site once we have a permit, as market conditions warrant.  I recommend holding off on significant expenditures in Florida until we get more comfortable with site control.

Mitch

You may get a few pointed questions about today's article about Lay's potential severance of $80MM.  Vance Meyer from PR was saying they've been briefing executives who're having floor meetings and I told him you and Lavo were having one later today too.

Recap:
The California project's ("ACE") fundamental position, coal generation in gas-on-margin market, is attractive on the fundamentals.  ACE's economics through a range of scenarios (forward SRAC rates) also appears attractive.  However, due to the uncertainty in the California market, the deal team needs to resolve issues 1. and 2. (at minimum) before returning for final approval:

Timing Risk:  Price and execute a 30-40 day call on "deal purchase" to keep competition at bay and buy time to work through market and partner risks.
Market Risk:  Approach So Cal Edison and CDWR to structure and close a deal that enables ACE to sell directly to CDWR (or other credit worthy counter party for term, or at least until So Cal Edison starts honouring its QF contract with ACE on a current pay basis.
Partner Risk:  Approach Constellation, co-managing partner in ACE, to price/structure buyout of their interest in ACE or a swap of Pennsylvania for California project positions.

Follow Up:
The following actions have been taken:

Timing Risk:  Greg Blair initiated discussions last night with the seller's advisor, Chase, to purchase an option to close in late April.  We expect to hear back from Ahlstrom (seller) today or Friday.  Deal team will notify Office of Chairman when we discover Ahlstrom's bottom line on option premium, expiration date and strike price.
Market Risk & Partner Risk:  Greg Blair and Terry Donovan put messages into Millenium (ACE manager) and Constellation to get things moving on CDWR/Edison deal and to see if we can structure a deal to get control of ACE. Substantive progress on either front will be reported.

Regards,

Mike J Miller

Louise,

In response to Tina's e-mail here is a quick list of the pipeline.  I am having the pretty hot list sheet updated and re-sent to you and Dave.

Tex-Mex    Pursuing other MOUs to become anchor or fill the HVDC capacity.  Max continuing negotiations with DeAcero and CFE.  ABB to visit in the next two weeks.  Possibility of magnetizing with TECO's Frontera.

Clarksdale/Yazoo  Finalizing asset mgt contracts.  To start May 1.  40MW long this summer in SPP.

AIG  Sale docs in progress.  Most work centered around asset mgt and brokerage agreement.

Ft. Pierce  forward movement on agreements this week.  Looking to revise cost estimates and timeline for Tuesday meeting.

Homestead  Switched permit application to 501Fs.  FPL still interested in 3yr tolling.  Need to present opportunity.

The rest will be included in the official hotlist memo.

Regards,
Ozzie

Frank,

I wanted to let you know that we recently closed an innovative, "first of its kind" transaction with Connectiv. The multi-year deal involved our PJM Demand Swaps, whereby Connectiv financed the purchase of a strip of monthly calls with the sale of multi-year puts. This was an important transaction for us as it confirmed the viability of our Demand Swap product.

Of particular note, Gil worked closely with Partho Ghosh (from the weather desk) during the entire sales process. It was Gil who identified Connectiv as a viable target and he made the initial introductions. He also provided insight into Connectiv's decision making process as the deal unfolded. He was a great help throughout and we look forward to working with Gil on the other opportunities he has identified.

I just wanted to provide you with this quick update and, as always, we look forward to working with you and your team. Thanks.

Bill

I have been working with Lehman and BofA this morning in an attempt to get a letter by close of business today so as to be in front of the insurance wrappers this week.

Cornhusker on track.  Ultimate (or perhaps penultimate) meeting on transaction docs this afternoon.

Subject:=09IM I/IM II PPA TerminationPayments.

Jay:  the IM I and IM II PPAs have different, but consistent, approaches to=
 the calculation of damages in the event that a party defaults under the ag=
reement.  The differences arise because the IM I agreement is based on more=
 typical PPAs between a independent power generator and a utility power pur=
chaser.  On the other hand, the IM II deal is a combination of such a PPA w=
ith a number of terms that more commonly foundin in power agreements betwee=
n a power marketer and a buyer.   Consistent with most PPAs with utilities,=
 the IM I agreement does not specify the method for calculating actual dama=
ges that a nondefaulting party may incur in the event of a default by the o=
ther party.  That methodology is left up to general contract law, which is =
that the nondefaulting party receives actual damages in an amount that woul=
d put them in the economic position that they would have been if the defaul=
ting party would have performed its obligations.  This is basic contract la=
w.  The IM II agreement spells out in detail the damage calculation, which =
is referred to as a "termination payment", in the agreement.  I understand =
that this approach is typical of power marketing contracts.  However, the m=
echanics are basically the same as if you went by basic contract law, other=
 than the fact that the seller is entitled to certain consequental damages =
as well as actual damages resulting from a breach by the buyer.  In the end=
,the nondefaulting party, through the payment of the termination fee is bei=
ng placed in the same economic position as if the defaulting party had perf=
ormed its obligations.  Let me know if you want further clarification on th=
is point.

Regards

John

Mike,

If you get this while on vacation, I do apologize for interrupting your break.  I have left you a voicemail on the same subject, but thought I would send it to you in writing as well.

Following up on this morning's meeting with Louise and Joe Deffner on the requested ammendments, we went through the list of issues sent by Tod 9/17, and Kevin's subsequent response.

As both Kevin and Louise stated, the first issue, the clarification on banking, is a confirmation of the "intent of the deal".  As you remember, the project's ability to bank RECs and energy, and to carry that bank forward, is the intent of the deal.  We need your recognition that this is the case so that we can go forward with this clarification ammendment.

We hope to keep this moving in your absense and appreciate your cooperation on this point.  Please give me a call, or at a minimum, please share your perspective with Louise on this issue so that we can keep the financing moving forward.

Thank you,
Michael

Subject: IPP Update: Analysis of Power Market Conditions
IndicatesSelling Was Overdone; Focus on CPN and MIR


Good Morning,

Attached, please find our latest update on the IPP sector, which includes an
analysis of recent power market conditions

 <<IPPupdate072501.pdf>> 

1. Focus on CPN and MIR   On July 24, 2001, our IPP composite traded off 8%,
owing to heightened market concerns surrounding "soft" spot and forward
power prices.  We believe the weakness presents a buying opportunity across
the whole section and recommend that investors focus on our top 2 picks:
Calpine (CPN, Strong Buy) and Mirant (MIR, Buy).

2. Power Market Analysis   In this note we include an analysis of recent
power market conditions.  We conclude that power market conditions have been
more stable than is generally believed.  Further, if conditions had
worsened, the earnings impact would not be severe.  On that basis we believe
the sell-off across the sector was overdone.

3. Beware of National Power Indices!   In order to properly analyze recent
power price fluctuations, it is key to analyze the California market
separately.  Outside of California, spark spreads have actually increased by
2.7% on average since May in a number of key markets.  Within California,
there have been large declines in pricing and margins.  However, potential
returns on capital in that market remain well above anywhere else in the
country.

4. IPPs are not Call Options on Power Prices!   The bulk of the group has
contracted substantial portions of their output.  In particular, Calpine has
sold forward 90% of its output in 2001 and 80% in 2002

5. Current Valuations Reflect the Investor Uncertainties   2001 and 2002 P/E
multiples have compressed by more than 40% year to date

6. Buy on Weakness  To the extent earnings prospects remain intact, we view
the recent weakness as irrational.

Regards,

Neil Stein   212/325-4217

To all:

Attached below is the letter signed between ENA and Highstar.  In summary, we have acknowledged that we have been unable to finalize the existing transaction but are going to discuss a restructured deal.  ENA is free to begin marketing the plants to third parties, provided that we cannot enter into binding agreements before May 11, 2001.  Either party may terminate after May 11, 2001 for any reason or no reason.

Mike:  Attached is our proposed amendment to the Indian Mesa II PPA.  It deals with the banking clarification (section 4.04 amendments), grid curtailment clarification (section 5.02 amendments), guaranty clarifications requested by the lenders (section 5.05 and 9.03 amendments), and the  ERCOT amendment (section 3.04 amendments) that we have discussed.  Please note that the ERCOT restriction would permit international sales, such as to Mexico, but would otherwise restrict EPMI's sales of energy from the wind facility to other locations within ERCOT.  In the preparation of this draft, we used the same amendment that was previously sent to you by e-mail on 8/22/01.  That e-mail had a redline with it to show the changes to the banking provisions.  Please let us know whether this draft is acceptable or whether you have any questions or comments on the amendment.  Thanks

Subject:	FW: Highlights from this morning's ENE/DYN analyst conference call

This was forwarded to me this morning.  Someone's notes from the call.

Listened in on the analyst call this morning.  Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.

The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  

Specific points:
EES will be a part of the new company.  
Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  
The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  
Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.
Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  
ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  
Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  
In what was termed a "new approach", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  
Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.  
Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'.
All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.
Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure.
Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  
Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.
Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there.
Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.  
Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.
Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.
With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.
ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  
BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.
McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.
Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.
Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model (uh-oh).  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.
Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger.
Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. 
The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.
McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements.
ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.
The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.
Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.
Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.  
McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.
Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.
Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.
ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given).
Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.'
Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.
Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.

Give me a call if you'd like me to try to clarify any of these comments.

That should change the amount we will need in escrow.  Certainly, the incremental EME risk at this time is a major risk factor.

 <<IPW092401.pdf>> 
Good Morning,

Attached, please find the latest issue of our Independent Power Weekly.

Also note that there is a replay available of our conference call, which
took place last week.  The dial-in number is 402/220-7493.  The PIN # is
7493.  The call featured Judah Rose from ICF Consulting.  Topics discussed
included: 1. Recent trends in the US power market; 2. Their impact on the
generation supply chain; and, 3. The relationship between GDP and power
demand.  A copy of the slides that accompanied Judah's presentation is
available upon request.  

Summary:
1. IPP's Fall 5.1%   Last week our our IPP composite declined 15.4%,
outperforming the NASDAQ (-15.7%), but underperforming the S&P 500 (-11.1%).
NRG Energy, which was down 8.8%, was the strongest generator in the group.
International Power was the weakest performer, declining 30.5%.

2. Generation Oriented Utilities Fall 6.9%   Our universe of generation
oriented utilities fell 6.9%, outperforming all the major market indices.
DTE Energy, which was down 2.7%, was the strongest performer in the group.
PPL was the weakest performer, declining 13.5%.

3. IPPs Trading 24% Below Private Market Asset Value   Importantly, our
analysis indicates that all the major US IPPs are now trading at or below
the private market values of their assets.  As a group, the major IPPs are
trading at a 24% average discount to their private market asset values.  NRG
Energy and Reliant Resources are trading at the most significant discounts
to their private market values-33% and 34%.  

4. Disparity Between Public and Private Market Valuations is Unsustainable
We believe this situation is unsustainable and envision 3 scenarios that
could play out.  1. Stock prices may simply rebound correcting the valuation
disparity; 2. IPPs limit the amount of capital allocated to new plant
construction and pursue share buybacks or acquisitions of other IPPs; or, 3.
Traditional utilities (both domestic and foreign) or other entities from
outside the industry pursue acquisitions of IPPs.

Team:

We had a very productive meeting with ABB today.  Attending the meeting from Enron's side were Drew Tingleaf, Scott Laidlaw, Carlos Sole and Mike Curry.  Dave Duran and Louise Kitchen spent time emphasizing our commitment to this project and some of the steps Enron is taking to see it through to conclusion.  

Attending from ABB's side were Svante Svenson (president of ABB HVDC division), Lars Carlson (project manager) and Mike Sandridge (sales rep).  

Both parties agreed to the following actions and schedule:

1.  Enron will by April 30, 2001 (Monday):
	a.  draft a letter amending and reinstating the EPC contract of 10/27/00 (the "Letter") and send it to ABB for their comments.
	b.  draft a revised Exhibit Q (cancellation payments).

2.  ABB will, by May 4, 2001, provide Enron with the following: 

	a.  propose a new schedule to the EPC contract (to replace the old schedule A-2) providing for both notice to proceed ("NTP") and corresponding guaranteed completion dates ("GCD") between May 1 and December 31, 2000 on a daily basis.  ABB verbally stated their strong commitment towards achieving an overall project schedule of 15.5 months between NTP and GCD.
	b.  Revised Exhibit A-1 and Y.

3.  ABB and Enron plan to execute the Letter by May 9, 2001.

I will schedule a team meeting next week to bring everyone up to speed on exactly where we are with other aspects of the project.  Please call me with any questions you might have at x36649.

Peggy - could you please look this over and make sure it looks good to you?  As you can see, we need to get this to Max for David to sign by 3:00pm today.  Here's how the new dates work out:

ABB Guaranteed Completion Date:  July 15, 2002
COD under DeAcero Contract = 502 days from April 6, 2001, or August 21, 2002

Thanks for your help.

Attached are the latest DeAcero docs (clean plus redlined).  I need to have the green light by 3pm today, so that I can send them to David to sign.  He is travelling today, so if we miss him, we'll have to wait until Monday.

Best regards - Max

Please find the following Action Items for the Tech Services team stemming from today's DASH review meeting with L. Kitchen.   Bob V. can you take point on this with  D. Williams.   Mike Coleman attended the meeting in Dan's absence and can provide feedback on some of the technical discussion.

1.	Please develop a project schedule showing the inter-relationship between permitting, engineering, procurement, fabrication, construction and start-up activities.  Key issues include:
	a)	ability to get equipment ordered and delivered given vendor availability
	b)	inter-play between equipment purchasing and off balance sheet financing requirements.
	c)	delay in construction caused by a delay in the air permit
	d)	securing a construction permit - given that site remediation has not been signed off on by the state/city
	e)	construction activities in the winter
	f)	other permits required

2.	Provide a review of the O&M budget and long term performance factors to ensure we are comfortable with cost and plant performance used in the pro forma.

3.	Provide an assessment of the cost/ability to put in place an EPC contract to meet the pro forma assumptions (labor rates in NYC, unions, RAC requirements, etc).


As we have discussed, we need to be proactive in the DASH process and conduct a technical review meeting before the DASH is written and circulated.   This will ensure that we have identified and have addressed/modeled/mitigated/reserved for technical issues before the DASH is submitted to EWS management for signature.  Our Thursday meetings are a perfect platform for getting these issues out on the table.   This did not occur in the case of Brooklyn Navy Yard, and we were left scrambling trying to answer technical questions in respect of the DASH.  Much of the analysis was done, however, we need to present a clear review of technical risks and mitigation impacts of the project.  Failing to do so puts the project at risk and creates doubt that Tech Services has a firm grasp of the Technical Risk in ENA.  If there are issues getting access to information or you are being left out of the technical analysis in compiling the DASH please let me help.

Regards,
Brian

Louise:

You requested that I give you a list of things to avoid discussion with ABB.  We've maintained a reasonably open relationship with ABB up to this point, but here are some (fairly obvious) things that we should probably steer clear of:

1.  No discussion about Fronterra;
2.  No specifics about the DeAcero contract, e.g. extension date, CP's, etc; and
3.  No discussion about project credit issues or financing alternatives for the project.

When this ABB contingent was here last (Feb 2001), Dave and Janet essentially indicated that this was an important project to Enron, that we were entirely committed to seeing it through and that if it weren't for the damn CFE, we'd already be done, etc. etc.  I think if we stick to that line, we'll be fine.

If I think of anything else, I'll let you know ASAP.

Joe Henry and I met with Andrew Kidd and David Field of El Paso today to discuss the timeline and status for the sale of Cornhusker.  Additional topics included the incremental land/option agreement between the project comapny and Tenaska (a potential $7.5 mm deduct from our sales proceeds) and the requirement of El Paso to purchase the "black box" equity to finish their due diligence on the equity and the prior "facilitation process."

SCHEDULE

El Paso will be meeting with Ralph Eads tomorrow afternoon to present a final valuation and risk summary.  After this they will forward over their marked PSA and would like to meet Thursday/Friday to finish the agreement.  After finishing the agreement, the deal will go to El Paso for Capital Review Board and BOD meeting.  We will then have only the "black box" purchase/put timing and HSR to go for closing/funding.

VALUE

David and Andrew pointed out their aggressive discount rate a number of times and point to increasing insurance costs on power facilities as the "90%" driver of a likely decrease in purchase price (our insurance folks can attest to the increase).  El Paso estimates an 8 to 9 mm dollar price reduction from these increased costs.  The latest increase from our insurance was substantial too, but not this high.  We are doing a quick variance on our numbers vs the "sent" model and will match insurance parties at El Paso and Enron today/tomorrow.

El Paso doesn't have any interest in the incremental land/option (nor do we), so Ponderosa is going to sell the project company with the option to Tenaska intact.  This outcome is the lowest legal risk for Enron and almost a "no-cost" alternative which maximises our net cash received from the purchase.

El Paso will assume the Siemens Westinghouse long term service agreement risk and has not asked for an indemnification on the matter.  Hopefully the PSA will match.

FUTURE UPDATES

I will send an update to this same distribution list as frequency demands.  If any of the recipients believe I should include additional people, please email the names back to me.

Thanks,  Chuck Ward

Since you are reading E-mails , I thought I would let you know how things went with Ozzie. I met with him on Saturday and made the proposal we discussed. He said he was interested and wanted to follow up with a conversation on resources and compensation. I would suggest flexibility on compensation and also help in getting additional resources. I would like ,however for Ozzie to recognize that he would be part of the team. This is critical to integrating and optimizing the market /opportunistic approach of the regions with the product approach of Generation Investments. I believe that the synergies(terrible word I'm sorry) here could be substantial. If he wants to be autonomous I don't need him. He said he was meeting with you tomorrow. I'll call you on Monday.

FYI - if you go into "File --> Properties", it shows the author being Jeff Skilling.  Someone obviously has a lot of time on their hands and some eye for morbid detail. I don't know the origins, but obviously, its passed through Cinergy and Tractebel..

Good Morning,

Attached, please find the latest issue of our Independent Power Weekly.

 <<IPW061101.pdf>>

Summary:
1. IPPs Fall 6.9%   Last week we saw continued lackluster performance from
the Independent Power Producers.  Our composite fell 6.9%, underperforming
both the NASDAQ (+3.1%) and the S&P 500 (+0.3).  Mirant, which was down
1.6%, was the strongest performer in the group.  Shaw Group was the weakest
performer, declining by 12.0%.

2. Politics and Price Caps Dominate Investor Attention  In our view, last
week's continued poor stock price performance reflected 2 major issues: 1.
Lingering political uncertainties with increased media attention; and, 2.
Soft spot power market conditions across much of the US.

3. Power Markets Recover on Friday   Importantly, on Friday (6/8), most
regions across the US experienced a significant upturn in power pricing with
forecasts calling for hotter weather.  Trades for Monday delivery, which
took place on Friday, saw price increases of 10-25% on average in the
Eastern and Central regions.  In the Western region, prices spiked up
40-50%.  Should these price increases prove to be sustainable, we would
expect to see a meaningful improvement in investor sentiment.

4. EIX Bankruptcy?  Implications for the IPPs   Recently there has been
increasing speculation that a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing by Southern
California Edison, the utility subsidiary of Edison International, could be
imminent.  We thought it would be timely to analyze the implications of an
SCE bankruptcy for the IPPs.  Our overall conclusion is that an SCE
bankruptcy would be neutral for the sector.  Such an event would have no
impact on the earnings estimates or forecasted growth rates for any of the
companies under our coverage.  In addition, none of the companies have any
direct receivables exposure to SCE.  Finally, we believe reserves taken
against accounts receivable balances from the CalISO and PX across the
sector adequately mitigate exposure to potential bad debt writedowns.

5. Looking Ahead: ORN Analyst Meeting   On Tuesday (6/12), Orion Power will
host its first major analyst meeting since its November 2000 IPO.  Beyond
giving a detailed review of the business, we expect management to discuss
the prospect of future acquisitions.  Recently, management has indicated
that it is evaluating a number of potential transactions located primarily
in the Southeast.  We also expect the company to provide a detailed
regulatory update on its key markets-PJM and NY.  Finally, we expect
management to reaffirm prior guidance for 2001 of $1.15 per share.  While we
believe ORN's exposure to the New York City market offers meaningful upside
potential, we believe the company will continue with its conservative stance
for the year.  Our 2001 and 2002 EPS estimates for ORN remain $1.20 and
1.60.  Our target price is $38.

If possible, I would like to replace myself with another VP (Jean ??).   Rogers told me he would like to stay on the Analyst committee.   Ben Jacoby and Ozzie Pagan are also participants so East Power is well represented in the process.

Can you confirm how many people are attending this meeting from our side.  It seems to be getting a little large and I think we need to make sure we are only bringing people that can add significant value to the actual meeting.

My count is as follows:

Marc Ulrich - URM - He is the commercial expert on ComEd and rate effects on our business - Mandatory
Jeff Merola - Manager of Physical Delivery Logistics for Central Region - mandatory
Brad Snyder - Structured supply 
Mark Bernstein - Structured Supply
Jeff Ader - Structured Supply
Janine Migden - Regulatory
Roy Boston - Regulatory
RogersHerndon - EWS Risk
Name I forgot - Legal - Ulrich recomended he go given the ComEd audience

This would be 9.  I think this is too much.  What are your thoughts?  

Given the agenda items of 1) ComEd PPO phase-out intentions, 2) Physical Delivery Issues and 3) Potential Business Transactions b/w ComEd and Enron, I think we need to trim the list of attendees.

Following the flowchart for power, the Texas gas team feels that EES should handle customers below 1,000 MMBtu/day and EA handles all accounts above that number.

0 to 5 percent.  It would be similar to having the BOD of Enron turning down a project with frevert, kitchen and duran support with a signed dash.  Unless the BOD is planning on a new CEO, this is unlikely to happen.

As a further indication of their confidence, the deal team is spending 3 days in Vail this week, with family, to reccuperate (sp?).

Louise,
 
I spoke with Michael Tribolet re: ring-fencing issue for PG&E.  I don't believe it has been a center stage issues within the PG&E bankruptcy proceeding and I am not sure it will become one. If pursued it would probably be solely for a nuisance factor against PG&E by the creditors.
 
Please note commentary below.  No real new information except that El Paso is eliminating risk with EME.
 
Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.

FYI 


I had an interesting conversation with someone from El Paso who recently left employment at Edison Mission in the UK. El Paso want no exposure at all to EME (even directly with EME) as they are known to have a number of assets up for sale globally and are struggling for liquidity - largely to feed the Californian utility. It seems that, despite their apparent ringfencing from SCE, the chickens are coming home to roost. On top of this, EME are fighting a number of legal battles with uncertain outcomes

With specific reference to First Hydro, a number of parties have expressed an interest in purchasing the FFF assets if the First Hydro assets were thrown in too. We already suspected this but this adds some credence to it. Whilst First Hydro has a lot of value as a going concern, we should not be taking any exposure to the project entity without recourse to the parent and - the message seems - be careful there too. 

Anyway, interesting opinion from the market?.

Louise - some news and views for yourself on this credit.

Hedging this name for any duration past 5 years is all but impossible at present.
Insurance companies will write protection, with 10% first loss being taken by ENE; but proof of loss must exist and all covents must be adhered to otherwise payout can be made void.   Believe the offering you have from Zurich should be used to cover first 35 mil of 65 mil exposure at the front end.   This is the cheapest alternative but does come with certain hindrances; ie timeliness of payments and proof of loss.   An additional constraint here is the BB or better private rating ENE must get for Deacero.

What EnronCredit can offer is to hedge the excess exposure above the insurance coverage.   We would cover failure to pay and bankruptcy of said name.  We would offer protection in either a 2 or 3 year rolling tranche format.    Protection can either be bought for the duration (15yrs NPV) at 3.5%, cash settlement (Louise you get paid out 100- recovery (of financial assets)= payout).  Or on a rolling basis at 30 Bpts over where EnronCreit hedges itself in the market (expect to get 2 yr protection off at 2% per annum at present).    We have the ability to structure this tranche on an accreting or amortising basis to either suit the P95 or actual exposures (payment can be made digital; cost would be stated cost/(1-.35%(expected recovery)).

Louise if you want to call me today to discuss I will be in till 18:00 London time.

Bill, we would hedge out the credit exposure on a 1to1 basis and run the duration risk, require permission from yourself to run/manage this risk.

During our meeting on Loretta (gas play version), you suggested we get a consultant opinion regarding the ability to permit a coal plant in Texas.  I've selected URS, a large, Texas-familiar company.  In fact, their lead air quality attorney used to work on the other side, processing air permit requests for Texas.

I expect a written opinion on Tuesday; however, their verbal feedback has been very favorable.

In the interim, please let me know if you have any questions/comments regarding the proposal.

The following table summarizes the PV quantities associated with the three transportation contracts owned by the Navy Yard.  You may use this number to look at the impact of a 1 cent change in demand rates (unitized) on the value of the transaction.  Because pipeline demand charges do not flow as part of the sales price, an increase in the demand charge will result in a loss to the deal.  

As a reminder, the base valuation makes very reasonable (and conservative) assumptions regarding increases in pipeline demand charges over the term of the deal.

If AEP is still the equity buyer, they have complete control over the "grid=
 curtailment" and associated termination risk in item No. 2 since they are =
the transmission owning utility in the region.

The total EPMI PPA (as of 9/17 COB) value is currently $18.5 million.  My e=
stimate for PPA value erosion for amendments No. 2 and No. 3 is $8-10 milli=
on.   Obviously, the $ erosion value is somewhat subjective, however, the t=
ransmission risk/grid curtailment risk on this project is significant and t=
he termination event for grid curtailment is essential to mitigate what cou=
ld be substantial downside for EPMI.   The reason I had Mike ensure this pr=
ovision was in the current PPA was to shift some of that risk back to Enron=
 Wind and now Enron Wind is trying to push it to the project lenders (who a=

 Kevin,  =20

EWC requires three clarifications to the PPA in order to get the project fi=

ction. =20

I want to make sure you understand how minor these three clarifications are=
.   These clarifications conform to the original deal and are NOT changes t=
o the deal. =20

 1.  Banking Provisions.   EWC and EPMI agreed that energy and renewable en=
ergy credits ("RECS") produced by the Indian Mesa II wind generating facili=
ty in any year in excess of the annual minimum quantity would, on a cumulat=
ive basis, offset any deficiencies of energy and RECS in subsequent years. =
Section 4.04 of the agreement does not clearly provide the cumulative carry=
over mechanism which was contemplated by the parties. (This section origina=
lly provided for the carryover, but in an effort to simplify the language, =
the aggregate carryover concept was clouded.)  Both the project lenders and=
 the proposed equity purchaser have required that the point be clarified.  =
There has never been a disagreement between EPMI and EWC on the intention o=
f the carryover banking provisions. EPMI's most recent refusal to make this=
 clarification now appears to be a change in the original deal

 2.  Grid Curtailment EWC and EPMI  drafted the contract  with specific pro=
visions relating to  termination resulting from grid curtailment, Section 5=
.04  .  There is an ambiguity in that grid curtailment could also be covere=
d  under the termination provision relating  to force majeure under Section=
 5.02.  This  inconsistency is the problem.  Neither EWC nor EPMI were to p=
ay damages to the other party in the event of grid curtailment.  The propos=
ed equity purchasers have requested that the force majeure provisions of  t=
he PPA  be clarified to make it clear that extended grid curtailment would =
not give rise to termination payments.  This clarification is consistent wi=
th the original intent of the parties and is not a change to the deal.

 3.  EPMI Credit Support.  EPMI's obligations under the PPA are guaranteed =
by Enron.  The Indian Mesa II PPA permits EPMI to assign the PPA to certain=
 affiliates without consent of the seller.   Any assignment by EPMI would n=
ot relieve it of its duties and obligations under the contract, and the Enr=
on guarantee would remain in place.  However, the project lenders have requ=
ired clarification that the Enron guarantee would either explicitly remain =
in place or that the assignee would have a credit quality at least as good =
as Enron Corp's credit quality.  The project lender's have also requested t=
hat the termination payment provisions be clarified to provide that any sub=
stitute PPA used to calculate a termination payment would also need to be w=
ith a party that had a credit quality similar to Enron Corp's, since that i=
s the credit that is supporting the Indian Mesa II PPA.  This will not affe=
ct the value of the contract to a third party since Enron bears this obliga=
tion unless released by the project.

Under the dispute resolution provisions of the PPA we could certainly pursu=
e declaratory relief under arbitration.  Our sense is that this does nothin=
g but ensure delay.

 From an Enron perspective:

     The sale of the equity and the financing of the non-recourse debt on t=
he Indian Mesa II project is currently at a standstill due to issues surrou=
nding the ambiguities in the PPA

      While the debt financing for the Indian Mesa I project is in place (d=
ifferent offtaker) the proposed equity sale to AEP is linked to the sale of=
 the Indian Mesa II project.

     If Enron cannot move forward with the financing of the project within =
the next month, Enron will likely end up with approximately $153M less cash=
 at year end than it counted on in its plan, in addition to any decrease in=
 planned earnings

    The after-tax return to Enron in a "hold" situation is 0%, due to Enron=
 being in the Alternative Minimum Tax position, i.e. it cannot use the tax =
benefits.

It was clear in the discussions with the City of San Antonio that these cla=
rifications would have had no affect on value.  =20

I would like to make the message even more clear.  EPMI will not be making =
any changes, amendments, clarifications, interpretations, etc. to the curre=
nt Indian Mesa II PPA.   Therefore, any proposed purchaser of the Indian Me=
sa facility must evaluate the contract based on their own legal and commerc=
ial interpretation.
=20
I don't think it is productive to spend any more time on this discussion.  =
 We will continue provide Enron Wind with the PPA value on a daily basis su=
ch that total shareholder value is maximized for any proposed wind transact=
ion (sale of company and/or sale of IM project).
=20
Please feel free to call me to discuss (713-853-5035)

We are not interested in these changes to the PPA.  These changes will weak=
en the language in the contract for us (i.e. improve it for AEP that is pro=
bably why they are asking for the "clarifications").  I will be out next we=
ek on vacation so please address any further concerns in my absence to Kevi=

Mike:  Attached is our proposed amendment to the Indian Mesa II PPA.  It de=
als with the banking clarification (section 4.04 amendments), grid curtailm=
ent clarification (section 5.02 amendments), guaranty clarifications reques=
ted by the lenders (section 5.05 and 9.03 amendments), and the  ERCOT amend=
ment (section 3.04 amendments) that we have discussed.  Please note that th=
e ERCOT restriction would permit international sales, such as to Mexico, bu=
t would otherwise restrict EPMI's sales of energy from the wind facility to=
 other locations within ERCOT.  In the preparation of this draft, we used t=
he same amendment that was previously sent to you by e-mail on 8/22/01.  Th=
at e-mail had a redline with it to show the changes to the banking provisio=
ns.  Please let us know whether this draft is acceptable or whether you hav=
e any questions or comments on the amendment.  Thanks
