For immediate release: October 3, 2001

                                 Energy Commission Auction Increases
                                    California's Yield of Green Power


Sacramento - Nine more new renewable power plants -- with a combined production capacity of 300 megawatts for California's electricity market --
emerged as the successful bidders in a financial incentives auction conducted recently by the California Energy Commission.

The projects include a 30-megawatt facility powered by used tires in Imperial County, a 21-megawatt small hydroelectric plant in El Dorado County
and seven wind projects with a total generation of 249 megawatts. The wind projects are located in four sites in Kern county and one each in Alameda,
Palm Springs and Solano Counties.

Target on-line dates for the new plants range from February to December of next year.

"These new projects represent an important step towards Governor Davis' goal to increase California's yield of electricity from renewables from 12
percent today to 17 percent by 2006," said Commissioner Michal (spelling correct) Moore. "We're very pleased that this auction was a success," said
Moore, the chair of the Commission's Electricity and Natural Gas Committee.

The auction was the third of its kind conducted by the Commission's Renewable Energy Program. Successful bidders will receive incentive payments
of up to 1.5 cents for every kilowatt-hour of renewable electricity they generate, and incentives are paid for the first five years of project operation.

As in the two previous actions, bidders submitted the cents per kilowatt-hour incentive they wished to receive, along with an estimate of their first five
years of generation. To qualify for funding, projects had to be located in California and produce renewable electricity for sale, not just for on-site use.
Bids were accepted from the lowest incentive to the highest, until the available funds were exhausted.

Previous auctions held in June 1998 and November 2000 resulted in awards of more than $200 million for 1000 megawatts of new renewable
generating capacity. Successful projects receive production incentives for five years once they are on-line and producing electricity.

Eligible "green" technologies are biomass, digester gas, geothermal, landfill gas, photovoltaics, small hydroelectric (30 megawatts or less), solar
thermal electric, waste tire, and wind. Of the 72 successful projects from the first two auctions, 35 projects totaling more than 200 megawatts have
been completed and are delivering electricity to the grid.

Results of the third auction can be found on the Commission's Web site at: www.energy.ca.gov/contracts <http://www.energy.ca.gov/contracts>. Information regarding the Commission's
Renewable Energy Program is available at: www.energy.ca.gov/renewables <http://www.energy.ca.gov/renewables>.

     INDUSTRY REPORT
     ---------------


                  UCS Report Highlights Importance of RPS

     The Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) recently released a report
     showing how a diversified electricity mix including 20 percent
     renewable energy could save California consumers up to $1.8 billion
     and alleviate the disruptions in energy supply that have plagued
     Californians during the summer months.  The report, titled "Powering
     Ahead," analyzes the economic impacts of the renewable portfolio
     standard (RPS) in California.  Over 95 percent of California's
     current contracts for future energy production are committed to
     natural gas.

     Although the California state assembly was expected to consider RPS
     legislation this past week, action has been postponed until the
     weekend when the legislators are scheduled to complete this year's
     work.

     "California has experienced first-hand the dangers of a market
     dominated by volatile fossil fuels," said UCS senior analyst and
     report author Deborah Donovan.  "Now we have the hard numbers to
     prove renewable energy is beneficial for California's economic
     health."

     The state of Texas has implemented the most successful RPS to date,
     where requirements for new renewable generation capacity have been
     set high enough to create a strong market for renewable project
     development.  Natural gas prices in California have been extremely
     volatile with price hikes 10 to 20 times the historical average last
     year.

     However, in California the Department of Water Resources, which buys
     power for the state, uses a formula that makes it difficult for wind
     power to participate in the market and that has stunted investment
     in new wind power projects.

     UCS said that RPS are designed to help alleviate some of the burden
     created by state-by-state legislation which creates hurdles for the
     widespread adoption of renewable energies.  Additionally, RPS
     provides for the preservation of state jurisdiction over energy
     while making it easier for renewable energy technologies to
     penetrate the market.

                DOE Awards Funds for Bioenergy Development

     The Department of Energy (DOE) recently announced that it will
     invest $30 million over the next three to five years in 11 projects
     intended to develop process technology to create various products
     using plant matter and other natural waste materials.  Funds will
     also be used to establish university education and training programs
     in the area of bioproducts.

     "Producing marketable industrial products out of plants saves
     energy, saves nonrenewable resources and creates jobs," said DOE
     secretary Spencer Abraham.  "The bioenergy and bioproducts fields
     hold tremendous potential for environmentally desirable
     manufacturing and the creation of new jobs in the farm belt."

     DOE said it will provide $5 million for a project to develop the
     collection, commercial processing and utilization of corn stover.
     Partners in the project include Biomass Agri-Products, Iowa State
     University, Midwest Labs and Cargill Dow.  Private funding for
     the project will be $5 million.

     The agency noted that three education grants were awarded to
     establish multi-disciplinary education and training for graduate
     students in the area of bioproducts technologies.  The grants will
     help fund the establishment of "cross-cutting multi-disciplinary
     academic and research programs and provide stipends for deserving
     graduate students."

     DOE will also provide $7.3 million for a project focused on biomass
     biorefinery for production of polymers and fuel.  Partners in the
     project include Metabolix, Inc., the University of Tennessee,
     the University of Central Florida and the University of
     Massachusetts.

              BEF Grant Brings Solar Energy to Orcas Island

     The Bonneville Environmental Foundation (BEF) recently announced
     that it has provided a grant to help add four new solar sites to the
     Orcas Power and Light Cooperative (OPALCO) Green Power program
     headquartered in Friday Harbor, WA.

     The $37,000 provided by BEF enabled OPALCO to install solar panels
     at the Windermere Real Estate Building in Eastsound, WA, the Lopez
     (Island) Community Center, the Westsound Marina and the OPALCO
     office.  This combination of utility-owned and privately-owned sites
     will contribute an estimated 5,200 kilowatt hours (kWh) of
     electricity a year into the electricity grid, producing energy that
     is "natural and pollution-free" while helping the islands served by
     OPALCO to become more self sufficient.

     "The regional interest in solar energy has quickened considerably
     since BEF opened its doors in 1999," said BEF president Angus
     Duncan.  "OPALCO members have been among the first to show a high
     level of interest in power that is non-polluting."

     BEF said it is funding watershed projects that use solar power to
     pump water for cattle and irrigation while protecting streams. The
     group was founded in 1998 to fund new renewable energy resources and
     watershed restoration projects.  Although BEF maintains a strong
     collaborative relationship with the Bonneville Power
     Administration, they are separate organizations.

Let me know what you think:
=20
Enron would like to compliment staff on their recommendations for the discl=
osure label calculations and offer one suggestion that would accommodate th=
e purchase of clean, renewable resources.  As noted in our prior comment, w=
e would like to reiterate the need for a methodology that recognized attrib=
ute contracts.  It is a growing practice to contract for the renewable or c=
lean attributes of energy that have been generated onto the grid without pu=
rchasing the actual commodity power.  These attributes are typically referr=
ed to as certificates, "green tags" or "renewable energy credits".  All of =
these terms refer to the environmental benefits of clean power that have be=
en generated onto the grid and may be traded, bought and sold separately fr=
om the underlying power commodity.  The ability to separate the attributes =
from the underlying power facilitates the ability for suppliers to offer cl=
ean renewable power in regions where it might not be conducive to site thes=
e resources.   The supplier can then pair the attributes with system power =
at the point of sale to Michigan customers.
=20
This methodology greatly decreases the administrative reporting burden for =
suppliers and also provides a cost-effective form of verification for Commi=
ssion staff.  Our specific recommendations for accounting for certificates =
are as follows.=20
1. Allow suppliers to account for attribute purchases on their fuel labels =
by providing proper substantiation that the supplier owns the attributes.  =
Substantiation can be in the form of verification from an independent syste=
m operator of an attribute registry (e.g. Automated Power Exchange operatin=
g in California and the Midwest and recently awarded the contract for NePoo=
l to build their certificate based system; ERCOT) that the supplier has pur=
chased the certificate and retired it on the behalf of the customer; a bila=
teral contract showing that the attributes are owned by the supplier, or an=
y other method deemed appropriate by the Commission.
2. Suppliers can use the generation data from certificates that have been g=
enerated by independent certificate system administrators or generators to =
calculate the fuel type and emissions.   The certificate purchases would be=
 weighed with other bilateral contracts and spot market purchases for purpo=
ses of calculating the label.
3.  In the event that the emissions data are not provided by the generator,=
 suppliers will be able to use the most recent E-grid data to calculate the=
 emissions.
=20
There are several examples from other State Commissions for accounting for =
certificates purchases.  The following link shows the methodology that the =
Texas Public Utility Staff wrote for calculating labels with certificate pu=
rchases.  <http://www.puc.state.tx.us/rules/rulemake/22816/22816.cfm>
=20
This modification to the label calculation will allow suppliers who are pur=
chasing affordable clean to be delivered to the grid on behalf of their cus=
tomers through certificate contracts to depict this on their fuel content l=
abel.  We appreciate your review of our comments.

Richard,

Attached are the reports for EES and EEMC.  I have added the July's purchases we removed from last month's report.

I am waiting to get EEMC's sales figures.  Did you receive the BizMix and Fetzer reports from Annette Tafallo last month?  I have left her several phone messages and she has not returned my call.

Subject:	EES env product strategy mtg

All - 
Lianne Lami and I would like to see if you all are available on Friday at 2:00 CDT to discuss potential EES environmental product offerings.   I believe that either Lianne or I (or both) have talked to you individually about the effort to roll out environmental products -- except for perhaps Jeff.  We'd like to have your participation,  Jeff, in regards to the load curtailment product offerings you are working on, and how this might fit with other offerings such as renewable energy certificates and tradable efficiency certificates (negawatts).
 
The strategy meeting should last about an 1 and 1/2 to 2 hours, and will be a chance to pool our respective resources to see what type of environmental product offerings we can create.  I'll gladly get us a team room on 47.  Please let me know if you're available.  Heather, I was planning to call you and hook you in.
 
Regards,
Stacey Bolton

As you all know, I participated in the advisory committee that helped draft the "draft" MA RPS regs.   Our group finished the process about a year ago.  Since that time, the DOER has been working with the Gov's office on the language.  National Grid has caused some "stink" over the last month regarding their obligation to comply.  I've not yet had a chance to review the attached draft, but hopefully it did not stray too far from the original draft.  I'll give you comments and impact by the end of the week.  The MA RPS will go into effect in 2003.

Monthly bills in the range of under 1,000 dollars a month.

Kinko's wants their pricing refreshed for their Reliant and TXU sites only.
I need to know the fixed $MWh price if we assume a 50% renewable product in TXU
and a 100% renewable product in Reliant's service area.
I am trying to fill out the attached template that Larry sent to me with my gen only price refreshed,
some Price to beat estimates I ran for him and your new renewable power quotes.
Thanks

That is my understanding.  The new label has been forwarded to Jennifer Hillegonds, Marianne Castano, Heather Mathis and Sarah Dietrich.  They are working to make sure the correct label is distributed with the proper product.  Thanks for your help.  SC

I will make the assumption that the "Revised Disclosure Label" will be
attached to the appropriate MA contract forms.

I just received a call from Richard Ring with new system power #'s on the
MA label.  Sarah -- I think we've blown by your deadline to make changes,
but attached is the most recent form.  We also tweaked the emissions graph
to show the bar chart lines even with system power.

Jennifer -- I owe you a label for the mid-market physical product and will
get that to you shortly.

Yikes....hope you are surviving!  You'll need coffee after this product lau=
nch.  Here's the lowdown w/ labels in TX.  Your 1st label will be a project=
ion or guestimation of what you anticipate delivering to customers.  I'd ge=
t w/ Richard Ring on the desk (under Rogers Herndon) to verify that you guy=
s will only be purchasing system mix.  You might already have done so.  On =
the fuel mix label (do you have a copy?....I'm attaching if you do not), re=
place the heading "Sources of power generation" with "Projected sources of =
power generation".  Same w/ emissions....replace "emissions and waste per k=
Wh generated" with "projected emissions and waste per kWh generated".  EES =
must then practice "due diligence" in its acquisition of power to ensure yo=
ur projection is as close as possible to your actual.  You will change to h=
istorical data on the label after one year (12/31/02).  You have some leewa=
y during the pilot as the final label calculation rule has not been adopted=
 yet -- though it is unlikely that these requirements will change.
=20
I must get in one other plug.  You might seriously want to consider a green=
 product option.  In Texas, we have a system by which it is more cost-effec=
tive to purchase renewable power.  That is how entities such as Green Mount=
ain (label attached below) have been able to launch a 100% wind product.  R=
eliant (label attached below) is offering a 100% green product in TXU's ter=
ritory for only 1 cent more per kWH.  Reliant's offering is for residential=
 only.  EPMI and Enron Wind have 135 MW wind facility and you might want to=
 price a premium option for the smaller commodity customers from this facil=
ity or from the market in general. I am GLAD to hook you up with the intern=
al folks that can help you w/ purchases for renewable energy.  We're having=
 a meeting on Thursday from 12-3 to discuss renewable origination and tradi=
ng opportunities in EB 8c1 if you can tear away.  Lunch will be served.  Le=

Heather,

EESI only deliveres physical energy to customers in Ohio behind "First Energy" and only through the "MSG" program.  There should be no difference between the "projected" and "actual" labels for Columbus Southern.

June 1 is fast approaching, and as I understand it, we are responsible for providing actual versus projected label information in the state of Ohio.  I know that the projected labels have been completed, and now I must gather the actual information for first quarter of 2001.  It is my understanding that FE/MSG will be providing us this information on actuals for the customers we have there, but who provides the info for Columbus Southern?  If I am incorrect in any of these assumptions, please let me know.  Thank you for your assistance on this matter.

Here's a first shot at a product description for RECs with the type of layout I thought might work. Please send suggestions. Richard, clearly we have some work to do on pricing. Also, what are the logical geographical divisions? Do you agree with my NERC region distinction?

Richard it appears there was more than one day of generation however, only one day produce dollars.  I am going to forward this on the Riverside to see if they agree to the statement forwarded by EPMI.  If you have any reservation about me forwarding this please let me know.

Thanks,

Hi Richard,

I am emailing you a spreadsheet that summarizes the generation information that we have recorded for the Monthly Performance Reports that listed generation produced in 2000. The spreadsheet that has the information is titled "Facility Breakdown". Please feel free to call or email me if you have any questions regarding the data. 

If your records do not match the information provided, please let me know as soon as possible so that we can resolve the discrepancy. Thank you for your time and assistance.

Elliot,

I spoke with Rogers about the renewables function within EES Risk Management.  It seems as though Richard Ring has a clear mandate to set up a book and cover the short positions in the East.  It sounds like our EES position in the West is more manageable (slightly long).  Rogers and I agreed that you and Richard should work together to the extent it makes sense, but there is no pressing need to try to re-org anything at this time - this can be adressed at year-end or Q1.  In general, your objectives should be to try to transact through EES or with wholesale parties.  Rogers is focused on covering his short position so I think there is an orig opportunity for you if you can procure tags that can be used in the East.       

Tim or Elliot let me know if you want to discuss further.

My only concern with tailoring these is is anyone keeping track of which customers are getting which labels?  When we send out quarterly labels we would need to have some way to indicate to CSC which is which - and I presume their databases could handle this, but who knows how long it would take them to tweak it.

Subject:	MA disclosure label for mid-market physical product (with price variability)


Jennifer --

Attached is a MA disclosure label tailored for the mid-market physical product with price variability (excess and deficiency usage bands).  The only difference between this label and the label distributed for the direct mini product is language in the "Generation Price" section.   If average prices vary by volume of sales (as I understand the mid-market product does), the MA rules require a verbatim statement on the label as follows:

"Your average generation charge is based on the terms of the Agreement.  As the Rules require, the information provided above is the average price per kWh for EESI customers for the last month of the prior quarter."

The direct mini form, in contrast, did not require this language as it was a fixed price product with no price variability.  The attached incorporates the updates to system resource mix that I just received from Richard Ring this morning and the updated emissions chart (formatting only).

Let me know if you have any questions.

Subject:=09CA BIZMIX Issues

Hello all!

I met with Diann Huddleson today and she clarified some issues for me regar=
ding the DASRing of customers in California.  Unfortunately it wasn't what =
we wanted to hear.

On the easy side of things, all residential customers (PGE, SCE, SDG&E) wer=
e turned back to the utilities starting May 30th (DASRs were submitted and =
they are cycling off now depending upon meter reading cycles, etc.)  These =
customers received a letter letting them know about it.

On the commercial side of things (Diann had no distinctions between small c=
ommercial & large commercial & industrial customers), SDG&E customers have =
been ours all along and have never been DASRed and reDASRed.  In PGE & SCE,=
 IBM behind PGE was also never put through the DASR process and has continu=
ously received our product.  All other PGE & SCE customers were originally =
submitted for DASRing back to the utilities on - January 31!!!!!  That prov=
ides enough issues of its own, but I'll get to that.  PGE did a virtual swi=
tch so as of Jan 31 all these customers became PGE's again, but with SCE, w=
hen a customer was switched depending upon meter reading cycles, etc.  All =
de-DASRed customers were then re-DASRed back to us starting June 21, and Di=
ann indicated that not only all of our old customers were re-DASRed, but ne=
w contracts were being executed and these new customers were also being DAS=
Red to us.  No communication about all of this has been sent to the custome=
rs, but as we discussed, some personal basis notice may have been given to =
our larger customers through the reps.

So - I'm not worried about the residential side - we'll have to send them a=
n annual historical label next April (with perhaps a letter explaining why =
they're still receiving info from us).  As far as the commercial/industrial=
 .......

1.  No notice was provided to probably the majority of the customers. [Bolt=
on, Stacey]  We (or PR) should prepare a customer letter as discussed with =
Peggy, notifying them that they are no longer receiving Bizmix ASAP.
2.  They've been receiving system mix since Feb 1 and we've been proceeding=
 as if it were actually BIZMIX - i.e. the 2nd quarter labels they just rece=
ived indicated BIZMIX, as appropriate to the customer. [Bolton, Stacey]   W=
e should look into purchasing green tags to make these customers whole if w=
e will be more than 5% off of our projection v. what we actually delivered.=
  The regs allow for discrepancies between projections and actual, and you =
don't have to show an extra column w/ the difference if you are w/in 5% del=
ta band between projection and actual..  We can change the projection for t=
hird quarter and include this information in the customer letter.=20
3.  What are the new customers (those as being DASRed to us the first time =
as of June 21) being told they are receiving?  Are they being marketed BIZM=
IX? [Bolton, Stacey]   We should ensure this is not the case with originati=
on.  Someone in Jeremy B.'s shop will most likely know.=20
4.  As far as dates are concerned for reporting purposes, will we just use =
those given as the date of submission (i.e. Jan 31, May 30, June 21) as it =
is impossible to pinpoint when each individual customer transferred? [Bolto=
n, Stacey]   We should discuss this a bit.  I'm not sure that this will rea=
lly matter at the end of the day.  The CEC has instructed us all along to s=
end labels to the customers, which we have.  We'll report the purchases (br=
own and green) as normal at the end of the year.=20

Let me know your input.

Heather

Hey gang,

We are making solid progress on a number of fronts. From a 10,000 foot pers=
pective, our main goal is to pull together all of the systems, curves, prod=
uct descriptions/offerings, internal communications, and external communica=
tions of a fully functional business unit for presentation to Belden, Richt=
er, Herndon and Presto by November 15. This morning, I spoke with Juli Salv=
agio who manages marketing for Enron Wholesale about getting the Renewable =
Power Desk space on the enron.com website. Take a look at the products and =
services offerings section of enron.com, and check out emissions trading or=
 weather derivatives. The goal is to draft language (with photos -- ideas??=
) for an RPD site along those same lines. I will take an initial shot at th=
e language (with a fundamental breakdown between wholesale and retail servi=
ces) and then send around drafts for your comment the week of October 24.  =
I think we will be listed under the heading "Renewable Power Marketing" or =
"Green Power Marketing" (Which do you think is better?)=20

On other fronts:

Team Fundies is cranking along well.
Richard and I are working to clean up all of our existing positions (scrubb=
ing old EES contracts, managing inter-book issues so that any existing gree=
n tag positions fall out to the Green Desk).
Our Product Description has been professionalized by Enron Counsel (Richard=
 Ring) and we are talking to wind, biomass, landfill and geothermal develop=
ers with good offers on tags.
We are working with EWS counsel and EES counsel to prepare a formal green t=
ag contract that can be attached to either a standard EWC commodity contrac=
t or an EES commodity contract.
Stacey is roaming the country making the world safe for Green Tag trading -=
- she is preparing a regional summary of green tag/Green issues/protocols.
We continue to negotiate with LADWP for a services contract for their new r=
enewable resources.
I haven't heard back from all of you on the proposed offsite location/dates=
.

Greetings all --
Given my rather other-world state on yesterday's conference call, I wanted =
to fire off an e-mail to you to summarize current commercial activities on =
the Renewable Power Desk. I appreciate all the work you guys are doing and =
feel as though we're really gaining some traction.

Green Power Market Development Group -- We will be submitting a proposal to=
 the Wind Energy Working Group of the Green Power Market Development Group =
(headed by Mark Crowdis of Think Energy) on Tuesday with a variety of prici=
ng proposals for products ranging from physical commodity with green tags t=

 to develop pricing for tags in the Pac Northwest, California, Texas and th=

guys as they are feeling the heat to do something concrete after making so =
many public declarations of intent. As we move forward, I think we should a=
ll do a lot of thinking about other companies we should approach for this t=
ype of product. Once the Enron Building is juiced with wind power, we will =
be able to approach other fortune 500 companies with a straight face and en=
courage them to become Green Power Alliance Customers. During the week of S=

Renewable Portfolio Standard -- The proposed CA RPS has major implications =

will probably satisfy their requirement with their new renewables purchases=
. If the utilities end up serving load, they will be in the market looking =
for the least-cost resources, and new biomass will clearly be a part of the=
 mix.

Pac Northwest RFPs -- Both PacifiCorp and Portland General Electric have RF=

Chicago -- Most of you probably met Mike Lindert at our Houston Renewables =

I believe this question was covered in our call just now.  For repetitive purpose....reduce quarterly label projection from 17 to 15%.  Ensure the bills and footnote do not reference any customer credit money for purchases of renewable.  

As for the residentials....no label.  If we turned them all back, that is the utilities' responsibility.  We will need to send them an annual label for the portion of the year we delivered to them.

Have a great time in Vegas. VIVA!

Thanks so much for confirming the info in general on the labels.  It's nice to confirm with someone else that indeed we're interpreting stuff the same way.  Below is my only other question on labels for now - I need to get California's labels to CSC by the 10th.

Thanks again!!!

Subject:	CA Labels

It's that time of year again - sending out 3rd quarter labels to California.  Richard & I were talking this morning and had several questions.

First - how do we reflect to our customers that used to receive BIZMIX (large commercials) in their projected labels that for the first month of the year (according to Diann Hudleston they were initially de-DASRed on Jan 31) they received the BIZMIX fuel mix and for the rest of the year the system mix?  Do we need to do a label showing a column for the Jan mix and a column for the rest of year mix with a footnote?  Additionally, has Peggy Mahoney's letter gone out yet?  I'd hate for a notation on a label to be the first thing a customer sees about this.  There is a bit of time, however, as these will go out in the October billing cycle (CSC has to have them 9/10).

Second - We returned our residential customers to the utilities the end of June.  Do we still need to send them a projected 2001 label in 3rd & 4th quarters since we did not provide their electricity during those periods?  I presume we will, however, have to send them a historical 2001 label next spring, since we did provide their electricity for at least first half of the year.

Thanks.

Heather

Elliot:

I spoke with Patagonia this morning.  They are interested in rolling the
renewable purchases out to all US stores (12 new facilities) and possibly
blending and extending the commodity portion of their purchases in
California across as many stores as possible.

Here are my notes on what we talked about on the latest telephone call.

There was no definitive talk about deal structures but that will be coming
up shortly.  Patagonia is looking for savings and renewable energy.  I
introduced risk management instead of savings and it was well received but
will require more clarification as we move forward.

 <<Green Ticket swap pitch.doc>>

I spoke with the Director of Retail and will be speaking with the VP of
environmental programs to gather more information on the structures that
they would like to see.

I spoke with the Account Manager/Service Manager for Fetzer Vineyards and
she said that they are interested in new renewable products as well.  She
asked to listen in on our call on 6/18/01.  She is in San Ramon and her name
is Renee Fernandez.  I have met the customer and would like to move ahead
with a meeting to get this customer on board as well.

Contact me if you have any questions.

If I remember correctly, the volumes were equivalent to something like .5MW. Sort of off our radar screen, and now that EPMI no longer has its TX tag position, hard to believe that we'd be the low-cost bid. Have you come across anything on the supply side in NV? Jesse, can you check once again with Foster and see if any of his Cali biomass guys have NV positions?

Richard - I will need your help on responding to this request- there are a lot of questions
I cannot field. I can provide the fixed gen pricing for the building with LF 65%, however all 
the other questions center around renewable questions. You will need to take lead on majority.
John McCarthy works in EES and prepares formal responses to inquiries of this nature
If you can help him with those questions, he is very quick at putting the general info needed on Enron
together and putting in a nice binded document with very speedy turnaround
Let me know how you want to proceed- it's due 11/9

Kathleen Croissett, Enron Wind Development Company, had contacted me asking me whether or not the agreement(s) were terminated.  EESI did not terminate the agreement(s) and EESI had not received any termination notices from Green Power Partners which is why I was trying to find out from you what you knew regarding the delivery of power from such facilities.

Late Friday I received a call from Lisa Pitts, Enron Wind Development Corp, however she did particularly say what she wanted.  I did leave a voice mail message for Lisa Pitts, however as of yet have not received a call back from her.

Stacey,

Below is my response to the Texas Kinko's contract.  Let me know what you t=
hink.

Thanks,

Richard




Paul,

I am not sure how the various sections align between the "second contract v=
ersion", from Wednesday's meeting with Kinko's, and the "Master Agreement" =
however I will take my best shot at the "renewable language".

Under Section 1, 1.1 SCOPE, the current language states "EESI will ensure t=
hat the Energy delivered to Customer will be associated with the generation=
 of an equivalent amount of renewable energy registered to the Customer, an=
d all the environmental attributes associated with the generation of this r=
enewable energy will be the sole possession of the Customer."

My concern here with the way that the language is currently worded revolves=
 around the portion of the sentence regarding "all the environmental attrib=
utes".  I do not want to be obligated to provide "all the environmental att=
ributes" to Customer if either (i) Enron does not acquire all of the enviro=
nmental attributes it its transaction to acquire the "renewable energy and/=
or renewable credits/attributes" or (ii) as normal course of business regar=
ding transaction of "renewable energy and/or renewable credits/attributes" =
all of the environmental attributes do not transfer with title to the "rene=
wable energy and/or renewable credits/attributes".

I would propose to replace the above referenced contract language with the =
following:  "EESI will ensure that the Energy delivered to Customer will be=
 associated with generation of an equivalent amount of renewable energy and=
 that all of the environmental attributes, as a normal course of business, =
associated with the purchase and sale of renewable energy and/or renewable =
credits shall pass from EESI to Customer."  =20

Under Section 7, DEFINITIONS, the current definition for "Renewable Energy"=
 states "means electric energy generated by facilities utilizing renewable =
energy sources.  This would include facilities like windmill farms, photovo=
ltaic cells, geothermal heat recovery plants, landfill gas recover plants, =
and small, selective hydroelectric projects no greater than 20 MW.  These f=
acilities use existing natural systems (wind, sun, thermal heat from the ea=
rth, biological decomposition and flowing water) to generate their electric=
ity."

I would propose to not hard code the definition for "Renewable Energy" into=
 the "Master Agreement" but rather define "Renewable Energy" for each "Tran=
saction Agreement" under the Master Agreement".  For the "Master Agreement"=
 delete the definition of "Renewable Energy" and replace with the following=
:  "Renewable Energy" shall have the meaning ascribed in the Transaction Ag=
reement to this Master Agreement."=20

I would propose that the definition of "Renewable Energy" for purposes of t=
he Transaction Agreement relative to Kinko's Texas Sites should be the foll=
owing:  "Renewable Energy" means renewable energy credit which represents r=
enewable energy that is physically metered and verified in the State of Tex=
as.  Renewable energy credits in the State of Texas are derived from techno=
logy that exclusively relies on an energy source that is naturally regenera=
ted over a short time and derived directly from the sun, indirectly from th=
e sun, or from moving water or other natural movements and mechanisms of th=
e environment and include the following:  sun, wind, geothermal, hydroelect=
ric, wave or tidal energy, biomass or biomass waste products, including lan=
dfill gas, and any other source that does ont rely on energy resources deri=
ved from fossil fuels, waste products from fossil fuels, or waste products =
from inorganic sources.  For purpose of this Transaction Agreement EESI wil=
l fulfill the renewable energy requirement  exclusively from one hundred pe=
rcent (100%) wind sources generated within the State of Texas and verified =

Richard,

I forgot one conversion:  To convert from MT of CO2, multiply by 1.1.02 to =
get to tons of CO2.  (The trees planted and miles driven are based on tons =
of CO2.)

Also, Catherine McKalip-Thompson is working on a spreadsheet with several c=
onversions that might be helpful to you.  It should be complete in the next=
 day or so.  While it might be too late for the letter going out this week,=
 it may be useful to keep in your files for future reference.

Thanks,
Heather

Richard,

The California CO2 emissions factor is 0.343 MT CO2/MWh.  The source is bel=
ow.  As I mentioned during our phone call, there is some debate over the ap=
propriate emissions factor to use, given emission differences between peak/=
off-peak utility generation vs. purchases, etc.  However, most groups accep=
t state level emissions factors as the best available.  Also, it is my unde=
rstanding that the emissions factors are supposed to be revised sometime du=
ring 2000.  However, I haven't seen any announcements regarding the release=
 of new numbers, nor did I see mention of it on the DOE Voluntary Reporting=
 website.

 << OLE Object: Picture (Metafile) >>=20

I found a page on the Green Mountain web site that has conversions for tree=
s planted and miles driven.  While it does not list a source for the conver=
sions, I did notice that the numbers are the same as the ones used by the E=
nvironmental Law and Policy Center.  I will bring a copy of both by your de=
sk.  Let me know if I can help with anything else.  FYI, in the past I've b=
een a little hesitant to express GHG savings in terms of number of trees pl=

Thanks for the information.  It sounds as if EESI is not interested in "any" Federal Government business, therefore we will not respond.

Subject: PJM Mtg Recap


All - 
 
Wanted to briefly recap yesterday's meeting at PJM.  Our stated coalition goal going in to the meeting was to ensure the recognition of certificates (or financial commodities representing the attributes of energy) and capability with system New England is developing.  While phase I will not meet either goal, PJM readily admits that there are adaptations that need to be made to the system that meet our goals for Phase II of the program.  To this end, a users' group was establish.  I've listed highlights of the meeting and next steps below.   The formation of this group is a VERY positive step in moving toward a system that will most effectively meet our goals.  Finally, I'm attaching a list of the meeting attendees.  Let me know if you have any questions.  I'm encouraged by these developments, and once again would like to thank all of you for your support and teamwork on this crucial issue to all of our companies/organizations.
 
Highlights of Meeting:

Regulatory update: Regulators all expressed interest in hearing from stakeholders on Phase II of PJM GATS system.  In particular, Linda Nowiki from NJ BPU noted that because of the considerable change of the Board composition since the adoption of the disclosure rules, the upcoming expansion to 5 Commissioners and a likely new Board President, and the RTO proceedings that they were particularly interested in stakeholder feedback for the GATS system.

Phase I: operational by end of year and will produce company labels comprised of an aggregation of the load purchased.  Phase I is based on a mathematical formula, and will aggregate all fuel sources by company (not product).  The limitations include: an inability to carve out dedicated resources (such as a specific hydro purchase from a company's system); the inability to get to the plant level detail (unit only); the inability to segment the company fuel and emissions label into products; the emissions data (taken from EGrid) being dated and not accommodating recent emissions reductions based on retrofits or installed control technologies; and the inability to distinguish whether the unit meets class I or class II RPS.  PJM plans to distribute the first set of labels to LSEs and regulators, but realizes the data on the labels (due to the inabilities) will not be useful.

Phase II: John Dadorian, project lead for GATS program, has toyed with several conceptual ideas for Phase II.  The goal is to have the system operational by March '03 -- in time for the label distribution period for both NJ and MD.  John wants Phase II to be web-based, with suppliers/generators/marketers having access to their data.   John had one scenario that he presented whereby PJM would track, by contract path, the fuel and emissions mix of suppliers.  After a specified time period, PJM would submit preliminary labels to suppliers.  Suppliers would then have a choice of modifying their label based on trading attributes.  PJM has not made any decisions about Phase II and is looking to members for comment.  to this end, they suggested forming a user's group.

Formation of a user's group to address Phase II Conceptual Design and Implementation:  Enron, PG&E NEG, Hydro Quebec, PSEG and New Power made up the 5 needed members to start the group.  The user's group is NOT limited to PJM members, and a sign up sheet was distributed.  This user's group will be announced at the next PJM meeting on November 12th.  The first meeting of our user's group will be held in Wilmington, DE on Thursday 11/15.  Details will be circulated.

 Comment Period:  Comments are due by October 19th to John Dadorian on Phase I.  Since these labels are basically not going to have any "purpose" because the data will be useless, I don't know if it's worth the effort to submit comments.  I think our focus should be on Phase II.  Please let me know your thoughts.

 
NEXT STEPS:
While it is VERY positive that we have formed a user's group to vet these issues, it's clear that we still have considerable work to do.  Denise Foster from PJM will be establishing a list serve for us to circulate ideas/issues/concerns prior to the meeting.  The meeting participants briefly discussed items for our first meeting, including: 

Guidelines for scope of group 
Identifying Timeline and Milestones (target completion date is March '02) 
Matrix of State Requirements (to be done ahead of time) 
Identifying Design issues 
    Capability with New England/New York 
    Accommodating financial transactions or certificates 
Concerns 
    Identifying "true fuel mix" v. residual average 
    How many entities would participate in a certificate market 
    Treatment of unsold certificates 
    Whether to have the ability to trade financially through settlement and have it recognized by PJM's system 
Questions: 
    Size of spot market 
    Size of bilaterals 
    Size of each state's load in PJM (i.e. 60% PA load) 
    The additional uses for fuel and emissions mix information besides compliance with RPS/Disclosure

 
Have a great weekend.

Thanks.  I think this works for now.  The only thing I see that we need to change is the 1-800 #.  There is a new business call center that has been set up in EES.  We are putting that phone # on all contracts.  It's 1-800-337-7827.  Thanks again.  Nicole

OK then, from what I understand then, this label will be good to go for insertion with the CG&E contracts.  Nicole, go ahead and use this one with the contract.  (PLEASE NOTE - I have changed this to 2002 projections since you won't be physical until Feb 2002 now.  Let me know if this is an incorrect assumption.)

We will be serving physical in CG&E territory beginning in Feb. 2002 (this was jut pushed back from Dec. 2001).  Origination will begin preselling beginning this week.  Therefore, on the Disclosure Label, which we would present to customers along with contracts between now and Feb., are we ok with stating "Unknown Purchases" and then change that once we're not buying on the spot market?

Thanks

Heather,

To the best of my knowledge the only customers in Ohio where physical delivery "CURRENTLY" takes place is First Energy (MSG PRODUCT ONLY) and the First Energy utilities should be directly providing the Disclosure Labels or provide load serving entities with the information necessary to complete the Disclosure Labels.  Physical delivery of power, other than MSG PRODUCT, may occur between November 2001 and March 2002; in either event Disclosure Labels need to be submitted to customers with the initial contracts and not again until immediately prior to physical delivery of power.

In all likelihood, spot purchases of power, rather than specific purchases of power, will occur therefore the Disclosure Label "can only" contain Unknown Purchases, as described by Stacey Bolton.  

Heather, I think that the three of us (you, Stacey and myself) need to discuss proper procedures regarding Disclosure Labels.

Richard

I'm not sure what needs to be done - Nicole says we're doing a physical product in CG&E.  I will forward her message to me to all of you.  Richard & Stacy - please work together to figure out what needs to be done, if anything to the fuel mix part.

Heather,

We are not delivering any power, other than Market Support Generation (MSG), which is provided by the First Energy utility companies.  It should either be the utilities that provide disclosure label information for our label we have to default to "Unknown Purchases" or whatever else is allowed/required by the Ohio PUC's.

We need to start sending our Ohio label with the contract to new Ohio customers (CG&E starting in Dec according to Nicole Schwartz).  I've had Sandy Cofer look over this one that was done by Allison way back when to see if it still meets requirements, and it does.  Can you confirm the fuel mixes, etc. for me?

Thanks.

Sounds like the economic justification for rejection is clear.  However, we need to be sure that we are not going to keep any customers where we have a contractual requirement to serve green power (Fetzer; Patagonia).  If we are comfortable that we are not, I think we can reject.

take a look at this. Unless there is a customer or regulatory reason to keep this, PPA, it would seem to me that we would want to reject this contract.

Thoughts/comments so we can proceed.

Murry,

Our forward curves show SP-15 power at $26.57/MWh for the period 02/01/2002-12/31/2002 (note that this does not include the discount for unit-contingency that usually accompanies wind power).  Green tags trade in the market for about $1.50/MWh.  Under the "Green Tickets Sales Agreement" it appears that EES has agreed to pay $39/MWh minus the market price of power, which is approximately $12/MWh for Green Tickets using our forward curves.

Let me know if you need any additional information.

Attached you will find two agreements EES has with ENRON Wind. 

1- Green Ticket Purchase Sale Agreement (PPA)
2- Scheduling Coordinator Service Agreement

With EES & ENA bankruptcy and the fact that Enron Wind has not been paid for the generation back to the month of November through current, Enron Wind is attempting to move their needs to APX for SC Services.  I also think they were looking for someone else to purchase their energy.  

I put a temporary stop on their actions but we are going to need to review these contracts to determine if we want to continue operating under them.

Please let me know your thoughts as soon as possible.

Thanks - MO

Here is a start:
 
Fundamentals
1. Chart that lists states w/ RPS and EES impact (whether they have physical delivery in the state).  
2. Federal and State incentive funds (will need to be kept updated
3. Map of RPS states
4. Map of REC programs (emerging and existing)
5. Projected Wind (Texas) <http://www.awea.org/projects/texas.html>
6. Projected Wind (US - AWEA) <http://www.awea.org/projects/>
 
We need to package the above into Comprehensive Regulatory Snapshots in order to determine top target states:
 
1. Comprehensive Regional Regulatory Snapshots with:
        a. Competitors

      Developers 
      Marketers/Wholesalers 
      Suppliers

        b. Regulatory Demand

REC Programs 
RPS and Disclosure Requirement 
Government Mandates 
Green Pricing Programs

        c. Competitive Demand

Product Offerings 
Competitive Sales (Jenny) 
RFPs

        d. Supply Picture

I got a couple of call making sure that the meeting is scheduled for tomorrow (Wednesday) the 29th.  That is correct.  In my prior message I had said Wednesday the 28th which was incorrect.

Thanks Mary Jo.  Just wanted to send out a reminder to all that we are on for 3:00 p.m.  tomorrow in EB 4795.  Mary Jo and I discussed briefly the goals for the meeting, which I'll briefly recap:

1. Have notional prices for commodity and RECs
2. Have contract language, including REC language that Richard provided
3. Give Steve a firm "offer" to take to his boss, Bill Donovan
4. Have some feedback from accounting on the accrual aspect
5. Determine final steps for contract terms and execution

Look forward to hopefully getting close to wrapping this up for everyone.  Thanks again Mary Jo for your leg work on this deal.

Please call if you have any questions.  I would like to know what everyone wants to accomplish by this meeting.  I know that Richard and Elliot have constructed some "Renewable language" in a contract we are currently working.  We will bring the pricing with the $6.00 adder that Richard has suggested that we use for the power.

I'm writing to invite you to a meeting on August 16 to discuss origination =
and trading opportunities in the renewable power sector. On April 1, we est=
ablished the Renewable Power Desk under the umbrella of West Power Trading =
and West Origination here in Portland. The Desk was established to apply En=
ron's power marketing and development expertise to the growing market for g=
reen power in the WSCC. Within 6 weeks we closed our first deal (a five yea=
r fixed-price sale of energy and renewable energy credits worth several mil=
lion dollars) and I am very excited about the opportunities in this market =
nationwide. I've spent a lot of time during the last several months establi=
shing contacts with the key developers and marketers in the renewable power=
 market, and Stacey Bolton of Enron's Environmental Strategies Group has ga=
rnered a very solid understanding of the regulatory environment and supply/=
demand dynamics in markets across the country. When you combine Enron's ski=
lls in the wholesale market with our huge customer base at EES and the incr=
easing level of green power committments in the public and private sectors,=
 it becomes readily apparent that Enron is poised to be a major player and =
market-maker in the renewable power sector.

I would like to meet with you and other representatives of Enron's trading =
and origination groups on Thursday, August 16 from 12-3 to discuss a coordi=
nated commercial response to the renewable power market on a nationwide bas=
is.  Lunch will be served. Please let Stacey or me know ASAP if you or a de=
signate from your group will be able to attend.  We will contact you with a=
 follow-up call/e-mail the week of August 6th with a room location and agen=
da, and hope you will be able to attend.

Dick,

Humberto is handling the daily pricing for Maine now.

He is currently using $3.00/$2.50.   

Could you please be sure to give him any updates if these rates change.  Otherwise we will be assuming that these costs are accurate.

Bill

     INDUSTRY REPORT
     ---------------


                  UCS Report Highlights Importance of RPS

     The Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) recently released a report
     showing how a diversified electricity mix including 20 percent
     renewable energy could save California consumers up to $1.8 billion
     and alleviate the disruptions in energy supply that have plagued
     Californians during the summer months.  The report, titled "Powering
     Ahead," analyzes the economic impacts of the renewable portfolio
     standard (RPS) in California.  Over 95 percent of California's
     current contracts for future energy production are committed to
     natural gas.

     Although the California state assembly was expected to consider RPS
     legislation this past week, action has been postponed until the
     weekend when the legislators are scheduled to complete this year's
     work.

     "California has experienced first-hand the dangers of a market
     dominated by volatile fossil fuels," said UCS senior analyst and
     report author Deborah Donovan.  "Now we have the hard numbers to
     prove renewable energy is beneficial for California's economic
     health."

     The state of Texas has implemented the most successful RPS to date,
     where requirements for new renewable generation capacity have been
     set high enough to create a strong market for renewable project
     development.  Natural gas prices in California have been extremely
     volatile with price hikes 10 to 20 times the historical average last
     year.

     However, in California the Department of Water Resources, which buys
     power for the state, uses a formula that makes it difficult for wind
     power to participate in the market and that has stunted investment
     in new wind power projects.

     UCS said that RPS are designed to help alleviate some of the burden
     created by state-by-state legislation which creates hurdles for the
     widespread adoption of renewable energies.  Additionally, RPS
     provides for the preservation of state jurisdiction over energy
     while making it easier for renewable energy technologies to
     penetrate the market.

                DOE Awards Funds for Bioenergy Development

     The Department of Energy (DOE) recently announced that it will
     invest $30 million over the next three to five years in 11 projects
     intended to develop process technology to create various products
     using plant matter and other natural waste materials.  Funds will
     also be used to establish university education and training programs
     in the area of bioproducts.

     "Producing marketable industrial products out of plants saves
     energy, saves nonrenewable resources and creates jobs," said DOE
     secretary Spencer Abraham.  "The bioenergy and bioproducts fields
     hold tremendous potential for environmentally desirable
     manufacturing and the creation of new jobs in the farm belt."

     DOE said it will provide $5 million for a project to develop the
     collection, commercial processing and utilization of corn stover.
     Partners in the project include Biomass Agri-Products, Iowa State
     University, Midwest Labs and Cargill Dow.  Private funding for
     the project will be $5 million.

     The agency noted that three education grants were awarded to
     establish multi-disciplinary education and training for graduate
     students in the area of bioproducts technologies.  The grants will
     help fund the establishment of "cross-cutting multi-disciplinary
     academic and research programs and provide stipends for deserving
     graduate students."

     DOE will also provide $7.3 million for a project focused on biomass
     biorefinery for production of polymers and fuel.  Partners in the
     project include Metabolix, Inc., the University of Tennessee,
     the University of Central Florida and the University of
     Massachusetts.

              BEF Grant Brings Solar Energy to Orcas Island

     The Bonneville Environmental Foundation (BEF) recently announced
     that it has provided a grant to help add four new solar sites to the
     Orcas Power and Light Cooperative (OPALCO) Green Power program
     headquartered in Friday Harbor, WA.

     The $37,000 provided by BEF enabled OPALCO to install solar panels
     at the Windermere Real Estate Building in Eastsound, WA, the Lopez
     (Island) Community Center, the Westsound Marina and the OPALCO
     office.  This combination of utility-owned and privately-owned sites
     will contribute an estimated 5,200 kilowatt hours (kWh) of
     electricity a year into the electricity grid, producing energy that
     is "natural and pollution-free" while helping the islands served by
     OPALCO to become more self sufficient.

     "The regional interest in solar energy has quickened considerably
     since BEF opened its doors in 1999," said BEF president Angus
     Duncan.  "OPALCO members have been among the first to show a high
     level of interest in power that is non-polluting."

     BEF said it is funding watershed projects that use solar power to
     pump water for cattle and irrigation while protecting streams. The
     group was founded in 1998 to fund new renewable energy resources and
     watershed restoration projects.  Although BEF maintains a strong
     collaborative relationship with the Bonneville Power
     Administration, they are separate organizations.

Subject:=09CA BIZMIX Issues

Hello all!

I met with Diann Huddleson today and she clarified some issues for me regar=
ding the DASRing of customers in California.  Unfortunately it wasn't what =
we wanted to hear.

On the easy side of things, all residential customers (PGE, SCE, SDG&E) wer=
e turned back to the utilities starting May 30th (DASRs were submitted and =
they are cycling off now depending upon meter reading cycles, etc.)  These =
customers received a letter letting them know about it.

On the commercial side of things (Diann had no distinctions between small c=
ommercial & large commercial & industrial customers), SDG&E customers have =
been ours all along and have never been DASRed and reDASRed.  In PGE & SCE,=
 IBM behind PGE was also never put through the DASR process and has continu=
ously received our product.  All other PGE & SCE customers were originally =
submitted for DASRing back to the utilities on - January 31!!!!!  That prov=
ides enough issues of its own, but I'll get to that.  PGE did a virtual swi=
tch so as of Jan 31 all these customers became PGE's again, but with SCE, w=
hen a customer was switched depending upon meter reading cycles, etc.  All =
de-DASRed customers were then re-DASRed back to us starting June 21, and Di=
ann indicated that not only all of our old customers were re-DASRed, but ne=
w contracts were being executed and these new customers were also being DAS=
Red to us.  No communication about all of this has been sent to the custome=
rs, but as we discussed, some personal basis notice may have been given to =
our larger customers through the reps.

So - I'm not worried about the residential side - we'll have to send them a=
n annual historical label next April (with perhaps a letter explaining why =
they're still receiving info from us).  As far as the commercial/industrial=
 .......

1.  No notice was provided to probably the majority of the customers. [Bolt=
on, Stacey]  We (or PR) should prepare a customer letter as discussed with =
Peggy, notifying them that they are no longer receiving Bizmix ASAP.
2.  They've been receiving system mix since Feb 1 and we've been proceeding=
 as if it were actually BIZMIX - i.e. the 2nd quarter labels they just rece=
ived indicated BIZMIX, as appropriate to the customer. [Bolton, Stacey]   W=
e should look into purchasing green tags to make these customers whole if w=
e will be more than 5% off of our projection v. what we actually delivered.=
  The regs allow for discrepancies between projections and actual, and you =
don't have to show an extra column w/ the difference if you are w/in 5% del=
ta band between projection and actual..  We can change the projection for t=
hird quarter and include this information in the customer letter.=20
3.  What are the new customers (those as being DASRed to us the first time =
as of June 21) being told they are receiving?  Are they being marketed BIZM=
IX? [Bolton, Stacey]   We should ensure this is not the case with originati=
on.  Someone in Jeremy B.'s shop will most likely know.=20
4.  As far as dates are concerned for reporting purposes, will we just use =
those given as the date of submission (i.e. Jan 31, May 30, June 21) as it =
is impossible to pinpoint when each individual customer transferred? [Bolto=
n, Stacey]   We should discuss this a bit.  I'm not sure that this will rea=
lly matter at the end of the day.  The CEC has instructed us all along to s=
end labels to the customers, which we have.  We'll report the purchases (br=
own and green) as normal at the end of the year.=20

Let me know your input.

Heather

Sorry Dick, I did not manage to get back to you today. Let's talk about this Monday.  Due to the limitation of the current database front end design, we will need to squeeze the green power curve into one of the existing uplift component.  We can break it out but probably not on the first release. Thanks

Stacy/Richard,

Is the data center (7210 Ardmore St.) going under the same deal?  It hasn't been part of the discussion so I'll assume no until I hear back.

Based on our last meeting I think it was estimated that EB 1 will use 28 million kWh/year, and when EB 2 will use 42.5 million kWh/year.  So a total of 70.5 million kWh/year.  Is this your understanding too?  

The data center, if included, looks like it uses about 6 million kWh/year.

Bob

Richard and I spoke with Bob Hansen yesterday to get status on the presentation pitch to you.  Bob said that he still needs to coordinate w/ Mary Jo on the accounting issue, but will have a presentation for you to look at by next Friday -- with price quotes scenarios depending on length of commodity deal and whether or not you participate in the pilot.  In addition, I've coordinated with Elliot Mainzer, Mike Curry and Michael Payne who will get you a quote for a 5 year REC term by week's end.
 
We should then set up a meeting to discuss the week of the 6th as a prelude to firming up the details and showing it to your boss.

Kay,

To the extent that "green" power is invoiced and/or credited by the Utility via a Utility Invoice Credit, Enron Energy Services, Inc. should be entitled to such credit so as to avoid Enron Energy Services, Inc. providing more Renewable Energy than provided for in the Agreement (100% of energy requirements, up to the Anticipated Usage for each Account).  Enron Energy Services, Inc.'s obligation cannot be increased via any Utility Invoice.

Let me know if you would like to discuss the response to Kinko's comment regarding "green" power credits.

Regards,

Richard

I have to provide Kinko's a written response to their 4 page contractual comments document. Can one of you draft a response to their comment below? I have said we cannot accomodate this language and need a reason why from one of you guys.
Thanks
Kay

2.8 Last few sentences
Change "(including, without limitation 'green' power)" to "(excluding, without limitation 'green' power)". Does not make sense that Enron would charge Kinko's a premium for renewable power, and then keep any potential invoice credits that arise from our decision to purchase renewable power.

Your comments are awesome. I probably should have asked you to write the thing in the first place. I am going to paste in all your changes and re-send the document. Maybe you can experiment with the product offerings you'd like to see on the Product Offering Document.

Elliott,

Based on your request I have taken the opportunity to modify your Renewable Product Description, see attached.  I hope that your are not offended by the quantity of modifications.  Actually, the PJM region is located within the "MAAC" region and not "MAAP".  I would also like to see a product for each region that represents (i) 50% wind (ii) 50% wind 50% biomass.  In addition, we could have two sets of prices (i) utilizing new renewables and (ii) utilizing existing renewables.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Richard

Walt:
 
Attached is a copy of the TX label that has been prepared for small customers.  For suppliers purchasing off of spot, the actual numbers to calculate the label and emissions will not be out until January.  However if a company is making an "environmental claim" (I'll deliver you 100% wind), the company projects the fuel/emission mix they will deliver to the customer over a year period.  See attached Green Mountain label as an example. <https://www.greenmountain.com/gmec/tx/tx_efl.jsp>
 
As we discussed if TI is looking to differentiate their fuel mix, I know that Elliot and Richard will be able to help you from the REC commodity end.  They will not be able to offset their NOx limits under the SIP by purchasing renewables.  They will have to purchase ERCs or allowances from other companies that have overcontrolled or install control technology.  I took a look at their Environmental statement, and they have an internal pledge to reduce energy consumption by 15% for their facilities.  They highlight the emissions reductions from the conservation and detail their fuel mix (page 15).  <http://www.ti.com/corp/docs/company/citizen/esh/english.pdf>
I'd let TI know that we can provide their fuel mix and emissions as well as offsetting their system purchase with RECs.
 
The TX labeling rules are as follows:
 
1. Disclosure labels with fuel mix, emissions data and average price are required to be submitted to residential and small commercial customers.  Labels are submitted to customers 2 times per year and an annual report substantiating the purchases and sales is required to be submitted to the PUC.
2. To calculate the label or label(s), the supplier weights the percentage of power coming from system contracts/bilaterals/spot and renewable energy credits.  The PUC has provided the fuel and emissions data from each generating company in TX along with the emissions on their website.  <http://www.puc.state.tx.us/rules/rulemake/22816/050301lableworkbook.xls> They will provide the default system mix for spot purchases by year's end. 
3. Each supplier will have a percentage obligation to purchase renewable energy credits (representing the "attributes" of 1 MWh of renewable energy dispatched onto the grid) and will note this on the label.  EES cannot "market" their obligation as a renewable product so you can't sell a product for a premium representing your entire renewable mandate to customers.  
 
I'm glad to answer any further questions.

Stacey Bolton

I'm writing to invite you to a meeting on August 16 to discuss origination =
and trading opportunities in the renewable power sector. On April 1, we est=
ablished the Renewable Power Desk under the umbrella of West Power Trading =
and West Origination here in Portland. The Desk was established to apply En=
ron's power marketing and development expertise to the growing market for g=
reen power in the WSCC. Within 6 weeks we closed our first deal (a five yea=
r fixed-price sale of energy and renewable energy credits worth several mil=
lion dollars) and I am very excited about the opportunities in this market =
nationwide. I've spent a lot of time during the last several months establi=
shing contacts with the key developers and marketers in the renewable power=
 market, and Stacey Bolton of Enron's Environmental Strategies Group has ga=
rnered a very solid understanding of the regulatory environment and supply/=
demand dynamics in markets across the country. When you combine Enron's ski=
lls in the wholesale market with our huge customer base at EES and the incr=
easing level of green power committments in the public and private sectors,=
 it becomes readily apparent that Enron is poised to be a major player and =
market-maker in the renewable power sector.

I would like to meet with you and other representatives of Enron's trading =
and origination groups on Thursday, August 16 from 12-3 to discuss a coordi=
nated commercial response to the renewable power market on a nationwide bas=
is.  Lunch will be served. Please let Stacey or me know ASAP if you or a de=
signate from your group will be able to attend.  We will contact you with a=
 follow-up call/e-mail the week of August 6th with a room location and agen=
da, and hope you will be able to attend.

MIRANT TO FUND AT LEAST $50 MILLION IN CLIMATE CHANGE INITIATIVES

09/24/2001 
Oxy-Fuel News 
(c) 2001 Phillips Business Information, Inc. 
Atlanta-based energy provider Mirant will fund at least $50 million in initiatives to help find solutions to global climate change, it announced recently. The investment, which will be made over 10 years, is one of several projects outlined in the company's first annual environmental report. 
"This funding is a further investment in the development of a progressive environmental program that can benefit the global community in which we operate," said Mirant President and CEO Marce Fuller. 
Mirant's environmental report outlines the company's commitment to fund climate change initiatives, including greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation projects to help offset its CO2 emissions, such as carbon sequestration projects. The company will also fund research develop less carbon- intensive generation technologies. 
Additionally, renewable energy will play an important role in meeting global energy the company will pursue opportunities to develop and invest in renewable generation projects. "Mirant expects that Europe offers many of the best opportunities for investment in renewable energy given the targets set by several European Union countries to increase their share of renewables," said Barney Rush, CEO of Mirant's European business group. 
Mirant's environmental report also features several environmental initiatives the company has developed, including establishment of environmental performance indicators to set improvement targets and measure performance and a commitment to develop air emissions reduction goals.

Subject:=09ME Direct Mini Form


Sarah --

Attached for your review are (i) a clean version of ME direct mini form; (i=
i) a redline of the ME direct mini form, marked to show changes against the=
 TX form provided in your 7.26.01 email; (iii) a terms of service document;=
 (iii) a disclosure label; and (iv) a customer authorization statement.

The following is a brief explanation of changes and a few provisions of the=
 Maine Rules we wanted to draw to your attention:

Direct Mini Form

* As discussed, we've updated the term under Section 2.1 (and under "Durati=
on and Kind of Contract" in the terms of service summary) to reflect the cu=
stomer's option of a 24-month, 36-month, 48-month or 60-month term.

* In Maine, certain consumer protection provisions (such as customer rescis=
sion rights and provision of the disclosure label and terms of service summ=
ary) apply to residential and small commercial customers (less than 20 kW o=
f demand) only.  As it is our understanding that the direct marketing campa=
ign will target small commercial customers, we have drafted the direct mini=
 form, terms of service, and disclosure label with that customer class in m=
ind.

* We've left the requirement of concurrent execution of the customer author=
ization form in Section 2.1(i) and Section 3 unchanged although the Rules o=
nly require that this document be obtained prior to initiating service . Se=
e WCMR 65-407-305(4)(D)(2)(a).  As the goal of the direct marketing campaig=
n is to simultaneously obtain an executed agreement and customer authorizat=
ion form, we believe this is a clean way to manage the administration of do=
cuments and avoid confusion.

* On a similar note, and as discussed in connection with the MA direct mini=
 form, we've drafted the five day customer rescission period in Section 3 t=
o run from the execution of the agreement, with a notation that the terms o=
f service and disclosure label are provided concurrently with the agreement=
.  The Rules, however, provide that the rescission period runs five busines=
s days from the customer's receipt of the terms and service summary which m=
ust be received by the customer 30 days following execution of the agreemen=
t.  (i.e. the MPUC envisions (i) the execution of the contract, (ii) a time=
 passage of up to 30 days; (iii) the delivery of the terms of service summa=
ry and disclosure label to the customer, followed by (iv) a five business d=
ay right of rescission running from that date of the customer's receipt of =
the terms of service and disclosure label) See WCMR 65-407-305(4)(C).  As d=
iscussed in connection with the TX direct mini form, we believe many commis=
sions, including the PUCT and MPUC, envision the terms of service document =
to behave and function more in the manner of how we would typically conside=
r a contract to behave and function.  Our thought process in drafting the r=
escission period in the ME form to run from the execution of the agreement =
is provide a clean way for EESI to manage the administration of the documen=
ts due to the unique mechanics of the transaction (the simultaneous deliver=
y of the agreement, terms of service, disclosure label and customer authori=
zation statement by the sales rep to the customer followed by the immediate=
 execution of the agreement and customer authorization statement).  We want=
ed to point out that as drafted, however, this provision is technically inc=
onsistent with the Rules.

*  To provide uniformity across forms, we have not changed the language und=
er 2.6 Security which provides that EESI may request security " as provided=
 in the Rules"   We wanted to point out, however, that the ME Rules do not =
restrict the amount of deposits required by competitive electricity provide=
rs (CEPs).

* We've revised Section 3 "Your Signature and Notices" and the Representati=
ons and Warranties section under the GT&Cs to model the ME Rules by deletin=
g references to "Your Rights as a Customer Statement" (a document unique to=
 Texas) and changed references to "electricity facts label" to "disclosure =
label" (ME's description of the label, as opposed to TX's).

* The ME Rules require a 30 day notice to the customer in the event of term=
ination due to the customer's default.  See WCMR 65-407-305(4)(G)(1).  We'v=
e updated the "Default and Early Termination" section of the GT&Cs to refle=
ct this requirement.

* By obtaining a license as a CEP in ME, EESI thereby agrees to (i) submit =
to jurisdiction in the courts of the state of Maine; (ii) that all legal pr=
oceedings relating to disputes will be maintained in ME courts or before ME=
 administrative agencies; and (iii) that all contracts for generation servi=
ce in ME with a demand of 100 kW or less will be interpreted according to M=
E law.  See WCMR 65-407-305(2)(B)(8)  We've updated the governing law provi=
sion to reflect Maine jurisdiction.

Terms of Service

As discussed, the Maine Rules were modeled after the Massachusetts Rules an=
d many items, such as the terms of service summary and disclosure label, ar=
e practically identical in format and content.  As such, we've modeled the =
ME terms of service summary and disclosure label after the documents provid=
ed in MA, with a few notable exceptions:

* The ME Rules require a listing in the terms of service summary of "condit=
ions under which a credit reporting agency is contacted for an applicant's =
credit history or under which the Competitive Supplier reports the customer=
's payment history to a credit reporting agency".  See WCMR 65-407-306(2)(D=
)(2)(d).  Under "Credit Information", we've provided general information th=
at the agreement will not be effective unless and until the credit standard=
s established by EESI are met, that it is EESI's practice to perform credit=
 checks on all applicants whereby EESI may contact a credit reporting agenc=
y to obtain the customer's credit history, and that in the event of nonpaym=
ent under the Agreement, it is possible that EESI would report such nonpaym=
ent to a credit reporting agency.

* The Rules do not restrict the amounts of deposits nor is the CEP required=
 to pay any interest on deposit in ME.  The terms of service, however, requ=
ires the CEP to notify the customer as to deposit requirements and interest=
 on deposits (most likely as a measure for the customer to compare services=
 offered by competing CEPs). See WCMR 65-407-306(2)(D)(2)(e).  As currently=
 drafted, the terms of service provides that security deposits may be requi=
red and interest will not be paid to the customer if such a deposit is obta=
ined.

* The Rules require that the terms of service, if applicable, notify the cu=
stomer of the CEPs ability to assign the agreement to another CEP without t=
he customer's consent. See WCMR 65-407-306(2)(D)(2)(m).  We've provided und=
er "Assignment" that EESI will notify the customer in the event of an assig=
nment which in any way affects the customer's rights and obligations under =
the agreement.

* The Rules require the terms of service document to conspicuously disclose=
 the customer's right of rescission and how it may be exercised. See WCMR 6=
5-407-306(2)(D)(2)(i).  We've drafted the "Information on Rescission Rights=
" section with a box around it to satisfy the requirement that the disclosu=
re be conspicuous.

* Please note that the Rules require the terms of service to list, and we h=
ave left brackets around, the toll free number and hours that a customer ca=
n contact the CEP for customer questions and complaints. See WCMR 65-407-30=
6(2)(D)(2)(j)

Disclosure Label

* As the ME label is almost identical to the MA disclosure label, we've mad=
e similar changes to convert the label to a fixed price rather than variabl=
e price product.. Heather Mathis is coordinating with the commercial team t=
o verify the accuracy of the data (esp. the avg price per kWh of 5.08 cents=
).  As discussed with Heather, please note that EESI must file all new prod=
uct labels with the MPUC. See WCMR 65-407-306(3)(D).  The Rules are silent =
as to the timing of this filing and it is unclear whether the filing must b=
e made prior to or concurrently with the distribution of the new label to c=
ustomers.  Please let me know if you would like us to seek clarification on=
 this point.

Customer Authorization Statement

The Rules regarding the content of the customer authorization statement are=
 identical to the MA Rules and, as such, we have modeled the ME form after =
MA.  The only change is the correction of the rule referenced in the openin=
g sentence of the letter.  Although, as we may have discussed, the referenc=
e to such rule is not a requirement and is therefore probably not essential=
 in either the MA or ME forms, we've left the reference in for uniformity's=
 sake.


If you have any questions about the attached or would like to discuss furth=
er, please give me a call.

U.S. Investment in Energy Efficiency Research Pays Off

The United States has reaped huge economic benefits
from its investments in energy efficiency research and
development, says a report released last week by the
National Research Council (NRC). An NRC panel examined
17 energy efficiency projects that represented $1.6 billion in
federal investment, or roughly 20 percent of the $7.3 billion
that DOE has spent over the past 22 years. The panel
estimates that the $1.6 billion investment yielded net
economic benefits of $30 billion.

Incredibly, three DOE projects that cost only $11 million
resulted in most of the economic benefit: compressors for
refrigerators and freezers, energy-efficient fluorescent-
lighting components called electronic ballasts, and low-
emission (low-e) window glass that resists the transmission
of heat through windows. The NRC also credits federal
standards and regulations that incorporated the efficiencies
attainable by these new technologies, ensuring that the
technologies would be adopted nationwide.

As part of the report, the panel also examined federal
investments in fossil energy research and development. For
22 projects costing $11 billion -- about 73 percent of the
$15 billion spent over 22 years -- the NRC estimates net
economic benefits of $10.8 billion. See the July 17th press
release on the National Academies Web site at:

Company Builds First 5,000-Horsepower HTS Motor

American Superconductor Corporation has built the first
5,000-horsepower motor that uses high-temperature
superconducting (HTS) wires in its rotor, the company
announced last week. Because HTS wires carry large
amounts of electrical current with low energy losses, the
HTS motor is roughly half the size and weight of a
conventional motor, and also reduces the energy losses by
up to 50 percent. According to the company, motors greater
than 1,000 horsepower in size use one-quarter of the
electricity generated in the United States, so the potential
energy savings from large HTS motors could be significant.

Honda, BMW Start Up Hydrogen Fueling Stations

American Honda Motor Co., Inc. announced in early July the
startup of a hydrogen fueling station for its fuel-cell-powered
vehicles. Located at Honda's research and development
center in Torrance, California, the station uses solar power
to extract hydrogen from water. The solar panels on the
station generate enough hydrogen to power one fuel-cell
vehicle, but additional electrical power from the power grid is
used to increase the hydrogen production capacity. The new
station will support Honda's fuel cell vehicle development
program and will be used for hydrogen production, storage
and fueling. See the July 10th press release on the Honda
Web site at:
<http://www.hondacorporate.com/press/index.html?s=american&y=2001>.

BMW also opened a hydrogen fueling station this month.
The company's new liquid hydrogen fuel station is located at
its Engineering and Emissions Control Test Center in
Oxnard, California. BMW is taking a different approach than
most car companies, burning hydrogen directly in advanced
internal-combustion engines. A fleet of its 12-cylinder
hydrogen-fueled cars came to Los Angeles this month as
part of the company's "CleanEnergy WorldTour 2001" --
several of the cars will remain at the Oxnard facility for
extensive testing and demonstrations. See the BMW press
release at:
<http://www.bmwusa.com/news_events/news_l.cfm?item_id=2035600115>.

QUANTUM Technologies WorldWide, Inc. is also doing its
part for hydrogen-powered vehicles: the company has
developed a vehicle storage tank for hydrogen that can hold
the gas at pressures of 10,000 pounds per square inch. See
the press release at:
<http://www.qtww.com/Press/6-27-01.htm>.


Texas Wind Plant Expands; Shell Buys Wyoming Plant

TXU Corporation and American Electric Power (AEP)
announced last week that AEP's wind plant in west Texas
will be expanded by 20 megawatts. The Trent Mesa Project,
now under construction near Abilene, will have a capacity of
150 megawatts when the expansion is complete. Power
generation will begin there this fall. See the press release on
the Trent Mesa Project Web site at:
<http://www.trentmesa.com/nl07172001.htm>.

Shell Renewables announced Monday that it has stepped
into the U.S. wind energy market by buying the 50-megawatt
Rock River I wind facility in Wyoming. The facility, which is
scheduled to begin operation in October, marks the start of
Shell Renewables' U.S. wind power company, which is
called Shell WindEnergy Inc. See the July 23rd press
release on the Royal Dutch/Shell Web site at:
<http://www.shell.com/royal-en/0,6091,,00.html>.

Construction of Rock River I was announced in June by
SeaWest WindPower Inc., which is selling the facility to Shell
WindEnergy. See the June 6th edition of EREN Network
News at:
<http://www.eren.doe.gov/newsletter/archives/2001/june6_01.html>.

Since wind power is an intermittent source of electricity -- it
is only available when the wind blows -- how much wind
power can a utility use without impacting electric system
operations? This issue -- called "wind integration" within the
power industry -- is being tackled through a new study
coordinated by the Utility Wind Interest Group (UWIG).
DOE's National Renewable Energy Laboratory will provide
technical support for the study, which will be performed by
Electrotek Concepts. See the UWIG press release at:
<http://www.uwig.org/newsreleases.html>.


Tyson Foods to Convert Chicken Manure to Energy

Up to 85,000 tons per year of chicken manure in the
Chesapeake Bay region will find a new use within the next
few years, as Tyson Foods, Inc. plans to convert it into
energy. The company announced earlier this month that it is
beginning the permitting process to build a gasification
facility at its processing plant in Temperanceville, Virginia.
The new facility will convert both the chicken manure and
about 30,000 tons per year of sludge from its wastewater
treatment plants into steam for use in the processing plant.
The $12 million plant will be able to produce 120,000 pounds
of steam per hour, and should be completed roughly
18 months after ground is broken for the project. See the
Tyson Foods press release at:

Study: Earth Likely to Warm 4 to 7 Degrees by 2100

The Earth is most likely to experience a global warming of
4 to 7 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100, according to a new
probability analysis performed by scientists in the United
States and Europe. A 5-degree temperature rise has the
highest probability, and the probability is 90 percent that the
temperature rise will be between 3 and 9 degrees, say the
researchers. The study was published in the July 20th issue
of the journal Science. See the press release from the
National Center for Atmospheric Research at:
<http://www.ucar.edu/communications/newsreleases/2001/temps.html>.

Injecting probability analysis into climate models is a recent
trend in the science of global warming -- a similar analysis
performed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in
March reached very similar conclusions. See the April 25th
edition of the EREN Network News at:

Thanks Mary Jo.  Just wanted to send out a reminder to all that we are on for 3:00 p.m.  tomorrow in EB 4795.  Mary Jo and I discussed briefly the goals for the meeting, which I'll briefly recap:

1. Have notional prices for commodity and RECs
2. Have contract language, including REC language that Richard provided
3. Give Steve a firm "offer" to take to his boss, Bill Donovan
4. Have some feedback from accounting on the accrual aspect
5. Determine final steps for contract terms and execution

Look forward to hopefully getting close to wrapping this up for everyone.  Thanks again Mary Jo for your leg work on this deal.

Let me know your thoughts/additions and changes?
 
 

Jerry:  

It was a pleasure to meet you in Portland.  Per our discussion at lunch, I've talked with Elliot Mainzer of our renewable power desk as well as Richard Ring who manages the supply for the GSA Region 1 Electric Generation Contract regarding the potential aggregation of RECs to DOE's and NREL's facilities/labs across the US.   We are glad to work with you and are glad to get you preliminary pricing information on the sourcing of RECS, however, we first need to get a little more information from you expressed in question format below.  

1. How long are you seeking for the length of the contract (5 -20 years)?  The GSA Region 1 Electric Generation Contract runs through October 2003; the GSA Region 1 Electric Generation Contract also covers Value Added Services, which includes byt is not limited to preliminary audits, comprehensive audits, feasibility studies, design reviews, engineering and design,  construction and installation, operation, maintenance, training and emergency response for Value Added Services .  Therefore, any of the facilities located in Region 1 could be directly negotiated and contracted through the GSA Region 1 Contract.  Agencies covered under the GSA Region 1 Contract include:  Veterans Administration, Coast Guard, National Parks Service, Internal Revenue Service, Department of Agriculture, National Archives & Records Administration, Hanscom Air Force Base & Department of Labor.

2. Approximate demand (MWh) for facilities and labs across the US?

3. What percentage of your demand do you ideally want to come from renewable energy (sourced by tags)?  Do you intend to ramp up over a number of years, or want to initially hit a certain percentage target that remains constant over the life of the contract?

4. Would you consider purchasing tags from recently announced projects with additional increments coming from unannounced new  renewable energy project(s).  If not, what percentage is required or desired?

5. What percentage of the tags need to come from new wind?  

6.  Is it your intention to source all of the certificates from the new wind facilities located on Native American Reservations in ND or SD?  If not, what would be the percentage you are seeking?

7. What is the timeframe in which you are looking to make your purchase decision?

8. Do you want the product to be Green-e certified?

9. Are you interested in coupling energy efficiency tags with renewable energy tags?

10.Would you need to put together an RFP?  If so, would you need one national RFP or many localized RFP's?

Richard - I will need your help on responding to this request- there are a lot of questions
I cannot field. I can provide the fixed gen pricing for the building with LF 65%, however all 
the other questions center around renewable questions. You will need to take lead on majority.
John McCarthy works in EES and prepares formal responses to inquiries of this nature
If you can help him with those questions, he is very quick at putting the general info needed on Enron
together and putting in a nice binded document with very speedy turnaround
Let me know how you want to proceed- it's due 11/9
thanks

Business; Financial Desk 
Enron's Wind Unit Reported in Talks Energy: Turbine division may fetch $723 million. More bidders could come forward.

08/20/2001 
Los Angeles Times 
Home Edition 
Page C-2 
Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company 
HOUSTON -- Enron Corp., the world's biggest energy trader, is in talks to sell its wind turbine unit for more than $723 million, the Sunday Business newspaper in London reported, without citing sources. 
The negotiations may falter, inviting other bids, the newspaper said. Enron spokesman Mark Palmer wouldn't comment on the report. 
Enron has said manufacturing might not be part of its future strategy, Palmer said. Enron Wind makes and operates wind-power turbines. Houston-based Enron bought the business, based in Tehachapi, Calif., in January 1997. 
"There is a tremendous potential for a wind or renewable energy market to develop," Palmer said. "We don't know that we need to be in the manufacturing business to participate in that." 
Credit Suisse First Boston is handling the sale, Sunday Business said. Private equity firms that may bid include Doughty Hanson & Co. and Candover Investments, both of Britain; Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale of Germany; and Nomura Securities Co. of Japan, the paper said. 
Possible industry buyers include Vestas Wind Systems and NEG Micon, both of Denmark; Gamesa of Spain; and Nordex and Enercon, both of Germany, the paper said. 
Last week, Enron Chief Executive and President Jeffrey K. Skilling abruptly resigned. Chairman Kenneth L. Lay has taken over his duties.

Please confirm these are correct.  Are we still providing all these products (for instance the EarthSmart 100)?  I'll get Mass & Maine to you later today, hopefully - still trying to get the Generation Price info.

Mike,

The agreement covers multiple projects; to date there is only one project that has come on line.  For the one project that has come on line during the non-performance penalty could be in the range of $150,000 to $640,000, depending on the resoultion of the "effective online date" for said project.  The non-performance penalty was our strongest negotiating point in the ongoing effort to restructure the agreement as there is a potential for penalties for each project for each year of the contract.  The agreement contained some fundamenal flaws in order to be able to book the mark-to-market for the agreement.  

I do not have a good handle of the "early termination payment" except to say that there are approxmiately 390,500 MWh's.  The average contract "fixed price" is $33.10 MWh.  I would need to find out what the nine year fixed price from the power curves is to estimate but my best stab would be to estimate the nine year fixed price to be $25.00 MWh which would result in "early termination payment" of approximately $3,200,000 ((390,500*33.10) - (390,500*25.00)).

Mike,

The "deal" is between EESI and Riverside County Waste Management Department (RCWMC) is dated April 17, 2000 and the term commenced on Sepetmber 1, 2000 and ending on September 1, 2010.  Based on our bankruptcy filing RCWMD stopped delivery of power on December 6, 2001; RCWMD invoiced EESI for power production for September 2001, 0ctober 2001 and November 2001.  I do not know if they were ever paid by EESI.  I do not know of any invoice for the first six days of December 2001.

EESI (myself) and EPMI (Chris Foster) were in the process of renegotiating the above referenced agreement with the plan for EPMI to take over the purchase of power and scheduling services with EESI being the purchaser of the "green tickets"  from EPMI associated with the power production.  There were some major issues to overcome in the renegotiation regarding the "fixed price", "volume committments" and "penalties".  I do not know who, if anyone, is currently looking at this agreement to make any kind of determination EESI's and/or EPMI's desires for the future of this agreement.  

RCWMD sent various letters dated December 10, 2001, December 13, 2001, and January 8, 2002 requesting response from EESI.  The December 10, 2001 letter indicates that RCWMD considers the agreement terminated effective December 2, 2001.  I had previously spoke to you about this agreement in December 2001.  

It is my opinion that we should not continue this agreement and we should consider RCWMD's offer to terminate the agreement with the exchange of the non-performance panalties for the termination payment.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Regards,

Richard

Subject:	Elimination of BizMix Product Offering

Hi Peggy:

This group met this afternoon to discuss a number of issues related to California retail disclosure; most importantly, the issue of the discontinuation of our BizMix product offer was discussed.

You will recall that we notified our CA C&I customers late last year that all were receiving BizMix (Including the EEMC customers which we acquired in 6/00) and that in conjunction with our providing this product, we would be making claims for credits through the CEC Subaccount Program.  Since that time, we have apparently sent all of our customers back to their respective utilities, and we now understand that we be switching all of these customers back to Enron service in the near term, but that BizMix will no longer be offered upon their return to Enron physical service.

It is our recommendation that we notify these customers that given the current circumstances in CA, upon their return to Enron service, we will no longer be able to offer BizMix and that they will instead receive system mix from us on a going forward basis.  I think it is important to note that because the offer of BizMix involved a "claim" through which we received Subaccount credit moneys, it is imperative that we somehow communicate to our customers that we are no longer able to provide this product given the current situation in CA.  

We ask for your thoughts (pro and con) regarding the issue of notifying these customers regarding this matter, and also ask for suggestions as to how to best communicate this message to the customers (e.g. bill stuffer, separate mailing, etc.)  

Hope all's well.  Thanks in advance for your input.

Marianne

Jenny,
 
We have a main Renewable Power Desk folder on the O Drive (O:Portland/WestDesk/Renewable Power Desk). Since we all have access to the O Drive, I would prefer to store all of our info there. I have created a new folder called Shared in which we can store our Competitive Analysis and other files.
 
Howe does that sound?

You should all now have access to a shared folder in the O drive.  Together with the internal competitive analysis web site we are developing, we can use this to keep files we all need access to.  
 
Check it out -

John:

I thought it might be helpful to expound on several important principles th=
at we have learned through experience regarding RPS/disclosure.   I've been=
 working on these issues for about 2 years, and they have a long and often =
complex history.  After you've had a chance to digest the below, I'm glad t=
o help out in our response.
1. RPS and disclosure requirements need to be developed together.  Further,=
 since environmental disclosure is a requirement in 14 states and RPS in 7 =
states, it's important that we don't have overlapping, redundant requiremen=
ts on a national level.  This can ultimately add to the customer's bill bec=
ause of the administrative cost to comply with these requirements.
2.  For disclosure, the label calculation (how you derive the fuel mix) is =
the most crucial. Suppliers need the following:=20
=09a. the ability to project what they will deliver to customers over a spe=
cified "settlement period" (we greatly prefer annually) if they are differe=
ntiating their products (either with bilateral contracts or claims about th=
e environmental benefits of the product). Otherwise, suppliers would submit=

3. For RPS and disclosure:  It is extremely important that any national RPS=
/disclosure requirement be developed with a certificate trading program.  A=
 certificate is usually defined as one MWh of renewable energy that has bee=
n generated, and represents the attributes or environmental benefits of the=
 generation separate from the underlying power.  This should be a tradable =
instrument separate from the power.  Renewable energy certificates "RECs" c=
an be bought sold, traded separately from power, and allows vital flexibili=
ty to get renewables to regions of the country where the supply might be co=
nstrained or where renewables such as wind and solar are not conducive to b=
eing sited.  RECs also provide verification for the purchase of power attri=
butes for RPS and disclosure. As Christi was stating below, it is impossibl=
e with our sophisticated wholesale markets to track all electrons from gene=
ration to end use consumption.  The beauty of certificate trading programs =
is that they create a secondary market by which the attributes of power can=
 be tracked through various trades. Certificates trading programs are not a=
lways limited to renewable energy.  In New England, they are developing a f=
ull certificates based system by which all generation would be issued certi=
ficates.  This helps support the disclosure requirements in the East.

John -- Kevin Presto, head of East Power Trading, had these comments:

Under Title IV Electric Reliability Standards -- Kevin says, "NERC should b=
e eliminated."

Under Title V Subtitle B Environmental Disclosure: -- Kevin says that the "=
uniform reporting to consumers, in monthly electric bills, of the known ene=
rgy sources" is not good because it supports day-ahead source requirements =
for retail suppliers.  Enron advocates the ability of customers to choose h=
ow to source their portfolio, whether from bilateral contracts done on an a=
head basis or purchases in the spot market. =20

John, the renewable portfolio standard provisions later in the draft bill m=
ay alleviate this concern, but I don't know enough about how that works.  S=
everal years ago credits were discussed as credits that accrued to the clea=
n energy generator and it can trade those credits.  Therefore, the seller o=
f clean energy to endusers would need to have a certain amount of clean cre=
dits in order to claim it sold clean energy (meaning that the clean generat=
or was supported by the marketplace since sellers needed a certain amount o=
f credits).  That program recognized that you can't specifically source a c=
lean generator to a load because electricity doesn't flow that way.  Thus, =
portfolio sourcing could continue and clean energy is supported.  But I don=
't know how this bill's provisions would work.  You probably have the Enron=
 experts on this (used to be Janel G.)  Thanks.

Michael,

It looks like there may be some problem with the Fetzer Vineyards
Greenpower Consumption Report.  You may want to review the report and
determine what is wrong.  Reportable Consumption is 352,536 kWh's and Total
Consumption is 4,407 kWh's.  Total Consumption should be more than
Reportable Consumption.

Also there is no consumption for the month of June 2001.

I can be reached at 713.853.3561.

Subject:	Elimination of BizMix Product Offering

Hi Peggy:

This group met this afternoon to discuss a number of issues related to California retail disclosure; most importantly, the issue of the discontinuation of our BizMix product offer was discussed.

You will recall that we notified our CA C&I customers late last year that all were receiving BizMix (Including the EEMC customers which we acquired in 6/00) and that in conjunction with our providing this product, we would be making claims for credits through the CEC Subaccount Program.  Since that time, we have apparently sent all of our customers back to their respective utilities, and we now understand that we be switching all of these customers back to Enron service in the near term, but that BizMix will no longer be offered upon their return to Enron physical service.

It is our recommendation that we notify these customers that given the current circumstances in CA, upon their return to Enron service, we will no longer be able to offer BizMix and that they will instead receive system mix from us on a going forward basis.  I think it is important to note that because the offer of BizMix involved a "claim" through which we received Subaccount credit moneys, it is imperative that we somehow communicate to our customers that we are no longer able to provide this product given the current situation in CA.  

We ask for your thoughts (pro and con) regarding the issue of notifying these customers regarding this matter, and also ask for suggestions as to how to best communicate this message to the customers (e.g. bill stuffer, separate mailing, etc.)  

Hope all's well.  Thanks in advance for your input.

Marianne

I adapted one of my slide presentations for the regulatory part, which both of you have already seen.  What I'd like your feedback on is the attached slide w/ the premium information (second to last slide).  Understand that I'm trying to be sensitive and not give too much "competitive" information, but want to provide her w/ an overview of how the supply/demand picture affects the premium per region.  
 
Let me know your thoughts/suggestions.  Also, Elliot, Richard and I worked on the fundamentals all morning & made some progress.

Richard - I will need your help on responding to this request- there are a lot of questions
I cannot field. I can provide the fixed gen pricing for the building with LF 65%, however all 
the other questions center around renewable questions. You will need to take lead on majority.
John McCarthy works in EES and prepares formal responses to inquiries of this nature
If you can help him with those questions, he is very quick at putting the general info needed on Enron
together and putting in a nice binded document with very speedy turnaround
Let me know how you want to proceed- it's due 11/9

My understanding is that we used to have investments.  I don't think this group still exists.  I believe this is back when we had Solarex.  The only investment that I'm aware of is the Fuel Cell Energy investment.

Hello, Richard:

We met a couple of months ago.   I was working with Bill Hatch in Boston, MA; I am now with the Product Management group in Houston.  I was wondering if there are any new developments regarding Enron-Renewable Energy ventures.  I read that Enron has invested in 12 different alternative energy companies (which was news to me).

Hope that you are well.

Subject:	Green Power

Asset Management is in the process of updating site information and seeking documentation of  revenue meter testing at Green Power.  Marion did not know who I should request this information from and suggested that I start with EES.  

All the other projects have a stipulation in their agreements requiring utilities to undertake testing of their metering equipment to verify the accuracy of such equipment.  If testing reveals that the equipment is outside of a specified range, then the utility will calibrate the meter.  

I am looking to send a request for evidence or certification of such testing at Green Power.  Specifically, I need the contact information for the EES utility liaison or 
the person at the utility who is responsible for verifying metering accuracy at this site.

If you know of anyone who can assist with this matter, please forward their contact information to me.

Thanks

I can't remember if I forwarded this to you guys.  Of note, see the Exelon/Community Energy piece. 

I was planning to attend the luncheon mentioned below, however, it is the same day as the kick-off meeting for the PJM trading system group.  I doubt I'll be able to make it, but one of you might like to attend.

October 26, 2001
Vol. 3,  No. 20
Wind Market Power 
As strong winds blew in from the west on October 24th,  Community Energy and Exelon Power Team executives announced the five largest  retail wind purchases in America's history to a large crowd of excited onlookers  gathered for the dedication of two new Pennsylvania wind farms. 
 
Amidst cheers and applause, Mike Freeman of Exelon Power Team  and Brent Alderfer of Community Energy announced that the University of  Pennsylvania now leads the nation for the largest retail purchase of wind. The  Penn Quakers are buying 20 million kilowatt-hours (kWh) - the output of five  turbines or the equivalent of 5 percent of its electricity - from the Community  Energy-Exelon Power Team's 15 MW and 9 MW wind farms at Mill Run and Somerset  Township. 
 
With these turbines only just beginning to turn, multiple  conversations were heard about the need to build even more wind farms to meet  retail consumer demand for wind energy. All those standing on the reclaimed mine  land that is now a dairy farm could see before them the merging of wind power  and the power of the retail marketplace.
 
Not far behind the Quakers in their purchase are the roaring  Nittany Lions of Penn State University. Penn State University is purchasing more  than 13 million kWh, the production of three turbines, from Community Energy.  For a land grant university, it's hard to beat clean energy made on a dairy  farm.
 
In third place is Carnegie Mellon University, which created  crucial momentum by becoming the first major wind purchaser, acquiring 4.8  million kWh. Having exercised real leadership and gotten this market moving,  Carnegie Mellon is seriously considering increasing its wind energy buy next  year.
 
Rounding out the top five are the Philadelphia Suburban Water  Company and Giant Eagle, with purchases of about 4 million and 3 million kWh  respectively. 
 
We urge more companies and utilities to follow their examples.  If you are interested in buying wind energy, contact Community Energy at  www.newwindenergy.com . 
 
In fact, if just 660 institutions buy at least the output of  one large wind turbine, Pennsylvania's retail consumers can insure that 1,000 MW  of new wind energy are built and operating. By harnessing the power of the  retail market to wind power development, that goal is very achievable.  
 
Though not in the top five, the Environmental Protection  Agency, Western Pennsylvania Conservancy, and the White Dog Cafe in Philadelphia  have all also made major purchases. Every one of these purchasers understands  the price of wind energy, but more importantly, they understand its  environmental, public health, and energy security value, showing that Oscar  Wilde wasn't right about everyone when he said "nowadays people know the price  of everything and the value of nothing."
 
Stunningly, 75 percent of the wind power from these two wind  farms was sold out as soon as Public Utility Commission Chairman Glen Thomas and  Department of Environmental Protection Secretary David Hess flipped the switch  of the first of what are sixteen Enron Wind 1.5 MW machines. 
 
These turbines, which make 11-20 full revolutions per minute,  are the largest manufactured in the United States, and their blades are longer  than previously used to be more efficient in the moderate-but-steady wind at  these locations. All told, they will generate enough electricity for 8,000  homes, or about 63 million kWh of electricity - with no soot, mercury, carbon  dioxide, nitrogen oxide, or sulfur dioxide. In contrast, typical system power in  this region would emit about 75 million pounds of carbon dioxide, 568,000 pounds  of sulfur dioxide, and 177,000 pounds per year of nitrogen oxide in order to  provide the same amount of electricity.  
 
But aside from the important environmental benefits, the wind  projects also reflect substantial economic development in Fayette and Somerset  counties. Both the Mill Run and Somerset turbines are on working farms, with the  owners receiving $3,000 to $4,000 for each tower erected on their land, which  they continue to farm. Several of the Somerset turbines are situated on  reclaimed strip and deep mines. Construction of the two wind farms required  about 40 labor years of employment and will require about four full-time  equivalent workers to maintain and operate the sites. The sites generate local  property taxes and, if yesterday's dedication ceremonies and the nearby Green  Mountain wind farm in Garrett are any indication, at least a modest tourist  industry! 
 
This was all made possible by a great project team and every  member deserves a hearty "well done." Although construction only took about 4?  months, project development by Atlantic Renewable Energy Corporation began about  two years ago. Zilkha Renewable Energy, Atlantic's development partner, provided  project financing, as did The Reinvestment Fund's Sustainable Development Fund,  with money made available as a result of the PECO Energy and Unicom merger  settlement negotiated by PennFuture and others. Exelon Power Team is the  wholesaler and Community Energy markets wind energy to retail customers.   
 
On a sad note, Nick Humber, an Enron Wind employee who was  instrumental in moving the projects to fruition, died when his hijacked plane  crashed into the World Trade Center on Sept. 11. Another plane that crashed in  Somerset County was only about 15 miles from the wind farm. Nick's contribution  to the project leaves a stunning memorial, reaching into the sky, with clean,  affordable, home-grown electricity that supports our communities. We are glad  that Nick's brother was able to attend the dedication. 
 
As the tragic events of Sept. 11 spur renewed patriotism and  interest in domestic safety, it is important to recognize that the Community  Energy-Exelon wind farms will help to increase America's energy independence and  security. More wind farms can only do us more good. 
 
"Conservation is a moral issue," said President Teddy  Roosevelt, "for it involves the patriotic duty to insure the safety and  continuance of the nation." 
 
In these times, conservation of America's environment and  protecting the nation's safety cannot be done without an accelerated shift to  wind and other renewable energy resources. To all involved with this project,  but especially the University of Pennsylvania and the other purchasers who have  acted in keeping with Teddy Roosevelt's words, we salute  you.

Last I heard from Steve, they were not going to include the data center for the green tags.  However, commodity may be a different story.  Steve, can you verify if you want the data center as part of the commodity deal, and the usage?  I would assume that you want to include the data center on the commodity deal.  As far as EB 1 and 2, that's the rough approximation I had.  Steve probably has more exact usage if needed.

Stacy/Richard,

Is the data center (7210 Ardmore St.) going under the same deal?  It hasn't been part of the discussion so I'll assume no until I hear back.

Based on our last meeting I think it was estimated that EB 1 will use 28 million kWh/year, and when EB 2 will use 42.5 million kWh/year.  So a total of 70.5 million kWh/year.  Is this your understanding too?  

The data center, if included, looks like it uses about 6 million kWh/year.

Bob

Richard and I spoke with Bob Hansen yesterday to get status on the presentation pitch to you.  Bob said that he still needs to coordinate w/ Mary Jo on the accounting issue, but will have a presentation for you to look at by next Friday -- with price quotes scenarios depending on length of commodity deal and whether or not you participate in the pilot.  In addition, I've coordinated with Elliot Mainzer, Mike Curry and Michael Payne who will get you a quote for a 5 year REC term by week's end.
 
We should then set up a meeting to discuss the week of the 6th as a prelude to firming up the details and showing it to your boss.

Richard:

Richard Ring suggested that I contact you to try to determine some information that is required on our Disclosure Labels to customers and the PUCs in Massachusetts and Maine.  Please see below a sample label in Maine.  You will note the "Generation Price" section requires Price per kWh information for various usage levels.  Richard has in the past thrown together some numbers - he can explain how to you in further detail.  However, we believe there is a better way and that you can assist.

There will be two different types of labels in both states, dependent upon the customer size (a Mid Size contract vs. a Mini contract).  If you are indeed the person who can help me determine this type of information, I will send you the various labels for your assistance.  

These labels are required to be sent out with the initial contract and every quarter.  My next quarterly label deadline for both states is the end of September, but I would like to get the current rate on file for the labels we send out with the contracts.

Thank you.

In this case there is a product element because at least the 2 retail contracts I named require us to serve green. If we assume them, we have to have green to serve.

I thought the call on whether a contract is rejected was an economic call and not a product call.  If this is not the case then could we be forced to swallow the other discount off tariff contracts we  intend to reject?

Further, we need to know what the revenue is against this purchase to make a call on the economics.  

Richard - Do you have the Patagonia Contract? And/or any of the other green power transactions that EES has entered into with customer's?

Sounds like the economic justification for rejection is clear.  However, we need to be sure that we are not going to keep any customers where we have a contractual requirement to serve green power (Fetzer; Patagonia).  If we are comfortable that we are not, I think we can reject.

take a look at this. Unless there is a customer or regulatory reason to keep this, PPA, it would seem to me that we would want to reject this contract.

Thoughts/comments so we can proceed.

Murry,

Our forward curves show SP-15 power at $26.57/MWh for the period 02/01/2002-12/31/2002 (note that this does not include the discount for unit-contingency that usually accompanies wind power).  Green tags trade in the market for about $1.50/MWh.  Under the "Green Tickets Sales Agreement" it appears that EES has agreed to pay $39/MWh minus the market price of power, which is approximately $12/MWh for Green Tickets using our forward curves.

Let me know if you need any additional information.

Attached you will find two agreements EES has with ENRON Wind. 

1- Green Ticket Purchase Sale Agreement (PPA)
2- Scheduling Coordinator Service Agreement

With EES & ENA bankruptcy and the fact that Enron Wind has not been paid for the generation back to the month of November through current, Enron Wind is attempting to move their needs to APX for SC Services.  I also think they were looking for someone else to purchase their energy.  

I put a temporary stop on their actions but we are going to need to review these contracts to determine if we want to continue operating under them.

Please let me know your thoughts as soon as possible.

Thanks - MO

We have looked at our inventory of small hydro that was available during the
time we sold you the hydro resource in May and June of 1999.  We had more
than enough inventory of <30 MW hydro available for the time of the sale.
So you are welcome to use that label for the 50MW we sold you.  The
spreadsheet below contains the background information on the small hydro
inventory available at the time.  Hope this provides the additional
clarification you need to describe what we sold you.  Have a nice weekend.

Please call if you have any questions.  I would like to know what everyone wants to accomplish by this meeting.  I know that Richard and Elliot have constructed some "Renewable language" in a contract we are currently working.  We will bring the pricing with the $6.00 adder that Richard has suggested that we use for the power.

Thanks.  Can you get a bead on the relative value of the ETP and the non-performance penalties?

Mike,

The "deal" is between EESI and Riverside County Waste Management Department (RCWMC) is dated April 17, 2000 and the term commenced on Sepetmber 1, 2000 and ending on September 1, 2010.  Based on our bankruptcy filing RCWMD stopped delivery of power on December 6, 2001; RCWMD invoiced EESI for power production for September 2001, 0ctober 2001 and November 2001.  I do not know if they were ever paid by EESI.  I do not know of any invoice for the first six days of December 2001.

EESI (myself) and EPMI (Chris Foster) were in the process of renegotiating the above referenced agreement with the plan for EPMI to take over the purchase of power and scheduling services with EESI being the purchaser of the "green tickets"  from EPMI associated with the power production.  There were some major issues to overcome in the renegotiation regarding the "fixed price", "volume committments" and "penalties".  I do not know who, if anyone, is currently looking at this agreement to make any kind of determination EESI's and/or EPMI's desires for the future of this agreement.  

RCWMD sent various letters dated December 10, 2001, December 13, 2001, and January 8, 2002 requesting response from EESI.  The December 10, 2001 letter indicates that RCWMD considers the agreement terminated effective December 2, 2001.  I had previously spoke to you about this agreement in December 2001.  

It is my opinion that we should not continue this agreement and we should consider RCWMD's offer to terminate the agreement with the exchange of the non-performance panalties for the termination payment.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Regards,

Richard

Richard--what do you know about this deal?  Do you have paper on it?  Is this a purchase deal that we want?  Are we buying under it now?

The customer is pushing me to give them some answers.  Thanks.  MDS

Attached are drafts of (i) the Kinko's Electric Master, and (ii) the Transaction Agreement to be entered into with Kinko's for applicable Texas facilities.  Each of the enclosed documents has been "red-lined" against the most current version of the form from which it was originated.

Please note the following in connection with your review of the attached documents:

1.   Credit is still receiving information from Kinko's and the credit requirements have yet to be determined.  The standard credit language has been retained in Section 3.6 of the Master, but will probably be deleted or modified once the specific credit requirements are agreed upon.  As noted, specific credit terms will be included in the Transaction Agreement.

2.  The Transaction Agreement includes a "green" energy provision, under which EESI agrees to utilize renewable energy sources or obtain renewable energy credits, and to assign the associated environmental attributes to Kinko's.  The cost to EESI of the renewable energy credits will be reflected in the pricing.  The arrangement with respect to "green" power is also refered to in Section 2.8 of the Master.

3.  At Kinko's request, the right to terminate as a result of a "Change in Law" has been made mutual in Section 3.8 of the Master.  However, if Kinko's terminates, the Early Termination Payment is still determined under the methodology of Section 3.3 as if EESI were the Non-Defaulting Party.  

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments with respect to the attached documents.  We are hoping to send drafts out to Kinko's by tomorrow.

Paul

Well, I know you are interested in green/renewable energy programs and issues because you were at the conference in Portland.  So am I.  It seems that renewable energy is on the brink of reaching a "tipping point," or critical mass in its move into the mass culture (and utility strategic planning).  That is exciting and gratifying for the many people who have been working hard to make this happen.  

Although acquiring and increasing your supply of renewable power is still a challenge, the bigger, more pressing challenge, in our estimation, is selling it - how, who, where, when and for how much.  

So how far along are you, in getting your customers to think about, and buy green power?  Need some help?

We at Energy Market Solutions have been asking residential and business customers of utilities about green, renewable, and environmental issues for almost 5 years.  We can help you understand the dynamics of the customer perspective on these issues, including positioning and pricing a green program for success, communicating effective green messages, and the effects of green programs on your image and brand.

Call or email me to discuss how we can work with you on this exciting journey.

Richard,

I forgot one conversion:  To convert from MT of CO2, multiply by 1.1.02 to get to tons of CO2.  (The trees planted and miles driven are based on tons of CO2.)

Also, Catherine McKalip-Thompson is working on a spreadsheet with several conversions that might be helpful to you.  It should be complete in the next day or so.  While it might be too late for the letter going out this week, it may be useful to keep in your files for future reference.

Thanks,
Heather

Richard,

The California CO2 emissions factor is 0.343 MT CO2/MWh.  The source is below.  As I mentioned during our phone call, there is some debate over the appropriate emissions factor to use, given emission differences between peak/off-peak utility generation vs. purchases, etc.  However, most groups accept state level emissions factors as the best available.  Also, it is my understanding that the emissions factors are supposed to be revised sometime during 2000.  However, I haven't seen any announcements regarding the release of new numbers, nor did I see mention of it on the DOE Voluntary Reporting website.

 

I found a page on the Green Mountain web site that has conversions for trees planted and miles driven.  While it does not list a source for the conversions, I did notice that the numbers are the same as the ones used by the Environmental Law and Policy Center.  I will bring a copy of both by your desk.  Let me know if I can help with anything else.  FYI, in the past I've been a little hesitant to express GHG savings in terms of number of trees planted because of the difficulties involved in measuring the carbon absorbed by trees.  

- Heather

Roman - here's the list of up and running wind in the Northeast:

operating in New England: very little to work with, yet.
- Searsburg (VT); owned by Green Mountain Power; you should already have
the
contacts from EPA Chelmsford;
- Princeton Municipal Light Plant - small wind farm (10 x 40 kW turbines),
output of repowering of one of turbines already committed to a green
retailer; unlikely anything available, but contact is Jon Fitch,
jfitch@pmld.com, (978) 464-2815
- Endless Energy has put up two small turbines at customer locations in
Maine; used on-site.
- Burlington (VT) Electric Department has a small (50 kW) turbine part of
the generation mix of the utility not sure they would or could resell.

operating in NY:
- Weathersfield project (near Buffalo) - Ontario Power Generation has
contractual control of the green attributes: contact Murray Paterson @
(416)
592-4940, murray.paterson@ontariopowergeneration.com
- Fenner Project (near Syracuse) - developed by Atlantic Renewable Energy
Corp.; owned by CHI energy; contact Bill Moore at AREC @ (301) 407-0424,
Bill.moore@Atlantic-renewable.com (if you do, please let him know I sent
you).
- Madison Project (near Syracuse) - contact PG&E National Energy Group,
either Muir Davis (301) 280-6830, muir.davis@neg.pge.com; or Jane
Hotchkiss-Gordy, 203/453-6985 , JHGordy@snet.net

Under construction: Hull Municipal Light Plant, one 660kW turbine will be
up
by the end of Autumn.  Will be used to serve town load; have not in the
past
shown interest in selling ( I know green marketers who have approached them
and had no luck).

Has permits but not yet constructed: Berkshire Wind Project, western MA -
contact Dale Osborn, DisGen, @ (303) 674-2551, Daleosb@msn.com.

a few other projects are currently seeking permits.  Let me know if you are
interested.


Regards,

Bob Grace

Bob,

I had not received this previously ... thanks for passing it on.

I am looking for some one or some company or corp. who has up and running
wind power ... I would like to connect them with our current generation
provider.  any connections you could / would want me to get them talking,
please let me know.

thanks again for passing this on.

Comments I submitted to include recognition of tags in calculating fuel label for MI disclosure.  I didn't want the same thing to happen in MI as it has in NJ.

I'm hearing that ERCOT is backing off from ever invoking a fee for the REC program.   If you recall, ERCOT was going to take up this issue again at the end of year -- after initially suspending invoking any fees.  With the REC program up and going, ERCOT has determined that the fees to operate the program are not as high as initially projected.  We're hearing that in January they will likely permanently roll all the fees associated with running the REC program in with the overall market administration fees.   This is good news.
 
We need to keep a close eye on the transmission, though.  If there are transmission constraints and congestion getting the wind power from West Texas, this will likely bump up the cost.

All -
Wanted to make you aware of a couple of bills before the CA legislature that would place a renewable purchase obligation on all retail sellers in California if enacted.  The attached document provides a comparative analysis of both bills (which are quite similar in language) and the resulting commercial implications.   One bill in particular has momentum in that is it attached to the SCE bailout.  Jeff Dasovich and Sue Mara have their finger on the "pulse" on the movement of these bills, so as far as status please contact them.

I have not followed the REC program, but I have heard in the ERCOT CSC determination meeting that they (ERCOT) have concerns in west Texas due to the large amount of wind generation.  It is my understanding that last Friday a line tripped, due to the wind generation according to John Adams at ERCOT.
 
When you say keep an eye on transmission, what do you mean?

If you recall, ERCOT was going to take up this issue again at the end of year -- after initially suspending invoking any fees.  With the REC program up and going, ERCOT has determined that the fees to operate the program are not as high as initially projected.  We're hearing that in January they will likely permanently roll all the fees associated with running the REC program in with the overall market administration fees.   This is good news.
 
We need to keep a close eye on the transmission, though.  If there are transmission constraints and congestion getting the wind power from West Texas, this will likely bump up the cost.

Richard, attached are the most recent labels for Massachusetts.  If you could review when you get a chance -- I will be in on Wednesday, January 2 and Thursday, January 3 in the afternoon, maybe we can discuss changes at that time, unless we are no longer doing business in this state??

Thanks for your help.

Asset Management is in the process of updating site information and seeking documentation of  revenue meter testing at Green Power.  Marion did not know who I should request this information from and suggested that I start with EES.  

All the other projects have a stipulation in their agreements requiring utilities to undertake testing of their metering equipment to verify the accuracy of such equipment.  If testing reveals that the equipment is outside of a specified range, then the utility will calibrate the meter.  

I am looking to send a request for evidence or certification of such testing at Green Power.  Specifically, I need the contact information for the EES utility liaison or 
the person at the utility who is responsible for verifying metering accuracy at this site.

If you know of anyone who can assist with this matter, please forward their contact information to me.

Thanks

Hi Richard,

I wanted to touch base with you about the latest on the Green Power Market =
Development Group. I've attached the memo I sent them a couple of weeks ago=
. Last Friday, Mark Crowdis, who is coordinating on behalf of the group cal=
led me back and said that they want to see a formal proposal with notional =
pricing. Their members have operations across the country, and there may be=
 one or two of them who will want to enter into a Kinkoesque arrangement wi=
th physical deliver plus green tags, but I imagine that there will also be =
a significant contingent who will only want tags, or tags with embedded cal=
l options as outlined in the memo. We are also looking into developing a gr=
een tag product that looks like a swap against an index, as opposed to a fi=
xed price green tag with an out-of-the-money call. I think I have a pretty =
good handle on tag pricing here in the Pac Northwest and Texas. PacifiCorp =
power Marketing will probably sell me new wind tags in the $7-8 range, and =
we have a decent line on existing and new biomass in California. Looks like=
 Texas RECs will be clearing in the $6-7 range. How about the East? Does Co=
mmunity Energy sell their tags outside of their local region? How about the=
 biomass market in the East? As I mentioned this morning, I'm looking forwa=
rd to working on this issue in depth with you when I am in Houston in Septe=
mber, but I thought you might have a couple of pricing points for me at thi=
s point. Another angle I am going to mention is the Canadian angle, as many=
 of these companies probably have operations up there also. Have you ever h=
eard a thing about resources up there in the Tundra?=20

Although I imagine that we're going to be looking at pretty tight spreads o=
n these deals, they will hopefully create some liquidity as we move forward=
.
One other thing -- perhaps you can think of the names of a few key people a=
t EES that we should plan to meet with when I'm in H-town.

Thx,
EM

I wonder if this was the Minnesota project that developers like Community Energy are suspicious of them using the power for the green pricing program -- although they deny it.  It would be interesting to see how Excel is "advertising" their commodity purchase and if their customers are paying a premium.  I"ll do a little "sniffing" and see what I find out.

Good morning to you too, pardner.

Green Power Marketing Monthly  Update (NREL) - September  2001
Navitas Selling Wind Certificates
Navitas Energy, an independent power  producer and an affiliate ofwind  developer Northern Alternative Energy, is selling "WindWatts"green energy certificates on the Internet. Each  "green tagcertificate" represents one  megawatt-hour (MWh) of wind generationand is sold for $15, or 1.5?/kWh.  The certificates represent the
environmental attributes of the power  generated from two Minnesota-based wind projects commissioned in mid-1998: the  11.25-MW LakotaRidge project and the  11.88-MW Shaockatan Hills project.   
 
According to the State Energy Office, the  energy output of theprojects is being  purchased by Xcel Energy (formerly Northern StatesPower) to meet a legislative requirement to  build or contract for425 MW of wind power  by the end of 2001. Navitas claims that itretains the rights to the wind  energy attributes and only the
commodity energy is being sold to  Xcel.

Hello all!

I met with Diann Huddleson today and she clarified some issues for me regar=
ding the DASRing of customers in California.  Unfortunately it wasn't what =
we wanted to hear.

On the easy side of things, all residential customers (PGE, SCE, SDG&E) wer=
e turned back to the utilities starting May 30th (DASRs were submitted and =
they are cycling off now depending upon meter reading cycles, etc.)  These =
customers received a letter letting them know about it.

On the commercial side of things (Diann had no distinctions between small c=
ommercial & large commercial & industrial customers), SDG&E customers have =
been ours all along and have never been DASRed and reDASRed.  In PGE & SCE,=
 IBM behind PGE was also never put through the DASR process and has continu=
ously received our product.  All other PGE & SCE customers were originally =
submitted for DASRing back to the utilities on - January 31!!!!!  That prov=
ides enough issues of its own, but I'll get to that.  PGE did a virtual swi=
tch so as of Jan 31 all these customers became PGE's again, but with SCE, w=
hen a customer was switched depending upon meter reading cycles, etc.  All =
de-DASRed customers were then re-DASRed back to us starting June 21, and Di=
ann indicated that not only all of our old customers were re-DASRed, but ne=
w contracts were being executed and these new customers were also being DAS=
Red to us.  No communication about all of this has been sent to the custome=
rs, but as we discussed, some personal basis notice may have been given to =
our larger customers through the reps.

So - I'm not worried about the residential side - we'll have to send them a=
n annual historical label next April (with perhaps a letter explaining why =
they're still receiving info from us).  As far as the commercial/industrial=
 .......

1.  No notice was provided to probably the majority of the customers.
2.  They've been receiving system mix since Feb 1 and we've been proceeding=
 as if it were actually BIZMIX - i.e. the 2nd quarter labels they just rece=
ived indicated BIZMIX, as appropriate to the customer.
3.  What are the new customers (those as being DASRed to us the first time =
as of June 21) being told they are receiving?  Are they being marketed BIZM=
IX?
4.  As far as dates are concerned for reporting purposes, will we just use =
those given as the date of submission (i.e. Jan 31, May 30, June 21) as it =
is impossible to pinpoint when each individual customer transferred?

Let me know your input.

Heather

Um....yeah.


U.S., Japan Pursuing Space-Based Solar Power Systems

The National Space Development Agency of Japan, or
NASDA, has announced plans to develop a satellite-based
solar power system that would beam energy back to Earth. A
satellite carrying large solar panels would use a laser to
transmit the power to an airship at an altitude of about
12 miles, which would then transmit the power to Earth.
NASDA currently expects to develop the laser technologies
in the next 10 years and aims to conduct its first power
transmission test in 2025. See the NASDA Web site at:
<http://spaceboy.nasda.go.jp/note/kouso/E/kou106_solar_e.html>.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)
in the United States has been pursuing a similar approach,
although with less ambitious goals. A September review of
the NASA research by the National Research Council (NRC)
found the research worthwhile, although it noted that the
funding levels would have to be much higher to achieve its
goals. The review noted that "dramatic reductions" would be
needed in the cost of placing the system into Earth orbit and
in the cost of the solar panels, and that significant progress
is still needed in the technology to manage the power in
space and beam it back to Earth. See the NRC report at:
<http://www.nap.edu/books/0309075971/html/>.

The subject of space-based power has also been examined
by Resources for the Future (RFF), a Washington-based
group that studies energy and environmental policy. A report
issued last year suggested that space-based power would
have difficulty competing with land-based power sources,
and urged that economic analyses continue in tandem with
the technology development. However, a more promising
avenue was suggested in an October report, which
examined the concept of using a space-based power plant to
beam power to other space-based facilities. See the
"Discussion Papers" in the Space section of the RFF Library
at: <http://www.rff.org/nat_resources/space.htm>.

If those concepts aren't far enough into outer space for you,
consider this: wind energy might be a great energy option on
Mars. It turns out that solar power systems, which are
usually used for power in space, would be least effective
during Martian sand storms, when it's windy, of course. So a
wind and solar hybrid energy system might work best.
Similar systems operating in Alaska and Antarctica may
serve as models for these Martian power systems. See the
press release from the NASA Ames Research Center at:
<http://amesnews.arc.nasa.gov/releases/2001/01_72AR.html>.

Two questions that I could use answers for ASAP- 
1.  Approximately how many physical EES customers did we have in Mass prior to this summer (before the financial to physical switch took place)?
2.  When did the financial to physical switching start approximately - May? June?  Did anyone track which customers these were?

Thanks.

I thought the below would be meaningful for you all to see.  Has EWC set up a memorial fund for Nick?  I'd like to get back with Bob on where he can send condolences as well as our continued sponsorship of the NE Wind issues workshop.  I had encouraged Bob to touch base with Bob Gates, but also thought you guys might have suggestions.  I thought it might be a meaningful to provide EWC wind tags for the conference in Nick's honor as well.

Stacey - I am personally very saddened and shaken by Nick's demise.  I was
just starting to do a consulting job for Nick, and literally spent hours
crafting a scope of work, contracts, e-mails that I e-mailed to him
Wednesday, with the heading "I've been unable to reach you by phone, having
left a few messages over the past week, so let's try by e-mail."  To hear a
short time later that he had been on that plane.  Wow, that blew my mind.

But more importantly, Nick was a friend.  We had kayaked together on several
occasions, and had planned when I saw him last (8/30) over breakfast to meet
and kayak together as a regular thing.

He had told me at that time about having just dropped his son off for a
multi-week, back-country wilderness excursion in some remote canyon in the
Rockies (Utah?)... I don't know if his son even knows yet.  How awful.  Nick
lived near me, but I don't know of where his survivors are to be found (He
was divorced; I've met his brother, who lives in DC).  Are you aware of what
is being done in his memory, or where and to whom I could send a note of
condolence?

I am heading up the planning committee for  New England Regional Wind Power
Issues Workshop, to be held in Boston in late October.  Nick had volunteered
to speak, and offered Enron Wind to sponsor the event (which neither I nor
NREL, the organizer and primary event sponsor had yet followed up on).  As
Nick was involved in and supporting a number of regional wind development
efforts, and was well known in much of the local wind community, I think it
would be very appropriate to do something to honor his memory, associated
with the event (perhaps in connection with an Enron Wind sponsorship, if
they are still interested in doing so... I guess we'll have to bring it up
with Bob Gates?).  Your thoughts?


Regards,

Bob Grace

All -

I'm resending the below because I don't believe everyone received the
notification I sent on Monday.  In light of the tragic events of this
week, I think it would be better to wait until later next week to
organize a call.  I sincerely hope that all of your family, friends and
colleagues are accounted for.  Enron has suffered a great loss by losing
one of our Enron Wind directors, Nick Humber.  He was on the AA flight
from Boston.  I'm sure that many of you knew Nick or knew of him.

Elliot wants to have another conference call to discuss this weeks events. It seems that we've made some progress on several projects in the last few days. A suggestion was made that we schedule something around 1 PM pst tomorrow. That's 3pm on a Friday for you Houstonians?  Let me know if this doesn't work for anyone. Assuming there are no conflicts, I'll send a call-in number either this afternoon or early tomorrow.

Mary Jo,

New drafts of the Kinko's Master and TA will go out this afternoon.  The revised drafts will reflect revisions suggested by Richard Ring to the "green" energy provisions.  I would suggest that you wait and review the provisions in the revised drafts, and that you check with Richard to make sure they would be appropriate for the application you are considering. 

Please give me a call if you have any questions.  Thanks, Mary Jo.

Paul

Subject:	Kinko's Electric Master

Attached are drafts of (i) the Kinko's Electric Master, and (ii) the Transaction Agreement to be entered into with Kinko's for applicable Texas facilities.  Each of the enclosed documents has been "red-lined" against the most current version of the form from which it was originated.

Please note the following in connection with your review of the attached documents:

1.   Credit is still receiving information from Kinko's and the credit requirements have yet to be determined.  The standard credit language has been retained in Section 3.6 of the Master, but will probably be deleted or modified once the specific credit requirements are agreed upon.  As noted, specific credit terms will be included in the Transaction Agreement.

2.  The Transaction Agreement includes a "green" energy provision, under which EESI agrees to utilize renewable energy sources or obtain renewable energy credits, and to assign the associated environmental attributes to Kinko's.  The cost to EESI of the renewable energy credits will be reflected in the pricing.  The arrangement with respect to "green" power is also refered to in Section 2.8 of the Master.

3.  At Kinko's request, the right to terminate as a result of a "Change in Law" has been made mutual in Section 3.8 of the Master.  However, if Kinko's terminates, the Early Termination Payment is still determined under the methodology of Section 3.3 as if EESI were the Non-Defaulting Party.  

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments with respect to the attached documents.  We are hoping to send drafts out to Kinko's by tomorrow.

Paul

Mary, 

Jason Orta from the CEC called me to inform us that one of the generator numbers we had used was wrong. Sierra Pacific was listed as CEC 10016 and should actually have been 10036. I have made this correction in EPMI's CEC filing and resubmitted it. I have also made the correction on the "Proof of Purchase for Monthly Performance Reports" that you sent to me. I faxed the corrected version back to you at 713.646.2414. If you have any questions, let me know.

Regards,
Jesse

Elliott,

I apologize for sending this at the last minute, but wanted to see if you might be able to incorporate some information regarding the Energy Efficiency Credits Program Stacey and I have been working on in PA into your presentation for next week's Green Power meeting.  I have attached the latest draft (there are some minor changes that are not reflected) of the program proposal which we hope to have approved by the Green-e Board in September, and three power point slides.  I think we're made real headway in PA, and we hope to use this as a template for other states.  Please call Stacey or me if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Heather

Sorry that it has taken me so long to respond but we just migrated to "Outlook", which should be named "Outhouse" but nevertheless the states where EESI currently delivers physical power are:

Pennsylvania
Ohio
Maine
Massachusetts
Rhode Island
California
Texas
New York
New Hampshire

We are also looking at delivery capability in the near future within the following states:

Illinois
New Jersey
Maryland

Important to keep in mind that the physical delivery of electricity in all of the above cases may be limited to certain products and certain utilitity territories.

Richard

Hi Richard, 
I know this is an old question, but someone had asked if the utilities in Massachusetts were sending out Environmental Labels to the customers we supply energy to.  I confirmed with all three utilities and this is not the case, so we need to be sending those labels out.  John Milton at NSTAR said that they might be willing to work with us on this and maybe do a mailstuffer for us if we provide the labels; his phone number is 781-441-3499.  No one offered any help at the other utilities.

Alex

Hello all.  I need some help on this matter ASAP, as I must have the Maine label updated by August 30th and the Mass label updated by September 7th. 

Richard - in the past, I believe you had used historical information to come up with this number.  Is this to be historical price per kWh information?  If so, perhaps it is an Operational issue afterall.  I've included Sandy Cofer, our outside counsel who assists with this project.  Sandy - do you know if it is historical or projected? 

I appreciate anyone's assistance in this matter.

Thanks.

This is not an Operational issue.  This should be determined by the "Product Development" department.   Michelle Juden should be able to assist you with the correct person.

Subject:	Maine and Massachusetts Price per kWh Information

Richard:

Richard Ring suggested that I contact you to try to determine some information that is required on our Disclosure Labels to customers and the PUCs in Massachusetts and Maine.  Please see below a sample label in Maine.  You will note the "Generation Price" section requires Price per kWh information for various usage levels.  Richard has in the past thrown together some numbers - he can explain how to you in further detail.  However, we believe there is a better way and that you can assist.

There will be two different types of labels in both states, dependent upon the customer size (a Mid Size contract vs. a Mini contract).  If you are indeed the person who can help me determine this type of information, I will send you the various labels for your assistance.  

These labels are required to be sent out with the initial contract and every quarter.  My next quarterly label deadline for both states is the end of September, but I would like to get the current rate on file for the labels we send out with the contracts.

Thank you.

Calif Renewable Pwr Plant Owners Fight Edison Bankruptcy 
Updated: Wednesday, September 19, 2001 02:00 PM ET 
NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--A bankruptcy proceeding for Edison International's (EIX </investments/quotes/?symbol=EIX>, news </investments/news/?symbol=EIX>, msgs </investments/discuss/?symbol=EIX>) regulated utility subsidiary, Southern California Edison, would have severe negative consequences for the renewable energy community and for all Californians, an association of small, independent power producers in the state said. 
The Renewable Energy Creditors Committee said it was responding to media reports that other creditors are on the verge of forcing Edison into bankruptcy. 
"Such a filing would raise the cost of doing business in California for years to come," the group said in a press release. "Those who finance bonds to carry out capital improvements will place risk premiums on California projects, if it is demonstrated through the bankruptcy of both of the state's largest utilities that default on debt is an acceptable option." 
Members of the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee have already seen their costs of financing projects rise due to the continued uncertainty over more than $400 million in back payments that Edison owes committee members, the group said. For months, some committee members have been unable to pay some creditors and have faced increasing costs of debt. 
The committee called on state leaders to work out a financial alternative in the special session expected to be called by Gov. Gray Davis. 
In March, several members of the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee came close to initiating an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding against Edison, but a key court decision and the movement of some funds to the generators staved off the move. 
"The committee will not take action for now to force Edison into bankruptcy as long as a legislative solution to take care of back payments and encourage the use of renewable energy remains possible," the press release said. 
The Renewable Energy Creditors Committee is comprised of wind, solar, geothermal, biomass and landfill gas generators across California. Its members produce 3,000 megawatts of energy, enough to supply electricity to approximately 3 million homes. The committee members represent the vast majority of Edison's renewable energy supply, but they also provide electricity to PG&E.

Jenny,
 
I think the first starting point is to look at our existing EES customer base and divide those customers into different categories according to their potential willingness to purchase green power, with IBM and Johnson and Johnson (members of the Green PowerMarket Development Group) being signature potential green customers. Richard can probably help you find this list. I think we should then look at the membership of several major organizations -- the Business Council on Sustainable Development, the Pew Center on Climate Change, Environmental Defense for starters, to find some other high-profile companies with a stated committment to environmental protection. 
 
Jeff Shields will look at the large commercial and industrial customers targeted in Oregon as they are ENA, not EES target customers (Enron has an arbitrary SEC-code distinction for who ENA targets vs who EES targets and industrial customers are definitely ENA fodder). As for the other industrial accounts in other states, most of them are mines, aluminum smelters and that sort and are probably not our principal target audience.
 
Thx,
 
Elliot

Fetzer e-mailed me recently and wants to begin discussions on extending
their fixed price renewable power deal with us.

Their current fixed price expires in 5/02 with and index price going out to
2009.

If this is below your radar, Lamar I would be happy to work it with the
customer and Richard on the renewable energy side.

     ---------------


                  UCS Report Highlights Importance of RPS

     The Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) recently released a report
     showing how a diversified electricity mix including 20 percent
     renewable energy could save California consumers up to $1.8 billion
     and alleviate the disruptions in energy supply that have plagued
     Californians during the summer months.  The report, titled "Powering
     Ahead," analyzes the economic impacts of the renewable portfolio
     standard (RPS) in California.  Over 95 percent of California's
     current contracts for future energy production are committed to
     natural gas.

     Although the California state assembly was expected to consider RPS
     legislation this past week, action has been postponed until the
     weekend when the legislators are scheduled to complete this year's
     work.

     "California has experienced first-hand the dangers of a market
     dominated by volatile fossil fuels," said UCS senior analyst and
     report author Deborah Donovan.  "Now we have the hard numbers to
     prove renewable energy is beneficial for California's economic
     health."

     The state of Texas has implemented the most successful RPS to date,
     where requirements for new renewable generation capacity have been
     set high enough to create a strong market for renewable project
     development.  Natural gas prices in California have been extremely
     volatile with price hikes 10 to 20 times the historical average last
     year.

     However, in California the Department of Water Resources, which buys
     power for the state, uses a formula that makes it difficult for wind
     power to participate in the market and that has stunted investment
     in new wind power projects.

     UCS said that RPS are designed to help alleviate some of the burden
     created by state-by-state legislation which creates hurdles for the
     widespread adoption of renewable energies.  Additionally, RPS
     provides for the preservation of state jurisdiction over energy
     while making it easier for renewable energy technologies to
     penetrate the market.

                DOE Awards Funds for Bioenergy Development

     The Department of Energy (DOE) recently announced that it will
     invest $30 million over the next three to five years in 11 projects
     intended to develop process technology to create various products
     using plant matter and other natural waste materials.  Funds will
     also be used to establish university education and training programs
     in the area of bioproducts.

     "Producing marketable industrial products out of plants saves
     energy, saves nonrenewable resources and creates jobs," said DOE
     secretary Spencer Abraham.  "The bioenergy and bioproducts fields
     hold tremendous potential for environmentally desirable
     manufacturing and the creation of new jobs in the farm belt."

     DOE said it will provide $5 million for a project to develop the
     collection, commercial processing and utilization of corn stover.
     Partners in the project include Biomass Agri-Products, Iowa State
     University, Midwest Labs and Cargill Dow.  Private funding for
     the project will be $5 million.

     The agency noted that three education grants were awarded to
     establish multi-disciplinary education and training for graduate
     students in the area of bioproducts technologies.  The grants will
     help fund the establishment of "cross-cutting multi-disciplinary
     academic and research programs and provide stipends for deserving
     graduate students."

     DOE will also provide $7.3 million for a project focused on biomass
     biorefinery for production of polymers and fuel.  Partners in the
     project include Metabolix, Inc., the University of Tennessee,
     the University of Central Florida and the University of
     Massachusetts.

              BEF Grant Brings Solar Energy to Orcas Island

     The Bonneville Environmental Foundation (BEF) recently announced
     that it has provided a grant to help add four new solar sites to the
     Orcas Power and Light Cooperative (OPALCO) Green Power program
     headquartered in Friday Harbor, WA.

     The $37,000 provided by BEF enabled OPALCO to install solar panels
     at the Windermere Real Estate Building in Eastsound, WA, the Lopez
     (Island) Community Center, the Westsound Marina and the OPALCO
     office.  This combination of utility-owned and privately-owned sites
     will contribute an estimated 5,200 kilowatt hours (kWh) of
     electricity a year into the electricity grid, producing energy that
     is "natural and pollution-free" while helping the islands served by
     OPALCO to become more self sufficient.

     "The regional interest in solar energy has quickened considerably
     since BEF opened its doors in 1999," said BEF president Angus
     Duncan.  "OPALCO members have been among the first to show a high
     level of interest in power that is non-polluting."

     BEF said it is funding watershed projects that use solar power to
     pump water for cattle and irrigation while protecting streams. The
     group was founded in 1998 to fund new renewable energy resources and
     watershed restoration projects.  Although BEF maintains a strong
     collaborative relationship with the Bonneville Power
     Administration, they are separate organizations.

All - 
Lianne Lami and I would like to see if you all are available on Friday at 2:00 CDT to discuss potential EES environmental product offerings.   I believe that either Lianne or I (or both) have talked to you individually about the effort to roll out environmental products -- except for perhaps Jeff.  We'd like to have your participation,  Jeff, in regards to the load curtailment product offerings you are working on, and how this might fit with other offerings such as renewable energy certificates and tradable efficiency certificates (negawatts).
 
The strategy meeting should last about an 1 and 1/2 to 2 hours, and will be a chance to pool our respective resources to see what type of environmental product offerings we can create.  I'll gladly get us a team room on 47.  Please let me know if you're available.  Heather, I was planning to call you and hook you in.

Heather:
 
Frank Rishe, Government Affairs for MA, got a call from EES origination regarding your switching customers to physical delivery and disclosure requirements.  You'll most likely be getting a call as we let them know you handle the logistics for disclosure.  It would be helpful, though, to get a brief update on the status of MA customers and the disclosure label.  I'm assuming that the customers being switch to physical delivery already have a label with their contract, and are on the list to receive a quarterly label.  Is this correct?  
 
Also, I have a copy of the label that was for 9/1/00 to 5/31/04.  Is this the latest label?   Thanks so much for your help.

Elliot wants to have another conference call to discuss this weeks events. It seems that we've made some progress on several projects in the last few days. A suggestion was made that we schedule something around 1 PM pst tomorrow. That's 3pm on a Friday for you Houstonians?  Let me know if this doesn't work for anyone. Assuming there are no conflicts, I'll send a call-in number either this afternoon or early tomorrow.
Cheers,
Jesse

Hello again.  Based upon our outside counsel's interpretation below and what Richard did last time, this needs to be a historical price, based upon what we've done in the past.  Is this now an operational issue?  Someone will have to help me with this, as I have no idea.  Basically, I need to get an price per kWh for the various classifications on the label that Enron charged for the past month/quarter.  There seems to be some room for estimation however.  Whoever's role this falls under can e-mail me or call me at x39006 for more information.

Subject:	Re: Maine and Massachusetts Price per kWh Information


By quickly wading back through the regs (a bit murky), my understanding is that the average price reported on the disclosure labels is historical, although an estimate can be used (is that what you meant by projected, or were you thinking of the price going forward?).

Specifically:

In MA, the regulation requires that CRES Providers report an average unit price in cents per kWh for "service tied to spot or other variable prices that would have been charged in the last month of the prior quarter".  See 220 CMR 11.06(2)(1)(a)(c)  Although the price looks back to the last month of the prior quarter, the "would have been charged" language suggests that an estimate can be used.

In ME, "service based on spot or other variable prices shall be shown based on the average prices that would have been charged in the prior month"  also reported on an average unit price in cents per kWh. See MPUC 65-407-306(2)(a)(iii).  Note that ME uses the same "would have been charged" language.

Hope that helps.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Hello all.  I need some help on this matter ASAP, as I must have the Maine label
updated by August 30th and the Mass label updated by September 7th.

Richard - in the past, I believe you had used historical information to come up
with this number.  Is this to be historical price per kWh information?  If so,
perhaps it is an Operational issue afterall.  I've included Sandy Cofer, our
outside counsel who assists with this project.  Sandy - do you know if it is
historical or projected?

I appreciate anyone's assistance in this matter.

Thanks.

Subject:  Maine and Massachusetts Price per kWh Information

Richard:

Richard Ring suggested that I contact you to try to determine some information
that is required on our Disclosure Labels to customers and the PUCs in
Massachusetts and Maine.  Please see below a sample label in Maine.  You will
note the "Generation Price" section requires Price per kWh information for
various usage levels.  Richard has in the past thrown together some numbers - he
can explain how to you in further detail.  However, we believe there is a better
way and that you can assist.

There will be two different types of labels in both states, dependent upon the
customer size (a Mid Size contract vs. a Mini contract).  If you are indeed the
person who can help me determine this type of information, I will send you the
various labels for your assistance.

These labels are required to be sent out with the initial contract and every
quarter.  My next quarterly label deadline for both states is the end of
September, but I would like to get the current rate on file for the labels we
send out with the contracts.

Thank you.

Heather,

EESI only deliveres physical energy to customers in Ohio behind "First Energy" and only through the "MSG" program.  There should be no difference between the "projected" and "actual" labels for Columbus Southern.

Regards,

Richard

Subject:	Ohio Disclosure Labels

June 1 is fast approaching, and as I understand it, we are responsible for providing actual versus projected label information in the state of Ohio.  I know that the projected labels have been completed, and now I must gather the actual information for first quarter of 2001.  It is my understanding that FE/MSG will be providing us this information on actuals for the customers we have there, but who provides the info for Columbus Southern?  If I am incorrect in any of these assumptions, please let me know.  Thank you for your assistance on this matter.

Heather

Jennifer,
 
Sorry, I lost track of your message.  I am not aware of anyone at EESI compiling any sort of information regarding green power offerings by any competitors.

Elliot asked me to pull together some competitive intelligence re: green power product offerings (including retailers, marketers/wholesalers and developers).  Before I start researching, I wanted to check with you to see if you know if anyone at EES has already done this kind of analysis.
 
Thanks, 
 
Jenny

Lamar:

Fetzer spends about $700,000 per year on electricity.

Natural Gas is negligble about 100,000 therms annually.

Fetzer is an organic farm and winery.

Richard:
 
Wanted to give you a heads up that there is a strong likelihood that CA will enact an RPS, requiring retail providers to include up to 10% of NEW renewable resources to customers.  The proposed RPS begins on 6/1/2003 and ramps up over the following 7 years.  By 2010, the requirement will be 10 percent.  Since EES is currently signing on customers in California, this might effect the length of contract you want to offer (i.e. limiting contracts to 3 to 5 years would mitigate your potential exposure). 
 
Please pass this along to Rogers et. al. so you guys can let the folks out in the field know.
 
Thanks.

This is the only EES Label I have for this round (Mid-10.01).  Is this the GSA label or the other customer label?  Let me know so I can make sure to send the correct ones & number to CSC.

PS - I also left a message with Frank Simonetta at CSC to see who the GSA label is being sent to.

Yes they do - the auto reminder system sends this particular message for every label, for instance, California as well.  I'm working on changing & updating certain aspects of it to indicate different types of labels.

Hello all!

I met with Diann Huddleson today and she clarified some issues for me regar=
ding the DASRing of customers in California.  Unfortunately it wasn't what =
we wanted to hear.

On the easy side of things, all residential customers (PGE, SCE, SDG&E) wer=
e turned back to the utilities starting May 30th (DASRs were submitted and =
they are cycling off now depending upon meter reading cycles, etc.)  These =
customers received a letter letting them know about it.

On the commercial side of things (Diann had no distinctions between small c=
ommercial & large commercial & industrial customers), SDG&E customers have =
been ours all along and have never been DASRed and reDASRed.  In PGE & SCE,=
 IBM behind PGE was also never put through the DASR process and has continu=
ously received our product.  All other PGE & SCE customers were originally =
submitted for DASRing back to the utilities on - January 31!!!!!  That prov=
ides enough issues of its own, but I'll get to that.  PGE did a virtual swi=
tch so as of Jan 31 all these customers became PGE's again, but with SCE, w=
hen a customer was switched depending upon meter reading cycles, etc.  All =
de-DASRed customers were then re-DASRed back to us starting June 21, and Di=
ann indicated that not only all of our old customers were re-DASRed, but ne=
w contracts were being executed and these new customers were also being DAS=
Red to us.  No communication about all of this has been sent to the custome=
rs, but as we discussed, some personal basis notice may have been given to =
our larger customers through the reps.

So - I'm not worried about the residential side - we'll have to send them a=
n annual historical label next April (with perhaps a letter explaining why =
they're still receiving info from us).  As far as the commercial/industrial=
 .......

1.  No notice was provided to probably the majority of the customers. [Bolt=
on, Stacey]  We (or PR) should prepare a customer letter as discussed with =
Peggy, notifying them that they are no longer receiving Bizmix ASAP.
2.  They've been receiving system mix since Feb 1 and we've been proceeding=
 as if it were actually BIZMIX - i.e. the 2nd quarter labels they just rece=
ived indicated BIZMIX, as appropriate to the customer. [Bolton, Stacey]   W=
e should look into purchasing green tags to make these customers whole if w=
e will be more than 5% off of our projection v. what we actually delivered.=
  The regs allow for discrepancies between projections and actual, and you =
don't have to show an extra column w/ the difference if you are w/in 5% del=
ta band between projection and actual..  We can change the projection for t=
hird quarter and include this information in the customer letter.=20
3.  What are the new customers (those as being DASRed to us the first time =
as of June 21) being told they are receiving?  Are they being marketed BIZM=
IX? [Bolton, Stacey]   We should ensure this is not the case with originati=
on.  Someone in Jeremy B.'s shop will most likely know.=20
4.  As far as dates are concerned for reporting purposes, will we just use =
those given as the date of submission (i.e. Jan 31, May 30, June 21) as it =
is impossible to pinpoint when each individual customer transferred? [Bolto=
n, Stacey]   We should discuss this a bit.  I'm not sure that this will rea=
lly matter at the end of the day.  The CEC has instructed us all along to s=
end labels to the customers, which we have.  We'll report the purchases (br=
own and green) as normal at the end of the year.=20

Let me know your input.

Heather

Nice tradeoff...


Xcel Energy Provides $10 Million for Renewable Energy

Xcel Energy announced last week that it chose eight
Minnesota renewable energy projects to receive nearly
$10 million in funding. More than $5 million will fund a
hydropower facility at St. Anthony Falls in Minneapolis. The
remaining funds will go toward two projects to convert cow
manure and solid and liquid waste from the corn and pea
canning process into methane for power production, one
project to produce power from methane that is currently
being wasted at a corn processing plant, one rebate program
for grid-connected solar power systems, one solar power
system on the roof of the Science Museum of Minnesota,
one wind turbine installation at a school, and the installation
of six wind turbines of a new design.

The projects are funded by the state's Renewable
Development Fund, to which Xcel Energy must contribute
$500,000 annually for each nuclear-spent-fuel cask stored
outside the Prairie Island nuclear plant after January 1st,
1999. The fund currently amounts to more than $16 million.
The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission must approve
Xcel Energy's choice of projects. See the company's press
release at:
<http://www.xcelenergy.com/NewsRelease/newsRelease110501.asp>.

FYI
 
***NEW and IMPROVED SITE - National Database of State Incentives for Renewable Energy (DSIRE)
 
The National Database of State Incentives for Renewable Energy (DSIRE), has updated and moved its Web site to www.dsireusa.org. The database, funded by the U.S. Department of Energy's Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC) and managed by North Carolina Solar Center, is a clearinghouse of all existing programs to help encourage private efforts to convert to renewable energy sources (solar, water, and wind power). This new, user-friendly database is a must-see for anyone interested in tracking state and local renewable energy initiatives. The chart-driven site provides a variety of useful tools, including current and accurate information on incentives, programs, and policies, as well as access to documentation and legislation of state and local governments.
 
DSIRE's new Web site has been redesigned to include full text searching, incentive summary maps, new/updated incentives links, incentive descriptions, state-by-state reports, and related links. Various incentives include grants, rebates, loans, personal tax incentives, corporate tax incentives, sales tax incentives, property tax incentives, industry recruitment, and leasing and sales programs for utilities companies. Recently, schools have been utilizing solar power through these programs, with Texas hosting a number of projects. This new, user-friendly database is a must-see for anyone interested in tracking state and local renewable energy initiatives.
 
For more information about what DSIRE has to offer, see its Web site at: www.dsireusa.org

You're welcome.  Hope I see you on Monday.  My understanding is that surpri=

Richard- I am talking with Larry at Kinko's today at 4 pm to address the comments he has outlined in the file below
I need your help in addressing his change of language request (see 2.8 Last few sentences under Contractual comments)
He does not want us to keep the potential credits from green power-see his comment on page 2 of document below
Can you help me address this with him? 
Please give me a call - I don't think it is necessary for you to have to sit thru the call with us this afternoon on all other comments
thanks
Kay

Subject:	Re: 1 year pricing


Kay,
Thanks for the one year proposal. It will be beneficial in moving our decision process forward.

I have attached Kinko's comments to the Enron Sales Agreeement for power in TX. I have divided the comments into three separate sections: Administrative, Contractual and Clarification Questions/Comments. At first glance it might seem like a lot, but once you get a chance to review it, you will see there are really only a handful of issues we need to iron out. I will give you a couple days to review it, then I would like to try and set-up a conference call some time later this week with both of our Legal Departments involved.

Thanks for your help to date, and I'm looking forward to making this agreement beneficial for both our firms.

Take Care,
lr

>>> "Kay Quigley" <kquigley@enron.com> 09/07 3:06 PM >>>


Larry, I have revised pricing behind all 4 utilities to reflect a one year term.
Please keep in mind that the shopping credits or PTB are estimates- these
numbers
will not be finalized for these utilities until early October. Since we are now
talking an October
close date, we cannot start services until Dec. which will only give you a one
month discount.
I would recommend we just price the deal assuming no discount (might be lower
fixed gen rate)
and just start services 1/1/02.
I would rather not refresh the 3 year pricing unless you really need it because
it makes more
sense for us to do it when we are ready to execute. You can just assume the
pricing I sent to
you 8/20 is about a $1.00 Mwh lower than what is shown for fixed gen.
Thanks
Kay

Kay,
Thanks for this information. It will be useful. My our VP of Purchasing, my boss is going to Europe for 2.5 weeks starting next Wednesday. She has asked me to prepare a deck for our new CEO, a native Texan, on this deal. So, I'm now thinking we could get the deal done early October, and start getting services from Enron in November.

I will be forwarding comments on the terms on Friday.
Thanks again,
lr

Larry, got your voice mail and have attached several slides we use in presenting
our Texas products.
Please review these to see if they meet your needs internally. Due to the volume
of customers that are
locking in fixed rates due to the low gas prices, unfortunately I do not have
time to further search historical pricing.
I am also working on the refreshed proposals you need for 1 and 3 year terms. I
should have this tomorrow for you.
In addition your comment about your legal group having 'a number of comments on
our terms' does alarm me
due to the time and resources already expended on getting both our parties
comfortable with the risks. Please
let me know if we can just wrap this up with my manager and 1 legal person on a
conference call.
What is our new expected close date for this transaction?
Let me know.
Kay

Subject:=09CA BIZMIX Issues

Hello all!

I met with Diann Huddleson today and she clarified some issues for me regar=
ding the DASRing of customers in California.  Unfortunately it wasn't what =
we wanted to hear.

On the easy side of things, all residential customers (PGE, SCE, SDG&E) wer=
e turned back to the utilities starting May 30th (DASRs were submitted and =
they are cycling off now depending upon meter reading cycles, etc.)  These =
customers received a letter letting them know about it.

On the commercial side of things (Diann had no distinctions between small c=
ommercial & large commercial & industrial customers), SDG&E customers have =
been ours all along and have never been DASRed and reDASRed.  In PGE & SCE,=
 IBM behind PGE was also never put through the DASR process and has continu=
ously received our product.  All other PGE & SCE customers were originally =
submitted for DASRing back to the utilities on - January 31!!!!!  That prov=
ides enough issues of its own, but I'll get to that.  PGE did a virtual swi=
tch so as of Jan 31 all these customers became PGE's again, but with SCE, w=
hen a customer was switched depending upon meter reading cycles, etc.  All =
de-DASRed customers were then re-DASRed back to us starting June 21, and Di=
ann indicated that not only all of our old customers were re-DASRed, but ne=
w contracts were being executed and these new customers were also being DAS=
Red to us.  No communication about all of this has been sent to the custome=
rs, but as we discussed, some personal basis notice may have been given to =
our larger customers through the reps.

So - I'm not worried about the residential side - we'll have to send them a=
n annual historical label next April (with perhaps a letter explaining why =
they're still receiving info from us).  As far as the commercial/industrial=
 .......

1.  No notice was provided to probably the majority of the customers. [Bolt=
on, Stacey]  We (or PR) should prepare a customer letter as discussed with =
Peggy, notifying them that they are no longer receiving Bizmix ASAP.
2.  They've been receiving system mix since Feb 1 and we've been proceeding=
 as if it were actually BIZMIX - i.e. the 2nd quarter labels they just rece=
ived indicated BIZMIX, as appropriate to the customer. [Bolton, Stacey]   W=
e should look into purchasing green tags to make these customers whole if w=
e will be more than 5% off of our projection v. what we actually delivered.=
  The regs allow for discrepancies between projections and actual, and you =
don't have to show an extra column w/ the difference if you are w/in 5% del=
ta band between projection and actual..  We can change the projection for t=
hird quarter and include this information in the customer letter.=20
3.  What are the new customers (those as being DASRed to us the first time =
as of June 21) being told they are receiving?  Are they being marketed BIZM=
IX? [Bolton, Stacey]   We should ensure this is not the case with originati=

OK then, from what I understand then, this label will be good to go for insertion with the CG&E contracts.  Nicole, go ahead and use this one with the contract.  (PLEASE NOTE - I have changed this to 2002 projections since you won't be physical until Feb 2002 now.  Let me know if this is an incorrect assumption.)

We will be serving physical in CG&E territory beginning in Feb. 2002 (this was jut pushed back from Dec. 2001).  Origination will begin preselling beginning this week.  Therefore, on the Disclosure Label, which we would present to customers along with contracts between now and Feb., are we ok with stating "Unknown Purchases" and then change that once we're not buying on the spot market?

Thanks

Subject:	RE: Ohio Label

Heather,

To the best of my knowledge the only customers in Ohio where physical delivery "CURRENTLY" takes place is First Energy (MSG PRODUCT ONLY) and the First Energy utilities should be directly providing the Disclosure Labels or provide load serving entities with the information necessary to complete the Disclosure Labels.  Physical delivery of power, other than MSG PRODUCT, may occur between November 2001 and March 2002; in either event Disclosure Labels need to be submitted to customers with the initial contracts and not again until immediately prior to physical delivery of power.

In all likelihood, spot purchases of power, rather than specific purchases of power, will occur therefore the Disclosure Label "can only" contain Unknown Purchases, as described by Stacey Bolton.  

Heather, I think that the three of us (you, Stacey and myself) need to discuss proper procedures regarding Disclosure Labels.

Richard

Heather,

We are not delivering any power, other than Market Support Generation (MSG), which is provided by the First Energy utility companies.  It should either be the utilities that provide disclosure label information for our label we have to default to "Unknown Purchases" or whatever else is allowed/required by the Ohio PUC's.

We need to start sending our Ohio label with the contract to new Ohio customers (CG&E starting in Dec according to Nicole Schwartz).  I've had Sandy Cofer look over this one that was done by Allison way back when to see if it still meets requirements, and it does.  Can you confirm the fuel mixes, etc. for me?

Thanks.

We're coming down to the final wire on the Green-eT-RECs standard.  Below i=
s a synopsis of the outstanding issues.  I wanted to get your thought about=
 the following the options.  I agree with staff that choice #1 is ideal.  M=
y second choice is #3.  The issue is this: Each of the regions has slightly=
 different to dramatically different definitions for eligible resources for=
 a Green-e certified electricity product.  In order to have a national stan=
dard whereby a marketer can market the same product across the states, staf=
f has proposed certifying generators per region.  These generators would be=
 certified according to that region's standard.  The T-RECS could then be m=
arketed anywhere.  Some folks want to control not only the generators that =
are certified, but the products that are sold in their region.  Thus the op=
tion for the highest common denominator (choice #2).  I think we need to go=
 with the most administratively simple method that will promote the most li=
quidity.  Certifying generator or creating a separate T-RECs standard seem =
to be the easiest.

Let me know your thoughts.  I'd like to get back with Meredith today.  Also=
, these issues are pretty nebulous -- so call if you have ?s.

Folks,=20
As you know, at our last meeting, I promised to circulate the different  op=
tions we discussed on generator -based sourcing standards. =20
=20
The  problem we are trying to solve is this:  We'd like to develop a nation=
al  definition for "eligible" renewables  for certification of   T-RECs pro=
ducts under Green-e.  The problem is that if we did a  highest common denom=
inator standard, some renewables, namely biomass would be  excluded.  We fe=
el that this would be a somewhat arbitrary exclusion  because biomass has b=
een excluded from some regional standards because of  specific regional cir=
cumstances and that it would not be fair to penalize the  entire biomass in=
dustry by eliminating it from the T-RECs - Green-e  market.
=20
So  staff have proposed a generator based sourcing standard.  Eligibility w=
ould thus apply to renewable  generators, not marketers.  So if a generator=
 qualified, they would-be  able to market their T-RECs anywhere in the US. =
 The general feedback I got  from you was that people didn't like this idea=
 because (1) it wasn't clear for  the consumer what types of eligible are a=
llowed under Green-e cert. (e.g.  Georgia biomass excluded, but PA biomass =
allowed) and (2) effectively gave  marketers the ability to sell a type of =
power into a market that might not meet  the regional definition of eligibl=
e, (e.g. you could sell forestry-derived  biomass generated in New England =
into the PA market - the generator would  meet the new England definition f=
or eligible and therefore would be able to sell  that power anywhere.)
=20
We discussed a couple of different  options for handling this dilemma.  Her=
e are a few of the major pros an  cons.  =20
1.       Adopt a single  generator-based sourcing standard for electricity =
and T-RECs (this was the  proposal by staff)
 pros: it is consistent b/t  electricity and T-RECs products, and it allows=
 for regional definitions of  eligibility;=20
cons: not clear for the consumer what types  of eligible are allowed under =
Green-e cert.;  effectively gives  marketers the ability to sell a type of =
power into a market that might not  meet the regional definition of eligibl=
e
=20
2.       Don't change electricity  standards (keep definition of "eligible"=
 renewable as regional product standard)  but have a  T-RECs standard that =
is based on the highest common denominator  of all regional Green-e/Green p=
ricing standards. A highest common  denominator standard would include sola=
r, wind, digester gas, and possibly LIHI  hydro, geothermal landfill methan=
e with some NOx limits.  I say  "possibly" because these things aren't incl=
uded in green  pricing eligibility criteria but we think we might be able t=
o convince  stakeholders there to accept them.
Pros: Meets both regional definitions for  what is generated in a state and=
 what is marketed in a state
Cons: inconsistent  standard b/t electricity products and T-RECs products; =
eliminates  biomass and possibly other renewables from eligibility for  T-R=
ECs
=20
3.       Don't change electricity  standard but develop a new national defi=
nition for what T-RECs are "eligible"  (this would not necessarily be a hig=
hest common denominator standard, but more  of a "generally accepted renewa=
ble" standard)
Pros: Doesn't change electricity standard; makes it clear for consumers  wh=
at's in a Green-e certified product
Cons: potentially inconsistent standard b/t electricity products  and T-REC=
s products; could undermine regional standards if something is  approved as=
 eligible for T-RECs but it is not eligible for  electricity.
=20
4.       keep product standard  for both electricity and for T-RECs; requir=
e both electricity providers and  T-RECs providers to meet the regional  de=
finitions.
Pros: Meets both regional definitions for  what is generated in a state and=
 what is marketed in a state
Cons: requires T-RECs marketers to market  different products for different=
 regions- could prevent them from seeking  certification; inconsistent stan=
dard b/t electricity products and T-RECs  products
Please send me your  feedback on these different options. We did have an op=
tion 5, but upon  reflection, it appeared to me to be the same as one of th=
e other options.   if this isn't enough selection for you, feel free to add=
 you own option too!

been ours all along and have never been DASRed and reDASRed.  In PGE & SCE,=
 IBM behind PGE was also never put through the DASR process and has continu=
ously received our product.  All other PGE & SCE customers were originally =
submitted for DASRing back to the utilities on - January 31!!!!!  That prov=
ides enough issues of its own, but I'll get to that.  PGE did a virtual swi=
tch so as of Jan 31 all these customers became PGE's again, but with SCE, w=
hen a customer was switched depending upon meter reading cycles, etc.  All =
de-DASRed customers were then re-DASRed back to us starting June 21, and Di=
ann indicated that not only all of our old customers were re-DASRed, but ne=
w contracts were being executed and these new customers were also being DAS=
Red to us.  No communication about all of this has been sent to the custome=
rs, but as we discussed, some personal basis notice may have been given to =
our larger customers through the reps.

So - I'm not worried about the residential side - we'll have to send them a=
n annual historical label next April (with perhaps a letter explaining why =
they're still receiving info from us).  As far as the commercial/industrial=
 .......

1.  No notice was provided to probably the majority of the customers. [Bolt=
on, Stacey]  We (or PR) should prepare a customer letter as discussed with =
Peggy, notifying them that they are no longer receiving Bizmix ASAP.
2.  They've been receiving system mix since Feb 1 and we've been proceeding=
 as if it were actually BIZMIX - i.e. the 2nd quarter labels they just rece=
ived indicated BIZMIX, as appropriate to the customer. [Bolton, Stacey]   W=
e should look into purchasing green tags to make these customers whole if w=
e will be more than 5% off of our projection v. what we actually delivered.=
  The regs allow for discrepancies between projections and actual, and you =
don't have to show an extra column w/ the difference if you are w/in 5% del=
ta band between projection and actual..  We can change the projection for t=
hird quarter and include this information in the customer letter.=20
3.  What are the new customers (those as being DASRed to us the first time =
as of June 21) being told they are receiving?  Are they being marketed BIZM=
IX? [Bolton, Stacey]   We should ensure this is not the case with originati=
on.  Someone in Jeremy B.'s shop will most likely know.=20
4.  As far as dates are concerned for reporting purposes, will we just use =
those given as the date of submission (i.e. Jan 31, May 30, June 21) as it =
is impossible to pinpoint when each individual customer transferred? [Bolto=
n, Stacey]   We should discuss this a bit.  I'm not sure that this will rea=
lly matter at the end of the day.  The CEC has instructed us all along to s=
end labels to the customers, which we have.  We'll report the purchases (br=
own and green) as normal at the end of the year.=20

Let me know your input.

I'm writing to invite you to a meeting on August 16 to discuss origination =
and trading opportunities in the renewable power sector. On April 1, we est=
ablished the Renewable Power Desk under the umbrella of West Power Trading =
and West Origination here in Portland. The Desk was established to apply En=
ron's power marketing and development expertise to the growing market for g=
reen power in the WSCC. Within 6 weeks we closed our first deal (a five yea=
r fixed-price sale of energy and renewable energy credits worth several mil=
lion dollars) and I am very excited about the opportunities in this market =
nationwide. I've spent a lot of time during the last several months establi=
shing contacts with the key developers and marketers in the renewable power=
 market, and Stacey Bolton of Enron's Environmental Strategies Group has ga=
rnered a very solid understanding of the regulatory environment and supply/=
demand dynamics in markets across the country. When you combine Enron's ski=
lls in the wholesale market with our huge customer base at EES and the incr=
easing level of green power committments in the public and private sectors,=
 it becomes readily apparent that Enron is poised to be a major player and =
market-maker in the renewable power sector.

I would like to meet with you and other representatives of Enron's trading =
and origination groups on Thursday, August 16 from 12-3 to discuss a coordi=
nated commercial response to the renewable power market on a nationwide bas=
is.  Lunch will be served. Please let Stacey or me know ASAP if you or a de=
signate from your group will be able to attend.  We will contact you with a=
 follow-up call/e-mail the week of August 6th with a room location and agen=
da, and hope you will be able to attend.

This is not an Operational issue.  This should be determined by the "Product Development" department.   Michelle Juden should be able to assist you with the correct person.

Hope this helps, Richard

Subject:	Maine and Massachusetts Price per kWh Information

Richard:

Richard Ring suggested that I contact you to try to determine some information that is required on our Disclosure Labels to customers and the PUCs in Massachusetts and Maine.  Please see below a sample label in Maine.  You will note the "Generation Price" section requires Price per kWh information for various usage levels.  Richard has in the past thrown together some numbers - he can explain how to you in further detail.  However, we believe there is a better way and that you can assist.

There will be two different types of labels in both states, dependent upon the customer size (a Mid Size contract vs. a Mini contract).  If you are indeed the person who can help me determine this type of information, I will send you the various labels for your assistance.  

These labels are required to be sent out with the initial contract and every quarter.  My next quarterly label deadline for both states is the end of September, but I would like to get the current rate on file for the labels we send out with the contracts.

Thank you.

Heather Mathis
Legal Department

spite the fund being depleted) to overpayment/accounting issues with other =
entities.  This also has to do w/ the time lapse between filing for reimbur=
sement for 3 months prior (i.e. I don't think Richard anticipated getting p=
aid for some of January's purchases because technically the fund ran out in=
 December).  There is definitely not enough money to continue buying going =
forward in the C&I fund.  It might be replenished next January provided dir=
ect access goes through. =20

Hello all!

I met with Diann Huddleson today and she clarified some issues for me regar=
ding the DASRing of customers in California.  Unfortunately it wasn't what =
we wanted to hear.

On the easy side of things, all residential customers (PGE, SCE, SDG&E) wer=
e turned back to the utilities starting May 30th (DASRs were submitted and =
they are cycling off now depending upon meter reading cycles, etc.)  These =
customers received a letter letting them know about it.

On the commercial side of things (Diann had no distinctions between small c=
ommercial & large commercial & industrial customers), SDG&E customers have =
been ours all along and have never been DASRed and reDASRed.  In PGE & SCE,=
 IBM behind PGE was also never put through the DASR process and has continu=
ously received our product.  All other PGE & SCE customers were originally =
submitted for DASRing back to the utilities on - January 31!!!!!  That prov=
ides enough issues of its own, but I'll get to that.  PGE did a virtual swi=
tch so as of Jan 31 all these customers became PGE's again, but with SCE, w=
hen a customer was switched depending upon meter reading cycles, etc.  All =
de-DASRed customers were then re-DASRed back to us starting June 21, and Di=
ann indicated that not only all of our old customers were re-DASRed, but ne=
w contracts were being executed and these new customers were also being DAS=
Red to us.  No communication about all of this has been sent to the custome=
rs, but as we discussed, some personal basis notice may have been given to =
our larger customers through the reps.

So - I'm not worried about the residential side - we'll have to send them a=
n annual historical label next April (with perhaps a letter explaining why =
they're still receiving info from us).  As far as the commercial/industrial=
 .......

1.  No notice was provided to probably the majority of the customers. [Bolt=
on, Stacey]  We (or PR) should prepare a customer letter as discussed with =
Peggy, notifying them that they are no longer receiving Bizmix ASAP.
2.  They've been receiving system mix since Feb 1 and we've been proceeding=
 as if it were actually BIZMIX - i.e. the 2nd quarter labels they just rece=
ived indicated BIZMIX, as appropriate to the customer. [Bolton, Stacey]   W=
e should look into purchasing green tags to make these customers whole if w=
e will be more than 5% off of our projection v. what we actually delivered.=
  The regs allow for discrepancies between projections and actual, and you =
don't have to show an extra column w/ the difference if you are w/in 5% del=
ta band between projection and actual..  We can change the projection for t=
hird quarter and include this information in the customer letter.=20
3.  What are the new customers (those as being DASRed to us the first time =
as of June 21) being told they are receiving?  Are they being marketed BIZM=
IX? [Bolton, Stacey]   We should ensure this is not the case with originati=
on.  Someone in Jeremy B.'s shop will most likely know.=20
4.  As far as dates are concerned for reporting purposes, will we just use =
those given as the date of submission (i.e. Jan 31, May 30, June 21) as it =
is impossible to pinpoint when each individual customer transferred? [Bolto=
n, Stacey]   We should discuss this a bit.  I'm not sure that this will rea=
lly matter at the end of the day.  The CEC has instructed us all along to s=
end labels to the customers, which we have.  We'll report the purchases (br=
own and green) as normal at the end of the year.=20

Let me know your input.

Heather

SH informed me that beyond 3/01 there was no volumes reported for Lost Arrow.  Therefore, no need to break out that volume.  

Mary - as a double check, please contact Deb Weakley 1-877-737-1272 at CSC  to verify that Lost Arrow was de-DASR'd.  DASR means Direct Access Service Request which is the terminology used when signing up a customer.  Obviously, the de-DASR would mean when we cut them from direct access service.  

Thank you.

Are you going to resubmit the report(s) with the correct July 2001
information?  The specific information that I am looking for is accurate
information for "Reportable Consumption" and "Total Consumption", both
in kWh's.

Thanks for your assistance.

Michael,

It looks like there may be some problem with the Fetzer Vineyards
Greenpower Consumption Report.  You may want to review the report and
determine what is wrong.  Reportable Consumption is 352,536 kWh's and
Total
Consumption is 4,407 kWh's.  Total Consumption should be more than
Reportable Consumption.

Also there is no consumption for the month of June 2001.

I can be reached at 713.853.3561.

I under calculated the MW capacity needed to meet the new renewable standard, and am reattaching the analysis.  The below table is the portion that was revised.  I used a 30% capacity factor since many of the new renewable resources coming on line are wind.  The MWs required could be inflated (i.e. cf of 50% v. 30%) in the out years if more biomass facilities are sited.

All -
Wanted to make you aware of a couple of bills before the CA legislature that would place a renewable purchase obligation on all retail sellers in California if enacted.  The attached document provides a comparative analysis of both bills (which are quite similar in language) and the resulting commercial implications.   One bill in particular has momentum in that is it attached to the SCE bailout.  Jeff Dasovich and Sue Mara have their finger on the "pulse" on the movement of these bills, so as far as status please contact them.

This is the classic Michael Porter Five Forces Article from 1979, still boilerplate strategy stuff at most business schools. I think it provides a useful framework as we analyze our market and develop our regional strategies.

***********************************************************************

ENVIRONMENTAL STRATEGY: NOT A TIME FOR SECOND-GUESSING

The events of September 11 are having a clear short-term impact on the pace of
environmental initiatives--at least in the United States. In the long run,
however, a shift toward greater recognition of the value of global
relationships has significant implications for the development of global
environmental strategies.

*  Environmental issues may be sidetracked but will not go into extended
hibernation.

*  The international response to terrorism will have some influence on the pace
of the Kyoto process.

*  Security concerns will continue to elevate the profile of renewable energy.

Mary, 

Jason Orta from the CEC called me to inform us that one of the generator numbers we had used was wrong. Sierra Pacific was listed as CEC 10016 and should actually have been 10036. I have made this correction in EPMI's CEC filing and resubmitted it. I have also made the correction on the "Proof of Purchase for Monthly Performance Reports" that you sent to me. I faxed the corrected version back to you at 713.646.2414. If you have any questions, let me know.

Regards,
Jesse

Hey folks,

In preparation for Monday's call, I've put together a set of job descriptions for the members of our group. I look forward to your input and feedback as we sort out our division of labor. October is going to be a month to remember. By the end of the month, we should have product offerings, new curves, a fundamentals site, and hopefully a few new transactions under our belt. Talk to you on Monday.

NEWS AND EVENTS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
EPA Buys 100 Percent Green Power in Cincinnati, Ohio

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
announced last week that it will buy electricity produced
entirely from renewable energy for three of its research
facilities in Cincinnati, Ohio. The EPA has committed to buy
more than 5 million kilowatt-hours per year of so-called
green power for the three facilities over the next three years.
Community Energy, Inc. will provide nearly 800,000 kilowatt-
hours of electricity each year from the Mill Run wind facility
now being built in Pennsylvania, and Commonwealth Edison
of Illinois will provide the remainder from its landfill gas
facilities. When the power purchase is underway in early
2002, EPA will be buying nine percent of its total electricity
use from renewable energy sources. See the press release
on the EPA home page at: <http://www.epa.gov/>.

The customers of Minnesota Power in northeastern
Minnesota and northwestern Wisconsin can now follow the
EPA's lead. Minnesota Power, a subsidiary of Allete, is now
offering wind power to its residential and small commercial
customers through a program called WindSense. The
company is selling the wind power at a premium cost of
$2.50 per 100 kilowatt-hours. See the Allete press release
at: <http://www.allete.com/placed/08-21-2001wind.html>.

Eleven leaders in the development of the U.S. green
power market received the first annual Green Power
Leadership Awards in late July. The awards were presented
to companies, universities, organizations and individuals
during the Sixth National Green Power Marketing Conference
in Portland, Oregon. See the list of awards on the conference
Web site on EREN at:
<http://www.eren.doe.gov/greenpower/conference/gpawards01.html>.


NREL Awards $40 Million for Thin-Film Solar Cells

DOE's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) announced last
week its award of $40 million to 19 universities and 14 companies
for the development of thin-film photovoltaic solar cells. Compared
to conventional crystalline-silicon solar cells, thin-film cells use
relatively little of the expensive semiconductor materials, so
they hold the potential to be produced at a low cost. See the
NREL press release at:
<http://www.nrel.gov/hot-stuff/press/3201_cheaper.html>.


Solar Carport Under Construction in Riverside, California

A new 113-kilowatt photovoltaic system is now under
construction in Riverside, California. Schott Applied Power
Corporation is building a solar carport for the city that will
generate power while providing shade for cars. See the
Schott Applied Power press release at:
<http://www.us.schott.com/apc/english/news/press.html?NID=23>.

A much larger solar power system may eventually be built in
Massachusetts. Spire Corporation is helping the City of
Brockton to assess the feasibility of building a solar power
facility on an abandoned industrial site. The proposed site
will cover 27 acres and generate 5 to 10 megawatts of power
-- enough to power 3,000 homes. See the Spire press
release at: <http://www.spirecorp.com/Spire/news/PV367.html>.

Old industrial sites, usually contaminated with hazardous
chemicals, are often referred to as brownfields. The
Brockton project is one example of the concept of using
solar energy to convert brownfields into what are being
called "brightfields." See the Brightfields Web site on EREN
at: <http://www.eren.doe.gov/brightfields/>.


Biodiesel Fuels Backup Power System at UC Riverside

Riverside, California, is also the location of a unique backup
power system using three 2-megawatt generators that are
powered entirely by biodiesel fuel. Southern States Power
Company, Inc. installed the system at the University of
California, Riverside and is supplying the biodiesel fuel. The
company also announced last month that the City of
Claremont, California, is using a 20 percent blend of its
biodiesel to fuel the city's sanitation vehicles. See the press
releases on the Southern States Power Web site at:
<http://www.sspowerco.com/press.html>.


FuelCell Energy Starts Up Fuel Cell/Microturbine System

FuelCell Energy, Inc. announced last week that it has started
operating one of its 250-kilowatt fuel cells in tandem with a
30-kilowatt microturbine from Capstone Turbine Corporation.
The microturbine is driven by hot exhaust gas from the fuel
cell -- usually the microturbines are driven by combustion of
natural gas. DOE is funding the test of the combined system.

FuelCell Energy also announced last week that it has
received a $1.25 million contract to install a 250-kilowatt fuel
cell power plant at the University of Connecticut. The
Connecticut Clean Energy Fund is funding the installation,
which will be completed in 2002.

See the August 14th and 16th press releases on the
FuelCell Energy Web site at:
<http://www.fuelcellenergy.com/site/investor/press/releases.html>.


Landfill Gas Powers 50 Microturbines in Los Angeles

The Los Angeles Department of Power and Water (LADWP)
announced last week the startup of a new facility that
produces 1.5 megawatts of electricity from landfill gas. The
facility uses methane emissions from the Lopez Canyon
Landfill to power 50 Capstone microturbines, generating
enough power for 1,500 homes. It adds to a six-megawatt
landfill gas power plant that was already operating at the
site. See the LADWP press release at:
<http://www.ladwp.com/whatnew/dwpnews/081601.htm>.


DOE Passes Energy-Efficient Light Project to Private Sector

A DOE program to encourage the encourage the production
and use of shorter, brighter, and more affordable compact
fluorescent lamps (CFLs) is now being turned over to the
private sector. DOE announced on Monday that the so-called
"sub-CFL" program, established by DOE's Pacific Northwest
National Laboratory, will now be handed off to the Northwest
Energy Efficiency Alliance, a nonprofit organization. CFLs
use about a quarter of the energy used by standard
incandescent bulbs, last up to 10 times longer, and
generate much less heat.

The program encouraged the development of 17 new CFLs
and is currently saving U.S. consumers more than $22 million
in electricity costs each year. See the DOE press release at:
<http://www.energy.gov/HQPress/releases01/augpr/pr01147.htm>.

The new Web site for the program, called BetterBulbsDirect.com,
features CFLs from two manufacturers. Online ordering is available
at discount prices, but the minimum order is 10 bulbs. See
the Web site at: <http://www.betterbulbsdirect.com/>.

Roadmaps to Energy Efficiency
<http://energyroadmaps.org/>

This site, sponsored by Global Green USA and Environment
Now, provides a step-by-step guide to retrofitting commercial
properties to improve energy efficiency and reduce operating
costs. The site features three approaches, called RoadMaps:
do it yourself, hire an energy consultant firm, or work with an
energy service company. Each RoadMap is presented as a
flowchart that outlines the specific steps of the process and
provides direct links to useful information and resources. The
site also includes case studies that demonstrate the benefits
that have been achieved in buildings throughout the country.

ENERGY FACTS AND TIPS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Income Up For Major Energy Companies in Second Quarter

The second quarter of 2001 yielded a surge in net income
for 26 major energy companies, according to a new report by
DOE's Energy Information Administration (EIA). Net income
for these companies increased by 10 percent compared to
the same time period in 2000. The largest increases occurred
in the petroleum industry, at 35 percent, and the natural gas
and power industries, at 30 percent. Domestic petroleum
companies saw a 38 percent increase in income. Domestic
petroleum refining and marketing experienced a 78 percent
increase in income. See the EIA report, "Financial News for
Major Energy Companies," at:
<http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/perfpro/news_m/index.html>.

If you're interested in petroleum company incomes, you may
also be interested in the EIA's list of world energy "areas to
watch," which includes oil-producing countries that are
experiencing political or economic troubles. The countries
encircle the globe, from Angola to the Caspian Sea, from
Indonesia to Venezuela. See the EIA's list at:
<http://www.eia.doe.gov/cabs/hot.html>.

This place looks like it has just the right combination of location (8,000 feet, 1 hour from DIA in Evergreen), practical meeting space, a restaurant nearby, and reasonably affordable. I suggest we go for it. The biggest question is the best time to go. Does that Nov 7-9 timetable work for everyone?

Elliot wants to have another conference call to discuss this weeks events. It seems that we've made some progress on several projects in the last few days. A suggestion was made that we schedule something around 1 PM pst tomorrow. That's 3pm on a Friday for you Houstonians?  Let me know if this doesn't work for anyone. Assuming there are no conflicts, I'll send a call-in number either this afternoon or early tomorrow.

The spreadsheet is attached.
 
*Will this spreadsheet meet our needs?

*What is the most efficient mechanism by which to update this information - i.e., will you update it directly, or coordinate with me?

Public Citizen will be doing "report cards" on competitive suppliers' mix.  This is similar to what the PACE scorecard is already doing.  If you have not seen the PACE scorecard, check it out: <http://www.powerscorecard.org/>
 
Also, I heard from Austin Energy that while their green pricing program is still small, they are having a 10-15% enrollment increase each month.

This looks promising. If the originator wants, he can patch one of us in to discuss the green power option with the client. BTW, do most people call you "Dick"?

Subject:	RE: Green power prices - Starbucks

Bill,

What I would propose that EESI pitch to Starbucks would be that EESI could provide "renewable attributes" sourced from wind generating facilities located in their own backyard, the Pacific Northwest.  EESI could offer 100% "renewable attributes" sourced from wind generating facilities located in the Pacific Northwest at a price of es at a price of approximately $9.00/MWh to $9.50/MWh.  In the event that Starbucks is willing to accept "renewable resources" sourced from wind generatiing facilities located in the State of Texas for some portion or all of its load the price could be as much as $1.00/MWh to $2.00/MWh lower than the approximate price indicated above.  

In lieu of the above suggested scenarios if EESI could determine Starbucks desired target for "renewable attributes" (price per MWh), EESI could offer pricing which takes into account some blend of wind generating facilities and biomass generating facities and/or some other generation sources which qualify as renewable. in order to meet Starbuck's target.

Let me know if you have any additional questions.

Regards,

Richard

Dick,

Unfortunately this is in the preliminary stages and I don't have a good handle on this deal yet (especially given q3 rush), but I know each store uses about 120,000 kWh per annum.  Based on some really rough calcs, I have these annual estimates by state.

We are looking at 3, 5 and 7 year deals.

 << OLE Object: Picture (Metafile) >> 

Of course, Origination would love to have green power for all the volumes, but that will depend on what the pricing turns out to be.

They also have a particular interest in green for TX.   Does Enron own any green power sources?

As we discussed before, the Starbucks deal is discussing some green power options with the client.

As I understand the deal currently has sites in the following regions:

TX
MA
IL
NY
NJ


Can you give me an indication of the pricing of green power in these regions.

Also, let me know if there are any other issues surrounding green power that would be important.

Thanks,

I just received a call from Richard Ring with new system power #'s on the MA label.  Sarah -- I think we've blown by your deadline to make changes, but attached is the most recent form.  We also tweaked the emissions graph to show the bar chart lines even with system power.

Jennifer -- I owe you a label for the mid-market physical product and will get that to you shortly.

Richard,

Attached is the Patagonia consumption data.  I have it sorted and totaled by From Date.  Because of the meter read dates it is difficult to get a clear cut consumption by month.  If you would like me to change the sub-totals, just let me know.

Mary

Yes, there is a provision for the creation of renewable energy credits, which can be traded.  I detailed that in the attachment.

Also, unless something's changed, the obligation would be tradeable.

All -
Wanted to make you aware of a couple of bills before the CA legislature that would place a renewable purchase obligation on all retail sellers in California if enacted.  The attached document provides a comparative analysis of both bills (which are quite similar in language) and the resulting commercial implications.   One bill in particular has momentum in that is it attached to the SCE bailout.  Jeff Dasovich and Sue Mara have their finger on the "pulse" on the movement of these bills, so as far as status please contact them.

Military Contractors' Stock Prices Soar

  With America hurtling toward its first war of the new century, the
promise of tens of billions of dollars in new military spending sent
defense stocks soaring Monday in the midst of one of Wall Street's
bigger free falls on record.

Kinko's wants their pricing refreshed for their Reliant and TXU sites only.
I need to know the fixed $MWh price if we assume a 50% renewable product in TXU

I am trying to fill out the attached template that Larry sent to me with my gen only price refreshed,

Hello Richard,

I have been trying to come up with the 312,658 number and am 
having difficulty.  Please e-mail me the missing numbers.  It 
would be a big help.  I would send you my spreadsheet, but it can 
get pretty confusing.  There are so many combinations.  Most of 
your numbers agree with the auditor's numbers.  However, there are 
a few that do not but are listed on the proof of purchase from 
EPMI.  Then some of those purchases don't seem to be reported on 
the MPR.  Another scenario is where I found numbers on the MPR 
that agree with the auditor but not you....then again, those could 
be the missing numbers.  Anyway, sorry this is taking so long.  
Once I get all the numbers from you, hopefully I can wrap this up.

I received the e-mail from Heather Raitt.  I briefly looked over 
it but haven't spent much time on it yet.

Thanks Richard.  And again, sorry for the delay.

Mary

p.s.  Please respond to this e-mail address.  I will be working 
from home the rest of the week.  Thanks.

Sarah,

As discussed, I've revised the Terms of Service summary to incorporate the new contract lengths offered and the disclosure label to reflect the emissions data provided by Barry Perlmutter of the MDTE.  Mr. Perlmutter confirmed, by trying to walk me through the ISO website (after first telling me that he was certain the data was on the website), that the data is, in fact, not available.  He wanted the label to have the emissions information available, however, and gave me the information over the phone.  I have transferred the data into the label.  Mr. Perlmutter promised that he would personally update the MDTE website with the emissions information soon (as well as the other missing information that I have been bugging him about for a few months).

Heather -- you may want to pass this information along to Richard Ring, if that's helpful:

             New Units      Regional Average
CO2      760                  780
NOX      0.1                   1.5
SO2       0.01                 3.9

The data is in pounds per MWh.

Let me know if you have any questions about the edits.

Sandy

Are you going to resubmit the report(s) with the correct July 2001
information?  The specific information that I am looking for is accurate
information for "Reportable Consumption" and "Total Consumption", both
in kWh's.

Thanks for your assistance.


Regards,
Richard

Richard,

Afer checking the last report was for two months June and July.  The
4,407
was not kWh but is Dollars instead.  Sorry for the confusion.

Michael,

It looks like there may be some problem with the Fetzer Vineyards
Greenpower Consumption Report.  You may want to review the report and
determine what is wrong.  Reportable Consumption is 352,536 kWh's and
Total
Consumption is 4,407 kWh's.  Total Consumption should be more than
Reportable Consumption.

Also there is no consumption for the month of June 2001.

I can be reached at 713.853.3561.

Regards,

Richard

Elliot wants to have another conference call to discuss this weeks events. It seems that we've made some progress on several projects in the last few days. A suggestion was made that we schedule something around 1 PM pst tomorrow. That's 3pm on a Friday for you Houstonians?  Let me know if this doesn't work for anyone. Assuming there are no conflicts, I'll send a call-in number either this afternoon or early tomorrow.

It's that time of year again - sending out 3rd quarter labels to California.  Richard & I were talking this morning and had several questions.

First - how do we reflect to our customers that used to receive BIZMIX (large commercials) in their projected labels that for the first month of the year (according to Diann Hudleston they were initially de-DASRed on Jan 31) they received the BIZMIX fuel mix and for the rest of the year the system mix?  Do we need to do a label showing a column for the Jan mix and a column for the rest of year mix with a footnote?  Additionally, has Peggy Mahoney's letter gone out yet?  I'd hate for a notation on a label to be the first thing a customer sees about this.  There is a bit of time, however, as these will go out in the October billing cycle (CSC has to have them 9/10).

Second - We returned our residential customers to the utilities the end of June.  Do we still need to send them a projected 2001 label in 3rd & 4th quarters since we did not provide their electricity during those periods?  I presume we will, however, have to send them a historical 2001 label next spring, since we did provide their electricity for at least first half of the year.

Thanks.

Heather

I suggest you get in on the evening of Wednesday, Nov. 7 and depart in the afternoon (probably 3pm or after) on Nov. 9.  
 
As for travel, I guess it depends on your budget and schedule - those flights with stops aren't necessarily very convenient.  You should call the Travel Agency in the Park, but my quick search on-line found that the only direct flights, on Continental, are running just over $1,000.  America West tickets with a stop in Phoenix are about $450.  I found a flight on Southwest departing from Hobby (via Phoenix) for $385 (see below).

Richard,

Attached is a rough draft of the Kinko's renewable energy provision.  Please give me a call after you have read it.  I need some help with the language, particulary in the definition of "Renewable Energy".  I want to understand the relationship between renewable energy and renewable energy credits and clarify it in the provision.

You had suggested that we commit to satisfying all of the renewable energy requirements through wind sources.  Is there any reason we need to commit to this in the contract?  I would rather be silient, so that we retain flexibility.

I am proposing that we not include any renewable energy language in the Master, but cover it all in the Transaction Agreement.  That will maximize our flexibility on any subsequent deals with Kinko's.

Paul

Otherwise, I will take a look at ME - Richard - I presume the cost again ca=
me from the same type of calculations that you threw together for Mass?  Sa=

ily for the Direct Mini) based upon your research that still apply to our c=

Heather --

Attached for your review are two new disclosure labels that we're working w=
ith Sarah Dietrich to prepare for the ME and NJ direct mini forms (same pro=
duct that we discussed several weeks ago for MA...direct marketing campaign=
 of fixed price, physical product).

The NJ label was adapted from Exhibit C of the NJBPU's posted Environmental=
 Standards http://www.bpu.state.nj.us/wwwroot/energy/envi.PDF using emissio=
ns and resource data from system power.  Please review and run it by your c=
ommercial team as well.

The ME label is adapted from the version you forwarded to me on Friday.  As=
 this is a fixed price product, similar changes were made to the language u=
nder "Generation Price" as were made in MA.  As this product does not have =
the excess and deficiency usage bands, EESI is not required to list languag=
e from the Maine Rules that explains price variability (as is the case in w=
ith the label you are currently using).  I've placed the product name in th=
e title of the label so that you will be able to differentiate it from the =
other product(s).  The only other changes I made were (i) removal of the tr=
iangles under "Air Emissions" that appear to be a carry-over from the MA la=
bel; the unit specific symbols are not required on the ME label; (ii) the f=
ootnote for "Power Sources" has been moved from the bottom of the page to d=
irectly under the power sources table; and (iii) removal of the bracket on =
the second page under "Power Sources".  Please review and let me know if yo=
u have any questions or comments about the changes I've made.  Also, please=
 confirm that the data reflected (for example, the 5.08 cents under avg pri=
ce per kWh) is current.

Thanks for your help.

	Aaron,

	Could you provide me with the monthly spend for both gas and
electric on this account.  I am assuming you have the gas spend.  We will
make a determination from there.  

	Dick ,

	I know you have been trying to reach me about the other renewable
opportunity we discussed a couple of weeks ago, however, I just don't have
the resources at this time to work that opportunity.  Please feel free to
work the opportunity with your contact in Portland.  I apologize for the
delayed response. 

	Aaron please get back to me with whatever information you may have

I'm not sure what needs to be done - Nicole says we're doing a physical product in CG&E.  I will forward her message to me to all of you.  Richard & Stacy - please work together to figure out what needs to be done, if anything to the fuel mix part.

Thanks.

Heather,

We are not delivering any power, other than Market Support Generation (MSG), which is provided by the First Energy utility companies.  It should either be the utilities that provide disclosure label information for our label we have to default to "Unknown Purchases" or whatever else is allowed/required by the Ohio PUC's.

We need to start sending our Ohio label with the contract to new Ohio customers (CG&E starting in Dec according to Nicole Schwartz).  I've had Sandy Cofer look over this one that was done by Allison way back when to see if it still meets requirements, and it does.  Can you confirm the fuel mixes, etc. for me?

Thanks.

Actually Thane you are hitting on exactly what I was referring too.  While this impacts the REC program, it's really a transmission issue.  Given our forward sale of RECs from the Pecos facility,  I want to make sure that we don't get hit w/ unexpected costs associated with transmission.   The Renewable Coalition is preparing for meeting with the Commissioners to propose solutions and try to mitigate any unforeseen fees associated with transmission (i.e. if lines are overloaded and trip/congestion etc.).  Depending upon how Doug and Mike determine this would affect us, I wanted to make sure we have a strategy/plan to respond if necessary.  Transmission is not my issue, but I'm certainly glad to facilitate us working through the renewable coalition to ensure our issues are being represented.  Thoughts?

I have not followed the REC program, but I have heard in the ERCOT CSC determination meeting that they (ERCOT) have concerns in west Texas due to the large amount of wind generation.  It is my understanding that last Friday a line tripped, due to the wind generation according to John Adams at ERCOT.
 
When you say keep an eye on transmission, what do you mean?

I'm hearing that ERCOT is backing off from ever invoking a fee for the REC program.   If you recall, ERCOT was going to take up this issue again at the end of year -- after initially suspending invoking any fees.  With the REC program up and going, ERCOT has determined that the fees to operate the program are not as high as initially projected.  We're hearing that in January they will likely permanently roll all the fees associated with running the REC program in with the overall market administration fees.   This is good news.
 
We need to keep a close eye on the transmission, though.  If there are transmission constraints and congestion getting the wind power from West Texas, this will likely bump up the cost.

Elliott this is a great initial product description. Can we expand this to include the blended  products (incorporating existing renewable resources and/or non-Green-e certified) and is it reasonable to begin to put notional pricing behind these products?

Please see below the press release regarding the adoption by the European Council of the renewables directive. Having already gone through the Commission and the Parliament the Directive has now been formally adopted and has legal force. The final text should become available very soon. The directive will be published in the Official Journal in the next couple of weeks.

Olivier Deleuze welcomes the adoption of the directive on renewable
sources of energy

The European Union Council adopted today the directive on the promotion of
renewable energy sources. For Olivier Deleuze, State Secretary responsible
for Energy and Sustainable Development, President of the Energy Council,
this final adoption gives the green light for the development of clean
energies in Europe while responding to the concerns of the citizens
regarding the safeguard of their environment.

The directive creates a framework for an increase of the production of
green electricity. It encourages the Member States to take the measures
needed to guarantee the development of renewable energies in line with the
national and Community objectives. It responses to the challenges
concerning the reduction of the EU 's energetic dependence, the
preservation of its capacity to choose its energy in the future while
limiting the greenhouse gas emissions and atmospheric pollutants dangerous
for the health.

"In Bonn, Europe has saved the Kyoto Protocol. Now, it has to give to
itself the means to achieve it", said Olivier Deleuze.

The directive defines two global objectives for 2010 :
1) the share of gross internal energy consumption at Community level will
have to reach 12%
2) 22.1% of the consumed electricity will have to be produced from
renewable energy sources
The Member States committed themselves to set national objectives for
domestic consumption of electricity produced from renewable sources of
energy (RSE). In Belgium, for example, the share of electricity produced
with those energy sources will have to reach 6% in 2010. The European
Commission will have to monitor the conformity of the actions taken at
national level. Four years after the implementation the directive, the
Commission will have the opportunity to propose a more harmonised system
of aid, on the basis of the experience of the Member States.

Other measures introduced by the directive are : the introduction of a
system of certification of green electricity, the creation of accompanying
measures designed to create suitable conditions for the introduction of
RSE on the domestic market while respecting rules of competition, to
ensure a certification within two years of entry into force of the
directive, to accelerate the authorisation procedure applicable to the
establishment of production centres for green electricity, to guarantee
that the calculation of connection costs for new producers are
non-discriminatory.

The main sources of renewable energy are : water power, solar energy, wind
power, biomass, biogas (for example from mud coming from waste treatment,
biological fuel).

Subject:	RE: Green power prices - Starbucks

Bill,

What I would propose that EESI pitch to Starbucks would be that EESI could provide "renewable attributes" sourced from wind generating facilities located in their own backyard, the Pacific Northwest.  EESI could offer 100% "renewable attributes" sourced from wind generating facilities located in the Pacific Northwest at a price of es at a price of approximately $9.00/MWh to $9.50/MWh.  In the event that Starbucks is willing to accept "renewable resources" sourced from wind generatiing facilities located in the State of Texas for some portion or all of its load the price could be as much as $1.00/MWh to $2.00/MWh lower than the approximate price indicated above.  

In lieu of the above suggested scenarios if EESI could determine Starbucks desired target for "renewable attributes" (price per MWh), EESI could offer pricing which takes into account some blend of wind generating facilities and biomass generating facities and/or some other generation sources which qualify as renewable. in order to meet Starbuck's target.

Let me know if you have any additional questions.

Regards,

Richard

Dick,

Unfortunately this is in the preliminary stages and I don't have a good handle on this deal yet (especially given q3 rush), but I know each store uses about 120,000 kWh per annum.  Based on some really rough calcs, I have these annual estimates by state.

We are looking at 3, 5 and 7 year deals.

 

Of course, Origination would love to have green power for all the volumes, but that will depend on what the pricing turns out to be.

They also have a particular interest in green for TX.   Does Enron own any green power sources?

As we discussed before, the Starbucks deal is discussing some green power options with the client.

As I understand the deal currently has sites in the following regions:

TX
MA
IL
NY
NJ


Can you give me an indication of the pricing of green power in these regions.

Also, let me know if there are any other issues surrounding green power that would be important.

Yikes....hope you are surviving!  You'll need coffee after this product lau=
nch.  Here's the lowdown w/ labels in TX.  Your 1st label will be a project=

s will only be purchasing system mix.  You might already have done so.  On =
the fuel mix label (do you have a copy?....I'm attaching if you do not), re=
place the heading "Sources of power generation" with "Projected sources of =
power generation".  Same w/ emissions....replace "emissions and waste per k=
Wh generated" with "projected emissions and waste per kWh generated".  EES =
must then practice "due diligence" in its acquisition of power to ensure yo=
ur projection is as close as possible to your actual.  You will change to h=
istorical data on the label after one year (12/31/02).  You have some leewa=
y during the pilot as the final label calculation rule has not been adopted=
 yet -- though it is unlikely that these requirements will change.

I must get in one other plug.  You might seriously want to consider a green=
 product option.  In Texas, we have a system by which it is more cost-effec=
tive to purchase renewable power.  That is how entities such as Green Mount=
ain (label attached below) have been able to launch a 100% wind product.  R=
eliant (label attached below) is offering a 100% green product in TXU's ter=
ritory for only 1 cent more per kWH.  Reliant's offering is for residential=
 only.  EPMI and Enron Wind have 135 MW wind facility and you might want to=
 price a premium option for the smaller commodity customers from this facil=
ity or from the market in general. I am GLAD to hook you up with the intern=

 a meeting on Thursday from 12-3 to discuss renewable origination and tradi=

Mike,

The agreement covers multiple projects; to date there is only one project that has come on line.  For the one project that has come on line during the non-performance penalty could be in the range of $150,000 to $640,000, depending on the resoultion of the "effective online date" for said project.  The non-performance penalty was our strongest negotiating point in the ongoing effort to restructure the agreement as there is a potential for penalties for each project for each year of the contract.  The agreement contained some fundamenal flaws in order to be able to book the mark-to-market for the agreement.  

I do not have a good handle of the "early termination payment" except to say that there are approxmiately 390,500 MWh's.  The average contract "fixed price" is $33.10 MWh.  I would need to find out what the nine year fixed price from the power curves is to estimate but my best stab would be to estimate the nine year fixed price to be $25.00 MWh which would result in "early termination payment" of approximately $3,200,000 ((390,500*33.10) - (390,500*25.00)).

Mike,

The "deal" is between EESI and Riverside County Waste Management Department (RCWMC) is dated April 17, 2000 and the term commenced on Sepetmber 1, 2000 and ending on September 1, 2010.  Based on our bankruptcy filing RCWMD stopped delivery of power on December 6, 2001; RCWMD invoiced EESI for power production for September 2001, 0ctober 2001 and November 2001.  I do not know if they were ever paid by EESI.  I do not know of any invoice for the first six days of December 2001.

EESI (myself) and EPMI (Chris Foster) were in the process of renegotiating the above referenced agreement with the plan for EPMI to take over the purchase of power and scheduling services with EESI being the purchaser of the "green tickets"  from EPMI associated with the power production.  There were some major issues to overcome in the renegotiation regarding the "fixed price", "volume committments" and "penalties".  I do not know who, if anyone, is currently looking at this agreement to make any kind of determination EESI's and/or EPMI's desires for the future of this agreement.  

RCWMD sent various letters dated December 10, 2001, December 13, 2001, and January 8, 2002 requesting response from EESI.  The December 10, 2001 letter indicates that RCWMD considers the agreement terminated effective December 2, 2001.  I had previously spoke to you about this agreement in December 2001.  

It is my opinion that we should not continue this agreement and we should consider RCWMD's offer to terminate the agreement with the exchange of the non-performance panalties for the termination payment.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Regards,

Richard

Richard--what do you know about this deal?  Do you have paper on it?  Is this a purchase deal that we want?  Are we buying under it now?

The customer is pushing me to give them some answers.  Thanks.  MDS

Congress defies Bush on arsenic, global warming

A remarkable feature of the 107th Congress so far is that on some key environmental issues, President Bush is losing support within his own party. 
In the past, when approving funding for environmental programs, Republicans often attached provocative riders designed to weaken environmental enforcement. It now seems as though Congress is "greener" than the new president. 
The GOP-controlled House approved July 27 an amendment that EPA must immediately adopt a standard to reduce arsenic in drinking water that is no weaker than the one finalized at the end of the Clinton administration and suspended by Bush. 
EPA Administrator Christie Whitman wanted to review the Clinton rule, arguing that it was hastily crafted and lacked an adequate scientific basis. Whitman said she was disappointed the House "decided to prejudge the outcome of this issue," noting that the House amendment "would not put a standard in place any sooner than planned under EPA's science-based approach." 
Evidently, few members of Congress relish the prospect of defending to voters higher levels of arsenic in drinking water. A few days later, the Senate joined the House in calling for a tougher standard by a whopping 97-1 margin. A stronger standard seems all but certain, but just how strong remains in doubt. 
Counting earlier votes to block oil and gas drilling, the arsenic vote marked the third time in a month the House rejected Bush administration environmental policies. There are also signs the Senate is growing restive over the administration's handling of global warming. 
Just before Congress' August recess, Sens. Joseph Lieberman, DConn., and John McCain, R-Ariz., called for development of a cap-and-trade system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The senators plan to introduce legislation that would cap greenhouse gases and create a market through which companies would be rewarded for innovative solutions to the problem. 
The announcement from two of the Senate's leading figures came shortly after a unanimous vote in the Foreign Relations Committee urged Bush to return to the bargaining table later this year with specific proposals for a new global warming treaty. 
The United States did not join 178 other countries July 23 in adopting rules for implementing the Kyoto climate change treaty, which sets binding targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The administration, along with most members of Congress, opposes the Kyoto treaty because of the belief that it would harm the U.S. economy while exempting developing nations from mandatory emissions targets. 
The growing congressional pressure to do something about global warming may be having an effect. White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card Jr. said Aug. 5 the administration is likely to present new proposals for a global warming treaty when the United States meets with other nations this fall in Morocco. The administration is preparing a plan that calls on power plants to limit greenhouse gas emissions other than carbon dioxide.

All -
Wanted to make you aware of a couple of bills before the CA legislature that would place a renewable purchase obligation on all retail sellers in California if enacted.  The attached document provides a comparative analysis of both bills (which are quite similar in language) and the resulting commercial implications.   One bill in particular has momentum in that is it attached to the SCE bailout.  Jeff Dasovich and Sue Mara have their finger on the "pulse" on the movement of these bills, so as far as status please contact them.

Richard:

To recap our conversation today, those customers that are switching from financial to physical are already on contract and their existing contract allows such a transaction to take place at our discretion.  However, these customers would not have been receiving a label in the past.  Can you please send, via e-mail a list of LDCs that this action is taking place under, and please indicate whether we have had physical customers in this LDC in the past.  Additionally, is someone keeping track of these customers so that when it comes time to send labels we have a list to send to CSC?  Thanks.

Heather

Richard and I spoke with Bob Hansen yesterday to get status on the presentation pitch to you.  Bob said that he still needs to coordinate w/ Mary Jo on the accounting issue, but will have a presentation for you to look at by next Friday -- with price quotes scenarios depending on length of commodity deal and whether or not you participate in the pilot.  In addition, I've coordinated with Elliot Mainzer, Mike Curry and Michael Payne who will get you a quote for a 5 year REC term by week's end.
 
We should then set up a meeting to discuss the week of the 6th as a prelude to firming up the details and showing it to your boss.

Hello all!

I met with Diann Huddleson today and she clarified some issues for me regar=
ding the DASRing of customers in California.  Unfortunately it wasn't what =
we wanted to hear.

On the easy side of things, all residential customers (PGE, SCE, SDG&E) wer=
e turned back to the utilities starting May 30th (DASRs were submitted and =
they are cycling off now depending upon meter reading cycles, etc.)  These =
customers received a letter letting them know about it.

On the commercial side of things (Diann had no distinctions between small c=
ommercial & large commercial & industrial customers), SDG&E customers have =
been ours all along and have never been DASRed and reDASRed.  In PGE & SCE,=
 IBM behind PGE was also never put through the DASR process and has continu=
ously received our product.  All other PGE & SCE customers were originally =
submitted for DASRing back to the utilities on - January 31!!!!!  That prov=
ides enough issues of its own, but I'll get to that.  PGE did a virtual swi=
tch so as of Jan 31 all these customers became PGE's again, but with SCE, w=
hen a customer was switched depending upon meter reading cycles, etc.  All =
de-DASRed customers were then re-DASRed back to us starting June 21, and Di=
ann indicated that not only all of our old customers were re-DASRed, but ne=
w contracts were being executed and these new customers were also being DAS=
Red to us.  No communication about all of this has been sent to the custome=
rs, but as we discussed, some personal basis notice may have been given to =
our larger customers through the reps.

So - I'm not worried about the residential side - we'll have to send them a=
n annual historical label next April (with perhaps a letter explaining why =
they're still receiving info from us).  As far as the commercial/industrial=
 .......

1.  No notice was provided to probably the majority of the customers. [Bolt=
on, Stacey]  We (or PR) should prepare a customer letter as discussed with =
Peggy, notifying them that they are no longer receiving Bizmix ASAP.
2.  They've been receiving system mix since Feb 1 and we've been proceeding=
 as if it were actually BIZMIX - i.e. the 2nd quarter labels they just rece=
ived indicated BIZMIX, as appropriate to the customer. [Bolton, Stacey]   W=
e should look into purchasing green tags to make these customers whole if w=
e will be more than 5% off of our projection v. what we actually delivered.=
  The regs allow for discrepancies between projections and actual, and you =
don't have to show an extra column w/ the difference if you are w/in 5% del=
ta band between projection and actual..  We can change the projection for t=
hird quarter and include this information in the customer letter.=20
3.  What are the new customers (those as being DASRed to us the first time =
as of June 21) being told they are receiving?  Are they being marketed BIZM=
IX? [Bolton, Stacey]   We should ensure this is not the case with originati=
on.  Someone in Jeremy B.'s shop will most likely know.=20
4.  As far as dates are concerned for reporting purposes, will we just use =
those given as the date of submission (i.e. Jan 31, May 30, June 21) as it =
is impossible to pinpoint when each individual customer transferred? [Bolto=
n, Stacey]   We should discuss this a bit.  I'm not sure that this will rea=
lly matter at the end of the day.  The CEC has instructed us all along to s=
end labels to the customers, which we have.  We'll report the purchases (br=
own and green) as normal at the end of the year.=20

Let me know your input.

Yikes....hope you are surviving!  You'll need coffee after this product lau=
nch.  Here's the lowdown w/ labels in TX.  Your 1st label will be a project=
ion or guestimation of what you anticipate delivering to customers.  I'd ge=
t w/ Richard Ring on the desk (under Rogers Herndon) to verify that you guy=
s will only be purchasing system mix.  You might already have done so.  On =
the fuel mix label (do you have a copy?....I'm attaching if you do not), re=
place the heading "Sources of power generation" with "Projected sources of =
power generation".  Same w/ emissions....replace "emissions and waste per k=
Wh generated" with "projected emissions and waste per kWh generated".  EES =
must then practice "due diligence" in its acquisition of power to ensure yo=
ur projection is as close as possible to your actual.  You will change to h=
istorical data on the label after one year (12/31/02).  You have some leewa=
y during the pilot as the final label calculation rule has not been adopted=
 yet -- though it is unlikely that these requirements will change.
=20
I must get in one other plug.  You might seriously want to consider a green=
 product option.  In Texas, we have a system by which it is more cost-effec=
tive to purchase renewable power.  That is how entities such as Green Mount=
ain (label attached below) have been able to launch a 100% wind product.  R=
eliant (label attached below) is offering a 100% green product in TXU's ter=
ritory for only 1 cent more per kWH.  Reliant's offering is for residential=
 only.  EPMI and Enron Wind have 135 MW wind facility and you might want to=
 price a premium option for the smaller commodity customers from this facil=
ity or from the market in general. I am GLAD to hook you up with the intern=
al folks that can help you w/ purchases for renewable energy.  We're having=
 a meeting on Thursday from 12-3 to discuss renewable origination and tradi=

All - I heard that National Grid is actively lobbying the Governor against =
signing the implementation of the RPS, (based on the universal applicabilit=
y to utilities) scheduled to begin in '03.  The legislature passed the RPS =
as part of the restructuring package, and it went to the Division of Energy=
 Resources for implementation.  Many of you recall that we served on the ad=
visory committee to the DOER and were actively involved with the draft reg =
to ensure fair implementation.  The RPS regs as they were drafted by the ad=
visory committee are currently before the Governor Swift's staff for evalua=
tion.  The RPS requirement as defined in statute is placed on all retail se=
llers according to the following percentages of sales: 1% by 12/31/03; an a=
dditional .5% of sales each year thereafter until 12/31/09; and an add'l .5=
% of sales for every year thereafter until a date TBD by the Division of En=
ergy Resources from new renewable resources.  Unless there is legislation t=
o overturn the statute, the RPS will go forward.  However, the implementati=
on regs might be delayed.

I'll keep you posted as to the outcome.

Elliot:
 
Below is the general description that I use.  
 
Power has two components: the electrons and the attributes associated with generating these electrons (e.g.  fuel type and emissions).  A REC represents all of the attributes associated with generating renewable power.  RECs can either be bundled with the actual electrons or sold separately.

After speaking with Chris Boster, it was noted that we can not pass the imbalance charges back to riverside.  

I will be working with Jim Reyes to find out what charges/revenue EPMI is invoicing EES.  Richard, I will let  you know as soon as I find out the details on the amount of time it's going to take to pull those numbers out  of our total ancillary services invoice.

Attached is a MA disclosure label tailored for the mid-market physical product with price variability (excess and deficiency usage bands).  The only difference between this label and the label distributed for the direct mini product is language in the "Generation Price" section.   If average prices vary by volume of sales (as I understand the mid-market product does), the MA rules require a verbatim statement on the label as follows:

"Your average generation charge is based on the terms of the Agreement.  As the Rules require, the information provided above is the average price per kWh for EESI customers for the last month of the prior quarter."

The direct mini form, in contrast, did not require this language as it was a fixed price product with no price variability.  The attached incorporates the updates to system resource mix that I just received from Richard Ring this morning and the updated emissions chart (formatting only).

Let me know if you have any questions.

Attached are revised drafts of (i) the Kinko's Electric Master, and (ii) the Transaction Agreement for the applicable Texas facilities.  Each of the attached documents has been "red-lined" against the current version of the original base form from which it was derived.

The following are the most significant revisions which have been made to the August 21 drafts:

1.	Any Utility Invoice Credits from "green" power will accrue to the benefit of EESI, rather than Kinko's.  Section 2.8 of the Master has been restored to the original "form" version to reflect this.

2.	Cross-default language with respect to Kinko's and its subsidiaries has been added to Section 3.1 of the Master. 

3.	The "deemed insecurity" provision has been deleted from Section 3.6 of the Master.

4.	The right to terminate because of a change in law has been made unilateral in favor of EESI, rather than reciprocal.  Section 3.8 of the Master has been restored to the original "form" version to reflect this.

We are hoping to send the drafts out to Kinko's this afternoon.  Please let me know if you have any questions or comments with respect to the attached documents.

Paul

Subject:	Report on today's ERCOT Wind Meeting


Coalition Members & Turbine Manufacturers:


ERCOT is spearheading an effort to develop a Wind Generation Model to
be used in the PTI transmission software package that is used in many
parts of the world.

ERCOT wants all wind turbine manufacturers & wind developers to get
very involved in this effort.


Wind Pays for Model Development
********************************

ERCOT's willingness to pay the $200,000 software development cost is
scant.... this burden is going to be imposed upon the wind companies.
ERCOT might be willing to serve as a banker to spread charges among
the wind people.

If we delay doing this, there's a possibility that NERC could fine
ERCOT who would in turn pass fines on to Wind Companies.  More
importantly though, without the model, there will be more wind
curtailments in Texas than otherwise necessary.

It will probably take at least a year from now before this model is
available for use.

The need for a good wind turbine generator model is a
National/International issue.  As such, perhaps DOE/NREL will help
pay.

This issue will start cropping up everywhere... ERCOT wants to be a
technical leader and just get it done now.


Wind Turbine Manufacturers
***************************

Hello Vestas, Bonus, Micon, Enron, etc.... ERCOT expects your active
involvement in this Wind Generation Model development effort.

They have a big hammer to use, too.... if your category of wind
machine is not "model-able" in the PTI package, it's possible your
turbines will not be allowed to interconnect in Texas.

What ERCOT wants is:

	(1) control block diagram modeling your machines

	(2)  possibility of adapting your existing models (if you
have one) for use in the PTI package

	(3) possibly $$$ contribution for model development

Please make an effort to participate in next Tuesday's Coalition
Meeting (9/25) from 3:00 - 5:00 pm CST.  Call in # is  916-442-0272.


Sneak-Peak on Transmission Plans
*********************************

ERCOT's annnual transmission report will be filed w/ PUC by Oct.1.
Ken Donohoo will distribute extracts to us via email over the next
week or 2 that are expected to contain the following:

	updated AEP plan

	TXU plan

	New Line recommendation from San Angelo to Rio Pecos

Expect TXU's schedule to also be slower than we originally expected.

Beth inquired about how TSP plans become public & Ken reported that
those standards are still being worked out.

Richard,

I spoke to Dave Gunther earlier today regarding the EES and Green Power agreements.  He directed me to you.  Can you tell us if EES has terminated the agreements with Green Power?  If so, I would like to get confirmation of the termination in writing.  

Thank you for your assistance.

Kathleen,

Here is the meter.  It stops at 12/11.  I am wondering if Enron no longer serves as a Scheduling Coordinator for any generation.  And therefore, we no longer receive any meter data for the wind units.  That doesn't mean that they didn't produce energy.  We may simply not be capturing it after 12/11.  Let me know what you find out.  I am going to ask around here too.

Jim,

I confirmed with our Regional Manager, John Nemila, in Palm Springs that the Green Power project generated production for the entire month of December.  Unfortunately, the reports that I get (like the ones I sent you) are by turbine number and only give a month-to-date total.  John Nemila did not have any reports of metering problems.   If you could try to download the data again we would greatly appreciate it!  Otherwise, we will have to estimate production.

Thanks,
Kathleen

Kathleen,

I appreciate the file you sent me, but I don't see any meter after the 11th or 12th.  I'm not sure how your file compares to the meter in system.  Perhaps you could help me understand how your meter would correlate to meter in the generation report.

The other point is that we stopped generating early in the month with other generators.  I assumed that the wind were no exception.

Thanks for the data. I compared your data for meters 1 and 2 and the production that I show looks like an entire months production.  Could you try to download data for the 12th to the 31st?  Here are copies of the data for meters 1 and 2:

To answer your question, I am not the person who can :"Specifically, I need the contact information for the EES utility liaison or 
the person at the utility who is responsible for verifying metering accuracy at this site."

The meter from the Wind units is sent to the ISO.  I don't know how it is sent in, but the ISO in turn sends the meter to our meter group in Houston.

I have no idea who "physically" manages this transaction.

Asset Management is in the process of updating site information and seeking documentation of  revenue meter testing at Green Power.  Marion did not know who I should request this information from and suggested that I start with EES.  

All the other projects have a stipulation in their agreements requiring utilities to undertake testing of their metering equipment to verify the accuracy of such equipment.  If testing reveals that the equipment is outside of a specified range, then the utility will calibrate the meter.  

I am looking to send a request for evidence or certification of such testing at Green Power.  Specifically, I need the contact information for the EES utility liaison or 
the person at the utility who is responsible for verifying metering accuracy at this site.

If you know of anyone who can assist with this matter, please forward their contact information to me.

Thanks

Let me know your thoughts/additions and changes?
 
 

Jerry:  

It was a pleasure to meet you in Portland.  Per our discussion at lunch, I've talked with Elliot Mainzer of our renewable power desk as well as Richard Ring who manages the supply for the GSA Region 1 Electric Generation Contract regarding the potential aggregation of RECs to DOE's and NREL's facilities/labs across the US.   We are glad to work with you and are glad to get you preliminary pricing information on the sourcing of RECS, however, we first need to get a little more information from you expressed in question format below.  

1. How long are you seeking for the length of the contract (5 -20 years)?  The GSA Region 1 Electric Generation Contract runs through October 2003; the GSA Region 1 Electric Generation Contract also covers Value Added Services, which includes byt is not limited to preliminary audits, comprehensive audits, feasibility studies, design reviews, engineering and design,  construction and installation, operation, maintenance, training and emergency response for Value Added Services .  Therefore, any of the facilities located in Region 1 could be directly negotiated and contracted through the GSA Region 1 Contract.  Agencies covered under the GSA Region 1 Contract include:  Veterans Administration, Coast Guard, National Parks Service, Internal Revenue Service, Department of Agriculture, National Archives & Records Administration, Hanscom Air Force Base & Department of Labor.

2. Approximate demand (MWh) for facilities and labs across the US?

3. What percentage of your demand do you ideally want to come from renewable energy (sourced by tags)?  Do you intend to ramp up over a number of years, or want to initially hit a certain percentage target that remains constant over the life of the contract?

4. Would you consider purchasing tags from recently announced projects with additional increments coming from unannounced new  renewable energy project(s).  If not, what percentage is required or desired?

5. What percentage of the tags need to come from new wind?  

6.  Is it your intention to source all of the certificates from the new wind facilities located on Native American Reservations in ND or SD?  If not, what would be the percentage you are seeking?

7. What is the timeframe in which you are looking to make your purchase decision?

8. Do you want the product to be Green-e certified?

9. Are you interested in coupling energy efficiency tags with renewable energy tags?

10.Would you need to put together an RFP?  If so, would you need one national RFP or many localized RFP's?

Greetings all --
Given my rather other-world state on yesterday's conference call, I wanted =
to fire off an e-mail to you to summarize current commercial activities on =
the Renewable Power Desk. I appreciate all the work you guys are doing and =
feel as though we're really gaining some traction.

Green Power Market Development Group -- We will be submitting a proposal to=
 the Wind Energy Working Group of the Green Power Market Development Group =
(headed by Mark Crowdis of Think Energy) on Tuesday with a variety of prici=
ng proposals for products ranging from physical commodity with green tags t=
o green tags with embedded call options. Richard and I are working together=
 to develop pricing for tags in the Pac Northwest, California, Texas and th=
e East. I feel good about our chances of getting something done with these =
guys as they are feeling the heat to do something concrete after making so =
many public declarations of intent. As we move forward, I think we should a=
ll do a lot of thinking about other companies we should approach for this t=
ype of product. Once the Enron Building is juiced with wind power, we will =
be able to approach other fortune 500 companies with a straight face and en=
courage them to become Green Power Alliance Customers. During the week of S=
eptember 11, I plan to be in Houston to work extensively on drawing up the =
guidelines for the Alliance Program and working more closely with Richard a=
nd Stacey and their EES contacts to develop green power products for up-str=
eam marketing and new origination efforts.

Los Angeles Department of Water and Power -- LADWP is the largest green pow=
er buyer among public power agencies in California. Their green power buyer=
 is heavily understaffed (and somewhat outgunned in terms of industry knowl=
edge). He has hired us to help him bring his contract negotiations to fruit=
ion, manage logistics for new projects and essentially sleeve new renewable=
 power products through Enron's existing Master Services Agreement with LAD=
WP. This is an exciting (although not very profitable at this point) opport=
unity to establish the nodes of the California Renewable Power Pool and we =
see this as a way to bring our Services Desk functions to bear on the renew=
able sector in California. I am meeting with FPL Energy next week to discus=
s becoming the logistics coordinator for their new wind projects in Califor=
nia.

Wind Development -- As you may know, I purchased an option on a large parce=
l of windy land in Central Washington with enXco, a wind development concer=
n. We are marketing the project to two of the munis in the Pacific Northwes=
t (Seattle City Light and Eugene Water and Electric Board). Both have expre=
ssed interest. This morning I am meeting with the City of Portland to try t=
o convince Portland to follow Seattle's lead as a zero-carbon growth city a=
nd signatory to the type of Kyotoesque committments recently announced by N=
ew England legislators.

Renewable Portfolio Standard -- The proposed CA RPS has major implications =
for our business, from both a risk management and commercial opportunity pe=
rspective. We need to really drill down on this today and get as much insig=
ht as to the political climate as possible. Having witnessed the first meet=
ing of the California Power Authority last Friday in Sacramento, I am perso=
nally convinced that the RPS will definitely be passed in some shape or for=
m. If they pass a 1% requirement for new renewables next year, this transla=
tes into 430MWm off a 43,000MW peak load in CA. We have very good working r=
elationships with several of the biomass generators in California, includin=
g generators with new resources, and we are actively negotiating a marketin=
g agreement with one of them and considering taking a long position for the=
 next couple of years. The critical question, of course, is who will actual=
ly have the short position in California? If it is just the DWR, then they =
will probably satisfy their requirement with their new renewables purchases=
. If the utilities end up serving load, they will be in the market looking =
for the least-cost resources, and new biomass will clearly be a part of the=
 mix.

Pac Northwest RFPs -- Both PacifiCorp and Portland General Electric have RF=
Ps out right now for green tags and retail marketing services. I am staying=
 in touch with Bonneville Environmental Foundation, Green Mountain Energy a=
nd Community Energy to act as a wholesaler for their tag submissions. I wan=
t to get master services contracts in place with each of these entities to =
make it really easy for them to transact with us. We can use our market leg=
s to get well-priced tags and then sell to them as they shoot for RFP succe=
sses. Bonneville Environmental, at a minimum, will need new biomass to blen=
d in with their expensive wind energy tags.

Chicago -- Most of you probably met Mike Lindert at our Houston Renewables =
meeting earlier this month. He was the EES originator for the ComEd deal, a=
nd as you know, there is a significant renewable committment in Chicago. We=
 need to get in front of the City of Chicago as soon as possible to talk ab=
out their next generation of renewable purchases. Stacey, I belive you have=
 info on this.

Sustainable Products Training -- The Renewable Power Desk has donated RECs =
and CO2 offsets for the Sustainable Products Training in Austin, September =
10 - 11. They are giving us lots of press and would like one or two of us t=
o attend. If you are interested in heading up there for a day with me, plea=
se let me know. There should be a pretty good turnout among potential comme=
rcial and industrial customers.

Kinkos -- All indications are that our negotiations with Kinko's are going =
very well. The hope is to sell them a three-year fixed-price retail product=
 and 100% wind tags. Richard and I are woking to source the tags. Success w=
ill be huge, as Kinkos is part of the Green Power Market Development Group.

I know that Richard and Stacey have other deals on the table, and Jesse has=
 been busy working on finalizing our services deal with Edwards Air Force B=
ase. I look forward to seeing you guys in Houston the week of September 11 =
and taking the next steps in formalizing our green product offerings.

Talk to you soon,

EM

Richard, I spoke with Chris Boster(EPMI) and Jim Reyes, they agreed that  we are schedulling the Riverside Generation.  However, we are not passing the charges back to them for not meeting their obligation.  If you would please give me a call so that I may further discuss this matter with you.

Thanks,

Pam

J.J.:  

As we discussed this morning, I'm concern about the potential negative connotations of the first sentence.  I think this Q&A provides us with an opportunity to highlight how EES is and can make this clean form of energy available to those customers who want renewable energy. Below are my suggestions:

EES makes renewable energy options available to customers, and offered several certified products when the California was open called "Enron Earth Smart". Given the economies of scale, renewable energy generally sells at a premium.  EES has the ability to offer renewable energy in a competitive manner through our vast experience of risk management and hedging to those customers seeking to purchase environmentally friendly products.  Further, EES has been able to offer some customers renewable energy at no additional cost by supplementing the premium with government provided incentive monies.  Finally EES has historically offered energy efficiency options to customers to reduce demand.  Coupled together, energy efficiency and renewable energy make a powerful environmental footprint, and EES is primely situated to tailor competitively priced product offerings to customers seeking these product options.

Hope this is helpful, and you are able to polish it.  Please call with any questions.  I'm on my cell today 713-303-2632.

 Regards,

Stacey

Does EES offer renewable energy as a fuel choice?

Yes, EES makes renewable energy available as a fuel choice but what we have found is that people are not willing to pay more for this fuel type. In some instances we have partnered with the government and supplemented the additional expense so that a certain percentage of the fuel mix is renewable energy at no expense to the consumer.

It's that time again.  I believe Mass is probably tweaked plenty by now, with the exception of the pricing.  Can you help me update CA?  I need both of these by Sept 10.
