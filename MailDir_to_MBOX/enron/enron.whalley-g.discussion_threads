Mark/Greg, 

Please confirm your interest and availability to set aside 30 minutes, or so 
Dec 6, 7 or 8, for me in Houston this week.

I am in a final phase of an expat re-assignment or relocation and would like 
to discuss with you:

Enron's pricing, structuring and position-taking capability for South America 
etc.,.. expected to be in place from the year 2000, at least in power in 
Brazil.

Failure/Successes and immediate opportunities in the Enron Brazil and South 
America core (gas, power) and multiple commodity commercial effort(s), 
including e-business/Networks issues.

Finance expertise  - the critical role that functional groups like Enron 
Metals' (Trade and Structure Finance Group) and the Global Markets 
Insurance/Global Risk groups will (need to) play in helping develop critical, 
internal Enron finance, risk assessment and mitigation expertise to support 
the competitiveness and viability of closing commercial transactions in South 
America and elsewhere

My priority to help form and be re-assigned to a "Bundle Products" 
Origination business unit  designed to initiate transactions which 
specifically and formally leverage synergies across Enron Business Units - to 
potentially include in Brazil, at least, power, pulp & paper, steel networks, 
crude and products, and insurance/global risk. 

Please find attatched files which detail some of my ideas for developing the 
core gas and power trading and origination efforts and including the Bundled 
Product unit.   The files were appropriately forwarded to Dave/John. 




I have also attatched my CV should you be interested to review my background 
and experience and  mention, as a reminder, that a meeting is critical in 
potentially determining the outcome of my expat re-assignment or re-location 
process,  needed to be concluded this month, Dec 2000.  

Thank you for any efforts extended in my behalf.

As you may have heard, President Bush signed the Economic Growth and Tax 
Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 into law (the "Law") this morning.  The Law 
reduces personal income tax rates, modifies the AMT and Estate Tax and makes 
several changes to retirement and education savings incentives.  Further, due 
to the reduction in the personal income tax rates (through the creation of a 
new 10 percent tax bracket carved out from the previous 15 percent bracket) 
without a reduction to the amount currently withheld under the Federal 
withholding tax regime, all taxpayers are slated to receive a rebate of taxes 
that otherwise would have been paid this year - this is the $300, 500 or 600 
"tax refund" that you may have heard of in connection with the Law.  The 
attached documents describe in greater detail the changes I have just 
described.  As always, I can be reached at x30938 should you have any 
questions.  Best regards.  SHD.

Greg -- 

Thanks again for really lighting them up last night.  Being the best guy in 
11 years ain't bad.  It was fun for me to get to know you and look forward to 
working together.

Vance

p.s.  Your restaurant list has my wife looking to expedite the finding of a

Gentlemen -

A few updates:

The second Bombay High Court hearing was held today.  The court asked DPC to 
go away for a week and try to continue discussions with MSEB.  The parties 
are to return to the court in a week for another hearing.  We are not 
entirely sure why the court made this request -- it has nothing to do with 
the MERC jurisdiction issue before the court.  One possible positive 
interpretation:  The court feels the need to generate some positive publicity 
("I tried to encourage a positive outcome") before ruling in our favor on the 
jurisdiction issue.  But, again, the court's motives are not clear.

We still don't know if some or all of the lenders will try to cure the 
construction contract defaults this week.  I would expect that we would 
receive formal termination letters over the weekend from the contractors if 
the contractors are not paid in full this week.  

Some of you are aware that DPC's relationship with its Indian outside counsel 
has recently shown some strain.  That strain did not affect the quality of 
DPC's representation at the Bombay High Court hearing.  However, I'm also 
pretty sure that the strain has not been permanently "fixed" and that further 
efforts will be required in this regard.  Gail Brownfeld and Jim McCartney 
are helping DPC with these issues.

Bruce

Greg

I was talking with George Wasaff yesterday and he recommended I touch base 
with you in an effort to identify potential Enron interest in acquiring 
WaterDesk assets.

WaterDesk Corp.  was incubated by Azurix  to provide participants in the 
global water industry with a global, single-source, collaborative, 
business-to-business network to efficiently source, transact and manage, 
information, products and services.  We are currently involved in a private 
placement process that does portend some significant possibility for success 
but has not had anyone circle an offer yet.  Time is of the essence.  Given 
current market and industry realities, our priorities have changed in an 
effort to maximize near term opportunity for success. Specifically, in 
addition to offering investors the opportunity to invest in a public 
marketplace solution, we are pursuing other avenues, such as private 
marketplace or buy-side procurement solutions (which seem to be more 
palatable).  We are also broadening our opportunity set by seeking potential 
solutions outside the water industry. Feedback from the various and numerous 
entities that have performed due diligence on WaterDesk  indicate that its 
assets are well suited for any of these alternative solutions.

KEY ELEMENTS OF VALUE:  a qualified and experienced team; intellectual 
property; and, a secure, integrated and operational platform.  

Bottom Line: I have committed to John Garrison that we will deliver some form 
of success by February or we should "pull the plug".  It would be a pity to 
waste such valuable assets (human and physical).  I would like to meet with 
your or your designated representative(s) as soon as possible to determine 
what fit, if any, there might be with Enron endeavors, current or future.  

The attached provides some detailed information that may be of help as you 
reflect on this.

Gentlemen:
I good friend at Sun suggested me to contact  all of you at Enron  in
regard to the direction of my current searching campaign as  I have made
the decision to leave my post as Vice President and General Manager of
Network Associates Latin America and Caribbean. It is of my understanding
that Enron is undergoing a huge  internal transformation to become one of
the leading E-Commerce players worldwide.

Network Associates is the leading and independent provider   of total
security software solutions to monitor and protect telecommunications,
E-Commerce and internet applications worldwide. Since I was given the
mission to start  the region in 1996 I have been instrumental to
increase sales from 2M to 35M US in 4 years. I have been in charge of
supervising and managing over 100 employees across the region and the US
with complete P&L responsibilities.

Previous to join NAI, I worked  for Seagate where I had the
responsibilitity to set up the whole  supply chain in South Florida and
and across the region resulting in a sales increase from 25M to 125M US
in 4 years. With over 20 years of experience selling and transfering
technology internationally I feel proud of my record and accomplishments.


Should any of you be interested in talking to me about any opportunity
within any of your organizations, please do not hesitate to call me at
954-452-0664. Thank you in advance for your positive consideration. Best
regards, Herbert Arturo Molina

Subject: Draft of Organizational Announcement

Announcing the Formation of One Corporate Equity Investing Unit

To better develop and manage equity investment opportunities related to our 
core businesses, Enron has formed one corporate equity investment unit.  This 
new unit, Enron Principal Investments, will combine the existing investment 
units of ENA, EBS and Enron Investment Partners.  Additionally, the Enron 
Special Asset Group will also become part of Enron Principal Investments.  
The strategy of Enron Principal Investments will be to work with the all the 
business units of Enron to identify, execute, and manage equity investments, 
which leverage the Enron's unique and proprietary knowledge.   These 
investments may be in the form of venture capital, LBO's, traditional private 
equity and distressed debt positions.   

Kevin Garland will serve as Managing Director, overseeing all activities of 
Enron Principal Investments.  Gene Humphrey, Michael Miller, Dick Lydecker, 
and their groups, will join Kevin and his group to form this new investments 
unit.

This new group will report to an investment committee consisting of Greg 
Whalley, Ken Rice, and Dave Delainey.  Please join me in congratulating and 
supporting Kevin, Gene, Michael, Dick and the other members of this group in 
this effort.

We had a good visit with the FERC staff yesterday.  Their questions primarily 
focused on the business aspects of EOL (for example, how the different 
business units of trading and accounting/back office interface with the 
software and engineering aspects of EOL).  The attorney had two outstanding 
questions:

1.  What regulations govern EOL or the trades done on EOL?
2.  What types of internal controls are in place with regard to risk 
management of Enron's gas and power trading.  For example, what is the 
ability of Enron to take a position that could potentially affect the 
industry as a whole?

We plan to coordinate a possible call to the FERC attorney by regarding the 
regulation question.  In addition, Steve Kean plans to coordinate a call to 
the attorney with Rick Buy (or other appropriate risk management personnel.)

CONGRATULATIONS ON THE CLOSURE OF THE ALAMAC/AIG TRANSACTION!! Fantastic 
effort and job well done from beginning to end! I don't remember the other 
folks involved on your deal team but I do know this deal would not have 
happened had it not been for you three! I remember when we started this last 
July (remember the $1 DASH ?!), the hurdles that kept popping up (oh, just a 
little bankruptcy proceeding), and the s-l-i-c-k structuring of the entire 
transaction. Bought if for $3.5 million, sold it for $26 million, marked an 
incremental $5 million on a coal contract, and still have the right to 
"broker" another sale and keep 90% of the proceeds ( another $10+ million)!! 
Pretty awesome.

This was really a great job by all! Let me know the date of the celebration 
dinner!

Priggish and piggish in California 
Mark Steyn 
National Post 
A hurricane devastated Tristan da Cunha last month. It swept in May 23, but 
no one heard about it till the other day because it damaged the island's 
radio link to the outside world. The storm blew sheep into the chilly South 
Atlantic, killed many cattle, damaged every single home on the island, 
demolished the hospital and community centre, blew the roof off the radio 
station, and wrecked the Albatross, the only pub in the only village, 
Edinburgh of the Seven Seas. For a week after the storm, the entire island 
was without electricity.
And no one in the rest of the world knew a thing about it! Not the island's 
colonial masters in London. Not the Governor, who doesn't actually reside 
there but prefers to live 1,260 miles away on St. Helena, Tristan da Cunha's 
nearest neighbour. (St. Helena is Manhattan to Tristan's Weehawken, New 
Jersey.) Plunked in the ocean midway between Argentina and South Africa, 
Tristan da Cunha is the world's most isolated human settlement. Its contact 
with the rest of humanity is limited to one annual visit from a British 
supply vessel, plus the occasional cruise ship, which anchors offshore when 
it's safe to do so.
Now that's living off the grid.
The East India Company won a charter to settle Tristan in 1658, and it's been 
a Crown colony since 1834, populated by a handful of families from the 
Scottish borders. There are just seven surnames on the island: Glass, Green, 
Hagan, Lavarello, Repetto, Rogers and Swain. All 290 of them turned up in 
London 40 years ago, when the island's volcano erupted and they were 
evacuated to the Imperial capital. In the roaring traffic's boom, midst the 
glitter of one of the world's great cities, the islanders voted to return 
home -- though even getting there was tricky, as their landing dock was 
covered in lava. Today the colony is virtually self-sufficient in food and 
has a reasonably thriving economy based on crawfish and selling its 
commemorative postage stamps to overseas philatelists.
London has offered o75,000 to repair the communications equipment and pay for 
a new hospital. (You can build a hospital for under 75,000 quid? Amazing.) 
Otherwise, the islanders are just doing what they usually do: making the best 
of things. While they're waiting for the new hospital, they've arranged for a 
South African fishing vessel to ferry out a second-hand X-ray machine when it 
sails next week.
Now, consider by way of contrast, the inhabitants of what George W. Bush 
amusingly calls "the great state of California." Once upon a time, California 
was, like they say of Tristan da Cunha, "the furthest thing," at least in 
terms of the North American continent. Today, with a population the size of 
Canada's, it's one of the world's largest economies, the home base of 
America's biggest industry -- entertainment. But inside many a studio 
vice-president is a Tristan da Cunha islander trying to get out. Deep in 
their hearts (assuming, for the purposes of discussion, that studio 
vice-presidents have hearts), they share the same rugged virtues as the 
Tristanians, though they prefer something a little better than a $100,000 
hospital and they've no desire to scrape a living from catching crawfish, but 
if the pool boy wants to have a go up the deep end he's welcome to try.
And therein lies the contradiction. California's self-inflicted energy crisis 
has exposed the preposterousness of poseur-conservationism in a booming 
economy. Which state has the most rigorous conservation program? California. 
Which has the lowest per capita electricity consumption? California. And 
which state is panicking at the prospect of a summer of rolling blackouts? By 
now impeccably progressive California should have learned the hard way that 
conservation is not a viable policy for a non-stagnant economy.
Instead, a rolling blackout here, a rolling blackout there, and they're 
running around like headless chickens. Governor Gray Davis is lashing out at 
everyone in sight -- Bush and Cheney are "irresponsible," the power 
generators are "unconscionable" -- no, wait, they're "snakes" and "robber 
barons." And how do you treat unconscionable robber snakes like Ken Lay, CEO 
of Enron Corp.? "I would love," said Bill Lockyer, California's 
Attorney-General, "to personally escort Lay to an 8x10 cell that he could 
share with a tattooed dude who says, 'Hi, my name is Spike, honey.' "
As the state's Attorney-General, Mr. Lockyer cannot summarily sentence 
citizens to anal rape, but no doubt, once the guy's convicted, he can make 
some quiet recommendations as to appropriate cell mates. Fortunately for Mr. 
Lay, as chief exec of the world's largest energy trader, he doesn't live in 
California, he lives in Texas. Indeed, very few of the folks the State of 
California would like to sic Spike on are within their jurisdiction: 
Doubtless the taxpayers of British Columbia, whose BC Hydro has been living 
high off the hog on California's woes, could also use a little light buggery, 
but I can't see a Canadian court approving extradition. Nevertheless, in a 
state that's over-regulated, bans new power plants and is addicted to price 
caps, Mr. Lockyer has ingeniously managed to come up with yet another 
disincentive for anybody in the energy business to relocate to La-la-land.
California bought into the soft-eco Sierra Club illusion -- that somehow one 
could be a conservationist, with no consequences for one's economic 
well-being. To put it in terms Californians can understand: Suppose you build 
a house out in the desert. But you don't want to buy a car, because that's 
bad for the environment, isn't it? So instead every morning you call a 
taxicab in the city to drive out, pick you up and take you into the office. 
Not only does it have no environmental benefit but there's no point bitching 
and whining because the driver charges you a fare that bears no relation to 
the cost of gas.
Yet that's what Governor Davis and the Anal Attorney are demanding: price 
caps. Through its own incompetence, California is wholly dependent on energy 
generators and distributors from other jurisdictions. But it expects those 
companies to forgo the interests of their own stockholders and service 
California -- i.e., Hollywood and Silicon Valley -- as an act of public 
welfare. "A 500% profit is swine-like, piggish and totally unreasonable," 
says Medea Benjamin of the California human rights group Global Exchange.
She may have a point, but, if California's going to institute price caps, 
they might like to start closer to home. After all, if Enron's board members 
don't really need those big salaries, do Paramount's or Universal's? I mean, 
sure, Ken Lay has an easy job, but how difficult is it for an exec honcho in 
Century City to sit at a desk and greenlight another John Travolta flop every 
couple of months? I mean, surely, the guy could do the job on, oh, $25,000 a 
year. And that'd be good for conservation, 'cause he'd have to give up the 
Merc and the Cherokee and the LearJet and take the bus. And how about 
Travolta? Instead of $20-million per picture, maybe he could get by on just 
two or three and the remaining $17-million could be put into those renewable 
energy projects he's so keen on. I mean, a $20-million salary isn't just 
swine-like, it's piggish, right?
Since its entry into the Union, California has had what we 19th-century 
imperialists call "responsible government." Tristan da Cunha doesn't. Yet its 
community leaders are behaving far more maturely and responsibly than 
California's. Gray Davis is acting not like the elected Governor of an 
American state but the appointed Governor of a Crown colony, feverishly 
cabling head office to send somebody out to rescue him. You're on your own, 
man. And, if California conservationists find rolling blackouts too onerous, 
they should try spending a week in the dark, cut off from the outside world 
and knowing that, even when the radio starts working again, it's going to 
take months for the second-hand X-ray machine to arrive.

An outstanding year!

2000, of course. It was extraordinary, by any measure.

How many years can you name that start with a great hoax -- Y2K -- and end 
with a monumental hoot -- the world's greatest democracy can't get the hang 
of how to elect a President?

We're not the only mad conspiratorialist to divine that the Y2K scare was the 
brilliant handiwork of a cabal of top computer makers intent on sparking 
sales -- and what a wildly successful scheme it was.

Few, however, are privy to the knowledge that the massive snafu of election 
2000 was no improbable statistical fluke but the Machiavellian contrivance of 
Ross Perot exacting revenge for being denied his usual place on the ballot. 
Besides, it finally occurred to Ross that he wasn't going to be President, 
and that made him as mad as a plucked rooster: If he wasn't going to be 
President, by gum, nobody was going to be President!

Even though election 2000 demonstrated a small defect -- an inability to pick 
a winner (but remember, nothing's perfect) -- it did put to rest some nasty 
aspersions that have long been cast on the workings of this blessed republic. 
Most particularly, it buried once and for all the cynical notion that money 
can buy the Presidency. Both parties spent hundreds of millions of dollars 
trying to do just that -- and came up empty.

So let's not hear any more nonsense about the Presidency being for sale. It's 
now quite clear that the Presidency can't be bought; conceivably, though, it 
can be stolen.

What remains to be determined is which of the pretenders can pull off the 
theft. Mr. Bush would seem to enjoy a congenital advantage, since the 
governor of the state whose votes ultimately will prove decisive is his baby 
brother.

On the other hand, Al Gore has the overwhelming support and counsel of the 
trial lawyers. Trial lawyers, after all, make a profession of knowing how to 
get away with murder. So they should find figuring out how to snatch the 
Presidency mere child's play.

Not the least remarkable thing about this most remarkable year is that the 
Supreme Court seemingly has abandoned its long tradition of following the 
election returns in favor of helping to shape them. The good part is that 
there are nine of them-seven mostly old men and two women of a certain 
age-assuring a majority ruling, unless one recuses himself because he simply 
can't stand Florida.

Only in America in the year 2000.

-- As you're undoubtedly and possibly painfully aware, 2000 is already 
memorable in Wall Street as the year the air began to whoosh out of the 
monster stock-market bubble and, after many a frustrating try, the year the 
bears finally ate Goldilocks.

In fact, unless such portents as mounting claims for unemployment insurance 
and the latest downbeat readings on business from the purchasing managers are 
completely misleading, 2000 will go down as the beginning of the end of the 
most salutary and long-lived economic boom to grace this nation (and probably 
any other).

These are, admittedly, negative distinctions. But if you're a year and want 
to be famous, you can't be picky: No one harks back to 1929 because it was a 
great year for butterflies.

Nasdaq unarguably has turned in a once-in-a-lifetime performance this year. 
Never before has a stock-market index caused as much pain in so short a time 
as did Nasdaq in its breathtaking (and wealth-evaporating) 50% drop from its 
March high to its close last Thursday. What's more, it has a full month to 
better (worsen?) that fantastic feat.

Nor does the plunge in the index -- formidable as it is -- do full justice to 
the awesome decline. A much more graphic picture is painted by the slides in 
individual issues. Here, we're indebted to a sometime correspondent named 
Howard Boyet, who sent us a list of 90 of the most gruesome casualties. Alas, 
space -- and solicitude for those readers of an especially delicate 
disposition -- prevent us from listing the entire wretched roster. But a 
sampling will give you the flavor.

For instance, Foundry Networks, which peaked at 212, was last seen at around 
41. Harmonic has fallen from 158 to 7-plus. Internet Capital from 212 to 6. 
FreeMarkets, from 370 to 29.50 (not quite free yet, but it's getting there). 
VA Linux, from 320 to 8. Red Hat, 151 to 6. Inktomi, 241 to 24. DoubleClick, 
135 to 13. Akamai, 346 to 27. Next Level, 202 to 11 (we dread to contemplate 
the stock's next level). MicroStrategy, 333 to 12 (might be something wrong 
with the strategy). Ask Jeeves, 144 to 10 (if it's all the same, we'd rather 
not ask him). And on and drearily on.

So if you own stocks like Dell Computer (60 to 18) or Gateway (81 to 19) or 
Texas Instruments (100 to 37) or Oracle (46 to 26), you can take some comfort 
in the knowledge that you could have owned any of the above or the likes of 
Razorfish (57 to 3), Novell (44 to 6) or Covad (67 to 2).

These exercises are now commonplace, and journalistically, we suppose, 
they're the equivalent of a circus freak show. But they do, as Mr. Boyet 
suggests, provide a more vivid and even more accurate description of the 
damage wrought.

What we've found most intriguing is that, until now, all this blood in the 
Street has evoked very little public outcry. We've experienced a kind of 
cruel and vast but silent mugging. Magazines like Time and Newsweek haven't 
done their usual heavy-breathing treatments, nor have most newspapers, 
including the New York Times, made a front-page fuss about the decline and 
fall of Nasdaq. Nor are the networks running their usual inane specials.

Moreover, until quite recently, mutual-fund shareholders have placidly 
watched their wealth withering. No crowds gathering in front of fund 
headquarters and, more tellingly, no rush to redeem their holdings.

There are several possible explanations for this rather astonishing 
diffidence on the part of the financially wounded and the absence of hysteria 
in the press, both the electronic version and the genuine item. The 
distraction of the election that never ends. The fact that most everyone who 
wants one still has a job and a relatively high comfort level. Whatever the 
cause or combination of causes, that we're in a bear market, and a vicious 
one, doesn't seem to have sunk in yet.

Until it does and until fear stalks the Street and an ugly grizzly makes the 
cover of Time, if you run into anyone claiming to espy a bottom, take him 
firmly by the hand and guide him to the nearest ophthalmologist.

-- That chart adorning this page depicts another reason why there's lots of 
room still on the downside. (See accompanying illustration -- Barron's Dec. 
4, 2000) It comes to us courtesy of George Gilman, the savvy and talented 
producer of the Business Picture, a wonderful quarterly compilation of charts 
and info on the economy and the markets.

The last official number for the Nasdaq P/E, he reports, was 139.1 for 
October, but he reckons the figure fell to somewhere around 107 by the end of 
November.

As George comments: "Even after the 48.5% decline from the March 10 peak of 
5048.62 to Thursday's close of 2597.93, the P/E on Nasdaq is incredibly high."

And that's the point. The multiple wouldn't be cheap at half its current 
level. Nor would it shock us if, eventually, Nasdaq and its P/E fell another 
50%.

-- While we're convinced we're in the early stages of a secular bear market, 
we know there'll be blips in this descent just as there were dips in the late 
great bull market.

In truth, we're surprised we haven't had a halfway decent rebound yet. 
Certainly, we're overdue for one. Consider this a heads-up on what might 
trigger a bounce (apart from a miraculous resolution to the election snarl).

Next Tuesday, Alan Greenspan is slated to deliver the keynote address to a 
gathering of commmunity bankers in New York City (which is not overrun by 
community banks but is a great place to visit). We haven't a clue as to what 
he intends to say, and it might well be nothing intelligible.

But should Mr. G make a sly reference to the economy and monetary policy and 
hint that maybe the Fed is poised to shift from tight to neutralthat just 
could rouse spirits in Wall Street enough to ignite a fairly brisk -- if 
relatively brief -- move up.

-- John Liscio died last week. John was our colleague at Barron's for roughly 
a half-dozen years in the late 'Eighties and early 'Nineties, and not a day 
went by that he didn't light up the place.

He was vibrant and funny, outrageous and irreverent, extraordinarily 
intelligent. He was brash and tough and had an insatiable appetite for 
mischief. Yet he was also warmly affectionate, shirt-off-his-back generous 
and, oddly, possessed of a touching ingenuousness.

John had an expansive mind that ranged restlessly and relentlessly over just 
about every subject known to literate and inquiring man and a few that only 
his special imagination provided entry to. He was a baseball nut, a 
cantankerous pitcher for and captain of Barron's softball team and a demon 
participant in the Fantasy League, where grown men play at being 
owner-managers of major-league teams. In fact, he was the commissioner of his 
league (in which role, we can only surmise, he visited great anguish on his 
fellow Fantasy Leaguers).

As a writer, John was exceptional. He brought to economics and markets a 
knowledge not only of those murky subjects but also of the wide world; a 
gifted and fluent pen and a sense of humor that could be -- inevitably was -- 
deliciously wicked. He would leap with positive glee on some unfortunate with 
a tempting name. There was a chap named LaWare at the Fed, for example, whom 
John inevitably and with some purpose called UnaWare. Morgan Stanley 
economist Stephen Roach was rarely mentioned by John but as the proprietor of 
the Roach Motel, where the facts check in but don't check out.

He was a brilliant journalist, both at Barron's and at U.S. News, and, 
against all advice and odds, launched an economic newsletter, the Liscio 
Report, which became a roaring success. The reason was simply that John had 
more wit in one pinky and more insight in the other than any dozen economists.

John, who was spunk personified, showed unbelievable courage as he battled 
his last illness. When we visited him in his hospital room and told him 
joshingly he looked like hell, he grinned that indomitable grin of his and 
launched into a couple of hours of dissertation on the state of the world, 
excitedly detailing his plans for the future.

He was the most indomitable person we've ever met. All of us here at Barron's 
and, for that matter, anyone lucky enough to have known him, will miss him 
terribly.

Here is a draft position report we talked about previously. We had delayed 
distribution because we were waiting for some important input on the Sithe 
contract.

The report attempts to view various assets and positions entirely on an 
economic basis, regardless of accounting treatment. Currently this is not 
exhaustive since the universe of economic exposure is significant but if 
useful we will spread the net. 

Here are the highlights:

Enron stock option plans: 

ENE is low and volatility is around 45 - 50%. We are working with Global 
Finance and Accounting on a hedging proposal.

J Block CRTA:

We have not factored in the impact of yesterday's House of Lords ruling on 
this contract.

Korea:

USD/KRW has gone from 1205 to 1368. Economic outlook is bleak. Enron's 
currency translation account (CTA) has gone from $19m Dr to $40m Dr since 
January.

Brazil:

Argentina's woes are not helping. USD/BRL is currently 2.17 from 1.95 in 
January. CTA has suffered $173m in losses and now stands at $663m Dr.




Thoughts and comments welcome.

	CheMatch.com continues auction growth
Dec 04, 2000 10:12 AM ET 
	HOUSTON, Dec. 4 (LocalBusiness.com) -- CheMatch.com said more than 95,000 
metric tons of chemicals were traded in November through its private auction 
system -- a volume equal to more than half of the total trades since the 
auction's inception last summer. 
	In a written statement, Ed Moody, CheMatch.com's vice president of auctions 
said the private auction system uses real-time pricing feedback and can be 
tailored to the needs of each user. 
	Since CheMatch.com started the private auctions, about 50 companies have 
traded more than 175,000 metric tons of products including chemicals, 
polymers and fuel products. The average value of completed transactions is 
about $800,000. 
	In addition to auctions, CheMatch.com also operates a commodity chemicals, 
polymers and fuel products exchange on which more than 1 million metric tons 
of product has been transacted. 
	CheMatch has recently completed a restructuring that included layoffs, and 
early last month it withdrew a planned initial public offering. 
	Clay Jeansonne, CheMatch.com spokesman, told LocalBusiness.com last week the 
company currently has 85 employees down from 93 and that CheMatch expects to 
bring in new funding from venture capital and technology companies by the end 
of the year. 
	Privately held CheMatch.com is an Internet-based marketplace for the buyers 
and sellers of bulk commodity chemicals, plastics and fuel products. Its 
investors currently include Battery Ventures, Bayer AG (NYSE: BAYZY), 
Computer Sciences Corp. (NYSE: CSC), DuPont (NYSE: DD), GE (NYSE: GE) and 
Millennium Chemicals (NYSE: MCH).

o Online Marketing Firm iChoose Shuts Down

DALLAS -- iChoose, a developer of e-commerce marketing
systems, said it has shut down due to lack of funding.
In the past couple of months, the company has struggled
to stay alive by seeking out additional funding,
and even signed a letter of intent to be acquired.
That  acquisition fell through and the company said
it had no other choice than to close. iChoose was
unable to disclose the would-be-acquirer due to
legal restrictions. On its Web site, the company
posted a message with uninstall instructions for
its software and a final farewell to its customers.
iChoose was backed by Sevin Rosen.

o Commerce Software Firm Momenta Gets $5 Million Round One

AUSTIN, Texas -- Momenta, a software company providing
collaborative commerce applications and services
for electronic marketplaces, said it has raised $5
million in its first round of funding. Authosisa,
a Hong Kong-based venture capital firm, led the
round, which also included American Pacific Technology

Subject: Enron Center North/Enron Center South Damage & Restoration Overview

Bill/Philippe-

Below is a summary of the major problems which occurred the past 96 hours and 
the steps taken to mitigate the damage and risk.

Enron Center North (1400 Smith)

As a result of the flooding downtown, approximately six skyscrapers had their 
electrical vaults flooded and began to cause cascading problemd in the 
electrical grid downtown. The net result was the loss of one of the two 35kv 
circuits which serve 1400 Smith. We (engineers, EES Maint, electrical subs)  
believe at the time the circuits blew we shifted from three phase to single 
phase power, which caused an imbalance in the load to the building. 

Consequently, UPS "C" which serves a portion of the Lv 34 Data Ctr, the Rolm 
phone switch, and a protion of the Traders floors lost a circuitboard, and 
blew two internal fuses. This power degradation caused PDU "S" on Lv 34 to 
trip its main breaker and shutdown power load to servers and equipment on 
this PDU. This occurred shortly after Noon on Saturday.

Response/Restoration

> UPS "D" transferred load from UPS "C" as the N+1 back up and carried the 
full load of the UPS loss as designed
> EPSC/electrical sub (Henderson Electric); EES Maint; IT worked together to 
power down systems to begin repair work by 4:00pm Saturday
> EPSC/EES Maint coordinated with Pillar/Henderson Elec to obtain replacement 
parts and begin the repairs. By 9:30pm all repairs to UPS"C" had been made 
and the system bought back on line. As a measure of extra protection the back 
up genset for Enron Ctr North  was in operation
> Reliant Energy restored the circuit at approximately 10:30pm Saturday 
evening
> EPSC/EES Maint and subs conducted a thorough review of all electrical and 
back up systems Saturday evening
> Enron Network IT Operations began restoration of all affected systems 
Saturday evening
> EPSC/EES Maint obtained diesel fuel and topped off all gensets Saturday in 
case of additional problems and due to fuel consumption during the outage

Other Building damage was limited to flooding in the tunnels, and water 
damage/flooding to portions of the Body Shop on Lv B-1

Enron Center South (1500 Louisiana)

Impact/Damage Summary

> Levels 8 & 9  received very limited amounts of water from the core area 
elevator shafts and exterior curtainwall. There was no exposure to water on 
any systems or network cabling during the entire period. (Response) Crews 
contained and cleaned all water as it traced into the building.
> ALL IDF closets on Lvs 3-5 Traders Floors remained dry throughout the 
duration of the rains/flooding on Friday & Saturday
> Lv 6 received some water from Lv 7. (Response) The area was contained and 
cleaned. No additional damage beyond Tuesday evenings flooding occurred
> Due to extreme street flooding and water pressure, a 10" sanitary sewer 
line tied into ECS burst on Friday evening causing extensive flooding of Lv  
B-1 area (approximately 4-6 inches of water in the basement. (Response)  
Clark & Way Engr was able to install a temporary plug in the line to stop the 
on going flood waters from penetrating the basement. Clean up has continued 
throughout the weekend   
> Due to the extreme flooding and water pressure, the water seal of the 
Reliant Vault burst early Saturday and flooded the electrical vault room with 
24-30" of water. This resulted in a complete loss of power at approximately 
1:30pm on Staurday afternoon. The back up systems engaged and operated per 
design to support the Data Ctr and Traders Floors. The temporary cooling 
tower went off line. Prior to the flooding Clark had been in the process of 
tieing in the temporary feed into the back up system by 7-1-01 in prep for 
the migration (Response) 
 * Clark used back up water pumps to pump out and clean the Reliant 
electrical vault, as well as maintained operation of the back up systems
 * The Data Ctr AHU's were kept on line with the dehumidifiers/blowers to 
modulate the airflow in the Data Ctr. EPSC had Way Engr techs use 
temp/humidity probes
    to monitor the areas. The recordings indicated temps on Lvs 8 & 9 did not 
exceed 78 degrees and relative humidity did not exceed 68% during the outage
 * Clark/Fisk Elec/EPSC coordinated desing efforts and obtained gear on an 
emergency basis and completed the tie in off the temporary coolong tower to 
the 
    generators by 10:30pm
 * Reliant Energy is still cleaning and replacing gear in th vault room. 
Presntly (AT 11:00PM Sunday) we have one circuit operational in the building 
and 50% of the
              Reliant  gear on line). We are still operating all systems 
safely on the back up sytems for the past 36 hours. It is expected Relaint 
will be complete by 7:00am.
   Clark; the engineers and MEP subs shall be conducting a thorough system 
review and repirs as required of all systems throughout the building during 
the coming
   week.

In summary, the back up systems in both facilities did engage and operate as 
designed; however, due to the extreme conditons and stress placed upon the 
systems the facility held up extremely well. I would also like to note 
throughout the ordeal beginning Friday evening through Sunday, everyone 
(Enron NetWorks;EES FacilitiesClark Const;Way Engring;Fisk Electric;Henderson 
Electric; KW-Pillar;Hines) did an outstanding job under enourmous pressure 
and the most severe conditions I have seen in downtown Houston. 
Communication, around the clock work  and cool heads managed to assess damage 
and develop action/restoration plans to facilitate repairs for Monday business

Let me know if you need further details on specific issues or items.

regards-

Henry

Eric

I do NOT want to announce this when it happens.  We have been quietly 
avoiding how much activity we have done so far and many people assume that we 
already have done many...an assumption that helps us.  So please do NOT issue 
this.

______________________________________________

Greetings Friends,

The election results in Florida have been certified in accordance with 
Florida state law and the rulings of the Florida Supreme Court, and Governor 
Bush and Secretary Cheney have won that state's 25 electoral votes.  It is 
now time to get on with the business of organizing a new administration.

In order to begin that task, we have filed articles of incorporation for the 
Bush/Cheney Presidential Transition Foundation, a non-profit corporation.  As 
past transition foundations have done, we are applying for 501(c)(4) status 
from the Internal Revenue Service.  Now we are asking for your help as our 
team moves forward with plans for an orderly transition process in the short 
period between now and inauguration day, January 20, 2001.

While the Presidential Transition Act of 1963, as amended in 1988, 
specifically authorizes public funds for transitions, it also makes 
provisions for raising contributions from private sources to help defray 
transition-related expenses.  This has been done previously, most recently in 
1992.  We are now soliciting contributions from our most active supporters.  
Would you please visit our new transition website at 
www.bushcheneytransition.com and make a contribution on our secure server.

We have made the decision to accept contributions only from individuals.  No 
corporate or political action committee contributions will be accepted.  
Contributions may not exceed $5,000 per person or $10,000 per couple, and all 
contributors, in compliance with Governor Bush's position of full-disclosure 
of financial contributions, will be posted on the transition website on a 
real-time basis.  These contributions will not count against an individual's 
annual political contribution federal giving limit of $25,000.

The American voters have spoken, and we are moving forward to establish a 
government that will unify our country and make the common principles we

Comments from US Supreme Court Justice Scalia

"One of the principal issues in the appeal we have accepted is precisely 
whether the votes that have been ordered to be counted are, under a 
reasonable interpretation of Florida law, 'legally cast vote[s].'  The 
counting of votes that are of questionable legality does in my view threaten 
irreparable harm to petitioner, and to the country, by casting a cloud upon 
what he claims to be the legitimacy of his election.  Count first, and rule 
upon legality afterwards, is not a recipe for producing election results that 
have the public acceptance democratic stability requires."

"Another issue in this case, moreover, is the propriety, indeed the 
constitutionality, of letting the standard for determination of voters' 
intent- dimpled chad, hanging chads, etc.- vary from county to county, as the 
Florida Supreme court opinion, as interpreted by the Circuit Court, permits.  
If petitioner [Bush] is correct that counting in this fashion is unlawful, 
permitting the count to proceed on that erroneous basis will prevent an 
accurate recount from being conducted on a proper basis later, since it is 
generally agreed that each manual recount produces a degradation of the 
ballots, which renders a subsequent recount inaccurate."

Comments from Florida Supreme Court Chief Justice Charles T. Wells


DISSENT OF CHIEF JUSTICE CHARLES J. WELLS
"I...believe that the majority's decision cannot withstand scrutiny which 
will certainly immediately follow under the United States Constitution."
Excerpt:
"I want to make it clear at the outset of my separate opinion that I do not 
question the good faith or honorable intentions of my colleagues in the 
majority. However, I could not more strongly disagree with their decision to 
reverse the trial court and prolong this judicial process. I also believe 
that the majority's decision cannot withstand the scrutiny which will 
certainly immediately follow under the United States Constitution."

"My succinct conclusion is that the majority's decision...has no foundation 
in the law of Florida as it existed on November 7, 2000, or at anytime until 
the issuance of this opinion. The majority returns the case to the circuit 
court for this partial recount of  under-votes on the basis of unknown or, at 
best, ambiguous standards with authority to obtain help from others, the 
credentials, qualifications, and objectivity of whom are totally unknown. 
That is but a first glance at the imponderable problems that the majority 
creates."

"This case has reached the point where finality must take precedence over 
continued judicial process. I agree with a quote from John Allen Paulos, a 
professor of mathematics at Temple University, when he wrote that, "[t]he 
margin of error in this election is far greater than the margin of victory, 
no matter who wins." Further judicial process will not change this 
self-evident fact and will only result in confusion and disorder. Justice 
Terrell and this Court wisely counseled against such a course of action 
sixty-four years ago. I would heed that sound advice and affirm Judge Sauls."

Restructuring Today readers got this story today...

Retail market
can be opened
nationally?
---
Joe Barton thinks
it can and is
about to try
---
Once in 20 years
opportunity seen

How can the retail power market be opened in today's atmosphere?
     Joe Barton has a way and it sounds like it just might work.
     He briefed APPA members winding up the last day of the annual
meeting in Washington.   Barton implored the membership that if they
have any ideas on how to improve energy policy, this is the time to tell
policy makers or him.
     Barton sees a narrow, six-week opportunity as America is about to
revise its energy policy.
     We walked with him to his car after the speech and asked what he
means by a major energy restructuring bill.
     He referred vaguely to legislation that would improve the grid and
foster the functioning of a robust market providing for movement of
power from one place to another.
     He wants a national market with a grid that can handle it "in an
open access way -- creating all these trading markets where you have
long-term and short-term markets where you balance supply and demand
around the country.
     "States that have surplus power, through the RTO system can wheel
that power to states that need it."
     That's the wholesale market, we asked.
     Yes.
     But what about retail?
     He hopes to get into the law a provision to foster aggregation of
buyers.
     How would that work?
     "AARP," Barton said noticing our age, "could sell you power or Wal-
Mart or McDonalds or the co-ops.  You could buy your power through
them."
     How would a law provide for aggregation?
     "It would be in the federal legislation that it would be
permitted," he replied.
     But what about Nebraska where there are only munis?
     "You've got to work through that and see if you get some kind of
grandfather or state opt-out provision.  It's possible that you give
states the right to opt out.  But over time those states will want to
opt in," he added.
     "That'll be a debate we'll have when we get into the bill.  You're
not supposed to ask that tough a question this early in the process," he
reminded with a smile.
     Barton is really impressed with the magnitude of the legislation
gestating in the nation's capital.
     "Everything" is up for discussion, he said, "everything.
     "There is nothing -- nothing -- that's been debated or talked about
in terms of electricity that is not on the table," Barton assured.
     "I'm not saying we're going to do it all but you have a window like
this once every 20 to 30 years.  I'm going to be damned if I'm going to
stand around and on my on volition take things off the table.
     "Now the process will automatically take a lot more controversial
items out of play.  There'll be a region or a political block -- who
knows the president might not like something.  John Dingell might not
like something.  Who knows?  But I'm not -- even before we put pen to
paper to start drafting the bill -- say `we're not going to consider
this'," Barton added.
     Is he getting signals from Dingell that he might be cooperative?
     "Yeah.  Very cooperative.  Of course, again, the proof is in the
pudding and in the details."
     Barton's in the leadership role in fostering a national energy
policy, taking the package from the vice president and guiding it
through the House.
     He's the president's energy guy from an energy state and Bush has
shown -- with the tax bill -- that he can get a program enacted.
     Barton wants something he can look back at in five, 10 and 20 years
and say "that's a good bill.  It works."
     Barton wants to make history with the Energy Policy Act of 2001.
     Barton told APPA he wants this big bill to be "national, long-term
in its impact and balanced."
     Balanced means looking at the generation component, transmission
and distribution "and in each of those areas -- this is just me.  I'm
not speaking for anyone but myself" -- he wants "to create an
environment so we have a maximum, competitive situation that's open and
fair to everybody.
     "And we're going to do that and you're going to have a lot of
competition, a lot of flexibility with a lot of choice for consumers and
a lot of choice for yourself," Barton added.
     Wait a minute.
     He's saying competition in transmission and distribution.
     We really do need to ask him what he has in mind there when the
time is right.
     We can't help but think of competition in selling pipeline capacity
in a secondary market.
     You can do that with electricity capacity to or on a local
distribution system in gas.  We're thinking aloud here.  That's not what
Barton said.
     He wants to minimize the federal role except where you actually
have to.
     That puts Barton "a little at variance with some in the Bush
Administration and some in the Congress because in the modern age
there's a natural proclivity to centralize and consolidate which in the
political arena means let Washington do it."
     Barton wants to maximize the technology component and will put into
the bill a distributed generation component.
     He's interested in negawatts, fostering cut backs in demand on a
national scale.
     "Looking out for your own interest," Barton considers to be
"democracy."
     But from time to time you have to step back and look at the
national interest, he advocated.
     "That's my job."
     Today's crisis mentality helps Congress act boldly.
     The friendliness to competitive markets in the White House
encouraged by the president's pride about the retail bill he got through
the Texas Legislature plus today's environment may be ideal for market-
minded leaders.

The EES VaR for today is $16.9 million, up from $15.6 million, due primarily 
to additional short positions added to the Power West portfolio.  The short 
positions associated with the Univerisity of California facilities are 
expected to be removed early this week, which should decrease VaR.

Summary:

* Toyota Managing Director Hiroyuki Watanabe commented that broad
cooperation was needed on fuel cell technology development as it pertains to
vehicles in order to commercialize the technology for this application.
While Toyota continues to develop hybrid vehicles, Watanabe believes fuel
cell vehicle technology has high hurdles to overcome.  In February the
automaker unveiled a prototype fuel cell vehicle, the FCHV-3, which also
includes a secondary nickel-metal hydride battery.

What ?
We had $89m of value-at-risk concentrated primarily in Nymex short positions 
through July, August and September 01and we were $30m over our VaR limit for 
this commodity as at last night's close.
I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't say this looks way out of bounds.
Has this been sanctioned ?

On November 8, the Office of the Chairman, issued an important communicatio=
n,=20
announcing significant organizational changes in Enron's worldwide=20
operations. The purpose of this memo is to share with you the decisions tha=
t=20
are underway to restructure  Enron=01,s operations in South America.  The b=
asic=20
organizational framework has been set.=20

As you know, Diomedes Christodoulou and Jim Bannantine will be assuming new=
=20
responsibilities within Enron. Replacing them will be Orlando Gonzalez and=
=20
Joe Kishkill, who will become the Co-Presidents of South America, reporting=
=20
to Dave Delainey and John Lavorato.  They will share overall responsibility=
;=20
however, Orlando=01,s focus will be on direct sales origination,=20
commercial/government relationships and regulatory issues.  Joe=01,s focus =
will=20
be on wholesale origination, financial and operating performance and overal=
l=20
country management.  In addition, Orlando will continue as President and CE=
O=20
of Elektro until its ultimate sale.

The existing, large integrated asset base in South America (excluding=20
Elektro) will be managed and operated by Rebecca McDonald and Jim Hughes in=
=20
Enron Global Assets, which is part of Enron Wholesale Services under Mark=
=20
Frevert. Ultimately, there will be very close coordination in both Brazil a=
nd=20
Argentina between Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets to ensure that our=
=20
reputation in South America is protected, our asset positions are being=20
managed prudently and that commercial opportunities surrounding these asset=
s=20
are pursued.

The remaining natural gas and electrical commercial activities in South=20
America will be organized around the highly successful North American netwo=
rk=20
business model.  This model employs people, market making, physical=20
commodities, capital and assets to provide reliable, flexible and high-valu=
e=20
products to our customers.  It is people and intellectual capital based and=
=20
enjoys high rates of return on invested capital.

In the interest of pursuing this strategy, the following teams will report =
to=20
Joe and Orlando:
=20
The Commercial Origination team will be lead by Brett Wiggs.  The team will=
 =20
focus on covering South American markets, primarily Brazilian and Argentine=
=20
natural gas and electricity, with the following goals:

? Generating new, innovative, reliable and high value products and services=
=20
needed by the market by utilizing our commodity, asset and capital=20
capabilities;
? Providing those products and services across South America and across the=
=20
value chain, including wholesale and retail, based upon the highest value=
=20
opportunity;
? Finding structural value arbitrages in the South American market and move=
=20
quickly to capitalize;
? Assisting the Risk Management and Trading organization in managing the=20
overall risk of the organization;
? Managing all new power and asset development opportunities in South Ameri=
ca=20
consistent with this strategy, and
? Providing the Risk Management and Trading organization information and de=
al=20
flow.

The Commercial Origination team will consist of a diverse group of people w=
ho=20
work as a single team which bring the required skills including commodity,=
=20
capital, regulatory, asset, development, market, structuring, deal executio=
n,=20
finance and country knowledge necessary to reach our goals.=20

The Trading and Risk Management team will be headed by Remi Collonges.  The=
=20
team will continue to develop pricing information and manage the price book=
=20
for the relevant energy markets in support of the wholesale and direct sale=
s=20
efforts.  Additionally, the team will work toward implementation of activel=
y=20
trading South American energy commodities.  This group will be responsible=
=20
for managing Enron South America=01,s overall risk and will have a direct=
=20
reporting relationship with John Lavorato in his role as head of the Americ=
as=20
risk activities.

The Argentine effort will be integrated into the overall South American=20
Commercial Origination and Trading and Risk Management groups; however, we=
=20
will continue to maintain an Argentine office headed by Michael Guerriero. =
=20

The goal of the reorganization is to create a flat team oriented organizati=
on=20
that is very market and commercially focused.  The following support=20
functions will assist the overall business objectives of the commercial tea=
m=20
and will report into Joe and Orlando, plus into their line functions in=20
Houston.  The overall goal is to ensure that the South American business=20
units have an adequate support organization to evaluate opportunities, as=
=20
well as manage day-to-day business and risk.  Otherwise, the Houston=20
infrastructure will provide resources as needed to manage peak requirements=
=20
in South America, not unlike other businesses in Enron Americas.

These groups include:

The Government Affairs team, which will be headed by Sergio Assad, will=20
manage the relationships with the relevant regulatory agencies as well as=
=20
governmental ministries.  The primary regulatory goal will be to facilitate=
,=20
in the near term, substantive changes to the regulatory rules to allow a=20
functioning wholesale traded market in Brazil and Argentina. Sergio will=20
assume his responsibilities upon completion of the Elektro sale.  During th=
is=20
interim period, Jose Bestard will continue to be in charge of the regulator=
y=20
function.  Once Sergio makes the transition, he will also report to Rick=20
Shapiro in Enron Government Affairs.

The Finance team will be headed by Britaldo Soares.  The team will manage t=
he=20
interface with Enron Global Finance.  Britaldo will transition from his=20
current duties at Elektro upon completion of the Elektro sale.  Britaldo wi=
ll=20
also report to Joe Deffner in Enron Global Finance.  Rob Gay will be=20
assisting Britaldo during the transition, while continuing his work on the=
=20
Cuiaba project.

The Legal team, which will be lead by Randy Young, as general counsel, and=
=20
John Novak, as deputy general counsel, will manage South America=01,s legal=
=20
requirements.  Randy and John will also report to Mark Haedicke in Enron=20
Wholesale Services - Legal Department.

Miguel Padron will become Chief of Staff.  Human Resources, Information=20
Technology, Treasury, Accounting & Reporting, as well as Administration wil=
l=20
report to Miguel.  This will bring focus to essential, but non-commercial=
=20
functions, as well as more efficiently manage key matrix reporting=20
relationships with Enron.  Miguel will also report to David Oxley in Enron=
=20
Wholesale Services =01) Human Resources and Wes Colwell in Enron Wholesale=
=20
Services =01) Business Analysis and Reporting.

These changes are consistent with Enron's evolving business strategy and=20
reflect our continuing commitment to grow the company by maximizing our=20
financial and intellectual capital.  However, in line with the new=20
organizational structure and the near term potential for business in the=20
region, further budget reductions will be necessary.  People directly=20
affected will be notified shortly.
=20
Enron is committed to continue the successful implementation of its=20
businesses in South America.  We believe that as the markets develop, we ar=
e=20
uniquely positioned to leverage Enron=01,s core capabilities and create=20
shareholder value.

Attached please find a Tax Review of California Senate Bill No. 1 ("SB 1X").  
The Tax Review sets out the practical implication (likely cessation of 
electricity sales and curtailment of investment in new generation assets) and 
constitutional deficiencies of SB 1X.  Please note, SB 1X will not apply to 
sales of electricity made pursuant to binding written contracts executed on 
or before the date SB 1X is signed into law (if ever).  

The California Senate has passed SB 1X.  The California Assembly has drafted 
their own version, Assembly Bill No. 128 ("AB 128X"), which the Assembly is

The following points highlight legal/regulatory recommendations to the 
business team on the DA suspension issue.

All intelligence indicates that the CPUC will act on this issue at its June 
28, 2001 meeting (and there are sufficient votes for the decision).
Existing Contracts - It is our recommendation that EES should submit any and 
all DASRs to initiate DA service  to the appropriate Utility no later than 
June 29, 2001 for all customers that have existing contracts if we want to 
ensure DA service.
New Contracts - All new contracts should be signed by both EES and the 
customer no later than June 30, 2001 (July 1, 2001 is a Sunday).  DASRs for 
these contracts should be submitted to the appropriate Utility as soon as 
possible, but in no event later than July 6, 2001.  The July 6 date is our 
estimate of the last date the Utility would accept DASRs for new contracts.  
It is important to note that the CPUC is keeping the clock on contract 
execution timing.
Switching Option - Customers that are on DA service can be returned to the 
Utility per the tariff process.  Once the customer has been returned to 
Utility service after July 1, 2001, our expectation is that there will be no 
ability to have this customer receive DA service in a future timeframe.  In 
addition, returning to Utility service may incur a "re-entry fee".
Contract Extensions - EES should consider amending all current contracts that 
terminate after July 1, 2001 with a Evergreen Provision that provides for 
Index pricing with 30 day cancellation notice provisions.  These amendments 
should be signed prior to June 30, 2001.  It is possible that the CPUC will 
require marketers to detail the termination dates of their DA customers.  One 
additional thought - EES may consider having the customer assign any Negative 
CTC receivable to EES as compensation for the Evergreen provision (to 
overcome the CPUC language that indicates that the customer is due the 
Negative CTC credit).

We intend to set up a call for 5pm Houston time today to discuss (call-in 
number to follow).

I would suggest that we start reporting Capital Deployed and Funds Flow 
numbers in these reports as well
as the Wholesale Group will need to take the lead in managing both.

I'm not still short QQQ.  I covered at 68 1/2 in the after market while we 
were on the phone, after the Florida supreme court statement.

The world has gone truly crazy about CA energy prices.

Not expecting any job changes due to the Skilling/Lay thing.  But a lot of 
people are giving me shit anyway.  The recent reorganization that gave me my 
current job was done so that Skilling wouldn't have to put anyone in the COO 
position.

o Security Firm Appgate Raises $10.2 Million Third Round

Attached is an invitation to the Summer Picnic this Saturday, June 23 from 
4:00-9:00 pm at the Regal Ranch.  Many of you may have already received this, 
but I wanted to extend my personal invitation to you.  This is a really fun 
activity, and has traditionally been one of the best opportunities to visit 
with our Program participants on an informal basis.  This is a family outing 
with lots of activities for the kids, and you can come and go as you please.

Please make an effort to attend on Saturday, even if you can only join us for 
a little while.  Feel free to pass this invitation on to other executives in 
your business unit.  The Analysts and Associates tell us that this type of 
exposure to our business leaders helps drive excitement and enthusiasm within 
the Program.  Your support of events like this is incredibly valuable, and 
appreciated.

If you can join us, please rsvp to Jackie Coleman by email, or at extension 
x54070.

Thank you,
Billy

CALIFORNIA  SITUATION CLARITY IMPROVING; MOST LIKELY OUTCOME FAVORABLE FOR
ALL
* While we do not expect a direct rate increase or removal of the rate
freeze for EIX or PCG out of the California Public Utility Commission
meeting today, we are encouraged by the conciliatory tone of recent
comments.
* In our view, acerbic rhetoric has finally given way to pragmatic
reconciliation and it now appears that California utilities are on the path
towards effectively receiving the rate increases they require to remain
solvent.
* We believe this has implications not only for the health of the
affected utilities, but also for the Growth Energy Merchants and Competitive
Generators.
* While the credit risk associated with utilities' power market
purchases have not been solved yet, the credit risk in the California market
has eased somewhat.
* While trading may be choppy as the final California remedy is
hammered out, we recommend the purchase of the Growth Energy names
throughout any near-term weakness possible as a result of the process.
* Decision expected today at 4:00 PM EST.

Greg, I received the list of players on the PG&E side today from Glynn's 
office.  I called Mark Haedicke to give him the rundown, and he feels 
comfortable with you and Jeff attending the meeting alone.  As Jeff will be 
arriving in Dallas from San Francisco, you will need to get yourself to 
Dallas; however, we will add your name to the manifest for the return to 
Houston unless we hear otherwise from you.  

Below are the details as we know them now:

Date:  Friday, June 22
Time:  12:30 p.m.-2:30 p.m.
Location: 100 Crescent Court, 6th Floor (Wasserstein's offices), Dallas
PG&E players: Bob Glynn, Chairman & CEO, PG&E Corp.
  Gordon Smith, President & CEO, PG&E utility
  Fong Wan, VP, Risk Initiatives, PG&E Corp.
  Ken Beckfire, Wasserstein
  Joe Sauvage, Investment Advisor, Lehman Bros.
ENE players: Jeff Skilling
  Greg Whalley

As new details become available, we'll pass them to you right away.  SRS

I am in complete agreement with the below (except I think the applause for 
our demise was, unfortunately, rather more aggressive!!). This was my first 
exposure to the non-European Steel players and found myself quite amazed at 
the few number of "public" advocates that we had at the conference in 
consideration of what we are offering.  The one-on-one contact with the 
attendees was completely the opposite.  We talked with a broad and numerous 
set of people who, coming to the booth as sceptics (they think that were are 
in the market just to grab the physical business), left with cards in hand 
and future risk management meetings in mind.  Big buyers (eg GE, Emerson) and 
consultants (eg Accenture, McK, etc) were particularly receptive and should 
be courted as public advocates for what we are doing.

Subject: Steel Stradegies Conference - NYC 06/20/01

Yesterday, during the Panel V discussion, "Why Have Steel Middlemen Gone From 
The Most Threatened To Best Positioned", we got some direct feedback on the 
perception of Enron in the marketplace. The participants were, Fred Lamesh 
CEO of Trademarked Inc., Michael Siegel, CEO of Olympic Steel, Bud Siegel, 
CEO of Russell Metals, and Wilfred von Bulow, CEO of Ferrostaal Inc.; the 
moderator was Peter Marcus, Managing Partners of World Steel Dynamics. Each 
participant gave a brief speech about their respective companies which was 
followed by a Q&A session. The first mention of Enron was during Michael 
Siegal's speech in which he mentioned that Olympic Steel had "sold material 
to Enron" and that "Enron has recognized that steel is a commodity and for 
many countries represents currency."  Michael was clearly proud of his 
transactions with Enron and agreed with our view of steel as a commodity.
The real feedback came during the Q&A. Peter Marcus posted the following 
question to the panelists. "What about Enron? With their plan of entering the 
market with a number of hubs across the country, stocking material, with 
large scale distribution on a "spot" basis. Will this business model work? Do 
they offer any real value or not?" 
Following are the respective responses as best I can reiterate from my notes 
( please don't quote me on this):
Fred Lamesh, TradeArbed: "The concept is too new to make a judgment yet on 
credibility. Enron has certainly been successful in the past and should not 
be discounted. I question their ability to procure material at competitive 
enough levels to make this a profitable venture but there may be some value 
in their delivery of financial instruments."
Michael Siegal, Olympic Steel: "Enron certainly has the financial means to 
withstand a "break even" business to support their financial instruments. At 
this point, we view them as just another entity in the market and until we 
can evaluate their performance, it is difficult to determine value. I am 
concerned though that they will prop up under capitalized distributors and 
allow them to operate despite mismanagement. One interesting and unique 
concept that they are trying to bring to the industry though is the idea that 
a contract is a contract, with liquidated damages for non performance. That 
would certainly be change (sporadic laughter among the crowd)."
Bud Siegel, Russell Metals: "I addressed the Enron question last night during 
dinner and was told that I was abusive to the young lady from Enron (Tammy, I 
later understood that you had a less than cordial conversation with Bud the 
previous evening). I am calling Enron the "Hunts of the steel business" with 
their idea of buying up the market. The whole concept is like Swiss cheese. 
You can not put up depots, buy from steel mills, and expect to sell the same 
steel to distributors cheaper than the mills themselves. The logistical 
expenses alone guarantee failure. You can not be everything to everyone. 
Considering the current state of under financing in this industry, they will 
inevitably end up financing bankrupt people and take credit hits. Without 
immediate success, Enron has been known to exist markets quickly in the past, 
and I believe they will be gone within the year."(some sporadic applause)   
Wilfried von Bulow, Ferrostaal: "Right now they are just another additional 
player in the market. They will certainly have an impact but it would not be 
pragmatic to make a judgment yet on their ability to succeed. Let's watch it 
and see if there is any value to what they are trying to bring to the market."
It appears to me that the focus on Enron in the market right now continues to 
be more on the physical aspects of what we are doing and not enough emphasis 
or credibility is being given to the financial tools we are bringing. It is 
obviously very easy to poke holes in a concept of trading large volumes of 
physical steel on a "spot" basis through the set up of physical hubs around 
the country. In the end, the only way we will be successful will be by 
bringing liquidity to our index through financial instruments. We need to 
focus more on educating customers about our financial tools, developing our 
curve, and bringing players to the market.

5    What They're Saying...


"Well, if you're a fan of chaos, you're in Nirvana."
- John Shubin [Florida Elections Expert] MSNBC, 12/08/00

_________________________________________________________________


1
SUMMARY OF FLORIDA SUPREME COURT DECISION

~ A deeply divided Florida Supreme Court has opened up a Pandora's
  box of inconsistent standards, flawed hand counting, and delays
  that call into question Florida's ability to be represented in
  the Electoral College.

~ Further, the court's narrow, liberal majority has made a mockery
  of the idea of "counting every vote" by selecting only certain
  ballots and providing no standard to count them.  The four
  activist justices rewrote Florida's election laws after the
  election -- a clear violation of federal law.

~ Florida Supreme Court Chief Justice Wells offered a stinging and
  forceful dissent; concluding:

  ~ "The majority's decision cannot withstand the scrutiny which
    will certainly immediately follow under the United States
    Constitution"

  ~ "The majority's decision to return the case to the circuit
    court for a count of the under-votes from Miami-Dade County or
    all counties has no foundation in the law of Florida as it
    existed on November 7, 2000..."

  ~ "I have a deep and abiding concern that the prolonging of
    judicial process in this counting contest propels this country
    and this state into an unprecedented and unnecessary
    constitutional crisis.

  ~ Judge Wells said the county-by county decision-making on the
    "clear indication of the intent of the voter":  "is fraught with
    equal protection concerns which will eventually cause the
    election results in Florida to be stricken by the federal courts
    or Congress."

~ For example, in Miami-Dade County, the justices reinstated 168
  votes that were awarded to Gore as the result of manual recounts
  conducted in only some precincts - all of them overwhelmingly
  Democratic. This would be the ultimate in treating some votes
  differently from others.

~ The Court ordered a recount of all counties' undervotes, but
  there are five major problems:

  ~ First, in many counties the undervotes aren't even segregated,
    so they will have to be machine tabulated and separated. We
    know this causes chads to fall off ballots and other
    degradation of ballots.

  ~ Second, 16 counties don't even know which of their non-votes
    are undervotes and which are overvotes.

  ~ Third, even in counties that have attempted to separate the
    undervote, there are serious problems. In Miami-Dade, the
    number of undervotes submitted to the Circuit Court is
    different from the number identified in the November 8
    machine recount. There can be no confidence that the pool of
    undervotes is untainted and consistent.

  ~ Fourth, the majority accepted two different standards (the
    liberal Broward standard and the more objective Palm Beach
    standard) further proving votes are treated differently in
    each county.

  ~ Fifth, as Chief Justice Wells said, the liberal court
    majority failed "to make provision for: (1) the
    qualifications of those who count; (2) what standards are
    used in the count-are they the same standards for all
    ballots statewide or a continuation of the county-by-
    county constitutionally suspect standards; (3) who is to
    observe the count; (4) how one objects to the count; (5)
    who is entitled to object to the count; (6) whether a
    person may object to a counter; (7) the possible lack of
    personnel to conduct the count; (8) the fatigue of the
    counters; and (9) the effect of the differing intra-county
    standards.

DISSENT OF CHIEF JUSTICE CHARLES J. WELLS

"I...believe that the majority's decision cannot withstand
scrutiny which will certainly immediately follow under the United
States Constitution."

Excerpt:

"I want to make it clear at the outset of my separate opinion that
I do not question the good faith or honorable intentions of my
colleagues in the majority.  However, I could not more strongly
disagree with their decision to reverse the trial court and
prolong this judicial process.  I also believe that the majority's
decision cannot withstand the scrutiny which will certainly
immediately follow under the United States Constitution.

"My succinct conclusion is that the majority's decision...has no
foundation in the law of Florida as it existed on November 7, 2000,
or at anytime until the issuance of this opinion.  The majority
returns the case to the circuit court for this partial recount of
under-votes on the basis of unknown or, at best, ambiguous
standards with authority to obtain help from others, the
credentials, qualifications, and objectivity of whom are totally
unknown.  That is but a first glance at the imponderable problems
that the majority creates.

"This case has reached the point where finality must take
precedence over continued judicial process.  I agree with a quote
from John Allen Paulos, a professor of mathematics at Temple
University, when he wrote that, "[t]he margin of error in this
election is far greater than the margin of victory, no matter who
wins."  Further judicial process will not change this self-evident
fact and will only result in confusion and disorder.  Justice
Terrell and this Court wisely counseled against such a course of
action sixty-four years ago.  I would heed that sound advice and
affirm Judge Sauls.

STATEMENT BY FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE JAMES A. BAKER, III
December 8, 2000

Ladies and Gentlemen,

This has been a rather eventful day here in Tallahassee.  Two
Circuit Court opinions throwing out challenges to absentee ballots
in Seminole and Martin counties.  A federal judge ordering the
counting of overseas absentee ballots in many counties that were
not counted for technical reasons.  And of course, the
disappointing 4 to 3 decision of the Florida Supreme Court just
announced, which will require manually recounting tens of
thousands of non-votes and undervotes in all Florida counties that
have not yet had a manual recount - and trying to do so by
December 12.

This is what happens when for the first time in modern history, a
candidate resorts to lawsuits to try to overturn the outcome of
an election for President.  It is very sad.  For Florida, for the
nation, and for our democracy.

Today's ruling by four justices of the Florida Supreme Court is of
course a disappointment.  Its reasoning and result place the Court
once again at odds with sound judgments of Florida's lower courts,
the Florida Legislature, local election officials, and, in our
view, the US Supreme Court.  This action will unfortunately
produce ongoing uncertainty and could ultimately disenfranchise
Florida's votes in the Electoral College.

The ruling of the Florida Court's four justices is flawed in much
the same way we think as its November 21 ruling that was vacated
unanimously by the United States Supreme Court.

Let me read you what Chief Justice Wells said in part of his
dissent today:
"I...believe that the majority's decision cannot withstand the
scrutiny which will certainly immediately follow under the United
States Constitution...  [T]he majority's decision to return this
case to the circuit court for a count of the under-votes from
either Miami-Dade County or all counties has no foundation in the
law of Florida as it existed on November 7, 2000, or at any time
until the issuance of this opinion...  [T]he prolonging of
judicial process in this counting contest propels this country and
this state into an unprecedented and unnecessary constitutional
crisis.  I have to conclude that there is a real and present
likelihood that this constitutional crisis will do substantial
damage to our country, our state, and to this Court as an
institution." [pp. 41-42]

We agree with the three justices who dissented from the action of
the other four.  We believe this ruling is inconsistent with
Florida law, federal law, and the United States Constitution.
Therefore, we have no alternative other than to appeal once again
to the United States Supreme Court for relief.  We have already
put in motion the process to do so.

_________________________________________________________________

WHAT THEY'RE SAYING...

Judge Andrew Napolitano  [Fox News Legal Analyst]:  "...what is
this doing?  Changing the rules yet again, in the face of a federal
law that says you can't change counting procedures and rules after
six days prior to the election."
-Fox News Channel, 12/08/00


Jim Axelrod [CBS News Correspondent]: "One of the first people I
saw after the Supreme Court ruling was Dexter Douglass, a member of
the Gore legal team.  I asked him what was next.  He said, 'Chaos.'
So far, nothing's been done to help clarify the situation."
-CBS Evening News, 12/08/00


Tim Russert  [NBC News]:  "...we could have chaos and a
constitutional crisis...This is as close to a political civil war
as I've ever witnessed."
-NBC Nightly News, 12/08/00


Mike Isikoff  [Newsweek Magazine]:  "...The Republicans got a bit
of a shot in the arm.  I was just reading the dissent of Chief
Justice Wells on this case, and he is pretty stinging.  It is
surprising language from a chief justice of a state court.  He
pretty much says flatly that his colleagues were wrong as a matter
of law.  They're going to be reversed by--he predicts they will be
reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court, and also projects--talks about
a constitutional crisis that is going to flow from this.  So if
the Republicans need some leg to hang their position on, they've
got it in this dissent..."

John Gibson:  "Mike Isikoff, a crucial question is here.  What
standard is this recount going to be counted under?  Any clue?"

Mike Isikoff:  "No.  That is exactly the question that I think is
going to loom largest over the next few days."

-Fox News Channel, 12/08/00

THE FINAL WORD 
CALIFORNIA IS IN THE MIDST OF AN ENORmous stupidity crisis. Californians have 
been sitting in the dark because ... they didn't turn the lights on.
They say they're short of electricity. Yes, they are. Between 1988 and 1998, 
California's electricity consumption increased by 15 percent. Meanwhile 
California's capacity to generate electricity shrank by five percent, even as 
the state hesitated to build new power lines to tap into neighboring states' 
power supplies. 
Californians didn't want dams across their rivers, derricks on their ocean, 
power lines across their borders, or fossil fuel smoke in their sky. These 
might interfere with all the smart things Californians do, such as 
hang-glide. California was going to rely on "negawatts" - dramatic power 
conservation. (But California regulators put price controls on electricity 
that lowered prices, and even Californians weren't dumb enough to skip a 
bargain.) And California was going to rely on alternative power generation. 
With all the puffery from Silicon Valley dot.com start-ups, wind farms 
wouldn't be a problem. And doesn't Gwyneth Paltrow's star shine bright enough 
to operate a solar panel? But it turns out that alternative power generation 
is an alternative, mostly, to generating power. 
Californians are people who insist on growing their own vegetables, but they 
won't dig up the pretty lawn, won't plant anything for fear of getting dirty, 
and they use fragrant bath salts from The Body Shop instead of smelly 
compost. Let them make their crudites with crab grass. President Bush was 
wrong to grant an extension of executive orders requiring out-of-state 
utilities to supply power to California. And everyone is wrong to listen to 
Californians whine about electricity deregulation. 
There never was any deregulation. The California Public Utilities Commission 
merely changed its regulations, which apparently weren't stupid enough to 
meet Golden State standards. Under California's 1996 re-regulation plan, 
electric companies sold their generating plants and became distributors. They 
were required to buy their power on the wholesale spot market and forbidden 
to enter into any long-term power supply contracts. Retail electricity prices 
were lowered by 10 percent and frozen at the new rate until March 2002. 
This is like requiring A&P to sell you porterhouse at $2 a pound, no matter 
what the price of beef on the hoof. Imagine how many steaks there would be, 
and how many supermarkets. Go to one of those boarded-up grocery stores, 
purchase a phantom T-bone, screw it into a ceiling fixture, and try to light 
your house. You're in California. 
Californians devised a system of electricity sales that ignored every 
dimension of the free market. (Interesting that the "Information Economy" is 
centered in a place that's immune to information.) The free market is a 
yardstick, and Californians got smacked with it. Mideast oil jitters, cold 
weather, natural gas price spikes, and the plain unpredictable freedom of the 
free market caused wholesale electricity costs to rise and California 
utilities to go $12 billion into the red. 
California's governor Gray Davis responded with the full force of bikini 
beach brain. In a January 8 speech to the state legislature, Davis proposed 
creating a state agency to buy generating plants and build new ones. He 
threatened to expropriate power generators and transmission grids. He called 
for laws to allow criminal prosecution of wholesale suppliers who withheld 
electricity from California markets. And he said the state's universities and 
community colleges would build co-generating plants and become energy 
independent. (With gas produced by the cafeteria food?) Gray Davis sounded 
like Joseph Stalin with the IQ of Keanu Reeves. "Everyone should understand 
that there are other, more drastic measures that I am prepared to take if I 
have to," Davis declaimed. 
"Take" is the key word. Grabby Californians tried to regulate themselves into 
some cheap electricity. Hoggish California power companies went along because 
the stateimposed retail price ceiling was also a retail price floor. 
According to the Los Angeles Times, during the first 28 months of the scheme, 
Pacific Gas and Electric and California Edison made $20 billion from the 
legally required mark-up between wholesale and retail electric prices. 
Californians want to snatch that money back. "Consumer advocates around 
California... said it did not matter that the utilities were returning 
investments to their shareholders," reported the January 31 Washington Post. 
"They took the money and ran," said state senator John Burton. As opposed to 
Californians, who took the electricity and roller-bladed? Now the juice and 
the jack are both gone, and the California legislature has had to pass a bill 
authorizing $10 billion to try to clean up the mess. 
But the Californians could still pull a scam. The bill mandates long-term 
power contracts at rates that are way above what future prices should be. The 
hope, one guesses, is that Congress, or the President, or somebody will let 
the state skip out on those contracts once the costs are lower. 
It would be wrong to call Californians stupid. They're sleazy, too.

The following is a status update regarding the agreed upon decision to 
allocate Drift to the Business Units on April 26, 2001:

 A methodology and systems reporting have been developed and an analysis 
prepared for the period Jan 2001 - April 2001.  During May, discussions were 
held with each of the business units regarding the methodolgy which applies 
to all business units and the analysis of results for Jan- April.  

A request was made to begin the Drift Allocation process from April 2001.  

During this week, we are meeting with the business units to review April and 
May numbers and processes.  We are expecting to allocate April and May to the 
individual business unit's Drift lines next week.   

June numbers will be accumulated on the DPR in an Intra-Month Allocated Drift 
line and allocated on the last business day's DPR to the Business Unit.

 Please do not hesitate to call me, 3-3210,  or the representatives of your 
business unit,  if you require additional information.

Sheila

Three headed monster, (Dave, Ken and Greg)

For the next 30-45 days, I will be dealing with many integration, logistical 
and new strategy issues.  During that time, I will provide you with a weekly 
update email as to our activities.  Once I have our new strategy mostly 
baked, I will schedule a meeting to get your collective views and feedback.  
I expect that will be at the end of July.  After that, I hope to have regular 
monthly meetings with you

Meanwhile, here is what is happening:

? Personnel - Top priority was to immediately address personnel issues.  My 
target is to reduce the 54 people associated with this effort to an ideal 
structure of 28.  I concluded a week long interview and review process to 
select VP's/Directors/Managers.  The result was the following: 
 New Group
 MD -  Gene Humphrey will remain during a transition period (3 months) and 
will then retire (this was consistent with his own goals).
 VP -  Patrick Hickey (EBS)
   Barbara Paige (EIP)
   Dick Lydecker (Special Assets - his entire group (10) remains in tact)
   Jempy Neyman (Special Assets)
   Andrew Marsden (EBS - London)
 Director  Steven Sheldon (EBS)
   Kevin Kuykendall (EWS)
   John Godbold (EIP)
   John Enerson (Special Assets)
 Manager Kyle Kettler (EWS)
   Michel Nezi Marvin (EBS)
   Mark Gandy (EBS)
   Patrick Johnson (Special Assets)
   Mark Meier (Special Assets)

 Redeployed
 VP -   Jon Thomsen (EBS)
   Michael Miller (EWS)
 Director  Charlie Vetters (EWS)
 Manager Mic Johns (EIP - Washington D.C.)
   Jennifer Adams (EWS)
   Christain Hackett (EBS - London)
   Andreas Kraemer (EWS)
   Fabricio Soares (EIP)

 Next we are evaluating the Analyst/Associates/Admins.  This will be 
completed by June 19.  This will be decreased from 28 people to 15 people.

? Integration - A detailed integration plan is underway (more in the coming 
weeks).  This will begin with a full day offsite on June 20th.  You are 
welcome to attend.

? New Strategy - We are working towards a new strategy and charter.

? Funding sources - Patrick Hickey is working with Shirley Hudler, Michael 
Kopper and others to restructure part of JEDI II, in order to optomize that 
vehicle for our investment needs.  This will hopefully take shape in the next 
30 days.

Gentlemen:
I good friend at Sun suggested me to contact  all of you at Enron  in
regard to the direction of my current searching campaign as  I have made
the decision to leave my post as Vice President and General Manager of
Network Associates Latin America and Caribbean. It is of my understanding
that Enron is undergoing a huge  internal transformation to become one of
the leading E-Commerce players worldwide.

Network Associates is the leading and independent provider   of total
security software solutions to monitor and protect telecommunications,
E-Commerce and internet applications worldwide. Since I was given the
mission to start  the region in 1996 I have been instrumental to
increase sales from 2M to 35M US in 4 years. I have been in charge of
supervising and managing over 100 employees across the region and the US
with complete P&L responsibilities.

Previous to join NAI, I worked  for Seagate where I had the
responsibilitity to set up the whole  supply chain in South Florida and
and across the region resulting in a sales increase from 25M to 125M US
in 4 years. With over 20 years of experience selling and transfering
technology internationally I feel proud of my record and accomplishments.


Should any of you be interested in talking to me about any opportunity
within any of your organizations, please do not hesitate to call me at
954-452-0664. Thank you in advance for your positive consideration. Best
regards, Herbert Arturo Molina

Acta Announces Partnership With i2; i2 Customers Can Now Choose Acta's 
Rapid-to-Implement Data Integration Products to Collaborate Intelligently 
Across the Supply Chain

MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 11, 2000--Acta Technology, Inc., 
the leader in business-to-business (B2B) data integration, today announced a 
technology partnership with i2 Technologies, Inc. (Nasdaq:ITWO), the leading 
provider of marketplace solutions. 
The partnership enables i2's TradeMatrix(TM) customers to choose Acta's data 
platform, which is designed to package and speed the delivery of the 
back-office data essential for selling, buying and collaborating online. Acta 
will develop a number of data cache solutions (Acta eCaches(TM)) to provide 
rapidly deployable, pre-packaged data content and connectivity to the 
back-office systems that fuel TradeMatrix applications. 
i2's TradeMatrix allows businesses to create both private and public 
marketplaces, while improving the efficiencies of all participants with 
content and solutions to support decision optimization for key functions 
including design, buy, plan, sell, fulfill and service. The Acta eCaches for 
TradeMatrix will enable businesses to share key back-office data with their 
customers and trading partners and provide rapid-to-implement solutions for 
integrating key B2B data from operational systems across the entire extended 
enterprise. 
Industry leaders and analysts have recognized the need for packaged solutions 
for B2B data integration -- the linchpin in a rapidly growing number of B2B 
initiatives. 
"B2B data integration is rapidly emerging as a 'must-have' technology for all 
companies who do business online. As a leader in B2B data integration and 
caching, Acta enables i2's TradeMatrix customers to grant rapid access to 
detailed and accurate data from enterprise systems," said Acta CEO Carol 
Mills Baldwin. "Now TradeMatrix customers will be able to combine i2's 
industry leading technology with the most rapid data integration solution, 
essential for conducting business collaboration online." 
The Acta/i2 partnership provides further validation that B2B data caching is 
emerging as an important new category in B2B integration. Unlike other B2B 
integration solutions -- such as application integration and process 
integration -- Acta focuses on data integration as an essential component for 
allowing companies to do business online, either through direct commerce 
sites or in marketplaces. The Acta platform consists of ActaWorks 
RealTime(TM), an award-winning data movement-and-management server, and 
eCaches(TM), a suite of packaged data caches that speed the delivery of 
back-office data in specific subject areas of eCommerce and business 
intelligence.

o Priceline Nixes Plan for Japan Service With Softbank

NORWALK, Conn. -- Priceline.com and Softbank E-Commerce
said they have discontinued discussions to introduce
a priceline.com service in Japan. The two companies
entered into a non-binding letter of intent in July
and a formation agreement in September to form the
new company, but said they could not reach definitive
agreements. The move came as priceline.com, a publicly

off 48 employees, 11% of its staff, and trimmed
several business offerings under development in
a bid for profitability.

o Softbank Confirms Accelerator eVentures Halts Operations

NEW YORK -- Softbank, an Internet and technology
investor, said its U.K.-based eVentures Fund, set
up as a joint venture with ePartners, the venture
capital arm of News Corp., in mid-1999 to help U.S.
technology firms launch in Western Europe, has put
on hold all investments plans due to current market
conditions. A company spokeswoman said until market
conditions change, Softbank will refocus its resources
on making direct early stage investments through
Softbank UK Ventures and Softbank European Ventures.
eVentures is not the only Softbank-affiliated fund
that has been frozen. @Viso, a $344.5 million-joint
venture fund between Softbank and Vivendi, a global
utilities and communications company, has also halted
its investments plans.

In the same Decision that the CPUC is considering voting out on suspending 
Direct Access, the CPUC is considering a SoCal Edison recommendation to 
suspend further payment of the Negative CTC to marketers.

The Decision would find that the earlier Stipulation does not require SCE to 
make a cash payment in lieu of a bill credit (even though SCE has already 
paid cash in previous periods for the Negative CTC).
The Decision orders SCE to not make cash payments to satisfy the Negative CTC 
credit.
The Decision is unclear as to whether or not this is simply a suspension of 
payment or would be permanent.
The Decision would apply the same findings and rulings to PG&E and SDG&E.

The key issue is that rather than having a cash receivable, EES would now 
have a bill credit receivable.  In addition, because EES re-sourced its 
customers, the Utility account that holds the bill credit is EES, not the 
customer account.  The only method to obtain the economic value of the bill 
credit is to utilize the Utilities' services.  Even if EES physically serves 
the customers going forward, it may not be the same account that has the bill 
credit.  

The outcome of this case would impact our current Complaint, but it is 
unclear exactly how the CPUC would apply this Decision to that case.

We are intending to (a) try to remove this issue from the CPUC Decision, (b) 
trying to clarify the suspension is not meant as a vehicle to deny us 
payment, and (c) trying to determine that the Utilities' tariff would allow 
us to be paid if our account became "inactive".

One other option to consider (at least for SCE) would be to contact SCE 
management to work out a bill credit application process to allow EES to 
route the economic value to our DA customers.  

If anyone has any questions, please call me to discuss.

Jim

In providing an answer to our questions regarding risk assessment or 
management, would you please provide an explanation to the following?  We 
understand that EOL requires that a counter party, before accessing EOL to do 
business with Enron North America, must undergo a credit worthiness 
evaluation.   When a counter party executes or clicks on a price, EOL does an 
instant credit check before confirming the transaction.

However, Enron may not only buy from a counter party, it may sell.  What sort 
of creditworthiness standards must Enron provide to a counter party utilizing 
EOL to purchase from Enron?

Are there industry standard creditworthiness agreements regarding counter 
party credit risk that Enron uses?  If yes, may we have copies?  If Enron 
utilizes its own agreements, please provide us with a copy.

Thank you.

Subject: Dabhol -- A Brief Legal Update

Gentlemen -

A few updates:

The power station and LNG contractors terminated their respective 
construction contracts over the weekend.

Rebecca McDonald and Ken Lay met with the India Minister of Finance on 
Saturday in New York.  The Minister reiterated India's position that they 
would not buy any power from Dabhol.

We had a conference call with management of GE and Bechtel last week.  There 
is little evident disagreement amongst the sponsors on key issues.  Bechtel 
even complimented Rebecca on her team and handling of the matter.  Walter 
Stuart from V&E came over to listen in on the phone call on behalf of Enron.  
Given the increasing cooperation of the sponsors and written statements of GE 
and Bechtel approving Enron's handling of ongoing issues, we have kept V&E's 
involvement fairly "low key" to date.

Jeff and Greg,

Operationally, we are doing great, with tremendous press coverage (USA
Today, CNN, Newsweek, Boston Globe, etc...), growing traffic, and lots of
praise for our site and concept.  On the business development front, we are
now talking seriously with eBay about a distribution arrangement and with
Northwest about expanding to their full route system.

Meanwhile, we are running out of cash.  The money we've got in the bank will
last through early August (assuming an orderly shut-down).  In order to keep
our business development efforts alive, we're trying to raise $500k at a low
valuation in the next 30 days.  Would you be willing to consider a portion
of this amount as a personal investment?

Attached is an up-to-date overview of where we stand.

Best,
Frank Levy

In this Violation memo, you are taking out positive P&L associated to a nat

Attached is a short memo and summary outlining changes to the Business School 
Loan Program for the Western Hemisphere. As many of you know, over the past 
couple of months we have taken a hard look at our approach to business school 
loans. The updated guidelines better serve Enron's business interests, 
eliminate credit exposure for the company, and potentially broaden the reach 
of the Loan Program. If you have any questions, please contact Ted Bland 
(x35275) who leads Career Development for the Program.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
? SoCal. Ed MOU Introduced as Bill
? House Committee Douses Emergency Energy Relief Act

MOU Has Its Day
Sources report that California Senator Polanco has introduced the legislation 
today for the MOU between the Governor and SoCal Edison (SB 78XX).  As 
reported earlier, sources still believe that there is not sufficient 
legislative support for this measure to pass.  Senator Polanco's political 
career was earlier jeopardized by personal scandal and now sources feel his 
MOU sponsorship may be nothing more than a quid pro quo attempt to gain 
support from Davis.  Additionally, the CPUC has added two necessary MOU 
provisions to its next week voting agenda, though support for these issues 
remains weak on the CPUC board.   

House Energy Relief Efforts
The House Energy and Commerce Committee gave up plans to ease California's 
energy woes because Republicans and Democrats could not settle a long 
standing debate over price caps in the West.  Representative Waxman admitted 
a compromise was never more than a noble idea throughout the debates, and 
several delayed mark-up sessions for the bill.  Barton noted the bill had 
little chance of aid California considering the time it would take to pass 
the bill would be longer than the California summer.

Greg and John,

I found that by reducing the volume per trade and increasing daily number of 
trades ( keeping the 
total volume per day constant), we can be more profitable.  This is partially 
because in a trending market
we lose less money by following the market more closely. For example, suppose 
market move from
$30 to $35. If per trade volume is 10,000 BBL, we take 6 trades of short 
positions, the total MTM for that
day is (-5-4-3-2-1)*10,000=-$90,000 and total trading volume is 60,000 BBL.
 If per trade volume is 60,000 BBL, we take one trade, the total MTM is 
-5*60,000= -$300,000.

Therefore it seems that by reducing per trade volume and increasing the 
number of trades, we can be more
profitable as a market maker.  

I rerun a scenario that Stinson sent to you on Dec. 27 where he used per 
trade volume of 30,000 BBL.
I reduce the number of trade to 10,000 while increasing the number of trades 
by 3.  Almost in all
cases, I saw increased profitability.  See the colume marked "Change" for 
dollar amount change.

Please let Stinson or me know your thoughts on this.

Regards,

Zimin Lu

Hi John,

I assume you spoke with Nigel following your voicemail on Friday and he has 
brought you up to date.

We are doing everything we can to make fix this problem, and we are trying to 
ensure everyone is in the loop.

The problem looks to be a software bug somewhere in the Cisco operating 
environment. This has been escalated to Cicso's highest priority and we have 
had up to 6 Cisco engineers working on the problem. We have also flown in one 
on the Houston Netwrok team to assist. The problem we have is that the two 
core 6500 routers, which are at the hub of the network will run along 
perfectly at about 7% utilization, then, for an as yet undetermined reason 
they suddenly jump to 99% and start thrashing, dropping network connectivity. 

The catch 22 we have is that when the system goes down, the Cicso guys need 
time to capture diagnostic information, but of course we just need to get it 
up again straight away.

The team have systematically gone though each hardware component and each 
software component to ensure all are working, all are at the latest cisco 
recomended release level and all are required. Those not needed are removed 
to ensure the 'simplest' environment possible.

The bottom line is that we still haven't solved the problem, but are doing 
everything in our power to resolve it ASAP.

Regards
MRP

fyi, we have been working on a network redesign since before these problems 
start which will distribute the network across more Core routers, (in effect 
seperate networks). This design is the same as that proposed for the new 
Houston building. Whatever design is in place, however, we can never rule out 
a problem due to faulty software such as this.

They do look tight.  But after a $2 drop, you'd have to expect it to pinch.  
Seems like, unless things really fall out of bed, this spread should widen 
from here.  Even if the front stays relatively unchanged.

Bankruptcy in California; Implications for our Growth Energy Names

* We would not sell Energy Merchants/Power Producers on news that PCG
has declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
* Ongoing payments in California are being made by the state;
therefore do not anticipate material exposure for ongoing earnings.
* Primary exposure is current receivables: (1) these one-time amounts
are limited (roughly estimate max. of 50% of 2001 earnings); and (2) we
expect that, as trade creditors, they will get high priority in a bankruptcy
proceeding. We think most of these amounts are likely to be recoverable,
although a significant (perhaps several year) delay is possible as these
claimants work their way through the bankruptcy process.
* By our rough estimation, companies with fairly significant one-time
earnings exposure include:  NRG, MIR, DYN, CPN.  Companies with fairly small
exposure include:  ENE, AES, WMB, EPG and DUK.

common sense recommendations that we should all adhere to when traveling fo=
r=20
business.  Any regular deviations from these travel policy recommendations=
=20
will be reviewed by each business unit leader.

? Air travel =01) Employees are requested to use either Travel Agency in th=

=20
non-refundable coach tickets, which are typically 65 percent less than=20
refundable tickets and can usually be changed by simply paying a $100 fee. =
=20
For this reason, we strongly encourage all employees to purchase=20
non-refundable domestic coach tickets when possible.

? Lodging =01) GSS has also negotiated preferred rates at a number of hotel=
=20
chains in many cities worldwide to accommodate each business unit=01,s=20
individual hotel policy.  We recommend that you use Enron=01,s list of pref=
erred=20
hotels to select accommodations that are in line with your business unit=01=
,s=20
policies.  You can view the list at http://travel.enron.com.

? Car rental services =01) When renting a car for business travel, employee=
s=20
should use our preferred car rental agencies =01) National (U.S. and Canada=
) and=20
Alamo (U.S.)- since the agreements we have negotiated are intended to prote=
ct=20
you and Enron through the insurance coverage in our contract.  Visit=20

de=20
the U.S.

? Off-site meetings =01) All domestic-U.S. off-site meetings and events wit=

more than 10 people should be coordinated through GSS, which will negotiate=

preferred rates for Enron.  They can be reached at (713) 646-8311.

Because there are differences between business units and offices, each=20
business unit leader will follow up this memo with a communication further=

elaborating on these policies as they apply to their business unit.

Each of us has a responsibility to make sure we do our part to ensure Enron=

Friends...

Chris Bartlett at Harvard presented (last week) the 2 most recent Enron cases 
he wrote to the "Harvard Program for Global Leadership".  This is an Exec Ed 
program for CXO's and Senior management from throughout the world. Chris 
called me today to say that the cases received outstanding reviews, and that 
the largely international CXO audience was both knowledgeable about, and very 
'pro-Enron'!

Best!

--Christie.

Every year, a holiday gift is sent from the Executive Committee and is 
normally a donation to a charity of Enron's choice.  This year, we have tried 
a different approach. Elyse Kalmans and Kathy Mayfield from Community 
Relations recommended an on-line service called Chairtygift.com.  Each 
recipient can select the charity of their choice from many hundreds in the 
United States.  Should they choose to not go on-line and select a charity, 
the amount of that person's gift will default to DePelchin.  Kathy is 
receiving thank you notes by e-mail so I wanted to share with you.

Subject: Thank you for the Charitygift

I have received two other thank you notes for the Charitygifts.  Upon 
redemption, there is a place for recipients to send a thank you via email and 
currently I am set up as the person to receive them.  Is that ok?  I don't 
mind and can forward them to you as I get them or save them and get them to 
you all at once.  It's great feedback and I think Ken would enjoy seeing 
their responses.  It seems as though people are enjoying getting them and 
being able to choose one of their favorite charities.  Let me know what you 
think.  I am also drafting a letter to go to DePelchin letting them know that 
we are doing this.  Would you like for it to come from Ken?  Thanks, Kathy

Kathy,
Eileen and I were most pleased to have the opportunity to donate to Southern

Our outside Regulatory Counsel has heard that the CPUC will definitely vote 
to suspend direct access on June 28 effective July 1.  We will be working 
through formal comments and informal discussions to clarify the meaning of 
the this suspension.

We are still working to try and modify the Proposed Decisions as they relate 
to the PX Credit receivable, with our primary focus on removing this part of 
the decision from a vote on June 28.

Mike Day just called to say he has heard the California PUC definitely will 
vote on June 28 to suspend direct access, effective July 1, except for 
written contracts executed prior to July 1, 2001.    Suspension of DA has 
been identified by the Governor as a necessary prerequisite to bond 
issuance.

DAILY BRIEFING [http://www.businessweek.com/today.htm]

12/19 -- Special Report -- After the Meltdown: Crawling from the Dot-Com 
Wreckage
Yes, the carnage will get worse. But survivors -- and a healthier overall 
climate -- will ultimately emerge. Here's what's next

12/20 -- The Fed Has No Time to Dawdle
It should have cut rates on Dec. 19. Every month Greenspan waits before 
acting makes it that much harder to avoid a downturn
http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/dec2000/nf20001220_822.htm

12/20-- Greenspan & Co. Could Pull the Trigger Before Long
Though the Fed declined to cut interest rates now, it may not even wait till 
the next policy meeting to act -- if the stock market keeps falling
http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/dec2000/nf20001220_617.htm

12/18 -- Greenspan's Ace in the Hole: Productivity
He still thinks its strong growth will avert a recession. But if the slowing 
continues, watch for quick rate-cut action

keep it from the winner's circle

As you are aware, Enron utilizes temporary staffing services to satisfy=20
staffing requirements throughout the company.  For the past several months,=
 a=20
project team, representing Enron=01,s temporary staffing users, have resear=
ched=20
and evaluated alternative Managed Services programs to determine which sour=
ce=20
would best meet our current and future needs in terms of quality, performan=
ce=20
and cost containment objectives.  The Business Unit Implementation Project=
=20
Team members are:=20

Laurie Koenig, Operations Management, EES
Carolyn Vigne, Administration, EE&CC
Linda Martin, Accounting & Accounts Payable, Corporate
Beverly Stephens, Administration, ENA
Norma Hasenjager, Human Resources, ET&S
Peggy McCurley, Administration, Networks
Jane Ellen Weaver, Enron Broadband Services

George Weber, GSS

In addition, Eric Merten (EBS), Kathy Cook (EE&CC), Carolyn Gilley (ENA),=
=20
Larry Dallman (Corp/AP), and Diane Eckels (GSS) were active members of the=
=20
Selection Project Team.

As a result of the team=01,s efforts, we are pleased to announce the beginn=
ing=20
of a strategic alliance with CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services Group.  This g=
roup=20
will function as a vendor-neutral management entity overseeing all staffing=
=20
vendors in the program scope. They will also provide a web based online=20
technology tool that will enhance the ordering and reporting capabilities. =
=20
The goal of our alliance with CORESTAFF is to make obtaining a temporary=20
worker with the right skills and experience easier while protecting the bes=
t=20
interests of the organization.=20

We plan to implement Phase I of this improvement effective January 2, 2001.=
 =20
This Phase I of the implementation will encompass administrative/clerical=
=20
temporary workers at the Houston locations only. If you currently have=20
administrative/clerical temporary workers in your department, the enhanceme=
nt=20
will not affect their position. In an effort to preserve relationships, all=
=20
current staffing vendors will be invited to participate in this enhanced=20
program.  CORESTAFF shares our commitment to minimize any disruptions in=20
service during this transition.=20
=20
We expect to incorporate the administrative/clerical workers in Omaha,=20
Seattle and Portland in Phase II, which is scheduled for February, 2001.  T=
he=20
scope and timing of any additional phases will be determined after these tw=
o=20
phases have been completed.

Realizing the impact that the temporary workforce has in business today, we=
=20
selected CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services Group based on their exceptional=
=20
management team, commitment to quality service, and creative solutions to o=
ur=20
staffing needs.  The relationship promises to offer Enron a cost effective=
=20
and simple means for obtaining temporary employees.

In the coming weeks, Enron and CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services Group will b=
e=20
communicating to Enron=01,s administrative/clerical temporary staffing vend=
ors=20
about the new process. =20

There are many benefits to this new Managed Services program, which are=20
outlined on the attached page.  More details on how to utilize CORESTAFF=01=
,s=20
Managed Services program will be announced soon and meetings will be=20
scheduled to demonstrate the reporting system and to meet the Managed=20
Services team.

What is Managed Services?

CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services program includes:

? Vendor-neutral management model
? Equal distribution of staffing orders to all staffing partners
? Web-based application with online ordering, data capture and customized=

Summary:

* Britain's Crown Estate (hereditary possessions of the Royal family)
has granted seventeen UK companies the option to build wind power generation
projects with a potential value of U$2.3 billion on their land.  Wind
turbine sites have been approved for several regions ranging from Scotland
to the south coast of England, however government and regulatory approval
remains necessary for the projects to go ahead.
* BP, together with the government of Spain and the Phillipines, plan
to build a $48 million solar power plant that will deliver electricity to
over 150 villages (400,000 residents) that are isolated in the Phillipines.
The system will be installed in two separate installments, the first of
which is planned for September.

Ca energy issues are out of control. Consumer groups are screaming about 
gouging. I will email today's articles from the Chronicle. The market has 
gone down more today with MSFT info after hours. Will keep being choppy. Glad 
no further rearrangements at ENE. You mentioned Bonds the other day, do you  
want some tax free muni ideas. If so how far out would you be comfortable 
with? I will talk to my Dallas muni desk for suggestions. How big was that 
check I was watching for? Ben

I'm not still short QQQ.  I covered at 68 1/2 in the after market while we
were on the phone, after the Florida supreme court statement.

The world has gone truly crazy about CA energy prices.

Not expecting any job changes due to the Skilling/Lay thing.  But a lot of
people are giving me shit anyway.  The recent reorganization that gave me
my current job was done so that Skilling wouldn't have to put anyone in the
COO position.

Greg, 

You and I met at your office last summer to discuss Aprimo's Marketing 
Management Solution. At the time, you indicated that there would be other 
people at Enron that I should speak with. My assigned territory changed 
shortly after our meeting, and I did not follow-up on these contacts. I am 
once again responsible for Enron, and would appreciate your direction to the 
appropriate individuals at Enron.

Our web-based solution has been adopted by over 60 leading companies over the 
past 18 months. They are seeing rapid value from Aprimo's unique ability to 
help them Grow Top-Line Revenue (more effective Marketing) and Reduce 
Bottom-line Cost (more efficient Marketing). With the opportunities facing 
Enron, I'm certain that maximizing your Marketing Investments is of interest 
to the Executive Team and your Shareholders.

Our solution is delivering improvements across all Marketing Functions, such 
as: 

- Event Management 
- Marcom 
- Marketing Financial Management 
- Strategic Planning 
- Direct Marketing 
- Web Response 
- Lead Management 

Leading Analysts have identified Aprimo as the clear leader in Enterprise 
Marketing Management. I would like to arrange brief discovery meetings with 
some of the individuals responsible for Marketing's contribution to Enron's 
growth.

I would appreciate any direction that you and Liz can provide. 

Regards, 
Vince LaGrange

In this Violation memo, you are taking out positive P&L associated to a nat 
gas posion in the LPG books which is a true hedge versus some long dated 
propane positions.  When you add back the hedge P&L I believe there is no 
violation.

Power Board's Industry Ties May Be Cut/Federal regulators consider making 
deregulation's creation independent
Susan Sward, David Lazarus


   As power prices skyrocket and California reels from the threat of
blackouts, the agency charged with overseeing the state's power grid has
come under increasing attack, and federal regulators are poised to order
sweeping changes in its governing board.
   Ever since the Legislature created the California Independent System
Operator four years ago, critics have lambasted the agency, saying it is
dominated by the power industry and does not have ratepayers' interests at
heart.
   Criticism of the ISO has grown as electricity reserves have dwindled and
as the agency has initiated statewide energy alerts that have required
hundreds of businesses to cut back their operations.
   "There are people on the ISO governing board who have a direct financial
interest in the policies they set," said Severin Borenstein, a professor
of business administration and public policy at the University of
California at Berkeley and the director of the University of California
Energy Institute.
   Today, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is expected to issue a
ruling that would remake the ISO's 26-member board, which includes
representatives of three investor-owned utilities, four municipal
utilities and two power generators.
   From its high-tech headquarters in Folsom -- reminiscent of NASA's mission
control center -- the nonprofit ISO essentially acts as traffic cop for a
power system that serves three-quarters of the state.
   Responsible for assuring a stable source of electricity, the ISO has the
authority to initiate emergency alerts and, if need be, rolling blackouts
if supplies drop to near nothing. By law, the utilities and power
generators must comply with ISO directives.
   Last month, federal regulators proposed an order calling for the ISO board
to be replaced by seven independent members. The new board would be
selected by the current ISO before it was replaced.
   Striving to restore order to the state's turbulent electricity market, the
commission said an overhaul of the ISO's management would be an important
first step toward easing the burden on consumers. CREATURE OF DEREGULATION
   The ISO was created as part of the Legislature's deregulation of the
state's electricity market in 1996. The Legislature set up the ISO as a
"stakeholder board" with designated seats for participants in the energy
marketplace.
   The theory was that those involved in the industry would be best able to
guarantee reliable electricity for the Bay Area and the other ISO-served
areas in California.
   "It was designed to be as neutral as possible," said Michael Shames,
executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego.
"If anything, it's turned out to be far too cozy with power generators."
   State Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina Del Rey, said lawmakers were told that
the deregulation blueprint they adopted in 1996 was a better alternative
than more sweeping proposals being considered by the state Public
Utilities Commission.
   Lawmakers were reassured at the time that the deregulation plan, which was
intended to lower power prices by increasing competition, had the full
backing of utilities, including Pacific Gas and Electric Co., power
generators and large users of electricity.
   "You have to remember that the political climate was different then," said
Bowen, the author of a pending measure replacing the existing ISO board
with one appointed by the governor and independent of the industry.
   "We had a Republican Assembly and a Republican governor (Pete Wilson) with
(his) appointees on the PUC with a free market point of view," Bowen said.
"The bargaining position of the ratepayers and consumer groups was not
strong." PRIVATE COMPANIES' LEVERAGE
   Doug Heller, assistant director of the Foundation for Consumer and
Taxpayer Rights, said the Legislature set up the ISO the way it did
because "it and the regulators were so transfixed with the idea of the
free market that they ignored the tremendous leverage they were handing
over to the private energy companies."
   He added, "Because the ISO has a mandate to keep the lights on and procure
power when the utilities are short, this energy industry-dominated board
has used its mandate as justification for gouging consumers."
   If the prices currently being paid for electricity are sustained over
time, Heller said ratepayers would have an average monthly bill of $620
and a small business paying a $1,000 monthly electricity tab could see its
bill jump to $10,000 based on current energy market prices.
   Federal regulators almost certainly will not let this happen. They are
expected to announce measures today intended to keep wholesale prices
stable and thus protect users from sharp increases in their power bills.
   The ISO is currently chaired by Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of
the Independent Energy Producers Association, a trade association whose
members generate about 24,000 megawatts of power in California.
   The board's members include representatives from two power generators,
Dynegy Inc. and an affiliate of Florida Power and Light; the state's three
investor-owned utilities, PG&E, Southern California Edison and San Diego
Gas and Electric; and four municipal utilities serving Los Angeles,
Sacramento, Silicon Valley and several Southern California communities.
   UC's Borenstein said the ISO board should be constituted along the lines
of New England's power agency where "you go out and find independent
experts in power, finance and economics. New England has had its ups and
downs, but I think there is a trust the New England board is acting in the
best interests of consumers." POWER PRICING GATEKEEPER
   Mike Florio, an attorney for The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco
and a member of the ISO board, said that although the composition of the
ISO board is only one element of the California energy crisis, the ISO "is
at the crux of the matter because it establishes and administers the state
market rules that determine how pricing gets done.
   "The ISO has been a law to itself -- with its attitude being: 'We keep the
lights on, we know what's going on and others should butt out,' " he said.
   If federal regulators order an overhaul of the ISO today, "that may just
be the beginning of the battle," Florio said. "If the changes they order
don't offer customers relief from the extremely high prices, TURN and
others will call for the state to buy the transmission system from the
utilities as a means of wrestling back control from FERC."
   For his part, the consumer network's Shames is proposing a merger of the
ISO and the California Power Exchange, which coordinates the wholesale
market, thereby creating a "superagency" with full powers of oversight and
enforcement.
   Yesterday, the idea of making the ISO board independent picked up some
utility support as well. PG&E, which serves millions of customers in
Northern and Central California, issued a statement that "to restore
public confidence, we agree with state and federal officials that the ISO
board needs to be independent."
   In any case, the ISO is not without its defenders. Barbara Barkovich, an
ISO board member who is a San Rafael consultant to large industrial
customers, said some of the criticism of the ISO has been unfair.
   "There are larger market forces at work here: Clearly, we have a tight
supply situation compared to demand -- which means there will always be
upward pressure on prices," Barkovich said. "We have had a situation where
prices out of state have recently been very high, meaning when anyone is
selling, they will go where prices are the highest." POWERFULLY NOBLE
CAUSE
   For its part, she said, the ISO "has seen its role as doing everything it
could to keep the lights on rather than have blackouts."
   Others say the ISO simply does not have sufficient enforcement powers to
make its orders stick in a volatile energy market.
   "The ISO is a flawed institution, but it is not responsible for the
shortages," said Shames of the Utility Consumers' Action Network.
   Such assertions do not halt the drive to reform the ISO's makeup.
   Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Monterey, is the author of one of several bills
now pending in the Legislature that would give Gov. Gray Davis authority
to appoint both a new ISO and a revamped Power Exchange.
   But he cautioned that if an ISO restructuring is all that happens, "We
might as well do nothing. It is only one element of the solution." MORE
REFORMS NEEDED
   Keeley said that for California to work through its energy crisis, several
major reforms must be put in place, including energy conservation moves,
as the state's population climbs by as much as 600,000 a year.
   One area crying out for attention, Keeley said, "is the demand side of the
market. When California found itself in an energy crisis in the 1970s, it
took good action on solar, renewable sources of energy, pricing and tax
actions in the law and do on."
   But he said that many of those changes have been tossed out or whittled
away in the intervening decades.
   The Legislature also needs to look at the possibility of "the public
having some generation assets under its control -- for example, the
hydroelectric assets PG&E now has up for sale," Keeley said.
   "PG&E's assets on Northern California rivers is the largest group of
hydroelectric assets under one ownership in the state," he said. "Public
ownership of these hydroelectric assets is preferable to private ownership
because those assets in public ownership would mean lower rates for
consumers."
   Whatever course the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and state
lawmakers take, the stakes are undeniably high.
   "If this conflict is allowed to continue," Bowen wrote FERC Chairman James
Hoecker last month, ". . . then we have failed our duty to Californians."

Late last night, BKH requested ENA to guaranty the indemnification 
obligations of TLS Investors, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ECT and the Member 
Manager of Southwest Power LLC.  The guaranty will be capped at the adjusted 
purchase price, presently expected to be in the range of $205 million to $220 
million, and will remain in place for 18 months from the Closing Date.

RAC's view is that exposure under such a guaranty would not be materially 
different from exposure under a direct indemnity provided by ENA if ENA were 
the actual legal entity selling Southwest Power LLC.  RAC supports the 
issuance of such guaranty to facilitate completion of the divestiture.

Summary of Energy Technology Bulletin:

* The three-pack of Capstone microturbines capable of generating 90kW
of electricity has surpassed 6,000 hours (9 months) of non-stop operation at
a PanCanadian Petroleum oilfield in Alberta.  Not only has the units
achieved this length of operation, but they have done so at maximum output
with 100% availability.  Owing to their success with these units,
PanCanadian recently placed another three-pack of Capstone microturbines at
their Pelican Lake facility.
* Following the announcement that the exclusive joint development
agreement for fuel processor technology between UOP and Avista Labs
(subsidiary of Avista Corporation) would expire and not be renewed, UOP
intends to offer this fuel processor technology on a non-exclusive basis to
various fuel cell developers.
* Bergerat Monnoyeur Travaux Publics (BME), a Caterpillar dealer in
France, has ordered 51 Active Power flywheels (CleanSource(tm) DC) valued at
$1.4 million.  The units will be used to protect a 10 MW wafer fab facility
owned by STMicroelectronics in that country.

I do think that more of the trades will ultimately have to be changed, but no 
one else has said anything yet.

I am sorry that I have not talked to Andrew, though I have called twice.  As 
I'm sure you know, lately I have been a little distracted.  I'll try to 
contact him next week.

Meet the head of
the leading firm
in our business

Imagine the opportunity!
 Imagine that the leading energy company in the world has picked you to run=
=20
the
company that it expects to be the leading retail energy company in North=20
America.

 So you get a sharp competitive edge in the back room, you recruit IBM as a=
=20
co-owner
assuring you the lowest cost per customer by a factor of two or three.
To get your foot in 27 million doors you recruit AOL as a co-venturer with =
a
commitment from AOL to promote NewPower=01,s wares.
You do an IPO and take in about $700 million for working capital.  The IPO =
is
over and the quiet period it required.
But the most important silver spoon -- so that you get your energy at the b=
est
price and to protect you against price spikes -- you get up front 30=20
Enron-trained
risk managers and traders.  Can you imagine having to recruit them?

To make sure this team is run by the optimum chief they picked Eugene=20
Lockhart,
most recently president of Consumer Services at AT&T and before that presid=
ent
of BankAmerica=01,s Global Retail Bank with its consumer, commercial and sm=
all=20
business
banking services delivered through 3,000+ branches.
 Now, Lockhart's talking about his plans.
      Restructuring Today had lunch with Lockhart Thursday and reported in=
=20
detail:

 *  How NewPower intends to actually start up the retail industry?  What is=
=20
the
heart of NewPower=01,s business plan?
 *  How they'll make money in markets where margins may seem too thin.
 *  How he=01,s going to have 600,000+ customers next month and easily a mi=
llion
by the end of 2001.
 *  What percentage of their sales come from the NewPower website.  What=20
figure
is he using for cost of customer acquisition?
 *  Lockhart plans to have by the end of the first quarter or at the latest=
=20
the
second quarter 750,000 customers making them by far the largest unregulated=
=20
retail
marketer in the US.
 *  How does he think utilities will compete with the NewPower paradigm?
 *  What marketshare do they expect to get at first and then by 2005?
 *  What does he see as his biggest challenge?
 *  Why is this a good time for NewPower to invade California markets?
 *  Why will NewPower succeed where Enron failed?
 *  What=01,s the role of backward dating in forward market margins?
 *  Where NewPower gives a 20-25% discount on the commodity portion of a bi=
ll,
what kind of margin can it make now?
 *  How do higher prices help NewPower?  "We=01,re actually in a very good=
=20
position
given (that) the gas cost increases perversely will work in our favor ... "
 *  "We have a 10-year, exclusive agreement with IBM whereby we can issue a=
=20
bill,
collect the money and care for a customer at lower cost than anyone else in=
=20
the
industry by several orders of magnitude."

We=01,d love to send you the two-story, detailed report on how the leading=

in our industry is going to get there and stay there.

USA: Dynegy trades $1.5 bln via online energy portal.

HOUSTON, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Wholesale natural gas and electricity marketer 
Dynegy Inc. said on Monday its Dynegydirect Internet trading system had 
chalked up $1.5 billion in notional transaction values since its launch on 
Nov. 1. 
Dynegydirect (www.dynegydirect.com) currently carries Dynegy's bid and offer 
prices for over 300 energy and energy-related products, including North 
American electricity, natural gas and natural gas liquids. 
Coal, emission allowances and weather derivatives will be offered in the 
first quarter of 2001, with international energy products and 
telecommunications bandwidth following in the second quarter, Houston-based 
Dynegy said in a statement. 
Dynegydirect currently has over 400 registered users and Dynegy said that 
over $1 billion of the deals done to date over the system were generated by 
new customers for the company. 
In addition to its own portal, Dynegy has been trading on the Tradespark 
(www.trade-spark.com) multilateral online energy trading platform launched in 
September. 
Tradespark is backed by a partnership of several energy companies, including 
Williams Cos., TXU Corp. and privately owned Koch Industries. Dynegy has said 
it will join the partnership at a later date. 
Dynegy's home-town rival Enron Corp. is regarded as the frontrunner in online 
trading of wholesale energy products, with deals worth $183 billion 
transacted over its EnronOnline (www.enrononline.com) system between November 
1999 and October 2000. 
Enron executives have said they also plan to use other online trading 
platforms to do business and will not focus exclusively on the company's own 
platform.

Volume won't affect relative profitability.  It just scales the profit or 
loss.  Increasing the number of transactions always results in more profit.  
Increasing volume just makes the numbers bigger.

Greg:

Kevin Hannon and I were meeting yesterday to review various organizational 
issues and one thing he asked me to do was extend a one time only offer to 
take over the assets in Europe that don't really fit with their ongoing 
business - i.e. Turkey, Poland and Sarlux.  An additional question I had is 
whether you think that EWS continues to be the correct place for EEOS.

Your thoughts?

Jim Hughes

Subject: CPUC Decision Suspending Direct Access

The following points highlight legal/regulatory recommendations to the 
business team on the DA suspension issue.

All intelligence indicates that the CPUC will act on this issue at its June 
28, 2001 meeting (and there are sufficient votes for the decision).
Existing Contracts - It is our recommendation that EES should submit any and 
all DASRs to initiate DA service  to the appropriate Utility no later than 
June 29, 2001 for all customers that have existing contracts if we want to 
ensure DA service.
New Contracts - All new contracts should be signed by both EES and the 
customer no later than June 30, 2001 (July 1, 2001 is a Sunday).  DASRs for 
these contracts should be submitted to the appropriate Utility as soon as 
possible, but in no event later than July 6, 2001.  The July 6 date is our 
estimate of the last date the Utility would accept DASRs for new contracts.  
It is important to note that the CPUC is keeping the clock on contract 
execution timing.
Switching Option - Customers that are on DA service can be returned to the 
Utility per the tariff process.  Once the customer has been returned to 
Utility service after July 1, 2001, our expectation is that there will be no 
ability to have this customer receive DA service in a future timeframe.  In 
addition, returning to Utility service may incur a "re-entry fee".
Contract Extensions - EES should consider amending all current contracts that 
terminate after July 1, 2001 with a Evergreen Provision that provides for 
Index pricing with 30 day cancellation notice provisions.  These amendments 
should be signed prior to June 30, 2001.  It is possible that the CPUC will 
require marketers to detail the termination dates of their DA customers.  One 
additional thought - EES may consider having the customer assign any Negative 
CTC receivable to EES as compensation for the Evergreen provision (to 
overcome the CPUC language that indicates that the customer is due the 
Negative CTC credit).

We intend to set up a call for 5pm Houston time today to discuss (call-in 
number to follow).

Greg, still nothing firm about that, both utilities are screaming for relief. 
Gov Davis refered to 13 companies as the Dirty 13 for not selling into CA, 
Enron was one. That was off Wire this morning. FERC intervened yesterday. 
What is long term affect? Most utilities are concerned still problem. Ben

Subject: Enron OnLine


Thank you for your hospitality.  There were a couple of questions I had 
regarding our visit, some of which we left you with before our return to 
Washington.

I understood Dave Forster to state that EOL does not collect data regarding 
where a customer's mouse is moving on the system.  However, does EOL require 
customers to have cookies enabled?   If yes, does EOL collect, use or manage 
data regarding cookies?

Also, why doesn't EOL publish a "ticker" of completed trades showing prices 
and quantities?  Does EOL have any plans to start publishing such data?  If 
yes, when?

In addition, how does the data collection from EOL/Enron Networks flow to the 
risk management groups?  How is the information used?

Also, we assume that data regarding each trade is maintained by EOL.  If yes, 
in what form and for how long?

Thanks

Jeff,

I enjoyed visiting with you, Lou, and Greg last week.
I haven't heard anything back, and so wanted to check
in to see if it's appropriate to schedule a follow up
phone call.  I am leaving for Europe on June 30 and
will be gone for 10 days, so hoped to hear something
before then.  Thanks.

Chad

first several years. Lose o16mm

to be reported to Skilling, even though the real loss is just the gas loss of 
o16mm.

The EES VaR for today is $15.6 million, up from $14.0 million yesterday, due 
to the additional short positions added at NP and SP in the Power West 
portfolio.  The VaR should decrease once the short positions associated with 
the University of California facilities are removed.

Subject: Justice Department Investigation

Louise --

I wanted to make sure you were aware that the Justice Department has launched 
an investigation into the online electronic bond trading site set up by 
Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Chase, and others.   The Justice Department 
said that they are studying the "competitive issues that arise from such 
close cooperation among competitors."

I will monitor this very closely, as I'm sure it will have implications for 
the likes of ICE.

Hope you're doing well.

Lisa

ENE: Reiterate Buy; Believe Leadership Still Intact

* ENE has underperformed its peer group of Energy Merchants.  Stock
price down 39% from 52-week high ($90 on August 23) vs. peer group, up 1.9%.
* We reiterate our Buy rating on the stock, and believe the weakness
is largely due to concern over ENE's group-high P/E multiple and PEG ratio
of 27x and 1.3x, respectively (group average 19x and 1.0x), coupled with a
series of concerns over various parts of Enron's business: bandwidth, India,
etc.
* Our sense is that the bandwidth unit is performing on target, and is
likely to beat the strong numbers posted last quarter.  India, while a
significant issue, remains a small part of Enron's asset base (about 4%).
It is a legacy business, in our view, and does not materially affect our
overall view of the company.
* We see ENE's business fundamentals intact, and in fact, improving.
Growth rate expansion to 25% from 20%; growing returns on capital; bandwidth
trading all good reasons to own stock -- justify premium valuation.

ILA: Initiating Coverage of a Pure-Play Energy Merchant

* We initiate coverage of Aquila, Inc. with a 1H (Buy, High Risk)
rating and a 12-month price target of $44.
* Aquila is a pure-play Energy Merchant, leveraging their strong
trading and risk management skills in the rapidly growing energy commodity
markets.  Aquila was an early mover into these deregulating markets, and has
shown strong traction over recent years, which we believe is sustainable
long-term.
* We project a 20-25% growth rate for ILA driven by our robust outlook
for wholesale energy and the potential for successful expansion into new
commodities and geographies.
* At a 2002 0.7x P/E-to-growth (PEG) ratio, ILA is trading at a
significant discount to their Energy Merchant peer average of 1.0x. Based on
its strong track record and potential for industry-leading earnings growth,
we place a PEG value on ILA of 1.0x 2002 earnings, leading to our $44 price
target.

Computerworld Honors Acta Technology in Annual 'Top 100 Emerging Companies to 
Watch'; Industry Publication Recognizes Leader in B2B Data Integration
? 
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 4, 2000--Acta Technology, Inc., 
the leader in business-to-business (B2B) data integration, has been selected 
as one of Computerworld's "Top 100 Emerging Companies to Watch," the 
magazine's annual review of new leaders in high technology. The magazine has 
selected Acta as a winner in the highly-competitive eCommerce category, which 
includes other leading B2B software companies such as Blue Martini (Nasdaq: 
BLUE), Saga Software (NYSE: AGS), and Ventro (Nasdaq: VNTR). 
"We are honored to be included in this year's list of emerging companies," 
said Acta CEO Carol Mills Baldwin. "B2B data integration is emerging as a 
must-have technology for businesses around the globe. Recognition for this 
technology in Computerworld is further validation of the category we have 
created." 
B2B data integration resolves one of the principle issues in eBusiness today: 
that back-office systems were not designed to meet the data demands of B2B 
eCommerce and analytic solutions. Those demands include speed, scalability, 
and access to both the real-time and historical data locked away in multiple 
back-office systems. By staging real-time and historical data from multiple 
systems in data caches, the Acta eCommerce Data Platform allows companies to 
deliver the data that is needed, when it is needed, both inside and outside 
the enterprise. 
Industry analysts have sized the data integration market at $15B (cumulative) 
by 2005-driven by the need to provide information-rich data to partners, 
suppliers and customers for collaborative computing. 
With over 160 customers worldwide, Acta is well-poised to continue leading 
the growing B2B data integration market. In the past year, Acta has also won 
honors from Upside Magazine (Hot 100 private companies), DM Review (Winner, 
World Class Solutions) eWeek (Best Practices Award-B2B Category, Finalist), 
and Intelligent Enterprise (RealWare Awards-B2B Category, Finalist).

ENW VENTURES PORTFOLIO NEWS

Acta's New B2B Data Server Now Available for Multiple Operating Platforms; 
ActaWorks 4.4 Significantly Expands Support for Industry-Leading Data 
Integration Solutions

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 12, 2000--Acta Technology, Inc., the leader 
in business-to-business (B2B) data integration, announced today the general 
availability of ActaWorks 4.4, the latest version of its award winning 
enterprise data server. ActaWorks 4.4 provides recent product and performance 
enhancements that previously were available only for Windows NT (under 
ActaWorks 4.3). Acta made the announcement at the eBusiness Conference and 
Expo in New York City. 
The new product significantly expands support for the industry-leading 
provider of B2B data integration. With ActaWorks 4.4, businesses with Windows 
NT, Windows 2000, and Unix environments (HP-UX, Sun Solaris, and IBM AIX) can 
all employ Acta's new enhancements for packaging and delivering the data 
essential for B2B eCommerce and business intelligence. 
Among the new features is a repository architecture that enables centralized 
metadata management and multi-user development. As businesses implement a 
data platform to support both internal and external access to enterprise 
data, the need to manage metadata from external and internal sources becomes 
critical -- and the need for multiple users increases. 
The addition of these new enhancements further solidifies Acta's leadership 
position in B2B data integration, a rapidly emerging component of B2B 
integration. Industry analysts have sized the data integration market at $15B 
(cumulative) by 2005 -- a market that is being driven by the growing need to 
provide information-rich data both inside and outside the extended 
enterprise.

Trade-Ranger integrates multiple buying programs

HOUSTON, Dec. 13 -- Trade-Ranger, an Internet marketplace for the procurement 
of supplies by the energy industry, has integrated another type of software 
into its site to eliminate barriers to its customers and to help build 
liquidity. 
Allen May, interim co-CEO, told LocalBusiness.com the site has added another 
buying tool, iPlanet BuyerXpert software, at the request of one of its 
founding partners. Trade-Ranger already had Oracle Corp.'s iProcurement and 
Commerce One's e-procurement programs. 
"Our members are transacting, we have integrated multiple buying tools to the 
Commerce One platform, and we are continuing our effort to build the most 
efficient content hub in the industry," May said. 
"We will adopt the best-of-breed technology," he said. 
Houston-based Trade-Ranger was incorporated in August. Oracle (Nasdaq: ORCL) 
is based in Redwood City, Calif., while Commerce One (Nasdaq: CMRC) is based 
in Pleasanton, Calif. Meanwhile, iPlanet is a product of iPlanet E-Commerce 
Solutions, a Sun-Netscape Alliance. Sun Microsystems (Nasdaq: SUNW) is based 
in Palo Alto, Calif. 
Trade-Ranger is building its membership, and no numbers were immediately 
available, May said. 
Technology can be a barrier to liquidity growth, May said. Some marketplaces 
simply tell customers they must adopt that marketplace's technology, he said. 
"We definitely have an open policy," May said. 
He added that Trade-Ranger has made a significant investment in technology, 
although he was unwilling to disclose the amount spent. 
Formerly the Energy and Petrochemical Exchange, the Houston-based exchange 
announced its formation on April 11. The exchange describes itself as 
"created by the industry for the industry." 
Membership is available to all companies, buyers and sellers, in the 
upstream, downstream, retail and petrochemical sectors. Upstream refers to 
oil and gas producers, while downstream refers to the refining section of the 
business. 
The original 14 founding partners are Royal Dutch/Shell, BP, TotalFinaElf, 
The Dow Chemical Co., Conoco Inc., Motiva Enterprises, Occidental Petroleum, 
Equilon Enterprises, Phillips Petroleum, Mitsubishi Corp., Repsol, YPF, 
Statoil, Unocal and Tosco. 
The collective annual purchasing budgets of the founding partners exceeds 
$125 billion worldwide.

GM, Ford take $1.26-billion US stake in Commerce One software company

12/12/2000 
The Canadian Press 
Copyright (c) 2000 The Canadian Press. All rights reserved. 
DETROIT (AP) _ Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. will take a combined 
$1.26-billion US stake in Commerce One, making the business-to-business 
software company a technology partner in the automakers' Covisint online 
exchange. 
Pleasanton, Calif.-based Commerce One said it will issue to GM and Ford 14.4 
million shares apiece, with each stake valued at about $631.8 million, based 
on Commerce One's close Tuesday of $43.88 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The 
combined number of shares represents a 14 per cent interest in Commerce One. 
Half the shares for each company will be held in escrow until 2002, and will 
be released to Ford and GM upon satisfaction of certain conditions. If 
conditions are not met, the shares will be released to the two automakers in 
mid-2004. 
Commerce One said it will undergo a corporate restructuring into a holding 
company and get a two per cent equity interest in Covisint, the Internet 
exchange started by Ford, GM and three other automakers. Covisint 
incorporated for business Monday. 
Commerce One's stake in Covisint will be held in escrow until the completion 
of the restructuring, on which Commerce One shareholders are to vote next 
year. 
Commerce One will be entitled to a share of the revenue generated by the 
Covisint exchange for an expected 10-year term, as well as be paid for 
consulting services it provides to Covisint. 
``We look forward to continuing our efforts with Covisint to deliver a global 
e-marketplace platform for the automotive industry,'' Mark Hoffman, Commerce 
One's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. ``Covisint is an 
excellent example of Commerce One's business model and reflects our 
commitment to moving the world's business commerce onto the Web.'' 
In addition to Ford and GM, Covisint's backers include DaimlerChrysler AG, 
Nissan and Renault, as well as Commerce One and fellow software firm Oracle. 
Covisint is supposed to act as an Internet marketplace for the auto industry, 
allowing suppliers and automakers to swap information and conduct business 
far more quickly and cheaply than they have in the past. 
Detroit's automakers have said Covisint should be able to route their 
purchases of $250 billion a year in goods and services. 
Covisint said it has more than 250 customers on two continents already using 
its services, including catalogues, auctions, quote management and 
collaborative design.

please include them also.

Mr. Lay,

First - congratulations on your year 2000 to date. From what I have
researched, Enron is an incredible organization of products, services and
people.

I represent MobileStar - the worlds largest public Wireless Lan company.
Based in Dallas, and private at this time - we have built and will continue
to build a WIFI IEEE 802.11b lan network in public places such as hotels,
airports, airline clubs and retail/coffee house type places where mobile
users go, eat, move, meet and sleep.  You will find us today in many
Marriotts, Hiltons, Sheratons and American Airline Admiral club rooms-
offering unteathered T-1 speed connectivity to a company lan or the
internet.

We are soon to launch Hong Kong Int Airport and the London airports as well.
We also have a confidential network partner/s in the works to be announced
in the next 30 days that will take our public network to over 5000 locations
in the next 2 years. You will be interested I assure you.

I feel that not only is MobileStar a service that could benefit your mobile
global staff that travels both domestically, locally and internationally,
but also a partner tie in terms of content delivery, possible backbone
partnerships and video/Blockbuster delivery to a MobileStar subscribers
handheld, Ipaq computer or laptop.

I would very much like the opportunity to meet with both your IT team whom
investigates wireless applications and services for your personnel as well
as a member of your Broadband Development team.

Also - I will offer you a FREE trial subscription to our network for  your
travels.

I thank you for your time.

PS - We are heading into Series C funding..........

Regards,

Kevin

Attached please find a Tax Review of California Assembly Bill No. 128 ("AB 
128X").  The Tax Review sets out the practical implication (increased cost to 
purchasers) and constitutional deficiencies of AB 128X.

The third paragraph of the Tax Review details the mathematical computation of 
the tax and the resulting purchaser price increase.  The computation sales 
price, $300/MWh, reflects the SP15 (Southern California) weighted average 
index price ($302.88), rounded to the nearest hundred, as reported in 
Megawatt Daily's May 8th MarketReport.  However, it may be more effective to 
present the mathematical computation with a price closer to the proposed base 
price of $60/MWh.  We are available to assist in presenting the computation 
utilizing whichever numbers you deem appropriate.

The California Senate has passed SB 1X, Windfall Profits Tax on Electric 
Generators.  We will forward a similar memorandum addressing SB 1X.

We are available to address questions and/or comments.  Thanks.

Thanks very much to Enron for the card and gift.  I made my donation to the 
Boys & Girls Club of the Columbia Area because my wife has served as a 
director of this organization since its inception about 5 years ago.  Thanks 
again, and happy holidays to Ken Lay and colleagues at Enron.

I have received several calls this morning regarding the above, so apparently 
there is some doubt.  Please be advised that the executive committee will not 
meet today.  Further, due to travel schedules and the holidays, executive 
committee meetings will not be held on Monday, December 18 or Monday, 
December 25.  

Please make note that the next executive committee meeting will be held on 
Tuesday, January 2, 2001at 11:00 a.m. in EB50 Boardroom.

Don't hesitate to contact me should you have any questions.

Regards and Happy Holidays!

Summary

-Yesterday's hearing confirmed imminent death of SoCal MOU
-Plan(s) B also drew little support; state "trust" for generators unlikely
-QF/SoCal negotiations are "treading water" as SoCal runs out the clock; 
tries to postpone involuntary filing
-BK court unlikely to view SoCal payments to QFs as preferential because of 
state order

Report

1. Few Signs of Legislative Support for SoCal MOU

Sources report that Bryson is in regular contact with many legislators,
but especially with Hertzberg and Keeley on the Assembly side (from which
the Plan B is being directed) and Bowen (Senate Energy Chairperson) on the
Assembly side.  Sources believe that Bryson's comment may about the
legislature 'warming up to the MOU' may be a smokescreen; Democratic Senator
Alarcon said in the MOU hearing yesterday that the MOU is dead and is not
going to pass.  Reportedly no one attempted to contradict him.

Members of the Chamber of Commerce, large energy users,  TURN, the California 
Manufacturers' and Technology Association (CMTA) and  others also spoke out 
against the MOU.  (Sources found it remarkable that  TURN and the CMTA, who 
have been rivals in Plan B negotiations, agreed with each  other in strongly 
attacking the MOU.

2. Plan(s) B Are Still Foundering

 The Plan(s) B were not discussed at the hearing, though some of the same
issues came up.  For instance, it was discussed whether it was possible to
transfer all of Edison's obligations to a trust that pays out after the
conclusion of litigation.  In the opinion of the governor's counsel and
other lawyers present, this is "shaky," especially without the consent of
creditors.  In their opinion, there would have to be an agreement that would
pay off everything.

The governor's counsel stated there were constitutional problems with setting 
up a trust for what the generators are owed, then letting them litigate over 
the trust.  Also, he stated that it was not feasible for the state to be 
offering generators cash on the one hand while the FERC negotiated with them 
to refund the state for power
purchases (as ordered in the FERC decision Monday).  The governor's counsel
stated that the only reasonable thing for the state to do was to give the
generators their cash, then sue them for it.

3. QF/SoCal Negotiations Are "Treading Water"

 QF sources suggest that the debate between SoCal and the PUC as to whether
the QFs should be paid 10% or 15% of what they are owed is "not a real
question," but rather a stalling measure allowing SoCal to hold on to cash
in advance of a filing or a global solution.  "SoCal is just treading water," 
said a source.


4. SoCal Payments to QFs Unlikely to be Viewed As Preference  Payments

Sources also comment that SoCal payments to the QFs likely would not be
seen as a preference payment in bankruptcy court because they were ordered
by a state agency, the PUC.  However, comments made in the SoCal conference
call yesterday seem to indicate that Solomon Smith and perhaps other
creditors may see the payments this way and may be willing to sign a
bankruptcy petition.

Subject: Crisis in Enron Japan

Dear top management,

I know how dangerous if I use my real name so please forgive me to
use this free email.
I studied Enron for a long time before there is a branch in Tokyo.
How glad when I received the offer from Enron Japan! I believe my life must
have been changed to a new chapter.

But now... I'm so disppointed with enron Japan's poor management.
We local staff think Joe and other "experts" are too young to manage
this company. Forgive my impolite, EJ is really like a kindergarden!

In order not to waste your time,I conclude some points here:

1. Joe's poor management not only makes everything confused but also
makes local staff fears. He is so cold and imprudent that Japanese is
difficult to communicate with him. I know he is from Harvard,but that
doesn't
mean he is human,he is sensitive.

2. It's very obvious that Joe conflicted with Jonathan and now we don't
think he works well with Jeremy. We want to know why you top management
always make such kind of combination. Joe only trusts the people he worked
together in Norway and Australia. He has strong discrimination with Jonathan
and Jeremy's people,also has strong discimination with local staff.

3. Enron Metal is in the same office with us but like a completely different
company. No any communication between Enron Japan and Enron metal.The same
situation can be seen with E-power.Japanese mass media are suprised why
Enron
set up two companies in Japan. E-power is enough!!! Look at GE, why they
succeed
the business in Asia. They make joint venture company first. Until they are
convinced they can succeed, they open branch. Learn from GE!

4. The experts from overseas countries are really cheeky,they are not modest
to hear local staff's opinions but just push their methods to us. We can't
see any
democracy in this company!! If you want to succed your business,you should
also
hear some opposite ideas.You shouldn't alianate the people who say different
things! We don't need young associate! Let them go home!!

5. We don't need young experts because Japanese clients won't do business
if the counterparty is too young. All of the young experts should go home.
They are wasting enron's money!! To send young experts here doesn't match
Japanese culture.


All of these are true. I love Enron and want to see Enron Japan become a
comfortable and profitable place to work.

Thanks&regards
Sato

Dear Friends:

On Tuesday night, Republican Randy Forbes was elected to represent one of the 
most competitive, Democratic-leaning districts in America:  Virginia's 4th 
Congressional District.  President Clinton won the 4th district in 1992 and 
1996, and Republican Senate candidates lost the district in 1998 and 2000 
(even while they won statewide).

Despite the tough odds, Randy Forbes won a hard fought election on the 
strength of a positive message of furthering the programs and policies of 
President Bush.  While his Democrat opponent used scare tactics and negative 
campaigning, Forbes won the district by more than 5,000 votes.

The media labeled this election as a referendum on President Bush.  Democrats 
were desperate to win, but Republicans won another victory in a swing 
district.

To give you a bit of historical perspective, there have been 78 special 
elections over the past 25 years.  Only 19 of those special elections 
resulted in a change of party representation for the seat, and only three of 
those 19 swung toward the party of the President.  Historical odds were not 
in his favor, but Representative-elect Forbes defied the odds.

So what does this history-defying Republican victory mean to us on a national 
level?  The Forbes victory is proof positive of the continuing nationwide 
momentum across the political spectrum for President Bush's agenda for 
America.

And you have been a large part of sustaining the Bush momentum.  You helped 
President Bush and Congress achieve together what critics said couldn't be 
done - a bipartisan $1.35 trillion tax relief package.  The first round of 
tax relief checks was mailed yesterday, and I sincerely appreciate your 
helping American taxpayers get the relief we deserve.

If President Bush is to succeed in improving our schools, rebuilding our 
military, saving Social Security and Medicare and ushering in the 
responsibility era, he will need your continued help and involvement.

President Bush is counting on all of us to become his Team Leaders.  Learn 
more about this unique opportunity to spread the President's message and help 
retain and increase our majorities in 2002 by visiting 
http://www.gopteamleader.com.

Again, thank you for your continued efforts.  Without you, odds are we 
wouldn't have been able to win in Virginia.

Very truly yours,


Jim Gilmore
Chairman, Republican National Committee

Background on VA-04 Special Election
June 20, 2001

Upset in Virginia Special Election

A Victory for White House & National GOP

Republican Team Pulls Together, Victory a Model for
'01 and '02 Elections

-- Last night, Randy Forbes was elected to represent Virginia's 4th district, 
receiving 52.1% (70,926 votes) to Democrat Louise Lucas' 47.9% (65,189 
votes).  This election is a swing district-President Clinton won the district 
by 1% in 1992 and 7% in 1996, while President Bush won the district by less 
than 1,000 votes.

--  In the past 25 years, there have been 78 special elections.  Only 19 
resulted in a change of party representation for the seat, and of the 19, 
only 3 swung toward the party of the President.  Now 4.

--  President Bill Clinton pre-recorded thousands of turnout calls for this 
special election.

-- The voters embraced the President's policies.

-- Most importantly the President's policies were embraced in a moderate 
swing district drawn by Democrats, further evidence that President Bush is 
addressing the issues that affect and unite everyone.

-- Randy Forbes ran on the programs, policies and momentum of President Bush. 
Randy ran on moving the President's policies forward and now the results are 
in and the outcome is clear.

-- Media pundits recognized that this would be a referendum on the President.

Bob Novak, of The Chicago Sun-Times: "A mailing came out from the Democratic 
candidates...saying...there's no doubt who the Bush Republican will help, who 
it will hurt -- six million minority families and 12 million children will be 
left behind."  (CNN's "Inside Politics," 06/07/01)

Mark Shields: "Larry, is this Virginia race really an early referendum on 
President George W. Bush?" U.Va. Professor Larry Sabato: "To a certain agree 
I think it is."  (CNN?s "Capital Gang," 06/16/01)

"Numerous national analysts called the [special election] a test of the two 
parties' strengths and a possible bellwether for the fight for control of the 
House of Representatives in 2002.  Some of the national cachet surrounding 
the contest comes from its status as the first congressional election since 
Vermont Sen. James M. Jeffords' defection from the GOP switched control of 
the Senate?"  (Tyler Whitley, "Lucas, Forbes Push Turnout," The Richmond 
Times-Dispatch, 06/19/01)

"...a contest that's being widely viewed as an early indicator of voter 
attitudes toward Bush and his policies.  The result, said Stuart Rothenberg, 
an independent analyst of congressional campaigns, is that the race looms as 
'a sort of referendum on George W. Bush, on the energy issue, on Social 
Security and on the direction of the country.'  Indeed, Rothenberg and others 
will review the outcome as a possible harbinger for the 2002 midterm 
elections."  (Robert L. Jackson, "Va. House Race May Show GOP What It Faces 
In '02," Los Angeles Times, 06/17/01)

"National politicians view the toss-up race in Virginia's 4th District not 
only as a possible referendum on the Bush administration but also as a 
bellwether race that will determine which party has the momentum heading into 
the 2002 elections."  (Allison Stevens, "Polls See Virginia Race As Preview 
Of Battle For The House In 2002," The Hill, 06/13/01)

Bob Edwards: "The election is being portrayed as a referendum on the Bush 
administration."  (NPR's "Morning Edition," 06/13/01)

Fred Barnes: "This election in the fourth district of Virginia is the Vieques 
of elections.  It's the testing ground for this Social Security issue.  And 
if the Democrat, who is an African- American woman named Louise Lucas, if she 
wins, Democrats are going to rightly conclude, this Social Security issue is 
dynamite, and we can attack Bush's partial privatization bill."  (Fox's "Fox 
News Sunday," 06/17/01)

"Political analysts said the race would be viewed as an early referendum on 
the Bush administration and as a bellwether for next year's midterm 
elections."  (Larry O'Dell, "State Senators Compete For Open Seat In 
Congress," The Associated Press, 06/19/01)

"[T]oday's by-election in Virginia's Fourth District has become a referendum 
on Mr. Bush's first five months. If the Democrats win, they will argue that 
Mr. Bush has once again been rejected and that they have the momentum for 
next year's crucial mid-term elections."  (Damian Whitworth, "Battle Flares 
As Virginia Poll Puts Bush To Test," The London Times, 06/19/01)

Events:

-- GOP Unity, May 10: White House Political Director Ken Mehlman spoke at the 
Chesterfield GOP Unity dinner on May 10.  Chesterfield County was Forbes' 
primary opponents strongest county.

-- Fundraising, June 4: Vice President Cheney spoke at a fundraiser in 
Chesapeake where nearly $100,000 was contributed to the Forbes campaign.

education.

-- Sportsmen, June 14: Former NASCAR superstar and current FOX racing analyst 
Darrell Waltrip visited a Forbes for Congress picnic, garnering media 
coverage both on the front page and the sports pages of local newspapers.

Grassroots Activity:

-- Mail: President Bush signed his name to an absentee ballot mail piece that 
garnered more than 2,000 responses.  Bob Dole signed a letter that went to 
55,000 veterans and their families.

-- Phones: Over 66,000 phone calls were made with a message from President 
Bush.  45,000 phone calls were made to seniors with a message from Barbara 
Bush.

-- State Parties: 42 GOP State Parties contributed money to the Forbes 
campaign, with the majority of parties sending $5,000, the maximum allowed, 
raising a total of $230,000.

-- Members of Congress: Approximately 130 Members of Congress contributed 
money to the Forbes Campaign, including dozens of leadership PACs.

Other Activities:

-- Veterans, May 19: Secretary Principi attended a Veterans event on May 19 
to reach out to the 150,000 servicemen, former servicemen, and military 
families in the district.

-- Outreach, June 8: Congressman J.C. Watts attended a Forbes event in a

The EES VaR for today is $11.1 million, up from yesterday's VaR of $8.2 
million, due to the additional short positions added at NP and SP.   The VaR 
will decrease once the short positions associated with the University of 
California facilities are removed.

Gentlemen:

 Attached is the DASH for the approval of the DPR Accelerated Put 
transaction.  This partial divestiture allows us to put $11 million of our 
equity interest back to DPR Holding Company, LLC and its subsidiary, Dakota, 
LLC.  Both entities are controlled by Chris Cline.

 In addition to redeeming part of our equity interest, the deal provides us 
900,000 tons of coal priced below market, an option which could lead to a 
very profitable synfuel project, and the potential for more marketing fees 
from other Cline entities.

 The DASH has been approved and signed by RAC and JEDI II, and is now 
awaiting Mark Haedicke's review and approval.  I wanted to give you the 
opportunity to review the DASH and become familiar with the provisions of the 
deal.

 If you have any questions on the transaction, feel free to contact me at 
(412) 490-9048.  Others familiar with the deal are Mike Beyer, George 
McClellan, and Wayne Gresham.

 Thank you.

  Bill Giuliani

Given the current tremendous energy market volatility and as we stretch 
resources to make our commercial goals for 2000, we think it would be 
appropriate to postpone the ENA 2000 Offsite to early next year.  I trust 
this meets with your approval and thanks for all the hard work.

California Regulators Back Rate Increase For Utilities

* California regulators indicated yesterday that they are willing to
raise rates for electric utilities EIX and PCG,  following a review of their
finances
* Hearings to review utilities' financial status in hearings on Dec.
27 and 28
* KEY DATE:  January 4, when we expect they will vote to raise rates
* We see this action as positive for the utilities, because it reduces
the likelihood of insolvency or bankruptcy, although further action is
required, in our view
* We also see it as positive for our Growth Energy companies.  Any
reduction in financial pressure on the utilities equates to reduced pressure
to re-regulate the wholesale power industry, in our view
* The results of the action were in line with our expectation; we
recommend investors buy the Growth Energy names on weakness.  In particular,
we highlight DYN, CPN, NRG, SOE and DUK.

In March I left a message for you explaining that I was accepting an offer  
from ElPaso. That decision followed my having brought together the pieces of  
a project that John Nowland indicated Enron was not prepared to consider and  
my subsequent presentation of the project to ElPaso who embraced the deal. 

John indicated that the 90 day delay he inserted into our discussions  
resulted from your having considered Trammo. I understand that Trammo is no  
longer a target for Enron and wondered, therefore, if our getting together  
for an hour would be timely. 
The industry still presents a target rich environment and you are still the  
biggest horse in the race. 
Kind Regards, 
George Dorsey

Dear Friends,

President-elect Bush has brought together an excellent group to serve as his
Cabinet.  His nominees are a diverse, experienced, and strong group.  They
will help enact his agenda, change the tone in Washington and make us proud.

Your help is needed to get these outstanding men and women confirmed by the
United States Senate.  Some of President-elect Bush's nominees are being
unfairly attacked by outside groups and the Senate needs to hear that from
you.

One of the first Senate hearings will be Tuesday for Senator John Ashcroft,
President-elect Bush's choice for Attorney General.

The hallmark of Senator Ashcroft's long history of public service has been
integrity.  As Attorney General, he will uphold the law and make the
Department of Justice an institution all Americans can be proud of.

He brings a unique record of service to this challenge.  He was twice
elected Missouri's Attorney General, serving with both Republican and
Democrat Governors.  He was elected Governor of Missouri, an important swing
state, and then reelected with 64% of the vote.  John then was elected to
the U.S. Senate, where he just finished a six-year term.  No other Attorney
General has ever had this wealth of experience.

John has a long history of strong leadership on important issues, including:

- Won widespread acclaim for his effectiveness in running the Missouri
Attorney General's office by attracting strong men and women to serve his
state and strictly upholding the law
- As Senator, co-Sponsored the Violence Against Women Act
- As Governor, signed Missouri's first Hate-Crimes Bill and fought to
protect victims' rights
- Balanced the State Budget all eight years As Governor
- Made Education Reform a priority as Governor
- Toughened penalties for crimes committed with a Gun
- Worked To protect children at school, strengthen classroom safety
- Voted For background checks at pawn shops
- Was Endorsed By Missouri Law Enforcement Agencies
- Supported 26 of 28 African-Americans nominated to the Federal bench
- Was commended as Governor by one of the oldest Black Bar Associations for
his record of appointing minorities
- Appointed many African-Americans to Missouri's courts
- Was one of the first Governors to sign a law creating a Martin Luther King
holiday
- Created an award honoring George Washington Carver's Accomplishments,
saved Lincoln College, an historic Black college founded by African-American
veterans of the Civil War.

Some groups are attacking Ashcroft for opposing the nomination of Judge
Ronnie White to a lifetime appointment as a Federal judge. Every Republican
Senator opposed White's confirmation, in part, because he urged a lower
legal standard for a man convicted of first-degree murder 4 times (including
the first degree murder of three police officers).

Some groups charge Ashcroft will not uphold abortion laws with which he
disagrees.  This is wrong and simply an attempt to undermine the new
Administration.  Ashcroft understands the job of the Attorney General is to
carry out the letter of the law.   He will restore the rule of law to the
Justice Department and run a highly professional department.

Please do two things.

First, let your Senator know you strongly support a fair confirmation
process for John Ashcroft.

Go to http://www.senate.gov/senators/senator_by_state.cfm to find the
contact information for the Senators from your state.

Second, let the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee know you support
John Ashcroft's confirmation.  The committee begins its hearings Tuesday.
Its members are: http://www.senate.gov/~judiciary/members.htm

D(DE) Biden Jr, Joseph, (202) 224-5042, senator@biden.senate.gov
R(OH) DeWine, Mike, (202) 224-2315, 
http://www.senate.gov/~dewine/request_form.html
D(WI) Feingold, Russell, (202) 224-5323, russell_feingold@feingold.senate.gov
D(CA) Feinstein, Dianne, (202) 224-3841, senator@feinstein.senate.gov
R(IA) Grassley, Chuck,, (202) 224-3744, http://grassley.senate.gov/webform.htm
R(UT) Hatch, Orrin, (202) 224-5251, senator_hatch@hatch.senate.gov
D(MA) Kennedy, Edward, (202) 224-4543, senator@kennedy.senate.gov
D(WI) Kohl, Herb, (202) 224-5653, senator_kohl@kohl.senate.gov
R(AZ) Kyl, Jon, (202) 224-4521, info@kyl.senate.gov
D(VT) Leahy, Patrick, (202) 224-4242, senator_leahy@leahy.senate.gov
D(NY) Schumer, Charles, (202) 224-6542, senator@schumer.senate.gov
R(AL) Sessions, Jeff, (202) 224-4124, senator@sessions.senate.gov
R(NH) Smith, Bob, (202) 224-2841, opinion@smith.senate.gov
R(PA) Specter, Arlen, (202) 224-4254, http://specter.senate.gov/webform.htm
R(SC) Thurmond, Strom, (202) 224-5972, senator@thurmond.senate.gov
D(NJ) Torricelli, Robert, (202) 224-3224 
senator_torricelli@torricelli.senate.gov

Finally, two recent comments from current United States Senators:

Senator Robert Torricelli (D-NJ) had this to say about the Ashcroft
nomination:

"'I think it represents a very good choice'. . . the only things people want
in an attorney general are 'good management, sound judgment and high
integrity.  They're not easy to find in one individual, but I think John
Ashcroft has all of them.'"  "I certainly assume I will be voting for
him."  - Sen. Robert Torricelli (D-NJ) (David Kocieniewski, "Staunch Democrat
Eases Up on Opposition," The New York Times, January 6, 2001; Audrey Hudson,
"Democrats Set For Ashcroft's Confirmation," The Washington Times, January
4, 2001) (emphasis added)

Senator Kent Conrad (D-ND) Commended Ashcroft.

"I rise to pay tribute to Senator John Ashcroft as he prepares to leave the
Senate. . . . Senator Ashcroft has been a man of his word who served his
state and his country with distinction.  I join my colleagues on both sides
of the aisle in wishing him well in his future endeavors."  (Congressional
Record, December 15, 2000)

Thank you.

(Please forward this message to friends, family and co-workers and ask them
to show their support for President-elect Bush by asking their U.S. Senators
to support the confirmation of John Ashcroft)

Dear Louise and Greg:

Fortune magazine's September article about your--virtually
overnight--success building EnronOnline prompted me to contact you, mostly
because our company's (Everypath, Inc.) wireless technology could be the
perfect tool to help you move the EnronOnline marketplace into wireless by
offering trading anytime, anywhere, via any wireless devices (as we've done
for E*Trade, Fidelity, and others offering complex wireless transactions).

Very briefly, our company has quickly gained real traction in this space.
We were honored as a Smithsonian Laureate this year, named by Forbes among
the 25 Best of the Web in business to business, and recognized by CNet as
one of ten "wireless companies to watch."   Our partners include Sun
Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard, Andersen Consulting and Cap Gemini Ernst &
Young, as well as many others, and have already raised significant funding
from investors such as Robertson Stephens, Comdisco, Dain Rauscher Wessels,
Sevin Rosen, U.S Venture Partners, Andersen Consulting Ventures, Sun, and H
& Q.

If you see commodities trading moving soon into wireless,  just as you saw
(or influenced) the industry to move online, shouldn't Enron lead the way in
wireless trading too?  We would love the opportunity to talk to you about
helping you go wireless.

Let me know if I should follow-up with you or someone else in your group by
sending an email or calling at any of the numbers below.  I look forward to
hearing from you, and to coming home to Houston to speak with you further
about this (I practiced law in Houston for years with Weil, Gotshal &
Manges--over in the NationsBank building on Louisiana).

Sincerely, David Marcus

Cover Story:
THE TECH SLUMP
Slowing growth in tech spending, not shrinkage, is what's in store. But that 
will be painful enough -- for the industry and the economy as a whole.

http://www.businessweek.com/premium/00_51/b3712001.htm
After midday Monday, for all readers:

Election 2000:
HOW BUSH WOULD LEAD
As the election process crawls to its seemingly inevitable conclusion, it 
looks like George W. will face a slowing economy, a divided Congress, and an 
uneasy nation. But don't judge W., who has a history of being underestimated, 
just yet.
>From Wednesday night until midday Monday, for subscribers only**

After midday Monday, for all readers:

THE BEST PRODUCTS OF 2000
>From an improved -- but still refreshingly low-tech -- $1 pencil to a BMW 
that goes for $130,000, we've picked out the best of this year's new  stuff. 
Now you can't complain that you don't know what to get anyone for the 
holidays!

Summary of Energy Technology Bulletin:

* Siemens Westinghouse and four European utilities have formed a
consortium to build a 1 MW hybrid power generation plant that will combine a
Siemens solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and a microturbine, which will be
supplied by the consortium utilities.  The unit will be tested as a
pre-commercial system for the European market and is expected to be in
operation by October 2003 at an Energie Baden-Wurttenberg AG (EnBW) facility
in Marbach, Germany.
* Two European utilities have awarded Siemens Westinghouse contracts
for their tubular solid oxide fuel cell system.  The two pre-commercial
units, one of which will be delivered to RWE Power AG in Essen (February
2002) and the other to Edison Spa in Milan (September 2002), will be 300kW
hybrid systems incorporating a microturbine and operating on natural gas.
* Real estate companies Arden Realty, CALPERS and RREEF dedicated two
large commercial solar power systems yesterday in Los Angeles.  The first
installation features nearly an acre of photovoltaic panels located on the
roof of a three-story office building owned by Arden Realty while the second
is located on an industrial building in Carlsbad, CA that is jointly owned
by CALPERS and RREEF (joint venture company is named CalWest Industrial
Properties).  Real Energy Corporation will sell the power generated by these
systems to the respective building owners.  Edison Development Corp., a
subsidiary of DTE Energy, supplied the solar panels that were built and
installed by PowerLight Corporation.

Enform expands Sun Micro partnership
HOUSTON, Dec. 15 (LocalBusiness.com) -- Enform technology, a high-tech 
consultant, said it has expanded the company's strategic partnership with Sun 
Microsystems Inc. Privately held Enform said Palo Alto, Calif.-based Sun 
Microsystems (Nasdaq: SUNW) is letting the company employ its integrator 
technology called iForce eIntegrators, for use in creating Web applications 
and building back-end systems that connect to the site. Sun will help Enform 
build its service offerings and create custom consulting services, which will 
be jointly marketed.  How much more business this will bring to Enform is not 
clear, and company officials today were not available to discuss the deal. 
Enform, which is run by John McNevin, a former partner at Ernst & Young, has 
grown quickly in its three-year existence. The Houston company helps 
businesses reinvent themselves by upgrading their systems or finding new 
technologies they need to remain competitive. Since its inception, Enform has 
apparently been profitable. It hasn't needed any venture capital to operate. 
The company has about 200 employees, with branch offices in Dallas and 
Austin, and expects to post sales of about $21 million this year. Enform 
recently told LocalBusiness.com that it expected to log about $100 million in 
sales next year, if the economy holds. Its client list includes Microsoft 
Corp., Engage Energy and Continental Airlines.

The EES VaR for today is $8.2 million, up from yesterday's Var of $5.0 
million, due to the short positions added to the Power West portfolio at NP 
and SP.   The VaR will decrease once the short positions that were recently 
added to cover the University of California system deal are removed due to 
EES' successful appeal.

The IRS has announced that the standard mileage rate for use of a personal  
automobile for business will be 34 1/2 cents per mile starting January 1, 
2001.  Enron's policy is to follow IRS guidelines, so use this rate for all 
mileage incurred on or after that date.

Summary:

* U.S. President George W. Bush unveiled his National Energy Policy
today.  In our report we list the recommendations made by the National
Energy Policy Development Group (NEPD) as they pertain to Renewable and
Alternative Energy.  In addition, following each recommendation, we provide
our views on the potential impacts on specific CSFB covered companies
(AstroPower - APWR, Ballard Power Systems - BLDP, Capstone Turbine - CPST,
FuelCell Energy - FCEL, Proton Energy Systems - PRTN) in the Energy
Technology sector.
* We would note that many of the recommendations instruct certain
departments or individuals to conduct further research on various topics and
to report back to the President at a later date.  Our view is that many were
included as a counter point to more contentious issues and may receive
somewhat limited action from the Administration.
* Overall, we are not changing our estimates or recommendations on any
of our companies at this point in time.  The proposed solar tax credit
when/if passed will cause us to review our forecasts for AstroPower.  We are
not forecasting incremental unit volume of production given the capacity
constraint of the company, although residential installations tend to have a
higher revenue per watt and higher margins than non-residential markets and
therefore could result in higher EPS contribution.

John,

The news story relates to this report that DWR released today.  They held a 
press release.  They said that the state would honor all of the executed 
agreements, but any non-binding "agreements in principle" would be subject to 
renegotiation.  In general, they say they have executed about 6,000MW of long 
term agreements and about 5,000MW under "agreements in principle".  

DWR signed our Master Agreement.  We are holding off signing it because of 
litigation risk, per Tim and Legal.  

Chris

Announcing the Formation of One Corporate Equity Investing Unit

To better develop and manage equity investment opportunities related to our 
core businesses, Enron has formed one corporate equity investment unit.  This 
new unit, Enron Principal Investments, will combine the existing investment 
units of ENA, EBS and Enron Investment Partners.  Additionally, the Enron 
Wholesale Restructuring Group will also become part of Enron Principal 
Investments.  The strategy of Enron Principal Investments will be to work 
with the all the business units of Enron to identify, execute, and manage 
equity investments, which leverage the Enron's unique and proprietary 
knowledge.   These investments may be in the form of venture capital, LBO's, 
traditional private equity and distressed debt positions.   

Kevin Garland will serve as Managing Director of Enron Principal Investments, 
overseeing all of its activities.  Gene Humphrey, Michael Miller, Richard 
Lydecker, and their groups, will join Kevin and his group to form this new 
investments unit.

This new investment unit will report to Greg Whalley, in his capacity as an 
Enron Policy Committee member.  Please join me in congratulating and 
supporting Kevin, Gene, Michael, Richard and the other members of this group 
in this effort.

The EES VaR for today is $14.0 million, up from $11.1 million yesterday, due 
to the short positions added to the Power West portfolio.  The VaR will 
decrease once the short positions associated with the University of 
California facilities are removed.

Summary of Energy Technology Bulletin:

* Energy Co-opportunity (ECO) and Capstone have entered into a
contractual relationship whereby ECO will be a preferred provider of and
will offer Capstone's 30kW microturbine unit to the electric cooperative
industry.  The contract also calls for the purchase of 76 units, which ECO
believes will sell rapidly given the interest indicated by its customers.
* Dublin, Ireland-based power developer Eirtricity is considering the
development of what would be the world's largest wind farm.  The 500 MW wind
farm would see a combination of land and offshore-based wind turbines,
likely in County Wicklow.
* Calpine c*Power, a subsidiary of Calpine Corporation, and AFS
Trinity have entered into a strategic partnership that will see Calpine
c*Power market AFS' flywheel products as a component of its Reliable Power
Systems that are designed to serve datacom ports.

True, but the limits and associated P&L notifications relate to commodity 
groups rather than business units - they used to be the same. Unfortunately, 
where we have become more sophisticated and, as in this case legitimately 
hedge a natural exposure with some other commodity, the latter commodity (and 
associated P&L) gets counted in the commodity "cut".

Loss notifications, especially, serve as a "flag", and provided the 
explanation makes sense and everyone who needs to make a decision about it, 
can do so, then it serves its purpose. The other upside is that when, 
sometime in the future, we have to refer back to an event, we have good 
"institutional memory".

I talked to Brent about this yesterday - my advice was that notifications 
would be better drafted by those closest to the positions (i.e. his mid 
office groups)

In this Violation memo, you are taking out positive P&L associated to a nat 
gas posion in the LPG books which is a true hedge versus some long dated 
propane positions.  When you add back the hedge P&L I believe there is no 
violation.

Please ignor my previous mail regarding the same issue, which contains some 
typos.



Greg and John,

I found that by reducing the volume per trade and increasing daily number of 
trades ( keeping the 
total volume per day constant), we can be more profitable.  This is partially 
because in a trending market
we lose less money by following the market more closely. For example, suppose 
market move from
$30 to $35. If per trade volume is 10,000 BBL and the half bid-offer spread 
is $1 for simplicity, we take 5
 trades of short positions, the total MTM for that day is 
(-5-4-3-2-1)*10,000=-$150,000 and total trading 
volume is 50,000 BBL short.  If per trade volume is 50,000 BBL, we take one 
trade, the total MTM is 
-5*50,000= -$250,000.   Thus the net difference between the two trading 
strategies is $10,000 for that
particular day.

Therefore it seems that by reducing per trade volume and increasing the 
number of trades, we can be more
profitable as a market maker.  

I rerun a scenario that Stinson sent to you on Dec. 27 where he used per 
trade volume of 30,000 BBL.
I reduce the number of trade to 10,000 while increasing the number of trades 
by factor of 3.  Almost in all
cases, I saw increased profitability.  See the colume marked "Change" for 
dollar amount change in millions.

Please let Stinson or me know your thoughts on this.

Regards,

Zimin Lu
