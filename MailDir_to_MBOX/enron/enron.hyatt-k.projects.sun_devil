Kevin:

Thanks for the system map.  As we discussed previously, Crystal Gas Storage
is pursuing the possible development of a natural gas storage facility near
Phoenix on the Luke salt deposit.  We would like to discuss in more detail
the possible expansion of the Transwestern system and a possible
interconnect with the storage facility.  We are in Houston almost weekly and
would like to schedule a meeting at your convenience.  If you would like to
pursue these discussions could you check your calendar and suggest some
possible dates.  You can contact me via e-mail or by phone at (318)
677-5511.  If I am not available, please contact Jeff Ballew at (318)
677-5512.

Thanks,

David Hayden

This is my understanding too.  We can discount GRI away and we only have to pay the Gas Research Institute what we collect.  We have to pay the ACA, if we discount it away.

One more check would be Jeanette Doll.  Jeanette?

The GRI is a voluntary surcharge that the Shipper indicates they want to pay.  We just collect it and pass it on to the Gas Research institute.  The ACA is an Annual Charge Adjustment to recover cost charged to us by FERC.  We typically do not waive or discount this charge.  The other surcharges are due to past settlements and are not applicable to new expansion projects.  These are defined in the Tariff in sections 21 and 23 of the General Terms and Conditions.



Lindy

Did I state this correctly.  Please let Eric and me know if I miss stated anything.

James,

On Sun Devil, are we required to collect GRI, ACA, or any other surcharges?  If so, how are they applied?  If not, why?

We have gone through and added environmental tasks and costs for seeing the
project through the construction phase (see attached).  The previous
estimate I sent only provided estimated costs through to receipt of the FERC
Certificate.  These costs are based primarily on prorating tasks from other
similar projects on which we have worked, including both of Northern
Border's most recent projects, Southern Trails, Gulfstream, and SoNat's
Caballero.  Please call with any questions or concerns.  We can continue to
refine these costs and provide greater detail, should that prove to be
necessary.  Please let us know.  Thanks, 

Scott

To calculate maximum hourly allowable volumes the daily firm volume (Maximum Daily Quantity, or MDQ) in the contract is multiplied by the hourly per cent.  If the per cent is not shown in the contract, then the tariff rate of 6% is used.

Assuming 1000 MDQ, at 6% is:

1000 * .06 = 60 per hour, or a daily rate of 60 * 24 = 1440

So at any time the customer can flow at a rate of 1440 but cannot exceed 1000 for the day.  An individual delivery point cannot usually drastically affect the mainlines, but they can affect smaller laterals.  Consequently, any lateral for this customer would be designed to deliver 1440 per hour.

Shorthand for the daily rate is .06 * 24 = 1.44.     Multiplying any MDQ by 1.44 gets the daily rate, assuming the max hour is at 6%.

No draft of this order/staff recommendation is available.

Though I haven't seen a draft or a copy of the Powerpoint presentation,
from the discussion at today's Open Meeting, Staff is recommending to the
Commission the following (along with a technical conference to work out
specifics):

-  The Commission convert El Paso's Full Requirements service (FR) to
Contract Demand service (CD)
- Allocation of CD is based on the greater of (1) a shipper's billing
determinants from the 1996 settlement, or (2) coincidental peak (a
shipper's own usage) based on demand on Sept. 12, 2001
- The Commission assign specific receipt point rights to shippers based on
El Paso's proposed 20 pooling point configuration
- A technical conference be convened, that may include attendance by the
Commissioners, in the Staff recommendations

During the discussion, Staff pointed out that the FR contracts in question
have become unjust and unreasonable.  However, as part of the required
conversion, Staff recommends that the existing settlement rate structure be
maintained and that FT2 FR rate schedule (for a capped amount of small
customers) be maintained to protect a very few small customers.

A more in depth summary of the discussion will be sent shortly.

Larry,

Please give me a report following your fly-over of the route with Doug Cebryk.  I am very interested in what you see and the potentials that are there.  Don't forget to take your camera.  Pictures (slides) would be most helpful as we work through the early planning stages for the greenfield portion.  As the primary route begins to solidify with alternates, we will need to develop some preliminary maps.  It is my understanding that no maps of the route will be released with sign-off from the entire group of: Hyatt, Taylor, Veatch and Shafer.

After we receive the "fatal-flaw" desk-top analysis from ENSR (Sept. 21 - although I hope to get it sooner), I would offer that several events should be scheduled to expedite the project as follows:
1. If the open season reflects that we have a project and Eric Gadd approves, a couple of quick meetings will be held with strategic groups to discuss the project potential (TNC, State Land Managing agencies, US Forest Service, etc).  These strategic groups will be identified by the ENSR fatal-flaw analysis.
2. Simultaneously, we will begin working with ENSR (if the open season reflects that we have a project) on developing a full scoped Environmental Strategy for Sun Devil (this will include an RFP that will immediately go out soliciting bids for the Resource Reports and permits). 
3. We will work with Steve Veatch and Joe Hartso to schedule a meeting with the FERC Staff (we need the commitment of the State Land Managing Agencies, US Forest Service, etc. to collaborate with the FERC on the NEPA review) to introduce the project and solicit their commitment to offer staff resources early in the process.
4. We will also need to develop a Public Relations and Government Affairs strategy which will identify the early meetings that need to be held with local, state, federal jurisdictional governing bodies and politicians - so the right folks have a heads-up on the project before it hits the news media.  This also includes developing a strategy on where and when the project will formally be announced (i.e., news conference in Phoenix or Houston, etc.).  A $580 Million project will be a big deal in the Phoenix area and for the Southwest.

I know there is more, but this will help to keep some of the early events coordinated.  John Shafer

I've arranged a breakfast meeting with Dick Ingersoll next Thursday at 7:30a.m.  Dick is a retired Enron hand living in Phoenix and is on retainer to ETS for consulting services.  He is extremely knowledgeable about electricity markets, transmission infra-structure, counterparties, regulatory development, etc., etc., etc.  I plan to task him to help us improve our market knowledge.  My thoughts are outlined below.  Please advise if you would like him to provide additional studies/analyses.

Transmission capacity opportunities + constraints from AZ to CA and Pacific Northwest
Assessment of merchant power plant developments in AZ, Gulf Coast, and FL
Large scale power plant site developments along ETS pipeline corridors
Power marketing, eg selling electricity produced from waste heat recovery concepts

Subject:	Additional Questions from Eric

Hi Kevin!

Eric thought we might get the questions below.  Can you provide answers to these questions?

Thanks or your help, Gina

PS - the capitol of Arizona is Phoenix.

QUESTIONS THAT NEED TO BE ANSWERED

How much new gas is being produced in the Rocky Mountain and San Juan gas supply basins? [Hyatt, Kevin]   San Juan Basin production peaked in 1999 at 4.3 Bcf/day and is expected to decline by 2.4% year for the next 10 years.  However, over the same 10 year forcast period, 6500 new wells are scheduled to start producing.  In addition, current Rockies production is expected to average 250 MMcf/d in 2001 growing to 570 MMcfd by 2009.   

What gas-fired electric generation projects will be served by Sun Devil? [Hyatt, Kevin]    There are a number of power plants currently being developed in the Phoenix area.  We are evaluating which projects make the most economic sense to serve. 

Kinder Morgan and El Paso are proposing pipeline projects to serve Arizona and California.  Why do we need another pipeline? [Hyatt, Kevin]    The KM Sonoran project proposes to serve the California border and eventually the San Francisco area, not southwest Arizona.  El Paso's proposed expansion is not expected to be enough to meet the growing demands of the Southwest including Phoenix, Southern California, and Baja California.

Gas prices are collapsing in the Permian basin.  How competitive are new gas supplies from the Rocky Mountain and San Juan basins? [Hyatt, Kevin]  Gas production in the Rockies and San Juan basin has been on the increase but there has not been enough pipeline capacity to move the gas to market.  This capacity bottleneck has had the effect of depressing prices in the San Juan basin.  Historically, San Juan prices have been a few pennies to as much as fifty-cents below Permian gas prices.  As recently as Jan. 2001, San Juan gas was nearly $2.00 less than Permian. 

Why are so many power projects being developed in Phoenix?  How necessary is all this new power generation capacity?  What markets will it serve?
[Hyatt, Kevin]  The Southwest U.S., inlcuding the Phoenix area, has experienced an increase in population and therefore energy demand.  Over the last several years, power reserve margins (the available power supply in excess of demand) have been shrinking from a high of 22% to less than 8%.  This reserve margin decline, coupled with a drought-induced decrease in available hydro power supplies from the Northwest, have created a need for new electric power plant generation capacity.  Because of the availability of high voltage transmission capacity from the Palo Verde area, it was natural for developers to site plants near these lines to move power into Phoenix and Southern California.


The economy is not nearly as strong now as it was last year.  Why do we need more pipelines and power plants? [Hyatt, Kevin]   Existing pipe capacity to the Phoenix and So. California areas is not sufficient to meet EXISTING demands, let alone the demand created by the new power plants under construction.  There are more power plants planned for the Phoenix area, but with the economy slowing down, those projects may be somewhat delayed.

	El Paso Full Requirements contracts - this debate was stricken from FERC's agenda again this week (for the 3rd time) indicating dissent among Commissioners on how best to settle the allocation of El Paso's system serving Arizona and California markets.  We may see a draft allocation order circulated prior to the next FERC meeting on 3/14.

	Az Public Service - Conference call was held 2/28 to discuss the latest proposal.  APS remains hesitant to make any project commitment until they have a clearer direction from FERC on their EP full requirements contract.  APS is forwarding to TW their likely operating scenarios for the 2000 Mw Red Hawk plant so we can draft an SFV rate design.

	The Arizona Corporation Commission granted permit approval this week to a new 1000 Mw gas-fired power plant in southeast Arizona.  The new Bowie plant sits on the El Paso south system and is slated to be on-line in 2004.  The new plant will only add to the capacity pressure on El Paso.

	Panda Energy - credit discussions were held outlining the provisions ETS would like to see from Panda to support a transport agreement.  Panda is forwarding to us the cash waterfall language from their debt agreements that puts the fuel supply (including transport) and electric transmission payments ahead of all others (including bondholders).


Gomez Lateral

The confidentiality agreement was executed with Pioneer Gas Pipeline this week.  Right-of-way documentation and maintenance records are being assembled so Pioneer can begin their due diligence.  Other potential purchasers of the lateral may be Western Gas Resources, Sid Richardson, El Paso Field Services, and Duke Energy.


TW Station 1 Heat Recovery

Ormat, an experienced developer/operator of HRSG equipment, has expressed written interest in acquiring all the heat production from the compressor station to generate up to 6 Mw of electricity.  They intend to sell the production to the California Power Authority as "renewable energy."  Station information has been forwarded to Ormat for their review.

Eric:

I spoke earlier today with the banker who led the TECO-Panda financing for Societe Generale (lead arranger with Citi on the $2.2 bill. merchant project financing).  Following is a summary of the call with healthy amount of detail since it may be some time before we have a chance to visit.  Due to confidentialities, Jim could only go so far on some details, so you'll note a number of gaps; however, this should cover many of your questions.  Call upon return after the holiday and we can discuss further.

Also attached - after notes - is an article that should capture many of the financing details.  Given other demands, I've not yet read the article so duplication between the notes and article is inevitable.  A word of caution - PFI details are good but not always accurate so rely principally on the call notes.  I also asked for portions of the Offering Memo. but am doubtful on receiving this.  Distribute further as you see fit.

Summary of Call
This was a merchant financing with both projects (Phoenix and El Dorado, Arkansas) cross-collateralized and x-defaulted - so treated as a single financing.  
Approx. 2250 MW per site for total of 4500 MW (with 4 separate units per site).
Sources of funding - Total of $2.8 Bill. ($2.2 Bill in debt and $600 MM in funded equity).  Apparently all of the $600 MM equity was funded at close June 01' [further confirmation is needed].  Of the $2.2 Bill. in debt, $1.7 Bill. was non-recourse and $500 MM was an equity bridge, with recourse to partners.  However, lenders looked principally to TECO's credit backed by several guaranty of equity bridge and fronting of the $600 MM in funded equity.
Partnership - 50/50 in all respects (ie. vote and economics).  However, TECO must have some preferential rights (eg. cash flows etc..) given their substantial commits on the deal.  
Term of debt - 2 yrs. construct facility plus 3 yr. mini-perm with bullet at maturity (approx. 8% amortized at maturity).  Five years is the market for merchant deals.  Amortization is 18 yr. mortgage style.  144 A expected form of permanent take-out of term debt.  
Leverage - 60% financed by term debt, but approx. 50% debt financed when adding all ancillary facilities and other commits (ie. working capital, letters of credit etc..).  Jim kept details to minimum but further info. is needed here.
Key Ratio was debt service coverage.  Base Case assumed an average DSCR of 3.40X and Min. of 2.40X with cash trapped at 1.75X.  Did not get detail on whether DSCR was both historical and forward looking, but suspect there was some kind of forward test.  Project finance banks typically expect 3.25 to 4.25 DSCR on merchant finance deals.
Leverage, DSCR and structure in general was done based on what is generally required to gain investment grade rating from agencies when permanent take-out is sought.  Additional rating agency requirements can be found on Moody's and S&P web sites.  
TECO also will act as operator.  TECO was clearly crucial to deal and at least Soc. Gen. had done prior deals with them (not sure about Citi).  Panda brought TECO into the deals.  Although Panda was a known quantity, Soc. Gen. had no direct project history with them.
Fuel and Power Off take - Lenders looked to extensive an Energy Management Program analysis.  The EMP presumed (by C.O.D.):  50% of fuel and power would be under firm contract, 25% of each would be covered by seasonal swing contracts and remaining 25% would remain merchant.  Intention is a complete match (term and volumes) for fuel and power contracts.  Agency agreements were signed with Noble (1yr. contract) on fuel supply mgt. and Aquilla (2 yr. contract) for managing power sales.  Each buys in name of the projects.  TECO is responsible for overall energy mgt. and coordination between Noble and Aquilla.  Jim said EOD is triggered if fuel and power agreements are not signed in line with E.M. Program by C.O.D.  Lenders got comfortable with lack of fuel and power contracts due to substantial equity commitment (approx. $1.1 Bill.).
Consultants were Pace for fuel supply and overall energy management and RW Beck for power market eval.
Fuel Transport - Much of medium term contracted at close (mix of firm and interruptible capacity) out to 7 yrs.  Lenders looked to new and released capacity to fill non-contracted needs.

Thanks for the quick response.  The objective at ETS is to arrange a long term gas transportation agreement with the Gila Bend project.  We estimate their requirements to be 386,000 MMBtus/day and understand that El Paso has agreed to provide 100,000 MMBtus/day.  Gila Bend is one of several potential strategic shippers for our project and we are extremely interested in the credit quality of their project, recourse to parents, etc.

Principle risks + mitigants to understand:
Gas supply arrangements
Gas transportation arrangements
Financing arrangements, sources of funds
Power off-take arrangements
Who is the Operator?
Ownership structure, decision-making, etc.
Financial recourse to parents

I spoke with the project bankers at one of the lead banks (principal underwriters) here in town.  They are scheduling a call for me with the banker who lead the deal on their side.  I will be asking about fuel supply issues, key risks, terms etc.  Forward any additional questions you have and/or provide more specific questions of fuel etc.. and I'll give it a go.  I also asked for the Offering Memo., which will be near impossible to get due to confidentiality issues but will let you know how it goes.  Let's visit about you attending as well.

Sun Devil Pipeline Project

Marketing
-- Meetings scheduled for week of 1/7 with power generators Salt River Project and AZ Public Service in Phoenix.  Issues for discussion include accessible rights-of-way and opportunities to use the project as an alternative to underground storage.

--  Panda Energy:  expect a response to our market proposal during the week of 1/14.

Engineering - is exploring options to reduce compressor costs and overall project costs.  Their goal is $100 million in reductions.  Will regroup 1/18 to review  potential reduction areas weighed against operational flexibility and volume.

Storage - we are exploring ways to offer a limited firm Park N Ride service on the new project; this would help compete against the proposed salt dome storage and may garner a larger market share for Sun Devil.

FERC and El Paso Full Requirements Contracts - Arizona Governor Hull wrote a letter to FERC Chair Pat Wood emphasizing he not forget about the East of California shippers on El Paso.  SRP submitted a straw man settlement to FERC for their consideration.  The topic is expected to be on the agenda for FERC's meeting on 1/16.

Not sure why they just sent it to me.  At any rate, here is the estimate consistent with the scope in the Power Point presentation being prepared for Stan.  

I would say let me know what else I can do, but I'm getting ready for a command performance this afternoon with Horton and head off to spring break vacation with my wife and high school freshman tomorrow.  

I'll be back Monday week.  Actually, Arnold or Mike Smith should be able to answer any questions you may have. 

(oops, I just noticed that the Red Hawk line is about 10 miles shorter here.  Not sure what that is about.

Lorraine,

It was a pleasure to meet you yesterday and hear about your pipeline project.  As promised, I am sending you the name and number of the person that knows the other company here in Dallas that was looking at a site in the Gila Bend area.  I am also including the coordinates of our site so you can let us know if it is feasible to come to our plant.  I would appreciate it if you could let me know, as soon as you can, what that cost would be so we can run our economics on it.

Mr. Campbell,
Don't be surprised at anything you see me pulling together like this.  The longer we are together, you will see that there is usually a reason to what may seem like madness' at the time.  We will look for those "win-win" situations that can bring Sun Devil into the light as a great environmental project as well as a solid economic growth effort which promotes sustainable development.  I am envisioning an initiative with youth in the greater Phoenix area that we can tie to Sun Devil.  Hang on the ride of your life.  More to follow.  John

Carole, 

Enron Transportation Services (ETS) has recently met with RMEF to discuss being involved with their elk conservation program.  We are moving ahead with plans to be associated with RMEF in the near future.  (ETS is a wholly owned subsidiary of Enron Corp, headquartered in Houston, Texas.  ETS operates several major natural gas pipelines throughout the United States.)  

During the meeting, a copy of the current edition of the Bugle was given to us.  I read the article  "High Schools for Habitat - A "Monster" in the Making" and felt like this might be an excellent concept for our company to support.  The article is great and I especially liked your quote "What better way to pass it on than to raise a generation of citizen conservationists and pass on that spirit and that love of wildlife."   I believe we all want be involved with something beyond a "one time shot" that has a lasting effect into the future.  With this in mind, I would like the opportunity to explore ideas with you on how ETS might partner or form relationships with schools that would yield continuing future rewards.  I know you must have a very busy schedule, so please do not feel this requires an immediate response.

I can be reached by return email, or you can reach me at 713-646-7425. 

Thank you for your time and I commend you again on your article. 

Bob Adams

Sun Devil Marketing

--  Met with Panda Energy and Tampa Electric officials and discussed the latest transport proposal.  The pricing and term were well received.  We have forwarded to Panda an outline of the credit terms TW will need as well as supply contacts and points available to them in the San Juan basin.  We are also evaluating a reverse-tilt transport offer to provide them with a lower rate in the early years, but the rate may not be enough to provide adequate coverage ratios for the pipeline project.

--	Arizona Public Service - APS responded this week to our latest offer.  Their concerns were (1) TW credit in the face of the current Enron bankruptcy, and (2) our volume offer of 200,000/day in light of the current El Paso full requirements debate.  As for credit, we forwarded to APS the current update on TW's efforts with the various rating agencies and our timeline for getting a new rating established.  For volume, APS may be willing to sign up for less volume and forgo the "out" clause, but this puts more of the early development risk on TW for capital required to file the FERC application.

--	Project Engineering - with Doug Cebryk's resignation, the Sun Devil project has been forwarded to Arnold Eisenstein.

I found a mistake in the first Excel spreadsheet when discussing with Kim Kouri.  Cost Estimate Summary sheet (2nd tab) did not add all of the rows down for the San Juan portion.  The attached was corrected.  It made a difference of $5,000,000 total project cost.

Kevin,

That is the scenario where we installed all 36" pipe and added two new stations (Station #1.5 & Kingman).  The pressure to Panda will be greater than 600 psig.  The lateral is off the discharge of Station #1.5 which keeps the pressure profile up.  Looking at a minimum of 750 psig with and upside of 900 psig.  Hope this helps.

Ron Matthews

Ron, 
	can you please verify for me the delivery pressure in pounds for volume off the Sun Devil project at the juncture of Panda's lateral at the El Paso interconnect outside of Phoenix?  Using Doug's cost scope from 9/28/01, are we at 600# or something different?  This was the scope with the 36-inch Phoenix lateral.

thanks

John and Larry,

I have sent a copy of the Fatal Flaw Analysis to Jon Schmidt for review and
input.  It truly is a "living" document, and can be as complete as you would
like it to be.  However, budget has run short for us.  We have not, to this
point, been able to include as much as we would have liked, but most of the
roads that we started down have to be researched further anyway.  I will be
in Denver tomorrow morning, but will be back in the office in the afternoon.
Dave Hubbard has requested that we provide the Sundevil cost estimate broken
down on a monthly basis, which is what I will be working on tomorrow night.
I am attending the Wyoming Natural Gas Fair, leaving Wednesday, for the
remainder of the week.  In my absence, please coordinate with Jon Alstad.
Jon has been working on the fatal flaw analysis alongside me and is as
familiar with the project as I.

I can be ready and available for any agency meetings you would like me to be
involved in at any point.  Let me know.  Thanks,  Scott

Eric,

There are a multitude of cases run on this project over time and it's hard for everyone to pick the most current.  Please refer any facility questions to Planning and Optimization so we can respond with the most current information.  Arnold is right where the pipe lengths are but has the wrong story why.

The COMPLETE mainline loop from SJ tie-in to takeoff point between stations 1 and 2 was always about 222 miles.  Then add 16.5 miles downstream of station 1 for pressure support and the total is 238.61.   Some of the previous cases you have  seen did not include FULL looping, starting the Phoenix lateral at Station 2 and relied on more compression.

The Red Hawk lateral new length is based on starting at the end of the Panda Lateral to Red Hawk paralleling and existing line.

Not sure why they just sent it to me.  At any rate, here is the estimate consistent with the scope in the Power Point presentation being prepared for Stan.  

I would say let me know what else I can do, but I'm getting ready for a command performance this afternoon with Horton and head off to spring break vacation with my wife and high school freshman tomorrow.  

I'll be back Monday week.  Actually, Arnold or Mike Smith should be able to answer any questions you may have. 

(oops, I just noticed that the Red Hawk line is about 10 miles shorter here.  Not sure what that is about.

Thanks Kevin.  We will continue to work on preliminary information.  At any point that the project begins to look like a go, let's sit down with the appropriate internal departments and develop a strategy for how to approach the sensitive issues (including the environmental reports, landowner issues, media, native americans, FERC application, etc.)   Thanks, John Shafer

Kevin, 
We have continued to make early contacts with the environmental community and some permitting agencies in Arizona to get a feel for any sensitive issues that might confront the proposed Sun Devil Project.  I think the information will be invaluable as the project is sited.  I appreciate the opportunity to be involved in the project at this stage and stand ready to provide any assistance needed as you move forward.   We will get more definitive information (especially related to the greenfield portion of the project) as we define the proposed corridor.  Why don't you catch me up on the project after your open season results start to come in.  If it looks like a "go" I would suggest that a project team be organized to plan the strategy for involvement with the environmental community, Native Americans, local government, state government, Federal agencies, the media, landowner resistance, etc.  Let me know if you need anything else.  John

Subject:        Phone Conversation with TNC 

Today I spoke with Jean Calhoun of the Arizona Chapter of The Nature Conservancy about the proposed Sundevil Pipeline Construction Project. She was very cordial and appreciative concerning Transwestern's proactive efforts to contact not only her office but all federal and state agencies  which may have jurisdictional lands impacted by the project.  Although the proposed route of the pipeline corridor has not been firmly established, she did  offer some general, yet valuable information concerning the geographic area which exists south of Flagstaff into roughly northern Phoenix.  

The area south of Flagstaff into Phoenix crosses of three major ecological regions identified by the TNC with major biological diversity of plants and animals.  The TNC has completed published studies on two of the regions.  The TNC has requested that should this project be apporved, these publications be used to assist in the environmental studies which will need to be completed prior to construction and approval by FERC.  To the south and east of Flagstaff is a sensitive portfolio consisting of the Verde River which is of ecologic interest due to the abundance of endangered fish and bird species which live in and around the area of the River.   This river could be impacted by the pipeline due to its meandering in a southwesterly direction across Arizona.  

I have contacted other state and federal governmental agencies, in addition to the TNC, and all parties have expressed difficulity in assessing the environmental impact of a project of this magnitude without knowing the pipeline corridor route.  Part of this concern is due to the extensive and unique biological diversity of Arizona.  I think we will have a better handle on how we address the environmental concerns and opportunities when this piece of the puzzle is completed and also how much more specific and helpful the agencies assistance will be when identified areas are known.

Attached at the bottom of this email is the Staff powerpoint presentation
on their recommendation to the Commission on El Paso's Full Requirements
service (FR).  The Staff Recommendation is not yet available.

Summary

As noted in yesterday's email, Staff is recommending the following general
principles:
-  The Commission convert El Paso's Full Requirements service (FR) to
Contract Demand service (CD)
- Allocation of CD be based on the greater of (1) a shipper's billing
determinants from the 1996 settlement, or (2) coincidental peak (a
shipper's own usage) based on demand on Sept. 12, 2001
- The Commission assign specific receipt point rights to shippers based on
El Paso's proposed 20 pooling point configuration
- A technical conference be convened, that may include attendance by the
Commissioners, on the Staff recommendations

Background

Staff recounted the issue on El Paso's system, including the question to be
decided by the Commission: has El Paso's FR service become unjust and
unreasonable?  Staff believes it has, and explains that it is within the
Commission's jurisdiction to allocate El Paso's capacity in order to:
      (1) restore system flexibility
      (2) end uncertainty (in the form of pro rata capacity cuts) of firm
delivery
      (3) ensure full & fair utilization of El Paso's system

According to Staff's presentation, the problems on El Paso's system are due
to changes in system load since the pipeline's 1996 settlement.  A major
increase in CD load and the sale of all unsubscribed capacity since 1996
(which was nearly one half unsold at that time) has changed the operations
and capacity availability on El Paso, resulting in frequent capacity
constraints on the system.  This problem is aggravated by the settlement's
resultant rate freeze, which impedes any economic incentive for El Paso to
expand or upgrade its system.

Recommendations (Bob Petrocelli presenting)

Staff recommends that the Commission convert FR to CD, while maintaining
(1) the existing rate structure from the 1996 settlement, and 2) a small
amount of FT-2 FR contracts (for small customers, such as municipalities),
with an overall cap on the rate schedule.  This will "balance the interests
of all shippers and restore firm service on the El Paso system."  Also, it
will send the proper price signals for system expansions.

In comments on this and related proceedings, shippers have recommended four
allocation methods for the converted CD:
      (1) 1996 settlement bid determinants
      (2) system peak (coincidental demand)
      (3) individual peak (non-coincidental demand)
      (4) some combo of the above

Staff recommends utilizing the greater of #1 or #2 (using Sept. 12, 2001,
as benchmark demand day).  This reflects current usage mitigated by the
settlement capacity contracts.

Staff also recommends the Commission assign specific receipt point rights,
using El Paso's proposed expanded 20 pool system [in this proposal, El Paso
narrows its current six pools in three basin areas to 20 geographic pools].
As support of this recommendation, Staff noted:
      (1) it is consistent with the Commission's one-time delivery point
allocation in BR/Amoco/Topock complaint case
      (2) gives certainty for supply to all shippers
      (3) enhances the tradeability of capacity
      (4) eliminates daily pro rata curtailments in the basin

Commissioners' Discussion

Pat Wood:  He noted that 10-year settlements are far too prospective and
will never be approved by him.  Whether the Staff recommendation is the
best fix is the question that will be explored in the technical conference.
Chairman Wood also asked how the economic incentive to expand will be
different -- Staff answered that in 1995 the settlement's intent was to
keep the system viable at all, and changes are needed to move to next step.
Wood also noted that "this wouldn't have happened if El Paso had complied
with Order 636 -- it's a lesson on the power side that we not carve out
exceptions."

Nora Brownell:  Brownell asked questions about the current infrastructure,
how the takeaway capacity at Topock is being handled, and if this addresses
future capacity needs.  Staff responded that this is "an economic fix to
the current disincentives for El Paso expansions," and that there are
proposals out there to address future capacity and takeaway needs.

Bill Massey: Stated that the current situation is "intolerable" and that
Staff's presentation persuaded him that their plan is reasonable because
"bold Commission action is necessary here."

Linda Breathitt:  She asked if there are any other interstate pipelines
using FR service, and was told no, only some intrastate municipalities
still utilize FR on a commodity demand basis.

Attached is a Level B request for the Sun Devil project.  Keep in mind that this should include only right of way at this time.  Details on the compression will probably change based on the responses during the open season.

Kevin,

I will let you send this to Doug for tomorrow's meeting as we discussed.  Any future Planning correspondence to Engineering  will be sent directly from the Planning team with a copy to Asset Management and Marketing.  Arnold E.wanted a copy now to get started on reviewing existing compression.  He's fully aware it will probably change later.

John- As you no doubt have heard, Enron is going through extremely difficult times presently.  I myself had another sinus surgery 3 weeks ago and they inserted a sub-clavian catheter in order to feed intraveneous antibiotics twice daily for six weeks to aggressively treat the infections in my sinuses.  My father passed away on 11-17 and I have been out of the office for the last 3 weeks.  I am back now on a part time basis and spoke with Kevin Hyatt today about the status of Sun Devil.

If the project goes forward, it will be financed differently than we originally intended.  We have submitted proposals to a couple key parties and would like to move forward with one for Energy Development soon.  We are asking for firm commitments by the end of this year for a 30 year term.  We are at a critical stage with Sun Devil at this time.  In order to move forward and spend the necessary $9 million on the EIS we need firm commitments.  

When you get some time please call me to discuss.  Thanks.

I got a call back from Ed Peck over the weekend.  He said that he didn't
know where the BLM guy got his numbers, but that $1MM/mile for ROW would be
extremely steep.  He said that he has heard about the rumored price Kinder
Morgan Sonoran might have to pay, said it was pretty astronomical, but not
near that expensive.  We still haven't spoken directly to eachother (just
voice mail).  He said that he was down meeting with "Octar?" last week and
will be meeting with "Octar" again Tuesday 9/25 in Gallup.  He acted as
though most anyone I'm speaking with at Transwestern should know who "Octar"
is.  I have another call back into him - is there anything specific you
would like me to ask him?  He said that most folks at Transwestern should
have a pretty good idea of what ROW costs should be on Navajo. Ed just
called.  He said that Octar is the Navajo Director of Minerals and that Ed,
Louis Soldano, and Johnny McGee just finished negotiating the renewal of the
twin mainlines and the San Juan Lateral through 2009 with Octar - it was
$30MM.  He said that they brought up the possibility of a new line with
Octar, and that he thought it would be something similar for the new line.

THat is ROW cost he quoted, Scott does our Navajo consultant have any
experience about what the tribe will ask for on the ROW ?  This cost is not
for cult. res. work.

As for schedule, if we go the informal collaborative approach, FERC won't
take a year from the time we file, but more like 7-8 months, thereby giving
them some more time on the back end.  But to do this requires getting land
permits in for federal easements, and yes, that does require some survey
detail.  j

Jon,

See Doug Cebryk's note below.  Is the quote correct on the cost per mile
for Arche' work?   And even if that is the normal cost - that would be
paid for only those miles of ROW where Phase II and/or Phase III work
would be done???? Not the entire 400 miles?????  Help me here to
quantify!  John

To All
I have done a cursory review of the requirements of the agencies
contacted, and 2 significant itmes leap out.

#1 New Mexico BLM Permitting - Cultural Resources
David Simmons - Archeologist - Farmington BLM office quoted " Navajo ROW
costs usually approximately $1MM/mile". THIS COULD MAKE AN UNECONOMICAL
PROJECT FROM DAY 1

#2 Longest permit times are 1 year, which means that with a tentative
schedule as follows:
FERC Filing - Sept/01 to March 30/02
FERC Approval - April 1/02 - April 1/03 - 1 year
Construction - April 1/03 - Jan 1/04 - 9 mos 

In order to start construction by April 1/03 to achieve an in service in
early 2004, application for specific long lead permits will need to be
made April 1/02. This will require significant field work and design
details prior to April 1/02. I doubt we will be ready to commit to such
an undertaking this early in the process.

I suggest after the ENSR fatal flaw analysis is complete, a very
comprehensive review of all permits and their relation to the critical
path is undertaken.

has been contacted.

little more open with the regulators.  I would not publish anything in
the paper (as yet) showing a route, etc., etc. as that will only get the

In discussions with several agency personnel, it "appears" as though
they
are somewhat aware of Sun Devil.  Is it still to be treated as
confidential,
or can we discuss it more freely?  The main benefit I see, if we can
discuss
it more freely, is that many of the regulators have said things like "I
would need to see a route to be able to answer your question better."
Let
me know.  Thanks,  Scott

Scott, I shold probably clearify something.  The existing right of way, which we intend on staying in, at least around Cordes Junction is located west of I-17, which will not impact the Agua Fria National Monument, which occurs on the east side of the interstate.  Should we be forced to move to the east side of I-17, then the Monument may become a problem.  Like you, I was taking into consideration all possible issues in the pathway of the proposed construction and also those that are in the near proximity and have the potential of becoming an "opportunity" in the event we are forced to deal with them.

Subject:	RE: Review Draft  - Sundevil Fatal Flaw Analysis/Briefing Report


Gentlemen,

Attached is our work to date (minus the telephone call summary sheets and
permit requirement summary sheets [Appendix A] you've already received) on
the Fatal Flaw Analysis/Briefing Report for Project Sundevil (or is it The
Sundevil Project, or Sun Devil [2 words, rather than 1])?  It truly is a
working document, and can be expanded in areas as you see fit, or there may
be other areas you may want us to discontinue researching.  This review
draft is provided for your review and input as to where you might like it
expanded and where you might like effort to be discontinued.  As I mentioned
yesterday, I will be out of town the remainder of the week.  Please contact
Jon Alstad in my absence with any action items and input you may have.
Thanks,  Scott

Doug, I got a call from Don Mohler this morning wanting to know if we had
done a cursory check of faults and seismicity in the vicinity of the
SunDevil route.  He said to get back to you with the information.  Overall,
the probability of seismic activity in the region is low.  Additionally,
there are not many major faults showing up in the vicinity of the project.
We have a lady taking a closer look at Alquist-Priolo maps, but we don't
expect faults and seismic activity to be a major issue for the project.  We
will provide more detailed information if we find anything worth mentioning
on the Alquist-Priolo maps.  Scott

Kevin,
I am still working with the Arizona Chapter of TNC to get the information I=
 was looking for.  However, preliminary talks is that there are no show-sto=
ppers from the environmental community at this point.  There will be some s=
ensitive issues, but we can work through them.  On a project of this magnit=
ude (400 miles, with about 200 of it greenfield) an environmental strategy =
should be developed which would probably include some early scoping meeting=
s to assess public and landowner input.  I would suggest that you consider =
having a Third Party do the EIS for the FERC Staff (it is much faster that =
way as the FERC does not have to dedicate staff to a major filing).  Also, =
have you thought about whether or not we would want to go to the FERC early=
 and solicit their involvement up-front to expedite and streamline the proc=
essing?  I am assuming that Rob Kilmer will be in charge of putting the app=
lication together since he has assumed the TW work from Mark Kay Miller (at=
 least that is what I have been told)?  I would also suggest that you think=
 about enlisting the input from the Public Relations folks (i.e., Gina Tayl=
or). =20

We have already been in contact primarily with most of the state and
Federal

agencies.
I could get you a complete list of agencies we've contacted if you'd
like,
but almost every agency that would or could issue a permit in both
states
has been contacted.

Scott,
Please furnish a list of who you will be talking with.  (Caveat: Scott,
you certainly realize that you must provide the FERC with summary notes
of meetings with groups, agencies, etc. when we make the FERC filing -
so keep good notes).  John

Kevin and Eric,
Please read Scott's question below.  I have no problem with being a
little more open with the regulators.  I would not publish anything in
the paper (as yet) showing a route, etc., etc. as that will only get the
landowners stirred up before we are ready.  What are your thoughts?  Are
you comfortable with Scott being able to show the regulators a map of a
preliminary route?  John

In discussions with several agency personnel, it "appears" as though
they
are somewhat aware of Sun Devil.  Is it still to be treated as
confidential,
or can we discuss it more freely?  The main benefit I see, if we can
discuss
it more freely, is that many of the regulators have said things like "I
would need to see a route to be able to answer your question better."
Let
me know.  Thanks,  Scott

Mr. Hyatt, Greetings from eSource:

Pursuant to your request for 5 years of gas production for the Rocky Mountain Region.   I'm providing the historical data 1999-1996 as reported to the Energy Information Administration.  Arizona's data was shown not available.  However, I have attached Arizonia's gas production and sales data, available through the EIA's special reports. I will provide the forecasted data as soon as it is available.   Should you have any further questions, or additional tasking, please do not hesitate to contact us.


  


Thank you for using eSource.  We look forward to assisting you in the future.

Ben or Ron

Please provide the horsepower requirement for the Sun Devil Project at the various load factor on the attached spreadsheet (hplf).  We need to be able to see what impact Sun Devil has after Red Rock in the event the California load decline below 1240 MMbtu/day or Arizonia load are not at the 750 MMBtu/day levels.  Need information as soon as you can provide it.

Thanks,
James

Call Joanna Scruggs 602-417-9300

ask for the overlay statewide digital index map ($18.50).  They recently
updated it to 1996 vintage.  The scale is 1:750,000.  From this map you
can order the 1:100,000 scale BLM maps ($4 each).  Checks can be sent
to:

Arizona Public Land Information Center
222 North Central Ave.
Suite 101
Phoenix, AZ  85004

I don't know if they take credit cards, but if they do, it might speed
up processing.  You may just want to order the big scale map and all the
smaller ones and save some time.

For right now, consider the info below as the likely terminus for the Phoenix lateral.  This was taken from the APS press release announcing their gas storage project.  Let me know if you have questions.
kh


As part of the study, a 30-acre site, located on a thick, naturally occurring salt deposit, is being evaluated to determine if it has the potential to support an underground cavern storage facility. The property is located in an industrial area near the intersection of Dysart Road and Glendale Avenue, near Luke Air Force Base. SunCor Development Company, a sister company of Pinnacle West Energy, is the property's current owner and has applied for the necessary permits to conduct the study.

To all
We have covered most of the routes on the ground, but are unable to fly at this time.
Current plans are to stay in Phoenix until we can fly the routes by helicopter.
The route north out of the cavern site( common to both I 17 and the El Paso options) is very congested with development.
The route south from the cavern to the Panda Energy tie-in is even more congested and will require extensive detailed analysis. We will most likely have to go NW from the site around Luke Air Force base and about 6-8 miles west before we can turn south and head to the proposed Panda/El Paso tie in point at MP 619.
 
We have obtained a very detailed air photo booklet of maps ( indicating subdivision development and county planning)that we can use to evaluate the route options both north and south from caverns, so will be able to study on paper over the next 2-3 days if we are unable to fly by helicopter.
All for now

We will probably be making some briefing presentations after the open season ends on August 30th.  Based on the high level of customer interest expressed thus far we expect to receive strong support for our proposed project.  At this point in time we have not yet scheduled any particular meetings however are there any specific dates in Sept. that would work on the Governor's office schedule?

By the way, I got a call back from Greg Simmons in the BLM State Office in
Arizona - my question to him was whether or not a proposed ROW across the
Agua Fria National Monument would constitute a "Fatal Flaw."  He indicated
that it likely would be a fatal flaw.  He said that it would take "an act of
congress" literally, not figuratively, to put a pipeline across a National
Monument.  The boundary of the Monument is the east side of I 17, south of
Cordes Junction - I don't know if we can stay on the west side of the
Interstate there, but we might oughta check it out - it looks like we could
get into some pretty rough side-sloping, two-toning.  FYI.

As reported in Gas Daily today, the CPUC has issued a report assessing the state's gas infrastructure of the three major utilities in California.  Their conclusion is that the natural gas transportation and storage systems are adequate to provide seasonally reliable amounts of competitively priced natural gas to residential, commercial, industrial and electric generation customers.  Therefore they recommend that the Power Authority should not finance any new natural gas projects.  Other conclusions: conservation will reduce demand on the infrastructure, improved coordination between electric and gas operations can enhance reliability, and the CPUC should continue to evaluate the need for gas infrastructure expansions.  Below is the link if you would like to review the entire report.  gh

Kevin,
We have continued to make early contacts with the environmental community and some permitting agencies in Arizona to get a feel for any sensitive issues that might confront the proposed Sun Devil Project.  I think the information will be invaluable as the project is sited.  I appreciate the opportunity to be involved in the project at this stage and stand ready to provide any assistance needed as you move forward.   We will get more definitive information (especially related to the greenfield portion of the project) as we define the proposed corridor.  Why don't you catch me up on the project after your open season results start to come in.  If it looks like a "go" I would suggest that a project team be organized to plan the strategy for involvement with the environmental community, Native Americans, local government, state government, Federal agencies, the media, landowner resistance, etc.  Let me know if you need anything else.  John

She was very cordial and appreciative concerning Transwestern's proactive efforts to contact not only her office but all federal and state agencies  which may have jurisdictional lands impacted by the project.  Although the proposed route of the pipeline corridor has not been firmly established, she did  offer some general, yet valuable information concerning the geographic area which exists south of Flagstaff into roughly northern Phoenix.  

The area south of Flagstaff into Phoenix crosses of three major ecological regions identified by the TNC with major biological diversity of plants and animals.  The TNC has completed published studies on two of the regions.  The TNC has requested that should this project be apporved, these publications be used to assist in the environmental studies which will need to be completed prior to construction and approval by FERC.  To the south and east of Flagstaff is a sensitive portfolio consisting of the Verde River which is of ecologic interest due to the abundance of endangered fish and bird species which live in and around the area of the River.   This river could be impacted by the pipeline due to its meandering in a southwesterly direction across Arizona.  

I have contacted other state and federal governmental agencies, in addition to the TNC, and all parties have expressed difficulity in assessing the environmental impact of a project of this magnitude without knowing the pipeline corridor route.  Part of this concern is due to the extensive and unique biological diversity of Arizona.  I think we will have a better handle on how we address the environmental concerns and opportunities when this piece of the puzzle is completed and also how much more specific and helpful the agencies assistance will be when identified areas are known.

Kevin, as we discussed last Wednesday, following is a listing of the
issues addressed during our conversation concerning the Proposed
Transaction Between Panda and Transwestern.  I have also included some
additional questions which I thought of later.  Although I think I have
covered most of the issues, I am certain there will be more as we
continue our discussions.  As I currently understand, we are going to
try and continue our conversation on Wednesday.  Hopefully you will have
time to complete your hydraulic study and answer these questions/issues
by that time.  If you have questions concerning the following, please
feel free to contact me at (972) 361-1332 and I will try to help
clarify.

Maximum Hourly Quantity - Panda will require the minimum capability to
burn the Maximum Daily Quantity in a 16 hour period with the potential
flexibility to burn the plants complete hourly capability over a shorter
time frame.  Your voice message to Jim on Thursday, regarding a scaled
burn window based on notification timing, should address this issue. 
Although there may be instances where the actual burn will be over 24
hours, the assumption should be that under even the shortest
notification timing, 16 hours would be needed.  Something to consider
would be how to incorporate this schedule into the contract. 
Consideration would also need to be given in how this, and in general
the operations and requirements of a power plant, would potentially
deviate from the standard GISB nomination cycles and corresponding gas
flows and how to incorporate that into the contract.

Contract Rate - Although approximately $0.45/MMBtu has already been
mentioned, it should suffice to say that the lowest possible cost of our
gas supply, transportation and storage services is the goal.  There are,
however, a couple of points that could use some clarification.  First,
would the rates in the proposal be maximum rates as defined by a tariff
filing or would these be negotiated?  The current assumption is that
they are negotiated because of the increase for years 6 through 10 and
the escalator for the remaining 20 years.  The preference would be for
negotiated rates in order to eliminate any rate risk the project would
hold if they were tariff based.  If they are negotiated, a better
understanding of how the rate is broken into its various components
would be helpful.  If they are tariff based, a better understanding of
the anticipated increase and the escalator would be needed.

Fuel Rate - A better understanding of the reasoning and numbers behind
this rate would be beneficial.  Also, how does Transwestern track and
adjust for actual fuel percentages?

Delivery Term - A shorter term would be required, somewhere in the 10
to 20 year range.

Services - Although 500 psi may not be quite enough pressure at the
facility, the hydraulic study should give a better indication of the
actual pressures at the plant and should be discussed further after the
study is complete.  It should be noted that Transwestern's interconnect
with the facility could still be some distance from the plant,
therefore, increasing the pressure requirement at the interconnection
point to be greater than the plant's requirements.

Other Questions - What is the planned capacity of the lateral from
Copper Eagle to the TW/EPNG interconnect?  Would alternative receipt and
delivery combinations be charged based on the tariff commodity and fuel
for the particular path?  Since there is already alternate receipt and
delivery point capabilities, is the 50,000 MMBtu/day backhaul a
guarantee?  Although storage is planned at Copper Eagle, how can
Transwestern help manage daily imbalances and short notice start up and
shut downs in order to minimize penalty exposure?

Thanks for your help in trying to address these issues.  I look forward
to talking with you on Wednesday if not sooner.

Steve

Larry,
I have asked Bob Adams to look into the possibilities of doing something with the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation's High Schools for Habitat Program.  I am especially interested in pursuing something in Arizona with youth in the Phoenix area.  This could work into something proactive for the Sun Devil Project to utilize.  By copy of this email I am requesting that Bob Adams pursue gathering information on whether or not an initiative would work in the greater Phoenix area with this program - while he is discussing the broader application of becoming involved with this program at various locations up and down Tw's pipeline system.  Bob, please also keep Larry informed on your progress as he is responsible for putting the ETS alliance with the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation together.  Thanks again, John Shafer

Carole,

Thanks for your quick reply.  Yes, I am located in Houston, Texas where the Enron and ETS offices are located.

I appreciate the letters you attached and your advising us of your upcoming "Texas campaign."  While our corporate office is in Houston, our pipelines run from Arizona to Florida on the south end, and from Texas through the central US to eastern Montana, the Dakotas, Michigan, and Wisconsin in the north.  However, since we are new to this, maybe a focus on Texas would be a good place for us to start.  I look forward to speaking with you and ask your guidance in how to get started and where we could be of the most assistance.

Dear Bob,
    As I prepare for yet another year in the "classroom", your email could
not have come at a better time.  It delighted this old teacher's heart and
mind.  Twenty of the upperclassmen who pride themselves on doing the "upper
level" activities of the project were here over the weekend for a
campfire/hotdog roast and planning session.  They are fired up to get
started.  Their youth and enthusiasm has kept me young all these years.
Many of the kids shown in the Bugle pictures were here in my backyard.  They
will be delighted to hear that the article touched your heart.
    Yes, I lead a busy life, but I am never too busy to talk to people like
you who have the same devotion to conservation and youth.  I look forward to
speaking with you via the phone.  Students report on Tuesday for their first
day.  Tomorrow I will be getting my indoor classroom ready but I shall be
home by 4:00 PM EST. Are you located in Texas also?  This may be
coincidental since I am about to embark upon a Texas campaign, sending
information to 300 Project Wild trained high school teachers.
     I promise to call soon.  Thank you for energizing this old teacher and
sending her back to school on a positive note.  The upperclassmen do some
pretty sophisticated writing and speaking.  One of the girls who went to the
Dakotas with me in August, just answered a man's email today concerning the
donation of an item.  For the fun of it, I am attaching the answer she sent
out just today FYI along with a letter the group sent to other habitat
schools before school dismissed.  As you can tell I am very proud of these
kids!   Talk with you soon.  Yours in Conservation,  Carole Biletnikoff

Jon, I was referring to the actual monument site, not all lands dedicated to the monument by BLM, which occur for several miles on both sides of I-17.   I was under the impression that the information I had given to you and Scott indicated that the existing right of way passed throught the actual monument itself.  Sorry about the miscommunication.  In your discussions with the BLM, you may want to mention that there is an existing ROW through the Monument  and see if this makes any difference in the difficulity or delays......to cross.

Larry, based on my review of the maps that I received from you today, the
proposed Phoenix Lateral does cross approximately 8.8 miles of the Agua Fria
National Monument (i.e., Black Mesa area on the Joes Hill and Bumble Bee
USGS topographic quads). This portion of the alignment is located east of
Interstate 17. According to the Bradshaw Mountain BLM Land Status map that I
have reviewed, the national monument boundary is located immediately east of
Interstate 17.  Please let me know if you have another map that illustrates
a different alignment that is located west of Interstate 17.  Thanks!

Scott, I shold probably clearify something.  The existing right of way,
which we intend on staying in, at least around Cordes Junction is located
west of I-17, which will not impact the Agua Fria National Monument, which
occurs on the east side of the interstate.  Should we be forced to move to
the east side of I-17, then the Monument may become a problem.  Like you, I
was taking into consideration all possible issues in the pathway of the
proposed construction and also those that are in the near proximity and
have the potential of becoming an "opportunity" in the event we are forced

Subject:  RE: Review Draft  - Sundevil Fatal Flaw Analysis/Briefing Report


Gentlemen,

Attached is our work to date (minus the telephone call summary sheets and
permit requirement summary sheets [Appendix A] you've already received) on
the Fatal Flaw Analysis/Briefing Report for Project Sundevil (or is it The
Sundevil Project, or Sun Devil [2 words, rather than 1])?  It truly is a
working document, and can be expanded in areas as you see fit, or there may
be other areas you may want us to discontinue researching.  This review
draft is provided for your review and input as to where you might like it
expanded and where you might like effort to be discontinued.  As I
mentioned
yesterday, I will be out of town the remainder of the week.  Please contact
Jon Alstad in my absence with any action items and input you may have.
Thanks,  Scott

Marketing
-- Desert Crossing Storage (near Kingman, AZ).  Their strategic advantage seems to be accessing cheaper Rockies gas via Kern River and putting it into storage for later delivery to California markets.  One partner, SRP, is banking on getting a firm backhaul on El Paso to serve their Phoenix requirements.  Unless someone significantly expands the California infrastructure and interstate delivery points, the only beneficiary of this project will be Sempra with its North Baja power plant and this is not enough to justify the storage project.

--  Pataya Storage is another project soon to be announced by partners SouthWest Gas and Aquila Energy.  They plan to develop 12 Bcf of salt dome storage (in 2 phases) in the same formation as Desert Crossing.  Their plan is to tie into El Paso and TW; we have been in contact and await their response to our suggestion of incorporating a Sun Devil pipeline option.

--  Our response to APS on the transport option if they reimburse TW for EIS costs is expected to go out 1/25.  We are drafting a similar offer to Panda Energy.

--  Panda Energy:  The current economic conditions have struck Panda-- they have initiated a restructuring and severed some of the headquarters staff including fuel supply representatives we were negotiating with for Sun Devil.  The project now reverts back to the department VP whom we have contacted to further our negotiations. 

Engineering -  still waiting on the revised project cost estimate based on the reduced compressor and looping costs.  The goal is $100 million in reductions.  

FERC and El Paso Full Requirements Contracts - The discussion of the Strawman settlement proposal submitted by SRP to FERC did not make it on FERC's January agenda.  At our meeting this week, APS did not put much faith in the Strawman making much forward progress.

Ron, this is very large project.  I would recommend soliciting contributions from the team on various parts where possible.  I can provide San Juan Lateral models with correct elevation profiles used for DRA analysis and the models from SJ Junction to Flagstaff used for Redrock expansion.  Come see what I have and lets discus further.  One thing for sure, we will need to do a presentation to the team for checks and balances before submitting to Commercial.

Kevin,

Ron pointed out an error to me in my spreadsheet.  The revised one is attached.  The error was in the second case, high end cost estimate number (it was too low).  It shouldn't be material since you most likely will be using Case 1 to compare to our TW Sun Devil Project and Case 3 as a different route (Waha source) alternative.


Bryan

Ladies and Gentlemen:

In some part due to my influence, Transwestern is currently holding an 
open season to gauge the level of interest in new pipeline capacity to the 
Phoenix AZ delivery area.  I assume by now you have seen this news in 
industry press.  I encourage each of you to consider the possibility of 
alternative capacity and the advantages of not being a captive customer to 
a single pipeline company.

If you wish to speak directly with the Enron representative or would like 
to obtain more information, please feel free to call Kevin Hyatt at 
713-853-5559.

Best,
Jim

Eric and Kevin,

Attached is a preliminary timeline for working through all of the environmental related issues to deliver the necessary Resource Reports (F-1) for the FERC application.  There will be more details to be fleshed-out in the timeline, but essentially this is what we believe is strategically needed to deliver a complete exhibit.  If we can get the land managing agencies to agree to work early and collaboratively with the FERC Staff on this project, we may be able to get the FERC Staff to commit early resources to the project and cut a month or two off the tail end.  A lot of this success will be accomplished if we can get clearance to get on the land and perform the ground truthing survey work.  John

Larry, per our phone conversation tonight.  I found this article interesting, especially in light of potential future expansions on TW.  Note the section below in bold Red text.  Camp Navajo is nearly due South of Station 2 just across Interstate 40 and as you know, Kachina Village is South of Flagstaff off Interstate 15.  This may or may not pose any direct threats to TW ROW's but, it does give us a flavor of public sentiment with regards to conserving these areas.....   Anyhow, fyi...  (Oh yea, The Grand Canyon Trust & The Nature Conservancy in Flagstaff share the same office building)  



New land pegged for preservation


By ANNE MINARD
Sun Staff Reporter
07/29/2001

  |
Reader Comments

It's been less than a year since Arizona voters narrowly
rejected Proposition 100, a plan to protect 290,000
acres of State Trust Land from development.
And in about a month, voters could be asked to begin
signing petitions to get another initiative on the
ballot that would protect significantly more of the
state's legacy -- 1 million acres, or about 10 percent,
including thousands of acres in and around Flagstaff.

The difference, conservationists say, is that this land
has been chosen with the goal of protecting biologically
and aesthetically important areas. The environmental
community rallied against Prop. 100 because they said
the lands chosen for protection were insufficient and
had little value for conservation.

For example, the Proposition 100 campaign identified 10
acres of Rio De Flag in east Flagstaff -- near a
wastewater treatment plant outflow -- as one of the
state's "crown jewels" needing to be preserved.

Two other parcels in the Flagstaff area included 15
acres on Wildcat Hill with an unimpressive view of an
industrial park and 269 acres of steep slopes littered
with shot-up refrigerators and television sets called
Turkey Hills.

Rogers Lake, an important wetland and major ecosystem
south of Flagstaff, was also slated for preservation
under Prop 100. But that plan only included its soggy
lakebed, while 2,000 acres of highly developable
shoreline owned by the State Trust Land Department was
still up for grabs.

THE NEW PLAN

The new initiative would include all areas around Rogers
Lake, excluding those that are private or held by the
U.S. Forest Service. One proposed parcel does still fall
in the Turkey Hills area, and three others lie between
Flagstaff proper and Walnut Canyon (not included is
Section 20, which is likely to be sold and developed,
but at densities that are still in dispute between the
county and the city).

Other areas would include parcels around Observatory
Mesa (a contiguous chunk of land south and west of the
Naval Observatory) and a checkerboard pattern of
sections -- interspersed with Forest Service land --
south of Camp Navajo and west of Kachina Village and
Griffiths Spring.

Like Prop. 100, an initiative would be only a first
step. If it were to appear on the ballot and then pass,
it would take an act of Congress, and a constitutional
amendment, to change the availability of State Trust
Lands.

State Trust Lands include about 135 million acres across
the country -- 9.3 million in Arizona -- originally
allocated by the federal government when each state was
formed to help fund public schools. (See related story
on Page A11.)

Brad Ack, program director for the Flagstaff-based Grand
Canyon Trust who is helping spearhead the initiative,
said the state's schools shouldn't be bought and paid
for with proceeds from unmanaged sprawl. Areas set aside
under the initiative could still be leased for grazing,
agriculture or other current uses -- but they would
never be sold for commercial development.

Making an informed decision to set aside designated
State Trust Lands will free others from the battles that
now accompany proposals to develop them, he said.

The initiative is a collaborative effort between the
Grand Canyon Trust and other conservation groups, along
with some business and development affiliates.

And supporters are touting a recent poll conducted by
the Grand Canyon Trust, the Sonoran Institute in Tucson
and the Nature Conservancy that showed 88 percent of
Arizona voters agreed that some of Arizona's State Trust
Land should be conserved.

TALKING COMPENSATION

But members of the State Department of Lands charged
with managing the tracts -- and a lobbyist for
superintendents and principals in the state's school
system -- say the initiative backers are missing the
mark in the state land debate.

"We have a fundamental difference of opinion with our
friends in the environmental community," said Mike
Smith, a contract lobbyist for the Arizona School
Administrator Association. "Preserve, set aside ... we
think those are great ideas. The question is
compensation. Those State Trust Lands are in trust for
the schools. It's acutely important for schools to
maximize the returns on state lands."

Smith acknowledged that the awareness of their legacy is
new for the state's schools. Until recently, the schools
didn't see a whole lot of benefit from the state trusts.

"We haven't seen any of it. The state Legislature has
taken the annual earnings, and has used it to reduce
state aid coming out of the general fund."

That all changed with the passage of Proposition 301,
passed last year, he said.

"In addition to increasing sales tax for the schools ...
they also said, 'By the way, all new earnings from the
state trust fund go into the school site fund.' All of a
sudden, it's real different for us. Before it supplanted
our funding, now it will supplement it. It's real money
to us."

The Legislature will still keep the money it has been
earning from State Trust Lands -- about $80 million a
year. But anything above that mark will now go to the
schools, and both Smith and Nick Simonetta, manager of
communications and legislative affairs for the Arizona
Department of Lands, are optimistic that figure will
climb rapidly in the coming years. Simonetta estimates
the schools could see $650 million in addition to
legislative appropriations over the next decade.

LOOKING BACK

But the past irregularities are a stronghold for
conservationists who are promoting the land reform
initiative.

In background literature for its State Trust Land Reform
Initiative, the Grand Canyon Trust says that the State
Trust Lands haven't been used as they were intended
anyway, and very little money has gone to Arizona
schools.

"State Trust Lands currently provide less than 2 percent
of the annual funding for public education," the
document reads. "... there is little, if any, direct
benefit from State Trust Lands to our public schools."

Simonetta said he strongly disagrees with that
assessment.

"I think those statements are severely misleading and
not reflective of what is currently the case. You can
throw around percentages any way you want. If you look
at what the trust has been contributing to the school
construction budget, it's more like 30 or 40 percent."

Regardless, Simonetta and Smith agree that the future of
State Trust Land will rest on its ability to generate
funds -- and won't be given away for free.

"It comes down to this: We are in intense discussion
with the conservation community," Smith said. "Our
conversations are all around the question of
compensation. We are not going to support any initiative
that contemplates setting aside State Trust Land without
compensation. You can take that non-support as far as
you like. If they attempt to go to Congress, we are
going with them."

Station 1 on TW is about 30 miles east of Kingman, Arizona and is within 1000 ft of a 69kv and a 220(?) kv power line and substation.  My understanding is that the High voltage line goes to Ca.
 
The unit is an LM2500 + iso rated at 41,000 HP and site rated at somewhere about 27,000 at 95 deg F

Arnold, 

Really enjoyed meeting you last week. 

When I got back to the office today I was  informed that the CA Power Authority has issued us an LOI for a power purchase agreement of up to 6 MW for a WHRS project using gas pipeline station waste heat.  The PPA is quite viable. In the info given to me last year by Chris Hilgert I noticed that TW Station 1 is very close to a transmission line.  Does this line go into CA?  If so can we discuss using the LM2500 waste heat?  Ormat can either build ourself or let you.  Please let me know ASAP.  I need to get back to the PA.  Thanks.

I just spoke with Curt Brechtel from APS this morning.  I had called him last week asking for feedback related to our latest Sun Devil offer to them.  He reviewed our offer with Tom Carlson.  Tom has 2 issues (listed by priority):

1) Enron credit rating and where the pipelines stand with the current financial situation.

	Do we have a timeline wherein the pipes (specifically TW) will have its own credit rating?

2) Full requirements contract settlement at FERC

	APS still has no idea where this process will lead as far as their volume requirements are concerned.  APS is still comfortable committing 100,000 MMBtu/d to Sun Devil, but likely not the 200,000 we asked for (though 100,000 with an option to increase is a possibility).

Gents - it looks like we need to get the negotiating team back together!  it has been a few months so now it is time to negotiatiate for looping of the san juan lateral,(maybe some more mainline ??) and the standing rock C/S.  

Johnny/Larry - can you get in contact with Doug Cebryk/Ron Matthews/Dennis Alters on route and ROW cost estimates???

Call Joanna Scruggs 602-417-9300

ask for the overlay statewide digital index map ($18.50).  They recently updated it to 1996 vintage.  The scale is 1:750,000.  From this map you can order the 1:100,000 scale BLM maps ($4 each).  Checks can be sent to:

Arizona Public Land Information Center
222 North Central Ave.
Suite 101
Phoenix, AZ  85004

I don't know if they take credit cards, but if they do, it might speed up processing.  You may just want to order the big scale map and all the smaller ones and save some time.

regards,
kh

Kevin:

Sorry it has taken so long to get back to you on this.  I have been knee deep on the TW/NNG pipeline financings for the past 4 weeks.  I have sent a note to ENE's Bank relationship officer to get the names of the Citi and SocGen folks who would have worked on this. When I get the names, I will do some digging for you and Eric.

Kevin--
	As we discussed yesterday, Panda Energy International, Inc. and TECO Energy, Inc. (Tampa Electric) have formed a partnership to build, own, and operate a 2300 Mw gas-fired electric generation plant located in Maricopa County, Arizona, southwest of Phoenix.  The partnership may be called "Panda Gila River L.P."

Here are some of the details as we know them:
	All building/ air permits received, construction has commenced
	Financing closed 6/04/01 (oversubscribed by 56%)
	$2.2 bn loan ($1.7bn 5 yr. bullet loan and $500mm equity bridge)
	Financing led by Citibank and Societe Generale
	50% of power output sold under long term contracts, 50% on spot market

What we want to know is:
	How did the banks get comfortable on the financing if only 25% of the gas pipeline transport capacity is under contract? (And right now there is only one pipeline capable of serving the plant's needs)
How did the banks get comfortable with only 50% of the power output sold under long term contracts?

What happens after the bullet loan comes due-- are the operators taking interest rate risk and hoping to refinance at a lower rate in year 5?

Any information you can provide on the above would be very helpful.  We are scheduled to meet with Panda in Dallas on Tuesday 11/6.
thanks for the help.

Hi Steve and Bob, Happy New Year!!

Steve, based on our meeting in Houston, I met with our engineering and operations folks to discuss the possibility of putting together a new firm (or limited firm) Park N Ride storage service on the pipeline project.  Everyone agreed it is likely doable under certain conditions not the least of which is FERC approval.  The question I have for you is: how much volume and for how long a period?

For example, on any given day, assuming there is no Copper Eagle storage available, it will likely be easier to borrow (ride) gas off the system than to park gas on it.  I think this was your greater concern.  

In your ideal world, how much volume would you like to be able to pull off Sun Devil say if your MDQ was 100,000?  Would you want an additional 25,000/day, more or less? and for how long?  Also, how much would you want to Park on the system and for how long?  For purposes of evaluation, assume the cost would be significantly less than a storage option.

If you give me some parameters, we will build a service offering that meets your needs as close as possible.  

I will be out of the office on Friday 1/4 but look forward to hearing from you early next week.

Best Regards,
Kevin Hyatt

As we discussed today, since we don't know anymore today than we did when we made the original estimate, you can assume this is still a good estimate to take it to FERC application stage.

	We are working up a proposal for APS in Phoenix wherein they would share in a portion of the costs we incur to get the project's FERC application ready.  Tab 5 of the original cost book shows a cost of $8,750,301.  Is this still a good number to use for our APS proposal?  Let's talk Wed 1/23 if possible.

Instead of being specific about the route, I will communicate that we are studying alternative routes and it's premature to communicate which route the pipeline might take.  We will consider community and environmental input to determine the pipeline route.

As an FYI - To release any information to the public at this early stage related to a proposed corridor (prior to making personal contact with key environmental groups, key agencies and political types) would be premature and offer opportunities for groups or individual landowners to polarize and organize opposition against Sun Devil.  We have found that in most cases the environmental community is very negative towards a new project if they are called for a quote from the media prior to having a heads-up on the project from the project sponsor.  We are setting a strategy to accomplish this and roll out the project in the best way.  John

Kevin
Please advise how critical it is that the Cost Estimate be split by project components, specifically:
1. San Juan Lateral - 97 mi.
2. TW Mainline Loop- 225 mi 
3. Phoenix Lateral - 135 mi
4. Panda Extension- 35 mi
5. Associated Compression

We can estimate these components for pipe(material) costs and construction costs quite easily, based on our field recon and info we have obtained from existing alignment sheets and other data.
The difficulty comes in assessing the "soft costs" - i.e. Project Managment, Engineering,Environmental,Regulatory, Construction Mangement, and to some degree ROW on a project component basis. 
If you really need on a component basis, the best we can do( and it may be misleading) is to calculate the total costs and then prorate based on lengths and/or HP..
Please advise as soon as you can.
Thanks

Sorry I left the above out of the first email.  Attached is the latest and greatest taken from Winflow.  There is a possibility of elimianting Bloomfield unit #5 but don't have time to consider now.  Time crunch!  Will look at later.  If this flies as is then any cost cut later is gravy.  Will run a transient later to look at swings.

Keep this in your hip pocket for the time being - - - when we get a little further down the road (eg, after 1Q01 filing with FERC) let's revisit and discuss with the team.

This might be something we look into further as Sun Devil moves forward.  It would be cool to post the progress of the project on the website.

Marketing

--  Red Lake / (Pataya) Storage  - per the press release, Aquila has purchased 100% of this project being developed by SouthWest Gas.  The proposed 12 Bcf facility, located 30 miles north of Kingman, Arizona near the terminus of TW, will begin its open season the week Feb. 4.  They anticipate tying into both TW and El Paso.  We are exploring options with Aquila to tie in the Sun Devil project plus a new compressor at Kingman, AZ.  The compressor will help Aquila buck TW's line pressure plus facilitate pressure requirements at the California border for TW.

--  Drafting new marketing proposals to both APS and Panda based on the lowered facility costs.  


Engineering -  New facility costs are estimated at $831 million and include an additional lateral to serve the APS Red Hawk plant.  Capacity to Phoenix will be 750,000 MMBtu/d with only 30,000/d available for Cal Border.  This is a $100 million improvement versus our original scenario.  The improvements are based on reduced pipe looping to serve Cal Border plus reduced or eliminated compressor stations.  The benefit is reflected in a lower initial capital cost plus lower annual operating expenses.  Rates to Phoenix are estimated at $0.45/MMBtu on a 20 year term with a project salvage value of less than $200mm at the end of the initial term.

Met with Mike Smith and Arnold Eisenstein this AM.  One problem I see is that the mileages and the capital in the presentation don't match.  The $822 mm seems to match a case with 175 miles of mainline rather than 239.

Arnold and Ron Matthews had already tentatively scheduled a get-together tomorrow to work on optimization and to get the facilities and the estimates on the same page.

Mike Smith mentioned that looks like the Indian ROW renewal will cost about $80mm in todays dollars, $40mm in ten years, remainder in 20.  Not sure what a reasonable escalator is to use for reservations.

Regarding Bush' tarriff.  I would not assume that there is enuf contingency and escalation to cover the increase.  The escalation is there to cover normal inflation of material and construction costs and the contingency is there to cover the incompleteness in scoping at the time of the estimate preparation.  (Rand Corp some years back did an extensive study of estimates ex contingency versus final costs and confirmed that primarily due to insufficient scoping details, a seemingly large level of contingency was required to cover the actual costs.   When a project is a gleam in someone's eye, probably need 25%, by the time you are starting construction - maybe 5%.)

Also James C. sent me a copy of his baseline model.  I have a relatively quick and dirty model I use for preliminary analyses and for roughly the same assumptions we ended up in about the same place - about 5.5% IRR on equity. Bear in mind that this included no increases in volumes over time, no incremental Row payments and no payoff at the end of 20 years.  

Another point.  Will you really be able to sell the 540 at 45 cents (plus a bush tarriff kicker) 100% 365 days a year?

That's all for now.  Have a surprise 1 o'clock with Horton.

COMMISSION APPROVES BOWIE POWER PROJECT  Requires Use of Solor Technology &=
 Groundwater Monitoring Program=09
PHOENIX - In a decision yesterday, the Arizona Corporation Commission appro=
ved the Bowie Power Station proposed for eastern Cochise County in southeas=
tern Arizona. The project, to be constructed in two 500-megawatt phases, is=
 a water-cooled power plant using a maximum of 6,000 acre-feet of groundwat=
er per year when both units are operating continuously at full output. Sout=
hWestern Power Group II is the project developer. The approval requires Sou=
thWestern to install solar technology when they begin building the second p=
ower block. This is the first merchant power plant that is required to inco=
rporate solar technology as a core part of the total project. Merchant powe=
r plants supply power to the wholesale market as opposed to power plants bu=
ilt by a utility with the primary objective of serving its own customers. D=
uring Tuesday's meeting, the Commission accepted the 22 restrictions placed=
 on the project by the Arizona Power Plant and Transmission Line Siting Com=
mittee. After hearing from several representatives of the Bowie and Willcox=
 communities, the Commissioners approved an amendment offered by Commission=
er Spitzer. The Spitzer amendment specifically addresses concerns by nearby=
 pistachio farmers that groundwater pumping could affect the surrounding wa=
ter table. Summary of the Spitzer Amendment: The amendment requires SouthWe=
stern Power Group II to establish and pay for a groundwater monitoring prog=
ram that meets Arizona Department of Water Resources criteria. Once the pro=
ject is operating, the SouthWestern will have to establish and make annual =
contributions of $100,000 to a Groundwater Impact Mitigation Fund until the=
 fund reaches a balance of $500,000. Any business or individual who can pro=
ve, through successful arbitration, that groundwater pumping has caused pro=
perty or economic damage will be able to submit a claim for reimbursement. =
SouthWestern will be required to maintain a total balance of $500,000 in th=
e fund. Status reports on the program are to be filed with the Town of Bowi=
e, the Pistachio Pass Irrigation District and the Cochise County Board of S=
upervisors. The Groundwater Impact Mitigation Fund must be maintained for t=
hree years after the plant ceases operation and is decommissioned. Commissi=
oner Marc Spitzer said the amendment was prudent considering that the lasti=
ng impact of the power project. "I proposed this amendment to answer the co=
ncerns of the pistachio farmers and the irrigation district," Commissioner =
Marc Spitzer said. "Although we heard testimony that the power plant's grou=
ndwater needs would be less than if the land were farmed, I don't think you=
 can be too careful. We're making decisions that could affect an economical=
ly depressed area for generations to come." Other Environmental Conditions:=
 Twenty-two conditions were imposed by the Arizona Power Plant and Transmis=
sion Line Siting Committee. They include: ? Establishment of a monitoring p=
roject and mitigation fund for ground subsidence and earth fissure monitori=
ng. Subsidence is a potential side effect of groundwater pumping. Cracks, f=
issures or dips can form in the surface of the earth because the water deep=
 underground that provided physical support is no longer there. ? Contribut=
ions to the Bowie Fire District to enable it to acquire an additional emerg=
ency services vehicle as well as funding of emergency response and hazardou=
s materials training for firefighters. ? Making arrangements with local law=
 enforcement and the Cochise County Sheriff because the project will involv=
e an increase in traffic and may result in the need for emergency responses=
 by local law enforcement. This was an amendment sponsored by Commissioner =
Jim Irvin. ? Prior to construction of the facility, SouthWestern must provi=
de the Commission with a technical study showing that sufficient transmissi=
on capacity exists to accommodate the output of the plant and the effect of=
 its output on reliable operation of the electric grid. ? Conditions requir=
ing compliance with air and water quality standards imposed by the Arizona =
Department of Environmental Quality and the Arizona Department of Water Res=
ources. Additionally, the applicant will have to participate in and comply =
with all standards for safe, reliable power delivery. "I was pleased to sup=
port this project, in part because it includes solar technology as a key co=
mponent of the whole project. The level of support from the local community=
 was also impressive. Les Thompson, Chairman of the Cochise County Board of=
 Supervisors indicated that Bowie has one of the highest tax rates of any A=
rizona community," Chairman Bill Mundell explained. "The residents and busi=
ness people were very excited about the tax and economic development benefi=
ts of having the power plant in their community. Additionally, the project =
will bring several hundred construction jobs to Bowie and Willcox and, ulti=
mately, the 30 or 40 people needed to run the plant." Commissioner Irvin vo=
ted in favor of the project, saying: "I do believe the need for this projec=
t was established in the record. Further, I believe the project is in the p=
ublic interest and meets the balancing test." He was referring to the sitin=
g statute that requires the Commission "to balance, in the broad public int=
erest, the need for an adequate, economical and reliable supply of electric=
 power with the desire to minimize the effect thereof on the environment an=
d ecology of this state." (Arizona Revised Statutes ? 40-360.07, subsection=
 B.) For more information about recent power plant sitings, visit the Arizo=
na Corporation Commission's website at <http://www.cc.state.az.us/news/inde=

I am out west the rest of this week and have some commitments for the

until the end of the month and you needed that to gauge the interest in your

Gentlemen,

Attached is our work to date (minus the telephone call summary sheets and
permit requirement summary sheets [Appendix A] you've already received) on
the Fatal Flaw Analysis/Briefing Report for Project Sundevil (or is it The
Sundevil Project, or Sun Devil [2 words, rather than 1])?  It truly is a
working document, and can be expanded in areas as you see fit, or there may
be other areas you may want us to discontinue researching.  This review
draft is provided for your review and input as to where you might like it
expanded and where you might like effort to be discontinued.  As I mentioned
yesterday, I will be out of town the remainder of the week.  Please contact
Jon Alstad in my absence with any action items and input you may have.
Thanks,  Scott

This company is pushing digital and space imagery for pipeline aerial photography.  May be worth investigating as this is likely where we are headed in the near future and in fact, may be a more 'efficient' product now for some projects.
 
Based on the moving of technology toward digitally interfaced mapping, if we have knowledgeable people available, this might be a good investment.
For Phase VI aerial photography, we checked this out and found:
    The turn around time for aerial digital photography was much, much better than for film photography.
    Costs seem to be lower although not of significant magnitude.
    Overlay onto drawing system files would be much easier & faster especially if system is laid out in this format - which I understand Enron is headed towards.
    Shortcoming was the fine detail or ROW objects - telephone pole shadows, etc. that show up on film but not on current digital technology.
 
For Phase VI, we wound up sticking with film to be sure we got what we needed.  We did not have time to do it twice and there was risk plus it seemed sure we would eventually have to do the film later for the detail. 
These shortcomings will probably go away in the next generation of digital cameras.  In addition, in a short FERC filing deadline, these details do not appear necessary for FERC, only for later detail engineering design.  I do not know time constraints if any, but Doug might consider for Sun Devil.

Phil:
 
Thank you very much for taking the time out of your schedule to meet with me and my colleagues concerning mapping, information technology, and imagery.  I am getting in contact with Mike Crump to discuss the logistics of a demonstration project for the Minnesota area.
 
As I mentioned to you, we will be at the GITA GIS for Oil and Gas Conference demonstrating our "e-maps" internet delivery solution.  Conference dates are September 17, 18 and 19th at the JW Marriott Hotel by the Galleria (713) 961-1500.  We would like to meet as many Enron folks as possible at this meeting, so it you would be kind enough to circulate this email to the appropriate individuals.  They may call me at 407-718-3880 for trade show times or arrange for a hands on demonstration.
 
Thank you again for your time and I look forward to working with you in the future.

Larry,
Please proceed with all haste on this.  How long to complete them and submit the findings (can't believe there would be anything turn up).  No endangered plants in any of those station yards - I trust?  The EPA is reaching here, but they have the big stick and we must work through this to get the air permit.  This is a lesson's learned for the upcoming Sun Devil project.  John

The issue arose when the EPA in San Francisco said they would not issue an air permit unless we had addressed all concerns relevant to the endangered species act, even on distsurbed lands at stations 3 and 4.  Even though we had received a verbal approval formt he Navajo Nation that endangered species would not be a concern by the Nation, the EPA felt otherwise.  This means that they wont give us a permit until we do a survey for plants and animals.  Because ENSR was on the list of contractors approved by the Navajo Nation, they were given the opportunity.  As you know, I have been working with Scott Patti on this and we have worked it through.  All that is left is to get the ENSR renewal permit application approved by the Nation and ENSR is off and running to do the surveys.  Terry, I know that you know all this, I just wanted to keep John and Bill in the loop on how things are progressing......

Larry,

I understand from Scott Patti that the EPA has thrown a monkey wrench into
the air permitting process for stations 3 and 4 and are now requesting
endangered species surveys.  For simplicity, we will add this as a new task
for the Red Rock Expansion project.  The FT. Collins folks are proceeding
based on your verbal go ahead, but to make our accountants happy, I will
have to get something written authorizing the additional work.  Scott is
estimating the task to cost approximately $7,000.  Since I am listed as the
project manager on paper, I will put together a brief letter and get it to
you this week.  However, please continue to directly coordinate with Scott
and he will keep me apprised of the status.

Thanks,

Terry.

Attached is a Powerpoint slide showing the differences between the Planning's Level and Engineering's Level A+.  Planning's Level A was update to include the current project scope uncovered through Engineering's investigation of the pipeline route and compressor stations.  Planning's estimated costs based on current facilities is around 21% of the Level A+ costs.  Normalizing the Level A brings the costs within 2% of the Engineering Level A+ estimate.

We have performed an initial review of the proposed shippers ( highlighted ) and indicated our findings on the Credit Rankings Section. This review was of a general nature due to an absence of either price or volume. The following are the explanations of the comments:

OK - This customer has an acceptable S & P rating.

Need F. S. - We would need updated financial information in order to provide an opinion.

Amend - An amendment to an existing guaranty would be needed.

OK????? - The approval would be based upon the volume requested and the financial position.

After reviewing, give me a call and we can discuss further.

Regards.

Doug,
No, its not unclear.  You are misinterpreting the instructions I was passing along to ENSR.  As a basic premise of dealing with consultants, one has to understand that they will spend time doing whatever you ask them to do (i.e., prepare a budget for tasks from beginning to an FERC filing or prepare a budget for tasks to take us from beginning to post construction).  Either way, you have to pay for what you ask them to do.  Therefore, you keep the marching orders as simple as possible, taking the process in steps.  In this way you eliminate superfluous tasks that are not essential at the moment.   Sometimes these projects start out like "gangbusters," but for commercial reasons or some other reason, they go away and you could be left paying for a task that basically has no added value.  I have found it best not to go that route.  

In this instant case, I had broken down my instructions to ENSR so as to minimize their expenditures and even though from your perspective "ETS has been responsible for preparing a Level B estimate for Sun Devil since day one", the consultant need only know and respond to the task at hand - which is the way I have handled it.  That is why I worded my note the way I did.  It is not a "new" request, but a continuation of one that he has already started.   By working it this way, you only pay for what you need and for what you get - not for an all encompassing budget that may never materialize.

I am surprised that you interpret this is a new request.

What I would like your group to do is come up with a cost estimate for all work related to the environmentsl aspect of the project from today through to completion of the project. i.e a Jan, 2004 in service date
Timewise, I would lime a first pass estimate by Sept 21, a second pass estimate by Sept 26, and the final complete estimate by Sept 28
Please call me if unclear and so that we can discuss.

Larry and Scott,
Doug Cebryk, Project Manager for the Sun Devil Project has requested that we furnish a more complete cost estimate (Level B) which would take the Environmental costs through the post construction phase.  Another words, take the budget you have furnished which was through the FERC filing phase and extrapolate additional environmental costs for processing the filing, obtaining the permits, environmental third party inspecting costs during construction and mitigation.  That must be given to Doug Cebryk by COB on Friday, September 21.  This will include all air permit costs.  If you have any questions, please give me a call.  John

Rob,

I need your expert advice before conducting further negotiations with Kinder Morgan (KM).  As you may be aware, the Sun Devil project parallels the Transwestern (TW) system to Flagstaff, AZ and will then turn south and parallel a El Paso lateral into Phoenix.  KM has made a proposal to provide services to TW under a "lease transaction" for that portion of the pipeline from San Juan, NM to Flagstaff.  The KM proposal offers two obvious advantages: i)  It would allow TW to lower its capital cost to construct the total system, and ii) It would lower the fuel allocated to Sun Devil by TW. There also may be ways to further reduce the tariff proposed to Sun Devil by KM, if TW can provide some of the operations and administration services for KM.

We have been negotiating with Shippers for a fee that would yield a minimum rate of return based upon our proposal to build and own the entire system.  However, the KM proposal could allow us an opportunity to save on fuel, operating, administrative and capital costs, thus possibly achieving better project returns, if TW is able to capture revenues from these savings. We would like to explore assessing the Sun Devil Shippers an allocated fuel rate and other fees commensurate with TW's current rate structure.  Will FERC regulations permit us to do these things?  Should the Sun Devil Pipeline be part of TW or should it be under some other corporate structure to capture revenues?  Does the lease transaction give TW an accounting or tax benefit?

I have attached the KM proposal for your perusal.  Please keep it confidential.

Thank you for your help.

Steve

Danny,

Today, Kevin and I met with Scott Parker (KMI), Ron Brown (KMI), and Chad D=
riscoll (Calpine) to discuss possibilities of bundling Kinder Morgan's Sono=
ran project with Sun Devil.  A summary of our discussions is outlined below=
.

Concept

Explore the possibility of combining the Sun Devil and Sonoran Pipeline pro=
jects into a single venture along the existing Transwestern route from San =
Juan to the California Border.  Progress separate projects for service to P=
hoenix (Sun Devil) and California (Sonoran).

Rationale

Lower costs, higher margins
Greater capacity, economic scale, expansion options
Reduced stakeholder interventions (Navajos, environmental interests groups,=
 shippers)
Reduced regulatory process

Background

On May 2, 2001, Kinder Morgan and Calpine announced plans to jointly develo=
p the Sonoran Pipeline, subject to customary approvals and sufficient inter=
est by potential shippers.  As proposed, the Sonoran pipeline will be a 1,1=
60 mile high pressure interstate natural gas pipeline from the San Juan Bas=
in in northern New Mexico to markets in California.  The project, with an e=
stimated cost of $1.8 billion, will provide natural gas transportation capa=
city to California to serve growing electric generation demand. =20

The proposed pipeline will be evaluated and developed in two phases.  The f=
irst phase will run from the San Juan Basin to the California border with t=
he second phase extending from the California border to the San Francisco B=
ay area. =20

The first phase of the pipeline is expected to be completed in the summer o=
f 2003.  Phase one will consist of a 460 mile, 36 inch diameter pipeline fr=
om the interconnection of TransColorado Gas Transmission and Transwestern P=
ipeline to various points at the Blanco Hub in San Juan, NM.  In addition, =
the pipeline will continue westward with deliveries into the California/Ari=
zona border.  A 20 mile, 24 inch diameter lateral would be built to Topock,=
 AZ.  The initial capacity would start with 750,000 dth/d, with capability =
to expand to 1 million dth/day.  The estimated cost of phase one is $624 wi=
th a targeted in-service date of summer 2003.  Sponsors said the open seaso=
n will seek at a minimum, 20-year term commitments at a fixed transport rat=
e of $0.39/dth for firm transportation.  Sonoran proposes to charge shipper=
s actual fuel on phase one via a fuel tracker.  Fuel is estimated at 1.3%. =
 More than 1 billion cubic feet per day of binding agreements and non-bindi=
ng expressions of interest were received for the first phase of the project=
. =20

Phase two will be a 590 mile, 42 inch diameter pipeline from Needles on the=
 California border to points within California, terminating near Antioch in=
 Contra Costa County.  Once completed, the pipeline will be able to transpo=
rt between 1 million and 1.5 million dth/day.  The in-service date for the =
phase two has yet to be determined.  The cost is projected to be $1.1 billi=
on.   Another 1.5 Bcf/d of non-binding commitments and expressions of inter=
est were received for phase two. =20

Sonoran has already received binding bids from Calpine Energy Services for =
400,000 dth/d for phase one and another 500,000 dth/d for its phase two. On=
ce completed, the new pipeline could connect with Kern River, Mojave, Elk H=
ills, Pacific Gas and Electric, Southern California Gas and various gas-fir=
ed power plants. =20

SoCalGas's Residual Load Service (RLS) penalty woull not affect the Sonoran=
 project because the pipeline route parallels PG&E's pipelines and the prim=
ary target load is new gas-fired generation not within SoCalGas's market te=
rritory.=20

The pipeline also will connect to a new underground storage facility near L=
odi being developed by Lodi Gas Storage, Inc., a subsidiary of Houston base=
d Western Hub Properties LLC. =20

The project could have a noteworthy co-owner: the Navajo Nation, the sovere=
ign government of 180,000 residents on the largest Indian reservation withi=
n the United States.  An agreement in principle to give the Navajos an owne=
rship interest in the $1.7 billion pipeline that crosses their reservation =
was disclosed in August by an executive of Kinder Morgan at Indian Energy 2=
001, a conference of the Council of Energy Resource Tribes that highlighted=
 the growing role Indian tribes play in powering the West.  As part of the =
deal to secure that right of way, the Navajo Nation would invest in the pro=
ject and receive a minority interest when the pipeline opens.  The deal wou=
ld be structured to limit the tribe's exposure to risks during the construc=
tion phase of the project.  Gas from the pipeline could also fuel a propose=
d Navajo-owned power plant on the reservation.  Red Cedar Gas Gathering, wh=
ich is jointly owned by the Southern Ute Indian Tribe and Kinder Morgan mad=
e arrangements with the Navajo Indians.

Kinder Morgan is not interested in expanding the equity participants in the=
 Sonoran Pipeline.

Next steps

Kinder Morgan to evaluate providing facilities to serve TW open season mark=
ets (SJ, Phoenix, California) along proposed Sonoran Pipeline route and com=
e back to ETS with a proposal (operating lease, undivided interest, no ship=
per contractual arrangements).=20
ETS to identify risks and mitigants associated with Sonoran Pipeline projec=
t=20
- Interference with existing TW pipeline operations during construction and=
 on-going operations
- Use of TW r-o-w
- Other

Kevin,

Here are some numbers for you to look at.  I worked up three cases, one looking at a San Juan route, and two others looking at El Paso's Line 2000.  The first Line 2000 case assumed that the line was empty and could be dedicated to this project, which is probably not realistic.  But another way to look at this is it would be very easy for El Paso to incrementally build out capacity on Line 2000 to serve new Phoenix loads.  

 The second Line 2000 case (third case overall) assumed that there was already 320 mmscfd of capacity used up, and that 450 mmscfd of capacity for Phoenix markets would be layered on top of that.   This is very close to, or at, the maximum capabilities of this line without loop.  I also gave a range of costs based on some variability in the lay costs for pipe and purchase costs of new horsepower.  

I'll be in Houston working on a task force in 3 Allen from Tuesday to Friday, 9/4-9/7.  Leave me a message or beep me and we can talk about this some more.  Ron,  I'd like to hear your opinion on these.  I'm attaching the final model for you to look at.

John
I apologize for the tone of my e-mail, but hope you agree that from your e-mail, it could be interpreted that at the last minute, I was asking for a new,comprehensive cost estimate- i.e. Level B for the entire project. This is, and always was our mission to provide a full and complete cost estimate for the project.
I really don't need a lesson in how to deal with contractors, and fully realize they will do whatever is asked of them, since they are being paid on a time basis.
The task of getting ENSR to do a complete cost estimate of all environmental work related to the execution of the project is a vital and important component of the total project cost estimate. Whether the project proceeds or not is highly dependent on the economics of the project, and therfore, getting ENSR to define the work and estimate the associated costs cannot be considered as a wasted task that has no value. We do need an estimate of the all encompassing budget, and then as a complete analysis is done, decide whether to proceed with any or all parts of the defined scope.
I look forward to  putting this misunderstanding behind us and work together in a co-ordinated effort to complete the task at hand (getting as good a cost estimate as we can) and see if this project is economically feasible

Thank You.

Doug,
No, its not unclear.  You are misinterpreting the instructions I was passing along to ENSR.  As a basic premise of dealing with consultants, one has to understand that they will spend time doing whatever you ask them to do (i.e., prepare a budget for tasks from beginning to an FERC filing or prepare a budget for tasks to take us from beginning to post construction).  Either way, you have to pay for what you ask them to do.  Therefore, you keep the marching orders as simple as possible, taking the process in steps.  In this way you eliminate superfluous tasks that are not essential at the moment.   Sometimes these projects start out like "gangbusters," but for commercial reasons or some other reason, they go away and you could be left paying for a task that basically has no added value.  I have found it best not to go that route.  

In this instant case, I had broken down my instructions to ENSR so as to minimize their expenditures and even though from your perspective "ETS has been responsible for preparing a Level B estimate for Sun Devil since day one", the consultant need only know and respond to the task at hand - which is the way I have handled it.  That is why I worded my note the way I did.  It is not a "new" request, but a continuation of one that he has already started.   By working it this way, you only pay for what you need and for what you get - not for an all encompassing budget that may never materialize.

I am surprised that you interpret this is a new request.
>From day 1, ETS has been responsible for preparing a Level B estimate for the Sun Devil project.
What I would like your group to do is come up with a cost estimate for all work related to the environmentsl aspect of the project from today through to completion of the project. i.e a Jan, 2004 in service date
Timewise, I would lime a first pass estimate by Sept 21, a second pass estimate by Sept 26, and the final complete estimate by Sept 28
Please call me if unclear and so that we can discuss.
Thanks

Larry and Scott,
Doug Cebryk, Project Manager for the Sun Devil Project has requested that we furnish a more complete cost estimate (Level B) which would take the Environmental costs through the post construction phase.  Another words, take the budget you have furnished which was through the FERC filing phase and extrapolate additional environmental costs for processing the filing, obtaining the permits, environmental third party inspecting costs during construction and mitigation.  That must be given to Doug Cebryk by COB on Friday, September 21.  This will include all air permit costs.  If you have any questions, please give me a call.  John

Kevin, I apologize for not getting back to you sooner as I have been out of=
 touch for the last week.  I read John's message to you and agree with him =
that we should develop a formal plan to address how we will generate public=
 support and address any future environmental concerns before they jump up =
and bite us.  As you may know, Flagstaff is one of those areas where there =
is much environmental support to keep the area as pristine as possible and =
there does exist a number of environmental groups which use this as their a=
genda to keep development to a minimum.  I will forward to you a memo from =
David Roensch, team advisor in the Flagstaff area, of an article he found p=
roviding the active participation of the environmental groups in the Flagst=
aff area.  Ive done some cusory inquiries as to land status and have polled=
 the Bureau of Land Management, State of Arizona,  State Historic Preservat=
ion Office and the Forest Service which is the major landowner between Flag=
staff and Phoenix.  I have not heard back from all of agencies as yet, but =
will let you know if there are any glaring environmental concerns or if the=
re  appears to be trouble on the horizon.   John and I have briefly traded =
thoughts on this project and we would  like to take a more proactive approa=
ch  "up front" with regard to public participation and input prior to break=
ing ground.  Its hard to deal with public issues when construction is under=
way.=20

As for the $$$$$ for the environmental studies, you are correct in assuming=
 that the existing portion of the project from Bloomfield to Flagstaff will=
 require very little capital, as long as we limit and ensure our constructi=
on activities to the existing right of way.  Proceeding south from Flagstaf=
f to Phoenix is where the initial expenditures will be the greatest.  Once =
the pipeline corridor is identified and staked, surveys will need to be com=
pleted for the following:   threatened and endangered plants and animals, a=
rcheology surveys for bones, artifacts, relics etc, noise surveys should th=
is portion of the project require installation of horsepower.  The FERC wil=
l require an EIS (environmental impact statement) and environmental report =
to be conducted.  These activities include not only the environemntal issue=
s but also things like socioeconomics, land use soils, geology etc.  Past c=
onsttruction projects has shown that third party involvement with this grea=
tly expidites the process (John has eluded to this previously).  Due to the=
 rough terrain and topography of the land south of Station 2 into Phoenix m=
akes this project extremely hard to give an approximate dollar amount  for =
the environmental baseline surveys and permits to be completed as the entir=
e proposed right of way (140 miles) from station 2 into Phoenix will need t=
o be walked and surveyed by several people.  I would rather wait until we c=
an identify on a map the corridor route and send out proposals for each of =
the surveys to be performed on the pipeline prior to giving a $$$$ figure. =
  However, because you need something for a preliminary budget estimate, I =
would recommend an amount of $70,000 to 90,000  for the baseline environmen=
tal work and this might be a little light, in the event the surveys identif=
y something.......please dont hold me too close to this number as it is a W=
AG contingent upon a number of variables that are relatively unclear at thi=
s time.  Having the pipeline corridor identified on a map will greatly assi=
st in the environmental budgeting for this project.

Quick thought - - - 

We need to add a "pressure guarantee" as a condition of service.  This has been discussed with both PW and Panda and needs to be explicit in the term sheet.

Gentlemen,

As we discussed in our meeting last week, attached is a proposal from ENSR to complete a desk top review which will identify scoping issues, summarizing permitting requirements, siting constraints, and routing issues (including NGO's, Native American issues, landowner activist groups, etc.).  ENSR will furnish their findings in a report which will include a map review and fatal flaw analysis.  The report can be completed within three weeks of the notice for ENSR to proceed and will cost approximately $8,500.  I would propose that we place a "not to exceed" requirement on the cost and basically tell ENSR that we expect them to produce the work product for that sum.  This report will greatly assist us in developing a successful environmental strategy for this major project.  Under separate cover I will submitting to Steve Veatch a prospective time line for the completion of the "Resource Reports" to meet the F-I filing requirements.  

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will wait on your approval before releasing ENSR to proceed.  John Shafer

Attached is a revised scope which basically includes the majority of the expansion volume to Phoenix.  Only 30 MMcf/d goes west of Station #2 while 500 MMcf/d goes to Phoenix.  The cost numbers shown in the spreadsheet are Planning's order of magnitude numbers only and do not reflect in any way what Engineering will provide.  THIS IS A REQUEST for Engineering to provide details cost for the attached scope.  Once completed, please forward to me to be presented to Asset Management (Kevin Hyatt).

Attached is an Excel spreadsheet showing horsepower requirements and fuel use for a variety of scenarios.  One sheet swings the mainline flow west and the second sheet swings the Sun Devil flow.  To keep both sheets consistent, the volume reduction in any case was 124 MMcf/d per 10% which is based on Red Rock fully loaded with all for stations modified.

Let me know if you have any questions.

To All
I have done a cursory review of the requirements of the agencies contacted, and 2 significant itmes leap out.

#1 New Mexico BLM Permitting - Cultural Resources
David Simmons - Archeologist - Farmington BLM office quoted " Navajo ROW costs usually approximately $1MM/mile". THIS COULD MAKE AN UNECONOMICAL PROJECT FROM DAY 1

#2 Longest permit times are 1 year, which means that with a tentative schedule as follows:
FERC Filing - Sept/01 to March 30/02
FERC Approval - April 1/02 - April 1/03 - 1 year
Construction - April 1/03 - Jan 1/04 - 9 mos 

In order to start construction by April 1/03 to achieve an in service in early 2004, application for specific long lead permits will need to be made April 1/02. This will require significant field work and design details prior to April 1/02. I doubt we will be ready to commit to such an undertaking this early in the process.

I suggest after the ENSR fatal flaw analysis is complete, a very comprehensive review of all permits and their relation to the critical path is undertaken.

We have already been in contact primarily with most of the state and
Federal
level agencies that exist in both AZ and NM as well as the Navajo
agencies.
I could get you a complete list of agencies we've contacted if you'd
like,
but almost every agency that would or could issue a permit in both
states
has been contacted.

Scott,
Please furnish a list of who you will be talking with.  (Caveat: Scott,
you certainly realize that you must provide the FERC with summary notes
of meetings with groups, agencies, etc. when we make the FERC filing -

Kevin and Eric,
Please read Scott's question below.  I have no problem with being a
little more open with the regulators.  I would not publish anything in
the paper (as yet) showing a route, etc., etc. as that will only get the
landowners stirred up before we are ready.  What are your thoughts?  Are
you comfortable with Scott being able to show the regulators a map of a
preliminary route?  John

In discussions with several agency personnel, it "appears" as though
they
are somewhat aware of Sun Devil.  Is it still to be treated as
confidential,
or can we discuss it more freely?  The main benefit I see, if we can
discuss
it more freely, is that many of the regulators have said things like "I
would need to see a route to be able to answer your question better."
Let
me know.  Thanks,  Scott

Please review the attached press release announcing Sun Devil's successful open season.  TW management has reviewed the release and their changes have been included.   

Project cost information was deliberately omitted from the release.  If asked, I will indicate that TW is finalizing the scope of the project and preparing cost estimates for the facilities and that TW engineers are preparing estimates required for the FERC application.

Concerning questions about the pipeline route, I will respond that through our community outreach initiative, TW will review route and corridor alternatives with interested community members.  TW will consider community and environmental input to determine the pipeline route.   

Can I hear back from you by Friday, Sept. 7 at NOON with changes?  

We plan to issue the release on Monday, Sept. 10 at noon.  

Thanks for your immediate attention.

Gina

Kevin,

Attached are two files with 10 years of pricing information.  The following price discovery points were included:

	El Paso San Juan (early years had one pt; later years it is split at Bondad)
	El Paso Permian
	So Cal - Border (Large Pkgs)
	PG&E - Border (Large Pkgs)

The price data is in Excel format so you can manipulate it to suit your needs.  Also, the graph is in power point, but was imported as a picture from LIM.

Let me know if you want to add additional points, etc.

Lorna

For the time being, keep the PR groups sweet but make no commitments.  We need to obtain market commitments as a first priority, which Kevin is pursuing most diligently.  He should have more feedback in October.

Keep us on your 'to do' list and thanks for all your help!

Hi Eric and Kevin!

I have heard from the PR group in Tuscon and they are anxious to start working with us.  They actually mentioned partnering with the Phoenix firm, just like we tossed around.

Would ya'll like to get together to discuss what direction we head?  With an expected first quarter 2002 filing, I think we need to start identifying our stakeholders and getting in touch with them.   We'll need the PR firm to get things moving for us.

Thanks a million.

Spoke with Richard Jordan at SWG this afternoon re: Phoenix ROW and El Paso F/R contracts.  

Richard said if the FERC staff recommendation for F/R is accepted, it will leave SWG in the position of needing a "substantial" amount of new transport capacity.

As for Phoenix ROW, they are looking at possibly taking the 8-inch line out of service and conveying it to us for Sun Devil in exchange for transport capacity on the project.  Their ROW varies in  type and width plus some is single use.  If they traded the line segment to us, we could use the existing ROW and just replace the line.

Anyway, I said we would stay in touch with them as things progressed with SD, hoping that things move a little faster now that FERC has given the market some direction.

No.  Because of the problems that occurred with the swing loads, we had to go back to the fully looped line.  Running steady state wasn't a problem but trying to meet peaks was with the 174.6 miles.  Since Planning has been guessing at what the customer wants in the way of swing capability, TW needs to nail that part down so Planning can run a GOOD analysis.  We can barely meet the 16-hour day load at 750 MMcf/d average day condition but can not at the 16-hour day at 1000 MMcf/d scenario even with fully looped pipe.  We (Planning) can run a multitude of cases that may or may not work and still may not hit the one the customer needs).  Let's get together to discuss again to make sure everyone is on the same page.  Bits and pieces from separate groups can cause problems with the true scope of work.  I would suggest you, Kevin, Ben, and myself to establish a project scope to be carried out from this day forward.  Let me know what you think about having a meeting.

Eric,

There are a multitude of cases run on this project over time and it's hard for everyone to pick the most current.  Please refer any facility questions to Planning and Optimization so we can respond with the most current information.  Arnold is right where the pipe lengths are but has the wrong story why.

The COMPLETE mainline loop from SJ tie-in to takeoff point between stations 1 and 2 was always about 222 miles.  Then add 16.5 miles downstream of station 1 for pressure support and the total is 238.61.   Some of the previous cases you have  seen did not include FULL looping, starting the Phoenix lateral at Station 2 and relied on more compression.

The Red Hawk lateral new length is based on starting at the end of the Panda Lateral to Red Hawk paralleling and existing line.

Not sure why they just sent it to me.  At any rate, here is the estimate consistent with the scope in the Power Point presentation being prepared for Stan.  

I would say let me know what else I can do, but I'm getting ready for a command performance this afternoon with Horton and head off to spring break vacation with my wife and high school freshman tomorrow.  

I'll be back Monday week.  Actually, Arnold or Mike Smith should be able to answer any questions you may have. 

(oops, I just noticed that the Red Hawk line is about 10 miles shorter here.  Not sure what that is about.

Sun Devil Pipeline Project

Marketing
-- At our Phoenix meeting, Salt River Project (SRP), the nation's 3rd largest public utility, announced an open season for a new 10 Bcf underground gas storage project just north of Kingman, Arizona.  The project's scope includes a pipe for taking gas from the Kern River system near Las Vegas, delivering to storage, then re-delivering the volume via interconnects with Transwestern, El Paso's north system, plus a new lateral going south reach El Paso near Wenden, AZ.  SRP's partners include Allegheny Energy and Sempra Energy Resources.  There is an opportunity here to combine the project benefits of Sun Devil with the pipeline proposed for the storage facility.  We will pursue this at the open house meeting hosted by SRP next week.  SRP expects regulatory approval in late 2003; the open season runs until February 8, 2002.

--  Met with APS to discuss peaking capability and the possibility of firm Park N Ride services to compete with their storage alternative at Copper Eagle.  The current western gas market has taken much of their urgency out of pursuing underground storage in Phoenix at this time.  We offered to give APS a contract "out" up until we file our FERC application if they would agree to reimburse us for the EIS costs.  We are preparing a written offer to be delivered next week.  

--  Panda Energy:  expect a response to our market proposal during the week of 1/14.  We are formulating a proposal to offer firm Park N Ride services based on the project's hydraulic capability.

Engineering -  a revised project scope has been submitted to reduce compressor and looping costs.  The goal is $100 million in reductions.  Will regroup 1/18 to review  potential reduction areas weighed against operational flexibility and volume.

FERC and El Paso Full Requirements Contracts - The discussion of the Strawman settlement proposal submitted by SRP to FERC did not make it on FERC's January agenda.  At our meeting this week, APS did not put much faith in the Strawman making much forward progress.

Eric,
Of course, the answer is yes.  The consideration of potential impacts to "C=
ultural Resources" is taken into account within the National Environmental =
Protection Act (NEPA); therefore, to say TW is "commited" to environmental =
stewardship would include that resource (although it is not generally under=
stood that NEPA would include it).  On the other hand, you make a great poi=
nt.  If you want to expand the TW's sensitive consideration with another se=
ntence to include other interests at this point (e.g., interested parties, =
landowners, regualtory bodies, etc.) that would be more reflective of the o=
pen concept we want to portray with the Sun Devil Project.  As a suggestion=
 you could probably say something to the effect that: "TW will consider sug=
gestions and comments made by interested parties (e.g., environmental group=
s, landowners, agencies and others) in the development of a potential route=
 for the pipeline. This includes TW's commitment to develop the route in an=
 environmentally sensitive manner."   John

PRESS RELEASE:Utilicorp Unit To Develop Ariz. Facility >UCU
Jan 31 at 15:20

  ( BW)(MO-AQUILA)(UCU) Aquila Set to Develop Arizona Gas Storage Facility
  Business Editors
  KANSAS CITY, Mo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 31, 2002--Aquila, the wholly owned
subsidiary of UtiliCorp United (NYSE: UCU), announced today that it has
purchased the Red Lake Storage Project from Southwest Gas Corporation.
  The purchase includes 36,000 acres approximately 30 miles north of Kingman,
Arizona, and the rights to develop a salt cavern storage facility. Along with
the land, Aquila purchased the water and mineral rights necessary to develop the
facility.
  The facility will have a gas storage capacity of 12 billion cubic feet (Bcf).
The first phase of the facility, with a storage capacity of 6 Bcf, is expected
to be in operation by the fourth quarter of 2003, with the full 12 Bcf planned
for the fourth quarter of 2004. The facility will connect to pipelines operated
by El Paso Natural Gas Pipeline and Transwestern Pipeline Company. Aquila
anticipates beginning an open season for the facility within the next seven to
ten days. In an open season period a company seeks storages commitments from
potential clients.
  "This facility fits with our strategy to build or acquire assets that enable
us to provide clients with the energy they need when they encounter dramatic
increases in demand," said Ed Mills, president and chief operating officer of
Aquila.
  The facility is positioned to serve Arizona power plants, as well as other
facilities in Nevada and California. There are approximately 60 gas-fired power
plants in Arizona, representing one of the largest single concentrations of such
facilities in the United States
  "Southwest Gas Corporation is pleased to see the Red Lakes Storage Project
being developed," said Ed Zub, executive vice president of Southwest Gas
Corporation. "Development of this project will benefit the states of Arizona and
Nevada where Southwest Gas Corporation serves more than 1.1 million customers."
  Aquila currently owns one of the largest independent storage facilities in the
southwest, a 21 Bcf facility in Katy, Texas. The company is also currently
completing the acquisition of a storage facility near Lodi, California, which
will provide gas to the frequently energy-short cities in northern California.
With the addition of the Red Lake Storage Project, Aquila will be one of the
largest independent storage providers for power plants and local gas
distribution companies in the Southwest.
  Based in Kansas City, Aquila is a leading wholesaler of natural gas, power and
coal in North America and provider of risk management services. Aquila also
provides wholesale energy and risk management services in the United Kingdom,
Germany and Scandinavia. Aquila is wholly owned by Kansas City-based UtiliCorp
United, an international energy company with 4 million customers across the U.S.
and in Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australia. Additional
information is available at www.aquila.com, or contact Mark D. Cook at 816/527-
1369.

Kevin
I am scrambling to get the correct quad maps so I can find the locations and route from the cavern to the El Paso MP 619. Without them, it will be very difficult from the air to figure out where we are and what we're looking for/at.
No luck yet, but will try to get before I depart Monday noon.

Doug--
	The Panda Energy Plant is to be located 3 miles NE of the Town of Gila Bend, AZ.  Panda proposes to lay approx. 18 miles of line to reach the El Paso southern system.  The Panda lateral to El Paso would parallel Hwy 85 and interconnect with El Paso at mile post 619.  The El Paso southern system lies approx. 15 miles south of Interstate 10.  You can click on the map below (look for the green dot) to locate the plant.

My question is what does the ROW look like from the proposed salt storage south and west to where Panda will interconnect with El Paso?

Gentlemen,

I just got off the phone with John Shafer and Jon Schmidt (ENSR
Tallahassee).  John Shafer has asked us to get started on a fatal flaw
analysis for routing of the Sun Devil project.  He suggested that I contact
all three of you.  He said that you, Larry, have done some initial routing;
you, Kevin, have an aerial photo of the Phoenix area that we can look at,
and should ask you to send; and that you, Doug, are the Project Director.  I
will be calling each of you within the next day or two to start gathering up
as much information as I can.  We have been advised to begin moving ASAP.
Thanks,  Scott

Subject: Further Strategic Planning - Environmental


Jon Schmidt,
As one of the first steps in preparing for our early meeting with the
FERC Staff, I believe we need to take the State and Federal Agency list
that Scott Patti has developed and select the key land managing agencies
(State, US Forest Service, BLM, etc.) that will be impacted by the
proposed right of way.  After the agencies are selected, a meeting
should be scheduled with those key agencies with the purpose of
obtaining their commitment to participate in the early collaboration
with the FERC on the Sun Devil Pipeline Project.  Your thoughts?---We should
definitely meet with the federal land managing agencies as well as the
Native Americans.  Better to meet with them individually at this point to
assess their interest and willingness to work in an informal collaborative
process and ID major issues with the route.  We should also meet with the
COE, FWS and major state agencies to assess the same information.

I also would like your input into the composition of the "team" that
requests those meetings and participates.  I view the make-up of the
team players for this task as very important to get this project
off-the-ground with the right momentum.  (Caveat: I am thinking that you
and I (both) should play a dual lead role in these early meetings with
Larry Campbell and/or Scott Patti setting them up for us - your
thoughts?) Then we can speak first hand to the FERC Staff about the
commitment to collaborate.  Don't you believe we need to obtain their
commitment prior to meeting with the FERC to discuss being considered
for the expedited processing?---Yes, FERC requires knowing if the agencies
will be willing to participate in this process.  As for team makeup,
Environmental, Business Development, and Engineering/Design should attend
these meetings to discuss FERC process and SunDevil's envi. approach to the
project, need for the project, and routing/design process that will be
undertaken to make the project safe.  You and I don't both have to be at
each meeting, but since there will be multiple meetings, we could staff
dependent upon schedules and availability.

By the way, as "food for thought" I have received a note from Doug Lake
(NRG) and he stands ready to do the Third Party contractor work on the
EIS (if we can get the FERC to agree to let NRG do it without bidding
the job out).  In fact, since NRG has completed their work on the Kern
River loop project - Doug said that he has a team that could be placed
on this project about the time we will need them.  That may work out
good for everyone, since the NRG team is familiar with the expedited
process, located in the western United States, and familiar with the
agencies and contacts in the area of our project.  

--NRG would have to convince not only FERC, but Enron they have the
resources to complete the work in your aggressive schedule.  This is fairly
critical as you want a consultant who can "keep up" in this process and not
put a lot of road blocks up.  On Gulfstream, NRGs monitors (representing
FERC) are bringing up issues and trying to make issues with things that the
FERC PM doesn't even think is worth doing---so we don't want someone doing
things that is right in their own eyes and not looking out for Enron's best
interests.

I could get you a complete list of agencies we've contacted if you'd

Scott,
Please furnish a list of who you will be talking with.  (Caveat: Scott,
you certainly realize that you must provide the FERC with summary notes
of meetings with groups, agencies, etc. when we make the FERC filing -
so keep good notes).  John

Kevin and Eric,
Please read Scott's question below.  I have no problem with being a
little more open with the regulators.  I would not publish anything in
the paper (as yet) showing a route, etc., etc. as that will only get the
landowners stirred up before we are ready.  What are your thoughts?  Are
you comfortable with Scott being able to show the regulators a map of a
preliminary route?  John

In discussions with several agency personnel, it "appears" as though
they
are somewhat aware of Sun Devil.  Is it still to be treated as
confidential,
or can we discuss it more freely?  The main benefit I see, if we can
discuss
it more freely, is that many of the regulators have said things like "I
would need to see a route to be able to answer your question better."
Let

I have attached our revised Cash Flow Estimate for the Sun Devil Pipeline
Project.  I have increased the overall estimate from $5.0 to $7.5 million
based on increases to the cultural resources survey/report, cultural
resources testing and mitigation, agency/public meetings, coordination
meetings, project management, environmental inspector management, and
environmental inspector subcontract tasks.  Substantial budget increases
were made to the cultural resources and environmental inspection tasks.  I
assumed that 4 environmental inspectors would be required for each spread
instead of the 2 inspectors per spread that were assumed in the previous
cost spreadsheet that Scott provided to you.

I also have attached the alternative analysis text and associated table for
the Compressor Station 2 to Cordes Junction, AZ alternative (i.e., I-17
alternative), and a telecommunication report regarding the complications
associated with the potential crossing of the Agua Fria National Monument.

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding this information.
Thanks!

I'll need to fly the routes and assess the terrain conditions. I plan to do this on Sept 11&12
Ron will need to run the hydraulics on the various options.
We both then need to agree on the most favourable option and do the Level B estimate based on the preferred route and the required line sizes and compression requirements
I think the earliest we can have the Level B complete is Sept 21

Guys, we'll need to get the Level 'B' cost estimates put together as soon as possible in order to send out binding contracts to customers.  I can't comfortably send out binding contracts with transportation rates still dependent upon a deeper project cost analysis.  Please let me know at your earliest convenience what your timing is for the Level B.

Ron/Kevin

Based on scaling the topo maps I have, the following are the lengths for each of the segments we discussed.

Transwestern Mainline- 36" Loop

Compressor Station #2 to El Paso Take Off Point - 33.6 miles or say  34 miles

New Lateral- 30" or 36"

A  Compressor Station #2 to Phoenix Storage Cavern  along I- 17 Highway route -  144 miles + 5% contingency  or say 151 miles


B El Paso Take Off Point to Phoenix Storage Cavern along El Paso Pipeline route - 120 miles + 5% contingency or say 126 miles

In summary, the New Lateral using the El Paso route is 25 miles shorter in what appears to be easier terrain, but will require the 34 mile extension on the Transwestern loop.


I will flly both routes on Sept 11 and examine any other options from the air.
I will drive as much of the routes as I can on Sept 12 and evaluate on the ground the soil/rock conditions.
After this asessement, we can zero in on the most cost effective option and route to pursue.
Call me if you have any questions

All,

Today, I learned that Kinder Morgan has approached FERC with a proposal to =
submit separate applications on phase one (NM, AZ) and phase two (CA) of th=
e Sonoran Pipeline.  Reportedly, FERC rejected the approach, advising KM to=
 come back when they could make an application on the full project.  This p=
robably delays their filing timetable because the California leg will be si=
gnificantly more difficult to market, environmental stakeholders are likely=
 to be more adversarial, and the probability of activist NIMBY landowners i=
s high.

Does anybody know when KM plans to file their application?  Is Phase one in=
-service of summer 2003 feasible if an application for the full pipeline is=
 required?  How long would it take KM to prepare the phase two application =
for the Sonoran project?

Please keep this info confidential.  Also, it would be helpful if you could=
 corroborate through your sources.   =20

Subject:=09Kinder Morgan - Sonoran Project

Danny,

Today, Kevin and I met with Scott Parker (KMI), Ron Brown (KMI), and Chad D=
riscoll (Calpine) to discuss possibilities of bundling Kinder Morgan's Sono=
ran project with Sun Devil.  A summary of our discussions is outlined below=
.

Concept

Explore the possibility of combining the Sun Devil and Sonoran Pipeline pro=
jects into a single venture along the existing Transwestern route from San =
Juan to the California Border.  Progress separate projects for service to P=
hoenix (Sun Devil) and California (Sonoran).

Rationale

Lower costs, higher margins
Greater capacity, economic scale, expansion options
Reduced stakeholder interventions (Navajos, environmental interests groups,=
 shippers)
Reduced regulatory process

Background

On May 2, 2001, Kinder Morgan and Calpine announced plans to jointly develo=
p the Sonoran Pipeline, subject to customary approvals and sufficient inter=
est by potential shippers.  As proposed, the Sonoran pipeline will be a 1,1=
60 mile high pressure interstate natural gas pipeline from the San Juan Bas=
in in northern New Mexico to markets in California.  The project, with an e=
stimated cost of $1.8 billion, will provide natural gas transportation capa=
city to California to serve growing electric generation demand. =20

The proposed pipeline will be evaluated and developed in two phases.  The f=
irst phase will run from the San Juan Basin to the California border with t=
he second phase extending from the California border to the San Francisco B=
ay area. =20

The first phase of the pipeline is expected to be completed in the summer o=
f 2003.  Phase one will consist of a 460 mile, 36 inch diameter pipeline fr=
om the interconnection of TransColorado Gas Transmission and Transwestern P=
ipeline to various points at the Blanco Hub in San Juan, NM.  In addition, =
the pipeline will continue westward with deliveries into the California/Ari=
zona border.  A 20 mile, 24 inch diameter lateral would be built to Topock,=
 AZ.  The initial capacity would start with 750,000 dth/d, with capability =
to expand to 1 million dth/day.  The estimated cost of phase one is $624 wi=
th a targeted in-service date of summer 2003.  Sponsors said the open seaso=
n will seek at a minimum, 20-year term commitments at a fixed transport rat=
e of $0.39/dth for firm transportation.  Sonoran proposes to charge shipper=
s actual fuel on phase one via a fuel tracker.  Fuel is estimated at 1.3%. =
 More than 1 billion cubic feet per day of binding agreements and non-bindi=
ng expressions of interest were received for the first phase of the project=
. =20

Phase two will be a 590 mile, 42 inch diameter pipeline from Needles on the=
 California border to points within California, terminating near Antioch in=
 Contra Costa County.  Once completed, the pipeline will be able to transpo=
rt between 1 million and 1.5 million dth/day.  The in-service date for the =
phase two has yet to be determined.  The cost is projected to be $1.1 billi=
on.   Another 1.5 Bcf/d of non-binding commitments and expressions of inter=
est were received for phase two. =20

Sonoran has already received binding bids from Calpine Energy Services for =
400,000 dth/d for phase one and another 500,000 dth/d for its phase two. On=
ce completed, the new pipeline could connect with Kern River, Mojave, Elk H=
ills, Pacific Gas and Electric, Southern California Gas and various gas-fir=
ed power plants. =20

SoCalGas's Residual Load Service (RLS) penalty woull not affect the Sonoran=
 project because the pipeline route parallels PG&E's pipelines and the prim=
ary target load is new gas-fired generation not within SoCalGas's market te=
rritory.=20

The pipeline also will connect to a new underground storage facility near L=
odi being developed by Lodi Gas Storage, Inc., a subsidiary of Houston base=
d Western Hub Properties LLC. =20

The project could have a noteworthy co-owner: the Navajo Nation, the sovere=
ign government of 180,000 residents on the largest Indian reservation withi=
n the United States.  An agreement in principle to give the Navajos an owne=
rship interest in the $1.7 billion pipeline that crosses their reservation =
was disclosed in August by an executive of Kinder Morgan at Indian Energy 2=
001, a conference of the Council of Energy Resource Tribes that highlighted=
 the growing role Indian tribes play in powering the West.  As part of the =
deal to secure that right of way, the Navajo Nation would invest in the pro=
ject and receive a minority interest when the pipeline opens.  The deal wou=
ld be structured to limit the tribe's exposure to risks during the construc=
tion phase of the project.  Gas from the pipeline could also fuel a propose=
d Navajo-owned power plant on the reservation.  Red Cedar Gas Gathering, wh=
ich is jointly owned by the Southern Ute Indian Tribe and Kinder Morgan mad=
e arrangements with the Navajo Indians.

Kinder Morgan is not interested in expanding the equity participants in the=
 Sonoran Pipeline.

Next steps

Kinder Morgan to evaluate providing facilities to serve TW open season mark=
ets (SJ, Phoenix, California) along proposed Sonoran Pipeline route and com=
e back to ETS with a proposal (operating lease, undivided interest, no ship=
per contractual arrangements).=20

 on-going operations
- Use of TW r-o-w

Steve, below is a partial answer to most of your questions.  Can we set a time for Wednesday afternoon 12/5 to talk?  thanks


Max Hourly Quantity:  we are reviewing capability to deliver the MHQ in a 16 hr block.  Doesn't appear to be any problem but we are working thru the hydraulic studies to verify and quantify.  What will be the plant's complete hourly capability?  If you're  receiving gas from both TW and EPNG, and for some reason EPNG shut off deliveries, we can model the impact of delivering all the plant's requirements for known durations.

Contract Rate:  will be a negotiated rate (eliminates rate risk for Gila).  The rate design is currently one-part (no differentiation between reservation and commodity).  The rate does not include ACA / GRI surcharges or fuel.  It covers a minimal return on the project's capital cost plus the ongoing O&M.

Fuel Rate: Fuel was set with the shippers in the 1996 rate case; the offer to Panda is consistent with the current tariff.

Delivery Term:  as the term gets shorter, the rate by necessity, goes up to cover the return hurdles.

Services:  delivery pressure at the Panda / EPNG interconnect should be a minimum 700 #

Capacity of the lateral from Copper Eagle to EPNG will be 500,000 Dth/d.

Alternative rec/del combinations:  Our thought here was if Panda is willing to commit to taking capacity in the project, then TW would give you all the necessary flexibility to move gas to other destinations at the Contract rate.  For instance, Panda would be paying a one-part rate for delivery to the plant.  If for some reason, plant demand was reduced, then you would have all the flexibility to move gas to alternative markets.  

Backhaul:  the 50,000/day would be a guarantee.

Daily imbalances, short notice start up/ shut down:  We have to plan for the worst case scenario and assume there is no storage.  With this in mind, TW will have some flexibility just due to the size of the project (36" pipe and 700 - 900 # pressure) but this will depend on what other shippers are doing.  Again, we are modelling the hydraulics.

Kevin, the document looks good.  I did forward to Ranelle Paladino in Steve Kirk's group to look at it from a tariff perspective.

Scott,
I received your attached letter reflecting your "out-of-scope" expenditure for the fatal flaw analysis.  I am amazed that you spent $10,000.00 more than you were authorized (authorized amount $8,500.00).  I have passed along your invoice for the contracted $8,500.00 to our development group and at present have no authorization to approve any amount over that commitment.  When the Commercial guys have contracts with shippers and we are ready to move ahead on the environmental resource reports for the FERC filing, we can talk about the overage at that time.  However, I am not sure recovery will be possible.  Until then, I'm afraid I have no further authorization.  John Shafer

Kevin Hyatt, Greetings from eSource:
 
Pursuant to your request for gas production reports for the Rocky Mountain/San Juan/Four Corners region, and the effects of the San Juan tax credit expiration.  The Energy Information Administration reported in 1994 that production should continue its upward trend even though the section 29 tax credit expired.  I have attached the Inside FERC article that speaks to the EIA's postion.  The EIA did not report forecasted data by state or region, but did provide a graph of the projected production data.  Please see the results of our research below.  Should you have any further questions, or additional tasking, please do not hesitate to contact us.
 
 
 
 
Thank you for using eSource <http://esource.enron.com/>.  We look forward to assisting you in the future.
 
Regards,

Hard as it is to believe, we do not really know where the TW lines are within the ROW.
Best we can tell,  a centerline survey of the easement was done proir to construction, and the line/lines were installed somewhere within the easement width..
Bottom line is no offsets from edges of the ROW appear to be available to identify the exact locations, and only completing a field survey will tell us the exact location of the lines.
I don't think these costs are warranted at this stage. Do you agree?
 
The San Juan Lateral  has 1 - 30" line in it and typically has a 50" average ROW width.
The TW Mainline has 2- 30" lines in it ( with a 50' separation between them) and the ROW width varies from 75' to 120'.
 
Hopefully, next weeks field trip will allow me to try and peg the location in a few spots down.

Kevin,

Attached are electricity price discovery results for the following:

Palo Verde Peak Wtd Average Daily
Palo Verde Off-Peak Wtd Average Daily
Palo Verde Gas Spark - SJuan (tied to closest gas price discovery point--looks to be SJuan)
Palo Verde Electricity Spark Spread - 8000 Kwh Turbine
Palo Verde Electricity Spark Spread - 10000 Kwh Turbine

The data starts in 1996 when prices started to be posted.

Kevin,

Steve Harris reported that SW Gas wants to sign up for the remaining 12,400/d of Redrock expansion capacity.  They are talking about 14-15 cents for 10-15 years.  Also, they are interested in capacity expansions to Las Vegas.  This will reduce the Sun Devil capx, which we should include in the economic modeling.  

In progressing discussions with anchor shippers, we should consider some additional rate design features-
Capx/ROE incentives, eg if we build the project for $911 MM, we earn a nominal return, say 9% while if we come in at <$800 MM, we earn 14-15%
Fuel tracker - - - this takes money out of the deal for us but probably makes the pricing more transparent.

James & David --
	Can the two of you coordinate a revenue model for Sun Devil that incorporates a Straight - Fixed Variable rate design along the following parameters using 15, 20 and 25 year terms:

San Juan utilization: 85% of 780,000/MMBtu/d
Mainline: 85% utilization of 810,000/MMBtu/d
Phoenix lateral: 75% utilization of 500,000 MMBtu/d

Also, prepare some ROE sensitivities if the above utilization falls by 10% and rises by 10%. 

I will be out of town till Tues 11/13.  Can we get together that morning and review your analyses?

page me if you have questions at 888-582-7421

Kevin,

Great start!  Thanks for the list, it makes the process more transparent.  How would you rate each prospects?  It would be helpful to develop some kind of scoring system based on potential load to be connected, credit quality, and El Paso-RQ tariff barrier.  Any other relevant attributes?

Hey gang, I need your help.  The address below will take you to a spreadsheet of marketing contacts for the Sun Devil Project.  I need you to update the spreadsheet as you add customers and discuss the project.  I have added the first dozen that I know about.  Michelle, there is a new contact for Cook Inlet and I gave the lady your name and number after I walked her through the project.  

Please keep the spreadsheet current as you talk with customers.  Kim, Steve, Eric, and I will be reviewing the sheet regularly to view progress.  Let me know if you'd like to see it formatted differently or to have other info added.  You can also write out your notes and give them to Susan Wadle and she will input the info for you.

thanks for the help.
kh

P.S.  If you'd like to set up a shortcut on your PC desk top to take you directly to the sheet, let me know and I will set it up for you.

Development of Sonoran Pipeline Project Halted

02/15/2002 
PR Newswire 
(Copyright (c) 2002, PR Newswire) 
HOUSTON, Feb. 15 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P. (NYSE: KMP) and Calpine Corporation (NYSE: CPN) today announced the termination of the proposed Sonoran Pipeline project. The Sonoran Pipeline was unable to secure sufficient binding commitments to make a successful project given market conditions. Securing firm transportation agreements was a stipulation that executives of both companies initially stated was necessary before development of the project could begin. Neither company has spent significant dollars on the proposed development of the pipeline and it was not expected to begin service until 2004. 
Both KMP and Calpine will continue to evaluate other opportunities to serve the growing California market. 
Phase I of the proposed Sonoran Pipeline would have extended from the Blanco Hub and terminated near Needles and Topock, Calif., with the possibility of a second phase extending into northern California. 
Based in San Jose, Calif., Calpine Corporation is an independent power company that is dedicated to providing customers with clean, efficient, natural gas-fired power generation. It generates and markets power, through plants it develops, owns and operates, in 29 states in the United States, three provinces in Canada and in the United Kingdom. Calpine also is the world's largest producer of renewable geothermal energy, and it owns 1.3 trillion cubic feet equivalent of proved natural gas reserves in Canada and the United States. The company was founded in 1984 and is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CPN. For more information about Calpine, visit its website at www.calpine.com . 
Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L. P. is the nation's largest pipeline master limited partnership with an enterprise value of approximately $9 billion. KMP owns and operates more than 20,000 miles of pipelines and over 70 terminals. Its pipelines transport more than two million barrels per day of gasoline and other petroleum products and up to 4.3 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas. Its terminals handle over 50 million tons of coal and other bulk materials annually and have a liquids storage capacity of more than 53 million barrels for petroleum products and chemicals. KMP is also the leading provider in the U.S. of CO2, which is used in enhanced oil recovery projects.

Attached is the land use category and constraint table that Jon Alstad has
put together for the currently proposed route.  He and I both have been
working on the briefing report (fatal flaw analysis), and this will be
another part of it.  The text in the briefing report is not fully fleshed
out and coherent at this point, primarily due to the unforeseen brush fires
we've been putting out all week on the Red Rock project.  We hope to have it
fleshed out and coherent on Monday.  Please call with any questions.

Eric,
As we discussed, with ENSR's assistance I have developed a projected timeli=
ne for developing the FERC required F-1 Exhibit (12 part Resource Reports t=
o satisfy the NEPA requirement) in sufficient detail to meet the FERC filin=
g requirements and expedite the processing of the environmental portion of =
the application.  The aggressive timeline assumes that the expedited FERC "=
Collaborative Approach" will be implemented throughout the processing of th=
e application.  Even with the "Collaborative Approach" and all of the upfro=
nt work done with the environmental community to streamline the processing,=
 the schedule is very, very optimistic and assumes that all conflicting iss=
ues will be resolved quickly and the processing continue. =20

I have requested that Jon Schmidt (ENSR) begin working on a detailed cost e=
stimate, by quarters in two phases.  The first part of the estimate would b=
e to project the environmental cost, by quarters of preparing the 12 Resour=
ce Reports (including the necessary field work) that would get Sun Devil to=
 an FERC filing in the first quarter of 2002 that would not be rejected.  T=
he second component of the cost estimate would be to complete the field wor=
k and permitting phases during the processing of the application.  This inc=
ludes participating in FERC scoping meetings and agency meetings as require=
d.  This would include assisting the third party environmental contractor i=
n working on the EIS to expedite the writing as needed.  It would also incl=
ude mitigation packages to satisfy agency requirements.  The third and fina=
l component would be to budget for a Third Party Environmental Contractor t=
o write the EIS document during the time that the field work is being devel=
oped and to process the same with the FERC Staff.  Once we get the "White P=
aper" Fatal Flaw analysis that ENSR is preparing for this project we will h=
ave enough information along with the budget to get us to the FERC filing t=
o make some quantifiable decisions on moving forward when comparing those t=
o the commercial advantages that you are developing.

If you have any questions, please give me a call.  John Shafer

What we have done was use meteorological data from the internet but have fo=

 reads low compared to the actuals at the stations.  I try to go by what th=

I have seen temperatures in the summer hit high temps as early as 9:00 a.m.=
  Other factors to consider is not only the ambient temps but what the comp=
ressor unit can stand (ie; shutdowns or limit switches).  If the nightly ex=
haust temperature does not cool down enough at Bloomfield, the unit can be =
limited in power as early as 8:00 a.m. when it reaches 1400 F.  It appears =
that thre is plenty of power left to run but the unit can't get there.  I h=
ave seen power levels peak at 4000 Hp when the unit is site rated at 4500 H=
p. =20

As time goes on, I'll either help you understand more or confuse you.  Let =
me know which direction I'm headed from time to time.  You can't hurt my fe=
elings.  I'm copying Kevin to keep him up to speed.  Planning is not an exa=

Yes, thanks very much.  I'm trying to move up the pipeline engineering + de=

I get the impression that having different design basis conditions for each=

in general you have an additional 3% HP available for every 10 deg F below =
95 deg at each station.  During the summer Stations 1, 3, and 4 are already=

I understand that pipeline design is based on hot (95 degrees F) ambient te=

Doug,

You're right!!  Pipe size can swing the costs substantially. May be able to go down to a 20" or 24" depending on flow.  Once I have a volume,  I can size the line in a matter of minutes.  100 vs 450 MMcf/d makes a BIG difference.  I'll leave the guess work of flow up to Kevin.

Do you want a cost estimate for the Panda Energy extension for the Cavern to the tie-in point.
It is 35.4 miles long , and we need to rethink/confirm the 36" size based on volume, as every inch in diameter adds substantial cost.

OK, the open season was announced and began yesterday 8/8.  So far we've stirred up a pretty good market reaction and a lot of inquiries; bids are due by 8/30.
I've scheduled a meeting with you, me, Eric Gadd, and Jerry Martin for next Wed 8/15 at 3pm.  Please feel free to invite whomever you feel necessary.  My objective is to better understand the project construction process and what steps I can take to compress the time-line as much as possible.  The critical path item for this project I believe is the ROW / EIS for the Flagstaff - Phoenix lateral.  We need to focus on building AZ project support from the grass-roots thru to top governmental agencies.
 
thanks

Thanks Kevin.  We will continue to work on preliminary information.  At any point that the project begins to look like a go, let's sit down with the appropriate internal departments and develop a strategy for how to approach the sensitive issues (including the environmental reports, landowner issues, media, native americans, FERC application, etc.)   Thanks, John Shafer

John, I am continuing to work with Facility Planning to get reasonable and comfortable cost estimates.  Some of the guys have been on vacation and it has slowed us down.  I anticipate beginning the open season the week of 8/6.  I'll stay in touch.

thanks

Kevin, 
We have continued to make early contacts with the environmental community and some permitting agencies in Arizona to get a feel for any sensitive issues that might confront the proposed Sun Devil Project.  I think the information will be invaluable as the project is sited.  I appreciate the opportunity to be involved in the project at this stage and stand ready to provide any assistance needed as you move forward.   We will get more definitive information (especially related to the greenfield portion of the project) as we define the proposed corridor.  Why don't you catch me up on the project after your open season results start to come in.  If it looks like a "go" I would suggest that a project team be organized to plan the strategy for involvement with the environmental community, Native Americans, local government, state government, Federal agencies, the media, landowner resistance, etc.  Let me know if you need anything else.  John

Subject:        Phone Conversation with TNC 

Today I spoke with Jean Calhoun of the Arizona Chapter of The Nature Conservancy about the proposed Sundevil Pipeline Construction Project. She was very cordial and appreciative concerning Transwestern's proactive efforts to contact not only her office but all federal and state agencies  which may have jurisdictional lands impacted by the project.  Although the proposed route of the pipeline corridor has not been firmly established, she did  offer some general, yet valuable information concerning the geographic area which exists south of Flagstaff into roughly northern Phoenix.  

The area south of Flagstaff into Phoenix crosses of three major ecological regions identified by the TNC with major biological diversity of plants and animals.  The TNC has completed published studies on two of the regions.  The TNC has requested that should this project be apporved, these publications be used to assist in the environmental studies which will need to be completed prior to construction and approval by FERC.  To the south and east of Flagstaff is a sensitive portfolio consisting of the Verde River which is of ecologic interest due to the abundance of endangered fish and bird species which live in and around the area of the River.   This river could be impacted by the pipeline due to its meandering in a southwesterly direction across Arizona.  

I have contacted other state and federal governmental agencies, in addition to the TNC, and all parties have expressed difficulity in assessing the environmental impact of a project of this magnitude without knowing the pipeline corridor route.  Part of this concern is due to the extensive and unique biological diversity of Arizona.  I think we will have a better handle on how we address the environmental concerns and opportunities when this piece of the puzzle is completed and also how much more specific and helpful the agencies assistance will be when identified areas are known.

I am surprised that you interpret this is a new request.
>From day 1, ETS has been responsible for preparing a Level B estimate for the Sun Devil project.
What I would like your group to do is come up with a cost estimate for all work related to the environmentsl aspect of the project from today through to completion of the project. i.e a Jan, 2004 in service date
Timewise, I would lime a first pass estimate by Sept 21, a second pass estimate by Sept 26, and the final complete estimate by Sept 28
Please call me if unclear and so that we can discuss.
Thanks

Larry and Scott,
Doug Cebryk, Project Manager for the Sun Devil Project has requested that we furnish a more complete cost estimate (Level B) which would take the Environmental costs through the post construction phase.  Another words, take the budget you have furnished which was through the FERC filing phase and extrapolate additional environmental costs for processing the filing, obtaining the permits, environmental third party inspecting costs during construction and mitigation.  That must be given to Doug Cebryk by COB on Friday, September 21.  This will include all air permit costs.  If you have any questions, please give me a call.  John

Ron,

Thanks for the note.  Several comments/questions-

It is not necessary to plan facilities for 750 MMcf/d and 1000 MMcf/d to meet the 16-hour day load.  At the moment, we can only identify 540 MMcf/d potential demand for 16-hour day load.   
Can we avoid a fully looped line and still serve the 540 MMcf/d demand for 16-hour day load?  
If so, would there be additional capacity that we could sell to other markets based on 24-hour loads in the Phoenix area?

I'll be out of town on Tues + Wed, returning on Thurs.  Let's get together and agree the base case for project scope.  I'll ask Susan Wadle to co-ordinate a meeting with you, Kevin, Ben, and myself.

Eric

No.  Because of the problems that occurred with the swing loads, we had to go back to the fully looped line.  Running steady state wasn't a problem but trying to meet peaks was with the 174.6 miles.  Since Planning has been guessing at what the customer wants in the way of swing capability, TW needs to nail that part down so Planning can run a GOOD analysis.  We can barely meet the 16-hour day load at 750 MMcf/d average day condition but can not at the 16-hour day at 1000 MMcf/d scenario even with fully looped pipe.  We (Planning) can run a multitude of cases that may or may not work and still may not hit the one the customer needs).  Let's get together to discuss again to make sure everyone is on the same page.  Bits and pieces from separate groups can cause problems with the true scope of work.  I would suggest you, Kevin, Ben, and myself to establish a project scope to be carried out from this day forward.  Let me know what you think about having a meeting.

Eric,

There are a multitude of cases run on this project over time and it's hard for everyone to pick the most current.  Please refer any facility questions to Planning and Optimization so we can respond with the most current information.  Arnold is right where the pipe lengths are but has the wrong story why.

The COMPLETE mainline loop from SJ tie-in to takeoff point between stations 1 and 2 was always about 222 miles.  Then add 16.5 miles downstream of station 1 for pressure support and the total is 238.61.   Some of the previous cases you have  seen did not include FULL looping, starting the Phoenix lateral at Station 2 and relied on more compression.

The Red Hawk lateral new length is based on starting at the end of the Panda Lateral to Red Hawk paralleling and existing line.

Not sure why they just sent it to me.  At any rate, here is the estimate consistent with the scope in the Power Point presentation being prepared for Stan.  

I would say let me know what else I can do, but I'm getting ready for a command performance this afternoon with Horton and head off to spring break vacation with my wife and high school freshman tomorrow.  

I'll be back Monday week.  Actually, Arnold or Mike Smith should be able to answer any questions you may have. 

(oops, I just noticed that the Red Hawk line is about 10 miles shorter here.  Not sure what that is about.

Sun Devil Project

	Kern River - Williams announced a definitive agreement to sell it's Kern River pipeline system to Midwest gas and power utility MidAmerican Energy.  The sale includes the 900,000 MMBtu/d expansion project from Opal, WY to Southern California.  Last week, FERC gave Kern a positive preliminary determination on the non-environmental aspects of the expansion.  Now that the project's financing hurdles are apparently overcome, we expect FERC to approve the project shortly and construction will commence.  

	Assuming Kern delivers 700,000/d of 900,000 capacity into Southern California (200,000 would stay in Utah or Nevada markets), and the only other large California expansion is a 500,000 MMBtu/d lateral to serve Sempra's Baja California power plant, there may be an opportunity for TW to backhaul Opal gas to various Arizona markets.  If a Sun Devil lateral to Phoenix were constructed as a first phase, this could potentially reduce some of the effect of the negative price impact at the California border.    		

	Bowie Power Plant - contact was made with the plant's developers in Arizona this week.  After a positive ACC decision, they are moving quickly to get the necessary air permits.  RW Beck in Denver is the consultant for the plant's fuel requirements.  No determination has been made thus far on where (or how) the gas will reach the plant.

	Panda Energy - the confidentiality agreement was executed so Panda will begin sharing projected plant operating data with TW.

Gomez Lateral

Initial review of the line's property easements indicate no obstacles or restrictions in transferring the line to a new owner.  Maintenance records will be ready for review by March 15.  A brief offering memorandum is being circulated for review by other interested parties.

Kevin,

Yes, Arizona does have an Energy Coordinator in the Governor's Office.  His name is Craig Marks and he is the guy that I've made contact with to whom I sent our Open Season announcement and earlier this week, our press release.  Craig is also the person recommended by Corp. Gov't Affairs as a key contact in the Gov's office.  Evidently this is the person they have dealt with in regard to deregulation, etc.

Glen, 
	see note and link below.  The report on the link is only 5 pages and makes some really good recommendations on what states should do to coordinate info and policy on pipeline construction in their state.  Does AZ have a coordinator for pipe activity?  Does the AZ governor have an energy liason with whom we can coordinate?

Regent Energy in Pact to Develop 500 MW Plant 
Regent Energy recently executed a contract with Millennium Energy Ventures, a private Houston-based venture capital and project development company, to develop an electric plant with 500 MW generating capacity on Regent's Horseshoe Gallup lease in San Juan County, NM. 
Regent will own 75% of the project, while MEVCO will own the remaining 25%. The estimated cost of the project comes in at $250 million. 
Under the agreement, MEVCO will manage the permitting, estimated at 6 to 9 months, and construction process, arranging the equity as needed for same. Regent will be prepared to give up 50% (total) of its 75% net for the financing, netting a 25% interest following the equity/debt financing. 
Further terms of the agreement provide that MEVCO will assist Regent in the acquisition of several gas fields in the Four Corners area, San Juan and Rio Ariba Counties of New Mexico, totaling an estimated 90+ Bcf and 20 MMcf/d current production. This production will be sufficient to power 100 MW of the power plant, with the remaining supply to be aggregated from other San Juan producers. 
MEVCO Managing Director Phillip Gennarelli noted, "We are pleased to be involved in this project with Regent. The addition of more producing properties in the area that we bring Regent, coupled with Regent's Horseshoe Gallup holdings, which are in direct proximity with the existing Four Corners Power Plant and the route of the recently announced Sonoran Pipeline venture of Calpine and Kinder Morgan, will provide an unequaled opportunity for both companies." 
Regent President John Ehrman said, "The additional production from producing properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing, currently producing some $1.5 million per month in net operating income, coupled with the additional income through power generation helps Regent to maximize the location of our holdings in relation to the proximity of the existing power plant and transmission lines to key electricity markets in Los Angeles and other western markets. It is a good use of our surface lease, not related to the current proved mineral reserves of the lease." 
The producing oil and properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing are in Regent's core area of the Four Corners region near Farmington, NM. Regent will be required to finance the acquisition of the oil and gas proven producing properties under consideration. 
Recently, Regent announced that it was in the process of purchasing the interests of all remaining working interest owners in the field, a transaction that is expected to be consummated by the end of the third quarter 2001, giving Regent 100% ownership of the current minerals on the lease.

Kevin: Thanks for the information and 5000 feet of halite if it is one uniform bed is certainly similar to Gulf Coast salt domal opportunities.   If you decide to move forward with this effort, issues of water can be evaluated based upon Arizona rules and regulations for fresh water use and salt water disposal.  I have spoken with Morgan regarding a  Fall 2001 Meeting, 7-10 October, 2001, Albuquerque, NM, USA of the Solution Mining Research Institute which might have some information regarding developing salt storage in Arizona.
I would certainly like to support your efforts as you move forward.
Maurice

Below are the answers to your questions regarding the proposed Crystal Gas salt cavern storage for the west side of Phoenix.  After you have reviewed the answers, I would be interested to hear your opinion / comments regarding the feasibility of the storage facility.  If the cavern does not get built, we will likely change some of our plans regarding the Sun Devil pipeline project.

thanks for your input

Dennis: some questions regarding salt storage:

Is the salt layer, bedded or domal? [Hyatt, Kevin]   Bedded 
What is the thickness of the salt layer at the development site? [Hyatt, Kevin]   over 5000 feet 
What is the chemistry of the salt, i.e. is the salt halite, gypsum/anhydrite calcium sulfate), sodium sulfate [Hyatt, Kevin]   95 -99% halite 
Has any drilling been done at the site, coring, rock mechanics evaluation? [Hyatt, Kevin]    
Are any geological reports available for the site? [Hyatt, Kevin]    Test wells have been drilled.  I'm not confident I can get report copies. 
What restrictions exist (rules and regulations) regarding storage development in Arizona? [Hyatt, Kevin]   water & water disposal 
What is the availability for water to solution mine the a cavern? [Hyatt, Kevin]   water is available, disposal of the brine solution will be an issue 

Just a few thoughts, I apologize that I cannot be with you on Wed. and if I need to travel to Arizona to meet with technical staff, I certainly can make arrangements after my trip to Wichita next week.

Regards,

Maurice

[Hyatt, Kevin]  
The storage cavern will be built in 3 phases, 3.3 Bcf working gas per phase, 330mmcfd withdrawal, 165mmcfd injection
30 day / 12 turn capability.

Compression will likely be 8-9000 hp per cavern (electric units).  Leaching time will be 1-2 years.  Brine disposal test scheduled for November.  There is a Morton Salt  plant adjacent to the cavern site.  Morton will likely take some of the brine, but not enough (too much salt will depress the maket price for the commodity).  First cavern to be available late 2004 / early 2005, 2nd cavern late 2006.

Eric, here are my thoughts on your Sun Devil issues.

I assume that a guarantee will not include Liquidated Damages, if it does we would want to rethink the response.  However,

?	Current Sun Devil facility design and cost estimates are based upon a 24hr MDQ to match with existing TW Mainline services.
?	Additional facilities will be required to accommodate 24hr ratable nominations at shipper receipt points.
?	Minimum delivery pressures of 500-600 psi should not be an issue for current Sun Devil scope (at 24hr MDQ).  We will run transient modeling to confirm.
?	If requested, we can re-design and re-estimate Sun Devil at a 16hr MDQ, 24hr ratable noms at receipt points and minimum delivery pressure obligations (with Liquidated Damages or not), but it will be enormously more expensive than the current proposed Sun Devil project.
?	Notwithstanding the engineering required to provide these types of services, there may be issues with existing certificates, tariffs, customers etc. due to the fact that Sun Devil gas will run in the same pipeline facilities along with existing Transwestern services.  But I'm not much of an authority in that area.
?	If you would like us to proceed with the re-design and re-estimate please advise John Keller and he will start the paperwork.

Phil,

I wanted to get your thoughts on service conditions that we're discussing with prospective Sun Devil shippers.

Hourly swings.  We've indicated that the shippers can nominate 1/16th of their MaxDQ at delivery points in any hour subject to-
- Proper notice
- 24 hour ratable nominations at receipt points
- no obligation on the pipeline to deliver more than the MaxDQ in any gas day

Pressure guarantee.  All prospective shippers are power generators and they want pressure guarantees in the range of 500-600 psig.

	We plan to file with FERC Q1 2002 for the pipe certificate.  Doug Cebryk and Larry Campbell plan to fly the proposed ROW from Flagstaff, AZ to Phoenix, AZ on 9/11.  We plan to loop the existing San Juan lateral and mainline segments as far west as Flagstaff.  Attached is a copy of the open season (which closed Thurs 8/30).

Sun Devil Project

	Panda Energy - We are analyzing the pro-forma operating information for the plant submitted to us by Panda this week.  Still waiting on pro-forma information from AZ Public Service.

	El Paso full requirements / FERC Settlement - FERC staff proposed a settlement that would convert the FR shippers on El Paso to Contract Demand (CD).  The proposed settlement "will restore some certainty to firm-service obligations while providing incentives for El Paso to add significant increments of new capacity to its system."  The proposed settlement will now move to a technical conference.  Chairman Pat Wood also said noted the market should not look to see any more 10 year settlements as the period is too long and markets move too quickly.

	The impact of the above for Sun Devil is as follows:  FERC is sending price signals to the market and enabling El Paso to expand its system to meet demand (which under the previous settlement, EP was unable to do).  The project that meets the market demand with the best economics will win.

	Kern River - The Federal Trade Commission approved the sale of Kern River Pipeline from Williams to MidAmerican Energy.

Gomez Lateral

Working with Corporate Development to determine the process necessary to satisfy Creditor Committee requirements.  A field visit with Pioneer has been tentatively scheduled for March 26.  In the event we are required to hold an auction for the asset, a draft offer memo has been prepared and is being circulated for review.

Please read Scott's question below.  I have no problem with being a
little more open with the regulators.  I would not publish anything in

In discussions with several agency personnel, it "appears" as though
they
are somewhat aware of Sun Devil.  Is it still to be treated as
confidential,
or can we discuss it more freely?  The main benefit I see, if we can
discuss
it more freely, is that many of the regulators have said things like "I
would need to see a route to be able to answer your question better."
Let
me know.  Thanks,  Scott
