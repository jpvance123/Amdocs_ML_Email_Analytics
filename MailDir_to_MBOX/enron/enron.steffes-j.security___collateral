One more.

- Washington Gas: EES has parental guaranty. Due to current financial status, Washington Gas has requested Bond instead. RAC contact indicated no bond available - EES has 30 days to respond.

A note on the Con-Ed - Services/Operations has a work around for the few Mid-market deals origination is closing which will prevent us from increasing our security (Straight Dual Billing). Mass Market volume increase will drive any security increase in this market.

Thanks,
Rebecca

... and just to be clear, here are the recent or current issues I am aware of and their status:

Con Ed, request for $1 million security in lieu of parental guaranty:  complete.  $1 million sent prior to 11/14 deadline.  Request for additional security likely to come when Con Ed sees our increasing load.
SoCal Gas, request for margin sharing agreement in lieu of parental guaranty:  complete.  New contract signed and delivered 11/16.  Retail and wholesale gas desks to work together to avoid occurence of margin call for credit over $5 million daily.
Peoples Gas of IL, request for letter of credit for $40k in lieu of parental guaranty:  deferred.  Peoples agreed to suspend demand for l/c if further downgrade does not occur.
Virginia license for EES gas:  complete, for now.  Services served copy of application to other parties.  Their comments due back to VA SCC by Dec 7.
Maryland license for EEMC gas:  scheduled to be approved on provisional basis today.  MD PSC will be reviewing generic requirement that parental guarantees be unconditional, unlimited, and unrestricted.
Pennsylvania, request for update to EES and EPMI bonds and request for increase in EES bond from $250k to $3.8m:  Under review.  New bond language has been sent to Mary Grisaffi.  Trying to whittle down (or eliminate) increase.
CG&E, request for deposit associated with Transmission Service Agreement:  being processed.  Service request reduced from 100 MW to 25 MW to reduce cash outlay.
First Energy, requested new security in lieu of parental guaranty.  deferred.  First Energy agreed to continue accepting parental guaranty in absence of further downgrade.

If there are others we should know about, please let me know.

After talking with Dan, I intend to set up a meeting to provide complete matrices on licensing and utility contracts sometime early during the week beginning Dec 3.  

Also, just to make sure everyone is clear, Harry, Gloria, and Rebecca are on point during the next few weeks to ensure that that EES and/or EPMI responds timely to any request for info, additional security, or other utility matters.  This, of course, will continue to require help from legal, credit, and operations.

If anyone has any other questions, please give me a call.

Thanks.

Jim / Evan - 

As you are probably aware, the performance and surety bond market is difficult for us to navigate in and around in our current situation.  As an example, EFS has been shut out of getting access to new bid and performance / payments bonds for its business that requires these.  We are addressing this with the bonding companies now.  All of their existing bonds are in place and in force.

In light of this, I wanted to make sure that we are absolutely current in all aspects of all bonding requirements with UDC's and LDC's.

Please send me the most current copy of your matrix that illustrates where we have existing bonds in place, what drives the capacity requirements, status, renewal / expiration date, current payment status, etc.  I would like to make sure that we are all clear on how these work, what triggers increases / decreases in capacity, and other issues impacting our ability to continue to flow electricity and natural gas to our clients.

Thanks - Dan

EES received a margin call for $4.3MM on Nov 19th from Niagara Mohawk for EES gas business to cover settlement and imbalance risk for NIMO's "Supplier Select" Program.  The Enron Corp. gaurantee is no longer acceptable at our current rating.  Legal has confirmed NIMO's rights under its gas tariff.

Please be sure to copy Jim Wood on all correspondence relating to bonds- from a product management standpoint, I think Jim needs to be aware of these issues as failure to maintain bonds will significantly impact our business. .  I still think that  we would want to have a single person responsible for reporting all potential situations that may cause a default /bad pr situation and  notify the EES office of the chairman  in a manner that would allow plenty of opportunity to cure ( i.e., before it is a crisis).  Gloria and Denise, will you take that on?

Gloria -

Could you please help us gather the facts on what the $12 MM Surety Bond currently being requested (#6131506) is for - is this PG&E?.  Mary informed me that funds ($36,000) may not be available, is this correct?  

It is my understanding that Credit, Services and Regulatory will be monitoring and processing bond requirements.  As such, I would like to know how this would impact EES' business and definitely want to be aware of any default situation prior to reading about it in the press.  

Thanks, 
Rogers

Update - 

this afternoon Kris, Sarah, Gloria and I talked with Bob Detonte and Carol Consolver from SoCal.  They will provide Kris with information reconciling imbalance data.  They clarified that imbalance trading will be reflected immediately, thus lessening our exposure.  They agreed to several changes in the contract including procedures for posting of margin.  They agreed to consider our requests to increase imbalance tolerance from $2.5 million to $10 million, and to scale the requirement according to our credit rating.  We expect an answer on these latter issues later today or early tomorrow.  The first reaction was that $10 million may be a "little too rich".

And the winner is .............. "me" to coordinate.  I have been leading with Legal and Trading.  Legal confirmed their right under the gas tariff (due to our downgrade).   Don's team, myself and the credit contact at NIMO reviewed the exposure calculation and believe it to be accurate at first review.  I am inquiring to a lock box to reduce the requirement by 50%.  Deadline to deliver is next Thursday, Nov 29th.

Harry/Gloria - could you please review their requirement?  NIMO is asking for collateral in effect to cover EES base load for the Supplier Select program, assuming EES does not deliver for 30 days and assuming the coldest day (in the past 30 years) which in effect mutiplies our load by a factor of 3.  However, NIMO has agreed to use forward Jan price in lieu of the past 12 months as stipulated in their tariff.

Molly

EES received a margin call for $4.3MM on Nov 19th from Niagara Mohawk for EES gas business to cover settlement and imbalance risk for NIMO's "Supplier Select" Program.  The Enron Corp. gaurantee is no longer acceptable at our current rating.  Legal has confirmed NIMO's rights under its gas tariff.

I found this table in one of the documents examined, that compares the ratings for different ISOs:
Company	Minimum Long Term Rating	Minimum Short-term rating	
CAISO	A3/A- for Market Obligations A1/P1 for Grid Management Charge	A2/P2 for Market Obligations A1/P1 for Grid Management Charge	
NEISO	"INVESTMENT GRADE" (equivalent BBB-)	"INVESTMENT GRADE" (equivalent A3)	
NYISO	BBB/Baa2	or equivalent	
PJM Interconnection	Based on PJM internal scoring system	Based on PJM internal scoring system	
Ontario IMO	BBB*	or equivalent*	

* The financial support obligation of a market participant may be reduced by a monetary value associated with a particular credit rating. AAA = 50 MM CAN$; AA = 25MM CAN$; A = 12.5 MM CAN$;and BBB = 5 MM CAN$. Interesting!

This table is current as of March 2000. Indeed, I think it might be a useful format to present the information found. Regards,

Also, just to make sure everyone is clear, Harry, Gloria, and Rebecca are on point during the next few weeks to ensure that that EES and/or EPMI responds timely to any request for info, additional security, or other utility matters.

Jim / Evan - 

As you are probably aware, the performance and surety bond market is difficult for us to navigate in and around in our current situation.  As an example, EFS has been shut out of getting access to new bid and performance / payments bonds for its business that requires these.  We are addressing this with the bonding companies now.  All of their existing bonds are in place and in force.

In light of this, I wanted to make sure that we are absolutely current in all aspects of all bonding requirements with UDC's and LDC's.

Please send me the most current copy of your matrix that illustrates where we have existing bonds in place, what drives the capacity requirements, status, renewal / expiration date, current payment status, etc.  I would like to make sure that we are all clear on how these work, what triggers increases / decreases in capacity, and other issues impacting our ability to continue to flow electricity and natural gas to our clients.

Thanks - Dan

Please find below the NYISO creditworthiness policy.  Please let me know if you have any question, or would like to revisit the original language.

NYISO Credit Policy
The NYISO has established the following creditworthiness policy to ensure that customer can meet its obligations and to protect against the risk of non-payment of invoices.  A summary of this policy is as follows:
1.	To assure credit worthiness, a NYISO customer may provide a cash deposit, an unconditional and irrevocable letter of credit (from an acceptable American or Canadian Bank with A credit rating from S&P, or A2 by Moody's), or obtain corporate guarantee from its parent company for all financial obligations under the tariffs; assuming that the parent company complies with credit ratings acceptable.  The amount of the instrument equals the sum of the customer's obligations to the NYISO for three months (the greatest over a rolling 12-month period).
2.	In lieu of cash deposits, letters of credit, or corporate guarantee, the customer must submit initially, and annually thereafter, a current debt-rating agency of a minimum of "BBB" or "Baa2" by SP, or Moody's respectively.  

3.	Any services provided under the Tariff may be terminated either immediately (for Service Tariffs) or upon 60 days prior notice (OATT) if the customer fails to demonstrate its creditworthiness.  
A NYISO customer must immediately inform the NYISO of any material change in its financial position.

Denise --

Do you have a listing of all bonds that EES (and its affiliates) has in place for retail marketing, including wholesale ISOs? Speaking with Gloria, we don't keep this information in Govt Affairs.  Rebecca Fite keeps bond information required in the State licensing processing.  The place that I think that is missing is Wholesale Service providers (e.g., ISOs).

I think that we need to expand this idea of Bonding to "Financial Guarantees" including with Utilities, States, and Wholesale Service Providers.

Maybe the best way to start is to work backwards from EES active markets and determine what is needed in each locale?

Thanks,

Jim

Please be sure to copy Jim Wood on all correspondence relating to bonds- from a product management standpoint, I think Jim needs to be aware of these issues as failure to maintain bonds will significantly impact our business. .  I still think that  we would want to have a single person responsible for reporting all potential situations that may cause a default /bad pr situation and  notify the EES office of the chairman  in a manner that would allow plenty of opportunity to cure ( i.e., before it is a crisis).  Gloria and Denise, will you take that on?

Could you please help us gather the facts on what the $12 MM Surety Bond currently being requested (#6131506) is for - is this PG&E?.  Mary informed me that funds ($36,000) may not be available, is this correct?  

It is my understanding that Credit, Services and Regulatory will be monitoring and processing bond requirements.  As such, I would like to know how this would impact EES' business and definitely want to be aware of any default situation prior to reading about it in the press.  

Thanks,

SPP wants all of our customers to be made aware of this change and we want 
to give each  a certain period of time to make the necessary adjustments in 
any areas that may be necessary. To this end SPP is attaching the new Credit

Credit Agreement and return it to SPP as soon as possible. 

SPP expects all customers to be compliant with the Credit Policy by December 
15, 2001. Please review the Credit Policy and take the necessary steps to be 
in compliance by that date so that there are no interruptions of service or 
your ability to make future reservations.

Jim-

We are working very hard to have an operational and reliable EDI environment in New York. So far, we are covering the three main billing scenarios (UDC-bill ready, UDC-rate ready and ESCO-bill ready) that we may choose and switch as needed. EDI billing is not ready yet but we expect having it implemented (testing included) at the most by May 2002. I'll keep you posted on the latest developments. Let me know if you need any questions. Thanks, Vinio

Subject:	RE: Enron's Security Review

The deposit will be in the form of a cash deposit, wired into ConEd's Chase Manhattan Bank today. I am working with ConEd to agree on the applicable interest rate.

We can dispute ConEd's data. However, I do not think this is a good time to do so because:
1. Unlike our calc, the ConEd calc is based on the summer peak for the customers (even when we factor that in, I think that the volumes used in ConEd's calc may still be too high - but I intend to raise that issue at a later time)
2. The number of customers EES has contracted as at today (6000 - unknown to ConEd), and who will soon be enrolled with ConEd makes any argument unecessary. Per the UBP rules, if the volumes increase by 10%, ConEd is entitled to request an increase in the deposit amount. Whenever they come back to us for more, we will dispute their data and hopefully reduce the dollar amount and/or at least buy ourselves more time. More time is important, as the EDI rules in NY will be complete first quater of next year. At that time, EES will change its billing option, the security requirement will be unecessary, and our deposit will be returned to us with interest.
3. I had negotiated with ConEd to suspend their billing cycle on our customers to give us time to work through this issue. This has revenue implications for them. Disputing their numbers will appear as a gimmick, would generate bad will, and will frustrate our future negotiations/relationship with them 

I will provide an update later in the day.

I was told Bradford would, "release the $1 million tomorrow."  I don't know what form.  I will find out.  

Also, regarding the usage - I do not know the answer.  Our numbers are systematically scraped directly off the ConEd website by account - I do not believe that any errors in this process could be consistently that low.  We pull actual data and site profile normalizes and calendarizes the data - Jeff probably is using the normalized info.  ConEd is likely using a design peak to maximize the deposit and ensure that even if we fail under design conditions they have sufficient security.  We could potentially use our data (their web data) to dispute their own calculation.

Gloria - can we dispute ConEd's calc based on the data we took from the website?  How tight is the approved deposit provision?

FYI. What form of security did we post the $1million? How does this amount change over time? Why do you think Con-Ed's consumption estimates are so different than ours?

Gloria,

The analysis performed by ConEd is based only on mass market customers with October start dates.  Looking at this set of customers, ConEd has estimated significantly higher consumption for our customers than Origination has calculated.  This is shown below, with the credit requirement calculated for 45 days during the summer peak.

			ConEd Calculation				Calculation using Origination Values
# of accounts		1,395						1,395
Peak Month MWh	8,993						5,694
Peak Month $		$539,616					$341,653

Electric 45 Day $	$809,424					$512,479
Nat Gas 45 Day $	$183,195					$183,195
Total 45 Day $		$992,620					$695,674       Difference $296,946

Extrapolating these figures out for all mass market customers signed as of today (6,000) with start dates between October and January, the credit requirements would be as follows:

			ConEd Calculation Extrapolated		Calculation using Origination Values
# of accounts		6,000						6,000
Peak Month MWh	38,681						29,232
Peak Month $		$2,320,930					$1,753,920

Electric 45 Day $	$3,481,395					$2,630,880
Nat Gas 45 Day $	$   787,936					$   787,936
Total 45 Day $		$4,269,331					$3,226,321    Difference $1,023,010

Using either calculation shows that are security requirement will very quickly be much higher than the $1 million currently being requested.  These values do not include additional mass market origination or the switching of existing financially served customers to physical service.  The conversion of existing financially served customers to physical service could easily add another $2 million.  

RAC needs to be aware that the $1 million will be a temporary fix and that the value will be much higher in the near future.

Thanks,
Jeff

Gloria,
As requested.  The method by which the $1 million security requirement for
agency billing on Enron Energy Services' current population is explained
below.  This is a consistent approach at calculating security requirements
for agency billing for ESCOs participating in our service territory.  If you
have questions, please let me know.  Thanks.

Could you please help us gather the facts on what the $12 MM Surety Bond currently being requested (#6131506) is for - is this PG&E?.  Mary informed me that funds ($36,000) may not be available, is this correct?  

It is my understanding that Credit, Services and Regulatory will be monitoring and processing bond requirements.  As such, I would like to know how this would impact EES' business and definitely want to be aware of any default situation prior to reading about it in the press.  

Thanks, 
Rogers

I apologize for my delay in responding to this.  I have two comments:

1) The Power Pool rules leave the ultimate decisions respecting credit requirements to the Power Pool Council (the independent body that oversees the Power Pool).  The chart that Amr has attached to his email outlines the guidelines the Power Pool Council normally follows - although they have the authority to increase or decrease any specific pool participant's trading limit. See attached excerpt Sec 2.6 - Prudential Requirements from Pool Rules

2) In understand Enron is now a BBB and therefore has a $10,000,000 trading limit per month in the Alberta Power Pool.  I can advise that I have spoken with Peter Keohane (Enron Canada VP and Asst General Counsel) and he is monitoring Enron Canada's credit obligations to all institutions and counterparties very closely.  With respect to the Alberta Power Pool, Peter advises that given our PPA position and the fact we are a net seller into the Pool he does not believe there is any cause for concern that the Power Pool will require us to post security under the present circumstances.  

Regards,

Rob

 
2.6 Prudential Requirements
2.6.1 Setting of Prudential Requirements
Council is responsible for determining what a participant must provide to the pool for
financial assurance.
A participant will meet and maintain such financial and other prudential requirements
as the Council deems appropriate to ensure that the participant is and remains of
sufficient financial standing to meet its financial obligations. The prudential
requirements include, without limitation, those set out in Schedule 3.
2.6.2 Review and Reassessment
A participant may be required to provide replacement or additional security.
The Council may review and reassess the adequacy of the financial security or credit
rating provided by a participant from time to time and may direct the participant to
provide replacement or additional financial security in accordance with its new
determination as to the adequacy of the prudential requirements for that participant.
The replacement or additional financial security must be provided within two business
days of the direction.

Subject:	Credit worthiness - Alberta



Please find below the creditworthiness criteria for Alberta Pool.  I appreciate the help of Fino and Guillermo.
  

The credit worthiness in Alberta determines the trading limits for each participant in relation to its bond rating as follows: 
Rating		trading limit
AAA		$25,000,000
AA		$20,000,000
A		$15,000,000
BBB		$10,000,000
<BBB		$0

Trading limit is a defined term and means the maximum financial obligation to which a participant is or is expected to be owing the pool administrator.   I am currently investigating of the current levels of our trading levels as that will determine the action required.  

If a participant's financial obligations are expected to exceed the trading limit , the participant must provide a payment in advance or other form of financial security.  This security may be in the form of a bank guarantee, letter of guarantee, irrevocable letter of credit, or cash deposits drawn on a Canadian Chartered Bank, trust company, credit union or other lending institution acceptable to Council in or for an amount determined by the pool administrator to be equal to the expected financial obligations in excess of the trading limit.

It is noteworthy that a rating with a plus or minus sign indicates the relative standing within the major rating categories (so A- is A).  An exception to this is a rating of BBB minus which falls in the <BBB category and therefore no unsecured credit is granted.  It is also noteworthy that participants are required to report any downgrading of the relevant corporate credit rating within 2 business days.

The Power Pool of Alberta requires participants to report any event of default for borrowed funds or a material adverse change in their financial position within 2 business days of said default or change.

The deposit will be in the form of a cash deposit, wired into ConEd's Chase Manhattan Bank today. I am working with ConEd to agree on the applicable interest rate.

We can dispute ConEd's data. However, I do not think this is a good time to do so because:
1. Unlike our calc, the ConEd calc is based on the summer peak for the customers (even when we factor that in, I think that the volumes used in ConEd's calc may still be too high - but I intend to raise that issue at a later time)
2. The number of customers EES has contracted as at today (6000 - unknown to ConEd), and who will soon be enrolled with ConEd makes any argument unecessary. Per the UBP rules, if the volumes increase by 10%, ConEd is entitled to request an increase in the deposit amount. Whenever they come back to us for more, we will dispute their data and hopefully reduce the dollar amount and/or at least buy ourselves more time. More time is important, as the EDI rules in NY will be complete first quater of next year. At that time, EES will change its billing option, the security requirement will be unecessary, and our deposit will be returned to us with interest.
3. I had negotiated with ConEd to suspend their billing cycle on our customers to give us time to work through this issue. This has revenue implications for them. Disputing their numbers will appear as a gimmick, would generate bad will, and will frustrate our future negotiations/relationship with them 

I will provide an update later in the day.

Thanks,
Gloria

The analysis performed by ConEd is based only on mass market customers with October start dates.  Looking at this set of customers, ConEd has estimated significantly higher consumption for our customers than Origination has calculated.  This is shown below, with the credit requirement calculated for 45 days during the summer peak.

			ConEd Calculation				Calculation using Origination Values

Nat Gas 45 Day $	$183,195					$183,195
Total 45 Day $		$992,620					$695,674       Difference $296,946

Extrapolating these figures out for all mass market customers signed as of today (6,000) with start dates between October and January, the credit requirements would be as follows:

			ConEd Calculation Extrapolated		Calculation using Origination Values
# of accounts		6,000						6,000
Peak Month MWh	38,681						29,232
Peak Month $		$2,320,930					$1,753,920

Electric 45 Day $	$3,481,395					$2,630,880
Nat Gas 45 Day $	$   787,936					$   787,936
Total 45 Day $		$4,269,331					$3,226,321    Difference $1,023,010

Using either calculation shows that are security requirement will very quickly be much higher than the $1 million currently being requested.  These values do not include additional mass market origination or the switching of existing financially served customers to physical service.  The conversion of existing financially served customers to physical service could easily add another $2 million.  

RAC needs to be aware that the $1 million will be a temporary fix and that the value will be much higher in the near future.

Thanks,

Gloria,
As requested.  The method by which the $1 million security requirement for
agency billing on Enron Energy Services' current population is explained
below.  This is a consistent approach at calculating security requirements
for agency billing for ESCOs participating in our service territory.  If you
have questions, please let me know.  Thanks.

EES received a margin call for $4.3MM on Nov 19th from Niagara Mohawk for EES gas business to cover settlement and imbalance risk for NIMO's "Supplier Select" Program.  The Enron Corp. gaurantee is no longer acceptable at our current rating.  Legal has confirmed NIMO's rights under its gas tariff.

One more.

- Washington Gas: EES has parental guaranty. Due to current financial status, Washington Gas has requested Bond instead. RAC contact indicated no bond available - EES has 30 days to respond.

A note on the Con-Ed - Services/Operations has a work around for the few Mid-market deals origination is closing which will prevent us from increasing our security (Straight Dual Billing). Mass Market volume increase will drive any security increase in this market.

Thanks,
Rebecca

Con Ed, request for $1 million security in lieu of parental guaranty:  complete.  $1 million sent prior to 11/14 deadline.  Request for additional security likely to come when Con Ed sees our increasing load.
SoCal Gas, request for margin sharing agreement in lieu of parental guaranty:  complete.  New contract signed and delivered 11/16.  Retail and wholesale gas desks to work together to avoid occurence of margin call for credit over $5 million daily.
Peoples Gas of IL, request for letter of credit for $40k in lieu of parental guaranty:  deferred.  Peoples agreed to suspend demand for l/c if further downgrade does not occur.
Virginia license for EES gas:  complete, for now.  Services served copy of application to other parties.  Their comments due back to VA SCC by Dec 7.
Maryland license for EEMC gas:  scheduled to be approved on provisional basis today.  MD PSC will be reviewing generic requirement that parental guarantees be unconditional, unlimited, and unrestricted.
Pennsylvania, request for update to EES and EPMI bonds and request for increase in EES bond from $250k to $3.8m:  Under review.  New bond language has been sent to Mary Grisaffi.  Trying to whittle down (or eliminate) increase.
CG&E, request for deposit associated with Transmission Service Agreement:  being processed.  Service request reduced from 100 MW to 25 MW to reduce cash outlay.

After talking with Dan, I intend to set up a meeting to provide complete matrices on licensing and utility contracts sometime early during the week beginning Dec 3.  

Also, just to make sure everyone is clear, Harry, Gloria, and Rebecca are on point during the next few weeks to ensure that that EES and/or EPMI responds timely to any request for info, additional security, or other utility matters.  This, of course, will continue to require help from legal, credit, and operations.

If anyone has any other questions, please give me a call.

Jim / Evan - 

As you are probably aware, the performance and surety bond market is difficult for us to navigate in and around in our current situation.  As an example, EFS has been shut out of getting access to new bid and performance / payments bonds for its business that requires these.  We are addressing this with the bonding companies now.  All of their existing bonds are in place and in force.

In light of this, I wanted to make sure that we are absolutely current in all aspects of all bonding requirements with UDC's and LDC's.

Please send me the most current copy of your matrix that illustrates where we have existing bonds in place, what drives the capacity requirements, status, renewal / expiration date, current payment status, etc.  I would like to make sure that we are all clear on how these work, what triggers increases / decreases in capacity, and other issues impacting our ability to continue to flow electricity and natural gas to our clients.

Thanks - Dan

Rebecca, Craig - I talked to Mr. Shurkis from the PA PUC and he asked that we update these license-related forms.  I told him we plan on preserving the contracts in their current form at least up through completion of the acquisition (and hopefully beyond with a name change).  Also, note the reference to the Clinton license.  Gloria is available to help with the submission and the Clinton request but let us know what you'd like us to do.

Also, back in May, 2001, the electric license of Clinton Energy Management
Services at Docket No. A-110104 was cancelled per a company request.
Clinton still has a license in Pennsylvania to sell natural gas supply
services at Docket No. A-125001.  Is that license still necessary,
considering that Enron Energy Services also has a license at A-125004?  Is
there someone in Enron who can make a formal request to cancel the Clinton

Please find the analysis for Ontario.  I would like to highlight Guillermo's conclusion.  To quote "As a BBB rated company, Enron should have been provided an allowable reduction in prudential support of $5 million.  According to the market rules (section 5.8.2), the announcement of being placed on "credit watch" would result in Enron being automatically downgraded to below BBB, which means that Enron no longer qualifies for an allowable reduction. Enron would need to replace the $5 million with additional prudential support within five business days."  

Please let me know if you have any question.

Please find attached the summary for credit worthiness for market participants in the five ISOs in the US (NYISO, NEPOOL, PJM, ERCOT, and CAISO), plus the two in Canada (Alberta and Ontario).  All the seminal documents to substantiate this report are also available centrally here at first request of any party.  
 

As per the advise of Alberto, I should have contacted you earlier last week to see if Houston could be of any help in compiling a similar resource for the UK, the Nordic Region, and Australia on similar lines to the report above.     If such report exists, kindly send a copy.

Gloria -

Could you please help us gather the facts on what the $12 MM Surety Bond currently being requested (#6131506) is for - is this PG&E?.  Mary informed me that funds ($36,000) may not be available, is this correct?  

It is my understanding that Credit, Services and Regulatory will be monitoring and processing bond requirements.  As such, I would like to know how this would impact EES' business and definitely want to be aware of any default situation prior to reading about it in the press.  

Thanks, 
Rogers

Jim,
I presume that both filings, the one on third party guarantees, and the one on lower credit ratings, were approved by FERC. Both were approved by the Board and both are in the ISO Tariff, the first is ammendment 36 and the second ammendment 29. I could not find the actual FERC order in the millions of hits in the very imperfect search engine of the CAISO. Please advise. Regards,
ALF

Amr,
The situation with the California ISO is complicated by the fact that they recently had to face a loss of creditworthiness from PG&E and Southern California Edison. In an ammendment to the the ISO Tariff, the ISO proposed revisions to the tariff that would in effect waive the sanctions ot the ISO Tariff's creditworhiness requeriments for certain entities that were creditworthy as of January 3, 2001 but were about to lose the Approved Credit Rating that established their creditworthiness. This only applies to purchases using their own generation and transmission, but opened a pandora box in the evaluation of creditworthiness for market participants in California. In addition, the ISO Tariff did not have procedures in place to admit guarantees from third parties to back energy, ancillary services and grid management charges. A process was incorporated to this effect recently to allow SCE and PG&E buy power backed by California Department of Water Resources.
In any event, each Scheduling Coordinator (SC), Utility Distribution Company (UDC) or Metered Subsystem (MSS) must maintain an approved Credit Rating or provide in favor of the ISO one fo the following forms of security for an amount to be determined by the SC, UDC or MSS in the form stated in the Tariff:
An irrevocable and unconditional letter of credit confirmed by a bank or financial institution reasonably acceptable to the ISO;
An irrevocable and unconditional surety bond posted by an insurance company reasonably acceptable to the ISO;
An irrevocable and unconditional guarantee which has and maintains an Approved Credit Rating;
A cash deposit standing to the credit fo an interested bearing escrow accoint maintained at a bank or financial institution designated by the ISO;
A certificate of deposit in the name of the ISO from a financial institution designated by the ISO; or
A payment bond certificate in the name of the ISO from a financial institution designated by the ISO;
Letters of credit, guarantees, surety bonds, payment bond certificates, escrow agreements and certificates of deposit shall be in such form as the ISO may reasonably require from time to time by notice to SC, UDCs or MSSs. SCs, UDCs or MSSs that do not maintain an approved credit rating will not be allowed to submit a schedule to the ISO, and the ISO will reject any schedule submitted if the security amount is not deposited. If an outstanding liability exceeds 90% of the required security amount, a notification by the ISO will be issued to cover the security within 15 days.
As of March 13, 2000, an approved credit rating with respect to market obligations, is defined as an entity maintaining at lest an A2/P2 (or equivalent) short-term issuer credit rating or a A3/A- (or equivalent) long-term credit rating from a national credit rating agency. Market obligations are Imbalance energy, Ancillary Services, Grid Operations Charge, Wheeling Access Charge, High Voltage Access Charge, Transition Charge, Usage Charges and FERC Annual Charges. I suppose day-ahead energy charges are also included since the dissolution of the PX, although I could not find an explicit reference to this issue in the regulations.
SCs, UDCs or MSSs  must maintain A1/P1 (or equivalent) short-term issuer credit rating for the Grid Management charges, or the charges the ISO makes to fund its operations.
If you have any questions, please let me know. Regards,
ALF

Ok thanks Mary.   I was wondering if it had been paid since the invoice has an "accounts payable" stamp.
