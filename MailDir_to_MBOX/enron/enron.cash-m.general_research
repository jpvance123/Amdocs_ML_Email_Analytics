5, 2001, union leaders from fourteen African countries signed a solidarity
message expressing disappointment over protracted salary negotiations with
their governments. The message urges African governments to keep promises
made to union workers in prior negotiations. Chief Government spokesman and
Information and Broadcasting Minister Vernon Mwaanga of Zambia described the

** - PENSION REFORM BECOMING A PRESSING GLOBAL ISSUE: On June 7, 2001, the
World Bank reported that pension reform is becoming an increasingly
important global issue for developing and high-income countries. Many
countries have basic pension plans in place; however, most only cover 10% to
30% of the working population and impose a heavy strain on economic
development. The World Bank favors a multi-pillar pension plan consisting of
minimal contribution by the lifetime poor, access to various financial
instruments for the large informal sector, and a diversified sector for
formal workers.  <mailto:david.w.ellis@bakernet.com>

Organisation of East Carribbean States (OCES), the International
Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) found excessive limitations on
the right to strike for many employees, evident workplace discrimination,
and non co-operation with the ILO. The report coincides with a review of
OECS trade policy by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and focuses on
respect for internationally recognised core labour standards in Antigua and

of the five exceptions stipulated in ILO Convention 29 concerning the
prohibition of forced labour. The issue, which is at the top of the agenda
at the current ILO annual conference, is also the subject of a new ICFTU
report. The ICFTU report states that from joint ventures of private
companies and public authorities to complete privatisation of the prison
system, penal institutions are increasingly being managed like fully-fledged
businesses to the detriment of their inmates, whose basic rights are
regularly violated. See " ICFTU Prison Labour Report

global trade union organisations condemned governments who are beginning to
accept the exploitation of child labour. Activitsts complain that
governments have become increasingly supportive of weakening international
commitments to eliminate child labour, by leaving millions of children in
the workforce and seeking trivial improvements in their working lives. The

** - EMPLOYER SUED IN WRONGFUL DEATH ACTION WITH INTERNATIONAL IMPLICATIONS:
In a recent wrongful death suit filed in the United States, an employer has
been joined in an action against its employee who allegedly struck and
killed a teenager while driving and making cell phone calls on company
business. In the first case of its kind, the victim's family sought to
extend an employer's liability to the actions of its employees while talking
on a cell phone about company business after business hours. The employer in
this case did not have a internal policy on cell-phone use. Cases such as
this and increased reliance on cell-phones and other remote technology are
prompting many employers to address this issue on an international basis.

and the employer's application of the policy was inconsistent with its
conduct elsewhere. The decision highlights the need for employers to be
careful of overreacting to trivial or technical breaches of email policies
and that they need to properly explain to employees what constitutes
inappropriate or offensive material for the purposes of their policy. See "

UK - SCOTTISH TEACHERS UNION VOTES TO BOYCOTT EXAM TESTING: On June 9, 2001,
members of Scotland's largest teaching union voted to boycott internal
assessments for students. The teachers expressed their dissatisfaction with
the new testing plans by voting to boycott the internal assessments, which
would put more emphasis on year-round pupil testing and require students
pass a minimum of three internal assessments before being allowed to sit for
the final exam. The teachers are concerned of the additional burden the
assessment plan puts on them as well as the students. See " Teachers Vote

UK - BRITISH GOVERNMENT FACES SETBACK ON WORKERS RIGHTS: On June 8, 2001,
the UK faced a setback as it became apparent that a European Union (EU)
proposal regarding workers' rights was going to pass, a proposal fiercely
opposed by British industry. Britain has been steadfastly opposed to the EU
proposal which would require employers with more than 50 workers to consult
their employees before announcing cutbacks. The British Government had been
able to keep the issue from gaining support within the European Commission
by forming an alliance with Germany, Denmark, and Ireland, but recent
remarks by representatives from Denmark and Germany make it likely that a
compromise may be reached in the near future allowing the proposal to pass.

held that because the SPD promised employees FMLA rights without any
jurisdictional requirement, and because the company acted as if the employee

an enforceable contract that gave the employee the right to request leave

US - BIRTHDATES MAY BE USED AS TIEBREAKER IN AWARDING PROMOTIONS: The U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit recently upheld Chicago's use of
employees' birthdates as a tiebreaker in making certain promotion decisions.
The court determined that the city's practice of promoting the older
employee with the same credentials and seniority was not discriminatory. The
court noted that using date of birth as a tie breaker promoted a uniform
policy and was widely accepted as fair. See " Birthday Tie-Breaker

TESTIMONY ABOUT CULTURE OF AGE DISCRIMINATION: In a decision issued on June
15, 2001, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed a
district court's dismissal of an age discrimination lawsuit, despite
deposition testimony by a supervisory employee (who had his own age
discrimination lawsuit against the employer) that the employer had a culture
promoting age discrimination and that the plaintiff and other older workers
were not given the same opportunities as younger workers for choice
assignments. The court held that this "kind of vague, speculative evidence
by an employee with his own axe to grind has too little probative value to
make out a prima facie case of discrimination." See " Kadas v. MCI

VIOLATION: Wal-Mart has asked U.S. District Court Judge William Browning in
Tucson, Arizona to reconsider his June 13, 2001 order finding Wal-Mart in
contempt of court for not complying with a consent decree in a lawsuit
against the retailer for disability discrimination. The court ordered
Wal-Mart to make a 30-second television commercial admitting it violated the
Americans With Disabilities Discrimination Act ("ADA") and air it for two
weeks on major Arizona stations. As a result of the consent decree, in
January of 2000, Wal-Mart hired two deaf employees and paid them back wages
and damages. Wal-Mart also hired a sign-language interpreter during a two
week training period for the employees. However, Wal-Mart was found in
contempt of court when it failed to train supervisors on the ADA and had not
inserted a sign-language interpreter into corporate training videos. See "

US - FEDERAL APPEALS COURT REINSTATES ARBITRATOR'S RULING THAT ORDERED
SEXUAL HARASSER BACK TO JOB: An arbitrator did not violate public policy or
exceed his authority by reinstating a Texas factory worker who had been
discharged for sexually harassing female employees, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled June 7, 2001 . The court stressed that
the pertinent issue was not whether the worker's sexual harassment of female
co-workers itself violates public policy, but rather, whether the collective
bargaining agreement, as interpreted by the arbitrator, does so. In
reversing the lower court's ruling that vacated the arbitration award, the
Court found that there was no explicit, well-defined, dominant public policy
contrary to the arbitrator's decision. See " Arbitrator's Ruling

I am sending you several updates from our  firm.

You can access the documents by clicking on the links provided.  If you have
difficulty accessing these documents, please contact me and I can send you a
hard copy. In addition, feel free to forward these materials to others
within your organization or others at different companies or organizations.
If you do not wish to receive these notices, contact me by a reply to this
email and I will delete you from my circulation list.

The first update that I am sending is a publication regarding the E-Sign Act
which took effect on October 1, 2000 and which allows electronic signatures
to be legally binding.  Many employers have utilized this statute to move
toward a "paperless" workplace and place all personnel documents on-line.
This article addresses the requirements of the act and gives helpful
insights into steps to take to move to a paperless workplace.  Please click
on the following link to access this article.

http://www.littler.com/publications/art_paperless_office.html
<http://www.littler.com/publications/art_paperless_office.html>

The second update is an ASAP from our firm prompted by the recent death of
Korey Stringer, an offensive lineman for the Minnesota Vikings.  This ASAP
underscores the need for employers to be aware of (and have procedures in
place to deal with) the dangers of heat stress for their employees.

<http://www.littler.com/nwsltr/asap_heatstress.html>

Also, here is a notice regarding our upcoming Texas Employer conferences.
This year we are adding a half day conference in Austin to our regular
conferences in Houston and Dallas.




Finally, I also wanted to alert you to recent developments at the IRS.
The IRS has basically been out of the independent contractor examination
business for over five years. THE END IS NEAR. As the IRS has been
completing its reorganization, the Commissioner has moved such "1099"
examinations up to the being the IRS's number 2 priority. Currently there
are some 7000 IRS Revenue Agents (auditors) undergoing training in Dallas on
independent contractor audit techniques. The IRS has been authorized to hire
another 4000 new Revenue Agents, who should be turned loose over the next 6
months.

Earlier this year the IRS announced a more aggressive pursuit of criminal
prosecutions against "employers" who have failed to timely remit payroll
taxes as well as potential civil and criminal prosecution of taxpayers who
have claimed to be exempt from payroll taxes. See my earlier emails on those
issues.

What triggers status audits?

Sources of audits most typically come from a computer check of 1099misc
which show a high ratio of 1099 to W-2 forms issued. State audits are most
often triggered by referral from IRS regarding 1099misc or an unemployment
claim filed by a former contractor. Tips provided by disgruntled former
contractors are often a source of state audits. Adverse IRS SS-8 rulings may
now become another source of audit leads. Both the states and IRS often
target certain industries. For awhile in Southern California the intermodal
trucking industry was in the IRS's radar. All agencies love the "new
economy" as the high tech industry is now infamous for acting without
considering the fine points. The California EDD has been touring Silicon
Valley in recent years and inflicting major wounds almost everywhere it has
landed.

What should you be doing?

Well, this is a good time for a self-audit. If there is a problem, minimally
you should consider at least changing business practices going forward, if
not taking corrective action. Boilerplate independent contractor agreements
should be reviewed, not only to reflect state and federal standards (which
haven't really changed it is simply that the sleeping dragon is awakening)
but to make sure that the contractual provisions reflect the reality of the
working relationship and that such relationship is truly an independent
contractor arrangement. A well drafted independent contractor agreement is
simply good prose unless the operational relationship reflects it. A poorly
drafted agreement or one inconsistent with reality will be deadly.

What is at stake here?

When there has been a "misclassification" as to workers' status, both the
state and IRS can come in and collect all the payroll taxes that should have
been taken out to begin with. The normal audit window is three years or 12
quarters (in CA). At the state level that may include income taxes and
special employee-paid taxes (like SDI) as well as employer-paid taxes like
unemployment. At the federal level there is income taxes as well as social
security and Medicare (uncapped) taxes (both the employee and employer's
share) and employer-paid FUTA.

As a general rule it doesn't matter that the worker paid income and other
taxes as a self-employed person. The government may double dip. While there
are procedures for abating the income tax portion of an assessment, the
employer has to get an affidavit from the subject workers, who are seldom
motivated to be cooperate. A worst case scenario could regulate in combined
state and federal payroll tax liabilities 30 to 40% of compensation paid and
that isn't inclusive of potential penalties and interest.

What can we do to Help You?

We can, with respect to employment status audits, do a number of things.

1. Proactively, we work with clients (and their accountants) to conduct a
self-audit of their use of such workers; identify areas that need to be
altered; revise standard agreements; help create checklists for evaluating
the appropriateness of engaging in an independent contractor relationship.

2. If you receive an audit notice (state or federal), we can represent
(upfront or behind the scenes) you  in preparing for and/or during an audit
and we can handle administrative appeals, Tax Court and District Court
appeals too.

3. For companies with criminal tax issues or deficiencies regarding the
remittance of employment taxes, the IRS (and the state) can go after the
employees responsible on a personal level, as a "responsible person/party?"
An employee may be personally accountable for a 100% penalty equal to the
taxes and interest that the employer failed to remit. We have access to a
number of highly qualified tax attorneys that are available to work with
clients on criminal and responsible party controversies.

in employment and labor matters. With approximately 400 lawyers in 31

the case at issue announced that he would go on sick leave for at least
three months. The following day he submitted a medical certificate, stating
he had a tumor on his hand. The tumor, however, would not necessarily have
kept the employee from working. The court therefore held that the employee's
behaviour was clearly an attempt to "punish" the employer and that it
therefore would justify a termination for cause. See " Threat Of

AGREEMENTS: The German Federal Labour Court recently ruled on that in case
of a transfer of business, shop agreements applicable to the buyer's company
do not necessarily supersede other collective regulations applicable to the
employees of the acquired company. In the respective case, the buyer
acquired a company that was previously bound by a collective bargaining
agreement that provided for annual extra payments. The buyer was not a
member of the respective employers' association and therefore not bound by
the respective collective bargaining agreement. The court ruled, however,
the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement became part of the
individual employment contracts of the employees in accordance with the
German Civil Code. Since the acquired company was located in another city
than the buyer's company, provisions of the collective bargaining agreement
were also not superseded by shop agreements applicable to the buyer's
company. According to the Court, these shop agreements are applicable only
to the employees of the respective plant location but not to the employee of
the acquired company. See " Transfer  <http://bundesarbeitsgericht.de/> of

FR - ALARMING INCREASE IN UNEMPLOYMENT IN FRANCE: Although the unemployment
rate in France increased nearly 1.9% in July of 2001, the French Government
recently indicated that it remains confident of the future and that
"evolution perspectives for 2002 remain positive." "Growth should be higher
than it is now," indicates the French Employment Ministry. These statistics
are an indication that the non-stop increase in unemployment since May of
2001 requires a "reinforced mobilization of everybody." Indeed, as noted by
the Ministry of Employment, France is affected by "the slow-down of economic
activity," even if it is "less affected than its European partners."

situation, the Court questioned the wisdom of the law, stating that "(i)t
seems inconceivable that any legislator would actually have intended to

it has channeled all of its resources into reacting to the problems caused
by the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, D.C. The U.S.
Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), which was charged with
issuing the new rules, has been extensively involved in the recovery efforts
at the World Trade Centers and the Pentagon. See " OSHA:

US - TEXAS COURT RULES FORMER EMPLOYEE NOT LIABLE FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM
INTERNET MESSAGE POSTINGS: The Texas Court of Appeals recently ruled that an
employer could not show non-economic damages resulting from a former
employee's internet posting of messages about his employer. Express One
International, a freight and charter airline, sued a former company pilot
for posting messages regarding the company on internet message boards in the
midst of a labor dispute. The company sought damages for the cost of
identifying the message poster, the proceedings before the National
Mediation Board, the cost of dealing with the message postings, and their
effect on the union election. The trial court awarded summary judgment for
the former employee, and the appellate court affirmed the decision. See "

US - BANS ON WORKPLACE LANGUAGE NOW LIMITED IN CALIFORNIA: On September 12,
2001, California approved legislation under which, effective January 1,
2002, it is unlawful for an employer to adopt or enforce a policy that
limits or prohibits the use of any particular language in any workplace
except under specific circumstances. Under the new California Government
Code Section 12951, the restriction must be justified by business necessity.
The employer also must notify its employees of the circumstances and the
time when the language restriction is required to be observed and the
consequences for violating the restriction. For the purposes of this
section, "business necessity" means an overriding legitimate business
purpose such that the language restriction is necessary to the safe and
efficient operation of the business, that the language restriction
effectively fulfills the business purpose it is supposed to serve, and there
is no alternative practice to the language restriction that would accomplish
the business purpose equally well with a lesser discriminatory impact. See "

U.S. law, the excess of the fair market value of the stock received over the
amount paid by the employee to exercise a nonqualified stock option is
included in Box 1 of Form W-2 in addition to wages and other compensation.
The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) had previously announced that stock
option income would need to be separately identified (as Code V) on the Form
W-2 and also included in Boxes 1 and 12 of the Form W-2 effective for the
preparation of the 2001 Form W-2; a subsequent IRS announcement delayed the
effective date. The most recent IRS announcement (2001-92) further delays
the effective date so that mandatory reporting begins with the 2003 Form W-2

er the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best inter=
ests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or procee=
ding, had no reasonable cause to believe the person's conduct was unlawful.=
 The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, sett=
lement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, sh=
all not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in goo=
d faith and in a manner which the person reasonably believed to be in or no=

y criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that the p=
erson's conduct was unlawful.=20

(b) A corporation shall have power to indemnify any person who was or is a =
party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or com=
pleted action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a ju=

 (2) by a committee of such directors designated by majority vote of such d=

tten opinion, or (4) by the stockholders.=20

(e) Expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by an officer or director=
 in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, =
suit or proceeding may be paid by the corporation in advance of the final d=
isposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertakin=
g by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it sh=
all ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemni=
fied by the corporation as authorized in this section. Such expenses (inclu=
ding attorneys' fees) incurred by former directors and officers or other em=
ployees and agents may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, a=

ement of expenses may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of stock=
holders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in such =
person's official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holdi=

lude, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation=
 (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation o=

THERE ARE SEVERAL FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED IN INDEMNIFICATION FOR ATTORNEYS=
' FEES: (a) The time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the =
questions involved, and the skill requisite to perform the legal service co=
mpetently, (b) the likelihood that a particular retainer will preclude othe=
r employment by the attorney, (c) the fee customarily charged in the commun=

 results obtained, (e) the time limitations imposed by the litigation, (f) =
the nature and length of professional relationship with the client, (g) the=
 experience, reputation and ability of the lawyer performing the services, =
and (h) a consideration whether the fee is fixed or contingent. Galdi v. Be=

The following EEAC Mailings have been added to the O:\HR\OLER\Everyone\EEAC Mailings\2001 Mailings Directory.
 
01-174  Mandatory Resurvey of Incumbent Employees Is Likely in Light of New Federal "Multiple Race" Data Standards; EEAC Offers Some Practical Pointers for Preparing Now <http://www.eeac.org/private/01-174.pdf>  In this second in a series of special memoranda designed to help member companies prepare for converting to the federal government's new race and ethnicity data standards, EEAC discusses issues relevant to an expected requirement to resurvey incumbent employees. 

01-173  EEOC Withdraws Controversial "Erie County" Guidance on ADEA and Retiree Health Benefits <http://www.eeac.org/private/01-173.pdf>  New EEOC Chair Cari Dominguez, in one of her first official acts, joined with her two Commission colleagues in voting to rescind a controversial EEOC position on retiree health benefits that many agree was causing employers to stop offering them. 

01-172  The Vexing "Applicant" Issue: EEAC Policy Paper Recommends New Approach to Monitoring Internet-Based Recruitment and Selection Practices for Adverse Impact <http://www.eeac.org/private/01-172.pdf>  EEAC's new policy paper addresses the issue of "who is an applicant?" in today's electronic recruiting environment. The paper makes recommendations to key government enforcement agencies, including EEOC and OFCCP, on a less burdensome system for monitoring the modern recruitment and selection process that is in line with applicable legal standards. 

01-171  Workplace Homicides Increased in 2000 After Six-Year Decline <http://www.eeac.org/private/01-171.pdf>  Workplace deaths due to acts of violence went up last year, reversing a six-year declining trend. The number nevertheless was still well below the five-year average from 1995-99. 

01-170  Federal Courts Tending To Put Greater Burden on ADA Plaintiffs Who Allege They Are Substantially Limited in the Major Life Activity of "Working" <http://www.eeac.org/private/01-170.pdf>
The federal courts have been less than receptive to ADA plaintiffs who try to establish the law's protection by relying on "working" as the major life activity in which they claim to be substantially limited. 

01-169  EEAC's Analysis of EEOC Charge Data Shows Across-the-Board Climb in Harassment Charges Over Last Ten Years <http://www.eeac.org/private/01-169.pdf>  Our analysis of data provided by EEOC confirms what many member companies already suspected: the number of harassment charges filed with the agency in all categories is going up, both in raw numbers and as a percentage of all charges filed.

Can't remember if I ever shared this with you two.  (Michelle, Dusty sent this following one of the GSP conversations)

Subject:	Leased Employee Memorandum


Cynthia:  Attached (for  your reading enjoyment when you are REALLY bored) is a memorandum summarizing  the "leased employee rule" under section 414(n) of the Internal Revenue  Code.  As I mentioned, the "recordkeeping exception" outlined in the memo  and in the attached chart (if you meet the requirements) will keep you from  having to track leased employees, related hours, etc.  In addition, the  recordkeeping exception gets you out of the requirement to grant participation  and vesting service credit in the case of any temp/contractor who is later hired  by Enron as a regular employee, which you otherwise have to do.  Let me  know if you have any questions.  Dusty  Burke.

Subject: HR WAREHOUSE is here!!!


Are you boiling over with frustration,=20
knowing that you are having to  constantly reinvent the wheel?
Are you bursting with new ideas, programs and processes that make your job =
easier for you and/or better for your clients?
=20
=20
=20
=20
=20
Well, you now have a way to share them with others in the HR Community, and=
 enjoy the fruits of their labor as well...
=20
=20
THE HR WAREHOUSE
=20
To access, just open MS Word, go to the "O" Drive, open the "HR" Folder,=20
and you will see the "HR Warehouse" folder.
In it, you will find 3 additional folders:
- HR Business Units=20
(where each BU can include info. on their business,=20
programs they are using, or anything else they would like to share with the=
 HR Community)
-HR Practices=20
(which will include info. about Compensation,=20
Employee Relations, FAQ's, HR Forms & Templates, and much more!)
-Research & Communication=20
(which will include helpful HR links and a parking lot for HR-related quest=
ions!).
=20
=20
IN ORDER FOR THIS TO BE EFFECTIVE,=20
PEOPLE WILL NEED TO ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE IN THE SHARING OF IDEAS AND ACCESS=
ING OF THE SYSTEM ON A REGULAR BASIS. =20
OTHERWISE, THE HR WAREHOUSE IS NOTHING MORE THAN A COLLECTION OF EMPTY FOLD=
ERS.

The New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission (IRC) has ordered
internet giant Yahoo! to make available share options and boost the notice
period given to a dismissed executive. The former employee won more than
AU$400,000 after the IRC found that his contract was unfair and the period
of notice of termination provided to the executive unreasonable. The IRC
rewrote the salesperson's contract to give him access to options that vested
in January and February of 1999 when the share price was significantly
higher than the current price. See " Shane Mitchell-Calvert v Yahoo! Inc.

AU - COURT DENIES PRIORITY TO SOME SEVERANCE PAYOUTS IN REDUNDANCY: A recent
decision of the New South Wales Supreme Court could prevent employees of
insolvent companies being paid a severance payment on redundancy in priority
to ordinary unsecured creditors. The Court found that any order for
severance payments made after a worker's employment was terminated would not
qualify as a "priority payment" under the Corporations Law which gives
priority to severance payments over other unsecured debts when a company is
being wound up. The Court found that claims and debts must exist at the
termination of employment to be entitled to priority. See: " Madden v
Fisher.

AU - AUSTRALIAN UNIONS REBUILDING THEIR IMAGE: A recent survey commissioned
by the New South Wales Labour Council, the main trade union body, and
conducted by the Australian Centre for Industrial Relations Research and

AU - LOW WAGES AND HIGH PRODUCTIVITY ARE THE KEY TO AUSTRALIA'S LOW
INFLATION: A recent paper published by the Reserve Bank of Australia says
that decentralization of wage fixing and productivity growth in the 1990's
have been key elements in Australia's current low inflation economic
environment. Key influences in this environment are the end of comparative
wage justice which required the preservation of pay relativities by
Industrial Tribunals. This has allowed high wage growth areas to remain
isolated. See " Changes In The Determinants Of Inflation In Australia

Government recently enacted reforms aimed at reducing the government-run

groups who have organized several strikes against the new laws which they
say will reduce workers pay-outs. As a result, a judicial inquiry into the

had mixed results, but where it was done as part of a strategic
re-organization to re-focus and improve a business, it has a much less
negative effect on employees. See " Downsizing In Australia

IDminimum - LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL MINIMUM WAGE LAWS CONFLICT: Existing
Indonesian law, Staatsblad 1925 No. 647, prohibits children under 14 years
old from working from 8 p.m. until 5 a.m. This law generally has been
interpreted to mean that children under 14 years old can work outside those
hours. However, in 1999, Indonesia ratified ILO Convention No. 138 of 1973
on the Minimum Age for Admission to Employment, which stipulates that the
minimum age for child labour is 15 years old. The convention was ratified by
local law No. 20 of 1999 and therefore supercedes law 647 and as such the
minimum working age in Indonesia is 15 and not 14 years of age. See "

retail summer sales in August of 2001. Cause for the conflict is in
particular the 2.7% salary increase already agreed upon. Whilst workers wish
the increases to be granted with retroactive effect as of May of 2001,
employers tend to suspend salary increases for some months in view of the
lower purchasing power in Germany. See " Threatening Strikes in Thuringia

Although a Massachusetts iron mill violated the National Labor Relations Act

direct dealing as well as the company's unilateral implementation of new

US - UNION RALLY DAY BEFORE ELECTION DID NOT VIOLATE NLRB RULE: The National
Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has a longstanding rule that employers and
unions are prohibited from making election speeches on company time to
massed assemblies of employees within 24 hours of a union certification
election. In a decision issued on July 20, 2001, the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Eleventh Circuit ruled that this rule was not violated when a union
had a rally across the street from the employer's facility and broadcast
pro-union music and speeches using bullhorns and a public address system.
The court noted that the eligible voters were unable to hear the exact words
of the speeches and were able to go about their business during the rally.

US - 1.3 MILLION AMERICAN OFFICE BUILDINGS HAVE AIR QUALITY PROBLEMS: Recent
reports have focused on concerns that office buildings are circulating low
quality air which causes employees to become ill. During tough economic
times, building owners often neglect necessary repairs and maintenance that
results in microbial growth in humidifiers, dust and dirt buildup, and
contamination of air intake vents. Improperly maintained air-cooling towers
can collect standing water and breed bacteria such as Legionella, which
causes Legionnaire's disease, a form of pneumonia that infects 10,000 to
15,000 Americans annually. Earlier in 2001, Ford Motor Co. shut down a
facility for one week after five employees contracted the disease, which may
have originated from bacteria in the plant's HVAC system. See "

Supreme Court recently levied maximum fines on Esso Australia for breaches

The blast in September of 1998 killed 2 employees and injured eight others.

penalties. See: " DPP  <http://www.ecruiting.com.au/express/esso300701.htm>

include in immigration reform legislation. The list includes the following:

afforded the right to organize and form unions; and (3) guestworker programs
should not be expanded. See " Immigration Reform

US - LOUISIANA SHIPYARD ORDERED TO PAY US$10 MILLION AWARD AND REINSTATE
WORKERS FIRED DURING 6-YEAR ANTI-UNION CAMPAIGN: In one of the largest
awards ever obtained against an employer accused of wrongfully running an
anti-union campaign, Louisiana based shipyard Avondale Industries (owned by
Northrop Grumman) was recently ordered by an administrative law judge of the
National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to pay US$10 million in legal fees,
back pay, and benefits, and to reinstate 22 workers who were fired during
the company's 6-year anti-union campaign. In addition, the employer was
ordered to publish the NLRB order in the primary New Orleans newspaper once
a week for a month. The case arose out of interrogations, warnings, layoffs
and firings conducted by the company after its 4,100 employees voted in 1993
to be unionized by the New Orleans Metal Trades Council. See " Fine For
Union Busting <http://www.aflcio.org/news/2001/0719_avondale.htm> ."

AU - COURT RULING QUESTIONS EMPLOYER ANTI-DISCRIMINATION OBLIGATIONS: A
recent decision of the Victorian Supreme Court challenges key tenets of
Australian anti-discrimination laws and overturns a record AU$161,000
damages award. The Court found that the provision of a modem and a fax
machine sought by an editor to allow her to work from home to care for a
sick child was a "favor" rather than a "reasonable accommodation." The
decision raises the prospect of employers having a lesser obligation than
previously required to make a reasonable accommodation for employees with a
disability or caring responsibilities. The Court found that it would often
be the case that making a reasonable accommodation would not extend to
meeting the "very special needs of people who have recurrently sick
dependants." See " State of Victoria v Schou

announced it would cut 14,700 jobs, approximately 4% of its workforce, as a
result of the global technological slowdown. Of the 14,700 job cuts, 10,200
would be from Japan with the remaining 4,500 coming from overseas
operations. The sudden worldwide drop in demand for computers and mobile
phones prompted the job cuts, which Hitachi hopes will save 120 billion yen
(US1$ billion). See " Japan <http://sg.news.yahoo.com/010831/1/1dylw.html>

it is unlawful to discriminate against part-time workers in favor of

notice whenever and wherever it wants. For example, a notice is not void
because it was given on Christmas day. A dismissal can be contrary to good
faith only in extreme situations. This is, for example, the case if the
employer gives notice at a particular moment in order to deliberately harm
the employee. According to these rules, the Court stated that it is not an
extreme situation when an employee is given notice only a few days after the
death of his spouse. See " Termination

UK - PHONING WORKERS AT HOME: Despite recent advice given by the UK
Institute of Management suggesting that contacting a worker at home may
amount to a breach of his or her right to privacy, many employment experts
have commented that there are occasions on which it is permissible, and
indeed desirable, to do this. This is because the "right to privacy" under
the Human Rights Act is a qualified right.

workers would leave their current job today if another better one came
along, the same proportion when the study was last taken during the 1999, a

this shows that employers have failed to improve the degree of loyalty with

were less likely to keep employees than a workplace culture that trained
employees for advancement and created an atmosphere of mutual respect. See "

US - CREATIVE EMPLOYEES BECOMING MORE VALUED ON ASSEMBLY LINES: On September
5, 2001, industry analysts noted that ingenuity and independent thinking
have become more valued attributes for U.S. assembly line workers. According
to the analysts, historically many assembly workers were encouraged to
"leave their brains at the door," but recent changes in leadership methods
and a desire to increase productivity have encouraged employers to treat
assembly line workers as more involved workers. The analysts credit a
combination of the desire for increased productivity, union efforts, and the
influence of Japanese methods of workplace improvements for the movement
towards a more involved assembly line. See " Workplace: Creative Employees

Federal Trade Commission Announces Broad Privacy Agenda
 and Promises Strict Enforcement Online and Offline

In a long-awaited address to Privacy 2001, FTC Chairman Timothy Muris has
announced a new, wide ranging privacy agenda and promised to increase
enforcement of privacy standards both online and offline.

It has been unclear for some time just how the Bush Administration would
approach consumer privacy in the US, and there has been speculation in the
wake of the September 11 attacks that this agenda item, once so commonly
discussed, would take a back seat to public security concerns.  In his
speech on October 4, 2001, Chairman Muris announced that as part of getting
back to business, it was time to focus on "individual privacy in the
commercial realm and on what the FTC itself can do."  Assuring consumers
that privacy promises will be taken seriously, Muris promised to "increase
our enforcement of laws protecting consumer privacy."

Importantly, Chairman Muris announced that the FTC would not itself propose
new legislation to accomplish the FTC's privacy goals (though there are
dozens of bills pending in the 107th Congress addressing consumer privacy
which their advocates vowed to continue to push).  Instead, the clear
message of his address was that the FTC would use existing laws, regulations
and standards to achieve the FTC's privacy agenda.  The chairman made a
point of stating that the FTC's role would no longer be limited to online
concerns as has been the case since the FTC began studying online privacy in
1995.  Instead, due to the convergence of online and offline information
systems, the FTC would expand its activities to consumer privacy issues,
wherever they may arise.

FTC Privacy Agenda

The FTC Chairman issued a 12-point "Privacy Agenda."  Key points that likely
are of most interest to the business community include:

	1.	Enforcement of Privacy Promises.  FTC will step up its
enforcement under Section 5 of the FTC Act, which will include inappropriate
information transfers under the guise of bankruptcy or reorganizations; it
will also enforce compliance with the US-EU Safe Harbor Privacy Program.
	2.	Encouragement of Consumer Complaints.  Part and parcel of
its enforcement through the FTC Act, the FTC will make the complaint process
more consumer-friendly.
	3.	Enforcing the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.  The FTC will
"undertake enforcement efforts to ensure that financial institutions comply
with the law and will implement an outreach program to increase consumer
awareness of the [privacy] notices."  The FTC also will increase its
enforcement against pretexting, by seeking injunctions against information
brokers.  (Pretexting involves fraudulently obtaining personal financial
information by individuals calling financial institutions under the
"pretext" of being a customer.)
	4.	Enforcing the Fair Credit Reporting Act.  The FTC will "step
up its efforts" to ensure that consumers are advised of reasons for the
denial of credit and that information in their credit files is accurate.
	5.	Amendment of Telemarketing Sales Rule.  The FTC will amend
the Telemarketing Sales Rule to allow consumers to make a single call to
remove their names from telemarketing lists by creating a national
"do-not-call list."  Rule revisions also will include limitations on the
misuse of names and credit card numbers already in possession of
telemarketing companies.
Other items on the FTC's new Privacy Agenda include:
	*	Increased efforts to eliminate fraudulent and deceptive
SPAM.
	*	Stronger enforcement of the Children's Online Privacy
Protection Act (COPPA).
	*	Assistance to victims of identity fraud, and stepped up
prosecution of perpetrators.
	*	Conduct of workshops to evaluate compliance with privacy
laws and self-regulation standards, and evaluation of improved means for
assuring information security.

To achieve the FTC's new agenda, Chairman Muris announced an increase of 50%
in its privacy enforcement staff, from 37 to 52.

No Need for More Legislation - At Least for Now

Despite promises of stepped-up enforcement of privacy standards, Chairman
Muris announced that he thought it was still too early to assess the
effectiveness of existing legislation and industry self-regulation on
privacy concerns.   He rejected, at least for now, new legislation, saying
that "[a]t this time, we need more law enforcement, not more laws."

Nevertheless, Muris clearly has not been impressed with certain industry's
compliance with existing law.  Regarding the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, he
said:  "Acres of trees died to produce a blizzard of barely comprehensible
privacy notices. . . We can do better."  To address this and other
compliance issues, the FTC will hold a compliance workshop in Washington,
D.C., in December, where the FTC will review compliance experience before
new legislation is proposed.

Further Developments
We will continue to monitor the privacy agenda announced by the FTC.  Please
let us know if you would like to be advised of further developments in this
area.

responsibilities of the trade union. The planned revisions to the Trade
Union Law would establish the protection of employees' legal rights and
benefits as the main mission of trade unions. Unions would also be directed
to negotiate and work to meet employees' "reasonable" demands if employees
stop working or institute a work slowdown. The revisions also would

Non-governmental labour dispute conciliation groups have established the
"Labour Dispute Arbitration Association of the Republic of China" (LDAA)
which is scheduled to start by the end of 2001. This is the first labour
dispute arbitration institute established by law in Taiwan. According to

expenses and shorten the period needed to resolve labour disputes, the
arbitration procedure would not be initiated if any one party refuses. The
