Senate asked to hold Reliant in contempt over document release

SACRAMENTO (AP) - A Senate committee investigating possible price gouging in California's energy market voted unanimously Wednesday to ask the full Senate to find Houston-based Reliant Energy in contempt for failing to comply with a subpoena for documents. 
The decision came despite Reliant's last-ditch offer to turn over 10,000 documents under a contingent confidentiality agreement that the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation rejected.
"I'm not just trying to buy time," said Reliant attorney Charles J. Stevens. "We believe we have acted cooperatively. We believe we have a good-faith legal dispute." 
"It's clear you're trying to work with us. It's not contempt with contempt," agreed committee Chair Joseph Dunn, D-Santa Ana. 
By contrast, Sen. Steve Peace, D-Chula Vista, blasted Reliant's "shoddy behavior" before backing what he termed "a legally unprecedented step." 
If the full Senate imposes sanctions against Reliant, it will be the first time since 1929, when the Senate voted to jail reluctant witnesses during a committee investigation of price fixing and price gouging allegations involving cement sales to the state. 
There are no set penalties, said committee special counsel Laurence Drivon. By law, "the Senate can take such action as it deems necessary and appropriate." 
The contempt citation will be presented to the Senate Thursday, but will immediately be sent to the Rules Committee for another hearing before the full Senate acts, Dunn said. 
He said the committee had no choice but to seek the sanctions and likely force a court battle after it was unable to reach agreement with Reliant over the confidentiality of its documents. The committee voted 6-0 in favor of the contempt finding. 
"If we reach agreement on these issues, the process would be terminated immediately," Dunn said. 
In that light, the committee stepped back from its contempt vote last week against Enron Corp. after the company and committee moved closer to agreement over its release of thousands of documents stored in Texas. 
Enron sued the committee last week to stop the subpoena of its financial and electricity trading records. Among its objections are that only the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has the authority to investigate wholesale markets. 
Reliant, like Enron, had argued the company's financial papers are outside the committee's jurisdiction because most of its operations and paperwork are outside California. 
Atlanta-based Mirant Inc. also at least temporarily avoided a contempt citation by agreeing to turn over subpoenaed documents. The committee will review both companies' compliance in 30 days.

Calif. Senate Panel Votes To Cite Reliant With Contempt

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- A California Senate committee Wednesday voted to cite Reliant Energy (REI) with contempt because the company has refused to provide documents for an investigation into wholesale electricity prices in the state, said committee Chairman Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana. 
The committee also voted to forward a contempt charge for Enron Corp (ENE) to the full Senate, where it will be voted on. If the charge is approved, the Senate will vote on punishment, which could include hefty fines or incarceration of executives.
Talks between Enron and committee attorneys Monday seemed to indicate the company would agree to committee demands, but since then it has become clear the company doesn't plan to comply, Dunn said. 
"If you had asked two days ago I'd have said we are cautiously optimistic about Enron. Now I'm pessimistic about it. We felt they were indicating to us a willingness to do what the other generators were willing to do, but the bottom line is that they are not, despite their cooperative-sounding words. We are no closer to them coming into compliance than we were a week ago," Dunn said. 

The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation is requesting that Reliant and Enron provide 16 kinds of documents related to market behavior, rent a depository for the documents, and sign the committee's version of a confidentiality agreement. Both generators have refused to meet those demands, Dunn said. 
The committee will drop its contempt charges at any time before a full Senate vote if either generator agrees to its requests. 
A report detailing Enron's contempt charge will be sent to the full Senate on Thursday for introduction, but is expected to be referred to the Senate Rules Committee for review before a floor vote. 
Dunn said he didn't know how long the report would be considered in the Rules Committee, but he will "certainly push them to do it as soon as possible." 
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said the company "will continue to negotiate" with the committee. 
Legislators are scheduled to begin a monthlong break Friday, but aren't certain that will happen because they still need to pass a budget bill and are trying to approve a bill to rescue Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison before leaving. 
Dunn said it would take a few days to prepare a report on Reliant's contempt charge. 
"We may not be able to forward that report to the Senate floor until the day we get back from recess," Dunn said. 
No one at Reliant could be immediately reached for comment. 
The committee originally was poised to cite seven other electricity generators for contempt, but all eventually agreed to provide the requested information.

USA: UPDATE 1-Sempra looks to natgas lines to carry optic fiber.

07/18/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

SAN DIEGO, July 18 (Reuters) - A Sempra Energy unit said on Wednesday it has developed technology to connect thousands of miles of underused high-speed fiber-optic cable to buildings across the U.S. by inserting the cable directly into existing natural gas pipelines. 
Sempra said using its utility's gas lines - which hook up to buildings in cities throughout central and southern California - could tackle the telecommunications industry's "last mile" problem connecting end users to outlying fiber-optic cable networks without tearing up city streets.
The surge in demand for high-speed Internet access has led telecommunications companies to pour billions of dollars into vast nationwide fiber-optic systems that carry data to computers, phones and screens faster than traditional copper wires. 
"Demand for broadband service in metropolitan areas is greater than ever," said Donald Felsinger, group president of Sempra Energy. 
"The most significant obstacle to meeting that demand is the laying of fiber-optic cable under city streets - traditionally a slow, costly and disruptive process," he said. 
Sempra Communications' new technology encases fiber-optic cable in a protective polyethylene conduit before inserting it through the same pipelines that carry gas to utility customers, saving time and leaving neighborhood streets intact. 
Sempra said companies that use the technology could see savings up to 30 percent on last mile costs compared to traditional methods of using older technologies and digging up streets, said Jennifer Andrews, a spokeswoman at Sempra Fiber Links, a new unit set up to market the technology. 
Andrews said the company had already met with 15 gas utilities and five telecommunications companies interested in the technology. 
She said Sempra's Southern California Gas Co (SCG) had already applied to the California Public Utilities Commission for approval to use the fiber-optic technology in its lines. 
SCG is one of the largest gas distribution companies in the United States, serving around 18 million customers in Central and Southern California. 
In a statement, Sempra Communications said installing the cable does not inhibit a gas utility from performing any duties necessary to protect public safety. 
Andrews said Sempra filed around two months ago for patents on its fiber-optic technology with the U.S. Patent Office and Trademark Office and the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union. 
Energy companies that have ventured into the fiber-optic business by building infrastructure and/or through bandwidth trade, include Williams Cos., El Paso Corp.., Enron Corp. ENE.N, Dynegy Inc., Duke Energy, Consolidated Edison Inc. and Montana Power Co. 
In March 2000, Montana Power announced plans to divest its energy business and invest the proceeds into its broadband and telecommunications unit Touch America.

US GAO Demands Cheney Provide Data On Energy Meetings

07/18/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

WASHINGTON (AP)--The investigative arm of Congress demanded Wednesday that Vice President Dick Cheney identify all the industry leaders who helped formulate the Bush administration's energy policy. Refusal could lead to a court fight. 
The White House, which is reviewing the request, said it would work with the General Accounting Office to resolve the issue.
The GAO letter follows repeated refusals by the vice president's office to provide names and titles of participants who met with the energy task force chaired by Cheney. 
Under the law, the GAO could sue if the Bush administration fails to supply the data within 20 days. 
This is the first demand letter ever issued by the GAO to a vice president, said Democratic Reps. John Dingell and Henry Waxman, who directed the agency to review the task force's work nearly three months ago. 
The vice president's lawyer has told the GAO there were nine meetings of the task force and that staffers also met with many people to gather information. 
The result was an energy policy, announced May 17, that is aimed at increasing the nation's supply of energy. It includes expanded oil and gas drilling on public land and a rejuvenated nuclear power system. 
White House spokeswoman Anne Womack said the letter is under review and "we will continue to work with the GAO to resolve this issue." 
The vice president's office "has continued on its course of secrecy and obstinance," Dingell said in a statement. 
"The White House should simply try telling the truth...and stop hiding information that Congress and the public have a right to see," said Waxman. 
The White House's position is that the GAO is entitled to information on the task force's costs, but that the congressional watchdog agency doesn't have authority to ask for lists of those with whom the task force met. 
Waxman is also pressing for a Justice Department investigation of Karl Rove over the Bush political strategist's energy-related meetings. 
The White House has acknowledged that Rove participated in meetings on the administration's energy policy while he owned stock in energy companies such as Texas-based Enron Corp. The White House has supplied no details on Rove's meetings.

Enron's Azurix blocks construction of Argentina-Uruguay gas pipeline - report

07/18/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

LA PLATA, Argentina (AFX) - Enron Corp water and sewage unit Azurix Buenos Aires SA has obtained a restraining order against the construction of the Cruz del Sur pipeline under the River Plate from Argentina to Uruguay, the daily El Dia reported. 
Works were paralyzed BG Group PLC, BP Amoco PLC and Bridas Corp joint venture Pan American Energy LLC, BASF AG's Wintershall and Enron Corp and Perez Companc SA's Transportadora Gas del Sur venture Gasoducto Cruz del Sur SA from Punta Lara in Argentina to Colonia, Uruguay, it said.
"Dredging operations carried out in the coastal area (near the Punta Lara potabilization plant), could have caused an alteration in the continuity and quality of water service," said Buenos Aires provincial enviromental policy department. 
Gasoducto Cruz del Sur has not met the conditions required to complete the pipeline, and this "could place the potability of water at risk," court sources told El Dia. 
Azurix holds the Buenos Aires provincial water and sewage concession.

Fitch Rts Marlin Water Trust II Sr Secured Notes Due 2003, `BBB'

07/18/2001
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 18, 2001--Fitch has assigned a 'BBB' rating to Marlin Water Trust II and the Marlin Water Trust II Co-Issuer's (Marlin II) $475 million issuance of 6.31% senior secured notes due 2003, and $515 million 6.19% senior secured notes due 2003. 
The notes are issued domestically pursuant to SEC Rule 144A and outside the U.S. under Regulation S. At closing net proceeds from the issuance will temporarily be invested in two short-term Enron Corp. (Enron) notes.
Ultimately the proceeds from the repayment of the Enron notes will be used to redeem the outstanding $830 million 7.09% senior secured notes due 2001 of Marlin Water Trust (Marlin) and pay interest on the senior notes and yield on the Marlin trust certificates. The support for the rating comes from an overfund account (pre-funded interest) and equity commitment from Enron in the form of mandatorily convertible preferred stock. The overfund account will be invested in Enron debt securities (rated 'BBB+', Rating Outlook Stable), with payments used to service interest to noteholders. 
Fitch considers the cash flow stream to repay interest representative of a 'BBB+' credit profile. Payment of principal ultimately relies on Enron's obligation to remarket mandatorily convertible preferred securities. Fitch currently rates Enron's preferred securities 'BBB-'. 
Enron established Marlin to facilitate off-balance sheet financing of the acquisition of Wessex Water Plc (Wessex). Azurix, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Enron, acquired Wessex in October 1998 for $2.4 billion through its direct subsidiary Azurix Europe Limited (AEL). Through a series of transactions, Enron contributed its ownership interest in Azurix to Atlantic Water Trust (AWT) in exchange for a 50% ownership interest in AWT. At the same time, Marlin acquired a 50% ownership interest in AWT with proceeds from the original Marlin issuance of senior notes ($1.15 billion) and trust certificates ($125 million). AWT applied the Marlin notes and certificates proceeds to repay a $900 million acquisition bridge loan and to establish a $249 million overfund account invested in Enron senior unsecured debt to pay note interest and certificate yield. In addition, Enron contributed to AWT its rights under a $125 million loan to AEL (rated `BBB+'). 
Both the AEL note and the Enron debt securities are held at Bristol Water Trust (Bristol) for the benefit of Marlin investors. In June 1999, Azurix completed an initial public offering of 33% of the company, proceeds of which were used to partially redeem the Marlin senior notes. In a shift in strategy in March 2001, Enron repurchased the Azurix shares held by the public. The Marlin II transaction represents a refinancing of the remaining Marlin senior notes. While various sources of repayment for the Marlin II notes are available, such as sale or liquidation of the AWT assets, an equity offering, or repayment of the AEL note, primary credit support is derived from the Enron obligation to remarket mandatorily convertible preferred stock. 
If an amount sufficient to repay the notes has not been deposited with the trustee 120 days prior to the maturity date or upon a Note Trigger Event, the indenture trustee will direct the share trust to sell the Enron preferred stock on terms that are designed to generate an amount sufficient to redeem the notes in full. 
In the event that the issuance of the preferred stock yields less than the amount required to redeem the senior notes, Enron is required to deliver additional shares. If Enron cannot or does not deliver on this obligation, then the amount of the deficiency becomes a payment obligation of Enron, representing a general unsecured claim. Trigger events include: an event of default on the Marlin II notes occurs and notes are accelerated; 120 days prior to maturity if the repayment amount of the senior notes has not been deposited with the indenture trustee as a result of the sale of Enron equity or other equity (which may include the mandatorily convertible preferred stock); or, downgrade of Enron's senior unsecured debt below investment grade by Fitch, S&P or Moody's in conjunction with a decline in Enron's closing stock price to below $34.13 over three consecutive trading days. 
The Marlin transactions provide Enron with an efficient vehicle to monetize its investment in Wessex and effectively accelerate the process for capital redeployment. Fitch does not expect the success or failure of AWT asset sales to materially impact Enron's consolidated credit quality. Currently, Enron's obligation under this transaction represents a small portion of Enron's asset portfolio. Enron's core operations demonstrate strong competitive market positions and provide stable earnings and cash flow contributions. Most consolidated credit measures are expected to moderately strengthen in 2001. The company's strategy to increase its return on capital employed and become more flexible and less asset intensive is reflected in the planned sales of a significant portion of its global generation assets.

(This article was originally published Thursday) 
By Jason Leopold
OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--A California Senate committee investigating manipulation in the state's wholesale power market approved a measure late Thursday, authorizing the committee to depose the chief executives of major energy companies to provide insight into the companies' trading practices. 
The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation voted 28-6 in favor of deposing some of the energy sector's most powerful chief executives. 
The move comes a day after the committee held Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) and Enron Corp. (ENE) in contempt for refusing to provide documents on its electricity trading and sales practices. The full Senate is expected to vote on the contempt charge and decide the punishment to impose. 
Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, the committee chair, would have carte blanche to depose executives, such as Enron Chairman Ken Lay, who has been singled out by Attorney General Bill Lockyer for gouging consumers in the state. 
Representatives of the energy companies under investigation were not available for comment. 
The committee has been investigating whether energy companies knowingly manipulated the state's wholesale electricity market to drive up prices and create artificial shortages. 
It has yet to uncover a "smoking gun." But has secured the testimony of former Duke Energy (DUK) power plant employees who told the committee that the company reduced output at a San Diego power plant during power emergencies to drive up power prices. 
The state's Independent System Operator, however, conceded that it ordered the fluctuations in capacity at the power plant.

ITALY: Montedison chances of fighting off Fiat seen fading.
By Christian Plumb

07/20/2001
Reuters English News Service 
(C) Reuters Limited 2001. 

MILAN, July 20 (Reuters) - Montedison continued to battle a Fiat-led consortium's 5.6 billion euro hostile takeover on Friday, but investors said its chances were fading. 
Montedison clung to the hope that an Italian administrative court would rule in its favour against securities regulator Consob, which earlier this week gave the go-ahead for the bid.
That court will issue a provisional ruling in the case on July 25, the day before the Italenergia consortium's offer is due to begin, a judicial source told Reuters. 
Montedison and its longtime backer Mediobanca are also hoping that EU regulators will find that Italenergia should have notified it about the bid and punish the would-be predator by temporarily suspending its voting rights in Montedison. 
Above all, Montedison is looking for an opening that would let it launch a counterbid for Edison, Italy's second-largest power company and Italenergia's main target. 
Italian press reports today said U.S. power company Enron could be interested in such a counterbid. That was the latest in a series of potential white knights for Edison that have so far not materialised. 
"The hope is to open a window that would allow them to launch a counter-offer for Edison," said Massimo Aloi, a fund manager at Antonveneta ABN Amro in Milan. "But the possibilities are low." 
A suspension of the Consob ruling would also mean a suspension of the so-called "passivity rule" which bars takeover targets from taking evasive manoeuvres. 
"At this point, we think the Fiat offer should get a lot of shares tendered," Aloi added. 
Other investors agreed the chances were remote for Mediobanca to hold onto its key industrial asset. 
Gathering support for a counterbid "seems like an unlikely hypothesis because they would not be able to reach a majority of the capital at a shareholder meeting," said Luca Comi, head of research at Eptasim in Milan. 
Italenergia holds about 52 percent of Montedison ordinary shares. 
The Fiat bidding vehicle late on Thursday moved to blunt criticism about the role of Electricite de France, cutting the French power giant's preference shares to a two percent weight. Italenergia had previously converted all but two percent of EdF's ordinary shares into preference shares. 
Italenergia is doing its best to minimise the role of the French utility, which has been accused of expanding into other energy markets while its home market remains mostly closed to competition. 
In another potential setback to Mediobanca, the merchant bank could even be forced to backtrack on one of the anti-takeover moves it took as Italenergia was launching its offer - the sale of 35 percent of paper holding company Dieci to French raider Vincent Bollore. 
Shareholders in Dieci plan to exercise their right of first refusal on that 35 percent, dealing a blow to a key prong of Mediobanca's defence, Il Sole 24 Ore reported on Friday.

AES Corp. Wants India to Buy Its Stake in Power Distributor
2001-07-20 08:34 (New York)
AES Corp. Wants India to Buy Its Stake in Power Distributor
     New Delhi, July 20 (Bloomberg) -- AES Corp., a U.S. power
generator, said India must pay it out for its stake in a power
distributor in eastern Orissa state that's owed $45 million in
past-due bills because of power thefts and refusals to pay.
     The debts owed by consumers in the state to Central
Electricity Supply Co., 51 percent owned by AES, have accumulated
over the last two-and-a-half years. Some consumers refuse to pay
for electricity in India, while many steal it after connecting
illegally to transmission lines.
     ``It's a crisis. We don't have any solutions for the
problem,'' Haresh Jaisinghani, managing director at AES Transpower
Pte., a AES unit based in Singapore, said in an interview. ``We're
tired of waiting.''
     AES is at least the fifth overseas utility to face payment
problems or withdraw investments from India citing delays,
bureaucracy and the slow pace of reforms. Their withdrawal may
hurt India's economy, which needs $200 billion to double
generating capacity and avoid power failures common in many Indian
cities.
     Enron Corp. and a state electricity board in India's western
state of Maharashtra have been quarrelling for seven months over
$64 million of unpaid bills. The board, Enron's sole customer,
stopped buying power from the unit, saying it's too expensive.
Construction of the $3 billion plant's second phase stopped last
month after lenders cut funding.
     Four other foreign power companies, including Electricite de
France, Europe's largest, have pulled out of Indian power projects
worth $3 billion.
     AES says it doesn't have any money to pay the salaries of
8,500 Central Electric Supply, or Cesco, employees after July
ends.
                              Orissa
     Orissa in 1996 became the first of India's 28 provinces to
split its electricity board, almost bankrupt from power thefts,
into separate distribution and generation companies to boost
efficiency.
     Four companies -- one each for the northern, southern,
western and central parts of the state -- were created to
distribute power. AES bought 51 percent of Cesco for $140 million
and BSES Ltd., a power producer in Mumbai, took 51 percent in each
of the other three distributors. The state's transmission unit,
Gridco, holds the other 49 percent in each of the four companies.
     Yet, things haven't worked to plan. Orissa's government
loaded 4.66 billion rupees in past-due bills from its electricity
board on to Gridco, curbing its ability to pay future bills to
power producers like AES. Power thefts made the problem worse:
about half the power transmitted by Gridco to the distributors in
1998 was stolen or lost, according to a government report.
     ``We've not had any law and order support from Orissa,''
AES's Jaisinghani said. ``Our officials were intimidated by locals
each time they tried to recover past dues.''
     Still, AES is not closing down its 49 percent owned Orissa
Power Generation Co., which runs a 420-megawatt power plant. It's
operating at 80 percent capacity.
     ``OPGC (the power station) is getting paid but not enough,''
Jaisinghani said. ``Running the plant at 80 percent capacity will
cover costs in the current year. Of course, that doesn't solve our
problem'' of unpaid bills.
     Arlington, Virginia-based AES owns stakes in 173 power plants
generating 59,000 megawatts worldwide, including utilities in the
U.S. and Latin America.
     AES shares rose 25 cents to $36.68. They have declined 34
percent this year.

Enron's India Unit Wants Renewed Arbitration, N.Y. Times Says
2001-07-20 06:15 (New York)
     Bangalore, India, July 20 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s Dabhol
Power unit in India asked the Supreme Court of India to restart
arbitration proceedings in its dispute with a regional utility
project that was the only customer of its $2.9 billion power
project, the New York Times reported.
     Dabhol asked the court to vacate an earlier ruling by the
Mumbai High Court in Maharashtra that stopped the arbitration
process, the paper said. The lower court sent the case to the
regulatory authority in Maharashtra. No decision has been made.
     Dabhol claims the Maharashtra State Utility Board owes it
$64 million, the paper said. The project is the biggest single
foreign investment in the company. Houston-based Enron holds a
65 percent stake in Dabhol.
     In May, Dabhol began a six-month notice period to end the
power-purchase agreement. The plant stopped production when the
utility, which had claimed Dabhol was overcharging it, stopped
buying power in response, the paper said.

AES Corp. Wants India to Buy Its Stake in Power Distributor
2001-07-20 08:34 (New York)
AES Corp. Wants India to Buy Its Stake in Power Distributor
     New Delhi, July 20 (Bloomberg) -- AES Corp., a U.S. power
generator, said India must pay it out for its stake in a power
distributor in eastern Orissa state that's owed $45 million in
past-due bills because of power thefts and refusals to pay.
     The debts owed by consumers in the state to Central
Electricity Supply Co., 51 percent owned by AES, have accumulated
over the last two-and-a-half years. Some consumers refuse to pay
for electricity in India, while many steal it after connecting
illegally to transmission lines.
     ``It's a crisis. We don't have any solutions for the
problem,'' Haresh Jaisinghani, managing director at AES Transpower
Pte., a AES unit based in Singapore, said in an interview. ``We're
tired of waiting.''
     AES is at least the fifth overseas utility to face payment
problems or withdraw investments from India citing delays,
bureaucracy and the slow pace of reforms. Their withdrawal may
hurt India's economy, which needs $200 billion to double
generating capacity and avoid power failures common in many Indian
cities.
     Enron Corp. and a state electricity board in India's western
state of Maharashtra have been quarrelling for seven months over
$64 million of unpaid bills. The board, Enron's sole customer,
stopped buying power from the unit, saying it's too expensive.
Construction of the $3 billion plant's second phase stopped last
month after lenders cut funding.
     Four other foreign power companies, including Electricite de
France, Europe's largest, have pulled out of Indian power projects
worth $3 billion.
     AES says it doesn't have any money to pay the salaries of
8,500 Central Electric Supply, or Cesco, employees after July
ends.
                              Orissa
     Orissa in 1996 became the first of India's 28 provinces to
split its electricity board, almost bankrupt from power thefts,
into separate distribution and generation companies to boost
efficiency.
     Four companies -- one each for the northern, southern,
western and central parts of the state -- were created to
distribute power. AES bought 51 percent of Cesco for $140 million
and BSES Ltd., a power producer in Mumbai, took 51 percent in each
of the other three distributors. The state's transmission unit,
Gridco, holds the other 49 percent in each of the four companies.
     Yet, things haven't worked to plan. Orissa's government
loaded 4.66 billion rupees in past-due bills from its electricity
board on to Gridco, curbing its ability to pay future bills to
power producers like AES. Power thefts made the problem worse:
about half the power transmitted by Gridco to the distributors in
1998 was stolen or lost, according to a government report.
     ``We've not had any law and order support from Orissa,''
AES's Jaisinghani said. ``Our officials were intimidated by locals
each time they tried to recover past dues.''
     Still, AES is not closing down its 49 percent owned Orissa
Power Generation Co., which runs a 420-megawatt power plant. It's
operating at 80 percent capacity.
     ``OPGC (the power station) is getting paid but not enough,''
Jaisinghani said. ``Running the plant at 80 percent capacity will
cover costs in the current year. Of course, that doesn't solve our
problem'' of unpaid bills.
     Arlington, Virginia-based AES owns stakes in 173 power plants
generating 59,000 megawatts worldwide, including utilities in the
U.S. and Latin America.
     AES shares rose 25 cents to $36.68. They have declined 34
percent this year.

INDIA PRESS: Dabhol Challenges Commission's Jurisdiction

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- Dabhol Power Co. Wednesday appealed to the Supreme Court to challenge the jurisdiction of Maharashtra State Electricity Regulatory Commission, reports the Business Standard. 
Dabhol, the Indian unit of U.S. energy major Enron Corp. (ENE), is challenging the Commission's decisions on Dabhol's disputes with its sole buyer the Maharashtra State Electricity Board.
The newspaper report quoted a Dabhol spokesman as saying the issue will come up for a hearing in several days. 
Dabhol's global lenders have also decided to appeal to the Supreme Court within a week over the same issue, the report added. 
Dabhol is the single largest foreign investment in India, worth $2.9 billion. Its power plant in the western Indian state of Maharashtra has a capacity to generate 740 megawatts. The plant has stopped operations since May 29 after MSEB stopped drawing power from Dabhol saying its tariffs were "unaffordable."

Looking for an S&P revival: Elliott & Page manager focuses on earnings growth

Toronto-based Mark Schmeer, managing director of equities at money manager Elliott & Page, says the Standard & Poor's 500 index could generate a double-digit total return over the next 12 months as the U.S. economy grows about 2% to 3%. 
If this forecast is correct -- "by various measures the U.S. economy has bottomed" -- then this augurs well for growth stocks such as those in the technology sector, he says. "Growth stocks do well in a climate of accelerating economic growth and a rising stock market." This suggests, he says, that investors should consider revisiting the battered tech sector, "but not indiscriminately."
While he is bullish on the outlook for the equity market over the next 12 months, Schmeer warns that there will continue to be volatility. 
Schmeer and his team have assembled a comprehensive corporate data base that is updated regularly. 
In stock selection, the Elliott & Page team uses both traditional fundamental analysis and proprietary models. These rank companies on their earnings growth momentum and their ability to generate positive earnings surprises and upwards earnings revisions by financial analysts. 
For the column, Schmeer is selecting stocks from a number of sectors. His tech pick: 
- BEA Systems Inc. (BEAS/NASDAQ), which closed recently at US$24.52 and trades in a 52-week range of US$89.50 to US$20.19. 
The stock is substantially off its 52-week high and has declined more than the average tech stock, he notes, yet the company continues to deliver on earnings. BEA is provides application and Web application servers for electronic commerce. Major products include BEA WebLogic, a software platform for e-commerce applications. 
Unlike many other tech companies, BEA has been keeping up its earnings growth rate and reporting earnings in line with expectations and should continue to do so, Schmeer says. Earnings per share estimates are US42 cents for the fiscal year to January, 2002, and US64 cents for the fiscal year to January, 2003. This makes for an earnings growth rate of around 50%. The stock trades at a multiple of close to 60 times forward earnings. 
A specialist stock in the energy sector he likes is: 
- Enron Corp. (ENE/NYSE) US$49.85 (US$90.56- US$42.35). Based in Houston, this company is a leader in the field of energy wholesaling. It procures energy and sells to major U.S. corporations such as Eli Lilly and Quaker Oats under long-term agreements. 
Enron has expanded into the electricity market as deregulation created price uncertainty for users, says Schmeer. The company has produced six consecutive quarters of positive earnings surprises and analysts have been revising their earnings estimates upward, he notes. 
Earnings per share estimates are US$1.86 for 2001 and US$2.25 for 2002. The stock trades at a P/E multiple close to this earnings growth outlook, which is desirable as many stocks in the S&P 500 index are trading well above their prospective growth rates, says Schmeer. 
He is generally cautious about energy producers and traditional energy services companies such as drillers. 
"Historically, these stocks mainly outperform when the market is going down and they are less likely to beat the market in a climate of economic acceleration." 
He has sold major U.S. energy services company, Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB/NYSE) US$49.85 (US$88.87-US$48.05). Its earnings growth rate has been rapidly declining and the company may not meet consensus estimates for the third and fourth quarter this year, he says. 
Schmeer's picks in the consumer products sector include: 
- Johnson & Johnson (JNJ/NYSE) US$54.91 (US$54.98- US$40.25). This health care products company has been reporting positive earnings surprises, he notes. "This is not a cheap stock, but you are paying for the consistency in earnings growth; the company should continue to deliver on its earnings." 
J and J recently purchased ALZA Corp., a drug delivery company based in California, for US$10.5-billion in stock, which might lead to a modest EPS dilution for 2001 of an estimated US10 cents per share, while 2002 should not be affected, he says. Earnings per share estimates are US$1.94 for 2001 and US$2.20 for 2002. The stock trades at roughly two times its estimated earnings growth rate. 
Finally, this manager is choosing a rapidly expanding savings and loan company, Washington Mutual Inc. (WM/NYSE) US$41.38 (US$41.60-US$19.83). 
Based in Seattle, this company has expanded from the Pacific Northwest across the United States, mainly via acquisitions. 
It recently purchased Dime Bancorp, the holding company for Dime Savings Bank of New York. 
The company has been able to exceed analysts estimates over the past three quarters and should continue to do so. Earnings are being revised upwards. 
Washington Mutual is able to grow EPS at a rate of about 11% per year over the long haul. The stock trades at a P/E multiple of about 11, which is cheaper than its peers, Schmeer says.

ASIA-PACIFIC - Enron writ highlights India contract concerns.
By JULIE EARLE.

07/19/2001
Financial Times 
(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved 

Enron's Indian arm, the Dabhol Power Company (DPC), yesterday issued a writ in the Bombay Supreme Court in a move highlighting concerns over the validity of contracts for foreign companies operating in India. 
Enron, the US energy giant that owns 65 per cent of DPC, is locked in a bitter dispute with its sole Indian client, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) over $45m in unpaid bills.
The writ issued yesterday challenges the jurisdiction of Maharashtra's electricity industry regulator, the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission.Enron is appealing a high court decision to allow the regulator to determine jurisdiction over issues in the power purchase agreement between DPC and MSEB. 
In June, the regulator issued an interim order that stopped DPC from pursuing arbitration proceedings in London, as provided for under the purchase power agreement. 
A senior official at Enron yesterday said the company believed that a regulatory body created after the agreement with the electricity board "should not be in a position of potentially disrupting a contract through regulatory mechanisms". 
The electricity board had asked the regulator to intervene. Enron said in May it would pull out of the project. 
The board, which says Enron's tariffs are too expensive, has since late May refused to draw power from the plant and rescinded its power-purchasing contract - a move Enron says is invalid. 
Enron insists that the tariff, which is about three times higher than that levied by Indian power producers, is due to high capital and fuel costs incurred since the contract was signed in 1995.

The State Aides Told to Sell Stock Ethics: Consultants hired for power crisis must dispose of shares in generating firms.

TIMES STAFF WRITERS

Los Angeles Times 
Home Edition

SACRAMENTO -- Facing criticism over possible conflicts of interest, Davis administration officials on Wednesday ordered consultants steering California through the energy crisis to sell off stock they own in power firms--or lose their jobs. 
A top legal aide to Gov. Gray Davis said private consultants who were hanging on to power company stock had failed to uphold the state's highest ethical standards.
Nine consultants under contract with the state have reported holding stock in power companies, including Calpine and Enron, that have reaped huge profits during California's energy crunch. 
Political foes of the governor, most notably Secretary of State Bill Jones, have raised questions in recent weeks about potential conflicts involving the consultants, who helped buy power and negotiate long-term contracts that critics say will saddle consumers with artificially high electricity costs for years to come. 
The administration's tough stance Thursday with the consultants punctuates a startling change of tactics. 
For months, Davis' aides had not required the consultants to file financial disclosure forms to report their personal stock holdings. By law, the disclosure documents must be filed within 30 days of going on the state payroll. The reports were filed after Jones began putting pressure on the governor last week. 
Barry Goode, the governor's legal affairs secretary, dispatched a letter early Wednesday demanding that the consultants sell the stock by noon that day or face termination of their state contracts. 
"It is imperative that you give this instruction, immediately, to each of the consultants," Goode said in his letter to the state Department of Water Resources, which has taken over from California's beleaguered private utilities the job of buying power. 
"We expect, and have always expected, the state's consultants to uphold the highest ethical standards," Goode wrote. "That standard is not met by those who hold a financial interest in one or more energy companies while trading on behalf of the state on energy related matters." 
Goode's admonishment was conveyed by Tom Hannigan, water resources director, to 34 consultants who are on contract with the department, among them the nine contract employees who reported holding shares in generating firms. 
Steve Maviglio, the governor's spokesman, said all the consultants holding stock had agreed to sell it by the noon deadline. 
But the stock sales did not satisfy Jones, who plans to challenge Davis in next year's election. 
He characterized the administration's action Wednesday as "way too little and too late." 
Although the energy crisis and the hiring of numerous consultants on short notice represents an unusual situation, the governor's staff should have been aware of the conflict-of-interest issue, said Bob Stern, president of the Center for Government Studies in Los Angeles and an author of the state's Political Reform Act. 
"Somebody," he said, "was asleep at the switch in the governor's office." 
"We are talking here about major amounts of money," Stern said. "You don't get involved with decisions that affect your financial interest." 
Of the consultants who filed disclosure reports last week, six reported that they own stock in Calpine Corp. One reported holding stock in Enron Corp. One of those seven resigned her state consultant's job a few days ago. 
The latest conflict-of-interest statements, filed earlier this week, reveal that three other consultants own energy company stock. 
Mark Skowronski, who works for the Electric Power group, owned $10,000 to $100,000 in stock in power producer Reliant Energy Inc. when he went to work for the state. 
In a note attached to his disclosure form, Skowronski said he sold his shares in Reliant on March 20 after he was given the assignment as the lead state negotiator with the company. He continues to own four blocks of Edison stock, each valued at $10,000 to $100,000, which he bought in January and February. "I have had no dealings with Edison and have not had a conflict of interest," Skowronski said in his attached note. 
Ronald O. Nichols, another consultant, reported that in April that he bought $10,000 to $100,000 worth of stock in Enron and General Electric. 
In a statement filed Monday, consultant Sumner W. White reported that he owns $2,000 to $10,000 in stock in TXU Corp., a Dallas-based energy holding company. 
White also reported that he had income of $10,000 to $100,000 as a part-owner, executive vice president and director of SRW Group, a Texas independent power developer.

Enel Narrows the Field 
To 3 Bidders for Elettrogen
ROME -- Italian utility Enel SpA said that after a first round of offers there were three groups left in the race for its electricity-generating company Elettrogen, which experts say is valued at least 5.5 trillion lire (2.84 billion euros). 
The bidders left in the contest are Edison-Sondel, units of agro-energy conglomerate Montedison SpA; Italpower, a consortium of Swiss-based ATEL AG, the municipal utilities of Milan, Turin and Rome, steel group Carlo Tassara SpA and Banca di Roma SpA; and a consortium led by Spain's Endesa SA that includes Asm Brescia and Spanish bank Banco Santander Central Hispano SA. 
Sinergia, a consortium including Austria's Oesterreichische Elektrizitaetswirtschafts AG Verbundgesellschaft, Italian holding company CIR and U.S. company Mirant Corp., was excluded from the race. 
"On the basis of the offers received (Wednesday), Enel has selected the three potential buyers who have put forward the highest bids," Enel said, adding that the next round of offers is expected Friday. 
Enel didn't say how much the bids were, but Italian news agency ANSA said people close to the deal said the highest price offered Wednesday was equal to 5.044 trillion lire. Enel wouldn't comment on the numbers. 
People close to the deal said the next round of bids would start from the highest price offered Wednesday plus an extra 15 million euros. (Dow Jones)

Exxon Is Interested in Dolphin 
DUBAI -- Exxon Mobil Corp. is interested in participating in the $4 billion (4.66 billion euro) Dolphin Gas project, a plan between the UAE Offsets Group and Qatar Petroleum to transport natural gas from Qatar to Abu Dhabi and Dubai, the official Emirates News Agency, or WAM, reported. An Exxon Mobil official and the United Arab Emirates' foreign minister discussed the issue Wednesday, WAM said. The Dolphin project aims to transport two billion cubic feet a day of natural gas from Qatar's offshore North Field to the U.A.E. In May, Enron Corp. sold its 24.5% stake in Dolphin back to Offsets, freeing up its share for another potential strategic partner. TotalFinaElf SA is Offsets' other strategic partner, holding a 24.5% stake in the project. (Dow Jones)

Accounting Office Demands Energy Task Force Records
By JEFF GERTH

07/19/2001
The New York Times 
Page 20, Column 1
c. 2001 New York Times Company 

WASHINGTON, July 18 -- After two months of unsuccessful requests, the General Accounting Office demanded today that Vice President Dick Cheney turn over records relating to how his energy task force developed its policies. 
The demand letter, by the Congressional auditing office acting at the request of two ranking Democratic House members, increases the possibility of a legal and constitutional clash between Congress and the Bush administration.
A White House spokeswoman, Anne Womack, said the letter was ''under review, and we're going to continue to work with the G.A.O. to try and resolve this issue appropriately.'' 
Last month Mr. Cheney's counsel told the office that it lacked jurisdiction over the task force because the panel acted only as an adviser to the president, a function protected by the Constitution. 
The White House has 20 days to respond to the letter. The accounting office could then go to federal court to try to enforce the demand letter, one of 32 issued by the G.A.O. since 1980 to various federal departments. This is the first time a demand letter has been sent to a vice president, accounting office officials said. 
The letter seeks information about people with whom Mr. Cheney and other task force members met while developing the group's policies, but not information about ''the deliberative process.'' Mr. Cheney has said that the task force's report in May, which contained more than 100 recommendations involving energy production, infrastructure, conservation and the environment, was based on sound public policy considerations. 
In an interview tonight on ''The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer,'' broadcast on PBS, Mr. Cheney said the task force realized at the outset that it had to have an ''adequate concern for the environment in this report, or we're not going to have a credible report.'' 
But some Democrats and other critics say energy industry executives and their lobbyists had too much influence over Mr. Cheney's plan, while environmental and consumer groups were ignored or treated perfunctorily. And the vice president's refusal to release the names of people who contacted the task force led two of his chief critics, Representatives Henry A. Waxman of California and John D. Dingell of Michigan, both Democrats, to bring in the accounting office for a closer look. 
Mr. Cheney has acknowledged meeting with energy executives, including Kenneth L. Lay, the chairman of the Enron Corporation, but denies that they exercised any undue influence on the deliberations. 
''The idea that somehow only the energy industry has access just simply isn't true,'' Mr. Cheney said in an interview last spring. ''We'll make decisions on what we think makes sound public policy.'' 
Juleanna Glover Weiss, Mr. Cheney's spokeswoman, declined to discuss any specific meetings involving the task force or the vice president. 
''We don't release the vice president's schedule,'' Ms. Weiss said. 
More broadly, however, she said Mr. Cheney's task force -- the National Energy Policy Development Group, composed of cabinet officers and other government officials -- met with many elected officials, organizations and outside interests. The group's report was released on May 17, and many of its recommendations require further action by Congress and government agencies. 
Mr. Cheney's counselor, Mary Matalin, said Democrats should now look to the aftermath of the report instead of the group's deliberations. 
''If they want to know what happened in the meetings, look at what it spawned in legislation that is on the Hill,'' Ms. Matalin said. 
And since the report's release, Mr. Cheney has met with some environmentalists, his spokeswoman said. 
Some environmental groups said today that this was too little and too late. 
''Industry has had direct access to key decision makers while representatives of the public interest and environmental communities are left to the sidelines,'' said Alyssondra Campaigne, the legislative director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, which has been unsuccessful in seeking task force records under the Freedom of Information Act. 
The accounting office's letter demands five sets of records: names and attendees at meetings of the energy group; information about the group's six professional staff members; details of meetings between the staff and others, including lobbyists; details of Mr. Cheney's meetings with others and cost accounting records for the group, for which Mr. Cheney's office has already turned over 77 pages. 
The accounting office claims broad authority to examine government programs under the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921. 
The request by Mr. Waxman and Mr. Dingell led the G.A.O. to approach Mr. Cheney's office first on May 8. Mr. Cheney's counsel, David S. Addington, later questioned the appropriateness of the request and sent a letter challenging the accounting office's legal authority. 
Mr. Addington's letter of June 7 suggested a constitutional privilege. It said the policy group was acting in a constitutional capacity as adviser to the president so it was not a government program subject to Congressional oversight. The group's senior staff members are actually paid through the Department of Energy, White House officials said. 
Last week, lawyers from the White House and the Justice Department discussed the request with officials from the accounting office, but the matter remained unresolved. 
Today's demand letter, signed by Anthony Gamboa, the agency's general counsel, is a formal enforcement mechanism. While it may resemble a subpoena in some respects, agency officials said it had a unique standing by statute that ultimately resided in federal court. 
The accounting office infrequently uses demand letters. 
''We worked very hard not to get to this point,'' said Bob Robinson, managing director for natural resources and environment at the office. 
Mr. Robinson said other parts of the executive branch involved in the task force, including the Departments of Interior and Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency, had begun providing information, though only at the last minute.

California Power Consultants Must Sell Stocks, L.A. Times Says
2001-07-19 08:20 (New York)

     Washington, July 19 (Bloomberg) -- California Governor Gray
Davis's administration ordered consultants handling the management
of California's energy crisis to sell their stock in power
companies, the Los Angeles Times reported.
     Political foes of the governor, including Secretary of State
Bill Jones, raised questions about potential conflicts of interest
involving the consultants, who helped the state negotiate long-
term contracts with power companies, the paper said.
     A letter early yesterday was sent by the governor's legal
affairs secretary, Barry Goode, demanding that the 34 consultants
under contract with the state sell their stock by noon yesterday
or face termination of their contracts, the paper said.
     Nine consultants under contract with the state have reported
owning stock in power companies such as Enron Corp. and Calpine
Corp., which have made large profits during the state's energy
crisis, the paper said.

Calif. Senate Panel To Cite Reliant, Enron For Contempt

07/19/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

(This article was originally published Wednesday.) 

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- A California Senate committee Wednesday voted to cite Reliant Energy (REI) with contempt because the company has refused to provide documents for an investigation into wholesale electricity prices in the state, said committee Chairman Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana.
The committee also voted to forward a contempt charge for Enron Corp (ENE) to the full Senate, where it will be voted on. If the charge is approved, the Senate will vote on punishment, which could include hefty fines or incarceration of executives. 
Talks between Enron and committee attorneys Monday seemed to indicate the company would agree to committee demands, but since then it has become clear the company doesn't plan to comply, Dunn said. 
"If you had asked two days ago I'd have said we are cautiously optimistic about Enron. Now I'm pessimistic about it. We felt they were indicating to us a willingness to do what the other generators were willing to do, but the bottom line is that they are not, despite their cooperative-sounding words. We are no closer to them coming into compliance than we were a week ago," Dunn said. 
The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation is requesting that Reliant and Enron provide 16 kinds of documents related to market behavior, rent a depository for the documents, and sign the committee's version of a confidentiality agreement. Both generators have refused to meet those demands, Dunn said. 
The committee will drop its contempt charges at any time before a full Senate vote if either generator agrees to its requests. 
A report detailing Enron's contempt charge will be sent to the full Senate on Thursday for introduction, but is expected to be referred to the Senate Rules Committee for review before a floor vote. 
Dunn said he didn't know how long the report would be considered in the Rules Committee, but he will "certainly push them to do it as soon as possible." 
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said the company "will continue to negotiate" with the committee. 
Legislators are scheduled to begin a monthlong break Friday, but aren't certain that will happen because they still need to pass a budget bill and are trying to approve a bill to rescue Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison before leaving. 
Dunn said it would take a few days to prepare a report on Reliant's contempt charge. 
"We may not be able to forward that report to the Senate floor until the day we get back from recess," Dunn said. 
No one at Reliant could be immediately reached for comment. 
The committee originally was poised to cite seven other electricity generators for contempt, but all eventually agreed to provide the requested information. 
A Reliant spokesman said later that the company's main difference with the committee centered on the signing of the confidentiality agreement. Reliant would rather the committee secure a protective order before the company turns over the requested documents, said spokesman Richard Wheatley. 
"We respectfully decline to waive our objections, because we have a lot of trade secrets and proprietary information at stake," he said. 
When asked if the company would take legal action against the committee, Wheatley said Reliant was "keeping all options open." 
"But, really, we hope to work this out on an informal basis," Wheatley said. "We don't think this is that big of a stumbling block." 
Enron filed suit against the committee last week over objections to its subpoena of certain financial documents, and said at hearings last week that it may sue over its contempt charge as well.

Davis administration tells consultants to sell energy stocks

07/19/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

SACRAMENTO (AP) - The Davis administration on Wednesday told consultants buying energy for the state to sell their stock holdings in energy companies immediately or quit their jobs. 
Nine consultants divested by a noon deadline, but critics said the order by Gov. Gray Davis came months too late to protect the public's interest.
The order, issued at Davis' direction, was contained in a memo to Tom Hannigan, director of the state Department of Water Resources. Legal Affairs Secretary Barry Goode wrote that it was "imperative that you give instruction immediately" to those concerned. 
"We expect, and have always expected, the state's consultants to uphold the highest ethical standards," the memo states. "That standard is not met by those who hold a financial interest in one or more energy companies while trading on behalf of the state on energy related matters. 
Under pressure from Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican who hopes to challenge Democrat Davis for re-election next year, the administration moved to obtain statements of economic interest from the energy consultants. The consultants were hired earlier this year to advise the Department of Water Resources on electricity purchases for California's financially strapped utilities. 
The economic statements showed that several consultants held stock in energy generators, including Calpine Corp. and Enron. One consultant reported he sold stock holdings in Edison International and Dynegy when he began work for the state.

INDIA: AES threatens to abandon Indian venture.
By Himangshu Watts

07/19/2001
Reuters English News Service 
(C) Reuters Limited 2001. 

NEW DELHI, July 19 (Reuters) - U.S. energy firm AES Corp may walk out of a troubled distribution venture in eastern India due to a difficult regulatory enivironment, the firm's CEO said on Thursday. 
Dennis Bakke told reporters AES will sell its 51-percent stake in CESCO, a distribution firm in the eastern province of Orissa, unless the firm was paid its dues, allowed to raise tariffs and given a better operating environment.
"If satisfactory resolution of these matters is not expeditiously reached, AES will be forced to abandon its commitment to the distribution company," he said. 
AES holds a 49 percent stake in Orissa Power Generation Corporation (OPGC), which runs a 420-MW plant in the state and sells power to state-run Gridco, a state-run transmission firm. 
Bakke said Gridco owed OPGC about $45 million and the U.S. firm had filed for arbitration in Orissa to recover the dues accumulated over two and a half years. 
He said GRIDCO was not paying OPGC, the generating company, saying that CESCO, the distribution firm, owed it money. 
"These are standalone businesses, and there is no basis for any such linkage or offset," he said. 
Bakke said the state's regulatory commission had ordered CESCO to transfer all receivables collected into an escrow account, but the company could not abide by the instruction as it needed money to pay its employees. 
However, it complied after the local government initiated criminal proceedings against the managing director of CESCO, he said. AES will deposit all revenues into the escrow account. 
"Hence funds will not be available to pay the 8,500 CESCO employees salaries due July 31 and thereafter." 
He said the regulatory regime in Orissa fixed tariffs at levels which did not allow it to recover its costs. 
Orissa officials were not immediately available for comment. 
He said AES was considering selling its stake in CESCO but could enter into a management contract in the transition period. 
However, AES will look at other opportunities in India if it finds a better regulatory environment. 
Bakke said AES had not made any proposal to take over Enron Corp's troubled Dabhol project but it was a "potential business" in which it might be interested at some stage. 
Apart from Enron, which has threatened to walk out of its $2.9-billion Indian venture, U.S. firm, Cogentrix, and Electricite de France have also packed their bags. 
India, whose 100,000 MW generation capacity is 13 percent short of demand, began power reforms in the early 1990s to attract foreign investment to increase power availability to industry and almost 80,000 villages without electricity.

FERC Agenda Eyes Tightening Of Pipeline Affiliate Rules
By Bryan Lee

Dow Jones Energy Service

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Federal energy regulators are scheduled to act next week on new rules affecting natural gas pipeline affiliate dealings.
Sources say the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is debating action at next Wednesday's open meeting to tighten up rules prohibiting pipelines from providing market-sensitive information to marketing affiliates. 
FERC rules allow monopoly pipeline companies to market natural gas in competitive markets providing they adopt codes of conduct that prevent the passing of information that provides a competitive advantage to their gas-marketing affiliates. 
Similar rules are in place on the electric side for vertically integrated utilities with marketing units competing in wholesale power markets. 
The changes under consideration stem from the commission's investigation of El Paso Natural Gas Co.'s (EPG) controversial contract with a marketing affiliate for pipeline capacity into California, according to sources. 
The affiliate transaction has been blamed for California's dramatic runup in natural gas prices over the past year, which contributed to the state's unprecedentedly high electricity costs last year. 
The proposed code-of-conduct changes also reflect the sweeping convergence between the natural gas and power sectors in the years since FERC deregulated the pipeline industry in the 1980s. 
FERC's rules prohibit pipelines from sharing market-sensitive information with their gas-marketing affiliates. But the rules don't address the pipeline's power marketing affiliates. The commission is looking to expand the code-of-conduct rules to address all marketing affiliates, sources said. 
These sources say the template for the pending change can be found in the conditions FERC imposed in a 1999 order authorizing the acquisition of Pittsburgh-based Consolidated Natural Gas by Dominion Resources (D). 
The commission approved the electricity-natural gas convergence merger, contingent on Dominion agreeing to adopt codes of conduct applying equally to its gas and power marketing affiliates. 
The planned rule changes would apply to electric utilities with pipeline investments, such as CMS Energy (CMS), Duke Energy (DUK) and American Electric Power Co. (AEP). It is unclear how the changes would affect joint operating agreements, such as the one between Entergy Corp. (ETR) and privately held Koch Industries. 
But the largest impact will be for large pipeline companies with extensive power marketing operations and investments in power plants. 
For example, El Paso, Williams Cos. (WMB) and Enron Corp. (ENE), represent about 70% of the interstate pipeline industry and are among the nation's top power marketers and merchant power plant developers. 
One FERC source described the order scheduled for commission vote next week as "a work in progress," while another said the matter is in such a state of flux that "it might not be safe to write anything yet."

AES CEO Meeting Indian Power Minister on Dabhol, Paper Reports
2001-07-19 02:00 (New York)
 New Delhi, July 19 (Bloomberg) -- AES Corp. Chief Executive
Dennis Bakke will likely discuss taking over Enron Corp.'s Dabhol
Power Co. when he meets India's power minister Suresh Prabhu
today, Business Standard said, without citing officials.
     Dabhol, 65 percent owned by Enron, and Maharashtra State
Electricity Board, its only customer, have been quarrelling for
seven months over unpaid bills. The board has stopped
buying power from Dabhol and construction work on the $3 billion
plant was halted last month after lenders stopped funding it.
     Bakke will also likely discuss AES's own payment problems at
its 49 percent owned Orissa Power Generation Co. in eastern Orissa
state, the paper said. AES is struggling to recover 2.1 billion
rupees ($44 million) owed it by the state-run transmission
company, the Business Standard reported earlier.
     Bakke is also likely to meet India's Finance Minister
Yashwant Sinha, the paper said.

ES Corp. May Exit Indian Power Venture Over Past-Due Payments

AES Corp. May Exit Indian Power Venture Over Past-Due Payments
	 New Delhi, July 19 (Bloomberg) -- AES Corp., the biggest U.S.
power company, said it may withdraw from a power distribution
venture in India's eastern Orissa state because of unpaid bills.
     AES, which runs a 420-megawatt power plant in Orissa, is owed
$44 million by the state-run transmission company, of which the
U.S. company owns 49 percent. AES Chief Executive Dennis Bakke met
with India's power minister Suresh Prabhu in New Delhi today.
     ``We have to take such drastic steps when we don't get
paid,'' said Sandra Ross, an official in AES's investor relations
department in Arlington, Virginia. ``These issues have to get
resolved.''
     AES is the latest in a series of overseas power companies
that have faced payment problems or withdrawn investment from the
country citing delays, bureaucracy and the slow pace of reforms.
India says it needs $200 billion to double the nation's generating
capacity and avoid power failures that last year swept across much
of northern India. Blackouts are common in many Indian cities.
     ``AES will be forced to abandon its commitment to the
distribution company'' if the past-due bills aren't paid, AES's
Bakke said on Star TV, broadcast in India today. He said AES is
filing for arbitration of the dispute.

                               Enron

     Enron Corp.'s Dabhol Power Co. and a state electricity board
in India's western state of Maharashtra have been quarrelling for
seven months over $64 million of unpaid bills. The board, Dahbol's
sole customer, stopped buying power from the unit, saying it's too
expensive. Construction of the $3 billion plant's second phase
stopped last month after lenders cut funding.
     Four other foreign power companies, including Electricite de
France, Europe's largest, have pulled out of Indian power projects
worth $3 billion.
     ``We're not happy with the way things are,'' said AES's Ross.
``In the future, if payments resume, we could buy it back.''
     Arlington, Virginia-based AES owns stakes in 173 power plants
generating 59,000 megawatts worldwide, including utilities in the
U.S. and Latin America.
     AES owns 49 percent of the Orissa Power Generation Co. that
supplies 600,000 customers in eastern India.
     AES shares rose as much as $1.37, or 3.8 percent, to $37.80.

Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif.) called yesterday for a Justice Department review of White House senior advisor Karl Rove's repeated discussions with executives and representatives of companies in which he held stock. 
In a letter to White House counsel Alberto R. Gonzales, Waxman said Rove appeared to be in violation of federal conflict-of-interest laws.
Gonzales has said he was satisfied that Rove "took care to avoid" any impropriety in meeting in March with Intel Corp. executives, and in participating in broad discussions about administration energy policy while owning more than $100,000 worth of Intel Corp. stock and more than $200,000 worth of stock in Enron Corp., General Electric Co. and other energy companies. On June 7, Rove sold more than $1 million in stock in companies doing business with the government. 
Waxman, ranking Democrat on the House Government Reform Committee, said federal law requires executive branch departments and agencies, including the White House, to report "any information, allegation or complaint" involving potential criminal conduct by an employee to the Justice Department. He said he was not aware of any reason Rove should be exempt from such outside investigation. 
White House spokesman Dan Bartlett said Waxman's letter is under review, but added, "We are confident that Karl followed all ethical guidelines and statutes in his role as senior adviser to the president."

Business World: How To Execute 10%, Nicely
By Holman W. Jenkins Jr.

07/18/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A19
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

How come Ford adopts the same white-collar performance review system as General Electric but gets vilified for it, hounded by discrimination lawyers and AARP? Last week, less than a year after launching it, CEO Jacques Nasser was moved to dump a brand new executive grading system designed to weed out the least capable 10% of Ford's managers. 
The short answer is that Ford isn't GE, though Jack Welch has been a model for what Mr. Nasser seeks to accomplish at the auto company.
Bringing such a Torquemada system into a firm that faces slowing sales and whose own boss considers his colleagues notoriously flabby and easy on themselves meant it was a downsizing scheme from the start, whether advertised that way or not. GE didn't introduce its version until a decade after the Neutron Jack phase. But never mind. Trumpeting a win last week, AARP declared its victory goes way beyond Ford. It sure does. 
Forced ranking has waxed and waned as a fad over the decades, and most students of management hold their noses around it. Its resurgence, at a time when many employers are contemplating their first layoffs in years, can only mean that companies are nervous about preserving their freedom to hire and fire in a world run increasingly by the job-discrimination bar. 
Ask any non-deluded European. What makes the U.S. economy relatively nimble is that companies are not afraid to take on workers because they know they can always get rid of them later. Harsh as this sounds, it's why we have a lush job market compared to the employment Saharas of the Old World. 
Yet firing in America has been a work in progress. Half a decade ago, enlightened companies tried employee buyouts, but the lawyers descended, forcing companies to offer the buyouts indiscriminately. Result: Highly marketable workers took the windfall and immediately found other jobs, while people who considered themselves unemployable skipped the loot and clung to their cubicles. 
Other companies, on the theory that it was OK to tell people they had to go because their functions or departments were being discontinued, bravely downsized the old-fashioned way. But this was no proof against lawsuits. Remember Texaco, Coca-Cola and others where the very existence of affirmative-action programs became fodder for litigation by both minorities and older white employees? 
Searching for a way out of the legal maze, Ford tried two years ago to combine forced ranking with buyouts, aiming offers exclusively at low-ranked employees. Result: grumbling in the hallways of "rewarding failure" and good employees angling for low grades so they could become eligible for a golden parachute. Finally, starting this year, Ford opted for an out-and-out forced ranking system, which would have given 10% of white-collar employees annually a "C" grade that meant either shape up or you're gone next year. 
Microsoft, Lucent, Conoco, Enron and EDS all have used forced ranking to maintain or improve the quality of their work forces. While many find the idea distasteful or complain it substitutes a yearly spasm for what should be a continuous process, at least it solves a real problem. Survey after survey finds that even the happiest worker-bees gripe about their employer's reluctance to get strict with poor performers. A recent McKinsey poll of managers at big companies found that only 16% said their employer could even recognize the difference between stars and slackers. 
But Ford was already in the soup over the Explorer/Firestone fiasco. It didn't stand a chance when the Detroit papers opened a new front over its A-B-C grading system for 18,000 managers. Accentuating the coverage was a simmering quest to discover any sort of rift between Mr. Nasser and his chairman, Bill Ford, great-grandson of the founder. 
Mr. Ford has somehow been anointed keeper of the company's conscience because of blood chemistry or something. Inevitably, he wants to be liked and wants the company to be liked. Putting a Ford in the chairmanship was probably the worst thing the company could have done at a time when Mr. Nasser was clearly set on giving the place a kick in the pants. 
In the ranking controversy, Mr. Ford soon was reported to be "concerned about the system's impact on morale." Notice how this differs from "the system is an urgent necessity so Ford can become a better company." With this kind of support, management quickly wilted in the face of pressure from the old-folks lobby (which has appointed itself guardian of anybody over 45) and other victim contingents. 
Mr. Nasser didn't help himself by appearing in a Ford diversity video haranguing an audience for containing "too many white faces" or by installing rewards for executives who meet minority hiring goals. Presto, lawsuits galore. The ones Ford will have the most trouble with are those filed by white males claiming they were victims of age discrimination in order to make way for blacks and women. 
One of the ironies, as Ford shows, is that companies these days have reasons of their own for recruiting minorities and women. Were the supposedly archaic, 19th-century principle of freedom of contract still in effect -- i.e., employers are free to hire and fire at will -- there would be a lot more affirmative action, a lot more honestly pursued. 
GE may not exactly be the rainbow coalition, but it does have a lesson for Ford. Under its version of forced rankings, 10% of managers are assigned to a bottom grade each year, which means they're cut off from the rich booty GE awards the top 20% and the job security of the workaday 70%. If low-ranked managers don't improve, they are asked to move on. 
A big difference, though, is that the process is not concentrated in a single, highly neuroticized annual ritual. GE carries on with much year-round mentoring and bellowing and measuring, so nobody has cause to be surprised by the score he gets. In fact, anyone who went to work there in the past 15 years would have known exactly what he was getting into. 
Here's the lesson: Nobody doubts that GE's hiring and firing, whatever the color or gender of the fodder, is all about business. It takes time to build a reputation for heartlessly focusing on the bottom line, but once you do, it can be liberating.

RUSSIA: INTERVIEW-Russian Tyumen Oil says foreign ties to grow.
By Sujata Rao

Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

MOSCOW, July 17 (Reuters) - Russia's Tyumen Oil Company said on Wednesday it planned huge expansion of its upstream and downstream profile through ventures with foreign oil majors. Company President Simon Kukes told Reuters in an interview that Tyumen - Russia's fourth-largest oil producer with output of 800,000 barrels per day (bpd) - would also seek a New York Stock Exchange listing in 2002 after market conditions improved. 
"We aim to be a multi-national company and the first step is in Ukraine, where we will within a year be the number one retailer of oil products," he said.
Kukes said Tyumen was also interested in Eastern Europe and in talks on projects that a included a stake in Lithuania's Mazeikiu refinery , but he declined to elaborate. 
"Eastern Europe has logistical advantages for Russian firms. We can bring in oil easily and get a significant market share. I also see a role for us in China, India and the Middle East." He said Tyumen, controlled by Russia's Alfa conglomerate, saw foreign oil majors' involvement as a key to its growth. 
"We would welcome a strategic partner to take a stake in the firm and, in fact, we are now in talks with several foreign partners, including Texaco ," Kukes said. 
He added earlier talks with Phillips had had no result. 
Tyumen is involved in the $11 billion Kovykta project with BP and several Russian firms to produce and ship gas to China, as well as in Transneft's Adria pipeline project to link outlets for Russian crude in north and south Europe. 
In August Tyumen will take a key downstream step. 
With Texaco in Moscow it will open Russia's first Star Mart convenience store in a partnership expanding its 800-strong filling network by combining them with the U.S. Star Mart brand. 
Earlier this year the firms inked a deal to jointly produce lubricants at Tyumen's LINOS refinery in Ukraine. Kukes said total investments in 2001 are planned at $800 million, with another $1 billion earmarked for each of the coming years. 
Tyumen also got a boost by being rated the World's Best Oil Company in 2000 by Financial Times Energy for "phenomenal growth in the past year, breaking into the world's top 15 oil firms." 
"By year end, we could jump from fourth to third place among Russian oil producers," said the U.S.-educated Kukes, who is part of Tyumen's efforts to boost its profile internationally. 
VERTICALLY INTEGRATED 
Tyumen is now eyeing natural gas, angling to up its Kovykta stake and in Rospan, with 600 billion cubic metres in reserves. 
Kukes sees gas as part of a strategy to develop Tyumen on the lines of Enron - producing crude, gas and power. 
"Gas is an essential component of a vertically-integrated oil company and in the way we see ourselves in future," Kukes said. "We aim that in five years, 10-15 percent of our revenues will come from gas and condensate." 
But aggressive expansion has brought Tyumen into conflict with competitors. It has locked horns with arch-rival Interros to wrest control over a stake in Kovykta, and its role in oil firm Sidanco - where BP owns 10 percent - has been criticised. 
"We'd like to get at least 25 percent in Kovykta," Kukes said, noting Tyumen was keen for BP, which has a 31 percent stake, to remain project leader. 
Tyumen also angered influential gas trader Itera by trying to obtain control over its bankrupt gas producer, Rospan. 
"Rospan is a profitable firm but for some reason was losing money," Kukes said, adding Tyumen would turn the company around.

COMMODITIES & AGRICULTURE - Enron Metals to pay fine to LME.
By ADRIENNE ROBERTS.

Enron Metals Limited - formerly MG - has agreed to pay a #190,000 fine to the London Metal Exchange after EML's systems and procedures for ensuring compliance with the exchange's rules were found to be "seriously inadequate". 
With the exception of hefty fines imposed after the Sumitomo copper scandal, this is the largest sum an LME member has yet paid. Fines for procedural shortcomings over the past four years have been between #20,000 and #90,000.
EML is charged with "persistently" failing to ensure warrants needed to settle exchange contracts reached the London Clearing House by the required time. This happened between August 1999 and February this year. 
The LME said EML's actions had jeopardised confidence in the exchange's delivery mechanism, a key aspect of its business. 
The exchange also found that between May 2000 and February 2001 EML repeatedly failed to enter trades into the exchange's matching system correctly. 
In both cases "EML frequently provided explanations that were either inadequate to explain the particular incident, or inadequate to explain the persistence of that type of incident", said the LME. 
Enron Metals, formed after Enron's purchase of UK metals trader MG last June, said the disciplinary charges related to "operating procedures during a period prior to, and the first months immediately following, Enron's acquisition of MG". 
The company added that Enron had now "implemented a series of measures to tighten up existing procedures and ensure that the operating systems meet with Enron's high standards".

(c) Telegraph Group Limited, London, 2001

THE London Metal Exchange (LME) has fined Enron Metals #190,000 for breaching its compliance regulations. 
The exchange said Enron Metals, a subsidiary of the American-owned energy giant, failed to meet deadlines for delivering warrants needed to settle its metals exchange contracts.
Warrants denote the ownership of LME-registered metal stored in warehouses. 
The group also failed to input trades into the LME's system, the exchange said. 
Enron stated that the charges related to its recently-acquired MG metals trading division before and immediately after the purchase. The group has since "tightened up existing procedures", it said.

Exxon Mobil, U.A.E. Min Discuss Dolphin Gas Proj - Report

07/18/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

DUBAI -(Dow Jones)- Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) is interested in participating in the $4 billion Dolphin Gas project, a plan between the UAE Offsets Group and Qatar Petroleum to transport natural gas from Qatar to Abu Dhabi and Dubai, the official Emirates News Agency, or WAM, reported Wednesday. 
An Exxon Mobil official and the U.A.E.'s Foreign Minister, Sheikh Hamdan bin Zayed al-Nahyan, discussed the issue Wednesday, WAM said.
The Dolphin project aims to transport two billion cubic feet a day of natural gas from Qatar's offshore North Field to the U.A.E. 
In May, Enron Corp. (ENE) sold its 24.5% stake in Dolphin back to Offsets, freeing up its share for another potential strategic partner. Enron's role would have been to focus on the midstream part of the project, or gas transportation, which requires building a 350-kilometer pipeline from a processing plant in Ras Laffan, Qatar, to the Taweelah terminal in Abu Dhabi and Jebel Ali terminal in Dubai. 
TotalFinaElf SA (TOT) is Offsets' other strategic partner, holding a 24.5% stake in the project. The company will operate the upstream phase of the project, which includes developing natural gas reserves in two blocks of the North Field. 
The first wells are scheduled to be drilled in the second half of 2001 and come onstream in 2004. 
Since Enron's withdrawal, Offsets has said it is talking to a handful of international oil companies about potential participation. 
Qatar Petroleum and Dolphin signed an initial agreement for the upstream section of the project in March. A full production sharing agreement is due to be signed in September. 
In the short term, it is expected the gas will be supplied to Dolphin by Mobil Oil Qatar's Enhanced Gas Utilization Project at the North Field.

Business
Bush switch on conservation saves credibility
David Greising

07/18/2001
Chicago Tribune
North Sports Final ; N

(Copyright 2001 by the Chicago Tribune)

Too bad we can't all be vice president. If we could, this whole "energy crisis" thing would be no big deal. 
We could send our heating bill to the Navy as Dick Cheney has. Who knows, maybe we could fuel up our cars and let the Energy Department pay the bill.
Cheney is making quite a shift from the advice he offered to consumers just a few weeks ago. "If you want to leave all the lights on in your house, you can," he counseled. "There's no law against it. But you will pay for it." 
Or, in Cheney's case, the Navy may pay for it. After all, it owns his house. 
The Vice President decided to dun the Navy on the very day administration officials spread out to promote conservation as a key part of President Bush's energy plan. 
My, how the scene has changed. In mid-May President Bush unveiled a Cheney-authored energy plan that promoted drilling and nuking and mining but overlooked conserving. That's when the vice president dismissed conservation as a "personal virtue" but no energy policy. 
The 170-page Bush policy did speak ominously of a growing "energy crisis." 
At the time, gasoline seemed headed to $3 a gallon. Rolling blackouts interrupted California's power. Winter natural gas prices had spiked. 
Bush seemed confident he could push his energy policy through a House and Senate dominated by Republicans. 
Today, with gasoline prices down around $1.35 a gallon and the Senate under Democratic control, Bush will have to give up on pet dreams like drilling for liquid gold in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. 
Conservation is all the talk--even from administration officials who can't talk. 
A laryngitis-stricken Cheney on Monday turned to wife Lynne to declare, "Conservation is a must." 
On Monday, the Energy Department declared that federal agencies since 1980 have cut their energy consumption in buildings by 30 percent. 
So the world has completely changed, right? 
Conservation now will become a centerpiece of the Bush energy policy. The caribou and moose and grizzlies in Alaska can sleep easy knowing their pristine habitat will be forever free and clear. 
Isn't it obvious that President Bush's supporters at Enron and Texaco and other oil giants should get into a more promising line of business? 
And maybe the alternative-energy researchers at Argonne National Laboratory can stop studying super-conductivity and new-age fuel cells. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham told them Monday that consumer conservation can cut the energy deficit by 60 percent over the next 20 years. 
Perhaps it's time to turn that big super-conducting super collider into the world's largest Roller Derby track. 
Well, maybe not. 
The easing of the trumped up "energy crisis" is good news. And not just because it won't cost nearly as much to drive to the Dells for summer vacation. 
It's good because it seems likely to bring some balance into whatever energy policy ultimately emerges from Congress sometime later this year. 
The Bush plan hasn't changed. There still are only a tiny $10 billion of conservation measures--half of them already in place--in the gargantuan energy program. 
But the political and market realities have changed. Energy costs are down. And conservation suddenly seems likely to get a fair hearing in Congress and at the White House. 
Perhaps most important, the free market has shown an ability to respond to a so-called "crisis" in energy. This reduces the political pressure for a quick and ill-advised political fix. 
A sudden jump in electric-plant construction means supply should grow twice as fast as demand over the next several years, according to the North American Electric Reliability Council. More than 1,000 natural gas wells are in production, double the number during early 2000. 
Gas prices are lower than had been expected because OPEC has stopped cutting production and oil giants jumped at the first sight of high prices, and production is jumping. 
We can't all turn to the Navy to bail us out of high energy prices. But in a fix, the free market does nearly as well.

COMPANIES & FINANCE INTERNATIONAL - Energy trading unit fuels 27% leap in Duke earnings.
By JULIE EARLE.

07/18/2001
Financial Times
(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved

Duke Energy, the US energy company, yesterday posted a 27 per cent leap in second quarter earnings, underpinned by strong growth at its North American natural gas and electricity trading business. 
Duke, a large utility owner in the US, said after the market closed that it earned $419m, or 53 cents a share, compared with $329m, or 44 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter.
Revenues for the quarter increased 43 per cent to $15.6bn, from $10.9bn a year earlier. 
The result met Wall Street estimates of 49 to 58 cents a share. The Charlotte-based company is one of several in the US accused of manipulating electricity prices in California, along with its competitors Reliant Energy, Dynergy, Williams and Enron. 
California's grid managers have accused wholesalers of overcharging the state by more than $6bn since last May - allegations the companies have denied. 
Last night, a Duke Energy spokesman said that California remained a small piece of the company's whole. 
He said the result was driven by strong growth in its North American energy trading segment, which reported earnings before interest and tax of $251m, a 128 per cent increase on the year-ago quarter. 
The unit's growth was fuelled by big expansion in its wholesale energy asset portfolio, which now has more than 12,600MW of merchant power generation in operation or under construction, compared with about 8,400MW net a year ago. 
Duke also has a large electric utilities operation in California. 
The company's shares closed 38 cents higher at $42.03 in New York.

Letters to the Editor: India, Pakistan and the U.S.

07/18/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A19
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Mr. Varadarajan basically asks America to abandon its traditional link to Pakistan in favor of India. He overlooks some critical facts. First, it is unclear whether India even wants to be closer to the U.S. Throughout the Cold War, India was uncomfortably close to the Soviet Union in diplomatic circles, whereas Pakistan was a reliable U.S. ally; it was vitally important in espionage efforts against the Soviets (Francis Gary Powers departed from Pakistan in his ill-fated U-2 and the U.S. conducted major operations there in the 1980s) and in offsetting pro-Soviet influence in the region. 
Smearing Pakistan and it current military president with Islamic fundamentalism is disingenuous, since the nation is practically secular when compared to its neighbors in Iran and Afghanistan. Indeed the deposed president's paeans to fundamentalism in response to domestic problems were one impetus for the military takeover in the first place. 
Despite talk of reform, India's economy is still generally hostile to foreign investment. The most notable business project of the 1990s, Enron's massive power facility in Dhabol, has been mired in bureaucracy and contract reneging. 
The question of Kashmir is a difficult one, but it is important to keep in mind that India has imposed undemocratic rule on a heavily Islamic region. Pakistan is still strategically important and is perhaps America's best friend in central Asia. It would be laudable for America to have good ties with India, but not at the expense of having to turn our back on an ally.

Business Briefs
Houston Chronicle
London exchange fines Enron $264,000
The London Metal Exchange said it fined Enron Corp. $264,000 for "seriously inadequate" compliance with trading rules that threatened to undermine confidence in the largest metals market. 
Houston-based Enron violated exchange rules over an 18-month period through late delivery of warrants, documents that confirm the completion of a metals sale, the exchange said in a statement. Enron failed to rectify its procedures despite repeated warnings, the exchange said. 
Enron's failures to comply "were repeatedly brought to the attention" of the company between last May and February of this year, exchange officials said. 
Enron admitted rules breaches in a statement, but said the violations stemmed from its acquisition last May of MG, the world's largest copper-trading company, for $445 million, which expanded the natural gas and electricity trader's metals business.

Gas Liberalization Turns Volatile For German Utility

Two years ago, the municipal utility in Heidelberg, Germany decided to do something very unusual for European utilities. It went shopping for natural gas. 
For more than 40 years, the utility, Stadtwerke Heidelberg, didn't have a choice in suppliers. As with other large industrial buyers of natural gas in Europe, it was locked into long-term supply contracts; in its case, with Ruhrgas AG and two other regional pipeline operators, which own most of the natural gas pipelines in Germany and are regulated by German authorities.
But in 1998, the European Union moved to deregulate Europe's natural gas market, freeing factories, utilities and other large industrial gas purchasers to forgo their traditional suppliers and look elsewhere. The directive took effect in August 2000. 
So when Stadtwerke Heidelberg's latest contract expired, it went shopping for gas, one of the first German utilities to do so. 
"We wanted to show that it's possible to get gas from another supplier," said Peter Erb, the utility's manager of energy trading. "All the big players in the German market were saying it's not possible." As for his traditional suppliers, Mr. Erb said, "They were very angry." 
In the end, Stadtwerke Heidelberg succeeded in finding an alternative supplier, but the utility's troubles in the open market show just how difficult the process can be. 
The utility and its new supplier, Enron Corp. of the U.S., had to negotiate with Ruhrgas and the two other natural gas providers for six months before they could get access to transmission pipelines. They also had to navigate through a confusing thicket of tariffs, rules and technical requirements. 
Although the EU's gas directive required pipeline owners to provide non-discriminatory access to their system, it didn't make clear how that would be done. As many would-be gas suppliers quickly learned, negotiating such access can be very tough. The rules differ in different European nations and the pipeline owners can use the confusing regulations to their advantage to frustrate competitors. 
So far, there isn't "the degree of competition that the industrial gas users expect from a liberalized market," said Francesco Balocco, energy issues manager at the European operations of Dow Chemical Co. 
Energy consulting firm Dri-Wefa recently surveyed 59 large industrial gas buyers, and found that while 40% have sought new gas contracts, only 12% have switched suppliers. The survey identified 13 new entrants into the gas-supply market, including incumbent national players expanding in other EU countries and also large energy-trading firms such as Enron. 
Stadtwerke Heidelberg started its effort to diversify its natural-gas purchasing in December 1999, when it had just months remaining on its 20-year contract. Mr. Erb picked up the phone and started calling potential suppliers and found the most interest at Enron's German headquarters. The Houston, Texas-based natural gas giant had grown explosively at home by competing for business against monopoly gas providers, and it was looking to do the same abroad. 
It took the two companies six months to secure access to pipelines in Germany. "It's absolutely natural for a network operator that is also competing in the supply market to try to keep us off the network," said Paul Hennemeyer, Enron's director of regulatory affairs. Enron's officials ran into constant delays, were asked to supply more and more information and sometimes even had a hard time reaching the right people at the companies they were negotiating with, Mr. Hennemeyer said. 
Ruhrgas says it was trying to be helpful, but argues that lengthy negotiations were inevitable because it was tackling many access issues for the first time. "We made every contribution to provide for fair and easy access network access," said a Ruhrgas spokeswoman. "In the beginning, the system needed some time to develop." Shortly after a deal was reached, the German government spelled out new rules on pipeline access, which will make future negotiations easier. 
In Oct. 2000, Enron began to deliver gas to Stadtwerke Heidelberg, and to another German municipal utility, which followed a similar negotiating path. Stadtwerke Heidelberg moved cautiously; it bought 30% of its natural gas from Enron, with the remainder from its traditional suppliers. Enron and Stadtwerke Heidelberg won't discuss the details of their contract, though both say Enron offered a cheaper price than Stadtwerke Heidelberg's other suppliers. 
But the German utility quickly absorbed the cost-saving lessons of a deregulated market: 
Starting in October, the utility will drop Enron in favor of another company, Wingas, which has built a new pipeline to Heidelberg. The reason: a combination of a better price and the convenience of a new supply route. 
"We obviously didn't break out the Champagne," Enron's Mr. Hennemeyer recalls. But he says Enron welcomes such switching of suppliers in general as a sign of the free market.

To hear executives at Enron Corp. tell it, their company has been outgunned for years by the giant utilities in the lobbying battles in Washington over electricity policy. 
"We're a little guy," said Jeffrey K. Skilling, who served as chief executive of the Houston company until he quit last week. "We've been fighting a battle against some very big hitters."
>From 1992 to 1999, utilities spent large sums to keep electricity deregulation at bay, helping to prevent Congress from taking any action to mandate it at the local level and engineering a House restructuring bill generally viewed as favorable to utilities. That bill died in the House Commerce Committee in 1999. 
"A ferocious lobbying campaign was waged" on retail deregulation, said a former Republican aide. Southern Co., the big Atlanta-based utility holding company, made its influence felt, he added. 
In 1992, Southern hired Mississippian Haley Barbour to work for it in Washington. Barbour left in 1993 to serve as chairman of the Republican National Committee, a post he held until 1997. When he left the RNC, Southern again used his services. 
After the GOP took control of Congress in 1995, the company also had direct access to House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.), who looked out for the company's utilities in their home states. 
Reports filed last year with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission provide other insights into the source of Southern's strength in the South. In 1999, its affiliates in Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and Florida reported spending more than $20 million on various civic, political and related activities, including $250,000 for the Birmingham Early Learning Center, $323,717 for the Mississippi Power Foundation, and dozens of other gifts ranging from $5,000 to the Gulf Coast Symphony to $191,398 for community charities in north Florida. 
But Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay was cultivating his own GOP connections. A longtime fundraiser and activist for former president George Bush, Lay and Enron officials had contributed more than $550,000 to his son's presidential bid by July 1999, according to the Center for Public Integrity. 
Lay, according to a spokesman, has also helped raise money for House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Tex.) and for his Republican Majority Issues Committee, which was set up in 1999 to support House GOP members facing close races. 
Nonetheless, Southern Co. still outspent Enron on lobbying in 1999 by $4.2 million to $1.9 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. 
"People talk about Enron being big and powerful," Skilling said. "I mean, come on . . . the utilities were powerful adversaries. We're still a little company compared to them."

Traders, Old Utilities Tangle Over Wires

ATLANTA -- Last of three articles 
Ever since steamboat captain W.P. Lay founded Alabama Power Co. in 1906 to develop electricity along the Coosa River, utility companies have been stringing wires throughout the South for one purpose: so southerners could have power and light.
Now a bunch of outsiders, who buy and sell electricity but don't have a single retail customer below the Mason-Dixon line, have their sights set on those wires, and they are getting a helping hand from some powerful allies in Congress and the Bush administration. 
Aided by supercomputers, and operating out of trading rooms as big as hockey rinks, the new breed of traders buy blocks of electricity anywhere along the nation's power grid, then borrow transmission lines to ship it to the highest bidder. But to more effectively move power from where it is cheap to where it is in strong demand, they want to remove what they contend is a "wire curtain" around the South. That means forcing the southeastern utilities to relinquish control of the wires to a new, federally supervised regional authority. 
"The monopoly is the wires, and that's where the battles occur," said Jeffrey K. Skilling, who was chief executive of Houston's Enron Corp., the largest of the power merchants, until he resigned last week. 
The clash grows out of a huge federal gamble on electricity deregulation. 
In 1992, with many utility behemoths staggering under debt from cost overruns on nuclear plants and the rapid spread of computer technology putting new demands on the grid, Congress opted for a competitive market. The plan was to dismantle long-standing utility monopolies and replace them with innovative electricity companies responsive to the laws of supply and demand. 
Now these new merchants of power, along with restructured utilities that have shed their old ways and embraced the new competitive world, have become strong advocates for a free-flowing, national electricity market. But in a classic Washington lobbying confrontation, they are running into resistance from traditional utilities, exemplified by Atlanta's Southern Co., now the parent of Alabama Power and other southern utilities. 
At issue is how fast the federal government, in the wake of the California electricity crisis, should push for yet more changes. 
Last month, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), recently stocked with President Bush's pro-market appointees, ordered most utilities to negotiate with federal mediators on procedures for handing over control of their wires to a few big regional authorities. Those authorities, in turn, will build new transmission lines, do away with bottlenecks, set uniform rates and ensure equal access to all. Next month, the Senate will take up proposals to give FERC even more authority to restructure the electricity industry. 
But what is good for Enron may not necessarily be good for utility customers in the South, according to executives at Southern Co., whose affiliates dominate power sales in Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and north Florida. Southern Co., Chairman H. Allen Franklin said in a recent interview, "will not go blindly" into the system proposed by FERC. 
Although unfettered access to Southern's 26,650 miles of lines might help long-distance sellers of wholesale power such as Enron, company officials say it could mean congestion, power outages and higher prices for their 3.9 million retail customers. 
"When California was restructured, it was thought there would be massive savings," Franklin said. "Well, there haven't been." 
Building the Power Trade 
If the California energy crisis left doubts about the future of a competitive market in electricity, a visit to Houston dispels them. 
In the city's energy alley, Enron Corp. -- with annual sales of more than $100 billion last year, double those of Texaco -- is finishing a new 40-floor office building adjacent to its 50-story tower. Enron's competitors, Dynegy Inc., Reliant Energy and El Paso Energy, are a few blocks away. Duke Energy North American, merchant arm of Charlotte-based Duke Power, has settled in as well. And Calpine Corp. plans to take over 12 floors of a new 32-story building near Enron. 
These power merchants are at the center of a burgeoning unregulated wholesale market, which now handles about a quarter of U.S. electricity output. But it is still a work in progress, fluid and accommodating in the Northeast and parts of the Midwest but much less open in the South. 
In exchange for utilities opening up their transmission lines to the new wholesale market, the 1992 Energy Policy Act law allowed them to buy or build unregulated power plants outside their service areas. Many did. Quickest to embrace competition were California and the Northeast, which had long endured high power costs. To spur competition, California and some northeastern states went further, requiring utilities to sell off their regulated plants and begin buying bulk power from wholesalers. 
Many states went further still, ending their utilities' long monopoly over retail sales and allowing customers to pick their own electricity provider. 
The Northeast already was something of a mecca for power traders because of its experiments with power pooling, in which groups of utilities merge their separate transmission systems and use a central manager to market and distribute their electricity. 
Enron, formed in 1985 by the merger of two big gas-pipeline companies, was quick to seize the opportunities. Its chairman, Kenneth Lay, a former official at the Federal Power Commission, FERC's precursor, during the Nixon administration, had pioneered natural gas trading during the volatile period of pipeline deregulation in the 1980s. 
As the electricity market began to develop in the early 1990s, Lay and Skilling, a weekend dirt biker with a degree from Harvard Business School, began applying some of the lessons learned in the natural gas markets. 
Enron signed its first long-term power contract in 1989, Skilling recalls. Independent companies that wanted to install gas-fired generators and sell the power on the grid could buy the gas from Enron under long-term contract -- then sell the electricity back to Enron. 
"We started creating forward and futures markets" using "a lot more financial engineering" than was required in other commodity businesses, Skilling said. By the late 1990s, Enron was buying the output of generating plants days, weeks, months and even years before it was produced, using sophisticated weather and economic data to predict a price at which it could be profitably sold. 
During the past five years, Enron has been one of the nation's fastest-growing companies. Its net income rose 40 percent in the second quarter of this year, although the price of a share has sunk to less than half of its 2000 high of $90, mainly because of setbacks in businesses unrelated to electricity. Investors pushed the price still lower after Skilling's departure last week. 
Southern Inhospitality 
Like other merchants, Enron plunged into California after the legislature opened up that giant state to electricity competition. But the Southeast remained less-friendly territory. 
Texas is the only southern state to adopt retail deregulation. Florida goes so far as to ban out-of-state companies from building almost any plant for the wholesale market. 
The region is the domain of huge traditional utilities that control the wires from Louisiana to Florida and up into Appalachia and the Carolinas. The web of power lines, tied to the utilities' coal-, nuclear- and gas-fired generating plants, reaches across states via 500-kilovolt workhorses and down into neighborhoods served via single wires strung on wooden poles. 
For Southern Co., its reputation as a traditional utility heavy is a badge of pride. In 1997, it displayed a picture of a gorilla on its annual report. 
Clustered around its borders are Entergy, another huge holding company that serves Louisiana, Arkansas, and parts of Mississippi and Texas; Florida Power & Light; Carolina Power & Light; Duke Power; and the federal government's centralized power giant, the Tennessee Valley Authority. 
Those utilities have been under little pressure from customers to share the lines with wholesale competitors in the interest of lower prices. Prices run 15 percent or more below the national average, thanks to a rich lode of coal and natural gas and general public acceptance of the high-tension lines that carry the power generated by those fuels. 
FERC, in a series of orders from 1996 to 2000, required utilities to open their wires for power shipments by independent merchants and to post how much transmission capacity they have available at any given time. The message, a former official said, was "they couldn't use the wires to preclude others from getting their juice to market." 
But merchants say it is difficult to ascertain the accuracy of the postings made by the southeastern utilities because they operate the transmission lines as part of their closed, plant-to-customer systems. 
A November 2000 FERC staff investigation of bulk power markets in the Southeast concluded that the transmission monopoly enjoyed by the region's utilities has discouraged independent power producers from siting new plants in the region. 
FERC investigators cited Southern Co.'s refusal to let SkyGen Energy Inc. connect to its transmission lines in Alabama. Southern said the added load "would cause an area-wide stability problem for electric supply." 
In that case, FERC denied SkyGen's request for relief. 
Enron Vice President Kevin Presto said that day-ahead sales to customers such as municipal utilities in Southern's territory have become possible. But he said Enron has trouble getting long-term transmission commitments from Southern that would enable it to sell such power regularly. Also, he said, Enron cannot easily move power long distances through Southern's grid. "If I tried to buy transmission across Southern Co. to Jacksonville Electric, there'd be zero available," Presto said. 
Of the overall situation in the Southeast, he said that the utilities "give you 0 to 5 percent of their transmission capability because they preserve the rest of it for native load [retail customers]. So you have a huge highway that's supposed to promote the free sale of electrons that isn't available to the wholesalers." 
Southern Co. Chairman Franklin dismissed as "unfounded" the complaints of the merchants, and officials representing Alabama and Georgia municipal utilities tied to Southern Co.'s lines say they generally have been treated well. 
Robert Johnston, president of the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia (MEAG), which supplies power to 48 towns, took issue with the notion of a wire curtain. 
"The market is growing in Georgia," he said. MEAG has its own trading room and has done business with a hundred or so traders or independent power producers. It also has its own generators producing power at four sites, though Southern Co. has an interest in all of them. 
"There's not a grass-roots interest" driving the reforms, Franklin said. "It's the wholesale players." 
While it squares off against the newcomers in the Southeast, though, Southern itself has aggressively exploited the growing wholesale market. Until it was spun off as a separate company earlier this year, Mirant Corp., Southern Co.'s marketing subsidiary, competed in California, the Midwest and the North, supplementing leaner profits from Southern Co.'s regulated units. 
"Southern's strategy has been clear: Compete elsewhere and run a monopoly at home," said Allen Mosher, director of policy analysis at the American Public Power Association. 
Well Connected for Battle 
The next move is up to the federal government. 
Next month, Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.), chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, plans to propose legislation giving FERC expanded powers over wholesale transactions and transmission, so that "vested interests" will not be able to "manipulate the use of the transmission system" to benefit their own plants, Bingaman's office said. 
In the House, key players will be Commerce Committee Chairman W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.), whose state is home to Southern Co.'s western neighbor, Entergy, and Rep. Joe Barton (R-Tex.), chairman of the energy and environment subcommittee, who has had close ties to the huge coal-dependent Texas utility TXU. 
Last week, Entergy hired former FERC chairman Curt L. Hebert Jr., a Mississippi prote{acute}ge{acute} of Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.), to handle regulatory and government affairs. 
Enron recently hired a former aide to House Majority Leader Richard K. Armey (R-Tex.), as well as a former senior spokesman in the Bush campaign, Edward Gillespie of Quinn Gillespie & Associates. 
Enron officials are counting on support from House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Tex.), the hometown Houston congressman, though it is uncertain how much influence DeLay, an enthusiast for electricity deregulation, can bring to bear. 
Industry lobbyists who gathered on Capitol Hill in July for closed-door meetings that DeLay sponsored, but did not attend, could not reach consensus on electricity. As a result, the energy bill passed by the House on Aug. 2 skirted key issues involving greater accessibility to the grid and electricity reliability. 
Bush's election, and the fact that many utilities have plunged enthusiastically into the competitive market, clearly has created a more favorable political climate for the power merchants. Bush's first two appointees to FERC, Pat Wood III and Nora Mead Brownell, moved quickly to fix what they viewed as the Washington electricity bottleneck. 
Wood had worked with Enron during a six-year effort to create a more competitive energy market in Texas, where Wood headed the state's public utility commission. Brownell, a former Pennsylvania utility regulator, won praise from Enron in 1997 when she helped block a restructuring plan that Enron contended would keep it out of the Philadelphia market. 
On July 11, with a majority in tow, Wood, Brownell and William L. Massey, a Clinton appointee who is an ardent supporter of competition, tossed out proposals by Southern Co. and other utilities and directed utilities throughout the country to commence negotiations with federal mediators on handing over control of their lines to four independent regional transmission organizations, or RTOs. 
"It was about time [a bomb] was dropped," Wood said. 
But FERC's action may only have been what power association's Mosher calls the "beginning of a long movie." 
Among those opposing expanded FERC authority are environmentalists who are fearful that new federal powers could lead to an expansion of high-voltage power lines; western property-rights advocates; and state utility regulators. Politically well-connected groups not now regulated by FERC -- including the TVA, rural electric co-ops and municipal power systems -- are also wary of new federal powers. 
"There are big questions about FERC's role, who will determine transmission-line charges, should there be federal [authority] to site power lines, should there be FERC jurisdiction over power generation and reliability," said Rep. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), vice chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. 
Idaho utility regulator Marsha Smith, who heads the electricity committee for the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, noted that her state's three investor-owned utilities cannot transfer ownership or control of their transmission lines "without our approval." 
Such approval does not seem likely anytime soon. Smith noted that 60 percent of the state's power comes from hydroelectric dams. "That's public property," she said. 
In Alabama, James Sullivan, a state utility regulator overseeing Southern Co.'s affiliate, said he was not happy about the way FERC was proceeding. 
"I'm opposed to any [changes to] our electric system in Alabama until I know it's going to bring rates down and enhance reliability for us," he said. 
In the view of Southern Co. Chairman Franklin, it is still an "open question" whether FERC has the legal authority to force utilities to surrender control of all their wires. 
Nonetheless, the restructuring of the power markets may already have gone too far to "put the genie back in the bottle," according to a former FERC official. 
The power merchants readily concur. 
"Everybody's paying too much because you've got this huge conservatism built into this bureaucratic operation of the utilities," Enron's Presto said.

Relentless Search for Growth Humbles a Mutual Fund Star
By PATRICK McGEEHAN

08/23/2001
The New York Times

c. 2001 New York Times Company

James D. McCall was one of Wall Street's best stock pickers in the late 1990's, his hand so hot that Merrill Lynch, eager to revive sales of its mutual funds, paid a ransom to his previous employer to win his services. Starting early last year, Merrill's brokers collected more than $1.5 billion from their clients for Mr. McCall to invest. 
But in a breathtaking reversal of fortune, Mr. McCall has compiled one of the worst investment records of the new century with that money. All but about $650 million has been lost, leaving shares that cost many Merrill customers more than $10 each worth slightly more than $2.
As of Tuesday, Mr. McCall's main fund, Merrill Lynch Focus Twenty, held the rare distinction of ranking in the bottom 1 percent among funds of its kind for the previous day, week, month, quarter and year, according to Morningstar Inc., a company that analyzes mutual funds. 
Though Mr. McCall is free to invest anywhere in the stock market, he has stuck to a growth-seeking strategy that kept the fund invested primarily in technology stocks throughout that sector's long, steep decline. Down almost 80 percent in the last year, the fund's performance has been significantly worse than that of the average technology fund, let alone its peer group of more diversified funds. It did, however, register aggressive gains in two market rallies. 
Lately, the Focus Twenty fund seemingly went from bad to cursed as some of Mr. McCall's favorite stocks were laid even lower by a series of unfortunate surprises. His bigger holdings include Enron, whose shares fell 8 percent after its chief executive suddenly resigned, and Ciena, which dropped 30 percent in a day on disappointing earnings. 
''It has been a miserable week,'' Mr. McCall allowed in an interview on Tuesday. ''It's not easy managing a portfolio like this in this type of an environment.'' 
Mr. McCall's rapid rise and fall demonstrates how fleeting stock-picking stardom can be, said John C. Bogle, founder of the Vanguard Group mutual fund company. Too often, Mr. Bogle said, investors chase after the past returns of the fund manager of the moment, only to find out they were pursuing a ''comet.'' (Investors in Vanguard's own aggressive growth fund, Vanguard Growth Equity, have had their shares drop 53 percent in value from their peak 17 months ago.) 
Still, Vanguard is known for its index funds -- the antithesis of Mr. McCall's stock-picking discipline -- and Mr. Bogle is indexing's most outspoken champion. In speeches around the country, he has repeatedly and coyly -- avoiding any mention of Merrill's name -- cited the giant brokerage firm's creation of Focus Twenty and another fund in March 2000 as an example of racing to cash in on the latest market fad. 
In roughly five weeks, Merrill's brokers gathered a total of more than $2 billion for Focus Twenty and the Internet Strategies fund. Almost immediately, those funds collapsed along with the Internet and technology stocks they owned. Internet Strategies, which Mr. McCall does not manage, never recovered and has now lost more than 80 percent of its value; Merrill plans to merge it with another of its stock funds. 
But Mr. McCall, 47, said his fund did not face a similar fate. Indeed, he said, Robert Doll, the chief investment officer for Merrill's funds, recently told the firm's brokers that Merrill was committed to Focus Twenty and its aggressive, concentrated style. 
Mr. Doll was not available for comment, but Merrill confirmed Mr. McCall's account. ''We are committed to having a full range of investment styles, aggressive growth being one of them,'' said a spokesman, Erik Hendrickson. 
Funds seeking to rack up market-beating returns by making big bets on as few as 20 stocks proliferated in the late 1990's, in part because of Mr. McCall's success managing the PBHG Large Cap 20 fund for Pilgrim Baxter, a fund company in Wayne, Pa. In the two and a half years Mr. McCall ran it, the PBHG fund ranked first among its peer group -- funds that buy stocks of large companies whose earnings are expected to grow quickly -- with average annual returns of more than 50 percent. 
It was those knockout numbers that brought Merrill calling in its search for proven growth-fund managers to broaden the firm's value-oriented lineup of funds. After Mr. McCall accepted Merrill's job offer, Pilgrim Baxter sued to stop him from breaking his employment contract. Mr. McCall countersued, and Merrill later agreed to pay an undisclosed sum to settle the litigation. 
In court papers, Pilgrim Baxter disclosed that Mr. McCall had earned as much as $1.5 million annually there. Mr. McCall and Merrill officials have repeatedly declined to reveal how much the firm paid Pilgrim Baxter or any details of Mr. McCall's compensation at Merrill. Often, however, investment returns affect the pay of fund managers. 
Like Focus Twenty, most of the concentrated funds sank last year with the collapse of technology stocks. The managers of some of those funds, including Marsico Focus, have shifted money out of volatile technology and telecommunications stocks and into more mature companies, like Citigroup and Omnicom, which owns ad agencies. 
Mr. McCall sniffed at some of those choices, saying that the fund managers were not staying true to their mission of aggressive growth investing. 
''I'm not going to own an Omnicom,'' he said, ''or a Sony or a Viacom or General Dynamics, because they're growing in the single digits.'' Thomas Marsico, the manager of Marsico Focus and one of the original concentrated-fund managers, did not return a call seeking comment. 
Mr. McCall said he would continue to try to identify the companies that have the best chance of increasing their profits at extraordinary rates, regardless of what value other investors are assigning to those prospects at any given time. 
''Valuation is not one of the factors that enters into our methodology,'' Mr. McCall said. 
About 70 percent of Focus Twenty's assets are in technology stocks, according to Morningstar. But the fund's biggest holding now is Idec Pharmaceuticals, a drug maker. 
Kunal Kapoor, a Morningstar analyst who tracks Merrill's funds, calls Mr. McCall a momentum investor who seeks ''growth at any price.'' Mr. McCall may be the best investor of that stripe, Mr. Kapoor said, but the strategy is so risky that he questions whether it was ever appropriate for so many of Merrill customers. 
''I was really surprised by the amount of funds they were able to raise for a fund like that in such a short time,'' Mr. Kapoor said. ''The question is: Do you really need a fund like this?'' 
Reading a prepared statement, Mr. Hendrickson said Merrill Lynch considered concentrated funds to be ''an appropriate option'' for some investors, because they ''maximize the impact of professional stock-picking over the long term and additionally may serve as an alternative to individual stock holdings.'' 
He pointed out that Merrill managed another concentrated fund, Merrill Lynch Focus Value, that had performed well this year, gaining more than 3 percent. 
As for Mr. McCall's returns, Mr. Kapoor said he could not fault Focus Twenty because it had performed as would be expected for a fund of its composition. It rang up some of the biggest gains of any fund in two brief periods when the market picked up -- the third quarter of 2000 and April of this year -- and some of the biggest losses when the market was down. 
Rather, he said he was more disappointed with the other fund Mr. McCall manages, the Merrill Lynch Premier Growth fund, which is supposed to be less volatile because it holds about 50 stocks. That fund is down more than 50 percent this year and has shrunk to less than $100 million in assets. 
Mr. McCall said that he had warned Merrill's brokers all along just how volatile his returns could be and that Focus Twenty was no place for investors to put money they might need any time soon. 
But, he said, he thinks that now, more than ever, is the time to take a chance on the fund, with its shares selling for about $2.20. 
''I don't think $2 a share is a lot to risk,'' the indomitable fund manager said. ''We could go down from here certainly, but over the long term, there is more potential on the upside than on the downside.''

If the state of New York avoids brownouts this summer, it will be due in a small way to the efforts of Andrew Gillespie, a young electricity trader who works for Mirant Corp. in an Atlanta suburb. 
Mirant grew out of Atlanta-based Southern Co.'s aggressive attempt to enter the unregulated market that was developing outside its home region. Early this year, Southern spun off Mirant as a separate company that Wall Street stock traders value at about $11 billion.
Gillespie spends much of the day staring at a map of New York that glows green on his computer screen. The map displays the prices at which electricity is selling at key points on the state's power grid. 
One summer day, Gillespie called a trader who buys electricity from New England's centralized power pool, which manages power sales from regional utilities such as New England Power, Boston Edison and Central Maine Power. 
He agreed to buy 14 megawatts over a 16-hour period the next day and pay about $9,000. He used the phone to offer the power to the New York Independent System Operator, a nonprofit organization set up to manage the state's wholesale market and its high-voltage transmission system, for a small markup. 
Then he waited to find out whether the offer was accepted. If it was, he would go online to book a transmission route. If not, he would unload the power on another trader in the over-the-counter market, made up of merchant companies such as Enron Corp., Dynegy Inc., Duke Energy North America, Reliant Energy, El Paso Merchant Group, Calpine Corp. and Entergy-Koch Power Marketing. 
Traders like the Northeast because it allows one-stop shopping. "If I want to wheel power from Maine through Massachusetts to Connecticut, I pay just one transmission charge rather than having to call each utility and schedule it," said Michael Hobbs, Mirant's marketing director for the northeastern United States. 
In the South, traders say, booking transmission can be a lot more complicated -- and sometimes impossible. Utilities operate their own contained systems and advise traders when and if they have "ATC," available transmission capacity. 
Electricity trading is a commodity business not unlike selling wheat, platinum or hog bellies, though it is trickier than most, according to Marce Fuller, Mirant's chief executive, because electricity can't be stored. 
"Information is paramount," Hobbs said, so Mirant traders keep a constant eye on weather reports and also consult the company's on-site meteorologist. To provide further assistance, a digital board that wraps around the trading room updates information ranging from the temperature and humidity in Brazos County, Tex., to the spot price of electricity at "COB," traders' slang for the California-Oregon border. 
The jobs of the traders at Mirant, Enron and the other companies didn't exist a few years ago, and neither did most of the companies. Regulated utilities, co-ops and a few big government power agencies, such as the Tennessee Valley Authority, generated almost all of the power and shipped it to retail customers over their own wires. 
Now roughly a quarter of the electricity produced in the United States comes from unregulated companies that sell almost exclusively to the long-distance bulk-power trade -- the wholesale market.

UK: Copper pushes ahead in subdued LME pre-market.

08/23/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Copper prices rebounded in London Metal Exchange (LME) pre-market trade on Thursday, having fallen through the psychological $1,500 a tonne level the previous evening, traders said. 
"There was nothing on the close last night to suggest anything happening, and there was no interest overnight, but this morning we've seen a number of the electronic screens - particularly Enron - being marked higher," said one senior trader.
Three months copper was indicated at $1,513/1,515 at 0850 GMT, up $11 from Wednesday's evening kerb close. 
"The market hasn't given up the ghost yet. There's still some room to push higher, with minor technical resistance around $1,525," the trader said. 
With consumer buying still largely absent, trading conditions remained subdued, however. 
"The appeal of the markets is limited at the moment. Too many fingers have been burned - you can still see a lot of the specs sidelining themselves," the trader said. 
"We've suffered consumer destocking in the first and second quarters. There's a bit of weakness in the U.S. dollar, which is helpful, but business confidence isn't great." 
Despite periodic short-covering rallies, the overall downtrend remains in place pending concrete evidence of an upturn in the economic situation, analysts said. 
"The short-term moving averages may be a bit more constructive after last week's rally, but the trend is still down. I remain sceptical for the time being," the trader said. 
Aluminium also pushed higher in early trade, indicated up $5 at $1,428/1,430. 
Initial resistance is evident at $1,430 with a stiffer upside barrier at $1,440, analysts said. 
Nickel edged up $20 to $5,720/5,750, shrugging off news that Russia's Norilsk Nickel had restarted work at its key nickel plant, which was halted after an accident on Sunday. 
"The third smelting furnace started working at 0400 local time (2000 GMT) on August 23," spokesman Yevgeny Yerokhin told Reuters. "By this time another two furnaces had already started working." 
"The plant will fully restore its production volumes by the end of the day on August 24," he added. 
The smelting division of the nickel plant, in the Norilsk region on the northern Siberian Taimyr peninsula, was halted on Sunday after a leak of melted metal damaged water cooling systems and electricity supply lines. 
The plant's management has promised to catch up with the output arrears stemming from the accident within a month. 
The rest of the complex was little moved in early trade. 
Zinc was indicated unchanged at $849/852, showing little response to overnight news thatthe U.S. Defense National Stockpile Center (DNSC) had cancelled its remaining long-term zinc sales in fiscal year 2001 after it failed to make any zinc award in its latest bid invitation. 
"DNSC anticipates resuming sales in the first quarter of fiscal year 2002 depending on market conditions," it said in a statement. The DNSC had been offering prime western zinc for sale by sealed bid on a monthly basis. 
Lead was also unchanged at $480/483, with tin up $10 at $3,870/3,900 and alloy down $5 at $1,180/1,190 after a hefty 1,580-tonne increase in LME stocks.

Papers on Dabhol project not received

08/23/2001
The Times of India
Copyright (C) 2001 The Times of India; Source: World Reporter (TM)

MUMBAI: The consumers' representative for the Maharashtra Electricity regulatory Commission (MERC), ``Prayas,'' has not yet received the sheaf of documents from the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) concerning the Dabhol power project (DPC) which it had asked for. 
The MERC had passed an order on July 31 asking the MSEB to furnish the financial documents relating to some contracts signed by Enron for the project. The MSEB is learnt to be now examining the legality of making these documents public after a stern letter from the Dabhol Power Company, pointing out that the board might be liable for ``damages and legal action'' if the contractors take offence to making the documents public.
Enron wrote to the MSEB a few days after the order, contending that most of these documents had confidentiality clauses which would make it actionable. Asked about this, sources at DPC said that suppliers would be upset if their terms and conditions were made public since Enron's is only one of the plants sourcing business from them. For instance, Enron's LNG fuel supply contract with an Oman company has a confidentiality clause and would fear exposing its contract terms to the public in view of the fact that over 80 per cent of its supply is concentrated in Japan, Taiwan and Korea. ``It would be damaging for its business if our deal, which is less than 18 per cent of its business, ends up influencing its other deals,'' the source said.

INDIA: ANALYSIS-Poor governance hobbles India's reform drive...

ANALYSIS-Poor governance hobbles India's reform drive 
By Alan Wheatley, Asian Economics Correspondent
NEW DELHI, Aug 22 (Reuters) - After six months of political stalemate, the rave reviews for Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha's reforming budget have given way to the despairing conclusion that perhaps India embraces change only in a crisis. 
In which case, a new wave of reforms might not be far away. 
For unless growth picks up substantially from last year's 5.2 percent pace, policy experts said India would face a further deterioration in its public finances and rising unemployment that could put the world's largest democracy under serious strain. 
"We can't go on without further reforms for very long because we won't be able to grow even by five percent," said Shashanka Bhide, chief economist of the National Council of Applied Economic Research. 
"So the crisis is already there. If we're not going to get six percent-plus growth rates, then it's a political problem." 
There is a broad consensus - on paper - on the need for a second wave of reforms to build on ground-breaking liberalisation measures rushed in after a balance-of-payments crisis in 1991. 
Because its economy is fairly closed, India has weathered the current global downturn much better than most of its Asian neighbours, who would be delighted with five percent growth. 
Still, output has slowed for two years in a row as post-reform momentum has petered out. And crucially, five percent growth falls far short of the 8.7 percent average needed over the next decade to achieve Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee's goal of doubling per capita income, currently around $460 a year. 
"Eight million people come into the workforce every year and a five percent growth rate would leave large numbers of people unemployed, which means there will be greater social unrest," said P Chidambaram, a former finance minister. 
"A five percent growth rate, while statistically acceptable, is simply politically unacceptable and socially unacceptable." 
COMPETITIVE POLITICS 
It was to raise the economy's speed limit that Sinha unveiled in his February budget a raft of far-reaching structural reforms making it easier to fire workers and rolling back the policy of reserving certain industries for small and medium-sized firms. 
The reforms are high on the list of the many blueprints for change in India but they soon became mired in what the Planning Commission aptly calls the "compulsion of competitive politics". 
On a charitable view, the slow progress is a reflection of the wondrous kaleidoscope that is India's multi-party democracy. 
"This is not a country, this is a vast continent in search of a synthesis in the political domain, the social domain and the economic domain," said Amit Mitra, secretary general of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry. 
Less charitably, the legislative paralysis is due to the failure by an enfeebled Vajpayee to crack heads in his unwieldy 19-party coalition and force ministers to put the national interest before the myriad vested interests opposed to change. 
Arjun Sengupta, a professor at the Centre for Policy Research, said the absence of a unified agenda meant each member of the coalition was ploughing its own furrow, resulting in policy inconsistency that was deterring badly needed investment. 
"This is the main problem we have today: we do not have a coherent, unified policy framework," Sengupta said. 
He said the reform task facing the government was all the more difficult because India's most populous and backward states were falling farther and farther behind the better-off ones. 
"If the Centre cannot take care of the problems of disparity between the states, we are facing major problems which can become explosive," Sengupta, a former ambassador and IMF official, said. 
Peering through the gloom, optimists point to the precedent of legislation passed without the pressure of a crisis in 1999 to open up India's insurance market to foreign firms. 
They hope two equally controversial reform bills, to liberalise the crisis-ridden power sector and to make it easier to wind up bankrupt firms, will also eventually become law after they won cabinet approval last week, ending months of wrangling. 
"Anybody who says reforms have been a failure in this country hasn't looked at figures on poverty very closely," said Planning Commission member N.K. Singh. He said the poverty rate had fallen in the past decade to 27 percent from 37 percent. 
REFORM PRIORITIES 
The list of reforms needed to sustain this improvement is lengthy. Because of its pivotal role in the economy, the power sector is many experts' number one priority. The well-catalogued troubles that foreign firms such as Enron Corp have encountered dealing with India's all-but-bankrupt state power boards have flashed warning signals to potential foreign investors. 
Domestic investors have also been deterred because industrial users pay twice as much as they would in China for electricity. 
Nevertheless, attempts at serious reform have foundered on twin political rocks: how to end overmanning at the power boards, estimated at 50-70 percent, and how to charge users, mainly farmers, market rates for stolen or heavily subsidised power. 
D.K. Srivastava, a professor at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, said politicians might consider tough measures if they could be assured that benefits would be visible before they have to seek re-election two or three years later. 
"Any government under any minister will say to you, How can I survive unless I can show my voters jobs?'," Srivastava said. "This is one of the basic constraints on power sector reform." 
T.K. Bhaumik, a senior adviser at the Confederation of Indian Industry, agreed and said reformers were partly to blame for having failed to sell the case for change to India's mass poor. 
"We did not articulate the economic reform process to the people," Bhaumik said. On privatisation, for instance, policy-makers did not spell out the consequences for jobs. 
"I don't think we really understood the issues properly. We simply followed the Washington consensus and that didn't go down well with the people," he said. 
As Divestment Minister Arun Shourie knows only too well. The privatisation programme he oversees, a litmus test of India's reform will, is stalled because of what Shourie calls "fractured" politics and "noise" generated by corporate interests.
