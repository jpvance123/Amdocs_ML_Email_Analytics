Transwestern Pipeline Company

Transwestern has run into some problems with the air permit conditions for 
the Redrock Expansion.  For the state permits, the ADEQ wants to abitrarily 
set a 10% safety factor to the emissions levels which approach PSD. This 
means that they have written into the draft permit a reduction in the 
allowable hours of operation for  the generator from 8760 to 7800.  This 
generator is the facility's prime source of power and therefore, needs to be 
operated for 8760 hours.  Transwestern will challenge the agency's authority 
to apply a 10%safety factor.

For the Indain lands permits, the EPA has written a permit condition of 25 
ppmvd for NOx and CO under all operating conditions.  Manufacturerers 
guarantees only apply at 25 ppmvd at loads above 65% and at 0F.  It appears 
that Transwestern may have convenienced the EPA to back away from permit 
limits in ppmvd and include as permit conditons lb/hr and ton/yr emissions 
limits that Transwestern originally placed into its applications.

Northern Natural Gas Company

A standard exemption for the NNG Martin Co. No. 1 facility was submitted to 
the TNRCC.  Preliminary maintenance activities and newly published AP-42 
emissions factors have shown that the Martin Co. 1 facility may be a Title V 
facility.  Under the old AP-42 factors, the units at the facility were not 
greater than 100 ton/year sources.  Continued investigation  is being 
conducted to determine emissions levels from the units at the facility. 

EOTT
A request and supporting documentation was submitted to the TNRCC to remove 
the EOTT Crane facility from the Title V operating permit program.  New data 
on the crude oil received into the facility shows the emissions limits for 
VOCs to be less than the Title V regulated limit. 

General

Preparations are being  finalized for the environmental roundtable to be held 
next week in Albuquerque.

The third quarter PCB meeting with Southern California Gas Company was held 
this morning.  SoCal presented a third quarter invoce of their PCB management 
and disposal activities for which Transwestern is responsible for 
$120,602.19.  All charges were appropriate and considered normal operating 
expenses for PCB activities in California.

The public hearing was held in Williams, AZ for the Kingman and Flagstaff air 
permits under the Redrok Expansion.  There were no comments or concerns 
brought up at the meeting as no individuals came to the meeting.  An email 
was received from the ADEQ presenting the minor additions which will be added 
to each permit.  Each comment and addition will not impact or change the 
draft permits which were received earlier this month.  The permits for 
Klagetoh and Luepp were received from the EPA last week.  The permits from 
the ADEQ for the Kingman and Flagstaff C/S will be issued the later part of 
this week. 

Attended the incident investigation and technical writing workshop in Omaha.

Assisted the Mountainair team with the semiannual Title V compliance 
monitoring report  for C/S No.7.

A meeting was held in Phoenix, Az with PG&E to review charges and invoices by

A meeting has been scheduled on 3/16 with the California Fish and Game to 
discuss the following issues:  1)presentaiton of the 1999 and 2000 annual 
reports which are required by the facility's 2081 permit. 2) developing an 
agreement with F&G as to how the 41 acre credits held by EOTT will be managed 
to ensure compliance with requirements of the F&G. 3) Presentation of the 
results relating to surveys conducted in the path of construction for the 
Rogas project.

The waiver to lay pipeline above ground for the Rogas constsruction was 
approved by the Offfice of the State Fire Marshall, Pipeline Safety 
Division.  There were 8 city, county, state and federal agencies notified by 
application for approval to construct the 9 mile pipline system consisting of 
3 piplines.  This is the only agency approval received as yet.

Acre credits were obtained from Aera for the construction of the Rogas 
pipeline.  Aera is an oil company with major holdings of acreage available 
for purchase.  It was felt that due to the time constraints for initiating 
this project and the concern with not receiving the credits from the F&G that 
EOTT would purchase Aera credits to ensure procurement of the necessary 
acreage for the Rogas project.  This is a major plus for the project.

The rough draft of the baseline noise survey for the turbine installations in 
Az. was received.  Some changes will be made in each document.,  as the 
contractor has made some obvious conclusions and asumptions which are not 
valid or representative of the mitigation Transwetern will do.  The Navajo 
Nation has requested that an onsite survey be conducted at the C/S on the 
reservation (C/S 3 and 4)  for T&E plants and animals and archeology.  A 
contractor has been notified and surveys will be completed by 3/12. The F-1 
environmental report  for the FERC application will be submitted to Donna by 
this friday.   

The air permit applications for C/S 1 and 2 have been started.   A meeting 
with EPA in San Francisco has abeen set to discuss permitting the C/S 
facilities on the reservation on 3/20.  After the meeting, applications 
should be in front of the Navajo air permitting agency and the EPA within a 
week. Air permits are expected  within 5-7 months after submittal of the 
application.  During a conference call this week, a proposal was submitted to 
remove the existing auxillary generators and replace with 2 units at each 
location.  This will delay submittal of the air applications 3-4 days, 
assuming no major issues result.  One interesting issue that might develop is 
that one of the generators might possibly be a wind turbine.

NORTHERN NATURAL GAS COMPANY

Submitted Title V Permit Renewal for Mullinville Compressor to the KDHE.

Submittal of standard exemption documention for the NNG Kermit, Plainview, 
Seminole and Brownfield C/S's were submitted to the TNRCC.

TRANSWESTERN PIPELINE COMAPNY

A conference call was held with Region IX EPA to discuss Redrock Expansion 
issues related to the issuance of Title V air permits for Sat. 3 and 4 which 
are on Indain lands.  The agency provided a tentative date of 7 weeks before 
the the permits would be issued.  The EPA has required Transwestern to 
respond to issues related to the Endangered Species Act prior to issuance of 
the air permit.  Transwestern is in the process of preparing a biological 
assessment for the properties within the facility fences of stations 3 and 4.

A meeting was held with the Arizona DEQ to discuss what activities 
Transwestern may participate in to assist the agency with the issuance of the 
air permits for Station 1 and 2.  The agency gave a date of April 2002 as a 
normal issue date.  Even under expidited conditions the date is expected to 
be mid December of this year.  Transwestern plans on actively pursuing ADEQ's 
management to determine if the date for issuance can be further decreased.  
On a side note, under the current Arizona regulations, certain construction 
activities can begin in leau of receiving the permit and include; foundation 
construction, laying underground piping and consturction of permenant 
underground structures. This wil benefit the inbitiation of the Redrock 
construction prior to receivng the air permits for these stations.

Randy, this is a short summary of the environmental findings that were 
identified during the records review conducted at the Corpus Christi Koch 
facility offices on May 1st and 2nd of this year.

All environmental records which were available in the file data room at the 
Koch office  were reviewed.  Assumptions were made that the environmental 
records were complete for all assets included in the sale.  Primary emphasis 
was placed on those environmental issues which are normally associated with a 
sale or purchase of assets dealing with distribution and transmission of 
crude oil. In particular, pipeline and tank farms were the most critical 
assets which were reviewed. 

Based upon the data review, the Koch assets were in compliance with the 
following:

  Air permitting, permit by rule, standard expemtions, recordkeeping and fee 
payments were documented 

  NSPS recordkeeping and inspections for VOC control on large crude oil tanks 
were documented 

  Oil Pollution Act-OPA 90 plans had been prepared and were up to date

  SARA compliance and reporting had been completed

  SPCC plans had been prepared for each site which qualified under 40 CFR 112

  Spill reporting history and notifications to the state agency were 
available for review

   There are ongoing groundwater and soil remediation activities at one site 
included in the asset for sale
     (permits for the remediation activity is in place)

  Hazardous waste notifications, annual reportings and fee payments were 
documented

Based upon the above review, there were no issues which could be identified 
which would be condsidered a major environmental limitation or would be a 
considered a major environmental  liability.  This statement is again based 
upon the assumption that all environmental information was present in the 
data room for the assets in question.  It should also be stated that this 
analysis of Koch's environmental compliance is based upon the fact that Koch 
has not held back or provided false or misleading information or knowledge 
during their presentation or informaiton contained in the facility files.

Pending further development and interest of this potential purchase, a 
recommendation is made to conduct a phase I due diligence and site visit to 
each location to verify findings from the records review.   Also, due to the 
past history of Koch's operating practices, it is recommended that contract 
conditions be implicitly stated that EOTT will not be held liable for 
discoveries of past deficiencies or releases of contamination which have 
occurred on any of the Koch assets purchased.

Had a conversation with Dan Walker, V.P. of Development for the Rocky 
Mountain Elk Foundation concerning Enron's future as a partner.  Dan will be 
meeting with the CEO of the Foundation to pursue actions towards an Agreement 
or MOU between Enron and the RMEF.  Interest has been surprisingly high for 
employees within and without GPG expressing a desire to be involved with the 
Foundation.  

Assisted C/S No. 8, Corona with the development and submittal of the 
facility's Title V semi annual report and annual compliance certification 
report submittals.

Presented annual pollution prevention training for the Kingman and Flagstaff 
teams as required by the State of Arizona for large quantity generators of 
hazardous waste.

Received a Compliance Order from the State of New Mexico, Air Quality Bureau, 
for an outstanding turbine replacement activity at the P-1 C/S which occurred 
in 1996.   Transwestern had met with the AQB over this issue in 1996 and 
assumed that the issue had been resolved. The issue in question was 
Transwestern's replacement of internal components from a smaller turbine to a 
larger turbine, with the internal components of the larger turbine components 
(inlet guide vane adjustment and removal of the regenerator) mechanically 
adjusted to simulate conditions of the smaller turbine.  When Transwestern 
received permit approval from the AQB to operate at the larger turbine 
capacity, Transwestern made the upgrade adjustments operable.   Apparently, 
EPA has mandated that the AQB act on all issues considered to be outstanding 
as determined by the EPA.  Dave Nutt has been sent the Compliance Order to 
review.  Under the conditions of the Order, Transwestern has 30 days to 
request another hearing.

The annual pollution prevention plans were completed and submitted to the 
State of Arizona.  These plans are requried for the three large quantity 
generators of hazardous waste in Arizona.

Annual hazardous waste fees were paid and submitted to the State of New 
Mexico for four facilities in New Mexico.

A conference call was held with Houston Legal and Environmetnal Affairs to 
discuss the alleged NOV issued for the P-1 C/S which involved a turbine like 
for like replacement activity.  Data has begun to be collected to 
substantiate Transwestern's position concerning the proposed action by the 
State of New Mexico.  A field trip was made to the Air Quality Bureau to copy 
all files relevant to the P-1 C/S and will be delivered to the contract 
attorney who will be assisting Transwestern with this issue. 

Copies of the New Mexico EOTT air permits were received.  Comparisons will be 
made with the nearly completed EOTT tank database spreadsheet to determine 
status of permit compliance with each air permit.

The calendar year 2000 PCB annual document logs were prepared and submitted 
to each generator of PCBs on the Transwestern system.

Training was given to the Midland Region over the correct completion and 
submittal of forms used to report natural gas releases  to the TNRCC.  The 
agency has updated and has become more stringent with respect to Regional 
requirements for the reportable releases which are submitted to them.  An 
incomplete form submittal by a compressor station facility near MIdland led 
to this emergency training being given.  Based upon a phone call with Region 
7 of the TNRCC, the agency stated that they will be issuing NOV's to 
facilities that submit incomplete "Upset/Maintenance NOtification Forms for 
Reportable Events".

Began initial field confirmation of EOTT crude oil tanks and equipment in the 
MIdland Region.  Five of the thirteen teams which have EOTT facilites have 
been inpsected and appropriate changes made to the database and spreadsheet.

A meeting was held with the Midland field teams which have Title V 
facilities, to complete and submit the required annual certifications.  All 
Title V locations in the MIdland region were in compliance for this year.

Region IX EPA has made a determination that prior to issuance of the air 
permits for the Redrock turbine installation, Transwestern is to conduct an 
endangered species survey of C/S's 3 and 4.  A contractor has been contacted 
and the surveys will be completed prior to September 15th.   This is not a 
new issue, as EPA Region VI, Dallas required consideration of the Endangered 
Species Act to be completed at the Luguna C/S, which is on Laguna Indian 
Lands.  The Title V permit will not be issued for the Laguna C/S until the 
EPA is satisified that endangered species are not a concern.  

Preliminary environmental and right of way field data are being provided to 
an environmental contractor to initiate a fatal flaw analysis of a proposed 
project for Transwestern Pipeline Company.

Continued EOTT crude oil release data collections for forthcoming Sept. 27th 
NFL meeting in MIdland.
