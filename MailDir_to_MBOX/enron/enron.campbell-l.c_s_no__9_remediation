The new pumps with skimmers will cost somewhere in the neighborhood of about 
$2500 each. With other associated materials and Clayton's labor we're looking 
at about $10,000 to replace the three pumps. The plan was, and still is, to 
install this type of pump in several wells at the Roswell site when we go to 
full-scale implementation of the remediation system, so all we're doing here 
is accelerating the purchase of three pumps. In regard to the Marshalk pumps, 
I'd rather not use them anywhere else because they are so maintenance 
intensive compared to the newer pumps now available. In the long run I think 
we're better off buying the newer pumps.

George, what are we looking at in terms of $$$$ for the new pumps?   Any 
place else we can use the existing pumps somewhere on the system?

The recovery system continues to produce too much water in spite of using 
product skimmers attached to the pumps. The problem is that product is 
forming an emulsion with water and the emulsion is recovered by the skimmers. 
Unfortunately the emulsion is more water than product. I believe this problem 
can be eliminated by using a different type of pump. The current pump system, 
manufactured by Marshalk, uses air to displace the product from the pump. We 
have been using a bladder pump fitted with a skimmer attachment, manufactured 
by Clean Environment Equipment, at Bell Lake and at Ivanhoe with very good 
success (and no emulsion problems). I have ordered three replacement pumps 
and skimmers (CEE GNE-24) to replace the three Marshalk pumps. I will have 
Clayton shut-down the recovery system until we can install the replacement 
pumps. This should take about 3-4 weeks.

I contacted Jim Saddler with AcuVac regarding rental rates on his SVE 
equipment (S.A.V.E. systems). He indicated that rental on a single unit would 
be $5000 per month and rental on two units would be $4000-$4500 per unit per 
month. I also contacted Baker Furnace regarding rental of comparable SVE 
equipment and they indicated that rental would be $3000 per month. In light 
of this, I suggest we establish a rental rate for the TW units, as is, at 
$2500 per unit per month. 

I also discussed costs associated with refurbishing old units with John Sachs 
at Baker Furnace. John indicated that they have already replaced the old 
Baker Fax telemetry systems with Sensaphone 2000 systems on several used 
units. He also indicated the various options they have for silencing the 
units. It can be done, but apparently, adding silencers to the blower is not 
a simple modification.

We are set up to move the units to Midland next week, but I think we should 
strongly consider shipping the units back to Baker Furnace for these 
modifications. John indicated that they could turn them around in about two 
weeks. Allowing for shipping time, this would place the units back in Midland 
around June 20th (a more realistic date would be June 30th). A rough cost 
estimate is $18000 ($7000 per unit plus $4000 shipping). I believe this would 
save both time and cost compared to trying to do the modifications in 
Midland. We would also end up with "good as new" units. As a compromise 
between EOTT and TW, if EOTT would pick up the costs for the refurbishing 
then TW could lower the rental rate to something on the order of $2000 per 
unit per month.

Bill Olson (OCD) has issued a letter, dated 8/19/99, approving TW's modified 
Groundwater Monitoring Plan and proposed Phase V Soil and Groundwater 
Assessment Plan. The modified monitoring plan will significantly reduce the 
routine groundwater sampling costs; from about $75,000 per year to $20,000 
per year. The Phase V assessment plan is relatively limited in scope. The 
plan includes the installation and sampling of three additional off-site 
wells into the uppermost aquifer. These activities will be on hold pending 
obtaining off-site access; either by means of a property exchange, business 
lease, or water development easement.

I received a call from Bill Olson (NMOCD) this morning regarding remediation 
activities at the Roswell Station. Bill said that Dave Cobrain with the NMED 
HRMB made a visit to the OCD's office yesterday to get an update on 
activities at the site. Bill said that he provided Mr. Cobrain with copies of 
assessment reports for the site. The last report submitted to the OCD was the 
"Phase IV Assessment Report, Ground Water Monitoring Report, & Phase V Ground 
Water Assessment Work Plan" dated June 30, 1999. The Phase V work plan was 
subsequently approved by the OCD in a letter dated August 19, 1999. The 
assessment activities had been on hold pending a resolution of off-site 
access issues. More recently, we obtained an amendment to the existing water 
development easement so that we could complete the Phase V assessment 
activities. This work is scheduled to be complete within the next 4-6 weeks. 
In a letter to the OCD dated August 29, 2000, we indicated that a report of 
ongoing groundwater monitoring activities and a Phase V assessment report 
would be submitted to the OCD office by December 31, 2000. This was the last 
written correspondence between the OCD and TW.

Bill also indicated that he has worked with Dave Cobrain before. Bill had 
several positive and encouraging comments about Dave and about his discussion 
with Dave, including comments from Dave to the effect that media should not 
be assumed to contain listed wastes and that TW should proceed with 
remediation with oversight by the OCD. Bill said that he informed Dave of 
certain outstanding issues that have impeded progress with remediation at 
this site. Bill also indicated to me that he was encouraged by Dave's 
involvement and with other individuals now on staff at the NMED HRMB.

Bill-
Two files are attached. The first file is the text and figures of a plan for 
characterizing impacted soil in the former surface impoundment areas. The 
second file contains the attachments to the characterization plan. The 
attachments include copies of soil boring logs and a summary of some previous 
soil sample results. I will also send two hard copies of the plan to you via 
FedEx. Transwestern is ready to proceed upon approval from the NMOCD and the 
NMED HRMB. Please call me if you have any questions or comments.
Thanks,
George

The product recovery system was shut down on September 8th due to excessive 
production of water. This system was shut down pending the installation new 
recovery pumps which would minimize production of water. The new pumps have 
been purchased and are on-site, however, in the time period since September 
8th, PSH has accumulated in only one of the three on-site recovery wells. In 
light of this, installation of the new recovery pumps will be postponed until 
additional recovery wells have been installed.

Soil sampling for waste characterization was completed on September 6th. Bill 
Olson with the NMOCD was on-site to observe the sampling activities. 
Twenty-two soil samples were collected from the two former pit areas. Lab 
results indicate that the impacted soil samples do not trigger RCRA hazardous 
waste criteria, more specifically:
? for all 22 samples, all TCLP VOC constituents were non-detect
? for all 22 samples, all TCLP SVOC constituents were non-detect
? for all 22 samples, all TCLP Metal constituents were non-detect with only 
two exceptions. Arsenic was detected in the TCLP extract for two samples; one 
at 1.41 mg/L and another at 2.18 mg/L, both below the RCRA regulatory limit 
of 5.0 mg/L.
? for all 22 samples, the samples were determined to be "not-ignitable"
? for all 22 samples, reactive cyanide and reactive sulfide were non-detect 
with only one exception. Reactive sulfide was detected for one sample at 160 
mg/kg; this is below the guidance level of 500 mg/kg.
? the measured pH for all samples was in the range of 6.9 - 9.1; this is 
within the RCRA regulatory limits of 2.0 - 12.5.

Furthermore, the measured TPH for all samples was in the range of 131 - 9660 
mg/kg with an average TPH concentration of 2429 mg/kg.

Selected photos of the sampling effort are attached. There was a considerable 
amount of waste debris found in the pits, particulary at the east end of the 
larger pit area.

I will be finalizing the excavation plan for the former pit areas over the 
next week or so. I will prepare cost estimates for two alternative excavation 
plans; one for a dig and haul option and one for a combination of dig and 
haul for the most heavily affected soil and on-site blending for less 
affected soil. We should try to have a work plan to the NMOCD by the week of 
October 1st.

We have received written approval from both the OCD and the NMED for the soil 
characterization plan that was submitted for sampling soil in the former 
surface impoundment area located at the northeast corner of the facility. A 
work plan for excavation and disposal of affected soil will be prepared 
subsequent to completion of the soil characterization plan. A tentative 
schedule is as follows:
? Meet with the Team and the contractor (Gandy) at the site on August 29th
? Collect soil samples for characterization on September 5th and 6th. Bill 
Olson with the OCD has indicated that he would like to be present for these 
activities.
? Receive lab results by September 21st
? Submit excavation work plan by October 5th

Whether or not we can complete the excavation work this year will be largely 
dependent upon obtaining a quick approval of an excavation work plan. The 
timing will be tight but it can be done.
