All,

In my haste to begin the four day weekend last week, I failed to send the 
status update I promised in my earlier note.  Below is a slightly tardy but 
nonetheless riveting Exchange Linking Status Update.

1.  Exchange Linking Software Development - Functional development was 
completed on schedule and we are currently performing testing of the Beta 
release.  Initial testing has gone very well.  
     A final release is scheduled for January 15th.  I will be working with 
Victoria Storey from the Operations group in turning over external testing of 
the system.  A deployment plan has been submitted to
     Operations to assist them with the rollout.

2.  Exchange Linking GUI - Development is complete and testing is being 
conducted.

3.  Product Mapping -  Product Control Group continues their effort of 
coordinating with TrueQuote the products covered under Schedule A of the 
contract.  Points of contact have been arranged 
      between Enron (Rob Cass) and TrueQuote (Richard Toubia) to continue the 
coordination effort required to support ongoing product mapping.

4.  Hardware - All network and server hardware has been received and 
installed.  

5.  Leased Lines - Anchi Z. has been coordinating with each exchange's 
network POC and assisting in obtaining T-1 lines to support this project.  In 
the absence of T-1 lines, both TrueQuote and Houston
     Street will be using VPN connectivity to conduct testing.  We should be 
up and running with TrueQuote by 28 December so that testing can begin.  
Houston Street does not anticipate being ready to 
     test anything until the end of February. 

6.  Bridging - Downstream system bridging modifications have been made to 
accommodate the addition of an external exchange id and an external exchange 
deal number.

7.  TrueQuote has stated that they will not make the contract date with 
regard to some of the functionality of their system.  They hope to be able to 
fully act as a client exchange but are not prepared to
      take on the role of an external exchange (i.e. handle transaction 
attempts from Enron.)

8.  Houston Street is back in the picture.  Their stated contract date is 
December 4th + 120 calendar days.  This gives them some breathing room.  They 
have canned Sapient, built their own internal 
      IT team, purchased messaging software from Web Methods and changed 
hosting providers.  They will no longer use Genuity out of Boston but Data 
Return out of Dallas for their hosting needs.

Please advise if you have any questions or comments.

-David

Andy,

When we met a few weeks back you offered to put me in touch with someone
from your VC group to discuss potential investors in HoustonStreet.  This
round of financing seems to be firming up at a very attractive price for new
investors and I wanted to take you up on your offer.  I'd love to talk with
someone in your VC group about who they see in the market that is actually
taking positions at this time.  We may have room to fill in this round with
some new investors.  Someone's going to make a lot of money on
HoustonStreet.

I received a briefing Friday on our development efforts and things seem to
be on track.  We have brought in some unbelievable developers that are very
focused and enjoying this project immensely.  Please let me know if any
issues come up with development efforts from your end and I'll do the same.

Best regards,
Frank

Amerex is done at $250 K

Bob, here you go.? Lets work up a more formal  term sheet and go from there.
?
In short, for  us to accept a licensing fee and no commission when our 
brokers hit/lift
over  the phones an EOL number with Enron traders, we're looking to receive
from  Enron:
??? - Access to EOL numbers in worldwide natural gas,  power, bandwidth, and
oil petroleum markets.? We feel strongly that  Amerex has built leadership or
solid intermediary positions in all these  markets, and that should greatly
benefit Enron and EOL, as well as benefit  Amx.
??? - Until Amx notifies EOL, we interact with EOL on a  view and phone call
basis, essentially in keeping with doing business with  Enron traders just
like we do now, accept we see the bid/ask on line as well  as in voice.? But
with notice from Amx, EOL will program the Amx  interaction to allow Amx
brokers to hit/lift on a keyboard  function
??? - That Amx pays the license fee of $250k for the  first year, on a
monthly basis.
??? - At the end of the one  year period, there will be no greater increase
in the license fee than 10%,  and the license fee can be reduced, subject to
both parties'  agreement.
??? - We are keeping this confidential, and would  request that EOL and Enron
does not even indicate that a broker or a Houston  broker, or some other
indirect reference of a deal with a brokerage or Amx is  made to the market.

Look forward to hearing from you.
All the best
Steve

My apologies-- I have to admit that I dropped the ball on this one. WIth the
market going crazy, yearend and some stuff going on in London, I havent
totally formulated the response to you.  I will get a response to you early
next week.  Obviously, we have had alot of discussions internally with many
issues/questions.  However, I understand that you need an answer soon so we
will revert quickly.
Happy New Year.

Would you like me to schedule a meeting to discuss real time data feeds to 
customers? If so who should attend?

I also would like to follow up with True Quote and Houston Street from a 
business perspective on the exchanges.  Is it ok for me to contact them to 
get a feel on progress on their side.  If so who are the commercial contacts 
at True Quotes and Houston Street?

Andy,

When you have some time, can we get together on the circumstances under which 
we should charge a business unit for the addition of a new Product Type?

I'm thinking specifically of the units which do receive a cost allocation, 
but are adding products which in our opinion are of questionable economic 
benefit.

These could be charged in accordance with our current price schedule. i.e. 
new Product Types added to existing businesses could be charged the 
incremental setup fees.  New Businesses would be the 250K.

If the Product Type is of clear benefit (e.g. Options for US Gas and for the 
guys we are training this week), then the costs would be part of next year's 
allocation.

What do you think?

Dave

Andy,

Below are a number of the e-mail's that I've exchanged with TrueQuote.  I 
can't say that they make for interesting reading but if you note any 
potential issues please let me know.  Most of the notes relate to product 
mapping issues but you will notice highlighted in red a note regarding the 
ordering of a leased line which in my mind is "acceptance of responsibility 
by action."  I'll be crafting a note regarding testing soon and will 
coordinate this with Jay and yourself.  I'll also be forwarding e-mails with 
Houston Street.  Let me know if there is anything else I can do to further 
clarify our status.

Hi David,

Thanks for sending the answers to our technical questions. After carefully
reviewing your answers, we have a few follow-up questions.  These appear in
"green".  Please let me know if anything needs further clarification.

We are looking forward to meeting with you next week. Tentatively, we are
planning to have 5 or 6 people attend.  These include three really technical
people, a couple of leads (including myself), a user from the True Quote
business side who understands the products that are traded on True Quote,
and the new True Quote CIO (who's mainly interested in hearing what is said
more so than actively participating in the discussion).

By next Tuesday, I plan to send you our proposed agenda for the meeting.  If
you have a different agenda in mind for the meeting, let's discuss it over
the phone on Wednesday and jointly priortize the items for discussion. We
are very flexible in terms of the agenda.

Thanks in advance for any additional information you can send us.  It's nice
to have a contact to be able to correspond with.  Have a great day!

Maria,

It was good to hear from you this morning.  I have attached your document
with answers to your questions included.  In addition, I've provided the
finalized DTD and our schedule of release dates for specific functionality.

I raised your desire to meet to discuss the project and everyone agrees
that getting together is a good idea.  That said, we believe it would be
best to wait until we have a firm agenda to discuss.  For instance, we will
need to get together in the near term to discuss data mapping issues.  Feel
free to call or drop a note if you have any questions or concerns.

Regards,

David

The following are the dates that we will release functionality.

1 December 2000:  Login, Attempt Transaction, Post Price, Request Price and
Request Order Status.
15 December 2000: Request Transaction History, Request Credit Matrix, Post
Product Set Data and Post Credit Matrix.

David,

I really appreciate your efforts in adding another hour to our meeting this
afternoon and in making Jay available for the discussion.  The following is
a list of technical questions that we would like to discuss in this
afternoon's meeting:

1) This one is probably going to be discussed in the first two hours - We
will need to have the data to populate our tables with in order to map PID,
CPID, RID, PSETID, CATGID, CTYID, CMDTYID.  The non-technical people know
all of the information about the products, deal types, etc.  However, do
they know that for example, PID "123" maps back to Product "ABC"?  I would
think the technical people are the ones that know how this codes map back to
specific product information on your system.

2) Could you provide us a little background on why Credit term changed from
"Required" to "Implied" during the last version of the DTD that we received
from you?

3) We sent this question a few days ago, but have not received a response:
There are several different parameter names specified for the XML that is
passed between systems.
The following is a list of those specified in the External Interface
Document:

Post Prices:  prices (Page 12, Notes, Decision 1, Parameters)
Request Prices:  prices (Page 14, Notes, Decision 1, Parameters)
Attempt Transaction: txn (Page 16, Notes, Decision 1, Parameters)
Post Product Set Data: xml (Page 26, Notes, Decision 1, Parameters)
Post Credit Matrix: xml (Page 28, Notes, Decision 1, Parameters)

Should all of the parameter names be "xml" or should the parameter names for
Post Product Set Data and Post Credit Matrix be changed to reflect the
naming convention of the other use cases?

Using "xml" as the parameter name for all use cases will reduce the
redundancy of the code we'll need to write to route the data to our internal
interfaces.

4) We still have some concerns over having to maintain Enron's calendar on
our system since term is sent as part of the key.  We would like to discuss
alternatives for dealing with date interpretation.

5) We had asked a question earlier regarding business responses being sent
back within the same HTTP session.   We are going to assume that
confirmation comes back in the HTTP response since there has been no
interface defined for business responses.  We would like to confirm this
assumption in this meeting.

6) Is there going to be some capability of cancelling a transaction attempt
if for some reason we do not receive a response back from Enron on a
transaction attempt and a subsequent transaction search?

7) Would Enron consider posting all of their requests to a .asp file as
opposed to a file with no extension (ext_nrt.asp instead of ext_nrt)?  It is
a generally accepted practice to include file extensions when transporting
files.

Thanks again for everything David.  We will look forward to talking to you
later today!

Regards,
Maria

Maria,

I understand your concern and while I want to ensure we address product
mapping as the primary focus of the meetings, I asked if Jay Webb and/or
Mike Guadarrama could spend some time discussing your technical questions.
Jay and/or Mike will be available from 3-4 today to do just this.  I know
you've asked some technical questions already and are also interested in
credit mapping nevertheless, would you please provide a brief rundown of
the technical issues you want to discuss so that Jay/Mike can be prepared
in advance to make the best use of the hour?  Thanks.

The meetings will be attended by our Product Control Group who are
responsible for creating and maintaining all of Enron's product types and
products.  They are the experts when it comes knowing all the various ways
Enron represents and implements products on EnronOnline.  Other than
myself, the four attendees will be Sheri Thomas, who heads the Product
Control group, Jennifer deBoisblanc-Denny, who heads the products area of
the group and two experts in gas and power products.

Look forward to hearing from you soon so I can inform Jay and Mike.

Regards
-David

There will be people there that understand the products in non-technical
detail.

When were you thinking we could involve your "technical" people?  I agree
with the agenda and strongly agree that we need to understand each other
products before we can attempt an integration.  However, my team's
reponsibility is to figure out how to "technically" send/receive and map
information from your system.  If this is not going to be addressed the
first day, than perhaps some of them don't need to come.  I guess I'm now
concerned that the second two hour meeting isn't going to be long enough to
provide my team the information they need proceed with their technical
implementation.  I understand that the documents you've sent me should
address most of our questions, but each revision has left my team with more
questions and confusion about how this is all going to work.

Will Jay Webb be in either meeting?  Could you send us a list of the
attendees on your side and their roles/functions as well.   We want very
much to make these meetings as productive as possible, understanding that
your team as well as mine are very very busy.

I appreciate your help,

Maria

Thanks for the finalized list.  I assume that one or more of the people
below will be able to speak in detail about gas and power products outside
of the technical domain?  The people from Enron that will attend the
meeting are non-technical.  Their area of expertise lies in the arena of
products and their management.  I just want to make sure that we have
people that will be speaking the same language.

Attached is the agenda for the meetings.

Oh, I see, my misunderstanding.  We are in 3 Greenway Plaza.  Two 2-hour
meetings is fine with us. No problem in us driving downtown.  However,
could
we schedule from 1:00 p.m. to 3:00 on the 8th, and from 10:00 to 12:00 on
the 9th?  I have a conflict on the 8th.

The agenda looks fine.  If there are any additional XML-type questions left
to answer by the time we have the meeting, we may want to allow some time
to
discuss them.

Thanks again David, looking forward to meeting in person.

Maria,

Actually, I was suggesting 2 hours on both the 8th and the 9th of November
for getting together to discuss mapping issues.  If November 8th and 9th
isn't good for you, we can try November 9th and 10th.  I would say let's
just get together for one, four hour meeting but it is difficult to get the
Product Control people together for that length of time since they are
integral to the day to day operations of EnronOnline.  (I am assuming you
are in downtown Houston.  If getting here is difficult then we can try to
arrange a one day meeting.) Any thoughts on the suggested dates/times?

As far as the number of meetings required, from our point of view we just
need to accomplish product and counterparty mappings.  The agenda below
addresses products and a follow-up would address counterparties.  Beyond
that, the External Interface Document and DTD should address all the
technical issues that enable you to design and construct your part of the
system.  I'll send you the most recent External Interface Document and DTD
shortly.

Please let me know you thoughts on the proposed agenda.  I'm sure we can
work out an agreeable schedule.

Regards,
David

Agenda
11/8/2000 10:00-12:00  Clarification of product representation and product
creation
process.

It is important to understand each other's methods for representing
products and the process by which we create new products prior to jumping
in to the mapping problem.

11/9/2000 10:00-12:00  Map schedule A products.

It is important to not only know which products of ours map to yours but
what process can be applied to make mapping easily repeatable.

Sorry for not getting back to you sooner.  I was out of the office

Richard/Maria,

Attached please find the 'treatments' for the various Tokenized reference
periods currently in use for US Nat Gas and US Power.  I believe you will
find these spreadsheets easier to translate than the previous.  Let me know
what you think.  As you've pointed out it is critical that we are both on
the same page when it comes to our treatments of these reference periods;
however, I do believe this is an issue that we can work through together.
I would suggest that we get together again for another couple hours once
you've had the chance to review not only the info I've provided to date but
also the list of Schedule A products that I plan to provide on Wednesday.
As always, feel free to drop me a note or give me a call anytime.

Regards,
David

P.S.  Please keep in mind that the present structure of the TRP's do not
contemplate weekends that breach a calendar month, and holidays.  For
example, a US Nat Gas Day Ahead product (Number XXXX)  being offered after
11:00 a.m. on a Thursday the 27th will provide a TRP Product for Saturday
the 29th, Sunday the 30th, and Monday the 1st. Since our trading areas
would not want to breach the current calendar month, they would create two
date-specific products; Number YYYY for Saturday the 29th through Sunday
the 30th, and Product Number ZZZZ for Monday the 1st.

Power TRP Treatment.xls)(See attached file: West Power TRP Treatment.xls)

A question has come up that may have serious implications for our system.
Please forward to the right person, we would really appreciate it if we
could have a response as soon as possible.

The question is "How many transaction attempts can be sent by Enron to True
Quote at one time(will Enron be sending more than transaction in a batch)?"
Your documentation seems to read that you may be sending more than one
transaction at a time.  If that is true, then we may have a problem if you
plan to send transaction searches that would force us to cancel all of the
previous transaction attempts that were sent over together, since our system
processes items in sequential order.

Please call me if the question seems confusing.

Subject: FW: Fill or Kill - Buy or Sell from Enron Traders


Good morning David,

Here's another clarifying question.  I have in my notes documentation that
says that Enron will do partial fills of transactions sent to EOL. The
question that being asked in the attached note has to do with transactions
sent by EOL to TrueQuote.  Does Enron want (or will Enron accept) partial
fills by the True Quote system? If so, how should we identify (if at all)
that this was a partial fill?

Thanks David.

Subject: Fill or Kill - Buy or Sell from Enron Traders


Maria,

Matt raised a question regarding transaction attempts made by Enron Traders
directly against the True Quote system (not going through EOL).  This is a
two scenario question:

1)  If an Enron trader is initiating a buy in the True Quote system against
a counterparty's position to sell at a specified price and volume (ie:
15,000 @ 2.40 - which is currently a valid market in True Quote), at the
point the transaction is being executed in the system, the volume drops to
10,000, would our Enron want to fill whatever quantity they can at the given
price.  Currently we are interpreting all transactions made directly from
Enron into the True Quote system will be entered as a Fill or Kill.
Will Enron allow partial fills of transaction attempts?
Also, should the successful transaction attempt consist of several parties,
will Enron accept this (3 parties of 5,000 each)?
Do we send back a response identifying a FILL for the partial volume and
FAIL for the remaining volume?

2)  Reverse the statement for an attempt of Enron to Sell a volume against a
counterparty's position to buy.  Is Enron willing to sell partial volumes
should the market not be there to fill Enron's order completely?

I am forwarding you minutes taken from the conference call with Enron of
Sept 26th.  This was before you joined the project, but as you can see, we
were told that partial fills would be possible.  The answers appear in blue.

Chris,

Wayne and I have reviewed this transcript from the conversation with Enron.
During that conversation, several items were to be worked offline.  These
are detailed and are listed as "To be worked offline" in Exhibit B, C, D,
and E.

Would you like to have EnFORM participate in your discussion with Enron, or
do you feel that these items are strategically sensitive enough that you
should have this conversation without EnFORM's involvement?

These "To be worked offline" issues are very important, but we do have
additional technical questions that would best be addressed by a technical
Enron contact.  If we could begin the process of a establishing a technical
"relationship" with an individual at Enron as soon as possible, it would
speed development and lower costs of this project.

P.S.  Wayne was next to me as I typed this note.

Maria

The following questions were discussed in the telephone conference call with
Enron on September 26th.  We have inserted Enron's answers in Blue and have
highlighted follow-ups and offline discussions in Red.


Questions for Enron to answer regarding True Quote's interface:

High Priority Questions (need to be addressed):
(From Exhibit A) Will the product ID that Enron is transmitting specifically
identify a product offering including commodity, deal type, region /
location, and tradable term (fully qualified begin and end dates)?

Product ID is a fully transactable item - Product, Location, Dates
Product ID is a fully qualified instrument - excluding price, volume and
counterparty
Product ID can be for next day and balance of month.  However, on next to
last day of month, the Product ID will offer either next day or BOM, not
both (there is no reason for redundancy)
Product ID that is for anything, except for the rolling Tokenized
products/dates (example: For a spot month, the Product ID will expire on the
first day of that spot month)
Currency and Unit of measure is implied as part of Product ID, but it is not
an attribute


(From Exhibit B) Can we confirm a transaction attempt against Enron for an
Enron product id is a "Fill or Kill" transaction, meaning, a transaction
attempt submitted to Enron would not stay in their system if it was not
immediately filled.  If the deal is not confirmed by Enron, the order will
be immediately removed from Enron's system and could not be filled later if
market conditions made the order viable.

A transaction attempt by TrueQuote will be "Fill or Kill" (It will not in
stay in EOL's system)

If the deal is not confirmed by Enron due to non-availability of volume,
these volumes need to be expired in the True Quote system

If a transaction attempt fails for ANY reason, Enron will immediately
rebroadcast that Product to the True Quote system

Does True Quote need to design functionality for partial fill of a deal
transaction for an outside entity?

Enron will do partial fills.  The True Quote system needs to design
functionality to accept partial fills from an outside entity.

What is the time threshold for waiting on an Enron response to a transaction
attempt?

Enron will accept whatever True Quote determines is an acceptable threshold
for waiting.

What is the estimated delivery date for Enron's DTDs?

The EnronOnline Exchanges External Interface Document was received on
Monday, October 2, 2000.

Exhibit A (Enron Price Interface-what Enron sends to TQ):

Concerning the Enron price interface, Enron has stated that EOL currently
handles prices/volume updates at the rate of 100 updates per second, growing
potentially to 500 per second (across all EOL product offerings).  Given
this level of update activity, how will the transmission of these updates be
accomplished?  Below are some questions which should clarify these concerns:

What is the expected rate of updates for the sub-set of EOL products that
will be transmitted to the True Quote platform?  Is it expected that these
products will also endure update activity at the rate of 100-500 updates per
second?

Although it was not communicated how often an XML document will be sent, it
was clarified that the XML documents will be sent at certain time
intervals.Each update will contain all information since last time polled
(includes all changes (only changes) since last transmission)
Need to clarify if True Quote will be polling EOL for Updates, or if EOL
will send them automatically at certain time intervals.

Will there be one XML document interface transmission for each Enron product
update, or will one XML document interface contain updates for multiple
Enron products?  The implications of this are as follows:  Will True Quote
need to handle 100-500 XML documents per second, or will True Quote receive
one XML document at a determined interval that has updates for all Enron
products?  If the XML document contains updates for all Enron products, how
often will Enron send us the document?   If it's one XML document per Enron
product, will True Quote be expected to handle 100-500 XML document
submissions per second?

The XML document will contain updates for multiple Product IDs.  If only one
Product ID has changed in EOL since the last transmission, then only one
Product ID will be sent to True Quote in the updates.

Can we confirm that Enron will only submit one price/volume offering per
Enron product id; meaning, Enron will never have multiple price and quantity
offerings for the same Enron product ID on the True Quote platform.

Enron will never send Market Depth for any Product ID.  What you see on EOL
is exactly what is transmitted to True Quote (one offering per Enron Product
ID).  However, each Product ID update will contain both the Bid and the
Offer.

The interface currently does not have a field to define the duration of the
order.  Given this, can we assume that when the price interface submits a
product price/volume update to the True Quote platform, the order will be
loaded with a duration of "Good Until Canceled".  True Quote will mark the
order as 'GTC' until Enron submits a new XML document for that Enron product
that changes the status to "Suspended".  In this case True Quote would
cancel the order on the True Quote system.

All orders will remain on the True Quote system until the EOL traders pull
the deals.  At this time, EOL would send "Suspended Status" for the Product
ID.

How are terms related to Enron Product IDs?  Example:  For a given Enron
commodity, deal type, and location that is traded in October, would a new
product id be created for that same product offering when the month rolls to
November?
 Yes

If product ids do not include a direct relationship to a specific tradable
term, when a Price Interface XML document is submitted to the True Quote
platform, how will True Quote know which trade term the product id is
associated with?
Product IDs do have a direct relationship to a specific tradable term

We are currently assuming that an Enron product id specifically identifies a
product offering including commodity, deal type, region/location, and
tradable term.
This assumption is correct

Can we confirm that all Enron orders transmitted to the True Quote platform
will be cancelled at the end of the day and that all products will be
re-loaded into the True Quote system the following morning?  If not,  will
the assumed 'Good Until Canceled' duration for each product id remain active
until the status has been changed to "Suspended"?

All EOL orders should be removed by the traders at the end of the day.  For
those that are not removed, True Quote should run a nightly batch job that
removes all EOL orders left in the system.  Each morning, True Quote will
authenticate with EOL, and at this time, all orders on EOL will be
transmitted to True Quote.

Exhibit B (Transaction Interface with Enron):

For each field (across all interfaces), we will need clearly defined data
types (precision, range of length, space/bytes it takes).

This information still needs to be provided.

Can we assume the Bid/Ask flag is an integer? Perhaps a bit?  If it's a
character, what is the character indicator?  B/A?

This information still needs to be provided.

Can we confirm the data type for volume is integer?

This information still needs to be provided.

Across all interfaces, there is not a defined unit of measure for price and
volume by Enron product id.   Should part of the XML DTD specify the unit of
measure for both price and volume, or are we to assume that Enron product
ids for Power are in US dollars and megawatt/hr, and Enron product ids for
natural gas are US dollars and MMBTU?

Currency and Unit of measure is implied as part of Product ID, but it is not
an attribute

Price - how many decimal places? (precision of the number)

This information still needs to be provided.

Volume and Price - Does Enron have an min / max / default increment value
established for price and volume increment ranges by Enron product id?  (For
example, within True Quote the default volume increment for natural gas is
5000, and the price increment is $0.0025.  Both the price and volume
increments, min/max ranges can vary by region or location).

On EOL, the traders determine the minimal tradable increments and the
minimal tradable amounts (this minimums could be as low as 1).

To be worked Offline:
How to handle increments <> 5000 increment on the Enron side (will we only
display the 5000 increment below the volume submitted by Enron, if trader
has a minimum greater than entities are willing to participate, how do we
display this and how does the minimum increment come across in the order)


Can we confirm a transaction attempt against Enron for an Enron product id
is a "Fill or Kill" transaction, meaning, a transaction attempt submitted to
Enron would not stay in their system if it was not immediately filled.  If
the deal is not confirmed by Enron, the order will be immediately removed
from Enron's system and could not be filled later if market conditions made
the order viable.  If the deal is not confirmed by Enron due to
non-availability of volume, these volumes need to be expired in the True
Quote system.

Already answered above.

Will Enron allow partial fill of transactions?   For example, if the Enron
price interface submits an offer with 20,000 mmbtu available, can True Quote
submit a transaction bid attempt to take only 10,000 mmbtu of the Enron
offer?   If not, is it a valid assumption that we can only submit a
transaction attempt to lift the entire Enron offer of 20,000 mmbtu?

Enron will allow partial fills.

Exhibit C (True Quote Price Interface-what TQ sends to Enron):
Does Enron expect True Quote to submit a single price point offering for an
Enron product id that is the aggregate total volume of all orders available
for that product id on the True Quote platform at the best available price?
This would allow Enron to submit a transaction attempt against the True
Quote platform, submitting a volume request that would potentially sweep
multiple counter parties creating deals with all entities necessary to
satisfy transaction attempt.
Alternative 2:  Does Enron expect True Quote to submit only the best
individual order (the best price and volume for an Enron product id from
only one counterparty) identified by its True Quote order id (True Quote
would not transmit the counter party id; however, before sending the XML
interface to Enron, the counterparty would have to pass the credit rules
maintained in the counterparty credit matrix on the True Quote platform).
Alternative 3:  Would Enron expect True Quote to submit multiple price
offerings per Enron product id (a market depth of various price and volume
offerings).  In this scenario, the volume associated with each price point
should be an aggregate of multiple True Quote orders (as shown in the True
Quote market screen).  The XML interface could potentially transmit
individual True Quote orders and their associated volumes (not an aggregate
volume of multiple orders); however, giving Enron the ability to 'pick and
choose' individual orders could potentially violate True Quote customer
service agreements that require deals to be executed in the chronological
sequence that the order request was received by the True Quote platform.

Enron wants to see the granularity of each True Quote Product ID order.
Enron expects True Quote to submit multiple price offerings per Enron
Product ID.  (Example:  If  True Quote has an order in the system for
100,000 MMbtu's at $3.00, which is comprised of 10 individual orders of
10,000, Enron wants True Quote to send all of the individual orders).

To be worked Offline:
Fair and equitable treatment with prices sent to Enron (proper processing of
orders without bias)
Need to discuss in more detail how to handle EOL price interface
transactions and Enron Trader transactions
Need to clarify with Enron whether they want to receive the best price in
the market for a given Product ID, or if they want to see all of a given
Product ID's market depth.

Our concern is that if True Quote transmits individual True Quote orders and
their associated volumes (not an aggregate volume of multiple orders),
giving Enron the ability to 'pick and choose' individual orders, this could
potentially violate True Quote customer service agreements that require
deals to be executed in the chronological sequence that the order request
was received by the True Quote platform.


Exhibit D (Sponsor Transaction Interface):
Are we correct in assuming that transactions posted by Enron traders against
True Quote deals will be executed on the True Quote system?  Will the
duration of the order attempts being sent to True Quote be "Fill or Kill" or
some other duration?

To be worked Offline:
The traders will want to transact against True Quote directly without
adjusting the market position through EOL, but how this is accomplished will
be to be discussed.

Exhibit E (Counterparty Interface):
In general, we need more details about what Enron will be sending as part of
their daily counterparty credit / term interface, as well as the intra-day
counterparty credit/term interface:
Currently, exhibit E does not specific any fields or data types within an
XML DTD.
What are the "terms" under which participants can trade with Enron?  For
example, will the level of restriction include volumetric limits, financial
limits, tradable date range limits (number days or months into the future)
by Enron product id (assuming a product id specifically defines a commodity,
deal-type, region/location, and tradable term).  Will Enron send us a 'yes /
no' flag to turn off/on a counterparty's ability to trade with Enron by the
Enron product id?

To be worked Offline:
Credit terms and counterparty interface details were not addressed in the
teleconference.  The details of granularity will need to addressed to better
understand the responsibilities that True Quote will have in handling
Enron's credit structure.


Questions for True Quote to Answer:

Exhibit D:  Does the Sponsor Transaction interface (Enron proposing
transactions on the True Quote platform) still invoke the Enron Transaction
Interface?  There was some discussion that if internal Enron traders
proposed transactions against the True Quote platform, the point of
transaction would be the True Quote platform, and True Quote would not have
to invoke the transaction on the EOL platform.  True Quote would simply
confirm whether the Enron transaction attempt succeeded or failed.  If it
succeeded, True Quote would send a confirmation XML interface to confirm the
deal had been executed and transmit the True Quote Deal ID to Enron.
What is the time threshold for waiting on Enron's response to a transaction
attempt?  For example, after 'n' seconds the True Quote platform should
alert a system operator that an Enron transaction attempt has failed to
return either a confirmation or failure.

Please respond to the questions above.

Thank you.

* Product ID
* Product ID is a fully transactable item  and fully qualified instrument -
Includes: Product, Location, Dates; Excludes: Price, Volume and Couterparty
* Tokenized Dates:  Product ID for next day and balance of month are
tokenized dates which means that the product ID will remain the same for
designated date range (next day, next 2 days, BOM, etc).  The dates will
role, but the product ID will remain the same
* Product IDs for anything but the rolling Tokenized products/dates (i.e. -
spot month), expire after date has been reached.
* There will be no redundancy of product IDs that encompass the same date
ranges (i.e.:  there are usually two separate product IDs for next day and
balance of month, but when the next to the last day of the month is reached,
both will reference the same day.  At this point, Enron will only have one
product ID associated with the given date range)
* Enron has set up product IDs to adequately reflect Weekend trading on
Friday (deals entered for Saturday will encompass Sat - Mon (and include
extra days when Holidays are involved))
* Once a strip term has been reached, trades within the month then change to
the tokenized product IDs.
* Enron will Fill or Kill all transaction attempts - they will execute or
cancel the trade immediately
* Enron will Partial fills transaction attempts
* When True Quote sends a request for a transaction, the threshold for
waiting on a response from Enron will be defined by True Quote.
* Trade failure will re-broadcast product (failure for any reason)
* If for any reason there is a concern about a product, True Quote can
request (HTTP) validation of the product in question
* Frequency of updates:  Enron will send True Quote a document that contains
all information since last time polled (includes all changes (only changes)
since last transmission)
* Every product sent will have only one bid and offer price associated with
it at time of transmission.  What you see on EOL is what is sent to True
Quote.
* There will be no market depth transmitted to True Quote from Enron
* Duration of orders
* Orders will be displayed on True Quote until suspended by traders
* All orders will remain on system until traders pull deals
* True Quote session is finite (7 -7).  At the end of every day all deals
will be removed from True Quote (either by Enron traders removing them, or
TRUE QUOTE will run a batch job to clear Enron deals).  In the morning, TRUE
QUOTE will authenticate and all products will be loaded from Enron to TRUE
QUOTE.
* The Currency and Unit of measure are implied as part of Product ID, it's
not an attribute.
* Granularity of orders transmitted from True Quote to Enron will show each
order associated with each price and volume of a Product ID (i.e. 100,000
mmbtu @ $5 is made up of 10 separate orders of 10,000, Enron would like to
see all 10 orders of 10,000 - including counterparty information)
* Transaction attempts made from True Quote to EOL - Point of execution will
be on EOL
* Transaction attempts made by Enron Traders against True Quote price
postings will be executed on True Quote

Offline:
* Will we know if a transaction has failed due to volume not available,
credit failure, or Enron has not heard of the transaction
* How to handle increments <> 5000 increment on the Enron side (will we only
display the 5000 increment below the volume submitted by Enron; if trader
has a minimum tradable volume greater than entities are willing to
participate (i.e. Enron minimum tradable amount is 10,000 or 15,000) how do
we display this and how does the minimum increment come across in the order)
* If we transmit to Enron the granularity of all orders (including
counterparty information), how will True Quote / Enron ensure the fair and
equitable treatment with prices sent to Enron (proper processing of orders
without bias)
* Business question: how much do we want to send Enron (they are ok with
sending each order for all price points in an instrument), do we show top 1
or top 5?
* Need to discuss in more detail how to handle EOL price interface
transactions and Enron Trader transactions

Subject: RE: One other item about Enron...


Maria,

Please confirm with David that NO partial fills refers *only* to transaction
attempts.  We fully expect that Enron will send us (potentially) large
volumes via. the price posting interface; then, we may execute multiple
transaction attempts for that EOL product ID to Enron via. the transaction
attempt interface.  These individual transaction attempts could be much
smaller (in volume) than the volume posted via. the price posting interface.

Basically, the way we understand it is... the individual transaction
attempts will be 'all or nothing'; however, we can break the large price
post down and transmit multiple (smaller) transaction attempts against that
large price post volume.

I believe we are all in agreement on this, but it never hurts to be
absolutely sure concerning something of this magnitude and importance.

Thanks,

-Stewart

I've spoken the David Fisher at Enron this morning.  The conference call
will Andy Zipper and Jay Webb cannot be arranged until next Thursday (Dec.
14). David will send details later.

David has asked us to assume that there will be NO partial fills on either
side. He believes that even if they agree to do this it will likely be a
"day 2" enhancement and not a functionality that is part of the January 5th
deliverables. He is also requesting that we focus on completing the
functionality that will allow Enron to post prices on True Quote and will
allow True Quote to execute transactions on EOL.  In addition, another
priority needs to be to have the credit functionality completed.  These are
going to be the requirements that need to be tested by December 18th and
need to be in production by January 5th.

True Quote's ability to send prices to Enron and accept transaction attempts
from EOL is secondary at this point and not likely to be a requirement that
needs to be met by January 5th.

Please let me know if there is any reason why the execution engine will not
be ready to accept price posts from EOL and send transaction requests
(assuming only full orders will be filled) by December 18th.  If there is
any concern about getting credit functioning within that timeframe, please
let me know this as soon as possible, as well.  Thanks for all of your help.
You all are key contributors to this project and without your awesome
knowledge and skills, we would never be able to complete this project in the
timeframe that we're being asked to complete it in.  I really appreciate
your efforts.

Stew & Richard,

I would be surprised if Enron was willing to store the minimum qty, but what
about sending it in the transaction request as an additional attribute?
Might they be talked into that?  This would be better for us since we should
not have to worry about maintaining our system information on the Enron
platform.

How about proposing that both platforms send the min & increment volume
requirements?  This would be more complex for us now, but might be better in
the long run for both platforms.  We would be more flexible and better able
to integrate with outside systems if we were able to accept this type of
information.  It get complicated because you could only fill where the two
requirements (our and the outside system) were compatible, but it is
do-able.  Thoughts?

Dennis &  Chris...

One other EOL scenario we forgot to talk about this evening was the scenario
where:

1)  EOL post 20,000 / day to our platform via. the price post interface...
2)  A True Quote customer submits a request to do 15,000 / day...
3) TQ submits a transaction attempt to EOL for 15,000 day...
4)  EOL only has 14,000 remaining, so they deny the entire transaction
attempt...

However, if Enron's system was aware that we would take partially filled Gas
orders in minimum increments of 5,000, EOL could have partially filled the
transaction request for 10,000.

Any news on that scenario?  I'll talk to Maria first thing in the morning...
perhaps this one is already resolved?   I would think it would be in EOL's
best business interest to store our minimum volumes, so EOL could always
fill us at least partially rather than deny the entire transaction.
However, it really doesn't matter to us (technically) we'll just cancel the
entire EOL transaction attempt and continue our sweep and fill the volume
with the next available counterparty.   Whereas if they partially filled us,
we would probably cancel the original transaction attempt, and rebuild a new
transaction deal ID for the 10,000 / day deal.... then continue the sweep
for the final 5,000 from the next available counterparty.

I haven't reviewed this scenario with the deal execution team yet, but if
EOL *did* partially fill us with *at least* our minimum, it would probably
be no more or less complex for us because even in a scenario where EOL
denies a transaction attempt, we ALREADY must have the logic to cancel the
EOL deal transaction attempt, and create a new order with the next available
counterparty (to fill the volume request).   So, if EOL did partially filled
us, we would simply cancel the original transaction request that was for the
full volume amount, and create a new deal with EOL for the partial volume
they confirmed, as opposed to creating a new deal with a different
counterparty.  Only one additional deal would have to be created with the
next available counterparty to fill the last 5,000 of the original request.
Seems simply enough... and it would be in EOL's best interest to fill our
transaction attempts partially so they would complete our transaction
attempts more often....   if they don't fill us partially, EOL will probably
end-up denying many of our transaction attempts if the exact volume is not
available.  hmm.... what do ya'll think?

Maria,

Stewart is correct in his understanding of no parital fills.  I will
reiterate his statements through the following examples:

If Enron posts a gas product with 50,000 MMBTU available and TrueQuote
attempts a transaction on 30,000 MMBTU, the attempt will be successfull if
the following 3 criteria are met:

1.  30,000 MMBTU is still available when the transaction hits EOL.
2.  30,000 MMBTU meets the minimum volume for the product as set by the
trader.
3.  30,000 MMBTU meets the increment volume for the product as set by the
trader.

Examples of how the 3 criteria above come into play:

1.  If when TrueQuote attempts to transact on 30,000 MMBTU, the volume
available for the product drops to below 30,000 MMBTU, the transaction will
fail.
2.  If TrueQuote attempts to transact on 30,000 MMBTU but the EOL trader
has set the minimum volume for the product to 40,000 MMBTU, the transaction
will fail.
3.  If TrueQuote attempts to transact on 32,500 MMBTU but the EOL trader
has set 5,000 MMBTU increments, the transaction will fail.

I set-up a meeting with Jay Webb and Andy Zipper for next Friday.  That is
the earliest we all could meet.  Once we talk, I'll coordinate a conference
call with you.  For the time being let's stay the course.

Regards,
David

Maria,

Please confirm with David that NO partial fills refers *only* to
transaction
attempts.  We fully expect that Enron will send us (potentially) large
volumes via. the price posting interface; then, we may execute multiple
transaction attempts for that EOL product ID to Enron via. the transaction
attempt interface.  These individual transaction attempts could be much
smaller (in volume) than the volume posted via. the price posting
interface.

Basically, the way we understand it is... the individual transaction
attempts will be 'all or nothing'; however, we can break the large price
post down and transmit multiple (smaller) transaction attempts against that

GFI requested a quote for NA Gas and Power, Coal, Emmisions, UK Power, UK 
Gas, European Gas and European Power.  I have calls into George McClellan 
(coal) and Tim Belden (West Power) to let them know about the negotiations.  
I need to know who at Enron you have discussed this with in London to make 
sure I run it past other interested parties in London prior to making an 
offer to GFI.  I am now talking to one of the GFI Managing Directors in New 
York and hopefully this will move the process along faster.

Amerex: Unwound $500 K / 75 % brokerage deal.  Asked them for a proposal for 
zero brokerage.  Original offer we made was $400 k and zero brokerage.  
Meeting schedules for Tuesday afternoon. Still waiting for John Nowlan to 
reply on crude products and Marcello Romano to reply on European Bandwidth.  

PVM: European Crude broker presented by Chris Glass; Forwarding NDA

ED&F Man: Waiting on Mary.  I will call if OK with you.

Prebon: Mike made initial offer with brokerage in it.  Mike informed Prebon 
of new price structure. Prebon to call back on Monday.

Natsource: Jack is waiting on a draft of the Agreements to begin 
discussions.  I will forward the Agreements once we approve.  I suspect early 
next week.

Credit: Working with Debbie on security level versus headroom.  Modeling June

Attached is a draft of the Broker Electronic Transaction Agreement which will 
be used to allow Brokers to transact on behalf of their customers.  Please 
review the document and give me any comments.  Please pay particuliar 
attention to Section 3 Transactions.  

Also please note that it will be imperative that broker confirmations are 
done each day on Broker Client Transactions to limit the exposure associated 
with online transaction broker breakage costs.  The confirmations group will 
be responsible for confirming each day and notifying credit immediately of 
any discrepancies between Enron and the Broker.   Notification by the 
confirmations group will be the only means by which credit will be informed 
to shut down broker activity in the case of a transaction that has not been 
confirmed and/or verified by the broker.

Thank you

Thanks for the quick response.  I will also be traveling later this week,
however, as always, I will be available by cell.  I will send you any
additional information from our side should it become available in the

Chris,
I have asked our team to review the document you sent me and to ascertain
what the hold up is. One thing that has been made clear to me is that we
were ready to begin testing a month ago and had to idle a group of folks
while your development team caught up. This has created a bit of a manpower
crunch for us but we will fix it. I will respond to you when I know more. I
am out of the office next two days but available on Thursday and Friday.

Andy,

Thanks for taking the time in reading the posting agreement and making 
comments.  

It is worth remembering that given a choice we would not be entering into 
this posting agreement.    The historical agreement with MG dictates many of 
the variances we will see from your other posting agreements.

Given the short time frame here, Justin is in the process of trying to set up 
a call with Travis and you for later today.  I have tried to address a couple 
of the points you raise below.

regards
bruce

Subject: eMetra posting agreement

I have read and reviewed the Posting Agreement. Let me preface my comments by 
saying that I'm sure there is stuff in the Posting Agreement that I am 
missing and I really want Travis McCullough to review it. I'm also curious as 
to why in certain sections it is faithful to the agreement I sent  and in 
other places seems to stray or omits things. Anyway here are my comments:

1). Whereas (A). How many eMetra platforms are there ? what does 
"collectively the Platforms" mean ? The agreement should be specific as to 
which platforms eMetra can display prices on.  There are two platforms one 
physical and one financial.  The primary focus of this agreement is on 
financial platform.

2). Regulatory Event, This language should really mirror the Posting 
Agreements in place. The language should cover the situation that if any of 
the events mentioned subject Enron or any of its affiliates to regulation it 
is a Regulatory Event, even if it does not impact upon the way eMetra 
conducts its business as contemplated by the agreement.

3). Term 2.2, There is no time limit on the date that eMetra commences LME 
trading. Given that the language is worded as the later of" this leaves them 
with all the leverage. It should be the earlier of. This is a big one as they 
could sit around forever trying to make it work and we are still bound by an 
agreement that runs 18 months from forever.  I agree with you on this one.  
Starting the clock now does not work but we should be able to set the clock 
at 18 months from Ap 30, 2001.

4). Establishment and Maintenance of Interfaces 4.1 We need to agree on who 
is responsible for what interfaces in this agreement, upfront. These were 
detailed in the agreement I sent to you. They are to responsible for 
maintaining the interfaces so we do not want to build them. In general we are 
responsible for specifying the interfaces and they are responsible for 
building and operating them. Once again, please refer to the posting 
agreement that was sent for the exhibits detailing this. 

5). Execution of Transactions 5.1 All parties agree to be bound by Enron's 
General Terms and Conditions.  We can discuss on the phone call.

6) Execution of Transactions 5.2.3 Please use the exact language from the 
Posting  Agreement sent. This wording is unclear. There is no time of 
transacting as there is no transaction unless price and volume are available 
at time of receipt of proposed transaction.

7). Execution of Transactions General comment: There is no language referring 
to eMetra taking responsibility for Mapping Errors. This is a big issue. We 
will not be responsible if they incorrectly display our prices, i.e. 3 mo. 
Aluminium displayed as 6 mo. Aluminium. Please refer to Posting Agreement for 
language.  I agree

8). Co-Operation 7.2 and 7.3 I would like to see both of these deleted. We 
have not given this to anyone else and it seems to be indirect conflict with 
13. This section pretty much rules out that we market EnronOnline to our 
customers and I don't see how we can live with it.  I think we would be 
willing to substitute some form of non-disparagement language in its place.  
We are balancing a couple of issues here.  Some of this is specific for 
Emetra.  John Sherriff has been involved in the business issues that have 
been agreed to.  Not withstanding the support of Emetra, we believe we have 
the freedom to market EOL and are released from the non-compete.

9). Default and Termination 9.1.1  How is the release from the non-compete 
tied to breach of this agreement ? There is no link between breach under this 
agreement and non-compete.

10). Default and Termination 9.1.1 Strike the term material from sentence. 
All parts of this agreement are material or they wouldn't be in it. Fine

11).  Default and Termination 9.1.4 and Enron Operational Failure. This is 
too broad. Only the failure of an aspect of the Enron platform that affects 
participants ability to conduct business with Enron through eMetra is 
relevant.  Fine 

12). Cost and Expenses. eMetra bears all costs relating to connectivity (i.e. 
T1's)  between eMetra to the Enron platform. Fine

13). Assignment should read "eMetra's right to display Enron's prices..."  
Fine

As I said earlier I'm sure there are things I 've left out and strongly 
suggest that Travis review it before signing.


Thanks,
Andy

Andy,

Per your request, I have outlined below the key terms of the most recent
equity transaction.

On September 8, 2000, PG&E invested $2 million in return for 7,500,000
shares ($.2667/share).
Enron's shares outstanding net of clawback equal 7,268,058 * .2667 = $1,
938,391.
Total shares outstanding as of 2/1/01 equal 31,440,896.

Please call if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Please review the comments below.  As I stated in our meeting on Friday, I
have been pushing our team for the February 16th deadline.  Unfortunately,
there are some issues that have not been resolved and may be putting our
deadline in jeopardy.  I wanted you to review this summary of the current
state of affairs and compare it to your team's opinion on the situation.
Again, this is Maria's view of the situation, which might be totally
different from your team's perspective.  We do not want the situation to
become an "us v. them" mentality, so I am taking this opportunity to solicit
your feedback.  Dennis and I are hoping we can work diligently to make up
this time and resolve these issues in a joint effort.  We look forward to
your comments and completing this link once and for all.

Please let me know if I can provide any other input.

Best Regards,
Chris

Subject: Concerns with Status of Enron Integration Testing


Chris,

Dennis asked that I send you a note expressing our concern with the delays
that we have been experiencing with the Enron Integration testing.

We have essentially not made any progress since we began testing "Enron
Posting Prices to True Quote" on January 17th.  First, the test did not work
because there was a problem at Enron with price updates not posting
correctly to their integration server.  This problem was resolved and we
were asked to repeat the test a week later on January 24th.  This test was
also unsuccessful because the data we received did not contain any spaces
between words.  As of today, it has not been determined whether the problem
is on Enron's side or ours.  We have been continuing to research the problem
on our side and so far it looks to us like the data is arriving on our
server without the spaces. Enron's Operations group was planning to do a
test today to "sniff" the network to determine how the data is actually
leaving their firewall, but they have had other problems that have prevented
them from working with us today.  Last Friday they were not able to spend
any time working with us because they were getting ready for their
maintenance window.

Our concern is that each time we have encountered a problem, it has taken
several days to resolve the issue before we can move on to the next series
of tests.  Understanding that the due date is only 3 weeks away, the True
Quote team is concerned that Enron is not providing enough resources to work
the problems immediately and resolve them as quickly as possible.  Part of
the reason for some of the delay on Enron's side may be that the group that
is involved in the testing has had to go back to the developer group for
assistance each time they have encountered a problem (at least that's our
understanding).  We don't believe that there is anyone in the developer
group that is dedicated to resolve our problems as soon as one is reported.

The reality of this situation is that we have one project but many different
disconnected teams working on the project.  As we move forward we would like
to make the following recommendations to improve the speed of our testing
activities:

1) Rather than working as two disconnected teams (testing via conference
call), it would be helpful if we had an Enron person here in our office each
time we test and communicate back to Enron the results that we are getting.
That person should be someone that has a direct link back to the developers
group, the operations group, and the products group.

2) The Enron resource should have as their priority to work with the
necessary groups within Enron to resolve issues as quickly as possible.

3) The developers group needs to address problems that are reported by the
testers as quickly as possible.

We welcome any other suggestions that you or Andy have to improve the speed
of our testing and implementation process.  Please let me know once you've
had a chance to speak to Andy if there is anything that he can do to provide
us resources to proceed with our testing more expeditiously.

Andy,

As you might expect in this market environment, valuations are down
significantly from our last round.  I expect we'll be south of $50mm.  We've
slashed our expenses so we won't have to take as much $$ at such a low
valuation.  We only need $5mm to $10mm to get us through to the other side.
At these prices, I expect certain of our existing shareholders to step up.
Just as there was a disconnection between underlying fundamentals and
valuations in the first half of 2000, I feel like there is now a disconnect
on the downside.  Operationally, we're ahead of plan and looking at
profitablity in the third quarter, but most VCs are licking their wounds and
frozen.  They are a bunch of lemmings.  I won't have specific dilution
figures until we firm up the round.  Obviously, I want to sell as little of
the company as possible in this market.  I'll keep you posted.

I'm also working on a proposal on the global strategy I mentioned to you and
Louise in our meeting.  Will have something to share with you in early Feb.

Please keep all this confidential.  I'm headed to Europe later this
afternoon, but will be back on Wednesday if you want to talk.

Best regards,
Frank

For reference, what value does the round of financing you are working on
place on HoustonStreet and how much dilution do you anticipate ?

John,

As per our discussion of this afternoon, I am noting below the points that we 
have discussed and agreed with respect to IP transport products, which were 
originally set-up for video taping purpose for the analyst meeting on 24 
January 2001. 

As per your request, we will set-up the IP transport products in the product 
manager in such a manner so that they can be traded in the future, which will 
be some time next week, contingent upon 3 conditions to which you have 
already agreed.  

1.  The new GTCs and the product descriptions have to conform with  each 
other (we are in the process of checking this).

2.  For the foreseeable future, the products have to  be displayed on  
EnronOnline on daily basis (with the exception of holidays) with relevant 
prices and 
     must  be made available for trading with  approved counter-parties .

3.  As I mentioned to you over the phone, in essence this is a full scale 
launch. Therefore, the cost associated with the launch of IP transports 
products will    
     be similar to that for  any other standard launch ( about US$ 250,000).  
Further details on this will be provided to you shortly.  Obviously any cost 
that your      group has   already incurred for the analyst demo  will be 
netted off against the total cost of launch.

As I also explained to you that the normal operational  procedure for 
EnronOnline mandates that any changes with respect to system/database take 
place over the weekend. However, as you have indicated the necessity and the 
urgency of giving the reading rights to your counter-parties by Friday, we 
will endeavour to do so.  However, this will require substantial deployment 
of additional resources to ensure that we do not compromise the integrity of 
EnronOnline system while fulfilling your request.

If you have any questions, please let know.

Naveed

Mark,

Here is a draft for the Fee Agreement language for the margining.  this 
language should tie with the liquidated damages language that you have for 
the RTA.  I think that we will need to remove the words or settle from the 
liquidated damages paragraph.  Brokers do not have settlement risk.

Ged, Peter,

Following further discussions, I attach a new draft of the document.  As 
before, this is subject to further internal Enron review, and has not been 
circulated to any other parties.

All new, as well as existing changes to the extent these still apply, are 
marked.

Thanks.

Attached is a Price Schedule, which follows the approximate structure we 
discussed the other day. As previously mentioned, I aggregated some things 
where it seemed to make sense to do so.

I have highlighted the Bridge Setup sections. I boosted this level from what 
we discussed.

Also, I think our Auctions charges are too high. Suggest we drop the 
per-Auction charge down to $2,000 (cost is less than $1,000).

After a week and a half of silence from Houston Street, I found out today 
that they have taken over responsibility for their exchange linking 
development from Sapient.  According to the Houston Street project manager, 
Sapient was being too cautious and thorough in their efforts to get to market 
and Houston Street wasn't impressed with their progress to date.  Sapient had 
as of last week finished the design work for the system and has provided the 
design to Houston Street.  Houston Street will use their own internal team to 
complete the project and feels confident they will finish by the 15 January 
deadline.  

This does not bode well for the exchange that appeared to be light years 
ahead of TrueQuote in their development efforts.

Andy,

Attached is a spreadsheet which runs through direct costs of adding Markets 
to EnronOnline, as discussed yesterday.

There is both art and science in this, along with some generalisations.

Perhaps we can discuss at 11:00?

Yesterday we agreed in principal to a broker client transaction with Amerex.  
the basis of the deal is as follows:

1 year
$500,000 license fee paid in 12 monthly payments
25% brokerage reduction for EnronOnline transactions
EnronOnline transactions may be executed either by clicking or by calling the 
trader and requesting to trade on the posted price (they have a contractual 
arrangement with Altra that potentialy precludes clicking, they are trying to 
negotiate with Altra)
NA Gas; NA Power; Bandwidth and Crude Products

Attached is my cut at an LOI based upon the Natsource model.  We need to get 
this out as soon as possible.  Let me know how I can help.

John,

We are in the process of preparing an invoice for the $250,000 charge for 
setting up your IP product.

This should be sent to your attention in the next few days. If you would 
prefer to have it sent elsewhere within EBS, please let us know.

Thanks,

Hi J

These are my initial comments and have not spoken to Andy about them.  Andy 
has sent his comments to you already.

Comments re Price Posting Agreement:

 Enron should retain for itself the ability to choose which counterparties 
can trade on its prices - the physical platform will be open to more than the 
LME  members.
 Schedule A - do the phys metals guys intend to post prices for all the 
metals in Schedule A?  Currently we only post phys aluminium and copper on   
EnronOnline.
 Clause 4 - need to decide now who is responsible for building the 
interface.  Would prefer them to build.
 Clause 4.1 - the mutually agreeable protocol to be developed and implemented 
prior to Interface Completion Date.
 Clause 5.1 - how does this work vis a vis our GTCs - especially for the 
physical platform?
 Clause 9.1.1 - date for physical platform to be 31 March 2001.
 Clause 10 - confidentiality for specified period?
 Clause 12, Line 5 - have some extra words "...theory of liability ..."
 Clause 18 - need to refer to both eMetra platforms.

Comments re the Price Posting Agreement - Side Letter:

 What is eMetra's fee structure for both platforms?
 eMetra not to waive or change fee structure without notice to and consent of 
Enron.
 Itemised breakdown of fee income to include all participants.

Justin - we also need to deal with the indicative price feed that our 
technology guys are currently working on - can we include in this agreement?

Regards

A

Andy,

As a follow-up to our phone conversation, True Quote is in the process of
obtaining an equity bridge in the range of $1 to $2 million.  True Quote's
current cash position is tight and we need to complete this process within
the next two/three weeks.    Due to the current state of the capital
markets, management feels it is prudent to solicit a small bridge amount.
Once "traction" (EOL link complete, TQTS deal complete, etc..) is obtained,
we will continue to solicit larger equity investments from strategic
partners and the investment community.

I would be glad to discuss the current state of affairs in more detail and
provide the appropriate information if you are interested in pursuing this
opportunity.

Regards,
Todd A. Creek

Andy, Travis

Following our call last night, I attach a re-draft of the Posting Agreement, 
marked to show the changes.

Look forward to your response, in particular relating to the identification 
of the relevant Interfaces and the respective responsibilities of the parties.

Thanks

Justin

Upon further reflection I think we need to revisit the issue of specifying 
the interfaces. Given that EnronOnline will be implementing and operating 
this agreement leaving the interface specifications up in the air is asking 
for a lot of work/trouble next year. They are fairly generic and 
straightfoward and should not create a delay. They really are an integral 
partof the posting agreement. If you would like to discuss I am available 
tomorrow, give me a ring

As many of you are aware, over the last few weeks the Kiodex transaction has 
changed such that it no longer includes the sale of EnergyDesk.   The new 
transaction structure is limited to the Kiodex/EOL Strategic Relationship and 
performance warrants.  Attached is the final version of the non-binding 
Kiodex LOI which was signed November 21, 2000.  Our goal is to finalize the 
documents and close by year end.  If anyone has any questions or comments 
please feel free to give me a call at the numbers listed below.  Thank you.

Andy, do we have any intention of doing any integration with Tradespark at 
this time?  If we do I will get more involved in this otherwise we will just 
let the infrastructure team continue to run with this.

Let me know,
bbh

I need to have another discussion about this with you . . . we need an 
application group to work on this, because there is quite a bit of 
application analysis that needs to be done.

I found out that from an infrastructure perspective, this is much more than 
just a remote connection.  It involves an application implemented in our 
environment, and applications deployed to the desktop.  Is this something the 
e-commerce team needs to be involved in (I don't think it is), but probably 
more like Beth Perlman's team.

Bob.

Correction to previous e-mail:
 The equipment we would send to Enron would comprise of 2 Cisco 2600
Routers (1 for each circuit), 2 Cisco Hubs, 2 Sun Ultra 5s with 2 NIC cards
each. Each Sun would connect to its own hub and router for redundancy and
load balancing purposes.
Sorry for the confusion.

Attached is a draft of the body of a Consent Agreement that we would like to 
obtain from eSpeed at the closing to enter into what we have referred to as 
the "Project Raptor" transactions.  Please let me know if you have any 
comments or questions regarding the attached.



Ted Stockbridge has forward to us a revised draft of the Exclusivity 
Agreement with our collective comments.  We should be able to send that to 
you tomorrow after Andy has reviewed that markup.  I believe Chris or Anthony 
have discussed our remaining comments to the equity documents with Richard.

Travis:

 Please find attached a clean and redline version of the revised
Exclusivity Agreement, with the changes that we discussed.  The redline
shows changes from the draft submitted to us by eSpeed.

 Per our earlier conversation, you said that Andy was still thinking
about one open point, namely: Whether the definition of the Enron Platform
should be modified to anticipate some changes that may occur.  Specifically
I suggested that the requirement that the Enron Platform be "operated" by an
Enron Party be deleted, and leaving only the limitation of ownership.

 I have given Anthony comments on the series designation.  He will be
making other changes to the designation and will forward it to you directly.

 Please let me know if you have any questions or comments, or if I
can be of any further assistance.

 Best regards,

 Ted
