Shudeish with the state of Arizona just phoned and said that he and Probaht 
Baragava are available to meet with us on Thursday at 2:00 pm.  This is the 
only time and day of this week that they will be able to see us.  I asked 
about whether Kathy OConnell and Nancy Wrona would be able to attend this 
meeting and he stated that their calendars were full this week and would not 
attend.   He will need to know by tomorrow whether to book this meeting and 
who will be attending.  Sarah had mentioned that Thrusday was not a good day 
for her.  Should we schedule this and if so, who will be attending in Sarah's 
place?

Subject: Telephone Conversation with EPA

After the telephone conference call we had on 9/17, I contacted the Roger 
Kohn permit engineer with EPA about a possible meeting with his agency to 
resolve and assist the issuance of the air permits for stations 3 and 4.  His 
message back to me was a reiteration of the last request I made to him, that 
he could see no way that Transwestern would be able to help the EPA in this 
matter.  We discussed the possibility of Transwestern contacting his 
supervisor, Gerardo Rios, about a potential meeting and he indicated that we 
could choose this avenue if we desired. 

Gerardo's telephone number is 415-744-1259.

Absolutely - we can outline what it would take.  Greg Simmons definitely
said that it would be a congressional decision in D.C. - I asked him "what
about the 'energy initiative' and 'expedited review'" - he said that it
probably would not matter in this case - National Monuments are off limits
to new ROWs without an act of congress.

By the way, I got a call back from Greg Simmons in the BLM State Office in
Arizona - my question to him was whether or not a proposed ROW across the
Agua Fria National Monument would constitute a "Fatal Flaw."  He indicated
that it likely would be a fatal flaw.  He said that it would take "an act
of
congress" literally, not figuratively, to put a pipeline across a National
Monument.  The boundary of the Monument is the east side of I 17, south of
Cordes Junction - I don't know if we can stay on the west side of the
Interstate there, but we might oughta check it out - it looks like we could
get into some pretty rough side-sloping, two-toning.  FYI.

As an update to many of you, I have been on the phone with Roger Kohn of EPA
Region 9 a couple of different times today.  It turns out that what they
really were expecting to see was something more like a formal Biological
Assessment (BA) for CS 3 and CS 4, not a biological survey report like we
provided.  According to the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the lead Federal
agency in a Federal Action is responsible for preparing the BA, but a BA is
typically only required when the action "may affect" a listed species, which
is not the case here.  EPA Region 9, and based on our experience across the
country, apparently only Region 9, is interpreting their responsibilities
under the ESA very strictly and somewhat "oddly."  Regardless, the bottom
line is that it appears we could argue with them ad nauseum and still end up
right back here.  So, we have begun working very quickly and diligently to
put together a "BA-like" document that, according to Roger, will give them
what they need to put in their files to cover themselves for satisfying the
ESA.

I told him that the USFWS typically (under "normal" circumstances) receives
a BA from the lead federal agency and then issues their Biological Opinion
(BO).  I asked him if they (EPA) were going to still feel like they needed
any kind of concurrence from the USFWS.  He said that only if we were going
to have any findings of "may affect" would they maybe feel the need to get
additional concurrence from the USFWS.  I told him that you (Larry) already
have a verbal concurrence from USFWS that there are no issues, in addition
to the fact that our surveys confirmed that.  I told him that our "BA-like"
document is going to come to the same conclusions that our Survey Report did
(i.e., No Effect).  He said that he understands, and will likely just
receive the document, assure himself that it says what it needs to say, and
is formatted in the manner he feels it needs to be formatted, put it in his
files, and put out the Public Notice for a 30-day comment period.  If this
all happens by early next week, we should still have permits by the
beginning of November. I will continue to hammer home the importance of that
schedule.  Some of us will be on a conference call with Roger and one of the
EPA attorneys tomorrow to try to "get inside their heads" a little bit
better regarding why they are the only Region interpreting their ESA
responsibilities so strictly.  We will debrief you after the call.  Scott

John, to my knowledge there are no ciritical habitats at either site.  In
my previous life as a consultant I did a considerable amount of work with
ESA in NM and AZ and on reservation lands.  To add to this, the whole
disturbance issue of compressor station activities from 1967 (sta. 2) and
1959 (sta.3) would strongly support your supposition that there wont be any
surprises.  Ive spoken to Region IX EPA and this issue wont delay the
processing of the permits for either station.  I would think that from the
time the reports are completed to clearnace by the Navajo Nation, would be
about 30 days.  That is the approximate time limit  that the SHPO
clearances received.  Again, weve received verbal clearance from the Navajo
Nation at these sites regarding T&Es.  The project start point is station
2, so we have some room in the event the survey approvals take longer than
30 days, but I agree with you that we need to move this along.  Ill be more
than happy to motivate the Navajos and EPA after the reports are
submitted.....Scott Patti has promised me he would let me know when the
Navajos have said "yes" and he would charge into the field and do the
surveys.

Larry,
Please proceed with all haste on this.  How long to complete them and
submit the findings (can't believe there would be anything turn up).  No
endangered plants in any of those station yards - I trust?  The EPA is
reaching here, but they have the big stick and we must work through this to
get the air permit.  This is a lesson's learned for the upcoming Sun Devil
project.  John

     The issue arose when the EPA in San Francisco said they would not
     issue an air permit unless we had addressed all concerns relevant to
     the endangered species act, even on distsurbed lands at stations 3 and
     4.  Even though we had received a verbal approval formt he Navajo
     Nation that endangered species would not be a concern by the Nation,
     the EPA felt otherwise.  This means that they wont give us a permit
     until we do a survey for plants and animals.  Because ENSR was on the
     list of contractors approved by the Navajo Nation, they were given the
     opportunity.  As you know, I have been working with Scott Patti on
     this and we have worked it through.  All that is left is to get the
     ENSR renewal permit application approved by the Nation and ENSR is off
     and running to do the surveys.  Terry, I know that you know all this,
     I just wanted to keep John and Bill in the loop on how things are
     progressing......

     Larry,

     I understand from Scott Patti that the EPA has thrown a monkey wrench
     into
     the air permitting process for stations 3 and 4 and are now requesting
     endangered species surveys.  For simplicity, we will add this as a new
     task
     for the Red Rock Expansion project.  The FT. Collins folks are
     proceeding
     based on your verbal go ahead, but to make our accountants happy, I
     will
     have to get something written authorizing the additional work.  Scott
     is
     estimating the task to cost approximately $7,000.  Since I am listed
     as the
     project manager on paper, I will put together a brief letter and get
     it to
     you this week.  However, please continue to directly coordinate with
     Scott
     and he will keep me apprised of the status.

     Thanks,

Larry,

Unfortunately, there does not appear to be an USGS aerial available that
covers Station 1.  In case you need them, I did find coverage for station 3
and 4.

Additionally, there is no published soil surveys covering any of the station
sites.  I intend to word resource report 7 to reflect that.  I will also
address impacts to soils.  I think this will suffice.  We did get some
vegetation descriptions put together for the areas in and around the
stations.

Terry.

Larry- Please review the PM lb/hr limits and the annual test for both the 
turbine and the generator at the Kingman station. Let me know if you have any 
problems, otherwise i will try to get the permit issued tomorrow, if not 
today. The Director, Nancy Wrona, has to sign off, so i have to try and get 
into her calendar.

Thanks. Shudeish

The changes i made are:-

KINGMAN

Larry,
I think you should go forward with the meeting to show that this is a 
critically important issue for TWP. I hope that Sarah can be there, but if 
she can't, is there another person in addition to yourself? Assuming Prabat 
joins Shudeish, we had anticipated this as the first step, particularly 
because we would like to resolve this with the "first-line" regulators for 
long-term good relations; Steve Burr will be cheering us on from the 
sidelines, to the extent he is consulted. If the first meeting is a 
stonewall, we then have to go to Cathy and Nancy, but let's make the first 
effort with Shudeish & Prabat.
A couple of thoughts. ADEQ was required to give a completeness notice within 
41 days of the application, at the latest; altho this time frame may not have 
been met, it may have been because of follow-up questions on the netting 
calculation. Also, was there any discussion whether any of the following 
applied:
     a. Facility change allowed w/o permit revision (R18-2-317)
     b. Minor permit revision (R18-2-319.A), which could shorten EPA review 
time and possibly avoid a public hearing
     c. Accelerated processing (R18-2-326.N)
These may have been hashed out in pre-application meetings, and water under 
the bridge now, particularly because it appears that ADEQ is viewing these as 
NEW permits (compare the numbers on DEQ's completeness determination letters 
with the numbers on the "permit revision applications"), but the story of net 
benefits to air quality, as well as the need to improve energy supply to 
California, should be persuasive factors to get this back to head of the 
line, as you had been told in the spring. It may be that Shudeish and Prabat 
need to be reminded of the benign nature of this equipment change-over.
Bottom line, I think you should go forward Thursday if that is the only day 
available this week. It is important that TWP know what barriers stand in the 
way of prompt evaluation and that TWP offer what assistance it can in 
overcoming those barriers. It is important also that ADEQ understand that 
there are a number of actions that TWP wants to initiate in order to meet the 
project schedule that it had developed last spring when it received initial 
assurances of prompt review. [can you send me that list?] If Shudeish and 
Prabat are to be barriers, it is important to know as soon as possible so we 
can start moving up the chain.
There are, in fact, a number of energy projects gearing up in Arizona now, 
and the Corporation Commission's Facility Siting Committee is taking a 
pro-environment bent (following the Calif AQMDs), but a number of these 
projects also are dealing with county, rather than state, permits.
I will be available Thursday to take before and/or after the DEQ meeting.

Shudeish with the state of Arizona just phoned and said that he and Probaht
Baragava are available to meet with us on Thursday at 2:00 pm.  This is the
only time and day of this week that they will be able to see us.  I asked
about whether Kathy OConnell and Nancy Wrona would be able to attend this
meeting and he stated that their calendars were full this week and would
not attend.   He will need to know by tomorrow whether to book this meeting
and who will be attending.  Sarah had mentioned that Thrusday was not a
good day for her.  Should we schedule this and if so, who will be attending
in Sarah's place?

Subject:  Telephone Conversation with EPA

After the telephone conference call we had on 9/17, I contacted the Roger
Kohn permit engineer with EPA about a possible meeting with his agency to
resolve and assist the issuance of the air permits for stations 3 and 4.
His message back to me was a reiteration of the last request I made to him,
that he could see no way that Transwestern would be able to help the EPA in
this matter.  We discussed the possibility of Transwestern contacting his
supervisor, Gerardo Rios, about a potential meeting and he indicated that
we could choose this avenue if we desired.

Gerardo's telephone number is 415-744-1259.

that each application contained the correct and proper information required=

by the EPA and State of Arizona.  When I told them that we would need the=

permits by the end of September, each agency indicated that a September=20

aware of possible conflicts and resolve any concerns.  In all monthly calls=

both agencies assured me that the permits were progressing on schedule and =

date, calls to the agencies were conducted weekly and this was when I was=

John, I have attached the site characteristics for the 4 locations in Az. 
where Transwestern plans to install the four RB211's.  With this information 
please provide emissions quarantees for each location (sta. 1-4).  We will 
use the same gas quality for each location.  I have a meeting with the agency 
on the 26th of Feb. and would greaatly appreciate the guarantees prior to 
this date.  If possible, I am going to try and permit each site for 45 ppm 
NOx as opposed to the 25 ppm NOx number, so I would appreciate your 
assistance in this also.

Here are the individual plot plans for 1 and 2.



M3-1A.dwg & .tif are the station 1 plot plans. M3-1B.dwg & .tif are the 
station 2 plot plans. The files need to be placed in the same directory. You 
would open the .dwg file in Autocad and it will bring in the related .tif to 
complete the drawing.

Thanks

Byron,

Below is the letter I committed to provide Arnold this afternoon.  I see
that Vadim beat me to it by sending you an earlier email.  As a general
commentary, I would however, like to make the following clarifications on
the subject which ETS may find useful.

Particulate matter in the gas tubine exhaust comes from a variety of sources
and may include smoke, ash, corrosion and erosion products, condensable
hydrocarbons, inlet air particulates and particulates from the fuel and
injected water or steam when applicable.  In addition, SO3 in the exhaust is
generally trapped on a wet collection medium as H2SO4 and may appear as
particulates due to the measurement procedure.

Gas turbines are very clean burning and are not, in general, sources of
significant quantities of particulate emissions when burning good quality
fuels.  With distillate fuel containing less than 0.5% by weight, sulfur,
total particulates at high power are expected to be less than 0.6 lbs. per
1000 lb. fuel as measured by EPA Method 5.  Please note that the method used
for measuring particulate matter can have a significant impact on the
particulate level determined.  For estimating purposes, all particulates may
be considered to be in the size range less than 10 micrometers.

With pipeline quality natural gas, there is virtually no smoke and the fuel
contains no sulfur or ash.  As a result, total engine generated particulate
emissions are generally undetectable by EPA Method 5.  Due to other
particulate sources and the sensitivity of the measurement method, total
particulates with pipeline quality natural gas for the LM2500 are estimated
to be less than 3 pounds per hour assuming cleanliness levels for the inlet
air, fuel, and water/steam injection in accordance with GE requirements.

Regards, Jos,.

Ruth, I spoke to the ADEQ about the accelerated permit program and apparently 
there are some internal problems with this program and the third party 
contractors which are on their "list".  At this stage of the game, they 
recommended that we do not resort to this alternative as most of the work 
that the contractor would do has been done by the ADEQ allready.  I then 
indicated that I would be contacting the Director of the ADEQ about the 
urgency of this multi million dollar project and the benefits to the state of 
Arizona.  The permit engineer thought that would be a good idea. Because we 
will be permitting through this agency again for Sundevil, and dont want to 
upset the agency cart, I am going to speak with the permit engineers 
supervisor and then to the Director of the ADEQ next week about either an 
accelerated issuance of the permit or more realistically, allowance to do 
some construction activities while the ADEQ is completing the review and 
permit writing.  This way, I wont step on any toes.  By the way, the ADEQ 
said that they dont consider this to be a PSD issue.  The following time line 
for permit issuance under the Arizona laws at this stage appears to be: 
another 2-3 weeks to write the permit, one month by the ADEQ technical staff 
to do the required internal review and then the  EPA is given a one month 
period to do their review, which is requried by the EPA for all class 1 
permit applications in Arizona.  Because Im going to be in Phoenix next week, 
I might be able to set a meeting up with the ADEQ Director and plead 
Transwestern's case.  Ill let you know how it goes......

Larry, just to keep you posted, Jon has returned from CS 3 and 4.  He did
not find anything of concern.  We are working on the survey report and
should have it to you next week to review.  Will you be out all week in the
chopper, or will you be back before the end of the week?  Either way, we
should have a report for you to review by Wednesday, Thursday at the latest.
Does anyone else need a copy?  Let us know.  Thanks,  Scott

John, to my knowledge there are no ciritical habitats at either site.  In
my previous life as a consultant I did a considerable amount of work with
ESA in NM and AZ and on reservation lands.  To add to this, the whole
disturbance issue of compressor station activities from 1967 (sta. 2) and
1959 (sta.3) would strongly support your supposition that there wont be any
surprises.  Ive spoken to Region IX EPA and this issue wont delay the
processing of the permits for either station.  I would think that from the
time the reports are completed to clearnace by the Navajo Nation, would be
about 30 days.  That is the approximate time limit  that the SHPO
clearances received.  Again, weve received verbal clearance from the Navajo
Nation at these sites regarding T&Es.  The project start point is station
2, so we have some room in the event the survey approvals take longer than
30 days, but I agree with you that we need to move this along.  Ill be more
than happy to motivate the Navajos and EPA after the reports are
submitted.....Scott Patti has promised me he would let me know when the
Navajos have said "yes" and he would charge into the field and do the
surveys.

Larry,
Please proceed with all haste on this.  How long to complete them and
submit the findings (can't believe there would be anything turn up).  No
endangered plants in any of those station yards - I trust?  The EPA is
reaching here, but they have the big stick and we must work through this to
get the air permit.  This is a lesson's learned for the upcoming Sun Devil
project.  John

     The issue arose when the EPA in San Francisco said they would not
     issue an air permit unless we had addressed all concerns relevant to
     the endangered species act, even on distsurbed lands at stations 3 and
     4.  Even though we had received a verbal approval formt he Navajo
     Nation that endangered species would not be a concern by the Nation,
     the EPA felt otherwise.  This means that they wont give us a permit
     until we do a survey for plants and animals.  Because ENSR was on the
     list of contractors approved by the Navajo Nation, they were given the
     opportunity.  As you know, I have been working with Scott Patti on
     this and we have worked it through.  All that is left is to get the
     ENSR renewal permit application approved by the Nation and ENSR is off
     and running to do the surveys.  Terry, I know that you know all this,
     I just wanted to keep John and Bill in the loop on how things are
     progressing......

     Larry,

     I understand from Scott Patti that the EPA has thrown a monkey wrench
     into
     the air permitting process for stations 3 and 4 and are now requesting
     endangered species surveys.  For simplicity, we will add this as a new
     task
     for the Red Rock Expansion project.  The FT. Collins folks are
     proceeding
     based on your verbal go ahead, but to make our accountants happy, I
     will
     have to get something written authorizing the additional work.  Scott
     is
     estimating the task to cost approximately $7,000.  Since I am listed
     as the
     project manager on paper, I will put together a brief letter and get
     it to
     you this week.  However, please continue to directly coordinate with
     Scott
     and he will keep me apprised of the status.

     Thanks,

     Terry.

Mr. Campbell,

Here is the Flagstaff review.  There seems to be some confusion with the
ADEQ regarding the generator engines.  There is no need to accept a 7800
hour limitation.

Joe, presented below is the first memo I sent out concering the air permit 
issue:

[Yesterday evening I phoned both the state of Arizona ( agency for stations 1 
and 2) and Region 9 EPA ( agency for stations 3 and 4) concerning the status 
of when the air permits would be issued by both agencies for the Redrock 
expansion.  I was surprised to find out that both agencies stated a 2-4 month 
delay prior to issuance.  They cited back log of other permits, public 
comment periods, and workload as being the main reasons.  I am particularily 
disappointed because there were pre meetings with both agencies identifying 
what was to be included in each application package, and even after the 
applications were submitted in March of this year, each agency came back and 
asked for different information that from what was discussed at each meeting.

I have a call into the state of Arizona ( construction is to begin at Station 
2 and they have jurisdiction for this station) to see if we can initiate  
some construction activities  such as laying pipe and building foundations 
prior to receiving the permit.  I have been given these types of approvals 
from other agencies in the past, but these types of approvals are extremely 
narrow and restrictive.   If this flys I am sure that they will require us to 
make sure the turbine is not brought on site until the permit has been 
issued.  I know this will require written approval from the agency, but this 
may allow us to proceed on schedule and avoid any delays.  Ill keep you 
apprised of this issue.]

I spoke with the ADEQ after our conference call and they directed me to 
another group (compliance) in the air permit section.  They strongly 
suggested that I contact the compliance group before contacting Nancy Wrona, 
Director of the ADEQ.  I left a message with the supervisor of the ADEQ 
compliance section, Kathy McConnell (?) 602-207-2328, but have not heard back 
from her.  Either Bill Kendrick or I will  be touching base with her again, 
tomorrow.

Arnold has given me the following list of construction items he would like to 
have the ADEQ grant us permission/waiver to do in leau of receiving the air 
permits:

 all earthwork
 trench construction and piping tie ins
 all foundation and building construction
 installation of ancillary equipment

This list is probably too aggressive and falls out of what the agency may 
allow us to do.

The EPA contact for the Sta. 3 and 4 air permits: permit engineer  Roger 
Cohn      (415) 744-1238
      Supervisor  Geraldo Rios    (415) 744-1259

The ADEQ contact for Sta. 1 and 2 air permit permit engineer  Shudeish 
Mahadev (?)   (602) 207-2323
      Director   Nancy Wrona

After the telephone conference call we had on 9/17, I contacted the Roger 
Kohn permit engineer with EPA about a possible meeting with his agency to 
resolve and assist the issuance of the air permits for stations 3 and 4.  His 
message back to me was a reiteration of the last request I made to him, that 
he could see no way that Transwestern would be able to help the EPA in this 
matter.  We discussed the possibility of Transwestern contacting his 
supervisor, Gerardo Rios, about a potential meeting and he indicated that we 
could choose this avenue if we desired. 

Gerardo's telephone number is 415-744-1259.

Hi Larry,

Per our conversation today, I want to make sure I understand your intent
for the transition periods for Klagetoh and Leupp.  Below are two
conditions from the draft Klagetoh permit.  We would use the same approach
for Leupp.  Please let me know whether we have understood your intent
correctly.  Note that there will also be some associated recordkeeping
requirements.

The following conditions apply during the transition period.  The
transition period is defined as the six month period that starts on the
first day that Emission Unit 404 (GE gas turbine) or Emission Units  423 or
424 (Catepillar generator engines) operates.

     1.        During the transition period, Emission Units 401, 402, and
          403 (Clark compressor engines) shall not operate simultaneously
          with Emission Unit 404 (GE gas turbine). [40 CFR

     2.        During the transition period, either Emission Unit 421 or
          422 (Waukesha generator engines) may operate simultaneously with
          either Emission Unit 423 or 424 (Catepillar generator engines).
          Under no circumstances may Emission Unit 421 operate
          simultaneously with Emission Unit 422, nor may Emission Unit 423

Larry,   your ears are good!    I just heard the same news.    I sent some 
data on emissions on the RB211on 1/31

resending the e-mails attchments.


In orfer to capture the emissions credits for shutting down the existing 
units, we need to get the current emissions and the last 2 years of operating 
data and talk to the state about netting the results for the permit.   

REMEMBER:  for the first 6 months, we are asking to leave the old units 
operational to use for emergency purposes during transition outages......NOT 
BOTH AT THE SAME TIME.

Subject: Re: TW Expansion emissions  

Arnold, I feel the major permitting issue will be if we add NOx or CO 
emissions greater than PSD levels (40 tons per year) at the facility.  
However, if we were to remove one or more of the existing recip units at each 
compressor station or reduce operating hours on one or more recip units to 
allow the emissions from the turbine to be included with the facility, this 
should be more than enough of a facility reduction that the turbine emissions 
would pose no problem.  To add the turbine emissions without taking away 
existing emissions from the facility will more that likely kick us into PSD.  
This is a very time consuming and extremely expensive option and would more 
than likely cause us to do extensive modeling and retrofit emissions control 
technology on any emissions source which is at the facility.  Because we 
operate both 2 cycle lean burn and 4 cycle rich burns on the system, our 
emissions control technology options can be limited and could increase 
additional manpower in the operation of the control technologies.  

I would also like to bring up a potential problem that probably has not be 
addressed and that is the issue of emissions impacting the Grand Canyon.  I 
have been contacted by the state of Arizona several years  ago concerning 
questions about modeling  our emissions and  the problems the state is 
encountering with emissiosn sources impacting a Class 1 sentive area.  The 
Grand Canyon is in this classification.  I dont know how or to what extent 
our present emissions might impact the Canyon, however, due to the relative 
proximity and prevailing wind directions toward the Canyon from a couple of 
our stations, I wouldnt be surprised if airshed concerns become an issue.   
As a planning tool, I would allow 4-6 months for non PSD permitting and 12-18 
months for permitting PSD facilities.  Again understand that these time 
estimates might be too conservative.  Another issue is that we will be 
dealing with two different air agencies.  The State of Arizona and the Navajo 
Nation EPA.  As is the present case, all major permitting for facilities on 
the Navajo Resevation has in the past gone through Region IX EPA with 
descretion from the NNEPA..  As you may or may not know, stations 3 and 4 are 
on the Reservation.

I have left a call with Bill Kendrick to determine if I should initiate data 
gathering for the permit application submittal or if someone else is to do 
the permitting.  When I hear from him, Ill let you know what he says. In any 
event you are right, we should probably discuss this further.....

Arnold

Attached is the Coberra 6562 DLE emissions for the Transwestern project.
We have only provided data at 100 % base load because this produces the
highest levels of emissions between 70 and 100% power.  The CO vppm does
not increase until the power dropped below 70% load.

I hope you find this data satisfactory. If you need any additional
information, please let me know.

Earl Arnold, I have heard through the grapevine that Stan has approved the 
abondonment of the existing recips and installation of a turbine to replace 
the recips at each  of the C/S in Arizona.  Is this true?  If so, I would 
greatly appreciate the engine manufacturers emissions  and performance data 
for the turbines air permit application.  I will also need  the turbine  
noise data for the the environmental F-1 report to be submitted to the FERC.

I had also heard that the plan was to submit the FERC application by March 
1.  The faster I receive this information, ther faster I can get started.  
Your help in a  turbine manufacturer contact would be very helpful.

Larry,

Actually, I'm going to post the draft permits and SOBs on our website.  I
think you'll have everything you need there.  If for some reason you don't
like the way that looks or prints, I will send you files.  To see an
example, go to:  http://www.epa.gov/region09/air/permit/epssdata.htm

Then click the first yellow bullet and drill down through CA and Monterey
and click on Calpine.  At the bottom of the form you will see yellow icons.
Click on the one in the field labeled "link permit conditions".

I will fax you our cover letter as soon as it's signed today.  Please
e-mail me your fax number.  Thanks.

Roger, to be sure I have all the right tools for your rough draft submittal
of the permits for compressor stations 3 and 4, please send me soemthing in
Word perfect  so that I can open and view.  I can open a PDF file so you
might want to send it that way as you suggested.  I hope that this message
isnt repetitive, as my email has been messed up and some of the stuff Ive
sent, hasnt made it to the intended person or agency.

I spoke to John Nystedt, the contact person for the Navajo Nation F&W service 
concerning the need to do endangered plants and animal  surveys at the two 
C/S on reservation lands.  I had sent to him the USGS quad sheets of the C/S 
sites for review.  Today he stated that he didnt think surveys would be 
needed at either location due to the fact that there had been historic 
disturbance at each location and that there was no sensitive habitiats in or 
near the C/S sites which would warrant surveys.  However, because of the 
issue of tribal lands, he was going to discuss this issue with the Navajo 
Nation director and verify his opinion and he would let Transwestern know on 
Monday of next week as to what the Tribes final decision would be, but he was 
almost sure that the Trib would recommend no surveys.  

John has faxed to me the list of approved botonists and boilogists which are 
approved to do work on the reservation.  I have contacted a number of 
individuals on the list and they are prepared to do the boilogical surveys 
next week  in the unlikely event a survey is required.

I received a call from the consultant who performed the archeology survey at 
stations 1 and 2.  Based upon the plot plan provided by construction, the 
archeology discovery at station 1 does not occur within the area of proposed 
impact, even though  part of the discovery is within the facility fence.  The 
report  recommendation to the SHPO by the archeologist will be that during 
construction activities in this area, an archeologist be onsite to monitor 
and ensure that the site is not impacted.  They will also recommend that we 
fence the discovery area within our facility to ensure that future pipeline 
activities will not disrupt the site.  

I have asked that two reports be prepared for each site.  One report for each 
station covering the construction areas and the other reports to include the 
entire 40 acres at each compressor station.  All four reports will be 
submitted to Bret Fritch in Omaha on Monday, the 26th of March.

Glad the conditions work for you.  Those are the only conditions I had any
question about.  We never share entire draft permits before public notice.
Occasionally, if there is a question about a specific issue, we'll share
one or two conditions.  That's what happened here.

of when the air permits would be issued by both agencies for the Redrock 
expansion.  I was surprised to find out that both agencies stated a 2-4 month 
delay prior to issuance.  They cited back log of other permits, public 
comment periods, and workload as being the main reasons.  I am particularily 
disappointed because there were pre meetings with both agencies identifying 
what was to be included in each application package, and even after the 
applications were submitted in March of this year, each agency came back and 
asked for different information that from what was discussed at each meeting.

I have a call into the state of Arizona ( construction is to begin at Station 
2 and they have jurisdiction for this station) to see if we can initiate  
some construction activities  such as laying pipe and building foundations 
prior to receiving the permit.  I have been given these types of approvals 
from other agencies in the past, but these types of approvals are extremely 
narrow and restrictive.   If this flys I am sure that they will require us to 
make sure the turbine is not brought on site until the permit has been 
issued.  I know this will require written approval from the agency, but this 
may allow us to proceed on schedule and avoid any delays.  Ill keep you 
apprised of this issue.

Dave Conway.

Summarizing the issue as I can understand them.

1. Your problem.  Cat will have to change the units at Station 2 to 3512 to 
make the driver HP for 370 kw.  As I indicated we need to also make 
adjustment so that the emissions do not exceed that of the 3508 as presented 
originally on March 21.

2. My problem.  The EPA will only allow the generators to emit a cumulative 
tonnage that works out to be 7826 running hours a year.  To get the 8736 
hours that I need the generation (at both stations) I will need to reduce 
total emissions by about 11 percent.  Obviously, in the fully loaded 
condition were at, lower horsepower is not an option.

Need some way to work these two items out to a mutually agreeable solution.  
Don't know the effect on your systems (ie: the cat engines) if a catalytic 
system is installed or if this is better then revision to the clean burn 
units (which if I recall just makes the hp worse).  

I'd also like to keep the units at 2 and 3 similar, for spare issues and 
other items, but would need to have a good idea what this is costing before I 
can approve.  

The other issue is that I need to resolve this within two days.  I be in 
Phoenix tomorrow but will leave my cell phone on.  713-850-1725.  Otherwise, 
leave a message on phone mail.  Email will not be all that great.

Appreciate your help.
Byron

Here are my comments on the Draft Permits:

1.  EPA did not include the stain tube request for sulfur monitoring.  The 
methods that are currently listed are wet chemistry methods.  As we 
discussed, since the permit allows us to use an APPROVED, alternate method, 
we will need to submit this request at some time.  For the time being, since 
we want to receive this permit ASAP we should be able to accept the permit as 
is.
2.  It is my understanding that the limits given on CO and NOx are based on 
ppm @ 15% O2 and not going to the full ISO conversion.  We may want to double 
check that with the agency.   Arnold -- Do we have guarantees from GE to back 
up these limits?
3.  The responsible official should be Dan Pribble.

http://www.epa.gov/region09/air/permit/epssdata.htm .  Click on the first 
yellow bullet and drill move down to Arizona, then click the yellow button 
for US EPA.  This will make available the files which are labeled 
Transwestern Pipeline Company Klagetoh Compressor Station and Transwestern 
Pipeline Company Luepp Compressor Station.  For each file, click on the field

Larry,

Attached is the latest version of the Red Rock Mainline Expansion
environmental report.  This should be fairly complete except for a few
pieces of information.  I have listed things I still need below.

Information Needed...
1. Dates of air permit submittals and copies of applications
2. Copies of T&E phone logs and/or written responses
3. Copy of USFS notification and/or phone log
4. Dates of cultural resource surveys, findings (verbal), date when
reports will be ready, copies of any agency responses and/or phone logs
5. Manufacture/model of new units (if different from those given to
air/noise consultants, updates will be needed)
6. Verify whether we need volume of hydro-test water

FYI Donna sent me the new plot plans via e-mail.  I took a look at those and
updated the report accordingly.  I have not heard anything regarding the
soils from the Forest Service.  Minimum checklist requirements only ask for
NRCS mapped soil data.  Scott Patti in our Ft. Collins office happened to be
speaking with one of his FERC contacts on another project and asked about
the issue of no mapped soils.  His contact indicated to him that it would
not be a problem for work within existing facilities.

I will be working remotely tomorrow, but will have access to e-mail and can
be contacted via my cell phone 919-632-6840.  Otherwise, leave me a message
and I will call you to discuss.
Hope all went well with the EPA,

Terry.

Jon and Ruth, presented below are the comments to the air perimts at 3 and 
4.  Please review for clairty and content.  I have spoken to Roger Kohn about 
all of these issues and the only one which may be a problem is with No. 2.  
He is checking on what the EPA can do about this.  I have spoken to Arnold 
Eisenstein about what we can do with the strict 25 ppmvd requriement for NOx 
and CO and he has said that we can hold to the 25 ppm value by doing some 
major gas recycling.  This is a fuel waste and costly.  Anyway, depending 
upon how long this issue delays the issuance of the permit will undoubtably 
determine whether we give in to the 25 ppmvd or hold out for 40 ppmvd.  Id 
like your comments asap.


          1.  The responsible official name change to  Danny Pribble.

                         2.. The draft permit limits NOx and CO emissions to 
25 ppmv at 15% O2, based on a 3-hour average, except during periods of 
startup   and shutdown.  At 60F and above the GE data indicates that these 
rates are achievable under all operating conditions.  However, GE   data 
indicates that NOx and CO may be as high as 40 ppmv during low-load 
conditions of 60%and lower.

 The permit application represented turbine operations at base load 80% of 
the time with reduced load operations (64% load) occurring  no more than 20% 
of the time.  The potential to emit calculations presented the emissions in 
the application in units of lb.hr and ton/yr.  These values were accepted by 
the EPA for the netting analysis, and  took were taken into account by the 
EPA (See EPA Statement  of Basis document).  Because the permit conditions 
hold us to ppmvd values and not lb/yr or ton/year values, Transwestern is   
concerned that under low load conditions of less than 60%, the emissions of 
NOx and CO would be 40 ppmvd.  Transwestern is  requesting that  a provision 
be made in the permit conditions that  emissions of NOx and CO be held to 40 
ppmvd during the 20 % of  the time that the turbines operating conditions is 
less than or equal to 60%.

3. The word "Catepillar" is mispelled throughout the permit.

4. Permit conditions for sulfur testing in the fuel gas requires Transwestern 
to use methodologies (wet chemistry technology) that are not     normally 
used to monitor and measure sulfur in the natural gas.  Transwestern has 
received approval from the EPA for other custom  fuel monitoring schedules to 
use  "GPA Standard 2377" (length of stain tube) or gas chromatography as the 
proposed methodology  to  monitor sulfur in the natural gas.

John, I read Phil's statements concerning the Redrock air permit issue and 
would like to shed some additional light concerning the reason why  
Transwestern  did not know about the delay in the agencies issance of the air 
permits.  I had met with each agency prior to submitting each application to 
ensure that each application contained the correct and proper information 
required by the EPA and State of Arizona.  When I told them that we were 
expecting the permits by the end of September, each agency indicated that a 
September permit issuance would not be a problem, in light of the fact that 
energy issues were to be given top priority in the State of Califonia.   I 
phoned the  permit engineer assigned to each application monthly to be kept 
aware of possible conflicts and resolve any concerns.  In all monthly calls, 
both agencies assured me that things were progressing on schedule.  As we 
approached the anticipated September issuance, calls to the agencies were 
conducted weekly and this was when I found out about the 1-4 month additional 
time which would be required for the permit issuance.  I dont know what else 
could have been done to track and alleviate problems encountered to ensure 
that the permits would be issued in a timely manner.

Larry,

I called Roger this morning to make sure he had received the BA.  He said
that he had not yet gotten it, but that it should be there around noon.  I
asked him to be sure to get back to me ASAP with any inadequacies, so we
could fix them immediately.  He said that they have decided that they don't
need to have all of the ESA requirements satisfied prior to Public Noticing
the project.  This is good news.  He didn't say how soon they would be able
to Notice it, but they don't have to wait for the BA to be exactly what they
want it to be, prior to.  Scott

Roger, presented below are the comments which Transwetern has on the permits 
which were issued to the Klagetoh and Luepp compressor station.  The most 
critical and sensitive issue for us is item 2 below. The permits really 
restrict us and cause us some major operational concerns if we are held to 25 
ppmvd for NOx and CO throughout the entire operating range of the turbines.  
We would really appreciate your help and assistance in this issue.  Let me 
know what additional information you may need. 


1.The responsible official name change to Danny Pribble, VP Southwest
Operations.

2.The draft permit limits NOx and CO emissions to 25 ppmv at 15% O2, based
on a 3-hour  average, except during periods of startup and shutdown.  At 60F
and above the GE data indicates that these rates are achievable under all
operating conditions.  However, GE data indicates that NOx and CO may be as 
high as 40 ppmv during low-load conditions of 60% and lower.

The permit application represented turbine operations at base load 80% of
the time with reduced load operations (64% load)occurring no more than 20%
of the time.  TWP also included a 15% safety factor to cover periods of
reduced operating loads and fluctuating ambient temperatures.  The potential
to emit calculations presented the emissions in the application in units of
lb/hr and ton/yr.  These potential to emit values were accepted by the EPA
for the netting analysis, and were taken into account by the EPA (See EPA
Statement of Basis document). Because the permit conditions hold us to ppmvd
values and not lb/yr or ton/year values, Transwestern is concerned that
under low load conditions of less than 60% and low ambient temperatures, the
emissions of NOx and CO could go as high as 40 ppmvd.  Transwestern is
requesting that a provision be made in the permit conditions that allows
emissions of NOx and CO be held to 40 ppmvd during the 20 % of the time that
the turbines operating conditions is less than or equal to 60% load.

3. The word "Catepillar" is mispelled throughout the permit.

4. Permit conditions for sulfur testing in the fuel gas requires
Transwestern to use methodologies (wet chemistry technology) that are not
normally used to monitor and       measure sulfur in the natural gas.
Transwestern has received approval from the EPA for other custom fuel
monitoring schedules to use  "GPA Standard 2377" (length of stain tube) or
gas chromatography as the proposed methodology  to  monitor sulfur in the
natural gas.

As I hope all of you have heard by now, it was a very productive meeting with 
Nancy Wrona. The creative interpretations of the DEQ rules were not necessary 
as Jerry and Nancy hammered out a very date-specific sequence for the permit 
approval activities, as well as clarifying the facility-related activities he 
can do before actual permit issueance. Likely date for permit issuance is by 
Friday, November 16, but this will depend upon EPA cooperation in shortening 
its maximum time allowed for review and assuming no substantive public 
comments. Following is first draft of "thank-you" letter to Nancy from Jerry;

Re: Transwestern Pipeline, Permits No. 1001601 & 1001602
        Schedule for Permits Issuance

Dear Ms. Wrona;

Thank you again for your significant assistance in detailing a specific 
strategy to complete the process to review and approve the two permit 
revisions for the Transwestern Pipeline compressor stations near Kingman and 
Flagstaff. We were impressed with your willingness and ability to focus on 
the practical approach to improving Arizona's air quality as promptly as 
possible. Working with you and your team of Cathy O'Connell and Prabhat 
Barghava gave our team from Enron Transportation Services and Transwestern 
Pipeline Company (TWP) a strong sense of accomplishment and cooperation.

Following is the schedule that we detailed for subsequent activities:
1. By Friday morning, October 5, Prabhat and Shudeish Mahadev will have 
completed the draft permits; on Friday afternoon, October 5, the ADEQ team, 
including Prabhat and Cathy O'Connell, will conduct the internal review and 
the TSD; by close of business, Friday, October 5, ADEQ will email the draft 
permits revisions to the TWP team (Bill Kendrick, Larry Campbell and me; our 
contact numbers and email addresses are listed on the attached sheet).

2. On Tuesday morning, October 9, at 9 am Phoenix time, there will be a 
call-in conference call between the ADEQ and the TWP teams for final review, 
negotiation, and agreement on the terms and conditions of the draft permits 
revisions.

3. By Thursday, October 11, or Friday, October 12, ADEQ will do first 
publication in the daily newspapers in Mohave and Coconino Counties of the 
30-day public comment period and 30-day notice of a public hearing (at TWP's 
request) for both permits revisions in Williams AZ. Toward meeting the 
agreed-upon permits revisions schedule, TWP hereby requests a hearing on each 
revision pursuant to R18-2-330(E) and asks that ADEQ include the required 
notices of hearing in all notices of the public's opportunity to comment 
pursuant to R18-2-330(C) and ARS sec 49-444(A). Second publication will occur 
a week later. We will research and confirm the mechanics for getting the 
notices published as soon as possible after the Tuesday, October 9 conference 
call; ADEQ will promptly prepare the form of notice, unless you wish TWP to 
do it.

4. On Tuesday, November 13, ADEQ will conduct the public hearing on the two 
permit revisions in Williams AZ. We have found nothing in the statutes or 
rules that would prevent having back-to-back hearings for the Kingman and 
Flagstaff facilities' permits revisions in the same place.

5. Promptly after the October 9 conference call that finalizes the draft 
permits revisions, ADEQ will send the drafts to EPA Region IX to commence 
EPA's review. TWP will confer with the EPA contacts to shorten the maximum 45 
days allowed so that EPA will complete its review on or before Thursday, 
November 15; EPA will promptly notify ADEQ of its approval.

6. On the assumption that neither the public hearing nor the EPA review 
generated any substantive comments that require further review, ADEQ will 
issue the permits revisions by Friday, November 16.

We recognize that the foregoing schedule will require significant cooperation 
among all parties, as well as working closely with EPA, but we are confident, 
based upon yesterday's meeting, that all of us from ADEQ and from TWP are 
committed to making this doable schedule work. The TWP team will promptly 
convey to ADEQ all materials it receives relating to the EPA permits 
revisions for the Leupp and Klagetoh facilities.

We also appreciated your clarification of the facilities-related activities 
that we can proceed with prior to final permits issuance. Specifically, since 
there will be no emissions impacts from the routine maintenance of replacing 
equipment and making the srubbers' tie-ins, TWP can proceed with those 
activities at the Kingman and Flagstaff sites. Additionally, we can proceed 
with the off-site fabrication of piping.

We also understand that, at the time of the first newspaper notices, we will 
post the appropriate signs at each facility duplicating the newspaper notices.

Again, thank you very much for your assistance in setting up the foregoing 
schedule and procedures. It is a real pleasure working together to improve 
Arizona's air quality.

Sincerely yours,

Jerry D. Martin

Jerry,
I just spoke with Steve Burr (he had been in Kingman last two days dealing 
with county air issues and town council). He was unequivocal that we could 
not construct buildings and foundations because these are "activities ... of 
a permanent nature." This phrasing is from the definition of "begin actual 
construction" (ARS 49-401.01(5)), which is not allowed for modificastion of a 
major source until the permit is issued. In our discussion last week, Steve 
was suggesting that we could do this if we had a "minor" source, but Larry 
corrected our thinking, stating  that the equipment emits more than 250 tons 
per yr NOx, which is the threshhold between "major" and "minor" source.
Our strategy now is to make sure that everyone keeps to the schedule, as set 
forth in your Sept 28 letter to Nancy. It will be especially important to 
send the EPA materials to Prabhat (copy of cover letter to Nancy and Cathy, 
copy also me) as quickly as possible and then to make sure that the meetings 
scheduled for this Friday (Oct 5) occur; let me know if I can help bird-dog 
anything.
When Sara can get me more details about the Idaho "fast-track" policy, I will 
pass this on to Steve Burr to see if there is any interest in integrating 
some of these ideas for natural gas transmission lines, which is the shortage 
problem in Arizona (current glut is built/permitted/under construction 
generation facilities).
Van

>>> <Jerry.D.Martin@enron.com> 10/2/2001 8:14:58 PM >>>
Van, were you ever able to talk to Steve Burr to clarify the extent of
acceptable pre-permit construction activities?  I still know that I heard
from Nancy that we could build "anything that doesn't have emissions," and
I'm not ready to give up yet -- still trying to mitigate the late
acquisition of the permit.  And, they pay me to worry about things that can
go wrong in construction.

Thanks,
Jerry

John, we are working out some issues with the station 1 permit and the EPA=
=20
permits for 3 and 4.  Briefly here they are.

First issue, that we did not anticipate from the ADEQ.  It applies to hours=
=20
of operation for the generator.  The ADEQ has restricted hours of operation=
=20
because we are close to the PSD levels at the facility.  In talking to=20
Shdeish, the ADEQ protects itself and applies a 10% safety factor on all=20
applications that approach PSD to ensure that the PSD levels are not=20
triggered.   This is there policy not regulation.  What is ironic is that=
=20
they accepted our calculations for the netting, but did not indicate that=
=20
they would apply any safety factor for their comfort.  Im concerned about t=
he=20
time frame to iron out this issue and the construction start date.  I need=
=20
some guidance.  Do we want to spend time fighting this, not knowing how lon=
g=20
it will take to resolve or do we bite the bullet and put on a catlytic=20
converter for the generator and have unlimited operating hours?  In speakin=
g=20
with Shudeish, I got the impressions that when an application approaches th=
e=20
PSD limit, they want to see the applicant apply CEMS or some kind of contro=
l=20
technology just to be sure that they stay under the 250 ton limit.  I know=
=20
time is of the essence.

Second issue.  The EPA has given us a pretty good permit for stations 3 and=
=20
4, but have restircted us to ppmvd values for NOx and CO, instead of lb./hr=
=20
or ton/yr.  The values that they have given us in the permit are OK (25 ppm=
vd=20
for NOx and CO) at base load operation. GE will guarantee this.   However, =
at=20
lower tempertures and at reduced loads of 60%, the manufactures numbers are=
=20
40 ppmvd for NOx and CO.  We cant live with this.  In our application, we=
=20
stated that we would be operating at low loads for 20% of the time and we=
=20
applied a 15% safety factor for the higher NOx and CO levels and presented=
=20
this in lb.hr and tons/yr.  This would have covered us, but because the=20
permits limits are in ppmvd, we would exceed  these limits during low loads=
=20
and low temps.  I have requested from Roger that we would accept permit=20
conditions that would allow us 40 ppmvd during low temps and low loads with=
=20
with requiring us to do associated recordkeeping and Roger said that he wou=
ld=20
bring this before his management.  Ill keep you apprised of this issue.

I spoke with Ken Jacobs, with the Forest Service in Flagstaff, concerning his 
agencies approval for the turbine construction at Station 2.  As a condition 
of the approval from his agency, he has requested that all the ponderosa pine 
trees to be removed for the turbine construction activities be flagged for 
identification.  After the trees have been marked, we are to then contact him 
so that he can visit the site and make an evaluation as to whether the Forest 
Service will charge us for the tree removal or whether no additional charges 
will be incurred as a result of the construction activity.  The charges will 
depend upon the calculation of how many board feet of lumber there are in the 
trees which are flagged.

As this activity is included in the time line for completion of all permits 
and approvals, please contact me when the trees have been tagged and flagged 
and I will contact Ken Jacobs so that he can make a site visit.

Larry,

Please take a look at the attached excel file for the 7400 ft elevation.  I 
have
calculated both NOx and CO at 100% and 50% load.

If the CO emissions cause a problem, I can investigate with our engineering
department to see if there is an on-engine control mechanism that can be
employed.

Let's talk after you have had a chance to review.

Best regards,

Great, Jerry. I take it then that simultaneous operation of the new and old 
is a physical impossibility. Can we take this to the next step then, to 
carefully walk through the netting calculations (Shudeish & Prabhat are doing 
this) to minimize the total emissions that can occur ("potential to emit") at 
any one time. The way I read the existing permits, however, is that allowable 
(and unenforceable bec of grandfathering?) emissions are NOx is 1428 tpy and 
CO is 429 tpy at each station, which may mean that we can not characterize 
these as "minor" sources. If the netting calculation is such that we can 
avoid New Source Review (I believe this to be the case bec there is planned 
to be a new reduction), we can do the 401.01(5) construction activities and 
try to get a fast-track permit approval.
I still do not whether, as a technical matter, the applications could qualify 
as "minor" revisions under R18-2-319.A, which mean,
1. Do not violate any applicable requirement
2. Do not involve substantive changes to existing monitoring, reporting, or 
record-keeping requirements in the permit
3. Do not require or change a case-by-case determination of an emission 
limitation or other standard, or a source-specific determination of ambient 
impacts, or a visibility or increment analysis
4. Do not seek to establish or change a permit condition for which there is 
no corresponding underlying applicable requirement and that the source has 
assumed in order to avoid an applicable requirement to which the source would 
otherwise be subject. The terms and conditions include:
     a. A federally enforceable emissions cap that the source would assume to 
avoid classification as a modification under any provision of Title I of the 
Clean Air Act; and
     b. An alternative emisssions limit approved under regulations 
promulgated under CAA sec 112(i)(5)
5. Are not modifications under and provision of Title I of the CAA
6. Are not changes in fuels not represented in the permit application or 
provided for in the permit
7. The increase in the source's potential to emit is not significant (40 tpy 
NOx, etc) [not applicable to TWP bec net reduction]
8. Are not required to processed as a significant revision under R18-2-320 
(refers to signif change in existing monitoring terms or relaxation of 
reporting/recordkeeping or "does not qualify as a minor permit revision....")
If someone could make a hard analysis of the foregoing, that might provide us 
additional strength.

Van, the 3 old units and 1 new unit at each station cannot run
simultaneously.  There is only so much gas in the line leading to each
station, and there is a limit to the discharge pressure.  If we tried to
start the new unit with the old units running, the suction pressure would
decrease significantly, and the discharge pressure would increase,
automatically shutting down all units rather quickly.  Even if it was
physically possible, we would be literally "spinning our wheels" with no
benefit - burning fuel with no increase in throughput.

I'll be happy to explain this to Ms. Wrona tomorrow.

Thanks,
Jerry

   Subject:  Red Rock/ADEQ: Nancy Wrona meeting

   I just met with Steve Burr, ADEQ Special Counsel, to discuss options and
   develop a strategy to rush the permit issuance schedule and/or allow
   significant construction to begin before actual issuance of the permit.
   He will attend the meeting tomorrow by teleconf because he thinks it
   would help if both of us attended as there are legal issues.

   He spoke with Prabhat yesterday, and both he and Prabhat believe this is
   a good project that should go forward expeditiously, but ADEQ must stick
   with its rules and policy interpretations. Nonetheless, there appears to
   be a way to re-interpret the application possibly to be a "minor"
   revision. The key will be assure that, during the construction period
   and the transition period, as well as operating procedures, all of the
   equipment that could operate at the same time does not have the
   "potential to emit" contaminants in excess of 250 tons per year (tpy).
   For the meeting with Nancy, someone, I assume it will be Larry, will
   need to be acutely familiar with the details of the permits revisions
   applications to be able to walk this through with Prabhat & Shudeish. I
   can review this as well, in order to discuss it with Steve, but we will
   need to make sure we have our technical ducks all lined up. In that
   sense, the appropriate person should please review the Ariz air rules at
   R18-2-319.A (minor revision to Class I source permit) and R18-2-401,
   definition of "major source" esp subsec c (to avoid "new source
   review"). Let me know if I need to fax these to anyone, but they may
   also be on the ADEQ website (www.adeq.state.az.us).

   For policy reasons, ADEQ needs to limit pre-permit construction because
   otherwise it would be subject to political pressure from sources with
   sunk capital costs. For TWP's purposes, the key is to keep the total
   "potential to emit" at each station below 250 tpy to avoid New Source
   Review. [I am out of my legal "depth" here and need technical
   assistance; the permit applications seem to indicate an increase in NOx
   and CO as well as a decrease in the same section (see sec 2.2 on
   Netting)as well as being subject to New Source Review (sec 3.2); there
   may some language in the applications that is somewhat misleading; the
   netting calculation is going to be important). The concern will be
   whether the old reciprocating compressors and the new turbine can all
   operate at the same time so as to result in significantly excess
   emissions. Are there operating (end enforceable) restrictions that would
   prohinbit operation of equipment that would cause emissions in excess of
   what currently allowed?

   If the permit revisions can be recharacterized as "minor," either there
   are no restrictions on immediate commencement of all contruction (only
   seven days notice required) or the allowable construction is that set
   forth in Ariz law at ARS 49-401.01(5), which would allow "installation
   of building supports and foundations, laying of underground pipework and
   construction of permanent storage structures." It appears that
   site-deliveries could occur, but I am not sure about tie-ins.

   I am somewhat skeptical that we can get a complete "minor" revision
   approach because I think this is a "major" source and the emissions
   limitations are significant. We may, with the netting, be able to avoid
   NSR and get 401.01(5) construction, but we will need technical analysis
   to be creative as to how the revisions set up the equipment changes and,
   in particular, whether we can screw down the operating procedures and
   transition to limit the "potential to emit."

   Thus, it will also be important to try to get a faster permit
   review/approval schedule. We agreed that TWP's "negotiating period" will
   be quick. EPA needs a 45-day review, but can we get submittals to EPA
   now (these revisions are essentially the same as for Stations #3 & #$,
   which EPA is about to approve) and get a faster indication of "no
   objections" from EPA?

   I sense Burr wants to help us come up with creative solutions, and I
   believe this will be Nancy's intent as well. Please let me know what
   further I can do from this end to prepare for tomorrow's meeting. I will
   have the conference room ready for a pre-meeting strategy session.

I just spoke to the state of Arizona concerning the tree removal at Station 
2.  Their response to our request to remove the trees has been APPROVED, 
provided that this is the only pre activity  we do prior to receiving the air 
permit.  This means that no other  construction or preparation activities can 
be performed  or conducted untill the air permit has been issued.   This 
approval also includes stump removal if need be......

the regulations of the air permitting, we are not allowed to initiate any 
kind of construction activity untill the air permit is received.  Cutting the 
trees could be construed as initiating construction.......

hey mike , how are you.
I should be getting a "day/date" from Earl as to when to give the Forest 
Service the date(s) for them to schedule their tree cutting.
Ken Jacobs has asked me (TW) for a date/week.  The forest service will then 
set up a crew and send them in.  Once the trees are cut, Ken will send me the 
Tree Contract and invoice for those trees.

I mentioned this to Donna Marten and Earl in last weeks conference call.

If the bottom line is being able to start critical construction activities as 
quickly as possible, rather than properly characterizing the type of permit 
revision, we have developed an argument, based on the Clean Air Act (which is 
the source for Arizona's air program), that would allow construction to 
commence shortly after notice, without the need for a permit. Of course, TWP 
has already submitted a permit revision application and would be willing to 
see this process through to completion as long as TWP could begin 
construction promptly and plan on beginning operation of the new equipment 
when the permit is finallly issued, presumably in the spring.

The argument goes as follows: under CAA sec 502(b)(10), 42 USC 7661a(b)(10),  
a state program needs to allowchanges within a permitted facility if the 
changes are not "modifications" and do not exceed the emissions allowable 
under the permit. A "modification" is defined as "any physical change in, or 
change in the method of operation of, a stationary source which increases the 
amount of any air pollutant emitted by such source or which results in the 
emission of any air pollutant not previously emitted."

 Someone should confirm the technical status of the equipment changes and 
whether they meet the criteria. This may be something to point out to Nancy 
how she can exercise her discretion to get us where we need to go. Nancy can 
give this approval after Shudeish completes his calculations confirming TWP's 
netting calculations.

Larry- Thanks for the update. I am glad that the operating hours in the 
alternative scenario for BOTH STATIONS are agreeable to Transwestern. I will 
be sending the permits to EPA review today with a request for an expedited 
review.

The public notice period starts today, so i trust that the notice signs are 
posted outside your facilities.

Shudeish, the spreadsheets look great.  I spoke to the project engineer
about an hour ago and he told me that we can live with the numbers you have
given us in the permits for Stations 1 and 2 under the alternate operating
scenerio.  He has been in Boliva for the past 2 weeks and was unavailable
for comments.  Please accept my gratitude for all the extra work and effort
you have put in on this issue of operating hour under the alternative
operating scenerio.  We are going to accept the hours as stated in the
permits.  Thanks very much

Shudeish, I spoke with Roger Kohn, Region IX EPA permit engineer, about the 
time his agency will take to do the air permit reveiw for Kingman and 
Flagstaff.  He stated that EPA normally gets the allowed 45 days to do the 
permit review, however, at the request of the state agency, his office will 
do an expidited review.  Because of the urgency of Transwetern desiring to 
initiate construction, by this email, I am asking the ADEQ to request  an 
expidited review  of the Kingman and Flagstaff air permits from the EPA.

Again, thanks for your work and effort that you have put in on this project.

This is a gentle reminder, and Im sure that most are aware, but under no 
circumstances is there to be any construction activiy initiated for the 
turbine installation at the four mainline compressor stations, until the air 
construction permits are issued by the applicable air agency.  Construction 
activity is defined, but is not limited to roads, trenching activity, 
buildings, electrical poles etc.  The state and federal agencies take a very 
dim view on initiating any attempts to initiate construction prior to 
approval.  This approval is considered to be the air permit authorizing 
construction of the proposed activity.  Your assistance in this compliance 
issue will be greatly apprecaited.   Data generation and agency consultations 
are now in progress to expidite the permit submittals.  Should you need 
further clarification, give me a call (505) 625-8022 or via e-mail.

Mr. Campbell,

Here is my review of the Kingman Class I permit.  Please review my review of
the transition period operating hour limitations.  If my logic is correct I
can't see why ADEQ would limit us to 2000 hours per engine.  Using their
numbers it appears to me that allowing us to operate 4,380 hours (as
originally requested) would not cause an exceedance in the PSD levels.

Let me know if you have any additional comments.  I'm reviewing the
Flagstaff permit now.

Larry,

I am attaching a graph that shows how the CO emissions increase exponentially
(vppm) as the turbine operating power is lowered.  The 50% base load CO levels
are between 215 and 250 vppm.

This graph also shows a wider ambient temperature range.

As stated on the phone today the 45 vppm NOx levels are achievable across the
entire operating range.

I apologize for the SI units on the graph, but I ran out of time to convert 
the
chart to imperial units, but hopefully it helps for you to understand the
concept.

Call me at home this weekend, if you need anything.

I was just informed by the Navajo Nation that prior to receiving approval 
from the agency fo rthe installation of the turbines, an archeology survey is 
to be performed at each compressor station site.  Be advised that an 
archeologist will be present at sta. 3 on 3/ 9 this friday in the am and at 
sta. 4 on 3/12 monday also in the am to conduct the required surveys.  Please 
have someone from each team present at each location during the surveys and 
allow access to the facility by the archeologist.  The survey should only 
last 3-4 hours.  

Donna, I spoke to the Navajo Nation about expiditing the report submittal 
once the archeological surveys have been completed and the Nation  said that 
under their current regulations, assuming that there are no cultural 
resources identified at either location, they are allowed 30 days to review 
the findings before they are required to issue the final report.  She didnt 
think it would take this long, but said that due to existing surveys back 
logs, and personnel, it might.  Ill keep the pressure on.

The Navajo Nation F&W has not returned my call about what they might 
require.  Birds of a feather...  Ill be persistent here also.......and let 
you know when I find out something..........

Roger, I printed the Calpine permits and everything worked fine.  Am
looking forward to seeing my permits.  Any idea as to when they will be
placed on the EPA website?  The reason I ask is that I need to travel to
Flagstaff Az and cant go untill I make copies of  the Sta 3 and 4 permit
drafts. Roswell to Flagstaff is 500 miles.
Whatever you can do will really help.

Larry,

Actually, I'm going to post the draft permits and SOBs on our website.  I
think you'll have everything you need there.  If for some reason you don't
like the way that looks or prints, I will send you files.  To see an
example, go to:  http://www.epa.gov/region09/air/permit/epssdata.htm

Then click the first yellow bullet and drill down through CA and Monterey
and click on Calpine.  At the bottom of the form you will see yellow icons.
Click on the one in the field labeled "link permit conditions".

I will fax you our cover letter as soon as it's signed today.  Please
e-mail me your fax number.  Thanks.

Roger, to be sure I have all the right tools for your rough draft submittal
of the permits for compressor stations 3 and 4, please send me soemthing in
Word perfect  so that I can open and view.  I can open a PDF file so you
might want to send it that way as you suggested.  I hope that this message
isnt repetitive, as my email has been messed up and some of the stuff Ive
sent, hasnt made it to the intended person or agency.

Bill,  the baseline noise surveys, which have been completed, were performed 
by Hoover and Keith out of Houston, Tx.  I have a meeting scheduled with the 
permit engineers from state of Arizona on Monday to discuss the permitting 
for the two C/S on state lands.  Ive dealt with these individuals before, but 
the ADEQ has gone through some reg changes and I want to visit with them on 
that.  After that meeting, I will decide who should do the applications.  I 
have  calls in to the person I deal with in the EPA in San Francisco for the 
two locations on the Navajo lands.  Pending the outcome of each  meeting, I 
will decide who to use.  Ive used Argent in the past for both Arizona permits 
and Indian lands permits, and they would probably be my first choice.    

I am keeping Mr. Ayers involved in the permitting process and all changes or 
activities that impact the permits for Arizona.  One thing that I shold 
mention is that I spoke with Phil Lowery about his desires for this project.  
He has requested that the existing units at each station maintain operations 
for six months after the turbines have been installed to act as a backup in 
the event that the turbines temporary fail or to iron out any potential 
kinks.  Based upon the reduction in emissions from the existing mainline 
units, which will be permitted for a six month period, there will still be an 
overall  major emissions decrease.  After the six month period, the existing 
units will be abandoned in place and not be operated again.    Also, my 
intent is to permit these turbines at 45 ppm NOx as opposed to the lower 25 
ppm NOx number to eleminate the problems that were originally encountered on 
the Northern Border system.  If this was a new station, I probably wouldnt be 
allowed to use the 45 number, but seeing as how there will be a major 
decrease in emissions from shutting off the recips and using the turbine, 
this should be easy to do.  The differrence in emission between 45 and 25 is 
not that great and it will allow the facilities in Az a larger range of 
operation comfort as opposed to the 25 ppm number that Rolls says they can 
do, but has had trouble reaching.  One thing that has complicated the 
permitting is the elevation and temperature extremes at the locations.  By 
permitting at 45 ppm, this will greatly help this.     Ill share the 
emissions numbers with you, when I receive them from Rolls and the emissions 
info I have from the existing units. 

I have spoken to Terry Hacket about doing the F-1 document for the FERC 
submittal, and have been feeding him data and supporting information for the 
report.  Based upon the scope of work for the turbine installation, the F-1 
report will be completed by March 1.    

Is there something Ive missed?

Approval has been given to proceed with preliminary activities to accomplish 
an expansion on the TW System on a "Fast Track".  The option which has been 
approved is Option #1 (38,000 hp turbine at Stations 1, 2 3 and 4.)  At this 
time you should prepare a Work Order authorization for $350,000 to capture 
those preliminary cost.  I assume that negotiations with a compressor 
manufacturer will result  in a requirement to commit to an order within the 
next 60 days.  Before a final order (with a cancellation schedule) can be 
executed we will need additional approval authorization.  When you have 
determined the Project Manager for this project please inform all the 
interested individuals.  We look forward to reviewing a project timeline in 
the very near future.

Larry,

I am going on vacation for two weeks - my last day will be Oct. 31,
which is a little before the end of the comment period.  I am doing
everything I can to make sure the permits are ready to issue when the
comment period ends.  You have asked about using a sulfur analyzer.
Since that is not typical practice for facilities subject to NSPS GG, I
would have to research that.  Frankly, if you want your permits ASAP,
there really isn't time for that.  Does one of the test methods in
Appendix D of Part 75, which I've pasted below, work for you?  (I know
some don't.)  Please advise so we can keep the process moving.  Thanks.

2.3.3.1.2      Use one of the following methods when using manual
sampling (as applicable to the type of gas combusted) to determine the
sulfur
content of the fuel: ASTM D1072-90, "Standard Test Method for Total
Sulfur in Fuel Gases", ASTM D4468-85 (Reapproved 1989) "Standard
Test Method for Total Sulfur in Gaseous Fuels by Hydrogenolysis and
Radiometric Colorimetry," ASTM D5504-94 "Standard Test Method for
Determination of Sulfur Compounds in Natural Gas and Gaseous Fuels by
Gas Chromatography and Chemiluminescence," or ASTM D3246-81
(Reapproved 1987) "Standard Test Method for Sulfur in Petroleum Gas By
Oxidative Microcoulometry" (incorporated by reference under
o  75.6).

Larry,

I gave the tree issue at Station 2 some thought and I have a couple of
concerns regarding the environmental report.  The report is being written,
based on the fact that all construction will occur within the station yard
and on previously disturbed ground.  If we impact areas (even within
existing facilities) that were not previously disturbed we are required to
include environmental data about those areas.

So the first question is whether the entire station yard has been
"previously disturbed".  To help determine this, I downloaded a USGS aerial
(1996) of the station from the internet and the trees occurring within the
station yard look to be the same age/size as those surrounding the station.
This would indicate that the areas within the station covered with trees
have not been "previously disturbed".  A copy of the aerial is attached.

However, it is conceivable that the site was cleared prior to initial
construction and the trees simply grew back.  Unfortunately, I don't have
that information and don't know if you do either.  And let me point out that
my concern is not whether Transwestern will receive approval to construct,
but the amount of information supplied in the report.  I want to feel
comfortable that we are supplying the required information to FERC.

For this project, that would primarily include a description of the existing
vegetation and soils (resource report 3 and 7).  All we would really need is
a brief description of the existing vegetation and soils, and how much will
be permanently impacted, etc. However, we did not budget any time to obtain
this information, nor did we anticipate the need for site visits.

My hope is that we can find an answer to whether the site was previously
disturbed or not.  If not, I hope to come up with some verbiage that
everyone is comfortable with to satisfy the FERC requirements.  Otherwise,
we will have to obtain the necessary information, and that's beyond our
initial scope.

If you have had any biological reports done for the area on other projects,
that may provide enough information.  Again, it only needs to be brief.
Also, we need to verify for the other 3 stations that we are constructing in
previously disturbed areas.

Lastly, Arnold has indicated that the hydro-test water will come from
existing water source at each station and that it will be discharged under
Transwestern's blanket permit.  Please verify...and I think we should
provide a copy of the blanket permit with the filing.

After you have had a chance to think about this, please call and we can
discuss.

Terry.

Subject: TW Comments to air permits for Stat3 and 4


Jon and Ruth, presented below are the comments to the air perimts at 3 and
4.  Please review for clairty and content.  I have spoken to Roger Kohn
about all of these issues and the only one which may be a problem is with
No. 2.  He is checking on what the EPA can do about this.  I have spoken to
Arnold Eisenstein about what we can do with the strict 25 ppmvd requriement
for NOx and CO and he has said that we can hold to the 25 ppm value by
doing some major gas recycling.  This is a fuel waste and costly.  Anyway,
depending upon how long this issue delays the issuance of the permit will
undoubtably determine whether we give in to the 25 ppmvd or hold out for 40
ppmvd.  Id like your comments asap.


              1.     The responsible official name change to  Danny
Pribble.

                         2..  The draft permit limits NOx and CO emissions
to 25 ppmv at 15% O2, based on a 3-hour average, except during periods of
startup        and shutdown.  At 60F and above the GE data indicates that
these rates are achievable under all operating conditions.  However, GE
     data indicates that NOx and CO may be as high as 40 ppmv during
low-load conditions of 60%and lower.

           The permit application represented turbine operations at base
        load 80% of the time with reduced load operations (64% load)
        occurring    no more than 20% of the time.  The potential to emit
        calculations presented the emissions in the application in units of
        lb.hr and ton/yr.      These values were accepted by the EPA for
        the netting analysis, and  took were taken into account by the EPA
        (See EPA Statement     of Basis document).  Because the permit
        conditions hold us to ppmvd values and not lb/yr or ton/year
        values, Transwestern is          concerned that under low load
        conditions of less than 60%, the emissions of NOx and CO would be
        40 ppmvd.  Transwestern is       requesting that  a provision be
        made in the permit conditions that  emissions of NOx and CO be held
        to 40 ppmvd during the 20 % of   the time that the turbines
        operating conditions is less than or equal to 60%.

        3.      The word "Catepillar" is mispelled throughout the permit.

        4.      Permit conditions for sulfur testing in the fuel gas
        requires Transwestern to use methodologies (wet chemistry
        technology) that are not         normally used to monitor and
        measure sulfur in the natural gas.  Transwestern has received
        approval from the EPA for other custom     fuel monitoring
        schedules to use  "GPA Standard 2377" (length of stain tube) or gas
        chromatography as the proposed methodology  to  monitor sulfur in
        the natural gas.

Byron,

Below is the letter I committed to provide Arnold this afternoon.  I see
that Vadim beat me to it by sending you an earlier email.  As a general
commentary, I would however, like to make the following clarifications on
the subject which ETS may find useful.

Particulate matter in the gas tubine exhaust comes from a variety of sources
and may include smoke, ash, corrosion and erosion products, condensable
hydrocarbons, inlet air particulates and particulates from the fuel and
injected water or steam when applicable.  In addition, SO3 in the exhaust is
generally trapped on a wet collection medium as H2SO4 and may appear as
particulates due to the measurement procedure.

Gas turbines are very clean burning and are not, in general, sources of
significant quantities of particulate emissions when burning good quality
fuels.  With distillate fuel containing less than 0.5% by weight, sulfur,
total particulates at high power are expected to be less than 0.6 lbs. per
1000 lb. fuel as measured by EPA Method 5.  Please note that the method used
for measuring particulate matter can have a significant impact on the
particulate level determined.  For estimating purposes, all particulates may
be considered to be in the size range less than 10 micrometers.

With pipeline quality natural gas, there is virtually no smoke and the fuel
contains no sulfur or ash.  As a result, total engine generated particulate
emissions are generally undetectable by EPA Method 5.  Due to other
particulate sources and the sensitivity of the measurement method, total
particulates with pipeline quality natural gas for the LM2500 are estimated
to be less than 3 pounds per hour assuming cleanliness levels for the inlet
air, fuel, and water/steam injection in accordance with GE requirements.

Regards, Jos,.

Byron as per the Red Rock expansion conference call today presented below are 
the emissions estimates for the auxillary engines at sta. 1-4.  Understand 
these are not actual emissions, but are emissions based upon potential to 
emit.  When these units were permitted actual testing data was not required, 
so each unit was permitted based upon an accpeted emissions limit from an EPA 
approved document.  This has worked out in our favor as the emisisons numbers 
presented in the EPA document were high, therefore, this will allow us to net 
more emissions, if needed.  Emissions are presented for a single engine only 
in tons per year, even though there are two auxillary units at each facility 
except Sta. 1 where they only have one auxillary unit.

Scott, I shold probably clearify something.  The existing right of way, which 
we intend on staying in, at least around Cordes Junction is located west of 
I-17, which will not impact the Agua Fria National Monument, which occurs on 
the east side of the interstate.  Should we be forced to move to the east 
side of I-17, then the Monument may become a problem.  Like you, I was taking 
into consideration all possible issues in the pathway of the proposed 
construction and also those that are in the near proximity and have the 
potential of becoming an "opportunity" in the event we are forced to deal 
with them.  I appreciate your wirk in this......

Subject:  ADEQ permits: public hearing


As Larry has probably reported to you by now, the public hearing last night
in Williams was accomplished with a satisfactory result. Shudeish had
copies of the draft permits, which Larry reviewed and found satisfactory.
Apparently, about three weeks ago, Prabhat Bargava left his DEQ position as
Section Manager, Compliance, to take a position with a consultant, CH2M
Hill, which is trying to start an air group in Arizona.
I just spoke with Shudeish about how soon the actual permits will be
issued. He said that DEQ had to wait a few days after the November 23 close
of the comment period (this was announced at the hearing) to allow mailed
comments postmarked on Friday, Nov 23 to reach DEQ. He then said that he
expected both permits would be issued middle to end of next week (by Nov.
30): he said he had to blend the EPA issues into the permits, but that was
not problemmatic. Larry talked with Shudeish last night about the EPA
issues, and that did not seem to be any difficulty.
I then asked Shudeish why the comment period was extended until Nov 23 when
the rule states that the comment period is only 30 days long and the
comment period opened by first publication on October 17. The public
hearing also must be no sooner than 30 days after first publication, and
that is why it was set for Nov. 19. Thus, even allowing for a couple of
days after what should have been the close of comment period (Nov 19,
because Nov 17 was a Saturday), the permits should be issued by the first
of next week rather than the end of the week. Shudeish said he would check
and get back to me.
I know this is only a couple of days difference (assuming the permits are
issued by Nov 30), but I am sensitive to Jerry's urgency to get moving
quickly, and I also want to lay some groundwork to object if actual
issuance starts dragging.
Please let me know if you have any thoughts or comments.
