Louise:

Thanks for taking some time with Jim yesterday - he needed someone else to vent with.  As you saw, the anger level is high on the floor.
With regard to the plan - I'm now waiting for the other shoe to drop (the plan number).

Regards,
Brian

Brian,

Louise has reviewed the headcount plan submitted for 2002 and asked that we reduce the Texas Origination count from 12 to 6.  The attached file shows the positions that were initially submitted.  If you will let me know what to eliminate, I will make the necessary changes.

Louise, As of today there is $722,572 in Schedule C for the TBG settlement.  The material that I provided to you showed $1mm dollars in Schedule C.  The $1mm is actually an estimate that includes payments from TBG for Sept and Oct deliveries that have not yet been received. The amount of those payments that are attributable to Schedule C is $277,428 which will bring Schedule C up to the $1mm at the time of settlement.  I am told that the value should be under "Intra, East-North, or East- Northeast or Scott Neal".  I have been assured that the $ is there.

Leaving you this message on your VM as well as email--not sure which will be more accessible.  Finally got through to Scott.  He confirms that it is Enron-specific, and that the decision is coming from Wisconsin Energy's corporate risk management/credit function.  He has been told to stop all trading activity within his purview (financial derivatives); he 'imagines' that both physical and financial are involved, although he does not know for certain.  The company is taking a wait-and-see attitude; there is no set timetable for a resumption.  

I asked for the name of a contact in their corporate risk management group (in order to ask for some more parameters regarding the situation) and was given Donna Brophy at 414-221-2749.  Scott asked me to give him time to call her for a heads-up that she might be hearing from Enron, so I agreed not to call until at least 9am Central.  Is this a call I should make, or is that not appropriate?  Please let me know.  Thanks.

Louise, as you may be aware our VNG agreement provides for an annual payment of Shared Value to Sequent Energy on November 25.  This year's payment is scheduled to be made on November 25, 2001 in the amount of $4,121,500.  Given previous discussions I felt that it was appropriate to give you a heads up on this matter.

The settlement with TBG has been completed.  We will be making a payment to TBG of $1.8 million on December 7.

New Agreement

Same term - Sept 30, 2004
Terminate oud documents and replace with Master EnFolio
Sell 12,500 MMbtu per day baseload - No swing quantites, and purchase is no longer tied to power production at TBG plant.
Enron has multiple delivery points and price protection for specific delivery location
$1.8 million payment is less then possible amount due to TBG at end of year under current contract terms under "true up" provision.

I spoke with Gregg in Chicago.  The transactions that I mentioned to you that were already in the works include 1) $40 MM storage inventory from Prime rate to current curve 2) Pre-pay for $75 to $100 MM for ENA transaction with Peoples Gas (meeting next week) 3) enovate has $20 MM with Citibank (50% Enron/50% Peoples) that we have been trying to get to Enron treasury since March of this year.

If I get the word from you, we potentially could wrap all three of these to front cash to Enron.  I would need to directly make this request to Tom and Bill or we might send a scary signal to them and require significant Enron Corporate Guarantees.

Let me know...

Louise, need to ask a question for clarification.  TBG is ready to sign.  The settlement is structured to change the transaction beginning Nov 1.  If we delay, they may revert in Nov to operating and scheduling volumes according to the existing agreement and not the settlement agreement, which is bad for ENA.  A bit of a balancing act but I think that I have it under control.  My question is this.  Can I move forward with the execution of the Settlement IF the payment is not required until Nov 30 ?  I am sorry and I may be splitting hairs, but don't want this to slip away.  If I need to hold off on everything I will do what is needed.

Below please find the opinion of ENA Legal related to the idea of adding additional language to the Transaction Agreement/(Confirm) to make it look more like a loan.  If you have any questions related thereto, please contact Stacy, Jeff Hodge &/or Travis McCullough.

If there are any other outstanding issues, especially related to the cost of funds, please contact me immediately at x37657.

Subject:	NUI Deal Documentation

Ed and Mark, 

As we discussed, I spoke to Jeff Hodge and Travis McCullough about the best way to document this deal.  We all agreed that it is better to document the deal as a deferred payment on the sale of natural gas rather than as a loan.  Documenting the deal as a loan does not add any protection for Enron and in fact, may be detrimental because of the various laws concerning loans and lenders.  The protections  and remedies afforded by the Master track those that Enron would have under a loan document.  Enron would be in no better position to collect from NUI in the event of bankruptcy under a loan document than under the Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement.  Additionally, I assume that NUI, being a regulated utility, will not want to or be able to document this deal as a loan.

Please let me know if you need additional information on this topic.

Stacy

Thank you...

Due to recent events, mixed messages are permeating on what is appropriate business protocol.  Specific to my activities I need the following clarification:

1)	Travel Limitations - Is there an unspoken move to limit travel and business expenditures?  Is this business smart (as I currently manage) or specific to Enron's current status?

2)	Strategic Asset Development - I currently have no employees committed to this group, yet my prior group is transitioning to Frank.  Do I have the continued authority to build a business which includes new employees,  new infrastructure, etc.?  If I need to wait for some specific timeline (5 - 10 days), please give me a nod.  Especially during this time, I need to be busy/head down/about business... 

I would appreciate your response.

Thanx,
Laura

In addition to my current role of leading ENA's Wholesale Gas Structuring, I have been asked to take on ENA's Retail Gas Structuring for EES.  

I have asked Mark Breese to take the lead on all EES related activity effective immediately.  Mark will maintain a lead role on a couple of important wholesale transactions that are ongoing, but he will not be taking on any new wholesale deals.  Eric Moon will retain his lead role on all West Region deals and will take the lead on all new East Region deals.  Eric Boyt will retain his lead role for all Upstream and ECR deals, and will back up Eric Moon on new East Region deals as needed.  Santiago Garcia (Associate) has chosen to stay in Gas Structuring for his third rotation to contribute his needed experience to the team.  Finally, several Associates and Analysts are being added to Gas Structuring to handle increased Wholesale deal flow and the EES effort.

Mark Breese, Melissa Solis and I have moved to the 14th floor and we will office at the following locations:

	Mark Breese	EB-1457a
	Ed McMichael	EB-1456c
	Melissa Solis	EB-1456d

We are moving to the 14th floor to initially be closer to the EES business as well as free up space on the 32nd floor.  This move is temporary as all Gas Structuring (wholesale and retail) will be located together on the 6th floor in the new building.

So...

MGU, complete utility outsourcing to ENA.  Requires all gas supply and assets are bequeathed to ENA with a gas sale to MGU.  Risks to MGU include performance risk, commission scrutiny, and assets remaining with ENA for 60-90 days in the case of ENA insolvency.  They are betting the entire reliability of their utility performance to one counterparty.  That is a big bet for any company and was managed completely through TRUST...

Peoples is different.  Keyspan is different.  Their worse case is ENA goes away and they a) have more money in the bank, b) grew their diversified earnings at a pace unachievable on their own, c) will get addicted to this new business and d) have very little to loose with their alternative being partnering with our closest competitor.  The choice for these guys is to grow or not.  They will not loose what they had before ENA.

I know our role for the unforeseeable future will be that of a broker.  Even on MGU, I am attempting to find a way to mitigate their concerns with providing a third party back stop.  On Keyspan, the play is to bring them into the PEC deal linking the Midwest and the NE.  

Originators must be optimist's and I don't like letting a deal I believe in die.  MGU will be a challenge due to the commission scrutiny I may not be able to now...  overcome.  I believe more than ever we can link counterparties together and provide the backbone of some new vehicle.  Peoples has been painful and there are still challenges ahead, but they are willing to provide financial backing for money.  They have a taste ($10 MM, 2000 and $18 MM, 2001) of this new business and do not want it to cease.

So, first, I do want to move ahead with my new role and second, really want to have Keyspan and PEC together in NY.  The NY event is 2 weeks away and Chuck, Ed and Mike have committed.  For the group, I want Russell and Deirdre McCaffrey, 1 analyst and 1 associate to see if we can get anything going.  It is an investment of around $2MM to determine if we can get an asset play working.

Please reconsider the NY trip to include Keyspan and provide me the go ahead to form this group.  The below attachment is to show, with time, focus and persistence there is always a way around (or over) all problems.

Thanx,
Laura

Subject:	FW: Enovate/WPS winter deal

It looks like we may have worked out an arrangement for the WPSC deal.  Essentially, PEC will provide the full guarantee, ENA will give PEC a reimbursement agreement for 50%, and ENA will receive 50% (25% under bankruptcy) of the deal proceeds.  In exchange, we may need to cover a small (few hundred thousand dollars) shortfall on the 25th of November.  This would most likely be accomplished by not cash settling a portion of the transactions and instead delaying payment until enovate has the cash.  I am working out the details of whether or not this is feasible.  Any questions, please let me know.  I will let you know if we hit any road bumps, but we are going to try to close this by tomorrow.

Stacy - Thank you for your excellent suggestion on documentation. Hopefully, it will pass through the rest of the PEC organization.

Subject:	Enovate/WPS winter deal

As most of you are aware, enovate has been finalizing negotiations w/
Wisconsin Public Service for a winter peaking exchange (ie the non-regulated
version of storage).  This is a 16/d, 5 day peaking deal effective only this
winter.  It generates fixed revenues of appx. $250,000, plus additional
commodity charges that are minor.  WPS will not accept a PG from Enron, and
Enron can not issue an LC for their half.  WPS will accept a PG from Peoples
for the entire amount (the entire amount is $5 MM).

Enron will provide the reimbursement agreement back to PEC.  Enron has
agreed to a 75/25 sharing on this deal, which will go to 50/50 if they are
NOT under bankruptcy.  In addition, Enron is - subject to final management
approval - going to cover a small cash shortfall that enovate anticipates
having during November due to a) a net operating loss during October, and b)
completion of the $18 million cash distribution last week (Gregg and I
inadvertently sent back too much).

While this is not an ideal arrangement we feel this is appropriate given the
nature of this deal and current credit circumstances.  At this point we are
not viewing this as a template for future deals of this nature.

Please let Gregg Penman, Roy Rodriguez or myself know if this does not work.


Thanks,

I am sure no one wants to provide another were strong and stable speech, but we have it on an extremely confidential basis that a memo is being drafted by their risk management group (remember the thorn in Bill's side and mine over the last years...) that recommends a ceasing of additional business with Enron and a review of their remedies under our agreements for significant changes in our financial capacities.  I have no idea how far Dick or Tom may let this go, but it is bad form...

Louise,

Frank departed for the day due to illness and our 2:00 p.m. meeting did not occur.  It is not my agenda to create a 3-way problem specific to a customer, yet this customer happens to be the NE in a singular bundle.   

As a mentor of sorts (I know you didn't ask for that job), I need you to tell me a 1) back off 2) re-group 3) run.  Run is my instinct, but not at the risk of jeopardizing the transaction that I believe merits an aggressive stance by Enron.  This is your business and your call.

Is their anything I can do?  I am sitting in the upper Midwest and could go see any of these clients if it would help.  People's will be reviewing their situation every 3-4 days.  Tom came out strong for us, Dick continues to be the conservative and concerned one.  I still believe a call from you to Dick is merited.  His direct number is 312/240-4300.

Let me help you where I can.  Hope your holding up...

Louise, 
Attached is the customer list.  Enovate and MW gas both roll into Laura Luce, do you wish to treat them as separate regions.  In the mean time,  I'll begin working through the changes you requested.

Louise, I ran into John and he asked for a recap on TBG.  He has some history with this account and was aware of my direction.  Bottom line - he asked that I come by tomorrow to discuss.  I am fine with your instructions to put this on hold.  I will not move to get with John until you approve.

Per conversations with Gregg and Richard, I believe it is of great importance for you and Ken Lay to place assurance phone calls to Dick Terry (312/240-4399) and Tom as one of our business partners.

I will call you shortly.

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

Louise, further to our conversation of yesterday... here is a list ( in order of priority) that I have reviewed with the Denver office.  In all cases, if Fred's group is able to make a case that the CFO truly is the financial contact, then we are prepared to leave as is.... otherwise as per Mark's note, I would like to clarify the marketing role regarding all Rockies and San Juan producers ( both physical and paper ) and transfer the primary responsibilities back to the Denver office as we had always planned.

Pls review and advise if you need anything further. 

BT

The following customers are currently covered by Fred Lagrasta's middle market desk primarily for derivative transactions.  In all cases except for Hallwood, ENA Denver has a relationship with these customers that primarily covers their physical business, we would like to expand that business to cover their Derivative business as well.  The list is based on priority.  We would be willing to cover them for their West Gas business only.  Fred could continue to cover their East, Central and Oil/Liquids business.

For the next few days, we will be reporting only positions, maturity gap, &=
 VAR for the DPR.  We expect to be reporting P&L for ENA again probably by =
the middle of next week.

The 11/30 DPR is still listed on the ERV as preliminary, as there are still=
 a couple small items outstanding.  The 12/3 and 12/4 DPRs should be out by=
 tomorrow.  We are currently experiencing some IT issues related to positio=
n reporting which have prevented the reporting of these days.  I expect the=
 issue to be resolved by the middle of the afternoon today and we will repo=
rt shortly thereafter.

If you have any questions, please call me at 713 853 9123.

Thank you,

Focus...

I believe we should get back in front of Keyspan next week, to address or redirect any questions/concerns Keyspan may have to the "general" discussions held to date.  Gil has been in communication with them several times since the meeting, but I believe Chuck needs some constant attention/adoration to move him our direction.  I would love to pop over to NY either before or after our meeting in Chicago.

Thoughts or updates?

Subject:	Gas Trading Move November 9

John has asked for a communication to go out to the gas team about the move this weekend.  Ina Rangel has been communicating with the gas team already on most of these items.

Here is a draft, please have John or Louise "bless this" before sending out.  If you already have a distribution list that includes power, it probably won't hurt for everyone to receive. 


As you are all aware, the ENA gas organization will be relocating to Enron Center South this weekend.

The new facility will be available to you at 5:00 am on Monday November 12.  Weather traders will be expected earlier and arrival time has been coordinated separately with the IT support team.  We would like for all traders to be at their new desks at least one hour earlier than usual to ensure that all applications are operating correctly prior to the start of business.

There will be members of the IT, telephony, and churn team on hand upon your arrival to assist with any problems you may encounter. They will be wearing brightly colored vests to be easily recognizable.

Thanks in advance for helping make this a smooth transition to an exciting new work environment.

John and Louise

Louise, I just received a request from Sequent Energy ( marketing arm for Atlanta Gas that owns VNG) requesting that we provide them with "representations, warranties and assurances of performance" as it relates to our VNG asset deal.  Jeff Hodge and I are formulating a response.  I do not  anticipate a problem.  A copy was accidentally forwarded to Mark Haedicke. Mark has been contacted and asked to forward his copy to me.

Well...  I am back and checking in with you.

Several things:

1)	Russell's mom passed away on Friday.  Funeral is tomorrow (Tuesday) at 4:00 p.m. in Lubbock, Texas.  I am trying to make arrangements to attend, but it doesn't look probable due to flights.

2)	I want your input on canceling the NY trip.  I appreciate your support in letting me proceed to this point.  The remaining benefit was to get everyone together with you to calm the nerves and set a course.  I understand you will not be able to attend.  It seems there is a general public belief (from PEC & Keyspan) that many Enron employees will not have a job after this week.  If they believe that, it is entirely inappropriate to be doing anything celebratory or we will be deemed as ruthless.  I want to make this call immediately.  We have only spent an incremental $500.00 in the reviving of this event.

3)	Per my e-mail on 11/16, I want to ensure that ENA retains Deirdre McCaffrey who is currently in the freight group.  Can we please move her into my group?

Louise, my expected value contribution for Q4 is $2.5 million.  This is East Gas Mid-Market and Origination combined.  This is per your request during our last meeting.

1.  Not good.  His mom was only 61 and they had just moved to a resort community outside San Antonio.  His father is very bad.  Russell broke up talking to me about him.

2.  Inappropriate to cancel or proceed?

3.  O.K.

4. O.K., I have to ensure we do not make a unilateral decision that effects Peoples choices.

5.  O.K.

Well...  I am back and checking in with you.

Several things:

1)	Russell's mom passed away on Friday.  Funeral is tomorrow (Tuesday) at 4:00 p.m. in Lubbock, Texas.  I am trying to make arrangements to attend, but it doesn't look probable due to flights.

2)	I want your input on canceling the NY trip.  I appreciate your support in letting me proceed to this point.  The remaining benefit was to get everyone together with you to calm the nerves and set a course.  I understand you will not be able to attend.  It seems there is a general public belief (from PEC & Keyspan) that many Enron employees will not have a job after this week.  If they believe that, it is entirely inappropriate to be doing anything celebratory or we will be deemed as ruthless.  I want to make this call immediately.  We have only spent an incremental $500.00 in the reviving of this event.

3)	Per my e-mail on 11/16, I want to ensure that ENA retains Deirdre McCaffrey who is currently in the freight group.  Can we please move her into my group?

4)	A small investment firm has approached us with an inquiry into enovate.  They want us to sign a confidentiality to discuss further.  Your thoughts...

Louise, I think that Laura has already passed this along but I do not want to assume anything.  Chuck Davario is leaving on vacation Wednesday of this week.  We have tentatively scheduled a meeting that would include you, the latter part of the week of October 22.  Probably on the 24th, 25th or 26th.  I know that this will need to be coordinated with your meeting with Peoples. 

In the interim, I have met with ENA Power/Asset management. We are preparing a list identifying every KeySpan activity and responsible representative.  ALL activity WILL be coordinated through me and will be focused to support this transaction.  I am attempting to schedule a meeting this week with Ed Anderson ( KeySpan, works for Chuck ) to complete an earlier Settlement negotiation.  We will continue to hold conversations with others at KeySpan during Chuck's vacation to keep all of the initiatives moving forward.  I will keep you posted.

Louise,

I appreciate your candid feedback.  

My frustration was the unproductiveness of the events of Friday and Monday.  If we could harness all the energy being utilized internally and redirect it to new business in our external markets, I believe we would have an unprecedented market advantage.   I do understand some amount of politics is "a necessary evil".  

Give me a call in Chicago if we should discuss this further.  I do not want this ordeal to reflect badly on myself or anyone else involved.  I can be reached at 312/541-1225.  I depart around noon in my return to Houston.

Subject:	Credit Issues

Rudwell - as you can probably imagine, we have had several counterparties with whom enovate has pending transactions that have initially claimed they will not accept Enron's credit as part of the transaction.  Below is a list of those counterparties to date:

Counterparty		Service				Term 					Total Value
Wisconsin Gas		10 day Storage Service			3 yrs (4/1/02 - 3/31/05)			$1,100,000
Wisconsin Gas		50 day Storage Service			3 yrs (4/1/02 - 3/31/05)			$3,375,000
Wisconsin Pub. Svc	5 day Storage Service			4 months (11/10/01 - 3/10/02)		$   240,000
TXU			Storage Service				1 yr (4/1/02 - 3/31/03)			$   990,000

We are also in the process of negotiating transactions with several other counterparties including Oneok, PG&E, and PanCanadian.  They have not yet raised credit concerns.  

It is obviously imperative that we keep business moving forward.  In that regard, what has our response been to such denials of credit?  Have we thought about posting L/C's or is that cost prohibitive?  We may have some flexibility with Peoples posting credit, but that has certain legal implications and is limited.  Also, three of the above deals do not start until April so we may have some flexibility with timing.  However, all of the above counterparties are anxious to put the contracting logistics behind them in case the deals fall through and they need to replace the service.

Any thoughts and assistance on this effort is greatly appreciated.

Gregg

Brian -

Attached is the listing of items that we have accrued but not paid as of Sept 30th.  We do have several items due to Bridgeline from Enron.  The first is that we have not received 16 months of the CES asset management payments from Enron (16 X $50,000 = $800,000) and the second is the Btu conversion adjustment to PAD gas for Aug and Sept that Jean has agreed to.  This amount is $274,000.  Net net, we owe Enron approx $226,000.

Give me a call if you want a detail explanation on any of this.

Thanks

Trevor

David Jones in East Gas Origination completed a transportation management transaction with Yankee Gas last night.  This negotiation has been ongoing but the values and the structure have, until yesterday been extremely volatile.  David was able to bring the client to the table yesterday and complete the deal.  It is only a Nov 01 - Mar 02 term but should book orig of $400,000 +.  This was not on the hotlist due to the uncertainty that had been surrounding its completion.  Yankee has worked this transaction with Engage for the past several years, it is good to get one of these coming our way.

FYI

Yankee Gas is Conneticut's largest LDC and serves 200,000 customers in 68 states.

Louise, that is fine and at the end of the day a decision to be made by Gil and the Weather Group.  Just for the record, I want you to understand that I was very candid with my conversation with Mike and did not sugar coat any of our issues.  I was not trying to lay off a problem into another group.  That being said, I was told that they felt that Gil may have some skills that would be beneficial in their group.

Louise, EGM may be interested in extending a job offer to Gil to work in the weather group.  I had a discussion with Mike McConnell and gave him my general opinion.  I may have oversold.  I will keep you posted.
In addition, Jared Kaiser is returning from EGM and will take over the lead Origination role in the Southeast as we have discussed.

Hi Laura,
I hate to keep bothering you about this, but we have to make a decision about the NY event.  The hotel needs an answer by Tuesday, October 9.  If I don't hear from you by then, I will have to proceed with canceling the room reservations.
Thanks.

I have traded several phone messages with Bill Transier (EVP, CFO @Ocean).  I expect to get some additional info at that time.  I will keep you posted.  In Bill's last voice mail he suggested that he remained interested in the upsale services activity from ENA even if we were not purchasing the gas.  I will keep you informed.

Louise,
It is my understanding that you have represented discomfort in signing the NY event expenditure approval form.  I appreciate that a "Holiday Event" or spending any amount on customer entertainment seems counter to what we all are staying awake at night contemplating about our future.  However, on our trip in NY we received positive feedback from Keyspan (even with the current events disclosed) on a JV structure and the interest to leverage a Midwest to Northeast structure.  We described that the NY event this year would be only between PEC and Keyspan and they immediately placed the date on their calendars.  Since the meeting they have each confirmed (Chuck, Ed & Mike) of their attendance.

Please remember $15,000 of this event is already fixed sunk cost and the incremental amount represents roughly $19,000.  I am continuing to work with Dori to decrease the remaining amount.

I would appreciate your consideration of providing the approval.  If not, I need to un-invite PEC and Keyspan asap.  Dori needs to act immediately to firm the numbers represented with each of the vendors.

Thanx,
Laura

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

Ed/Mark - In follow-up to our telephone conversation this am regarding NUI's ability to pay for gas purchases that they will make this summer and pay for next winter I offer you the following information regarding NUI's most recent Levelized Gas Cost Adjustment (LGAC) proceeding just concluded at the Board of Public Utilities (BPU):

	The NJ BPU ordered on March 15, 2001 the following:
		The LGAC is NUI's regulatory mechanism in which they recover all of their natural gas costs;
		NUI will increase its current gas costs from roughly $6.70 Dth to $7.20 between April 01 and July 01;
		They will be allowed  to continue to defer any underrecovered gas costs until 10/31/01, at which time they will file a "Compliance" filing with the BPU no later than 11/15/01;
		The Compliance filing will set out a three year amortization schedule to recover the underrecovered gas cost balance as of 10/31/01 and will include interest at 5.5%;
		NUI will also at that time (11/01) file a new new Levelized Gas Cost Adjustment (LGAC), if the $7.20 is not sufficient to avoid future gas cost underrecoveries;
		Although that additional increase, if needed, is not officially granted at this time it does not concern your deal because your deal is inside the test period which was approved. Secondly, the precedence has been set for recovery with interest, with this current order;
		The 1999 NJ Deregulation Act helped NUI get the carrying costs on the underrecovered balance in that it called for "full and timely" recovery of gas costs for all NJ LDC's;
		Unfortunately, the BPU has not yet issued the Order, so I cannot send it to you, however that is typical of this Board and may not be issued for some time, at which point I will forward it to you;
		It is important to note  for precedence arguments that this Order is a BPU Order of a contested case, not a settlement and applies to ALL NJ LDC's;
	
Should you wish to discuss this matter further please call me.  Note that I will be out of the office for two weeks beginning Monday and can reached through Chauncey.

Steve

Louise, 
Thanks for contacting me and giving me an opportunity to address your concerns.  Attached is the memo that I referenced regarding Louis DiCarlo.  Please note the date and the last sentence of paragraph one.  To date I have delayed moving Louis because of the MGU deal and I am currently waiting a response from Laura and Russell to discuss same.  I will follow up with you after my meeting with the larger group this afternoon to discuss next steps.

Due to the needs of the EES business, Louis has agreed to change his role and get involved in structuring retail deals.  Unfortunately, that means that he will have to relocate to 14 until we get to the new building.  His combination of ENA wholesale experience and his prior PG&E retail experience make him a very valuable asset for that effort.  Louis will retain responsibility for the MGU transaction until a logical hand-off point, which may be as late as the date MGU is closed and booked.

Kelli Little will assume the role of leading ENA (wholesale) Central Region gas structuring.  Kelli's has certainly earned this opportunity and I am confident that she will add value to the Central Region's effort.

Please join me in congratulating Louis and Kelli in their new roles.

Happy to get together on Monday to give you all detail.  Yes, you are right, there is no such thing as Schedule C or deferred account, it is cash.  The $1 mm cash in Schedule C is due back to TBG in January 2002 anyway, even if we do not restructure the deal to our favor.  The additional $800k is cash contributed by Office of the Chair (John L.) in December of 2000 to Settle December 99 and Jan 2000 with TBG.  When John gave his approval to complete this Settlement. He asked that I attempt to defer lump sum payment to December 1.  I moved that out to December 7. I will get on you calendar on Monday.

Louise, difficult week for all of us. I hope that you are doing alright given the circumstances.  

I expect to have the fully executed documents back from TBG on Monday.  We will be paying them approx. $1.8 million to settle Jan 1, 01 through Oct 01 and convert the agreement to a baseload transaction beginning Nov 1, 01. In addition it eliminates a $14mm liability.  Payment will be made from combination of Schedule C and deferred account.  Will then book between $700k and $1mm.  As you are aware, John reviewed this situation several weeks ago and gave the go-ahead. I will contact you Monday prior to execution.


Frank

Louise,

This social e-mail is from Rich Montenes who runs the entire gas control room for Keyspan.   We worked together diligently on the first year of the Brooklyn transaction and I focused on his organization as critical to daily flexibility for Enron.  We have kept in touch over the last 4 years.  As we discussed today, the MPSC (Michigan Public Service Commission) wanted to "verify" with Brooklyn our record.

As he stated from below:
I will give Enron a stunning recommendation to your potential future customer - rest assured! It's an easy thing for me because I'm very sincere about it. Our working relationship with Coral is non- existent. Nothing like Enron from my point of view.

I believe Aquila may be our competition on this deal with Coral being in the outside lane.  Kevin Fox, head of trading at Aquila, is an ex-employee of Chuck and has been spending a significant amount of time with him.  

Just an FYI... 

Laura

And the term we were both trying to remember is "stalking-horse".

That's great but I find she doesn't have much time for her old man as she's apparently knee deep in work. Sound familiar?  The good news is it's not costing me anything and I can put up with it to save $100,000.00 +.

Great news about Di - she certainly deserves to be recognized for her talents. She was lucky to have you as a mentor!

I will give Enron a stunning recommendation to your potential future customer - rest assured! It's an easy thing for me because I'm very sincere about it. Our working relationship with Coral is non- existent. Nothing like Enron from my point of view.

Yes - we still have roasted pepper pizza's nearby!

Stay well and give those 4 going on 10 babies a kiss for me.

I understand.  The money out the door is approximately $1.8mm, however we have dollars in excess of that amount reserved.  The $1.8mm will be paid out of that reserve and will not be "new" dollars.  I will keep you posted.

Thank you...

FYI... MGU turned an edited contract to us yesterday.  Two operational issues are outstanding, but we do not view either as significant.  We plan to turn executed documents early next week.  They are meeting with the MPSC either November 9th or 12th.  MGU has affirmed (Wednesday) they remain to deem Enron a credit worthy counterparty.  As with everything, we are living moment to moment with them, but I hoped I could provide you something positive.  I am brutally aware the only truly positive will be an executed agreement.

Oustanding issues:

1.  Need copy of NUI's bank revolver documentation. (Laura Falk to provide; left her a VM)
2.  Execute Master Firm Purchase & Sale Agreement - The only outstanding issue to my knowledge is the cross default threshold. I told Rudwell that we should negotiate all the relevant credit terms at one time. We need Jennifer Fornos to confirm there are no other issues.
3. Execution of NUI Corp gty for $50MM -final format sent back to NUI this afternoon.
4. Draft additional covenants required for loan structure. ( Tanya and Dave to complete once we receive the bank revolver documentation from NUI.)
5. Draft customized confirmation including #4 above as well as deleting non applicable Master language. (Stacy Dickson)
6. Complete DASH (Tanya)
7. Circulate DASH for signature
8. Execution of confirmation by ENA and NUI.


I think that's everything.  Let me know if I left anything out.

Louise, further to our meeting last week, the contracts have been executed and the Rockies transportation has been sold to CMS. Origination and trading participated in the P&L.  Orig = $ 1,045,000.  Trading approx $310,000. 

We are a little closer to our Q3 targets of $ 2MM in sept.  

Please call if there are any questions.

David Jones in East Gas Origination completed a transportation management transaction with Yankee Gas last night.  This negotiation has been ongoing but the values and the structure have, until yesterday been extremely volatile.  David was able to bring the client to the table yesterday and complete the deal.  It is only a Nov 01 - Mar 02 term but should book orig of $400,000 +.  This was not on the hotlist due to the uncertainty that had been surrounding its completion.  Yankee has worked this transaction with Engage for the past several years, it is good to get one of these coming our way.

FYI 

Frank

Yankee Gas is Conneticut's largest LDC and serves 200,000 customers in 68 states.

Greg/Dave:
 
If the opportunity presents itself at the Energy Forum, I would appreciate any discussion of the intrastate pipeline market.  Specifically, the benefits of price transparency and liquidity on the intrastate pipelines to ensure efficient movement of gas to end users.  This will become more of a factor with greater instantaneous gas demand due to the dispatch of gas-fired generation.
 
Thanks,
Brian

Both of these below trades are trades that Credit should have approved.  

However, our exposure with IP is over $21mm and we don't have a signed ISDA contract.  I think the analyst (Darren Vanek) was trying to get the attention of Craig Breslau to make it a priority to get the document finalized.  This is an ongoing discussion with Craig and we are seeing little progress.  I can't believe this would have an impact on our relationship with the customer.

The USX trade should have been approved but Darren was probably swayed by our position on an EIM prepay transaction with US Steel where we are requiring the risk to be pre-syndicated.

Darren is a young aggressive analyst which I believe is doing a good job trying to support Fred's team but with more experience will learn where to be more flexible.  

Fred's team likes to push the envelope on Credit. In isolation we will probably be okay but in the context of the growing portfolio of deals it will be increasingly harder to manage our risks.

I think this issue has already been resolved.  Let me know if you would like to discuss.
Bill

All of a sudden (and without prompting - before you ask) I am hearing a lot of noise surrounding Jay Williams and Darren Vanek (?) including a couple of transactions (small but big customers - like International Paper) where the customer is getting very upset as we have refused to do one month deals with them.  Also USX felt the same and we are persuing deals with them too.  Can you look into this for me?  It may be OK but it might be a little over zealous.


Noise from East Gas and Lagrasta's groups

Per my lengthy e-mail yesterday, I am requesting the ability to hire Deirdre McCaffrey from the freight group to my new group.  Deirdre is top 5 on any list I would compile on employees I want in any group.  Jeanie Slone is preparing Deirdre's bio for your review.  Earlier in the year she worked for Hunter and I and wanted an opportunity outside of ENA to understand new product development.  She is currently in EGM and was the trader who developed and marketed their diesel product.

So, I need to ensure you are still green lighting the strategic asset group.  I am requesting the ability to bring over Deirdre.  I would like to bring her over as a director (ask anyone - she's there) and place her under a two year contract with ENA.  She is the caliber of Mike Curry and is amazingly rounded for origination - structuring, trading and customer.  Delainey and Janet have attempted to get her in EES consistently and Ed has already approached her about a move back to structuring.  Hunter and I have spoke with Deirdre and we are both strong on the bid.

Give me your thoughts.  I want to talk to Dan (her current supervisor) quickly.  She and I have been discussing this move for the last month and for the opportunity she is ready to make this move.

Hey Louise,

How are you?  Thank you so much for your concern regarding my son.  He broke his elbow on Sunday afternoon while playing on the monkey bars.  It was quite scary, but his spirits are high again and he seems to be making the adjustment.  

It means alot to me to get messages from you regarding my family's well-being.

Thanks again for your genuine concern!!!!  You're the best!

Louise, difficult week for all of us. I hope that you are doing alright given the circumstances.  

I expect to have the fully executed documents back from TBG on Monday.  We will be paying them approx. $1.8 million to settle Jan 1, 01 through Oct 01 and convert the agreement to a baseload transaction beginning Nov 1, 01. In addition it eliminates a $14mm liability.  Payment will be made from combination of Schedule C and deferred account.  Will then book between $700k and $1mm.  As you are aware, John reviewed this situation several weeks ago and gave the go-ahead. I will contact you Monday prior to execution.


Frank

Subject:	Commodity Structuring and Year End PRC

John, 
I mentioned that I wanted to discuss the year-end PRC process as related to Commodity Structuring when I met with you in early September.  You said that the whole PRC process was being discussed/reviewed and that I should wait until November to discuss it with you.  I had intended to contact you next week to have the follow-up discussion, but Frank Vickers mentioned last week that the same (or a closely related) issue was recently discussed in one of your staff meetings and recommended that I share my thoughts with you now.  I do not know exactly what was discussed at your meeting, but the questions I want to discuss are as follows:
1.  Is Commodity Structuring properly placed on the "Commercial" table?
2.  If so, how does Commodity Structuring get equitable rankings and equitable compensation?
3.  If not, what table should Commodity Structuring be on and how should they be compensated?

I believe that the people in my group are "commercial" because the organization expects them to do the following: 
Understand and structure any commodity transaction
See the "big picture," as well as the detail
Accurately and completely identify and cost/value all parts (risks and opportunities) in commodity transactions
Develop and propose alternate deal structures 
Customer interface (with and without Originators) to field technical questions, negotiate technical issues and/or conduct due diligence
Review contracts, draft language, recommend changes and insure risk coverage therein
Collaborate with Research group to develop new models to price/value non-standard product offerings
Represent the desks in risk mitigation while negotiating with the desks to get fair/reasonable quotes
Make sure all the bases have been covered on a deal and that the deal value (including desk reserves, COF, credit, legal, etc.) matches the booking/unwind.  

In essence, everything that an Originator should do, except considerably more technical in nature, but without primary customer relationships, deal identification responsibilities and specific profit goals.  I recognize that the exceptions are very important distinctions and do not want to infer that the roles are the same.  In fact, maybe it is the exceptions that determine the distinction.  However, commodity structuring, maybe more that any other single group, is hiring, training and developing individuals that regularly transition into "true" commercial seats (origination and training) at the request of the leaders of those groups.

I would like to fully discuss and get resolution before the PRC process gets underway.  Can we meet soon?  Please advise.

Regards,
Ed

The memo attached summarizes a structured deal that the market has shown some interest.  

Essentially, this deal allows an LDC to defer payment for gas and avoid carrying costs (which may result in a dollar for dollar benefit to your customer's bottom line).  

We have done two of these deals to date.  ENA has interest in additional deals (albeit not an infinite appetite) if the structure allows us to move them off the balance sheet.

Please review the memo and target any of your customers that may have an interest.  

Each deal will require a new quote from credit and from the cost of funds group.  Gas structuring is set up to structure these deals and develop them through to execution.  

Please call me with any questions at x36751

Louise/John:

These changes are consistent with providing a strong Enron relationship at the top of the organization.  Dick will be stepping down in the next few quarters due to mandatory retirement.  Bill Morrow (our stronghold) is over all unregulated business (enovate, power, retail, etc.) and the utility gas supply function.  Don Field the new President, is over the utilities (operations, systems, etc.) and is a 2-3 year assignment until Bill Morrow reaches "seniority" i.e. his 50's.

These changes complement our objectives with PEC in the following manner 1) Upon Dick's departure, Tom wants to aggressively grow the company and imprint his direction/objectives, including taking the regulated assets into non-regulated business, M&A activity, and regaining ground on NICOR 2) Bill will now set the course for the retail business which will potentially provide Enron the ability to leverage EES via Peoples namesake in Chicago 3) Tom/Bill's legacies are directly tied to growth in the non-regulated business which were provided the $.268 of EPS from Enron business.  All other business at PEC provided negative contributions.

Please advise if you have further questions.

Peoples Energy Announces Reorganization
Moves Advance Strategy
CHICAGO, Sept. 6 /PRNewswire/ -- Following a meeting of its Board of Directors, Peoples Energy Corporation (NYSE: PGL <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=pgl&d=t> - news </n/p/pgl.html>) today announced a reorganization to advance the company's strategy to enhance utility operations while maximizing the potential of its diversified businesses. The changes are effective October 1. 
``The changes we are announcing today continue to sharpen our focus on the performance of the individual business units, as well as improve the efficiency and effectiveness of corporate functions,'' said chairman and CEO Dick Terry. 
Tom Patrick, 55, president and COO of Peoples Energy, and a director of the company, assumes the additional title of vice chairman of the company 's operating subsidiaries. 
Don Field, 51, executive vice president of Peoples Energy, was named president and COO of the company's utilities, Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas, and will report to Patrick. ``With Don Field as president, all our gas distribution functions will be brought directly under his capable oversight,'' Patrick said. 
Desiree Rogers, 42, currently chief marketing officer of Peoples Energy, was promoted to senior vice president of the corporation and its utility subsidiaries. In her new position, Rogers will lead the utilities' marketing, sales, rates and customer care operations, reporting to Field. Rogers will also continue to direct corporate marketing and communications under Patrick. 
``In her few years at Peoples Energy, Desiree Rogers has helped the firm develop a clearer understanding of the importance of a customer focused organization,'' said Patrick. ``Now she will assume direct operating responsibilities for meeting the customer needs of our business.'' 
Charles Thompson, 54, vice president, gas operations, assumes the new title of senior vice president, gas operations for Peoples Gas. Thompson will add the utility's field service operations to his existing responsibilities of distribution operations, engineering and environmental matters. ``With this move, all our Chicago field operations will be consolidated in a single unit,'' said Patrick. 
Peoples Energy also announced changes to the accounting and finance area and other support services. 
James Luebbers, currently chief financial officer and controller, becomes vice president, strategic reorganization. Luebbers, who has more than 32 years of service with the company, will retire April 1, 2002. For personal reasons, Mr. Luebbers is reducing the extent of his responsibilities but has agreed to support the company's reorganization activities until his retirement. 
``Jim Luebbers has made significant contributions during his impressive career at Peoples Energy. We profoundly appreciate his service to the company,'' Terry said. ``We will continue to benefit from his assistance with our new organization in the coming months. 
Thomas Nardi, 47, currently president of Peoples Energy Services, the company's retail energy marketer, was named chief financial officer, succeeding Luebbers. Nardi, who joined Peoples Energy one year ago, after spending 18 years at Nicor, Inc., is an industry veteran, with experience leading a variety of utility and non-utility businesses and financial functions. 
``We are confident that Tom Nardi has the broad experience, leadership skills and vision required to succeed in his new post,'' said Patrick. 
Nardi's successor at Peoples Energy Services will be announced at a later date. 
Joan Gagen, 50, vice president of customer service for the utility subsidiaries, will move to vice president and controller of Peoples Energy, reporting to Nardi. ``The growth of our multiple businesses requires commensurate focus on the control function,'' said Patrick. 
The retail subsidiary, which had reported to Patrick, will now report to William Morrow, 45, executive vice president of Peoples Energy and president of Peoples Energy Resources. With this move, Morrow assumes oversight of all the company's Midwest diversified businesses. Morrow will also retain responsibility for gas supply activities of the utilities. 
``Bill Morrow has done a superb job building our power generation and midstream services businesses into substantial income contributors,'' said Patrick. ``Putting all Midwest-based diversified energy concerns under his direction will maximize synergies.'' 
Steve Nance, 44, president of Peoples Energy Production, the company's Houston-based oil and gas production unit, will continue to report to Patrick. 
Peoples Energy also announced the consolidation of support services into a new business services unit, comprised of ITS, human resources and other administrative functions. Katherine Donofrio, 44, was promoted to senior vice president, business services to head this unit, leaving her current position as vice president, utility rates and marketing. Reporting to her will be Willard Evans, vice president, ITS and John Ibach, vice president, human resources. 
``Our new business services unit will focus on the efficiency and quality of support services provided to our business units, so they in turn can focus clearly on business operations,'' said Patrick. 
Peoples Energy is a diversified energy company comprised of five primary business segments: Gas Distribution, Power Generation, Midstream Services, Retail Energy Services, and Oil and Gas Production. The Gas Distribution business serves about 1 million retail customers in Chicago and northeastern Illinois. Visit the Peoples Energy web site at PeoplesEnergy.com .

Subject: Assignment of El Paso Transport



John, I am pleased to report that West Gas Orig has completed the permanent assignment of approx 47,000 MMBtu/day of El Paso Transport to Public Service of New Mexico. This capacity was assigned with varying start dates. late 02 and early 03, with no credit risk associated with this transaction as a condition of the assignment was an unconditional release of ENA.  ENA assigned this capacity at max rate ( which meets all FERC policy issues)and we were able to generate $3.0 MM of incremental value which was granted to Stephanie Miller from Mike Grigsby.  

In addition to the MTM of approx $ 3MM, this transaction reinforces the good working relationship between trading and marketing and may enhance ENA's trading position by removing some of the risks associated with this pipe. These risks include, flow rate risk, demand charge tariff changes, receipt point pool allocation risks, and potential MTM erosion and of course FERC/regulatory pressures.

Our work is nowhere near complete on this as we continue to create structures and discussion around the 200,000/day which is a little more complicated to shed. In the meantime our group continues to promote the placement of the remaining capacity either through other producers or generators and we anticipate the assignment of another  small package early next week. 

Thanks to those who helped out in this effort, including legal, regulatory, risk, structuring, trading and my origination team !!!    

regards, BT

Louise, I know that you are dealing with more important things now but I wanted to keep you up to speed on TBG and VNG as I continue to move them forward.

Have completed negotiations on TBG.  Plan to forward execution documents on Monday.  Upon TBG's execution I will determine if we want to move forward , delay or terminate the opportunity. I will get with you on this.
I have negotiated a $2 million payment from Sequent to terminate the Asset transaction 1 year early.  Traders believe this is strong value and are willing to transact at that value.  Waiting on formal/written offer from Sequent to complete evaluation.
  
Will keep you posted on these opportunities.
I hope that you are doing alright given the circumstances

ment and support functions." =20

Everyone deserves credit and should take pride in the overall findings of t=
he audit, particularly given the complexity of enovate and our sometimes li=
mited resources.  Also, thank you for your patience and accommodations of t=
he audit team throughout the process. =20

However, like all audits there are certain items which need to be addressed=
, clarified or improved.  We have set a timeline to address each one of the=
 findings and provide an appropriate response to the audit team.  As such, =
a few of you will be requested to provide additional assistance in the near=
 future.  I will be contacting those individuals separately to discuss the =
necessary follow up.

Thanks - Gregg

I have spoke with Tammie several times trying to get Russell, you and I together prior to his departure.  It has been my understanding that you are behind closed door meetings.  I wanted him to give you his take on today's events.

Please respond if you can still meet.  We are here on 32 and it is 6:09 p.m.  Hoping to catch you on your Blackberry.

Laura

The analysts continue to give positive marks to Peoples Energy in their Enron venture, enovate.  I have attached the latest Goldman report and highlighted the related commentary.

Year to date for PEC, October 1, 2000 thru present, Peoples has realized $10.5 MM specific to enovate.  

Thanx,
Laura
