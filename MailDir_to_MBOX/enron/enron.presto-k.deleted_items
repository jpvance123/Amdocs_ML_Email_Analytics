Should we request the LT-Option book to be attached to Andy Zipper?  Any other books needed for him?  Will he be allowed to trade all regions?

Thanks,
Stacey

We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are in the final stages of completion including:-

+	Infrastructure		Jenny Rub
+	Development		Jay Webb
+	EnronOnline		Webb / Forster
+	HR			David Oxley
+	Cash Management	Tom Myers
+	Credit			Debbie Brackett

The rest will be completed shortly.

We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans "Re-start/Integration"  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.

Customer Side	
+	Customers		Phase  1 - First Week (eg top 10)
				Phase  2 - First Month (eg top 50)
				Phase  3 - First Quarter (eg top 100)
+	Action Plan		Phase  1 Customers
				Phase  2 Customers
				Phase  3 Customers
+	Contracts by customers (pre-prepared with credit terms etc)
+	Customer visit schedule

Product Side
+	List of Products	Phase 1 - First Week
				Phase 2 - First Month
				Phase 3 - First Quarter

Target Number of Transactions
+	Phase 1
+	Phase 2
+	Phase 3

Kevin,

I have worked with this guy at EBS for the past year and think he is a good candidate for the group.  He has worked for Marcello Romano (he has a favorable view of him also).  He traded oil products at Goldman a few years back and is interested in coming to the U.S. from our London office.  

Let me know what you think.  Perhaps Louise can weigh in also if she knows him.  

John

It has come to my attention recently that some people want to take to UBSW customer data from EPMI.  We need to be cautious on what type of data is transferred.  Can everyone let me know what will be transferred by their teams so we can vet with FERC counsel.

Thanks.

AEP asked the Texas PUC to postpone opening the Texas (outside of ERCOT) re=
tail market because there is no centralized dispatch (per Ron M's testimony=
 on behalf on AEP).  After talking with our SPP folks (I understand that EP=
MI has bid to serve a portion of Entergy's load) , Jim's testimony is that =
the outside of ERCOT Texas market should open 1/1/02 and that other states =
have implemented retail open access without a centralized dispatch model (f=
or example, AEP in Ohio, ComEd in Ilinois and Duquense in ECAR/PA).  Jim st=
ates that while RTOs and central dispatch will certainly facilitate the mar=
ket, it is not absolutely required, and that, if AEP thinks that the retail=
 market will not be competitive without it, then, perhaps, REPS other than =
AEP should be the only ones allowed to serve retail load in this part of Te=
xas until central dispatch is in place.  In addition, he states that the im=
balance provisions should be changed and that network firm capacity should =
be available to REPs (without the need for protracted system impact studies=
, since the load is already being served.)

Apparently, Entergy has also changed its mind and now is opposing the 1/1/0=
2 opening of the Entergy/Texas retail market.

Attached is another revision to the EIA-411 reporting forms. Revisions include:
 
- For purchases and sales sheets, several people had requested a place to put the name of the other party. A column has been added to allow for that input.
- The reports have been revised to calculate the net capacity at a company level (previously, the sales and purchases calculation was to be done at the final review)
 
There are no major changes to the data input worksheets. If you've already started updating the previous revision, it isn't necessary to re-enter your data into this worksheet.

If you go out to the NRC website now, you will find this message posted:

"Our site is not operational at this time. In the aftermath of the terrorist
attacks of September 11, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has taken the
action to shut down its web site. In support of our mission to protect
public health and safety, we are performing a review of all material on our
site. We appreciate your patience and understanding during these difficult
times."

What this means for today is that we will be unable to provide a normal
Daily Recap Report since our analysis is based on the current day's status
of operation for the plants.  We will, however, attempt to organize our
contacts so that we can simulate a regular reporting of plant status and
produce an analysis and projection from that.

We anticipate that the NRC website will be operational again next week and
will hopefully be back to normal as far as our interface with it.

We will keep you posted on any additional developments.

Dan

Lloyd and Tim H,   There is still some question about the amount and timing of fundamentals capability that will be required in the Enron Estate.  To date, our working assumption has been that all fundamentals systems (data harvesting, portals, metastock, decision support cubes, etc...) would only be operational in NetCo.  There is no IT staffing in estate to support fundamentals.

Beth Perlman told me today that Jim Fallon has indicated that we need to have IT people in estate who have the ability to bring up our fundamentals capability for the East and West Desks.

A few questions...  Do you agree?  If so, I can have our East Desk fundamentals team begin knowledge transfer to estate IT personnel.  I'll work with Beth on candidates.  Can this requirement be met for West Desk fundamentals?  If so, how would we proceed?  Who would be involved?

Thanks,  Steve

The Austin Group Energy, L.P.
Monthly Newsletter

Let's describe a typical and recurring nightmare for generating unit
operators. It's noon on August 15, temperatures have reached the upper 90s
all week; you're well into your reserve margin to serve native load, when a
unit trips off line. Do you scramble to find replacement power at record
high prices and worry about the consequences later? Or, have you prepared
for this event?

When the degree of risk has not been quantified, fear of the unknown can
lead to restless nights, and understandably so. The financial implications
can be astounding when a unit outage occurs during a period of high spikes
in market prices.

How does this relate to the recruitment and hiring of talent within your
shop? Allow me to bring the story together. What would you do if your top
employee came to you and said, "You've been great to me and I've learned
alot, but I just accepted a job at your level right down the road and they
like me so much they want me to start tomorrow." Do you spring into 911 mode
or are you ready for this day.

Start a relationship today with The Austin Group Energy. We will keep you
aware of all available talent in your market area. These candidates are
currently employed and do not answer ads. They stay in touch with
opportunities through us to ensure confidentiality. Why would Top 5
marketing companies pay us for the recruitment and placement of over 400
successful hires when they could hire them on their own. The smart and
proactive companies understand how to outpace the pack when it comes to
hiring talent, they call The Austin Group Energy.

	1)  June-Sep'02, 20MW, 5x16
	2) Cal'02, 20MW, 5x16

We need the hourly option to allow for non-GTC sources, but we will deliver into-GTC border hourly.

TEA will let us go hourly 5 times per month and change the source if we go hourly, as long as the source remains a unit on the Ga-ITS.  However, he doesn't want a full 50MW block in the June-Sept period, just 40MW.  The 40MW is actually already at the high end of his range (needs 30-40MW for June-Sep).

Will he let us go hourly at least 5 times per month and change the source if we go hourly.   This essentially would require they provide parking and lending for up 20 MW in the Cal and 40 MW in the June-Sept.   Can we at least get a 50 MW block in the June-Sept period?

An offer from any Scherer unit(s) would work.  He understands the odd lot will demand a premium, but I can't talk him into a round 50MW.  So, 2 pieces of energy: 
	1)  June-Sep'02, 20MW, 5x16
	2) Cal'02, 20MW, 5x16

Ask him if Scherer 1,2,3 and/or 4 would work?   Let him know that an odd lot would command a $2.50-3.00/Mwh premium on top   In addition, even if we used Scherer, it would be from any one of the facilities therefore the transmission would need to be able to use any of the Scherer units as a source.

TEA is looking to buy 20MW, 5x16, June-Sep'02, into MEAG.  Also looking to buy 20MW, 5x16, Cal'02, into MEAG.  I told them we may be more willing to offer into GTC.  His response was he would need to know which facility or interface would be the source (I suspect this is so he can reserve ahead to use his network transmission).  

Any interest?

UBS Legal and UBS Credit is heading to Houston this Thursday and Friday.  I have asked that ERCOT matters get 1 hour to discuss the necessary contracts that UBS will need to sign to participate in the ERCOT market.

Basically, my understanding is the following --

1.	PUCT Registration Form for Power Marketer
2.	ERCOT ISO Information
	QSE
	LSE
	Wholesale Enabling Agreement
	Other
3.	APX Agreement?
4.	Other

Given the list of issues, this assumes that UBSW Energy will not be selling electricity at retail.  If we need this for Day 1, we would have to get an additional license from the PUCT.

Thanks,

Jim

All,

Louise has asked me to coordinate across all departments on the Enron side for the integration with UBS and to be the point contact for the person who is leading the UBS side of the integration.

Accordingly, please send me your launch timetable and top issues lists.

Thanks,

We've updated the Merger Q&A document on our Enron Updates site ( <http://home.enron.com/updates/mergerQA.html>), as a result of the many questions you've had concerning the merger between Enron and Dynegy. Questions addressed include those about Enron stock options, benefits and immigration status. Please stay tuned for additional updates.

Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

After our recent Re-start meeting and the associated planning, there has been significant e-mail activity about what appears to be different points of contact into the different Pools and Transmission Providers.

I would recommend that Netco anoint a Primary Point of Contact with each Pool and Transmission Provider and that person have the resources of Legal, Govt Affairs, Commercial, Credit, etc.  The Primary Point of Contact would initiate and lead all discussions with the counterparty to expedite the agreement.

For the Pools, I think that Govt Affairs should be the Primary Point of Contact.

ISO-NE 	=	Christi Nicolay
NY-ISO		=	Christi Nicolay
PJM		=	Jim Steffes
ERCOT		=	Charles Yeung
MISO		=	Sarah Novosel
SPP		=	Christi Nicolay
CAISO		=	Alan Comnes (although Steve Hall is already working on this and should not be displaced).

For the individual Transmission Providers, I think that the Real-Time Desk/Logistics should be the Primary Point of Contact.

Does anyone see any issues with this proposal?  I am concerned that Netco may be taking multiple positions with the same provider and that could lead to delay.

Thanks.

Why can't we use AEP's position against them in their own backyard (Ohio). =
  AEP's position is that you can't have effective retail markets without re=

Can we use their own testimony against them?

AEP asked the Texas PUC to postpone opening the Texas (outside of ERCOT) re=

 on behalf on AEP).  After talking with our SPP folks (I understand that EP=

the outside of ERCOT Texas market should open 1/1/02 and that other states =
have implemented retail open access without a centralized dispatch model (f=
or example, AEP in Ohio, ComEd in Ilinois and Duquense in ECAR/PA).  Jim st=
ates that while RTOs and central dispatch will certainly facilitate the mar=
ket, it is not absolutely required, and that, if AEP thinks that the retail=
 market will not be competitive without it, then, perhaps, REPS other than =
AEP should be the only ones allowed to serve retail load in this part of Te=
xas until central dispatch is in place.  In addition, he states that the im=
balance provisions should be changed and that network firm capacity should =
be available to REPs (without the need for protracted system impact studies=
, since the load is already being served.)

Apparently, Entergy has also changed its mind and now is opposing the 1/1/0=
2 opening of the Entergy/Texas retail market.

Today was the first day of FERC's "RTO Week" in Washington, D.C.  The topic of today's panel was "RTO Markets and Design:  Required Markets and Optional Markets."  The issues in both panels were quickly merged and the two panels discussed all of the issues.  

Panel One:  Mandatory RTO Markets

The morning panel consisted of the following participants:  Peter Cramton (University of Maryland), David Hadley (Indiana PSC), Mark Kleinginna (Ormet), John Meyer (Reliant), John O'Neal (Mirant), and Roy Shanker (consultant for generators in the Northeast).  

Energy Spot Market

There was unanimous agreement among these panelists that the RTO must run a real time energy, or spot, market.  Most panelists agreed that the spot market should be a bid-based, security-constrained system with economic dispatch.  In response to a question from Pat Wood, most also agreed that nodal (LMP) pricing should be used in the spot market, although John Meyer from Reliant stated that zonal pricing is used in ERCOT and that works also.  

Day Ahead Market and Balanced Versus Unbalanced Schedules

Most of the panelists said that the RTO should not require balanced schedules.  Peter Cramton said that with a day-ahead market, no need for balanced schedules because the real time market prices will discipline behavior.  John Meyer agrees, saying if there is no balanced schedules requirement, then there might be a need for a day-ahead market.  John notes that ERCOT has a balanced schedule requirement.  John also said that imbalance penalties could be appropriate for imbalances that hurt the system.   Roy Shanker also said FERC needs either a balanced schedules requirement (which he does not recommend) or have a day-ahead market.

ICAP Requirement

Most of the panelists (except Peter Cramton -- University of MD) support an ICAP requirement.  However, none of the panelists could point to an effective ICAP market (Roy Shanker says he has an idea of what would work - we will probably see this in comments in the ICAP proceeding due later this week).  

Mark from Ormet kept bringing the message back to the need to know the rules and know that the rules will not change substantially over time.  Mark said liquidity in PJM does not help him move power to the Midwest since the rules are undefined outside of PJM.  He cannot enter into long-term contracts because he does not know what the rules will be one or more years out.  He also said you can have an ICAP market but market participants have to be able to meet ICAP requirements through load response.

 Standardized Markets

 Most of the panelists agreed that the mandatory markets should be real time and day-ahead energy markets, spinning and non-spinning reserves and regulation should also be required and be standardized.

Massey asked if the costs to standardize are outweighed by the benefits.  Roy Shanker said the Northeast works so FERC should not change it.  Even if FERC does not require standardization between the RTOs, creating large RTOs and fixing the problems within the RTOs will be a big improvement.  Mark with Ormet and the Indiana Commissioner both urged FERC to standardize the mandatory markets among the RTOs.

Panel Two:  Optional RTO Markets

The afternoon panel consisted of the following participants:  Fiona Woolfe (lawyer with experience in England and Wales pool); Roy Thilly (Wisconsin Public Power Inc.); Richard Pierce (professor at George Washington); Glen Arthur (Connecticut PSC); Steve Naumann (Commonwealth Edison); Ed Cazalet (APX).

This panel was intended to cover optional market issues, including whether a day-ahead market is needed and whether there should be ICAP markets.  This panel addressed these issues as well as the need for a real time market, market monitoring, and other issues.

Mandatory Markets

Other than Ed Cazalet (APX), the other panelists for the most part agree that the RTO should run a real time and day-ahead energy market, ancillary services markets, and there must be an ICAP requirement.  Ed Cazalet believes that there only needs to be a small balancing market (perhaps with balanced schedules requirements) and leave the creation of any other markets to independent entities to create.

 ICAP

 Most of the panelists believe that the RTO should provide a day-ahead market, congestion management and ancillary services.  Most also favor an ICAP requirement and market.

Pat Wood said he is not convinced that a blanket ICAP requirement is needed on Day One.  He has been considering an ICAP requirement that does not apply until triggers are reached, and perhaps that should be considered here as well.  He has also been talking with a Northeast regulator about having different requirements for states depending on whether they have retail access or not.

Shelton Cannon (Staff) asked the panelists to assume one Midwest RTO - can there be different ICAP requirements within the RTO?  Most panelists agree that if the ICAP rules are the same within the RTO, that there could be percentage requirement deviations.

Day Two of RTO Week focuses on Congestion Management in the morning and Transmission Planning and Expansion in the afternoon.  We will get summaries out on these panels tomorrow.

Please call me with questions or comments.

Sarah

The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

I think this is the right direction.  What's the timing?  I think Berney is absolutely the right person for this job.  If it can wait, I'd like to put it on the agenda for this Thursday.

I would support this 100%.   It is consistent with the direction that Whalley, Lavo, and Delainey are headed with the retail risk management group.

Kevin & Tim:

Last week I spoke to Janet about the probable departure of Sean Holmes from EES Deal Management to EES Europe.  Janet discussed several alternatives for Deal Management and asked for my suggestions.  My suggestion is as follows:

Berney Aucoin would assume oversight of all Retail Power Structurning and Deal Management activities.  Initially, keep Deal Management separate under Deb Merrill's direction and Structuring under Edith's direction.  DSM, LC, DG would probably need to fall under Berney as well.  I would anticipate that the functional separation that currently exists between Deal Managment and Structuring would begin to go away over the next 3 - 6 months as we intersperse our more experienced people and everyone in general gets up the curve.  Thus, I would expect that we could merge Deal Managemnt and Strcuturing into one group in the near future.

I spoke to Berney and he thinks this makes sense and is up for the job.  Edith is still planning to move into a commercial Origination role at year end but I believe we could have a replacement by then.

Janet and the EES group have definitely bought into this idea - I think they would like to implement.  Janet would expect dual reporting of the Group (to EES and EWS) and I indicated that, if implemented, I did not see a problem and as far as I was concerned nothing would change - Berney reiterated this directly.

I apoloigize if you are reading this feeling as though I have taken the liberty to suggest material changes without getting full buy-in, but 1) things aren't done and 2) I wanted to suggest something that I felt made sense before some alternative plan was proposed and in execution mode.

Please let me know what you think and whether you feel Lavo would have any problems.

Thanks,
Rogers

I agree with the delegation except for Chris Dorland.   Tim Belden needs to determine who validates the West Power curves.   With respect to vol curves, Steve Wang and Rob Stalford need to validate.
 
What time period are we validating?

I think it is appropriate to instruct Risk to put the charges associated with the PJM scalar in the Change Deal Bucket as this was out of the Retail Commodity Group's control.  I am trying to hold these guys accountable for positions, p/l and such and I think this is the only way to fairly account for results that they could affect vs. someone else's error/mismark.  Let me know if you think this is appropriate.

I have sent the message again to make curves as accurate as possible through 2015.    We are doing are best.   The Entergy situation was simply a back office mistake.   The NY off-peak is a work in progress and will get better every day.   The legs never trade, only the cals, therefore, we have to use common sense for month values.

Thanks for the info.   In most cases, Narsima is exactly right.

Subject:	Curve Changes

Here are the significant (non market related) curve changes that have effected our P&L in the last week...and also a working issue related with curve management.

PJM East Hub: 
   Summary : Hourly Scalars for East hub were changed, resulting in a ($2.3 million) loss.
   Reasons : Rob Benson had changed the West hub scalars a few months ago and those scalar changes never got transfered over to the East Hub curves. When the curve management function was moved from excel into the Enpower Curve Management system all the curves derived as a basis off West Hub curves started using the West Hub Scalars. 

Entergy Back End:
  Summary : Yesterday, Entergy 05 and beyond curves moved down in the range of $0.50/MWh to $1.65/MWh resulting in a loss of approximately $2.3million (held back because Mike Carson is fixing the curves today)

NY Curves:
  Summary : The onpeak and offpeak curves for NY Zones A, G and J require a thorough clean up especially with regards to the issues that are stated below. The P&L is still to be determined because curves have not been changed.


On Peak
1.  J-G Spread is marked over G-A Spread starting in Year 2009.
2.  J-A Spread blows up year on year, starting in Year 2005.

Offpeak
1.  Zone-G is marked above Zone-J half of the time;  occuring mostly in Q1, Q4 and Aug.
2.  Zone-A is marked above Zone-J every July in 2003-2006.  With the exception of 2002, for the month of July, Zone-A is marginally marked below Zone-J.
3.  Zone-A is marked above Zone-G for every July from 2003 to 2018 and Dec 2003.
4.  Zone-A, for every year, MarApr is over MayJun by a significant amount.

Attached is the most recent termination log for EPMI counterparties.  I believe the only change from the last list is the addition of the City of Mesa.

Starting tomorrow, 11/28/01 we will be included with the Gas Breakfast and Lunches.  However, there will be a cost of $5.00 each or $10.00 total when breakfast is provided.  They will have lunch everyday and breakfast only three days of the month, which will be during bid week.  

I will come around every morning and collect your money...I will then have to provide a list to the Gas people who will be checking your name off as you enter the breakfast/lunch line.  

Please let me know if you have any questions.  

REMEMBER...ONLY THOSE WHO GIVE THE $5.00 WILL BE EATING.

Thanks for your cooperation,

Here are the office locations that Louise has assigned: 

Calger  06105 
Presto  06103 
Shively 06102 

T Jae, it was decided today that legal will move over here this weekend.  Can you please arrange for Kevin's things to be boxed up so legal can move in downstairs over the weekend.

Ina, if there are any of John Arnold's personal effects left on 5 can you please have them boxed up? 

If we can hold off until next week to set the new offices up I'm sure that Darren and David would be very grateful! 

Thanks for your help!

Kevin,

As we discussed, TECO is offering up to 500MW (of a total 960MW) beginning 5/1/04 off the Gannon facility (which is being converted from coal to a gas-fired CC plant, called Bayside).  The plant is in Tampa, FL and the offering is unit-contingent.  

TECO prefers to sell a toll where we bring the gas, but is open to other proposals.  I figure we can bid for any of a few structures: 1) toll where we bring the gas, 2) toll indexed to a gas hub, where TECO is respons. for gas supply, 3) fixed price call.  

I think an at the money call would be the cleanest solution (avoid inefficiency's associated with the heat rate curve which varies by MW amount utilized, gas supply risk, etc.).

What is your preferred structure?  How many MW would you like to show a bid for?  Structuring ran an initial valuation for a 3-year, $35 daily call, 100MW.  Results are below.

Kevin,

I spoke with the lawyer representing Entergy, and he indicated that their intention is to provide redacted bid information to the PUC under a protective order.  Excluded from their submittal will be any identifying information about each of the bidders. Their lawyer said that Enron's bid sheet (without identifying info) and contract comments (with no identifying info) would be submitted. Obviously, pricing info will be included.  In order to acquire the filed information, someone must qualify as a "Party" and must agree to be bound by the terms of the protective order.  Heather tells me Christi Nicolay was looking into the definition of "Party".  I do not know if our competitors could qualify as Parties, but if they do, then common sense tells me that we should, too. At this point we should assume that they will get the redacted information.

Seems like Entergy is doing what they can to protect the info, and our only choice I can think of would be to withdraw our bid.  Heather tells me we want to go forward.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Kay

I can be reached on my cell in Florida.   In addition, you can leave messages with the hotel voice mail (I am staying at Ritz Carlton on Key Biscayne).
 
I will also be checking e-mail at least once per day.

Thursday Morning session----Meeting with State Commissioners


This session was generally known to be the occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at FERC taking action without including them in the decision making process.  Although the panel notice showed that 5 state commissioners would attend, upon arriving in the hearing room we found that 27 state commissioners were there and ready to claim their 15 minutes of fame.  It was a long morning!  I will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts. 

Approximately 35 to 40% of the commenters were supportive of FERC and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts.  Most of these comments came from the Midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support.  Everyone else was fairly verbal against FERC, primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process, that FERC was moving too quickly, and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens.  In particular, the commissioners from Maryland and North Carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric. While many would think that the session was extremely negative (our friend Sarah Novosel thought it was disgusting!) in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearing--allowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis.

Here's some individual comments:

Catherine Riley/Maryland---she started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the MAryland commission and immediately implied that FERC was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens (she was way overboard in the dramatics department).  She then stated that she was not at the meeting to "help you (FERC) backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record".  It went on like this for about 15 minutes.  The good part is that she was so personally negative, that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her.

Sam Ervin/NOrth Carolina---he was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens, that customer choice is never coming to his state, so he will never benefit from an RTO, that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an RTO (and I bet if they do, he'll work to change the statutes!) and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of FERC. His comments were also pretty brutal, but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor.

Arnetta McRae/Delware---she kept on saying "show me" where the benefits for consumers are.  She also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order.  

Rory McMinn/New Mexico---repeatedly talked about how the west was different, how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers, how the FERC commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were. 

Carl Wood/California--tried to portray himself and California as representing the west as a whole, and even brought along a statement from the Washington commission echoeing his comments. He delivered the same messages that we've been hearing forever---FERC should have acted sooner on price caps, etc etc.

Glen Thomas/Pennsylvania---he was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring it's energy system into the new century...that by opening it's markets they have had an explosion in green power, they have reduced costs all across the state, etc. He was very supportive of PJM (makes sense because it's in his back yard) and stated that for any RTO to be effective it must have independent governance.  

Judy Jones/Ohio---was very parochial in her discussion, but echoed Don Svanda's comments from earlier in the week that one RTO for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the FERC to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed.

Ed GArvey/Minnesota---he got the gold star for the day.  After very very lengthly comments from about 15 commissioners, he took about 1 minute and said "FERC--just get it done"....in essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward.

Other Commissioners who talked were:  Arthur/Connecticut, Hadley/Indiana, Huelsman/Kentucky, Nugent/ Maine  all on the positive side.  Other negative commentors were two guys from DC and Jim Irvin from Arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do.


>From the FERC commissioner standpoint, the gold star went to Massey.  After hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didn't feel that they had been included and that FERC had not consulted them enough, he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back, saying the "there has been 7 years of process, and he wants a process that comes to an end....you've been talking for 7 years and never could agree..."


Call me if I can provide any further insights into the individual comments or the tenor of the meeting.  Sue.  #612-339-4599

Kevin,

If you are okay with it I would like to take tomorrow and Monday off?  Your schedule is open so let me know what you think.  

Also, I am getting a cost for Doug Gilbert-Smith to take the four traders and their spouses to Barton Creek, so I will keep you posted on that as well.  On that same note, the Scheduling Group and I will be leaving next Friday, Oct. 26th to Cancun and we will be back in the office on Oct. 29th.  Remember to keep me posted about the San Antonio deal for the VP's.

One last thing...would you be available to do a lunch meeting in your office on Tues. at 11:30am with Dave Duran, Tina Rode and myself?  We would like to get yours and Dave's impute on some future things for the girls, Tina and myself.

Thanks again,

T.Jae

I understand from Smith Day that APX forwarded us today a format of contract relating to their potentially serving as QSE for UBS AG trading.  APX is apparently willing to contract on a month-to-month basis (thus allowing us to move to our own IT interface with ERCOT as soon as possible).  

As to item two below, until UBS would have the IT capability (currently under development and projected to be roughly a month from completion) to become certified to act as its own QSE, it would not need to execute any 'market participant' agreement with ERCOT in order to be a power marketer within ERCOT.  As soon as UBS desired to trade Renewable Energy Credits ("RECs"), it would need to sign a standard-form agreement with ERCOT in order to maintain a REC account. 

Trading conducted by UBS with any given counterparty within ERCOT would be pursuant to 'UBSWarburgEnergyOnline' GTCs or else subject to discrete negotiated wholesale power enabling agreements and/or ISDA master agreements. The ERCOT ISO would have no connection with such relationship documents supporting UBS AG trading activities.  On the other hand, as UBS's likely counterparties are entities with wholesale power trading activities of national scope, the timeline for trading in ERCOT is linked to the timeline for completing wholesale power/financial master enabling agreements approved by UBS.  Doug Gilbert-Smith this afternoon identified the following counterparties in decreasing order of of their priority as trading partners in ERCOT:  

TXU Energy Trading 
BP Energy Company
Reliant Energy Services, Inc.
Aquila Power Corporation
Morgan Stanley capitral Group
Constellation Power Source
FPL Energy Power Marketing, Inc.
American Electic Power Service Corporation
Mirant Americas Energy Marketing, LP
Calpine Energy Servicces LP
Dynegy Marketing & Trade
LCRA --Lower Colorado River Authority

along with a couple of incumbent utilities:

San Antonio City Public Service
Reliant HL&P

If you desire Doug Gilbert -Smith to sit in on this meeting, then it would have to be scheduled for Thursday.

UBS Legal and UBS Credit is heading to Houston this Thursday and Friday.  I have asked that ERCOT matters get 1 hour to discuss the necessary contracts that UBS will need to sign to participate in the ERCOT market.

Basically, my understanding is the following --

1.	PUCT Registration Form for Power Marketer
2.	ERCOT ISO Information
	QSE [Portz, David]   N/A until IT platform is ready for UBS to serve as its own QSE 
	LSE [Portz, David]   N/A 
	Wholesale Enabling Agreement [Portz, David]   No ERCOT  involvement 
	Other [Portz, David]   REC Trading Account Agreement  
3.	APX Agreement [Portz, David]   initially
4.	Other

Given the list of issues, this assumes that UBSW Energy will not be selling electricity at retail.  If we need this for Day 1, we would have to get an additional license from the PUCT.

Thanks,

Jim

Attached are clean and marked copies of the online trading GTCs for physical power which I have generally discussed with Bryan Murtagh (UBS). You will note that we have elected to use the EEI form by incorporation as we believe this will be the most marketable approach understanding that different forms will be required for many players, eg WSPP.

I will be doing a final review over the weekend and expect this form to be final by Monday am.  If you have any questions/comments, please let me know.  

By copy of this email to Genia, I would ask for her help in cleaning up the document (sorry, beyond my current skills, hopefully, soon to be broadened) and would ask Leslie to carefully review and provide me any thoughts/comments.  Based upon this document, we will have ready by Monday pm, the long form EEI for regular negotiation.

thanks

Importance:	High

Repairs to the internal coating of the demineralized water storage tank have
been completed.  Therefore, I would like to request an outage for the Sand
Hill Energy Center on Friday, October 26 from 7 AM to 4 PM.  The purpose is
to remove temporary piping and restore normal connections to the
Demineralized Water Storage Tank.  This will restore the Demin. water system
to its normal configuration.  We will not be able to operate the units while
this work is in progress.  Your immediate approval of this outage is
requested.


Thanks,
John Wester

Kevin,

The actual numbers are $2.9 for LCRA and 2.09 for Green Mountain. The LCRA number was for the transmission spread to Austin and can be released as we have Sandhill and the transmission market is no longer set up as it was in Sept 2000. On the Green Mountain side, $950 K is for scalar risk which may be high, $1 MM for ancillaries and $150 for the QSE exposure I underwrote for the services desk.

I feel comfortable releasing the LCRA and a portion of the Green Mountain scalar and a/s reserves. We have some idea of the a/s risk now but I need to keep some of that in reserve. Obviously the QSE part I need to keep.

Let me know,

Doug

New switches can also be added to the Paging System.  Critical telephony applications currently sharing 1 switch include all voice mail.  Loss of network connectivity would prevent anyone from accessing their messages. 
Backout: Revert to old switches.

Oglethorpe has no interest in buying for Cal'02.  However, he does have an interest to buy 100MW, Dec'01, into GTC, 7x24 (if you won't offer 7x24, he's still interested in 5x16).  

Any interest in offering here?

Billy

In anticipation of the imminent closing of the UBSW Energy transaction, please have all outstanding employee expenses in your possession filed through Enron's XMS system as soon as possible.   Note to approvers - please approve these expense reports quickly.   Enron will process and pay all pre-closing expenses.   After transaction closing,  payments  for expenses submitted before closing (and put into Enron's XMS system) will be sent to your last known address or direct deposited into your account.

Enron has committed to processing and paying any expenses incurred prior to transaction closing.   If not completed this week, pre-closing expenses should be submitted on a  hard copy expense report form which will be available at  www.enron.com. 
		
There will be a series of e-mails coming out over the next few days highlighting the Travel & Entertainment policies of UBSW Energy and the procedures for processing and payment.   

If you have any questions, please contact Hope Vargas (3-5280) or Georganne Hodges (3-0430).

>From East Power's perspective, the East PJM development site is the only site/turbine of interest and we should pursue pending transmission analysis to ensure the site is within the congested area of East PJM.

Lloyd and Tim H,   There is still some question about the amount and timing of fundamentals capability that will be required in the Enron Estate.  To date, our working assumption has been that all fundamentals systems (data harvesting, portals, metastock, decision support cubes, etc...) would only be operational in NetCo.  There is no IT staffing in estate to support fundamentals.

Beth Perlman told me today that Jim Fallon has indicated that we need to have IT people in estate who have the ability to bring up our fundamentals capability for the East and West Desks.

A few questions...  Do you agree?  If so, I can have our East Desk fundamentals team begin knowledge transfer to estate IT personnel.  I'll work with Beth on candidates.  Can this requirement be met for West Desk fundamentals?  If so, how would we proceed?  Who would be involved?

Thanks,  Steve

Subject: Access Card Information

Dear Colleagues,

We know you have many questions about your new benefits plan, payroll issues and other changes that will occur over the next few weeks. Human Resources and Communications are preparing a thorough Q&A, which we will send to you tomorrow and will regularly update as more information is available. 

Meanwhile, please read the announcement below from Security about how you can obtain a new UBS Warburg access card that will allow you to enter our new office space after Friday.

I am confident that you share my enthusiasm about our new opportunity.  We look forward to working along side each of you in the coming days.

David Oxley
Human Resources
____________________________________________________________________

Access Cards

There will be a two-day transition for the new UBS Warburg access cards. Beginning Monday, February 11, access to the 5th and 6th floors of Enron Center South will require these new cards. UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors.

Employees who fail to collect their new cards by 7 p.m. Monday will be required to contact Enron Security's general information number at 713-853-5360 to arrange to pick them up.

There will be security staff available at the pick up point on ECS 5 to help with any problems you might have.

It is suggested employees wear their access cards at all times while on the premise.

Accessible Areas - The new cards will allow UBS-W employees to enter:
5th & 6th floors and Plaza area of Enron Center South , 
The Sky Ring 
Body Shop, Enron Center North Plaza and therefore access the Credit Union and Cafeteria from either building.

Restricted Areas - Employees must submit to Enron Security a Restricted Access Request form (available by calling 713 8535360 ) and signed by Bob McAuliffe (713-853-7468) to enter:
Enron Center South, 8th and 9th floors
Enron Center North, 22nd and 34th floor 
Ardmore Data Center.

Employees staying with the Enron estate while visa and other issues are completed - Employees in this group who are on assignment arrangements to UBS-W will be issued a regular access card - available in the same way as other new UBS-W employees.

Estate employees who are working with UBS-W on transition issues  - If they will be based in UBS-W office space they should talk to their UBS-W counterpart for approval and then UBSW HR for the issue of a UBS-W contractor card (in addition to their regular Enron badge).

Kevin -

Is anyone marking vol curves for you currently?

I agree with Rogers.   Because only one entity can mark curves and I have once again made this a requirement for all traders to get re-acquainted with value in the market, it makes sense for Netco/UBS to mark curves until the cutover occurs.   At that point, both entities will assume separate responsibility.

Kevin/Paul -

Apparently the new/separate curve database will not be copied until Monday 2/4.  Therefore, we need to decide who will be responsible for marking curves until such time.

Over the last few days our group has attempted to mark curves but has not been able to because the Netco group is still performing this function (in most cases).  My suggestion is that Netco employees continue to mark curves until the new database is completed.  At that time, there will be two separate processes.  The Enron estate process will only be marking curves where we have live (not terminated) positions including vol positions.

In the meantime, our group will be focusing on validation of the 11/30 and 12/03 curves as well as any other dates that will be crucial for termination calculation purposes.  We will need access to all back-up curve data captured during these time periods.

Please let me know if you agree.

Rogers

As I indicated at today's MAIN Board meeting, please find two attachments
to this email.  The first is the letter that MAPP sent to NERC's president
Mike Gent requesting that NERC reasses the compliance requirements given
the role of RTOs.  The letter indicated that RTO's not regions should be
the entities directly responsible for compliance.  The letter was sent by
MAPP on November 1st.

Of interest, five MAIN IPP generators (including Edison Mission, Duke,
Mirant, Calpine, and Reliant) sent a letter to both Mr. Bulley and Mr. Gent
(with a copy sent to FERC) on September 24th, with very similar statements.
We are yet to see our concern addressed by NERC, but thankfully we got
FERC's attention.  EPSA is pursuing a parallel track at the FERC.

Please feel free to contact me if you need further clarification.  I would
also like to take this opportunity to specifically thank both Mr. Steitz
and Mr. Harbor for showing interest and for trying to understand our
concerns.

Kevin,

A consultant (Energy Consulting Group) in Ga. representing an "A-rated EMC" is looking for 75MW, 7x24, Jan-Feb'02, firm LD energy, "on" (not "into") the Ga-ITS (that is from any generation source on the ITS, or thru the interface and on the ITS).

>From what I know about the Energy Consulting Group, they represent 8 of the larger EMC's in Ga.  We are going to meet with these guys in 2 weeks to see what deals they have available.  It looks like it may be a good opportunity for more short positions on the Ga-ITS.

To all,  we are compiling a list of all common data ( documents, excel spreadsheets, etc...) contained on our O:drive and M:drive infrastructure that will be required for NetCo.  The assumption is that no transactional deal type data will be migrated. Please forward any directory names that will be required for Netco to me. For example,  O:\common\directoryname etc......If there are additional people or resources that I can coordinate with please let me know.  I am available to meet and assist in anyway possible.  

Thanks,
Mike Croucher

Fine with me on the pools.  In the west we named a marketer, a cash trader and an attorney to coordinate on each transmission company.  Case by case, those three will determine the "primary point of contact" and the best way to get it done quickly.

Subject:	Lead Contact for Power Pool and Transmission Service Agreements

After our recent Re-start meeting and the associated planning, there has been significant e-mail activity about what appears to be different points of contact into the different Pools and Transmission Providers.

I would recommend that Netco anoint a Primary Point of Contact with each Pool and Transmission Provider and that person have the resources of Legal, Govt Affairs, Commercial, Credit, etc.  The Primary Point of Contact would initiate and lead all discussions with the counterparty to expedite the agreement.

For the Pools, I think that Govt Affairs should be the Primary Point of Contact.

ISO-NE 	=	Christi Nicolay
NY-ISO		=	Christi Nicolay
PJM		=	Jim Steffes
ERCOT		=	Charles Yeung
MISO		=	Sarah Novosel
SPP		=	Christi Nicolay
CAISO		=	Alan Comnes (although Steve Hall is already working on this and should not be displaced).

For the individual Transmission Providers, I think that the Real-Time Desk/Logistics should be the Primary Point of Contact.

Does anyone see any issues with this proposal?  I am concerned that Netco may be taking multiple positions with the same provider and that could lead to delay.

Thanks.

  Marcus Barnes, who had a chance to give Miami the lead with 1.3
seconds left in the first overtime, hit a key 3-pointer in the second and the
24th-ranked Hurricanes beat Pittsburgh 76-69 Tuesday night.  Barnes struggled in regulation, scoring six points on 2-of-9 shooting, but
he hit a 3-pointer that helped send the game into overtime. Then he could have
given Miami the lead - and probably the win - in overtime but missed two free
throws with 1.3 seconds to play, and the game went to the second overtime tied
at 65.

Subject:	Update on RTOs -- Today's FERC meeting

TJ and Claudette -- please forward to your groups:


FERC held a discussion today on the status of NE, SE, and Midwest RTO proposals.  The FERC judges and staff gave the Commission reports from the mediations and current MISO, SPP and Alliance filings.  While there was much discussion about the appropriate model (non-profit ISO, Transco, ITC), with questions on whether congestion management models were the same or simply compatible, no decisions were made by FERC.  Chairman Wood did commit to quickly providing "certainty" to all stakeholders, including the investment community.  He asked FERC Staff to prepare reports on each region based on comments received at RTO week and through filed RTO week comments (Enron will file Nov. 2) and report back to FERC at the Nov. 7 meeting.

Generator Interconnections Docket # EX01-5-000



Oct. 16 (Btu Watch)

FERC Interconnection Study Team recommends a two-step
approach for Commission to adopt in order to resolve
generation interconnection issues. If adopted, the new
approach would quickly put in place standard procedures
and solidify a standard interconnection agreement that
would accelerate the interconnection process and allow
more time to resolve cost-related issues.

Full Story:

The FERC Interconnection Study Team proposed a two-step
approach, which includes a variety of options for
addressing issues concerning generator interconnection. If
adopted, the new approach would quickly put in place
standard procedures and solidify an interconnection
agreement that would accelerate the interconnection
process and allow more time to resolve cost-related
issues.

FERC staff members Roland Wentworth, Jerry Pederson and
Patrick Rooney are all members of the Interconnection
Study Team. Their two-step approach includes an issue of a
short turn-around NOPR to address contract and product
issues. In Step 1, the Commission would first propose an
adapted version of the ERCOT standard generation
interconnection agreement and procedures for interested
parties to use as an example to aid in the creation of the
final standard interconnection agreement and procedures.
The NOPR would propose standard interconnection studies
and resulting rights, such as establishing a minimum
interconnection standard and defining standard
interconnection products. In order to accelerate the
process, the NOPR should state that any proposed
modifications that benefit only a single entity rather
than the market as a whole would be rejected.

The Study Team encourages that the short turn-around NOPR
could result in a final rule within 120 days. The rule
would apply nationwide; however, the Commission may take
consideration to requests by RTOs/ISOs to propose
adaptations that reflect regional practice and provide
benefit to the market.

Step 2 addresses the issue of cost responsibility. In Step
2, the Commission would issue a second NOPR that would
address the assignment of cost responsibility for
interconnections and associated system upgrades. These
proposed rules would take into account the effect of
various cost responsibility rules on the incentives of
generators and transmission providers to facilitate
interconnections and to make efficient and timely
investment decisions. These rules would be written in
reference to the interconnection rules noted in Step 1,
including any products that are unique to RTOs/ISOs. There
are hopes that this process would be complete
approximately nine months after issuing the Step 2
proposed rules.

Why can't we use AEP's position against them in their own backyard (Ohio). =
  AEP's position is that you can't have effective retail markets without re=

Can we use their own testimony against them?

AEP asked the Texas PUC to postpone opening the Texas (outside of ERCOT) re=
tail market because there is no centralized dispatch (per Ron M's testimony=
 on behalf on AEP).  After talking with our SPP folks (I understand that EP=
MI has bid to serve a portion of Entergy's load) , Jim's testimony is that =
the outside of ERCOT Texas market should open 1/1/02 and that other states =
have implemented retail open access without a centralized dispatch model (f=
or example, AEP in Ohio, ComEd in Ilinois and Duquense in ECAR/PA).  Jim st=
ates that while RTOs and central dispatch will certainly facilitate the mar=
ket, it is not absolutely required, and that, if AEP thinks that the retail=
 market will not be competitive without it, then, perhaps, REPS other than =
AEP should be the only ones allowed to serve retail load in this part of Te=
xas until central dispatch is in place.  In addition, he states that the im=
balance provisions should be changed and that network firm capacity should =
be available to REPs (without the need for protracted system impact studies=
, since the load is already being served.)

Apparently, Entergy has also changed its mind and now is opposing the 1/1/0=
2 opening of the Entergy/Texas retail market.

I don't think I am going to giv an inch on this one.  Edith confirmed that the fixed basis we applied in the contract implies that we used peak only.  If they want a split then we need to increase the fixed basis.

The deal structure was initially all on peak, but migrated to 55/45 on/off peak.  That was the split at which the desk wanted all of these deals structured.  This was the intent of the deal at contract signing.  The contract does not reflect this intent adequately.  This has been known and discussed for some time - almost 2 years.  But, reorgs and departures have apparently left it unfixed all this time.  The last I knew John Wack was working to fix this over a year ago.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Scott -

Edith and the group are working on OC contract review-rebooking.  We have a serious question about intent vs. what is explicitly stated in the contract.  As I understand it, you might have been the deal lead on this one.  Just want your honest opinion on this one and we will proceed based on that.  Let me know if you have a chance to discuss with us as we are waiting on this determination before we move forward with customer discussions.

Everyone-

I will be out of town until Friday (will be in office Friday mid-morning) and then we will be in Belize from the 6th to the 13th.  

We will be staying at:

VICTORIA HOUSE RESORT
P.O. Box 22
Ambergris Caye, Belize
Central America
Tel: 501-262067
Fax: 501-262429

The best way to reach me is probably via my home e-mail (drherndon@aol.com) I will be checking this via internet cafe at least twice a day.  Feel free to call the hotel and leave a message as well.  I will try to check my enron e-mail if i can from Belize.

Have a great New Year and see you briefly on Friday the 4th.

We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your "native" desktop.

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding "1" or a "2" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

Thank you,

Dan Diamond

Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:
	The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of your
application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can substantially
improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
	All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA Tour,
of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.  The
Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so call
(800) 2REVIEW to register.

Subject:	RE: Dec and Jan liquidations

Yesterday I was approached by Steve Thome who had been asked by Brandon Wax (who was asked by Don Miller?) looking for a cash forecast for deals that flowed in December.  While I'd like to be helpful, I have never done a cash forecast before.  We don't have the tools set up in Portland to do this sort of thing.  The data to do this has historically resided in Enpower.  A week ago the West Power desk met and agreed that we were able to and prepared to update Enpower in "Schedule" for all of the deals that flowed in December.  Diana Scholtes sent an e-mail (below) to Leslie Reeves on January 3rd indicating that we were prepared to update Enpower.  We heard from John Postlethwaite that Leslie didn't want us to update Schedule -- instead they could work off of our trade sheets.

I don't care which way we move forward.  It just seems that we aren't all on the same page.  We just want to do whatever needs to be done to get the right information to the right people.  Exerience tells me that we are better off doing it "right" the first time.  I am hoping that between Don, Leslie, and Stacey we can get some clear direction on what you would like us to do.  As of now, there is little I can do to assist Brandon with his request for a cash flow projection.

Regards,
Tim

It has come to my attention that there seems to be miscommunication between various groups and people about how Dec and Jan scheduling for non-terminated deals should be handled. There are conflicting reports that Houston, through the estate, will handle updating scheduling in Enpower or that the scheduling group should be updating Enpower accordingly.

What I am hoping for is that by whatever communications means necessary we can come to a final action plan on how to clean this and get Enpower up to date as quickly and as accurately as possible.

Thanks,

John

Leslie,

I'm trying to get a jump on making sure we have everything done properly in Enpower for the month of January.  My question is whether we, the West desk, should enter any changes in Enpower due to OUR non-delivery and/or incremental deals?  We have everything recorded on our Trade sheets, but if it would make it easier for you to settle or relay to the Estate by us making the changes in Deal Scheduling, we can do so.  

I also understand, after talking to John, you will be using our Trade sheets for such changes for the month of December.  I'm not sure who you would like us to assist in translating our sheets, but if you can call me, we can set up a conference call and I'll coordinate from each desk to attend.  

If there is anything else that you need us to do to help your group please let me know.

I think this guy should be independent from the fundies.   There may be special projects that are "highly confidential" in nature that should be directed by you, Hunter, Tim and myself.   I think Robert would be more successful in a freelance role.

Other input?

Hi John- thanks for the generous offer which I have accepted.  A couple of outstanding questions- 

1. Who am I reporting to?  I would welcome the opportunity to report to you or Greg.  I think my job was a lot easier in the past because our group had the backing of the Office of the Chair. This gave us credibility, independence, and the chance to contribute to strategic issues as well as the tactical issues of interest to the traders. However, I am obviously open to any reporting relationship you might suggest and I understand that my day-to-day duties will consist largely of interaction with the Fundy teams.

2. Are there any slots that have opened because of offers that were not accepted?  I would love to be able to take one of the folks from my group with me, particularly Kristin Walsh or my assistant Sharon Purswell.

Thanks again for the great offer and the chance to join UBS.

Robert

The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack continues to raise concerns worldwide.  Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages.  We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again.

To provide Enron employees with a better understanding of  Anthrax and the potential danger it poses, we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to the CDC and USPS resources.

Don:

This sounds like to same offering that we previously received about two weeks ago from Michael Kolman (not our Michael Coleman) of Navigant. Was the offering you received from Navigant as well?

FYI, Navigant (again, Michael Kolman) is representing us on the sale of our SW501D5A, and we have frequent updates with him on our turbine as well as other turbines and sites being offered in the market.

Regards,

Ben

Should we attempt to serve GPU through the 21st of January.  We have a nice in-the-money contract with them in PJM.  If we don't serve, why wouldn't we use Dec. 21st as the termination date?

Subject:	Terminations by Wabash Power, GPU Energy, Ameren

(1)  I've reconfirmed through Documentation that Wabash's termination, (stated to be effective Dec 19, 2001) was as to all wholesale power transactions between EPMI and Wabash.

(2) GPU Services has delivered a notice of termination as to all transactions with EPMI. We will be treating all wholesale power Transactions with GPU as terminated but have not had to make a final concluision as to the effective date of such termination. (They've sought to make their terminations effective Dec.21, 2001, though they had to give us a month's notice on the agrement by which EPMI sells to GPU, so that termination weffective date would be January 21, 2001.)

(3) Ameren Energy Inc. has sent us a notice of termination dated December 18, 2001, which appears to be a termination and calculation of settlement payment as to all transactions with Enron Power Marketing, Inc. -- I am trying to obtain a verification on the breaadth of this termination notice.

Ed --I'll send you copies of these termination notices for your reference. -David

Elizabeth Sager indicated that Wabash has given appropriate termination notice on all transactions associated with the EEI. I will confirm with David Portz to make sure their termination notice covers any one off contracts in the event they exist.


David:

Are there any one off contracts and does the Wabash termination notice cover if there are? Please advise.

Kevin:

As I mentioned in a voice mail a couple of weeks ago, Reliant has expressed some concerns about the current EnronOnline notification process for changes to power products.  My initial response after discussions with EnronOnline was to explain to Reliant that EnronOnline cannot change the notification process from them and to suggest alternative internal measures that Reliant can implement to monitor product changes.  (According to EnronOnline, no other objections to the notification process have been received by EOL.)   I had heard nothing else for a couple of weeks, and to date Reliant's use of EOL apparently has not been affected.  However, one of Reliant's attorneys, Dede Russo, called me yesterday to discuss the issue again.  I spoke with Rogers Herndon yesterday about Reliant's concerns, and Rogers perceives a real risk that Reliant will discontinue its use of EOL if we do not respond to their concerns.

I would like to discuss this issue with you briefly and suggest that we may want to meet with Savita Puthgai of EnronOnline to consider how best to respond to Reliant. 

Thanks,

Leslie

Greg-The Power Fundamentals applications are owned by Enron and, along with all the other Enron developed software, will be licensed to UBS on an exclusive basis for use in the North American Power and Gas business.  UBS will then sublicense these applications back to Enron for use by Enron within the permitted "Enron Field of Use".  The Enron Field of Use is described in Section 7.1 of the Comprehensive License Agreement and includes all the activities that Enron is allowed to pursue within the North American Power and Gas business.  

Further more, under the Comprehensive License Agreement, Enron is required to maintain and protect any Trade Secrets relating to the Gas and Power Business and to the proprietary software developed by Enron.  See Section 16.9 to the Comprehensive License Agreement.

Give me your opinion on Tim Belden's issue below please.  

Schedule 27.4 lists power fundamentals applications and the CLA says that the Enron Parties are licensing it to UBS.  I also talked with Bob Hillier on this and he agreed with me and said that the Enron Parties own everything and the schedule lists what we are licensing to UBS.  West Power Fundamentals was developed by the Enron Parties and is owned by the Enron Parties.

Let me know your thoughts.

Hi Beth,
I hate to be uncooperative, particularly after all that we have accomplished together, but I can't see where in the Enron/UBS agreement it says that Enron needs or gets to keep the West Power Fundamentals system.  Furthermore, I have no assurances that Enron is in a position to keep this information confidential as Richard Schweiger is rightfully looking for a new job.  Richard could easily understand what we are doing and use it to secure a job with AEP, Pacificorp or someone else here in town.  I don't mean to question Richard's integrity, but these are very strange times.

Until I receive word from UBS or Greg Whalley I am sitting tight.

Again, sorry to be uncooperative, but it doesn't appear to me that our interests are aligned right now and I need to protect our competitive advantage.

Regards,
Tim

All,

I have been requested to obtain a working copy of all fundamental systems.  The estate wants to preserve them and they should be available for use within the estate.

I will dedicate systems resources to working with your groups.  Your cooperation is greatly appreciated.

I will have Richard Burchfield coordinate these efforts.  Richard Schweiger will assist us in Portland.

Thanks,
Beth

I've been asked to pull together a "road-map" of the list of due dilligence items that need to be vetted on full requirements deals for Origination's off-site meeting next week.  I have drafted an initial list, attached below, but would appreciate any feedback you can offer on additional items or detail.  Thanks

100k and 100k contract.

A promotion to VP.

Enron has been increasing security at its facilities around the world.  Som=
e of the changes took effect immediately (e.g. additional security personne=
l) and some are phasing in.  While not all of the changes will be visible, =
there are a few that will have an impact on everyday activities.  In all th=
e steps we take and recommendations we make, we will be making our faciliti=
es and systems more secure and endeavoring to increase your sense of securi=
ty, while doing our best to minimize disruption to our day-to-day business.

Primary responsibility for Enron Corp. Security resides in our business con=
trols organization.  You can contact this organization through their websit=
e (<http://home.enron.com/security>), by phone (713-345-2804), or by email =
(CorporateSecurity@enron.com <mailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com>).  John B=
rindle, Senior Director, Business Controls, leads this organization.  Pleas=
e feel free to provide John and his team with your comments and questions, =
or to report security threats.

We have two areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures for t=
he Enron Center Campus in Houston and changes to our travel advisory.

Access to the Enron Center

Over the next few days, the following access control procedures will be ins=
tituted at the Enron Center (and other facilities where practical):

?=09As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron =
Center, a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer.

?=09Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid =
picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center (U.S. driver's license, U.S=
. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identif=
ication).=20

?=09Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when signing=
 in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor ca=
rd.  Adult visitors without a valid photo ID (U.S. driver's license, U.S. o=
r foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identifica=
tion) will not be allowed access to the Enron Center.

?=09Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or b=
adged contractor at all times.

?=09Visitors to the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an Enron emplo=
yee or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's log at the lobby receptio=
n area by the employee or badged contractor, and escorted to their appointm=
ent.  At the conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to=
 the lobby by an employee or badged contractor, the visitor badge collected=
, and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the =
escorting employee or badged contractor.

?=09Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their =
workplace by following these guidelines; report suspicious activity to Secu=
rity (phone 3-6300), do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to y=
ou or hold doors open, allowing "tail gating" by others.

These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instit=
uted at Enron.  We ask that all employees be patient during congested times=
 in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equi=
pment, we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We hope you understand the=

Travel Advisory Update

With the beginning of retaliatory strikes, we have two important recommenda=
tions:

?=09While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security recommend=
s that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided.  We continue to str=
ongly recommend that all travel during this time to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pak=
istan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Geo=
rgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that =
planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Ara=
bia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.

?=09For non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States, corporate securit=
y recommends that you carry documentation.  There have been several recent =
reports of non-U.S. citizens who reside in the United States being question=
ed and asked for documentation when boarding U.S. domestic flights. As a re=
sult, we suggest that all non-U.S. citizens who currently reside in the Uni=
ted States - and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status - carry th=
eir passport, Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times.  We would also suggest=
 that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident (Green) Card=
 as proof of their status as a precautionary measure.  It appears that Immi=
gration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and National=
ity Act that requires individuals over the age of 18 to carry his/her "regi=
stration" documentation with them at all times. This can include a Permanen=
t Resident Card, Form I-94 card, Employment Authorization Card, Border Cros=
sing Card, or a Temporary Resident Card. Immigration Officials have not his=
torically been asking domestic travelers for "registration" documentation, =
but in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere, it=
 would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your c=
urrent lawful status.

We will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the Corpor=
ate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.

I was on a MAIN Planning Committee conference call this morning concerning Electric System Security.  This a technical group so I was probably overlooked as being a marketer.  Naturally the discussion revolved around potential targets and how to protect them from terrorist attacks.  The part that was disturbing was their desire to severely limit information that is currently in the public domain.  I relayed that I understood the need to protect critical grid components but limiting all information was equally damaging economically.  Some comments made implied that "you can't tell who has the information with marketers because they change jobs so much" and "you need to keep info from people with loose lips"  There was no direct comment linking marketers and loose lips, but the whole undertone was that information might not be as safe with marketers.  I have asked Andy to work with on a response to MAIN MIC and NERC.

Subject: NERC and Security


NERC is apparently moving forward aggressively on their initiative to restrict access to market information.  Doug Sewell, who participates on the MAIN Planning Committee, was on a call this morning in which members of MAIN and NERC's Virginia Sulzberger discussed ways to limit access to information.  A new disturbing angle was that apparently, some members indirectly alleged that marketers have "higher turnover" and "loose lips," and were using this as a scare tactic to indicate why the information should be restricted (potentially even from legitimate consumers like us).

If I remember correctly, we were going to contact NERC to let them know our opinions on this issue.  It sounds like perhaps they are not being addressed sufficiently.  Doug has suggested we should being it up at the MAIN MIC meeting; do we want to begin a campaign to protect our access to this data?  I think that without getting more involved, this will be yet another industry "de facto" standard that is created under the assumption that silence is consent (even if we're not told about the changes).  We should probably talk about this all today on our conference call.

The only comments I received from Mark Ellenberg and Barry Dichter both of
whom reviewed the analysis I sent you last night are:

1. To highlight that the assumption that VEPCO's ultimate right to the
return of collateral would be deemed to be a claim for a margin payment or
settlement payment is not entirely clear and, as noted in the analysis,
that we believe it is a close call.

2.  To point out that the absence of collateral upon setoff also likely
constitutes a breach of the Master Agreement (again, we have not seen the
contract), in addition to, and independent from, effectuating a depletion
of margin collateral.

Otherwise, Mark and Barry concur with the analysis.

Thanks - that's what I needed to know.  I'm still not sure if it is a two-w=
ay termination (yes I know the difference) because there's no language that=
 indicates we'd be paid if we're in the money in a termination.  There is a=
 provision that allows us to cease delivery "by reason of ... significant c=
hange in operating condition"; if we don't deliver, there's an LD calculati=
on, which if positive, we have to pay.  There doesn't appear to be any lang=
uage that causes WEPCo to pay us if we don't deliver and we're in the money=
.  (Hence my question to David) Otherwise, the only way to terminate is wit=
h one year's advance written notice - there are no Event of Default provisi=
ons and remedies, such as for bankruptcy. (Which I'm assuming you know sinc=
e you're familiar with the contract).  What I didn't know was your longer t=

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Ken Lay

Leslie, Jim:

We will need the following information to complete the transmission provider applications, ISO agreements, and NERC memberships.  

- Billing Contact including address, number, email etc.  
- Customer Contact including address, number, email etc.  (We recommend Corry Bentley for the East, however need to confirm address)
- Routing numbers, billing fax numbers
- UBS AG DUNS number
- Confirm what company name to be utilized for the Transmission Provider, ISO and NERC Regional Reliability Council agreements/memberships.

Leslie, can you assist in helping us finalize the above information.  We would like to begin mailing in the TP, ISO & NERC agreements next week on the 12th. 

In regards to NERC ETAG and NERC business entity, we would like to register as UBS.  If we register as UBSWE it may get confused with the East and West scheduling desks.  Therefore, we would like to use the following initials for the NERC scheduling desk codes: UBSE (east desk), UBSW (west desk), UBSC (canada).   I will coordinate this with the West and Canada desks this week, in addition to other remaining steps such as registration with Tradewave for JTSIN OASIS etc.  

Debra

Subject:	UBS Names Summary

Following is the summary of names (at least, as things stand as of this minute!)


UBS Names Summary

1) The contracting entity for US Gas and Power Master Agreements, GTC's, ETA's and PA's will be "UBS AG"

2) The entity for US Gas and Power deals (as appears on Product Descriptions) will be "UBS AG, London Branch"

3) The company name for most promotional purposes (e.g. marketing brochures) will be "UBS Warburg Energy", though the full legal version of this name is "UBS Warburg Energy, LLC"

4) Where the keys logo is used, format shall be "<keys> UBS Warburg". References to other names, such as "UBS Warburg Energy" shall be in a separate part of the screen/page.

5) The website address will be www.ubswenergy.com


Questions still outstanding (hopefully will be resolved early next week)

1) The name of the contracting entity for Canadian GTC, Master, ETA, PA.

2) The name of the entity for Canadian Gas and Power Deals.


Conversion Map for Website Contents

Based on the above Names Summary, the following map should apply. If you see any specific instances in which applying this map would result in a questionable result, please see me and I will try to clarify the appropriate treatment.

"Enron Corp" -> "UBS AG"
"Enron North America" -> "UBS AG" on Masters, GTC's, ETA, PA ONLY
"Enron North America" -> "UBS AG, London Branch" on Product Descriptions
"EnronOnline" -> "UBSWenergy"
"www.enrononline.com" -> "www.ubswenergy.com"
"Enron" -> "UBS"

>From East Power's perspective, the East PJM development site is the only site/turbine of interest and we should pursue pending transmission analysis to ensure the site is within the congested area of East PJM.

We need to meet on Wednesday, the 2nd, at 2:00 pm (in the big conference on the sixth floor in ECS) to go back through the East Power contracts that we will continue to serve either through the pools or under bilateral deals.  Given the drill we went through today in preparing for the January schedules in PJM and NEPOOL, it became apparent we need to get all the team members on the same page and make sure we have a good system for notifying all relevant parties of terminations, changes, etc.

Bill/Ed - Can you please run the most recent DPR for non-terminated East Power contracts.

Casey and Stacey - will you please update the spreadsheet that you ran for Kevin last week.

Let's make sure we all agree on contracts that have been terminated.  As most of you probably have seen, a number of terminations have been received in the past several days (see below).

United Illuminating - effective January 1, 2002
HQ Energy Services - effective January 1, 2002
First Energy Solutions - effective January 2, 2002
Old Dominion - effective January 10, 2002 - we should schedule in PJM through the 10th of January (do we have any other positions with Old Dominion).
Ameren Energy
GPU Energy - effective January 21, 2002 - we should schedule in PJM through the 21st of January (they may push back, but we should remind them that they will be subject to LDs).

Thanks,

Don

FYI.  Seems to be moving toward a Florida-only RTO; however, with (i) MISO and PJM in discussions about one market design; (ii) SPP in MISO; and (iii) PJM bidding to be SE Trans operator (with LMP-financial rights), Florida may have to play similarly.

Bernie,

Steve,

	In the FPSC's ongoing investigation into whether it is prudent for
Florida IOUs to form a RTO and into the costs associated with a RTO, it
issued an order last week finding that the IOUs' proactive formation of
GridFlorida in response to Order No. 2000 is prudent.  It said, however,
that it did not find certain aspects of the GridFlorida proposal to be in
the best interests of Florida's retail ratepayers.

Of particular concern to the FPSC is the transfer of ownership of
transmission assets that the current GridFlorida proposal contemplates.  The
FPSC said it believes that "the benefits associated with the transco
structure of GridFlorida can be achieved under an ISO structure, in which
participants would continue to own their transmission assets while the RTO
would have operational control over those assets. ... The record indicates
that the potential for customer benefits is just as likely under an ISO
structure as the transco structure proposed for GridFlorida. ... While we
appreciate the merits of transferring ownership of transmission assets to
GridFlorida, we believe that a more cautious, transitional approach is
prudent for Peninsular Florida at this time."

The FPSC is satisfied with either a for-profit or not-for-profit ISO.

The FPSC asked that the IOUs modify the GridFlorida proposal consistent with
the terms of the FPSC order and file the modified proposal within 90 days of
the December 20, 2001 order.

Let me know if you need further information.  We can scan the order into an
Acrobat file and e-mail it to you, if you like.

Bill

Fundamentals of the weather for the next 10-14 days remain the same as last
week. The MRF and especially European models have been the most consistent
lately. I am following the Euro here, but the MRF and Euro are not that much
different and share the following....

1) A change to much cooler weather than recently begininng this week.
Weather pattern will become stormier and cooler overall, and we will see
some daily variability as storms cross the nation.

2) No major Arctic air intrusions through the balance of the month and
probably very early Dec.

3) Snowcover remains minimal in Southern Canada and in the U.S. This will be
changing somewhat over the next couple of weeks.

4) I have no changes to the far long term for early to mid December. There
is reason to believe that the upcoming pattern will last for a period of
time, then change again. When it changes, there is a greater probability
than not of it shifting to even colder for the East. It will be our
challenge for the next couple of weeks to determine timing and intensity of
this change.

5) Tomorrow's 6 to 10 day and 11 to 15 day forecasts hitting the market
should be neutral to bearish overall, but certainly not as warm / mild as
recent weeks.

Kevin,

This is to inform you that I am very excited about an opportunity to join your team.  However, I am not excited about the position I've been offered.  I understand you are working on the economics, but I also want you to know that I am not overly interested in Hourly.  I feel my experience and skill-sets are up for a bigger challenge.  Truthfully, I am interested in a position that will lead into a cash trading position in the future.  I don't see Hourly doing that for me.

Let us talk at your convenience.  Thanks.

Juan

FYI.  Original contract says we charge a peak index component.  Somewhere, somehow, somebody appears to want to change to a peak/off-peak split.  I cannot believe this.  Who do these people work for??????

Scott -

The difference is $24 MM.  If the initial deal structure was originally on-peak, it is hard for me to believe that we would change to the split and just give away the $24MM.  Are you saying that there was an error in the contract at signing or something else?  If there is ANY way we feel we (ENE) can keep the current contract structure and the associated $24 MM I think we should do so.

The deal structure was initially all on peak, but migrated to 55/45 on/off peak.  That was the split at which the desk wanted all of these deals structured.  This was the intent of the deal at contract signing.  The contract does not reflect this intent adequately.  This has been known and discussed for some time - almost 2 years.  But, reorgs and departures have apparently left it unfixed all this time.  The last I knew John Wack was working to fix this over a year ago.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Scott -

Edith and the group are working on OC contract review-rebooking.  We have a serious question about intent vs. what is explicitly stated in the contract.  As I understand it, you might have been the deal lead on this one.  Just want your honest opinion on this one and we will proceed based on that.  Let me know if you have a chance to discuss with us as we are waiting on this determination before we move forward with customer discussions.

Thanks,
Rogers

Kevin,

Any interest if offering an odd block of 30MW, into SOCO, 5x16, Cal'02.  Duke Energy is asking?  I told him it would be at a premium to our EOL offer for the odd block, if we would sell it at all.

It is proposed that these will be transferred to the Netco.  The hardware and software were purchased by ENA or EPMI (I have been trying to obtain the answer to this question from accounting).  It is proposed that the $1.5 million outstanding payable to the vendor ESCA would remain with the estate.  Please let me know if you have a problem with this.

Kevin -

I will be in Dallas today and will miss our weekly meeting.  Dale has a ver=
y good presentation for the group.  If you would like Berney to attend on m=
y place let him know. =20

Other issues: =20

I left Janet a voice mail y-day on LSE's and she returned it saying she wan=
ted to discuss with me this am and that they have already allocated those L=
SE's to deals.  I have asked Joe to come up with all of our alternatives in=
 order to get additional LSE's and to provide me with detailed reasons why =
we need them.  I don't want to make this into too big of a deal so we will =
assess all options. =20
Site Profile:
Vlady and Woulfie feel that they need to be able to buy/sell shaped swaps t=
o manage their "risk".  I don't think so.  Essentially, they had proposed t=
hat they can look at all commodity deals that get executed and "keep" part =
of the deal for their book.  I told them that this was ludicrous.  They eve=
n indicated that they might want to just buy certain hours for certain mega=
watts.  My position is that 1) they do not need to trade swaps - shaped or =
not - to manage their portfolio as the forecast should always contain their=
 best view of the market and outright swaps would be VAR increasing, 2) onl=
y one desk - the commodity desk - should manage shape, 3) i do not offer sh=
aped products as a tradeable product at this time 4) they already will own/=
manage products that best mitigate their risks and that I would have to buy=
 to cover - DG, Load Curtailment, DSM, etc.  Anyway, I have had several dis=
cussions with them and I think Vlady understands where I am coming from.  I=
n case this comes up you will know my thoughts.

Load Forecasting:  I need to spend some time with Tim, Jeff, Ozzie, Vlady, =
Woulfe, but I really would like to see us roll Retail Load Forecasting (Mik=
e Frazier) into ROC.  Who officially owns ROC (Lloyd?).

I will be available buy cell or pager if you need me.

On Thursday afternoon, I received from NRG all of the transcripts of communications that they  recorded between the parties.  Here is my short summary:
 
There are six transcripts.  Five of them seem pretty good for us.  One is truly awful.
 
Transcript 1 (May 4, 2001):   NRG's Bill Stone talks to John Zurita about trying to come to terms on the deal.  No terms are finalized.
 
Transcript 2 (May 4, 2001):  Stone calls Zurita back and proposes a price that Zurita agrees to.  However, Zurita makes it clear that although many of the terms have been agreed to, "obviously we have to get agreements signed and get the lawyers involved and all that good stuff."  Stone appears to recognize that the deal is not complete:  "So we're really not done.  Fuck."
 
Transcript 3 (May 8, 2001):  Stone simply leave a voicemail for Chuck Decker asking to get a confirm of the deal.
 
Transcript 4 (May 8, 2001):  Stone talks to Decker.  Decker says: "Rogers Herndon is in charge of that. Okay?  He has to put the pressure on the credit guys to get the credit shit put to bed.  His words, and they're not exact, but they're pretty close to this, I consider the deal done, tell Bill the deal is done, assuming that the back offices communicate the needed information."  Discussions are had about getting the credit folks together to iron out details.
 
Transcript 5 (May 16, 2001) (THE BAD TAPE):  Stone calls Zurita and sets him up, asking him a number of questions aimed at determining if there really is a binding and enforceable deal between the parties.  When Stone asks "why don't you just tell me where you guys think the deal is?," Zurita replies:  "I think -- I say the deal is done."  Stone's next question:  "Well, let me ask a question.  What happens if gas goes to two bucks tomorrow?  Do you still consider the deal done?"  Zurita's answer:  "Yep."  And there's more.  Stone next asks: "Are you guys going to stand on the deal for $70 for the five years?  I mean, I just -- I mean, I just gotta know exactly where you stand."  Zurita's answer:  "The deal is done, yes."  Ouch.  This is not good.
 
Transcript 6 (May 18, 2001):  Zurita calls Stone.  They discuss credit terms.  Stone makes several comments that indicate he realizes the deal is not done. ("The only thing, the only thing I care about is how long it's going to take to have the agreement worked out"); ("What is my concern is how far away are theyfrom getting done?").
 
Rogers, I am interested in your views after you have had an opportunity to review the tapes.  Let's talk soon.  For you others, please let me know if you want transcripts of the tapes.  
 
Andy
 
P.S. --  Under the agreement we reached with NRG for exchange of the tapes, we must trade position papers with NRG on October 25, 2001.  I will prepare the position paper later this week.

Kevin,
 
Put Russell down as 100%.  He's in San Antonio this weekend with his visiting brothers and unfortunately, his contract is here in Houston.  I talked to him last night and he had Jeannie Sloan fax his doc to the hotel and he assured me he'd review it then or first thing this a.m.  I'm sure he'll find the language acceptable since it's merely a 30-day evergreen.  As for additional $'s, I personally guaranteed him $10k and gave him 50-50 odds on the 1-year contract we talked about yesterday.  He's in either way.
 
 I also called Suarez yesterday and left a message, but haven't heard back yet.  I'll lob another call in this morning around 10am.
 
Did you receive a faxed signature copy from Carson yesterday/this a.m.?
 
Flet

Make sure that all curves are downloaded by the end of simulation, 11:00 CST, tomorrow.  Ideally, the 2/7/02 curves should be marked in the morning prior to simulation.  We have been instructed to kick the calculation off as close to 11:00 CST as possible.  This is to ensure that ALL downstream systems are able to run through the simulation.

Please forward to all applicable traders.

Thanks,
Stacey

Dick Basford (formerly, a consultant for Enron on Florida matters) called me with a recommendation that EPMI withdraw from FRCC membership before EPMI is invoiced in February for $5750 (1/4 of annual dues of $23,000).  There is no pre-notice period for withdrawal and Dick feels that it would leave the FRCC relationship in a better light if EPMI withdraws, rather than not paying the invoice.  I tend to agree if EPMI has no further ongoing interests in trading in Florida.

UBS trading can make an application and join at any time, without an initiation fee.

Kevin/Paul--Is it ok for EPMI to withdraw?  If so, I'll draft the letter.  

Thanks.  Christi  37007

It currently looks like we will not have any wire requests today for power prepayments. 

East Power - We are currently working with PJM and NEPOOL to come to a payment resolution to remain active and current in those two markets, and will not have any need for a wire transfers today (the earliest we will need may be tomorrow depending upon form of resolution).  Additionally, given the post Christmas market conditions and lack of liquidity (and staffing needs in companies other than Enron), Kevin and Dana were not able to execute any bilateral prepay deals for the regions outside PJM and NEPOOL.  They will be continuing to push these deals for the next several days, but realistically, it may be next week before we can actually pull these off.

West Power -  We will have tomorrow a detailed prepay list and wire requests for the first week of January.

Thanks for everyone's help with this process.

Don

Please see below.  FERC is "mulling over" whether to exert broader authority over the UBS purchase.

US FERC Mulls Scope Of Authority Over Enron-UBS Deal

01/16/2002 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- UBS Warburg's bid to take over the energy trading business of Enron Corp. (ENE) will require Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approval, FERC Chairman Pat Wood III confirmed Wednesday. 
Once cleared by the bankruptcy court, FERC expects to receive an application for approval of the deal under the commission's authority, Wood told reporters. 
FERC's jurisdiction involves the transfer of Enron's commission-granted authority to regulate the rates at which Enron sells electricity and natural gas, said Cynthia Marlette, FERC's general counsel. 
But Marlette indicated the commission is mulling whether to exert a broader regulatory reach over the deal. "The commission hasn't opined yet whether it has jurisdiction over the corporate transfer," she said. 
As announced in recent days, UBS Warburg, a unit of UBS AG (U.UBS), will assume Enron's trading business with little if any cash up front, while paying Enron royalties equal to 33% of pre-tax earnings. 
The bankruptcy judge is due to rule on the deal later this week.

Kevin,

Any interest if offering an odd block of 30MW, into SOCO, 5x16, Cal'02.  Duke Energy is asking?  I told him it would be at a premium to our EOL offer for the odd block, if we would sell it at all.

Davis Besse would like to delay their  inspection till Spring outage but it appears that the NRC has a lot of issues and are concerned about there analysis of the situation.  It is more than 80% likely that the NRC will request them to do an inspection in late November or early December.  This information will be confirmed during the beginning of November

I tracked back through the HR names to see if I can get to 9. They would be:
 
Specialists
Neil Davies  - team lead
Kari Oquinn - comp
Tony Garrett - payroll and benefits
Karen Buckley - recruiting, A&A's, training and management reports
Generalists
Jeanie Slone - OTC, Gas Commercial teams, Denver, Mexico, New York
Amy Fitzpatrick - Power Commercial teams, Calgary and Portland
Mandy Curless - IT, Back office and support groups
 
Me
Julie Clyatt - group admin
 
Please bear in mind it would be imperative to make sure the following stay in estate for at least 90 days and help us with transition (ie not sure we can do everything we need to with above team):
 
*Tana Cashion - Generalist 
Sarah Zargowski - Generalist
Anne Labbe - Admin
*Julie Kearney - Portland/Calagry HR rep
Charles Philpot - HRIS
Tharsie Broussard - Comp reporting number 2.
 
Above are names I am suggesting come off list to get to 9.* names are one's ideally I'd like to add back.
 
David

I've been asked to pull together a "road-map" of the list of due dilligence items that need to be vetted on full requirements deals for Origination's off-site meeting next week.  I have drafted an initial list, attached below, but would appreciate any feedback you can offer on additional items or detail.  Thanks

Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.
Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.
To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.
IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.
We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.
Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

Also,  I am concerned that Narsimha may have someone from the outside trying to recruit him.  I am pressing him on the contract and he is telling me everything's ok - lawyer reviewing, etc.  I am going to give him another day or so and then just call him on it.  I think there is better money out there, even in this market and do not want to lose him.  Honestly, Joe, Juan and Narsimha are the only commodity guys I can count on to do what is right - amazing.  You may want to ask Narsimha about the contract if you see him.

I agree with this approach and I'm fine with this allocation.   My objective is to get everything as accurate as possible so the proper price signal is being sent to retail and wholesale origination.   I caught the scalar issue when we were looking at 4 hour tolls vs. 8 hour tolls vs. 16 hour and I could tell there was a disconnect.

thanks.

I think it is appropriate to instruct Risk to put the charges associated with the PJM scalar in the Change Deal Bucket as this was out of the Retail Commodity Group's control.  I am trying to hold these guys accountable for positions, p/l and such and I think this is the only way to fairly account for results that they could affect vs. someone else's error/mismark.  Let me know if you think this is appropriate.

I have sent the message again to make curves as accurate as possible through 2015.    We are doing are best.   The Entergy situation was simply a back office mistake.   The NY off-peak is a work in progress and will get better every day.   The legs never trade, only the cals, therefore, we have to use common sense for month values.

Thanks for the info.   In most cases, Narsima is exactly right.

Subject:	Curve Changes

Here are the significant (non market related) curve changes that have effected our P&L in the last week...and also a working issue related with curve management.

PJM East Hub: 
   Summary : Hourly Scalars for East hub were changed, resulting in a ($2.3 million) loss.
   Reasons : Rob Benson had changed the West hub scalars a few months ago and those scalar changes never got transfered over to the East Hub curves. When the curve management function was moved from excel into the Enpower Curve Management system all the curves derived as a basis off West Hub curves started using the West Hub Scalars. 

Entergy Back End:
  Summary : Yesterday, Entergy 05 and beyond curves moved down in the range of $0.50/MWh to $1.65/MWh resulting in a loss of approximately $2.3million (held back because Mike Carson is fixing the curves today)

NY Curves:
  Summary : The onpeak and offpeak curves for NY Zones A, G and J require a thorough clean up especially with regards to the issues that are stated below. The P&L is still to be determined because curves have not been changed.


On Peak
1.  J-G Spread is marked over G-A Spread starting in Year 2009.
2.  J-A Spread blows up year on year, starting in Year 2005.

Offpeak
1.  Zone-G is marked above Zone-J half of the time;  occuring mostly in Q1, Q4 and Aug.
2.  Zone-A is marked above Zone-J every July in 2003-2006.  With the exception of 2002, for the month of July, Zone-A is marginally marked below Zone-J.
3.  Zone-A is marked above Zone-G for every July from 2003 to 2018 and Dec 2003.
4.  Zone-A, for every year, MarApr is over MayJun by a significant amount.

EXPORT your contacts:
1. Open Outlook and select the contacts folder
2. Click on one of your contacts and then press "CTRL A", this will select all
3. Press FILE / Import and Export ...
4. Choose "EXPORT TO A FILE" and press next
5. Choose "MICROSOFT EXCEL" as the type and press next
6. Make sure "CONTACTS" is selected and press next
7. Choose a location to save the file to: c:\KevinContacts.xls then press next
8. Press FINISH and it will take a minute to copy all contacts to an excel file.

Now you may want to open the excel file to make sure it has something in it, then send it via email to your home.

IMPORT your contacts:
1. Detach the Excel file you got in email.  Save it to your hard drive and remember the location.
2. Open Outlook and choose File/Import and Export ...
3. Choose "Import from another program or file", then press next
4. Select "Microsoft Excel" from the list and press NEXT
5. Choose the file you want to import (The one you detached from email), then press NEXT
	You can also choose whether to allow duplicate entries, in case you have someone in both contact lists.
6. Select the Destination Folder.  Highlight "Contacts" and press NEXT
7. You will see what actions will be completed, press FINISH 

Now Outlook will import the files.


This will work from home and the office.  You can keep doing this every so often, but remember to choose "Do not allow duplicates" in step 5 of the IMPORT phase if you do this more than 1 time.



Good Luck and let me know if you would like me to walk you through this.  

Have a good day.

14:01 19Nov2001 RSF-INSIDE FERC: Midwest-Market 2: Lack of sellers forces high Enron bids - PGN311

Washington (Platts)--19Nov2001/301 pm EST/2001 GMT 

One trader said that she found arbitrage opportunities on some of the online platforms, capitalizing on a 5- to 6-ct differential between prices posted on EnronOnline and those on IntercontinentalExchange. She confirmed that few market players are willing to sell to Enron, which is forcing Enron to bid at a premium. 


Spot prices on ANR Pipeline in Oklahoma ranged from about $1.75/MMBtu early in the morning to about $2.36/MMBtu late, up from Friday's range of $1.38 to $1.58/MMBtu.

Fyi in case you see him Tuesday am.  I told him the 175/175, texas gas/power.  Presto and Kitchen went to bat for him.  He asked about base - I told him I would write a $15K personal check.  I think he was impressed but he was under a six-pack and wanted make a sober decision.

TECO is issuing an RFP to sell up to 500MW beginning June 1, 2004.  TECO is converting its coal-fired Gannon facility into a gas-fired, combined-cycle plant (to be Bayside Facility).  It will be a 4 unit plant.  They are selling cap. and energy off of units 3 & 4, which have combined output of 960MW using 7FA turbines.  At full load, the net plant heat rate is 7,100.  

I should receive the RFP shortly.  They are looking to sell a toll off of the plant.

Hi,

=09FYI, the options sessions for the originators begin today.

=09The location for the first session is ECS05990.

=09Once we get past the basics of options, then the plan is to focus on mor=
e advanced topics - exotic options, load following, cross-commodity structu=
res, etc.

=09Perhaps during these more advanced sessions some of you guys would like =
to make presentations.

Thanks,
Iris

Kevin,

Tomorrow I am meeting with 2 separate consulting groups that represent collectively 15 EMCs in Georgia.  As a result of our calling efforts, it appears as if these 15 are some of the larger EMCs under Oglethorpe.  I think these 2 groups are planning to break apart from OPC and form 2 new agencies (7 in one, 8 in the other).  I plan to get as many details on this as possible during the meetings.

There are 2 opportunities at this point with specific EMCs in each of these groups.  Both are to buy energy on the Georgia ITS.  1) 75MW, 7x24, Jan-Feb'02, and 2) 20MW, 7x24, 3-5 yrs., beginning 1/1/03, prefer load following at a 73% load factor, but will consider a block purchase.

I'm going to get more details on these separate requests, but wanted your initial interest level.

Thanks,

Billy Braddock

No changes.

The first major Arctic air mass of the year will push into the northern
Plains early to mid next week. Most of Canada will also be much, much colder
than it has been. Check temperatures in Calgary next week and see what I
mean.  Overall, a stormy and much cooler weather pattern for the nation next
week, but the major cold air will hold up in the northern Plains and Upper
Midwest. In agreements with our thoughts from Wednesday, the cold air will
NOT blast into the East and South next week, and it will remain mild in
these areas.

The weather will continue to be stormy in the longer range and turning
gradually colder. I believe the MRF is still too mild looking in early
December, but I still don't believe any major cold reaches the East Coast or
the Deep South before December 5. After that, I continue with my thoughts
that overall, cold weather will overwhelm much of the nation east of the
Rockies after December 5 and by December 15. I still cannot tell how cold or
any of the details as it is still a long way off. I am basing my thoughts
more on the European model here as it SHOULD do better in this weather
pattern.

Earth Sat seems reasonable in their 6 to 10 today, but in my opinion, it
will probably turn out to be colder in the 11 to 15 day across the Plains
and Midwest than they are showing.

Rika,

 Davis-Besse will probably be using Framatome to perform the repair work on the head crack.  You will probably see wire reports that Framatome expects to be complete with the repair in about 60 days.  We, however, totally disagree with that assessment.  Framatome may be estimating based on total amount of work they have to do, but they are not incorporating any delays for regulatory review and approval.  I believe our July restart forecast is much more realistic.
 
 
Thanks,
Dan

04:33 20Nov2001 RSF-Platt's: Enron sees cash drain, warns on survival

New York (Platts)--20Nov2001/533 am EST/1033 GMT 


Enron filed Q3 financials late Monday, revealing a huge cash drain, despite last week's $1.5-bil asset-backed infusion from merger partner Dynegy. Enron said its cash Friday had fallen to $1.2-bil, even with the Dynegy payment three days earlier, $550-mil drawn on a new bank line last week and $3-bil drawn on existing lines earlier this month to pay off $1.9-bil of commercial paper. Enron blamed operating costs, trade settlements and collateral deposits paid to trading partners. Enron said it expects $800-mil soon from asset sales and got another $440-mil bank line Monday. But it warned it might not be enough to keep its investment-grade credit rating or restructure debt coming due. That could have a "material adverse impact on Enron's ability to continue as a going concern," it warned.

All,

I have been requested to obtain a working copy of all fundamental systems.  The estate wants to preserve them and they should be available for use within the estate.

I will dedicate systems resources to working with your groups.  Your cooperation is greatly appreciated.

I will have Richard Burchfield coordinate these efforts.  Richard Schweiger will assist us in Portland.

Thanks,
Beth

On October 17, 2001 Rockland Electric Company and PJM filed with FERC a joi=
nt application for the transfer of operational control from the NYISO to PJ=
M of certain facilities located in Northern New Jersey.  The facilities are=
 the transmission assets in the Eastern Division of Rockland's service terr=
itory.  This includes approximately 400 MW of load in Bergen County, NJ and=
 transmission facilities that are already directly interconnected with PJM =
(note that other Rockland facilities located in NJ, namely those in norther=
n Passaic County and Sussex County (Rockland's Central and Western Division=
s respectively) will not be transferred to PJM and will remain under the op=
erational control of the NYISO since these facilities are not directly inte=
rconnected with PJM nor with Rockland's Eastern Division).  The filing requ=
ests approval of the transfer by November 30, 2001 which would allow PJM to=
 take operational control on February 1, 2002 (the filing does not address =
what, if any, changes to the operation date might be if FERC does not appro=
ve this by Nov 30).  Rockland Electric is a subsidiary of Orange & Rockland=
 Utilities which is a subsidiary of Con Edison.

The transfer adds approximately 400 MW of load and 56,000 customers (mostly=
 residential and commercial) to PJM.  There is no increase in supply, there=
fore the total load of PJM is increased by 400 MW without any additional re=
sources.  The transmission assets include 138-kV (8.3 miles), 69-kV (35.9 m=
iles) and 35-kV (12.4 miles) transmission lines and 11 substations (the fil=
ing includes a detailed description of these assets).

Let me know if you require any additional information.

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

Kevin,
 
Jon Hoff summarized the East Power positions in the attached spreadsheet.  If he did it correctly, I beleive it says that to purchase power from 12/27 through 12/31, you need a total of $18MM.  However, the $18MM includes $4.5MM for PJM and $5.5MM for Nepool, which we are working on seperate payment/prepayment terms right now (this assumes we purchase ALL Nepool and PJM power from the pools).  As such, what you need immediately is a little over $8MM for bilateral deals to prepay for power outside of PJM and Nepool for the period of 12/27 through 12/31.
 
In total, $18MM of power purchases will generate $20.5MM of receipts, or a little over $2.5MM net for the estate.
 
Question - this sheet shows Ameren is negative $194M over the three days. Are you serving to preserve a contract that turns positive later? 
 
If this sheet is fair and accuarte, let me know and I will forward to Bowen and DeSpain tonight.  It probably makes sense to get on the phone on Monday with them and knock this out quickly.  I don't anticipate any problems.
 
Don

 RTO Week

Day 2 -- October 16, 2001

Congestion Management and Transmission Rights

The morning panel discussion was on congestion management.  The panelists w=
ere:  Nancy Brockway, Commissioner New Hampshire PSC; Reem Fahey, Edison Mi=
ssion; Carol Guthrie, Chevron/Texaco; Shmuel Oren, University of California=
 - Berkley and advises Texas PUC; Andy Ott, PJM; Michael Schnitzer, NorthBr=
idge Group.

General Observations

The Commissioners were again all present (Wood left mid-morning to give tes=
timony on Capitol Hill).  Today, however, FERC Staff was much more active i=
n the discussion and the commissioners asked very few questions.  The topic=
s are so interrelated that many of the same issues already discussed are be=
ing rehashed again.  This will probably continue for the rest of the week. =
 What I have found most encouraging so far has been the widespread support =
for some of the basic concepts, most notably the need for a real time energ=
y market based using LMP.  Very few panelists have opposed this; at most, a=
 couple of panelists have argued that the real time market should not be st=
andardized -- basically conceding that PJM's system will be implemented in =
the Northeast but urging that it not be mandated everywhere else.   =20

Locational Marginal Pricing

The panelists all agreed that LMP in the real time market is necessary (Sch=
muel Oren does not oppose it).  Most of the panelists think this needs to b=
e standardized across RTOs.  Andy Ott says the seams will remain a problem =
and a barrier to trading if the real time market is not standardized.   Car=
ol Guthrie does not favor standardization and urged FERC to not standardize=
 the PJM system throughout the eastern interconnect.  She said FERC should =
try a couple of different systems and see what works. =20

FTRs versus Flowgates

The panelists agreed that transmission rights should be financial, not phys=
ical.  Schmuel conceded this point for the discussion but this may not be h=
is preference - unclear.  Most of the panelists, including the PSC commissi=
oner, prefer FTRs rather than flowgates.  Schmuel is a flowgate advocate.  =
After some discussion, the panelists agreed that FTRs and flowgates could w=
ork together, provided that the definition of flowgate is understood.  Andy=
 Ott said flowgates could work with FTRs if the purpose of having flowgates=
 is the same purpose of having hubs (liquidity, standard product), and if a=
 flowgate is defined as a grouping of point-to-point rights, then FTRs and =
flowgates can coexist.  If a flowgate is a hub for transmission rights, it'=
s okay.  However, if flowgate is defined as a physical boundary requiring s=
cheduling, the two cannot coexist.  Schmuel seemed to agree with this premi=
se, although this is not his preference.  He seems to prefer only flowgates=
 without FTRs.   Brockway seems to prefer FTRs rather than flowgates for fe=
ar that flowgates will result in excess socialization of costs.

The panelists also agreed generally that revenues generated from FTRs or fl=
owgates should be allocated to load, but the method of allocation was not a=
greed upon.

FERC staff asked the panelists to discuss commercially significant flowgate=
s.  Many of the panelists discussed the problem with deciding what constitu=
tes a commercially significant flowgate, and what happens when circumstance=
s change over time, resulting in different flowgates being commercially sig=
nificant.  Schmuel said you could use either a system that relies only on c=
ommercially significant flowgates or one that uses all flowgates, but if pa=
rticipants are willing to accept a system where they are not perfectly hedg=
ed, use of commercially significant flowgates is acceptable. =20

The panelists agreed that these financial rights (either FTRs or flowgates)=
 should be tradable in the secondary market.  The panelists disagreed on wh=
ich instrument -- FTRs or flowgates -- are more tradable.  Andy thinks FTRs=
 are more tradable; Schmuel thinks flowgates are more tradable.

Options versus Obligations

The panelists discussed the benefits of having FTRs be options but also dis=
cussed the additional problems presented to the system operator if FTRs are=
 only options and the FTR holder is not required to flow or pay if it does =
not flow.  Andy Ott said options will most likely result in fewer FTRs bein=
g allocated.  Schnitzer says the issue must be resolved up front. =20

The afternoon panel was on Transmission Planning and Expansion.  Steve Walt=
on was a panelist and will be providing a summary of the discussion shortly=
. =20

Let me know if you have any questions.

Kevin,

The start time for the Miami vs. West Virginia game on October 25 has been
moved ahead 30 minutes, to a 7:00p.m. kickoff.  If you can't make it out to
the Orange Bowl, the game will be televised on ESPN2.  As always, the
Hurricane Club pre-game end-zone party will start 2 hours prior to kickoff,
at 5:00p.m.

Once again, thanks for your support.

The Hurricane Club

Rogers, Kev wanted me to summarize for you the information that I received from one of the industrials that we have been actively pursuing.  

TotalFinaElf has about 70MW of ERCOT load at a 85%+ load factor.  Doug very aggressively priced these guys due to two things: 1)  contact had indicated that he was getting "low, low 8 heat rate offers" and 2) our relationship with contact (I used to trade gas at the same bucket shop with their head gas trader).  Last week Doug showed them $26.00, load following, +/-10% band, all congestion, all ERCOT pancake charges, et al (T&D only pass through).  

Evidently that indication by customer wasn't blowing smoke, we ended up "middle of the pack."  Calpine and Reliant both came in with the same product (converting the heat rate) sub-$25 --- Calpine being the most aggressive.  By all indications Calpine is showing 8.2-8.3 heat rates and Reliant 8.3-8.4 at least for this customer.  Now whether that translates into equivalent pricing for all low meter, high usage, and high load factor customers we shall soon see given the amount of pricing we have out there.  In this case, however, looks like they are willing to give it up on the MTM book to get MWs out the door and have it to trade around real-time in the accrual book next year.

Subject: RTO Week -- Summary of Day One Panel


Today was the first day of FERC's "RTO Week" in Washington, D.C.  The topic of today's panel was "RTO Markets and Design:  Required Markets and Optional Markets."  The issues in both panels were quickly merged and the two panels discussed all of the issues.  

Panel One:  Mandatory RTO Markets<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" />

The morning panel consisted of the following participants:  Peter Cramton (University of Maryland), David Hadley (Indiana PSC), Mark Kleinginna (Ormet), John Meyer (Reliant), John O'Neal (Mirant), and Roy Shanker (consultant for generators in the Northeast).  

Energy Spot Market

There was unanimous agreement among these panelists that the RTO must run a real time energy, or spot, market.  Most panelists agreed that the spot market should be a bid-based, security-constrained system with economic dispatch.  In response to a question from Pat Wood, most also agreed that nodal (LMP) pricing should be used in the spot market, although John Meyer from Reliant stated that zonal pricing is used in ERCOT and that works also.  

Day Ahead Market and Balanced Versus Unbalanced Schedules

Most of the panelists said that the RTO should not require balanced schedules.  Peter Cramton said that with a day-ahead market, no need for balanced schedules because the real time market prices will discipline behavior.  John Meyer agrees, saying if there is no balanced schedules requirement, then there might be a need for a day-ahead market.  John notes that ERCOT has a balanced schedule requirement.  John also said that imbalance penalties could be appropriate for imbalances that hurt the system.   Roy Shanker also said FERC needs either a balanced schedules requirement (which he does not recommend) or have a day-ahead market.

ICAP Requirement

Most of the panelists (except Peter Cramton -- University of MD) support an ICAP requirement.  However, none of the panelists could point to an effective ICAP market (Roy Shanker says he has an idea of what would work - we will probably see this in comments in the ICAP proceeding due later this week).  

Mark from Ormet kept bringing the message back to the need to know the rules and know that the rules will not change substantially over time.  Mark said liquidity in PJM does not help him move power to the Midwest since the rules are undefined outside of PJM.  He cannot enter into long-term contracts because he does not know what the rules will be one or more years out.  He also said you can have an ICAP market but market participants have to be able to meet ICAP requirements through load response.

 Standardized Markets

 Most of the panelists agreed that the mandatory markets should be real time and day-ahead energy markets, spinning and non-spinning reserves and regulation should also be required and be standardized.

Massey asked if the costs to standardize are outweighed by the benefits.  Roy Shanker said the Northeast works so FERC should not change it.  Even if FERC does not require standardization between the RTOs, creating large RTOs and fixing the problems within the RTOs will be a big improvement.  Mark with Ormet and the Indiana Commissioner both urged FERC to standardize the mandatory markets among the RTOs.

Panel Two:  Optional RTO Markets

The afternoon panel consisted of the following participants:  Fiona Woolfe (lawyer with experience in England and Wales pool); Roy Thilly (Wisconsin Public Power Inc.); Richard Pierce (professor at George Washington); Glen Arthur (Connecticut PSC); Steve Naumann (Commonwealth Edison); Ed Cazalet (APX).

This panel was intended to cover optional market issues, including whether a day-ahead market is needed and whether there should be ICAP markets.  This panel addressed these issues as well as the need for a real time market, market monitoring, and other issues.

Mandatory Markets

Other than Ed Cazalet (APX), the other panelists for the most part agree that the RTO should run a real time and day-ahead energy market, ancillary services markets, and there must be an ICAP requirement.  Ed Cazalet believes that there only needs to be a small balancing market (perhaps with balanced schedules requirements) and leave the creation of any other markets to independent entities to create.

 ICAP

 Most of the panelists believe that the RTO should provide a day-ahead market, congestion management and ancillary services.  Most also favor an ICAP requirement and market.

Pat Wood said he is not convinced that a blanket ICAP requirement is needed on Day One.  He has been considering an ICAP requirement that does not apply until triggers are reached, and perhaps that should be considered here as well.  He has also been talking with a Northeast regulator about having different requirements for states depending on whether they have retail access or not.

Shelton Cannon (Staff) asked the panelists to assume one Midwest RTO - can there be different ICAP requirements within the RTO?  Most panelists agree that if the ICAP rules are the same within the RTO, that there could be percentage requirement deviations.

Day Two of RTO Week focuses on Congestion Management in the morning and Transmission Planning and Expansion in the afternoon.  We will get summaries out on these panels tomorrow.

Please call me with questions or comments.

Kevin,

I have spoken with Elizabeth and Bill and they both said that they will be at your meeting.  I was unable to reach Christi Nicolay however I have left her a voicemail on her cell phone and told her that she was necessary for this meeting.

T Jae,

I will not be here Wednesday morning and did not set up a conference bridge because it is just with Portland.  You might want to arrange something different or contact them yourself.  This conference room (06716) is the one next to John and Louise and it is reserved for you.

Have a Happy New Year!!!

Kim

Money & Investing
Enron CFO's Tie to a Partnership
Resulted in Big Profits for the Firm
By REBECCA SMITH and JOHN R. EMSHWILLER 
Staff Reporters of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL


A limited partnership organized by Enron Corp.'s chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, realized millions of dollars in profits in transactions it did with Enron, according to an internal partnership document.

The partnership, in some instances, benefited from renegotiating the terms of existing deals with the Houston energy company in ways that improved the partnership's financial positions or reduced its risk of losses.

Mr. Fastow, and possibly a handful of partnership associates, realized more than $7 million last year in management fees and about $4 million in capital increases on an investment of nearly $3 million in the partnership, which was set up in December 1999 principally to do business with Enron.

 
The profits from the deals were disclosed in a financial report to investors in the partnership, LJM2 Co-Investment LP, that was signed by Mr. Fastow as the general partner and dated April 30. In one case, the report indicates the partnership was able to improve profits by terminating a transaction early.

The LJM2 arrangement has become controversial for Enron, as shareholders and analysts have raised questions about whether it posed a conflict by putting the company's chief financial officer, who has a fiduciary duty to Enron shareholders, in a position of reaping financial rewards for representing LJM2 investors in business deals with Enron. Investors in LJM2 include Wachovia Corp., General Electric Co.'s General Electric Capital Corp. and Credit Suisse Group's Credit Suisse First Boston.

Attention has focused on Mr. Fastow's partnership activities at a tumultuous time for Enron, which over the past decade grew enormously by becoming the nation's biggest energy-trading company.

This year, though, it has been hit by a string of troubles, from soured business initiatives to executive departures. On Tuesday, Enron announced a $618 million third-quarter loss, because of a $1.01 billion write-off on investments in broadband telecommunications, retail energy services and Azurix Corp., a water company. A small chunk of that write-off, about $35 million, was attributed to ending certain LJM2-related transactions. That termination also produced a $1.2 billion reduction in Enron shareholder equity as the company decided to repurchase 55 million shares that had been part of LJM2 deals.

At 4 p.m. Thursday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron was down 9.9%, or $3.20, to $29 a share. Within the past year, the stock had topped $80 a share.

Enron officials didn't have any comment about the LJM2 partnership document. Enron has consistently said its dealings with LJM2 have been proper. They said the LJM2 deals, like ones done with other parties, were aimed at helping hedge against fluctuating market values of its assets and adding sources of capital.

Mr. Fastow has declined several requests for an interview about LJM2. In late July, he formally severed his ties with LJM2, as a result of what Enron officials said was growing unease by Wall Street analysts and major shareholders. Mr. Fastow has been finance chief of Enron since 1997 and has been with the firm 11 years, which included extensive work setting up and managing company investments.

Michael Kopper, a former Enron executive who an Enron spokesman said is now helping to operate LJM2, declined to comment. He also wouldn't describe his relation to LJM2.

In his April 30 report, Mr. Fastow said the partnership, which raised $394 million, had invested in several Enron-related deals involving power plants and other assets as well as company stock. The document said LJM2 sought a 29% internal rate of return. That was down from a 48% targeted rate of return at the end of 2000, which the document said was due in part to a decline in the value of LJM2's investment in New Power Co., an Enron-related energy retailer. In some transactions, LJM2 did much better than the 29% target, though this sometimes involved renegotiating individual deals.

In September 2000, the partnership invested $30 million in "Raptor III," which involved writing put options committing LJM2 to buy Enron stock at a set price for six months. Four months into this deal, LJM2 approached Enron to settle the investment early, "causing LJM2 to receive its $30 million capital invested plus $10.5 million in profit," the report said. The renegotiation was before a decline in Enron's stock price, which could have forced LJM2 to buy Enron shares at a loss of as much as $8 each, the document indicated.

Spoke to Lew at Morgan.  In summary, he's $1@$4 for this spread.  

He spent some time to explain why his market is not tighter.  Basically, the underlying philosophy of their shop is to NOT jump into the new, less liquid markets until they develop further.  They would almost rather see a few markets develop within the region, with high liquidity in each market (as opposed to many markets in the region, with low liquidity in each market).  My response was to be part of developing many market in the region, all with high liquidity.  But, in order to do so and help all the players in the market, we need other participants.

All that being said, his offer is $4 for the Cal'02, into SOCO/on Ga-ITS spread, 5x16.  I'm going to try some of the others (Williams, Dyn, Mirant may be players).

Attached is the real audio files from the above CERA conference for your review.  All indications are that government and industry will be working closer with possible real time reporting requirements to manage any impact to the flow of oil in America much like what was setup during world war II.

CERA Chairman Daniel Yergin hosted a presentation by US Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, at which the Secretary spoke on US energy policy and the legislative implications of the war on terrorism.

The importance of energy security strategy has certainly been raised, and Secretary Abraham spoke about actions by both industry and government to adapt to this new environment. He also noted requests from President Bush and Senate Majority Leader Daschle to the US Senate to enact a new US energy strategy. Finally, Secretary Abraham described his agency's efforts to improve communication between government and industry decision makers in this period of bipartisanship and heightened focus on energy security.

	CERA Chairman Daniel Yergin introduces U.S. Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham. [duration: 2:23]
 
	U.S. Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham touches on recent key issues facing the U.S. energy policy following the 	events of September 11. [duration: 20:50]

I attended the subject conference last week and my notes are attached. The course leader was Soli Forouzan, formerly Chief Risk Officer for PG&E Energy Trading. To me, the most interesting points presented were:

1.   Each asset should have an assigned Asset Manager with commercial responsibility and a separate P&L for the asset.
2.   The asset should be hedged and any speculative trading/price risk should be kept separate from the asset "Book."
3.   Assets provide "real" options, and these options can be valued using option pricing models. Special software is commercially available using Monte Carlo techniques to do this valuation. Some firms, such as Duke Energy, have developed their own models.

Coming from the development engineering and operations side of our business, I don't know to what extent we already have put these concepts into practice, or have chosen to use different approaches. But if any ideas in these notes might have application to our business, I would be happy to discuss some more details from the course materials. My number in Houston is 713-646-7775.

Standardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices <?xml:namespace prefix=
 =3D o ns =3D "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" />

Panelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy =
Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Chr=
istiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC Gene=
ral Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnes=
ota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Co=
mpany.

 General Observations

 The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left l=
ate in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, =
the commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% o=
f all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed;=
 much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seem=
ed very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry f=
orward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover fo=
rward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize th=
at some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed =
to be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was =
discussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take th=
e reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was notice=
able conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two or=
ganizations somewhat common during the discussions.=20

 FERC Deliverables

A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne=
eded from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they =
felt was critical. =20

The first major topic was "How many RTOs?  What is their scope?"  All panel=
ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b=
y FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific langua=
ge, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.

The next topic was, "What will be standard market design?"  Panelists varie=
d on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged f=
or one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid sta=
ndard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (=
followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the curre=
nt situation.

The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha=
t the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic=
 throughout their discussions, asking questions like, "Do we need to issue =
a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?" and, "How much detail do you=
 need us to provide?"   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they =
wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as t=
o say FERC should "Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a=
 little further."  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, bu=
t in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and t=
he need for cautious investigation. =20

One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc=
heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th=
e "RTO Design and RTO Implementation" section would address many of the que=
stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Korm=
os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying =
a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The se=
ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following =
questions:


?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occu=
r, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i=
s nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there=
 be others that must be accommodated?


?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to sch=
edule ("covered" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protect=
ing from congestion charges (both "covered" and "uncovered" schedules are a=
llowed)?=20


?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission =
services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues=
 to be addressed?


?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing pr=
ior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to reti=
re those contracts?  Are there other solutions?


?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function?=
 Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules)=
, be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced sche=
dules), or will they be required at all?


?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed =
in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary=
 services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as fina=
ncial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?


?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses? =
 Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce=
ss, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technical=
ly unwieldy?


?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrate=
d into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that =
non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to t=
reat each NJE as a separate entity?


Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica=
l questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which =
to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions=
, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., "do congestion management") will t=
ake a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., "LMP with financi=
al hedging instruments") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike =
about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible =
to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.

Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) refer=
red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati=
on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out=
 said, "My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't =
believe that that statement is true."  He then backpedaled a bit and said t=
hat it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assert=
ion by the Northwest interests was false.


NERC and GISB


A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-se=
tting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, "Are we looking at a bea=
uty contest between NERC and GISB?"  Cook and Boswell then went into severa=
l short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants cont=
inually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interesting=
ly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI=
SB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the "new" structure of NERC and=
 did not focus on its history.

Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a=
sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were=
 they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily a=
ble to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin=
g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Poin=
t, Brownell.

Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-m=
an.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's suppos=
ed "successes," such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will =
likely remember that these "successes" have not been so successful, resulti=
ng in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments=
 in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show=
 the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.

There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues=
, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some =
talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.

The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly ur=
ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade=
rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC s=
omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would=
 say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Guys,

You have been selected to complete the telephone screening of external candidates for second and final round.  Each  candidate will be screened by two traders to ensure agreement on quality of candidates.   (these resumes have already been selected from c. 200 resumes by some of the ENA Traders).  

As in the previous Trading Track recruiting event, you will be given a few days to complete this.  The candidates will be expecting your call, there is no set interview time therefore allowing you flexibility to call in the evening from home if necessary.   Resumes, telephone numbers etc will reach your desk tomorrow morning.   All phone screens to be completed by Tuesday pm: 16th October.

Any questions please call myself or Adrianne Engler.

Thanks,

WSJ(1/14)Heard On The Street:Enron Ex-CEO Made Bet Vs. Rival 		

01/13/2002
Dow Jones News Services
(Copyright ? 2002 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)


  By Ken Brown 
  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 

When Jeffrey Skilling resigned as chief executive of Enron Corp. in mid-August, he said he wanted to spend more time with his three children. "I've missed too many soccer games over the years," he told his brother Tom soon after he quit. 

But instead of standing on the sidelines, Mr. Skilling stayed in the game, making a big, speculative stock-market bet against an Enron rival. 

A spokeswoman for Mr. Skilling confirms that he made the wager: a short sale initiated on Aug. 24 against shares of AES Corp., a big energy producer. A person familiar with the matter puts the trade's value at $30 million, though Mr. Skilling's spokeswoman says the estimate is "way out of the ballpark" on the high side. 

The bet came as AES's shares were tumbling, and, depending on when it was closed out, could have netted him a profit of more than $15 million. Mr. Skilling's spokeswoman, Judy Leone, confirms he did make a profit on the trade but won't say how much or when the trade was closed out. "There is a category of personal financial information that we're going to respect Mr. Skilling's privacy on," Ms. Leone says. 

As CEO of Enron, which made most of its money trading in the volatile energy markets, Mr. Skilling was used to taking on risk. He pushed the company into several unproven businesses, including the trading of bandwidth, or network capacity, a market that ultimately didn't prove successful for the Houston company. Enron itself reveled in a swashbuckling attitude that ultimately contributed to its downfall; the company has been under bankruptcy-court protection since early last month. 

But a bet of this type was exceptionally risky. In short sales, investors borrow shares of a stock and sell them, hoping the stock will fall so they can replace the shares with cheaper ones. Such trades are riskier than buying a company's shares directly, because if the stock rises strongly, an investor with a short position on the shares can be forced to "cover" the bet at a sky-high cost. 

As it turns out, AES shares, along with those of other energy companies, fell steadily in the month after Mr. Skilling's resignation. Then on Sept. 26, AES stock tanked, falling by nearly 50%, when the company announced it wouldn't meet analysts' earnings estimates for 2001. If Mr. Skilling had maintained his short bet through that date, he could have earned better than 60% on his investment. 

AES, based in Arlington, Va., blamed the earnings shortfall in part on the fall in the Brazilian currency. AES wouldn't comment on Mr. Skilling's trading. "Commenting on another company's now-departed executive's behavior is not a comment I think we ought to make," says Kenneth Woodcock, a company spokesman. 

Mr. Skilling's bet raises the question about whether he knew anything special about AES's business because of his work at Enron. Ms. Leone, his spokeswoman, says Mr. Skilling shorted the AES shares based on a July 30 page-one article in The Wall Street Journal that said AES was having trouble in its big Brazilian operations and would be hurt by the fall in the Brazilian currency. Based on information in the article and his general knowledge about how business in Brazil worked, he felt that the company's stock might fall in price. His trading decision was "absolutely not" based on any nonpublic information he had obtained while an Enron executive, she says. 

AES did trade energy with Enron, but only a small amount and only as a way to sell its output, rather than to earn a profit, according to Mr. Woodcock. He adds that there would be no obvious way for Mr. Skilling to have gained any unique or valuable knowledge about AES through Enron's dealings with his company. 

The trade was made through Mr. Skilling's account at Charles Schwab & Co., the big discount broker, and it created a buzz inside the firm's San Francisco offices. After the position was taken, "we checked up on it a couple of days later, and a couple of days after that, and said, oh, it went down," says the person familiar with the trade. 

At the time of Mr. Skilling's resignation, Schwab executives in their newly opened private-client office in Houston were trying to sell Mr. Skilling on a plan to hedge the value of his Enron stock, the person says. Schwab executives in San Francisco had created an elaborate presentation for the hedging strategy, called a collar, but Mr. Skilling never acted on it, a decision that may have cost him millions, the person says. Mr. Skilling wouldn't comment on the collar proposal. 

At the time of his resignation on Aug. 14, the 1.1 million Enron shares that Mr. Skilling owned outright were worth about $47 million. He also had 500,000 vested options that were in the money, meaning their exercise price was below the stock's share price at the time. Mr. Skilling has said he sold about 500,000 of the shares he owned outright on Sept. 17, when the stock market reopened following the terrorist attacks. That sale would have netted him about $15 million, based on that day's volatile prices. 

His remaining 600,000 shares are worth $408,000 at Enron's current share price of 68 cents, and his options are worthless. Just accounting for the 600,000 shares he owns outright, the collar proposed by Schwab could have saved Mr. Skilling more than $30 million. 

Interestingly, professional investors often will try to hedge a big positive bet on a company in any given industry by shorting shares of a rival, on the theory that if the entire industry tumbles, the gains on the short sale would offset the losses on the long position. But Mr. Skilling's spokeswoman says the trade wasn't a hedge, adding that it was the "first and only time" he made a short sale and that right now the only stock Mr. Skilling owns is Enron. "If he thought the stock price was going down he could have sold all his Enron shares; he didn't," Ms. Leone says. 

Enron and Schwab, which were often paired in magazine articles touting America's most innovative companies, had at least one minor business relationship. Schwab had handled a small portion of Enron's 401(k) called the "brokerage window," which allowed employees to buy mutual funds not offered in the company's plan, as well as individual stocks for their 401(k)s. The relationship ended in July when Enron made some administrative changes to the plan and Schwab was replaced. 

Mr. Skilling isn't the only member of his family to suffer because of Enron's collapse. His brother Tom a Chicago television weatherman, bought 750 shares of Enron at $49 early last year "because of these incredible analyst reviews" of the company. He says he sold them in the fall at $27 to buy some land. "Little did I know if I stuck with it I would have a 60-cent stock," he says in an interview from his vacation home in Alaska. 

He says his father suffered more: He bought 2,000 shares of Enron last year and still holds them. "You wonder what in God's name were the analysts doing," Tom Skilling says. "There were a lot of people lulled into, I don't know what, a comatose state."

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

We plan to have a conference call at 2pm Sunday to discuss progress.  We want to reallocate dollars which have been returned to the pool and ensure we keep the process moving and any contracts redone by the UBS team in preparation for Monday.  David is going to send an email with contact numbers etc for questions people may have with regard to the contracts (apart from the numbers and promotions) as all those questions need to be sent to HR.

Please make sure you contact all of your guys and have an idea of where they are at.

Tammie will contact you all with the dial in number.

The meeting will be in John's office.

Thanks

Louise

E] It seems evident that Anderson, the government  and Enron itself, had pr=
ivy to a lot of financial data that clearly  indicated the eventual collaps=
e of Enron.   Andersen contemplated dropping Enron as a client nearly one  =
year ago because of concerns due to Enron's accounting methodology.   The W=
hite House oversaw a study in October 2001 of economic  repercussions of an=
 Enron collapse. Sherron Watkins, a senior Enron Executive, wrote to Enron'=
s  chairman, Ken Lay, "I am incredibly nervous that we will  implode in a w=
ave of accounting scandals." last August 2001" The writing was clearly on t=

"not  unethical", with apparent stress on the "not" part. One  now battered=
 marketer has been specifically accused of "suspending  the rules of corpor=

like scandal, allegations, suspicions and cover-up have become  rank in the=
 industry. CEOs have been asked to leave their positions,  executives have =
been forcibly terminated while another commits suicide;  and the investigat=
ions continue, including criminal ones. The situation  is sobering.  It see=
ms like these last few years have been full of bubbles bursting  as we all =
collectively share a cold bath of economic reality. The techs  tumbled and =
the stock markets followed, the electricity market (at least  in California=
) imploded, real bombs are exploding all over the place  and the mightiest =
energy marketer has fallen; and it won't be getting  back up. The biggest b=
ankruptcy in US history will definitely leave  its mark on all of us. To th=
ink, we thought the troubles of PG&E  and the Cal-PX was big news.   Arthur=
 Levitt, former SEC boss, suggests that "Enron's collapse  did not occur in=
 a vacuum ? (and was) ? was partly a result  of a culture of gamesmanship a=
mong go-go businesses that believe it's  okay to bend the rules". This is a=
 fundamental folly of the industry  as people with limited energy knowledge=
 (and integrity) play games with  other peoples money and not understanding=
 or caring about the consequences.  It is not surprising that the stock val=
ue of other marketers is also  beginning to plummet.  So the question of th=
e day is: are you acting prudently? It is insufficient  to assume that migh=
t is right or size is protection. Contracting with  the largest does not se=
cure your contract; no more than using the largest  accounting firm ensures=
 your books are right. We all leave a paper trail  and that trail is visibl=
e in a moonless night during a California forced  blackout, even if you ord=

Subject: RE: RTO Week -- Summary of Congestion Management Panel



 RTO Week

Day 2 -- October 16, 2001

Congestion Management and Transmission Rights

The morning panel discussion was on congestion management.  The panelists w=
ere:  Nancy Brockway, Commissioner New Hampshire PSC; Reem Fahey, Edison Mi=
ssion; Carol Guthrie, Chevron/Texaco; Shmuel Oren, University of California=
 - Berkley and advises Texas PUC; Andy Ott, PJM; Michael Schnitzer, NorthBr=
idge Group.

General Observations

The Commissioners were again all present (Wood left mid-morning to give tes=
timony on Capitol Hill).  Today, however, FERC Staff was much more active i=
n the discussion and the commissioners asked very few questions.  The topic=
s are so interrelated that many of the same issues already discussed are be=
ing rehashed again.  This will probably continue for the rest of the week. =
 What I have found most encouraging so far has been the widespread support =
for some of the basic concepts, most notably the need for a real time energ=
y market based using LMP.  Very few panelists have opposed this; at most, a=
 couple of panelists have argued that the real time market should not be st=
andardized -- basically conceding that PJM's system will be implemented in =
the Northeast but urging that it not be mandated everywhere else.   =20

Locational Marginal Pricing

The panelists all agreed that LMP in the real time market is necessary (Sch=
muel Oren does not oppose it).  Most of the panelists think this needs to b=
e standardized across RTOs.  Andy Ott says the seams will remain a problem =
and a barrier to trading if the real time market is not standardized.   Car=
ol Guthrie does not favor standardization and urged FERC to not standardize=
 the PJM system throughout the eastern interconnect.  She said FERC should =
try a couple of different systems and see what works. =20

FTRs versus Flowgates

The panelists agreed that transmission rights should be financial, not phys=
ical.  Schmuel conceded this point for the discussion but this may not be h=
is preference - unclear.  Most of the panelists, including the PSC commissi=
oner, prefer FTRs rather than flowgates.  Schmuel is a flowgate advocate.  =
After some discussion, the panelists agreed that FTRs and flowgates could w=
ork together, provided that the definition of flowgate is understood.  Andy=
 Ott said flowgates could work with FTRs if the purpose of having flowgates=
 is the same purpose of having hubs (liquidity, standard product), and if a=
 flowgate is defined as a grouping of point-to-point rights, then FTRs and =
flowgates can coexist.  If a flowgate is a hub for transmission rights, it'=
s okay.  However, if flowgate is defined as a physical boundary requiring s=
cheduling, the two cannot coexist.  Schmuel seemed to agree with this premi=
se, although this is not his preference.  He seems to prefer only flowgates=
 without FTRs.   Brockway seems to prefer FTRs rather than flowgates for fe=
ar that flowgates will result in excess socialization of costs.

The panelists also agreed generally that revenues generated from FTRs or fl=
owgates should be allocated to load, but the method of allocation was not a=
greed upon.

FERC staff asked the panelists to discuss commercially significant flowgate=
s.  Many of the panelists discussed the problem with deciding what constitu=
tes a commercially significant flowgate, and what happens when circumstance=
s change over time, resulting in different flowgates being commercially sig=
nificant.  Schmuel said you could use either a system that relies only on c=
ommercially significant flowgates or one that uses all flowgates, but if pa=
rticipants are willing to accept a system where they are not perfectly hedg=
ed, use of commercially significant flowgates is acceptable. =20

The panelists agreed that these financial rights (either FTRs or flowgates)=
 should be tradable in the secondary market.  The panelists disagreed on wh=
ich instrument -- FTRs or flowgates -- are more tradable.  Andy thinks FTRs=
 are more tradable; Schmuel thinks flowgates are more tradable.

Options versus Obligations

The panelists discussed the benefits of having FTRs be options but also dis=
cussed the additional problems presented to the system operator if FTRs are=
 only options and the FTR holder is not required to flow or pay if it does =
not flow.  Andy Ott said options will most likely result in fewer FTRs bein=
g allocated.  Schnitzer says the issue must be resolved up front. =20

The afternoon panel was on Transmission Planning and Expansion.  Steve Walt=
on was a panelist and will be providing a summary of the discussion shortly=
. =20

Let me know if you have any questions.

This is Not a  Joke. 
Warning received from Police...please read and pass 
along  
A t t e n t i o n : 
This is very scary and is not a joke. Please  read 
- it definitely is a serious threat to our lives and 
health. This  is an alert about a virus in the original 
sense of the word...... one that  affects your 
body.....not your hard drive. There have been 23 
confirmed  cases of people attacked by the Klingerman 
Virus, a virus that arrives in  your real mailbox, not 
in your e-mail inbox. 
Someone has been  mailing large blue envelopes, 
seemingly at random, to people in the U.S. and  Canada. 
On the front of the envelope in bold black letters is 
printed  " A Gift For You From The Klingerman 
Foundation". 
When the  envelopes are opened, there is a small sponge 
sealed in plastic.  This  sponge carries what has come 
to be known as the Klingerman Virus and public  health 
officials state this is a strain of virus they have 
not  
previously encountered. Those who have come in contact 
with the  Klingerman Virus have been hospitalized with 
severe dysentery. So far seven  of the twenty-three 
victims have died. There is no legitimate 
Klingerman  Foundation, mailing unsolicited gifts. 
If you receive an oversized blue  envelope in the 
mail marked "A Gift For You From The Klingerman  
Foundation".      Do not open it !!!!! 
Place it  in a strong plastic bag or container & call 
the police immediately. The  "gift" is one you 
definitely do not want to open. 
PLEASE  PASS THIS ON TO EVERYONE THAT YOU CARE ABOUT  
                                                                                     Vaughn  Hicks

Many of you have requested more time in which to submit your nominations for the 2001 Chairman's Award. In response to your requests, the deadline has been extended to Friday, October 12.

Please take this extended opportunity to nominate that special individual who is your everyday hero and a role model who exemplifies Enron's core values of Respect, Integrity, Communication and Excellence.

This award represents how important Enron's core values are to the company. The success of this award program is determined by Enron's most valuable asset, you, the employee. Employees at any level can nominate fellow employees from anywhere within the Enron family - from the top down or the bottom up. All of those employees who have been nominated in the past are eligible to be nominated again this year and there is no limit to the number of nominations you may submit. Simply complete a nomination form and submit it by Friday, October 12, 2001. Forms can be obtained by visiting your intranet site or at home.enron.com and in Houston they are available in the elevator lobbies. In addition, this year we have a new way you can nominate that everyday Enron hero. Simply pick up the phone and dial 713-345-2492, follow the simple and quick instructions and leave your nomination by phone.

The finalists for the award, the Chairman's Roundtable, and the Chairman's Award winner will be honored at Enron's Management Conference in San Antonio on November 15.

Thank you for your participation.

FROM:  Enron Property & Services Corp

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee.  

For employees who park in the Allen Center, Met, or Enron Center garage, new parking rates are in effect beginning with the January 31st paycheck.  Rates for 2002 have increased by $5 for unreserved and $10 for reserved spaces.  This increase is consistent with first of the year rate increase obligations in Enron's parking lease agreements with the garage operators.  Enron is continuing to subsidize employee parking for Enron lease garages.  

Direct parking costs to employees are as follows:
Enron Center Unreserved	2001 Employee Cost - $94 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $99 per month	
Enron Center Reserved 4th Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $215 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $225 per month	
Enron Center Reserved 3rd & 5th Floors	2001 Employee Cost - $165 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $175 per month	
Allen Center Unreserved	2001 Employee Cost - $94 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $99 per month	
Allen Center Reserved 3rd Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $215 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $225 per month	
Allen Center Reserved 4th Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $165 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $175 per month	


Please note that effective January 31st only the Enron Center and Allen Center Garages will be available for Enron employee parking.  To request parking or to switch to these garages please call Parking and Transportation at ext. 37060 or ext. 36399.

If you have any questions about Bus Passes or Parking, please call Martin Katz at ext. 59322.

Lloyd -

FYI - I received a voicemail from Shanna Funkhouser and she indicated that either Martin transfers to NETCO today or he needs to be terminated effective today.  Looks like we don't have a lot of flexibility on this.  

I believe that some changes may have been made this weekend to the lists of people transferring to NETCO.  Would you be able to confirm with Kevin whether or not Martin is still on the list to go so that we know how to proceed with him?  I would hate to transfer him today only to find out in the next couple of days that it will not work out.

Thanks for your help - if you have any questions, please let me know.

Amy

Stephen and Steve.
 
Please note the email sent to Virginia below requesting  additional information for this meeting.  
 
I had hoped to discuss the following budget items with Kevin and Tim tuesday at 12:00-1:00 prior to our PM budget meeting.
 
Steve the budget attached is quite different from the rough one that was presented to our team several weeks ago.
 
Also after reviewing it further I have a few questions and sujested changes.
 
East desk markets went from 3.6 to 4.1 million?  Also with the recent FERC delays would we not be wise to only look at half a years spend starting in June when it will be clearer what is comming or will we use this money to build our strategic system?
 
Power Architecture went from 2.6 to 3.1 million?  How do we allocate this amongst east, west and cdn offices. 
 
Intraday P&L will likely be canceled at 2,2 million.
 
The real time workbench and services tools project can be reduced to service tools only.  This should reduce the cost in half from 1500 to 700K.
 
Global meter who is the sponsor?  PMI the east has 2 dedicated staff 400k not 1.7 million.
 
EMS and CA services.  In the east we have sold our CA's and have 2 dedicated staff plus a part time consulant (4-6 months) , costs for this item should be 3-400k rather than 1.2 million?
 
Risk tools needs some scope to justify the $1.6 million especially with dove and global valuation projects on the table.  We could easily shut down our efforts until these other projects ramp up.
 
Power Fundamental maintenance of 6.6 million seems large, please review?  Gas maintenance is only 600K ?  Also how much is east, west and cdn costs for this item.
 
Do you have any background on the market inteligence initatives web site?
 
Thanks.

Will you be providing additional information to support these numbers before the meeting on your per person costs and how we are charged overhead etc.
 
Also why only the numbers in the blue.  We have not agreed to the rest?  I have also seen numbers that are quite different and several of these projects are not required as well as some are overpriced.
 
Also how will the allocation between east, west and canada be done for these single line items.
 
Thanks.

Kevin -

Just checking on the status of Brian Terp - we are showing that he is still open.

Has he returned his letter or do we owe you any revisions?

Thanks!
Amy

Will set up a meeting asap.

We have put money in the netco fundy budget with trey hardy to complete the new lmp project.  Looks like a 45 to 60 day effort once we have money approved by netco.

The rest will not be a big effort but we will be a little slower for new requests due to a shortage of IT staff. However the majority of our process's are fairly automated.

Kevin,

I think that is fine but what happens when the deal becomes final.  Will we definitively be given access to your curves?  Of course that would be easier but we have been given conflicting information on this one.  We were told that this information would be considered proprietary and that we could not depend on receiving curves all the time.

Thanks,

Paul

One group needs to mark curves.   I personally think it is easier for us to mark curves because we have traders in every region.   I simply need to make it a priority again.   I can go either way, though.   We definitely don't want two sets of curves.

Let me know.

Kevin -

We are developing a process to mark estate curves.  We will be fully marking by Thursday (including vol curves) except possibly the West (still working on).  Is your group currently marking estate curves (I think someone dropped the PJM cash curves today)?  I think we should probably let the estate group begin this process so that they can be ready to go when UBS takes over - your thoughts?

Kristen/Kevin - can we differentiate effective now between estate/netco curve manager so that we can start a parallel process?

Thanks,
RH

The last I heard, the MISO is supposed to begin offering service on their OASIS tomorrow for service starting January 1.  I wanted to let all of you know a bit about where we stand with regards to that process.

I have been working with several different folks here and at the MISO to ensure that we are ready to do business with the MISO and request service.  The MISO OASIS seems to be accepting our Tradewave Certs, so we just need to get our MISO login for their systems. Today, the MISO will be sending out logins to their systems via FedEx, and should arrive prior to 10am.  Christi Nicolay will be receiving this information and distributing it as soon as it arrives. 

Unfortunately, the MISO has been (as you probably know) cutting things closer and closer to the edge.  This login was supposed to be delivered a couple weeks ago, but they have just gotten around to sending it out.  Hopefully, we will not have any problems with it once it arrives.  As I understand it, there should be only one login set up for "EPMI 24-Hour Operations," with a login of "Enron."  The password is currently only known by the MISO, but should be contained in the letter we receive tomorrow.

This login is a temporary one until we complete our final registration.  This final registration has been a bit more of a pain, as it has involved contractual agreements and credit obligations.  I am still working with our Legal, Credit, and AP folks to get everything set up.  Again, the MISO sent the final documents out fairly recently, and we have not had a great amount of time to review, analyze, and negotiate their terms.  Hopefully, we will have come to agreement with MISO about those items, and be able to file that final application soon.

If you have any questions or concerns, you can reach me at my desk (X53771) or via my cellular (713-927-4680).  Obviously, you can also call Christi (X37007) or Susan Lindberg (X30596) as well.

REPORT - THE POWER INDUSTRY:  LESSONS FROM OTHER CYCLICAL INDUSTRIES

*	We recommend reading our attached report.
*	We interviewed six analysts who cover cyclical commodity industries.
These include: airlines, chemicals, oil/refining, paper and forest products,
semiconductors, and semiconductor equipment.
*	What are the lessons for the Power industry?...Where are we on the
cycle?
*	The answer lies in the relationship between capacity and pricing.
*	Although we do not draw a conclusion here, we will be analyzing the
factors which answer these questions. 
*	We think you will find the framework we've established useful in
thinking about these issues.

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise

Sheila --

Attached is a draft letter for your signature on behalf of EPMI to withdraw from the Florida Reliability Coordinating Council (FRCC).  I have gotten authorization from Kevin P and Paul R to send this.  Withdrawal keeps some good will with FRCC since we will not get billed for the next quarter (annual fees are $23,000).  Enron and/or UBS can join at any time in the future with no initiation fee.

The letter needs to be printed on some type of Enron letterhead (Enron Corp. is ok -- we cannot find EPMI letterhead) and faxed to 813-289-5646, preferably on Wed, if possible.  Thanks.

Kevin -
 
Just an FYI - Steve Marland resigned from Reliant very recently.  Steve had been trading their term Midwest book and has previously covered the SE I believe.  I think Steve is a good trader, played the regional/time spreads very effectively, and is not afraid to put size on when appropriate.  I just think that Reliant's management team is "old school" and Steve was not being able to effectuate the changes he saw necessary (apparently, they would not even let him trade NG against his positions).
 
Steve just wanted to clear his head and get away.  He is looking at the opportunities everyone else is at the moment and is not in a rush.  I know he wants to work with a bright group that thinks the way he does.  I have told him that he should talk to you guys.  You may want to contact him directly when you have the green light to look outside ENE.  I have known Steve for awhile and think he could be a good fit - I think Fletch has met him and dealt with him in the markets as well.
 
Steve's cell number is 713-962-0274.  I know he would like to talk to UBS.

Hi Kevin,

Thanks for the message. PIRA doesn't have any relationships and/or
agreements with UBS Warburg.

I know Tim Belden in Portland wants to restore several services. Please let
me know the number of people (licensed users) and locations for each
retainer service so I can give you a quote for site licensing fees.

Fletch Sturm (works for me and runs the MW power group) will be following
up with you or Allen.   We need to make sure we coordinate with gas and
west power so no duplication is occurring.    We need to also make sure
that UBS is not already a client who receives PIRA materials.

   Hi Tim,

   Thank you the phone message about your continued  interest in PIRA
   Energy Group. I look forward to hearing from you or Kevin  Presto about
   the PIRA analytical services you want to purchase for  your new
   business. (Kevin, I work for Allan Stewart in  PIRA's electricity group
   and also handle sales/marketing of PIRA's  services.)

   Attached  is a description of PIRA's service offerings and an Excel file
   showing a  price matrix with annual fees.   Our base retainer service is
   for up to 10  users at one site (office location) under a site license
   agreement. One retainer  is $25,000 (e.g., natural gas), two retainers
   are $35,000 (e.g.,  electricity and natural gas) and three retainers are
   $40,000 (add  oil).  Fees for additional services such as emissions
   market  intelligence and the daily electricity demand forecast are shown
   to the right of  the main table. Clients with  users of PIRA's services
   in multiple offices can arrange a site license for  higher usage.

   Best regards,
   Victoria

I talked to Giffels today and he mentioned that SONGS units are under serious security scrutiny given its location.   He gave us a 50/50 probability that Indian Pt 1&2 (30 minutes north of NY City) and Pilgrim (15 minutes north of Boston) would be shut down in the near term for security reasons.

He mentioned that SONGS was also a candidate.   I personally don't think the probability is that high, nonetheless, the rumors seem to be in the market.

Due to the events of the past few days, we are trying to determine what, if any,  significant cash outlays will be occurring for the remainder of the year.  If there are any pending deals that require significant cash, can you please let me know the deal name and estimated amount of cash outflow?

RTO Week

 <?xml:namespace prefix =3D o ns =3D "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:offi=
ce" />

Day 4 - October 18, 2001

Afternoon Session

=20

Standardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices=20

Panelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy =
Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Chr=
istiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC Gene=
ral Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnes=
ota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Co=
mpany.

=20


General Observations


=20

The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left la=
te in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, t=
he commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of=
 all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; =
much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seeme=
d very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry fo=
rward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover for=
ward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize tha=
t some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed t=
o be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was d=
iscussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the=
 reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticea=
ble conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two org=
anizations somewhat common during the discussions.=20

=20


FERC Deliverables


A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne=
eded from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they =
felt was critical. =20

The first major topic was "How many RTOs?  What is their scope?"  All panel=
ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b=
y FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific langua=
ge, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.

The next topic was, "What will be standard market design?"  Panelists varie=
d on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged f=
or one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid sta=
ndard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (=
followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the curre=
nt situation.

The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha=
t the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic=
 throughout their discussions, asking questions like, "Do we need to issue =
a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?" and, "How much detail do you=
 need us to provide?"   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they =
wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as t=
o say FERC should "Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a=
 little further."  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, bu=
t in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and t=
he need for cautious investigation. =20

One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc=
heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th=
e "RTO Design and RTO Implementation" section would address many of the que=
stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Korm=
os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying =
a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The se=
ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following =
questions:


?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occu=
r, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i=
s nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there=
 be others that must be accommodated?


?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to sch=
edule ("covered" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protect=
ing from congestion charges (both "covered" and "uncovered" schedules are a=
llowed)?=20


?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission =
services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues=
 to be addressed?


?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing pr=
ior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to reti=
re those contracts?  Are there other solutions?


?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function?=
 Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules)=
, be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced sche=
dules), or will they be required at all?


?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed =
in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary=
 services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as fina=
ncial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?


?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses? =
 Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce=
ss, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technical=
ly unwieldy?


?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrate=
d into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that =
non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to t=
reat each NJE as a separate entity?


Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica=
l questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which =
to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions=
, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., "do congestion management") will t=
ake a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., "LMP with financi=
al hedging instruments") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike =
about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible =
to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.

Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) refer=
red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati=
on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out=
 said, "My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't =
believe that that statement is true."  He then backpedaled a bit and said t=
hat it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assert=
ion by the Northwest interests was false.


NERC and GISB


A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-se=
tting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, "Are we looking at a bea=
uty contest between NERC and GISB?"  Cook and Boswell then went into severa=
l short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants cont=
inually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interesting=
ly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI=
SB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the "new" structure of NERC and=
 did not focus on its history.

Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a=
sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were=
 they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily a=
ble to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin=
g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Poin=
t, Brownell.

Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-m=
an.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's suppos=
ed "successes," such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will =
likely remember that these "successes" have not been so successful, resulti=
ng in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments=
 in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show=
 the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.

There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues=
, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some =
talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.

The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly ur=
ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade=
rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC s=
omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would=
 say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Subject:	RE: NERC Board Actions

This is a direct result of the recent actions from GISB to get involved in the wholesale electric standards.   We and EPSA have made positive statements about the GISB process.  NERC has been forced to change to accomodate what many in the industry are looking for.  There are still many "ifs" at GISB at this time, much of it around how much the big utilitites would be willing to support it.  Our position has been - whoever provided the best deal first, that is where the industry will take its business.

Kevin's preferences for RTO standards is not out of the question.   FERC will utlimately decide how much standards setting authority the RTOs will have.   NERC will certainly foucs - at least - on inter-RTO standards, something RTOs will not do well, if at all.  Howvever, NERC must not impede on internal RTO market structures and rules - a "commercial standard"  - this is why NERC recognizing commercial interests is such a big step.

NERC Roster

The NERC Board, at its meeting today in Vancouver, took bold steps to
expand its role for developing standards for the wholesale electric
industry in North America, to ensure the independence of actions by its
21 Security Coordinators from any wholesale or retail merchant
functions, and agreed to revamp the composition and voting structure of
its standing committees.

Attached are the relevant resolutions and policy statements approved by
the Board.

A press release concerning these actions is available on the NERC web
site.

Kevin --

Eddy Daniels is interested in coming over to UBS Reg Affairs.  He is currently in ENA Legal working primarily on M&A activities (worked last year on Cuiaba and has been working on the UBS deal).

I would like you to meet him.  He is very interested in coming over and helping out.  Will take a little educating, but I think that he can get up to speed quickly and will definitely be someone that can help us through the start-up work.

Can you talk with him tomorrow or Friday?

Jim

We need to talk about the budget.  Also, it probably makes sense to talk in more detail about who could cover.  I'm not sure if Sarah is yet at B&P.  Also, we could retain Tom Hoatson go to this meeting.

Announcing the new Single Market Design Forum

shared vision and are committed to the development of a single market. Many
market participants, state commissions and FERC have expressed a desire for
this type of common market structure.
The first meeting of the Single Market Design Forum is scheduled for Friday,
February 8, in Washington, D.C., at the FERC Building, 888 First Street,

Peggy Mahoney asked me to forward this to you.

FYI - Here is a link to the Boston Globe article I have discussed with most of you. After numerous conversations and plenty of information proving otherwise, the reporter unfortunately decided to do this article based upon recent happenings. It is clearly a cheap shot.

 

On a happier note, here is a good article about our relationship with Quaker Oats in the Chicago Sun-Times.

 

Thanks,

Peggy

Kevin --

I received this note from the EES Business Center.  Can someone from your shop follow-up?  I called this gentleman and couldn't get a definitive answer related to how the power is being generated or how much.  This may be a wild-goose chase.  I'm just not sure.

Russell would like for you to meet with him for an informational interview. An in person meeting would be preferable,
but whatever is available with your schedule is fine.  My understanding is that he is not formally looking for a job
yet, but trying to get a feel for different types of positions available within the energy industry. Erik is the son of
one of Russell's clients and will graduate from school in May.  I will try to get more color from Russell and forward it
to you.

   It looks like Tuesday morning will work best for Erik.  I am supposed to
   meet with him at 9:00 am Tuesday morning, but
   am flexible if that time works for you.  Just let me know what time is
   ideal and I will schedule it with Erik.

After thinking about this last night, I would still like to bring to the meeting today at 1pm all the documents that would be necessary for UBS to be "fully" functioning so that we can get this data in front of the UBS legal group.

Subject:	RE: UBS Sign-Off on ERCOT Docs

I understand from Smith Day that APX forwarded us today a format of contract relating to their potentially serving as QSE for UBS AG trading.  APX is apparently willing to contract on a month-to-month basis (thus allowing us to move to our own IT interface with ERCOT as soon as possible).  

As to item two below, until UBS would have the IT capability (currently under development and projected to be roughly a month from completion) to become certified to act as its own QSE, it would not need to execute any 'market participant' agreement with ERCOT in order to be a power marketer within ERCOT.  As soon as UBS desired to trade Renewable Energy Credits ("RECs"), it would need to sign a standard-form agreement with ERCOT in order to maintain a REC account. 

Trading conducted by UBS with any given counterparty within ERCOT would be pursuant to 'UBSWarburgEnergyOnline' GTCs or else subject to discrete negotiated wholesale power enabling agreements and/or ISDA master agreements. The ERCOT ISO would have no connection with such relationship documents supporting UBS AG trading activities.  On the other hand, as UBS's likely counterparties are entities with wholesale power trading activities of national scope, the timeline for trading in ERCOT is linked to the timeline for completing wholesale power/financial master enabling agreements approved by UBS.  Doug Gilbert-Smith this afternoon identified the following counterparties in decreasing order of of their priority as trading partners in ERCOT:  

TXU Energy Trading 
BP Energy Company
Reliant Energy Services, Inc.
Aquila Power Corporation
Morgan Stanley capitral Group
Constellation Power Source
FPL Energy Power Marketing, Inc.
American Electic Power Service Corporation
Mirant Americas Energy Marketing, LP
Calpine Energy Servicces LP
Dynegy Marketing & Trade
LCRA --Lower Colorado River Authority

along with a couple of incumbent utilities:

San Antonio City Public Service
Reliant HL&P

If you desire Doug Gilbert -Smith to sit in on this meeting, then it would have to be scheduled for Thursday.

Subject:	UBS Sign-Off on ERCOT Docs

UBS Legal and UBS Credit is heading to Houston this Thursday and Friday.  I have asked that ERCOT matters get 1 hour to discuss the necessary contracts that UBS will need to sign to participate in the ERCOT market.

Basically, my understanding is the following --

1.	PUCT Registration Form for Power Marketer
2.	ERCOT ISO Information
	QSE [Portz, David]   N/A until IT platform is ready for UBS to serve as its own QSE 
	LSE [Portz, David]   N/A 
	Wholesale Enabling Agreement [Portz, David]   No ERCOT  involvement 
	Other [Portz, David]   REC Trading Account Agreement  
3.	APX Agreement [Portz, David]   initially
4.	Other

Given the list of issues, this assumes that UBSW Energy will not be selling electricity at retail.  If we need this for Day 1, we would have to get an additional license from the PUCT.

Thanks,

Jim

Please find attached the latest, and what should be the final for the immediate period of time, copy of the marketing list. Please filter the PA column by your name to double-check against the list you are currently working off of. 
There are some smaller subsids of larger companies previously assigned now listed. I pulled these subs in from the credit pre-approval list. I will be passing out draft contracts folders for these counterparties tomorrow to the people responsible for the respective parent companies.
There are some companies on your lists that do not have draft packets. These companies have NOT been pre-approved by credit, but credit is working on them now. Continue to call these customers regarding password applications, but do not promise that the ISDA documents, etc. are immediately forthcoming until we receive those worksheets from credit.
Please continue to pass on both the pa information and the draft packets as you receive the correct contact info. If you have any questions at all, please call me at 5-3614 or come by my desk at 06541 in the rotunda.

Thank you,
Jennifer McQuade

Kevin --

In the Dynegy v. ComEd complaint, Dynegy states:

"Dynegy typically only sells capacity on an annual or seasonal basis for $1MM to $2 MM per 50 MW.  Dynegy does not typically sell capacity on a daily basis."

Enron's argument against Dynegy will be that the FERC network transmission agreement does not give Dynegy a right to "capacity payments."  Aside from that, maybe Enron can make a daily capacity market, since Dynegy clearly isn't making one.  (And in the meantime, we of course continue to try killing "icap")

Claudia please arrange a conference call with Tim, John and myself to discuss the method for allocation going forward.

Please note that John is in Calgary and has a 1 hour time difference and Tim is in Seattle with a 2 hour time difference.

I am amenable to many different allocation methods.  I think that John has a good point.  John, the allocation for Canada includes both Toronto and Calgary.  However, there is also an argument that there should be some fixed component and a transaction-based component.  

I think that we need to come up with one methodology that applies to Canada, West, and East.  What methodology do you guys want to use?

Since Alberta Power trades 15 times/day and East and West power trade in excess of 1000 times/day, I believe that a 10% allocation for my desk is inappropriate.  I would be willing to settle for 5% and I believe that this is more that generation/

Hi Beth,
I hate to be uncooperative, particularly after all that we have accomplished together, but I can't see where in the Enron/UBS agreement it says that Enron needs or gets to keep the West Power Fundamentals system.  Furthermore, I have no assurances that Enron is in a position to keep this information confidential as Richard Schweiger is rightfully looking for a new job.  Richard could easily understand what we are doing and use it to secure a job with AEP, Pacificorp or someone else here in town.  I don't mean to question Richard's integrity, but these are very strange times.

Until I receive word from UBS or Greg Whalley I am sitting tight.

Again, sorry to be uncooperative, but it doesn't appear to me that our interests are aligned right now and I need to protect our competitive advantage.

Regards,
Tim

All,

I have been requested to obtain a working copy of all fundamental systems.  The estate wants to preserve them and they should be available for use within the estate.

I will dedicate systems resources to working with your groups.  Your cooperation is greatly appreciated.

I will have Richard Burchfield coordinate these efforts.  Richard Schweiger will assist us in Portland.

Thanks,
Beth

Good Afternoon-

I am hoping to get your help, based on your extensive experience in the Electric Utility industry.  We are working with some VERY MOTIVATED clients who have opportunities available NOW for experienced professionals from the industry.  The clients are located in various areas across the United States- - East Coast, West Coast and various other attractive locations.

These clients are looking for SUBSTATION ENGINEERS AND DESIGN ENGINEERS.  They need experience with single line drawings and background in elevation, wiring, grounding, bus and equipment layout.  The clients have varied requirements with licences and certifications such as PE, AutoCAD and PLS CAD (Some are requiring these certifications and tools, others are not and may even provide training).

We also have some very motivated clients who are looking for experienced TRANSMISSION LINE DESIGNERS.  They are looking for people with civil experience (tower foundation, wire sagging, spotting and towers), material and technical line specs.  Background with 69kv and above, underground and overhead transmission design.  PLS CAD is a plus, PE not required.

These clients are very motivated and may be willing to look at experience that is slightly dated.  They prefer that the candidate has continued to work in the industry, but they are flexible.

Who do you know that may be able to point me to some of these people?  I would be more than happy to talk to anyone you know.  Thank you in advance for your help.  I look forward to hearing from you.

I'd like to share something with you.  I have  included a link of the manufacturer's pricing to the Dealer-by Kelley Blue  Book.(New or Pre-Owned)  This will show you that my integrity is  sincere.(click below)  There's no need to run all over town shopping for a  vehicle.  You just drive to the person who shows you the real  numbers.(Me)  By attaching the dealer cost values for you, it is obvious  that you are getting a fair deal.(Wholesale Price)  At the same time, you  are saving time and money.  I'll try to make this as easy as possible  folks.  If you are not ready at this time, that's okay!   This is  not a high pressure car buying program.  What I do ask of you is that you  WRITE DOWN & REMEMBER who got you all of the pertinent information to make  your car buying decision.(Ken Finney)  See below..
 
Some of you don't know it yet, but your company may  be a partner with Ford.  If this is the case, you may be eligible for  additional incentives.  This is applicable to New Vehicles only!  I  just need to know who you work for...
 
Trade-in Vehicles:
Here's the area where everyone is quite  skeptical.  I will give you what I call an Actual Cash Value!(yes, a real  #)  I find it much easier to deal with real numbers.  We can talk more  about this arena later if you wish.
 
I will not lose your business over price with  anyone!  Bring me a deal from another Ford Dealer and I'll beat it!   If I don't have it in-stock, I'll find it and get here!(New or  Pre-Owned)  I HAVE ACCESS TO FORD/LINCOLN/MERCURY PRODUCTS!
 
Call or email me with a valid phone number if  you're interested in discussing more of the details.  I'm on the road a lot  so please leave messages on my cell phone or with another Sales  Manager.

Lloyd, got this error message.  Is Kevin still around, if so could you forward it to him.  Hope you had a good new years and that 2002 is rewarding.  Must say i was pretty happy with the FERC order, it should still be meaningful for Enron if and when the trading operations are sold (i hear that a new owner may be revealed 1/10 and hope that that party is able to reharness the talent!!!). 

regards 

Mike

Finally have a couple of minutes to send a quick email.  I am sure that you

heard the FERC news on 12/19 about MidWest development.  Successful

conclusion to 8 months work for me and more for others...under different

circumstances it would have been the cause for celebrations in Houston

(seemed like the biggest win for Enron GA in 2001 to me but then i am

biased)!  I am happy that we got that win even if it was clouded by the

bigger issues facing the firm.  Looks like the MidWest will get one RTO and

congestion mgmt protocol....

While the news wasn't celebrated around here for obvious reasons, i also

believe that this outcome will be better for AEP in the long run.  I am

hopeful that the executives here see it the same way in time and look

forward to 2002.  Hope that things work out well for all of you, i enjoyed

the experience even if it was cut short.  Keep in touch.

regards

Mike Roan

During the IT Offsite held on 10/12/01,  we formed a team of IT and business leads to develop high level information flows within and between EES and WHS.  The team was directed to identify business areas that would benefit from the integration and potential sharing of systems.  Todd Busby and I are leading this effort.  

In summary, our 3 week project plan includes developing a baseline process and information flow diagram across EES and WHS for Jan. '02, recommendations to be implemented by June '02 and our business vision for one integrated EES/WHS system solution by June '03.  Beth Perlman provided Accenture on 10/15 to assist in the facilitation and analysis of the data gathered. 

Todd and I began the project on Monday, 10/15/01 and we will complete our initial analysis on Friday, 11/02/01 (3 week effort).  Last week we completed a project scope, schedule and initial high level information flow diagram which I have enclosed below.  In summary, we are holding approx. 5 workshops a week with the business leads in the integration team.  On Wednesday, 10/31, we will spend the day with EES/WHS IT to complete systems overlay's on our business process and information flows.  

I have sent invites for the meetings listed in the schedule below and look forward to working with you and your employees in the workshops.  

Please call me with questions and comments regarding our plan and deliverables.  

Thank you for your support on this effort.  

Debra

Kevin & Lloyd,

As we re-asses the fundamental information needed by the traders, I think t=
hat it is important to actively recruit Martin Lin to the power fundamental=
s group.=20

Martin Lin has developed and continuously improved the current short term a=
nd long-term Interconnect and Ercot models as well as played an important p=
art in bringing fourth advancements with Powerworld. He is the only person =
that has extensive and significant working familiarity with the Ercot power=
 system.   He is of significant importance if we continue to make any chang=
es or improvements to the current Interconnect and Ercot models.  His knowl=
edge extends beyond the process of the flow of electricity and the transmis=
sion of power to include the ability to program in C++ and VBA.  In regards=
 to Powerworld, he has both academic and practical expertise as well as a t=
echnical understanding of the functionality of the program. He has been lea=
ding the advancements with Powerworld in order to tie in powerworld with th=
e interconnect models as well as utilize powerworld to conduct contingencie=
s analysis and automatic ATC calculations.   Another area of expertise is h=
is knowledge of options.  He has worked on  options models for broadband  s=
ervices.=20

If you have any questiosns in regards to the impact of his continbutions, p=
lease feel free to contact myself or Steve Benchluch.=20

Thank You

Rika Imai

As we near the end of the year, I want to make clear some individual VAR limits I have come up with as we go forward.  These will change from time to time as to allocate VAR to desks that are profitable and re-adjust VAR when desks are not profitable.  Please read carefully.  If you have any questions feel free to see me.  There will be penalties for not staying within your VAR limits.  I will be reasonable but fines will be assessed for repeated breakage.

The info is reasonably well protected, but it is potentially subject to disclosure to other parties.  I have a call in to Christi to see if she's found out which types of entities can get access.  In any event, the information will not be identified as having been submitted by Enron.

I hope I haven't taken you in a circle, I just wanted to make sure that it is clear that some entities may have access to our pricing, but they won't know for sure that it is Enron's pricing.

Kevin,

I spoke with the lawyer representing Entergy, and he indicated that their intention is to provide redacted bid information to the PUC under a protective order.  Excluded from their submittal will be any identifying information about each of the bidders. Their lawyer said that Enron's bid sheet (without identifying info) and contract comments (with no identifying info) would be submitted. Obviously, pricing info will be included.  In order to acquire the filed information, someone must qualify as a "Party" and must agree to be bound by the terms of the protective order.  Heather tells me Christi Nicolay was looking into the definition of "Party".  I do not know if our competitors could qualify as Parties, but if they do, then common sense tells me that we should, too. At this point we should assume that they will get the redacted information.

Seems like Entergy is doing what they can to protect the info, and our only choice I can think of would be to withdraw our bid.  Heather tells me we want to go forward.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Kay

Kevin,
After reviewing the list of NRC meetings coming up, Fred has notified me of
the two he thinks are of significance for attendance.  They are:

1. 11/30/01 - Surry 1, 2 - Discuss significance of failed piston wrist pins
& piston carrier bearings in the Number 3 Emergency Diesel Generator which
may have caused it to fail if needed to operate a long period.
HGP Comment: This may give insight on Surry 1 refueling and possible
shutdown of Surry 2 for mitigation of problem.  This will also impact other
plants with the same EDGs.

2. 12/12/01 - Ginna - Discuss status of RG&E evaluation regarding
circumferential cracking of the reactor vessel head penetration nozzles.
HGP Comment: This should provide info on whether Ginna will be required to
shutdown for inspection and additional info on other area PWRs concerning
shutdown inspection schedules.

Please let me know if you agree that we should attend. Currently we have
attended seven meetings of the eight allowed by the contract through
November.  None of the meetings for early December are of significance.  It
is highly unlikely that any significant meetings will be scheduled for late
December.  So, the above two meetings should probably be the last of
significance for the calendar year.

Dan

Morgan has no offer on this.  They aren't comfortable offering at the Duval substation at this point.

Subject: RE: RTO Week -- Summary of Standards and Practices Panel


RTO Week

 <?xml:namespace prefix =3D o ns =3D "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:offi=
ce" />

Day 4 - October 18, 2001

Afternoon Session

=20

Standardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices=20

Panelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy =
Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Chr=
istiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC Gene=
ral Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnes=
ota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Co=
mpany.

=20


General Observations


=20

The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left la=
te in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, t=
he commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of=
 all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; =
much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seeme=
d very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry fo=
rward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover for=
ward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize tha=
t some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed t=
o be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was d=
iscussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the=
 reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticea=
ble conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two org=
anizations somewhat common during the discussions.=20

=20


FERC Deliverables


A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne=
eded from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they =
felt was critical. =20

The first major topic was "How many RTOs?  What is their scope?"  All panel=
ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b=
y FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific langua=
ge, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.

The next topic was, "What will be standard market design?"  Panelists varie=
d on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged f=
or one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid sta=
ndard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (=
followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the curre=
nt situation.

The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha=
t the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic=
 throughout their discussions, asking questions like, "Do we need to issue =
a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?" and, "How much detail do you=
 need us to provide?"   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they =
wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as t=
o say FERC should "Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a=
 little further."  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, bu=
t in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and t=
he need for cautious investigation. =20

One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc=
heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th=
e "RTO Design and RTO Implementation" section would address many of the que=
stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Korm=
os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying =
a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The se=
ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following =
questions:


?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occu=
r, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i=
s nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there=
 be others that must be accommodated?


?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to sch=
edule ("covered" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protect=
ing from congestion charges (both "covered" and "uncovered" schedules are a=
llowed)?=20


?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission =
services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues=
 to be addressed?


?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing pr=
ior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to reti=
re those contracts?  Are there other solutions?


?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function?=
 Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules)=
, be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced sche=
dules), or will they be required at all?


?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed =
in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary=
 services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as fina=
ncial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?


?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses? =
 Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce=
ss, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technical=
ly unwieldy?


?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrate=
d into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that =
non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to t=
reat each NJE as a separate entity?


Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica=
l questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which =
to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions=
, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., "do congestion management") will t=
ake a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., "LMP with financi=
al hedging instruments") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike =
about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible =
to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.

Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) refer=
red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati=
on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out=
 said, "My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't =
believe that that statement is true."  He then backpedaled a bit and said t=
hat it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assert=
ion by the Northwest interests was false.


NERC and GISB


A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-se=
tting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, "Are we looking at a bea=
uty contest between NERC and GISB?"  Cook and Boswell then went into severa=
l short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants cont=
inually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interesting=
ly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI=
SB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the "new" structure of NERC and=
 did not focus on its history.

Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a=
sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were=
 they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily a=
ble to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin=
g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Poin=
t, Brownell.

Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-m=
an.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's suppos=
ed "successes," such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will =
likely remember that these "successes" have not been so successful, resulti=
ng in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments=
 in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show=
 the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.

There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues=
, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some =
talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.

The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly ur=
ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade=
rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC s=
omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would=
 say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Kevin,

Please identify which trader will be managing the locations you have listed below so we can have the system fully tested as soon as possible.  I understand that we will be using peak and off-peak only for the locations below.  We will work with the trader of the Ontario location and Leslie Hansen to develop this location, as we do not have anything in the system for this yet.  Thanks, in advance, for your response.

Kevin

Bill -- My understanding was that Enron had satisfied PJM's credit requirements last week; however, below is a notice that the bill has not been paid and Enron will not be able to participate in PJM markets if the bill is not paid by 11/27 COB.
 
Please let us know if Gov't Affairs needs to call PJM to try to discuss this.  Christi 37007.

There are materials of the Trans-elect website that details the CMS purchase,  http://www.trans-elect.com/. Under a Q&A section is the following:

Q: Will Trans-Elect put the METC transmission system in an RTO?
A: Yes, in accordance with FERC requirements that all systems must join an RTO.
Q: Which RTO will Trans-Elect choose?
A: Either the Midwest Independent System Organization (MISO) or the Alliance will be selected. Trans-Elect has 40 days from the announcement to make a selection. Trans-Elect is assessing the two organizations to make a determination as to which one will best serve the interests of Michigan consumers.

Looks like there was substance to the Consumers energy rumour.  Consumers are currently part of Alliance, the fact that the new owner wanted to make a decision on RTOs suggests that they are moving to MISO (they would have looked at the ARTO structure as part of due diligence).  Will let you know when the decision is made.

regards
Mike

While seemingly small in the scheme of things these days at Enron, on 12/14/01 EPMI did get a FERC win against MISO's proposed $1000 fee for each non-confirmed transmission service request for firm PTP of one week or longer.  FERC used our (In house written) argument almost verbatim!

GTC personnel told us that NETCO will not be able to obtain transmission on GTC until EPMI's bill is paid.  We will address this issue further with GTC after a formal submission of a transmission request from NETCO.  

Valid or not, this could delay implementation of transmission on GTC.

Will you be providing additional information to support these numbers before the meeting on your per person costs and how we are charged overhead etc.
 
Also why only the numbers in the blue.  We have not agreed to the rest?  I have also seen numbers that are quite different and several of these projects are not required as well as some are overpriced.
 
Also how will the allocation between east, west and canada be done for these single line items.
 
Thanks.

I have received several questions from the floor regarding the subject topic.  Here is what I know as of 2:00 today.  This is an evolving process.  Please distribute this note as appropriate:

All movement of 'data' from Enron to UBS is subject to legal approval.  Legal is developing policy guidelines that will govern what and how much data individual users and the IT department can move.

Data can be defined as application data (source code, executables, scripts, etc...), business data (curves, prices, deals, weather forecasts, etc...), and office documents (spreadsheets, word files, etc...)

Data is housed in many different places, including desktop C drives, individual network H drives, common file servers (O/M/R/W drives), database servers, application servers, and web servers. 

Several steps have already been completed:

The physical file server environments for UBS have been established.
The physical DB server environments for UBS have been established.
The physical application and web server environments for UBS have been established.
Some file server directories have already been copied.  This was limited to data (executables, risk excel sheets, etc...) necessary for IT to test our critical applications in the new UBS production environment.
Our large EnPower and TDS Oracle databases were also copied for application testing.

Where do we stand?

I am maintaining, and have distributed to this group, an inventory of all software and hardware components associated with our Power application portfolio.  The inventory includes specific common file server directories that are necessary for our Power apps to run.  We have received input from several business owners in this area.
Legal and IT are collaborating on a process for moving file server data. (H/O/M/R/W)  We are expecting a process definition within days, given our Day 0 target of February 6th.  (legal integration date)
At this time, it sounds like individual UBS employees will participate in identifying files on the various file server drives listed above and signing a document specifying that that data movement adheres to legal policy guidelines.  Individuals may even be asked to physically move (drag and drop) files from the old Enron drives to UBS holding drives.  This is still under discussion.
We have made some basic assumptions about the amount of business data to be moved to UBS.  I have provided Tim, Kevin, and Lloyd an overview of these assumptions.  This is also still under discussion.

I will schedule a meeting in the next couple of days to discuss this, and other transition issues, in more detail.

Thanks, Steve

Rika,
Here are a couple of meetings that might be interesting:

MEETING 1.  10/24/01 - A meeting to discuss Davis-Besse's (ECAR) proposal to
defer required reactor vessel head penetration inspections to their April
2002 refueling outage.  This is interesting because due to the recent
discoveries of cracked and leaking vessel head penetrations (like that at
Oconee 3), all PWRs are required by Bulletin 2001-01 to perform inspections
and provide information related to the structural integrity of the upper
reactor pressure vessel head penetration nozzles to ensure the integrity of
the reactor coolant system pressure boundary and to demonstrate compliance
with applicable regulatory requirements.  Davis-Besse, however, wants to
defer this inspection/assurance information until their refueling outage in
the Spring of 2002.  The NRC has 4 categories of plants according to risk
for penetration cracking.  They are:
1. Plants that already experienced cracks (Oconee 1, 2, 3; ANO 1; Cook 2)
2. Plants that are considered with high susceptibility (Davis-Besse, and six
other plants)
3. Plants that are considered with moderate susceptibility (32 plants)
4. Plants that are considered with low susceptibility
So, with Davis-Besse in the high susceptible category, the NRC may require
them to provide assurance requiring an inspection and therefore an outage.

MEETING 2.  10/25/01 - The day after the above meeting is a meeting
concerning the Pebble Bed reactor.  This is the reactor type that Exelon is
pushing for construction and use in the US.  Exelon will be discussing with
the NRC the biggest possible "showstopper" for the design--the graphite
coolant.  Graphite can burn (e.g. Chernobyl).  However, pebble bed
proponents say it is unlikely.  The NRC should provide info on their
concerns and leanings which would steer Exelon one way or another.

So far this contract year, we have attended two meetings.  That leaves us
currently with a backlog of four meetings through this month and a rate of
use of .67 meetings per month which would make the projected use for the
year of about eight of the 24 meetings allowed in the contract.  If we
attend the above two meetings, the backlog would be down to two; the rate
would be 1.33 per month; and the projected yearend total would still be only
about 16.

Let me know as soon as possible since meeting #1 is scheduled for tomorrow
so I would need to make plans.
Thanks,
Dan

Jurisdictional Disputes Intensify
As FERC Seeks to Extend Its Authority=20



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis=20


  <http://secure.scientech.com/rci/wsimages/will100border_copy.jpg>

[News item from Dow Jones] The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (F=
ERC) kicks off a week of workshops today as part of its effort to reframe r=
ules requiring utilities to turn control of their power-grid assets to inde=
pendent management. The controversial effort to carve up the nation's elect=
ricity system under control of four or five regional transmission organizat=
ions (RTOs) is a top objective for FERC Chairman Pat Wood III. The workshop=
s, dubbed "RTO Week," were called by FERC to garner what Wood calls "buy in=
" for the effort, which is encountering stiff opposition from some utilitie=
s, state regulators and members of Congress.=20

Analysis: The objective of this week's workshops may be to gain support fro=
m the industry for FERC's controversial mandate, but they are also having t=
he effect of casting light on what is a growing debate over FERC's jurisdic=
tional boundaries. The issue has become rather evenly divided. On one side,=
 critics say that FERC has gone too far in its most recent RTO order, which=
 as noted has become somewhat of a "cause c?l?bre" for new Chairman Wood. O=
n the other hand, supporters say Wood has breathed new life into the commis=
sion and is taking an important step to ensure equal access for all power s=
uppliers into the nation's transmission system. By Wood's own directive, th=
e discrepancy over how far FERC can extend its regulatory oversight into wh=
at were previously considered state or utility matters is reaching a boilin=
g point, as a Dec. 15 deadline that carries stiff penalties for resistant u=
tilities is fast approaching.=20

Certainly, the arrival of Pat Wood as FERC chairman (after replacing Curt H=
?bert last month) has signaled a new era for the federal commission, which =
oversees much of the energy industry's wholesale market and the nation's po=
wer grid. As noted, Pat Wood has made the formation of RTOs one of his key =
objectives. Wood recently demonstrated that FERC would become much more int=
erventionist when he declared a deadline of Dec. 15, by which time transmis=
sion-owning electric utilities across the country must submit plans to join=
 an existing RTO in one of four large regional entities. Using what he has =
referred to as a "big stick," Wood warned that failing to comply with the D=
ec. 15 deadline would cost transmission-owning utilities their right to cha=
rge market-based rates for power and could delay any merger proceedings in =
which the utilities might become engaged.=20

This issue alone has drawn a line in the sand, but has also sparked an inte=
nse debate on the regulatory power that FERC should be given in the deregul=
ating energy market. Standing up to lead the effort to put more constraints=
 on FERC's authority are many state regulatory officials and congressional =
leaders, who view the commission as stepping into areas in which they tradi=
tionally have been the sole jurisdictional gatekeepers. State regulators, p=
articularly from Southern states where electricity prices remain comparativ=
ely low, argue that that their system is working just fine the way it is. S=
uch states want to retain their present regulatory oversight (rather than c=
ompletely forfeit control of these assets over to FERC), and also believe t=
hat now is not the time to be making huge changes to the way in which the n=
ation's transmission system is managed. Also in question is the extent to w=
hich regulatory conflicts may arise between state and federal commissioners=
 if FERC is successful in mandating very large and broad RTOs that transcen=
d state boundaries.=20

Southern Company is one utility that has refuted FERC's authority to force =
it to participate in an RTO. In its July order, FERC directed Southern Comp=
any (along with the Southwest Power Pool, Entergy Corp. and Grid South) to =
form a single RTO for the Southeast region, most likely adopting a structur=
e modeled after Grid South. However, Southern Company already has sunk abou=
t $3 billion into its own 26,000-mile system, over which it wants to retain=
 independent control.=20

FERC has said that the formation of regional RTOs will result in significan=
t cost savings for customers because the barriers to competitively priced e=
lectricity will be removed and transmission costs will be reduced. However,=
 Southern Company claims that the cost to establish a large regional RTO co=
uld run as high as $100 million, which could be passed on to customers in t=
he form of higher rates. Southern also disagrees with FERC from a philosoph=
ical point of view and questions whether or not the commission's vision of =
four regional RTOs will truly make transmission activity more efficient. On=
e of Southern's concerns is that the four regional RTOs could become too la=
rge and end up operating like monopolies. Ironically, the issue has caused =
dissension between Southern and its former subsidiary Mirant, which as an i=
ndependent power producer seeks equal access to the transmission grid. Whil=
e Southern disagrees with FERC's authority to force RTO participation, Mira=
nt supports the federal government's efforts to streamline transmission act=
ivity.=20

Leaders of RTO West-the transmission entity in which FERC wants to include =
the transmission assets of states in the Northwest, Southwest and Californi=
a-also question the value of a large regional entity and are resisting FERC=
's authority to mandate this structure. Leaders in the region have said tha=
t the formation of RTO West would result in substantially higher rates, con=
sidering that the Northwest transmission grid currently lacks the capacity =
to meet high demand in the area. In other words, although FERC may be endor=
sing market-based rates for those transmission-owning utilities that join R=
TOs, some transmission grids remain unstable and may not be ready for incre=
ased activity.=20

Nevertheless, along with Mirant stand fellow generating companies such as D=
ynegy and Enron, which have sunk billions into building merchant facilities=
 and want to ensure that they have access to transmission systems. Hence, t=
hese companies agree with FERC's emphasis on RTO formations, as generation =
companies want to ensure that control of transmission facilities is moved f=
rom utilities to independent management companies.=20

In addition to the RTO issue, the bankruptcy proceedings of Pacific Gas & E=
lectric Co. have also brought the issue of state versus federal jurisdictio=
nal authority to a head. The utility's parent PG&E Corp. is pursuing a "rin=
g fencing" strategy in the restructuring related to the bankruptcy proceedi=
ngs of Pacific Gas & Electric Co. Put simply, PG&E Corp. is trying to prote=
ct other valuable assets by transferring them into a new, federally regulat=
ed subsidiary. The restructuring plan has raised jurisdictional issues beca=
use the California Public Utility Commission, which presently regulates the=
 utility operations of Pacific Gas & Electric Co., believes that it has the=
 right to approve the transfer of assets into a new subsidiary. Further, th=
e state government in California believes that PG&E Corp.'s plan would give=
 too much regulatory control to FERC, and by the same token reduce the amou=
nt of control that California would have over generation assets that are pr=
esently contained in a regulated subsidiary.=20

The complicated issues surrounding how far FERC should be allowed to extend=
 its regulatory authority are presently working their way through the feder=
al legal system. In fact, last week the Supreme Court began hearing argumen=
ts from federal lawyers, state regulators and private industry, addressing =
not only FERC's authority to mandate RTOs but also the commission's 1996 or=
der that required utilities to provide equal access to their transmission s=
ystems. Measures are also moving through Congress that would clarify the Fe=
deral Power Act to explicitly give FERC the authority to mandate participat=
ion in an RTO. At present, the commission had danced around the issue by ca=
lling for "voluntary" participation, yet still affixing stiff penalties for=
 utilities that refuse to comply.=20

In addition, Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas), chairman of the Energy and Air Qual=
ity Subcommittee, is reportedly working on a broad electric restructuring b=
ill that he hopes to introduce during this congressional session (which cou=
ld prove difficult as legislators want to close the current session by earl=
y November). Barton is a strong supporter of RTOs, and his draft bill repor=
tedly would give FERC the ability to order RTO membership for public and pr=
ivate utilities that own power lines. At the same time, however, it is beli=
eved that Barton's draft bill would give utilities the option for an expedi=
ted federal court hearing if they disagree with FERC's order, which again w=
ould further temper the extent to which FERC has unrestricted authority on =
transmission issues.=20

Moreover, Congress and federal courtrooms may be the best venues for this d=
ebate over FERC's authority as disputes between state and federal regulator=
y oversight are sure to increase as thorny deregulation issues emerge. Howe=
ver, given FERC's deadline of Dec. 15 for RTO participation, the issue has =
gained a sense of urgency as big utilities such as Southern Company dig in =
their heels and rebuff the federal commission's mandate.=20

DYNEGY ISSUES STATEMENT ON ENRON MERGER STATUS

HOUSTON (Nov. 21, 2001) -- Dynegy Inc. (NYSE: DYN) Chairman and CEO Chuck W=
atson today said he is encouraged by Enron Corp.'s report this morning that=
 it has closed the remaining $450 million credit facility secured by the as=
sets of Northern Natural Gas Pipeline and has received a commitment from it=
s lead bank to extend the $690 million note payable obligation described in=
 Enron's recent 10-Q filing.

"We are continuing our confirmatory due diligence and working to accelerate=
 the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger in accordance wit=
h the previously announced agreement," he said.

Watson also noted that ChevronTexaco recently reiterated that it has "full =
confidence in Dynegy's disciplined management approach to complete the merg=
er and to build a new company into an industry leader."  ChevronTexaco owns=
 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.

Dynegy Inc. is one of the world's top energy merchants.  Through its global=
 energy delivery network and marketing, trading and risk management capabil=
ities, Dynegy provides innovative solutions to customers in North America, =
the United Kingdom and Continental Europe.

to vary from those Dynegy expects include changes in commodity prices for e=
nergy or communications products or services; the timing and extent of dere=
gulation of energy markets in the U.S. and Europe; the timing of required a=
pprovals for the Dynegy/Enron merger and the success of integration and cos=

Christi Nicolay and Sarah Novosel are the two best regulatory people.   In terms of pushing the timing, political clout is going to be more important which in the past would have come from Kean and Lay.   Obviously, that will not work anymore.   I have a good relationship with Larcamp (FERC head of Staff) and might be able to help with the politics.   I think FERC is going to want to hear directly from  the new owner.   If we want speed, I recommend we use the expertise of Christi and Sarah combined with the overall political clout of the new owner.

You are not off base with Steffes at all.

I've never been a big fan of Shapiro, however, I wonder if he could help with the speed of the regulatory process.  Steffes seems to talk more than act.  Am I way off base.

My issues with Rick have never been related to competence but were based on costs of his unit.

Subject:	Estate Fundamentals 


Lloyd and Tim H,   There is still some question about the amount and timing of fundamentals capability that will be required in the Enron Estate.  To date, our working assumption has been that all fundamentals systems (data harvesting, portals, metastock, decision support cubes, etc...) would only be operational in NetCo.  There is no IT staffing in estate to support fundamentals.

Beth Perlman told me today that Jim Fallon has indicated that we need to have IT people in estate who have the ability to bring up our fundamentals capability for the East and West Desks.

A few questions...  Do you agree?  If so, I can have our East Desk fundamentals team begin knowledge transfer to estate IT personnel.  I'll work with Beth on candidates.  Can this requirement be met for West Desk fundamentals?  If so, how would we proceed?  Who would be involved?

Thanks,  Steve

Rika,
Just to let you know a couple of things:
1. The NRC (Chairman Meserve's executive assistant) called us specifically =
today to let us know the daily plant status was back.  However, they said t=
hey are still in a test mode and the data may not all be there and what's t=
here may not all be accurate.  They are still working toward having everyth=
ing up and rolling perfect by the end of the month (although it seems they =
will improve on that target).

2. The Indian Point 2 meeting was about what we expected.  The NRC has a li=
ttle more confidence in the way Entergy is proceeding than it had in Con Ed=
ison.  However, IP2 remains the only plant in the country with multiple deg=
raded cornerstones in the NRC's reactor oversight process, and is still wea=
k in several of those areas including: Design Configuration Control, Human =
Performance, Equipment Reliability, Emergency Preparedness, and Corrective =
Actions.  One of the major disadvantages that Entergy has with IP2 is its l=
ocation in the Northeast (Anti-nuke country).  There were more than 120 peo=
ple at the meeting, of which about half were general public.  The public wa=
s not friendly and voiced complaints and protests against the quality of op=
eration.  While this of itself will not hurt Entergy's operation efforts, i=
t does bear heavily on the NRC's attitude toward the plant.  The NRC does n=
ot want to be embarrassed as it has in the past (most notably with Millston=
e).  If Entergy loses ground in their recovery efforts especially in the ar=
ea of security, the NRC will step in to take more drastic action.

Dan

Kevin, Rogers, and Dana -- We do not have to do or say anything since, per NEPOOL, Enron is in compliance.  However, if you feel that NEPOOL participants are not trading with us and we need to make some statement, we can (if ok with legal).  Let us know. Thanks.

I got a call today from Ed McKenna, the ISO-NE treasurer.  He is getting a large volume of calls from NEPOOL Participants concerned about Enron Corp's credit rating.  He is telling these Participants that his office only monitors whether NEPOOL members EPMI and EES are in compliance with the NEPOOL Financial Assurance Policy, which they are, and does not monitor Enron Corp.  Ed suggested that when PG&E experienced difficulties PG&E drafted a short notice, which ISO-NE circulated, explaining how its subsidiaries were not affected by the credit rating of the parent.  The ISO is offering us the same opportunity to draft and circulate something similar if we wish.

What may be going on here is a concern by NEPOOL Participants that we are using a parent guaranty to meet the Financial Assurance Policy.  My recollection, however, is that we have instead posted surety bonds from AA agencies to meet NEPOOL credit requirements.  If we disclosed this to the NEPOOL Participants it might allay their credit concerns.  We may however, not want to disclose this if we are employing parent guarantees elsewhere, lest we be asked to post surety bonds everywhere.  Can you discuss this with the traders and see what they want to do?

RESPONSE DUE TO SERC OFFICE BY OCTOBER  22, 2001  
SERC Engineering Committee Representatives
It is time to determine member voting rights and membership  assessments for the year 2002. Again this year, we will calculate these  percentages based on the formula agreed to at the April 27, 1994 meeting of the  SERC Board of Directors:
    V = 10 ( 1/N) + 30(B/C) + 30(D/E) +  30(F/G)
where,
    V = % of Voting Rights
    N = Total number of Members
    B = Member's previous-year internal peak  demand
    C = Total of factor B for all  Members
    D = Member's generating capacity as of  January 1 of the reporting year
    E = Total of factor D for all  Members
    F = Sum of circuit miles of transmission  times the respective operating voltage for facilities of 69 kV and above as of  December 31 of the previous year
    G = Total of factor F for all  Members
 
The required data are: 
1) Peak Demand for the calendar year 2000, 
2) Total Capacity owned as of January 1, 2001, and  
3) Circuit miles of transmission owned as of December 31,  2000.
As a precaution, remember that 1) generation under joint  ownership, 2) generation belonging to non-members of SERC, and 3) non-utility  generation will have to be coordinated between the involved  parties.
The attached worksheet contains the information that I  have in my database for 2001. 
Please update this worksheet and return to me (tglaze@serc1.org ) no later than October  22.
Thank You.

Subject:	East Power Meeting

We need to meet on Wednesday, the 2nd, at 2:00 pm (in the big conference on the sixth floor in ECS) to go back through the East Power contracts that we will continue to serve either through the pools or under bilateral deals.  Given the drill we went through today in preparing for the January schedules in PJM and NEPOOL, it became apparent we need to get all the team members on the same page and make sure we have a good system for notifying all relevant parties of terminations, changes, etc.

Bill/Ed - Can you please run the most recent DPR for non-terminated East Power contracts.

Casey and Stacey - will you please update the spreadsheet that you ran for Kevin last week.

Let's make sure we all agree on contracts that have been terminated.  As most of you probably have seen, a number of terminations have been received in the past several days (see below).

United Illuminating - effective January 1, 2002
HQ Energy Services - effective January 1, 2002
First Energy Solutions - effective January 2, 2002
Old Dominion - effective January 10, 2002 - we should schedule in PJM through the 10th of January (do we have any other positions with Old Dominion).
Ameren Energy
GPU Energy - effective January 21, 2002 - we should schedule in PJM through the 21st of January (they may push back, but we should remind them that they will be subject to LDs).

Thanks,

Don

Subject:	RE: Interest Rates

Following the discussions I have had with Louise and Jay, this is the proposed solution to the interest rate risk management in NEWCO. 

1. For the first few weeks ( to a few months) we continue to use Infinity to update the curves at 2 PM. I will need to have one trader to execute, mark curves and do any deals for foreign exchange (Cd$ etc.). Louise, I hope you have this in your budget and headcount. I will need one junior trader(and maybe two as things grow) to help do this job.  I have lined up one of the guys in the old trading desk, if this goes forward.

2. In the first few weeks, Jay Webb and myself are hoping to acquire a lighter, and much simpler interest rate package which will allow us to do what we do, with significantly lower costs. We also will re-design the way we aggregate interest rate risk in the commodity books, to make it simpler and easier. To ensure there is no more discussion ever of drift-reallocation, I propose a method where, every desk head gets back his complete interest rate portfolio drift every month or quarter (less any transaction expenses ).  I would expect that, the interest rate curve shift will be small till we build a somewhat longer dated portfolio, while the drift could start becoming substantial pretty quickly (as we start making money).

Hope this answers the questions. We will have the curves at the right time, done by the trading group. We will still measure and manage our own exposure to both interest rates and currencies.  We intend to allocate small VAR to that risk management. We would deal primarily with one or two counterparties - the parent bank and a couple of futures brokers to manage the risk.  

Just to be very clear, while I am happy to manage this risk (with extra help), I am primarily  interested in the running of power options and structured products.

PS - I cant find Jeffrey Gossett in the email system, Stacey can you forward the email to him ( I dont know if he is an Ene employee)

John/Louise -

Given that under the current plan, the bank will be trading our interest rate risk,  I doubt we are taking an interest rate trader to Newco.  In order to get the books run we will need an interest rate curve.  

Should I plan on just getting access to Reuters and setting a curve off of LIBOR on my own?

He wanted over 100k and be made a manager. So johny and kim were looking at a standard associate package.

Before we completed anything for you to approve he took his other ofer and told us not to work on a offer.

He left me a voice Mail that was rather shallow.  Beats me!

The streaks are over for Florida State, and so is another run at the national championship.

Ken Dorsey threw three touchdown passes and No. 2 Miami pulled away with a 28-point third quarter in a dominating 49-27 victory over the Seminoles on Saturday.

The loss ended No. 14 Florida State's 54-game home unbeaten streak as well as its 37-game winning streak at Doak Campbell Stadium dating to 1991, when the Hurricanes beat them 17-16.

"I don't care if the game was played in Alaska, it's just great to beat Florida State," Miami offensive line coach Art Kehoe said. "We'll take a victory against them anywhere we can get it."

  RTO Week
Day 2 -- October 16, 2001
Transmission Planning & Expansion
The afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion. The pane=
lists were: Jose Degado--CEO American Transmission Company, Michael Dworkin=
--Chair Vermont PSC, Mark Maher--VP Transmission Business Line, Bonneville =
Power Administration, Lara Manz--PSE&G, Masheed Rosenqvist--National Grid, =
Steve Walton--Enron.
General Observations
The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from t=
ime to time.  Commissioner's Breathitt and Massey were the most active in q=
uestioning.  The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initi=
al presentations, moving along the discussion by asking questions.  There w=
as some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management, howev=
er, there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmiss=
ion rights.  There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the R=
TO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market (wh=
ere are problems, how might they be solved, etc.) and that the where possib=
le that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit.  Ther=
e was a good deal of discussion of "least cost planning" and the identifica=
tion of options which are not transmission related.  All agreed there had t=
o be backstop authority to build transmission, however then the challenge i=
s who pays for it, which raises the need for dispute resolution. =20
Opening Statements
Jose Delgado: ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system op=
erator.  They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met.  They =
were formed by divestiture by IOUS, coops and munis and with a $500 million=
 asset base initially. Their current ten year plan will add $1billion of in=
vestment.   Their top priorities are connecting generation and load. =20
Michael Dworkin: Because transmission is a common good, construction affect=
s all parties not just one party.  The environmental and permitting of line=
s requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view.  The ide=
a of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multi-state project=
s, although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been us=
ed by FCC.  State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which=
 must be considered.
Mark Maher: FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when =
considering congestion management.  LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems =
with their multiple use obligations.  RTO West is developing a planning pro=
cess which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in =
the future.  The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process.
Laura Manz: The various aspects of planning are connected.  Pricing (LMP) i=
s the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and re=
sources.   No competitor should have an advantage over another.  The RTO ne=
eds a central planning process but it shouldn't push solutions.  The market=
 should decide on solutions. =20
Masheed Rosenqvist: The morning discussion of congestion management talked =
about hedging against risk.  The planning discussion is not about what we h=
ave now, but about how to avoid future congestion.  The Commission has take=
n conflicting positions in different cases.  The issues that need to be ans=
wered are:  How can merchant transmission be compensated?  Should transmiss=
ion projects be open to RFPs?  Is FERC open to market based pricing for exp=
ansions? =20
Steve Walton:  The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to =
settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that h=
as frozen transmission investment.  The RTO debate has been going on for 5 =
years or more and needs to be settled.  For expansion to go forward, there =
needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party.  Y=
ou are always going to have muddy issues in planning.  For instance if a 13=
8 kV line is all that is needed to day, but future considerations of scare =
right-of-way say a 345 kV line should be built, who pays for the extra cost=
.  In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dis=
pute resolution process, appeal able to FERC, to decide such matters.
Discussion
Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current cong=
estion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose.=
  Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built=
 with the beneficiaries funding.  Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about =
use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say=
 this is the best solution, i.e. least cost planning.  This lead to discuss=
ion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so=
 they can make intelligent decisions. =20
Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was (a) under built and =
needed lots of expansion so don't worry about overbuilding or (b) transmiss=
ion planning should consider all options before construction of new facilit=
ies.  The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the =
process.  Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions.  L=
aura Manz felt that the term "under built" is a secondary effect of not hav=
ing proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties.
Dick O'Neil asked if LMP will work in the West.  Mark Maher said it wouldn'=
t.  Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics, they manage h=
ydro facilities in PJM.  Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure=
 of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought n=
ot to be rejected just intelligently designed.  BPA is looking pricing mode=
l but LMP won't work.  Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch,=
 but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some "twea=
ks" like bilaterals and allow operator self-schedule output levels to permi=
t  river coordination.  Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to max=
imize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis.  PJM has hydro, =
but not 70% as in the Northwest.  Implementation will be different because =
such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro a=
nd base load coal.
In the summation at the end of the panel, four principles were listed:  (1)=
 RTO must provide information, (2) RTO should identify solutions, (3) RTO s=
hould be unbiased and (4) the RTO should be accountable.  The disagreement =
was over the last two points, Michael Dworkin felt that #3 (unbiased) was c=
ritical and that #4 (accountability) was accomplished by having regulators =
involved in governance.  Jose Delgado said and Transco can't be unbiased si=
nce it provides services, although the ISO above it can be, but accountabil=
ity is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake.  This last =
point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the =
tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues.

>From the SE trans FERC status report (Southern, etal and now Entergy):

"The SETrans Sponsors support the establishment of a market structure utilizing LMP and financial transmission rights."

SETrans is beginning its new customer meetings/RTO process in Atlanta this month.  Hopefully, SE Trans will file something fairly decent with FERC and become an RTO in the next several years!

Kevin -

Just want to double check that Harry has declined the contract and offer letter from UBS.  

I have a letter that David handed over which states he was declining the contract, but wanted to remain an employee at will.

Sorry for double checking, but just wanted to close the loop.

Thanks!
Amy

Rogers,

As discussed before, we will be committing resources to site profile ERCOT physical switching. However, we need to have appropriate data (consumption, facility, and rate schedule etc.) submitted to us in a standardized format for site profiling. A dedicated Data Capture team similar to Brad Atherton's team for Project Phoenix would work very well. Putting together data capture team quickly, in my mind, is key for the success of the project.

Please note that Site Profile Desk will have to deal with triple the amount of recent work load (new origination, Project Phoenix, CA re-booking, Project Guadalupe etc.) in the next two months. Even though, we are implementing significant systems improvements to reduce processing time, these systems will not be ready until Dec 15th. In order to manage site profiling, I request that the data be fed to us in a relatively smooth manner. Since there are a lot of players involved in getting this done, I recommend agreeing upon a process and identifying single point of responsibility from each Desk / Group involved. Thanks.

Mallik

Rogers, 

Here's a summary of today's meeting and other discussions I've had with the parties involved.

Does everyone have the information they need?
Services Management - TBD. Scott Massey is compiling a list of all non mass market ERCOT deals. 
Site Profile Desk - No. Need to know which accounts have IDR meters. Need consumption data in a standard format from Services Management
Load Profile Desk - No. Need historical usage information on all deals.
Power Desk - Yes, except for deal lists.
Scheduling - Yes
Settlements - No. Need clarification from ERCOT/EPMI regarding which meters have switched and when they switched. 
CSC - No. Need detailed information regarding which costs to pass through to customers. Need information regarding how to bill non-standard deals.
IT - No. Need accurate deal information from RPS. 
All - Need the deal list from Services Management
Who is communicating with the ISO?
EPMI Scheduling
EPMI Settlements/Volume Management
CSC 
Do we have all the data we need for the customers?
TBD. Once we get the deal list from Services Management, we should be able to make a determination.
What are the deadlines for notification? Dates are subject to change due to decisions pending at ERCOT
Deal Capture - Need deal sheets by December 5th. 
CSC - Need deal sheets by December 15th. 

We have a plan in place to gather the necessary information and are confident that all of our customers will be switched on 1/1/2002 (or the next meter read date).

Please let me know if you would like more detail.

I assume we are doing everything necessary to insure that we will have all of our customers switched for 1/1/02.  If anyone knows any different then please speak up now.  In all seriousness, we cannot accept mistakes or slip-ups on this one.  The pilot transfers appear to have been much more difficult than I would have anticipated.

Does everyone have the info they need?
Who is communicating with the ISO?
DO we have all of the data we need for the customers?
What are the deadlines for notification?
Does this group feel we need to get together to discuss any open issues?

Please let me know if anyone feels uncomfortable with our getting there.

Thanks,
Rogers

Changes from last week in red.

Retail load
About 18 MW peak, 17 MW off-peak. 
October 4th - First account was switched. 
By November 6th - Remaining accounts will be switched
Issue - Some Lockheed Martin accounts that aren't in the batch.
Issue - Trying to get positions correctly reflected in positions report - Jeff Jackson
Issue - Data we are getting from RPS is incorrect.

Interface with EWS Wholesale
To date - Met with EPMI and discussed management (when will position be transferred? how? at what price?) of retail position. Tom May to discuss with Rogers. 
Issue - How will we pass through intrazonal congestion costs? This isn't an issue for the pilot, but will be an issue on 1/1/2002.

Intramonth book development
November 1 - Expect to have volume management/reporting capability. 
November 1 - Expect to have MTM calculations
???- Expect to have all other reporting capabilities functioning. Will meet with Richard Bird this week to develop a new timeline.

Working with CSC to develop a method to obtain actual customer usage on a timely basis.

Load forecasting
Issue - There is a significant difference (at least in % terms) between the Packaged Ice position per the positions report and Frazier's forecast. Appears the majority of this difference is due to some Packaged Ice accounts being booked more than once.
Issue - Forecasting by zone (vs. at the account level) may lead to inaccuracies in P&L reporting.

?	Customer switching process
Jeff Merola to determine roles and responsibilities

?	Site profile
Site profile desk has processed the pilot program deals. 
Met with the desk to discuss the other (non-pilot program) deals that we expect to switch 1/1/202.

See the email below from Andy Ott.  Andy is working on a new FTR product and would like industry feedback.  We could either provide our responses in writing or we could arrange a conference call with Andy so that you all could ask additional questions and have more of a dialogue.  If would like to respond in writing, Tom Hoatson and I will work with you to get everyone's input and prepare our response.

Sarah,    
I am working with several groups to design a better Financial Transmission
Rights product for PJM (and other RTO regions) and I would like to get feedback
from Enron in several areas ...

1.  Under the current PJM FTR Auction system a customer can request FTRs between
any two points (including Hubs, Zones, etc.). From your perspective, would there
be any benefit to also offering a Financial 'flowgate-type' product in this
auction ?  The product would be like a grouping of FTR paths similar in concept
to the way we group buses to form the Western Hub....  sort of like a Hub for
FTRs design to attempt to get my trading volume (liquidity) in the transmission
rights products. 

2.  As we look forward to a NE RTO, what is the best set of FTR Auction periods
that we should offer ?  ( i.e. Yearly, Monthly, Multi-year, weekly)

3.  How important would a uni-directional FTR product (no down side risk) be to
you.  

4.  Describe what characteristics you are looking for in a Transmission
Congestion hedging product. 

5.  If you had a choice between the products described in items 1 and 3, which
would you want first ?

Hi John- thanks for the generous offer which I have accepted.  A couple of outstanding questions- 

1. Who am I reporting to?  I would welcome the opportunity to report to you or Greg.  I think my job was a lot easier in the past because our group had the backing of the Office of the Chair. This gave us credibility, independence, and the chance to contribute to strategic issues as well as the tactical issues of interest to the traders. However, I am obviously open to any reporting relationship you might suggest and I understand that my day-to-day duties will consist largely of interaction with the Fundy teams.

2. Are there any slots that have opened because of offers that were not accepted?  I would love to be able to take one of the folks from my group with me, particularly Kristin Walsh or my assistant Sharon Purswell.

Thanks again for the great offer and the chance to join UBS.

Robert

Attached are final forms of certain Power Trading documents:

1.  Master Agreement EEI (full blown), with all credit terms left blank, for negotiation with counterparties (CP);

2.  EEI Collateral Annex, including paragraph 10, for use with the Master Agreement EEI;

3.  GTC EEI, Online with credit terms (unilateral right to call for collateral at any time for any reason), for use as the default GTCs Online when dealing with CPs with whom there will be a credit requirement (but could also be used for trades entered into orally assuming we secure the CP consent to the form of agreement, including cover page, prior to entering into trade);

4.  GTC EEI, Online without  credit terms, for use as the default GTCs Online when dealing with CPs with whom there will not be a credit requirement (but could also be used for trades entered into orally assuming we secure the CP consent to the form of agreement, including cover page, prior to entering into trade).

While these documents have been discussed generally with UBS, UBS has not yet had an opportunity to review the actual final version.

100 copies of the first two documents (which will be combined as one for distribution) will be delivered by Genia to Dave shortly.

Please call with any questions/comments.

Enclosed are clean and mark revised (hopefully close to final) drafts of the EEI Collateral Annex and Cover Sheet.  Most of the changes were made to add Securities as Eligible Collateral.  This has not yet been done on the Cover Sheet since it is in a special format that I couldn't figure out.  It will be done tomorrow.  Please call or e-mail me with any remaining comments as we need to finalize this as early as possible tomorrow.  Thanks.

Kevin,
 
The timing issues were directed more at the lawyers.  After talking to Dana, we thought it might be a good idea to get the traders, lawyers and the schedulers on the same page.
 
Talk with you on Wednesday.
 
Thanks 
 
Don

I believe Wabash has also terminated.
 
Don,
As you know, we had a meeting like this the week prior to Christmas and had an accurate list at that time.   Our group can do nothing about delays between actual termination notification by the counterparty and communication to trading that termination has occurred.   I think the meeting is warranted, however, we are not going to completely eliminate the timing issues.
 
I will see you on Wednesday at 2:00 pm.

Subject: East Power Meeting



We need to meet on Wednesday, the 2nd, at 2:00 pm (in the big conference on the sixth floor in ECS) to go back through the East Power contracts that we will continue to serve either through the pools or under bilateral deals.  Given the drill we went through today in preparing for the January schedules in PJM and NEPOOL, it became apparent we need to get all the team members on the same page and make sure we have a good system for notifying all relevant parties of terminations, changes, etc.

Bill/Ed - Can you please run the most recent DPR for non-terminated East Power contracts. 

Casey and Stacey - will you please update the spreadsheet that you ran for Kevin last week. 

Let's make sure we all agree on contracts that have been terminated.  As most of you probably have seen, a number of terminations have been received in the past several days (see below).

United Illuminating - effective January 1, 2002 
HQ Energy Services - effective January 1, 2002 
First Energy Solutions - effective January 2, 2002 
Old Dominion - effective January 10, 2002 - we should schedule in PJM through the 10th of January (do we have any other positions with Old Dominion).

Ameren Energy 
GPU Energy - effective January 21, 2002 - we should schedule in PJM through the 21st of January (they may push back, but we should remind them that they will be subject to LDs).

Thanks, 

Don

Please see the attached spreadsheet for the estimated value to be received for delivering power in the East for the period 12/27 to 12/31 (we will be working on the post 12/21 periods this week).  In summary, the total is approx. is $2.7MM net.  The total cost of power is approx. $15.3MM.  It is broken down $4.5MM for PJM, $5.5MM for NEPOOL, and $5.3MM for Others outside PJM and NEPOOL.  We are working separate arrangements for NEPOOL and PJM, having wired NEPOOL in excess of $8MM on Friday to prepay for power in an effort to be able to do business in that pool through 12/26.  We are working with PJM, and should have resolution by the 27th (they have $31MM of our pre-bankruptcy cash in escrow).  

Outside of PJM and NEPOOL, Kevin is going to go into the bilateral market and prepay for power (similar to what we are doing in the West).  As such, Kevin will need approximately $5.5MM  to prepay for power in the East through 12/31.  The value outside of NEPOOL and PJM is a little over $700M.  Kevin has a number of customers that are in NEPOOL and /or PJM , as well as other regions and you need to serve in all regions to get the full value from the contract.

Having spoken with Tim DeSpain this morning, it appears Ray and Tim are on board for this course of action given that it is consistent with our mandate to preserve the value of the estate (and entering into these positions is ancillary to winding down the existing positions, and not some new speculative trade).

As such, Leslie and her team should expect to begin receiving the wiring instructions early Wednesday morning for Kevin's prepayment deals.

Kevin, I will work with you to explain the form of request that we have been using in the West.

RISKS:
HEDGING: As this juncture, our ability to hedge longer term is limited.  We are therefore limited to daily spot transactions in PJM and NEPOOL.  Outside PJM and NEPOOL, Kevin may have limited ability to buy forward for a few days. We recognize this risk, and the next step in the analysis is to determine at what cost (prepay) can we hedge some of these contracts.  However, it is generally believed that when we begin to serve some of these counterparties, they will terminate the contracts, which will crystallize the in-the-money-value of the contract.

OFFSET RIGHTS: We are still working through all the positions in Enron to determine which parties have master netting agreements that would allow someone to offset one position with another.  A quick review of the East Power positions indicates this risk should be limited.  Additionally, we are still working through net payable/receivable issues and therefore we may owe some of these counterparties money which they may try to offset with the delivered power.  We are working through these issues, and again it is generally believed that the potential returns outweigh the risk, and that there is a high probability that some of these counterparties will terminate the contracts and crystallize the in-the-money-value to us.  

Please call me at 713-412-8967 or 713-529-6280 if anyone has any questions.  Otherwise, Kevin and his team will begin to purchase power in the non PJM/NEPOOL markets on Wednesday.

As you finalize the personnel issues, any information regarding which trader will be managing each location is extremely helpful.  The reason for this is because we must apply the trader to the appropriate product(s) in order to test the system completely.  Using the information you provide, we will be able to make sure the traders are set up correctly prior to our go-live date.

Kevin, 

Please identify which trader will be managing the locations you have listed below so we can have the system fully tested as soon as possible.  I understand that we will be using peak and off-peak only for the locations below.  We will work with the trader of the Ontario location and Leslie Hansen to develop this location, as we do not have anything in the system for this yet.  Thanks, in advance, for your response.

Just spoke to one of their traders.  Their credit is (as are all of our counterparties) conducting a credit review.  As of this morning, they are not putting on any trading restrictions with us.  They have discussed implementing a netting agreement, but we have responded that we will not, especially without updating the current enabling agreement with a EEI (which they are opposed to).

Keep you posted.

Kevin,
 
Thanks for the return call today. Jess Hewitt returned a call I put into him this morning telling me that you would be the person I should talk to. I am the VP of Sales for Genscape, www.genscape.com , and we have developed a product which collects real time plant output data and sends that information real time to traders primarily in the short term power markets. Our product is currently being used and/or tested  at over a dozen top power trading firms in the US, and the response has been fantastic. 
 
There are other methods of receiving this information currently, but none of them are as fast and as accurate as the Genscape data, as we have set up proprietary monitors outside of the right of way on over 130 coal and nuke plants (primarily) nationwide and involuntarily capture their output data every minute or so, thus we can alert traders to plant outages or plants coming on or off line in real time.
 
I would like to discuss Genscape with you at your convenience, or if there is someone else inside UBS Enron to talk to please let me know who that person is. I can be reached at 502 583 4315. Thank you and I look forward to speaking with you.

After talking further with MISO folks about the new attachment M, it appears that the MISO will _effectively_ be requiring physical losses, although they don't come out and say that. Financial losses are essentially at the option of the TO, so we "may" be able to do Financial losses if the TOs want to offer the service.

In more detail, this is how the process will work:

TCs will use the MISO's loss calculator to identify impacted TOs
If ALL TOs have provided financial loss pricing information, then it will be possible to buy losses
If not, the TC will be required to self supply

TOs can change their loss pricing (or desire to offer financial losses) every 12 hours.  Effectively, this means it will be difficult at best to manage risk associated with having the FIN rug pulled out from under us at scheduling time.  I will continue to work on this issue with Mike  and push for a financial solution that provides for our needs.

Tamara,

A collegue in the Houston office forwarded on a message from Kevin that I should contact you to set up some telephone interviews with the following people;

Kevin Presto (VP - head of East Power Trading)
Fletcher Sturm (VP - head of midwest trading - East Power)
Dana Davis (VP - head of northeast trading - East Power).

Could you let me know a possible schedule? I'm available anytime this week, including any evening (London time) calls.

Many thanks, 

Tim

Kevin,

You mentioned the other day that we have an internal group who is working on an LMP model to replicate the pricing which we expect the RTO's to apply under real-time market conditions.

Who can I speak to, to catch up on this?

Dave

Kevin

I'm contacting you in the hope that you may be able to provide us with some info regarding British Energy.  I'm a trader on the UK Power Desk where BE are one of our major counterparties.  We are currently assessing what their strategy is likely to be in the UK and this depends in part on how profitable their US/Canadian assets are.  Do you have any insights on what they are up to in these markets right now - i.e how much of their output do you believe they have hedged forward and at what price ?  If BE succeed in restarting another 1600MW at Bruce is this likely to depress the market price there ? In general what do we believe the outlook to be for the US and Canadian markets.

Any info would be much appreciated !

Should you need to speak to me my phone number is +0044 207 783 6919

Many thanks
Derek

Subject:=09Government Affairs Organization Announcement


With the announcement of Enron's acquisition by Dynegy behind us, and with =
the initial severance process completed, it seemed an appropriate time to e=
ffect some organizational changes so that we as a group are better prepared=
 to meet the challenges of the future.  Before I turn to the organizational=
 changes, I would like to say a few words about those who will be leaving t=
he company as a result of the initial severance (you'll know who they are b=
y their absence on the organizational chart): Leading and being a part of t=
his group has been a privilege?I am thankful for every day that I have had =
that responsibility and thankful for however long I continue to have the re=
sponsibility.  This sense of privilege and thankfulness is primarily driven=
 by having had the opportunity to get to know and care about such a dedicat=
ed group of professionals and support staff and who, to a person, are also =
very decent and good people.  To say good-bye to some of our colleagues is =
not easy.  I want to, on behalf of all of us, thank them for their hard wor=
k, their integrity, their decency, and the good times and laughter that we =
shared.  I trust that many of us will find ways to sustain friendships that=
 have been and will continue to be very special.  Thanks to each of you who=
 are leaving for all you have done.

As to the organizational structure, it has become increasingly apparent to =
me that the existing organization, with a mix of groups organized along fun=
ctional and regional lines (particularly within the U.S.), has impeded our =
ability to get things done in the most efficient fashion at times.  The nee=
d to rationalize the organizational structure, in order to consolidate all =
U.S. energy functions, is a strong need from my perspective.  As a result, =
Jim Steffes will lead the U.S. Energy group along with Sue Nord, who will j=
ointly report to Jim and myself.  Sue will assist Jim in the leadership of =
the group and take on project management responsibilities as warranted to h=
elp Jim shoulder a significant burden.  Also reporting to Jim will be a lea=
dership group for U.S. Energy that will be as follows:  Wholesale Electrici=
ty will be led by Christi Nicolay; Retail Electricity and Natural Gas will =
be led by Harry Kingerski; Wholesale Gas will be led by Leslie Lawner.   La=
st, but not least, Jeff Dasovich and Sue Mara, who will continue to focus o=
n California energy issues, will report to Jim. (Sue Mara will also be part=
 of the Wholesale electricity team).

Steve Montovano, who will continue to report to me, will lead a commercial =
development effort along with Dan Allegretti.

With the elimination of the regional groups, I also recognize that there is=
 a need to continue to focus on how we as a group address our political/leg=
islative needs across the U.S.  Paul Kaufman will lead a small group that w=
ill address that need and that will focus on state political support.  Paul=
 will also take the lead for Government Affairs in support of corporate dev=
elopment efforts across the U.S.

Much of the rest of the group remains the same.  Linda Robertson will conti=
nue to lead the Washington group with Sarah Novosel, who reports to Linda, =
taking the lead role in our coordination of activities at FERC.  Amr Ibrahi=
m will continue to lead the support of the Global Assets group and also con=
tinue to manage the Risk Analytics function.  Maggy Huson will take over su=
pport of the non-energy business units, which are as follows: Global Market=
s, Industrial Markets, Networks, and Broadband.  Rob Hemstock will continue=
 to lead the support of Enron Canada.  Paul Dawson, who heads up government=
 affairs for Europe; Sergio Assad, who heads up government affairs for Sout=
h America; and Mike Grimes and Mark Crowther, who head up our Asian efforts=
, will continue to jointly report to the business units and myself.

I am also forming a North American leadership group for Government Affairs =
to provide policy guidance for the larger group and the company.  That Comm=
ittee will consist of Rob Hemstock, Maggy Huson, Amr Ibrahim, Paul Kaufman,=
 Harry Kingerski, Leslie Lawner, Steve Montovano, Christi Nicolay, Sue Nord=
, Sarah Novosel, Linda Robertson, Jim Steffes and myself.  We will also con=
tinue to have an RCR Committee that will consist of Maggy Huson, Harry King=
erski, Sue Nord, Linda Robertson, Jim Steffes & myself.  Finally, I am form=
ing a Dynegy/Enron regulatory approvals working group that will consist of =
Jose Bestard, Paul Dawson, Paul Kaufman, Sue Nord, Sarah Novosel and myself=
.

No organizational structure or set of organizational changes is either perf=
ect or permanent.  I believe these changes will make us better and more pre=
pared for the future.  However, we must be prepared to further adjust as th=
e future unfolds for the company.

One final note: I am deeply sorry that each of you has had to live through =
this uncertain and troubled period for the company.  We are all saddened by=
 the recognition that we are in the midst of changes that will leave our gr=
oup fundamentally altered, but we must resolve to do our best for each othe=
r and ourselves during this period of change to ensure that what emerges, f=
or those of us who do remain a part of the new Dynegy, reflects the excelle=
nce and integrity that has characterized our group.  Personally, I will do =
all I can, for as long as I can, to steer the group through this to the ver=
y best place possible.  Your continued dedication and support is very much =
appreciated.  Hang in there and thanks.

Gas or Power?    Gas is Scott Neal and Power is Doug Gilbert-Smith for
ERCOT (TX) and Fletch Sturm for LA/AL (Gulf Coast).

The Williams energy traders know these folks so these questions must be
coming from non-commodity people at Williams.

Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Kevin--Now that UBS is buying the gas and power business do you think that the gas and power groups will need someone (like me) to handle any physical or financial liquid fuel (resid and distillate) requirements for projects or daily business opportunities?

wednesday is a dead day so i gave my staff, including me, the day off.  please call me at 610-996-2522 on wednesday.  thanks.

Yesterday, FERC gave approval for MISO to begin regional transmission operations on December 15, 2001.  This will include administration of their regional transmission tariff, security coordination, and "other regional transmission organization functions."  I expect they are going to function very similarly to the manner in which SPP and MAPP currently operate.  I verified this with Roger Harzy at the MISO, and he confirmed they plan to be operational on Dec. 15th.

I will be at MISO next week Tuesday and Wednesday, and will be working to make sure we are set up to take service under their tariff and fully understand their operations. If you have any specific questions, please send me mail, and I will work to address them while I am visiting.

See the attached Electric Power Daily article for more detail (sidebar, p1).

Kevin,

New Smyrna is open to a Park/Lend arrangement.  I'm looking into transmission availability to and from New Smyrna currently.  They are interconnected with FPL and FPC.  Any interest in this location for a parking deal?

Please see the attached spreadsheet for the estimated value to be received for delivering power in the East for the period 12/27 through 12/31 (we will be working on the post 12/31 periods this week).  In summary, the total is approx. is $2.7MM net.  The total cost of power is approx. $15.3MM.  It is broken down $4.5MM for PJM, $5.5MM for NEPOOL, and $5.3MM for Others (not including Ameren and Wabash) outside PJM and NEPOOL.  We are working separate arrangements for NEPOOL and PJM, having wired NEPOOL in excess of $8MM on Friday to prepay for power in an effort to be able to do business in that pool through 12/26.  We are working with PJM, and should have resolution by the 27th (they have $31MM of our pre-bankruptcy cash in escrow).  

Outside of PJM and NEPOOL, Kevin is going to go into the bilateral market and prepay for power (similar to what we are doing in the West).  As such, Kevin will need approximately $5.5MM  to prepay for power in the East through 12/31 (Ameren and Wabash are negative today through the 31st, but will turn positive after the first of the year - Kevin will not be serving these until after the first of the year).  The value outside of NEPOOL and PJM is a little over $700M.  Kevin has a number of customers that are in NEPOOL and /or PJM , as well as other regions and you need to serve in all regions to get the full value from the contract.

Having spoken with Tim DeSpain this morning, it appears Ray and Tim are on board for this course of action given that it is consistent with our mandate to preserve the value of the estate (and entering into these positions is ancillary to winding down the existing positions, and not some new speculative trade).

As such, Leslie and her team should expect to begin receiving the wiring instructions early Wednesday morning for Kevin's prepayment deals.

Kevin, I will work with you to explain the form of request that we have been using in the West.

RISKS:
HEDGING: As this juncture, our ability to hedge longer term is limited (requires significant cash - we need to do cost/benefit analysis).  We are therefore limited to daily spot transactions in PJM and NEPOOL.  Outside PJM and NEPOOL, Kevin may have limited ability to buy forward for a few days. We recognize this risk, and the next step in the analysis is to determine at what cost (prepay) can we hedge some of these contracts and if we can, should we. Regardless, it is generally believed that when we begin to serve some of these counterparties, they will terminate the contracts, which will crystallize the in-the-money-value of the contract.

OFFSET RIGHTS: We are still working through all the positions in Enron to determine which parties have master netting agreements that would allow someone to offset one position with another.  A quick review of the open East Power positions indicates this risk should be limited.  Additionally, we are still working through net payable/receivable issues and therefore we may owe some of these counterparties money which they may try to offset with the delivered power.  We are working through these issues, and again it is generally believed that the potential returns outweigh the risk, and that there is a high probability that some of these counterparties will terminate the contracts and crystallize the in-the-money-value to us.  

Please call me at 713-412-8967 (cell) or 713-529-6280 (home) if anyone has any questions.  Otherwise, Kevin and his team will begin to purchase power in the non PJM/NEPOOL markets on Wednesday, and will continue to serve the customers in PJM and NEPOOL, subject to resolving the open issues in those regions.

Performance-Based  Ratemaking Conference
December  5-7, 2001, Denver, CO
OVERVIEW
 

Performance  Based Ratemaking (PBR) is emerging as a key element of the restructuring of the  electric utility industry. For PBR to be effective it must be designed carefully  and uniquely for each utility so as to align the interests of the utility, the  shareholders and the customers and also to make sure that PBR is successful in  achieving efficiency and service quality.
 
EUCI  has put together a covey of expert speakers to review and address the latest PBR  developments and applications.  Join  us in Denver and get the latest state-of-the-art information and insights you  will need to develop an effective PBR strategy for your  company.

Electric  Power Market Performance Conference
December  12-14, 2001, Denver, CO
OVERVIEW
 

Each  year there is additional opportunity to draw lessons regarding electricity  market structure and design from actual market performance. These lessons are  leading to a convergence in market design, at least in the Eastern  Interconnection and ERCOT. One focus of this conference will be on the lessons  to be drawn from the experience of the new ERCOT markets, the continuing market  design problems in California, and the difficulties in developing and  implementing a market based congestion management system in the  midwest.
 
A  second focus of this conference will be on the existing markets in PJM and New  York, which have now moved beyond managing their internal markets and are being  pushed by market participants and regulatory agencies to better address  inter-RTO coordination and develop market based incentive systems for  transmission expansion.
 
Finally, the conference will highlight one of the  important, but little noticed successes of the Eastern ISOs, which is the  explosive growth in the PJM and New York financial rights auctions.

And
Portfolio  Optimization for Electric Utilities Conference
January  22-25, 2001, New York City, NY
OVERVIEW
 

In the current environment of  volatile energy prices and deregulation, it has become increasingly more  important for the electricity industry to learn how to manage price risk. EUCI  presents two events formatted for the beginner to the expert in price risk  management. The first Workshop is designed for the beginner with no prior  experience in risk management and introduces the basic vocabulary and concepts  in a concise and easily understandable format which forms the foundation for the  more advanced concepts applied in the second event (Conference).

Transmission  Expansion and Systems in Transition Conference
Feb.  6-7, 2002, Miami, Florida
OVERVIEW

This conference will examine the  business and regulatory challenges to U.S. electric systems in transition in  effectively expanding transmission capacity to meet new demands in the larger  and more competitive regional markets emerging under FERC's RTO  initiatives.  The conference will  review the parameters of these challenges and possible solutions to them.  It will examine technology options and  new business models for transmission expansion.  It will analyze emerging proposals for  effective transmission planning and pricing, including market-based pricing  alternatives to FERC's traditional pricing methods. The conference will also  discuss what it will take in legislative action and regulatory initiative to  achieve an efficient regime for ensuring that the nation has a reliable grid and  regional trading system.

Southern is evaluting the 7x24 offer from the Wansley delivery point.  They indicated hesitance to offer LD, but are more amenable to offer LD if have choice of delivery points.  I indicated we had the preference of Wansley, but would also consider Scherer.  I'll let you know what they come back with.

FERC Enacts Major Constraints=20
on Wholesale Market



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis








AEP, Entergy Corp. and Southern Company told by FERC to charge cost-based p=
rices instead of market-based prices for wholesale spot transactions.=20

[News item from Reuters] The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FER=
C) voted 3-1 last week to adopt new rules to measure market power, as a con=
dition for approving mergers and granting utilities the right to trade powe=
r in the wholesale market. FERC commissioners said the new test would impro=
ve a system that allowed a meltdown to take place in the California market =
last winter, when wholesale power prices soared to record highs amid tight =
supplies. FERC commissioners agreed to produce a new market power test base=
d on supply margin assessments, which examines a company's importance in se=
rving peak electricity loads. "If you're big enough to control the market a=
t the time we look at it, you'll have mitigation put on you," said FERC Cha=
irman Pat Wood.=20

Analysis: Many participants in the wholesale sector of the energy industry =
are still reeling from FERC's new ruling, which may have slipped past some =
radar screens considering that it was issued right before the long holiday =
weekend. This is a mammoth ruling on FERC's part, however, and it holds tre=
mendous impact for those companies that increasingly find the lion's share =
of their profits coming from wholesale transactions. In addition, state reg=
ulators have also started gauging the impact of the ruling on retail rates,=
 which some utilities may seek to increase as a way to compensate for shrin=
king profits in their wholesale operations. While FERC has presented this r=
uling as an attempt to circumvent on the national level problems experience=
d in the California market, the new limits on wholesale transactions can al=
so be seen as another example of the "big stick" that the commission is usi=
ng to force utilities into participating in regional transmission organizat=
ions (RTO). Further, the ruling is another striking indication that Chairma=
n Wood is following through with his promise to monitor rampant wholesale m=
arkets while still attempting to support competition. The objective represe=
nts a tall order, and the new ruling from the commission is certain to prom=
pt intense resistance among companies involved in wholesale trading.=20

Put into a nutshell, FERC has ruled that some companies can no longer charg=
e unregulated, market-based rates for spot market wholesale transactions. I=
nstead, companies identified as having market power and that aren't part of=
 an approved RTO must charge cost-based prices for power that isn't committ=
ed in a long-term contract, and publicly disclose those cost-based prices. =
Columbus, Ohio-based American Electric Power (NYSE: AEP), Atlanta-based Sou=
thern Company (NYSE: SO) and New Orleans-based Entergy Corp. (NYSE: ETR) ha=
ve been singled out as case studies on which FERC will be immediately apply=
ing its new standards for wholesale transactions. Note that Mirant Corp., a=
 former subsidiary of Southern Company, has also been identified as having =
to submit information to FERC in order to gauge its level of market power s=
eparate from its former parent. The commission has essentially determined t=
hat these three utilities hold an unacceptable level of market power in the=
 areas in which they operate. Under FERC's new market power "test," a gener=
ator or marketer is viewed as having too much market power if its electrici=
ty is "pivotal" during peak demand, which enables the company to demand a p=
rice above competitive levels. Regional transmission constraints will also =
be considered now as a measurement of a company's market power. This is a d=
ramatic departure from previous standards, by which (under one of FERC's ma=
in criterions) a company that supplied less than 20 percent of the power ne=
eded in a particular region was freed from rate regulation on the federal l=
evel.=20

There are some important exceptions to the ruling. First, FERC has not elim=
inated the utilities' ability to charge market-based rates in areas where t=
he grid and markets are controlled by a FERC-approved RTO. This is signific=
ant, as I will expand upon subsequently, because it indicates that there ar=
e secondary objectives in FERC's new ruling. In addition, the current rulin=
g only impacts short-term sales transactions in which these three utilities=
 are involved. In other words, long-term contracts that the three companies=
 may have previously established or will establish in the future are not im=
pacted by the ruling. However, the three companies named in the ruling will=
 have to post pricing information related to long-term contracts, and FERC =
has retained the possibility that further price mitigation for long-term co=
ntracts may be necessary. Also note that the Western market, which already =
is under a price mitigation policy that FERC imposed in June, was not inclu=
ded in the new ruling.=20

The three utilities named in the ruling now have 15 days to submit proposal=
s to FERC outlining a transition to charging cost-based wholesale rates for=
 all power not currently committed to a buyer. Specifically, the utilities =
will have to post on their open-access same-time information systems (OASIS=
) the incremental cost of producing the uncommitted power during each hour =
in a 24-hour period. Moving forward, the price that the utilities can charg=
e for non-committed power on the spot market will be the difference between=
 their cost of production and the bid of more expensive power in the region=
 that their power displaces. The new cost-based rates must be administered =
by an independent third party.=20

The new pricing standards revert back to an older, cost-based technique kno=
wn as "split the savings." The methodology for this standard can get rather=
 complicated, but essentially under FERC's new ruling the three companies i=
dentified will have to post their cost-based, incremental costs for spot po=
wer into the OASIS system for viewing by potential purchases. Purchasers wh=
o want to make a bid will post their decremental energy bid for not produci=
ng or buying the power on their own. The final price for the transactions w=
ill be the split between the seller's incremental cost and the buyer's decr=
emental bid. For instance, if Southern Company bids its incremental cost at=
 $20/MWh and a purchaser bids its decremental cost at $30/MWh, the transact=
ion price would be $25/MWh. Assuming a midnight-to-midnight trading day, se=
llers would have to submit their incremental bid by noon on the previous da=
y and buyers would submit their decremental bids by 6 p.m. What this potent=
ially creates is an "information advantage" for buyers who have six hours t=
o evaluate and respond to the incremental bids from some sellers. Some of t=
he drawbacks to this system are that it requires both parties to post price=
 information that may not be readily available and it potentially allows th=
e purchaser to game the system by having access to the seller's original in=
cremental bid and competing around the seller's price.=20

Note also that in a separate development FERC simultaneously opened a broad=
 investigation under Section 206 of the Federal Power Act to apply the new =
market-based-sales policy to all U.S. sellers nationwide. What this means i=
s that, although only three utilities are mentioned in this initial order, =
it is expected that FERC will continue to take steps to constrain what it b=
elieves to be erratic wholesale markets. Reportedly, some 30 companies are =
awaiting similar reviews by FERC to determine if the commission believes th=
ey exert market power. The 206 investigation reportedly also requires power=
 providers with market-based sales authority to amend their tariffs within =
60 days to provide FERC with open-ended authority to order refunds if the c=
ommission determines that market manipulation has occurred.=20

I made a previous reference to the "big stick" that FERC is carrying relate=
d to participation in RTOs. Remember that a few months ago, Chairman Wood h=
ad threatened to deny utilities that refused to join an RTO the benefits of=
 charging market-based wholesale rates and swift approvals for merger appli=
cations, advantages that the chairman equated with the "new world" of the d=
eregulated energy market. With this in mind, note that only Southern Compan=
y, Entergy and AEP are included in the present ruling (although it may be s=
ubsequently expanded). Southern Company and Entergy in particular have exhi=
bited some resistance in following FERC's consolidation mandate regarding n=
ational RTOs, so it is probably not a mere coincidence that these three uti=
lities have been singled out. This must be particularly painful for Souther=
n Company, which gains a good part of its profits from wholesale trading an=
d previously expressed plans to double the size of its generation assets ov=
er the next five years.=20

Interestingly, Commissioner Linda Key Breathitt represented the single diss=
enting vote in the ruling. Breathitt's concern was that the ruling had been=
 pulled together too quickly and not enough time had been provided to evalu=
ate the impact on wholesale markets. This issue will undoubtedly be contest=
ed, and to a certain extent the utilities impacted by the ruling appear to =
have been caught off-guard. AEP, Entergy and Southern Company all issued st=
atements to the effect that they were uncertain about the extent to which t=
he ruling would impact them, and that they were reserving the right for pos=
sible litigation.=20

Moreover, to summarize the commission's rulemaking, I think there are a han=
dful of important points that should be considered. First, the ruling illus=
trates the steps that FERC is taking to revoke market-price authority that =
was for the most part unrestricted prior to the time that Pat Wood assumed =
his post as chairman. Second, FERC is implementing cost-based prices on the=
 spot market only, and in only very defined circumstances. However, this co=
uld be an indication that the commission may extend cost-based pricing to o=
ther wholesale transactions, including long-term contracts, at a later time=
. Third, the "split the savings" cost-based formula could become fraught wi=
th its own problems. Its requirements are rather complex and it offers the =
potential to give power purchasers a market advantage on the spot market ov=
er power sellers, which will now be required to post incremental costs in t=
he bidding process. Finally, one of the inherent drivers of FERC's new ruli=
ng is its desire to have large utilities join the RTOs that the commission =
has approved. It is very significant that the new ruling immediately impact=
s AEP, Entergy and Southern Company, utilities that have not only been deem=
ed by the commission to have market power in their regions but which have a=
lso not yet joined an approved RTO. However, even though only three compani=
es are immediately impacted by this ruling, it should not be overlooked tha=
t the ruling holds impact for the market as a whole as other sellers now wi=
ll gain important pricing information about the major suppliers in certain =
areas. Thus, overall this is a very significant ruling and one that could s=
ubstantially change the manner in which transactions in the wholesale power=
 market are conducted.=20

Spoke to Lew at Morgan.  In summary, he's $1@$4 for this spread.  

He spent some time to explain why his market is not tighter.  Basically, the underlying philosophy of their shop is to NOT jump into the new, less liquid markets until they develop further.  They would almost rather see a few markets develop within the region, with high liquidity in each market (as opposed to many markets in the region, with low liquidity in each market).  My response was to be part of developing many market in the region, all with high liquidity.  But, in order to do so and help all the players in the market, we need other participants.

All that being said, his offer is $4 for the Cal'02, into SOCO/on Ga-ITS spread, 5x16.  I'm going to try some of the others (Williams, Dyn, Mirant may be players).

Kevin -

We are developing a process to mark estate curves.  We will be fully marking by Thursday (including vol curves) except possibly the West (still working on).  Is your group currently marking estate curves (I think someone dropped the PJM cash curves today)?  I think we should probably let the estate group begin this process so that they can be ready to go when UBS takes over - your thoughts?

Kristen/Kevin - can we differentiate effective now between estate/netco curve manager so that we can start a parallel process?

Thanks,
RH

Ok So I'm having trouble letting go.......
 
9:00 am  Greg and I and Louise will meet with the back office to discuss staff.
10:00 am  We will meet discuss staff.  We need to have further meeting later with our staff to determine if we should offer other people jobs.  We have a lot of front office spots.  Slone, you need to get us a front office count by region.
 
I suggest that Hunter and Dave Ryan coordinate interviews for outside weather guys for next Monday.  We should bring in 10 if we can and hire 2 or 3.   I suggest Presto works with Gaskill and Will and the H guy I can't spell in Portland to put together gas and power fundies presentations for a week Tuesday.  I would like to have a clue before I start trading.
 
Hunter on the gas trading side I say we put all front office into 4 groups and give them a task to come up with the best Organization structure.   It will get everyone working.  We need that.  I would suggest that we start projecting our groups to death so they're focused on business.
 
I also suggest we put all the screens on the floor to commodity prices to keep people from watching Enron shit all day.
 
Lavo

Kevin and Rogers,

After meeting with Ader yesterday to discuss some LSE topics and sending hi=
m a polite, to the point email, I received this email response from him.  T=
his email completely misrepresents what was dicussed and makes me look bad =
to management.  I am about ready for war, so I think it is better that some=
one else look at this before I do something to get fired.  I have never bee=
n so completely disgusted with someone who is supposed to be a figure of re=
spect and authority, and is a Vice President at a company like Enron.  My e=
mail was addressed to Ader and Bernstein and copied Rogers and Nancy Hetric=
k since these are the people who have knowledge of the subject matter.  For=
 him to copy the people he did, and hide behind his contacts, while lying a=
bout our conversation, and skewing it in a manner in which I would never ac=
t, is inexcusable.  I would expect more from a 4th grader.  Sorry for the r=
anting and raving.  Kevin - Rogers is out today, so if you would like to di=
scuss this further, please call me at 33143.  Thanks.

Joe,

I requested a meeting with you yesterday to work with you and convey what w=
e have learned over the last three months by working with regulatory and th=
e ERCOT ISO to utilize and create additional LSE accounts.  As you were inf=
ormed by Nancy Hetrick of regulatory all three currently available LSE acco=
unt are committed by Structured Supply for use under currently negotiated m=
asters.  We requested the meeting with you yesterday to explain what we wer=
e doing and why we needed the other three EES LSE accounts.  We also took t=
he time to explain the process for establishing new LSE accounts, under a L=
LC structure which is not complicated, but the structure that the new LSE a=
ccounts would be created under (SPV) is inconsistent with the masters negot=
iated and EES would not be able to perform under these masters.

We have tried to work with you in cooperation to accomplish your goals cons=
istent with the constraints of the ERCOT rules.  We have explained our need=
s and the reason for them. We conveyed our interest in working together to =
accomplish the greater good for the company and offered our help in any way=
 we could.  You mark and I agreed that it would be easier to help each othe=
r and not duplicate efforts.  We were appreciative of your willingness to p=
roceed consistent with this spirit of cooperation.  It disheartens and surp=
rises me that you would leave the meeting with this understanding and in ag=
reement of the business situation and send an e-mail the next morning, with=
out picking up the phone or stopping by to discuss this and just attempt to=
 dictatorially commandeer the LSE accounts that you knew were committed and=
 why they were committed. =20

Moreover; you told us that you thought you might need one more and you have=
 attempted to take three more.

Best regards,


Jeff

All,  This past weekend, additional performance related changes to the EnPower production environment were implemented.

Our database environment was upgraded from a 32-bit version of Oracle 8.1.7.2 to the 64-bit version.  This upgrade increases the maximum size of memory cache available to our applications from 4Gb to 25Gb.  Apps that cache large amounts of data will experience reductions in physical I/O thereby increasing application speed.

Once again, this change represents one of many short-term steps to improve the performance of our core wholesale trading system.  I'll continue to send out notifications as these changes are implemented.

We will review the complete set of short and long-term performance related improvements in an upcoming architecture review meeting TBA. 

Glad to discuss.

Steve

Ken Lay announced today that he has resigned from Enron's Board of Directors.  His resignation is effective immediately.  

In a press release, Ken said, "I want to see Enron survive and successfully emerge from reorganization.  Due to the multiple inquiries and investigations, some of which are focused on me personally, I believe that my involvement has become a distraction to achieving this goal."

He added, "My concern is for current and former Enron employees and other stakeholders, and I feel that it is in their best interest for me to step down from the Board."

Kevin,

I stopped by but I just missed you.  I will be in early Monday morning (to hopefully alleviate your work load).  Let me know if you want me to manage the stack first thing in the morning or if you want to transition it during the day. 

I realize things feel like shit right now (we sued Microsoft for breach of the contract) but we will turn this ship around. 

Hang in there.  

See you Monday.

Kevin -

As part of Rogers' group over here, I am guessing that most of us are probably on a short list for phase out fairly soon.

I would very much like to apply to the UBS trading company and would like to ask you the best way to go about that.

Will try to find you for a few minutes on Wednesday for any thoughts.

Thanks,
Bobby

You have a GTC order in to sell 5,000 DIS @ 23.25.
Do you still want that order in the system?

We are getting ready for the launch of "NetcoOnline".

We have been preparing new documentation, a refreshed site design and cleaned products to reflect our Gas and Power focus.

Our planned Re-Launch timetable is as follows:


Week of Jan 14:

Upon approval by the new buyer of the PA and ETA formats, we will contact our Top 50 customers and send them copies of the final PA and ETA forms with the new Buyer's name filled in. During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have an approved PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch "NetCoOnline".

A Splash page will be available within two business days of knowing our new company name, on a web page reached via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of "NetCoOnline" and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Subusers.

A Press Release will be issued which will include the planned launch date of "NetcoOnline"

Week of Jan. 21:

If all goes well, "NetcoOnline" will be launched on Tuesday, January 22, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues).

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for NetcoOnline. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
		
Trading/Origination Coordination

We will shortly be sending you an invitation to join a meeting in which we will be discussing launch plans in more detail and looking for people to help in contacting customers on our Top 50 list. Although we have a dedicated EnronOnline marketing team, we would appreciate assistance from traders and originators who have strong relationships with our customers and can assist in getting signed PA's returned to us.

If you have any questions please contact Bob Shults (30397) or Dave Forster (31861).

As a result of the Sept 11 attacks on the US, NERC Security Coordinators are being relied upon by the FBI and the DOE to report to them any threats or attacks on the US electric grid.   Security Coordinators have also discussed operating the grid under restricted access condtions during "heightened awareness".  There is no clear indication what the operators will do differently at times of heightened alerts.  However, it may be so extreme as shutting down interfaces and drastically reducing transfer capability.  Such actions may not be noticed on OASIS.  We are arguing that such actions should - to greatest extent possible - attempt to not disrupt markets.

Please report to me or Susan Lindberg, any suspicous denials or TLRs that you think may have been enacted as a result of such security actions.

For example, since the Afghanistan bombing raids this Sunday, NERC is operating under a state of "heightened awareness" this week.

I've never been a big fan of Shapiro, however, I wonder if he could help with the speed of the regulatory process.  Steffes seems to talk more than act.  Am I way off base.

My issues with Rick have never been related to competence but were based on costs of his unit.

Thanks David.

I have asked Mark Taylor to see if the ERCOT team could speak with Bryan Murtaugh at 1pm Thursday (in 38c2).  The purpose is simply to walk through the documents to ensure that UBS can sign-off as quickly as possible.  We will know, hopefully, by mid morning tomorrow.

I'll send another note with the final plans.

Jim

Subject:	RE: UBS Sign-Off on ERCOT Docs

I understand from Smith Day that APX forwarded us today a format of contract relating to their potentially serving as QSE for UBS AG trading.  APX is apparently willing to contract on a month-to-month basis (thus allowing us to move to our own IT interface with ERCOT as soon as possible).  

As to item two below, until UBS would have the IT capability (currently under development and projected to be roughly a month from completion) to become certified to act as its own QSE, it would not need to execute any 'market participant' agreement with ERCOT in order to be a power marketer within ERCOT.  As soon as UBS desired to trade Renewable Energy Credits ("RECs"), it would need to sign a standard-form agreement with ERCOT in order to maintain a REC account. 

Trading conducted by UBS with any given counterparty within ERCOT would be pursuant to 'UBSWarburgEnergyOnline' GTCs or else subject to discrete negotiated wholesale power enabling agreements and/or ISDA master agreements. The ERCOT ISO would have no connection with such relationship documents supporting UBS AG trading activities.  On the other hand, as UBS's likely counterparties are entities with wholesale power trading activities of national scope, the timeline for trading in ERCOT is linked to the timeline for completing wholesale power/financial master enabling agreements approved by UBS.  Doug Gilbert-Smith this afternoon identified the following counterparties in decreasing order of of their priority as trading partners in ERCOT:  

TXU Energy Trading 
BP Energy Company
Reliant Energy Services, Inc.
Aquila Power Corporation
Morgan Stanley capitral Group
Constellation Power Source
FPL Energy Power Marketing, Inc.
American Electic Power Service Corporation
Mirant Americas Energy Marketing, LP
Calpine Energy Servicces LP
Dynegy Marketing & Trade
LCRA --Lower Colorado River Authority

along with a couple of incumbent utilities:

San Antonio City Public Service
Reliant HL&P

If you desire Doug Gilbert -Smith to sit in on this meeting, then it would have to be scheduled for Thursday.

Subject:	UBS Sign-Off on ERCOT Docs

UBS Legal and UBS Credit is heading to Houston this Thursday and Friday.  I have asked that ERCOT matters get 1 hour to discuss the necessary contracts that UBS will need to sign to participate in the ERCOT market.

Basically, my understanding is the following --

1.	PUCT Registration Form for Power Marketer
2.	ERCOT ISO Information
	QSE [Portz, David]   N/A until IT platform is ready for UBS to serve as its own QSE 
	LSE [Portz, David]   N/A 
	Wholesale Enabling Agreement [Portz, David]   No ERCOT  involvement 
	Other [Portz, David]   REC Trading Account Agreement  
3.	APX Agreement [Portz, David]   initially
4.	Other

Given the list of issues, this assumes that UBSW Energy will not be selling electricity at retail.  If we need this for Day 1, we would have to get an additional license from the PUCT.

Thanks,

Jim

Kevin,

I have worked with this guy at EBS for the past year and think he is a good candidate for the group.  He has worked for Marcello Romano (he has a favorable view of him also).  He traded oil products at Goldman a few years back and is interested in coming to the U.S. from our London office.  

Let me know what you think.  Perhaps Louise can weigh in also if she knows him.  

John

As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

Subject:	EPMI's FRCC membership

Dick Basford (formerly, a consultant for Enron on Florida matters) called me with a recommendation that EPMI withdraw from FRCC membership before EPMI is invoiced in February for $5750 (1/4 of annual dues of $23,000).  There is no pre-notice period for withdrawal and Dick feels that it would leave the FRCC relationship in a better light if EPMI withdraws, rather than not paying the invoice.  I tend to agree if EPMI has no further ongoing interests in trading in Florida.

UBS trading can make an application and join at any time, without an initiation fee.

Kevin/Paul--Is it ok for EPMI to withdraw?  If so, I'll draft the letter.  

Thanks.  Christi  37007

The following proceedings that we've been following for some time are on FERC's agenda for Tuesday, November 20.  

AEP's Three Year Update of its Market Based Rates

As you may recall, in August, 2000, AEP filed its triennial market based rates review with FERC.  On September 21, 2000 and again on October 20, 2000, EPMI protested that filing, arguing that AEP has market power in transmission so it should not be permitted to continue charging market based rates for wholesale power sales.  Now, 15 months later, FERC is planning to act on the filing.

"Investigation of Terms and Conditions of Public Utility Market-Based Rate Authorizations"

This proceeding may be linked to the AEP proceeding, although the two are listed separately on FERC's agenda.  While we are not certain what FERC intends to do in this docket, they could be opening up a new investigation into all market based rate authorizations, including non-utility generators and power marketers.  We will monitor this closely and let you know about the proceeding as soon as we learn about it on Tuesday.

Bangor Hydro vs. ISO NE

Bangor Hydro filed a complaint against ISO NE on June 15, 2001 arguing that, due to a design flaw in the electronic dispatch, the ISO should reset the Energy Clearing Prices that were impacted by this design flaw from December 9, 2001 through the end of March.  The ISO opposes Bangor's complaint, stating that it cannot reset prices pursuant to Market Rule 15 unless there was a specific, identifiable error and the ISO posted notice of the error within a certain time period after the error is detected.

New York ISO Extension of Automated Mitigation Procedures

The NYISO filed to extend its AMP until October 31, 2002.  Many parties oppose the extension, others support it.

New England ISO ICAP Proceeding

The Commission issued an order on August 28 regarding the ICAP deficiency charge.  Several parties sought rehearing.  The proceeding on the agenda may be the Commission's order on those rehearing requests.

ConEd's In City Mitigation

ConEd filed to extend the in-city mitigation procedures through October 31, 2002.  Several parties protested, others support it.

Maine PUC v. ISO NE; UI v. ISO NE; Bangor Hydro v. ISO NE

Several entities (Maine PUC, UI, and Bangor Hydro) filed complaints against ISO NE in August, 2000 arguing that the ISO should restate the $6,000 Energy Clearing Price that occurred on May 8, 2000.  18 months later, it looks like FERC may be ready to act on these complaints.

HQ Energy v. NYISO

HQ filed a compliant against the NYISO on December 12, 2000 arguing that the ISO erroneously restated the energy market clearing price for May 8, 2000.  The Commission may be ready to act on this complaint as well.

Because the New England complaints and HQ complaint all relate to the high energy prices that occurred on May 8, 2000, and whether the ISOs should have restated those prices, it is likely that the Commission will rule the same way in each of the proceedings (either that the ISO should have reset the prices or shouldn't have).

Reliant and Mirant v. CAISO

On October 18, 2001, Reliant and Mirant filed a complaint against the ISO arguing that the ISO is giving preferential treatment to the DWR and CERS and is not following the OOM tariff provisions.  EPMI submitted comments in support of the complaint.  The case is on the Commission's agenda for Tuesday.

Subject:	Curve Changes

Here are the significant (non market related) curve changes that have effected our P&L in the last week...and also a working issue related with curve management.

PJM East Hub: 
   Summary : Hourly Scalars for East hub were changed, resulting in a ($2.3 million) loss.
   Reasons : Rob Benson had changed the West hub scalars a few months ago and those scalar changes never got transfered over to the East Hub curves. When the curve management function was moved from excel into the Enpower Curve Management system all the curves derived as a basis off West Hub curves started using the West Hub Scalars. 

Entergy Back End:
  Summary : Yesterday, Entergy 05 and beyond curves moved down in the range of $0.50/MWh to $1.65/MWh resulting in a loss of approximately $2.3million (held back because Mike Carson is fixing the curves today)

NY Curves:
  Summary : The onpeak and offpeak curves for NY Zones A, G and J require a thorough clean up especially with regards to the issues that are stated below. The P&L is still to be determined because curves have not been changed.


On Peak
1.  J-G Spread is marked over G-A Spread starting in Year 2009.
2.  J-A Spread blows up year on year, starting in Year 2005.

Offpeak
1.  Zone-G is marked above Zone-J half of the time;  occuring mostly in Q1, Q4 and Aug.
2.  Zone-A is marked above Zone-J every July in 2003-2006.  With the exception of 2002, for the month of July, Zone-A is marginally marked below Zone-J.
3.  Zone-A is marked above Zone-G for every July from 2003 to 2018 and Dec 2003.
4.  Zone-A, for every year, MarApr is over MayJun by a significant amount.

fyi re timing of recent other bank filings.  

Credit Suisse First Boston filed at FERC for power marketer authorization on July 23, 2001.  On September 18, 2001 FERC granted the authorization, effective 9/18/01 (57 days).

I am having trouble finding Bank of America's filing, so will let you know.

This guy claims to have an emerging solar generating technology that he is investigating the feasibility of.  I gave him a primer on what one would need to do to interconnect to the grid and sell to the market.  I invited him to call me if they get to the point of pitching this technology or if they are seeking development capital.  Are you ready to go long solar!!

Kevin -- 

I received this note from the EES Business Center.  Can someone from your shop follow-up?  I called this gentleman and couldn't get a definitive answer related to how the power is being generated or how much.  This may be a wild-goose chase.  I'm just not sure.

Preparations are continuing for our simulation on Thursday, Feb. 7 from 9-11 am.

During the simulation, you will be able to use your normal, "live" Stack Manager User ID and password, which will be emailed to you separately.

The attached word document below provides a basic review on Accessing the Stack Manager.  You should manage the same products as you normally would, even if those products are not expected to be going live on our initial launch day. If you have products that need to be created, please contact Kevin Meredith (3-9555) or Chris Walker (3-7533) with UBSWenergy.com immediately.

Trading Goals - for all traders participating in the simulation.
Log into the stack manager on Wednesday afternoon and ensure that your products are ready to be activated on Thursday morning. We will send you a reminder on Wednesday to advise you of the time when the application will be available.
Start and end with a flat position
Make markets in your respective products
Maintain tight spreads in the products you manage

NON-UBS PERSONNEL WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE OR TRANSACT ON PRODUCTS DURING THE SIMULATION.

Internal Originators will be playing the roles of customers and will be hitting your stacks throughout the simulation.  You will also be able to trade book to book via the website with your website User ID and password which will also be emailed separately.

Market "News" events may be emailed to you at certain points throughout the simulation (e.g. "storm in the gulf").

Immediately after the simulation, the website will be inactivated, so that the operations group can test the mid/back-office systems, while the IT groups clean-up the transaction data from the simulation. 

The system will be made available again for live, internal trading (book to book) between traders on Friday, February 8, 2002. FRIDAY'S TRADES ARE FOR REAL.

If you can't log into any application on the day or are having trouble with your systems, please contact the UBSWenergy.com Help Desk immediately at 713.584.4444

Regards,
UBSWenergy.com

Give me your opinion on Tim Belden's issue below please.  

Schedule 27.4 lists power fundamentals applications and the CLA says that the Enron Parties are licensing it to UBS.  I also talked with Bob Hillier on this and he agreed with me and said that the Enron Parties own everything and the schedule lists what we are licensing to UBS.  West Power Fundamentals was developed by the Enron Parties and is owned by the Enron Parties.

Let me know your thoughts.

Hi Beth,
I hate to be uncooperative, particularly after all that we have accomplished together, but I can't see where in the Enron/UBS agreement it says that Enron needs or gets to keep the West Power Fundamentals system.  Furthermore, I have no assurances that Enron is in a position to keep this information confidential as Richard Schweiger is rightfully looking for a new job.  Richard could easily understand what we are doing and use it to secure a job with AEP, Pacificorp or someone else here in town.  I don't mean to question Richard's integrity, but these are very strange times.

Until I receive word from UBS or Greg Whalley I am sitting tight.

Again, sorry to be uncooperative, but it doesn't appear to me that our interests are aligned right now and I need to protect our competitive advantage.

Regards,
Tim

All,

I have been requested to obtain a working copy of all fundamental systems.  The estate wants to preserve them and they should be available for use within the estate.

I will dedicate systems resources to working with your groups.  Your cooperation is greatly appreciated.

I will have Richard Burchfield coordinate these efforts.  Richard Schweiger will assist us in Portland.

Thanks,
Beth

If you need access to 3AC anytime that Saturday, you will need to contact Trizechan Properties beforehand with your security information (Jael Olson at 713-336-2300).  Anyone who attempts to enter the building on Saturday that is not on the list will be denied access.

Effective Monday, October 22, 2001 the following changes will be made to the Autohedge functionality on EnronOnline.

The volume on the hedge will now respect the minimum volume and volume increment settings on the parent product. See rules below: 

?	If the transaction volume on the child is less than half of the parent's minimum volume no hedge will occur.
?	If the transaction volume on the child is more than half the parent's minimum volume but less than half the volume increment on the parent, the hedge will volume will be the parent's minimum volume.
?	For all other volumes, the same rounding rules will apply based on the volume increment on the parent product.

Please see example below:

Parent's Settings:
Minimum: 	5000
Increment:  1000

Volume on Autohedge transaction			Volume Hedged
1      - 2499							0
2500 - 5499							5000
5500 - 6499							6000

AMERICAN EXPRESS MEMBERSHIP REWARDS ANNOUNCEMENT

All Membership Rewards accounts were cancelled when American Express cancelled the Enron/American Express Corporate Cards.  To redeem Membership Rewards Points earned, the Corporate Card Account must be paid to a zero balance.  Upon paying the account  to a zero balance you have two options to redeem the points:

1)  Establish a Personal Card account with American Express and have the points that were accrued on the Corporate Card transferred to the Personal Card.  To apply for a Personal Card over the phone you can call 1-800-The-Card (843-2273).  Cardmembers must transfer Membership Rewards points to the new card by March 1, 2002.

2) If you do not have a Personal Card and do not want to establish a Personal Card, you should call the American Express Membership Rewards Redemption Line at 1-800-297-3276 and ask to speak with the Executive Consumer Relations Desk.  You should identify yourself as an Enron employee and request that your Membership Rewards be reinstated.  Reinstated points must be redeemed before March 1, 2002.  

For information on all travel services, please contact Tracy Ramsey at (713) 853-6457.

Thursday Morning session----Meeting with State Commissioners


This session was generally known to be the occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at FERC taking action without including them in the decision making process.  Although the panel notice showed that 5 state commissioners would attend, upon arriving in the hearing room we found that 27 state commissioners were there and ready to claim their 15 minutes of fame.  It was a long morning!  I will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts. 

Approximately 35 to 40% of the commenters were supportive of FERC and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts.  Most of these comments came from the Midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support.  Everyone else was fairly verbal against FERC, primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process, that FERC was moving too quickly, and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens.  In particular, the commissioners from Maryland and North Carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric. While many would think that the session was extremely negative (our friend Sarah Novosel thought it was disgusting!) in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearing--allowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis.

Here's some individual comments:

Catherine Riley/Maryland---she started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the MAryland commission and immediately implied that FERC was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens (she was way overboard in the dramatics department).  She then stated that she was not at the meeting to "help you (FERC) backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record".  It went on like this for about 15 minutes.  The good part is that she was so personally negative, that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her.

Sam Ervin/NOrth Carolina---he was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens, that customer choice is never coming to his state, so he will never benefit from an RTO, that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an RTO (and I bet if they do, he'll work to change the statutes!) and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of FERC. His comments were also pretty brutal, but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor.

Arnetta McRae/Delware---she kept on saying "show me" where the benefits for consumers are.  She also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order.  

Rory McMinn/New Mexico---repeatedly talked about how the west was different, how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers, how the FERC commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were. 

Carl Wood/California--tried to portray himself and California as representing the west as a whole, and even brought along a statement from the Washington commission echoeing his comments. He delivered the same messages that we've been hearing forever---FERC should have acted sooner on price caps, etc etc.

Glen Thomas/Pennsylvania---he was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring it's energy system into the new century...that by opening it's markets they have had an explosion in green power, they have reduced costs all across the state, etc. He was very supportive of PJM (makes sense because it's in his back yard) and stated that for any RTO to be effective it must have independent governance.  

Judy Jones/Ohio---was very parochial in her discussion, but echoed Don Svanda's comments from earlier in the week that one RTO for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the FERC to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed.

Ed GArvey/Minnesota---he got the gold star for the day.  After very very lengthly comments from about 15 commissioners, he took about 1 minute and said "FERC--just get it done"....in essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward.

Other Commissioners who talked were:  Arthur/Connecticut, Hadley/Indiana, Huelsman/Kentucky, Nugent/ Maine  all on the positive side.  Other negative commentors were two guys from DC and Jim Irvin from Arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do.


>From the FERC commissioner standpoint, the gold star went to Massey.  After hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didn't feel that they had been included and that FERC had not consulted them enough, he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back, saying the "there has been 7 years of process, and he wants a process that comes to an end....you've been talking for 7 years and never could agree..."


Call me if I can provide any further insights into the individual comments or the tenor of the meeting.  Sue.  #612-339-4599

FERC to give states a role in RTO formation



By Chris Baltimore (Reuters) WASHINGTON, Oct 24 (Reuters)

U.S. federal energy regulators on Wednesday pledged to
create a new body to cooperate with state officials on the
planning of regional transmission grid combinations after
complaints that they were left out of the process.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which oversees
the country's power grid operators, has ordered utilities
in the Southeast, Northeast, Midwest and West to combine
their assets into a handful of regional transmission
organizations (RTOs) by the end of the year.

The agency has pushed hard to create the RTOs to avoid a
repeat of the power crisis in California last winter, in
which the antiquated U.S. grid prevented more power from
flowing into the state.

FERC commissioners acknowledged on Wednesday that some
changes were needed to address criticism from state
utilities regulators that they were left out of the RTO
rule-making process.

STATES GET SEAT AT THE TABLE

FERC Commissioner Nora Mead Brownell, a former
Pennsylvania regulatory official, proposed creating a
regional council that would share authority between FERC
and states on setting RTO policies.

Citing states' confusion about FERC's direction and
inconsistent internal agency communication, Brownell, in a
memo to commissioners, said the council "can provide the
necessary flexibility that we will likely need moving
forward to RTO formation."

The request was made by David Svanda, commissioner of the
Michigan Public Service Commission, on behalf of six other
Midwest states at FERC's workshop on RTOs last week.

The move is "a ceding of jurisdiction ... to state
regulators for us to co-govern the process with them,"
FERC Chairman Pat Wood told reporters after the meeting.
Wood previously headed Texas' state utility regulatory
agency.

Of state commissions, Wood said "they need to be invited
with a nice seat at the table, not just standing at the
door taking tickets."

COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS PROMISED

FERC also promised to prepare a formal cost-benefit
analysis of RTOs for states and consumers, after some
states raised concerns that the costs did not justify the
benefits. The agency did not say when the study would be
completed.

On Tuesday, the New York Independent System Operator (ISO)
released its own cost-benefit study, which asserted the
creation of a large Northeastern RTO could boost consumer
power bills by some $90 million a year.

The non-profit New York ISO would also be put out of
business by a regional for-profit RTO.

However, a separate study issued last month by energy firm
Mirant Corp , a supporter of RTOs, concluded that a
Northeastern RTO would save consumers $440 million
annually.

At the meeting, FERC commissioners heard staff
presentations on RTO development progress in the
Southeast, Northeast and Midwest.

But few new details emerged on the ultimate direction FERC
will take in guiding utilities.

Wood said that more specifics would be available at the
next meeting on Nov. 7, just a month ahead of FERC's Dec.
15 deadline for RTO membership.

Under FERC's plan, the RTOs would be for-profit groups in
the U.S. Northeast, Midwest, Southeast and West. Each
region would combine public utility transmission
facilities to provide open access, more reliable power and
lower rates for consumers.

Standardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices <?xml:namespace prefix=
 =3D o ns =3D "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" />

Panelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy =
Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Chr=
istiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC Gene=
ral Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnes=
ota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Co=
mpany.

 General Observations

 The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left l=
ate in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, =
the commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% o=
f all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed;=
 much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seem=
ed very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry f=
orward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover fo=
rward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize th=
at some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed =
to be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was =
discussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take th=
e reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was notice=
able conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two or=
ganizations somewhat common during the discussions.=20

 FERC Deliverables

A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry ne=
eded from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they =
felt was critical. =20

The first major topic was "How many RTOs?  What is their scope?"  All panel=
ists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately b=
y FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific langua=
ge, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.

The next topic was, "What will be standard market design?"  Panelists varie=
d on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged f=
or one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid sta=
ndard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (=
followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the curre=
nt situation.

The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding wha=
t the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic=
 throughout their discussions, asking questions like, "Do we need to issue =
a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?" and, "How much detail do you=
 need us to provide?"   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they =
wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as t=
o say FERC should "Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a=
 little further."  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, bu=
t in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and t=
he need for cautious investigation. =20

One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Sc=
heduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in th=
e "RTO Design and RTO Implementation" section would address many of the que=
stions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Korm=
os indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying =
a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The se=
ction to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following =
questions:


?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occu=
r, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that i=
s nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there=
 be others that must be accommodated?


?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to sch=
edule ("covered" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protect=
ing from congestion charges (both "covered" and "uncovered" schedules are a=
llowed)?=20


?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission =
services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues=
 to be addressed?


?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing pr=
ior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to reti=
re those contracts?  Are there other solutions?


?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function?=
 Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules)=
, be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced sche=
dules), or will they be required at all?


?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed =
in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary=
 services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as fina=
ncial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?


?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses? =
 Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling proce=
ss, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technical=
ly unwieldy?


?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrate=
d into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that =
non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to t=
reat each NJE as a separate entity?


Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critica=
l questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which =
to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions=
, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., "do congestion management") will t=
ake a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., "LMP with financi=
al hedging instruments") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike =
about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible =
to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.

Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) refer=
red to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentrati=
on of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out=
 said, "My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't =
believe that that statement is true."  He then backpedaled a bit and said t=
hat it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assert=
ion by the Northwest interests was false.


NERC and GISB


A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-se=
tting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, "Are we looking at a bea=
uty contest between NERC and GISB?"  Cook and Boswell then went into severa=
l short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants cont=
inually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interesting=
ly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GI=
SB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the "new" structure of NERC and=
 did not focus on its history.

Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly a=
sking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were=
 they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily a=
ble to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancin=
g of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Poin=
t, Brownell.

Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-m=
an.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's suppos=
ed "successes," such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will =
likely remember that these "successes" have not been so successful, resulti=
ng in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments=
 in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show=
 the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.

There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues=
, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some =
talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.

The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly ur=
ged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leade=
rship to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC s=
omewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would=
 say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

Sorry for the delay in updating you, but we've spent this past week working through credit-related issues in support of this transaction.  I've attached our most recent communication to Calpine, and we have begun discussions on which market regions can be supported under this transaction by Calpine's merchant portfolio.  We will be meeting with Calpine next Tuesday to discuss the size of the transaction and determine the positions and regions that best suit Enron & Calpine.  We will continue to push for PJM-E and Nepool components based on our earlier discussions, but I suspect FRCC volumes will end up being much less than listed in the term sheet below.  

Dana, currently EES has subscribed for the 50mw RTC energy listed in the term sheet below.  I will follow up with you today to see if you have any interest in expanding our Nepool subscription.

Timeline is still a little uncertain, but we are pushing to close by Nov 15.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks

- Jim


FYI - here is the most recent VAR analysis we ran on these positions (based on positions in the book on 10/4/01)

A collegue in the Houston office forwarded on a message from Kevin that I should contact you to set up some telephone interviews with the following people;

Kevin Presto (VP - head of East Power Trading)
Fletcher Sturm (VP - head of midwest trading - East Power)
Dana Davis (VP - head of northeast trading - East Power).

Could you let me know a possible schedule? I'm available anytime this week, including any evening (London time) calls.

Many thanks,

I think this guy should be independent from the fundies.   There may be special projects that are "highly confidential" in nature that should be directed by you, Hunter, Tim and myself.   I think Robert would be more successful in a freelance role.

Other input?

Hi John- thanks for the generous offer which I have accepted.  A couple of outstanding questions- 

1. Who am I reporting to?  I would welcome the opportunity to report to you or Greg.  I think my job was a lot easier in the past because our group had the backing of the Office of the Chair. This gave us credibility, independence, and the chance to contribute to strategic issues as well as the tactical issues of interest to the traders. However, I am obviously open to any reporting relationship you might suggest and I understand that my day-to-day duties will consist largely of interaction with the Fundy teams.

2. Are there any slots that have opened because of offers that were not accepted?  I would love to be able to take one of the folks from my group with me, particularly Kristin Walsh or my assistant Sharon Purswell.

Thanks again for the great offer and the chance to join UBS.

Robert

Let me share something with you.  I have included a link of the manufacturer's pricing to the Dealer-by Kelley Blue Book.(New or Pre-Owned)  There's no need to run all over town shopping for a vehicle.  You just drive to the person who shows you the real numbers.(Me)  By attaching the link for dealer cost, it will be obvious that you are getting a GREAT DEAL!(Wholesale Price)  I'll try to make this as easy as possible folks.  If you are not ready at this time, that's okay!   This is not a high pressure car buying program.  What I do ask of you is that you WRITE DOWN & REMEMBER who got you all of the pertinent information to make your car buying decision.(Ken Finney)  See below.. 
  
Some of you don't know it yet, but your company may be a partner with Ford.  If this is the case, you may be eligible for additional incentives.  This is applicable to New Vehicles only!  I just need to know who you work for... 
  
Trade-in Vehicles: 
Here's the area where everyone is quite skeptical.  I will give you what I call an Actual Cash Value!(yes, a real #)  I find it much easier to deal with real numbers.  We can talk more about this arena later if you wish. 
  
I will not lose your business over price with anyone!  Bring me a deal from another Ford Dealer and I'll beat it!  If I don't have it in-stock, I'll find it and get here!(New or Pre-Owned)  I HAVE ACCESS TO FORD/LINCOLN/MERCURY PRODUCTS! 
  
Call or email me with a valid phone number if you're interested in discussing more of the details.  I'm available at all times at one of the numbers below.  If for some reason I am not able to get to the phone, just leave me a message and I will return the call shortly.

Donnie/Kristin/Scott/Narsimha

Origination has instructed us to unwind this deal due to a Material Adverse Change clause tied to our Credit Rating.  The contract has been reviewed and we will dispute their interpretation.  In any event, we should unwind effective immediately.  Please show me what the unwind value is 1) at our mids and 2) at our bids.  We typically unwind at bids but given the circumstances and size of the exposure I may make an exception.  I anticipate an unwind loss in the amount of -$4.5 -  -$5.0 MM.  The negative unwind value is a result of credit clauses/non-uniform contract provision and, as such, should be passed back to Origination.  I would expect Origination to handle any futher pass-through to Credit directly with Credit.  I have made Origination/Legal aware of our cost pass-through. 

Thanks for your help,
Rogers

What does further legal review?

Both TXU Electric and Dayton Power are slightly in-the-money physical power=
 positions.  If there is a chance that we determine that these are not vali=
d terminations, we need to begin to reschedule power, I assume?  Given they=
 are in the money, can we complete our legal review quickly.

Thanks

I assume we are doing everything necessary to insure that we will have all of our customers switched for 1/1/02.  If anyone knows any different then please speak up now.  In all seriousness, we cannot accept mistakes or slip-ups on this one.  The pilot transfers appear to have been much more difficult than I would have anticipated.

Does everyone have the info they need?
Who is communicating with the ISO?
DO we have all of the data we need for the customers?
What are the deadlines for notification?
Does this group feel we need to get together to discuss any open issues?

Please let me know if anyone feels uncomfortable with our getting there.

Thanks,
Rogers

Subject:	ERCOT physical delivery update

Changes from last week in red.

Retail load
About 18 MW peak, 17 MW off-peak. 
October 4th - First account was switched. 
By November 6th - Remaining accounts will be switched
Issue - Some Lockheed Martin accounts that aren't in the batch.
Issue - Trying to get positions correctly reflected in positions report - Jeff Jackson
Issue - Data we are getting from RPS is incorrect.

Interface with EWS Wholesale
To date - Met with EPMI and discussed management (when will position be transferred? how? at what price?) of retail position. Tom May to discuss with Rogers. 
Issue - How will we pass through intrazonal congestion costs? This isn't an issue for the pilot, but will be an issue on 1/1/2002.

Intramonth book development
November 1 - Expect to have volume management/reporting capability. 
November 1 - Expect to have MTM calculations
???- Expect to have all other reporting capabilities functioning. Will meet with Richard Bird this week to develop a new timeline.

Working with CSC to develop a method to obtain actual customer usage on a timely basis.

Load forecasting
Issue - There is a significant difference (at least in % terms) between the Packaged Ice position per the positions report and Frazier's forecast. Appears the majority of this difference is due to some Packaged Ice accounts being booked more than once.
Issue - Forecasting by zone (vs. at the account level) may lead to inaccuracies in P&L reporting.

?	Customer switching process
Jeff Merola to determine roles and responsibilities

?	Site profile
Site profile desk has processed the pilot program deals. 
Met with the desk to discuss the other (non-pilot program) deals that we expect to switch 1/1/202.

Also,  I am concerned that Narsimha may have someone from the outside trying to recruit him.  I am pressing him on the contract and he is telling me everything's ok - lawyer reviewing, etc.  I am going to give him another day or so and then just call him on it.  I think there is better money out there, even in this market and do not want to lose him.  Honestly, Joe, Juan and Narsimha are the only commodity guys I can count on to do what is right - amazing.  You may want to ask Narsimha about the contract if you see him.

I agree with this approach and I'm fine with this allocation.   My objective is to get everything as accurate as possible so the proper price signal is being sent to retail and wholesale origination.   I caught the scalar issue when we were looking at 4 hour tolls vs. 8 hour tolls vs. 16 hour and I could tell there was a disconnect.

thanks.

I think it is appropriate to instruct Risk to put the charges associated with the PJM scalar in the Change Deal Bucket as this was out of the Retail Commodity Group's control.  I am trying to hold these guys accountable for positions, p/l and such and I think this is the only way to fairly account for results that they could affect vs. someone else's error/mismark.  Let me know if you think this is appropriate.

I have sent the message again to make curves as accurate as possible through 2015.    We are doing are best.   The Entergy situation was simply a back office mistake.   The NY off-peak is a work in progress and will get better every day.   The legs never trade, only the cals, therefore, we have to use common sense for month values.

Thanks for the info.   In most cases, Narsima is exactly right.

Subject:	Curve Changes

Here are the significant (non market related) curve changes that have effected our P&L in the last week...and also a working issue related with curve management.

PJM East Hub: 
   Summary : Hourly Scalars for East hub were changed, resulting in a ($2.3 million) loss.
   Reasons : Rob Benson had changed the West hub scalars a few months ago and those scalar changes never got transfered over to the East Hub curves. When the curve management function was moved from excel into the Enpower Curve Management system all the curves derived as a basis off West Hub curves started using the West Hub Scalars. 

Entergy Back End:
  Summary : Yesterday, Entergy 05 and beyond curves moved down in the range of $0.50/MWh to $1.65/MWh resulting in a loss of approximately $2.3million (held back because Mike Carson is fixing the curves today)

NY Curves:
  Summary : The onpeak and offpeak curves for NY Zones A, G and J require a thorough clean up especially with regards to the issues that are stated below. The P&L is still to be determined because curves have not been changed.


On Peak
1.  J-G Spread is marked over G-A Spread starting in Year 2009.
2.  J-A Spread blows up year on year, starting in Year 2005.

Offpeak
1.  Zone-G is marked above Zone-J half of the time;  occuring mostly in Q1, Q4 and Aug.
2.  Zone-A is marked above Zone-J every July in 2003-2006.  With the exception of 2002, for the month of July, Zone-A is marginally marked below Zone-J.
3.  Zone-A is marked above Zone-G for every July from 2003 to 2018 and Dec 2003.
4.  Zone-A, for every year, MarApr is over MayJun by a significant amount.

Rika,
For months we had no meetings, now all of a sudden I'm bringing one up
almost every week.

This meeting Fred said would be very beneficial to attend.  It occurs Nov
1&2, 2001.  It concerns nuclear industry consolidation and deregulation
issues.  It is covering a full range of important issues in our forecasting
analysis including licensing, inspection, enforcement & assessment,
decommissioning, deregulation, etc.

Again, I brought this up to Fred to see if he agreed on the import of this
meeting, and he strongly suggested we attend.

Let me know as soon as possible because it is scheduled for this week.

Thanks,
Dan

Dear PIRA Retainer Client,
To those of you who attended last  week's Annual Retainer Client Seminar, thank you for making the trip to New York  and for helping us make the Seminar an unqualified success.  I think PIRA consultants and clients  alike were reassured by the robust turnout and the overall enthusiasm that  accompanied the event.
As a further service to you, as well  as to those clients who could not attend in person, please note that the 2001  Seminar material (data tables and slide presentations) is available to you in  electronic format via PIRA Online. The direct link is http://www.pira.com/seminar/seminar.htm .  By end-week, we intend for the audio portion of the presentations to also be  available online.
I look forward to seeing you at next  year's seminar (tentatively scheduled for Oct. 9-10, 2001), if not sooner during  my travels.
Sincerely
Gary N. Ross
Chief Executive  Officer
PIRA Energy Group

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

(1)  I've reconfirmed through Documentation that Wabash's termination, (stated to be effective Dec 19, 2001) was as to all wholesale power transactions between EPMI and Wabash.

(2) GPU Services has delivered a notice of termination as to all transactions with EPMI. We will be treating all wholesale power Transactions with GPU as terminated but have not had to make a final concluision as to the effective date of such termination. (They've sought to make their terminations effective Dec.21, 2001, though they had to give us a month's notice on the agrement by which EPMI sells to GPU, so that termination weffective date would be January 21, 2001.)

(3) Ameren Energy Inc. has sent us a notice of termination dated December 18, 2001, which appears to be a termination and calculation of settlement payment as to all transactions with Enron Power Marketing, Inc. -- I am trying to obtain a verification on the breaadth of this termination notice.

Ed --I'll send you copies of these termination notices for your reference. -David

Kevin/Gerald:

Elizabeth Sager indicated that Wabash has given appropriate termination notice on all transactions associated with the EEI. I will confirm with David Portz to make sure their termination notice covers any one off contracts in the event they exist.


David:

Are there any one off contracts and does the Wabash termination notice cover if there are? Please advise.

Stopped by this morning, but I think you were at the Houstonian.

I appreciate you guys thinking of me for the forward/cash position, but I think it might be a better fit to tie it in with the Entergy Trader (Carson I think).

I'll try to catch up with you guys later this afternoon.

Guys,

You have been selected to complete the telephone screening of external candidates for second and final round.  Each  candidate will be screened by two traders to ensure agreement on quality of candidates.   (these resumes have already been selected from c. 200 resumes by some of the ENA Traders).  

As in the previous Trading Track recruiting event, you will be given a few days to complete this.  The candidates will be expecting your call, there is no set interview time therefore allowing you flexibility to call in the evening from home if necessary.   Resumes, telephone numbers etc will reach your desk tomorrow morning.   All phone screens to be completed by Tuesday pm: 16th October.

Any questions please call myself or Adrianne Engler.

Thanks,

 Karen.

If you have not already taken your drug test , please do so by Tuesday, 5th February.   This process needs to be completed and results fed back to UBS prior to your start date.   You cannot commence employment with UBS until they have this data which takes approximately 5 days from date of test.

If for any reason you cannot take this test by tomorrow, please advise.    Also, if you have completed your test please let me know so I can update the UBS records.


Regards,

Karen.

With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee. However, because these buses passes are fully subsidized they must be treated as "taxable" income. Excluding the first $65 of the bus pass, the remaining value is subject to taxation, collectively referred to as "imputed tax". See example below

Example: A $100 pass is chosen by an employee. 

Subsidy for Bus Pass		$100.00
Exclusion amount			$  65.00

Taxable Income amount		$  35.00

If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

ERCOT is obligated to perform weather sensitivity analysis on all IDR ESI IDs according to section 11.3.3.1 of the Protocols.  The weather responsiveness determination process establishes the proxy-day selection methodology that will be used to estimate consumption when IDR ESI IDs do not have meter data available for settlement.  This email is to notify market participants that this analysis has been completed as prescribed in the Protocols.  
 
ERCOT has modified the original process such that the analysis only produces a report identifying IDR ESI IDs that are weather sensitive.  These reports have been generated and they will be forwarded to the appropriate TDSPs and the LSEs.  The TDSP is responsible for submitting 814_20 EDI transactions corresponding to the most current meter read date to change the Profile IDs that have been determined to be weather sensitive. This process should begin immediately. The portion of the report being provided to the LSE is for informational purposes only. 
 
ERCOT will establish a mechanism to ensure the TDSPs have completed the process of updating the Profile ID changes.  TDSPs should complete changes to Profile IDs no later than the end of March 2002.   Since ERCOT manually maintains ESI IDs for NOIE wholesale delivery points, ERCOT will perform the Profile ID changes for NOIE ESI IDs.
 
TDSPs must continue to assign a non-weather sensitive (NWS) Profile ID to any new ESI IDs.  IDR ESI IDs determined to be weather sensitive by ERCOT shall remain weather sensitive (WS) until such time as ERCOT notifies the TDSP otherwise.  
 
ERCOT will perform the annual weather sensitivity analysis again in November of 2002 based upon 2002 meter data and weather data and provide reports to TDSPs and LSEs for any changes to Profile IDs. 
 
If you have any further questions, please call your ERCOT client service representative.

- Robinson out.
- Wood done s/t putting location in his offer
- Llodra outstanding: we did not make any of his requested changes.  We sent him the new standard doc with 175/175.  Audrey Martin is talking with him with the objective of explaining why none of his changes were made.  John is showing the new doc to his lawyer and we will discuss Monday. 
- Everyone else is signed (Curry, Cross, Pacheco, Rorschach, Abler, Furrow, Donovan, Valderama, Meyn)

Assuming Llodra is in, we have one hole to fill.  Alternatives to consider:

1. Have Curry give up texas gas and take Texas/SE  Power.
2. Split the world up between Llodra, Curry and Furrow
3. Have Vickers look after SE Power in addition to gas
4. Bring in someone from Enron (Pagan, Wiggs, etc.)
5. ID someone from your trading team to be lead marketer for a region
5. Do nothing and see if a leader emerges

No Cold Weather In Sight

Tropical Storm / Hurricane Chances Increase for the Eastern Gulf / Florida



Sorry this is late today - my home system has been down much of the day due
to road runner issues.

Today's and yesterday's models showed fairly unanimously that a progressive
weather pattern is in store for the first 10 days of November. As discussed
on Friday - this will keep any long lasting  or substantial cold air from
penetrating into the nation. It looks wet in the Pacific Northwest and
overall mild for the eastern Interconnect. This week the cold air will be
leaving and a strong warming trend will occur for the mid and latter parts
of the week. The mornings will continue to be rather cold in New England
through the middle of the week.

A tropical disturbance in the Carribean will have to be watched closely. As
usual, there are a variety of possibilities with this varying from nothing
at all to the formation of a tropical storm or hurricane. If anything did
develop - it is still unlikely to affect production as it probably would
drift north toward the eastern Gulf of Mexico or into Florida. This is all
speculation at this point as there is only thunderstorms down there now. We
should have a couple of days to determine the threat, if any, to production.

In the far long term beyond the 10th of November, yes there are some weak
signs of a pattern change but so far, I have seen no evidence that suggests
any cold weather pattern will lock in anytime soon. Earth Sat's 6 to 10 day
for tomorrow will probably look similar to the 11 to 15 day that Earth Sat
had from Friday. A little below normal in the Northeast / Lakes while mostly
normal or even normal to above elsewhere. Earth Sat has had an overall cold
bias lately. It is pretty likely that the market will not see a major
"locking in" of a cold pattern tomorrow either.

Bottom line, pretty normal progression of weather heading into November.
Plenty of cold air up there in northern Canada, more than usual, but see no
reason right now to get excited for cold weather in the short term.

We need to have everything in 30 days.  I know that.

The question is given everything else - FERC MBR, gas pipelines, PJM, etc. - isn't it better to move into ERCOT at the wholesale level and then come back after getting the rest of the market moving along?

>From a resource standpoint, I need to understand how to get PUCT counsel for UBS to start the REP process anyway.

MARKET NOTIFICATION OF SYSTEM CHANGE

PIP Number(s):        144, 200



PRR Number(s):       294



Protocol Section(s):   4.4.4, 6.3.1, 11.4.1.1



Implementation Date:     January 18, 2002



Description of System Change:

ERCOT plans to implement PIP 144/PRR 294 (Load Ratio Shares per LSE) and
PIP 200 (LSE Load Ratio and Loss Allocation) on January 18, 2002.   The
Protocol revision for PIP 144 impacts sections 4.4.4 and 6.3.1 of the
Protocols.  The revision for PIP 200 is documented in section 11.4.1.1
of the protocols.

Currently, ERCOT calculates ancillary service obligations for each QSE
for a given trade day based on the QSE's aggregated Load Ratio Share as
of the same day of the prior week.  This results in the use of QSE/LSE
relationships from one week prior to calculate ancillary service
obligations.  When an LSE switches from one QSE to another, the
obligation associated with its load continue to be allocated to the old
QSE for one week after the effective date of the switch.  The same
obligation does not get allocated to the new QSE for the first week
after the switch.  QSEs also do not have access to Load Ratio Share data
per LSE that makes up their ancillary service obligations.

This modification will alter the way the QSE Load Ratio Shares are
aggregated so that ancillary service obligations are calculated based on
the QSE/LSE relationships that will be effective on the trade day for
which obligations are being posted.  Load Ratio Shares will be
calculated and saved by LSE during the data aggregation process run for
initial settlement of the trade day in question.  QSE Load Ratio Share
will then be aggregated and posted for a given trade day based on the
sum of LSE Load Ratio Shares calculated as described above corresponding
to the most current QSE/LSE relationships for that trade day.

Scheduled Extract Changes:  Billing determinants for LSE Load Ratio
Shares called LRSLSE will be added to the load extract.  Each QSE will
have the LRSLSE fields added to its load extract for each LSE it
represents.  Each LSE will also have the LRSLSE field added to its load
extract with its Load Ratio Share information.

Dynamic Extract:  The Settlement and Billing folder within the archive
extracts area of the portal will have an additional dynamic extract
folder added called "Obligations".  This dynamic extract folder will
have two extracts called "QSE obligations" and "LSE obligations" which
can be used to query Load Ratio Shares by QSE and LSE.  The following
ERCOT total quantities will also be added to the dynamic extracts above:

?        Total obligated non-spinning quantity (NSOTOT)

?        Total obligated regulation down quantity (RDOTOT)

?        Total obligated responsive reserve quantity (RROTOT)

?        Total obligated regulation up quantity (RUOTOT)



You can find details of PRR-294 at the following link:
http://www.ercot.com/AboutERCOT/PublicDisclosure/ProtocolRev.htm .

If you have any questions, please call your ERCOT client service
representative.

Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) will come out with earnings on Tuesday.

JNJ is currently trading high in its 30 day trading range. 
The 30 day high is 60.18. 
The 30 day low is 56.23.
JNJ with two hours to close of market is now at 59.85. 

JNJ has trended up and in the opposite direction of the Dow in the recent market selloff as investors have moved to safety.

I look for JNJ to swing down from here in its tight 30 day range.

I look to short JNJ now and cover a little under 59.

JNJ is not volatile.
This is a mediocre trade at best and only good for 1 to 1.5 points.
If JNJ continues rallying I look to continue shorting and wait for the 2 to 3 point downswing that will follow.

Yesterday's recommendation of a short MSFT position was a much stronger idea.
But this is Friday's report.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Harley Davidson (HDI) released strong earnings last night. 

The stock rallied to as high as 55.50 (up 1.20) and has since retrenched to 54 (down 0.30).

Harley is a strong short candidate at any point over 55.
It trades down from there into its 30 day range.

Kevin & Tim:

Last week I spoke to Janet about the probable departure of Sean Holmes from EES Deal Management to EES Europe.  Janet discussed several alternatives for Deal Management and asked for my suggestions.  My suggestion is as follows:

Berney Aucoin would assume oversight of all Retail Power Structurning and Deal Management activities.  Initially, keep Deal Management separate under Deb Merrill's direction and Structuring under Edith's direction.  DSM, LC, DG would probably need to fall under Berney as well.  I would anticipate that the functional separation that currently exists between Deal Managment and Structuring would begin to go away over the next 3 - 6 months as we intersperse our more experienced people and everyone in general gets up the curve.  Thus, I would expect that we could merge Deal Managemnt and Strcuturing into one group in the near future.

I spoke to Berney and he thinks this makes sense and is up for the job.  Edith is still planning to move into a commercial Origination role at year end but I believe we could have a replacement by then.

Janet and the EES group have definitely bought into this idea - I think they would like to implement.  Janet would expect dual reporting of the Group (to EES and EWS) and I indicated that, if implemented, I did not see a problem and as far as I was concerned nothing would change - Berney reiterated this directly.

I apoloigize if you are reading this feeling as though I have taken the liberty to suggest material changes without getting full buy-in, but 1) things aren't done and 2) I wanted to suggest something that I felt made sense before some alternative plan was proposed and in execution mode.

Please let me know what you think and whether you feel Lavo would have any problems.

Thanks,
Rogers

Kevin -

FYI.  Yesterday am ConEd abruptly cancelled the meeting we had with them to discuss this strategy.  They had been anxious to discuss this concept.  My guess is that the recent events led them to back off a little.  

Any new developments up there re: trading partners?

October 10, 2001





The Honorable Pat Wood, III, Chairman
The Honorable William Massey, Commissioner
The Honorable Linda Breathitt, Commissioner
The Honorable Nora Brownell, Commissioner
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
888 First Street, N.E.
Washington, D.C. 20426

Dear Commissioners:

        We are writing to express our strong reservations
regarding the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
(FERC) movement toward mandating four (West, Midwest,
Northeast, Southeast) regional transmission organizations
(RTOs).

        While we acknowledge that RTOs could, in theory,
lead to a more efficient and well-functioning wholesale
electricity market, we are concerned that FERC is
promoting RTOs in the belief that they are inherently
beneficial, with little regard for whether the operational
details associated with the various RTOs will actually
lead to lower costs or increased efficiency and
reliability when applied in the real world.

        We don't believe RTOs are inherently good or bad.
Whether the benefits of an RTO outweigh the costs depends
on the details of a given proposal and the attributes of a
given market.  We are concerned that full consideration of
those issues will be sacrificed under an artificial FERC
deadline and a national perspective that disregards the
specific features of the Pacific Northwest grid.

        As Members of Congress from the Northwest, we are
particularly interested in, and have been following
closely, the development of RTO West.  We commend the
inclusive stakeholder process that has brought together
the RTO West filing utilities, urban and rural public
utilities, industrial customers, Indian tribes, and other
interested consumers to debate the details of RTO West.

        There is still a vigorous debate among the
stakeholders in our region on issues such as pricing,
congestion management, and how much authority RTO West
should have to mandate construction, demand-side
management or other measures to deal with reliability and
congestion problems.  While we each have our own opinions
about what the result of this debate should be, we are
united in the belief that it would be extremely
unfortunate if the consensus-building

Letter to FERC regarding RTOs
October 10, 2001

process in our region was preempted by FERC action that
would mandate a West-wide RTO or require that RTO West and
WestConnect (formerly Desert Star) merge into a single
organization.  We would also oppose the FERC setting
standardized national rules for RTOs on issues like
pricing and congestion management.  The Northwest needs
the flexibility to do what is best for our region given
the unique characteristics of our grid.  We still expect
the ongoing negotiations to resolve seams issues and
similar operational concerns between the three RTOs under
consideration in the Western United States will meet the
requirements for an efficient wholesale market to
function.

        Finally, we would respectfully request that the
FERC mandate independent, cost-benefit analyses for each
RTO.  It is important for stakeholders and consumers to
see a bottom line evaluation of the cost and benefits to
end-use consumers in each affected state.  This is
especially true for ratepayers in the Northwest who are
being subjected to rate increases of 20-40 percent or more
and are dubious of any overhaul of how electricity is
delivered if it could mean even further price hikes.

        Vigorous, independent cost-benefit studies must be
done for all RTOs if they are to have any credibility.
While the theoretical benefits of an RTO (like increased
reliability and efficiency) may ultimately exist, those
benefits may be outweighed by increased costs to consumers
for generation or transmission service.  This is
particularly important for our region, which, due to the
presence of the Bonneville Power Administration, has
generally had a reliable, open-access transmission system
even in the absence of an RTO.  We are pleased that RTO
West has commissioned an independent cost-benefit
analysis, but it is still unclear whether the scope of the
report will be satisfactory.

        Thank you, in advance, for your careful
consideration of our concerns.  We would appreciate an
opportunity to meet with you to discuss these issues
further and look forward to working with you to ensure a

Kevin - I just realized I hadn't thanked you for your help in getting the hourly scalars done for power that I required for the proper valuation of my Real Option products.  They are all done. Thanks!

By the way, you had mentioned in your email that they may have some applications for EWS.  Is anyone using them up there?  

Thanks again and happy trading!

Beth

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Ongoing Legislation to Protect The Electric Power Industry to be discussed at CBI's Safety and Security in the Electric Power Industry Conference

 Woburn, MA, January 30 2002--  Last night in his state of the Union Address President Bush had mentioned that they have found diagrams of American Nuclear power plants and water facilities in terrorist camps. The "Attack on America" on September 11th and subsequent developments have necessitated a quantum shift in Safety and Security in the Electric Power Industry.  The threat and scope of malicious and purposeful sabotage today is much greater than that of natural disasters. Therefore, the Center for Business Intelligence has developed the "Safety and Security in the Electric Power Industry" conference.

Power industry executives will examine the impact of heightened security measures on their companies' day-to-day operations.  Crucial factors that will be discussed include strengthening data security and protecting against cybercrime.  The planning and creating inherently resilient infrastructures and assisting policymakers in developing adequate legislation to safeguard the nation's energy supply and distribution.  Hear about Security measures that these industry leaders are adopting: Utilicorp United, Inc., Rochester Gas & Electric Corporation, PEPCO, National Regulatory Research Institute, National Association of Regulated Utility Commissioners, Electric Power Research Institute and many more.

Representative Jeff Morris of the Washington State Legislature and Chair of the House Telecommunications, Technology and Energy Committee will keynote at CBI's Safety and Security in the Electric Power Industry. http://www.cbinet.com/events/PB231/index.html  The Federal Bureau of Investigation will discuss how Houston's National Infrastructure Protection Center benefits the energy industry.

Join this outstanding group of speakers at the only conference that gives electric power executives the chance to benchmark their security procedures with peers and experts.   To register for this crucial conference please call toll free 1-800-817-8601 or email cbireg@cbinet.com or please visit our website at http://www.cbinet.com/events/PB231/index.html

Kevin,

Do we need to go back to getting breakfast and lunch?  The guys are going in the kitchen and eating the Gas Desk food....I can get it set up with the Gas Desk so that we are included or we can do it separate....we will just need to budget again for it.  

Let me know your thoughts.

Thanks

Hi Kevin,

Apologies if this is the wrong Kevin Presto, but I ran across your name
on the Enron website.  In my previous job, I used to do a lot of work
with Enron on overseas ventures and was surprised to see your name on
the website.  Did you grow up in the Tri-Cities, Washington, and attend
Bethlehem Lutheran School?  If so, I am not sure if you remember me, but

I also went to BLS and was your classmate.

Drop me a line if I have the right person.  Would be interested to
hear about your work at Enron and what you have done in the interim
after leaving Washington state.

Chris Engstrom

Attached is the final draft of this paper for comment.  It incorporates the comments of those who responded but there is time for further redrafting.  However, given the filing deadline (Wednesday) further changes are likely to be wordsmithing unless someone vehemently objects to the structure.

regards
Mike ext. 57634

PS.  There were no objections to my thoughts on structure so we have concentrated on the rationale supporting RTO's and effective spot markets as mechanisms that achieve the goals of ICAP (i.e A spot market is Enrons solution).  We then state that if others have different views, any resulting separate iCap proposal if implemented should be interim in nature and minimise spot market distortions.  Finally we attach a simple interim solution as an appendix (so it does not detract from our main argument structure) so that if there is an ongoing debate we will be able to take part...

Kevin the meeting went very well.  We are finally starting to turn the corner and everyone is working together.

We have created a team to scope the workflow for retail to wholesale deals. They will be finished by the end of the month.

Beth was well behaved and is starting to see the light.

Thanks.

The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.    

If you have any questions please contact Richard Hensch at ext. 35522.

Kevin,

Iris Mack is planning to run an hour-long session on Mon, Nov. 5 (1:00-2:00) providing an "Introduction to Options". If successful, this will be followed up with further Monday sessions going into more detail and complexity.

I am planning to send an email out shortly to Origination encouraging people to attend. Would you like me to include Trading in the email?  Or would you like me to forward the text to you for forwarding to trading?

Dave

Amy, since the Netco employee's would be terminating off of Enron's Payroll they would still have access to converting the current life insurance coverages with Enron over to an individual policy with Metlife as long as they complete the conversion form within 31 days of losing their coverage.  They would then have to pay for this expense out of pocket.

Thanks, Tony

     Hi Tony......
     
     Unfortunately, I dont think so, since the employees are not 
     transferring.  They are considered to be new hires.   As a result, the 
     carrier will request their usual EOI requirements.   They typically 
     require a blood sample and urine sample.  Pending the results of those 
     tests, they may request a physical.
     
     Thanks Tony.
     
     Vince

Vince, we have a question from one of our employees that has an optional life in
surance policy for $1,064,000.00.  The employee currently has a base pay of $185
,004.00.  A clause in the UBS Optional Life Insurance policy states  "evidence o
f insurability is required for coverage of over 3 times your base salary or $700
,000, whichever is less."   What will this employee need to keep their coverage 
at approximately the same level during the transition to UBS?  Would a confirmat
ion statement from Enron for 2002 Open Enrollment elections suffice as 
"evidenceof insurability"?
     
Thanks, Tony Jarrett

Kevin, the fills are good.  The first 2,100 sold at the bid immediately 7
seconds
after being entered.  The bid then moved to 21.75 but you executed at
21.78 on the remaining shares 14 seconds later.  I will email you
time and sales if you would like.  Your trade is attached.

The curves for NY G and NY J offpeak and onpeak were updated by rob benson as a result of the email that was sent out the other day. He is still working on updating the curves. The changes that he made on friday are the first of the changes.
I have asked Jeff Jackson to move the curve change impact (-$1.275million) into the "change deal" section of the P&L. Let me know if that is incorrect.

Terry -

Excellent point.  Obviously, not marking these contracts opens up a can of worms.  I guess neither Anderson nor RAC had an issue with marking these deals initially.  Do the non LD termination provisions definitely negate our ability to mark or is the call discretionary?

The following concern has arisen:  Many of the contracts we have discussed have non-market based LDs that may impact our ability to mark the value.  Tyco is a good example - The contract has site specific termination amounts that are unrelated to our MTM values.  

Many deals appear to have similar problems - I would like your opinions on this.  Specifically do we want to force the issue and only mark in accordance with the contractual language.

Please let me know your thoughts as soon as possible.

Good news.  It sounds like MISO will offer a way to handle losses financially.  Based on their previously filed tariff, it appeared that they would not, but it seems they have reconsidered and recently filed a new Attachment M that details how they will handle losses financially.  I have not yet seen the new Attachment M, so it may be a complex or costly process, but hopefully, it will be fine.

Now, for the Important Question.  MISO does not believe they will be able to process third-party loss schedules (either INT or EXT, in Tag parlance) on Dec 15.  I don't think this is an issue for us (I expect we will typically be either accounting for losses financially or through in-kind schedules (dropping off losses along the path).

If this is not correct, and we do sometimes schedule in losses under separate transactions, please let me know ASAP.  Also let me know how prevalent that practice is.  MISO is trying to figure out how urgent the need is to accommodate that on Dec 15.  While they don't believe they will be able to meet that deadline, they want to know how many resources they should allocate to addressing the problem.

Claudia please arrange a conference call with Tim, John and myself to discuss the method for allocation going forward.

Please note that John is in Calgary and has a 1 hour time difference and Tim is in Seattle with a 2 hour time difference.

Thanks.

Subject:	RE: Enpower cost allocation

I am amenable to many different allocation methods.  I think that John has a good point.  John, the allocation for Canada includes both Toronto and Calgary.  However, there is also an argument that there should be some fixed component and a transaction-based component.  

I think that we need to come up with one methodology that applies to Canada, West, and East.  What methodology do you guys want to use?

Since Alberta Power trades 15 times/day and East and West power trade in excess of 1000 times/day, I believe that a 10% allocation for my desk is inappropriate.  I would be willing to settle for 5% and I believe that this is more that generation/

Kevin,

Currently, we do not have delivery points established for PJM West or Ontario.  Will these be primary points or will they be dependent upon another curve?!  

Also, I just want to ensure that there have been no revisions to what you previously passed on regarding gas trading - only you and the desk heads (you, Dana, Fletch, Rogers, Harry and Doug).  I have set up gas price books already and I am in the process of setting up Gas Daily books (basis and index) for those mentioned.  Any additions/deletions/corrections?!

Thanks for the input.

Rika,
Just a verification on the December 3-4, 2001 conference meeting in New
York.  I am bringing it up again now because the early registration discount
($200) expires this week.
As a reminder, the meeting includes discussions on major nuclear,
generation, and transmission topics by all the key officials (Meserve-NRC,
Wood-FERC, Blake-DOE, Bingaman-Senate, Connaughton-White House,
Bayless-Dynegy, Peterson-NRG Energy, Rogers-Cinergy).
Conference cost - $1395 (We pay time and expenses).
Again, I'm bringing this up only because of the discount expiration coming
up.  After this, I won't bother you with it again.
It seems a valuable opportunity to understand the direction from all
governmental regulators plus major industry viewpoints.
If we do this meeting, the count for all completed and scheduled meetings
through December will be six out of the contract allowable ten.  That gives
a backlog of four meetings; a rate of 1.2 meetings per month; and a
projected contract year completion of 14.5 meetings out of an allowable 24.
Let me know.
Dan

We have had generally good success working with your traders and credit departments working on mutually beneficial 3-way offset transactions. Much appreciated. Even today in the west. But I don't think your pjm or ercot traders agree with the worthiness of that type of activity. Pjm trader will not participate without a spread and ercot trader won't even discuss. We are not panicked here but trying to make credit room for continued trading activity makes sense for us all. I have informed our traders to be o
pen to such opportunities, but not to actively seek them out because of the confidentiality provisions in our contracts. That's why the interaction of your traders is vital. There are two pending opportunities in pjm and ercot. Hope you can help.

I also just got a writeup of a potential new 4-year deal in the west our guys are negotiating with your EES supply desk. I am reviewing now. Of course it only adds to our mutual credit exposure, so making room in other areas makes so much sense.

Kevin,

I was talking with Louise this afternoon and she said that she does not want us to put full master agreements online, but rather that we should proceed with streamlined GTC's in order to ensure that we are able to do as much business as possible without being delayed by negotiation of lengthy contracts.

This does not mean that we cannot ultimately get everyone onto a standardised long-form Master Agreement. EnronOnline is set up so that a negotiated Master Agreement will supercede the GTC.

Dave

I have to clean up clustering and curve mappings from Estate to NETCO.  Last correlation update was Nov. 29th and I'm assuming we may have some issues.  The curves we are rolling into NETCO need to be highly accurate for the last 60 days to ensure variance covariance matrix is appropriate.  Please provide me list of curves we are using in NETCO.  Identify which curves should be primary and which curves can be secondary.  Additionally, please identify if there are any regional constraints that need to be "locked in" between primary and secondary curves.  I will then re-run correlations so we can properly understand diversification benefit across wholesale as it relates to proposed VAR limit structures.

Thanks,
Frank

   Hope you are having a good week. I spoke to Liz yesterday - too bad she
   will
   be out of town this weekend! I think she forwarded my email yesterday  -
   Doug's 30th is Friday and Greg Woulfe and I are going to have a happy
   hour
   at the Front Porch Pub (I said back porch yesterday). Hope you can make
   it!

Spoke to FPL this a.m.  Looks as if they may be in a position to offer firm LD at a JEA interface for Cal'02.  Gerry will complete his analysis by mid-week to see what volume they will have available for an LD product.  Keep you posted.

I've been asked to pull together a "road-map" of the list of due dilligence items that need to be vetted on full requirements deals for Origination's off-site meeting next week.  I have drafted an initial list, attached below, but would appreciate any feedback you can offer on additional items or detail.  Thanks

Louise,

Seung-Taek Oh will be working for me as the head of real-time markets in Ercot. As a two year associate he would have been eligible for promotion to manager. He was also an UBS employee and as such was an associate director. I would like to change his title from undefined to associate director.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Doug

Susan and I will circulate a draft response against Dynegy's position later today.  ComEd plans to file a lengthy answer disputing Dynegy stating that there are no transmission problems due to the use of the firm LD resources and that FERC precedent does not support a capacity payment requirement.

Enron will respond similarly and include an argument that Dynegy is actually trying to create an "icap/capacity" requirement where there is none (Dynegy's pleading states "ComEd's failure to enforce the network designation provisions of its OATT also deprives Dynegy of capacity payments to which it is entitled.)  We will also include statements that the continuation of the network v. PTP transmission tariffs perpetuates these types of issues and the market/tariff design that we advocate should be approved to stop these problems.

Subject:	Dynegy vs. ComEd (EL02-6) -- further info

As I mentioned in my previous e-mail, on October 17 Dynegy filed a complaint against ComEd.  This proceeding may be of particular interest to Enron given EES's plans to offer physical delivery in Illinois in early 2002.  I've outlined Dynegy's principal arguments below.  Dynegy requested fast-track processing, so any intervention and comments we file are due Friday, Oct. 26.  In order to file a timely intervention (and meaningful comments, if we decide to comment), I need to know your thoughts on this as soon as possible.  Elizabeth and Harlan, I'm copying you because I would especially like to know what you think of Dynegy's characterization of the Firm LD product.

Main argument:
Dynegy challenges ComEd's published Business Practice that allows "marketer firm" (Firm LD) contracts to be designated as Network Resources.  Dynegy argues that this practice conflicts with the OATT provisions that 1) Network Resources are generation "owned, purchased or leased by the Network Customer designated to serve Network Load," and 2) a Network Customer "must demonstrate that it owns or has committed to purchase generation pursuant to an executed contract" in order to designate a Network Resource.

Dynegy's theory on why Firm LD should not be a Network Resource:

	- permits designation of network resources that are committed for sale to others, creating reliability problems
	- Firm LD under the EEI contract is not capacity-backed, nor is it a commitment to purchase generation
	- allows transmission customers to get the advantage of generation capacity without actually paying the cost of that capacity
	- since retail providers are allowed to rely on "over-the-counter" firm instead of securing long-term contracts, adequate reserves are not being carried to serve retail load
	
Dynegy claims that ComEd's practice has deprived DMG of payments for capacity and the ability to earn revenues for capacity properly designated as network resources.  It cites specific instances in which ComEd has accepted transmission reservation requests from New Energy and Cilco in which these parties designated Illinois Power as a network resource, when only a Firm LD contracts were in place with IP.

Today at FERC, Enron filed a pleading requesting the complete elimination of "icap" as a product (including any "reserve type" products) based on the fact that the real time spot markets of the RTOS can effectively price this in the cost of energy.  The pleading also includes a proposed interim approach (with a two year sunset date).  This pleading was made in response to FERC's request for comments on "Ensuring Sufficient Capacity Reserves In Today's Energy Markets."

The pleading and affidavit of Larry Ruff, PhD are attached.

Rogers,

Enron Energy Services, Inc. ("EESI") submitted application to become a NEPO=
OL member, to be effective January 1, 2000.  EESI was approved by the NEPOO=
L Participants Membership Subcommittee at its January 24, 2000 meeting.  On=
e requirement of NEPOOL membership is to satisfy the Financial Assurance Po=
licy for NEPOOL Members.  EESI, Enron Energy Marketing Corp, and Enron Powe=
r Marketing, Inc. are all members of NEPOOL and have chosen to satisfy the =
Financial Assurance Policy by issuance of Performance Bond(s), rather than =
corporate guaranty, due to Enron's disagreement with the Form of Corporate =
Guaranty required by NEPOOL.

EESI, via Fireman's Fund Insurance Company, issued a Performance Bond in th=
e amount of $8,000,000 in June 2000; the Performance Bond was reissued in J=
une 2001 in the amount of $8,000,000.  EESI received a letter from ISO New =
England dated October 10, 2001, addressed to Becky Pitre (EESI Settlements)=
 and received by Becky probably October 12, 2001, indicating that EESI's cu=
rrent Performance Bond was insufficient and that EESI needed to increase th=
e amount to $11,703,018.75 to cover EESI's current activity level.  Becky d=
elivered the October 10th letter  to my attention whereby I took the letter=
 to EESI Legal Department (Karen Cordova) and informed Karen that EESI need=
ed to increase the Performance Bond to $20,000,000.  Karen requested Credit=
 Department (Nichole Gunter) initiate an increase in the Performance Bond t=
o the $20,000,000 level; to the best of my knowledge the initial conversati=
on with Credit Department was October 12, 2001.  In telephone conversations=
 with ISO-NE, Enron's Credit Department personnel were informed by ISO-NE t=
hat in order to avoid Financial Assurance Default the matter needed to be r=
esolved within ten (10) days of the date of the October 10, 2001 letter (Oc=
tober 19, 2001), however the letter did not indicate such.=20

I was notified by Credit Department on October 16, 2001 that the bond compa=
ny Enron utilizes for performance bond(s) would not process our Performance=
 Bond request for increase until Enron paid the bond company for outstandin=
g invoices for "other" performance bonds (bond  renewals), approximately $1=
50,000.  The "other" performance bond invioces had been bounced around EESI=
, since June 2001, to various individuals (i.e. Greg Sharp, Mark Mueller, J=
eff Golden, Scott Mills) and had still remained unpaid.  Payments for the "=
other" performance bonds were made and the bond company processed our reque=
st for increase in the EESI NEPOOL Performance Bond to $20,000,000, which w=
as issued by the bond company on October 23, 2001, executed by EESI on Octo=
ber 23, 2001 and forwarded via FAX and Overnight Mail to ISO-NE on October =
23, 2001.  EESI was unable to comply with the October 19, 2001 deadline to =
resolve the Financial Assurance Default due to complications with the bond =
company as mentioned above.  Credit Department personnel informed ISO-NE pe=
rsonnel that EESI would not meet the October 19, 2001 deadline, but was wor=
king diligently to resolve the matter; Credit Department personnel sent via=
 FAX, a copy of the request to the bond company for revisions to the Perfor=
mance Bond to ISO-NE personnel on October 19, 2001. =20

I notified Dan Allegretti, (Enron Government Affairs & Chariman, NEPOOL Par=
ticipants Committee) of the entire situation prior to October 19, 2001.  Da=
n indicated that he did not think there would be any problems, but to get t=
he matter resolved as quickly as possible. Dan advised me that the implicat=
ions of the Financial Assurance Default would result in communications to t=
he Membership Subcommittee and that when the next letter was published, the=
 following month, EESI would no longer be listed as being in default.  On O=
ctober 19, 2001 another letter was sent to Becky Pitre (EESI Settlements) f=
rom Edward McKenna, Vice President & Chief Financial Officer informing EESI=
 that "Enron Energy Services, Inc. has not maintained the required level of=
 financial assurance for 10 days or more, and has had a total combination o=
f 3 financial assurance and/or payment defaults in the last 12 months, whic=
h qualifies them as having 2 (two) Level 1 defaults.  The ISO has been in c=
ontact with Enron Energy Services, Inc. through multiple telephone communic=
ations, and to date the financial assuvance default has not been cured.  Th=
erefore, per the established procedure, we are forwarding this information =
to the NEPOOL Membership Subcommittee for action by them."  According to Da=
n Allegretti the Memberhsip Subcommittee reports to him, as Chariman of the=
 Members Subcommittee, and he would discuss the issue with them.  The previ=
ous two Financial Assurance Defaults mentioned the October 19, 2001 letter =
occurred (i) December 2000, when payment was received 1-2 days late and was=
 automatically resolved when payment was received and (ii) September 2001, =
when Financial Assurance Default occurred and was resolved through market a=
ctivity.  To the best of my knowledge, EESI was unaware of either the Decem=
ber 2000 Payment Default or the September 2001 Financial Assurance Default,=
 and no information was received by EESI from ISO-NE relative to either inc=
idence.

According to (i) Protocal for the Initation of Membership Termination Proce=
edings and (ii) conversations with Dan Allegretti, the issue should be reso=
lved with the receipt on October 24, 2001 of the Performance Bond by ISO-NE=
.  I have also advised the ISO-NE, in the future, to send communications to=
 EESI's Credit Department and not EESI's Settlements.  Also, Dan Allegretti=
 is investigating the facts leading the the October 19, 2001 letter with re=
presentatives from ISO-NE.

I left message for Molly Harris as you requested. I was able to speak to De=
nise Furey and Nichole Gunter, who both indicated that they would speak wit=
h Molly as they all work together. =20

Also,  I am concerned that Narsimha may have someone from the outside trying to recruit him.  I am pressing him on the contract and he is telling me everything's ok - lawyer reviewing, etc.  I am going to give him another day or so and then just call him on it.  I think there is better money out there, even in this market and do not want to lose him.  Honestly, Joe, Juan and Narsimha are the only commodity guys I can count on to do what is right - amazing.  You may want to ask Narsimha about the contract if you see him.

I agree with this approach and I'm fine with this allocation.   My objective is to get everything as accurate as possible so the proper price signal is being sent to retail and wholesale origination.   I caught the scalar issue when we were looking at 4 hour tolls vs. 8 hour tolls vs. 16 hour and I could tell there was a disconnect.

I think it is appropriate to instruct Risk to put the charges associated with the PJM scalar in the Change Deal Bucket as this was out of the Retail Commodity Group's control.  I am trying to hold these guys accountable for positions, p/l and such and I think this is the only way to fairly account for results that they could affect vs. someone else's error/mismark.

I have sent the message again to make curves as accurate as possible through 2015.    We are doing are best.   The Entergy situation was simply a back office mistake.   The NY off-peak is a work in progress and will get better every day.   The legs never trade, only the cals, therefore, we have to use common sense for month values.

Thanks for the info.   In most cases, Narsima is exactly right.

Subject:	Curve Changes

Here are the significant (non market related) curve changes that have effected our P&L in the last week...and also a working issue related with curve management.

PJM East Hub: 
   Summary : Hourly Scalars for East hub were changed, resulting in a ($2.3 million) loss.
   Reasons : Rob Benson had changed the West hub scalars a few months ago and those scalar changes never got transfered over to the East Hub curves. When the curve management function was moved from excel into the Enpower Curve Management system all the curves derived as a basis off West Hub curves started using the West Hub Scalars. 

Entergy Back End:
  Summary : Yesterday, Entergy 05 and beyond curves moved down in the range of $0.50/MWh to $1.65/MWh resulting in a loss of approximately $2.3million (held back because Mike Carson is fixing the curves today)

NY Curves:
  Summary : The onpeak and offpeak curves for NY Zones A, G and J require a thorough clean up especially with regards to the issues that are stated below. The P&L is still to be determined because curves have not been changed.


On Peak
1.  J-G Spread is marked over G-A Spread starting in Year 2009.
2.  J-A Spread blows up year on year, starting in Year 2005.

Offpeak
1.  Zone-G is marked above Zone-J half of the time;  occuring mostly in Q1, Q4 and Aug.
2.  Zone-A is marked above Zone-J every July in 2003-2006.  With the exception of 2002, for the month of July, Zone-A is marginally marked below Zone-J.
3.  Zone-A is marked above Zone-G for every July from 2003 to 2018 and Dec 2003.
4.  Zone-A, for every year, MarApr is over MayJun by a significant amount.

As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

Indian Point 2 is expected to go into a midcycle outage starting this Friday (10/26/01). We anticipate they will be down for about two weeks. We will keep you updated as they are getting a lot of heat from the NRC and have a lot of pressure of the former Con Edison employees to perform, that are now working for Entergy.

Guys -

FYI - We are on hold with making Berney responsible for all Structuring/Deal Management activities for now.  John is uncomfortable with the dual reporting structure expected by Janet/Dave.  Berney and I sat down with him to discuss and I can surely appreciate his concerns.

In the interim, I think EES will make Deb Merrill head of the traditional Deal Management group.  I am ok with this.  In fact, Berney and I agree that we are still going to send a couple of our resources their way (and maybe get one in return) to help them get up the learning curve.

Dear Kevin,

What a game on Saturday!  While we all expected Miami to pull out a victory,
who would have expected 59-0!  If you haven't already seen the newest BCS
rankings, the Hurricanes are still #2 but now farther ahead of Oklahoma.  As
long as we beat Washington and Virginia Tech, we should be Rose Bowl bound!
Our victory over Syracuse wrapped up at least a share of the Big East
Championship, so at the very least we are guaranteed an Orange Bowl birth.

Concerning bowl game tickets:
A few decisions have been made concerning bowl game tickets.  As a 2001
member of the Hurricane Club, you are at the front of the line for bowl
tickets!  The Bowl Ticket Order Deadline is slated for December 12 - all
orders MUST be in by this point.  The ticket office will be prepared to
accept bowl ticket order beginning Monday, December 3.  Just call
1-800-GO-CANES to order tickets.  We expect the phone lines to be very busy,
so please be patient - you will be taken care of!

Your donor level will determine the amount of priority tickets you will be
able to purchase: Cane Club ($150) donors will be able to buy 2 priority
tickets, Orange ($250) and Green ($500) Club members will be able to buy 4
priority tickets, Coaches ($1000), Commissioner's ($1,500), and Director's
($2,500) Club members will be able to buy 6 priority tickets, Silver Canes
($5,000) will be able to buy 8 priority tickets, and Living Scholars and
Golden Canes ($10,000+) will be able to buy 10 priority tickets.  Priority
tickets will be the first of our allotment assigned, and will thus be in the
best locations.

If you'd like to purchase additional tickets, you have the option to buy up
to 20 tickets.  The additional tickets, though, will not be priority level.
For instance, if a member of the Cane Club wanted to buy 10 tickets, the
first 2 would be priority tickets and be in the best seat location possible.
The additional 8 will be allocated to the ticket buyer after all other
Hurricane Club members have gotten their priority tickets.  All 10 seats
would then not be in the same location, unless you specifically request to
move your priority seats to be next to your additional seats.

More information will follow shortly, as soon as we have it.  If you have
any questions concerning bowl tickets or travel, please call Zach Goines at
305-284-6699 or just respond to this email.

Hope to see you all at the Washington game this weekend.  On behalf of the
entire Hurricane Club staff, have great Thanksgiving holiday!


Steve Stroud
Hurricane Club

I plan on meeting with Rika and Chris regularly, particularly with Rika on new gen.  What time is good for you tomorrow and where are you located?

Obviously, coordination with gas and power fundies (rika imai and chris gaskill) is important for almost all projects unless confidentiality is necessary given the nature of the project scope.   My view is No. 1 is part of Rika's core day to day world.   No. 2 and No. 4 are more special project in nature and this is a gap you could help fill.

I will be out Wednesday through Friday so we should sit down tomorrow.

Hey Kevin- thanks for the intro at the Fundy meeting on Friday- would like to sit down with you to talk priorities this week if you have time.  

For Power East, I know you want maximum bang for your buck across a limited number of projects, so I'm thinking:

1. New Gen
2. Hydro Quebec reservoir levels
3. Oil "shock"/terrorism
4. Coal- utility stockpiles

Thanks,

Robert Johnston

Hi Louise,

I asked each of my directs to consider 3 levels of cuts.  I told them this is strictly an exercise at this point and that we haven't been given targets (trying to keep the emotion down).  The three levels were:

 A. Remove capability for new projects but retain a reasonable ability to continue growth of our current application suite.

 B. Reduce to minimal development capability.  Retain ability for operations and minor enhancements to applications.

 C. Cut to life-support level.  Retain ability to operate the applications and fix bugs.

The cut levels are as follows:
A. Reduce by 11 (to 129)
B. Reduce by 21 (to 108)
C. Reduce by 17 (to 91)

Jeff Johnson placed himself in the A cuts, though I removed him from that cut thinking I can talk him out of it.  He is in the B cut.

Steve Stock placed himself in the B cuts.

Michael Guadarrama placed himself in the B cuts.  He said he would probably leave if the A cuts were made but would wait until we got through the transition.

Hopefully we can hold this together.

I'll try to call you to discuss.

Thanks.

Participants:

-Prof. Charles Cicchetti, Univ. of Southern California
-Comm. Robert Nelson, Mich. Pub. Serv. Comm.
-Marji Phillips, Exelon Power Team (attorney)
-Sonny Popowski, PA Office of Consumer Advocate
-Craig Roach, Boston Pacific
-Anjali Sheffrin, Dir. Market Analysis, Cal ISO

Summary:  Market Monitor (MM) should be independent.  Too much MM transparency is a problem -- MM function should be done privately to FERC.  MM should be an early warning signal.

Specifics:
The morning started on a rather humorous note with Marji Phillips introducing herself as "the guilty party so to speak in front of you" (referencing the PECO/Exelon purported violation of standards of conduct).  She stated that it is not the role of the MM to interfere to make sure that power prices are the lowest in each hour -- the MM should monitor the RTO and the markets and be part of a creative solution (without imposing its own MM penalties/mitigation).  She used the Midwest price spikes of 98 as an example, and stated that a poor MM would probably have worsened the market solution that was reached without intervention.

Most of the group agreed with Prof. Cicchetti that the MM should not be the policeman, judge and jury.  He also stressed the importance of the MM being aware of the interaction of markets (i.e., California:  gas, electricity, NOx).  As Craig Roach said, the MM should look at more than market power -- it should also look at market conditions and market rules and be a vehicle for innovation.  Moreover, other issues are equally important, such as environmental issues and the ability of new entrants to both enter the market and raise capital.  Moreover, most markets involve traders (which a market needs).  The MM should not "go to the farmer for costs."  Markets don't act simply on costs and MMs should not be attempting to run their own market simulation.  Spot markets are critical.  

Many thought that there should be some standardization of the information provided to the MM.  Most agreed that the information should be provided on a confidential basis, especially before any specific problem has been found.

Sonny Popowski stated that the RTO must be truly independent or the MM simply catalogs the market failures.

Comm. Nelson said that the MM should have unfettered access to all costs and should have the ability for "cease and desist" orders.  Also, stated that ITCs/transcos should be monitored to the extent that they favor transmission solutions over DG and generation.  On the very positive side, he said RTO policy should proceed.

Ms. Sheffrin said that it would be simple to implement a rolling 12 month cost plus 10% competitive benchmark, and prices above this should be mitigated.  She said this would allow bidders to "self police" so as to not hit the benchmark.  Most of the others disagreed with her, pointing out that a simplistic test such as this does not account for market conditions.  It was pointed out that there were too many different MMs in Cal with no one acting.  Someone also commented that one reason participants did not want to turn data over to Cal ISO was because it was a contesting party.

All thought that DSM should be included in the market in order to be considered in mitigation.

Comm. Breathitt asked Ms. Sheffrin why the price cap wouldn't work in Cal.  She responded that the problems in Cal were with the need for LT contracts and other issues (she also said that it is not a zonal/lmp issue).  Importantly, she said that consumers are now conserving 3000-5000 MWs annually since getting the appropriate price signals.  Mr. Popowski said that he likes the price caps in PJM.  Margie countered and said that "icap" in PJM is the problem.  

FERC staff asked if the MM should monitor bilaterals.  Marji said absolutely not (between consenting companies and should not be unraveled).  Both agreed that the MM may at times need access to these in order to understand what was happening in the spot market.

Gentlemen -

FYI, We have approximately 3.6 MM Mwh of net sales to New Power Company.  I am not sure what the p/l is but I think it is sizeable as most of these sales were made several months back.  I am not sure if this is on anyone's radar screen but is now on mine.  I will have the group look into p/l.

PLEASE READ THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ENRON STOCK FUND IN THE ENRON CORP. SAVINGS AND ESOP PLANS

On Friday, January 11, trading of Enron stock was suspended on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).  All Savings and ESOP Plan transactions, including 401(k) payroll contributions,  involving this fund were placed in a pending status until trading resumed.

As announced by Enron's Office of the Chair on Wednesday, January 16, Enron stock would now be traded Over The Counter (OTC).  Upon receiving this information, work began immediately to develop a process that allows for OTC trades in the plans.

On Thursday, January 17, Enron initiated a process to facilitate OTC trades of Enron stock inside the 401(k) and ESOP and all pending transactions were processed using Thursday's closing price.  

Now that trading has resumed, we urge you to review your investment elections to ensure that they are consistent with your investment goals.  

As things change, we will continue to update you.

K evin:

A friend of a friend is selling the product described below.  It looks like something in which your guys would be interested, but I wasn't sure to whom I should send it.  Michelle Parks suggested that I send it directly to you.  Please let me know if you want more information about the product or Saaty.

Jim,
 
Thanks for the help.
 
As I mentioned, AWS (originally Automated Weather Source) has more than 5500 weather stations deployed around the US.  This is the most dense real-time weather network in the country.  We gather data from all of these stations through the Internet, and can feed it out as live data streams.  We also have an 8-year historical repository of the data that was gathered as the network was built out.  As an example, in the Houstonarea we have 82 weather stations.  The National Weather Service has 6.  Each of our stations measures windspeed and direction, temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, light, and barometric pressure and 400 of our stations have digital cameras.  We can analyze 27 different weather parameters in real-time.  Check out www.aws.com
 
Our current products are consumer-oriented.  We sell our services to TV broadcast stations, i.e. KPRC in Houston.  We also wrap the data in advertising and offer it as the WeatherBug.  AWS' WeatherBugproduct is now the largest weather destination in the USas measured by Media Metrics.
 
We are now exploring how our data might be applied to the Energy industry.  Examples include offering real-time weather data to energy trading operations which shows in  real-time the deviation from forecast.  This can be at the national, regional, metropolitan or local levels.  You could watch a weather front move into a metropolitan area and see how it is shaping up as compared to the forecast to aid in energy purchases, bids, etc.  The data could be used with basis risk in derivative contracts.  It could also be used to forecast what a specific NWS station was going to forecast in the near future.  You may have more uses.  Most of our sites are located in and around metropolitan areas which is a positive for energy demand.  
 
We would like to talk with the folks running Enron's trading area to discuss if this data could be used and what products might be built for the industry.
 
Thanks and regards,
 
John Saaty

Trade press, recruiting firms and others recently have made numerous calls to Enron employees seeking information about the company, its employees and other matters.  In some cases, these callers have used false identities, as in, "I'm from the SEC and I need you to provide me with?"

If you receive a call from someone identifying themselves as part of a government organization, please refer the caller to the legal department.  Please refer calls from the trade press and other media inquiries to the Public Relations group.  And otherwise, please treat Enron information as confidential.

Thank you.

I think I can get Jeff King done with a simple title change from Associate Director to Director with no salary change.   His current salary is already Director level type comp.   I potentially may need another 25k, but the title is a "feel good" issue that is important to Jeff.   Please talk to Doug directly on the justification.

Importance:	High

Repairs to the internal coating of the demineralized water storage tank have
been completed.  Therefore, I would like to request an outage for the Sand
Hill Energy Center on Friday, October 26 from 7 AM to 4 PM.  The purpose is
to remove temporary piping and restore normal connections to the
Demineralized Water Storage Tank.  This will restore the Demin. water system
to its normal configuration.  We will not be able to operate the units while
this work is in progress.  Your immediate approval of this outage is
requested.


Thanks,

FYI,
Based on consultation among MAIN staff and with the MAIN PC chair as well as the chair of the newly form MAIN Security Working Group, we will take or have taken the following actions in the interest of bulk power system physical security:
1) All data on the MAIN home page formerly considered "public" but now deemed to have the potential to be used in sabotage acts against the interconnected electric systems is no longer available for immediate download.
2) Those entities who have a valid, regular use of such data will be given password access. Current MAIN homepage passwords will work and anyone who has OASIS access via TradeAgent will automatically have access via the the links provided on the OASIS after log-in.
3) Anyone who has a valid but infrequent use of such data will be screened before such data is supplied. This will be done through validation of phone and/or street address as well as company affiliation as necessary. In short, we will know the person who has asked for data.
4) Instruction and/or forms will be available on the web to facilitate item 3 above.
5) A modest charge to accomplish item 3 may also be required.
At a minimum the following formerly public data is included in this protected group:
- All MAIN electric system maps
- Detailed capacity reports such as the 411/860
- Parts of the FERC 715 submittal
- Detailed roster information
- outage listings
- seven days or older ATC cases
- Transmission Assessment reports (TASG, FSSG)
- All other power flow cases (MDB, MMWG, etc.)
I recognize that reports such as the 411/860 and FERC 715 also reside publicly on the FERC/DOE sites. Efforts will be made to have such data removed from the government sites as well and, I understand that FERC yesterday has already taken such action.
Please feel free to contact me if you have any question.

Please be advised, we received a Letter of Credit covering physical power transactions between Edison Mission Marketing & Trading Inc. and EPMI.  This LC expires January 31, 2002.  Consequently, we have opened them up on EOL for East and West Physical Power trading for 2 (two) months only.  Once we get into November we will reduce their allowed trading term to 1 (one) month only.  This will effectively enable them trade out through the end of December 2001.  No trades should be done with this counterparty that extend beyond December 31, 2001 so that we can manage exposure within the term of the Letter of Credit provided.  Please call credit with any questions or comments.


Thanks
Wendy

PS- Tracy please forward onto all west traders.

Thanks

Performance Management for Electric Distribution Companies
An  Executive Forum
October 25-26, 2001, Atlanta,  GA

 

OVERVIEW

 
Deregulation is introducing competition into the  electric utility industry in an ever-increasing rate, and it is requiring  companies to consider dramatic changes in their business processes, in the  operation of their businesses, and in managing their assets.  Issues such as customer satisfaction,  performance based rates, operational reliability targets, operational  efficiencies, risk management, and rate reductions are among the new business  drivers.
 
With the advent of new choices open to the smallest  retail customers as well as the largest industrials, distribution companies are  re-engineering their businesses and re-establishing their corporate priorities  in response to these new challenges.   This new business environment has brought performance management to the  forefront for the electric distribution companies, and they are being driven by  regulators, customers, and financial rating agencies to improve all aspects of  their performance.   
 
Through this conference, we have gathered leading  executives from distribution companies, wires companies, generation companies,  energy marketers, regulators, and market participants to openly discuss the  issues, their experiences, and their corporate strategies.  Our objective for this executive forum  is to provide you with new insights into how electric distribution companies are  addressing these issues and concerns, and to help you formulate your own  corporate approach to this challenging and complex new world.  
 
The website link for the conference is provided  below. Please click the link to see  the program agenda, general information including location and hotel, and online  registration. You can also register by calling us at 303-770-8800.

Ancillary Services Conference
October 31-November 2, 2001, Denver,  CO

 

OVERVIEW

 
The Ancillary Services  conference will explore the rapidly changing and fascinating engineering,  economic, market, and policy issues related to bulk-power ancillary services.  These issues are difficult to resolve because these services are essential for  both reliability and commerce, and it is often difficult to disentangle the  two.
 
Topics to be covered at this  event include centralized vs. supplier unit commitment, integration of  ancillary-service markets with energy and congestion markets, relationships  among forward and real-time markets, measuring the performance of  ancillary-service delivery, operating costs to provide these services,  retail-load provision of some ancillary services, comparisons among the existing  ISOs and future RTOs in their treatment of ancillary services, and the  feasibility of letting price influence the amount of reserves  acquired.
 
Electric Utility Consultants,  Inc., a long-time provider of timely conferences and workshops for the electric  industry, has assembled a covey of top experts to explore all aspects of the  emerging field in a conference devoted exclusively to Ancillary Services.

Performance-Based  Ratemaking Conference
December  5-7, 2001, Denver, CO
 
OVERVIEW
 

Performance  Based Ratemaking (PBR) is emerging as a key element of the restructuring of the  electric utility industry. For PBR to be effective it must be designed carefully  and uniquely for each utility so as to align the interests of the utility, the  shareholders and the customers and also to make sure that PBR is successful in  achieving efficiency and service quality.
 
EUCI  has put together a covey of expert speakers to review and address the latest PBR  developments and applications.  Join  us in Denver and get the latest state-of-the-art information and insights you  will need to develop an effective PBR strategy for your  company.

Electric  Power Market Performance Conference
December  12-14, 2001, Denver, CO
 
OVERVIEW
 

Each  year there is additional opportunity to draw lessons regarding electricity  market structure and design from actual market performance. These lessons are  leading to a convergence in market design, at least in the Eastern  Interconnection and ERCOT. One focus of this conference will be on the lessons  to be drawn from the experience of the new ERCOT markets, the continuing market  design problems in California, and the difficulties in developing and  implementing a market based congestion management system in the  midwest.
 
A  second focus of this conference will be on the existing markets in PJM and New  York, which have now moved beyond managing their internal markets and are being  pushed by market participants and regulatory agencies to better address  inter-RTO coordination and develop market based incentive systems for  transmission expansion.
 
Finally, the conference will highlight one of the  important, but little noticed successes of the Eastern ISOs, which is the  explosive growth in the PJM and New York financial rights auctions.
 
The website link for this conference and associated  workshop is provided below:
Electric  Power Market Performance Conference, Dec. 13-14, 2001, Denver,  COhttp://www.euci.com/confoverview.asp?ConfID=12

Here are the office locations that Louise has assigned: 

Calger  06105 
Presto  06103 
Shively 06102 

T Jae, it was decided today that legal will move over here this weekend.  Can you please arrange for Kevin's things to be boxed up so legal can move in downstairs over the weekend.

Ina, if there are any of John Arnold's personal effects left on 5 can you please have them boxed up? 

If we can hold off until next week to set the new offices up I'm sure that Darren and David would be very grateful! 

Thanks for your help! 
Tammy

Entergy has joined the SE Trans RTO (Southern, etal).  I will review the FERC filing; however, an Entergy rep called me today to ask for Enron's support stating that the new RTO proposal includes:
 
-- Independent Market Operator (he said such as PJM)
-- No Day Ahead Balanced Schedules
-- LMP
-- One OASIS and one Tariff (no separate tariff for Entergy's ITC)
-- One Security Coordinator
-- Initial license plate rate within Entergy area
-- local planning in Entergy footprint
 
He also said that they are trying to have the GridSouth group agree to use the same Independent Market Operator so there would be one market structure for the Southeast.
 
Hopefully, the filing reflects this -- more later.  Christi

Subject:	Trans-Elect RTO participation

There are materials of the Trans-elect website that details the CMS purchase,  http://www.trans-elect.com/. Under a Q&A section is the following:

Q: Will Trans-Elect put the METC transmission system in an RTO?
A: Yes, in accordance with FERC requirements that all systems must join an RTO.
Q: Which RTO will Trans-Elect choose?
A: Either the Midwest Independent System Organization (MISO) or the Alliance will be selected. Trans-Elect has 40 days from the announcement to make a selection. Trans-Elect is assessing the two organizations to make a determination as to which one will best serve the interests of Michigan consumers.

Looks like there was substance to the Consumers energy rumour.  Consumers are currently part of Alliance, the fact that the new owner wanted to make a decision on RTOs suggests that they are moving to MISO (they would have looked at the ARTO structure as part of due diligence).  Will let you know when the decision is made.

regards
Mike

I am amenable to many different allocation methods.  I think that John has a good point.  John, the allocation for Canada includes both Toronto and Calgary.  However, there is also an argument that there should be some fixed component and a transaction-based component.  

I think that we need to come up with one methodology that applies to Canada, West, and East.  What methodology do you guys want to use?

Rogers, 

Here's a summary of today's meeting and other discussions I've had with the parties involved.

Does everyone have the information they need?
Services Management - TBD. Scott Massey is compiling a list of all non mass market ERCOT deals. 
Site Profile Desk - No. Need to know which accounts have IDR meters. Need consumption data in a standard format from Services Management
Load Profile Desk - No. Need historical usage information on all deals.
Power Desk - Yes, except for deal lists.
Scheduling - Yes
Settlements - No. Need clarification from ERCOT/EPMI regarding which meters have switched and when they switched. 
CSC - No. Need detailed information regarding which costs to pass through to customers. Need information regarding how to bill non-standard deals.
IT - No. Need accurate deal information from RPS. 
All - Need the deal list from Services Management
Who is communicating with the ISO?
EPMI Scheduling
EPMI Settlements/Volume Management
CSC 
Do we have all the data we need for the customers?
TBD. Once we get the deal list from Services Management, we should be able to make a determination.
What are the deadlines for notification? Dates are subject to change due to decisions pending at ERCOT
Deal Capture - Need deal sheets by December 5th. 
CSC - Need deal sheets by December 15th. 

We have a plan in place to gather the necessary information and are confident that all of our customers will be switched on 1/1/2002 (or the next meter read date).

Please let me know if you would like more detail.

I assume we are doing everything necessary to insure that we will have all of our customers switched for 1/1/02.  If anyone knows any different then please speak up now.  In all seriousness, we cannot accept mistakes or slip-ups on this one.  The pilot transfers appear to have been much more difficult than I would have anticipated.

Does everyone have the info they need?
Who is communicating with the ISO?
DO we have all of the data we need for the customers?
What are the deadlines for notification?
Does this group feel we need to get together to discuss any open issues?

Please let me know if anyone feels uncomfortable with our getting there.

Thanks,
Rogers

Subject:	ERCOT physical delivery update

Changes from last week in red.

Retail load
About 18 MW peak, 17 MW off-peak. 
October 4th - First account was switched. 
By November 6th - Remaining accounts will be switched
Issue - Some Lockheed Martin accounts that aren't in the batch.
Issue - Trying to get positions correctly reflected in positions report - Jeff Jackson
Issue - Data we are getting from RPS is incorrect.

Interface with EWS Wholesale
To date - Met with EPMI and discussed management (when will position be transferred? how? at what price?) of retail position. Tom May to discuss with Rogers. 
Issue - How will we pass through intrazonal congestion costs? This isn't an issue for the pilot, but will be an issue on 1/1/2002.

Intramonth book development
November 1 - Expect to have volume management/reporting capability. 
November 1 - Expect to have MTM calculations
???- Expect to have all other reporting capabilities functioning. Will meet with Richard Bird this week to develop a new timeline.

Working with CSC to develop a method to obtain actual customer usage on a timely basis.

Load forecasting
Issue - There is a significant difference (at least in % terms) between the Packaged Ice position per the positions report and Frazier's forecast. Appears the majority of this difference is due to some Packaged Ice accounts being booked more than once.
Issue - Forecasting by zone (vs. at the account level) may lead to inaccuracies in P&L reporting.

?	Customer switching process
Jeff Merola to determine roles and responsibilities

?	Site profile
Site profile desk has processed the pilot program deals. 
Met with the desk to discuss the other (non-pilot program) deals that we expect to switch 1/1/202.

Yesterday I was approached by Steve Thome who had been asked by Brandon Wax (who was asked by Don Miller?) looking for a cash forecast for deals that flowed in December.  While I'd like to be helpful, I have never done a cash forecast before.  We don't have the tools set up in Portland to do this sort of thing.  The data to do this has historically resided in Enpower.  A week ago the West Power desk met and agreed that we were able to and prepared to update Enpower in "Schedule" for all of the deals that flowed in December.  Diana Scholtes sent an e-mail (below) to Leslie Reeves on January 3rd indicating that we were prepared to update Enpower.  We heard from John Postlethwaite that Leslie didn't want us to update Schedule -- instead they could work off of our trade sheets.

I don't care which way we move forward.  It just seems that we aren't all on the same page.  We just want to do whatever needs to be done to get the right information to the right people.  Exerience tells me that we are better off doing it "right" the first time.  I am hoping that between Don, Leslie, and Stacey we can get some clear direction on what you would like us to do.  As of now, there is little I can do to assist Brandon with his request for a cash flow projection.

Regards,
Tim

It has come to my attention that there seems to be miscommunication between various groups and people about how Dec and Jan scheduling for non-terminated deals should be handled. There are conflicting reports that Houston, through the estate, will handle updating scheduling in Enpower or that the scheduling group should be updating Enpower accordingly.

What I am hoping for is that by whatever communications means necessary we can come to a final action plan on how to clean this and get Enpower up to date as quickly and as accurately as possible.

Thanks,

John

Leslie,

I'm trying to get a jump on making sure we have everything done properly in Enpower for the month of January.  My question is whether we, the West desk, should enter any changes in Enpower due to OUR non-delivery and/or incremental deals?  We have everything recorded on our Trade sheets, but if it would make it easier for you to settle or relay to the Estate by us making the changes in Deal Scheduling, we can do so.  

I also understand, after talking to John, you will be using our Trade sheets for such changes for the month of December.  I'm not sure who you would like us to assist in translating our sheets, but if you can call me, we can set up a conference call and I'll coordinate from each desk to attend.  

If there is anything else that you need us to do to help your group please let me know.

Dear Global Oil Retainer Client,

PIRA is expanding its weekly assessment of global refining profitability to
include Mediterranean and Singapore refining regions - key additions to
those already provided on a weekly basis, which include "cracking" for WTI
crude in the U.S. Gulf, Chicago and Group 3; "cracking" for LLS crude in the
U.S. Gulf; and "cracking" and "hydroskimming" for Brent crude in N.W.
Europe. These margins are based on PIRA's proprietary crude yields, and
represent industry or "swing" refinery margins. The added margins are
"cracking" and "hydroskimming" for Urals crude in the Mediterranean, and
"cracking" and "topping" margins for Dubai crude in Singapore.

The $/Bbl margins represent incremental cash operating margins, which equal
gross product worth, less delivered crude cost, less variable refining
operating costs. Margins are calculated and plotted for each day that prices
are available.

PIRA will continue to publish margin charts every Monday afternoon at
www.pira.com.

Look for further announcements in the future as PIRA continues to enhance
worldwide refining information for its Retainer Clients, including margin
analysis in other key refining regions.

PIRA Energy Group

In order for UBS Warburg to timely process your paycheck, I am requesting that all employee's accepting offers return any outstanding forms to my new desk location at  05852 on the 5th floor of ECS (Look for the Hamburg Flag) by noon this Friday  2/01/02.  This will prevent any benefit deductions from having to be "Double Deducted" on future checks.  Please attach a deposit slip or voided check stub to your direct deposit form.  Attached below are the forms needed for payroll/benefits, in case you did not turn these in at Orientation.  Lastly, please verify that your EHRonline home address is showing your current home address because all live checks will be mailed to your home residence. 

    

Thanks, Tony Jarrett

This is to inform you that on January 25, 2002 the Honorable Arthur Gonzalez, United States Bankruptcy Judge for the Southern District of New York, entered an order as follows:

It is hereby Ordered that until further Order of this Court, Enron Corp., its affiliated debtors-in-possession in these jointly administered chapter 11 proceedings (collectively "Enron"), and Enron's employees shall preserve, and refrain from destroying or disposing of, any of Enron's records, either in electronic or paper form.

Obviously, any violation of this order will carry serious consequences.  We know that we can depend on you to comply with it fully.

Thank you.

To avoid losing info in the shuffle of the move, we are waiting until Monday morning to hand out the folders.  However, I'm attaching p&l, positions, prices and VAR for you to view until we get your individual information to you on Monday.  

Thanks and have a great weekend.

Rika,
On Dec 3-4, 2001, there will be a conference on energy policy and regulation. 
Key speakers include:
Richard Meserve - Chairman of Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)
Pat Wood - Chairman of Federal Energy Regulatoy Commission (FERC)
Francis Blake - Dep. Secretary of Energy (US DOE)
James Connaughton - Chairman, White House Council on Environmental Quality
Jeff Bingaman - Senator and Chairman of Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources
Carl Wood - Commissioner, California public Utilities Commission
and others

Topics include:
-New nuclear power generation in the U.S.
-Breaking the Nuclear waste policy logjam
-FERC policy for restructuring wholesale markets
-FERC policy for creating four mega-RTOs plus ERCOT
-National energy and environmental policy (Bush administration perspective & Congressional perspective)
-The future of state restructuring
and others

As you can see this is a major conference with a lot of key issues and a lot of key individuals delivering their views and leading discussions.  I think it would be beneficial for us to attend.  Again, since this is a conference rather than an NRC meeting, I would suggest the trade-off of us paying for flight, hotel, and all other expenses and time if you would pick up the conference cost ($1395.00 discounted "early bird" rate).
Let me know.
Thanks,
Dan

Kevin,

I'm attaching the template of the 2 week cash flow forecast.  I broke it down into peak and off-peak sections for next week and the following week - by counterparty, by region, and by sell/buy.  I have two separate sheets in the file according to the way it is sorted - one is by counterparty and the other is by region.  Keep in mind that the ancillaries have a fixed price of zero because the load deals were done based upon a bundled 24-hour energy price which included the cost of the ancillaries.  The column titled "Fill Price" is for you to fill in.  Also, I've explained the template to Don Miller so all you will need to do is forward it on to him once you enter your prices and he will understand it all.

I'll call you in the morning to make sure all is well!

-Casey

Do NOT include any "physical asset" which an outside party has the contractual obligation for replacement.  Please be sure to include any off-balance sheet items.  Please answer with a "yes" or "no" and resend the attached schedule as your response.

Kevin,
=20
I know things are still pretty dynamic in the new organization, but I am ho=
ping I can speak with you about the possibility of any remaining power trad=
ing positions you might be looking to fill.  I know that several people wer=
e not retained in the NE, and my past Enron experience makes me a good cand=
idate to fill a trading role there.  I don't know if you remember me from b=
efore, but I spent time in Structuring as the lead Structurer for the UI de=
al, then Jim brought me over to work with Bill Reed and John Suarez on trad=
ing and marketing around the UI position in NEPOOL as well as PJM and NY (w=
hich had not really started trading at the time).  You and I never really h=
ad a chance to interact as we had no peaker assets in the regions in which =
I worked.  After EPMI I went to EBS, and most recently Jim asked me to go t=
o Singapore as the head of the trading and risk management function for our=
 Asia positions.  Currently I am working in the estate managing the termina=
ted power book for Racicot.
=20
In early November, when it was only EBS that was on its way to shutting dow=
n, I was in discussions with Dana about re-joining the EPMI team.  It sound=
ed as if there was a definite need and Dana seemed eager to bring me back o=
n the team.  I realize everything has changed since then, though I am still=
 hoping I can fill a need.  I have been attempting to sit down with Dana to=
 identify current and near term needs, but we have yet to meet up.  I want =
to make sure that some random timing issue doesn't negatively impact my pro=
spects of securing a spot, so I am hoping that now maybe I can discuss with=
 you any opportunities.  If there are not opportunities, then that is valua=
ble feedback as well so that I can appropriately direct my job search post-=
estate.  I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.

Regards,
Fred Cohagan
Director, EWS

  RTO Week
Day 2 -- October 16, 2001
Transmission Planning & Expansion
The afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion. The pane=
lists were: Jose Degado--CEO American Transmission Company, Michael Dworkin=
--Chair Vermont PSC, Mark Maher--VP Transmission Business Line, Bonneville =
Power Administration, Lara Manz--PSE&G, Masheed Rosenqvist--National Grid, =
Steve Walton--Enron.
General Observations
The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from t=
ime to time.  Commissioner's Breathitt and Massey were the most active in q=
uestioning.  The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initi=
al presentations, moving along the discussion by asking questions.  There w=
as some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management, howev=
er, there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmiss=
ion rights.  There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the R=
TO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market (wh=
ere are problems, how might they be solved, etc.) and that the where possib=
le that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit.  Ther=
e was a good deal of discussion of "least cost planning" and the identifica=
tion of options which are not transmission related.  All agreed there had t=
o be backstop authority to build transmission, however then the challenge i=
s who pays for it, which raises the need for dispute resolution. =20
Opening Statements
Jose Delgado: ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system op=
erator.  They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met.  They =
were formed by divestiture by IOUS, coops and munis and with a $500 million=
 asset base initially. Their current ten year plan will add $1billion of in=
vestment.   Their top priorities are connecting generation and load. =20
Michael Dworkin: Because transmission is a common good, construction affect=
s all parties not just one party.  The environmental and permitting of line=
s requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view.  The ide=
a of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multi-state project=
s, although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been us=
ed by FCC.  State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which=
 must be considered.
Mark Maher: FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when =
considering congestion management.  LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems =
with their multiple use obligations.  RTO West is developing a planning pro=
cess which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in =
the future.  The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process.
Laura Manz: The various aspects of planning are connected.  Pricing (LMP) i=
s the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and re=
sources.   No competitor should have an advantage over another.  The RTO ne=
eds a central planning process but it shouldn't push solutions.  The market=
 should decide on solutions. =20
Masheed Rosenqvist: The morning discussion of congestion management talked =
about hedging against risk.  The planning discussion is not about what we h=
ave now, but about how to avoid future congestion.  The Commission has take=
n conflicting positions in different cases.  The issues that need to be ans=
wered are:  How can merchant transmission be compensated?  Should transmiss=
ion projects be open to RFPs?  Is FERC open to market based pricing for exp=
ansions? =20
Steve Walton:  The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to =
settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that h=
as frozen transmission investment.  The RTO debate has been going on for 5 =
years or more and needs to be settled.  For expansion to go forward, there =
needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party.  Y=
ou are always going to have muddy issues in planning.  For instance if a 13=
8 kV line is all that is needed to day, but future considerations of scare =
right-of-way say a 345 kV line should be built, who pays for the extra cost=
.  In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dis=
pute resolution process, appeal able to FERC, to decide such matters.
Discussion
Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current cong=
estion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose.=
  Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built=
 with the beneficiaries funding.  Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about =
use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say=
 this is the best solution, i.e. least cost planning.  This lead to discuss=
ion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so=
 they can make intelligent decisions. =20
Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was (a) under built and =
needed lots of expansion so don't worry about overbuilding or (b) transmiss=
ion planning should consider all options before construction of new facilit=
ies.  The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the =
process.  Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions.  L=
aura Manz felt that the term "under built" is a secondary effect of not hav=
ing proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties.
Dick O'Neil asked if LMP will work in the West.  Mark Maher said it wouldn'=
t.  Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics, they manage h=
ydro facilities in PJM.  Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure=
 of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought n=
ot to be rejected just intelligently designed.  BPA is looking pricing mode=
l but LMP won't work.  Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch,=
 but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some "twea=
ks" like bilaterals and allow operator self-schedule output levels to permi=
t  river coordination.  Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to max=
imize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis.  PJM has hydro, =
but not 70% as in the Northwest.  Implementation will be different because =
such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro a=
nd base load coal.
In the summation at the end of the panel, four principles were listed:  (1)=
 RTO must provide information, (2) RTO should identify solutions, (3) RTO s=
hould be unbiased and (4) the RTO should be accountable.  The disagreement =
was over the last two points, Michael Dworkin felt that #3 (unbiased) was c=
ritical and that #4 (accountability) was accomplished by having regulators =
involved in governance.  Jose Delgado said and Transco can't be unbiased si=
nce it provides services, although the ISO above it can be, but accountabil=
ity is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake.  This last =
point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the =
tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues.

New Power Plant Planned
for New York City



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis



[News item from Energy Info Source] New York state's siting board approved =
Astoria Energy's plans to build a 1,000-megawatt power plant in New York Ci=
ty, clearing the way for construction to begin as early as January. Astoria=
 Energy hopes to have the natural-gas-fired, combined-cycle plant that will=
 be at an existing oil terminal in the Astoria section of Queens in service=
 by 2004. The company must do a certain amount of demolition and site prepa=
ration before it can begin construction, and still must receive some local =
permits from New York City. Astoria Energy is a unit of SCS Energy LLC, a p=
rivately owned energy development company based in Concord, Mass.=20

Analysis: The announcement of a new power plant scheduled for the New York =
City area should be evaluated within the context of severe power supply pro=
blems that have been identified within this region. Like California, New Yo=
rk also suffers from a supply / demand imbalance. However, even if or when =
power supply can be increased in New York, the core load center of New York=
 City still suffers from inherent transmission deficiencies that continue t=
o take their own toll on the stability of the market. In other words, trans=
mission capacity in the region has been determined to be deficient to the e=
xtent that power outside of the city cannot be reliably imported. The fact =
that Astoria Energy has received approval from New York state's siting boar=
d to proceed with this New York City-based plant is significant, but it sho=
uld not be forgotten that the company also must receive local permits from =
city government. This could be easier said than done, as other planned powe=
r plants in the area have been blocked or significantly altered over the la=
st year by community groups in New York City and surrounding boroughs who a=
rdently voice concerns about environmental and other ramifications of new p=
lant construction.=20

The problems within the New York power market have been well documented. Th=
e state of New York reportedly has not brought a new plant online since 199=
6, when a 200-MW plant opened in Brooklyn. It has been almost seven years s=
ince a 1,000-MW unit in Oswego, N.Y., marked the last plant to open upstate=
. Further, New York expects only a 3.5-percent increase in new capacity in =
the next three to four years. Consequently, concerns about the state's abil=
ity to meet increasing demand for power have gained momentum. Pressure has =
been placed on New York regulators to expedite the approval steps for sitin=
g new plants in the state. However, at the same time, environmental and com=
munity groups closely guard the proposals for new plants and often lobby fo=
r limitations on how and where the new plant will produce power.=20

While the entire state of New York is subject to shortages, the problem app=
ears to be particularly acute in New York City. A November 2000 report issu=
ed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) entitled "Investigati=
on of Bulk Power Markets, Northeast Region," highlighted specific capacity =
problems in the New York City/Long Island community of 11 million people. T=
hese areas are particularly vulnerable because they are isolated from most =
of the state's grid, the study said. Like Northern California, which suffer=
ed rolling blackouts due to transmission constraints, New York City and Lon=
g Island can only import limited quantities of power on constrained transmi=
ssion lines. Hydro and fossil resources are plentiful in upstate New York, =
but cannot reach the city. Being both densely populated and heavily residen=
tial, it is difficult to site new power plants in the area. Consequently, 8=
0 percent of the power that the city consumes is generated by the city. New=
 plants such as the one by Astoria Energy are being proposed because New Yo=
rk City reportedly will be short of its generating capacity needs at times =
during the course of 2002. The projected shortfall is expected to increase =
by another 200 MW by summer 2002.=20

Increased demand is causing additional problems for the energy markets of N=
ew York City and New York State. Demand in the state rose by 2,700 MW from =
1995 to 2000, or 2.5 times as fast as new generation capacity was added. De=
mand over the course of 2001 was expected to reach 31,100 MW, or about 3.7 =
percent above regulators' earlier forecasts.=20

It is within this market context that Astoria Energy will proceed with its =
plans for the new power plant in New York City. Astoria Energy is a private=
 company seeking to generate electric power with energy-efficient and envir=
onmentally sound technologies in the New York City area. The company is a s=
ubsidiary of SCS Energy, a privately owned energy development company forme=
d in 1998 for the purpose of developing and owning new electric generating =
facilities. Information obtained from Astoria Energy sheds some additional =
light on the proposed plant. As noted, the 1,000-MW unit will be a natural =
gas-fired facility, which will obtain natural gas supplied from the ConEd/N=
ew York facility pipeline. The capital cost for the plant reportedly will b=
e $600 million. Commercial operation, pending the necessary approvals on th=
e local level, is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2003. Astoria Energy =
is seemingly confident of its chances to gain approval for the new plant be=
cause it will be using a technology that is specifically geared toward the =
reduction of air emissions.=20

However, despite this optimism, the community opposition factor should not =
be discounted, and there are several examples that may foreshadow the oppos=
ition that Astoria Energy could face. Take Sithe Energies, for example, whi=
ch hit a roadblock with its construction plans in the New York area earlier=
 this year. Sithe Energies originally planned a 827-MW combined-cycle facil=
ity fueled by natural gas in Ramapo, N.Y. Chief among the concerns of local=
 residents is that the Ramapo plant was originally planned to run all the t=
ime to meet demand, and as a result would use local water resources for coo=
ling purposes. Community resistance thus became an issue for the company, w=
hich altered its plans and began to consider a 510-MW peaking unit (also po=
wered by natural gas) that would only be operated in times of increased dem=
and.=20

As another example, environmental and community groups won a victory in cou=
rt just last week that essentially will block construction of small power p=
lants in the South Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, and Long Island areas. Each is =
a 44-MW plant, though at some sites there are twin generators operating at =
less than 80 MW. A coalition of the groups had opposed the construction of =
various plants in these areas and sued the New York Power Authority, claimi=
ng (among other things) that the state had failed to perform adequate envir=
onmental-review studies. The groups claim that the state should test the pl=
ants for their output of fine particulate matter. A lower court had ruled i=
n favor of the state, but a judgment last week in the New York Court of App=
eals was clearly a win for the environmental and community groups. The new =
ruling, which reportedly cannot be appealed further, says that the state mu=
st do unprecedented air tests at the 10 plants or shut them down by Jan. 31=
.=20

In a report issued earlier this year, New York State Electric & Gas Corp. (=
NYSEG), one of New York's seven utilities, said the state will not have eno=
ugh megawatts to support a truly competitive wholesale electric market unti=
l 2008. NYSEG, in a report issued late Wednesday, warned there are "serious=
 problems with (New York's) generation supply and a lack of transmission an=
d pipeline infrastructure." According to data included in a separate report=
 by the New York ISO, which manages the state's transmission grid, between =
1995 and 2000, while statewide demand in New York rose by 2,700 MW, generat=
ing capacity under contract in the state reportedly increased only by 1,060=
 MW.=20

Consequently, given all of these factors, power supplies in New York remain=
ed strained and the area certainly could benefit from the construction of n=
ew generation capacity. However, Astoria Energy, which seeks to bring new g=
eneration online in New York that will be based on clean technologies, may =
still face an uphill battle from various groups that seemingly oppose the c=
onstruction of any new plants in the region (with the exception of peaker u=
nits, whose output would be closely regimented). If plans for this plant ar=
e blocked or significantly altered, following the experience of Sithe Energ=
ies, the options to resolve New York City's supply / demand imbalance will =
once again become focused on a combination of other approaches, including c=
onservation efforts and reliance on distributed generation alternatives.=20

Subject: Enron's FERC filing opposing icap



Today at FERC, Enron filed a pleading requesting the complete elimination of "icap" as a product (including any "reserve type" products) based on the fact that the real time spot markets of the RTOS can effectively price this in the cost of energy.  The pleading also includes a proposed interim approach (with a two year sunset date).  This pleading was made in response to FERC's request for comments on "Ensuring Sufficient Capacity Reserves In Today's Energy Markets."

The pleading and affidavit of Larry Ruff, PhD are attached.

Group Developing "SeTrans RTO" Files Status Report at
FERC; Entergy Joins SeTrans Process

New Orleans, La. - The Entergy Operating Companies have
joined in the effort to develop the proposed Southeast
RTO, SeTrans. Today, the group of transmission systems
developing the SeTrans RTO filed a status report with the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to update it
on the progress of the RTO formation and to advise it that
Entergy has joined the group of companies forming the RTO.
The companies proposing to form the SeTrans RTO are
Entergy, Southern Company, City of Dalton Utilities, MEAG
Power, South Mississippi Electric Power Association, City
of Tallahassee, JEA, Santee Cooper, and the Georgia
Transmission Corporation.

The proposed RTO, named SeTrans Grid Company, was recently
expanded to include Entergy as a participating
transmission owner. Once it becomes operational, SeTrans
will be one of the nation's largest RTOs with more than
73,000 MW's of generation, 51,000 miles of transmission,
representing a transmission investment in excess of $9
billion.

This filing is the latest step in a process that began in
June when owners of transmission systems across Alabama,
Florida, Georgia, Mississippi and South Carolina signed a
memorandum of understanding to form an RTO for the
Southeast. While the filing today will outline the initial
proposed structure of the RTO, Entergy intends to work
with the Arkansas Public Service Commission, the Louisiana
Public Service Commission, the Mississippi Public Service
Commission, the New Orleans City Council, and the Public
Utilities Commission of Texas and the operating companies'
other retail regulators to address concerns that they may
have with the proposed RTO.

"We believe that the SeTrans model, as it has evolved, is
the best platform to achieve the mutual goals of the
various involved companies. The structure of the SeTrans
RTO partnership will be of significant size and scope. The
SeTrans RTO structure is consistent with the structure
that Entergy was pursuing with the Southwest Power Pool,
but in a region that is more reflective of our actual
market activity," said Frank Gallaher, president fossil
operations and transmission for Entergy.

The structure chosen by the participating transmission
owners will involve hiring a proven independent operator
for the transmission system. The agreements between the
operator and transmission owners will provide incentives
to the operator to maintain or enhance reliability,
minimize the cost of the operation of the system and
enhance the efficient use of the system. A detailed
description of the proposed governance structure of
SeTrans, the proposed role of stakeholders in the
selection of the independent third party operator, and the
ongoing role of the Stakeholder Advisory Committee are all
described in today's filing.

Beginning in June, the City of Dalton (Ga.) Utilities,
City of Tallahassee (Fla.) Georgia Transmission
Corporation, JEA -- Jacksonville (Fla.), the Municipal
Electric Authority of Georgia; Santee Cooper (S.C.),
Southern Company and South Mississippi Electric Power
Association have been working on the formation of a
regional transmission organization for the Southeastern
United States.

SeTrans will hold a "Stakeholder Meeting" in Mid-January,
2002, in Atlanta, Georgia to establish a stakeholder
advisory committee. Details on the meeting's registration
process, agenda and map to the meeting will be posted on
the SeTrans web site, www.setransgrid.com.

billion, is a major global energy company engaged in power
production, distribution operations, and related
diversified services, with more than 15,000 employees.

Kevin,

I have worked with this guy at EBS for the past year and think he is a good candidate for the group.  He has worked for Marcello Romano (he has a favorable view of him also).  He traded oil products at Goldman a few years back and is interested in coming to the U.S. from our London office.  

Let me know what you think.  Perhaps Louise can weigh in also if she knows him.  

John

Elizabeth Sager indicated that Wabash has given appropriate termination notice on all transactions associated with the EEI. I will confirm with David Portz to make sure their termination notice covers any one off contracts in the event they exist.

Are there any one off contracts and does the Wabash termination notice cover if there are? Please advise.

My understanding is that we have posted bonds in excess of $60M and are in compliance with the NEPOOL Financial Assurance Policy.
EPMI and EES are not relying upon an Enron Corp. guaranty to provide any part of the financial assurance required by NEPOOL. 
	
Suggest we can take one of four courses of action:  (1)   Do nothing;

					    	   (2)    Request and authorize the ISO-NE to disclose to concerned NEPOOL participants the fact that EPMI and EES 						           have posted bonds to ensure compliance with the NEPOOL Financial Assurance Policy and that no part of the    						           financial assurance required is provided by an Enron Corp. guaranty;

					   	   (3)    Send a letter to all NEPOOL participants confirming that EPMI and EES financial assurance obligations are being 						           met solely by the posting of bonds;
				
					               (4)    Combination of both (2) and (3).
	

If there is a perception or a clear understanding that the credit downgrade of Enron Corp. is the reason for a reduction in trading activity with EPMI and/or EES in NEPOOL and that NEPOOL participants will respond favorably if they knew that the financial assurance is provided by way of bonds, not an Enron Corp. guaranty, then option (1) should be discarded.
	
Option (2) may be enough to give the comfort to "concerned" participants.
	
Option (3) and (4) will ensure that any letter we send out will make its way into the press, almost as soon as it is sent and if we send any such letter out we need to be prepared to meet any media interest. Further, the publication of any such letter in the press may encourage other counterparties in other forum to demand that EPMI and/or EES post bonds in order to continue trading and could materially adversely affect our trading activities.
	
If we considered that any disclosure would make a material difference to the confidence that NEPOOL participants have in trading with EPMI and/or EES, my recommendation would be to pursue Option (2).

Marcus

Kevin, Rogers, and Dana -- We do not have to do or say anything since, per NEPOOL, Enron is in compliance.  However, if you feel that NEPOOL participants are not trading with us and we need to make some statement, we can (if ok with legal).  Let us know. Thanks.

Subject:	nepool financial assurance



I got a call today from Ed McKenna, the ISO-NE treasurer.  He is getting a large volume of calls from NEPOOL Participants concerned about Enron Corp's credit rating.  He is telling these Participants that his office only monitors whether NEPOOL members EPMI and EES are in compliance with the NEPOOL Financial Assurance Policy, which they are, and does not monitor Enron Corp.  Ed suggested that when PG&E experienced difficulties PG&E drafted a short notice, which ISO-NE circulated, explaining how its subsidiaries were not affected by the credit rating of the parent.  The ISO is offering us the same opportunity to draft and circulate something similar if we wish.

What may be going on here is a concern by NEPOOL Participants that we are using a parent guaranty to meet the Financial Assurance Policy.  My recollection, however, is that we have instead posted surety bonds from AA agencies to meet NEPOOL credit requirements.  If we disclosed this to the NEPOOL Participants it might allay their credit concerns.  We may however, not want to disclose this if we are employing parent guarantees elsewhere, lest we be asked to post surety bonds everywhere.  Can you discuss this with the traders and see what they want to do?

 RTO Week

Day 3 -- October 17, 2001

Standardizing RTO Tariffs

The morning panel focused on which transmission services should be standardized in RTO tariffs across an interconnection or the entire country.  There were many diverse views on the panel, and the Staff and commissioners were somewhat more engaged in this session.  

The panelists were:  Ricky Bittle, Arkansas Electric Coop; Jim Caldwell, American Wind; Peter Esposito, Dynegy; Rory McMinn, New Mexico PSC; Glenn Ross, Dominion Resources; Audrey Zibelman, XCEL Energy.

General Observations

This panel had a lot less agreement than the previous panels.  Dynegy opposes standardization of a transmission tariff and urges FERC to give strong guidance to stakeholders and then let the stakeholders work out the details of a new tariff.  Dominion advocates a more prescriptive approach by FERC, noting that stakeholders have been unable to reach agreement over the last five years.  EXCEL has it's own focus - they want to be an ITC and want to provide many of the RTO services without being an RTO.  The Wind group is mostly concerned about the ability to provide generation on an "as available" basis.   The commissioner from New Mexico does not want standardization, does not want FERC stepping on the state's jurisdictional toes, and does not want New Mexico ratepayers' rates to go up.  Arkansas Electric Coop insists that SPP transmission capacity is full, so if competitors want to move power through SPP, new transmission must first be built.

I am somewhat concerned that some of the Commissioners may believe that tariff standardization is not necessary.  While the Dynegy concept had merit at one time, it may be too late to rely on the stakeholder process to resolve issues, and it could take many months to go through the process, only to have FERC, in the end, decide the details anyway.  We may want to submit comments on this issue to FERC at the conclusion of RTO Week.

What Services Should be Standardized?

Overall, Dynegy opposes standardizing tariffs but believes certain aspects of reservations should be standardized -- timing, confirmation processing, maintenance issues, bus names, ramping protocols, assumptions for ATC calculations, posting times, bumping rules, and settlement time.  With regard to congestion management, it should not be standardized between RTOs.  

XCEL does not support a standardized tariff but urges FERC to standardize some issues such as CBM calculations, reserve obligations and load balancing and penalties.  American Wind says FERC must focus on having liquid spot markets in RTOs and not worry about tariff standardization.  Dominion cautions FERC about Dynegy's proposal to let the industry work out the details.  He says this is what happened with Order No. 2000 and the industry was unable to work it out.  

Should FERC Retain CBM?

Ricky (Arkansas Coop) believes that the bigger the RTO, the less important CBM is because the RTO will have enough resources internally to effectuate reserve sharing.  Dynegy thinks CBM should be eliminated.  Dominion thinks CBM should be retained but the rules need to be changed.  CBM should not be set for a year - it changes on a daily basis and this should be reflected.  Nor should CBM be standardized because needs vary region to region.  However, because CBM is used for load, the cost of CBM should be allocated to load.  All panelists agreed with the concept that if CBM is retained, load should be required to purchase it as a service provided under the tariff.

Network Versus Point to Point Service

Peter (Dynegy) discussed the need to develop a new type of transmission service that combines the best features from network and point to point, similar to transportation service offered in gas -- firm and interruptible.  Peter suggests starting with the CRT tariff proposed several years ago.  Glenn (Dominion) thinks the CRT is outdated and thinks we need a new type of service but agrees that it should combine the best elements of network and point to point.  

Should all Transmission Service Be Under the RTO's Tariff?

Most of the panelists said yes, all service should be under the tariff, but Ricky Bittle said there needs to be a transition period - minimum of 5 years, no more than 10 years.  Commissioner McMinn said no - he sees this as an infringement on the states' jurisdiction.

What Services Need to Be Changed Under a New RTO Tariff?

Jim (Wind) believes that the imbalance provisions must be revised so as not to penalize "as available" resources.  Ricky thinks transmission expansion is the most important issue to address in a new tariff.  XCEL urges FERC to recognize the distinction between RTOs and ITCs and allow ITCs to design and offer their own transmission tariffs.

Ray Alvarez will circulate a summary of the afternoon panel on Cost Allocation.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Saw you were responsible for getting PA, etc. done with VEPCO.  Woody and I are willing to step in or help carry some water if you would like.  By the way, are you including Dominion's unregulated arm with that?

Let me know.  Thanks!

Terry

There will be a UBSWE Migration TONIGHT....please make sure that you LOG OFF before you leave today.  

Monday morning, (2/4/02), you will logon with your Enron NT Account and Password.  You will immediately be forced to change your password (following Enron rules) and your NT ID will stay the same.  Once you've changed your password, and logged off AGAIN, you will see the UBS Warburg Energy Screen....email will not be affected until day one.

Starting Monday, you will receive emails from IT support to explain the HOW TO's for your data that YOU  will need to begin transferring over to UBS.  All material will need to be in compliance with UBS standards and NO documents or emails are to be deleted.  In Outlook the following information will be transferred over by IT: Calendar, Contacts, Tasks, and Notes.  Emails (Inbox, Sent Items and Deleted Items) and folder structure will NOT be migrated.

ALL data MUST be migrated PRIOR to day one (estimated to be 02/08/02 ), as access to Enron data will be disabled Day 1.

Thanks for your immediate help in this matter.

Here are the office locations that Louise has assigned:

Calger	06105
Presto	06103
Shively	06102

T Jae, it was decided today that legal will move over here this weekend.  Can you please arrange for Kevin's things to be boxed up so legal can move in downstairs over the weekend.

Ina, if there are any of John Arnold's personal effects left on 5 can you please have them boxed up?

If we can hold off until next week to set the new offices up I'm sure that Darren and David would be very grateful!

Thanks for your help!
Tammy

Kevin/Paul -

Apparently the new/separate curve database will not be copied until Monday 2/4.  Therefore, we need to decide who will be responsible for marking curves until such time.

Over the last few days our group has attempted to mark curves but has not been able to because the Netco group is still performing this function (in most cases).  My suggestion is that Netco employees continue to mark curves until the new database is completed.  At that time, there will be two separate processes.  The Enron estate process will only be marking curves where we have live (not terminated) positions including vol positions.

In the meantime, our group will be focusing on validation of the 11/30 and 12/03 curves as well as any other dates that will be crucial for termination calculation purposes.  We will need access to all back-up curve data captured during these time periods.

Please let me know if you agree.

Rogers

Obviously, coordination with gas and power fundies (rika imai and chris gaskill) is important for almost all projects unless confidentiality is necessary given the nature of the project scope.   My view is No. 1 is part of Rika's core day to day world.   No. 2 and No. 4 are more special project in nature and this is a gap you could help fill.

I will be out Wednesday through Friday so we should sit down tomorrow.

Hey Kevin- thanks for the intro at the Fundy meeting on Friday- would like to sit down with you to talk priorities this week if you have time.  

For Power East, I know you want maximum bang for your buck across a limited number of projects, so I'm thinking:

1. New Gen
2. Hydro Quebec reservoir levels
3. Oil "shock"/terrorism
4. Coal- utility stockpiles

Thanks,

Robert Johnston

Tony -

I received a voicemail from Kevin Presto stating that he forgot to elect Legal plan coverage - he would like the comprehensive plan.

Can you please add this?  I understand through Jeanie that the copies were all sent to Stamford on Friday.

Thanks!

Repairs to the internal coating of the demineralized water storage tank have
been completed.  Therefore, I would like to request an outage for the Sand
Hill Energy Center on Friday, October 26 from 7 AM to 4 PM.  The purpose is
to remove temporary piping and restore normal connections to the
Demineralized Water Storage Tank.  This will restore the Demin. water system
to its normal configuration.  We will not be able to operate the units while
this work is in progress.  Your immediate approval of this outage is
requested.


Thanks,
John Wester
Plant Manager

Electricity  Risk Management 101 Workshop 
And
Portfolio  Optimization for Electric Utilities Conference
January  22-25, 2002, New York City, NY
 
OVERVIEW
 

In the current environment of  volatile energy prices and deregulation, it has become increasingly more  important for the electricity industry to learn how to manage price risk. EUCI  presents two events formatted for the beginner to the expert in price risk  management. The first Workshop is designed for the beginner with no prior  experience in risk management and introduces the basic vocabulary and concepts  in a concise and easily understandable format which forms the foundation for the  more advanced concepts applied in the second event (Conference).
 
The brochure for the Electricity Risk Management 101  Workshop and the Portfolio Optimization for Electric Utilities  Conference can be  obtained by clicking on the link below:http://www.euci.com/pdf/risk_mgmt.pdf 
 

Transmission  Expansion and Systems in Transition Conference
Feb.  5-8, 2002, Miami, Florida
OVERVIEW

 
This conference will examine the  business and regulatory challenges to U.S. electric systems in transition in  effectively expanding transmission capacity to meet new demands in the larger  and more competitive regional markets emerging under FERC's RTO  initiatives.  The conference will  review the parameters of these challenges and possible solutions to them.  It will examine technology options and  new business models for transmission expansion.  It will analyze emerging proposals for  effective transmission planning and pricing, including market-based pricing  alternatives to FERC's traditional pricing methods. The conference will also  discuss what it will take in legislative action and regulatory initiative to  achieve an efficient regime for ensuring that the nation has a reliable grid and  regional trading system.

Dana,

I met with Kevin last night to discuss a possible opportunity within your team.  We agreed that you and I should meet to discuss that interest.  I have done extensive work with EWS Retail Risk Mgmt on managing the New York retail-portfolio, amongst other things that I'll be happy to talk to you about.

Let us talk at your convenience.  Thanks.

Juan

Hey Kevin- thanks for the intro at the Fundy meeting on Friday- would like to sit down with you to talk priorities this week if you have time.  

For Power East, I know you want maximum bang for your buck across a limited number of projects, so I'm thinking:

1. New Gen
2. Hydro Quebec reservoir levels
3. Oil "shock"/terrorism
4. Coal- utility stockpiles

Thanks,

Robert Johnston

This is not a circular and you will not get another chance.  This deals with migration to new systems and you need to migrate your own information or applications in the next day.  Remember do not delete anything and data to be transferred must comply (see attachments below).

The policy must be complied by Thursday.  Please ensure that everyone in your group has moved everything which is in compliance with the policy.  We will not be delaying close or restart for people not having completed their own migrations.

Please make sure that those people who are not in the office are contacted and comply (eg Dana - please cover Kevin's migration requirements)

Thanks

Louise

We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8.

To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.

Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our "live" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:

Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)
Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup
Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week

Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:

Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups:
Profile tests for "external" customers (role-played by Originators)
Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)
Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems

Traders and Originators:
Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.
Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation.

Information Technology:
Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.
After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books
Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.


Next steps 

Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.
Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.
UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.


Summary

This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.

If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861).

We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your "native" desktop.

i have no desire to try to change your mind, but need to understand a couple of things.  can we spend a few minutes on monday or tues?    shoudl i assume that you do not want any responsibility for the runoff book if i leave the company?  that's fine if you dont, i understand it might just be a distraction for you, but if i make a recommendation i want to make sure i accurately reflect your opinion so that i can unravel it or sell it.  i'm talking to belden separately about the west positions.

Rogers,

I want to run a few ideas past you for the City of Houston.  There are a co=
uple of issues we need to address for the RFP.  I will list them out, give =
you my suggestions and then please comment and send back.

1) The City is asking for a possible 30 day holding period for pricing so t=
hey can get together and vote on the award of the contract
I think we can do one of two things:  we can say pricing is indicative and =
will be set once the bid is awarded.  Or we can say that we will hold price=
s, however, for every X% move in gas our power price will move accordingly,=
 given a stated correlation, and our price will only move up and not down. =
 Or we could do a % move in MW Daily Index, but I think that index can be a=
 poor indicator of forward curve fluctuations.

2) Appropriations Risk - There is not much we can do here except keep it to=
 a one year deal.  However, I am having them look into a possible costless =
collar for the City.  They are, by definition, short going forward and left=
 exposed to higher prices.  If wholesale prices are say 35, we sell them a =
higher priced call and we buy a lower price put at offsetting option premiu=
ms for say cal 03.  That way they can hedge their risk costlessly.  The wor=
st case scenarios for them are 1) they buy say $40 power (if that is the ca=
ll strike), or 2) they buy $30 power (if that is our put strike).  If I was=
 a city, this is what I would do to hedge if I could not do a longer term d=
eal.  There are some issues here though.  If they do not get appropriated t=
he money, we might not be able to exercise our put.  If EES management deci=
des they are comfortable with appropriations risk, I think an option premiu=
m is better risk than out right hedging against a possible phantom position=
.  Second alternative is that we can sell the fixed retail gen past the app=
ropriations date and we, as a desk, can collar it to hedge out our marked t=
o market risk.  This of course would only hedge our wholesale risk but that=
 should be about 80-90% of the risk.

Right now these are the major issues facing the desk on this deal.  Please =
let me know your thoughts.  Thanks.  By the way, you missed a good dinner l=
ast night.  Lavo was hilarious.

-Joe

as Full Requirement  and load following contract. 
?	It also provides a valuation tool for power assets and asset management deals.
?	It works for both deal specific or portfolio issues.

In this presentation we will show how the model can be used to deal with various types 
of contracts, explain the model structure and point out further applications.

Kevin & Tim --

Attached is EPSA's standard market position that they will push next week at FERC.  It is a great start on what I think that UBS Warburg Energy will want to push.  I think that we should discuss joining EPSA as quickly as possible to make sure that we have a vehicle to insert our views into the activities at FERC on future market structures ($175k per year).  

Any issues?

Jim

MEMORANDUM

TO: Regulatory Affairs Committee

FROM: Bob Reilley, Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair
            Tim Thuston, Regulatory Affairs Committee Vice Chair
            Julie Simon, Vice President of Policy

DATE: January 30, 2002

RE: Preparation for FERC Workshops on Standard Market
      Design
      ?Conference Call on Friday, February 1st at 11:00 a.m. (EST)

Based on discussions at the Regulatory Affairs Committee Meeting and our meeting with the FERC staff earlier this week, we have drafted a "Bare Essentials" leave-behind for the Standard Market Design workshops at FERC next week.  Like the "Bare Essentials" developed for RTO week last fall, the bullets are focused on big picture issues where significant consensus was developed.  Because we do not yet have a detailed agenda for next week, we have designed the leave-behind to track our key issues.

As we also discussed on Monday, Craig Roach has been asked by the Chairman's office to prepare a possible new approach to market power under a standard market design.  Craig is developing a draft paper for consideration, which will be circulated for review early tomorrow.
We will be holding a conference call on Friday, February 1st at 11:00 a.m. (EST) to discuss the draft leave-behind and Craig's paper.  To access the call, dial 1-800-937-6563 and ask for the Julie Simon/EPSA call.   If you have any questions, comments or suggestions, please contact Julie Simon at 202-628-8200 or jsimon@epsa.org.

Kevin -
 
Any word on how this might affect things?  The following excerpt was from an article I read:  

One main concern of the creditors continues to be the information contained in Enron's book of business. They argue that the UBS deal, as structured, would relieve Enron's traders from their confidentiality agreements regarding information about trading positions. 

"Knowing the content of the book would be very detrimental to the value of the book," said David Derosa, an expert witness for the creditors.

He added: "Paired with UBS' credit rating it will create a perfect predatory trading machine."

We will need to be packed and ready to move for WEDNESDAY, 02/06/02 & THURSDAY, 02/07/02.  The move team will be moving our group during the day and the stenos will NOT be working until Monday, 02/11/02.


Also, please make sure that we LOGOFF again tonight...the IT group could not migrate us over the weekend due to incomplete items with legal.  They are going to try and take care of the migration tonight for the new UBS systems.


Thanks for your help.

It appears that the following email may not have been clear.  You have to copy all documents yourself.

This is my cheat sheet if it helps:  

H Drives:
1.  Each person will have to move any data over personally from the old H drive (which is now Z:) drive to their new H drive.  
2. The Z: drive (old H:) will be removed from UBS employees on Thursday night.

O Drives:
1. For the old O or M drives go to O:\ESTATE\ O (or M ? pending location of data) and copy to the new common O.  The Estate O and M will be removed from UBS employees on Thursday night.

Do not delete anything and only copy information which is complies with the policy.  Please make sure that those people who are not in the office are contacted and comply.

We know you have questions about recent events impacting Enron and our plans for the future.  Ongoing investigations and pending litigation have made it difficult, if not impossible, to share information in a timely manner.  While we can't address certain issues, we can tell you about our initial plans to move Enron forward and emerge from bankruptcy, and we are eager to do that.

We had planned to hold an all-employee meeting tomorrow, January 23, at the Hyatt Regency.  However, we don't want to subject you to the media frenzy that would certainly surround such a meeting, so we've decided to postpone it.  We are currently making arrangements to hold a series of employee meetings within the building to protect your privacy.  We will provide the date and times to you as soon as the logistics for those meetings are finalized.

Prior to the employee meetings, we will provide an overview of Enron's new organizational structure.  You can expect that memo shortly.

Lavo thinks we should consider Redmond as a good candidate to fill one of the marketing holes that we have in East Power or gas.  Any thoughts?

I have no major changes, but Arctic air mass plunging into Plains now on
short range models.

Overall, the progression of ideas from last week look to hold true for this
week and beyond. The very cold weather will probably be a bit more expansive
by the end of the week than I had originally planned for, which means colder
for Texas, the Tennessee Valley, the Midwest and Ohio Valley later this
week. The deep Southeast and along the East coast it will turn colder later
this week but the coldest of air will not reach those areas.

Snow and ice will probably reach as far south as Oklahoma City in the Plains
and western PJM in the East during mid to late week. Houston may have
trouble getting out of the 40s for highs Thursday as compared to near 80
degree temps currently. A large area of snowcover will become established
over the next 5-10 days over the northern and central U.S.

I continue to believe the models look too warm in the long range, especially
in Canada. Once Canada gets cold at this time of year, it will likely stay
very cold. This will set the stage for additional cold air to spread across
the United States east of the Rockies in the long range.

Bottom line - true Winter is about to begin, the bear show is over.

They qualified to mark when closed but might not today due to development of accounting rules and heightened internal scrutiny.  At this point it is discretionary - we need to figure out the position we would like to take.

I can put together some examples of how we might be effected and walk you and Don through them.

Terry -

Excellent point.  Obviously, not marking these contracts opens up a can of worms.  I guess neither Anderson nor RAC had an issue with marking these deals initially.  Do the non LD termination provisions definitely negate our ability to mark or is the call discretionary?

The following concern has arisen:  Many of the contracts we have discussed have non-market based LDs that may impact our ability to mark the value.  Tyco is a good example - The contract has site specific termination amounts that are unrelated to our MTM values.  

Many deals appear to have similar problems - I would like your opinions on this.  Specifically do we want to force the issue and only mark in accordance with the contractual language.

Please let me know your thoughts as soon as possible.

Kevin,

I just met w/ New Smyrna.  They are interested in a parking deal.  They can probably only do up to 50MW, but they have done these deals in the past and are comfortable with how they work.  I will be back in Houston on Fri.  You can reach me at 713-503-2166 if you need anything.

Rogers,

Been on the road since we met. Saw that Warburgs is picking up some portion
of trading activity. Are you going with them? Let me know whats going on
when you have the chance.

Gas is looking uglier than when we talked about it in Houston. Seems likely
to be at least 1.5 TCF end of March. I am thinking that we will see $1.50ish
prices before we get out of the winter. I am still thinking that coal will
provide some support but prices have gotten really sick.

Still hoping to stop units under construction. Still not hearing about that
yet. Saw NRG started construction on a 1,200 MW unit in Entergy. Whatever
they are smoking, we ought to get some.

Hope all is well with you guys.

Regards,
Allan

Attached is the second draft of Enron's comments to FERC on ICAP.  The structure of the paper is summarised below:

1.  RTO's are a positive step forward for the industry.
2.  Spot markets are a necessary part of RTO development to ensure that the RTO can manage real time realiability.
3.  A well functioning spot market eliminates the need for separate capacity type products such as ICAP, reserve margin (i.e. it achieves the objectives of iCap).  The paper incorporates theoretical and emperical evidence from other sectors of the economy and deregulation in other parts of the world to support this conclusion.
4.  During the transition from a regulated environment to RTO's there may be a 'political' need for ICAP.  Specifically states that any interim proposal should be limited to 2 years after RTO implementation.
5.  If that is the case, the paper sets out the two common theoretical platforms which can be used as a basis for ICAP.
6.  Proposes two options based on the theroetical platforms.  

We would appreciate input on two issues.

Firstly, Enron needs to make a decision on whether to limit our position to reliance on spot markets (i.e. don't suggest an interim solution).  While this is attractive, it is unlikely that Enron will get support from other participants (ICAP payments subsidize generation investment so no support from IPP's and consumers are not as confident as Enron that competitive markets will maintain reliability so they will want to sustain ICAP).

Secondly, drafting comments on the paper generally.  Please note that the final section, that proposes the Enron solution, requires substantial redrafting which will be done if the consensus is to propose such a solution.

A final draft will be sent out on the morning of Tuesday 10/16, the paper will be filed Wednesday.

regards
Mike ext. 57634

PS.  i don't want to sway opinion but i thought it may be useful to state my view.  I think that we concentrate on the rationale supporting RTO's and effective spot markets as mechanisms that achieve the goals of ICAP (i.e A spot market is Enrons solution).  Instead of proposing specific ICAP related solutions, we state that if others have different views, these should be debated in a specific FERC forum and any resulting separate iCap proposal if implemented should be interim in nature and minimise spot market distortions....

We plan to have a conference call at 2pm Sunday to discuss progress.  We want to reallocate dollars which have been returned to the pool and ensure we keep the process moving and any contracts redone by the UBS team in preparation for Monday.  David is going to send an email with contact numbers etc for questions people may have with regard to the contracts (apart from the numbers and promotions) as all those questions need to be sent to HR.

Please make sure you contact all of your guys and have an idea of where they are at.

Tammie will contact you all with the dial in number.

The meeting will be in John's office.

Thanks

Louise

I was requested by Prof Webb to participate in an Energy Panel Discussion at UVA and have agreed.  Some of our competitors will be there and this will hopefully further our recruiting efforts.  Please let me know if you have a problem with this.

Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol "ENRNQ."  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC "Pink Sheets."

Can he come over to our trading floor around 11:00 am?   I can give him a
quick tour and then give him a macro overview of the NA energy markets.
Please confirm via e-mail and directly with my asst. (TJ Black at
713-853-5800).

Thanks.

   Russell would like for you to meet with him for an informational
   interview. An in person meeting would be preferable,

   but whatever is available with your schedule is fine.  My understanding
   is that he is not formally looking for a job

   yet, but trying to get a feel for different types of positions available
   within the energy industry. Erik is the son of

   one of Russell's clients and will graduate from school in May.  I will
   try to get more color from Russell and forward it

   to you.

   What do you need from me?   Do you want me to meet with him?  talk to
   him

   on the phone?   go to lunch?    is he looking for a job?    As you can
   see,

   I don't have much information of the objective here.

      Kevin,

      It looks like Tuesday morning will work best for Erik.  I am supposed
   to

      meet with him at 9:00 am Tuesday morning, but

      am flexible if that time works for you.  Just let me know what time
   is

      ideal and I will schedule it with Erik.

Yes - good guy.  I think he is moving with Marcello into their new cross commodity group.  But he's bright, agressive and worth trying to get.

Kevin,

I have worked with this guy at EBS for the past year and think he is a good candidate for the group.  He has worked for Marcello Romano (he has a favorable view of him also).  He traded oil products at Goldman a few years back and is interested in coming to the U.S. from our London office.  

Let me know what you think.  Perhaps Louise can weigh in also if she knows him.  

John

A few more details on this.  This is a 15MW QF on the FPC system.  They are offering 7x24 energy, 3 yrs. beginning 4/1/02.  The facility is near Tallahassee, but on the FPC system.  He said he would guaranty 80% availability off the unit.  The best bid he has on the table currently is $29.  When I run 80% availability on the model, your MID is $29.18 ($31.98 MID for Firm LD--for comparison).

Any interest in this product?

Attached is a draft spreadsheet that captures the budget items reviewed with IT yesterday.

I have tried to correlate our description with their project name.  I have also created a starting budget and proposed budget for your review.  A % allocation row for east, west and cdn allocation has also been created for your review and comments.

The overall IT budget was brought down from 25.4MM to 16.3MM. 

Please review for any final comments as well as you comments on allocations.  Please note that the largest item was power fundamentals (6.2MM) which has bundled in it remote support, VMS support ect, it is IT's overall catch all accounts that require direct support of delivered  systems.

Kevin -

Do you know who in ENE runs a group that manages distressed debt?  A good friend of mine from Bank of America called and had heard we have a group that does this and he wants to ask them to play ball.  Any ideas?

Do you really have someone as capable as Marcello.  This is an outstanding trader who we probably have no chance of getting but could run any desk we have.  Is your SE guy of that quality?

Marcello is coming to Houston tomorrow to interview for a position trading financial gas.  I really think if we have any spare trading slots we should talk to him.  Kevin - what about South East power?

Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

Guys,

I gave Louise  a"plan" which consists of trading list, transmission list, gant chart, org charts and your product descriptions.  I did not include any "strategy" or "volume targets" in the plan - my thought is we have a lot of work to do and we'll get after it.  I told her that the lists are works in process and will be modified or re-formatted since they will become our working tools for getting this stuff done.  Kevin,  I will be in Houston tomorrow if you want to review any of this.  Lists are unlikely to be perfect but they demonstrate that we have spent some time on this and we have a starting point.

Regards,

Chris Calger

The afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion. The pane=
lists were: Jose Degado--CEO American Transmission Company, Michael Dworkin=
--Chair Vermont PSC, Mark Maher--VP Transmission Business Line, Bonneville =
Power Administration, Lara Manz--PSE&G, Masheed Rosenqvist--National Grid, =
Steve Walton--Enron.
General Observations
The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from t=
ime to time.  Commissioner's Breathitt and Massey were the most active in q=
uestioning.  The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initi=
al presentations, moving along the discussion by asking questions.  There w=
as some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management, howev=
er, there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmiss=
ion rights.  There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the R=
TO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market (wh=
ere are problems, how might they be solved, etc.) and that the where possib=
le that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit.  Ther=
e was a good deal of discussion of "least cost planning" and the identifica=
tion of options which are not transmission related.  All agreed there had t=
o be backstop authority to build transmission, however then the challenge i=
s who pays for it, which raises the need for dispute resolution. =20
Opening Statements
Jose Delgado: ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system op=
erator.  They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met.  They =
were formed by divestiture by IOUS, coops and munis and with a $500 million=
 asset base initially. Their current ten year plan will add $1billion of in=
vestment.   Their top priorities are connecting generation and load. =20
Michael Dworkin: Because transmission is a common good, construction affect=
s all parties not just one party.  The environmental and permitting of line=
s requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view.  The ide=
a of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multi-state project=
s, although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been us=
ed by FCC.  State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which=
 must be considered.
Mark Maher: FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when =
considering congestion management.  LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems =
with their multiple use obligations.  RTO West is developing a planning pro=
cess which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in =
the future.  The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process.
Laura Manz: The various aspects of planning are connected.  Pricing (LMP) i=
s the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and re=
sources.   No competitor should have an advantage over another.  The RTO ne=
eds a central planning process but it shouldn't push solutions.  The market=
 should decide on solutions. =20
Masheed Rosenqvist: The morning discussion of congestion management talked =
about hedging against risk.  The planning discussion is not about what we h=
ave now, but about how to avoid future congestion.  The Commission has take=
n conflicting positions in different cases.  The issues that need to be ans=
wered are:  How can merchant transmission be compensated?  Should transmiss=
ion projects be open to RFPs?  Is FERC open to market based pricing for exp=
ansions? =20
Steve Walton:  The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to =
settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that h=
as frozen transmission investment.  The RTO debate has been going on for 5 =
years or more and needs to be settled.  For expansion to go forward, there =
needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party.  Y=
ou are always going to have muddy issues in planning.  For instance if a 13=
8 kV line is all that is needed to day, but future considerations of scare =
right-of-way say a 345 kV line should be built, who pays for the extra cost=
.  In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dis=
pute resolution process, appeal able to FERC, to decide such matters.
Discussion
Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current cong=
estion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose.=
  Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built=
 with the beneficiaries funding.  Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about =
use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say=
 this is the best solution, i.e. least cost planning.  This lead to discuss=
ion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so=
 they can make intelligent decisions. =20
Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was (a) under built and =
needed lots of expansion so don't worry about overbuilding or (b) transmiss=
ion planning should consider all options before construction of new facilit=
ies.  The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the =
process.  Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions.  L=
aura Manz felt that the term "under built" is a secondary effect of not hav=
ing proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties.
Dick O'Neil asked if LMP will work in the West.  Mark Maher said it wouldn'=
t.  Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics, they manage h=
ydro facilities in PJM.  Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure=
 of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought n=
ot to be rejected just intelligently designed.  BPA is looking pricing mode=
l but LMP won't work.  Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch,=
 but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some "twea=
ks" like bilaterals and allow operator self-schedule output levels to permi=
t  river coordination.  Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to max=
imize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis.  PJM has hydro, =
but not 70% as in the Northwest.  Implementation will be different because =
such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro a=
nd base load coal.
In the summation at the end of the panel, four principles were listed:  (1)=
 RTO must provide information, (2) RTO should identify solutions, (3) RTO s=
hould be unbiased and (4) the RTO should be accountable.  The disagreement =
was over the last two points, Michael Dworkin felt that #3 (unbiased) was c=
ritical and that #4 (accountability) was accomplished by having regulators =
involved in governance.  Jose Delgado said and Transco can't be unbiased si=
nce it provides services, although the ISO above it can be, but accountabil=
ity is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake.  This last =
point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the =
tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues.

Kevin:  Rob Benson called me this morning to ask about the process for Permanent Residency (Green Card).  At this time, I have been asked to hold on all new Green Card applications until further notice.

However, we might want to amend Rob's visa status from L1B to L1A, making it easier, faster and cheaper to process the Green Card, hopefully in the near future.

Rob was originally brought into the US in the capacity of Associate and this is why we used the L1B visa and not the L1A at that time.  Now that he is a Director, we should be able to amend his visa to L1A.  (The L1A is usually for Managers or above, or someone managing a function).

Do I have your authority to go ahead with the amendment?  The approximate cost is $1,000.

Thank you
Margaret
