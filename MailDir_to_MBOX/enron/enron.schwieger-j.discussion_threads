Q. I=01,m not currently a Road Runner customer. What is the process?

A. Your address will be checked to verify Road Runner serviceability. If=20

Hey Jim,

While I was out on vacation last week, Patrick unwound some positions that 
brought Westpark onto the radar screen.  Not having my understanding or 
knowledge of this relationship, the credit analyst looking at the trades 
asked the market risk to run a 5-day VAR.  Excluding December, the open 
position (which later was completely unwound) had positive 5-day VAR that 
exceeded the collateral being held, i.e. $1.5MM.  Because Patrick did 
eventually close out his position while deep in the money, their is no credit 
risk on any of his business.  However, combing the volatile nature of this 
price environment (prompt, gas daily being so dramatic), large volumes, and 
one sided nature of trading, we are now uncomfortable with the $300M/Bcf rule.

Until the market calms a bit, what was once quoted as $300M for each Bcf 
open, is now $1MM for each Bcf open.  This collateral to be posted upfront.  
By increasing this multiple, we should easily be able to stay within the 99th 
percentile of probable VAR.

Please communicate this strategy to Patrick and let me know if you would like 
to schedule a meeting to further discuss.

thanks
brant

Jim,

Westpark was declined by our credit group for on-line trading access.  Here 
are there comments:  Credit declined 3/1; weak financials and company is a 
1-man shop.  All OTC trades are heavily collateralized; we will not transfer 
to on-line activity.  The credit contact is Walter Guidroz if you want to 
talk to him, or you may want to let Patrick know that he will be getting a 
rejection letter.  We can give him a long term guest id (read only) if you 
would like.  We don't usually do this, but if a trader requests it and has a 
legitimate business reason, we can do it.  Let me know if you need anything 
else.

Bryan

I just wanted to take a moment to remind you that you have daily access to 
your Enron Corp. 1994 Deferral Plan and/or Enron Expat. Services, Inc. 
Deferral Plan account information by phone or via the Internet.  Year-to-date 
salary, bonus, and other long-term program payments (including restricted 
stock releases) have been posted to your account if you elected for 2001 
deferrals.  Deferrals were invested as specified on the election form you 
completed during 2000 (if applicable).

You may call  (800)316-7526 or visit www.rsweb.com/61045 to access your 
account balance, transaction history, or investment election information.  
This is the same phone number/web site that you use to access 401(k) savings 
account information.  

You will be prompted to provide your Social Security Number and your PIN.   
If you do not know your PIN, you may request for your PIN to be mailed to 
you.  By phone, enter your SSN and any 4 digit number, then press 1 to 
request your PIN.  To request your PIN via the Internet, after entering your 
SSN, check "Lost PIN".

If you have any questions concerning the deferral programs or your account 
history, please call Renee Ratcliff (713-345-5790) or me (713-853-7084).

Hey Jim,

How's it going?  It's that time of year again.  Please don't forget me should 
you have any leftover rodeo tickets.  I will be forever greatful as with all 
the other times.  I see one that I am particularly interested in (Def 
Leppard).  I'd like to get four for that one if you happen to come across 
any.  Sorry to be such a bug already.  I feel bad asking since I'm not part 
of the group anymore.  Well, let me know if you should have any leftovers 
that you just can't seem to get rid of at the last minute.  Thanks bud!  
Sorry to write only when I want something.

-Brenda

There has not been any activity on the rest for a couple of years.

have any residual balances and get with the appropriate individuals to clear 
up ASAP.

In anticipation of re-opening, you have an opportunity to pre-select your new 
locker location.  All active Body Shop members who had a permanent locker at 
the time of the September 1st construction close have been given first 
consideration when selecting their new locker location before December 29th.  
 Priority will be given to member's original locker location (i.e. a member 
who requests their original locker area will be given priority for that 
space).  After this date lockers will be distributed to members on the 
waiting list and to member's with permanent lockers who request a different 
space from their original locker area.   For your convenience, a Body Shop 
enrolment and locker request table will be in the lobby from December 18th 
through January 5th between the hours of 11am - 1:30pm. 



Follow these simple steps to secure your locker location:
Open and review the attached Men's Locker Design template.
Select your 1st, 2nd, and 3rd choice location preference.
Complete the Locker Selection Request Form.  
Complete and Sign the Locker Payroll Deduction Form.
Return all completed forms before December 29th to the Body Shop at EB1355, 
drop off at our offices on EB1372 or at the Body Shop Table in the lobby from 
December 18th through January 5th between the hours of 11am - 1:30pm.

We just got some more information in the mail yesterday on the College
Savings Plan.  We will study it some more, and let you know how good or bad
it sounds.  Some good may be that YOU could deduct the amount you give on
YOUR income tax (there doesn't seem to be a cap on deducting the amount you
give if you make big bucks).  The initial bad I see is the $24/year fee plus
.6% of earnings.  Anyway, we will look it over in more detail.  They do not
restrict you to only go to Nebraska colleges, and you do not have to be a
Nebraska resident to open up an account.   Josh and Jarrod could each have
an account, with annual contributions up to $165,000 (tax deferred), and
when you take the money out, it is taxed at Josh and Jarrods tax rate.

Please remind me/reassure me about the Educational IRA.  It is similar to a
Roth IRA in that taxes are paid (by you in this case)on the money prior to
putting it into the account.  I don't list it anywhere on my income tax
forms until we start taking the money out.  In essence it is as if we are
putting $500 of our own money (taxes already paid) into the account, right?

There is no school again today.  Ice on the roads and more ice and snow to
come later today. I think this is the 5th or 6th day they have missed.  They
have to make it up at the end of the school year.

Mom said your house on the lake is all done being remodeled.  Bet it looks
nice.

Have a great day!

Love,
Linda

Linda and Mark:
I would like you guys to decide what to do and let me know.  Ben and Anna
will more than likely go to Nebraska so it make sense.  We still have to
make the 2001 contribution so if you want me to send it to the Nebraska
fund let me know.

     Love,  Jim

Jim,

This was just passed by the Nebraska legislature, and thought it might be a
better plan than the educational IRA.

Let us know what you think.

Love and Hugs,
Linda

P.S. I worked on the Ameritrade "stuff" (Schedule D) some more.  Hopefully
I
plugged in the right #'s.  I might mail a copy to you just to be sure.  Too
bad we don't have a scanner here at home.

Gentlemen, I was hoping you could take just a few minutes of your time to 
input some information on Jody Crook.

I spoke with Jody recently about the possibility of doing his next rotation 
within Enron Global Markets, specifically in the LNG group.  Jody came across 
as a very energetic guy with the right disposition for the type of deals we 
are currently working on (mostly long term origination type work with a good 
dose of assett based development) and based on that I feel there is a good 
chance we could make him an offer.

Before doing so though, I was hoping you could give me some feedback on 
Jody's performance in your group;  what is he responsible for, what are his 
strengths/ weaknesses etc.  I don't need extreme detail, just enough that I 
can get a feel for what you think I can expect out of him.

I appreciate your help.  E--mail is fine but if you just want to give me a 
call I'm at ext. 56249.

Thank you


Doug Arnell

Jim,
I got a notice from the dentist yesterday that Jarrod has a dental cleaning 
scheduled for February 28 at 4:30.  I have a doctors appointment that day at 
3:30 and cannot take him - can you?  If not, let me know and I'll reschedule 
his appointment.

Also, I am scheduled to have the boys the weekend of April 21-22, and would 
like to switch with you if possible.  Let me know what would work for you.  
Thanks,
Joan

Jim,
David and I wanted to let you know that Phillip has broken his arm over the
weekend and he will be out of sports for a while.  He has an appt with an
orthopedic surgeon on Friday and we should know more after that with regards 
to
exactly how long he has to be in a cast.  Needless to say, Phillip is very
disappointed.  We will keep you posted.

Thanks,

The exposure items I think may cause problems in the Bammel transition are:

All trades, physical and financial, after March 2001 have been reversed.  
There are no open positions past his date on working gas.   However, the 
trades are still out there.  They respresent no P&L since there are no open 
positions.  Is there any way these trades can change be cleared off the books 
so that Risk Management can stop running the book after the transition?  
These trades, buys and sells netting to zero, are for every month through 
April 2007.

The cushion gas expected at the end of March is 60,000 bcf.  If we have to 
pay it back to bring the level up to 65 bcf there will be fuel/compressor 
costs as well as the actual gas costs.  This cost is usually a 1% percent of 
injection volume charge to the book itself.  The total cost would be the 
actual electric compressor expenses which could be a lot higher than 1% of 
the volumes injected.  The more changes or swings in volume on the electric 
compressors the higher the compressor cost.

Royalties and Production costs are usually paid on withdrawal volumes.  I 
believe we will have withdrawn all the gas before the transfer to AEP.  The 
gas is assumed to be withdrawn according to the current withdrawal schedule 
by 3/31/20001.

There may be cost associated ad valorem.  We will have working gas thru 
February and go into cuhion gas in march.  Ad valorem is paid on cushion and 
working gas.  We are usually charges based on the volume of gas as of 
December 31st.  This is a negotiated payment.  Ted Ryan is more able to 
answer these issuesor questions.  The date the inventory levels are assessed 
is not always December.  It can change in negotiations.  Ted Ryan can answer 
if the date for 2001 is firm or not. 

The third party storage contracts we are curently using in bammel are Texas 
General Land Office and Cannon interesst.  Cannon was assigned to Kinder 
Morgan.
We also have Bammel balances in different intercompany ENA contracts  As of 
November 2000 Production ENA contracts had 22,192,745 mmbtu's of working gas 
volumes and 11,891,487 mmbtu as HPLC.  The December production schedule 6 is 
not out yet.  Usually all current activity is scheduled as HPL.  Pma's can 
affect the ENA balances.  These pma's are usually minimal.    Chris Price and 
Rita Wynne can supply the contract numbers for the contracts we have volumes 
under in Bammel.  There are other contracts on file with the railroad 
commission like El Paso, Sempra, etc. according to Irene Flynn.  These 
contract should be terminated.  The balances are zero.  Some of these 
contracts were never used.  Jackie Morgan should terminated these contracts. 
These contracts do not automatically terminate since they are basic 
contracts.  These basic contracts specify the rates and terms in attachments 
to the contract as confirms.  There no confirms with terms other than Texas 
General & Cannon/Kinder Morgan.

The only other issues I can think of is balance sheet items unidentified in 
OA.  There is a large unexplained variance for November production.  This 
balance is usually due to confusion between which deals are financial and 
which are physical and problems due to the regions they are liquidated in.  
Once the unexplained variances are identified, most of variances are 
reclassed and get corrected.  I assume the same thing will happed for 
November production, however, we can not be sure until the process is 
completed.     Dave Baumbach, John Valdes, and Jody Crook are looking at 
these variances and trying to clear up the back page items.

    I thought all you non-Floridians might like to see the new crop
    of bumper stickers floating around Florida these days ...
    from those who put the "DUH" in "Floriduh"!


    FLORIDA: If you think we can't vote, wait till you see us drive.

    FLORIDA: We count more than you do.

    FLORIDA: If you don't like the way we count then take I-95 and
    visit one of  the other 56 states.

    FLORIDA: We've been Gored by the bull of politics and we're
    Bushed.

    FLORIDA: Relax, Retire, Revote.

    FLORIDA: Where your vote counts and counts and counts.

    FLORIDA: This is what you get for taking Elian away from us!

    FLORIDA: We're number one! Wait! Recount!

    Palm Beach County:  If you're nice, we'll let you vote twice.

    Palm Beach County: We put the "duh" in Florida.

    Sign on I-95 : Florida this way 2 miles , no, that way  5 miles,
    no, wait 10...

    Pro-electorate's choice: Abort the pregnant chads.

    We, the people,  have spoken. Now shut up and listen while the
         lawyers tell us what we said.

    FLORIDA: We can't vote, but you should see us handle 15 bingo
    cards!

Dave/John:

Attached is a recommended strategy for addressing the Cushion Gas issue with 
AEP.  Bottom line is:

1. Hedge our obligation now - understand that John has already done this.
2. Begin working with AEP to get their bid on purchasing the Cushion Gas from 
us (at a premium that will cover the cost of the additional 5.5 bcf)
3. Begin working with the banks regarding the cost/potential for Enron to 
re-monetize the Cushion Gas at a higher basis (again to cover the cost of the 
additional 5.5 bcf).  At a minimum, this gives us additional negotiating 
leverage with AEP.
4. Re-classify the 5.5 bcf from PP&E to a long term asset to delay 
recognition of the higher cost.
5. Once we get AEP's bid on purchasing the pad gas - introduce the fact that 
we mistakenly omitted from the balance sheet a 2007 liability to re-inject 
the 5.5 bcf of pad gas.  Offer for Enron to assume this 2007 liability.
6. If necessary we can also look at a higher threshold for the A/S line 
liability, as I think that the risk that additional repairs will be required 
is low.

Any comments/direction is appreciated,
Brian

I will revise the documents to reflect Flagstaff and the items we discussed 
at the meeting previously.  

Kevin's email indicates he wants to remove the language concerning a party 
obligations to refund the costs of the interconnect paid for by that party, 
if the other party is unable to maintain their pressure obligations. 

Does this need to stay or be removed?  If this needs to stay, should someone 
tell Kevin that it will remain in the agreement ?

MidCon has decided to move forward with Flagstaff.  We have until November to 
complete this project.  I suggest that we begin condemnation proceedings now 
against the landowners of the property that we need.  We have been in 
unfruitful discussions with this family up until now.  We need to get the ROW 
for this project moving so Tom can prepare a new cost estimate for the 
facilities.

We want to leave it at Flagstaff.  Also, lets remove the penalty language in
the Facility Agreements.  Since we are both paying for our own facilities, I
don't think it is needed.

Coaches,


I still need to get volunteer information from most of you.   As the
Commissioner for Bleyl and Hancock I am responsible for getting the
volunteer information turned in ASAP from each coach.  Pleas get this
information to me quickly since time is already running short. Thanks.

Hi everyone,

Well I have volunteered to schedule all the volunteers for the NIT
tournament. I drafted Ashley Wagner to help with this task.  I need all the
School Commissioners to contact your coaches and ask them to email me their
3 volunteers asap.  If they do not have email access would you please get
the names and email them to me? Those of you who have the names and have
just been waiting to find out what to do with them, now can unload them on
me.

Ashley Wagner and myself will start calling them (so please include a phone
number!) to see when they would like to work.  The first names we get will
be the first we call so they will get the best choice of fields and times.
So do them a favor and get them in soon!!!

Thanks for your help on this.

I'm comfortable with the language.  I will get it pushed through on this
side.  Let's get it done.

Even though we have changed the reimbursement from 50 / 50 on both
interconnects
to each entity paying 100% of one interconnect I still feel the language
requiring either party to reimburse the other if operational circumstances
constrain the physical intent of the interconnect is still needed.  In this
way
both entities will be aligned in trying to insure both the receipt and
delivery
interconnects function as intended.  Please let me know if you disagree.

MidCon has decided to move forward with Flagstaff.  We have until November to 
complete this project.  I suggest that we begin condemnation proceedings now 
against the landowners of the property that we need.  We have been in 
unfruitful discussions with this family up until now.  We need to get the ROW 
for this project moving so Tom can prepare a new cost estimate for the 
facilities.

We want to leave it at Flagstaff.  Also, lets remove the penalty language in
the Facility Agreements.  Since we are both paying for our own facilities, I
don't think it is needed.

Jim, I can assure you that neither John or myself are trying to attract blame 
or "cover our backsides";  however, I do believe that there is/was a genuine 
breakdown in communication somewhere in the deal team, accounting and the 
desk.  As well, it appears that this is not completely a black and white 
issue and can legitimately attract a number of points of view.  As executives 
of this company, you, Brian, Tim and Tom absolutely were responsible to 
ensure that all aspects of this transaction are managed correctly.  
Nevertheless, I think it is amazing we have not had more problems with this 
divestment given the size, complexity, time and how intertwined it is into 
the overall framework of ENA.

I appreciate your candor and the unselfish maturity to bring to the trading 
floor.

I look forward to working with you as we continue to build our Texas and gas 
business.

Regards
Delainey

Subject: Bammel Storage Cushion Gas Issue.

I'm very disappointed and angry with comments that have been made since the 
HPL Asset Disposition Team realized the impact of what has been communicated 
to them over the last six weeks regarding the level of Bammel cushion gas 
that would be available on March 31, 2001.  The following is designed to set 
the record straight in the spirit of "Facts Are Friendly".  

First of all, it has been communicated multiple times over the last six - 
eight weeks to Patrick Wade and Brian Redmond and brought to the attention of 
Wes Colwell,  Dave Delainey and John Lavorato in the meeting held before year 
end to discuss the unwind cost.  All parties indicated that it was not a 
problem and that everyone was aware of the situation.  Now Im hearing just 
the opposite and in fact insinuations that the Storage Book screwed up by:  
1) originally booking injection and withdrawal assumptions down to 60 BCF.  
2) reversing the April, 2007 5.5 BCF injection assumption on December 31, 
2000. 
 1)  The decision to record injection / withdrawal assumption down to 60 BCF 
was made in 1992 by Kevin Hannon and Steve Smaby.  This was based on
         the fact that we had been down to 60 BCF physically in the several 
years proceeding 1992.  Since 1992 we have been down top 60 BCF twice, 
the          latest  being March, 1996.  Throughout this entire period the 
Accounting Dept was well aware of the Bammel assumptions and the 
physical           capabilities of the facility.  
 2)  The reversing of the Bammel assumptions has nothing to do with 
anything.  When we communicated the unwind cost of $203 million it included 
the         reversal of all assumptions including the April, 2007 injection.  
This was appropriate since we would be down to the 60 BCF physical minimum.  
In         addition we were told to make sure there was no Working Gas left 
in the ground.  If the reversal of the assumption was the problem then it 
could be         reversed, but then the unwind cost would go up.
It has also been suggested to me that I should have continued to follow up 
irregardless of the number of times I communicated the issue.  If I was 
dealing with lower level employee's I would agree, but given the level 
involved I feel this suggestion is totally out of line.  

>From my perspective the only way I had a chance of catching this issue was if 
I had reveiwed all documents including the one specificly addressing the 
cushion gas of 65.5 BCF.   I beleive everyone on this memo was communicated 
to and was aware of the situation.  Perhaps they were involved with other 
issues related to the sell?  I am disappointed in the way everyone is scuring 
around to cover their backside.

These volumes equal to scheduled injections and withdrawals.  The only month 
that had a variance was January 2000.  We charged Texas for injections of

Coaches,

As you can see we are still in need of the volunteers for this years
tournament.  Please respond to me ASAP with the three names choices of your
volunteers.  Thanks,

Louis Martinez


Hi everyone,

Well I have volunteered to schedule all the volunteers for the NIT
tournament. I drafted Ashley Wagner to help with this task.  I need all the
School Commissioners to contact your coaches and ask them to email me their
3 volunteers asap.  If they do not have email access would you please get
the names and email them to me? Those of you who have the names and have
just been waiting to find out what to do with them, now can unload them on
me.

Ashley Wagner and myself will start calling them (so please include a phone
number!) to see when they would like to work.  The first names we get will
be the first we call so they will get the best choice of fields and times.
So do them a favor and get them in soon!!!

Thanks for your help on this.

Welcome Back!
Mom said you weren't feeling so great all week because of your sinus
problems and a sore throat.  NO FUN!!  Hope you're better now.  If you are
at work today, you are probably swamped with things to catch up on.

You make it pretty hard to give you a thank-you.  I write you an e-mail
thanking you for great stuff you've done, and you come back with more stuff
to give us.  :)

Coming to Houston for the 4th of July sounds good to us.  WE APPRECIATE THE
OFFER TO PAY FOR AIRFARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  We had been thinking of
renting a van to drive the whole way.

The tricky thing again this year is figuring out how to get Ben there.  He
has another church event the week of June 25th-July 2nd.  We thought about
having him ride back on the bus to Omaha (so he doesn't miss out on the fun
stuff they do on the way back), arriving Monday the 2nd around noon, and
then we all fly out together on the afternoon of the 2nd or... Mark Anna and
I leave on Friday or Saturday the 28th or 29th, and have Marlyss and Gary
help Ben catch a flight Monday the 2nd or Tuesday the 3rd.  Mark should be
able to take the whole week off.

The other tricky thing in the whole deal has to do with whether Ben will
have to take summer school.  He has been told that if he flunks a class this
semester, he will have to retake it in summer school.  We won't know for
sure if he is going to flunk until the middle or end of May.  If he has to
take summer school, he will not go on the church event or come to Houston
with us because summer school is only offered the first part of June through
July 13th.  If reservations are made for Ben, we would not be able to use
it.  Let me know your thoughts.

I did look up information again about the educational IRA.  According to
page 27 of the 1040 instruction book, you cannot deduct contributions to an
educational IRA (just like you cannot deduct contributions to a Roth).

Mark and I haven't decided anything about the NE fund.

You probably realize this but the kids educational IRA's are not doing well.
Your $1,000 contribution is now down to $843.  I know you say for the long
run we shouldn't worry, but since Ben will graduate in 3 years, I'm
wondering if it is still the best place to be.  Let me know what you think.

Love and Hugs,
Linda

Linda:

Thanks for the note!
have you guys decided about the Nebr. Fund!
Your one previous "e" mail about the Education IRA bothers me.  Im not sure
if I replied to you or not, but you and Mark should be deducting the $1,000
( $500 for Ben & $500 for Anna) on your tax return.  Im not positive about
the deduction but there is something you need to fill out Im sure.  I can
not make the contribution myself because my income is over the limit
allowed.  That is why I deposit cash so it looks like you and Mark have
done it!  If you get a chance look into this for me for your 2000 taxes.

Don't worry about $$$$$$.  Like I told Mom money is not something the
Schieger Family should have to worry about for a long time.  The FORCE has
been good.
You just need to communicate with me!

The boys and I are leaving for Colorado to go skiing this Friday.  We will
be there until Saturday March 17.   Brent & Chad Daniel are going with us
so Josh & Jarrod will have company and I can relax.

I would like you & Mark to start thinking about the fourth of July this
year.  I thought it would be nice to give Donna a break and have everyone
down here this July.
I realize the fourth is on a Wednesday which might take some maneuvering
for Mark.  One idea is to take the whole week off as vacation and you guys
could stay at the lake house the whole week.  It would be like Minnesota
just alot warmer.  There would be a ski boat, two wave runners, fishing
etc.  If you are interested let me know as soon as possible.  I will pay
for the airfare for the four of you so the sooner you decide the more time
the travel agent has to find good deals.

Ya quite bitching about me paying for the airfare.  Get over it!

     Love Ya,   Swig

Just wanted to say thanks for all you do for us.  I think about it a lot, I
just don't tell you enough.

I really appreciate our van, knowing we paid so little for it.

I am very thankful for our windows, siding and roof, and knowing what a
deal
you have given us makes it even better.

It is comforting to know we will have some money for the kids education.

Etc. Etc. Etc.

Love and Hugs,

Linda

Right now we have to assume that we will be withdrawing Nov. 2000 through 
March, 2001 with a goal of emptying the facility down to 60 BCF.  This will 
require the injection of approximately 55 BCF of gas from April 1, 2001 
through October 31, 2001.  Available run time should be no lower than 98%.  
Why would it be greater?
The rest will have to be answered by someone else.

Subject: Estimation of Potential KVSR fuel expense

Hanover Compression has given me a revised fuel consumption number of 7150 
BTU/horsepower-hr for the KVSRs once they have been converted to Clean Burn 
technology.  This compares to the present 7500 BTU/horsepower-hr.  We need to 
come to a consensus on the assumptions that will be used with this figure.  
These assumptions will need to be as follows:

How many hours a year do we really think that these units will run?  I am 
assuming that they will not be running if Bammel is on withdrawal.  Correct 
or not?
How much horsepower will really run?  This will be determined by how much 
market HPL will hope to capture from ANP and possibly Equistar.  It will also 
be affected by the suction pressure of the gas, which is, in turn, determined 
by how much HPL is injecting and pressures at Katy.
Finally, what available run time do we want to assume here?  90%?

I have no preconceived notions of what these assumptions should be; 
therefore, I am soliciting input from each of you.  We need to be in 
agreement before Emma starts her work.  Thank you.

Troy / Jim:

The following are issues or concerns that I think need to be addressed.  If 
its OK I will pass these on as the pop into my head.
 1)  The 2001 Ad Valorem Tax should be allocated at closing based on the 
period of time each entity owns the facilities.  This is important since 
        the 2001 tax owed should be significantly higher (2 to 3 times the 
2000 value) given the higher pricing.
 2)  Houston PipeLine has an Agricultural Exemption on the land out at Bammel 
on the Ad Valorem Tax.  I believe this Exemption has to be renewed 
every         two years.  I would think that Enron would want to retain 
responsibility for renewing this exemption.  Both parties have a vested 
interest since it will         impact  AEP's tax liability over the next 30 
years but Enron wants the facility back with the exemption intact.
 3)  Houston PipeLine also has an agreement with the state of Texas regarding 
Production Tax.  HPL only pays Production Tax on 7.5% of the 
withdrawal         volumes.  I do not think this will be impacted by the sale 
but it might be worth a quick review by the lawyer's.
Ted Ryan can discuss the Ad Valorem Tax issues with you and the last person I 
talked to about the Production Tax issue was Dan Hyvl.

Hope this is what you are looking for in this process.

Paul:

This storage facility does not really excite me!  The pipeline interconnect 
to TXU/Lone Star would be OK for withdrawals/Deliveries but would not be very 
desirable for receipts/Injections.  TXU/Lone Star would have no incentive to 
work with us regarding transportation to and from the facility. 

A notional market value would be around $.60 per MMBtu of capacity.  Under 
the first two cases the capacity could be cycled a maximum of 7 times per 
year and 4.5 times for the third case.   This $.60 has to cover all of the 
following costs:
 1)  Injection Fuel at the stg facility.
 2)  Injection and withdrawal commodity costs charged by the operator.
 3)  All Transportation costs of getting and receiving the gas at liquid 
points.
In summary this is not a storage facility that would be high on my list to 
acquire capacity.  In 2001 I would rather concentrate on facilities that I 
can obtain high deliverability and have multiple interconnects that are 
desirable and have competitive environments.

Jim

As we discussed yesterday, here is the information on the storage asset we 
discussed.

I also cc'd Tom as you asked.

The field is connected to TXU/Lone Star and could be connected to Mitchell's 
expansion from the Bridgeport Plant down to Valero and to NGPL as well.

The field is physically located west of Dallas/Ft Worth.

We are considering taking some capacity in return for providing them with 
base gas, compression and other services.

Please provide me with bids for the following:

Capacity: 1BCF (38,000 Inj/WD)
Capacity: 2 BCF (75,000 Inj/WD)
Capacity: 12 BCF (300,000 Inj/WD)

I call later this afternnon to answer any questions.

Thanks, Schweig

Per your conversation with Pat Dowd, please find attached two versions of the 
performance figures for your accounts.  We ran the return numbers two ways; 
Sheet 1 was calculated by subracting the ending balance from the beginning 
balance, (less deposits and withdrawals) then divided by the beginning 
balance.  Sheet 2 was calculated by dividing the earnings by the total 
investment.  You'll also find the historical performance of the indices that 
you requested at the end of each sheet.

Feel free to modify the sheets to fit your needs - let us know if you require 
any further information.  I will forward you the physical backup (statements, 
etc) to follow.

Happy Thanksgiving!

Subject: Cushion Gas Issues

To all:

Please find a draft of the strategy presentation requested by Dave and John 
at our meeting on Tuesday.  I have also attached an email describing a 
potential tax liability on the Cushion Gas.  Lets discuss these at our 
meeting planned for 1:00 Wednesday.  We can meet in my office 3566.

Jim, the cost/volume numbers in the presentation need some work and the 
accounting treatment may be off as well - can you revise and bring to the 
meeting?

Tim/Tom/Jim, FYI, Comments?  You are welcome to attend or can get updated 
afterwards.

Regards,
Brian

Subject: Re: Taxes on sale of Stored Gas  

All,

The huge tax hit relates to Cushion gas only.  For working gas (non cushion), 
the tax liability is normal course of business (ie Sales Price - Inventory 
Cost).  Due to the age of the cushion gas the TRRC is allowing us to only 
deduct our original basis which was $0.33/mmbtu per our tax records.  There 
is a possiblity of reducing this slighty if the write-up of the cushion gas 
occurred after Dec 1989, but we will have to find documentation of such and I 
do not believe this will provide substantial savings.  For our purposes we 
are looking at being charged interest and penalites on the tax due from $2.90 
- $0.33.  This will be slightly less than the $1.1 million which was 
calculated from the full value of $2.90, but not significantly less.

I return from Chicago tomorrow and should be back in by lunch.  Call if you 
have any questions.

Currently from what I understand the tax hit would be a little over $1million 
and is accruing interest.

Subject: Taxes on sale of Stored Gas

Brian, I'm sure that you are aware of the disappointing result that appears 
to be the outcome of the TXRRC Tax  Audit...I think we need to converse about 
the tax ramifications of the sale of the non-cushion gas to AEP and the 
unwind from the Banks..........If the strict approach currently being 
employed is applied to 1. the unwind (with the conveyance  to LEASECO) and 
also 2. the sale of this non-cushion gas by Leaseco to HPL, IT SEEMS TO ME 
THAT ENRON WILL HAVE A HUGE TAX HIT. Maybe we can slightly change the 
mechanics to avoid this result. Let me have your thoughts. 

regards bng

Subject: Interconnect Reimbursement Language

Even though we have changed the reimbursement from 50 / 50 on both 
interconnects to each entity paying 100% of one interconnect I still feel the 
language requiring either party to reimburse the other if operational 
circumstances constrain the physical intent of the interconnect is still 
needed.  In this way both entities will be aligned in trying to insure both 
the receipt and delivery interconnects function as intended.  Please let me 
know if you disagree.

the cold weather Houston has been experiencing.  Given changes in MidCon's 
system this situation will probably continue to be a challenge throughout the 
winter.  This problem is compounded by the start up of the Nov. - Feb. 
deliveries to MidCon of 83,334 MMBtu/d.  All of our eggs seem to be 
collecting in the Flagstaff Meter Station so its imperative that this station 
be operational ASAP.  Please provide me with an update!

No working gas available to sell to the winning bidder, but we will probably 
have some Cushion Gas that we will have to pay back!

Jim 
Just to clarify, the quesiton is will there be any working gas available for 
sale to the winning bidder as of the end of January.

Jim,
I wanted to clarify that we will still be pulling gas out of the ground in 
Febr & March.  The Stg Book has always recorded hedgable volumes of 56.5 
BCF.   This is the difference between 117.5 BCF and 61 BCF.  The Acctg Books 
have always recorded the working gas as everything above I believe 70 BCF.  
So when David says working gas will be -0- by January 31, 2001 he is correct 
but we will be drawing down on what the Acctg Books have recorded as Cushion 
Gas.

According to the Cost of Inventory Schedule there will be no Working Gas in 
the ground at the end of January.  That is assuming we have actually 
withdrawn what we have booked.

 2.  HPL installs, owns, and operates the Flagstaff Interconnect.
 3.  If the pressures committments are violated in accordance with the terms, 
the violating party pays the others cost incurred at that interconnect.
 4.  Each Party still entitled to 1/2 capacity at each interconnect.

Gentlemen,

Please take a moment to review the attached document that has been sent in
to the coordinator of the CFSA Tournament volunteers.  As you will see we
are still in need of a volunteer list from most of you.  For those of you
who have turned in your list, thank you very much, your prompt attention to
this request is greatly appreciated. I know Spring Break did not help
matters much but I need to get a completed list turned in ASAP. The longer
you wait the less of a chance you will have of getting your choice.
Remember CFSA is operated on a volunteer basis.  This means the organization
will only be as good as the people that volunteer.

Jim,
I wanted to clarify that we will still be pulling gas out of the ground in 
Febr & March.  The Stg Book has always recorded hedgable volumes of 56.5 
BCF.   This is the difference between 117.5 BCF and 61 BCF.  The Acctg Books 
have always recorded the working gas as everything above I believe 70 BCF.  
So when David says working gas will be -0- by January 31, 2001 he is correct 
but we will be drawing down on what the Acctg Books have recorded as Cushion 
Gas.

According to the Cost of Inventory Schedule there will be no Working Gas in 
the ground at the end of January.  That is assuming we have actually 
withdrawn what we have booked.

Dear Monique,

The gas processing plant has been shut down for many years and is in fact 
dismantled.  I would leave off any mention.
There is an active compressor station in fact it was converted to electric 
from gas in 1999.
There is still an active underground storage facility.  Capabilities have 
improved from what you have to the following:
 Storage Capacity: 70 BCF to 115 BCF
 Maximum Injection Capacity: 510,000 Mcf/d
 Maximum Withdrawal Capacity:  1,400,000 Mcf/d
Call 713-853-7705 if you have questions.

Dear Jim, 

We are updating our records on your facilities and would like you to verify

We show a gas processing plant that is shut down. 
We show an active compressor station. 
We show an active underground storage facility.

Jim, an update on unwind costs is as follows since 12/20 (for the value on 
the 19th):

1.  Interest rates decreased thus increasing the book value.  The value 
created by this is approx. $700,000.
2.  New origination of $950,000.

Last time our unwind costs totalled $202 mil and with these changes it is now 
$203.6.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Dave


New Origination

Subject: Bammel Gas Compressor Cost Projection

The attached schedule is my projection of Bammel Injection activity through 
the remainder of 2000.  This is an estimate as of today March 5, and will 
change as the futures curve changes.  The schedule also includes a Fuel 
Percentage Table that I would recommend using in the future to determine the 
fuel percentage to be utilized at different Gas In Place levels.  

It is my understanding that all Electric Compressor Cost will be charged to a 
separate location each month and the Storage Book will credit that location 
with the calculated gas compressor costs on a monthly basis.   Please let me 
know if this is your understanding and if the Fuel Percentage Table 
recommended above is OK with you!
