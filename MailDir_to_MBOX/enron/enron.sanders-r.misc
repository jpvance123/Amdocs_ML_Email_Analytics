I just accepted approx. $250,000.00 settlement from the insurance company to 
cover part of our losses and expenses from the Styrene contamination.  I have 
been assured by the insurance company that this settlement will not hamper 
Enron in going after Baytank for additional funds.

Once I receive the paperwork on the settlement I will forward it on to 
Richard Sanders here at Enron.  The Insurance company has recommended a joint 
lawsuit to try and collect the remaining lost funds.  The insurance company 
will go after Baytank for the $250,000.00 as soon as possible.

We will still have roughly $500,000.00 on the books from last year.

Andrew,

This will confirm our telephone conference of yesterday.  Again, I will be 
your new contact at Enron in the above-referenced case.  You advised that 
Exmar, the disponent owner of the M/V SANTA CLARA, has made a demurrage claim 
against EGLI, who fixed the charter with Exmar, of  approximately $165,000, 
arising out of the loading of a cargo of propane on the ship in March of 
1991.  You also advised that EGLI has a counterclaim for recovery of 
deadfreight in the amount of approximately $150,000.  This matter has 
reportedly been only sporadically active over the many years since the claims 
were made, and is now ready to be set for an arbitration date.

You mentioned that Exmar's attorney had been unresponsive to your suggestion 
that the parties just drop their respective claims.  I understand that you 
feel this may be due to Exmar's attorney, rather than his client.  You 
further mentioned that you have read that some Enron entity is or has in the 
recent past entered into charters with Exmar.

It makes no sense for Enron and Exmar to pursue this matter further, given 
what you have told me.  My plan is to confirm that Enron has in fact a 
business relationship with Exmar that would allow us to go forward with a 
"drop hands" settlement.  If you retained the publication in which you read 
about the recent charters, I would ask that you send it to me immediately.  
Since I don't yet have the file from my clients, please also send me the 
correct spelling of Exmar's name at your earliest convenience.

By copy of this e-mail, I am asking everyone who I can think of whether they 
know if any Enron entity has (or has had in the recent past) a ship under 
charter to Exmar.  If one of you can suggest other names I might check, 
please let me know.  I would like to put this old dog out of its misery 
before year end if it is humanly possible to do so.

Britt

Britt

I would summarise the main facts/status of this matter as follows:

(1)  Enron voyage chartered "SANTA CLARA" from Exmar N.V. by a C/P dated 
5.2.91
to carry cargo of 4,200 mt 5% more or less at owner's option of propane, from
Houston to Dunkirk.  Under the Charterparty Enron had the option to load cargo
either fully refrigerated or ambient or chilled.

(2)  On 26th February 1991 the Master advised Enron that the maximum quantity
that the cargo could load at ambient temperature was 3,760 mt having regard to
the vessel's pressure settings and the USCG and IMO Rules and Regulations. The
Master was in fact absolutely correct but Exmar tried to make out that the
vessel could load the full charterparty quantity.

(3)  It is our case that in order to load more than 3,760 mt (the cargo was
loaded at ambient temperature) Exmar refrigerated the cargo as it came on 
board
to reduce the volume.  This caused the loading to be excessively slow.  We say
this method of loading was actually illegal.  It was only by loading illegally
in this way that Exmar could load more than 3760 mt at the required pressure
setting.  We also say it was an express term of the charterparty that the 
entire
contractual cargo could be loaded within the contractual lay time.   The 
vessel
also had to raise the temperature and discharge causing further delays.

(4) There was great commerical pressure on Enron at the time.  The market for
propane was falling rapidly in March 1991 (the end of the Northern European
winter) and Enron had arranged the on sale of a minimum quantity of 3,990 mt 
on
CIF terms based on an expected loading of 1st-7th March 1991.  Enron were
extremely concerned that this would lead purchasers Vitol  to repudiate the 
sale
contract leading to a very substantial trading loss (Vitol did try to 
repudiate
the sale contract due to the loading delays and this developed into a very 
major
trading dispute with Vitol which we eventually won in the House of Lords).

(5)  Exmar made out that slow loading was due to low back pressure in his
Enterprise loading lines.  We believe this is wrong but at this distance in 
time
it is difficult to get clear evidence.

(6)  In the circumstances, on 7th March 1991to try and speed up loading Enron
agreed that the minimum cargo of 3,760 mt should be loaded and agreed to pay
Exmar deadfreight on the balance in the sum of US$22,714.84.

(7)  Furthermore, because of the slow loading of the vessel the Enterprise
Terminal had to throw "SANTA CLARA" off berth.  This would have caused a very
substantial delay and might have justified Vitol in throwing  over the sales
contract.  In the circumstances Enron negotiated an agreement with another
vessel ("DONAU") to permit "SANTA CLARA" to be loaded ahead of "DONAU".  The 
sum
paid to "DONAU" amounted to US$153,472.15.    We believe the "DONAU" was also
operated by Exmar.

(8) Accordingly, Enron deny liability for demurrage for the extended loading
which Exmar have claimed in the sum of US$165,652.78 and Enron have
counterclaimed a total of US$176,186.99 (i.e. the deadfreight and "DONAU"
payments).

Exmar are represented by London Solicitors, Lawrence Graham where the matter 
is
being handled by Mike Lax and his assistant Stuart Dench.

Lawrence Graham have always sought to charactercise this claim as a
straightforward demurrage dispute and suggest that we have invented the
technical arguments after the event.  However, we consider there is merit in 
our
case and that if the arbitrators properly understand the expert evidence we 
have
reasonable prospects of successfully defending the demurrage claim and
establishing the counterclaim.  There is of course however an inevitable
litigation risk in pursuing the matter to an arbitration and we have, to some
extent, been inconvenienced by the loss of our original expert, Mr Ivor 
Jorstad,
who sadly passed away earlier this year.   Also some costs will be 
irrecoverable
(if we win approximately two thirds of our costs should be recoverable).

If you have any further queries, please do not hesitate to ring me and I would
of course be pleased to speak to Wayne Perry when he is in London if he needs
any further information to assist in negotiations.

Best Regards.


Andrew Bicknell

Yes,  it will cover former officers.  The officer has two routes of 
protection.   First he has the Enron Corporate indemnity that will pay for 
his defence and any judgements according to the indemnity agreement (between 
him and Enron) He needs to see the indemnity agreement given him when he 
became an officer.   The insurance policy will reimburse Enron for the 
defence and judgements made against the officer paid under the indemnity  .  
To recap the officer should be provided a copy of the Corporate Indemnity and 
a summary page of the D&O policy.  

If it were me I would be very comfortable with an Enron Indemnity in my hands 
and the D&O insurance  as back up.     The indemnity is very broad.  There 
may even be things that the Corporation has agreed to pay for that the D&O 
policy does not.  

Since I do not know the nature of the allegations - the protection afforded 
the officer is subject to the terms of the indemniy and the D&O policy.  
Criminal acts are excluded

Does this help?

Earline, does this apply to former officers for acts taken during their 
employment here at Enron?  Do we have a problem in giving a former officer a 
copy of either your summary of the relevant provisions of the policy itself 
to alleviate any concerns he may have about cooperating in litigation based 
on actions that occurred during his employment?  

There is high interest in getting this resolved asap.

Thank you!

The D&O policy is designed to respond to claims alleging wrongful acts of the 
directors and officers.  "Wrongful acts:, as defined in the policy include 
actual or alleged:

 Breach of Duty
 Neglect
 Error
 Misstatement
 Misleading Statement
 Omission

of a director or officer while acting individually or collectively in their 
capacity as a director or officer or claimed against them solely by reason of

Any of the above could potentially support a claim of negligence but the 
legal requirements to prove negligence, i.e., duty, breach of duty, cause, 
proximate cause and damages would have to be met.  

Claims against directors and officers which could relate to negligence 
include:
 Negligent Misrepresentation
 Corporate Mismanagement
 Breach of Fiduciary Duty
 Waste of Corporate Assets
 Negligence Per Se from violation of statute or
  regulation

These are as you know general comments.  Claims and coverage therefore must 
be considered in light of the facts at hand as they relate to the terms and 
conditions of the entire insurance policy.

We are pleased to announce organizational changes to the Enron South America 
legal department in response to the recent reorganization and realignment of 
the principal Enron Wholesale Services business units operating in the 
region, Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets. 

Randy Young, currently General Counsel of ESA, will be assuming new 
responsibilities within Enron.  John Novak will become General Counsel of 
ESA, reporting to Mark Haedicke.  The ESA legal department will be 
responsible for supporting all Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets 
businesses in the region.  Additional legal resources, coordinated by Lance 
Schuler, will be provided from EWS Legal in Houston to support ESA's 
wholesale activities.  John will also work closely with Bruce Lundstrom, 
General Counsel of EGA, to coordinate legal support with respect to the EGA 
businesses in the region.  An organizational chart describing the new 
structure is attached.

This new structure will enable us to continue to provide quality legal 
support across business lines within South America while improving 
coordination and providing additional support from Houston for Enron's 
existing operating businesses, as well as the new business development 
initiatives under way in the region.

 Thanks for agreeing to help us preserve electronic communications and audio

you need anything from me.
 Thanks again for jumping on this so quickly. Happy holidays.

Richard

Following our meeting I have been discussing the voice recording requirements 
with other members of the project team, and I need to correct one piece of 
information I supplied to you. 

Regarding the recording of internal calls, it is possible to not record calls 
made on the Lucent digital phones internally, but ALL calls made on turrets 
(the phones the traders use) would have to be recorded, whether internal or 
external. This is due to the way in which the voice recording system must be 
connected to the turret system. Therefore, could you assume when considering 
what the corporate requirements are that we cannot exclude internal calls. 

My apologies for this mistake, we are going to investigate the development of 
a solution to this problem with the vendors under consideration. I will keep 
you in touch with all progress that is made. 

Many thanks for your time this morning. 

Regards

Stuart Fieldhouse

Dave -

I'll get with Kevin, Mike, and Bob for consensus, but, first my two cents 
worth is that this doesn't make sense from a purely commercial standpoint.  
It only makes sense if legal believes it is necessary.

I've reviewed the proposal, and technically have no problems with it.  
Commercially, however, I have some problems.  First, a few facts:

1.  The permit currently allows for over 1000 hours per year.
2.  A reduction to 9 ppm would allow for an increase to approx 3000 hours per 
year.
3.  Best case heat rate is 12,300, which is the highest heat rate of all the 
peakers.  Extra run hours would be more valuable at one of the other TVA 
plants (with a lower HR).  If New Albany were a good candidate for combined 
cycle, then the extra run hours would be more valuable, but as a simple 
cycle, it's difficult to envision needing more than 1000 hours.
4.  Though certainly not a representative year, this year, we ran approx 225 
hours at New Albany.
5.  In 1999, we ran approximately 450 hours at New Albany.  With the loss of 
control area status (i.e. parking privileges), I would expect this to 
increase in a typical year, but still not significantly above 1000 hours.
6.  Any increase in run hours would not be automatic (though probable), since 
a permit change would be required.
7.  This proposal would also clean up some other technical issues (flame 
scanners, etc); however, we have other proposals from PSM to clean these up 
for approx $100k.
8.  I leave it up to Kevin and Rogers to value their run hours, but my view 
is that it is of minimal value, and certainly not worth the $7.8MM in the 
proposal.  I'm not as familiar with the Doyle contract, so I've not analyzed 
for the $3.9MM for Doyle.

Bottom line: I recommend going forward only if driven by legal concerns.  
Again, I'll get back to you after I've talked to Kevin, Mike and Bob.

Mitch

Subject: Power Systems

Guys, Power Systems has given me a proposal to replace the New Albany and 
Doyle 7B burners.  This could possibly have two benefits:
 a) elimination of the possibly tainted equipment given current patent issues 
they are having with GE and
 b) apparently the newer technology significantly reduces the Nox emission 
correlating into increased operating hours.

I need two things to determine if we want to move forward:
 a) Mark we need to be bullet proof on the patent (or lack thereof) issues on 
the new equipment and that it would protect us from further exposure and
 b) Mitch, Kevin, Mike and Bob, I need your technical and commercial opinions 
on the merits of this proposal (ie) do you as a team support this proposal?

I believe the timing on this is rather short. Please get back to me at your 
earliest convenience. I will forward a copy of the proposal to each of you.

Regards
Delainey

Lisa - The attached schedule calculates interest on overdue interest at the 
9.9% rate.  This is fine except that I do not know if we are able to charge 
interest on overdue interest.  That is Richard Sanders call - Richard, please 
let us know.  If we can charge interest on interest, this schedule is fine.  
Otherwise, we will have to recalculate using simple interest.

John-

Attached is the schedule that we had at Monday's meeting which has been 
updated through 10/31/00.   After looking more closely at the schedule and 
the way it is calculating interest, it appears that interest is being 
compounded.  The estimate that we had used in Monday's meeting was simple 
interest for one year calculated on the sum of $1,061,300.90 and $264,452.89 
(October 1999 values) which equated to roughly $131,246.65.  However,  based 
on the schedule's calculation, I believe the total interest and principal due 
is $1,171,585.67.  Please look over this schedule and see if you agree with 
my thinking.

Thank you,
Lisa

		 Subject: Enron-Vitro Amparo



Attached please find an electronic file containing a memorandum to file I
prepared after reviewing materials provided me by Peggy Banczak and Rogelio
Lopez-Velarde and following a meeting I had in Washington, D.C. on Monday of
this week with Peggy, Rogelio and Lic. Jorge Canals, an Amparo specialist
who has been representing Enron's interests in the Amparo proceedings.

As Joe Dilg indicated to you we are not Mexican lawyers and therefore cannot
give an opinion on the likelihood that the Mexican Appeals Court will uphold
the dismissal of the Enron-Vitro Amparo entered by the District
Administrative Court.  Nonetheless, I thought Lics. Lopez-Velade and Canals
had a very good understanding of the matter and well-reasoned views
concerning the likelihood that the dismissal would be overturned on appeal.
As indicated in my memorandum they consider the most likely outcome of the
appeal will be confirmation by the Appeals Court of the dismissal entered at
the trial court level.  I have known Lic. Lopez-Velarde for many years and
consider him a competent thoughtful lawyer.  I met Lic. Canals for the first
time Monday and was favorably impressed by him.  He comes highly recommended
by Lic. Lopez-Velarde.

The plaintiff in this matter has brought five other almost identical Amparo
suits against various energy permit holders.  Four of those suits have been
dismissed and their dismissals upheld on appeal.  Dismissals have also been
entered by District Administrative Courts in the Enron-Vitro Amparo and the
one other Amparo proceeding brought by plaintiff of which Mexican counsel is
aware.  Appeals of both those dismissals are pending.  Because of the
workings of the Mexican judicial system, the earlier Appeals Courts
decisions upholding the dismissals entered by District Administrative Courts
of the other four Amparo proceedings brought by the same entity that is the
plaintiff in the Enron-Vitro Amparo proceeding have no stare decisis effect,
but they do have persuasive value.

I am providing your assistant a copy of this message in the event you do not
have access to your E-mail.  Thank you for the opportunity to work on this
matter with Peggy and your Mexican counsel.  If you wish to discuss any
aspect of it with me, my direct line is 713-758-2518.

Attached please find an electronic copy of a memorandum that I prepared this 
week in connection with the claim by International Gas Limited ("IGL") 
against Enron Exploration Company ("EEC").  The claim appears to relate to 
the recent execution of an upstream gas development "Term Sheet" in 
connection with Project Dolphin, and certain rights IGL believes it has to 
participate in the benefits of such Term Sheet pursuant to a May 18, 1994 
Agreement that was executed between IGL and EEC in connection with Enron's 
earlier Qatar LNG Project.

I understand from discussions the other day with Bob Williams and Don 
Wendland of EOG Resources Inc. ("EOG") that EOG will in all likelihood ask 
Pettman Smith (IGL's counsel in London) for an extension of the requested 
April 16 response date.

If you have any questions or comments on this memorandum, or if I can be of 
further assistance in connection with this claim, please do not hesitate to 
call on me.

Kind regards,
Dan

A significant number of our merchant investments are owned in whole or in 
part through various structured finance vehicles.  Amendments, 
restructurings, dispositions, follow-on investments and other significant 
transactions related to those assets may be prohibited or may require 
internal or external consents.  As the commercial teams may not always be 
familiar with these vehicles or the special considerations that may apply to 
these vehicles, you may want to confirm with the attorney/legal assistant 
that is most familiar with the particular vehicle that (i) the appropriate 
people are "in the loop" with what you are doing with the asset, and (ii) 
that there won't be any unpleasant surprises (like a required consent that 
has not been obtained) five minutes before you are supposed to close whatever 
transaction you are working on.

The contacts for the most active vehicles are:  

JEDI - Jordan Mintz
JEDI II -- Joel Ephross, Shirley Hudler
Raptor and Trutta -- Joel Ephross, Lisa Mellencamp, Mary Cook
Merlin -- Anne Koehler 
Rawhide -- Mary Heinitz, Brenda Funk
Hawaii -- Gareth Bahlmann

In addition, please make sure that Shirley Hudler is aware of any significant 
pending transaction involving a JEDI II asset.  With respect to new deals, I 
understand that the JEDI II commitment period has been extended to June 30, 
2001, and that as a result ENA will still have an obligation to place 
"qualified investments" in JEDI II.  While EGF will have a good handle on the 
funding source for your deal, in the early stages the commercial team is not 
always aware that JEDI II is still out there.  Again, if you have any 
questions, please contact Shirley Hudler.

Richard

Regarding your friends who have the working interest in the Bowen #1 and #2 
wells in Panola County, I've had the gas contracts system checked and  
Houston Pipe Line Company does not purchase gas from Hydrocarbon Lease 
Management in that county.  The only county in which HPL purchases gas from 
HLM is a well in Matagorda County.  There are no records of gas purchases 
from any well called Bowen #1 or Bowen #2.   If they have well meter numbers, 
we can run a check that way but it doesn't look like HPL is the gas purchaser.

To All:

Recently, Mark asked me to focus efforts on putting together a technology 
plan for the Legal Department.  Attached for your information is a draft of 
the proposed plan.

As you will see, the central goal of the plan is to enhance our position as 
essential members of the business team by providing - through the 
implementation of available technology tools  - efficient means of enabling 
our clients to meet their business objectives.  The plan attempts to meet 
this overall goal through three different, but related phases, each of which 
can be implemented independently.  Timing of implementation and dedication of 
resources have not been formally addressed as the plan is only in its infant 
stages; however, it is Mark's goal to rapidly move forward with certain 
portions of the plan.

It is my understanding that a meeting will be scheduled for next week some 
time to review and discuss the proposed plan.  Prior to that meeting, if any 
of you should have any comments, questions or ideas, please do not hesitate 
to let me know your thoughts.

 As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More 
comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

Richard, we have several form contracts being developed and used in EBS that 
include arbitration provisions.  We thought it might be useful to get your 
thoughts on our current forms to make sure we are consistent with up to date 
arbitration provisions.  Attached are three of our forms for your review.  
Please note that the Professional Services Agreement is a standard consulting 
agreement that we typically use with service providers.  Please call me with 
any questions or comments.

Have you heard of something called "Track changes"?  It's a WORD feature that 
is used -- a lot -- for redlining drafts.  I see it used all the time on 
documents that I receive from 3rd parties and I use it myself.  It has become 
popular because other tools, like CompareWrite and similar software, are not 
compatible w/ more recent versions of WordPerfect and WORD, so changes are 
often missed in marked drafts.  
I learned during a recent visit at my old law firm that that they've 
forbidden use of "Track Changes" and are advising their clients to do the 
same b/c the past changes never go away and can be retrieved forever by 
someone who knows anything about word processing technology.  Which makes for 
interesting results in document discovery..... among other things.  Just 
thought I'd pass this along.

Janice

Britt

Please find below the answers to your queries re the AES shipment. Please do 
not hesitate to contact Harry or I if you need further information. David 
Minns (our in-house counsel) is actually on vacation until 2nd January 2001 
and is not on email during this time. You may also be interested to know that 
we understand Glencore (a fellow Australian coal trading company) has 
received a similar subpoena re trading with AES during this period. 

Enron Coal Asia Pacific Pty Ltd (ECAP) was the counterparty to this deal. 
ECAP sold to AES approx 60 000 metric tonnes of coal +/-10% as per the  
contract signed 7th September. (The effective date of the agreement was 10 
August 2000). The actually delivery amount was 54 152.35 metric tonnes a the 
cargo was loaded 3rd October 2000. ECAP is incorporated in Australia. 
The deal was negotiated by our Harry Papadopoulos and the contract signed 
here in Sydney by myself, Heidi Mason under delegated authority from  Stuart 
Staley. (My delegated authority is based on Stu's prior approval which in 
this case was received via email on 6th September 2000)
We have a copy of the contract here in Sydney, but as the coal was bought 
under LC and such LC was issued out of London, all shipping   documentation 
for this load was forwarded to London to the attention of Claire Veijou and 
Cornelia Luptowitsch. London office also issued the invoice  to AES on behalf 
of ECAP and this was done by Rebecca Millerchip or Maya Beyhem. 

Also, for your information, Harrry has prior travel plans that put him in 
China on the date of the hearing. While these could be changed, it would be 
less than desirable. Will it be necessary for the trader to be the Enron rep 
who appears on behalf of the company or could it ideally be someone from 
Houston (or London if needs be) simply because this is a long way to go for 
one appearance. John Bowman has resigned from Enron since the time this deal 
was done and therefore we have not advised him of this action. 

With thanks

Heidi Mason

		 Subject: PT Kaltim Rima Coal v. AES Barbers Point/Third-party subpoena on 
Enron Coal Company

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL:  ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION, ATTORNEY WORK 
PRODUCT--URGENT

Harry, Heidi and David,

 The above-referenced lawsuit is filed in the Southern District of New York 
by PT Kaltim Rima Coal, who allegedly had a long-term coal purchase agreement 
with AES Barbers Point, for delivery to AES in Hawaii.  In brief, PT contends 
that AES breached that agreement through the use of a bogus force majeure 
letter, in order to allow AES to purchase coal from some Enron entity at a 
cheaper spot market price in September or October of this year.

 PT's attorneys, Lord, Bissell & Brook out of Chicago, have served us with a 
subpoena on Enron Coal Company.  How they decided that Enron Coal Company was 
the correct entity is not something I yet know.   I have been advised that 
Enron Coal Company is a long-dormant subsidiary of Enron Property.  Although 
using Enron Coal Company's name throughout, the subpoena also references 
Harry, Riaz Rizvi, Allen Childress, Stuart Staley and/or John Bowman.  I 
understand that we probably did do a deal (maybe more than one) with AES, but 
need to be corrected if I am wrong.

 The subpoena requests that a corporate representative for Enron Coal Company 
appear with documents on January 8 in Houston to be deposed about the deal 
with AES.

 I would like to respond tomorrow, by telefax, to PT's attorneys and advise 
that Enron Coal Company is the wrong company.  If all I do is stall them, 
however, they can yank the information from us the hard way (assuming that we 
did do the deal in question) and eventually get what they want.  The suit is 
for about $4,000,000, so it is worth the while of PT's attorneys to pursue 
this subpoena.  Accordingly, I need one of you to tell me as soon as possible 
whether 

 (a) we did such a deal with AES during the relevant time frame, and if so, 
the exact name of the Enron entity on the deal;

 (b) who the trader on the deal was; and,

 (c) who has the documents regarding the deal.

Although I have briefly described the information I need, I also need to get 
the name of the right person to telefax the subpoena to for review, to see 
how broad the scope of the request for documents/witnesses really is. 

I would greatly appreciate this preliminary information by the close of 
business tomorrow, Thursday, in London/Australia.  I apologize for the 
extremely short time frame.  I was only given this subpoena last Friday, and 
have spent the days since chasing people down.  Please don't shoot the 
messenger. 

Britt

Richard, could you provide me with some information on where we are with the 
retention policy?  My last understanding from you was you were going to work 
on the wording a bit and then get back with me.  As you can see below we are 
at risk from a legal perspective on these cases until we get this policy in 
place.

Hello,

Here is the consolidated list as it stands tonight (See tab "Bankruptcies").  We have not received the updated EES schedule, so some of the EES information may be outdated.  Also, it is not updated for PG&E.  Please review and let me know if you have more current information on any of these bankruptcies and/or if they have been resolved.  In addition, please check for completeness.

Thanks,

Sharon Sullo

Becky,

I have not added all the bankruptcies from your database download because you mentioned that many are probably resolved.  Will you give me a call on Friday to talk about the best way to determine whether these old ones have been resolved?

Thanks again,

Sharon

Gentlemen, as you are likely aware, PSM has discovered certain fundamental 
flaws with the FT4A9 engine that formed part of the PG&E mobile pac which ENA 
purchased from PG&E as part of the Advanced Mobile Power Systems project.  As 
you will recall, PG&E had difficulty starting the unit, apparently as a 
result of a faulty gearbox in the original FT4A11 engine, and therefore we 
agreed to swap out the A11 engine and replace it with the A9 engine.  It was 
apparently represented to PSM by PG&E that the replacement A9 engine had been 
completely overhauled.  PSM's testing and discussions with the shop that was 
to have performed the overhaul, both of which occurred subsequent to closing, 
have confirmed that the A9 was not overhauled but was simply serviced in 
order to allow it to start.

PSM prepared a letter to send to PG&E demanding that the faulty A9 engine be 
replaced with the original A11 engine.  I have reviewed that letter and 
revised it substantially.  I enclose a copy of that letter as revised by me 
for your review and comment.  

Also, given that PSM was acting on ENA's behalf in performing the due 
diligence on the PG&E unit and given that ENA relied on PSM's due diligence 
in acquiring the PG&E unit, I have prepared an additional cover letter to 
PSM.  I attach a copy of that cover letter for your review as well, which 
letter is fairly aggressive in its current form.  It clearly identifies both 
that (i) my comments on the PG&E letter are made only to protect and preserve 
ENA's rights and interests and do not represent legal or other advice to PSM 
regarding their position and may not be relied upon by PSM as such and (ii) 
that we are preserving all of ENA's rights and causes of action that ENA may 
have against PSM with respect to these matters.  It seems to me that, if the 
engine is in fact in such poor condition, PSM should have discovered that 
prior to our closing the deal.  I understand the PSM may have performed 
boroscope testing on the original A11 engine but did not, for whatever 
reason, perform the same test on the A9 prior to our closing the deal with 
PG&E.  In any event, I realize that we have other issues to consider in our 
approach to this, such as the finalization of the joint venture, under which 
we have around $8 million at risk currently, and also that Principal 
Investing is negotiating an equity position in PSM, so I will leave it up to 
the commercial people as to how agressive we want to be.  Regardless, even if 
we remove the last paragraph of the cover letter, I think that the point made 
in the second paragraph regarding legal advice needs to remain.

Thanks

Greg

Attached is an email from Rogelio Lopez Velarde summarizing the current 
status of the Amparo proceeding related to the Vitro project.  The attached 
analysis clearly differs from the information provided by the Lopez Velarde 
firm at the end of December when they indicated the Amparo proceeding should 
be dismissed by the end of January.

As I believe you are aware, the dismissal with prejudice of the Amparo 
proceeding is a condition precedent to first disubursement under the Vitro 
Loan Agreement.  Although there are still many other conditions that must be 
satisfied before first disbursement can occur, we do not anticipate that six 
weeks will pass before such conditions have been satisfied. 

Therefore, I contacted the inhouse attorney for the lender, the 
Inter-American Development Bank, to discuss the status of the Amparo 
proceeding with him.  At my urging, he has agreed that the Inter-American 
Development Bank will waive the dismissal of the Amparo proceeding as a 
condition to first disbursement and will, instead, require that the 
proceeding be dismissed prior to second disbursement.  I have been informed 
that second disbursement will not occur until at least a month subsequent to 
first disbursement.  In such case, it is anticipated that the waiver of this 
condition to first disbursement will provide sufficient time for the docket 
to be cleared and for the Amparo proceeding to be dismissed prior to second 
disbursement.

The project company will be required to request in writing that the 
Inter-American Development Bank waive this condition precedent and such 
written request will be prepared after a review to determine whether other 
waivers may be requested but in sufficient time for the Inter-American 
Development Bank to process the request through their internal channels prior 
to the date of first disbursement.

Should you have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to contact 
me.

Dear Peggy:
?
Last Friday Jorge Canals and I met with the clerk of the First  Circuit Court 
of Appeals for Mexico City to discuss the appeal filed by the  petitioner, 
Consorcio Desarrollo Econ?mico Mexicano, S.A. de C.V.?This  clerk is in 
charge of?preparing the resolution for the judge that will be  presenting the 
case before the other two judges that compose the?court of  appeals.
?
The purpose of this first meeting was to deliver copies of all  of the other 
cases that have been dismissed, and to deliver a Memorandum of Law  that we 
prepared for him.
?
As you know, it is important that the court of appeals  becomes?aware about 
the fact that the same petitioner has filed 6  almost-identical Amparo 
complaints, and that all of them have been dismissed  with prejudice (there 
is only one pending an appeal). This is relevant because  in all of these 
cases the courts have dismissed the complaints based on the same  grounds: 
lack of standing, and therefore, such cases were never  published.
?
As we have monitored, the clerk confirmed to us that our case  is number 25 
in the docket. Unfortunately, and since the docket order cannot be  changed, 
the clerk believes that the case may be resolved in about 6  weeks.
?
As discussed before, we are planning to meet with the sitting  judge 
in-chambers next week, along with the General Counsel of the Energy  
Regulatory Commission, to see what we can do to expedite the resolution of 
the  case, and more importantly, to make sure that the complaint is 
conclusively  dismissed with prejudice, as required under the financing  
agreements.
?
Very truly yours,
?

Subject: In re Enron Petrochemicals, Inc. Claim Against Underwriters

 
PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL:  ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION, ATTORNEY 
WORK-PRODUCT

Richard,

This will acknowledge receipt of and thank you for the above-referenced new 
matter, which you and I first spoke about February 15.  I understand that 
Enron Petrochemicals, Inc. has made a claim against Underwriters for over 
$900,000 as the result of the contamination of a load of styrene monomer that 
was discovered on or about November 4, 1999 in a tank facility located in 
Texas.  

You asked me initially to investigate Underwriters' claim that they may have 
been prejudiced by Enron's failure to either obtain a time bar from or sue 
Baytank, which owns the tank at issue, within one year from the date of the 
incident.  You will recall that I thought little of that defense, for the 
following reasons:

1.  The general Texas statute of limitations for breach of contract is four 
years, and for torts, two years.

2.  By statute, Texas does not permit parties to contract to shorten 
limitations periods to less than two years.

3.  The only party with whom I can see that Enron has a contract is Philchem, 
the lessor of the tank ("the Marketing Agreement").  The Marketing Agreement, 
which specifically applies Texas law, makes no attempt to shorten any 
limitations period as far as I can tell.

4.  There does exist a contract between Philchem and Baytank (the 
"Terminalling Agreement").  The Terminaling Agreement, which also 
specifically applies Texas, does require, under section 12.4 on page 6, that 
the parties submit to mandatory arbitration with the following language:  
"Within one year of a dispute arising under this AGREEMENT, a party desiring 
to arbitrate any issue arising hereunder, shall serve written notice of 
intent to arbitrate upon all other parties to this AGREEMENT."  However, 
Enron is not a party to the contract.  Enron and Philchem are reportedly 
corporately unrelated.  Philchem is reportedly not an insured.  Further, the 
terms "dispute" is undefined.  It is certainly arguable that no "dispute" 
would arise in this circumstance until Enron obtained a recovery from 
Philchem.  

I caution that I have not yet spoken to any representative of Underwriters 
about this point.  Also, if anyone sees any arguments for Underwriters' 
position that I have missed, let me know.

You further asked me to evaluate Underwriters' last offer of approximately 
$250,000, and provide you with my view of whether it is reasonable in light 
of the facts and circumstances of our claim. I will have my assistant, Lee, 
arrange a meeting next week with me, Becky Zikes, my legal assistant, Steve, 
and whoever helped Steve put together the spreadsheet on the numbers that you 
sent to me.  

Also, by copy of this e-mail, I am asking Jim if he could send me a copy of 
the applicable policy.

As always, we greatly appreciate the kind referral.

Britt

Steve this is a classic example why  we have to push and push for progress 
and results.
There is no explicable reason why it can have taken this company so long to 
come up with this conclusion/report.
The discrepancies are very large and not having seen our claim I cannot judge.
The only way you are going to make progress is to get a meeting organised  
immediately and as Ted says go over it point by point. A $900,000 claim 
reduced to $ 150,000 is a serious issue .
>From what I can gather from Ted Rosen's note is that  Baytank appear to admit 
to some form of liability/responsibility on the off spec which  I suppose is 
some progress.
I'm copying Graham on this now because he has plenty of experience in Europe 
with these claims .
This must be  sorted out and treated as high priority.
Call me to discuss
Thanks

Stuart

Subject: Re: Cargo/Storage Claim - Styrene at Baytank  

I guess that we all expected such a reply from the Insurance company.  
Apparently we need to have a meeting to discuss the letter that I just 
received because I am very curious where all these numbers and information 
have come from.

1) What does a contract with Enron and  Philchem have to do with a cargo 
claim?  The product in the tank was owned by Enron and only Enron.  

2) On November 5th we discovered that the product was off-spec.  The 
beginning inventory that day was approx. 6.6mm pounds.  Where does 2mm pounds 
come from?

3) Baytank would not admit to a problem with the tank in which Enron is bound 
by contract.  Enron, under contract, is still obligated to pay costs 
assoiated with the tank.  In order for the tank to be used, it must be 
cleaned since it is considered off-spec.  Enron had nothing to do with the 
tank going off-spec and should be compensated for any and all out of costs 
and expenses incurred while the tank was considered off-spec.  

4) The tank agreement stipulates that a minimum of 3,104 mtons will be paid 
every month for thru-put no matter how much volume goes thru the tank.  
Again, Enron is bound by a contract and is still responsible for these costs 
until Baytank is proven at fault.

Richard,

Marcus told me that wanted to refer to you and me the above-referenced new MG 
Metals matter.  Briefly, ICTS of Athens, Alabama, one of MG Metals' shipping 
agents, has reportedly gone into bankruptcy, without paying about $80,000 
owed to various motor carriers (truckers) for transportation here in the U.S 
of MG Metal's aluminum.  No one has yet confirmed that ICTS has in fact gone 
into bankruptcy.  

MG Metals' offices in Canada and New York have begun receiving truckers' 
demand letters for these freight charges, some of which are from attorneys 
threatening suit.  These letters state that as consignee of the various 
cargoes, MG Metals is primarily liable for payment of the freight charges.  I 
think that this is generally correct as a matter of U.S. law, given the usual 
motor carrier bills of lading, although I am having this double-checked.  

Since we have already paid most (but not all) of the money we owed to ICTS, 
MG Metals is looking at a double-payment exposure.  Also, even to the extent 
that ICTS has not been paid, it is entirely possible that ICTS overextended 
itself with a particular trucker and failed to charge MG Metals for enough to 
cover both ICTS's commission and the trucker's freight charges; in other 
words, a trucker may be looking for MG Metals to pay it more in freight than 
MG Metals originally agreed to pay ICTS (which amount should have covered 
both freight and commission).  

I believe that the largest single amount claimed by a trucker is $15,000.  
Bob Klide of MG's New York office and Nicole Dion of MG's Canada office (no 
relationship to Celine--I asked) will be shortly sending me their files.  

To complicate things a bit more, many of the letters Nicole has received deal 
with shipments made in March, at a time when Nicole and her office were 
employees of a trading division of Barclay's.  Some time afterward, they were 
acquired by MG Metals.  As a result of this, Barclay's may (depending on the 
agreement between Barclay's and MG Metals) be on the hook for some of this 
liability.  Nicole advises she has place a Barclay's representative on notice.

I would be happy to take this one off your plate if you would like.  
Obviously, it is a small dollar case and we don't want to pay any money to 
anyone unless we absolutely have to.  Let me know.

Britt

Dear Mr. Williams,
?
This is a follow-up to?the October 5 meeting on the AAA's  eCommerce Dispute

the enthusiasm for the systems and services we are developing  to support the 
Protocol.? We are now at the stage in which we need to get  direct feedback 
from potential users, and I am putting together a working group  to look at 
several aspects of our efforts, including:
?
??? - The mechanics and timelines of the  services
??? - The qualifications of arbitrators and  mediators
??? - Integration and data transfer  issues
??? - Dispute tracking events
??? - Incorporating adjunct services to  offer?a complete dispute management 
process
?
At the meeting you expressed interest and?support for  our?proposed 
services?and how they might benefit Enron.? Enron's  involvement?in 
developing and refining our services would be invaluable to  us, and if?there 
is someone at Enron who could  participate in our efforts, please let me 
know.? Alternatively, you can  simply forward this message to them?and they 
could get in touch with  me.

A number of pieces of on going litigation and arbitration being conducted on 
behalf of EML and EMC have very recently come to our attention which we 
summarise below. We have endeavoured to establish the detail of these cases 
as quickly as possible, but in some instances await information from outside 
counsel involved. The summary is therefore necessarily provisional, and will 
need to be supplemented. There are in addition other claims of which we have 
been made aware, largely being run by MG Hong Kong and Beijing offices. 
Details are presently so sketchy that we have not included them until we have 
been able to verify. A supplementary note on these will follow asap.

1. Corporacion Nacional del  Cobre de Chile ("Codelco" )  v.  MG Ltd, MGAG 
and MGCC

This is a major, and very serious claim being brought by the Chilean state 
copper trading company Codelco against, primarily MG AG of Frankfurt, but 
also against MG Ltd (now Enron Metals Ltd) for recission of futures contracts 
on the basis that they were procured by fraud (a bribe of US$1.5m paid to the 
main Codelco trader by MGAG). We have received a brief summary of the claim 
from Slaughter & May, the lawyers handling the litigation on behalf of EML, 
which is attached below. As a result of an indemnity from MG AG, MG Ltd has 
NO financial exposure other than a credit risk to MG AG.

Legal professional privilege must of course be maintained for this document 
and its contents, and any dissemination outside the legal dept should be made 
subject to prior approval by legal.

Trial is set down in the Chancery Division of the High Court in London for 
5-6 weeks, commencing October 2001. Significantly, and as you will be aware, 
High Court proceedings take place in public.

2. MG Ltd v. China Resources National Corporation

Claim in LME arbitration for payment of US$6m futures losses on client 
contracts. Award published in favour of MGL on liability alone in August 
2000. Damages to be assessed. Thereafter Award to be enforced in China. 
Solicitors: Clyde & Co.


3. MG Ltd v. London Clearing House

Claim in LME arbitration for delivery of defective tin under warrant. Losses 
believed to be US$800,000. 7 day time bar defence run by the LCH heard as 
preliminary issue. Award in approx Feb 2000 in favour of MG (ie time bar 
inapplicable). This has led to resumption of settlement negotiations with 
Standard Chartered Bank (trading), who put the metal onto warrant originally 
(and against whom the LCH would have an indemnity claim). The most recent 
offer from Standard Chartered is to pay US$437,000; but this is subject to 
unacceptable conditions. Solicitors: Allen & Overy.

4. Nickel explosion in furnace in Cleveland: Scandia Transport  
LMEWarehouse/LCH/EMC/Phoenix /EAC/ Cast Alloys (smelter)

Contaminated nickel supplied by EMC into the US. Amount of loss being 
established now. Incident much less bad than initial reports suggested, and 
have therefore deferred explosion survey/investigation lined up on urgent 
basis earlier this week. Expect indemnity claim to be brought against EMC by 
Phoenixx in LME arbitration; and to pass same claim on to the LCH. Assume 
possibility of US tort claim also lying direct from Smelter to EMC (awaiting 
advice from Limor Nissan/Andy Edison on this). Facts should become 
sufficiently clear to enable rough quantification within next week (w/c 26/3).

NB. Other similarly contaminated shipments from the same warehouse are known 
to exist. Warnings to other customers are being prepared.

5. LME arbitration: Chinese receiver/ICD/Brandeis/EMC/EML/LCH/Warehouse

Claim brought by Chinese receivers for supply of defective nickel on LME 
warrant bought through London clearing. Only US$62,000 claim, but involves 
significant point of principle, hence decision taken to proceed in 
arbitration. Should in principle be able to pass on incoming claim to LCH 
(and beyond). Expect unrecoverable costs (internal and external) to exceed 
the amount of the claim. Solicitors to be instructed w/c 26/3.

Subject: Cargo/Storage Claim - Styrene at Baytank


I spoke to the head adjuster Sharron West this morning regarding this claim.  
She has discussed same with their chemist Bob Ash.

Sharron has reached some conclusions that are far different from the claim 
which was submitted to her.  From our conversation, the main differences seem 
to be:

1.  She is calculating the claim using the basis of valuation in the Philco 
contract.  That basis of valuation seems to coincide with your monthly 
storage declarations.   Your calculations appear to be based more on the spot 
price of the product. I believe the difference is around $.10 per lb which is 
very significant when so many lbs are involved.

2.  There appears to be a discrepancy in the number of pounds involved in the 
claim.  Baytank's records seem to indicate around 2,000,000 lbs. whereas your 
claim references approx. 6,000,000 lbs.   Both Sharron and Bob think that a 
maximum of 4,000,000 lbs. should be considered.

3.  Ancillary charges.  The Enron claim appears to include some Baytank 
charges that are not recoverable, such as tank cleaning, etc.  As a cargo 
policy normally insures against direct physical loss or damage to the product 
itself, there are some charges that are not recoverable under a cargo 
policy.   There also appear to be stock throughput charges in your claim 
through January of 2000, although the product would have been gone by the end 
of November.

At any rate,  based on the valuation of product in the Philco contract (and 
the storage declarations that have been submitted for premium purposes), and 
there being a total of 4,000,000 pounds of product, Sharron has calculateda 
claim in the vicinity of $150,000.  This is obviously a far cry from the 
claim submitted of around $900,000+.   Of course, if you consider a 
difference of $.10 /lb. and apply it to 4,000,000 lbs, you already have a 
difference of $400,000.  If you then factor in the difference between 
6,000,000 lbs claimed vs. 4,000,000 lbs. recognized by the adjusters, you 
have another significant sum.

I would be interested in your comments at this point.  If you feel that the 
adjuster has everything wrong, I might suggest that we arrange a meeting and 
go through the claim point by point. This is sometimes the quickedt way to 
resolve major differences.

Please let me know.

Thanks and regards,





Ted Rosen

Attached is the Joint Defense Agreement from Shook, Hardy & Bacon with my 
comments in redline. This agreement was sent to us to allow Enron access to 
the Power Systems' attorney's opinion regarding whether the proposed redesign 
for the New Albany and Doyle turbines might infringe GE patents.

My comments are intended to preserve Enron's rights to bring any claims that 
it may have against Power Systems. Do we have any other agreements of this 
type with Power Systems?  Some claims that Enron may have against Power 
Systems such as claims for breach of warranty may have limitations periods 
that are approaching.  I believe we have discussed having Bracewell review 
the depositions and any documents related to the installation of the 
allegedly infringing systems into Enron's facilities.  Please advise if you 
would like for us to undertake this review and ensure that any claims that 
Enron may have are protected.

Thanks.

Richard

Regarding your friends who have the working interest in the Bowen #1 and #2 wells in Panola County, I've had the gas contracts system checked and  Houston Pipe Line Company does not purchase gas from Hydrocarbon Lease Management in that county.  The only county in which HPL purchases gas from HLM is a well in Matagorda County.  There are no records of gas purchases from any well called Bowen #1 or Bowen #2.   If they have well meter numbers, we can run a check that way but it doesn't look like HPL is the gas purchaser.

	Richard,

	Today Stacy and I spoke with Mike Farrell, Adkins' attorney.  It was brief and to the point.  I told him that his August 8, 2001 demand letter makes no reference to a verbal deal for a fixed price done on March 6 that was confirmed in writing by fax to his client on March 8.  Farrell told me that Adkins had not advised him of any such deal.  Farrell, who is quick on his feet, asked me to send him any writing signed by his client to this effect.   Once he sees that the confirm is the type which does not require a counter-party signature, Farrell may try to raise a statute of frauds issue, given that the deal confirmed could not have been fully performed within one year.

	However, there are at least two counter-arguments.  First, the underlying base contract that was assigned to ENA from CES was signed by Adkins; in fact, to that base contract is attached a confirm for one-year floating index price deal with an evergreen clause, which I think is the deal Adkins is trying to enforce--and that confirm is signed only by CES.  Second, since (as John confirmed for me a moment ago) we hedged the fixed price deal, we may have good promissory estoppel arguments sufficient to trump a statute of frauds argument.

	Farrell also mentioned a conversation with Wade Price in ENA Customer Service, during which Price advised Adkins that Adkins in fact had a floating price contract.  I asked Farrell when that conversation occurred, and Farrell could only say that it ocurred some time in the year 2000. Stacy and I are following up with Price on this.  Preliminarily, such a conversation could have occurred; however, we so far appear to have a very reasonable explanation.  

	In brief, our back office was drinking from a fire hose during the time of the CES contract assimilation, and this and other deals were not getting entered into the correct system.  For that reason, (a) ENA continued to pay Adkins based on the old floating index price from some months after March 2000, until this and other mispayment issues were caught by an internal audit, and (b) if Price had been called by Adkins before the corrections were made would have assumed, based on what was in the system at the time, that the old floating index price contract was still current.  Price keeps a log of phone calls and will be reviewing them in preparation for a further interview by us.

	As Stacy mentioned, the really interesting point is the timing of Adkin's purported call.  Although this remains speculation at present, Adkins would have been losing money for the first several months, maybe until around July-August 2000, as the index was under the fixed price during that time period.  However, Adkins may not have been on notice of this until he received the first couple of checks.  Given that payment for Appalachian gas runs a month or so slower than elsewhere,  Adkins may not have received those checks until July-August.  By around August 1, the Appalachian index price had already risen above the fixed price.  In other words, with the benefit of being several months down the road, Adkins realized that this was going to be a banner year for Appalachian gas prices during the later heating season (and was).  So, perhaps Adkins called Price with an agenda in mind, which was to take advantage of what he realized was a mistake by Enron.

   	Timing here again will be important.  If we coincidentally did not complete our internal audit until the Appalachian index price rose above the fixed price deal we had with Adkins, then Adkins will argue that ENA opportunistically changed its position on whether there was a deal when the index price rose.  This is exactly, of course, our position with regard to Adkins.  Stacy will be researching the gas prices during the relevant time frame.

	You should also know that Adkins has reportedly done this in the past to our other Appalachian gas trader, Jim Javens.  John learned about this after the fact.  I will be following up with Javens.

	The next step is for me to send to Farrell the confirm and any other documentation I want him to see, and follow-up with Farrell to attempt to narrow the fact issues.  

	I will keep you advised.

	Britt

Attached for your consideration is a memo drafted by a partner in the Lopez 
Velarde firm concerning the status of the prior Amparo proceedings that were 
virtually identical to the proceeding in which Enron Energia Industrial is an 
interested party.  Also attached is a chart describing all six of the 
proceedings and the status of each.

I have heard nothing concerning what actions are being taken to obtain an 
opinion from US counsel concerning the risks, if any, to Enron in providing 
an indemnity to the Inter-American Development Bank ("IDB") relative to this 
litigation.  If we are to enable the provide a proposal to the IDB within the 
next day, the scheduled closing date of November 16, 2000, is in extreme 
jeopardy.  Please advise of the status of the opinion.

Thank you.

We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=

the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into Enron Global Assets in the near future.

the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=

at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=

CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the=
=20
commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=

All

Following the meeting this morning I have typed up some notes and associated 
actions. Could everyone please look at the attachment and let me know whether 
I have understood the requirements correctly, and also who is going to action 
each point, either the project team or the legal department. 

Thank you for your assistance in getting this under way.

This is great news!!!  Can you handle sending this announcement as I assume 
this was an audit issue for the other trading groups as well!!

Also,  how can we get this same process in place for the Houston and 
Singapore offices??  They have the same issues on their audits.  Thanks you 
guys did a great job!!!!   Cindy

Subject: Recording Trades from made on Mobile phones  

Cindy,

We have some good news for you.  We have set up a number which can only be 
called from Enron Mobile phones (37373), when you dial this number you will 
hear dialtone.  The dialtone is coming from the phone system at Enron House, 
you are then able to dial exactly as if you were at your desk, ie dial '9' 
and the number you wish to reach.

All calls coming through this route will be recorded and can be retrieved by 
the telecoms team for playback / reference.

We have also ensured that external people cannot dial this number from 
outside the building by using 020 7783 7373.

Let me know if you want to issue a note as a General Announcement or whether 
you wish to handle the distribution of the number.

Regards,

Andy

Subject: Re: Who should I talk to on this one?  

Instead of providing a phone number could there be a short code or something 
that they do that in the background dials this number so no one gets access 
to this number?   I know that this is an issue in all of the offices with 
traders making deals on cell phones on unrecorded lines.  I do not want to do 
something that puts Enron at risk though.  Thanks Cindy

Subject: Re: Who should I talk to on this one?

Cindy,

We can provide a telephone number in the office which the traders can call 
from their mobile phone, they would then be offered dialtone from the 
telephone system and can then dial on to an external party.

The call would then be routed out from the office and would be subject the 
the normal recording criteria.

However I wouldn't recommend this approach as we are opening up an external 
gateway for people to use our telephone system, this would be unmetered and 
not secure. The potential for toll-fraud is something that we need to take 
into account.

Regards,

Andy Cowx

Subject: Who should I talk to on this one?

If the traders do a deal from their cell phone, is there a way they can have 
that call routed back through the phones in the building so it gets done on a 
recorded line?  I know if you call someone and then dial some numbers it 
takes you to their cell phone.  Can it work backwards so they hit some 
numbers and it routes the call through the office?   This would help with 
some of our AA issues.  Thanks Cindy

PRIVILEGED ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION

Steve, Karl and Tom

I met with Karl this morning.  My suggestion is that, from this point 
forward, all communications with the trailer park should be coordinated with 
the legal department and all of our communications internally should be 
prefaced with "Attorney-Client Privileged Communication".   Any 
correspondence or information that I request from you or that you send me 
should be prefaced as "Attorney-Client Privileged".  Karl is to duplicate his 
file for me and to document dates on which conversations or meetings have 
taken place thus far.  I will draft a letter for Steve's signature to be sent 
to the owners of the trailer park and their attorney demanding that they 
immediately remove the two trailers that are sitting within 6' and 1' of the 
pipe centerline AND the two trailers that are within 16' of the pipe 
centerline.  In my opinion, you should strictly construe the terms of the 
right of way agreement which is of public record that states that the grantor 
shall not permit ANY housing or other structure to be within the right of 
way.  I also will advise them that the trees in the right of way are going to 
be removed.  I will endeavor to visit with Bud Wolcott and the Lumberton team 
regarding this matter.

Richard

I am sending this to you as a "heads up" of possible litigation arising out 
of our demand for these trailer homes to be moved off of HPL's easement.    
We have a 50' recorded easement prohibiting structures from being  on or 
within the right of way.  The engineer that designed the trailer park wrongly 
assumed it was only 30' wide.  Four trailers are within the easement.  Large 
pine trees are in the easement area and literally on top of the pipeline.  
Obviously, it will be HPL's nickel to cut down the trees but I anticipate 
there may be a dispute as to who pays for the trailers to be moved out of the 
easement area.  They have retained an attorney; however, he has, thus far, 
not disputed HPL's right to prohibit structures within 25' of the pipe 
centerline.  Let me know if you need more details.  I'll keep you advised.

PROTECTED - ATTORNEY/CLIENT PRIVILEDGE

Karl will be coming to you to discuss the issues below.  We have several 
mobile homes that have been positioned and placed within our pipeline 
easement, one approximating a foot off the pipeline.  There are a couple that 
I think we should absolutely mandate to be moved.  For the remainder, I would 
like to mandate and require in writing the Park management to notify in 
writing those that remain encroached on the easement of the inherit dangers 
of a natural gas pipeline and their proximity to such.  Obviously, I am not 
trying to create a scare, as a scare is not warranted based on any known 
facts on this pipeline.  But I would believe that our liability may be 
expanded if we were not proactive and did not require the Park management to 
notify the clients that are encroaching of the circumstances upon which they 
exist.  Each person would therefore be informed about the circumstances 
surrounding them and would have made a conscientious decision to remain in 
spite of such circumstances.  Your thoughts on this please.

Subject: Pinewood Manor

 I  don't know what the current status of the Pinewood Manor matter is, but 
Steve Schneider and I talked about it a little on Friday.  We think that if 
we are going to allow some minor encroachment (a very few mobile 
homes/trailers, not too close to the pipeline) onto HPL's 50-foot easement, 
then at a minimum we should get an encroachment agreement which includes:
acknowledgement that HPL is not responsible for any damages resulting from 
the encroachments
agreement that Pinewood Manor will be responsible for any incremental costs 
if the encroachments interfere with our operation, maintenance, etc., and 
will remove any encroachments as required by HPL in order for HPL to conduct 
its operations as it deems appropriate
a commitment from the owners of Pinewood Manor that they will notify (in a 
document that HPL will provide) all present and future tenants about the 
pipeline

Please let us know of any developments regarding this matter.

It looks to me like another case of an obvious error (i.e. the counterparty 
should have known it was a mistake).  I'm afraid we've just been lucky that 
the numbers have been so far off - some day we're going to have one that is 
too close to call obvious.

I've reviewed the PG&E trade in question again and the spread value is 
actually $4.62, rather than $9. Given the fact that a typical spread trade 
for Nat Gas is aroung 5 or 6 cents, I know that this correction is not much 
of a consolation, but I wanted to clarify the pricing nonetheless.

Deal Number Q75763.1, .2
Leg 1 = 9.38
Leg 2 = 4.76

Spread valueon trade = 4.62

Dear Richard:

This is the contact information of the two guys I mentioned at lunch.  I know
both of these guys and have worked with them.  As I indicated they are both
technically savvy and have been in the construction side of the business as
well as management.

Joe Richards is a trouble shooter.  He can go in to finish a project when it
gets into trouble.  He has a lot of experience in construction, startup and
recently as recovery specialist.  He was recently down in Columbia completing
the Termo Valle project for Marubeni.  He is currently on a job in
Connecticut and can be reached on his cell at 832-654-5070.  His hotel number
is 203 777-5337.  His email is: thestartup@aol.com

Upshur Quinby is a technical and construction guy that looks at designs and
can identify incorrect designs and potential areas for cost overrun.  He
started in construction with Bechtel and ended up as a President of an Ebasco
subsidiary. Phone is 757-874-9056;  cell 757-593-6100; email :
crsquinby@aol.com

These guys know a lot about the industry, the players, and history on a lot
of the projects.  They are straight shooters and will tell it to you as they
see it.

You should give them a call an introduce yourself when you have a chance. I
have spoken to them both so they will recognize the name and take your call.

Regards,
Jim
