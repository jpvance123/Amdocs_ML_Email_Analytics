The attached from EPSA is reportedly the detailed outline of the Administration's electricity bill that hit the street late yesterday and today.  I am awaiting confirmation that this is it, but it appears to be.  One more proposal to crank into the mix.

Several comments:
 
Sec. 407 How is the determination made of whether a market is competitive and who makes the determination?  It looks like in this section, revocation of MBRs occurs at the time the complaint is filed and the remedy is revocation of MBRs.  However, in a later section (411) it looks like the remedy is mitigation.
Sec 408 It is not clear to me that generator here includes on-site or DG that you want to resell partially or all into the wholesale market (See (f)(2).  Also, in b1(D)(2), affords an opportunity for an evidentiary hearing.  If the utility is wrong and clearly violating the rule, then hotline should be able to remedy, not go to evidentiary hearing.  FERC can order a hearing now, but doesn't have to. 
In (c)(2) directly below, the order is issued if all the requirements are met (using "and").  Can it say "or" because simply adding a generator because the market needs more peaking capacity may not be "encouraging overall conservation or energy or capital" (unless the argument is gen added instead of trans or something like that)
Sec 411 What is significant period of time, etc?  This is where it looks like the remedy is mitigation plan, no refunds?
Sec 413 Market transparency--Not sure what "sale price of each sale" means?  does this include structured deals?  simply real time sales?  What is "updated as frequently as practicable"?
 
Sec 414 ((b)(3)--Would add "RTO" after control area operator or transmitting utility.  We hope to bid to RTO, not control areas.
Sec 512 Public Benefits Charge looks like tax on all MWs gened whether from an IPP or rate based generator.(Lloyd Will is reviewing this).
Sec 523 statement about Known energy sources sold at wholesale.  We typically portfolio source and don't know which generator the power coming from.  This section may be ok when taken in context with the renewable credits, but I don't know enough about the credit program, so just raising the issue.
Sec 604 the requirement for real-time metering and pricing seems to practically require the real time transparent pricing that we want.(I sent the EES traders and DG guys this part on net metering, etc.)
Thanks!

Linda requested some background and talking points on the pending RTO letter from Chairman Tauzin to FERC that is sitting on Chairman Barton's desk TODAY for his decision whether to co-sign the letter.  While we have not seen the text, we are told that it is "anti-RTO" and may go so far as to state or imply that FERC does not have authority to do what is doing with RTOs.  (We know this is the view of one of Chairman Tauzin's counsels, who formerly worked for Southern Co.).  Chairman Tauzin has been contacted by Entergy and the Louisiana Public Service Commission to send the letter.  I spoke to Chairman Barton's staff, Andy Black, this afternoon and relayed our concerns.  The Barton Subcommittee is now expected to mark up an electricity bill in December (per a Republican Member meeting held this morning).

ACTION ITEM:		Call Rep. Joe Barton (202/225-2002)

TALKING POINTS:

	1.	Should start with something about the Dynegy/Enron transaction (it will be strange if Mr. Lay or Steve calls Chairman 		Barton and does not start the conversation with some reference to the transaction).

	2.	Mentioning the transaction naturally leads into the importance of competitive wholesale markets for power, both
		for consumers and for the largely Texas-based marketing, trading and merchant power industries.

	3.	We understand that Chairman Barton has been approached by Chairman Tauzin about a letter to FERC on the
		RTO issue.  We know Chairman Barton is well aware of Enron's strong support for FERC's RTO initiatives.
		We respect Chairman Barton's interest in seeing to it that Congress does not abdicate its responsibility to
		make energy policy.

	4.	If, as we have been lead to believe, the letter states or implies that FERC does not have authority to act in the
		RTO arena, this will be seen as a potentially destabilizing development since FERC is so far down the road of
		creating RTOs.

	5.	While we understand some in Congress and elsewhere were concerned that FERC was moving too fast, as of
		the last FERC meeting earlier this month, that is no longer true even if it ever was true.  While we think RTOs
		should be created sooner rather than later, FERC is listening to state regulators and others who had concerns.

	6.	A letter from congressional leaders questioning FERC's authority goes too far in the direction of those who
		oppose any RTOs.  Furthermore, it is wrong as a matter of law.  The D.C. Circuit held in the gas cases and
		in the power cases on Order 888 that FERC has authority to address systemic discrimination, which is in large
		part what the RTOs are all about -- a remedy for discrimination.

Tonight by a vote of 91/2 (although Senator Wellstone was asking to switch 
his vote; so the final vote may end up being 90/3) the Senate passed the 
Conference Report on the DOD Reauthorization, H.R. 4205.  With the 
overwhelming majority votes in both the House and Senate this week, the bill 
will now be enrolled and sent to the President for signature.

Although the statutory language and report language is a clear victory for 
EFS; we did not in the end have the draft colloquy entered into the record 
regarding the enforcement interpretation.  Seems EEI's lawyers had submitted 
a colloquy of their own.  Thus, our colloquy successfully served the purpose 
of blocking theirs which we should list as a "victory" given that their 
colloquy would have been damaging to us.  So in the end, Enron achieved all 
its legislative goals while EEI was unsuccessful in even gaining a statement 
for the record.

Off the record, we did gain acceptance for the issue raised in our colloquy 
by DOD and they stand ready to defend their enforcement authority; possibly 
at the upcoming NARUC meeting.

Bill signature; and thus, Public Law enactment, could occur as early as next 
week.  We will keep you advised as to when this occurs.  Again, 
congratulations to the team for a successful legislative effort against some 
stiff odds.

There are now two House hearnigs tomorrow, not just one.  In the morning, there is a panel on reliability, siting and incentive pricing for transmission.  Jim Steffes is the EPSA witness.  The RTO-related hearing, originally scheduled on a separate day, will be in the afternoon tomorrow.  Peter Esposito of Dynegy is the expected EPSA witness.  I am checking on the final list of other panelists and will advise.

Finally, Andy Black of Chairman Barton's staff advises that they will release draft RTO language as early as today.  We expect that this draft will not be to our liking.  Barton thinks FERC is moving too quickly and with too much force.  We expect his proposal to set a deadline of something like 12 months for utilities to join an RTO.  The key is in part whether he allows FERC to continue to decide what constitutes an acceptable RTO or whether he will try to "grandfather" in some fashion those RTOs that have been proposed by utilities to date.

As folks know, I am sending our suggested legislative language to DOE this 
afternoon,  The package you were asked to review contained legislative 
language making RTO participation mandatory.  After further discussions with 
Tom Briggs, I am not sending the mandatory RTO language as a part of our 
package.  My concern with sending it as legislative language is that this 
would muddy the waters on our open access rulemaking (a draft of which we are 
getting this Friday from Watkiss and which we plan to transmit to DOE next 
week).  FERC has existing authority to make RTO participation mandatory.  
Thus, instead of fighting out the issue in the legislative sphere, we should 
reserve it for a possible rulemaking in open access.  We decided not to two 
track open access, so I don't think we want to two track mandatory RTOs.  If 
anyone disagrees with this strategy, we can send it first thing Thursday in 
legislative form to DOE.

Andrea-

I received some additional information on your request for the status update 
of S. 764.

According to Sen. Feinstein's staff, S. 764 is with the Sen. Energy and 
Natural Resource Committee and is ready for mark-up.  The Committee is aware 
of the substance of the bill because the Senator already introduced bills 
S.26 and S.287 which both would direct the federal government to place "cost 
of service" based rates on electric energy in the western states.

Moreover, in the House of Representatives today, the Energy and Commerce 
Committee, Subcommittee on Energy and Air Quality held a mark-up of a bill, 
H.R. 1647, requiring FERC to establish a clearinghouse for the purchase of 
electric energy during electric emergencies.  Rep. Waxman (D-CA) offered Sen. 
Feinstein's language from S.764 as an amendment to H.R. 1647.  The amendment 
failed, but was eagerly watched by those in the government and industry.

Finally, it is my understanding that Senator Feinstein will be writing 
personally to all of the major natural gas and electric companies in 
California asking them to support the Williams position.

Please call with any questions.

Late yesterday afternoon, EPSA's legislative affairs committee (about 10 of us) met with Chairman Barton and staff to discuss his draft RTO language.  Meeting lasted 45 minutes.  Interestingly, no one was there from either Reliant or El Paso.

We had what the diplomats would call a frank exchange of views.  Can't say we moved Barton very much, if at all, except we did have a chance to "go over the staff" to point out specific flaws in the draft even based on his view of how RTOs should come about (I gave several very specific examples like the 40,000 MW provision and other limits on FERC discretion on size and scope, as well as procedural rights for transmission owners but not the rest of us, etc.).

Chairman Barton's fundamental view is that Congress, not FERC, should determine how RTOs come about.  And that "the market" and "the industry" should determine how RTOs are shaped, etc., not FERC.  He bristled at one point and said he had more faith in "us" than he had in FERC or we had in ourselves to determine how RTOs come about, going so far as to saying that under his draft they would be "our" RTOs -- meaning those of us present.  I pointed out this is wrong because under his draft the transmission owners, particularly those least likely to join up, would have all the leverage.  I said that the basic flaw in the draft is that it assumes there are only two parties to the transaction -- FERC and transmission owners -- forgetting the rest of us, including consumers.  He said we could become transmission owners if we wanted to!!!

On the 40,000 MW size minimum, he said many "experts" had advised them this is the correct number.  We said that putting a number in to the statute ran counter to his oft-stated desire for a fair process to produce RTOs driven by market forces, not regulators.

The two elements of good news -- Barton reconfirmed that a markup this year is very unlikely AND he expressed that he would not spend too much time on electricity next year if it started to crowd out other issues, like Clean Air Act Amendments and nuclear waste legislation.  This suggests a strategy possibility in terms of running out the clock.

He said he has the votes by a wide margin to report the RTO draft, but will entertain some changes.  He said the only reason he has not marked up the bill is that the Sept. 11th terrorist attacks have taken attention away from the issue and subcommittee members are not engaged on the issue.  He said those of us who support could roll the dice with them, but that there are things that only Congress can do -- like getting all transmission owners into RTOs -- and that these statutory changes are so important that we should not oppose the draft.

Attached for review and comment is a draft set of talking points on the Barton RTO discussion draft.  I went through the testimony at the recent hearing and parsed the legislative language of the discussion draft.  You will see that the talking points are designed to respond to two basic points being raised by our opponents: (1) that FERC is rushing and being heavy-handed and (2) that the only interests involved are those of the transmitting utilities (i.e., no mention of discrimination as being what RTOs will remedy).

Please let me have your thoughts in the next few days.  Once Capitol Hill is up and running again, we will distribute the final talking points to our consultants and to members/staff of the Barton Subcommittee as we continue our efforts against the discussion draft's treatment of RTOs.

Steve and Rick:  I attempted to strengthen the latest draft of the 
Stakeholder letter per your instructions on our most recent conference call.  
Unfortunately, we have pushed to the point that APPA, the consumer groups and 
most utilities will no longer sign the letter per their e-mail below.  It now 
looks like no letter will be sent.  If you would like, Enron, EPSA, ELCON and 
ACC only can send a revised stronger letter or alternatively, just bag the 
idea.  The utilities are split not wishing to let APPA appear more reliable 
then them.  I will forward the MidAmerican letter for your files which does 
support our position per my request.  I feel it is unfortunate that now APPA 
will send a strong support letter instead of signing our modified version.   
Per his request, I will meet with Congressman Wynn's Chief of Staff next week 
upon his return from vacation to discuss their strategy.   thanks.

Subject: Stakeholder Reliability Letter


While we have been actively involved in the editing process for a
stakeholder letter on reliability, I am writing to let you know of growing
concern among APPA's membership that the draft stakeholder reliability
letter still does not go far enough in representing our association's
position in support of stand-alone reliability legislation in the absence of
a comprehensive restructuring measure.  While we know the draft was intended
only to be kept in our "back pocket" for use if needed later in the session,
we would not be able to endorse sending the letter in any event unless it
was substantially strengthened to directly indicate support for a
stand-alone reliability measure.  Because it has become clear during the
editing process that the group cannot arrive at consensus on that point, we
would like to suggest that the group opt not to send such a letter, but
instead have our individual organizations write their own letters that more
accurately reflect their support or opposition on the question of
stand-alone reliability.  Thank you for your consideration.  Jane.

Yesterday I spent about 45 minutes with the three key energy staff to the H=
ouse Energy and Commerce Committee -- Andy Black (for Barton) and Sean Cunn=
ingham and Jason Bentley (the energy counsels to the full committee).  We m=
et at my request to discuss Barton RTO draft.  (The group EPSA meeting with=
 Chairman Barton that was to have been yesterday afternoon has been resched=
uled for next Tuesday.)
=20
Key points from the meeting --
=20
1.  They do not expect the Barton Subcommittee to mark up the electricity l=
egislation this year.  Time is running out and Members of the subcommittee =
are not focused on the issue.  Instead, they plan to continue working on th=
e issue at the staff level.  Probably will be another draft version circula=
ted and then a version will be introduced by Barton as a formal bill by the=
 end of the year. The earliest they see any kind of vote is late Jan. or ea=
rly February.
=20
2.   Barton feels strongly that FERC should not be the "tail wagging the do=
g" on RTO policy.
=20
3.   On particulars of the bill, they are clearly reconsidering the 40,000 =
MW minimum threshold for the size of an RTO.  They are getting pulled in bo=
th directions, they say, and are inclined to drop the 40,000 MW number -- p=
ossibly leaving it to FERC to set a number.  They conceded that the mechani=
cs of the draft make it unlikely that the 18 month "deadline" for all trans=
mission owners to get into an approved RTO would stick.  They consciously c=
hanged the normal judicial standard of review for FERC actions from "arbitr=
ary and capricious" to "preponderance of the evidence" because they think o=
therwise the courts will rubber stamp FERC.  Spent a lot of time on how the=
 draft would aid and abet the recalcitrant utilities and that the overall n=
ature of the draft assumes there are only two parties to this -- FERC and t=
he transmission owners -- while the rest of those truly affected -- from us=

Today, the House Ways and Means passed it version of the economic package.  The package included a repeal of the corporate AMT retroactive until 2000 and refundable AMT credits.  The stimulus package is expected to be on the House floor later next week.  This is a positive development because it puts us in the very best negotiating position as the focus moves to the Senate where there is less unanimity on repealing the corporate AMT.  Please see the memo below for more info.  
 
Also, the House Ways and Means Committee passed a 2-year extension of the Wind Production Tax Credit.
 
Have a nice weekend.

We had a positive result in the EPSA Legislative Affairs Committee meeting yesterday afternoon. The EPSA staff draft of a letter to Barton on his RTO discussion proposal will be significantly strengthened and EPSA staff will start by incorporating the comments I sent over earlier in the week.  The original draft said the Barton RTO language only needed "technical corrections."

EPSA staff reiterated that some member co. or cos. think Barton's draft could have been worse.  My reply was this "logic" was like saying we should be grateful he shot us in the head instead of hanging us -- one method may be more "humane" but either way we are "dead" (OK, the analogy may be too rough -- but it made the point.)  (I subsequently confirmed that Reliant is the "soft" member -- their rep. told me they "support the discussion draft although they wouldn't object if it is strengthened.")

A stronger EPSA letter with more specific reasons why we oppose the Barton discussion draft will be circulated among EPSA members today or Monday, with the goal of sending the letter first thing Tuesday when Congress returns.  Some wanted a general letter requesting a meeting, and deferring specific comments until the meeting.  I pointed out that Barton is speaking to subcommittee members right now and that we needed to copy them on a more detailed letter ASAP so they hear from us before Barton gets to them.  We will make the same contacts ourselves.  In fact, we have already started.  Spoke to Reps. Chip Pickering and Rep. Greg Walden, both subcommittee Republicans, this week (did same with staff to Rep. John Shimkus).

Key task when House staff return to work on Tuesday will be finding out where Ranking Member Rick Boucher is on the Barton RTO draft.  Barton implied at a conference earlier this week that he and Boucher are in agreement on RTOs.

Subject: New PUHCA Exemption Legislative Language

Yesterday, Ken Lay spoke with MidAmerican CEO David Sokol regarding the 
attached new legislative amendment to provide a limited PUHCA exemption for 
companies with a high level of financial stability as determined by 
independent market analysts (i.e. "A" rating for Holding Companies or 
investment grade rating for utility companies).  This is not a permanent 
exemption as PUHCA would again apply should the company loose its high rating.

MidAmerican's lobbyist reported this conversation to me along with Ken Lay's 
reported commitment that we would review it as soon as we could.  Reportedly, 
Ken Lay was non-committal but not negatively disposed.

The utility strategy is to have Senator Bob Kerrey (D-NE) offer this as an 
amendment to a "must pass" piece of legislation during the waning days of 
this Congressional session.  This will be separate from the utilities' 
strategy to enact Private Use legislation (H.R. 4971, S. 2967 which includes 
tax language to exclude water and sewage connection fees from gross income as 
contributions to capital and language to increase the amount permitted to 
paid into nuclear decommissioning reserve funds primarily  for Commonwealth 
Edison) and to enact stand-alone Reliability legislation (S. 2071 and H.R. 
2944).

Senator Kerrey has already spoken to Senator Gramm (R-TX) about this PUHCA 
amendment and Gramm was reportedly  non-committal but not negatively disposed 
to the idea.  I will follow-up with Gramm's staff next week after they've 
reviewed it and convey their views to you.  According to MidAmerican,  the 
concept to insure stockholder protection along with consumer protection was 
Senator Kerrey's idea.  

It is possible that Congressman Dingell (D-MI) and Congressman Markey (D-MA) 
would still actively oppose this limited exemption, especially given the fact 
that Congressman Dingell (who would Chair the Commerce Committee should the 
Democrats regain control of the House) has recently said that whether or not 
he is Commerce Committee Chairman next Congress, that comprehensive 
electricity restructuring legislation including PUHCA repeal is "at least 
three years away from happening."

Steve and Rick, can we get a temperature gauge next week as to our position 
on this amendment?  As a reminder, Enron's position here-to-date has been to 
oppose stand-alone PUHCA repeal as this is the one provision utilities like 
Southern Company really want.  To date, this strategy has worked with the 
MidAmerican Utility Group willing to support our transmission open access 
provisions in turn for our PUHCA exemption support.

John --

On this bill, I would think that as far as our competitive businesses go, we should work through EPSA.  Better to have the industry speaking with one voice.  To that end, do we know where EPSA is on this - Reliant and Mirant will have a much larger impact.  Finally, we probably will need this ability for our Control Area operators.

Subject:	Energy Infrastructure Security Legislation



Senator Schumer's office sent over a copy of the Chairman's Mark that will form the basis for a hearing tomorrow and a mark up Wednesday in the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee on energy infrastructure security legislation.  Pat is working with the pipeline group on how it affects them since it clearly applies to natural gas pipelines.

It would also clearly apply to PGE and to physical power plant assets we operate.  The main impact here would be in the area of criminal background checks, including fingerprinting, for employees in categories to be determined in DOE implementing regulations.  The background check data would be shared with law enforcement.  The legislative language says that the background check regulations will "enable entities" operating "critical energy infrastructure facilities" to have these background checks.  "Enable" is an odd choice of language because it could mean "authorize" only or it could mean "require."  We should assume that the background checks will be mandatory despite this odd language.

The definition of "critical energy infrastructure facilities" would NOT appear to pick up our trading and other energy services businesses beyond pipelines, power plants and PGE.  The definition is "a facility for the generation or transmission of electrical energy, or the production, refining, transportation, or storage of petroleum, natural gas, or petroleum product, the incapacity or destruction of which would have a debilitating impact on the defense or economic security of the United States."

If there is some reason why we would want other facilities included in the definition in order to obtain authorization for background checks, please let me know.  It should be pointed out that the current draft does not contain explicit legal immunity for employers who provide information about employees to authorities.

John

I believe Ken will be very interested to read the President's remarks today on the economic stimulus package.  The President specifically said that repeal of the corporate AMT is officially part of his plan.  That's a huge development, and I wanted Ken to know that Team Enron's efforts are making progress.  His calls have been very helpful.

Marc Lampkin from our offices is at a briefing on the stimulus package that

The House Ways and Means Committee will consider the tax portions of the 
"energy" bill after the July 4 recess.  We have learned that the Democrats on 
the Committee may offer a windfall profits tax on energy to pay for other 
aspects of the tax bill.  The price of the tax bill has grown from the 
Administration's anticipated level of $10 billion to over $50 billion and 
under the pay-go rules additional tax cuts must be paid for from other 
sources.  A similar amendment by Senator Rockefeller (D-WV) was overwhelming 
rejected by the Senate Finance Committee.  We do not want to take anything 
for granted as this could be continuously raised during the energy debate.

Per my request, Mike Pate is going to hold a meeting next week with EPSA, 
API, EEI and other related associations to decide how to combat this and 
future efforts on the windfall profits tax.  He will also invite company 
representatives from El Paso, Duke, Williams and others.  However, we think 
this effort is best pursued by our associations to avoid unwanted attention 
to earnings.

I will update as this develops.

The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee held an unusually long hearing 
today (9:30 am to 4:30 pm) on FERC's responses to the California situation 
and other related energy issues.  The "star witness" was Gov. Davis.  Others 
were Govs. Martz of Montana and Hoeven of North Dakota against price caps, 
Sens. Murkowski, Murray and Cantwell, Washington State's attorney general, 
Oregon's PUC chairman, and the five FERC commissioners.  Once Davis left 
after several hours of testimony and two rounds of questions, most of the 
press and audience left.

Enron was mentioned several times as follows:

 1. Sen. Thompson, the Ranking Republican, mentioned Lockyer's "Spike" 
comments in the context of asking Gov. Davis about why business would make 
new investments in the state when on top of the regulatory uncertainty, there 
is the broader political hostility expressed in this way by state officials.  
Davis had two chances to disavow Lockyer and did not.  (Thompson gave him a 
second chance when he basically repeated the question and made specific 
reference again to "Spike," asking Davis if FERC acted this week because of 
the AG's Spike comments.)  The first time Davis said that the people he 
represents are mad, they want him to fight back, this is rough business, the 
industry people are used to a wildcatter's environment, things occassionally 
get out of hand, and we are not going to take it.  On the second instance, he 
said that the state was building new power plants and investment was not 
being diminished.

 2. Sen. Bennett (R-UT) did an excellent job questioning Gov. Davis about his 
handling of the situation, using quotes from California newspapers to make 
the case that Davis was slow to act.  He also argued that the state had done 
a bad job as a power purchaser, contrasting the state's recent 8-year 
contract with Constellation for power at $150 peak and $59 off-peak with 
Enron's willingness last year to sell them power for five years at $50.  The 
Republicans also pressed Davis on why he attacks out-of-state generators but 
is not nearly as vocal about California munis who charged even more.  Davis 
said they should make refunds, too.

 3. While not saying Enron by name, Gov. Davis did make a comment about 
companies with "trading floors that compete with the New York Stock Exchange 
with meteorologists and very talented people" who might have the ability to 
find loopholes in the new order.  He said this in answer to a question about 
what FERC needed to do now that the new order was issued, and he said "watch 
out for manipulation" by those subject to the order.

 4. Sen. Thompson pressed Washington State AG Gregoire about why she appeared 
to be investigating out-of-state suppliers even though they had a small 
percentage of the market in her state, with lots of document requests and 
other investigative action, while not doing the same to others.  During that 
exchange either Thompson or the AG (I think it was the AG) said Enron had 
over $1 billion in sales to Washington State.  Enron was not on the list of 
companies Thompson or the AG said were subject to her information demands.  
She said she would be expanding her inquiry, though.

Highlights and Analysis

 1. As started at yesterday's Senate Energy hearing, the mantra from the 
Western Democrats was: we want our money back.  Chairman Lieberman and others 
pressed FERC about how California could get refunds and the same in other 
Western states, particularly Oregon and Washington.  Chairman Hebert said 
that the settlement conference process would allow all parties to raise all 
issues, including refunds in California and outside California.  He said that 
the conference could include issues that the commission could not act on 
itself, including refunds not otherwise allowed under the Federal Power Act.  
Chairman Lieberman vowed to keep the committee active in overseeing FERC's 
activities in implementing the new order, particularly as it relates to 
refunds.  While he acknowledged that new legislation could not apply to 
pending cases, he seemed inclined to pursue legislation to repeal the 60 day 
delay in the Federal Power Act relating to refunds.

 2. Commissioner Wood spoke of the need to increase the penalities and 
enforcement tools available to the commission, including the ability to order 
short suspensions of authority for regulated entities to transact business, 
treble damages, and other administrative penalties.  There was also 
discussion among the committee and commissioners about beefing up FERC's 
market monitoring capabilities so that it acted more like the SEC, FCC and 
FTC than it has in the past.

 3. The Democrats on the committee and among the witnesses said that FERC's 
latest order is a step in the right direction.  None of them called for 
legislative action on price caps as proposed by Sens. Feinstein and Smith.  
Sen. Murkowski had done a good job of taking the wind out of the legislated 
price cap sails by saying at the start of the hearing when he testified that 
the bill's sponsors had pulled back from swift action when they spoke at 
yesterday's hearing.  Davis did say the still thinks that cost-based rates 
are better, but he said the new order is "some price relief" and that it 
corrected the mistakes in the April order.

 4. There was some discussion of natural gas again.  Davis said that FERC 
should now turn its attention to natural gas.  He said that El Paso 
controlled too much of the capacity until recently.  He called on FERC to 
enforce laws against price manipulation.  (Note: we have had several back 
channel reports that the Lieberman committee intends to look into the El Paso 
and Williams cases now at FERC about alleged affiliate issues.)

 5. There was some discussion of the termination of the new FERC order.  
Lieberman pressed several witnesses about whether Sept. 2002 is too soon.  
Davis said it was and that they needed at least until the end of 2002 if not 
more time and that order should apply until California has enough new 
generation in place.  Hebert did not back down when pressed by Lieberman 
later in the hearing, saying there needs to be a deadline to get action on 
new supplies, however he and the others basically said they would revisit the 
issue if events warrant.

 6. Several times, Sen. Lieberman and others said they generally support 
deregulation, but that the effort to get more states to do so will never 
happen if the price situation is not brought under control and public 
confidence restored.

 7. Gov. Davis did throw a few kind words toward Pres. Bush and Pat Wood, 
saying that each was open to doing more about the high cost of natural gas to 
California, including the possible reimposition of rate regulation of 
transportation to California.  He said he liked Pat Wood and he noted that 
FERC did not take serious price mitigation action until the two new Bush 
appointees were on the commission.

 8. Lieberman asked the Washington State AG whether the Justice Dept. or the 
FTC were doing anything to address high energy prices.  She said not to her 
knowledge even though she has asked them to do so.  We can expect a 
Lieberman, et al request for Justice and FTC involvement going forward, I 
suspect.

 9. While Chairman Lieberman's tone and closing comments were in the nature 
of his normal thoughtful tone, it is clear that he and others see this as a 
major issue for them to ride.  He commended FERC at the end of the hearing 
for doing their best, but pledged he would stay involved, closing the session

Once again today I participated in the discussions on possible electricity 
legislation held in the offices of Majority Whip Tom DeLay with other 
interested parties including industry segments, public power and state 
regulators.  The other congressional participants were staff to Reps. Steve 
Largent and Chip Pickering.

After meeting all week (except Wednesday), the group was unable to reach an 
agreement or even a provisional consensus on what could be placed in an 
electricity title that could be added to the comprehensive energy package 
that the House Energy and Commerce Committee will begin to process next 
week.  Congressional staff will report to their bosses on the status of the 
discussions as of this afternoon and from there the Members will determine 
whether to proceed further.  There is a general perception that committee 
leaders will elect NOT to take up electricty legislation at this time and in 
the context of the broader package in the absence of broadly supported 
legislation.

In the end, the discussions did not bear fruit because divisions remained 
over the usual issues and along most of the usual fault lines.  As the drafts 
progressed during the week, we succeeded in deleting the original language 
that would have had Congress weigh into the bundled/unbundled and 
federa/state jurisdictional rules at the very time that likely adverse action 
in Congress could in turn adversely impact the Supreme Court case.

A last minute attempt was made by the congressional staff to stitch together 
a minimalist electricity title that would have included reliability (with the 
understanding that the NERC discussions could produce modifications more to 
our liking), PUHCA repeal, PURPA reform, interconnection language and federal 
siting.  However, in each instance there were one more politically relevant 
interest groups not willing to go along.  Cong. DeLay's staff also tried to 
link PUHCA repeal to those who had joined an RTO.

There was also an attempt to strip it down to reliability, interconnection 
and siting (eminent domain) -- but again there was either disagreement on the 
details or objection from those who favorite subject was left out of the 
minimalist package.

There was one rather interesting discussion when the public power folks 
floated language on market power that included a sentence that would have 
made the filed rate doctrine inapplicable to antitrust challenges to market 
rates.  Needless to say, I strongly objected as did EPSA and others.

As noted, the lack of an agreement reduces our exposure when the mark up 
occurs.  In the absence of an electricity title, refund, price control and 
other issues should not be germane to the package that the subcommittee will 
take up on Tuesday and the full committee next Friday.  That package will 
have five issues addressed: conservation, clean coal, hyrdo, nuclear and 
reformulated gasoline.  Details to follow once legislative language is 
released.

Per my first e-mail, here's MidAmerican's position letter on the stand alone 
Reliability measure.  Seems the best we can do with the utilities who have 
been supporting our position is to have them take a "no position" stance on 
the stand alone bill.

Congressman DeLay is with us.....but with the demise of Speaker Gingrich, the 
role of Committee Chairman has been reinstated.  Thus, this to-be Chairman is 
going straight to the Speaker which poses both a political and House Rules 
conundrum.  Of course, we are also going to the Speaker, the Majority Leader, 
etc.  But it becomes the "pet rock" game where one Member respects another 
Member's "pet rock" so that Member respects his "pet rock."  The one 
outstanding pressure point we retain is lame-duck Chairman Bliley who is on 
our side yet his relationship with the Leadership is poor while Congressman 
Tauzin's remains stellar.  You might recall that Congressman Tauzin switched 
parties with the price tag being many bennies and "secret deals" from 
Leadership.  As of today, Congressman Barton is also on our side (but with 
the death of his brother, his mother's open heart surgery, his wife's breast 
cancer scare, etc.) we have not gotten him to refocus on approaching 
Congressman Tauzin yet.  I will do this at the appropriate time.  I have kept 
Ed Buckham apprised of our strategies.

Rick:  unfortunately, the stand alone reliability legislation DOES have a 
"reasonable chance of passing."  To block this possibility, we are pursuing 
two strategies simultaneously.  #1 the Stakeholder letter with the message 
that the bill does little for reliability and provides no real political 
inoculation so should not be passed; and #2 the lack of consensus on the 
technical language contained within the bill makes passage problematic.  If 
the bill were to be able to move, the bill must be considered "consensus" 
otherwise it  will pose political problems for the Calendar.  Today, there is 
still lack of bill consensus.  We should consider a strategy of asking for 
reasonable legislative provisions beyond the current language which would 
improve the bill (and continue to keep true consensus from occurring.)  Of 
course, we cannot be obvious on this approach.  

Part of the reason I was pushing to get one or our CEO's to play golf with 
Congressman Tauzin on the 22nd is he is the key Member pushing the House 
Leadership to pass the stand-alone bill now to "politically inoculate 
Republicans."  As the likely new House Commerce Committee Chairman; he 
carries sway.  Another approach would be for us to call Entergy to give 
Congressman Tauzin the same message.

And our #3 strategy.....pray that the temperature cools down so the issue 
dissipates.....and/or they run out of time......

As discussed, should Congress upon its return after the Labor Day recess 
appear ready to move H.R. 4941, Congressman Wynn's stand-alone reliability 
legislation; a large group of stakeholders would sign and send the attached 
letter.  Although Enron would like the letter to be stronger, this letter 
went through many revisions to reach the consensus language necessary for a 
larger group to sign.  Thus, while not a perfect letter, it would send a 
stronger message with a multitude of signatures.

The status of the letter is that it is being "held in our back pocket" should 
it become necessary.  Pre-approval has been given and it stands in an 
"almost" final form.  Should you have any grave problems with the letter, let 
me know, and I will see what's possible given the constraints posed by the 
group.  

On a separate but related note, we are working with Joe and Dan to prepare a 
short white paper to detail the "technical problems" still remaining with the 
Wynn legislative language and will communicate these problems, Enron's 
opposition and lack of bill "consensus" to the Hill shortly (as soon as this 
paper is ready.)  I believe ELCON, EPSA and CMA will continue to share our 
opposition although confusion remains on the Hill as to the exact reasons for 
our opposition given the numerous versions of the legislation circulating.  
thanks.

This NERC announcement references that FERC would designate the new electric

Inter-RTO Seams, several of the Commissioners asked whether GISB and EISB 
were appropriate forums for the establishment of commercial/market business 
practices.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

The North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) and a broad-based
coalition of electric industry and state organizations urged members of
Congress and other key energy officials to support prompt passage of
federal legislation to promote and ensure the continued reliability of
high-voltage electric transmission systems in the United States and
throughout North America.  In letters to DOE Secretary Abraham, members
of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Representatives
Tauzin, Dingell, Barton and Boucher, and FERC Chairman Hebert, the
coalition stated that "It is critically important for Congress to act on
reliability legislation as soon as possible.  It will take many months
after legislation is enacted for FERC to adopt implementing rules and
designate the new electric reliability organization that the legislation
provides for.  In the meantime, consumers are exposed to increased risk
of failure of the transmission grid as more and more demands are placed
upon it."

For your convenience, a copy of the press release announcing the
coalition's support is shown below.

A copy is also posted on the following NERC web site:

If you have any questions, let me know.

Broad Coalition Supports Electric Reliability Legislation

The North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) and a broad-based
coalition of electric industry and state organizations urged members of
Congress and other key energy officials to support prompt passage of
federal legislation to promote and ensure the continued reliability of
high-voltage electric transmission systems in the United States and
throughout North America.  In letters to DOE Secretary Abraham, members
of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Representatives
Tauzin, Dingell, Barton and Boucher, and FERC Chairman Hebert, the
coalition stated that "It is critically important for Congress to act on
reliability legislation as soon as possible.  It will take many months
after legislation is enacted for FERC to adopt implementing rules and
designate the new electric reliability organization that the legislation
provides for.  In the meantime, consumers are exposed to increased risk
of failure of the transmission grid as more and more demands are placed
upon it."

For three decades, NERC and its member Regional Reliability Councils
have worked cooperatively and voluntarily to set reliability standards
for high-voltage transmission systems so that customers could enjoy
reliable electric service.  As electricity markets become increasingly
competitive, this voluntary arrangement will no longer suffice and needs
to be transformed into a mandatory system to assure a continued reliable
supply of electricity to America's homes and businesses. "Congress must
act soon on reliability legislation," said Michehl R. Gent, NERC
President and CEO.  "Enacting this legislation now is an important step
to ensure the continued reliability of the nation's high-voltage
electricity system, and one that should not wait."

Signing the letter are the North American Electric Reliability Council,
American Public Power Association, Canadian Electricity Association,
Edison Electric Institute, IEEE-USA, Large Public Power Council,
National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, National
Association of State Energy Officials, National Association of State
Utility Consumer Advocates, National Electrical Manufacturers
Association, National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, Northwest
Regional Transmission Association, Transmission Access Policy Study
Group, and the Western Interconnection Coordination Forum.

For more information on NERC or its transformation into NAERO, visit
NERC's web site (http://www.nerc.com/).  The web site also includes
information on the electric industry's electricity supply and delivery
programs and activities.
*********************

NERC is a not-for-profit company formed as a result of the Northeast
blackout in 1965 to promote the reliability of the bulk electric systems
that serve North America. It works with all segments of the electric
industry as well as customers to "keep the lights on" by developing and
encouraging compliance with rules for the reliable operation of these
systems. NERC comprises ten Regional Reliability Councils that account
for virtually all the electricity supplied in the United States, Canada,
and a portion of Baja California Norte, Mexico.

This morning, all 5 FERC commissioners testified before the Senate Energy 
Committee on yesterday's order and on the pending Feinstein/Smith legislation 
to impose cost-of-service rates on wholesale power.  Highlights and analysis 
are as follows:

1. Sen. Feinstein, the chief sponsor of Senate price cap legislation, called 
FERC's order "a giant step forward" and said she is "very grateful" for what 
the commission did.  Senators Gordon Smith and Barbara Boxer agreed.  Sen. 
Feinstein said that she and Sen. Smith would now recommend to Chairman 
Bingaman that next week's mark up of their price control bill be postponed 
"for the time being" pending how the order plays out in practice.  Chairman 
Bingaman said he would follow their advice and cancel next week's mark up.  
(Responding to a question, each of the five commissioners said that Congress 
should NOT act to pass Smith/Feinstein, at least at this time -- this 
included Comr. Massey, who has favored legislation in the absence of 
"stronger" action by the commission.)

2. However, it is very important to point out that House Democrats in 
California and elsewhere out West have not been as supportive of FERC's order 
as have the Senators.  House Democrats are still expected to attempt to offer 
a price control amendment to the supplemental appropriations bill when it 
comes before the House later this week.  Of course, the reaction of the 
Senate may undercut the House Democrats's argument, at least at this time.  
Furthermore, should prices go up and the FERC order is seen as not working, 
price control advocates, including Sens. Feinstein, Smith and Boxer, will no 
doubt pick up where they left off.

3. It will be very interesting to see how Senator Lieberman and Gov. Davis 
react to the FERC order at the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee hearing 
tomorrow morning.  While this committee does NOT have legislative 
jurisdiction over the Feinstein/Smith legislation, this hearing will be well 
covered by the news media.  Sen. Lieberman is a cosponsor of the 
Feinstein/Smith legislation.

4. In my view, the political and public pressure will now shift in large part 
-- at least for the time being -- from the legislative price cap proposals to 
the settlement conference process that the FERC order will set motion.  There 
was a clear drum beat at the hearing from the western senators, particularly 
Feinstein, Boxer and Cantwell (WA), for refunds either out of the settlement 
conference or ordered by FERC.  In essence, they are pressing to have the 
price mitigation formula in the new order applied to power sales that took 
place prior to the issuance of the order.

5. Another sense of the poltiical flavor is that Sen. Schumer (D-NY), while 
expressing his continued support for deregulatioin and competition, pressed 
FERC general counsel Kevin Madden (by this point the commissioners left for 
the RTO conference) about why the order applied only to the WSCC and did not 
apply nationwide.  Madden at least tried to distinguish the New York and 
California markets, but then said that Con Ed has filed pleadings with FERC 
to extend price mitigation to New York and he could not say any more about 
the matter.

6. Ranking Republican Frank Murkowski said he had received a letter today 
from four western governors -- those from Arizona, North Dakota, Utah and 
Wyoming -- saying that since FERC has acted, there is no need for Congress to 
pursue price control legislation.

There were a series of questions and comments on details and technical 
aspects of the orders.  I will do an e-mail on these items later today.   
Please advise if you have any questions or comments.

Re-read your reply.   Just wondering what it means to possibly add a provision, which I understand is a "may" -- dealing with FERC's authority to change existing RTOs.  Depending on what that means, it could seriously hamstring FERC's efforts for a 4-5 RTO model as sought and we support, by not letting FERC change "existing RTOs" (particularly if that includes pending, but not approved) to change.  For example, would the language under consideration block a Northeast RTO of PJM, NY and NE since PJM is "existing" and NY has filed?  What would be the rationale for such a serious limitation on FERC's authority?  Thanks.

Ran into a fellow Texas company lobbyist who said that the Chairman 
today is speaking to EEI CEO Conference you mentioned and he was going 
to release the bill or at least say the bill would include mandatory 
RTOs.  Just checking out the rumor.  Thanks.

John and I met with the group headed up by NERC that supports reliability 
legislation.  Included in the group are:  NERC, CEA, EEI, APPA, TAPS, ELCON, 
EPSA, PJM, Entergy.  The group is attempting to reconvene and indicate their 
continuing support for the reliability legislation (33 pages) that was 
drafted last year.  Enron, ELCON and EPSA did not support the final drafted 
legislation, although we are told that Enron (through Dan Watkiss) was close 
to giving its support.

This group still supports the legislation that was drafted last year and 
would like Enron to give its support as well.  ELCON has many concerns with 
the legislation, and EPSA is still on the fence (waiting to hear from us, I 
think).   John Shelk and I indicated to the group that Enron is reassessing 
the legislation and our position on the legislation.  Another meeting 
(conference call) is scheduled for June 15.   Enron seems to be somewhat of a 
linchpin in this debate -- the group thinks the legislation will be effective 
if Enron signs on, even without ELCON's support, but they seem to think it 
has less effectiveness without Enron.  Therefore, the group is very anxious 
to hear our position.

John and I are meeting with Dan Watkiss tomorrow to find out from him where 
we left off on the drafting.   We want to see how comfortable Dan was with 
the draft legislation and where he felt that changes were still needed.  We 
are then meeting with ELCON on Thursday to get a better idea of what their 
concerns are with the legislation (it seems to be a pretty long list).  I 
will send an email to this group on Friday letting everyone know what came 
out of these meetings and we can then discuss what position Enron should take 
in this group effort.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Sarah

Attached is Jim's prepared statement filed last night for today's House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee (Chairman Barton) hearing on reliability, transmission incentives and siting issues.  You will see we use the opportunity to make a plug for large RTOs as well.  Jim will actually deliver a five minute oral summary.  He is appearing as the EPSA witness in his capacity as chairman of the EPSA Regulatory Affairs Committee.  There will be ten witnesses on the panel.  Others will represent EEI, NARUC, APPA, LPPC, NRECA, NERC (David Cook), ELCON, Consumers for Fair Competition, and GF Energy.  We will provide a report following the hearing.

Jim:  Thanks for your update.   As you recall, Phil attended the April 2000 
Congressional staff trip to the Enron building.  Further,  for years we have 
negotiated directly with his boss on electricity legislative efforts and we 
have gained his support and leadership for Enron's positions.  We continue to 
constantly update him and all staffers on our positions.  We will continue to 
do so with yearly fact finding trips to Houston, meetings, letters, hearings, 
briefings, coalition building, ope-eds, etc.  Fact is, the California issue 
climaxed after federal legislation was declared "dead" for this Congress.  As 
such, other active legislative vehicles have claimed Congressional 
attention.  Thus, Phil was referring to a recent Senate hearing on the 
California situation (October 5th) where we supplied questions, information, 
etc. that no other member except Senator Gorton attended (i.e. low 
interest.)  Having said this, as the cycle ramps up after the elections and 
the new Congress convenes in January and February, Congressional interest 
will return with "understanding" California being a key focus.  Educating on 
the California situation will be amongst our primary objectives although in 
the Congressional downtime, we must continue specific efforts with key 
targets (i.e. Congressman Barton, Congressman Tauzin, Senator Murkowski, 
etc.).  This is why, for instance, I had requested travel approval to attend 
the Rippon Society's trip with the Speaker and these members in order to be 
able to take advantate of opportunities to educate in informal settings.  We 
will continue to find other opportunities and make opportunities to visit 
with these Members while they are out of D.C. between now and January.

As for Private Use legislation, Enron developed and led the strategy which 
brought EEI to the table with resulting final consensus legislation.  This 
consensus came very close to being added to the tax package which may move 
Friday but was dropped due to its high price tag.  As for NAERO, there is NOT 
consensus.  In fact, we support Senator Gorton's version of the bill but 
oppose Congressman Wynn's version.  Since Joe Hartsoe has been the lead with 
NAERO, I will defer further comment to him.  As for comprehensive 
legislation, the Senate came very close and indeed pass a bill out of 
Committee.  The issues that doomed the bill were the two "non-consensus" 
issues:   the native load exception and RPS (which indeed a deal was actually 
cut.)  In truth,  we also had cut the deal on native load exception but 
consensus came too late in the year for EEI and NARUC to formally sign-off.  
This is why we have tried to get the EEI process moving now.

Thank you again for your speech and the update.

Cynthia, et al --

FYI.  I was on a panel with Phil Moeller today in Las Vegas (he was the 
moderator).  Very nice guy.  No real issues developed.  I used (very 
liberally) Steve Kean's testimony in San Diego to talk about California and 
some material on RTOs.  My speech is attached below.

Phil indicated that he thought that there was agreement on the Public Power 
Tax issues and on NAERO language.  He highlighted that comprehensive language 
could be difficult if not impossible next year.  (Joe - can you please send 
me a copy of the NAERO bill and any summaries).

While Phil seemed to have a great sense of what is happening in California 
and the electricity markets, he indicated that many of his staff collegues 
were not so up to speed.  Any way that we can help them out before their 
minds are made up?

Jim

Late tonight, the Barton Subcommittee passed an energy policy package 
(without any electricity provisions other than those related to conservation) 
on a bipartisan vote of 29-1.  The subcommittee approved an amendment by Mrs. 
Wilson to conduct a national assessment and inventory of possible renewable 
energy projects.

During consideration of the bill, several amendments of interest and concern 
to Enron were offered and withdrawn; they are likely to be offered when the 
full Energy and Commerce Committee meets to consider the package next Tuesday 
and Wednesday.  The amendments in this category are:

1. Mr. Waxman has an amendment he called the "blackout and price gouging 
prevention amendment" that would require FERC to modify its June 19 price 
mitigation order within 15 days of enactment to impose cost-of-service based 
rates (with a rate of return of 15 percent) if an entity is found to be 
withholding power from the grid during an emergency.  The cost-of-service 
rates would thereafter apply to all of the offending entity's sales in the 
Western U.S.  Several of us were rounding up opponents to the amendment when 
it was clear he was going to offer it and before he decided to withdraw it 
until full committee.  We will continue those efforts before the full 
committee vote.

2. Mr. Ganske has an amendment on net metering that he said would promote 
wind in Iowa and other renewables (he may wait until an electricity bill 
rather than full committee on this bill).

3. Mr. Shadegg has an amendment to exempt natural gas pipelines from the 
requirements of the National Registry of Historic Places.  He said that 
currently this process holds up much needed pipeline expansions that are FERC 
approved.

4. Mr. Waxman has an amendment that would require the President to develop 
and implement a plan to achieve the greenhouse gas reductions called for in a 
UN agreement that President George Bush ("41") agreed to in 1992 (reducing 
these emissions to 1990 levels).

Chairman Barton indicated that the Subcommittee will take up an electric 
restructuring bill either later this month or early in September, depending 
on how long it takes to process this first energy package in the full 
committee and in the full House.

The Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee meet for almost six hours today and 
approved an amended version of H.R. 1647, Chairman Barton's emergency 
legislation to aid California, by a 17-13 party line vote.  The full Energy 
and Commerce Committee may take it up as early as next week (probably 
Thursday, May 17th).

The Subcommittee DEFEATED an amendment by Rep. Waxman (D-CA) to impose 
wholesale price caps for 18 months.  The amendment was defeated 12-20 with 
all Republicans voting against, including the three from California and Rep. 
Greg Walden (R-OR), who while seen as the last to decide to oppose the price 
cap amendment, was the most forceful and articulate in opposition to the 
amendment.  Also voting "NO" were Democratic Reps. Ralph Hall (D-TX) and 
Chris John (D-TX), with which we had met in recent days.  The final vote 
tracked our whip count going into the meeting.

Rep. Albert Wynn (D-MD) offered and withdrew an amendment to delete the 
"negawatts" provision.  There was bipartisan criticism that while the concept 
made sense, there were potential problems in terms of possible games playing, 
including end users being able to sell power while not actualy reducing their 
normal power levels.  Another member said that electric coops that are 
required to sell at cost could have customers then go out and resell that 
power and make a lot of money.  Several Members said businesses could shut 
down, put workers out of work and become energy marketers and make more 
money.  Chairman Barton made a forceful defense of negawatts.  While the 
amendment to strike was deleted, we will need to respond to these criticisms 
and shore this up before full committee next week.  There will be another 
attempt to delete at full committee unless these concerns are addressed in an 
amended version.

Ranking Democrat Rick Boucher (D-VA) offered and withdrew an amendment to 
reinstate FERC maximum prices for the secondary transmission market, thus 
reversing the Feb. 2000 FERC order.  This woudl last for 18 months.  
Chairman  Barton said he agreed with Boucher that there is a problem with 
what appear to be high gas transmission rates to California, but he disagrees 
with the proposed remedy.  He pledged to work with Boucher before Full 
Committee mark-up. We are obtaining a copy of this amendment and should 
analyze it ASAP for its potential impact on Enron operations.

Rep. Ed Markey (D-MA) offered and withdrew an amendment to impose a series of 
new tests to be administered by FERC all with the goal of discouraging spot 
market transactions, or at least what he would define as excessive use of the 
spot market, and at the same time encourage "deep bilateral mechanisms."  The 
mechanisms included a "market balance test" that would say only sellers with 
a commitment to the long term market could sell in the spot market at 
unregulated rates and "spot market circuit breakers" that would be triggered 
when reserves are low in a given market.  Chairman Barton said he likes the 
concept of a spot market circuit breaker, but felt that the amendment was too 
complicated to be evaluated today.  We will also pursue an analysis of this 
amendment since it will likely be offered again in some form.

Mr. Markey also offered and withdrew a "net metering" proposal that would 
establish federal interconnection standards for individual consumers who 
would want to use fuel cells and other renewable technology to put power onto 
the system.  It was interesting that those who opposed negawatts spoke 
favorably of net metering even though they are complementary.

The subcommittee by voice vote adopted a Walden Amendment to strike the 
section of the bill that would have required an RTO if 10 of the western 
governors approved it.  The debate was pro-RTO but the rationale for deleting 
the provision is that one is already being formed and Members from those 
states did not want to upset the work already under way.

A series of other amendments on other matters were offered and withdrawn, 
none of which relate to our activities.

Last night, Linda and I spent a fairly long time with Leon Lowery, Chairman Bingaman's chief electricity advisor, to discuss our concerns with the transparency and market-based rate language -- while at the same time commending the transmission access language in the draft and strategizing how to support the chairman in that regard.

We made progress on transparency, less so on market-based rates.

On transparency, Leon understands our concerns.  In a nutshell, he seemed amenable to amending the langauge to avoid the result of having to divulge transaction-specific, trade-specific information.  We persuaded Leon that was the impact of the initial language, although he initially said details would be left to FERC.  We persuaded him that if any data is to be provided, it MUST be only in aggregate form.  We also impressed on him that if, as he said, the intent is to leave details to FERC -- then more of the details should be left to FERC, not set by statute.

Leon strongly advised that we seek to craft language consistent with the above exchange that makes as few changes to the draft as needed to make the necessary corrections.  This will make it easier for Leon to navigate the internal waters of the staff.  (Sam Fowler, th chief counsel, is a drafting stickler).

Others should obviously weigh in and review this, but to facilitate internal comments (we need to get back to Leon today), here is my take on what he has in mind.  Under new sec. 218(b) (to be added to the FPA by bill sec. 413) (pg. 13), under "information required" we would rewrite paragraph 2 as follows:

(2)  each broker, exchange, or other market-making entity that matches offers to sell and offers to buy wholesale electric energy in interstate commerce to provide aggregate statistical information about its sales of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce.

The effect of the language change is drop the reference to sale prices of each sale of electric energy.  By leaving it as aggregate statistical information, this should give FERC maximum flexibility to permit indexes, etc.

As to the "timely basis" of information release (subsection (c)), the alternatives sent yesterday would require this to be done on the Internet after the end of the trading day.  If we can restrict this to aggregate data, question arises whether we want to concede that this would be done daily.  That suggests the data to be collected would be more than we would want, I think.  Here is a take on how we might suggest a revision to that language to give FERC more leeway:

"(c) TIMELY BASIS -- The Commission shall require the information required under subsection (b) to be posted on the Internet and updated as frequently as practicable and appropriate.

The change is to add "appropriate" so that FERC can consider other than whether posting is practicable.  The use of "appropriate" is what came to mind -- perhaps there is some other word or phrase like "consistent with ..." or "promote competition" or some way of saying there are policy considerations other than practicability.  There should be some valid purpose established before data is released.  I would argue that the (d) language on commercially sensitive information goes only to exempting from disclosure, not when disclosure is appropriate.

Please let me have your thoughts, although the tragedy in NYC and DC now underway will probably make this not a day to transact such business on the Hill.

Will provide a further report on market-based rates.  In sum, Leon was not as sympathetic on this issue, but asked for our ideas and further arguments.  We sense Leon personally feels strongly about moving the FPA to some linkage to competitive markets.  His argument is that market participants can be doing everything by the book and the result can still be uncompetitive markets.  We pushed that penalizing us is not the answer -- nor is increasing regulatory uncertainty about deals doing to help keep prices down.  Leon clearly does not intend this language to punish Enron -- but others who we might all agree have done things that are not in keeping with competitive markets.

Confirming earlier indications, at about 3 pm EDT today, Chairman Tauzin 
convened the committee to issue a joint statement with Rep. Waxman and then 
recessed the committee subject to the call of the chair following the 
Memorial Day Week Recess.  Congress will not return until the week of June 4, 
but staff level discussions will likely occur after the three-day weekend.

Chairman Tauzin said that the committee is receiving conflicting information 
on the facts in California.  He said it is better to take a little longer to 
get the facts straight and evaluate various options, rather than act quickly 
but in the wrong way.  He did say he expects that the committee will come to 
a bipartisan agreement after the recess.

Behind the scenes, we hear that Democrats appear not to want to reach an 
agreement, instead preferring to keep the issue alive.  Republicans, on the 
other hand, want to spare their vulnerable West Coast Members another 
recorded vote against price caps.  Thankfully, following our collective 
efforts yesterday, the discussion has moved off of the 80/20 long term 
contract requirement.  Republicans are poised to offer the Ose bill as an 
alternative for discussion and amendment if an agreement is not reached.  The 
Ose bill would extend FERC's pricing formula to 24/7 and throughout the West.

Staff report that Members were far from agreement and that no one concept was 
embraced for further refinement.  It does appear, however, that some Members, 
such as Rep. Mary Bono (R-CA) are pushing for some type of price mitigation 
that they can vote for.  With Republicans increasingly worried about the 
political impact of the energy issue, we will need to continue our work next 
Tuesday, starting with an in-depth analysis of the Ose bill.

MEMORANDUM

TO: EPSA Legislative Affairs Committee
       NAERO Working Group

FROM: Scott A. Weiner, Legislative Affairs Committee Chair
            Donn J. Salvosa, Manager of Government Affairs
            Mark Bennett, Senior Manager of Policy

DATE:	September 18, 2001

RE: Reliability Legislation - New Drafts

A number of proposed bills addressing the reliability issue have recently been circulated.  Senate Energy and Natural Resources Chairman Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) recently distributed a draft electricity title to a comprehensive energy bill.  The reliability section of the draft is attached.  The House Energy Subcommittee chaired by Rep. Joe Barton (R-TX) has also circulated language which is attached.  Additionally in response to concerns expressed during a recent EEI CEO meeting, EEI has circulated their own legislative proposal, absent participation from NERC and its consensus group.  Their draft is based on the NERC bill, but contains several significant changes as noted below. This is also attached for your review.  

Senator Bingaman's language encompasses only two pages.  The legislation simply grants to FERC authority to develop and enforce standards.  FERC may choose to adopt any NERC proposed standard.  Lastly, FERC can delegate enforcement of standards to NERC or an RTO if it chooses to do so.  

The House four page draft version of reliability language proposes to do the following: 

- Establish an Electric Reliability Organization (ERO), subject to FERC 
  approval; no Affiliated Regional Reliability Entities (ARREs); it is unclear 
  whether FERC could approve multiple EROs.

- ERO files proposed standards or modifications with FERC, which can 
  approve or remand for further consideration.
- ERO would enforce standards and impose penalties, subject to FERC 
  review.  FERC can assign authority for a given region to an RTO.  Also, 
  FERC on its own can order compliance and penalties.  

- ERO to take "appropriate steps" to coordinate with Canada and Mexico; 
  President to use "best efforts" to reach international agreements.

The EEI proposal includes the following points:

- FERC would establish and maintain jurisdiction over EROs and an 
  appropriate number of ARREs.  FERC can choose to direct the ERO to 
  develop or modify standards.  

- EROs develop standards subject to FERC approval.

- ERO, under FERC direction, will delegate authority to regional entities.  
  This presumably can include ARREs or RTOs.  ERO and appropriate 
  entities would enforce standards.  FERC can also enforce and impose 
  penalties.  

This past Tuesday, EPSA staff meet with Bobby Lamb and Craig Glazer, representatives from PJM, to discuss PJM's legislative proposal.  It was clear from the meeting that there is flexibility to make changes, which could address our areas of concern in order to gain our support.  For example, they told us that some parts of the proposed bill were written to gain support from groups who then favored the NERC bill.   With the recent circulation of other versions of reliability language, they invited us to suggest changes to their reliability language.  The meeting revealed that EPSA's and PJM's views are very similar, and that a potential opportunity exists to develop a better alternative to the NERC Bill.

We are holding a conference call on Thursday, September 20, 2001, at 4:00 P.M. (EDT) to discuss these opportunities and possible new legislative initiatives.  To access the call, dial 1-800-937-6563.  Ask for the Mark Bennett/EPSA Call.  If you have any questions or concerns please contact Mark Bennett or Donn Salvosa at 202-628-8200.

See e-mail exchange between Andy Black of Barton staff and me (below).  Seems to confirm what he told me a few weeks ago -- and rumor that Barton told EEI yesterday at their CEO conference -- that his draft will make RTOs mandatory.

Charles --

Thanks for the reply.  Your thoughts on the EEI draft in terms of details would be helpful.  As I read it, we still have the problems with the EEI draft that we had with the NERC draft on which it is based -- deference, regional rules variances, regional reliability entities, regional advisory boards, limits on FERC authority, etc., etc.  It would also be helpful to have input on whether the plans for EISB could go forward if legislation like the EEI bill were enacted into law.  It would seem not since the "SRO" would focus only on "reliability" as defined by how the bill defines what matters are subjects for an "organization standard."

I guess the point of debate is what is meant by "self-regulating" ?  Can we live with such a name in the language - as long as the language has all the hooks to FERC and other regulators? ( No deference, etc.)  If the language is there that we want - then from the other guys' side, what do THEY see left in the name "self-regulating"?  I think we need to understand this before we can be comfortable with any type of support for "SRO".

Subject:	EPSA/EEI on Reliability


This follows up on Rick's inquiry late last week on the talks between EPSA and EEI on reliability.  Yesterday I spoke with Mark Bennett and Donn Salvosa of the EPSA staff.  Mark did the talking.  The upshot is that EPSA and EEI are meeting to see if they can't agree on reliability legislation.  EEI is working off of the NERC draft and has sent a version to EPSA dated 9/14 (see attached) that was the basis for last Thursday's meeting.  EPSA is now doing some drafting of its own.

I need to read the 9/14 draft, but the fact that they are working off of the old NERC language is of considerable concern.  EPSA staff emphasizes the value of having EEI off the NERC reservation (which is good in terms of showing that there is NERC "consensus"), but I think EPSA staff may be "too flexible" in how they are approaching it.  I reminded them of our position and concerns and of Jim's prepared statement on EPSA's behalf filed for the Sept. 11 Barton hearing.  EPSA staff claims that other EPSA members are OK with them embarking on this project.

It is not clear if this effort will succeed.  EPSA staff said EEI's board insists on having engineers do reliability, which is objectionable to EPSA.  EPSA staff seems to think that some type of reliablity SRO is inevitable and that it is wise to get the best one they can.  I will check with some other EPSA members.

John -- Kevin Presto, head of East Power Trading, had these comments:

Under Title IV Electric Reliability Standards -- Kevin says, "NERC should be eliminated."

Under Title V Subtitle B Environmental Disclosure: -- Kevin says that the "uniform reporting to consumers, in monthly electric bills, of the known energy sources" is not good because it supports day-ahead source requirements for retail suppliers.  Enron advocates the ability of customers to choose how to source their portfolio, whether from bilateral contracts done on an ahead basis or purchases in the spot market.  

John, the renewable portfolio standard provisions later in the draft bill may alleviate this concern, but I don't know enough about how that works.  Several years ago credits were discussed as credits that accrued to the clean energy generator and it can trade those credits.  Therefore, the seller of clean energy to endusers would need to have a certain amount of clean credits in order to claim it sold clean energy (meaning that the clean generator was supported by the marketplace since sellers needed a certain amount of credits).  That program recognized that you can't specifically source a clean generator to a load because electricity doesn't flow that way.  Thus, portfolio sourcing could continue and clean energy is supported.  But I don't know how this bill's provisions would work.  You probably have the Enron experts on this (used to be Janel G.)  Thanks.

John -- Couple comments
Transmission (Federal and State Jurisdiction:)-- I did not fully understand "States have no jurisdiction over transmission facilities, and this provision prevents large industrial customers from tying directly into the transmission grid and avoiding state charges."  There is bypass to the interstate pipelines now.  It seems that industrials should be able to connect to the interstate grid, especially when they have onsite generation that they want to sell into the grid.

Market Power -- Market Monitoring: In the SE RTO mediation, I raised this possibility about FERC having regional offices and being the market monitor instead of establishing these elaborate MM structures.  Everyone thought that this is a Day 5 or 6 possibility and many of the munis and coops really want the elaborate structures (separate MM company, etc.), at least initially.

Electricity Supply: Interconnection Standard:  "pay direct costs"  -- direct costs should not include network upgrades that benefit other customers of the grid.  FERC recently issued an order in a Consumers case that said interconnection customers do not have to pay the network upgrades (they are rolled into rates).  This is something Enron encounters on most every interconnection we attempt -- the utilities typically put in all kinds of costs and try to direct bill us.

Federal Electric Utilies:  TVA power sales:  "Limit TVA wholesale power sales outside the region to sales of excess power..."  Under the current scheduling rules (day ahead balanced schedule requirement), TVA could have alot of latitude and discretion in what it calls "excess".  If we get the congestion management we want, this would be less of a problem.

	Regulation of TVA trans. system:  "(TVA has argued Federal law prevents..."  I thought TVA was saying it is difficult for TVA to join an RTO, not impossible under current law (they raised the letter that BPA apparently received encouraging it to join an RTO).

Real time pricing is good. 
Thanks.

Attached is the draft EPSA position letter on the Bingaman bill that came out of yesterday's EPSA Leg. Affairs Committee meeting yesterday afternoon.  It expresses strong support for the transmission/open access provisions, while noting six areas needing improvement, including the  two we have noted most especially -- market-based rate authority and transparency.

I think the letter looks fine, but we have any comments or changes we need to get them to EPSA on Monday.  Please advise if you have any concerns about the letter.

It would not be accurate to conclude or assert that the NERC language is 
"close" to congressional approval.  Here is the state of play.  There are two 
interrelated tracks at present: the DeLay, et al negotiations of all 
stakeholders (which I attended and participated in today but did not concern 
reliability) and the NERC process that is underway to consider how to bring 
those such as Enron that are not "on board" with the so-called "consensus" 
NERC language (Sarah participated in the Tuesday meeting on this issue, where 
PJM put a proposal on the table that Sarah advises largely tracks our draft; 
this process will continue next week and a follow up meeting the week after).

The interrelationship is that it is likely that IF (a big IF) there is an 
electric title that is added to the congressional bill that will start moving 
in the House subcommittee next week, the NERC version will be included as a 
"place holder" with the understanding that if the NERC discussion process 
yields a different result, it will be substituted.  Furthermore, those who 
oppose the NERC version would be free to continue opposing it on the Hill and 
elsewhere.  So you might say there is a rebuttable "presumption" of sorts in 
favor of the NERC version (which is shorter than the old NERC version) 
because so many groups favor it, but those who oppose it such as ourselves 
continue to seek allies for a shorter, streamlined version. Congress is far 
from approving any final version.

Earlier this week, the House passed S. 1937 which authorizes BPA to sell 
wholesale electric power to joint operating entities whose members were BPA 
customers as of January 1, 1999.  Those groups would then be barred from 
re-selling the power.  The bill is now headed to the White House for the 
President's signature.  A copy of the engrossed bill passed by both the House 
and Senate is attached.  Please feel free to contact us should you have any 
questions.

Rick - Linda is tied up with Rick and Mark.  She asked that John and I get with you today so we can get final approval for the transparency language.  Leon with the Committee called us this morning seeking our thoughts.  Give us a ring when you have a chance and then we can follow up with Loiuse.

Thanks - Chris
 


Attached reflects our efforts to further tighten the language on transparency.

Attached below is a 9 page summary of what Chairman Bingaman intends to use as a Chairman's Mark going into further mark up of a comprehensive energy bill next week.  Electricity provisions are in  Division B that starts on page 2 of the summary.  I also have the 70 pages of legislative language for electricity issues, which I have started to review.  As noted below, there are certain issues we will want to read very carefully on the legislative language.
 
Highlights --
 
 
1.    FERC has jurisdiction over transmission component of retail sales.
2.    FERC may order transmitting utilities to join RTOs.
3.    FERC jurisdiction extended to munis, coops and federal utilities.
4.    Reliability section is actually better than the summary sounds.  The summary says FERC will defer to NERC.  The actual legislative language in a page or so only, says FERC shall handle reliability and MAY defer to NERC or to RTOs.
5.    FERC may order a generating utility that is found to have market power to submit a mitigation plan.
6.    On market transparency (THIS ONE WE NEED TO READY VERY CAREFULLY), FERC is to establish an electronic system for real time information on wholesale and transmission services, including prices.  The text appears broader thatn the Wyden-Burns bill we support.  The impact on EOL and ENA needs to be assessed ASAP.  I will fax this language shortly.
7.    PUHCA and PURPA repeal.
8.    Increases BPA borrowing -- but subject to appropriations -- which may undermine it.
9.    Real time pricing and net metering.
10.  FERC may allow market-based rates but only if the seller does not market power and sells into a competitive market.
(NEED GUIDANCE ON ENA AND EOL IMPACT HERE, TOO.  Will include legislative language in fax.
11.  Refund effective date under Federal Power Act is changed to date of filing of complaint.
12.  Interconnection standards.

Ken talked with Barton.  

Barton will not be signing the letter
The leadership met and decided "since they are going to be in session anyway" they would try to pass an electricity bill.
Barton is now targeting a mid Dec markup
There is a meeting tomorrow at 3:00 between Wood and Tauzin; Barton was supposed to be in Dallas.  Ken urged him to stay for the meeting (not clear if he will).
I got the impression from Ken that part of the reason Barton is not sending the letter is that he thinks he will be passing a bill anyway (not necessarily that he disagrees with the substance of the letter).

Below are copies of the prepared statements of commissioners Wood, Massey and Breathitt for this afternoon's House hearing on electricity issues.  The witnesses are the four FERC commissioners on one panel and the Deputy Sec. of Energy on a second panel.  Chairman Wood's statement is very strong on RTOs and why a few, larger ones are needed for economic and security reasons.  The only troublesome note is he describes the recent mediation proceedings as "encouraging."  However, elsewhere he refers to voluntary RTO formation in the past tense, saying "the Commission can go further and require them" (although he raises the likelihood of litigation unless Congress clarifies the Commission's authority in this area.  I will provide a more detailed report after the hearing.
 
P.S.  Since the commissioner's statements are in word perfect, you will need the right computer software or know how to reformat them.  If you have any trouble, please advise.  This is the format in which we received them.  Thanks.
 
John

Below please find the letter sent to Senator Bingaman from a number of stat=

islation. =20
[This letter can also be found at the following link: <http://www.nga.org/n=
ga/legislativeUpdate/1,1169,C_LETTER>D_2539,00.html]? ? ? ?  <http://www.ng=
a.org/cda/images/NGALOGOBW.GIF>??  ??September 13, 2001 ??The Honorable Jef=
f Bingaman?Chairman?Energy and Natural Resources Committee?SD-364 Dirksen S=
enate Office Building?Washington, 20510-6150??RE: Electricity Legislation ?=
?Dear Chairman Bingaman:??The undersigned groups representing state and loc=
al governments would like to begin a dialogue with you to discuss creative =
measures for responding to electricity restructuring issues.??As you know, =
the National Governors Association passed the attached policy at their Annu=
al Meeting in Rhode Island earlier this month. The National Governors Assoc=
iation (NGA) policy reaffirms the Governors' opposition to a legislative pr=
oposal which would establish federal eminent domain authority over electric=
ity transmission facilities. The Governors also agreed to establish a task =
force to provide a forum for states, the private sector, and the Administra=
tion to examine and discuss ways to ease bottlenecks in the transmission an=
d energy infrastructure system. Late last year, the National Conference of =
State Legislatures (NCSL) updated its National Energy Policy which was form=
ally adopted August 15 at its Annual Meeting. This policy reinforces its op=
position to Federal preemption of state authority over electric facility si=
ting. Also at its Annual Meeting, NCSL adopted an Energy Regionalism policy=
 that supports states working together to address siting and reliability co=
ncerns on a regional basis. In addition, by letter addressed to you dated J=
uly 23, 2001, the NCSL reiterated its strong opposition to federal eminent =
domain authority for electricity transmission lines. And in July 2001, the =
National Association of Counties (NACo) adopted a Resolution on National En=
ergy Policy outlining county officials' opposition to FERC eminent domain a=
uthority without the provision of specific requirements that strengthen the=
 role of counties in planning for the siting of these lines. The report pre=
pared for the Western Governors Association entitled, "Conceptual Plans for=
 Electricity Transmission in the West," also provides new avenues for devel=
opment of transmission facilities. Finally, as the attached "Electricity Po=
licy Principles" document, organizations representing virtually every organ=
ization of state and local officials affected by electricity restructuring =
have spoken with one voice that the regulation of rights of way necessary f=
or expanded utility infrastructure should remain with state and local gover=
nmental officials. In short, action is occurring at the state and regional =
level.??Before any decision is made regarding federal siting legislation (i=
ncluding eminent domain authority), it should first be established through =

Rick:  unfortunately, the stand alone reliability legislation DOES have a 
"reasonable chance of passing."  To block this possibility, we are pursuing 
two strategies simultaneously.  #1 the Stakeholder letter with the message 
that the bill does little for reliability and provides no real political 
inoculation so should not be passed; and #2 the lack of consensus on the 
technical language contained within the bill makes passage problematic.  If 
the bill were to be able to move, the bill must be considered "consensus" 
otherwise it  will pose political problems for the Calendar.  Today, there is 
still lack of bill consensus.  We should consider a strategy of asking for 
reasonable legislative provisions beyond the current language which would 
improve the bill (and continue to keep true consensus from occurring.)  Of 
course, we cannot be obvious on this approach.  

Part of the reason I was pushing to get one or our CEO's to play golf with 
Congressman Tauzin on the 22nd is he is the key Member pushing the House 
Leadership to pass the stand-alone bill now to "politically inoculate 
Republicans."  As the likely new House Commerce Committee Chairman; he 
carries sway.  Another approach would be for us to call Entergy to give 
Congressman Tauzin the same message.

And our #3 strategy.....pray that the temperature cools down so the issue 
dissipates.....and/or they run out of time......

Subject: RE: Draft Letter to Congress on Wynn Reliability Legislation

As discussed, should Congress upon its return after the Labor Day recess 
appear ready to move H.R. 4941, Congressman Wynn's stand-alone reliability 
legislation; a large group of stakeholders would sign and send the attached 
letter.  Although Enron would like the letter to be stronger, this letter 
went through many revisions to reach the consensus language necessary for a 
larger group to sign.  Thus, while not a perfect letter, it would send a 
stronger message with a multitude of signatures.

The status of the letter is that it is being "held in our back pocket" should 
it become necessary.  Pre-approval has been given and it stands in an 
"almost" final form.  Should you have any grave problems with the letter, let 
me know, and I will see what's possible given the constraints posed by the 
group.  

On a separate but related note, we are working with Joe and Dan to prepare a 
short white paper to detail the "technical problems" still remaining with the 
Wynn legislative language and will communicate these problems, Enron's 
opposition and lack of bill "consensus" to the Hill shortly (as soon as this 
paper is ready.)  I believe ELCON, EPSA and CMA will continue to share our 
opposition although confusion remains on the Hill as to the exact reasons for 
our opposition given the numerous versions of the legislation circulating.  
thanks.

Just a quick note to let you know the team involved in this decision.  In addition to your meetings on Wednesday, our outside consultant, Ed Gillespie played a huge role with the White House, as his note below discusses.  Ed Coats in our Tax Department and Chris Long in DC did all the leg work and much more over the past year on this.  And of course, this thing is still far from a done deal...despite the President's announcement.  In the days ahead we will be calling upon many of our Houston team to help out.  So I may be calling!

I have read through the 19 pages of Administration comments on the Bingaman draft electricity bill released last month.  Here are the main items in a quick bullet format so you have the flavor of them.

Delete provision on federal jurisdiction over bundled/unbundled (they don't offer a reason).  We of course agree for tactical reasons.

Add a provision to authorize FERC to order wheeling in States that open retail markets.

Add a provision to allow FERC to issue wheeling orders on its own motion based on an informal hearing rather than an adjudicatory hearing as under current law.

Make it clear that the Federal Power Act does not affect the authority of a State to require retail competition (the comments say some utilities have tried to argue that the FPA prohibits states).

The provision giving FERC power to order RTO participation should be deleted.  The comments raise drafting question.

The changes to the FERC merger review sections of the FPA should be limited.

"FERC lite" should be extended only to state municipal utilities and cooperatives, not the Federal utilities.  The FERC should authority over the Federal transmission systems equivalent to FERC authority over public utilities (with special BPA rules).

No need to legislate on market-based rates (we oppose the Bingaman language anyway, so this is helpful).

Interconnection language should be limited to transmission facilities, not local distribution.

No objection to streamlined reliability provision (this is good for us).

Remedial measures for market power should be deleted.

Administration to provide legislative language on federal transmission siting provisions, which they want to retain.

Not convinced there is a need for market transparency rules because FERC and DOE already have enough authority.

Administration supports even tougher criminal penalties.

Recordkeeping under PUHCA repeal should be clarified.

Federal purchase requirement for renewable energy should be deleted.

No objection to real-time pricing standard.

Net metering should be limited to small residential renewable facilities.

Do not support federal renewable portfolio standard (but could clarify state authority to adopt same).

Key questions about the infrastructure security legislation that I believe need further clarification and which I'm raising with both INGAA and committee staff.


Section 4   Background checks:

section (a) Secretary of Energy, in cooperation with the Attorney General, shall establish a program to enable entities operating critical energy infrastructure facilities to --

	
Enable is problematic.  The bill is silent on penalties for those who could take advantage of the system, but choose not to.  Further, it offers no liability protection for those who do take advantage of the background check system.  It offers us a service, but no positive incentives to take advantage of it.

section (b) Secretary of Energy shall issue reg's -

(1) identifying the positions subject to background checks; (2) establishing the conditions for the use of information and (3) providing each individual subject to fingerprinting under the section with the right to complete, correct, and explain information contained in the criminal history prior to any final adverse determination.


I read (3) as potentially establishing problematic, drawn out, and potentially costly legal battles.


section (c)  DOE recovers full cost of the program through fees charged to submitting entities.


How much will they charge us?


section (e) Definitions   subsection (2) gives a two-part definition of sensitive position:

The term sensitive position means a position in which an employee has access to --

(A) critical equipment, the incapacity or destruction of which would have a debilitating impact on the operation of a critical energy infrastructure facility; or

(B) sensitive information, the disclosure of which would compromise the security of a critical energy infrastructure facility


I believe definition B needs work.  That could apply far more broadly, even to lobbyists and gov't affairs people, than simply to those who work day-to-day with infrastructure.


Section 5 provides relief from FOIA and other public disclosure requirements that would reveal sensitive information.


Section 6 provides a process for getting anti-trust protections when industry works together on infrastucture protection initiatives.

Linda:

Attached below is language for a national renewable energy credit trading 
program.  I've also attached talking points on the purpose, background and 
benefit of this program.  This program would be a big win for us, and I'm 
glad to assist you and your staff in any meetings to promote this program.  

After comparing the definition of renewable energy under title IX, Sect 981, 
it is nearly identical to the democratic draft.  Therefore, I don't have any 
changes to the definition at this point.

Regards,
Stacey

I have received confirmation from Senate staff that the Senate Democrats on the Energy Committee met this morning and tentatively decided to go along with Chairman Bingaman's desire to move up the mark up of the electricity title from later this month as earlier expected to next Thursday, Sept. 13.  They are not sure they can do it all in one day.  Acting on 9/13 as desired now depends on the reaction of the committee's Republicans.  Not sure they will cooperate with moving quickly.  I am on my way to the Senate for an RTO meeting and expect to obtain a copy of the draft electricity language implementing the Bingaman White Paper; the language was just distributed to committee members this afternoon, but I understand that Bingaman's staff had worked on it behind the scenes with Comr. Massey.  Will advise once I have it hand.

John
