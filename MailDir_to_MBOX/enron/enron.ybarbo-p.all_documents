Capt. Kvammen,

Thank you for the update.  It looks as if all is now going according to plan.

I have made arrangements through your agents Barwil to arrive in Sur during 
the day of March 20.  I will be in the Mercur hotel and will come on board as 
soon as possible after Hoegh Galleon has docked at Qalhat.

Regards,

Tony Galt

Phil,

Yesterday we had our call to nominate the April LNG ship delivery.

We decided to nominate our five day window between April 4 thru 8.  PREPA is 
forecasting a 75% dispatch thru that period.  If the dispatch is 75%, we 
forecast that we would be running out of LNG about on the 8th.  Typically, we 
nominate with a few days cushion against the late delivery date.  We decided 
not to have a few days cushion for  the following reasons:

1. We avoid a cash flow shortfall of between $1-5 million (depending on the 
ship size) prior to April 16, 2001.

2. Inventory projections are based on 100% power plant availability.

3. Based on lastest loading schedules, Cabot is expected to respond with 
April4-6 delivery window.

4. There is sufficient LPG available to cover several days of LPG operation.

5. In the event that PREPA dispatches higher than 76% (and exposes themselves 
to SFP), volumes that we have made available to PREPA are priced at 
$6.75/mmBtu, which should cover our LPG costs.  Additionally, the volumes 
made available would only allow dispatch at about 87%.  We are prepared, if 
necessary, to significantly increase the price of any additional volumes made 
available to discourage dispatch above 87%.

Although our nomination should take care of a cash flow shortfall in April, 
we will have a problem in May (prior to May 17, 2001) unless we receive 
insurance money.  If we have a problem in May, it is not clear to me that we 
will be able to draw on the DSR as debt service payments are due only in 
March, June, September, and December.

Our insurance strategy must now include getting at least a partial payment in 
April.  Jaime please undate the cash flow (we will need this to address the 
Lenders recent request for an update) and advise us of our options assuming 
we will have a cash flow shortfall in May.

Rick

Subject: Re: questions on COU  

Jane

I have a few answers for you.

1- The Puerto Rico Ports Authority has jurisdiction and designates a 'Port 
Captain' for the harbors of Guayanilla, Tallaboa and Ponce. I am not sure of 
the full extent of the Authority's functions and /or regulatory authority ( I 
am trying to find out ) but you should be able to get this information 
through your local agent.

2- Although it appears that Attachment A has not previously been prepared, it 
was intended to be a verbatim listing of those marine transportation-related 
requirements that were set forth among the 47 listed items in the Appendix 
(Titled 'Environmental Conditions and Mitigating Measures') to the FERC's 
Order of May 15, 1996, granting EcoElectrica authorization under Section 3 of 
the Natural Gas Act.  Among those which would be included are items #23 and 
#24 relating to the sea turtles and manatees. I will try and get this for you.

3- While there is no reference to an 'Emergency Response Plan' in the COU, 
Eco does have one (Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plan - SPCC) 
that was prepared under 40 CFR Ch. 1 (7-1-99 Edition) and submitted to  the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. This  would be consistent with section 
7.1

4- The insurance requirements in Sec. 2(b) (viii) of the Sales Contract are 
general in nature. The insurance requirements in the COU, a multiple party 
agreement, contemplated by, but beyond the scope of the Sales Contract, 
supplements the Sales Contract provisions and apply to the liability limits 
set forth in COU clause 10.

5- With regard to your comments about clauses 11 and 12 you have a point. We 
will try and work on  a modification in order to reduce your concerns.


I hope this helps. Please let me know if you have any questions.

BR/TP

Subject: questions on COU





Todd - I have some questions on the COU.

   Is there a relevant "Port Authority" at the EcoElectrica terminal?  If not,
   why is this contained in the document?
   In Section 2.1, is there an Attachment "A"?
   Do the LNG Interests have an Emergency Response Plan?  Does this Plan have
   references to actions required in 7.1?
   Do the insurance requirements of the "vessel interests" duplicate or 
override
   what is required of Cabot LNG in Section 6.2 of the sales contract?  Should
   the LNG interests provide same insurance documentation?
   Ditto Section 12

These are my simple questions not intended to begin a negotiation.  I am only
trying to gather all information.  Please call me for other comments.

Jane

Item 5 under Significant Plant Modifications Proposed says you are  examining 
design changes required to install a mooring line tension meter and  ship 
approach velocity meter on the dock(???).
?
What is the rationale for why you feel these two items are needed and can  
you tell me how they work and what happens if they measure beyond some set  
point.? What are the set points you want to measure and why??  Thanks.

Dear Tony,

Please be advised that the cooldown operation itself is going well.
We lost abt 12 hrs during our purge operation of tks 2 and 3 due to
the requirement of the CO2 content in the return gas. The limit was
abt 50 ppm.  The reason for this is that the plant is normally
sending the returngas back to the process and to avoid any icing in
the system.

Commenced purging tk 2 and 3  :11th 0240
Completed    :12th 0250  (CO2 90 ppm, allowed to
start cooldown)
Commenced cooldown tk 3 and 4 :     0300

Now, 1800lt 12/3, tks 3 and 4 is down to - 79 and -81 C respectively
and we expecting to be finish with the cooldown itself within 5 hrs.
Then cooling down the cargo line ( 1hr ), loading (2 hrs), paper work
and dept (2 hrs).  The remaining tks will be cooled down during the
voy. to Bahrain.

Etd 13th 0400lt
Eta Bahrain 14th 1700lt

Re yr travelling to Muscat/Sur

Have advised the agent, Towell Barwil, that you are arriving
Muscat/Sur in connection with the first loading. Kindly advice the
Agent (PIC Mr. Irwin Peiris), abt. yr travelling details and they
will arrange for transport and hotel in Sur.

Reverting.

Dan:  Please find the lastest 90 day schedule from Atlantic as of March 2, 
2001.
Please ignore the scheduling of the "P" deliveries for now.  This was ALNG's
work and we have not agreed to this designation.

Per our phone conversation on Friday, we will plan on receiveing the
"Methane Arctic" with approximately 68,500 M(superscript: 3) about April 2.
This should hold us until the last part of April or first part of May.  We
will put out the official nomination as usual on March 12.

Dan,

Ref, yr e-mail dated 1/2-01 re above subject.

Our intention is to use our own strainers with 20 mesh.  That should
catch all bolt, nuts and other debris.

Will revert with more info to Steve Couch, CMSEnergy, re mooring and
interface work sheet as soon as I am back from the gas trial "Hoegh
Galleon".  I am joining the vessel in Singapore on the 15th.

The vessel left the yard to day, 13th, for the sea trial. Up to now
everything has gone smooth.

Best regards

Capt Kjell Kvammen

The "Matthew" discharged 2,702,390 MMBtu at Lake Charles.  After taking out 
the 1.75% terminal fuel expense, we will have 2,655,098 available for our 
sale to ENA.  We have sold ENA 2,666,000 for March on this deal, so we need 
to buy 10,902 MMBtu to cover the shortage.

The attached spreadsheet allows you to easily calculate Eco's year-end LNG 
inventory for a variety of cases that vary dispatch rate, # days of outage 
for CT1, and number of cargoes diverted between now and year-end. Simply 
enter your assumption for number of days of CT1 outage in cell A16 and the 
number of cargoes you want to divert in cell A23. The year-end inventory is 
automatically calculated. A negative number means that you require more LNG 
than you are entitled to receive.

Assuming that you want the LNG tank full at year-end:

1. Eco will be able to receive 100% of the remaining 6 cargoes if the CT1 
outage is 60 days or less

2. 175 days of CT1 outage are required to result in Eco being able to divert 
1 cargo and still have a full tank at year-end

3. a 60-175 day outage for CT1 results in surplus LNG but whether or not it 
is enough to market depends on how much the outage exceeds 60 days

The above figures assume a 76% dispatch and 95% availability on days that Eco 
is not assumed to be in an outage.

Thanks Todd.  This is obviously an important document and I want to get 
something  in place asap---preferably before the next cargo of LNG.  Each 
cargo that comes in without this document in place weakens our position and 
increases our exposure if there is a problem while the ship is in port.

Subject: Cabot - COU

Gerg,

As you know, I have been insisting with Jane Michalek about the Conditions Of 
Use agreement for some time. For one reason or another they have been putting 
it off. Today they told me that they want to do the agreement jointly with 
us, the operators of the 'Matthew' and Weismuller the tug company. She also 
informed me that they are in the process of finalizing those contracts and 
should be forwarding them to Baker & Mckinnsey next week. After that they 
will be in a position to sit down with us and negotiate a COU. Also, I heard 
from them and my contacts inside Tractabel that they should close thier deal 
some time next week.

Subject: Revised Draft Cabot Letter

Further to Dan's meeting with Rick late this afternoon I have amended the 
previous draft sent to Todd et al this morning .

 I have also included language to refute the claim made by Cabot that the 
facility is "infirm"  because it is not capable of receiving at the contract 
rate  during this commissioning period. Although there is no express 
provision regarding commissioning rate in the contract , according to 
industry practice the  rate at this time may be understandably  lower but 
this does not give them the right to direct the vessel elsewhere as long as 
we are paying demurrage. TODD , I AM ASSUMING THIS TO BE THE CASE, SO PLEASE 
DELETE/MODIFY THIS PARAGRAPH IF THERE ARE RATE/ OTHER ISSUES OF WHICH I AM 
NOT AWARE.  

   Attached please find the draft which should, per Rick's instructions, be 
sent to Cabot via fax Saturday morning in accordance with the notice 
provisions of the LNG Sales Contract. I have not forwarded this revised draft 
to EdisonMission. In the mean time any further comments should be directed to 
Todd.

Chris-
We agree with your calculation for the reconciliation for the year 2000 with 
a net amount due Enron of $187,351.39.  Per our agreement, we will short pay 
the April 2001 demand charge invoice (inv # 01040001)by this amount.  The net 
amount we will pay on this invoice is as follows:
 Amount due on Apr '01 Dem Charge $1,914,760.56
 Credit from 2000 Reconciliation  <$187,351.39>
 Net due April 17, 2001   $1,727,409.17

You can send us the actual credit invoice for our records next week when you 
get back.

Thanks and regards,
Dan Masters

Here is the last email I have.
The difference with regards to the shipment on 13-14th September., is that
the figure you were using(2,630,718mmbtus) was calculated using the disport
analysis, instead of the load port analysis which is how all of the other
reports are calculated. I will fax you a copy of the  report.

Chris,

I have reviewed your reconciliation spreadsheet and have discovered a
discrepapancy  regarding the "Matthew" delivery on September 14, 2000.  It
appears that a volume, other than the discharge volume, is being applied to
calculate the average heating value.  My calculations show that the average
heating value for this Setpember 14 delivery should be 22.47, as opposed to
22.61.
Despite this one discrepancy, we match perfectly.
I have attached my reconciliation spreadsheet below for your convenience.
I show that Cabot owes EcoElectrica $209,472.88.
Please review and let me know if you are in agreement.
Regards,

Dustin Collins

Larry,

The approach speed indicator you refer to that is currently used is not 
intrinsically safe and should not be approved for use by the FERC or USCG. 
The system we are recommending is similar to the one being used in India and 
other ports and is an integrated system. The additional cost of including the 
approach speed indicator with the tension monitoring and quick release is 
minimal compared to an incident. Larry Snyder and Tony Galt can give you more 
information on the need for this and the cost effectiveness.

Subject: Re: Last report


Larry - Please add your comments/corrections and forward on to Victor. 

Approach velocity metering is currently hand held and portable and will  
remain so. ?No permanent equipment is planned for installation. ?The purpose  
of the equipment is to measure the ship's approach velocity as it is nearing  
the mooring position. ?The velocity should not exceed 6 inches per second as  
it contacts the breasting dolphins. ?If the ship were to impact the dock at 
a  
greater velocity, then a subsequent inspection should be performed to  
ascertain whether or not damage to pier pilings had occurred. 

The metered mooring hooks have been recommended but not specified nor  
procured. ?The metered hooks would allow close monitoring of ship's forces 
on  
the dock during unloading and the data would allow for the ship to adjust  
forces on the dock, and this controlling the ship's position, by precise  
application/use of ballast and intermediate adjustment of mooring lines. 
This  
feature, by providing precise information on the forces (and motion) of the  
ship relative to the dock would allow for greater precision in positioning 
of  
the ship at the optimum vertical and horizontal position relative to the  
unloading arms and avoidance of undue forces on the unloading arms. 
This feature would reduce likelyhood of perc valves discharging and  
disconnecting of the ship during unloading. ?In summary, it's an information  
system that provides for a higher level of control of the unloading process. 

Regards,

I suggest that you use this note in your response to Jane and that it really 
is not necessary to discuss further with Gene at this point BUT do not send 
the note as is. FYI -  On the subrogation issue I have sent you the language 
from the Malaysia COU where the relief from subrogation was amended to be 
reciprocal at the insistance of the Malaysians. So we have accepted this 
concept in other COUs. See note where Mike says that he assumes we would be 
o.k. with this kind of change except that the clause talks about an incident.

Greg, attached is the response from Cabot after Eco tendered the draft COU. 
Cabot stated that they disagreed that Article 6.4 (a) of the LNG Sales 
Contract requires Cabot to sign a COU . Nevertheless Cabot stated in the 
final paragraph that they are willing to enter into an agreement with Eco 
covering all or some of the matters proposed in the conditions of use. In the 
last two sentences they stated that they were reviewing the COU but that 
agreement clearly could not be reached by the July 10th delivery date.  (We 
at Enron recognize that the COU may require negotiation on some points and we 
are ready and eager to get the negotiations going. )

 Todd will fax you copies of the 2 letters from him to Cabot regarding the 
July 10th and August 14th deliveries and other correspondence between himself 
and Cabot. Basically in the 2 letters referenced above we stated that despite 
our attempts to schedule a meeting and complete the COU , this had not been 
achieved and while we appreciated that the Cabot merger was in process we 
considered  this matter urgent. We stated our position that the LNG Agreement 
provided for such execution and that acceptance of a ship at the terminal did 
not represent a waiver of any of our rights pursuant to that agreement. We 
again requested that Cabot attend to this matter prior to the next shipment.

Should Cabot bring up the issue of whether COUs are industry practice, you 
may want to raise the fact that this facility is different from others in the 
US which are FERC regulated and have tariffs which address some of the issues 
raised in the COU. ( In other parts of the world where there is no "FERC" , 
COUs are common industry practice. )Since Cabot has agreed to sit down with 
us I would not recommend a debate on the legal/contractual requirements per 
se. Threatening them with breach of contract or telling them they cannot 
deliver is not a practical or commercial solution . 

  Our concern now is that having had 2 ships deliver without having a COU in 
place and now likely a third next week, we may be weakening our position that 
we have not waived any legal rights . 

My understanding is that Rick wants a commitment to get this done - 
regardless of the current Cabot / Tractobel situation . I will e-mail you 
again the draft COU and also a comparison of our legal position with /without 
the COU for your general information.

Joe/Chris-
I have received your invoice for the Feb 13 delivery of the "Methane
Arctic".  I do not agree with the split as it appears on the invoice.  For
the Winter Cargo portion billed at $4.323264, there should be 55,924.321m
(superscript: 3) which corresponds to 1,252,745 MMBtu.  The remainder to be
billed at $3.483097 is 6,086.467m(superscript: 3) which corresponds to
136,341 MMBtu.  Please recheck your figures and revert.

Thank you,

Joe-
Confirming our conversation, since the "Winter Cargo" is being delivered on
two Methane Arctics, we need to paper split the volumes on the 2nd one
between the winter cargo price and normal price.  Using the volumes for a
standard cargo from the contract, the winter cargo should be 119,000 m
(superscript: 3).  The delivery that just finished was 63,075.679 m
(superscript: 3).  That leaves 55,924.321m(superscript: 3) on the next
delivery to be priced at the winter cargo rate and the remainder to be
priced at the normal rate.

It would have been preferable to work these numbers out in advance rather 
than after the fact, especially considering that it seems we already had by 
our phone conversations and my email to you dated February 7.  Since we 
received no correspondence to the contrary, I assumed the numbers to be used 
would be per that email.  Please revert with your response.

This is the base number we are working with.  The Arctic delivered 1,415,921

Capt. Kvammen,

Thank you for the details on the bunkering.
Please note that Todd Peterson has resigned from Enron.  Mr Paul Y'Barbo has 
assumed Todd's responsibilities.  Paul's e-mail address is in the list of 
recipients of this message (above).
Please also copy Mr. Jim Fernie on messages to Enron relating to the Hoegh 
Galleon.  Jim's address is listed above.

Further to our phone conversation of earlier this morning, I will await your 
e-mail updates on the progress of the "Hoegh Galleon"
before finalizing my travel arrangements to Muscat.  My current plans are to 
arrive on Muscat the evening of March 19th, and hope to travel to Sur during 
daylight on the 20th to be in place for when the vessel arrives on the 21st.  
If the schedule changes I will adjust my travel plans to suit.

Best regards,

Tony Galt

Dear Todd,

LNG/C "HOEGH GALLEON"  - BUNKERING

Please be adviced that we bunkered in Singapore F.O. 3500 mt and G.O.
80 mt.  Due to the time press we did not bunkered to capasity.
Based on the above the ROB will be on delivery abt.:
F.O.  3800 mt and G.O. 150 mt.

According to my calculation this should be sufficeint to reach for
bunkering at Suez on ballast leg.

But, our plan is to topping up  with F.O. ,abt 1900 mt, before
loading at Qalhat March 21st, if time permit.

Kindly advice.

Best regards

Jaime-
I am just going by the contract which shows two banking days after receipt of 
invoice.  There is no way to get a payment out today, as it takes a day or 
two to work invoices through our system.  How about if I pay it the way the 
contract stipulates and if there is a difference to be settled, we can net it 
against our next fuel management payment?

The price was reduced to accomodate a transfer of funds two days after 
completion of discharge. The final discharge was completed on March 11th, 
therefore we were expecting to see the money today. Therefore, if payment is 
not until Thursday we should be increasing the price.

Todd,

The attached calculations are using a Year 2000 PR-CPI of 180.525 (this is 
not obvious because of formatting). The Cabot contract does not specify how 
many decimal places to use. Do we have anything worked out with them 
regarding rounding of the PR-CPI?

Subject: Methane Artic Discharge 2/12-13

The discharge of the LNG cargo was sucessfully completed this morning at 
approximately 5:30 AM.  The ship sailed at around 9 AM today.  Below are the 
highlights of discharge.

At around 1:20 AM the UPS system (Uninterruptible Power Supply system) failed 
causing loss of power to alarm and control system.  This activated ESD and 
unloading was safely shutdown with no problems.  It took approximately 2 
hours to identify the UPS system as the problem, bypass the UPS so power was 
supplied directly from line (not through UPS) and restart pumps to full rate 
unloading.  Bypassing UPS only required throwing switch to line setting as 
system is set up to accommodate problems with UPS.  Eco will investigation 
the UPS system to correct the problem.
Eco had planned on loading liquid nitrogen (LN2) to the ship before cargo 
discharge started.  Eco had a preliminary procedure they had prepared for LN2 
loading.  Coast Guard had not reviewed a procedure for LN2 loading so wanted 
staff to review the document before LN2 loading.  It was agreed LNG unloading 
would proceed and LN2 loading would occur after cargo discharge was 
completed.  A copy of procedure was sent to Coast Guard's San Juan office for 
staff review.  Within  2 hours the Coast Guard had approved loading the 
liquid nitrogen after the cargo discharge was completed.  Eco will prepare an 
official procedure and submit it to the Coast Guard as an addition to the 
procedures previously submitted.
Eco had pre-cooled the LN2 line in preparation for loading onto the ship.  
The line was allowed to warm up and cooldown occurred the next morning (13th) 
during the cargo ratedown.  Once the last cargo pump was shutdown the loading 
of LN2 began.  The LN2 transfer went very slowly.  The Methane Artic used a 1 
and 1/2 inch stainless hose to connect Eco's loading line to ship's 
manifold.  Eco's line is a 3".  It was obvious the ship was in a hurry so 
they decided that after increasing the level in one of its' two tanks by 
approx. 11% that they had enough LN2 and ceased the loading operation.  
Disconnection of the vapor and LN2 lines were completed and the ship sailed 
shortly thereafter.  The ship loaded very little LN2 and obviously didn't 
really need much although they were low (only 29%  in one tank).  
There were several minor leaks at flanges in the LN2 loading system.  Leaks 
were small and nitrogen safe so loading was not stopped for warming up line 
and tightening the bolts.  These leaks were identified and flanges will be 
tightened during the next week.
With the problems of the UPS failure the operators forgot to shutdown the 
sample collection system.  This will probably result in a bad composite 
sample.  I have already discussed with Victor Vega the need to have a person 
only follow the LNG sample collection and analysis during the entire period 
of the cargo discharge.  They would have no other responsibility.  I had 
previous had discussion with the Eco chemist Luz regarding a testing program 
to take place after this discharge to give additional support to prove the 
sample system works.  I will follow up this week to ensure test takes place 
within the next week.  I will need Eco's management support with scheduling 
this.

Subject: Methane Aritc Discharge 2/12-12

One item I forgot to mention was that there was high winds for approx. 45 
minutes during the early part of the cargo discharge (around 3-4 PM) on the 
12th.  Wind speed gusted to 38 knots.  The guidelines given to the coast 
guard for wind speeds was a sustained wind speed of 30.8 knots for stopping 
cargo discharge.  When the winds came up to the 30.8 Eco started discussions 
with ship's chief mate and contacted local weather agency to get an idea of 
weather forcast.  Winds were not expected to remain at the extremely high 
level for very long and ship maintained itself alongside, so the discharge 
continued with constant monitoring of the situation..  If it had been a 
Moss-Rosenburg design ship, I would have recommended that Eco shut down the 
unloading until the winds subsided.  

The Coast Guard rep. was aware of the conversations which took place between 
the ship and shore and was pleased with how Eco handled the situation.

Subject: COU

Dan is not available today but asked me to get back to you on his behalf re 
way forward on  Cou with Cabot . Basically he supports our earlier advice 
that we try to get an agreement prior to the next delivery on the terms we 
have proposed. We appreciate that that may be difficult given Cabot's 
corporate situation and its disinclination to accept the terms. If Cabot is 
suggesting something other than what we have proposed (ie knock for knock ) 
they should revise the agreement to reflect this and we can consider. Again 
it will not be easy to get them to do any revision before the next delivery. 
Suggest that you call Paul Parish and discuss with him the effect of a knock 
for knock as you understand Cabot's position to be and then discuss this with 
your commercial team.

We suspect that we may again be in same position we were last delivery , in 
which case at a minimum we will have to send Cabot a similar letter saying 
that we are not waiving any rights. If by chance we have come to agreement 
verbally but have not a full agreement in place it would be wise to state the 
agreed principles in a letter pending completion of the definitive agreement. 
Nancy

Good Morning Puri:  We have been diligently working on your below request, and
can now offer the following instructions.

Next Loading date for Pt Fortin currently scheduled for AM of 30 March 2001.  
As
for heel quantity, we must take into account the  transit  (8 days) from 
Boston
to Pt Fortin, and still allow for sufficient heel to keep tanks cold on 
arrival,
I suggest in way of 1000 cubic meters, and ask for Masters input in this 
regard.

Expected unloading date at Penuelas is 02 April 2001.  Vessel should plan on
departing Pt Fortin Am of 31st March and adjust speed so as to arrive Penuelas
Pilot Station at 0530/0600 02 April.

As always, noon position reports are requested, and the normal points of 
contact
at ALNG and Cabot be advised.

Upon departure Boston on 22 March, Master must make notification directly to
ECOELECTRICA, and our Agents in Puerto Rico (Luis-Ayala) providing ETA to both
Pt Fortin to Load, and then further ETA to Penuelas.  Noon reports on ballast
voyage to Pt Fortin, and loaded voyage to Penuelas must also copy ECO, and
Ayala.

I know the Master has all of the relevant POC information for the above, so I
will not include it here.  Should you have any further questions, please so 
not
hesitate.


Best Regards
Joe McKechnie

Gentlemen,

As our March cargo has been diverted to Lake Charles I do not see the need 
for a conference call today. I will nominate tentative date for April and May 
which we can revise next month. As an  indication I will nominate the 1-5 
April followed by another cargo 35-40 days later. These dates are consistent 
with the current planned outage and a dispatch rate of between 76% and 85%. 
If anybody has and any questions or comments please let me know.

TP

The usual payment terms of PDVSA are 30 days after bill of lading.  We should 
pay Enron, who is our seller, 30 days after bill of lading plus monthly 
adjustments accordingly to market index movement.  We are better protected by 
paying as we did on the last cargo.  We should follow Paul's recommendations 
which are being discussed with Suzanne and her group.  

Our cash flow forecast shows that we will be short by $800M depending on the 
market index movements and after paying $397M of import tax, $156M of rent 
and $164M of property tax.

Subject: Re: Next Cargo  

If we worked out a price structure similar to the last cargo, we could 
eliminate the price risk by paying the following for the LPG:

1400 MT at a Fixed Price (represents amount borrowed that went to April sales)
2900 MT based on May Mont Belvieu plus Premium 1
2800 MT based on June Mont Belvieu plus Premium 2 and
2900 MT based on July Mont Belvieu plus Premium 3

The Fixed Price for 1400 MT and the Premiums 1,2, and 3 are under discussion 
with Suzanne. This structure matches the cost of product with ProCaribe's 
sales revenue.

Question: How does ProCaribe get paid for the 15 days of product that goes 
with the Progasco sale?

Subject: Next Cargo

Our next cargo has a loading window in PDVSA on May 18, 2001, with an ETA in 
ProCaribe on May 19 - 21, 2001.  The cargo is for 10,000 Mts. (5.2MM gallons) 
at MB + 7 three days around bill of lading.  This means that the invoice will 
be the average price of MB on the loading day, the day before and the day 
after, excluding weekends and holidays, plus 7 cents a gallon.

The following are the monthly sales average per customer:

* Progasco  1,100,000 gallons
* San Juan Gas     210,000 gallons
* Centro Gas                  140,000 gallons

Total borrowing return to EcoEl,ctrica 3,200 Mts or 1,667,200 gallons on 
5/19/01.
 
After returning all the borrowing (5/19/01) we have a balance of 3,480,233 
gallons.  The following are the estimated sales and heater consumption per 
month:

* May (12 days)    563,520 gallons (from May 20th through May 31st)
* June (30 days)  1,408,800 gallons 
* July  (31 days)  1,455,760 gallons

Inventory balance as of: 7/31/01 (52,153 gallons).

Next cargo arrival delivery window July 20 - 31, 2001.

average they have been seeing is about 1160 mb absolute. For reference, we 
calculated that the "LNG Jamal" that we brought in on Feb 21 was at 1119 mb.  
Ron says that arrival pressure has not caused any delays at CMS so far, and 
that he does not expect us to have a problem or any delays even at as high as 
1160.  I would suggest we give orders to arrive no higher than 1160 to 
minimize boil-off, please let me know if this is acceptable and I will pass 
it on to the ship.

On the heel, we are not planning on making the decision until a few days 
before discharge so that we have the latest information on possible delays as 
well as bunker prices and such.  We did a calculation and came up with a 
figure of around $100,000 incentive to heel out and run bunkers on the 
ballast voyage as of today's numbers.  We will continue to monitor this as 
the discharge time gets closer.

Do we need to include in the orders that the arrival cargo saturation 
pressure not to exceed  1100mb ? ( whatever is TLNG's max. ). I believe the 
heel decision should wait until a few days before unloading to ensure before 
heel out we are sure we have a load window that will allow the extra time to 
cooldown again and we figure in the full cost to Enron of the cooldown LNG 
that would have to be purchased from OLNG.

Based on today's closing NYMEX prices there is $1.9 MM of price difference 
between EcoElectrica's 2002 Winter Cargo Commodity Charge plus Commodity 
Surcharge and the delivered cost of 83,000 CBM of LNG. That is $5.61 vs 
$4.61. This assumes we pay a day rate of $50,000/day for the vessel, Jan '02 
NYMEX is $5.41, and the FOB price for LNG is $2.66. 

Let's stay in touch about the possibilty of landing a spot cargo into Puerto 
Rico in January. As we discussed, how we play this with Cabot is a big issue. 
There could be an additional $4.7 MM of value that could be captured by Eco 
if Cabot were unable to release its right to not deliver a Winter Cargo. 
Also, let's continue to think about how we make the logistics work and how we 
can get Cabot's cooperation if needed.

Also, note that Eco may need 2 cargoes of this size to make it until the 
Early Spring Cargo.

Where/when does the vessel have to take bunkers if it skips the topping at 
Fujairah ? What's the price differential ?

Dear Dan.

Due to the time schedule and uncertainty regarding the eta Fujairah,
we desided to not nominating bunkers for topping up this time.
The vessel's rob on arrival Qalhat will be abt F.O. 3800mt and G.O.
155 mt.

Jane-
Per our phone conversation on Friday, we will plan on receiveing the "Methane 
Arctic" with approximately 68,500 M3 about April 2.  This should hold us 
until the last part of April or first part of May.  We will put out the 
official nomination as usual on March 12.

Oscar,

Per our conversation, the following are the fuel management team's 
assumptions of fuel requirements for Eco at 100% of capacity:

LNG   91,260 MMBtu/day at 507 MW    Heat Rate = 7500 BTU/kwh

LPG   1905 Metric Tons at 507 MW     Heat Rate = 7461 BTU/kwh    (Note: 522 
gallons/MT   ,   91,300 Btu/gallon)

No.2   619,000 gallons/day at 465 MW   Heat Rate = 7313 BTU/kwh    (Note: 
131,850 Btu/gallon)


Heat rates at less than 100% of capacity will be different from those at 
100%. Check with Rick or Arthur regarding performance curves.

Call me if you have any additional questions.


Regards,

Paul

Jaime-
I am just going by the contract which shows two banking days after receipt
of invoice.  There is no way to get a payment out today, as it takes a day
or two to work invoices through our system.  How about if I pay it the way
the contract stipulates and if there is a difference to be settled, we can
net it against our next fuel management payment?

Dan:

The price was reduced to accomodate a transfer of funds two days after
completion of discharge. The final discharge was completed on March 11th,
therefore we were expecting to see the money today. Therefore, if payment
is not until Thursday we should be increasing the price.

Sounds like a great trip.

I'm going to have to work on Renee about diving. Masks (anything around her 
face) make her claustrophobic (spelling???). She can wear a ski mask, 
however, so she can probably get used to a scuba mask.

Have a great time.

Do we need to include in the orders that the arrival cargo saturation 
pressure not to exceed  1100mb ? ( whatever is TLNG's max. ). I believe the 
heel decision should wait until a few days before unloading to ensure before 
heel out we are sure we have a load window that will allow the extra time to 
cooldown again and we figure in the full cost to Enron of the cooldown LNG 
that would have to be purchased from OLNG.

Subject: COU Answers


Todd --

Following are some thoughts on Jane Michalek's questions.  We've discussed
these briefly with Gene (who is out of town on business); I expect he'll
first become available by Wednesday evening.  In the meantime, feel free to
contact me by e-mail (kurmanm@arentfox.com) or telephone (202/857-6345) if
you'd like to discuss.

Regards.

Question 1.    Is there a relevant "Port Authority" at the EcoEl,ctrica
terminal?  If not, why is this contained in the document?

Answer: Based on our previous inquiries, it is our understanding that the
Puerto Rico Ports Authority (referred in the document) has jurisdiction, and
that the Authority has a designated "Port Captain" with responsibility for
the harbors of Guayanilla, Tallaboa and Ponce.  We have not previously
determined the full extent of the Authority's functions and/or regulatory
authority.

Question 2.   In Section 2.1, is there an Attachment "A"?

Answer: Although Attachment A has not previously been prepared, it was
intended to be a verbatim listing of those marine and transportation-related
requirements that were set forth among the 47 listed items in the Appendix
(titled "Environmental Conditions and Mitigating Measures") to the FERC's
Order of May 15, 1996, granting EcoEl,ctrica authorization under Section 3
of the Natural Gas Act.  Among those which would be included are items #23
and #24 (relating to manatees and sea turtles).

Question 3.  Do the LNG Interests have an Emergency Response Plan? Does this
Plan have references to actions required in 7.1?

Answer:  An "Emergency Response Plan" is not referenced in the COU, and we
are uncertain as to the status regarding development or implementation of
any such Plan -- either from the Coast Guard perspective or that of the FERC
(see, e.g., item #45 of the FERC's Environmental Conditions and Mitigating
Measures).

Question 4.  Do the insurance requirements of the "vessel interests"
duplicate or override what is required of Cabot LNG in Section 6.2 of the
sales contract? Should  the LNG interests provide same insurance
documentation?  Ditto Section 12.

Answer: The insurance requirements in Section 6.2(b)(viii) of the Sales
Contract are general in nature. The insurance requirements in the COU -- a
four-party agreement contemplated by, but beyond the scope of, the Sales
Contract -- supplement the Sales Contract provisions and apply to the
liability limits set forth in COU Clause 10.

Regarding insurance documentation under Clauses 11 and 12, we assume that
the LNG Interests could agree to mutual obligations (see, e.g., Clause 11.2
as to documentation by the Vessel Interests).  However, we note that the COU
is essentially geared towards an "Incident," and as an Incident is caused by
an LNG Tanker, the Vessel Interests are the focus of Clauses 11 and 12.

Dear Tony,

You have may already left Houston for Oman.
But, please be adviced that we left Bahrain today, 18th, at 1800lt
for Oman.
We have now tested the steering gear and the result comply with the
SOLAS requirements.

As you may know, we also received the LOC from the USCG yesterday,
17th.

We are expecting to arrive off Qalhat on the 20th abt 2400 and we are
ready to berth any time after that.



See you in Qalhat.

Chris,

I have reviewed your reconciliation spreadsheet and have discovered a 
discrepapancy  regarding the "Matthew" delivery on September 14, 2000.  It 
appears that a volume, other than the discharge volume, is being applied to 
calculate the average heating value.  My calculations show that the average 
heating value for this Setpember 14 delivery should be 22.47, as opposed to 
22.61.  

Despite this one discrepancy, we match perfectly.

I have attached my reconciliation spreadsheet below for your convenience.   I 
show that Cabot owes EcoElectrica $209,472.88.

Please review and let me know if you are in agreement.

Regards,

Dustin Collins

Todd,

I will remind Hiro to resend the draft COU for our review. He emailed the 
draft in December but we were unable to open the document. With respect to 
the cool down cargo I intend to wait until we have an agreed plan for DPC 
supply before discussing the cargo with OLNG. Our intent is to make sure the 
cool down cargo is a pre-lift of DPC's fixed quantity obligation regardless 
of the contract start date.

Any news on the COU and the redacted Kogas implementation procedures? 

Also, what are you telling them about the first cool down cargo that EE&CC  
are requesting for the 1st of Nov 01.

Subject: Revised Draft Cabot Letter

Further to Dan's meeting with Rick late this afternoon I have amended the 
previous draft sent to Todd et al this morning .

 I have also included language to refute the claim made by Cabot that the 
facility is "infirm"  because it is not capable of receiving at the contract 
rate  during this commissioning period. Although there is no express 
provision regarding commissioning rate in the contract , according to 
industry practice the  rate at this time may be understandably  lower but 
this does not give them the right to direct the vessel elsewhere as long as 
we are paying demurrage. TODD , I AM ASSUMING THIS TO BE THE CASE, SO PLEASE 
DELETE/MODIFY THIS PARAGRAPH IF THERE ARE RATE/ OTHER ISSUES OF WHICH I AM 
NOT AWARE.  

   Attached please find the draft which should, per Rick's instructions, be 
sent to Cabot via fax Saturday morning in accordance with the notice 
provisions of the LNG Sales Contract. I have not forwarded this revised draft 
to EdisonMission. In the mean time any further comments should be directed to 
Todd.

Rudy-
Per our conversation last week, the "Methane Arctic" will be delivered on
to EcoElectrica on April 2, but you had mentioned the possibility of
adjusting the due date for the invoice.  We didn't discuss an exact date,
but the plant would like to see a due due date of April 17 if that works
for you.  Please advise.

Thanks,

If we worked out a price structure similar to the last cargo, we could 
eliminate the price risk by paying the following for the LPG:

1400 MT at a Fixed Price (represents amount borrowed that went to April sales)
2900 MT based on May Mont Belvieu plus Premium 1
2800 MT based on June Mont Belvieu plus Premium 2 and
2900 MT based on July Mont Belvieu plus Premium 3

The Fixed Price for 1400 MT and the Premiums 1,2, and 3 are under discussion 
with Suzanne. This structure matches the cost of product with ProCaribe's 
sales revenue.

Question: How does ProCaribe get paid for the 15 days of product that goes 
with the Progasco sale?

Subject: Next Cargo

Our next cargo has a loading window in PDVSA on May 18, 2001, with an ETA in 
ProCaribe on May 19 - 21, 2001.  The cargo is for 10,000 Mts. (5.2MM gallons) 
at MB + 7 three days around bill of lading.  This means that the invoice will 
be the average price of MB on the loading day, the day before and the day 
after, excluding weekends and holidays, plus 7 cents a gallon.

The following are the monthly sales average per customer:

* Progasco  1,100,000 gallons
* San Juan Gas     210,000 gallons
* Centro Gas                  140,000 gallons

Total borrowing return to EcoEl,ctrica 3,200 Mts or 1,667,200 gallons on 
5/19/01.
 
After returning all the borrowing (5/19/01) we have a balance of 3,480,233 
gallons.  The following are the estimated sales and heater consumption per 
month:

* May (12 days)    563,520 gallons (from May 20th through May 31st)
* June (30 days)  1,408,800 gallons 
* July  (31 days)  1,455,760 gallons

Inventory balance as of: 7/31/01 (52,153 gallons).

Next cargo arrival delivery window July 20 - 31, 2001.

Clay,

Per our call, I am giving below a brief account of what happened at site 
yesterday:

At 02:33 hours on 9th April 2001, a failure occurred while both the 32 inch 
lines were under pneumatic testing.
The pressure at the time was 23.8 BARg; ultimate test pressure planned was 
25.2 BARg.
The event appears to have occurred between bent 4 and bent 1 (at the seaward 
end of the jetty).
No personnel were at risk; the planning and safety procedures were being 
observed.
A total of thirty personnel were on duty, involved in the test at the time of 
occurrence and well away from the point of failure; an exclusion zone of 850 
metres was in effect as planned.

Initial Assessment:
Extensive impact bents 4 to 1; all pipework supports and plinths in this area 
are a loss. 
No visual evidence of impact  to unloading arms, or control building at the 
jetty head.
No immediate evidence of impact on jetty superstructure.
Internal inspection of pipelines from point of failure to shore is underway.

Actions taken:
Response team assigned.
Insurance assessors notified and due to reach site today.
Design and certain vendor assessments initiated.
Assessment of jetty structure initiated; detailed check of all facilities 
beyond the jetty to be conducted.

Most of the above is based on what Lingtec (the LNG Construction Contractor) 
has reported to DPC.  Please appreciate that these reports are preliminary.  
Lingtec is expected to make a detailed update during this week.

Should you have any further queries, please do not hesitate to call me.

Best regards,
Shubh

Dear Dan.

Due to the time schedule and uncertainty regarding the eta Fujairah,
we desided to not nominating bunkers for topping up this time.
The vessel's rob on arrival Qalhat will be abt F.O. 3800mt and G.O.
155 mt.

Subject: CMS dates for Oman spot cargoes

Brad-
I put together this schedule of dates for delivery windows at Lake Charles 
assuming that the Oman lifting dates were already set.  I split the round 
trip time between Oman load dates to get to the desired CMS window.  If there 
are no delays, it should normally take about 25 days one way from the first 
day of the Oman window based on 1.5 days to load, 1.5 days at Suez, and 22 
days transit (9,210 miles at 17.5 mph).  Splitting the round trip time gives 
us a little leeway in case of delays.

 Oman Window  Desired CMS Window
 May 12-14  June 8-10
 July 5-7   July 30 - Aug 1
 Aug 25-27  Sept 19-21
 Oct 14-16  Nov 8-10
 Dec 4-6   Dec 29-31

If the May lifting is the first cargo put on board the Hoegh Galleon, we need 
to add an extra day for cool down.  If the March 18-20 window is the first 
one, we would want to split the time there for a CMS window of April 14-16, 
which is the window we already have.

Dan

Todd - I have some questions on the COU.

   Is there a relevant "Port Authority" at the EcoElectrica terminal?  If not,
   why is this contained in the document?
   In Section 2.1, is there an Attachment "A"?
   Do the LNG Interests have an Emergency Response Plan?  Does this Plan have
   references to actions required in 7.1?
   Do the insurance requirements of the "vessel interests" duplicate or 
override
   what is required of Cabot LNG in Section 6.2 of the sales contract?  Should
   the LNG interests provide same insurance documentation?
   Ditto Section 12

These are my simple questions not intended to begin a negotiation.  I am only
trying to gather all information.  Please call me for other comments.

Jane

Paul:

For your reference are the attached two files which have the write up from 
the two previous quarterly reports - Sep 30, 2000 and Dec 31, 2000.  I had 
given to Todd hard/paper copies of the same.

  

I just found out that I might be leaving for Mumbai on Sunday for meetings 
beginning Tuesday, 10 April.  Hope to get back to Houston by the end of the 
week and be in the office on Monday 16 April.

Thanks for your help.

Rudy-
Per our conversation today, the invoice for the "Hilli" delivery will be due 
no earlier than May 17,  2001.  If under normal payment terms the invoice 
would be due later than May 17, then the regular due date would prevail.

Thanks for your help,

Rudy-
I have been asked by the plant to request that the payment terms for the 
"Hilli" be extended.  Since the delivery is earlier than Eco needs the 
product,  they would request that the invoice be due on May 17.  Please 
advise if this is agreeable.

Thanks,

Oscar-
These Letters of Prtotest are simply standard proceedure for ships in the 
trade and mean nothing unless we cause a delay beyond our allowed laytime 
(which we did not).  Even if we had exceeded our laytime, it is not usual to 
respond to these protests.  Instead we would document our side internally and 
wait for any demurrage claim which might arise.

As to the "Hilli", the last ETA at Lake Charles was Apr 18-19,  I will keep 
you updated of any changes.  I will also pass on Hector and Victor's names to 
Cabot for clearance to attend.

Subject: Hoegh Galleon standing orders and voyage orders format

Roald,

In accordance with your request during our meeting earlier today I have 
attached to this message copies of the standing orders and voyage orders for 
Hoegh Galleon that Enron finalized with Capt. Kvammen.  Though these have 
been finalized, it does not mean that they can not be changed in future if 
the need arises.  Should it become apparent that anything has to be added to 
or removed from either of these standard documents they will be amended as 
necessary following consultation between Owners and Charterers.



Additionally, below is an excerpt from a message that I sent to Capt. Kvammen 
some time ago.  It outlines the division of responsibilities within our 
organization as they relate to Charterers responsibilities towards Hoegh 
Galleon.  I did not send you the complete message that was sent to Capt. 
Kvammen as there were a number of questions in that message which have since 
been answered.

Responsibilities for administering the LNG purchase / sale contracts and for 
the daily / voyage instructions, bunkering instructions etc., to the vessel.  
This will rest with Todd Peterson and Dan Masters.  Todd and Dan work under 
Wayne Perry.  Dan Masters will be the primary name on ship / charterers 
communications and will copy our entire group on his communications with the 
ship.
Responsibilities for administering the Hoegh Galleon's Charter Party.  This 
will rest with myself and Jim Fernie.  As you know we work under Wayne.
Obviously Todd, Dan, Jim and I will have to work closely together to ensure 
we all know the current status of voyages etc. so that the operation runs 
smoothly and we can cover for each other during absences.


Regards,

Tony Galt

If the last Hoegh Galleon cargo of this year is diverted to Puerto Rico, the 
economics of sending non-Cabot LNG to Puerto Rico are different than those 
mentioned in my prior note.

Based on current prices, there is $0.7 MM of value that could be captured 
between Enron LNG and Eco on the diversion. This represents the price 
difference between what it would cost to buy back our sale to ENA at CMS and 
what Eco would have had to pay Cabot for a Winter Cargo. If CMS would let us 
out of the terminal fee or let it apply to a future delivery, that would add 
an additional $1 MM of value. If Cabot had to give up its Demand Charge and 
Demand Surcharge (hard to imagine) on the Winter Cargo, that adds another 
$4.7 MM.

A second Hoegh Galleon cargo should add $1.5 MM but would need to be sourced 
from Nigeria or Algeria(???). 

Cabot controls the date of the Last Cargo delivered in 2001. It can be 
November 23-December 15 (unless another date is mutually agreeable). The date 
of this last delivery determines the earliest date that Eco would be able to 
receive the Hoegh Galleon. The earliest that Eco could receive the Hoegh 
Galleon should therefore be between December 20 and January 11 - depends on 
Cabot. 

Eco would be able to receive a second Hoegh Galleon cargo as soon as 29 days 
after the first Hoegh Galleon cargo delivery or as late as 45 days after. Two 
Hoegh Galleon cargoes should give Eco enough fuel (barely) to get them to the 
dates where they are eligible to receive the Early Spring cargo (100 days 
after the Last Cargo of 2001). 

In addition to the $$$'s available to be captured, this program removes Eco's 
risk of not receiving a Winter Cargo from Cabot.

Economics and Timing -  The amount of value to be captured is most heavily 
influenced by December-January NYMEX prices. These impact our cost to buy 
back gas at the CMS tailgate and our cost to buy the second Hoegh Galleon 
cargo. Our gas cost is more subject to change than is the Cabot contract 
price we are trying to beat. If we had a crystal ball, we would lock-in the 
economics of the diversion and of the purchase of the second cargo when the 
NYMEX bottoms-out. The front of the price curve has lost ~$1.00/MMBtu in the 
last 2 weeks. Where will it go from here?

In order to be prepared to execute when market conditions are right, we need 
to get Eco on board and initiate discussions with a producer about supply for 
the second cargo. Also, we should talk with Gene Massey to confirm that the 
contract says what we think it says and to get his thoughts on what we are 
trying to do.

I would appreciate any insights that you may have regarding this opportunity.

Regards,

Paul

Rudy-
In the contract it says that nominations for the following month are firm 
while the 60 and 90 day ranges are just estimates.  Since taking delivery of 
the smaller ship causes us to nominate another cargo within the same month, 
we were stipulating that only the first nomination is firm as the contract 
defines it.  With all that being said, we are still planning on working 
together as usual for a  schedule that works for both sides.
Regards,
Dan
