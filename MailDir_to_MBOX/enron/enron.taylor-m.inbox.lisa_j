Before leaving for the August congressional recess, Senator John McCain (R-AZ) and Senator Joseph Lieberman (D-CT) made a joint statement on the Senate floor calling for an economy-wide cap and trade program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Please see the attached copy of their floor statements.
They laid out a timeframe for consultation with stakeholders, including U.S. industry, and development of legislation this fall.
This follows a series of legislative activity in the Senate since the conclusion of the international climate change negotiations in Bonn, Germany in July.  At the talks, without the support and direct participation of the U.S., nations agreed to continue to develop the rules for the Kyoto Protocol with a target date for ratification by 2002.
Other Senate activity includes:
Committee approval of climate change legislation sponsored by Senator Robert Byrd (D-W.Virginia) and Senator Ted Stevens (R-AL).  The bill would require development of a U.S. climate change response strategy with a long-term goal of stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S.  The strategy would seek ways to mitigate emissions and promote technology innovation, climate adaptation research and efforts to resolve scientific and economic uncertainties.  It would authorize spending of $4.9 billion over 10 years.
Passage of a non-binding resolution in the Senate Foreign Relations committee calling for the U.S. to engage in the climate change negotiations.
Introduction of legislation by Senator Frank Murkowski (R-AL), Senator Chuck Hagel (R-NE), Senator Larry Craig (R-ID) and others that provide for tax incentives for energy efficiency and clean energy technologies, increased research on climate science and government coordination on climate change.
Introduction of legislation by Senator Sam Brownback (R-KS) and Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) to enable reporting and provide credit for land management and sequestration under a national climate change program. 
Upcoming Administration and Congressional Activity
Despite statements made last week by EPA Administrator Christine Whitman and National Security Advisory Condolezza Rice, White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card said yesterday that the Bush Administration would likely have an alternative climate change proposal for consideration at the next negotiations in Morocco in late-October.  
A key issue remains whether the Bush Administration will support mandatory programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, like a domestic cap and trade system.  In March, President Bush said he would not support mandatory regulation of carbon dioxide emissions at power plants.  As recent events suggest, consideration of mandatory programs and emissions trading, including regulation of carbon, will be on the Senate agenda this fall.   Approaches to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will be considered through hearings and committee consideration of climate change legislation, multipollutant proposals and New Source Review reform.  
Enron's Advocacy
Enron will continue to promote its multipollutant proposal as a model for a domestic cap and trade program -- that could also provide a framework to address carbon emissions.  We will also offer our expertise on emissions trading and risk management to the Administration and Congress as they consider options to address climate change.
I will keep you posted on the status and movement on these legislative proposals.  Please feel free to contact me with questions about any of these proposals.

Trading Futures in Dirty Air=20
Here's a Market-Based Way to Fight Global Warming=20
By Ricardo Bayon

Sunday, August 5, 2001; Page B02=20
Gary Payne and Jeremy Taylor are two Wall Street types who work for trading=
 companies in, respectively, Kansas City and Houston. Their daily routine i=
s familiar to speculative traders everywhere: They wake up early to get a j=
ump on the markets, read the industry papers, take a look at their companie=
s' trading portfolios, and log onto their Bloomberg terminals to see who's =
buying and who's selling. But they do not trade in stocks, bonds, currencie=
s or even pork bellies. Instead, what Payne and Taylor trade is the right t=
o pollute -- specifically, the government-given right to emit sulfur dioxid=
e (SO2) and nitrogen oxides, the two gases chiefly responsible for acid rai=
n.
In a classic example of doing well by doing good, successful traders such a=
s Payne and Taylor buy pollution credits low, sell them high and make money=
 -- all the while playing an integral role in a system that has reduced ann=
ual emissions of SO2 by U.S. utilities by 29 percent since 1990. Their expe=
rience offers a valuable lesson for U.S. policy makers seeking solutions to=
 the problem of global climate change. The sulfur dioxide market provides a=
 business-friendly, market-oriented, cost-effective model for reducing emis=
sions of carbon dioxide, the gas generally considered to be the main culpri=
t behind global warming.=20
The market is based on the same theory as the country-to-country emissions =
trading program envisioned in the Kyoto Protocol signed by 178 countries an=
d rejected by President Bush. But the president should not be put off by th=
is. Pollution-credit trading is an inherently capitalist approach to the gl=
obal warming problem that can be set up nationally (or regionally, with Can=
ada and Mexico) and can be tailored to U.S. needs.=20
Perhaps the administration needs to be reminded of the successes of the SO2=
 program. It was created to combat acid rain, one of the major environmenta=
l issues of the 1980s. Acid rain is caused when sulfur dioxide and nitrogen=
 oxides are emitted into the atmosphere, mostly by power generators. In 199=
0, Congress amended the Clean Air Act to set national targets for emissions=
 of those gases; it then instructed the Environmental Protection Agency (EP=
A) to allocate the rights to these limited emissions among major U.S. utili=
ties, and to create a mechanism for the utilities to buy and sell those rig=
hts. Note that the government did not tell utilities how to reduce their em=
issions of SO2. It merely set targets and let the market determine how best=
 to achieve this goal. So, under the EPA plan, a power plant that was emitt=
ing too much sulfur dioxide had several options: It could install less poll=
uting technology, it could switch its fuel from coal to natural gas (which =
produces less SO2), or it could purchase excess emission credits from anoth=
er utility. A utility that upgraded its technology or switched fuels might =
even cover some of the costs by selling emission credits it no longer neede=
d.
Trading in sulfur dioxide rights got fully underway in 1995 (and in nitroge=
n oxides some years later). Today, the right to emit SO2 sells for around $=
200 a ton and is sold in lots of 2,500 tons, which means it is available to=
 anyone with half a million dollars to spare. The big buyers and sellers ar=
e utilities and energy companies, but there are exceptions. The venerable W=
all Street brokerage firm Cantor Fitzgerald once helped a wealthy benefacto=
r purchase the right to emit one ton of SO2 as a wedding present for a pair=
 of environmentalists; and it brokered a deal for an environmental group th=
at wanted to give its retirees emission rights instead of gold watches.=20
Taylor, who tracks the market closely, says that in the past year about $66=
8 million worth of SO2 credits changed hands. He points out, however, that =
if the trading in SO2 options and futures is included, the total market is =
several times that size. "You can buy SO2 puts, calls, straddles, call spre=
ads, whatever you need," he says.=20
And this robust and liquid market is not just profitable; it also has been =
remarkably effective at controlling acid rain. According to the EPA, which =
tracks the emissions of 263 of the largest power plants in the country, the=
y emitted 8.7 million tons of SO2 in 1990, when Congress first mandated a c=
ap. That figure dropped to 7.4 million tons by 1994. But in 1995, when trad=
ing in SO2 credits began, emissions plummeted to 4.5 million tons, even tho=
ugh power generation continued to increase. In the Northeast and Mid-Atlant=
ic regions of the United States, where acid rain and lake acidification wer=
e particularly problematic, acid rain levels declined by 25 percent between=
 1995 and 1999.=20
The cost to businesses of this environmental benefit was barely more than a=
 tenth of what had originally been predicted. Before Congress mandated the =
sulfur dioxide cap, the Edison Electric Institute estimated that it would c=
ost $7.4 billion a year for industry to meet its targets; over the ensuing =
decade, successive studies by a variety of groups have shown that the real =
figure is likely to be closer to $870 million a year.=20
In other words, the SO2 market is doing what markets do best: It has wrung =
inefficiencies out of the system and allocated scarce resources (in this ca=
se, pollution rights) very cost-effectively.=20
Markets can do the same thing for carbon dioxide. But this will require of =
President Bush and Congress at least one act of political courage: They wil=
l need to cap CO2 emissions. Bush pledged to do so during his 2000 campaign=
, but later reversed his stance. Now he would have to reverse the reversal =
-- but he can find inspiration in his father, the first President Bush, who=
se administration launched the successful SO2 trading program.
Besides, the gesture might not be as difficult as it looks -- because when =
it comes to greenhouse gases, business is way ahead of government. A quiet =
"gray market" already exists in carbon dioxide. Individual companies, expec=
ting some kind of government regulation in the not-too-distant future, have=
 been buying and selling CO2 credits for more than three years.=20
"If you are a large power company spending millions of dollars building pla=
nts that you expect to operate for 20 or 30 years," says CO2 trader Carlton=
 Bartels, "you are not happy when government comes along and tells you not =
to worry about global warming, at least not for the next four years. That d=
oesn't decrease the risks your company faces as a result of climate change.=
 It may actually increase them."=20
Bartels is chief executive officer of CO2e.com, a carbon dioxide trading fi=
rm that was spun off from Cantor Fitzgerald six months ago. The new company=
 helps businesses prepare for what Bartels calls the inevitable "carbon-con=
strained" future -- when public pressure will force governments to regulate=
 emissions of the gases that cause climate change.=20
In the meantime, CO2e.com is busy arranging trades for companies that want =
to stay ahead of the curve. For example,Houston-based Petro Source Carbon C=
o. has constructed a pipeline that takes the carbon dioxide produced by fou=
r U.S. power plants and pumps it into new oil wells in west Texas, where it=
 enhances oil recovery. Since the CO2 it uses would otherwise be vented int=
o the atmosphere, Petro Source figures it will have carbon credits to spare=
 if and when the United States puts a cap on CO2 emissions. Meanwhile, Onta=
rio Power Generation of Toronto, whose plants emit carbon dioxide, expects =
Canada to institute a similar cap. In a deal brokered by CO2e.com, Ontario =
Power recently bought 1.3 million tons of Petro Source's credits. Both part=
ies expect their governments to honor the deal in the future.=20
Bartels estimates that in its short lifetime, CO2e.com has been involved in=
 trades for the equivalent of 3.5 million tons of CO2 emissions rights, eac=
h ton selling for between $1 and $5a ton. (A ton of carbon dioxide is much =
cheaper than a ton of sulfur dioxide, in part, because trade in CO2 is stil=
l highly speculative. If governments institute CO2 emissions caps, these pr=
ices should skyrocket.) Even before CO2e.com was created, he said, Cantor F=
itzgerald helped move between 20 million and 30 million tons of CO2 emissio=
ns rights.
By the end of this decade, Bartels believes that the CO2 market could be wo=
rth tens of billions of dollars. "Given the amount of global emissions," he=
 says, "this could become the largest commodity market in the world."=20
As President Bush seeks a coherent policy on climate change, he would do we=
ll to realize that Wall Street, power companies and emissions traders have =
for years been sitting on an elegant -- not to mention profitable -- soluti=

Press Release

SOURCE: International Cavitation Technologies, Inc.

ICTK Announces Strategic Alliance for Coal Industry

TULSA, Okla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 17, 2001--International Cavitation Technologies, Inc. (OTCBB:ICTK - news)
today announced the formation of a strategic alliance with Meridian Ionic, Ltd. (``MIL''), a division of Meridian Hydrocarbons,
Inc., to jointly develop and market their proprietary ``Ion Collider'' technology to the coal industry. 

In previous laboratory testing, ICTK's patented Ion Collider(TM) ``ionized'' coal water wash resulted in a significant reduction
in the amount of ash and sulfur content in the coal. These reductions directly result in a cleaner-burning coal with a higher BTU
capacity. Mr. Gerald M. Brother, president of MIL, added: ``There is a tremendous demand for new 'clean' coal-burning
technology. With more than one billion tons of coal being burned annually by U.S. utility and manufacturing facilities alone, which
results in some 115 million tons of ash/waste, there is literally an unlimited market for cleaner-burning coal. The Ion
Collider(TM) proprietary process of washing the coal with ionized water can significantly increase the value of the coal.'' 

Under the terms of the strategic alliance, MIL and ICT will work in conjunction to market the Ion Collider technology, initially to
the steel and cement industries, and eventually to the utility corporate coal end-users. ``Enhancing and improving coal-burning
efficiencies will be a major economic and environmental asset to the continuing use of coal as a long-term, abundant and
acceptable fuel,'' stated Monroe A. Ashworth III, president of ICTK. ``Based on the remarkable results we have seen from our
research testing, we anticipate a rapid development of the Ion Collider's application in the coal industry,'' concluded Ashworth. 

International Cavitation Technologies Inc. owns six different patents and the worldwide rights to proprietary technology with a
vast array of applications, including enhanced oil and gas production, dredging, environmental remediation, separation, waste
minimization, wastewater treatment, air-conditioning and a variety of oil field applications. ICTK currently has licensing
agreements in place with several companies. Ion Collider(TM) technology has proven its ability to remove contaminants from a
variety of matrices in significantly less time and at lower costs than traditional environmental technologies. Additional information
concerning ICTK can be found on the Internet at www.ioncollider.com. 

This press release includes statements that may constitute forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor
provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although International Cavitation Technologies, Inc. believes
the expectations contained in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, no assurance is given that such expectations will
prove correct. This information may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results of International Cavitation
Technologies, Inc. to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Information on factors that may affect the business
and financial results of the Company can be found in filings of the Company made with the SEC.

Per your request, I have compiled the following memo that provides information on the potential international greenhouse gas emissions trading market.  It also discusses factors that impact current prices for greenhouse gas emissions transactions and identifies future market influences.  

Given current regulatory uncertainty and the patchwork of greenhouse gas emissions initiatives, a liquid market with a clearly defined commodity is likely several years (or more) away.  However, given the growing interest in compliance hedging, opportunities to package and sell verifiable greenhouse gas emissions reductions could increase in the near future.  Further, with the launch of the U.K. emissions trading program and rule development for the EU trading program expected next year, it is likely that the definition of a verifiable greenhouse gas emission credit will become more clear.

Given the range and varying circumstances under which current greenhouse gas emissions transactions are occurring, Enron business groups should begin to capture (define ownership and package) internal greenhouse gas reductions, look for opportunities to integrate greenhouse gas emissions concerns into existing risk management products and, Enron assets that are significant greenhouse gas emissions sources, should assess and manage exposures.  

Environmental Strategies Group will convene a commercially oriented greenhouse gas strategy discussion on Tuesday morning, November 20 (EB 8C1) to explore these opportunities across business groups.  I hope you and others from your group will be able to participate.  There will be video conference and teleconference capabilities available.

 
Please contact me with questions, comments, or suggestions for further analysis.

As part of a Business Council for Sustainable Energy delegation, I met with Paula Dobriansky, Undersecretary for Global Affairs at the Department of State on Friday.  Dobriansky serves as the head delegate for the U.S. at the climate change negotiations.

The BCSE is an industry trade group for the efficiency, natural gas and renewables industries in the U.S.  The Council supports the adoption of a binding international treaty to address climate change.

Not surprisingly, her tone was moderated in contrast to her remarks at the NAM meeting in early September.  She expressed her "commitment," along with others in the Administration like Jim Connaughton at the Council on Environmental Quality, to put forward a plan to address climate change.  Though she could not say what form the plan would take or provide an indication of the timing of its release -- especially in light of the September 11 attacks.

Dobriansky confirmed that she intends to attend the next set of climate change negotiations scheduled for late October in Morocco (COP-7).  The U.N. has not postponed or cancelled the meetings.

She also confirmed that the U.S. would not block other nations from adopting rules to implement the Kyoto Protocol at COP-7.  The U.S. will engage in climate change convention issues and inject itself to protect U.S. interests, including non-tariff trade barriers and competitiveness issues.

There was a general discussion of the merits of cross-border and regional greenhouse gas trading through NAFTA or other mechanisms, but the Administration's thinking on this is still in the conceptual phase.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks for the note - do we have any indication of the price?

Regarding the UK Emissions Trading Scheme:
We met with Sainsburys on Friday to discuss a number of issues including participation in the emissions trading scheme pilot in Q1 2002. They are interested in doing this and, given the short timescale, we are moving forward to assemble the necessary data package. Currently Sainsbury are working with Bridget Rosewell of Volterra Consulting who is on the ETG steering committee and is advising them on the political issues.
There are a number of issues we need to consider in putting together the bid:
1. Do we have any experience of descending clock auctions? It looks fairly straightforward but I would be grateful for any views.
2. There is concern that one of the large chemical/ cement makers/ etc could swamp the market and take the whole pot - any views?
3. Do we have a view on the price of carbon? We have a lot of details on the price of abating a tonne of carbon in a range of industries but little data on the potential price. The government target is to save 2 million tonnes / year therefore if the pot is ?30 million / year this  suggests a figure of ?15 / tonne. However I have seen higher and lower figures suggested as the targets however I would have thought that it will be necessary to achieve the lowest cost / tonne as this is funded by the taxpayer?

Dear Michael,

It was good talking with you too.  I look forward to working with you.  To get you started, I will email the presentation you sat through last week - it is long, but has a tremendous amount on useful info (especially the maps).  I am happy to answer questions or walk through parts of it when needed.

I will also send you some background material on our multi-emissions proposal.  Similarly, give me a ring is you have any questions.

Talk to you soon,

Lisa

Lisa,

It was great listening and learning from you this morning.  Obviously you are going to be a wealth of information.  

My e-mail address is michael.e.taylor@enron.com    (Just in case in is in a different form above)

I have mainly been focusing on NOx.  Very interested in anything concerning NOx.  I will be adding SO2 to my umbrella shortly.

A brief background on myself:

	Graduated Louisiana State University in Finance in May 2001
	Spent a few months at Microsoft Equity Trading Room and Gas Scheduling and Trading at Enron
	(Nothing related to Emissions at all)

Sincerely,
Michael Taylor

Japan will prepare for domestic ratification of the Kyoto Protocol next year, provided that governments are able to adopt formal texts on implementation rules for the treaty at the climate negotiations next month (COP-7).  Reaching agreement on the lengthy texts at COP-7 is possible, but will not be easy.

As the second largest economy, and about 10 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, Japan's decision to ratify the Protocol would make it considerably more likely that the treaty will enter into force.  Since "political" agreement was reached in July on implementation rules for the Kyoto Protocol, Japan has expressed its commitment to the treaty but has not set a specific timeline for ratification.  Much of it efforts have been spent on trying to persuade the U.S. to offer an alternative to Kyoto or come back to the negotiation table on the treaty.

Given Japan's economic woes, several of its Ministries as well as its domestic industry sectors have cautioned against ratification.  These recent announcements represent more buy in from domestic government agencies and an attempt to build momentum for the upcoming climate talks. 

Moving ahead with ratification next year would allow the treaty to enter into force shortly after the tenth anniversary meeting of the Rio Earth Summit, scheduled for Johannesburg, South Africa next fall.  The EU has set fall 2002 as a goal for ratification.   

Japan's Next Steps for Ratification

Japan will take formal action next year if governments adopt formal decisions on the implementation rules for the Kyoto Protocol at COP-7.  Legislative action required for ratification includes adoption of a national implementation plan as well as the instrument of ratification.  Given the state of Japan's economy, adoption of a domestic implementation plan will likely be challenging. 

Kyoto Ratification and Reduction Obligations

The Protocol will enter into force after it has been ratified by at least 55 parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, including industrialized countries representing at least 55 percent of the total 1990 carbon dioxide emissions from that group.  Ratification would be possible if the EU, Japan and several economies is transition (or Canada) sign on.  

If the Protocol enters into force, national governments in countries that become a party to the treaty will devolve emission reduction obligations to domestic sources.  National governments will also decide whether, and how, the private sector can use the market-based mechanisms under the treaty - emissions trading and project-based mechanisms (Joint Implementation and the Clean Development Mechanism).

Please see the attached article from The Japan Times as well a presentation that outlines the key provisions of the Kyoto Protocol.

FYI only...I know some people who attended I will let you know if anything significant came out of the meetings.
UN forum in Rio to set up "environmental" market 

BRAZIL: September 3, 2001 

RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil - Business executives, government officials and environmentalists from all over the world converged on Rio de Janeiro last week under U.N. auspices to discuss rules for a new "environmental market" to fight global warming. 

They hope the business potential of the market, with an expected turnover of $10 billion to $15 billion a year for the next 15 years or so, will tempt big US companies to support the plan. 
The main commodities of the new global market are quotas for greenhouse gas emissions for private companies and countries, low-emission technologies and investment in lesser developed countries, U.N. officials told a news conference. 
"It is a fascinating process of the creation of a new market, with new commodities, which still needs rules to work," said Rubens Ricupero, a Brazilian, who is secretary-general of the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development. 
The quotas would be imposed only if and when the Kyoto treaty on global warming comes into effect. The future of the Kyoto accord, however, is still in question after the United States - the world's biggest polluter - rejected it. 
Last month, environment ministers meeting in Germany reached a compromise deal to salvage the Kyoto treaty, calling on nations to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 5.2 percent below their 1990 levels by 2012. The protocol should become a workable treaty and be brought into force next year. 
HOW TO IMPLEMENT IT? 
"The question now is how to implement that, minimizing sacrifice of the economy," said Ricupero. 
For the 30-some industrially developed nations there will be a market for emission certificates, or quotas for harmful gas emissions, that can be traded. 
Investing in low-emission industrial technologies for lesser developed countries, forest planting and other projects, these countries would be able to get "credits" in the form of higher emission quotas. 
Ricupero underscored that Brazil, one of the world's largest developing countries, could receive a great deal of investment in the future as it needs many new gas-fired power plants to withstand a severe energy shortage. 
"This is the area which has a lot to do with gas emissions and the technology costs quite a lot. Forest planting can also bring big investment, given the size of deforestation here," he said. 
"No nation, however powerful it is, can go in the opposite direction than other nations on the planet.... We are getting some positive signs already," said Earth Council President Maurice Strong. 
Ricupero said that Canada and Brazil, the biggest countries in the Americas, along with the United States, should do their best to convince US President George W. Bush's administration to return to talks on global warming. 
"It is in the interest of the US private sector. They are the world leaders in this technology and they will only win by supplying this technology to others."

Subject: DOE Solicitation - Carbon Sequestration



Dear Enron Team:

The Office of Fossil Energy, through the National Energy Technology
Laboratory (NETL)is offering multi-year and multi-million Carbon
Sequestration awards.  The one-day seminar that L&A set up last Thursday was
undertaken in a very timely manner.  NETL is trolling the waters in search
of new development and deployment opportunities.  Their game is one for
insiders.  That means that you have to get in a pre-application (5 doubled
spaced pages - 2 real pages of text) by December 6th to keep your place in
line.  The submission need be only good enough to keep their interest to ask
us to submit more information - and thanks to last Thursday you now know
what they are looking for.  All those that miss the deadline are out for the
entire year.  Accordingly, we need to jump through this hoop to stay in line
and then leverage our relationship with NETL to try to secure a grant.

NETL is making $17 million available for cost-shared applications for
research and development of fossil energy technologies.  The Government
anticipates the project period for the subject awards to be twelve to
thirty-six months.

This Master Solicitation is divided into Areas of Interest.  The attached
Master Template covers only Area of Interest 4, Carbon Sequestration,
DE-PS26-02NT41422-4.  The full solicitation is also attached for your
review.

A 5 page pre-application must be submitted by December 6 in order to be
considered for Round One funding.  All submission requirements are included
in the attached Master Template.

Best regards,

Murray

Dear Trevor, Michael and Laura,

Good talking with you all this morning.  Based on our discussion, I will work with you to get intelligence on the following emissions markets:

SO2
NOx
Houston-Galveston - Stacey Bolton is the resident expert, but feel free to use me as main point of contact for the group
CO2 (desk in monitoring and gathering intelligence at this point)

Ongoing projects include intelligence on:

industry dynamics and descriptions of coalitions on NOx, SO2 and CO2 emissions issues, specifically multi-emissions legislation
what are their priorities, and any information that may indicate their positions

How and when are the current emissions trading programs going to roll into the new programs?
how will that impact holders of allowances, etc.

bios of new administration officials with decision making authority on emissions issues at EPA, CEQ, WH, others.

tracking of emissions trading lawsuit in New York, and similar cases as they arise

I will de-brief with Laura next week on the lawsuit issues and will begin working on descriptions of the industry dynamics on multi-emissions proposals and bios of new administration officials.

As for follow-up with EPA on treatment of allowances under new national NOx and SO2 programs -- working with Kevin, John, Jeff Keeler, Lisa Yoho and Pat Shortridge (DC lobbyist) -- we should identify the key issues and develop a strategy.   Jeff suggested a conference call to discuss this.  I will check in with him and follow up if necessary.

We will also begin our weekly conference calls, starting Tuesday, August 14 - say 9:30 Houston time (please let me know if you would like it to be earlier in the morning or start on a different date)?

In the meantime, just give me a ring if you need anything,

Lisa

Scrubbers Planned For Four TVA Coal Plants

The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) recently unveiled plans to cut SO2 emissions by equipping four of its
coal-fired generating facilities with flue-gas desulfurization systems. The $1.5 billion project will add
single scrubbers at TVA's Bull Run, Paradise, and Colbert plants, and a pair of scrubbers at the utility's Kingston
facility. Equipping the five units with sulfur controls is expected to lower TVA's SO2 emissions by 200,000 tons per year, the utility said.

TVA is also in the midst of a $1 billion program to reduce NOX emissions at its plants by constructing 18 selective-catalytic-reduction systems (SCRs) on 25 coal-fired generating units.  Design work on the new scrubbers will start in 2003. Peak construction activities will have to be delayed, however, until the SCR-installation program is finished. The utility noted that a lack of availability of craft workers and other resources needed to install the emissions-control equipment will affect the completion date (AD 7/18/01). TVA didn't provide an estimated completion date for the scrubber project.

TVA has already installed scrubbers on six of its coal-fired generating units, including two each at Cumberland,
Paradise and Widows Creek.

A follow-up to your note, John -

in discussions with Natsource, I understood that Marubeni effectively obtained cheap advertising as first ever emissions trading deal in UK under the UK Emissions Trading scheme, all that for around ?50,000 (10,000 tons at ?~5 per ton).  It is unlikely that Marubeni will ever retire these allowances in the UK, and even more unlikely that these will be recognized and accepted in Japan.  

Natsource mentioned they have another possible seller at a price of ?5 per ton, but no buyers in that range.  There is, however, a firm bid at ?3.5 per ton CO2.

Trevor, 

You expressed interest in the background and ideology of some of the Bush Administration's appointee picks.  This is a good survey article.  
Energy-Industry's Links to Regulators, Administration Worry Environmentalists 
By James V. Grimaldi
Washington Post Staff Writer
Monday, September 10, 2001; Page E13 
Is the Bush administration plotting to drop lawsuits against electricity generators accused of polluting the air in violation of the Clean Air Act?
That's the fear of environmental groups as power companies rev up the lobbying turbines and some politically connected lawyers take key positions in the administration. Are these attorneys in place to execute a payback for the $12.5 million that electric utilities gave (according to the Center for Responsive Politics) to George W. Bush and Republicans last year?
One of the key issues involves a part of the Clean Air Act that permitted existing power plants to exceed the amount of pollution they disgorged into the air if the plants were in existence -- or "grandfathered" -- when the act was updated. However, if the companies made any significant renovations, they were supposed to clean up their emissions. Many companies did update their plants -- but did not clean up their emissions and, beginning in 1999, the Justice Department and the Environmental Protection Agency sued them. The companies said the plant renovations weren't significant and they didn't have to improve emissions.
Now, the Bush administration is formally reviewing whether the lawsuits are justified. Meanwhile, the EPA is conducting its own review of the same policy and evaluating whether the whole law needs rewriting. And Congress is in the act too: This week Sen. James M. Jeffords (I-Vt.) has scheduled two informal "stakeholders meetings" to broadly discuss air pollution by utilities.
At the center of much of the debate is the law firm Latham & Watkins. Two prominent officials of the Bush administration overseeing environmental issues came from Latham & Watkins. And, it turns out, Latham & Watkins has been at the center of much of the lobbying effort on behalf of the very companies being sued for polluting the air.
The two former Latham partners involved are Phil Perry, the son-in-law of Vice President Cheney and the acting associate attorney general overseeing the environment and natural resources division of the Justice Department, and Jeffrey Holmstead, the new assistant administrator for air and radiation at the Environmental Protection Agency.
Both attorneys have said that they were not directly involved in representing the electricity companies. Nevertheless, Perry has recused himself and turned over the review to Viet Dinh, the assistant attorney general for policy. Dinh, who came to the administration from Georgetown University law school, has inherited the question of whether to continue pursuing these lawsuits, a decision that will be closely scrutinized by all sides.
Unlike Perry, Holmstead has not recused himself from his separate review. To the contrary, Holmstead is deep in the middle of the decision-making. He is writing a legislative proposal that would ultimately replace the program. The legislation is intended to be a multipronged way of addressing the various pollutants emitted by the electricity-generating industry. A primary part of the plan involves a pollution-credits trading system. Similar to a program implemented for acid rain, the idea is that polluting plants could pay more to exceed minimum standards by purchasing credits from plants that fall below standards.
That idea is very similar to one being pushed by one of Holmstead's former colleagues at Latham & Watkins, Robert Sussman, and some environmentalists think it is no coincidence. Sussman is the lead lawyer and lobbyist for a group of electricity-producing companies called Energy for a Clean Air Future. That group represents Cinergy Corp., PPL (Pennsylvania Power & Light) Corp., Reliant Energy Inc., Tampa Electric Co., TransAlta Corp., and Wisconsin Electric Power Co.
The environmentalists' suspicions were also aroused because Holmstead was a protege of anti-regulatory guru C. Boyden Gray, of Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering, and Holmstead had been lauded for his work on the Council on Competitiveness, a controversial regulation-cutting commission in the Bush I administration. Holmstead also was listed as the contact on lobbying documents for another power-company trade group, the Alliance for Constructive Air Policy, which included companies such as Cinergy, one of the companies he now regulates as the nation's air-pollution policy maker.
"Part of his salary was coming from Cinergy," said Frank O'Donnell, executive director of the environmental group Clean Air Trust. "Now he is promoting a viewpoint within the administration that is starkly similar to the viewpoint that these same Latham & Watkins lawyers are advocating for their polluting clients."
Sussman, who worked in the EPA during the Clinton administration, pooh-poohs the conspiracy theory. First, he points out that the pollution trading program has widespread support and that Holmstead's proposal looks a lot like Sen. Jeffords's pollution-trading proposal. Second, Holmstead did no lobbying work for the Alliance for Constructive Air Policy; his role as "contact" was merely to make sure the lobbying reports were filed correctly. 
"I don't think Jeff has any preconceptions or axes to grind," Sussman said. "I think he calls them as he sees them. Washington is a small town, but that doesn't mean that anything wrong is happening."
Holmstead, for his part, echoes what Sussman says. He also points out that there is no connection between the Justice Department lawsuits and his current review of the policy. He said he has carefully recused himself from any matter in which he was directly involved at Latham. Also, if he had to recuse himself from everything that the 1,400 attorneys in his law firm handled out of their 19 offices worldwide, then he would have little to do.
Meanwhile, the review of the EPA cases continues at the Justice Department. More than 20 companies are being sued throughout the country in one of the largest enforcement actions in EPA history. Much is at stake there, not the least of which is a lot of defense work for firms such as Troutman Sanders; Balch & Bingham (featuring celebrity counsel former GOP chief Haley Barbour); Porter Wright Morris & Arthur; Sidley & Austin; Hogan & Hartson; Hunton & Williams; Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld; and Vinson & Elkins.
Hey, what are you guys in the Bush administration thinking? You are jeopardizing the livelihoods of hard-working, bonus-earning, $125,000-a-year, first-year associates!
Chamber Chief's New Job
Former U.S. Chamber of Commerce chief lobbyist Lonnie P. Taylor has a new job. Taylor, who is credited with rejuvenating the chamber's moribund reputation on Capitol Hill in the past eight years, is joining the District office of Atlanta-based Powell Goldstein Frazer & Murphy.
Taylor left the chamber as senior vice president for congressional and public affairs after he was forced out by President Tom Donahue, an incident that drew the "concern" of Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.).Taylor, a native Washingtonian and a Republican, is still working out the terms of his departure from the chamber.
At Powell Goldstein, Taylor will run the government-relations practice group along with former U.S. representative Butler Derrick (R-S.C.). The firm's culture clinched the deal, Taylor said.

Per my other email message, I would like to get your feedback on Enron's advocacy at the next set of climate change negotiations (COP-7).  The rules pertaining to greenhouse gas emissions trading and project-based incentives for carbon mitigation/offset projects (JI and CDM) will be considered and likely adopted. 

Based on conversations with commercial and regulatory groups, I have developed a list of priority issues.  I would be interested in your comments, with an emphasis on emissions trading rules.  While the international rules stay fairly big picture, leaving must to implementation on a domestic or regional level, the framework for emissions trading and the rules for qualifying projects have an impact.  

Please let me know if you are free to meet this afternoon - I am in Hosuton today.

Thanks,

Lisa
 
-------



Preliminary Outline of Areas of Interest for Enron for COP-7 Advocacy

Rules for Emissions Trading

Allow legal entities to transfer and acquire credits under the trading program (Parties make that decision as the text is currently written)

Ensure that domestic governments determine allocation schemes

Clearly define CO2e credits -- not much in text, refers to national inventory, sources and sinks included -- do we need more?

Allow full fungibility of credits and allowances (CERs, ERUs, PAAs)

Establish transparent registry

Clear penalties for overselling at onset of the program -- now restoration of tons with penalty at rate of 1.3, no financial penalty

QUESTIONS:

How does this fit in with UK and EU program design issues?
What is needed at the international level to build market?

Rules for Joint Implementation/Clean Development Mechanism

Allow for broad definition of qualifying projects -  do we want to provide guidance on definitions of energy efficiency and renewable energy?  

Leave decisions on approval to of JI projects to partner governments to increase participation, unless a party government is out of compliance or ineligible to participate in the market-based mechanisms

Allow JI projects to generate credits even in cases where one party government is out compliance (preserve the JI credit transfer)
 
Provide for streamlined approval process for certain project types based on size/and or technology type (RE and EE -- right now there is a threshold of 15 MW -- is that too low?)

Allow unilateral CDM projects to quality


QUESTIONS:

What is the international role in developing baselines?
What is the international role in developing additionality requirements -- how should it be set?

COP-7 --- Update on Progress

The mood at the climate change negotiations has picked up considerably since my last email. A compromise has been reached on the Kyoto Protocol compliance regime, which has given delegates hope that Ministers can forge agreement on remaining contentious issues by the end of the week.

Under the compliance deal, the Kyoto Protocol will retain its legal status, but decisions on binding consequences will be adopted post-ratification. 

The rules for the market-based mechanisms and national reporting still have significant unresolved issues, which are being negotiated as I write this report. 

In the meantime, Ministers arrived last night and have been making their opening statements all day. This will continue for some time.

U.S. Under Secretary for Global Affairs Paula Dobriansky arrived yesterday evening, but has not yet briefed the U.S. business community. She has scheduled a briefing for tomorrow evening. Traditionally, the U.S. delegation meets with business observers almost every night - the delegation has not met with U.S. business community since last Friday. Many are frustrated by this.

Please let me know if you have any questions. Otherwise, I report more tomorrow.

--- On a separate note, my thoughts are with every one during this trying time for Enron - there is not much more I can say, but I am reading all the clips and, like you, trying to stay focused and hoping for the best.

Again, if you would like to contact me please try via email or call me at +41793453046.

All the best,

Lisa

Administration Nears EPA Enforcement Nomination Following 
Schregardus Debacle  

White House officials are reportedly giving serious consideration to 
nominating Washington, DC, attorney Daniel Addison to be EPA's 
next assistant administrator of the Office of Enforcement & 
Compliance Assurance.  Sources say Addison has emerged as a 
leading contender and that the administration is expected to make 
a formal announcement of a nomination within the next few weeks.  

The administration has been searching for a new enforcement chief 
following the Bush administration's failed attempt to bring in former 
Ohio environmental chief Donald Schregardus to head the office. 
Schregardus withdrew his name in September after heated 
congressional debate over the Ohio EPA's enforcement record 
under his lead.  

An informed source confirmed that Addison has met with EPA 
Deputy Assistant Administrator Linda Fisher about the position. 
EPA officials would not comment.  

Sources say Addison is an advocate of increasing compliance 
assistance measures and alternative compliance methodologies 
based on environmental performance. As a senior partner at the 
D.C. law firm of Patton Boggs, sources say he has an extensive 
background with national enforcement issues, both in the public 
and private sector.  

Addison's career in government stems back to the Reagan 
administration where he served in the general counsel's office at 
the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration and as acting 
assistant administrator for industry and congressional affairs in the 
General Services Administration. Addison has also served as the 
assistant director of the California Department of Conservation.  

In the private sector, Addison served as vice president for 
government and international affairs at Pacific Research & 
Strategies, Inc., and he has been with Patton Boggs since 1995.  

Addison was lead attorney last year in a highly publicized 
enforcement case, Nucor v. U.S. In that case, Addison was 
involved in sealing a settlement for Nucor Corporation, the U.S.'s 
second largest steel manufacturer, after the company was accused 
of violating various environmental laws. The settlement includes a 
number of environmental measures the company agreed to 
undertake.  

Sources say Addison is a leading contender among other possible 
nominees, and that all candidates are currently undergoing a 
screening process with the White House. Sources did not specify 
how many other candidates there were for the position.

Pollution trading system on hold
U.S. criticizes Ontario plan
John Spears
Proposals that would put a price tag on the right to pollute in Ontario - and create a market for trading those rights - have gone back to the drawing board. 
The province's plans have drawn comments from many quarters, including a detailed and critical response from the U.S. government. 
Pollution blows both ways across the the Canada-U.S. border. But can both countries agree on a system of trading pollution credits, which are meant to be a tool for cleaning up North America's air? 
The environment ministry will pore over the comments to see if the proposed system for trading harmful emissions should be changed. 
Ministry spokesperson John Steele couldn't say how long the review would take. 
The province's proposals cover emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide - two gases that cause smog. 
In theory, emissions trading systems set strict ceilings on over-all emissions of pollutants, and slowly squeeze the limits lower over time. 
Polluters are given an over-all target - say, a 10 per cent reduction in emissions of a specific substance. 
Some polluters may find it cheap and easy not only to meet that target, but to exceed it. Others, who may have older equipment or are in a different business, may struggle to meet the goal. 
An emissions trading system allows a company that beat its target to sell surplus pollution credits to the company that fell short. The price is set by the buyers and sellers. 
The economic theory is that as long as the over-all emission reduction target is achieved, it makes sense to do it at the least cost. A trading system means that the lowest-cost solutions are implemented first. 
While it means that some firms continue to pollute, they must pay a price for it. That drives up their costs, and prods them to clean up. 
Will it work in practice? 
Initially, Ontario's proposals would apply only to the six fossil-fuel burning plants owned by Ontario Power Generation. The proposal details a steady reduction in their emissions. 
 Ontario system too complicated, says U.S. environmental agency  	
The proposals have attracted keen interest from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. It has submitted 13 closely spaced pages criticizing the Ontario plan. 
The EPA doesn't believe the methods Ontario proposes for measuring emissions are effective. Measuring emissions is crucial if reductions are to be assigned a real value. 
That and other technical problems ``call into question the compatibility of the proposed trading system for Ontario and U.S. trading programs,'' the EPA says. 
Since pollution blows across international boundaries, emissions reduction credits will also be traded across the border. 
``It's in our interest to work together'' with the U.S., says John Wellner of Pollution Probe. 
Steele says that's what Ontario is trying to do. 
``It's the intention to harmonize our trading system to allow cross-border trading. We're currently in discussion with the U.S. to reach agreement that makes cross-border trading in emission reduction credits a reality.'' 
But Steele notes it's a two-way street: At present, he says, legislation in the U.S. doesn't permit the type of cross-border trading contemplated by Ontario, so there's work to do on both sides of the border. 
Pete Christich, a U.S.-Canada relations officer with the EPA, says his agency takes the Ontario proposals seriously. 
``We felt the comments are very important regarding the U.S.-Canada relations and goals we have under the major air quality agreements our two countries have,'' he said in an interview. ``We really, really feel strongly we want to maintain a very close dialogue with Ontario.'' 
The EPA comments say that Ontario's proposals are unnecessarily complex. For example, the value of credits would vary depending on the distance between buyer and seller. 
A company selling credits to a polluter right next door would get full value for its credits. But if it sells to a polluter 1,200 kilometres distant, the value of the credit would be discounted 75 per cent. 
The EPA says this kind of feature would make the Ontario proposal ``complicated, potentially difficult to implement and may be burdensome to administer.'' 
Wellner at Pollution Probe gives the ministry credit for proposing tight, shrinking limits for emissions in the electricity sector: ``That's good. We're further ahead than we were.'' 
But he notes that industries outside the electricity sector will also be able to earn credits - and they're not subject to over-all caps. 
A metal smelter, for example, might earn credits for reducing the amount of sulphur dioxide it emits for each tonne of metal produces. But if it produces more tonnes of metal, the total amount of pollution it emits may actually increase under the current proposal, Wellner says. 
The ministry acknowledges that emissions-credit trading is a tool that ``by itself does not lead to reductions in total emissions.'' 
The last point is the key as the ministry examines the comments it has received from the EPA and other groups, Wellner says. 
``We have to ensure that it fits into a framework that ensures over-all emissions are reduced.''

COP-7 Update - November 8 

The negotiations continue today, in closed sessions, and aim to conclude tomorrow afternoon. The following key sticking points remain and have been sent to Ministers for final resolution:

Fungibility of emissions allowances, and credits generated under Joint Implementation and the Clean Development Mechanism.  Enron strongly supports full fungibility among allowances and credits.

The nature of compliance rules under the market-based mechanisms still need to be agreed upon. Specifically, whether the eligibility requirements to participate in the mechanisms are deemed as mandatory and whether parties that wish to use the mechanisms must agree to the compliance rules under Protocol.  Enron supports strong compliance rules and eligibility criteria, but urges that once a credit generating project has been approved by oversight bodies (CDM Executive Board; JI Supervisory Body) that the credits are secure (assuming no project-oriented defaults).

Sinks - 1) how sinks allowances will be able to be used in the first commitment period, 2008 - 2012 (hierarchy of credit submission). The Bonn Agreement stated that sinks allowances could not be banked.  The European Union seeks agreement on the order of submission of all credits used for compliance in the first commitment period.  2) Russia's request for an increase in its domestic sinks allocation in the first budget period.  The European Union has the most problem with increasing Russia's allocation and is working bilaterally with Russia to resolve this issue.  From an Enron perspective, the amount of Russian sinks allowances will likely impact prices and demand for greenhouse gas emissions allowances and credits, especially in the first commitment period. 

The nature and scope of what must be reported by national governments is still being debated.  Many of these are technical issues, but are important to ensure the integrity of the emissions trading system and tracking of national compliance with treaty obligations.

Of note, the oversight body of the Clean Development Mechanism, the Executive Board, has been largely appointed and is set to meet tomorrow afternoon.  Some of the countries represented as full members include Brazil, Costa Rica, Morocco, and Antigua and Barbuda. Amb. John Ashe (Antigua and Barbuda), a leader of this process (and good contact), will likely be elected to serve as the President of Executive Board.

Amb. Raul Estrada (Argentina), the man largely associated with hammering out the Kyoto Protocol, has been appointed to serve as a Chair of one of the key implementing bodies of the Conference of the Parties.  His leadership in the process is important as we work with TGS on greenhouse emission reduction projects. 

Under Secretary Paula Dobriansky made a formal statement to the conference plenary last night.  Of significance, it said that the science on climate change was uncertain, which was criticized in the hallways by many delegations and observers. 

The U.S. delegation will meet with industry twice today.

The Pew Center on Global Climate Change has posted a good outline of some of the key issues to be resolved at COP-7, please take a look at it if you would like additional background or feel free to send me an email.

There are two ways in which Enron Wind can generate credits: (1) Through "g=
overnment/regulatory body/ISO" issuing one REC for each MWh of electricity =
generated.  The REC represents all of the environmental attributes associat=
ed with the generation, including but not limited to CO2, NOX, SO2, PM, VOC=
s, location of generation of fuel/resource type.  The current programs for =
regulatory bodies or ISOs issuing RECs are: ERCOT (current); NePool (April =
'02); PJM (March '02 -- with the caveat that details have yet to be worked =
out in PJM); (2) Through voluntary bilateral contracts where Enron Wind sel=
ls of the attributes of the wind power.  They can choose to sell this separ=
ately or bundled with the Wind.  Finally, certification bodies such as Gree=
n-e, which offers voluntary certification for green products, intends to st=

FYI - From Today's Inside EPA
Governors Endorse Voluntary Carbon Reduction, New Source Review Reform
As Congress and the White House struggle to produce a strategy to limit power plant emissions of greenhouse gases, state governors are endorsing voluntary reductions of carbon dioxide (CO2), along with an overhaul of EPA's New Source Review regulations under the Clean Air Act.
An energy policy statement </secure/data_extra/dir_01/epa2001_3641.pdf>, approved August 7 by the National Governors Association at their annual meeting in Providence, recommends that Congress "significantly reduce and cap emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury, and voluntary reductions of carbon dioxide from electric power generators." This call to action puts political pressure on Congress and the White House, who are now in the process of deciding whether to add voluntary CO2 reductions to legislation regulating the other three pollutants.
But the governors also add a caveat that the regulation of pollutants should be flexible enough not to harm the economy. "The legislation should provide regulatory certainty by establishing reduction targets for emissions, phasing in reductions over a reasonable period of time, and providing market-based incentives, such as emissions-trading credits to help achieve the required reductions," the policy says.
A source with the association also says that states have already endorsed voluntary programs to lower CO2 emissions, and have said as much in earlier policy statements on climate change.
The governors are further recommending changes to EPA's New Source Review (NSR) program, which industry has long criticized as too costly and cumbersome because, in some cases, it requires permits for minor plant modifications. EPA Administrator Christine Todd Whitman has suggested that the Administration's proposal for limiting emissions may make new source review unnecessary.
But the governors urge EPA to reform NSR. "New Source Review requirements should be reformed to achieve improvements that enhance the environment and increase energy production capacity, while encouraging energy efficiency, fuel diversity, and the use of renewable resources," the policy reads.
And the governors are also asking for more state input into federal rules on energy and the environment. The policy asks that states be allowed to review regulations in EPA, the Department of Energy and other agencies before they are released for public comment.

FYI - while not reporting on new developments, this story provides a good overview and update on the clean air lawsuits.  EPA will likely include provisions on NSR enforcement when its report is released in September.

CLEAN AIR: NSR overhaul throws Northeast lawsuits into doubt 
The Bush administration's plans to overhaul New Source Review requirements for older power plants may make it more difficult for Northeastern states pursuing lawsuits against Midwestern and Southern ones over transboundary air pollution to win their cases. 
The suits allege that downwind emissions from older plants in the Midwest -- which are exempt from Clean Air Act standards -- are making it impossible for Northeastern states to meet pollution limits within their own boundaries. Those suits largely hinge on NSR policy, which requires older plants that expand or upgrade their facilities to comply with the same standards that new plants must meet. Since the U.S. EPA is considering revising the New Source Review enforcement program, the Bush administration is considering withdrawing federal participation in the lawsuits. 
If the federal government does pull out of the transboundary pollution suits, Northeastern states will have a much more difficult time winning their cases, state officials say. "We will pursue these cases no matter what happens in Washington," said New York Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer (D). "But losing out on the participation and resources of EPA and the Justice Department would be a substantial loss and would make our job much harder, no question." 
The lawsuits were brought by New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Hampshire and Vermont against 17 plants in Virginia, West Virginia, Indiana and Ohio (Richard Perez-Pena, New York Times <http://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/20/nyregion/20POLL.html>, Aug. 20). -- AGR

Nominees to get approved by EPW this week 
Nominees for several key environmental positions received few questions at a confirmation hearing last week, and approval by the Environment and Public Works Committee this week is expected to come as easily. Rescheduled due to the Sept. 11 terrorist attack, testimony and statements at the confirmation hearing reflected the need for quick work in getting the nominations done in light of other problems now faced by Congress. 
Senate Environment Committee Chairman Jim Jeffords (I-Vt.) said the committee will meet Tuesday to vote on the nominations. At the markup, the panel will also consider a bill on methyl tertiary butyl ether (see related story). 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission nominee Nils Diaz received direct questioning from Jeffords on what will now be done regarding nuclear security concerns relative to other possible terrorism threats. 
Diaz, who has been nominated to be NRC commissioner, said the commission has always been concerned about security issues and will continue to look at nuclear plants' safety. He said it would be difficult for terrorists to damage plants at this point, but nothing is fool-proof. 
"I assure you that if confirmed, I am going to make this one of my top priorities," Diaz said. 
Diaz previously served as an NRC commissioner from August 1996 until his term expired this year, and President Bush nominated him for the post again. 
Representatives of Friends of the Earth (FOE) passed out papers outlining their concerns with Bush's nominee for the Interior Department's assistant secretary for fish, wildlife and parks -- Harold Manson. 
If confirmed, Manson would oversee the Fish and Wildlife Service and National Park Service, both of which have significant maintenance backlogs. Manson, who would be the first African American to serve in that position, has been a judge in the California Superior Court since June 1998. From 1993 to 1998, he served as general counsel for the California Department of Fish and Game, and before that, outside counsel for the California Department of Conservation. 
Kristen Sykes, FOE's Interior Department watchdog, said that Manson's record with implementation of California's Endangered Species Act as well as involvement with land developers are just some of the reasons the group objects to the nomination. 
FOE also has concerns over Mike Parker, nominated to be the assistant secretary of the Army for civil works. If confirmed by the full Senate, the former congressman would be the head of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
Parker was elected to represent Mississippi's 4th District in 1988 as a Democrat and switched to the GOP in 1995. He gave up his seat to run for governor in 1999 but narrowly lost to Democrat Ronnie Musgrave. Parker's selection has been highly regarded by Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) but has been greeted with caution by environmental groups. 
FOE issued a letter highlighting Parker's actions in Congress, claiming that Parker engaged in attempts to "gut" the Clean Water Act and "ridiculed" fish restoration programs. 
Other nominees include Marianne Lamont Horinko to be the Environmental Protection Agency's assistant administrator for solid waste. Horinko said she will be looking at how to prioritize the Superfund budget and programs as well as ways to promote recycling. 
Earlier this month, Donald Schregardus, the former director of the Ohio EPA, ended his bid to serve as EPA's assistant administrator for the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance (see the 9/20 Environment and Energy Daily.) 
Mary Peters, Bush's nominee to head the Federal Highway Administration, also testified. If confirmed, Peters would oversee a $30 million budget and would take over just as the Senate prepares to launch hearings on the next transportation authorization bill. The current law, the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, expires in 2003. Peters has been director of the Arizona Department of Transportation, an agency with 4,800 employees and a $3 billion budget, since 1998.

Lisa,

Do you have a summary of GHG and/or CO2 program or possible programs as it pertains to the US? 
Also, is there a nice summary of the Kyoto Protocol as it stands?

I know you have sent me numerous e-mails, already.  Thanks.

FYI 

We are looking into whether this is a federal or state settlement.  More analysis shortly.

- Lisa

----
North Carolina: A compromise is expected to be unveiled today that would cut in half the $2 billion cost of combating pollution from the state's 14 coal-fired power plants. 

Under the compromise, Duke Power and Carolina Power and Light would be committed to decreasing their sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions by approximately two-thirds by 2007. 

An additional requirement to decrease sulfur dioxide by about another 50 percent by 2013 could be canceled by the state Department of Environment and Natural Resources, and negotiators found the $1 billion in savings by not counting this phase of pollution cuts.

Trevor:

I have asked Mary Schoen in my group to pull together an analysis of exactly what units are in and out for 2003 and 2004.  She should have something ready for you hopefully today.

Here's what we've determined from a broader analysis:  
All cogeneration sources are out indefinitely for the 126 and SIP Call while EPA re-promulgates rules for those sources.  EPA was ready to re-release rules as it pertained to the SIP Call, but this was pulled back in the Bush review of last-minute Clinton Administration efforts.  EPA will now try to solve definitional and budget problems for cogens for both the 126 and SIP and release new rules -- timing is not certain, but it is unlikely they will do anything in time to meet the May 31, 2004 SIP Call compliance date.
As of right now, all non-EGUs (industrial boilers, etc.) are included in the 126 -- they should expect to comply as of May 1, 2003.  However, since the 126 is delayed for all EGUs, it is likely that non-EGU lawyers will petition either the court or EPA to put in place the same delay for non-EGUs.  It is hard to see how a trading/compliance system would work in 2003 with just non-EGUs in the program and the majority of sources out until the SIP Call hits in 2004.  I'll know more on this point in the coming weeks.  I'd bet on a delay for non-EGUs.
As you know, the OTC states have all agreed to meet SIP Call compliance targets for summer 2003.  (SIPs have already been submitted and approved by EPA).  This means regardless of the 126 ruling, sources in OTC states will need to comply in May 2003.
So basically, EGUs that get a one-year break because of this week's 126 ruling are EGUs in areas that would have been covered by the 126 Rule and that are NOT in OTC states who start SIP Call compliance in 2003.  Mary's analysis should show exactly which units are in for 2003 and which are in for 2004.

Just to confuse you more -- another interesting issue to watch in the coming months:  the delay the Court placed on the 126 came from the litigation ("technical amendments case") that ordered EPA to go back and re-formulate growth factors.  Not only was the 126 Rule included in that case, but the SIP Call was as well -- EPA has to re-do growth budgets for both.  Utility lawyers could very well make the case that the SIP call should also be put on hold until EPA resolves the growth factor issue (basically that the court should treat the 126 and SIP call the same).  I'll let you know if the litigants make that move, because it could very well mean that the May 31, 2004 SIP compliance date gets delayed.

FYI only
Louisiana: An illusion of cleaner air has been created by the state's chemical emission trading program, through the use of invalid or non-existent credits, environmentalists say. 

State officials and industry representatives deny misusing the system.

FYI only
Statoil's clean ships could offset NOx emissions 

UK: August 8, 2001 

LONDON - Norwegian energy firm Statoil said on Tuesday savings in acid-rain-causing nitrogen oxide (NOx) from two new low-emitting ships would allow it to meet its NOx emissions reduction targets from one new power station. 

"We've been given permission to credit these NOx reductions against land-based projects," Knut Barland, vice-president for environment at Statoil told Reuters. 
"And the kind of reduction we'd be getting on these ships would meet the NOx emission reduction target for one of these (planned) power plants." 
The North Sea supply ships are small compared to cargo ships, but are so powerful they can be used to drag around oil rigs. 
They are usually so thirsty for diesel that they pump out as much NOx pollution each day as several thousand cars. 
But by designing each of them to run on Liquified Natural Gas (LNG), gas that has been super-cooled until it condenses as liquid, NOx emissions from the two ships can be cut by 85 percent or 420 tonnes a year. 
"That means one ship is equivalent to half the (NOx) emissions from a gas-fired power station," said Aksel Skjervheim of Naturgass Vest, which will provide the ships with their super-cooled fuel. 
UNIQUE GOVERNMENT APPROVAL 
Statoil's Barland said that the government had given it a unique permission to credit the NOx reduction against land-based emissions, which could be from any one of five projects including two controversial 400 megawatt gas-fired power stations Statoil is involved in. 
He said the power plants, one at Kaarstoe and one at Kollsnes near Bergen, were planned by a joint venture between Statoil, Norsk Hydro and Statkraft. 
They are not controversial because of their NOx emissions, but because of their carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. 
"We've been granted permission for the CO2 as long as we comply with Kyoto, but keeping the NOx down to the five parts per million (ppm) limit (specified by the government) could be very expensive," said Barland. 
Norway imposes a five ppm limit on NOx emissions in some regions aimed at curbing acid rain. 
"Constructing a NOx treatment plant would be a very expensive and very old-fashioned way, and therefore we've been given the opportunity of finding a third party solution," he said. 
The shipping NOx offset deal works out comparatively cheaply. 
The two hi-specification ships will cost Statoil an extra nine million Norwegian crowns per year to run, compared to conventional diesel-powered ships. 
But when converted into NOx credits, they would allow Statoil to cut emmissions at a cost of 22 crowns per kilogram (kg), compared to 30-40 crowns per kg by building NOx treatment into a new power plant. 
While this approach to emissions might help overcome the NOx hurdle for the Kaarstoe and Kollsnes plants, the project might yet stumble on CO2 limits. 
"We could buy CO2 emissions permits, but there's still a lot of political uncertainty over the cost and that is something we're having to consider very carefully," said Barland. 
He said much would depend on Kyoto's final mechanism for CO2 emmissions trading and the extent to which Norway adopted the measures. 
Barland said he hoped the cost of future LNG-powered ships would fall as more LNG filling-stations were built around Norway's coast, and shipyards gained the right expertise. 
To date only one LNG-powered ship has been built, a Norwegian fjord ferry, which runs on fuel from Norway's only LNG filling station, the Aga-owned 15,000 tonne per year (tpy) mini-LNG plant at Tjeldbergodden. 
Naturgass Vest, in which Statoil is a partner, hopes to build Norway's second mini-LNG plant of 30-40,000 tpy at Kollsnes and later on another near Stavanger. 
"That will make LNG-powered coastal shipping possible in Norway," said Barland. "Next time we issue a contract, we hope LNG will be competitive in its own right."

Yesterday, the European Commission adopted a climate change package, which includes a draft directive on emissions trading, an instrument of EU ratification of the Kyoto Protocol and policies and measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Please the attached press release outlining the package.
 
Major provisions of the draft emissions trading directive include:


The emissions trading scheme has two phases -- first phase (2005 - 2007), second phase (2008 - 2012) 

Penalties for non-compliance in first phase are 50 Euros per tonne or twice the average market price, whichever is higher; beyond 2008 the penalty would be 100 Euros per tonne or twice the average market price between 2008 and 2012 ,whichever is higher.

Permits are required in first phase for industrial and energy activities covered, chemicals and waste incinerators are not included in first phase (see Annex I of draft directive for the sectors covered)

Unrestricted access to the market by intermediaries

Banking allowed, but could be limited by individual Member States in first phase

National allocation (for free) in first phase, with provisions for new entrants (unspecificed); harmonized allocation rules by 2008

Possibilty to link with non-EU national emissions trading programs by MOU in first phase (aimed at accession states)

Only CO2 emissions are covered in the first phase, expanded to all GHG gases covered by 2008

Renewable energy certificates are not integrated with GHG allowances under the program

Emissions credits not incorporated into program, but desireable in future.  The EC will address this under a separate directive

I will work with Peter, Nailia, Diana and others to further analyse its implications for Enron.

I spoke to George Hienen at the air office and Rubby Gil at the Northern Regional office -- George suggested that I speak with Rubby.

To determine whether the VOC ERC would qualify under the new rule - it would need to 1) be a major source and 2) represent emissions (post-1990) or be a pre-1990 ERC that was approved as part of the attainment plan.

The regional office confirmed that it is a major source and gave me a date of Jan. 31, 1998.  So the certificate meets the criteria.  

Just to double check the date - I asked Rubby Gil to check the file to confirm the date -- making sure that 1998 was the original date of reduction.

I will let you know when I hear back.

Thanks.

Lisa,

Can you please call the regional office and confirm this for me.  I am not 100% confident with whom I talked to at the office.  George gave me a generic answer for certificates which I believe puts the certificate in question in an attainment area.  I am new to VOCs and the terminology which causes problems at times on the phone with these people.  Also, try to talk to somebody besides Kai at the regional office.   

Thank you.  certificate number: N140-1 Cranbrook Associates

The reduction credit was given in 1998 (I do not have the exact date close by).  I didn't give George the certificate number but he implied that it would be good.  Kai at the regional office did not seem to know exactly what the attainment area meant.  He said it was valid.

I believe this is valid, but I felt the regional office was unsure of the legislation.

The website above has the link to the list of ERCs that are part of the approved attainment plan.

If it is pre-1990, and could be used under the new rule, it will be on this list.

If it is not on this list, we would need to contact the Northern regional office to inquire into its history.  If it is post 1990 it would be part of the baseline and would also work -- so we need to know the date.

In the case of the certificate you mention, it is not on the list, so we would need to contact the regional office to find out its status.

The main number for the office is 209 557-6400.  Jim Swaney is the manager -- but an engineer might be able to look it up quickly.  Or we could fax the request to 209-557-6475.  While EPA says that this type of request is fairly rare, it is not unusual.

Please let me know if you need further help on this.

-Lisa

FYI only - =20

Please see some preliminary information on proposals in New York State to r=
educe carbon dioxide emissions.

I am awaiting more information from Suffolk County and more information on =
which entities this would impact as well as the scale of the reductions. =
=20

Please let me know if you have any questions.

-------------------------------------------------

Analysis of New York Legislation and Action on Carbon Regulation

Background

Government interest in addressing local air pollution and global warming ha=
s led to several initiatives in New York to reduce carbon dioxide emissions=
 (CO2).  CO2 is a greenhouse gas that contributes to global climate change.=
  In the absence of a national U.S. approach to reduce greenhouse gas emiss=
ions, several states and municipalities, mostly in the Northeast, have pass=
ed legislation or initiated programs aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emiss=
ions.  Currently, the U.S. Congress and the Bush Administration are conside=
ring domestic plans to address climate change.  However, in contrast to sta=
tements made during the presidential campaign, President Bush has said that=
 he would not support mandatory regulation of CO2 at power plants under fed=
eral programs to regulate multiple pollutants (NOx, SO2 and mercury) or to =
combat climate change.  Several moderate and Northeastern Republicans as we=
ll as many Democrats support inclusion of CO2 in multipollutant plans.  The=
 U.S. Senate will likely consider climate change legislation and could cons=
ider multipollutant legislation before the end of the year.  Hearings are u=
nderway, and several bills have been introduced, but the timing on Senate f=
loor consideration is uncertain.  The U.S. House of Representatives is not =
moving as fast on either issue, making the adoption of a national climate c=
hange plan or new federal regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions a=
t least a year or, more likely, several years away.=20

Suffolk County Legislation to Reduce CO2 Emissions from Power Plants

In late July, Suffolk County Executive Robert Gaffney signed legislation to=
 regulate CO2 emissions from electric generating units and steam generating=
 units in Suffolk County with a capacity of more than 25 megawatts.  This i=
s the first of such measures adopted in NY state and will go into effect in=
 March 2002.  Quarterly reporting is required, and Suffolk's Division of th=
e Environment will issue rules by October 1, 2001.

The initial allowable emission rate would be 1,800 pounds of CO2 per MWh. I=
n each subsequent year, the rate would be reduced by 1% for each 100 MW of =
new generating capacity added in the county, until a 20% reduction has been=
 achieved. Power plant owners could comply by upgrading equipment, switchin=
g from oil to gas, purchasing CO2 credits, or investing in energy efficienc=
y or renewables. If they failed to comply, plant owners would be fined $ 2 =
per ton of CO2 above the limits in the first year, and $ 3/ton in following=
 years.=20

Most of the plants on Long Island were built by Long Island Lighting and ac=
quired in 1998 by KeySpan Energy when LILCO merged the generation and gas p=
ortions of its business with Brooklyn Union Gas to form KeySpan.  KeySpan h=
as about 2,880 MW in Suffolk County, including two big steam stations and s=
ome combustion turbines.  Some say that KeySpan could meet the target by re=
-powering its steam plants to combined cycle.  However, according to KeySpa=
n that could require coming off line for up to a year, which in Suffolk's t=
ight energy market would be disrupting.  According to the County, there are=
 several new natural gas merchant plants under development that would also =
be required to meet the standard.  Industry met with the County officials a=
nd substantial revisions to the legislation were made. =20

Emissions trading is permitted, and press reports indicate that credits can=
 be generated inside or outside of Suffolk County.  I am looking to confirm=
 this, as initial drafts of the bill stated that credits must be generated =
in Suffolk County.  Rules for quantifying emissions credits have not yet be=
en set.

Issues for Enron: =20

Will this have an impact on long term power contracts in Suffolk County?
Does EES have customers in Suffolk County that could generate credits under=
 the program?
If credits can be generated by uncapped sources or sources outside of Suffo=
lk County, does Enron have credits to sell?

New York State Assembly Multipollutant Bill

In late June, the New York Assembly passed a bill that would regulate emiss=
ions of NOx, SO2, and CO2 from electric generators of 15 MW capacity or lar=
ger. The bill requires the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) t=
o adopt regulations implementing reductions in emissions of CO2 by January =
1, 2002 and requires the DEC to establish a cap on total emissions of CO2, =
equivalent to 1990 emission levels, by January 1, 2007.=20

The State Senate is also considering multipollutant legislation, but is not=
 expected to pass companion legislation.  Consensus does not exist in the S=
enate on regulation of CO2.

Further, observers feel that the crafters are not fully aware of the implic=
ations of these bills, increasing the likelihood that they will not move fu=
rther anytime soon.

Governor's Climate Change Task Force

In early June, NY Governor George Pataki today announced the formation of a=
 Greenhouse Gas Task Force to develop policy recommendations for greenhouse=
 gas emissions and global warming. The Task Force is comprised of represent=
atives from the business community, environmental organizations, state agen=
cies, and universities.=20

Pataki has been outspoken on calling on the federal government to take acti=
on on multipollutant plans, and has encouraged the inclusion of CO2.  =20

The Task Force will report back to Governor Pataki with specific policy rec=
ommendations on or before November 15, 2001.  The recommendation will be co=
nsidered for inclusion in a draft state energy plan to be completed in Dece=
mber 2001. A final report from the Task Force is due by March 2002, and the=
 final energy plan will be released in the Spring of 2002.

The Task Force is just getting underway, and its members have divergent vie=
ws on whether to regulate CO2.  Two subgroups exist, one that deals with re=
gistries and trading (brokers, marketers, some NGOS and industry) and the o=
ther deals with power plants (mostly power generators). =20

At this time, the power plant group tends to oppose mandatory CO2 regulatio=
n, while the registry and trading subgroup is more supportive of it.
=20
NYC Council Proposal to Reduce CO2 Emissions

The NY City Council is considering legislation to regulate CO2 as well.  Si=
milar in some fashion to the Suffolk County bill, it would require power ge=
nerators greater than 25 MW to reduce CO2, eventually leading to a 20% redu=
ction from 1999 levels. =20

The regulation would apply to units operating in 1997-1999.  Newer units wi=
ll not be part of the overall reduction, but must meet emission rates. A tr=
ading program would be possible and there is a fine of $3 for every ton abo=
ve the allowed emission rates.=20

Trading is permitted, and credits could be generated from energy efficiency=
, renewables, fuel switching, etc. from other entities in the City. =20

There is fairly wide support for this legislation and despite an election t=
his fall that will result is significant turn-over in Council members, obse=
rvers feel that the legislation will pass in the next year (if not this fal=
l).

Dear Trevor and Michael,

Attached please find a regulatory background document on global climate change and greenhouse gas emissions.  I have also included a short slide presentation summarizing the Kyoto Protocol.  Finally, I have attached two charts on greenhouse gas emissions trading programs: 1) government-run and 2) key voluntary programs and initiatives.  I will start working on a state chart next week.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

-Lisa

Lisa,

Do you have a summary of GHG and/or CO2 program or possible programs as it pertains to the US? 
Also, is there a nice summary of the Kyoto Protocol as it stands?

I know you have sent me numerous e-mails, already.  Thanks.

Dear Trevor,

Per your request here is what I have learned about the changes to the rules for PM 10 ERCs in the San Joaquin Valley Air District.

As part of EPA's recent action on the San Joaquin Air District's State Implementation Plan (SIP), PM ERCs generated in the nonattainment season (October - March) can now be used during the attainment season.  Previously, nonattainment PM ERCs could only be used as offsets in the quarter in which they were generated.

This provides more flexibility to holders of nonattainment PM ERCs and allows broader usage.

Part of the impetus for this change is that there were several cotton gins in the valley that closed in the fourth quarter, and the ERCs generated by the shutdowns could not be used throughout the year. The district believes this change is better for air quality and provides more flexibility.

The change has the effect of spreading PM ERCs from the nonattainment season to the attainment season.

The change is effective Aug. 20, 2001

Please see the link to the regulation below (page 23, Section 4.13.17)

http://www.valleyair.org/Workshops/postings/06-21-01/rule2201.pdf

There were two other regulatory changes as a result of EPA's action that might interest you.

1)  Page 22, 4.13.1 - ERCs from major source shutdowns and curtailments previously could only be used for replacement major sources or minor sources.  Under the rule change they can now be used for other major sources, as long as the ERCs are part of the EPA approved attainment plan.  (if you would like to see the lists of these pre-approved ERCs please let me know). 

2) Page 3, 3.7 - Baseline changes - A unit can use the pre-project potential to emit baseline if it falls under four categories (a unit located at a non-Major source; highly utilized unit at a major source; a fully-offset unit at a major source; a clean emissions unit at a major source).
 
If a unit does not fall under these categories it will need to follow rules for historic emissions, which could mean that it will need to acquire additional offsets.  However, the District believes that it captured all major sources through these categories.

Please call me with any questions.  Also, are we still on for our call on Tuesday, August 14 at 9:30 am Houston time?

http://www.valleyair.org/busind/plans/Appendex_D_96_ROP.pdf

The website above has the link to the list of ERCs that are part of the approved attainment plan.

If it is pre-1990, and could be used under the new rule, it will be on this list.

If it is not on this list, we would need to contact the Northern regional office to inquire into its history.  If it is post 1990 it would be part of the baseline and would also work -- so we need to know the date.

In the case of the certificate you mention, it is not on the list, so we would need to contact the regional office to find out its status.

The main number for the office is 209 557-6400.  Jim Swaney is the manager -- but an engineer might be able to look it up quickly.  Or we could fax the request to 209-557-6475.  While EPA says that this type of request is fairly rare, it is not unusual.

Please let me know if you need further help on this.

-Lisa

During its 26th annual conference this week, New England governors and Eastern Canadian premiers adopted a self-monitoring resolution to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  Goals set under the plan are:
reduce regional GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2010
reduce regional GHG emissions by 10 percent below 1990 levels by 2020
reduce GHG emissions to "eliminate any dangerous to the climate" (perhaps as much as a 75 - 85 percent cut in emissions) over an unspecified longer timeframe

The goals are set with the understanding that they will be met regional and with flexibility for localities to determine the most appropriate emissions reduction strategy.  Development of a regional GHG registry as well as consideration of emissions trading were included in the plan as well as longer term goals related to reducing carbon dioxide emissions per megawatt hour of electricity within the region (20 percent reduction by 2025) and energy conservation (20 percent increase in region by 2025). 

Recommendations on the development of a regional GHG registry will be presented at next year's conference.  A Climate Change Steering Committee will coordinate this work.  Input from governments and stakeholders, including industry is expected.
 
IMPACT: The resolution is non-binding, but does call on states and provinces to develop climate change action plans, which could result in state level regulation and regional (including cross border) trading of greenhouse gas emissions.

Several New England states are considering legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, though no mandatory state-level greenhouse gas programs have been adopted.

The adoption of this resolution demonstrates the growing awareness of global climate change among New England and Canadian constituencies and an interest among policymakers to take steps to mitigate its potential impacts.

Please see the links below to the resolution and the climate change action plan (which includes the emission reduction goals).

Please see the attached comments developed by the Environmental Strategies Group on behalf of Enron Canada in response to Ontario's draft emissions trading regulation for NOx and SO2.
  
Comments were submitted this week and were coordinated with ENA Canada, EGM Emissions and Government Affairs, as the proposal could impact power trading, emissions trading, and power development/investment.

Please let me know if you have any questions on the proposed regulation or Enron's submission.

Jeff Keeler and I wanted to send you an advanced copy of an article that we co-wrote that will be published in the November 2001 quarterly Emissions Marketing Association newsletter.  The newsletter is distributed to several hundred leaders in the emissions market industry -- domestically and internationally.  The publication will also be distributed at the November 2001 climate change Ministerial meeting, which is attended by over a thousand delegates and observers, including government officials, businesses and media representatives.  The article supported multi-pollutant approaches as a means of addressing climate change and providing certainty to firms developing risk management strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  

Please let us know if you have any questions or comments.

As the article below discusses in more detail, EPA has announced it will delay any recommendations on New Source Review reform until September, when it releases a more complete package of Clean Air/Multipollutant reform legislation.  NSR/multipollutant issues will be in the forefront in September, with the release of EPA's plan and congressional consideration of these issues in hearings and "stakeholder" meetings.   Enron will remain closely involved in these efforts -- we have been invited to participate in Senate Environment Committee stakeholder meetings on the topic, and we are in close contact with EPA and the White House as they develop their plan.

Consideration of these issues in a larger "package" will present an opportunity for reform not only for limited segments of the power sector, but for all sources -- existing and new.   NSR reform will always be criticized by environmentalists, but adding NSR to the debate with multipollutant emission reductions could open avenues for some interesting deals to be cut over NSR revisions and various pollutant cap levels.

Fearing Backlash, EPA To Package NSR Study As Part Of Utility Emissions Reduction Plan

Fearing a backlash of criticism, EPA Administrator Christine Todd Whitman has announced that the agency is delaying release of its long-awaited study on its new source review (NSR) program so that it can package the study as part of the Bush administration's proposed "three-pollutant" emissions reduction plan for power plants, which is scheduled for release next month.

Whitman's Aug. 14 announcement, which came following consultations with President Bush, came just three days before
EPA was scheduled to release the results of its 90-day review of NSR, the Clean Air Act program that requires facilities to obtain permits when installing new or modified emissions sources.

"Our review of the NSR regulation is part of our larger effort to craft a new, comprehensive strategy to combat air pollution, and I am not prepared to come to any conclusions about one isolated issue before we finish work on our entire proposal," Whitman said.

In recent weeks, administration officials have faced a slew of criticism from state attorney generals, environmentalists and other critics who have charged that the review would recommend scaling back the program and allow the Bush administration to "pardon" polluters.

Whitman has previously said that the administration's proposal to limit emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (NOx) and mercury would set sufficiently strict limits to make NSR and other Clean Air Act requirements unnecessary.

Whitman pointed to a recent National Governors Association policy calling for NSR reform as justification for the administration's forthcoming effort.  "This bipartisan action by the nation's governors provides a firm foundation for consensus and action this fall on this major environmental goal of the administration," she said.

However, Whitman's announcement drew strong criticism from environmentalists, who charged that the administration was seeking to hide the NSR reforms in its overall emissions reduction plan. "The administration should not expect that it can hide the roll-back of these important clean air protections into an emissions reduction package. That would be as obvious as putting a cheap frame on an ugly picture," according to the environmental group Clear the Air.

The group said the NSR program was "safe for now," adding that the Bush administration should acknowledge that a host of favorable comments submitted to EPA as part of the review should force the agency to admit that the NSR program is an essential element of the Clean Air Act.

Excerpt from EPA Press Release U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Christie Whitman announced today that EPA will propose a comprehensive strategy to significantly reduce air pollution and protect public health that will be released in September. EPA will incorporate its review of the New Source Review (NSR) program into this comprehensive strategy, and as a result, will not release its NSR report this week. Whitman spoke with President Bush today about this important proposal.

Our top priority is protecting public health and the environment, and we are in the final stages of developing a comprehensive strategy that will allow us to take the next step forward into a new generation of air pollution controls for the 21st century," Whitman said. "This fall, we will put forward an ambitious proposal that will reduce air pollution from power plants significantly more than the existing system. Subsequently, we will release the NSR report called for by the National Energy Policy."

EPA and the White House are working to finalize the details of an ambitious legislative proposal that will set strict limits on utility emissions of the three major air pollutants that affect public health - nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and mercury - through the use of an innovative and effective market-based approach. In addition, the air pollution reduction strategy will address concerns about the NSR program's effect on energy efficiency and capacity.

The Administration's proposal will maintain stringent health-based standards and establish firm, mandatory caps on levels of pollution, while providing industry with the flexibility to find the most cost-effective means of meeting those standards. This approach would also significantly reduce the administrative burden on state and federal environmental agencies, allowing them to devote limited resources to other programs.

Dear Trevor,

Per your request yesterday, please see the information below on several non-U.S. national emissions trading programs.

The information on the UK and EU greenhouse gas emissions trading programs was provided by Enron Europe regulatory and commercial groups, specifically Diana Profir and Mustafa Hussain.

As you can see below, the UK released a framework document yesterday.  It is lengthy and worthy of analysis.

For now, I wanted to get you this information quickly - but will plan to schedule a call next week with Enron Europe to discuss specific questions related the programs -- I know I have several.  Please let me know if you would like to participate and when you are free next week (in the early am due to the time difference in London).

In the meantime, please let me know if you have specific, immediate questions on the UK or EU programs. 

As for Australia, they are considering establishing a greenhouse gas emissions trading program and have engaged in consultations with stakeholders -- including industry -- and released discussion papers (see link below for more information).  However, the government has stated recently that they would only implement a mandatory national emissions trading program if an international program was developed and in place.  In light of the U.S. position on climate change and the slow pace of rule development on international emissions trading, activity on the Australian emissions trading program has been largely stalled.  Australia is still in a "wait and see" mode.  

Related to this, a pilot greenhouse gas emissions trading program was launched under the Sidney Futures Exchange in 1998, but has not taken off.  Further, Australia "in principle" is looking into providing credit for early actors.  A discussion paper on early crediting was released in 2000, with a comment period ending in March 2001. See link below for link to submissions - no further action on early crediting has been taken.

Subject:	RE: Short summaries of UK and EU emissions trading plans

The following link provides a copy of the UK Emissions Trading Scheme (framework document and summary) published yesterday by the UK government.  I have also attached for your reference a brief presentation of highlights of that scheme side-by-side with other UK climate change policies (i.e. ROCs scheme and climate change levy)

http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/climatechange/trading/index.htm

 

As for the EU, the following is a summary of the latest draft of the EU Emissions Trading Directive:

The Community emissions trading will commence in 2005.  The scheme will initially run until 31 December 2007, followed by a multi-year period to coincide with the Kyoto Protocol's commitment period (2008 - 2012)

The EU Directive Proposal places direct CO2 emissions from specified sources within a Community regulatory framework, limiting emissions from specified sectors and imposing penalties for non-compliance

Each Member State will make its initial allocations on the basis of its overall commitment under the Burden Sharing Agreement

As envisioned, there will be adjustments in Member States' quota to account for allowances traded between installations located in different Member States, thus making it possible to keep the overall EU Kyoto target intact

The Community Scheme proposed covers only CO2 emissions; other GHG emissions will be included upon resolving monitoring, reporting and verification issues

The Directive only covers emissions from 4,000 - 5,000 CO2-intensive "installations" that in aggregate comprise around 40% of total EU CO2 emissions.  These installations are already covered by the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) Directive

Dear Mike,

Please see the link above for documents under 40 CFR PART 81.

I just spoke with Jeff, and he agreed that the best route would be to contact EPA re: areas that you are note sure of their attainment status.

Please send me the areas that you are ensure of and I will look into it.

As for other states that are pursuing bills to limit emissions trading - CT was pursing this for a while, but it has cooled down a bit in the press.  I will look into this, as well as KT and Maine.

Please call with any questions. 

Talk to you soon,

Lisa

FYI - two stories -- are these stories consistent with what you are hearing?  Thanks.

German industry slams EU emissions trading plan 
GERMANY: August 29, 2001 
FRANKFURT - The German energy industry was firmly at loggerheads with government and European Commission officials Tuesday over plans to introduce an EU state-wide, company-based emissions trading system by 2005. 
Emissions trading - buying and selling the right to pollute - is one of the measures suggested by the UN-sponsored deal agreed in Kyoto in 1997 to help industrialized countries cut greenhouse gases (GHGs) linked to climate change. 
The Commission is working on a draft emissions trading directive, which it aims to present by the end of the year. 
"We have been formally involved (in talks), but none of the industry's comments have been taken into account in the EU's draft directive on emissions trading," Eberhard Meller, head of the association of German power suppliers VDEW, told delegates at a Euroforum conference in Frankfurt. 
Germany's own emissions trading working group aims to present a model for carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions trading by September and put a draft law before parliament in December. 
CO2 from fossil fuel combustion is the easiest of the six GHGs to monitor and accounts for 87 percent of them. It is thus the most suited to start off trading, said the Environment Minstry's Franzjosef Schafhausen, who heads the working group. 
An outstanding issue in the EU's plan, the Commission's Peter Zapfel said, is whether participation in emissions trading should be mandatory or voluntary. 
German industry opposes a mandatory company-based approach as running counter to its existing voluntary commitment to reduce CO2 emissions and insists a global country-based scheme would offer greater incentives to participate. 
Christof Bauer of German chemicals firm Degussa dismissed Schafhausen's warning that companies that do not participate in trading could face an increase in Germany's existing eco-tax, while those that do could have it removed. 
"Why should I have to make a choice between the devil and the deep blue sea? Maybe I am bit behind the moon, but I don't see any dirty dealing like that happening," he said. 
There is a stark contrast in the working group, industry sources said, between the environment ministry, which supports the EU-wide company scheme and the economics ministry and a large part of industry that want a country-based system. 
"We prefer an EU-wide company based scheme because it will mean a cost saving of one third compared with implementing emissions trading on a national level," Zapfel said. 
But Joachim Hein, of industrial consumers group BDI, argued that Kyoto itself calls for national emissions caps. 
"ET at a company level would ruin the Kyoto Protocol in fact, since international industries fear they will have to comply with state-of-the-art technologies, or be punished." 
Degussa's Bauer added that, with a company scheme, international companies would simply move their emissions to countries where it was cheaper to emit 
VDEW, BDI and Degussa said they want to be allowed to work with the "current tool kit" - the voluntary commitment, eco tax and laws designed to support combined heat and power (CHP) generation and the use of renewable energies. 
The government agreed with industry in June to target a 23 million tonne cut in CO2 by 2010 through CHP use, as part of a total 45 million tonnes/year reduction target. 
"This is not a one-way agreement - the federal government guaranteed it will not try to take any regulatory steps to achieve these voluntary targets," VDEW's Meller said. 
The associations and Degussa called instead for a "test phase" of voluntary participation in emissions trading.

German HEW urges industry to back emissions trading 
GERMANY: August 29, 2001 
FRANKFURT - Hamburg-based utility HEW spoke as a lone voice within Germany's energy industry yesterday in its support for emissions trading, the market tool that allows companies to buy and sell the right to pollute. 
German energy industry associations had earlier criticised the European Commission's plan to introduce an EU-wide company-based scheme by 2005 as conflicting with their existing voluntary commitments to reduce emissions. 
"We get enquiries from rating agencies on how we will manage our environmental risk, since it could affect the rating they give us and the funding we receive from banks," HEW's head of future energy concepts Helmuth-Michael Groscurth told delegates at a Euroforum conference in Frankfurt. 
"The cost of carbon over the next decade could be as high as $5 to $15 per tonne and you need a tool to hedge against that risk." 
Emissions trading was proposed by the UN-sponsored Kyoto Protocol in 1997 to help industrialised countries cut greenhouse gases, chiefly carbon dioxide, that have been linked to climate change. 
Germany's target of a 21 percent cut in GHGs from 1990 levels by 2010 forms most of the EU's Protocol commitment. 
Groscurth said it was too much of risk to see if Germany could achieve that target by voluntary commitment alone. He defended the proposed setting of absolute targets on companies in place of existing agreed reduction goals. 
"Kyoto's absolute reduction goal for Germany isn't going to change, so we have to have absolute limits on company emissions. And it isn't a choice between emissions trading or nothing, but a case of trading along with other reduction measures." 
HEW concluded the first transatlantic emissions trading deal last year when it sold emissions rights to Canada's biggest investor-owned power generator, TransAlta . It also did a deal with an Australian firm to buy rights. 
"The TransAlta deal's volumes were so small that it will not affect Germany's target, but we did the the Australian deal in the same price range of 50 cents to $1 per tonne of CO2 and even made a profit on it," Groscurth said. 
Germany should not believe that because the world's biggest polluter, the United States, had pulled out of the Kyoto pact, U.S. firms were not preparing for emissions trading, he added. 
"A lot is happening in the U.S. at the state and company level, and once they are fit, the U.S. government will take notice. Then the U.S. will overtake us and we will have to play by their rules," he said. 
Groscurth also noted plans to set up a Chicago Climate Exchange with a budget of $760,000. 
Joachim Hein of the German industrial consumer group BDI said its members were sceptical about the role of emissions "verifiers" in the Commission's emissions trading plan. 
"I could see firms simply having to make a declaration on emissions levels, which would be monitored just like a company's balance sheet is monitored by independent auditors, with spot checks like on income tax returns," Groscurth said. 
He supported the German emissions trading working group's aim to distribute most emissions certificates under a system of free allocation according to historical emissions, or grandfathering, and, in lesser part, by auction. 
"A large share by grandfathering would avoid a high threshold for entry into trading, while an auction would give a price signal and allow new companies to get involved," he said.

The Ministry of Environment in Ontario released its final emissions trading regulation yesterday.   Based on a quick review, several changes were made that Enron asked for in its submission earlier this month.
 
Specifically:

OPG's allocations will be partitioned through 2007 (not 2010)
Allowances will be allocated on a prospective basis, baned on the previous year's generation (output).  Estimations of energy production will be used (subject to a true-up) to accommodate new generators which come on line during a compliance year.  
Direction and distance provisions that would discount emissions reductions credits (foreign allowances) have been removed.
The SO2 set aside for renewable energy and energy efficiency is raised to 4 KT (NOx --expressed as NO - remains at 1 KT).

There is no restriction on banking of credits.
ERC credit lifetime extended from five to seven years.
Approval of ERCs by the Ministry of the Environment before registration of the credits (rather than after registration but before use).  

Please see the summary of the regulation below compiled by Lisa DeMarco of Donahue Ernst & Young in Toronto.  Environmental Strategies will analyze the regulation and be back in touch with more information on its impact for Enron.  Do not hesitate to contact me with any questions.

<http://204.40.253.254/envregistry/016576er.htm> 
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
On October 24, 2001, the Ontario Minister of Environment released the final emissions trading regulation which includes several significant changes to the draft regulation. The release of this regulation and an additional regulation governing emissions from the Lakeview generating station is broadly thought to signify the likely opening of the Ontario electricity market in Spring, 2002 (please see attached article).  

A brief overview of the central aspects of the Ontario emissions trading regulation, which sets out a hybrid ("Cap, Credit and Trade") system of emissions trading for Ontario, follows 
 
Applicability: 

Starting in 2002, the regulation will apply to Ontario Power Generation's ("OPG") 6 fossil fuel generating stations.  In 2004, the requirements will be extended to large (>25MW) Independent Power Producers ("IPPs") in the province.  Most notably, the regulation is accompanied by an announcement that caps and the associated hybrid trading scheme will be extended to other major industrial sectors in the near future.  Consultation with those sectors regarding the level of their sector caps will commence immediately. 

Caps: 

NOx (measured as NO): 

An overall cap of 36 KT in 2002 will decline to 28 KT in 2010.  The cap will be partitioned between OPG and IPPs  between 2004 and 2007.  Each year renewable and energy conservation projects will be eligible for 1 KT of "set-aside" allowances.  Starting in 2007, the allocation of allowances will also be subject to a North/South partition to comply with obligations under the Ozone Annex to the Canada / US A Air Quality Agreement.  Trading between these areas is not, however, restricted. 

SO2: 

An overall cap of 157.5 KT in 2002 will decline to 131 KT in 2007.  The cap will not be partitioned between OPG and IPPs and will apply to OPG facilities in 2002 and all large IPPs in 2004.  Each year renewable and energy conservation projects will be eligible for 4 KT of "set-aside" allowances.   

Allocation: 

Prospective allocation of allowances will be on the basis of a facility's pro-rata share of energy production (output) in the province.  OPG will receive a corporate based allocation each year until the end of 2007, at which point all allocations will be on a facility basis.  The proposed mechanism allows for estimations of energy production to be used (subject to a true-up) to accommodate new generators which come on line during a compliance year.  Measurement of emissions must be by CEMs or equivalent technology. 

Credit Creation: 

Emission reduction credits ("credits") may be created in accordance with MOE "Standard Methods" from baseline project emission rates in the year prior to creation.  Specific requirements are set out in the Ontario Emissions Trading Code ("OETC").  Generally credits may be created from any of the following jurisdictions: 

Ontario, New York, Pennsylvania, New jersey, Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, Kentucky, Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia (with possible science-based extension of the eligible jurisdictions) 

In addition, US allowances which are issued by these jurisdictions may be acceptable for use as Ontario credits if they meet the requirements set out in the OETC. 

Early action credits may be eligible for use if they:  meet the requirements of the OETC; were submitted for review by the PERT program before July 1, 2001;  and were created between July 1, 1998 and January 1, 2000. 

Credits will be approved for use by the MOE before they are registered on the Emissions Trading Registry. 

Credit and Allowance Use: 

Use of credits is limited to 33% of allowances used for NOx and 10% of allowances used for SO2.  These limits do not apply if the facility is operating under an IMO must run contract.   

All credits will be subject to a 10% environmental discount.  The ratio of smog season to non-smog season NOx credits must reflect the same ratio of actual emissions. 

There is no restriction on banking of credits.  There is no distance and directionality discounting for the eligible jurisdictions. 
Trading 

There is generally unrestricted trading through the Ontario Emissions Trading Registry.

John,

Good talking with you today.  Per our discussion, please see the information below on examples of commercial activity Enron is undertaking with links to greenhouse gas emissions.  Please let me know if you would like to get in touch with any of the commercial leads on this work.  Many were on the conference call last week, like Elliot Mainzer and Stacey Bolton working on the Renewable Power Desk as well as Heather Mitchell working with EES.

GHG Prices and the Dupont Transaction

I spoke to Natsource regarding the Dupont transaction.  As expected, they could not release the price per ton, but said that they are currently accepting bids at 5 pounds per ton CO2e and offers at 8 pounds per ton CO2e.  The Dupont transaction was a forward trade of 2002 UK greenhouse gas emissions allowances.  Dupont expects to be able to reduce their emissions beyond their obligation under the program, and thus, to be able transfer surplus allowances.

Also, you may find the website below of interest, specifically their analysis on carbon prices.  Please feel free to use my log in ID - ID lisa, PW lisaj.  Given all the uncertainty, I would not rely too much on the figures.

http://www.pointcarbon.com/index.php


Sainsburys and Monetizing GHG Benefits

Other things to think about with regard to participation in the UK climate change programs -- has Sainsburys done any of the following, which would grant them allocations under the trading program:

-signed on to the climate change levy?
-undertaken or considering undertaking a voluntary greenhouse gas emissions reduction target (under the direct entry program)?

A third way to monetize the greenhouse gas benefits would be through the climate change auction -- where mitigation projects are submitted to the UK government for approval and then, once approved, be permitted to generate credits for sale under the trading program.  As I understand it, the project approval criteria has not yet been agreed to.  I have heard that timing on the rules is likely next year.

Certainly, Louis, Diana and others who are watching this closely can provide additional insights.

Understanding Sainsburys' strategy would help to identify any additional roles/opportunities for Enron.

Finally, it is important to consider any additional costs that may derive from new reporting, verification and certification requirements under the emissions trading program.  Depending on the contract, sellers of CO2e credits are often asked to pay for the reporting, etc.

Please keep me posted as your discussions progress and let me know if I may be of further assistance.

All the best,

Lisa

Snapshot of Enron Business Activity Related to Greenhouse Gas Emissions

Enron Energy Services:

?	Management's goal for this year in the U.S. and the U.K. is to include broad language in standard contracts that capture ownership of the greenhouse gas and other environmental attributes of its deals.  Key barriers are 1) EES customers cannot easily quantify, or in some cases do not understand, the potential value of environmental attribute credits.  Customers do not want to "give something away for free," and 2) EES does not want to hold up deals.  However, EES has recently closed a deal with Sainsburys (a large supermarket chain) in the U.K. and is exploring, with Sainsburys, participation in the U.K. greenhouse gas trading program in 2002.

Enron Europe:

?	EE is gearing up to participate in the U.K.'s renewable energy and greenhouse gas credit trading systems as well as the European greenhouse gas emissions trading program.  Also, EE is looking to take a long position on renewable energy credits through the development of renewable energy generating units in UK, Greece and Spain.

Enron Global Markets:

?	Coal and Emissions Desk - The emissions desk expresses general interest in greenhouse gas emissions trading, but an established market is months, if not years, away.  In the meantime, the desk seeks opportunities to gain experience with greenhouse gas transactions, but has not taken a position or been a party to a transaction yet.  

Enron Wholesale Services:

?	The Renewable Energy Power Desk has recently closed a significant deal with Andrews Air Force base and is working with other Enron businesses to build a network to transact more deals and to attract customers.  While the desk provides renewable energy credits, these credits will potentially have a larger customer base when the rules for greenhouse gas emissions trading are defined.

Enron Global Services/Enron Transportation Services:

?	ETS has participated in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Energy Star, Natural Gas Leak Repair Program.  ETS has considered capturing and possibly selling methane emissions reductions (as carbon dioxide equivalent reductions) that derive from the leak repairs of its U.S. assets.  Enron Global Services is looking into packing and selling methane reductions from similar projects in Argentina.  If successful, this could be replicable at other international pipelines.

Enron Wind:

?	Contract language exists to capture greenhouse gas credits.  To date, Enron Wind has a 60 megawatt project in Honduras that is expected to sell its greenhouse gas credits.

Portland General Electric:

?	PGE participates in EPA's 1605 (b), Greenhouse Gas Voluntary Reporting Program.  PGE reports about 1 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent reductions annually and has reported about 5 million tons for projects dating back to 1991.  Half are from demand side management programs, and half are from power plant efficiency upgrades.  The projects are granted a cumulative life of 20 years for their returns.  For the next 17 years or so, PGE will continue to report 1 million tons annually in addition to any projects or efforts that are completed during the report year.  PGE has reported since the inception of the program and seeks credit from the U.S. government for the voluntary reductions it has made and reported.  

Enron Corp.'s Activity with Regard to Emissions Issues

?	Environment, Health and Safety has completed Enron's first greenhouse gas emissions inventory, which includes most U.S. and international assets.  Based on 1999 data, Enron's emissions were 22.1 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, based on percent ownership of assets.  EHS works with Corporate Responsibility team to communicate with decision-makers and outside stakeholders as well as position Enron as a business leader on market-oriented solutions to address climate change.

1.	Enron supports binding multilateral agreement on systems to address climate change, provided they are market-based, cost-effective and include worldwide participation (understanding that developing countries may participate under a different structure and timeframe as developed countries) 
2.	Enron develops advocacy strategies consistent with its public climate change statements and with an eye to enhance Enron's risk management expertise and identify new commercial opportunities.

You may have seen recent media reports on the topics of possible EPA action=
 on New Source Review (NSR) regulation and multipollutant legislation, so I=
 wanted to summarize some of the important current developments:

New Source Review:

EPA was asked to conduct a 90-day review of NSR and come up with recommenda=
tions for the larger Bush National Energy Plan.   EPA held several public h=
earings and solicited public comments, which closed July 27.   Enron submit=
ted comments (which I sent by e-mail on 7/30/01).   EPA has indicated that =
it will report to the President only on "impacts of NSR on the power sector=
" on August 17 and delay any specific recommendations for NSR reform until =
mid-September.

Stories in the past few days have suggested that EPA's findings will "ease =
emissions standards" on coal utilities. Such characterizations are somewhat=
 slanted, as they are based on information coming from environmental groups=
 who oppose any NSR reform -- but there is some substantive merit behind th=
ese reports as well.

NSR enforcement over plant modifications has been an extremely contentious =
issue for electric utilities, and many industry sources have been lobbying =
hard to relax EPA enforcement policy.  From an administrative perspective, =
this is a relatively easy reform for  EPA to tackle -- it would only requir=
e a change in "guidance" and not a lengthy regulatory process or legislatio=
n.   As you can see from the attached stories, environmental groups are ext=
remely opposed to this type of action, and are using the media very effecti=
vely to put pressure on EPA against such loosening of NSR enforcement stand=
ards.
EPA will likely recommend a number of broader administrative and legislativ=
e changes to NSR, most requiring a longer trip through the legislative or r=
egulatory process.   Such changes could include reforms to BACT/LAER analys=
is for new or existing sources, relief for cleaner sources, or standardizat=
ion of some of the more arbitrary provisions of NSR.   Given the longer-ter=
m effort required, these proposed reforms may be newsworthy, but less likel=
y to have an impact on the power sector in the short-term.

Some of the recent complicating issues have been calls from other industry =
sectors (manufacturers,  refining, industrial boilers, gas pipelines) for N=
SR relief.  EPA would prefer to address power sector issues only, but may b=
e politically forced to make recommendations in other sectors as well.  It =
is not yet clear what sectors or what issues they will address.

Possible Outcomes/Impacts:  Large coal utilities have spent a great deal of=
 resources putting pressure on the Administration on the modification & enf=
orcement issues.  The issue is the easiest short-term solution to offer fro=
m a regulatory standpoint, so despite environmental group opposition, it is=
 likely that EPA will recommend immediate action in this area, along with l=
onger-term reforms.  For Enron businesses this means that coal, emissions a=
nd power trading should expect renewed strength in the coal generation sect=
or, as older assets would face less barriers to extending their life.  Orig=
ination opportunities (plant upgrades, capacity increases) may increase as =
customers fears about enforcement actions subside.  Industrial and gas pipe=
line sectors may see relief in the modification area as well, if EPA decide=
s to tackle sectors outside just power.  Particularly on gas pipeline issue=
s, turbine maintenance issues may be clear-cut enough for EPA to make a sim=
ple , short term recommendation.

Multipollutant Legislation

Also making news lately were statements by EPA Administrator Christine Whit=
man, indicating that EPA plans to release a proposal to scrap existing emis=
sions regulations (NOx SIP Call/126 Rule, Regional Haze, SO2/Acid Rain) for=
 a more streamlined "multipollutant" plan.  Multipollutant strategies have =
been discussed for some time, but are becoming more newsworthy lately becau=
se they were included as possible options under the Bush Energy Plan, and o=
ffer potential solutions to NSR reform problems.

EPA's proposed elimination of existing air programs is not as drastic as it=
 sounds -- in fact, it offers the opportunity to replace confusing, overlap=
ping programs on multiple pollutants that are currently regulated or will s=
oon be regulated by EPA with a more certain and flexible system.  Prospects=
 for development of a multipollutant trading plan that reforms NSR are much=
 less predictable, however, and will require a longer-term legislative effo=
rt.  =20

In September 2001, we expect to see release of EPA's plan, as well as congr=
essional consideration of several pieces of multipollutant legislation.  We=
 are working closely with EPA, the White House, and Congress on these issue=
s and will continue to keep commercial and corporate groups informed on the=
 progress of multipollutant strategies.   Unless political dynamics change =
drastically, we would not expect final action on multipollutant legislation=
 this year.  As the issue evolves, we will be in touch with more specifics =
on the legislation and Enron's strategy.

The following are the main points from a briefing that Dr. Paula Dobriansky gave to National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) members this morning. Dobriansky is the Undersecretary for Global Affairs at the Department of State, which serves as the head delegate for the United States at the climate change negotiations.

The next set of negotiations are scheduled for late October in Morocco (COP-7) and the delegates are expected to adopt texts on rules for implementation of the Kyoto Protocol, including the broad frameworks for the market-based mechanisms such as international emissions trading.  The U.S. has announced its opposition to the Protocol on grounds that it would harm economic interests and it does not include sufficient participation by developing countries.

Not much new to report, though she lowered expectations and distanced the Bush Administration from press reports after the Bonn negotiations in July that the U.S. would be developing an "alternative" to Kyoto.  She said several of the statements made by Powell and Rice were taken out of context and the term "alternative" implies to her a "grand design or strategic plan," which the U.S. is not currently developing.

She started off by affirming that the U.S. would not be coming back into the Kyoto Protocol - "plain and simple"

The U.S. is not seeking an amendment or other change that would bring it back into the Protocol

The cabinet-level review on climate change is on-going and the timing as well as the type of initiative that the Bush Administration will develop on climate change are still unknown.  She said that President Bush views climate change as a serious issue and is committed to doing something about it, but the issue is complex.  The Administration strives to offer a "balanced" approach -- no a cost-punitive approach.

The strategy for COP-7 will be similar to COP-6, the U.S. will engage in climate change convention issues and inject itself to protect U.S. interests, including non-tariff trade barriers and competitiveness issues.

Despite NAM's opposition to the Protocol, some NAM members encouraged the U.S. to re-engage on elements of the Kyoto Protocol to protect business interests, specifically on emissions trading and project-based mechanisms as well as  its inclusion of a basket of greenhouse gases.

She highlighted the importance of bilaterals and plans to meet with the Japanese Environment Minister today in Washington, focusing on partnerships on climate science among other topics, but not the Protocol.
 
The U.S. is developing an agenda for the Earth Summit in (Rio+10) to be held in South Africa next fall.  The U.S. will promote good governance, accountability and foreign investment as the main tools to achieve sustainable development.

I will attend a briefing with Dobriansky next Friday with the Business Council for Sustainable Energy -- an industry trade group for the efficiency, natural gas and renewables industries in the U.S.  The Council supports the adoption of a binding international treaty to address climate change, it will be interesting to see if her message changes for this audience.

Thanks.

Good morning everyone.  Alice LeBlanc of the Chicago Climate Exchange is still in town, as she lives in NYC and cannot get home, and will be coming by at 2:00 pm today to talk about the exchange if folks feel up to it and are free.  I will plant to talk with her regardless and hope that some of you can join us.  But we will try to re-schedule for early October if today does not work.

DETAILS:

TODAY - 9/12
2:00 pm
3AC 15 CI

Thanks.

Stacey,

Now that you are back in town, it would be very helpful to have you (and Elliot) attend this meeting if you are free. CCX is a voluntary GHG emissions trading program -- with several big company participants.  They are in the design phase now -- deciding what will qualify as a reduction, what the scope will be (mid-west initially with expansion to national) and what vol. obligations company participants will have.

TODAY - 9/11
2:30 pm
3AC15C1

I can provide more background to you if you would like - I will be up on 47 after about 10:30 am today.

Thanks,

Lisa

Hello!

Would you be free to meet briefly in Houston with reps. of the Chicago Climate Exchange on Tuesday, Sept. 11 (pm). I have met with them a few times -- key issues regarding Enron's participation are 1) lack of a voluntary target and 2) the CCX's initial mid-west focus.

However, more companies are joining and it would be interesting to see how their design phase is evolving and how they are handling the sticking issues related to the targets, among other issues.

Also, please let me know if you have others who you think might find it of value (since the vol. targets issues is not resolved, I am hesitant to invite more commercial people, as I would not want to have the CCX folks pitch them on something that we would most likely not join at this stage -- thoughts?)


Thanks,

Lisa

Trevor, 

I got your message re: Duke, Carolina P&L.  We are looking into it.  Also, please let me know if you have any questions regarding the information that Jeff and Mary gave you last week on Sec. 126.  They are free to talk.

Next Tuesday (9/11) is our next conference call.  It turns out that I will be in Houston, so let's do it in person.  9:30 am is the time and I will come to your floor.  In addition, Marc Phillips would like to attend to talk with you about an opportunity to work the pipelines in Argentina on CO2e emissions credits from methane leak repairs.

Finally, you had expressed interest in learning more about the Chicago Climate Exchange.  One of the principals will be in Houston on 9/11 and is available at 2:30 pm to brief Enron on the progress of their design phase and the value of participation in the exchange.  I have met with them a few times -- key issues regarding Enron's participation are 1) Enron's lack of a voluntary CO2 reduction target and 2) the CCX's initial mid-west focus.  

While participation in the initial design phase does not require a emissions reduction target, most companies participating have adopted one and the program is being promoted around companies taking on targets.  Despite this, I think talking with them would be of value.  I would especially like your reactions to their pitch and whether you feel that the emissions desk would find it of valuable (assuming that we could resolve the target issue).

Please confirm that the time and location still works and let me know if you have other issues you would like to cover.

Thanks,

Lisa

I met with a contact at the Department of State Global Affairs division today.  While much was up in the air given last week's events, here is some information on where things stand for now:

1) The U.N. and Morocco intend to hold the next set of climate change negotiations (COP-7) as planned in late October. Under Secretary of State for Global Affairs Paula Dobriansky is scheduled to attend, but that could change.  

2)  If the negotiations go forward, the U.S. will not seek to delay action by the other nations, but will engage to protect U.S. interests (consistent with their approach in Bonn in July);

3) Jim Connaughton, head of the White House's Counsel on Environmental Quality, has taken the staff lead on developing the Bush Administration's alternative.  While Connaughton has expressed confidence that he can put a plan together (timeline uncertain -- but aiming for COP-7), some feel that is ambitious given the political divide on this issue within the Administration, and especially given the current focus on security and a response to the terrorist attacks last week.  With regard to COP-7 timing, I would agree on both counts.

I will work with Pat and Jeff on follow-up with CEQ to get up to speed on their current thinking and offer our expertise as appropriate.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.
