Good morning. I was wondering if I could use some of the frozen veggies to make a casserole?

We are waiting on the cold front.  Very foggy this am.

By my calculation this payment is not due today.  I have advised Northwestern's attorney of this fact.

Dave Duran wants to be advised prior to this money being sent.

Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.  

Parking & Transportation Desk

Hey Mom, it's of course very quiet here as well. There is still no one
around, but I know the action will pick up soon. I have read all three of my
books now, but that means it's time to write, which is the hard part. I'm
having a really hard time with the short paper I'm trying to get done. I
wrote something last night, but it's no good!! Oh well--I think I'm going to
really try to finish that up this morning and move on to one of my longer
ones. I realized last night that I did not leave my apartment ONCE
yesterday. That is just ridiculous--I've got to get out today or I'll go
stir crazy. I tried to call y'all Friday night afer I went shopping, but
there was no answer. It just made me think fishing was good, and you guys
were out there getting keepers til late in the night! Oh by the way, I think
I may be home Thursday night. Our plane leaves for New Orleans at 11 on
Friday, which means we must be there by 9:30, and that would mean getting up
and going really early from College Station. It's not for sure yet, but I
think it would be a good idea. Do you think there's any way y'all might be
able to pick us up on Sunday? I think the flight gets in around one. Again
this isn't definite--just an idea, but Mikey said he was going to see if his
dad could drop us off on Friday to avoid parking charges. Anyway, it's time
for me to get to reading and writing. I hope the Pink House trip was a
positive one and that fishing continued to be good. See you either in four
days or just three weeks...Almost done!

Love,

Paige

PC EPHONE (OTC BB: PCPH) 
Latest price: 78 cents


Check out this awesome device at http://www.pc-ephone.com 
Comparing the 16,197,039 common shares of PC EPHONE 
outstanding as of October 31, 2001 with the market 
capitalization of a company such as PALM, this is a stock 
that really could be about to fly.

With news of carrier approval expected soon, there could be 
a huge win here. PCPH was over $6 earlier this year and 
that was well before all the recent exciting events. 


PC-EPHONE HONORED AT COMDEX FALL 2001

SAN DIEGO--Nov. 15, 2001--PC-EPhone, Inc. (OTCBB: PCPH 
Frankfurt: NL1, WKN 589864) is pleased to announce that it 
has been honored at Comdex Fall 2001 in Las Vegas by

device won the Positive Image News & Reviews Editor's 
Choice Award. The article referred to the PC-EPhone device 
as ``light years ahead of the rest'' and stated that ``PC-
EPhone has bestowed upon us a historical moment to view a 
product of such magnitude in design and innovation.'' The 
full article can be accessed at 
http://www.positiveimagenews.com/comdex/pcephone/index.html.
 

In addition, for an unprecedented second year the PC-EPhone 
device was selected a finalist for ``Best of Comdex''. This 
year the PC-EPhone device was nominated in the 
Mobile/Handheld System category along with products from 
Toshiba and Handspring. Last year the device was the 
finalist in the ``Best of Comdex'' Wireless/Mobile Product 
category. 

``We are pleased and honored to have been selected and 
nominated by leading industry experts for such 
recognition,'' said David Meltzer, CEO and President, of PC-
EPhone, Inc. ``We are proud of our development partner, 
Cyberbank Corp., and their dedication to making such fine, 
world-class wireless devices.'' 

About PC-EPhone, Inc. 

PC-EPhone, Inc., through its wholly owned subsidiary, is 
the exclusive U.S. and Canadian distributor of the PC-
EPhone device and the Company also has the right to co-
develop Cyberbank Corp.'s (the developer of the PC-EPhone

past advertised companies may have performed as well. 
Readers are cautioned that small and micro-cap stocks are 
high-risk investments and that they may lose all or a 
portion of their investment if they make a purchase in our 
advertised stocks. In order to be in full compliance with 
the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, Section 17(b), we have 
received 40,000 free trading shares of PC EPhone, Inc. from 
a third party as compensation for the distribution of this 
and other advertisements. Since we have received 
compensation and hold stock in the advertised company there 
is an inherent conflict of interest in our statements and 
opinions and such statements and opinions cannot be 
considered independent. We will benefit from any increase 
in share price of the advertised company. We will sell our 
shares at any time, without notice, be that before, during 
or immediately after the release of this advertisement. The 
liquidation of our stock may have a negative impact on the 
securities of the company liquidated, including decreased 
market value and/or dilution of the company's securities. 
Furthermore, our associates and/or employees and/or 
principals may have stock positions in advertised companies 
purchased in the open market or in private transactions. 
These positions may be liquidated, without prior 
notification, even after we have made positive comments 
regarding the advertised company. It should be understood 
that any price targets and/or projections mentioned are 
solely opinions and should not be taken as suggested 
holding periods. In fact, we will sell our positions in any 
companies advertised before they reach such target prices. 
The receipt of this information constitutes your acceptance 
of these terms and conditions. Reading this advertisement 
shall not create under any circumstances an offer to buy or 
sell stock in any company advertised. Nor shall it create 
any principal-agent relationship between the reader and us. 
The stocks of advertised companies may trade in fast 
moving, highly volatile markets, and any reader should 
observe the trading behavior of any advertised company 
prior to investing. Advertised stocks are often thinly 
traded and large sell orders will have a substantially 
negative impact on share price. Investors in advertised 
stocks may experience difficulty in selling shares without 
seeing a decline in market price and may have difficulty in 
finding ready buyers of their stock. Information within 
this advertisement contains "forward looking" statements 
within the meaning of Section 27(a) of the U.S. Securities 
Act of 1933 and Section 21(e) of the U.S. Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934. Any statements that express or 
involve discussions with respect to predictions, 
expectations, beliefs, plans, projections, objectives, 
goals, assumptions or future events or performance are not 
statements of historical facts and may be forward looking 
statements. Forward looking statements are based on 
expectations, estimates and projections at the time the 
statements are made that involve a number of risks and 
uncertainties which could cause actual results or events to 
differ materially from those presently anticipated. Forward 
looking statements may be identified through the use of 
words such as expects, will, anticipates, estimates, 
believes, or by statements indicating certain actions may, 
could or might occur. We encourage our readers to invest 
carefully and read the investor information available at 
the web sites of the U.S. Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC) at http://www.sec.gov and the National 
Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) at 
http://www.nasd.com. We also strongly recommend that you 
read the SEC advisory to investors concerning Internet 
Stock Fraud, which can be found at 
http://www.sec.gov/consumer/cyberfr.htm. The NASD has 
published information on how to invest carefully at its web 
site. Readers can review all public filings by companies at 
the SEC s EDGAR page. All information within this 
advertisement is qualified in its entirety by the detailed 
information and financial statements of the advertised 
company contained in its regulatory filings with the SEC.

Jordan is taking Christina Mordant's last job, Corp Development.  Dan is convinced that he (Dan) will be laid off, and I'm worn out trying to talk him out of the feeling. Is Carol going back to Swaps?

I'm taking Wednesday off.  It will be very quiet all week. I may take the opportunity to run some errands.

See you later,

Kay

She is taking over Global Finance Legal. I heard Peter and Travis will be working with her.  I asked what Dan will be doing, but the person I talked to didn't know.  I think this just happened Friday. I don't know what I will be doing.  I suspect someone will be doing the power stuff.  I do wish I knew.  

I am afraid Dan would worry if he knew about Julia unless she has left him a message. If I hear anything I will let you know. 

Did you hear Alice quit? Couldn't risk the uncertainty.

I'm looking forward to the long weekend!

Kay,

I talked to Reagan regarding the potential Dynegy transaction.  I am preparing a CA as follows?

Parties:  EPMI and Dynegy, Inc.
Bilateral
Purpose:  Discussions regarding one or more potential transactions involving EPMI and Dynegy regarding energy capacity and ancillary services.

For the time being, Reagan has decided not to limit these discussions to the Entergy control area, but rather leave it wide open.

Kathleen

Boeing Sets 2,900 New Job Cuts 
Monday November 26, 1:36 PM EST 


SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing Co (BA). on Monday announced2,900 job cuts, boosting its total since the Sept. 11 hijackattacks to 14,900 or nearly half the 30,000 jobs it has said itcould cut by the end of 2002.

The 2,900 employees getting 60-day layoff notices on Mondayincluded 2,100 in Boeing's beleaguered commercial jet unit,where orders have shriveled as airlines park aircraft and cutdeliveries of new jets to match shrinking air travel demand,spokesman Tom Ryan told Reuters.

Chicago-based Boeing said the latest cuts also include 700workers in its shared services group and another 100 mostlyfrom its embryonic Connexion airborne Internet service and itsJoint Strike Fighter program, which lost a massive Pentagonaward to rival Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT). last month.

The latest 2,900 cuts include 1,900 jobs in the Seattlearea, Ryan said.

Boeing in October announced 12,000 job cuts, which takeeffect on Dec. 14, and said it would ultimately cut a total of20,000 to 30,000 workers. The first round included 11,400commercial airplane workers and 600 from shared services.

Boeing also redeployed 200 of 600 Connexion workers in lateSeptember as airlines backed away from the service and Boeingfocused on flight safety and security applications for thesatellite-based communications network.

The aerospace giant has slashed projected deliveries fromits world-leading commercial jet unit to 350 to 400 in 2002from an expected 522 this year. In 2003 the forecast falls evenlower and some industry analysts believe the totals will falleven lower.

Earlier this month Boeing Chairman Phil Condit predictedthe current travel slump would cost the manufacturer about1,000 jet deliveries over the next several years.

Depending on size, Boeing jetliners sell for roughly $30million to nearly $200 million each. The company has said itneeds to shed workers to meet its stated goal of remainingprofitable despite the lost orders.

Several airlines have already failed and others are said tobe teetering near bankruptcy in the wake of the hijackings,which boosted airlines' operating costs and left many of theirplanes half-empty.

At the end of October, Boeing employed a total of 196,500workers and 91,600 in its Seattle-based commercial jet unit.

The company expects to send out its next batch of 60-daylayoff notices on Dec. 21, Ryan said.

It looks like I'm the only one here today, except for Carol, and she's only here until 11am.  I'm off Friday and Monday, so have a happy New Year's.  How was your Christmas?  Kristine's sister was killed Sunday!  Needless to say, that is very upsetting, and she and Emma are up in Nebraska.  Her 2 little girls are in critical condition in the hospital while the family is a mess.  That girl was 35 years old!  It's so sad, and I just feel helpless that I can't do anything for Kristine!  
 
New York was great!

This is from Bloomberg and sadly is the best source of available information on our status.  The troubling news is the "death spiral" quote again and the statement that we only have about $2 billion in cash which raises the downgrade issue and also perhaps means that we don't want to announce lay-offs since we can't afford to make any payouts. 


Enron's Stock, Bonds Drop on Concern for Dynegy Bid (Update3)
By Jennifer Ryan 
New York, Nov. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s bond and stock prices declined amid concern Dynegy Inc.'s proposed $23 billion acquisition of the biggest energy trader may fall through. 
``It's a death spiral,'' said Edward Jones & Co. analyst Brian Youngberg, who rates Enron ``sell'' and doesn't own the company's shares. ``With the declining share price and debt disclosures, the chance of the deal going through has fallen from about 90 percent to less than 50 percent.'' 
Shares of Enron, the third most-active U.S. stock, tumbled as much as 15 percent, dropping for the fourth day in a row. Investors lowered their asking price for the 6.4 percent notes that mature in 2006 to 58 cents on the dollar from 60 cents Friday. Bids to buy bonds were unchanged at 55 cents on the dollar, traders said. The bonds yield 22.55 percent. 
Concern that Dynegy may change or cancel its bid for Enron had pushed Enron's stock down 48 percent in the past three days. Enron's shares had plummeted 86 percent since mid-October after the company reported a $618 million third-quarter loss and said expansion into water, telecommunications and retail-energy sales cost it $1.01 billion. 
Part of the third-quarter charge was connected with limited partnerships run by the chief financial officer. He was ousted, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission started an investigation into Enron's accounting. The company earlier this month restated its earnings for the past four years. 
Talks on $1 Billion 
Enron said late last week talks are continuing with potential investors for as much as $1 billion. The company agreed to be bought by Dynegy on Nov. 9 for stock and assumed debt, halting a financial crisis that threatened to bankrupt Enron and throw U.S. power and natural-gas markets into turmoil. 
Shares of Enron fell 54 cents, or 11 percent, to $4.17 in late-morning trading. Earlier, they touched $4.02. Dynegy fell $1.03 to $39.37. The stock had fallen 28 percent this year. Both companies are based in Houston. 
Egan-Jones Ratings Co. lowered its rating on Enron's credit today to ``BB-'' from ``BB.'' ``Dynegy needs to show its support, or Enron will slide,'' the firm said in a report. 
``Time is not Enron's friend,'' said Stewart Morel, co-head of investment grade debt research at UBS Warburg LLC. ``There is increased concern in the market that there may be more problems that are yet to be disclosed.'' 
On Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve from lenders on a $690 million note due this week, giving the company more time to restructure its finances. Dynegy Chief Executive Officer Chuck Watson said he was ``encouraged'' by the commitment to extend the note payment, as well as the closing of a $450 million credit facility, and that Dynegy remained committed to the merger. 
$690 Million Note 
Terms of the $690 million note were outlined for the first time in an Enron filing with the SEC a week ago. Enron also said that it has less than $2 billion in cash and credit lines left. If the company's cash reserves run too low, Enron's credit rating may be cut below investment grade. That would trigger $3.9 billion in debt repayments for two affiliated partnerships. 
Enron's bankers met with leveraged buyout firms and two industrial companies to seek an investment, the New York Times reported last week. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. agreed to terms that give each of them a $250 million equity stake as part of a transaction to be completed today.

It was good meeting with you at your offices last week.  Attached is a draft proposal highlighting the new structure we had agreed upon during our discussions.  Please review the proposal and comment as necessary, as agreeing upon a common premise will help us move forward more efficiently.  We will be meeting again later this week to discuss the various options that are available, and would appreciate your feedback with respect to specific structures, definitions, etc. you may have in mind (and that we may not have captured here).

Feel free to call either Heather or myself with questions or ideas at anytime.

THIRD CIRCUIT TASK FORCE URGES ONLY LIMITED USE OF AUCTIONS
TO PICK CLASS COUNSEL; JUDGES CRITICAL OF REPORT'S
NEGATIVITY

Judicially controlled auctions for the selection of counsel
in class actions should be used only in "certain limited
circumstances," according to a draft report issued by the
Third Circuit Task Force on Selection of Class Counsel. An
auction might be appropriate for a case in which the
defendant's liability appears clear, damages appear to be
both very large and collectible, and the lead plaintiff is
not a sophisticated litigant that has already retained
counsel of its choice through a reasonable, arm's-length
process, the task force suggests.

Several judges criticize the report as being too hostile
toward the innovative idea of competitive bidding for
selecting class counsel. The judges, participating in a
panel discussion at the 2001 Third Circuit Judicial
Conference, say the report is "too restrictive." For
instance, the task force should encourage more
experimentation with the process of setting fees at the
outset of litigation rather than waiting until the end, one
judge suggests. But others, who agree with the tenor of the
report, say bidding is overrated as a means of keeping
counsel fees reasonable. . . . Page s 2326,  . . . Page 2318

NEW YORK BAR PROPOSES AMENDING ABA MODEL RULES TO ALLOW
CAREFULLY REGULATED MULTIDISCIPLINARY ALLIANCES

The New York State Bar Association files a proposal with the
American Bar Association recommending amendment of the Model
Rules of Professional Conduct to allow limited and carefully
regulated "contractual relationships" and other affiliations
between lawyers and nonlawyers who want to offer their
clients integrated multidisciplinary services.

Foremost among the safeguards being advocated by the New
York bar are measures that would prohibit nonlawyers from
holding any ownership or managerial interest in law firms;
sharing legal fees with lawyers; directing or regulating the
professional judgment of lawyers; or compromising in any
other way a lawyer's duty to safeguard client interests. The
proposal is patterned on recent amendments to the New York
Code of Professional Responsibility allowing such
affiliations. . . . Page 2315

INS ADOPTS INTERIM PROCEDURES FOR ADJUDICATING CASES OF
UNREMOVABLE ALIENS SEEKING RELEASE FROM DETENTION

The Immigration and Naturalization Service issues an interim
rule governing detention of aliens who are subject to final
orders of removal but cannot likely be removed in the
foreseeable future because no country will accept them. The
rule responds to the U.S. Supreme Court's recent "Zadvydas"
decision, which held that, absent special circumstances, the
attorney general lacks authority to detain such aliens
indefinitely.

The rule specifies procedures for aliens who have been
detained beyond the statutory 90-day removal period to
demonstrate that their removal is unlikely in the reasonably
foreseeable future. Aliens seeking relief must make a
threshold showing that they have cooperated with the INS's
efforts to effect their removal. Aliens who prevail on such
claims must be released, subject to conditions of
supervision, unless "special circumstances" would render
release dangerous. . . . Page 2321

Boeing Sets 2,900 New Job Cuts 
Monday November 26, 1:36 PM EST 


SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing Co (BA). on Monday announced2,900 job cuts, boosting its total since the Sept. 11 hijackattacks to 14,900 or nearly half the 30,000 jobs it has said itcould cut by the end of 2002.

The 2,900 employees getting 60-day layoff notices on Mondayincluded 2,100 in Boeing's beleaguered commercial jet unit,where orders have shriveled as airlines park aircraft and cutdeliveries of new jets to match shrinking air travel demand,spokesman Tom Ryan told Reuters.

Chicago-based Boeing said the latest cuts also include 700workers in its shared services group and another 100 mostlyfrom its embryonic Connexion airborne Internet service and itsJoint Strike Fighter program, which lost a massive Pentagonaward to rival Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT). last month.

The latest 2,900 cuts include 1,900 jobs in the Seattlearea, Ryan said.

Boeing in October announced 12,000 job cuts, which takeeffect on Dec. 14, and said it would ultimately cut a total of20,000 to 30,000 workers. The first round included 11,400commercial airplane workers and 600 from shared services.

Boeing also redeployed 200 of 600 Connexion workers in lateSeptember as airlines backed away from the service and Boeingfocused on flight safety and security applications for thesatellite-based communications network.

The aerospace giant has slashed projected deliveries fromits world-leading commercial jet unit to 350 to 400 in 2002from an expected 522 this year. In 2003 the forecast falls evenlower and some industry analysts believe the totals will falleven lower.

Earlier this month Boeing Chairman Phil Condit predictedthe current travel slump would cost the manufacturer about1,000 jet deliveries over the next several years.

Depending on size, Boeing jetliners sell for roughly $30million to nearly $200 million each. The company has said itneeds to shed workers to meet its stated goal of remainingprofitable despite the lost orders.

Several airlines have already failed and others are said tobe teetering near bankruptcy in the wake of the hijackings,which boosted airlines' operating costs and left many of theirplanes half-empty.

At the end of October, Boeing employed a total of 196,500workers and 91,600 in its Seattle-based commercial jet unit.

The company expects to send out its next batch of 60-daylayoff notices on Dec. 21, Ryan said.

Readers are cautioned that small and micro-cap stocks are

the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, Section 17(b), we have 
received 25,000 free trading shares of Travelshorts.com 
Inc. from a third party as compensation for the 
distribution of this and other advertisements. Since we 
have received compensation and hold stock in the advertised 
company there is an inherent conflict of interest in our 
statements and opinions and such statements and opinions 
cannot be considered independent. We will benefit from any 
increase in share price of the advertised company. We will 
sell our shares at any time, without notice, be that 
before, during or immediately after the release of this 
advertisement. The liquidation of our stock may have a 
negative impact on the securities of the company 
liquidated, including decreased market value and/or 
dilution of the company's securities. Furthermore, our 
associates and/or employees and/or principals may have 
stock positions in advertised companies purchased in the 
open market or in private transactions. These positions may 
be liquidated, without prior notification, even after we 
have made positive comments regarding the advertised 
company. It should be understood that any price targets 
and/or projections mentioned are solely opinions and should 
not be taken as suggested holding periods. In fact, we will 
sell our positions in any companies advertised before they 
reach such target prices. The receipt of this information 
constitutes your acceptance of these terms and conditions. 
Reading this advertisement shall not create under any 
circumstances an offer to buy or sell stock in any company 
advertised. Nor shall it create any principal-agent 
relationship between the reader and us. The stocks of 
advertised companies may trade in fast moving, highly 
volatile markets, and any reader should observe the trading 
behavior of any advertised company prior to investing. 
Advertised stocks are often thinly traded and large sell 
orders will have a substantially negative impact on share 
price. Investors in advertised stocks may experience 
difficulty in selling shares without seeing a decline in 
market price and may have difficulty in finding ready 
buyers of their stock. Information within this 
advertisement contains "forward looking" statements within 
the meaning of Section 27(a) of the U.S. Securities Act of 
1933 and Section 21(e) of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act 
of 1934. Any statements that express or involve discussions 
with respect to predictions, expectations, beliefs, plans, 
projections, objectives, goals, assumptions or future 
events or performance are not statements of historical 
facts and may be forward looking statements. Forward 
looking statements are based on expectations, estimates and 
projections at the time the statements are made that 
involve a number of risks and uncertainties which could 
cause actual results or events to differ materially from 
those presently anticipated. Forward looking statements may 
be identified through the use of words such as expects, 
will, anticipates, estimates, believes, or by statements 
indicating certain actions may, could or might occur. We 
encourage our readers to invest carefully and read the 
investor information available at the web sites of the U.S. 
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) at 
http://www.sec.gov and the National Association of 
Securities Dealers (NASD) at http://www.nasd.com. We also 
strongly recommend that you read the SEC advisory to 
investors concerning Internet Stock Fraud, which can be 
found at http://www.sec.gov/consumer/cyberfr.htm. The NASD 
has published information on how to invest carefully at its 
web site. Readers can review all public filings by 
companies at the SEC s EDGAR page. All information within 
this advertisement is qualified in its entirety by the 
detailed information and financial statements of the 
advertised company contained in its regulatory filings with 
the SEC.

Ron,

After spending sometime this evening going through the detailed Letter Agre=
ement dated April 26th which was attached at the bottom of your note today,=
 I concluded that this was most likely the final Definitive Agreement that =
was used to close the sale.  I have a call into to Kay to confirm this and =
 talk with her tomorrow).  It is more detailed than what I believe you woul=
d want to include in the first LOI to Allegheny outlining the deal.  (Note =
the  NEPCO letter you sent later is in the latter format and envisions that=
 a detailed agreement would be negotiated and entered into between the part=
ies (ie EPC Contract). (Nepco's letter to be modified to exclude the turbin=
e purchase from the procurement scope.) =20

After working with the detailed April 26th letter and seeing that it was qu=
ite complex for the current stage of discussions, I decided to look into Ka=
ys' Blue Dog data base. There I found a letter dated March 26 (also referre=
d to in the final April 26th Letter Agreement as the Initial Letter Agreeme=
nt).   This letter I believe was the LOI originally sent out to outline the=
 deal and ultimately led to the April 26th Definitive Agreement.   A copy i=
s attached below for your review.  If this is the concept of the type of pr=
oposal you want to send out in conjunction with the NEPCO proposal which we=
 could incentivize by the pricing concept that you referred to in your note=
 to Ben this evening, then please review this version in the morning rather=
 than the April 26th letter.  If it is consistent in concept, format and ap=
proach then I will use this letter as the basis to detail your project deal=
 and include the input I expect to receive tomorrow from Rose Engeldorf on =
the financial structuring of the parties for whom ENA would be acting as ag=
ent to sale the turbines.  Let me know if you agree with this approach.  I =
believe it will facilitate finalizing a draft that everyone would be happy =
with by Thursday.

>From a practical concept ENA and Nepco, like we discussed, would should sub=
mit separate but cross referenced proposal letters concurrently (ENA for th=
e turbine sale and Nepco for the  EPC proposal minus the turbines.   The in=
centivized pricing mechanism mentioned in your note to Ben thus could be ad=
dressed  via a cross reference in the respective letters should that be the=
 commercial decision made.

Randy, please call me or Ron about the attached. teh goal will be to turn d=

Kay -  word is you worked the Northwestern deal. Ron wants to borrow from t=
he Northwestern deal as this sale wil need to be done as a sale of the enti=
ty, not just the contract. Apparently, there is more of a  customs issue in=

Yes, they slipped on some ice and ran off the road.  They weren't hurt and got out of the car and then another car came along and hit some ice and slammed into them (the driver is critical too).  It's just horrible.

I just received a call from a legal head hunter and instead of giving her names, I told her that I would forward around some information about the job and ask that any interested party call her.  I didn't really know who to send this to (you were the first three people that I thought of who would be a good fit) and encourage you to forward this to anyone else who might be interested.  I don't know if anyone is looking (and don't really care).  I am just trying to be friendly and forward the opportunity in case you might have an interest.

The recruiter's name is Barbara Gelber and her phone number is 305-466-4670.

The opportunity is for a lawyer with power plant development and finance experience.  It is an in-house opportunity and you would have to move from Houston (the location (which Barbara would not disclose) is someplace sunny).

Feel free to call, if you are interested.

Stuart

I have asked for something from GE indicating that Jeff D. had the authority to sign the consent.  I would think that this shouldn't take very long.

Jerry DeBerry called, and asked that Chris call Liz Evans to get a handle on the correct number for the wire transfer.  Once it is agreed, please send me an email with the revised number.

We were working off of different receipt dates.  I received the fax on Monday, and they believe it was delivered here the Friday before.  That is the reason for the different expectation on the closing date.

Dave Duran would like to be advised before the transfer is made.  I presume that Chris or Ben will take care of talking to Dave so that the transfer can be made tomorrow.

Thanks,

Kay

This is from Bloomberg and sadly is the best source of available information on our status.  The troubling news is the "death spiral" quote again and the statement that we only have about $2 billion in cash which raises the downgrade issue and also perhaps means that we don't want to announce lay-offs since we can't afford to make any payouts. 


Enron's Stock, Bonds Drop on Concern for Dynegy Bid (Update3)
By Jennifer Ryan 
New York, Nov. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s bond and stock prices declined amid concern Dynegy Inc.'s proposed $23 billion acquisition of the biggest energy trader may fall through. 
``It's a death spiral,'' said Edward Jones & Co. analyst Brian Youngberg, who rates Enron ``sell'' and doesn't own the company's shares. ``With the declining share price and debt disclosures, the chance of the deal going through has fallen from about 90 percent to less than 50 percent.'' 
Shares of Enron, the third most-active U.S. stock, tumbled as much as 15 percent, dropping for the fourth day in a row. Investors lowered their asking price for the 6.4 percent notes that mature in 2006 to 58 cents on the dollar from 60 cents Friday. Bids to buy bonds were unchanged at 55 cents on the dollar, traders said. The bonds yield 22.55 percent. 
Concern that Dynegy may change or cancel its bid for Enron had pushed Enron's stock down 48 percent in the past three days. Enron's shares had plummeted 86 percent since mid-October after the company reported a $618 million third-quarter loss and said expansion into water, telecommunications and retail-energy sales cost it $1.01 billion. 
Part of the third-quarter charge was connected with limited partnerships run by the chief financial officer. He was ousted, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission started an investigation into Enron's accounting. The company earlier this month restated its earnings for the past four years. 
Talks on $1 Billion 
Enron said late last week talks are continuing with potential investors for as much as $1 billion. The company agreed to be bought by Dynegy on Nov. 9 for stock and assumed debt, halting a financial crisis that threatened to bankrupt Enron and throw U.S. power and natural-gas markets into turmoil. 
Shares of Enron fell 54 cents, or 11 percent, to $4.17 in late-morning trading. Earlier, they touched $4.02. Dynegy fell $1.03 to $39.37. The stock had fallen 28 percent this year. Both companies are based in Houston. 
Egan-Jones Ratings Co. lowered its rating on Enron's credit today to ``BB-'' from ``BB.'' ``Dynegy needs to show its support, or Enron will slide,'' the firm said in a report. 
``Time is not Enron's friend,'' said Stewart Morel, co-head of investment grade debt research at UBS Warburg LLC. ``There is increased concern in the market that there may be more problems that are yet to be disclosed.'' 
On Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve from lenders on a $690 million note due this week, giving the company more time to restructure its finances. Dynegy Chief Executive Officer Chuck Watson said he was ``encouraged'' by the commitment to extend the note payment, as well as the closing of a $450 million credit facility, and that Dynegy remained committed to the merger. 
$690 Million Note 
Terms of the $690 million note were outlined for the first time in an Enron filing with the SEC a week ago. Enron also said that it has less than $2 billion in cash and credit lines left. If the company's cash reserves run too low, Enron's credit rating may be cut below investment grade. That would trigger $3.9 billion in debt repayments for two affiliated partnerships. 
Enron's bankers met with leveraged buyout firms and two industrial companies to seek an investment, the New York Times reported last week. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. agreed to terms that give each of them a $250 million equity stake as part of a transaction to be completed today.

Boeing Sets 2,900 New Job Cuts 
Monday November 26, 1:36 PM EST 


SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing Co (BA). on Monday announced2,900 job cuts, boosting its total since the Sept. 11 hijackattacks to 14,900 or nearly half the 30,000 jobs it has said itcould cut by the end of 2002.

The 2,900 employees getting 60-day layoff notices on Mondayincluded 2,100 in Boeing's beleaguered commercial jet unit,where orders have shriveled as airlines park aircraft and cutdeliveries of new jets to match shrinking air travel demand,spokesman Tom Ryan told Reuters.

Chicago-based Boeing said the latest cuts also include 700workers in its shared services group and another 100 mostlyfrom its embryonic Connexion airborne Internet service and itsJoint Strike Fighter program, which lost a massive Pentagonaward to rival Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT). last month.

The latest 2,900 cuts include 1,900 jobs in the Seattlearea, Ryan said.

Boeing in October announced 12,000 job cuts, which takeeffect on Dec. 14, and said it would ultimately cut a total of20,000 to 30,000 workers. The first round included 11,400commercial airplane workers and 600 from shared services.

Boeing also redeployed 200 of 600 Connexion workers in lateSeptember as airlines backed away from the service and Boeingfocused on flight safety and security applications for thesatellite-based communications network.

The aerospace giant has slashed projected deliveries fromits world-leading commercial jet unit to 350 to 400 in 2002from an expected 522 this year. In 2003 the forecast falls evenlower and some industry analysts believe the totals will falleven lower.

Earlier this month Boeing Chairman Phil Condit predictedthe current travel slump would cost the manufacturer about1,000 jet deliveries over the next several years.

Depending on size, Boeing jetliners sell for roughly $30million to nearly $200 million each. The company has said itneeds to shed workers to meet its stated goal of remainingprofitable despite the lost orders.

Several airlines have already failed and others are said tobe teetering near bankruptcy in the wake of the hijackings,which boosted airlines' operating costs and left many of theirplanes half-empty.

At the end of October, Boeing employed a total of 196,500workers and 91,600 in its Seattle-based commercial jet unit.

The company expects to send out its next batch of 60-daylayoff notices on Dec. 21, Ryan said.

Enron's Stock, Bonds Drop on Concern for Dynegy Bid (Update3)
By Jennifer Ryan 
New York, Nov. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s bond and stock prices declined amid concern Dynegy Inc.'s proposed $23 billion acquisition of the biggest energy trader may fall through. 
``It's a death spiral,'' said Edward Jones & Co. analyst Brian Youngberg, who rates Enron ``sell'' and doesn't own the company's shares. ``With the declining share price and debt disclosures, the chance of the deal going through has fallen from about 90 percent to less than 50 percent.'' 
Shares of Enron, the third most-active U.S. stock, tumbled as much as 15 percent, dropping for the fourth day in a row. Investors lowered their asking price for the 6.4 percent notes that mature in 2006 to 58 cents on the dollar from 60 cents Friday. Bids to buy bonds were unchanged at 55 cents on the dollar, traders said. The bonds yield 22.55 percent. 
Concern that Dynegy may change or cancel its bid for Enron had pushed Enron's stock down 48 percent in the past three days. Enron's shares had plummeted 86 percent since mid-October after the company reported a $618 million third-quarter loss and said expansion into water, telecommunications and retail-energy sales cost it $1.01 billion. 
Part of the third-quarter charge was connected with limited partnerships run by the chief financial officer. He was ousted, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission started an investigation into Enron's accounting. The company earlier this month restated its earnings for the past four years. 
Talks on $1 Billion 
Enron said late last week talks are continuing with potential investors for as much as $1 billion. The company agreed to be bought by Dynegy on Nov. 9 for stock and assumed debt, halting a financial crisis that threatened to bankrupt Enron and throw U.S. power and natural-gas markets into turmoil. 
Shares of Enron fell 54 cents, or 11 percent, to $4.17 in late-morning trading. Earlier, they touched $4.02. Dynegy fell $1.03 to $39.37. The stock had fallen 28 percent this year. Both companies are based in Houston. 
Egan-Jones Ratings Co. lowered its rating on Enron's credit today to ``BB-'' from ``BB.'' ``Dynegy needs to show its support, or Enron will slide,'' the firm said in a report. 
``Time is not Enron's friend,'' said Stewart Morel, co-head of investment grade debt research at UBS Warburg LLC. ``There is increased concern in the market that there may be more problems that are yet to be disclosed.'' 
On Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve from lenders on a $690 million note due this week, giving the company more time to restructure its finances. Dynegy Chief Executive Officer Chuck Watson said he was ``encouraged'' by the commitment to extend the note payment, as well as the closing of a $450 million credit facility, and that Dynegy remained committed to the merger. 
$690 Million Note 
Terms of the $690 million note were outlined for the first time in an Enron filing with the SEC a week ago. Enron also said that it has less than $2 billion in cash and credit lines left. If the company's cash reserves run too low, Enron's credit rating may be cut below investment grade. That would trigger $3.9 billion in debt repayments for two affiliated partnerships. 
Enron's bankers met with leveraged buyout firms and two industrial companies to seek an investment, the New York Times reported last week. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. agreed to terms that give each of them a $250 million equity stake as part of a transaction to be completed today.

Boeing Sets 2,900 New Job Cuts 
Monday November 26, 1:36 PM EST 


SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing Co (BA). on Monday announced2,900 job cuts, boosting its total since the Sept. 11 hijackattacks to 14,900 or nearly half the 30,000 jobs it has said itcould cut by the end of 2002.

The 2,900 employees getting 60-day layoff notices on Mondayincluded 2,100 in Boeing's beleaguered commercial jet unit,where orders have shriveled as airlines park aircraft and cutdeliveries of new jets to match shrinking air travel demand,spokesman Tom Ryan told Reuters.

Chicago-based Boeing said the latest cuts also include 700workers in its shared services group and another 100 mostlyfrom its embryonic Connexion airborne Internet service and itsJoint Strike Fighter program, which lost a massive Pentagonaward to rival Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT). last month.

The latest 2,900 cuts include 1,900 jobs in the Seattlearea, Ryan said.

Boeing in October announced 12,000 job cuts, which takeeffect on Dec. 14, and said it would ultimately cut a total of20,000 to 30,000 workers. The first round included 11,400commercial airplane workers and 600 from shared services.

Boeing also redeployed 200 of 600 Connexion workers in lateSeptember as airlines backed away from the service and Boeingfocused on flight safety and security applications for thesatellite-based communications network.

The aerospace giant has slashed projected deliveries fromits world-leading commercial jet unit to 350 to 400 in 2002from an expected 522 this year. In 2003 the forecast falls evenlower and some industry analysts believe the totals will falleven lower.

Earlier this month Boeing Chairman Phil Condit predictedthe current travel slump would cost the manufacturer about1,000 jet deliveries over the next several years.

Depending on size, Boeing jetliners sell for roughly $30million to nearly $200 million each. The company has said itneeds to shed workers to meet its stated goal of remainingprofitable despite the lost orders.

Several airlines have already failed and others are said tobe teetering near bankruptcy in the wake of the hijackings,which boosted airlines' operating costs and left many of theirplanes half-empty.

At the end of October, Boeing employed a total of 196,500workers and 91,600 in its Seattle-based commercial jet unit.

The company expects to send out its next batch of 60-daylayoff notices on Dec. 21, Ryan said.

This is from Bloomberg and sadly is the best source of available information on our status.  The troubling news is the "death spiral" quote again and the statement that we only have about $2 billion in cash which raises the downgrade issue and also perhaps means that we don't want to announce lay-offs since we can't afford to make any payouts. 


Enron's Stock, Bonds Drop on Concern for Dynegy Bid (Update3)
By Jennifer Ryan 
New York, Nov. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s bond and stock prices declined amid concern Dynegy Inc.'s proposed $23 billion acquisition of the biggest energy trader may fall through. 
``It's a death spiral,'' said Edward Jones & Co. analyst Brian Youngberg, who rates Enron ``sell'' and doesn't own the company's shares. ``With the declining share price and debt disclosures, the chance of the deal going through has fallen from about 90 percent to less than 50 percent.'' 
Shares of Enron, the third most-active U.S. stock, tumbled as much as 15 percent, dropping for the fourth day in a row. Investors lowered their asking price for the 6.4 percent notes that mature in 2006 to 58 cents on the dollar from 60 cents Friday. Bids to buy bonds were unchanged at 55 cents on the dollar, traders said. The bonds yield 22.55 percent. 
Concern that Dynegy may change or cancel its bid for Enron had pushed Enron's stock down 48 percent in the past three days. Enron's shares had plummeted 86 percent since mid-October after the company reported a $618 million third-quarter loss and said expansion into water, telecommunications and retail-energy sales cost it $1.01 billion. 
Part of the third-quarter charge was connected with limited partnerships run by the chief financial officer. He was ousted, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission started an investigation into Enron's accounting. The company earlier this month restated its earnings for the past four years. 
Talks on $1 Billion 
Enron said late last week talks are continuing with potential investors for as much as $1 billion. The company agreed to be bought by Dynegy on Nov. 9 for stock and assumed debt, halting a financial crisis that threatened to bankrupt Enron and throw U.S. power and natural-gas markets into turmoil. 
Shares of Enron fell 54 cents, or 11 percent, to $4.17 in late-morning trading. Earlier, they touched $4.02. Dynegy fell $1.03 to $39.37. The stock had fallen 28 percent this year. Both companies are based in Houston. 
Egan-Jones Ratings Co. lowered its rating on Enron's credit today to ``BB-'' from ``BB.'' ``Dynegy needs to show its support, or Enron will slide,'' the firm said in a report. 
``Time is not Enron's friend,'' said Stewart Morel, co-head of investment grade debt research at UBS Warburg LLC. ``There is increased concern in the market that there may be more problems that are yet to be disclosed.'' 
On Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve from lenders on a $690 million note due this week, giving the company more time to restructure its finances. Dynegy Chief Executive Officer Chuck Watson said he was ``encouraged'' by the commitment to extend the note payment, as well as the closing of a $450 million credit facility, and that Dynegy remained committed to the merger. 
$690 Million Note 
Terms of the $690 million note were outlined for the first time in an Enron filing with the SEC a week ago. Enron also said that it has less than $2 billion in cash and credit lines left. If the company's cash reserves run too low, Enron's credit rating may be cut below investment grade. That would trigger $3.9 billion in debt repayments for two affiliated partnerships. 
Enron's bankers met with leveraged buyout firms and two industrial companies to seek an investment, the New York Times reported last week. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. agreed to terms that give each of them a $250 million equity stake as part of a transaction to be completed today.

We have lots of paper stuff. We are a little light on disposable cups. We have lots of forks, etc (went to Sam's).  

Maybe traffic will be light on Thursday. 

The meteor shower was incredible last night. Kind like silent fireworks. Even Michael was impressed.

Love to all,

Nice of them to ask.  I don't know when my mom is leaving Palacios.  I need to ask her.  I'm going to guess Saturday or Monday, but I don't know if she's thought about having to shut the house down by herself.

Hey! Sorry I missed your call. I was at the mall with the girls. (I
really
don't like to shop)  Bobby mentioned that Beverly's house will be
available
over Thanksgiving. It'll be good to have the extra elbow room. Odds are
that
Bobby and I may still stay at the bed and breakfast, just because I like
it
so much. I feel so spoiled when I stay there.

It looks like we are just barely going to be able to be in Palacios.
Bobby
is working Wednesday, so I think we are going to come in on Thursday. I
grimace at the thought of spending twice as much time just getting out
of
Austin. I think we'll get up and leave early on Thursday and try to get
there by late morning. Then of course we need to come back on Friday to
Bobby get ready to "hop the pond".

What do we need to bring as far as plates, plastic silver ware and all
that
good stuff??? Of course we'll bring cokes and beer and stuff like that,
but
what else is needed?

We'll also bring some smoked turkey and dressing for Thursday too. We
can
have a smorgasbord for our meal. And since we have access to Beverly's
house, I can warm stuff up over there, so as not to get in anyone's way.

I'm looking forward to seeing yall again. We are sorry we can't be there
longer, but we're glad to get to be there some.

Let me know what else I need to bring....

Hope you've had a good weekend!

Love,
Lisa

Kay,
We are generally around.  I spoke with Kerri last night and she suggested
there might be a call around 12:30 CST, 1:30 EST today.  I am available for
an hour beginning at that time and then again after the conclusion of my
2:30 EST meeting.  The problem is that I don't know how long the latter
meeting is going to take.  I know Kerri had planned to be generally
available beginning at 1:30 EST, as well, but I am not sure exactly how her
schedule looks.  I am sure we can put something together, though.
Ryan

chris,

All I need is for you to prepare a one sentence description of the set off deal.  I don't think we need to make a big deal of this.

I met with Dave Duran yesterday to get his signature.  He was not aware of what was going on, and he wants to be advised before the money is paid.

I don't want to send in these invoices you gave me today until I find out if they are in either of the inboxes.  I'd hate to duplicate payments.

Hey! Sorry I missed your call. I was at the mall with the girls. (I
really
don't like to shop)  Bobby mentioned that Beverly's house will be
available
over Thanksgiving. It'll be good to have the extra elbow room. Odds are
that
Bobby and I may still stay at the bed and breakfast, just because I like
it
so much. I feel so spoiled when I stay there.

It looks like we are just barely going to be able to be in Palacios.
Bobby
is working Wednesday, so I think we are going to come in on Thursday. I
grimace at the thought of spending twice as much time just getting out
of
Austin. I think we'll get up and leave early on Thursday and try to get
there by late morning. Then of course we need to come back on Friday to
Bobby get ready to "hop the pond".

What do we need to bring as far as plates, plastic silver ware and all
that
good stuff??? Of course we'll bring cokes and beer and stuff like that,
but
what else is needed?

We'll also bring some smoked turkey and dressing for Thursday too. We
can
have a smorgasbord for our meal. And since we have access to Beverly's
house, I can warm stuff up over there, so as not to get in anyone's way.

I'm looking forward to seeing yall again. We are sorry we can't be there
longer, but we're glad to get to be there some.

Let me know what else I need to bring....

Hope you've had a good weekend!

Love,
Lisa

Hey! Sorry I missed your call. I was at the mall with the girls. (I really
don't like to shop)  Bobby mentioned that Beverly's house will be available
over Thanksgiving. It'll be good to have the extra elbow room. Odds are that
Bobby and I may still stay at the bed and breakfast, just because I like it
so much. I feel so spoiled when I stay there.

It looks like we are just barely going to be able to be in Palacios. Bobby
is working Wednesday, so I think we are going to come in on Thursday. I
grimace at the thought of spending twice as much time just getting out of
Austin. I think we'll get up and leave early on Thursday and try to get
there by late morning. Then of course we need to come back on Friday to
Bobby get ready to "hop the pond".

What do we need to bring as far as plates, plastic silver ware and all that
good stuff??? Of course we'll bring cokes and beer and stuff like that, but
what else is needed?

We'll also bring some smoked turkey and dressing for Thursday too. We can
have a smorgasbord for our meal. And since we have access to Beverly's
house, I can warm stuff up over there, so as not to get in anyone's way.

I'm looking forward to seeing yall again. We are sorry we can't be there
longer, but we're glad to get to be there some.

Let me know what else I need to bring....

Hope you've had a good weekend!

Love,
Lisa

FTC, FDA, AND STATES WARN WEB SITES SELLING
BIOTERRORISM-RELATED PRODUCTS
An Internet surf by federal and state officials has
uncovered Web sites touting products and therapies claiming
to prevent, treat, or cure anthrax, smallpox, and other
health hazards and has resulted in nearly 40 letters from
the Federal Trade Commission warning the operators of these
sites to pull the unsubstantiated information immediately,
the agency revealed Nov. 19.

INSURERS' LIABILITY MAY HINGE ON MULTI-VEHICLE SALES
PRACTICE
The viability of a suit charging California insurers with
violating the Cartwright Act and the Unfair Competition Act
by requiring multi-vehicle policyholders to purchase more
uninsured motorist insurance than is needed or desired may
depend on whether the insurer issues a single policy in
multi-vehicle situations or allows the insured to purchase a
separate policy for each vehicle, according to a decision by
the California Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District
("Smith v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co., "Cal. Ct.
App., 2d Dist., No. B136688, 11/2/01).

CIRCUIT DIVIDES OVER ENFORCEMENT OF ANTITRUST SETTLEMENT
AGREEMENT
A district court's summary enforcement of a settlement
agreement in an antitrust dispute between Ohio real estate

Mom,

I'm sorry that today was particularly hard for you. It wasn't too sad for m=
e until I got your email. I had tried really hard to convince myself not to=
 think about the fact that it's been a month because today is really just l=
ike yesterday. But I got your email while talking to Mikey and started talk=
ing about it all. I realized just now that I have my old standby of school =
to stress out about but that you can't really take comfort in your work lik=
e you normally would. That must make it extra hard on you. I got to let it =
all out on Wednesday when I got to the Pink House and none of y'all were th=
ere--I had a good forty minutes to myself, and I went out on the dock and j=
ust cried (until the rain came). It is honestly so hard for me to believe t=
hat he's gone. I still feel like I'm in denial sometimes. I have recognized=
 that I feel extremely lonely right now because it seems like the whole wor=
ld has moved on and I'm caught in one place. As much as it hurts me to hear=
 that you're having a particularly sad day, it feels good to know that some=
one is right there with me. I take comfort in that, if nothing else. For me=
, the biggest struggle has honestly been how upbeat and lively PopPop was t=
he day before he died. I almost wish I could have seen it in his face or so=
mething because I feel that maybe I would have been better prepared. But on=
 the other hand, I'm so grateful to have had PopPop in good form as my last=
 memories. Sigh. This is such a process, and I feel like it's just beginnin=
g. But I know we are going to get through it, and I can tell we're going to=
 be an even stronger family because of it. I guess I'd better get back to m=
y thus far unsuccessful paper writing. My mind is evidently elsewhere becau=
se I've gotten nothing done today. Oh well I'm sure I'll get it all done an=
d do just fine. (Thanks to your "what's the worst that could happen?" speec=
h) Take care, and I'll see you Thursday.

Love,

Paige

P.S.
Call me if you want to talk...I'm always happy to hear from home.

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

Boeing Sets 2,900 New Job Cuts 
Monday November 26, 1:36 PM EST 


SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing Co (BA). on Monday announced2,900 job cuts, boosting its total since the Sept. 11 hijackattacks to 14,900 or nearly half the 30,000 jobs it has said itcould cut by the end of 2002.

The 2,900 employees getting 60-day layoff notices on Mondayincluded 2,100 in Boeing's beleaguered commercial jet unit,where orders have shriveled as airlines park aircraft and cutdeliveries of new jets to match shrinking air travel demand,spokesman Tom Ryan told Reuters.

Chicago-based Boeing said the latest cuts also include 700workers in its shared services group and another 100 mostlyfrom its embryonic Connexion airborne Internet service and itsJoint Strike Fighter program, which lost a massive Pentagonaward to rival Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT). last month.

The latest 2,900 cuts include 1,900 jobs in the Seattlearea, Ryan said.

Boeing in October announced 12,000 job cuts, which takeeffect on Dec. 14, and said it would ultimately cut a total of20,000 to 30,000 workers. The first round included 11,400commercial airplane workers and 600 from shared services.

Boeing also redeployed 200 of 600 Connexion workers in lateSeptember as airlines backed away from the service and Boeingfocused on flight safety and security applications for thesatellite-based communications network.

The aerospace giant has slashed projected deliveries fromits world-leading commercial jet unit to 350 to 400 in 2002from an expected 522 this year. In 2003 the forecast falls evenlower and some industry analysts believe the totals will falleven lower.

Earlier this month Boeing Chairman Phil Condit predictedthe current travel slump would cost the manufacturer about1,000 jet deliveries over the next several years.

Depending on size, Boeing jetliners sell for roughly $30million to nearly $200 million each. The company has said itneeds to shed workers to meet its stated goal of remainingprofitable despite the lost orders.

Several airlines have already failed and others are said tobe teetering near bankruptcy in the wake of the hijackings,which boosted airlines' operating costs and left many of theirplanes half-empty.

At the end of October, Boeing employed a total of 196,500workers and 91,600 in its Seattle-based commercial jet unit.

The company expects to send out its next batch of 60-daylayoff notices on Dec. 21, Ryan said.

Dan hasn't expressed that he feels like he'll be laid off to me.  You know, who knows what will happen.  I feel like whatever is meant to be will happen.  I don't know what Carol will be doing, she's just homebasing out of 38.  I'll be here this week, but like you, I feel like it'll be very quiet, so maybe I can get some things done too.  I have Christmas cards to do!  We took family pictures yesterday.  My brother and family were in their Salvation Army uniforms.

Please keep me informed if you hear anything, and I will do the same.

Jordan is taking Christina Mordant's last job, Corp Development.  Dan is convinced that he (Dan) will be laid off, and I'm worn out trying to talk him out of the feeling. Is Carol going back to Swaps?

I'm taking Wednesday off.  It will be very quiet all week. I may take the opportunity to run some errands.

HIGHLIGHTS

NINTH CIRCUIT USES EIGHTH AMENDMENT PROPORTIONALITY TEST TO
VOID NONCAPITAL SENTENCE IMPOSED UNDER CALIFORNIA'S THREE
STRIKES LAW

Prison terms, imposed under California's "Three Strikes"
law, that will ensure at least 50 years of incarceration for
a nonviolent recidivist convicted of petty theft violate the
Eighth Amendment, the Ninth Circuit declares. The court
finds the sentence grossly disproportionate to the gravity
of the defendant's property crimes and to comparable
sentences in other jurisdictions.

The Three Strikes law imposes a minimum 25-year sentence
without parole for any third felony offense by a defendant
with at least two prior convictions for "serious" or
"violent" felonies. The court cites several problems with
the statute, including that the triggering felony need not
be serious or violent, the prior strikes need not be violent
offenses, and there is no time period after which prior
convictions will no longer be counted as strikes. . . . Page

FRAUD ON COURT, AS OPPOSED TO FRAUD ON PTO, MAY NOT SERVE AS
GROUND FOR HOLDING PATENT UNENFORCEABLE, FEDERAL CIRCUIT
SAYS

Litigation misconduct by a patentee may be the basis for
dismissing a particular patent infringement suit but not for
finding the patent unenforceable, the Federal Circuit holds.
"Litigation misconduct, while serving as a basis to dismiss
the wrongful litigant, does not infect, or even affect, the
original grant of the property right," the court reasons.

The court distinguishes fraud on the court from inequitable
conduct before the Patent and Trademark Office in obtaining
the patent, which taints the patent itself and renders it
unenforceable by any party. The court disavows broad dicta
in a 1990 decision indicating that patents may be held
"unenforceable due to unclean hands." . . . Page 1298

PUNITIVE DAMAGES MEGA-AWARD IN EXXON VALDEZ CASE REVERSED BY
NINTH CIRCUIT AS UNCONSTITUTIONALLY EXCESSIVE

The $5 billion punitive damages award to commercial
fishermen injured by the "Exxon Valdez" oil spill is
unconstitutionally excessive, the Ninth Circuit rules. The
award is disproportionate to the $287 million compensatory
damages incurred by the plaintiffs, to potential criminal
and civil penalties, and to the $125 million restitution and
penalty settlement with federal and state authorities, the
court finds.

The unprecedented 1995 award was entered before the U.S.
Supreme Court spelled out the due process constraints on the
magnitude of punitive damages in "BMW v. Gore". Applying the
"Gore" standards, the Ninth Circuit concludes that the
district court did not properly take into account the purely
economic nature of the harm incurred by the plaintiffs, the
unintentional character of the accident, or the mitigating
actions undertaken by Exxon. . . . Page 1301

A complete topical index of Case Alert.

ATTORNEYS: A lawyer sued for negligently supervising a
lawyer-employee who bilked clients is not protected by state
statutes shielding lawyers from liability to those not in
privity of contract with them, the Arkansas Supreme Court
holds. . . . Page 1291

http://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/law2.nsf/id/a0a4y2t4m1_

BANKING: A National Credit Union Administration rule
allowing family members of a group member to join multiple
common bond credit unions without counting against the
statutory 3,000-member limit for such credit unions is
consistent with the recent changes to the Federal Credit
Union Act, the D.C. Circuit holds. . . . Page 1292

BANKRUPTCY: A bankruptcy debtor whose interest in his
ex-spouse's individual retirement account arose through a
marriage dissolution decree, not from his own employment,
cannot make use of Minnesota's exemption for IRA funds, the
Eighth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel decides. . . .

CRIMINAL LAW: A Virginia statute that bars the burning of a
cross with the intent of intimidating any person or group

overbroad in violation of the First Amendment, the Virginia
Supreme Court declares. . . . Page 1293

http://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/law2.nsf/id/a0a4y2a9u8_

CRIMINAL LAW: The imposition of two consecutive
25-years-to-life sentences under California's "Three
Strikes" law upon a nonviolent recidivist convicted of petty
theft violates the Eighth Amendment's protection against
disproportionate sentences, the Ninth Circuit determines. .

ENVIRONMENT: CERCLA generally does not preempt a local
ordinance authorizing a California city to investigate and
remediate hazardous waste contamination of its soil and
ground water, the Ninth Circuit finds. . . . Page 1295

http://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/law2.nsf/id/a0a4x3w7b1_

FAMILY LAW: A parent's use of deception to establish "home
state" jurisdiction in a child custody dispute is
"reprehensible conduct" for which the court may decline
jurisdiction under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction
Act, the Maryland Court of Special Appeals holds in a case
of first impression. . . . Page 1296

misconduct, the Federal Circuit concludes. . . . Page 1298

http://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/law2.nsf/id/a0a4x9z9j0_

PUBLIC CONTRACTS: An executive order restricting project
labor agreements on federal or federally assisted
construction projects is not supported by constitutional or
statutory authority and is preempted by the National Labor
Relations Act, a federal court in the District of Columbia
holds, permanently enjoining enforcement of the order. . . .
Page 1299

http://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/law2.nsf/id/a0a4x8p2g3_

TAXATION: The Federal Circuit upholds 1993 federal estate
tax legislation that retroactively increased the estate tax
rate on taxable estates over $3 million from 50 to 55
percent. . . . Page 1300

http://pubs.bna.com/ip/BNA/law2.nsf/id/a0a4x6e2c3_

applied to light bulbs, the Second Circuit decides. . . .

Hey! Sorry I missed your call. I was at the mall with the girls. (I really
don't like to shop)  Bobby mentioned that Beverly's house will be available
over Thanksgiving. It'll be good to have the extra elbow room. Odds are that
Bobby and I may still stay at the bed and breakfast, just because I like it
so much. I feel so spoiled when I stay there.

It looks like we are just barely going to be able to be in Palacios. Bobby
is working Wednesday, so I think we are going to come in on Thursday. I
grimace at the thought of spending twice as much time just getting out of
Austin. I think we'll get up and leave early on Thursday and try to get
there by late morning. Then of course we need to come back on Friday to
Bobby get ready to "hop the pond".

What do we need to bring as far as plates, plastic silver ware and all that
good stuff??? Of course we'll bring cokes and beer and stuff like that, but
what else is needed?

We'll also bring some smoked turkey and dressing for Thursday too. We can
have a smorgasbord for our meal. And since we have access to Beverly's
house, I can warm stuff up over there, so as not to get in anyone's way.

I'm looking forward to seeing yall again. We are sorry we can't be there
longer, but we're glad to get to be there some.

Let me know what else I need to bring....

Hope you've had a good weekend!

Love,
Lisa

The hourly index is a must for me (the day-ahead index is unhedgable for us and we would give them free money for the next 10 years).   It is important to understand that under the new proposed structure, VEPCO will call on this energy many more days than they do now and it is very important that we create an index that we can hedge.  
I will not due this deal based on a day-ahead index - it must be hourly at the interface we defined.

Please clarify your call option vs. firm delivery comment.

Kevin and Elizabeth,

Attached is a proposal summarizing our restructuring talks with VEPCO last week.  We had proposed to them what Kevin had suggested, and they said their view on pricing in Virginia is slightly different (at a discount to PJM/VAP as against a premium suggested by us).  They'd requested we send them some discussion points from our meeting today, so we can continue our discussions on an ongoing basis. Please review the bullet-point summary of our discussions last week, and the draft proposal.  We would appreciate your quick comments - but keep in mind, this is just to stimulate further discussions with them. Our overall objective is to migrate them to a new contract and away from their rights to audit the last few years.

Discussion summary:
Both parties agree that the contract needs to be revised to reflect current market conditions (pricing, liquidated damages, etc.).
Enron would retain flexibility around the physical delivery points.
VEPCO would like to continue treating this as a call option (versus a firm delivery).
Settlement:  Would prefer the Day-Ahead index versus the hourly index
Could also look at another PJM West index - VAP/Alleghany
Will look at alternate times for calling on power, if necessary
Would like to renegotiate by 12/01/01

I don't think the stock price is the key piece of the puzzle, as it doesn't impact value of the biz.  It is all about keeping the banks at bay and DYN interested.  Stay tuned for "restructuring plan" (aka layoffs) next week.

Fingers crossed?

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Ken Lay

Boeing Sets 2,900 New Job Cuts 
Monday November 26, 1:36 PM EST 


SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing Co (BA). on Monday announced2,900 job cuts, boosting its total since the Sept. 11 hijackattacks to 14,900 or nearly half the 30,000 jobs it has said itcould cut by the end of 2002.

The 2,900 employees getting 60-day layoff notices on Mondayincluded 2,100 in Boeing's beleaguered commercial jet unit,where orders have shriveled as airlines park aircraft and cutdeliveries of new jets to match shrinking air travel demand,spokesman Tom Ryan told Reuters.

Chicago-based Boeing said the latest cuts also include 700workers in its shared services group and another 100 mostlyfrom its embryonic Connexion airborne Internet service and itsJoint Strike Fighter program, which lost a massive Pentagonaward to rival Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT). last month.

The latest 2,900 cuts include 1,900 jobs in the Seattlearea, Ryan said.

Boeing in October announced 12,000 job cuts, which takeeffect on Dec. 14, and said it would ultimately cut a total of20,000 to 30,000 workers. The first round included 11,400commercial airplane workers and 600 from shared services.

Boeing also redeployed 200 of 600 Connexion workers in lateSeptember as airlines backed away from the service and Boeingfocused on flight safety and security applications for thesatellite-based communications network.

The aerospace giant has slashed projected deliveries fromits world-leading commercial jet unit to 350 to 400 in 2002from an expected 522 this year. In 2003 the forecast falls evenlower and some industry analysts believe the totals will falleven lower.

Earlier this month Boeing Chairman Phil Condit predictedthe current travel slump would cost the manufacturer about1,000 jet deliveries over the next several years.

Depending on size, Boeing jetliners sell for roughly $30million to nearly $200 million each. The company has said itneeds to shed workers to meet its stated goal of remainingprofitable despite the lost orders.

Several airlines have already failed and others are said tobe teetering near bankruptcy in the wake of the hijackings,which boosted airlines' operating costs and left many of theirplanes half-empty.

At the end of October, Boeing employed a total of 196,500workers and 91,600 in its Seattle-based commercial jet unit.

The company expects to send out its next batch of 60-daylayoff notices on Dec. 21, Ryan said.

Kay, I will be working late tonight on a turbine proposal to Allegheny four MH1 501F turbines.  Ron Tapscott and John Schwartzenburg wanted to structure it somewhat off the NorthWestern Generation transaction this past April.  I have a copy of the April 26th Letter Agreement but have some questions.  It is possible that the proposed deal might not be as complex as the one you worked on.  If you could call me tonight or perhaps early tomorrow morning I would appreciate it.
W-713-345-2520.

I am working with Rose on this also.
Thanks

Randy

Ron,

Thanks for the information. Will discuss with Kay.  

I need to talk with you to find out more details of the deal for example what you are proposing to send, when do you need the document (I think you mentioned tomorrow) (Are you thinking of an LOI to be included as part of a bid package), who are the parties (Can't tell from your 12 Nov memo), when would closing be.  Does Enron Brazil Power Holdings own them outright now or they held by some other entity where we would be acting as agent for the sale.  If so do you know who  would we be assigning Enron's Brazil's interest in the MHI turbines,  The letter that Chris forwarded dated September 14th between Enron Power Brazil was attached.  Who prepared this. Is this the Nepco letter you referred to.  Will give you a call.  

To meet your time schedule, I do need to know more specifics on what you intend to accomplish.

Randy, please call me or Ron about the attached. teh goal will be to turn dox tomorrow to move the sale along.

Kay -  word is you worked the Northwestern deal. Ron wants to borrow from the Northwestern deal as this sale wil need to be done as a sale of the entity, not just the contract. Apparently, there is more of a  customs issue involved here than a consent issue, but some of the mechanics will be similar. Could you talk to Randy about the Northwestern sale and get him connected up with the dox? thanks.

Kay, do you or Alice have any invoices in your IBuyIt Inbox?  If so, why don't you forward them to me, and I'll do them for you.   
 
I don't want to send in these invoices you gave me today until I find out if they are in either of the inboxes.  I'd hate to duplicate payments.
 
Thanks!!!!!

Hi Pete,

To my knowledge Enron and GE aren't discussing any turbine purchases (maybe I missed something).  Did Kent mention why he wanted the forms?

Unless Sheila Tweed or one of her folks commission more work, I wouldn't expect that there would be any more charges on this matter at this time.

Thanks,

Kay

Also, no outside counsel for my divestiture.  I had proposed, taking the initial cuts at the documents and including counsel for regulatory and "sanity" checks.  MH said -- do it in-house.  Interestingly, I thought that was how we would want to do it, but Jeff initially had suggested using counsel.  Do you want to go to lunch off-campus?

Enron's Stock, Bonds Drop on Concern for Dynegy Bid (Update3)
By Jennifer Ryan 
New York, Nov. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s bond and stock prices declined amid concern Dynegy Inc.'s proposed $23 billion acquisition of the biggest energy trader may fall through. 
``It's a death spiral,'' said Edward Jones & Co. analyst Brian Youngberg, who rates Enron ``sell'' and doesn't own the company's shares. ``With the declining share price and debt disclosures, the chance of the deal going through has fallen from about 90 percent to less than 50 percent.'' 
Shares of Enron, the third most-active U.S. stock, tumbled as much as 15 percent, dropping for the fourth day in a row. Investors lowered their asking price for the 6.4 percent notes that mature in 2006 to 58 cents on the dollar from 60 cents Friday. Bids to buy bonds were unchanged at 55 cents on the dollar, traders said. The bonds yield 22.55 percent. 
Concern that Dynegy may change or cancel its bid for Enron had pushed Enron's stock down 48 percent in the past three days. Enron's shares had plummeted 86 percent since mid-October after the company reported a $618 million third-quarter loss and said expansion into water, telecommunications and retail-energy sales cost it $1.01 billion. 
Part of the third-quarter charge was connected with limited partnerships run by the chief financial officer. He was ousted, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission started an investigation into Enron's accounting. The company earlier this month restated its earnings for the past four years. 
Talks on $1 Billion 
Enron said late last week talks are continuing with potential investors for as much as $1 billion. The company agreed to be bought by Dynegy on Nov. 9 for stock and assumed debt, halting a financial crisis that threatened to bankrupt Enron and throw U.S. power and natural-gas markets into turmoil. 
Shares of Enron fell 54 cents, or 11 percent, to $4.17 in late-morning trading. Earlier, they touched $4.02. Dynegy fell $1.03 to $39.37. The stock had fallen 28 percent this year. Both companies are based in Houston. 
Egan-Jones Ratings Co. lowered its rating on Enron's credit today to ``BB-'' from ``BB.'' ``Dynegy needs to show its support, or Enron will slide,'' the firm said in a report. 
``Time is not Enron's friend,'' said Stewart Morel, co-head of investment grade debt research at UBS Warburg LLC. ``There is increased concern in the market that there may be more problems that are yet to be disclosed.'' 
On Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve from lenders on a $690 million note due this week, giving the company more time to restructure its finances. Dynegy Chief Executive Officer Chuck Watson said he was ``encouraged'' by the commitment to extend the note payment, as well as the closing of a $450 million credit facility, and that Dynegy remained committed to the merger. 
$690 Million Note 
Terms of the $690 million note were outlined for the first time in an Enron filing with the SEC a week ago. Enron also said that it has less than $2 billion in cash and credit lines left. If the company's cash reserves run too low, Enron's credit rating may be cut below investment grade. That would trigger $3.9 billion in debt repayments for two affiliated partnerships. 
Enron's bankers met with leveraged buyout firms and two industrial companies to seek an investment, the New York Times reported last week. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. agreed to terms that give each of them a $250 million equity stake as part of a transaction to be completed today.

Enron Fights To Find Near-Term Sellers,But Still Trading
By Mark Golden
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/27/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) continued to struggle Tuesday to find willing sellers of near-term gas and power in North America, but the one-time market maker was still able to trade on a limited basis, according to market sources. 
"It's not getting any better," said one major energy broker.
Many energy trading companies aren't selling to Enron and are only buying from it near-term. These include Aquila Inc. (ILA), Mirant (MIR), Royal Dutch/Shell Group (RD) subsidiary Coral Energy, Sempra Energy (SRE), and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's energy trading subsidiary, said the broker. The broker estimated Enron's over-the-counter trading volume to be about 25% of what it was a month ago. Companies are willing to buy from Enron in the spot gas and power markets, because taking delivery on commodity and paying for it a month later poses no credit risk for the buyer. 
Some other companies, like Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) and BP PLC. (BP), continue to trade with Enron fairly freely, the broker said. Dynegy has reached an agreement to acquire Enron, though the terms of that deal are being renegotiated. The trading subsidiaries of troubled California utility-holding companies PG&E Corp. (PCG) and Edison International (EIX) also are trading with Enron. 
The third and largest group of companies are trading with Enron on a very limited basis to reduce exposure by taking off-setting trades against deals done long ago. These include El Paso Corp. (EPG), Reliant Resources (RRI), Tractebel SA's (B.TRB) U.S. trading unit and regulated utilities, the broker said. 
Several energy traders said that both power and gas were being sold at prices lower than Enron was offering. 
"They've been cut off from so many people," said one electricity trader. 
Enron Says Just Slight Reduction In Transactions 

An Enron spokesman said he has seen a slight reduction in transactions but not to 25% of the one-month-ago level. 
The notional value of Enron's 30-day rolling average of transactions is $2.8 billion, said Enron spokesman Eric Thode. Thode declined to give volume data for Tuesday or Monday, although the company was giving daily information two weeks ago. 
"We're not doing daily information. We're only speaking in terms of 30-day rolling averages. ... It's not fair to speak in terms of daily because of daily volatility," Thode said. 
Traders and brokers said they hope Dynegy will offer some kind of guarantee to Enron's trading to restore confidence. But, after Enron's ability to transact took a severe turn for the worse Nov. 20, Dynegy said that the companies must continue to operate independently until their merger is approved and completed. 
Energy companies began shying away from Enron over the past month, as concerns about its finances precipitated a 75% drop in its stock price and left its bonds trading at levels typically associated with junk-rated debt. 
But Enron saw its ability to trade seriously damaged last week following the late release of its quarterly financial report with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission. For the first time since Enron's troubles began a month ago, energy companies stopped selling to Enron in the spot markets for fear that Enron might not be able to pay its bills as soon as next month based on the quarterly filing. 
Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's all rate Enron one notch above speculative grade. Moody's has Enron's ratings on review for a downgrade, and S&P has Enron on negative credit watch. Fitch calls Enron's credit rating "evolving." Enron's ability to do business in the energy markets depends on its maintaining investment-grade ratings.

USA: UPDATE 3-Dynegy says in talks on Enron merger structure.
By C. Bryson Hull

11/27/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
HOUSTON, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Energy trader Dynegy Inc. confirmed on Tuesday it was in talks with floundering rival Enron Corp. over their proposed merger, as sources familiar with the negotiations indicated the final buyout price may be slashed some 40 percent. 
"I can confirm that we are in discussions with the parties involved in the transaction related to the deal," Dynegy spokesman John Sousa told Reuters. He declined to give further details.
Dynegy had planned to buy its Houston rival for $9 billion in stock and is currently in a "due diligence" examination of Enron's complex financial books that began before the Thanksgiving holiday last Thursday. 
The buyout offer, finalized Nov. 9, would have had Dynegy paying about $10.41 for each share of Enron, but Enron's shares have since cratered to near $4, stoking investor fears the merger will not go through as planned - if at all. 
The stock exchange ratio under discussion could fall from the originally proposed valuation of 0.2685 of each Dynegy share for each Enron share to around 0.15 instead, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Enron is willing to accept the lower valuation, given the pressure on its stock price, the sources said. 
Enron's shares bounced on Dynegy's confirmation of the restructuring talks, trading up 22 cents at $4.23 in late afternoon action on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares had dipped as low as $3.84 in late-morning dealings and as high $4.49. Dynegy's shares gained 4.7 percent or $1.83 to move to $41.08 on the NYSE. 
Also on the table were negotiations to extend maturation of Enron's debt past the close of the merger, expected in the third quarter of 2002. The sources said an announcement was possible on a new infusion of at least $500 million in cash, which Enron has said it was seeking. 
There also seemed to be an accord over who gets first crack at the Northern Natural Gas Pipeline, which would be Dynegy's consolation prize if the deal fell apart, a source said. Published reports have said that investment banks J.P. Morgan and Salomon Smith Barney had already accepted the pipeline as collateral in other loans, and may dispute Dynegy's ownership if the deal breaks up. 
"The pipeline is far more valuable than what has already been collateralized. There's a solid earnings stream from that thing," said one source familiar with the discussions. 
ONE TRADING UNIT SHUT DOWN 
Two sources confirmed to Reuters that Enron's equity trading unit has been told it is being closed and that the roughly 60 employees there are being laid off. Enron was not immediately available for comment. 
Those layoffs, part of broader job cuts expected as part of the Dynegy buyout, point to an acute problem for Enron - the loss of volume in its premier trading franchise. Enron's trading partners have been cutting back transactions with North America's largest energy trader because of credit concerns. 
"This business is hugely dependent on volumes and volume growth. It is the principal reason that Dynegy is making the deal. If it's worth a lot less then Enron is worth less. It's vital to stop the bleeding in its core trading and marketing business," said Commerzbank analyst Andre Meade. 
But as Enron's stock continued to lose value, down over 50 percent since Dynegy's initial bid, it seemed likely the purchase price would fall as well. Enron has seen its market capitalization drop to around $3 billion, from $60 billion at the start of 2001. (additional reporting by Jeff Goldfarb, Janet McGurty and Jonathan Stempel in New York).

Merger Traders Wary Even If Enron, Dynegy Cut New Terms
By Christina Cheddar
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/27/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Even if Dynegy Inc. (DYN) revises the terms of its acquisition of Enron Corp. (ENE), some takeover traders say the stock remains too risky. 
Earlier Tuesday, a Dynegy spokesman confirmed the company was in talks to restructure the Enron acquisition. Separately, a person familiar with the negotiations said the talks are centered on creating a package that includes a lower exchange ratio for Enron shareholders, a provision for additional funding for Enron, and the refinancing of Enron's existing debt.
Even with the boost Enron shares have received from the reports, they continue to trade at a sharp discount to the original deal's value. Enron shares recently traded at $4.30, up 29 cents, or 7.2%, while Dynegy shares changed hands at $41.50, up $2.25, or 5.8%. 
Under the original terms of the deal, Enron shareholders will receive 0.2685 of a Dynegy for each share outstanding, or $9.47 billion. At current trading levels, Enron shares are at a 61% discount to the offer price. 
According to The Wall Street Journal, Dynegy and Enron are contemplating an exchange ratio of less than 0.15 of a Dynegy share, or about $5.29 billion. 
The rejiggered deal is an attempt to restore confidence in Enron's ability to carry on its core energy marketing and trading business as the deal moves toward completion, the person said. 
As the market waits for more details from the two companies, some say it will take more than a revised offer to provide takeover traders, also known as arbitrageurs, with enough confidence to play the deal in the typical fashion. 
Often arbitrageurs bet on pending mergers by selling short shares of the acquiring company and buying shares of the target. In this way, the traders hope to profit as the target's share price moves toward the buyer's offer. 
But according to some traders, there is too much risk, even for those accustomed to uncertainty, to play the Dynegy-Enron deal in this way. 
Several traders said they were still wary that the deal could collapse and potentially push Enron into bankruptcy. 
Enron's fortunes took a sharp turn for the worst after investors began to realize the company liberally used accounting loopholes to move its debts into off-balance-sheet financing vehicles, including partnerships run by its former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. 
"There's nothing like accounting to scare people," said one trader, who said there is still a perception in the market that there is more bad news yet to come from Enron.

STOCKWATCH Enron slightly higher on hopes for new deal price

11/27/2001
AFX News

NEW YORK (AFX) - Shares of Enron Corp were slightly higher in midsession trade on reports that the company is trying to renegotiate the terms of a deal with Dynegy Inc, by cutting the price of the all-stock transaction to 5 bln usd, or 40 pct, from 9 bln usd, dealers said. 
At 12.19 pm, amid broad declines in the market, Enron shares were trading up 5 cents at 4.04 usd. Dynegy was up 1.26 usd, or 3.26 pct, at 40.51.
The DJIA was down 111.48 points at 9,871.28. The S&P 500 was down 10.40 points at 1,147.02. The Nasdaq composite was down 20.25 points at 1,920.98. 
Earlier, the Wall Street Journal said Enron was in advanced talks with Dynegy in an attempt to salvage their two week-old acquisition deal. The companies are discussing a new price for the all-paper deal, following the sharp fall in Enron's share price of the past few weeks. 
Enron had hoped to finalise the deal and make an announcement yesterday that would calm investors -- the shares are trading at a small fraction of their record high last year of 87.50 usd. 
As of today, however, the revised deal still has not been formalised. 
The current agreement with Dynegy contains a "material adverse change" clause, which could be invoked to call the deal off. 
As part of its due diligence, Dynegy is examining details of Enron's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week, which reportedly contained information it had not received previously. 
"Enron is a black hole, and I don't know how deep the bottom is," said Fadel Gheit an analyst at Fahnestock & Co. 
Only four weeks ago, Enron's stock was trading at the 8 usd mark, Gheit said, noting that if the Dynegy had done their homework the stock would not have continued to collapse. 
"The market sees this and somebody has to figure out the potential exposure, it could be several billion dollars," said Gheit. 
If the deal is to go through then the two companies must arrive at a new stock-exchange ratio, said Gheit. Under the current acquisition agreement, Dynegy would exchange 0.2685 share for each Enron share tendered. 
According to the Wall Street Journal, the new ratio is expected to be less than 0.15 share of Dynegy stock for every share of Enron stock, which would value Enron at less than 6 usd a share, or about 5 bln usd.

IN THE MONEY: Hedge Funds Say Yes To New Enron Terms
By Carol S. Remond

11/27/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- News that Enron Corp. (ENE) and would-be suitor and savior Dynegy Inc. (DYN) are working to renegotiate their merger agreement has done little to assuage market jitters about Enron's fate.
And so far, even professional arbitrageurs, who normally thrive on placing bets on whether a merger is going to go through, continue for the most part to stay clear of Enron's stock and bonds because of the uncertainty surrounding the once mighty energy trader. 
Still, reports that the equity swap ratio offered by Dynegy could be revised down to below 0.15 from 0.2685, has some hedge funds, often willing to take more risks, looking to place trades on the deal. 
"We're trying to figure out a good play," said a trader at a New York hedge fund. 
So far, bets under consideration seem to be those that would include a combination of stock and debt trading, somehow hedging a short position on Enron's shares with a long position in some of its bonds. 
"People that are playing the debt are definitely playing the stock against it," a hedge fund manager at another fund said. This manager added, "We're still trying to evaluate different risk/reward scenario on the debt and equity sides." 
Investors that sell stock short borrow shares in the hopes of replacing them later by purchasing them at a lower price. 
Arbitrageurs typically sell short shares of the acquirer, while taking long positions in the stock of the target company. But there is nothing typical about Enron's financial woes and the rescue efforts launched by Dynegy and large banks like J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. 
Traders reported increased activity in the still mostly illiquid Enron debt market. "Some bids are coming in, especially on the lower priced bonds," said a trader at a large New York investment bank that makes a market in Enron's bonds. 
Enron bonds, which had fallen in value in recent weeks, gained five to seven points early Tuesday as investors continue to await confirmation from Enron and Dynegy that their merger deal remains on track, albeit at a lower price. Enron's 6.4% bonds due 2004 were recently trading at about 55 cents on the dollar, up from 48 cents Monday. 
Under the original terms of the deal, Enron holders would have gotten 0.2685 of Dynegy shares for each of their Enron shares. Quoting people close to the discussions, The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the new ratio is expected to be less than 0.15 share of Dynegy stock for every share of Enron stock. That lower exchange was also mentioned in a Dow Jones Newswires story last Friday. At current prices a 0.15 exchange ratio would value Enron at less than $6 a share. 
Essentially this new value, if true, means that it has now become easier for hedge funds and other risk takers to play the merger odds. 
When a hedge fund shorting Enron stock at $4 a share risked losing more than $6 if the merger went through at the 0.2685 ratio, it now stands to lose only $2 a share (based on the $6 value of Enron stock under the new 0.15 ratio). At the same time it has become much easier to hedge that loss potential by going long on Enron bonds. If the merger doesn't happen, Enron is seen by many as heading for bankruptcy with an ultimate share value of 0. That means that hedge funds shorting Enron at $4 stand to benefit by that amount. 
Hedge fund managers and traders said that current thinking puts the value of Enron bonds at about 20 cents on the dollar if the merger fails and about 80 cents on the dollar if it goes through. Meanwhile, the value of Enron stock is capped at about $6 a share if the merger goes through with a new conversion ratio of 0.15. 
"A lot of the guys are still very skeptical," said a bond trader at a New York bank. "But this is really making the hedge trade easier and we've seen more customers short the stock and buy the bonds." 
Still, this type of bets isn't for the faint of heart, and most investors are likely to wait for more news before taking a position. 
"We're nibbling a little bit at the bonds right now. But the situation is so volatile that it's difficult to be aggressive," the manager of a large New York hedge fund said.

Dynegy Confirms Talks On Enron Deal Structure - Source
By Christina Cheddar
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/27/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Dynegy Inc. (DYN) confirmed the company is in talks with a number of parties regarding the structure of its transaction with Enron Corp. (ENE). 
"I can confirm that we are in discussions with the parties involved in the transaction related to the structure of the deal," said John Sousa. "I can't elaborate any further at this time."
An Enron official wasn't immediately to comment. 

Earlier Tuesday, a report in The Wall Street Journal quoted people familiar with the matter who said Enron and Dynegy were in advanced discussions to cut the price of the all-stock transaction by more than 40% to about $5 billion. Sousa, the Dynegy spokesman, didn't comment on the newspaper report. 
Dynegy shares recently traded at $40, up 75 cents, or 1.9%, while Enron shares changed hands at $3.94, down 7 cents, or 1.7%. 
Under the original terms of the transaction, Enron shareholders are to receive 0.2685 of a Dynegy share, or $10.78, for each share outstanding, or about $9.14 billion, based on Dynegy's recent stock price. 
According to the Journal report, the new terms could be below 0.15 of a Dynegy share. 
The deal is critical for Enron, which also simultaneously carrying out talks to receive between $500 million to $1 billion in additional funding to support its operations, while carrying on negotiations to restructure its debt, which totals about $13 billion. 
While Dynegy has already provided Enron with a cash infusion, it is uncertain how long Enron's current funds will allow it to remain solvent. 
Meanwhile, a third employee lawsuit has been filed against Enron over lost 401(k) retirement savings due to the recent collapse of Enron's stock, which has declined more than 90% in the trailing 12 months. The suit claims Enron "locked down" the plan, which prevented employees from being able to sell the shares, and seeks $850 million for plan losses. 
Although the other recently filed employee suits didn't disclose the amount of compensation the plaintiffs are seeking, it is possible the suits seek a similar level of damages, a CreditSights report said. 
If this is true, the CreditSights report said, it is possible the clause that allows Dynegy to walk away from the deal if the liabilities from "pending"' or "threatened" litigation may exceed $3.5 billion may be invoked. 
In addition, to the employee lawsuits, more than a dozen shareholder suits have been filed against Enron.

The discussions between Enron and Dynegy aren't merely focused on revising the consideration Dynegy will pay. They are also aimed at providing Enron with additional funding and at restructuring its debt, said a person familiar with the negotiations. 
The moves are aimed at restoring confidence in Enron and relieving "the perceived liquidity crisis," the source said.

USA: Enron shares down despite talk of new Dynegy deal.

11/27/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
NEW YORK, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Shares of financially troubled energy trading giant Enron Corp. slipped back into the red on Tuesday after gaining in opening trade following news of a new rescue deal from Dynegy Inc. . 
Enron shares were down 2 cents at $3.99 after rising 19 cents, or 4.7 percent, to $4.20 in early dealings on the New York Stock Exchange.
Analysts questioned the viability of the original proposal for Dynegy to acquire Enron in a deal worth about $9 billion. 
The Wall Street Journal reported that the companies were discussing reducing the price of the all-stock deal by more than 40 percent, to about $5 billion.

Enron Credit Rating to Remain Unchanged for Today, Moody's Says
2001-11-27 16:12 (New York)

Enron Credit Rating to Remain Unchanged for Today, Moody's Says

     New York, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s credit rating
will remain at ``Baa3,'' the lowest investment grade, by Moody's
Investors Service, which said it won't take any ratings action
today on the largest energy trading company.

     David Stimpson, Moody's managing director for ratings
communication, said although there was speculation in the market
that Moody's would make a ratings change, the company won't take
any action on Enron today. Stimpson declined further comment.

     Moody's had been expected to make a statement on Enron's
credit as bankers sought to raise as much as $2 billion for the
energy trader in private equity.

     Bankers led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Vice Chairman James B.
Lee have been unable for two weeks to raise the money because of
concern Enron won't be able to meet its obligations. That concern
was heightened after Enron disclosed a $690 million payment due
this week. Enron needs the money to operate as it completes an
acquisition by Dynegy Inc.



Enron Turned Down by Investors Alwaleed, Blackstone, Carlyle
2001-11-27 15:16 (New York)

Enron Turned Down by Investors Alwaleed, Blackstone, Carlyle

     New York, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s bankers,
seeking to raise as much as $2 billion for the energy trader, have
been turned down by investors including Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal,
the Carlyle Group Inc. and Blackstone Group LP.

     ``I was approached by several people to invest in the
company, but we declined,'' said Alwaleed, a billionaire investor
from Saudi Arabia. The fall in Enron's shares, which have declined
95 percent this year, didn't necessarily make it a good
investment, he said.

     Bankers led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Vice Chairman James B.
Lee have been unable for two weeks to raise the money because of
concern Enron won't be able to meet its obligations. That concern
was heightened after Enron disclosed a $690 million payment due
this week. Enron needs the money to operate as it completes an
acquisition by Dynegy Inc.

     The prospect that Enron will fail to line up financing,
jeopardizing its plan to be acquired by Dynegy, has weighed on its
stock and bonds. The company's securities gained today as talks
between Enron and Dynegy to renegotiate terms of the transaction
convinced some investors the takeover was more likely to take
place.

     Enron 6.4 percent bonds that mature in 2006, which closed
yesterday at 48 cents on the dollar, rebounded to trade at about
55 cents on the dollar. At that price, the bonds yield 22.5
percent. Enron shares rose 21 cents, or 5 percent, to $4.22. The
stock finished yesterday at $4.01, its lowest level in 14 years.

                        Declining to Invest

     J.P. Morgan and Citigroup Inc., Enron's largest lenders, plan
to provide $250 million to Enron each as part of a $2 billion
package. The bankers have been seeking additional investments,
which would be made in the form of convertible stock, for more
than two weeks.

     Questor Management Co., a $1 billion private-equity fund that
invests in troubled companies, and buyout funds such as Carlyle
Group and Blackstone have balked at investing, said people
familiar with the situation. Blackstone and Questor declined to
comment. Christopher Ullman, a spokesman for Carlyle, said: ``We
are not in discussions with Enron about financing.''

   ``More equity would leave Enron with a stronger balance sheet,
which should reassure their trading partners,'' said Kathleen
Vuchetich, who helps manage $1.4 billion in assets at the Strong
American Utilities Fund. Vuchetich has 4.2 percent of her
portfolio invested in Dynegy shares.

     Enron and Dynegy discussed revising the terms of their merger
over the weekend, said Steve Stengel, spokesman for Dynegy. Dynegy
is now talking about paying less than 0.15 share for each of
Enron's, valuing the company's equity at about $5 billion, or less
than $6 per share, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people
close to the discussions.

                               Terms

     ``The concern is that the Dynegy deal breaks down,'' said
Paul Tice, co-head of U.S. high-grade credit research who covers
the energy market for Deutsche Bank.

     Current terms call for an exchange ratio of 0.2685 share of
Dynegy stock for each Enron share. Given recent disclosures about
Enron's debt and the drop in the stock price, a fairer ratio would
be 0.15 share of Dynegy, said Ronald Barone, a UBS Warburg analyst
who rates Dynegy a ``strong buy.''

    Under current terms, the deal makes sense for Dynegy only if
Enron earns 85 cents or more next year, said Gordon Howald, an
analyst at Credit Lyonnais who rates Dynegy a ``buy.'' UBS
Warburg's Barone has reduced his estimate of Enron's 2002 earnings
to 75 cents a share from $1.65.

     Enron needs an infusion in part because it has $9 billion of
payments due before the end of 2002 and less than $2 billion in
cash and credit lines. The decline in reserves has also raised the
prospect that Moody's Investors Service may cut Enron's credit
rating. A lower rating would trigger $3.9 billion in debt
repayments for two affiliated partnerships.

                           Cash Question

     ``The main question is: `What is the cash position right
now?''' said Tice at Deutsche Bank. ``Is the falloff in the cash
position of the company stabilizing or not?''

     Moody's hasn't issued a report on Enron since the company
filed a quarterly report with the Securities and Exchange
Commission last week announcing it had a $690 million note due
this week. On Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve from
lenders on the $690 million note and closed on a $450 million
credit line. Dynegy Chief Executive Officer Chuck Watson said he
was ``encouraged'' by the developments.



Liberty Funds Analyst Paik Comments on Dynegy and Enron Talks
2001-11-27 11:56 (New York)


     Boston, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Edward Paik, an analyst at
Liberty Funds Group, comments on Dynegy Inc.'s proposed
$23 billion acquisition of Enron Corp., the largest energy trader.

     Paik has Enron shares among the $3.6 billion in assets he
helps manage at Liberty.

     Dynegy may renegotiate terms of its bid for Enron, people
familiar with talks between the Houston-based companies said
yesterday.

     ``The stock market is clearly 100 percent certain the Dynegy
deal won't go through as negotiated,'' Paik said. ``We're just
waiting.''

     ``If they announce they've renegotiated the deal, it will be
implicit that due diligence has been done, and that Dynegy won't
walk away for anything that's happened up until now. If they were
to impose more conditions, what good is that? Dynegy needs to
resuscitate Enron back to health.''



A.G. Edwards Analyst Heim Comments on Dynegy and Enron Talks
2001-11-27 11:00 (New York)


     St. Louis, Missouri, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- A.G. Edwards &
Sons Inc. analyst Michael Heim comments on Dynegy Inc.'s proposed
$23 billion buyout of Enron Corp., the largest energy trader.

     Dynegy may renegotiate terms of its bid for Enron, people
familiar with talks between the Houston-based companies said
yesterday. Heim rates Enron ``sell'' and Dynegy ``hold'' and
doesn't own shares of either company.

     The market is waiting for confirmation and details of a
renegotiated bid, Heim said.

     ``We'd need to know why they'd agreed to a new price,'' Heim
said. ``It also needs to be combined with some sort of shoring up
of Enron's trading business, which needs to be stabilized for the
deal to have real value.''



Commerzbank Analyst Meade Comments on Dynegy's Talks With Enron
2001-11-27 10:42 (New York)


     New York, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Commerzbank Securities
analyst Andre Meade comments on Dynegy Inc.'s proposed
$23 billion buyout of Enron Corp., the largest energy trader.

     Dynegy may renegotiate terms of its bid for Enron, people
familiar with talks between the Houston-based companies said
yesterday. Meade rates both companies ``hold'' and owns no shares.

     ``If they are renegotiating, it confirms our fears that
Enron's crown jewel, its marketing and trading business, is
deteriorating,''

      Investors are waiting for a sign on the state of the
business, Meade said.

      Enron's trading business was worth more than $10 billion
before partners began shunning it on credit concerns, Meade said.
A lower price struck by Dynegy may reveal how much business has
fallen, and whether Dynegy believes Enron can regain it, Meade
said.

     A New York Times report that banks may extend payments on
some loans until after Dynegy purchases Enron ``raises concern
that Dynegy will be hurt by taking on the vast liabilities of
Enron,'' Meade said.





ENRON SHARES RECOVER FROM A.M. SLUMP
By Lisa Sanders
CBS.MarketWatch.com

4:10 PM ET Nov 27, 2001

HOUSTON (CBS.MW) -- Shares of Enron recovered from the morning's sub-$4
a share level Tuesday amid reports that the embattled energy merchant is
working with Dynegy to renegotiate its takeover offer.


Enron (ENE), which once hit $84.88 during the last holiday season,
added 13 cents to close at $4.14 on volume of 68.4 million shares. The
stock was the most actively traded on the New York Stock Exchange
Tuesday.

Dynegy shares added $1.64 to close at $40.89.

The New York Times reported that Houston-based Dynegy (DYN) and Enron
are renegotiating Dynegy's bid, once valued at $9 billion in stock.
According to the report, Dynegy is worried that Enron's core business --
energy trading -- is deteriorating. See full story.



Getting it done

_______________________________________________________________________

Glen Hilton, portfolio manager of the Montgomery New Power Fund, said
it's a "crapshoot" as to whether the deal gets done.

"I think that regardless of the outcome Dynegy is still in a good
position for the long-term," he said. His fund liquidated its Enron
holdings completely in mid to late-October. "Enron was the leader (in
energy trading), and it's clearly suffering so Dynegy is in a good shot
to take up the mantle."

Hilton pointed to Enron's 10-Q, filed last Monday with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, and the falling share price as potential
triggers of the deal's material adverse affect clause. Those two things
could very well make Dynegy walk away from the merger. If that happens,
Hilton said, an Enron bankruptcy is a very real possibility.

"Very few companies understand what Enron does and Dynegy is one of the
few that could make something out of it," Hilton said. "If Dynegy can
restore confidence in Enron's trading business and get Northern Natural
Gas, it looks like it might be worth the headache."

Dynegy has the rights to Enron's Northern Natural Gas, a pipeline
system, whether the merger goes through or not.

Enron wasn't immediately available for comment. Dynegy, through a
company spokesman, confirmed that it was in discussions with "the
parties involved in the transaction" related to the structure of the
deal.



Top Of The News 
Enron In Free Fall 
Dan Ackman <javascript:newWindow('Ackman')>, Forbes.com <http://www.forbes.com/news>, 11.27.01, 9:00 AM ET 

NEW YORK - If not for Sept. 11, Enron would be a major scandal; as it stands, it's a minor scandal. The Houston-based energy company, whose Chairman Kenneth Lay is a personal friend of and top fundraiser for President George W. Bush <http://www.forbes.com/2001/10/12/gwbush.html> and Vice President Dick Cheney, is in free fall. The bailout by rival Dynegy made public three weeks ago appears to be unraveling. 

Dynegy's (nyse: DYN <http://www.forbes.com/finance/mktguideapps/compinfo/CompanyTearsheet.jhtml?tkr=DYN> - news <http://www.forbes.com/markets/company_news.jhtml?ticker=DYN> - people <http://www.forbes.com/peopletracker/results.jhtml?startRow=0&name=&ticker=DYN>) buyout of Enron (nyse: ENE <http://www.forbes.com/finance/mktguideapps/compinfo/CompanyTearsheet.jhtml?tkr=ENE> - news <http://www.forbes.com/markets/company_news.jhtml?ticker=ENE> - people <http://www.forbes.com/peopletracker/results.jhtml?startRow=0&name=&ticker=ENE>) was originally valued at $9 billion. But just as the deal was announced, Enron said its prior financial reporting was inaccurate and that it had overstated earnings by $586 million over the past four years. 

While the companies have not said the merger is off, investors don't believe it will happen, at least not at the stated price; they have bid Enron shares down to the point where the company has a market value of less than $3 billion. The shares closed yesterday at $4.01, down from $78 a year ago. 

The situation is in flux, as it has been for months. During that time, several top Enron executives have been forced to resign. Jeffrey Skilling, Enron's former chief executive officer, left in August for "personal reasons." 

Company officials said they hope to announce, perhaps as early as today, a series of changes: a lower price for the takeover; a cash infusion of $500 million; new, extended loan terms by Enron's bankers; and somehow, an agreement that prevents Dynegy from walking away in the face of litigation over Enron's devastated employee-retirement plan. Lawsuits by shareholders are sure to follow, considering Enron's restatement and the pay it lavished on executives, including Lay who received $135 million from salary, bonus and the exercise of stock options in 2000 alone. 

For now, Dynegy says it still wants to do a deal for its crosstown rival with 2000 revenue of $101 billion. 

Even more alarming than the deterioration in the share price is the crisis of confidence in Enron's reliability as a trading partner in worldwide energy markets. Last year, Enron was the dominant player in natural gas and electricity trading--a fast-paced, complex business quite removed from the company's history as a gas- and oil-pipeline builder and operator. The fear now is that other companies will refuse to trade with Enron out of trepidation that it will file for bankruptcy and not pay its bills. 

The company had $10.5 billion in debt as of its last annual report, and that number has likely grown by 20%. Already, credit agencies have cut their ratings on Enron debt. 

Dynegy and its partner, ChevronTexaco (nyse: CVX <http://www.forbes.com/finance/mktguideapps/compinfo/CompanyTearsheet.jhtml?tkr=CVX> - news <http://www.forbes.com/markets/company_news.jhtml?ticker=CVX> - people <http://www.forbes.com/peopletracker/results.jhtml?startRow=0&name=&ticker=CVX>), may pump billions of dollars into Enron's operations if the purchase goes through. But the deal will certainly undergo regulatory scrutiny and will take months to close. Investors and energy traders are increasingly doubtful that Enron can hang on by itself. 

Enron bills itself as one of the world's leading energy, commodities and services companies. It says it "markets electricity and natural gas, delivers energy and other physical commodities, and provides financial and risk management services to customers around the world." While all this may be true, its popularity with investors was based largely on its fast-growing revenue--much like the Internet companies whose collapse it mirrors. 

Few shareholders had any understanding of what Enron did to generate that revenue, and indeed Enron's own auditors at Arthur Andersen were confused. Most of the revenue was generated from trading, but the company's shares sold as if it was still an industrial company and not a financial firm. 

Enron was famous for being famous. Before the start of the 2000 baseball season, it purchased the rights to have its name on Houston's new ballpark. By 2002, Enron Field may need a new name. 

The name Enron itself sounds like it has something to do with energy, but it means nothing. At the time the company was formed from the merger of InterNorth of Omaha and Houston Natural Gas, the idea was to call the company Enteron. But the namers then looked in the dictionary and found out that Enteron means "intestines;" they decided to drop the "te" in the middle and go with Enron. Soon Enron may be part of Dynegy, a much smaller company in terms of revenue. If the deal falls apart, it may want to go back to Enteron.

Enron Turned Down by Investors Alwaleed, Blackstone, Carlyle
By Mark Lake 

New York, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s bankers, seeking to raise as much as $2 billion for the energy trader, have been turned down by investors including Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal, the Carlyle Group Inc. and Blackstone Group LP. 

``I was approached by several people to invest in the company, but we declined,'' said Alwaleed, a billionaire investor from Saudi Arabia. The fall in Enron's shares, which have declined 95 percent this year, didn't necessarily make it a good investment, he said. 

Bankers led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Vice Chairman James B. Lee have been unable for two weeks to raise the money because of concern Enron won't be able to meet its obligations. That concern was heightened after Enron disclosed a $690 million payment due this week. Enron needs the money to operate as it completes an acquisition by Dynegy Inc. 

The prospect that Enron will fail to line up financing, jeopardizing its plan to be acquired by Dynegy, has weighed on its stock and bonds. The company's securities gained today as talks between Enron and Dynegy to renegotiate terms of the transaction convinced some investors the takeover was more likely to take place. 

Enron 6.4 percent bonds that mature in 2006, which closed yesterday at 48 cents on the dollar, rebounded to trade at about 55 cents on the dollar. At that price, the bonds yield 22.5 percent. Enron shares rose 21 cents, or 5 percent, to $4.22. The stock finished yesterday at $4.01, its lowest level in 14 years. 

Declining to Invest 

J.P. Morgan and Citigroup Inc., Enron's largest lenders, plan to provide $250 million to Enron each as part of a $2 billion package. The bankers have been seeking additional investments, which would be made in the form of convertible stock, for more than two weeks. 

Questor Management Co., a $1 billion private-equity fund that invests in troubled companies, and buyout funds such as Carlyle Group and Blackstone have balked at investing, said people familiar with the situation. Blackstone and Questor declined to comment. Christopher Ullman, a spokesman for Carlyle, said: ``We are not in discussions with Enron about financing.'' 

``More equity would leave Enron with a stronger balance sheet, which should reassure their trading partners,'' said Kathleen Vuchetich, who helps manage $1.4 billion in assets at the Strong American Utilities Fund. Vuchetich has 4.2 percent of her portfolio invested in Dynegy shares. 

Enron and Dynegy discussed revising the terms of their merger over the weekend, said Steve Stengel, spokesman for Dynegy. Dynegy is now talking about paying less than 0.15 share for each of Enron's, valuing the company's equity at about $5 billion, or less than $6 per share, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people close to the discussions. 

Terms 

``The concern is that the Dynegy deal breaks down,'' said Paul Tice, co-head of U.S. high-grade credit research who covers the energy market for Deutsche Bank. 

Current terms call for an exchange ratio of 0.2685 share of Dynegy stock for each Enron share. Given recent disclosures about Enron's debt and the drop in the stock price, a fairer ratio would be 0.15 share of Dynegy, said Ronald Barone, a UBS Warburg analyst who rates Dynegy a ``strong buy.'' 

Under current terms, the deal makes sense for Dynegy only if Enron earns 85 cents or more next year, said Gordon Howald, an analyst at Credit Lyonnais who rates Dynegy a ``buy.'' UBS Warburg's Barone has reduced his estimate of Enron's 2002 earnings to 75 cents a share from $1.65. 

Enron needs an infusion in part because it has $9 billion of payments due before the end of 2002 and less than $2 billion in cash and credit lines. The decline in reserves has also raised the prospect that Moody's Investors Service may cut Enron's credit rating. A lower rating would trigger $3.9 billion in debt repayments for two affiliated partnerships. 

Cash Question 

``The main question is: `What is the cash position right now?''' said Tice at Deutsche Bank. ``Is the falloff in the cash position of the company stabilizing or not?'' 

Moody's hasn't issued a report on Enron since the company filed a quarterly report with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week announcing it had a $690 million note due this week. On Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve from lenders on the $690 million note and closed on a $450 million credit line. Dynegy Chief Executive Officer Chuck Watson said he was ``encouraged'' by the developments.
