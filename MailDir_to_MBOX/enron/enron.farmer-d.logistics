Mike,

As you may recall, this meter needs to be set up for May 2001 just as it was for April 2001.  Below is a screen print of what April 2001 looks like.  When you had previously attempted to set this meter up, I believe it wouldn't let you because of one (or both?) of the contracts being canceled or expired.  I have inquired as to what can be done and have learned that you can contact Global Counterparties and have them temporarily set the contract(s) back up for a short period to give us time run the volumes through the system.  As I am unfamiliar with this process and the Global Counterparty personnel, I do not have a contact for you.  Hopefully this is something you may have had to do in the past.  Since this is a call-out meter, I can enter the actual volumes in once the contracts are set up and appear for May 2001.  In case you need to enter them, the volume should be as follows:

Contract 012-41500-05-002 	HPL 		Injection     16,149
Contract 012-88494-05-001 	TX Genl Land 	Withdrawal 16,149 

I have been advised that this volume needs to be entered by the end of October if at all possible, therefore, your prompt attention to this matter would be most appreciated.  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to give me a call.

Buddy

Can you cut off deal 47472 going forward? I am forwarding the message from

Karie:  Deal number 60747 should be the good deal.  Deal number 60747 is an 
interruptible storage deal and contract 96016959 is an interruptible 
contract.  Storage deal 47472 is a firm storage deal.  Since it doesn't agree 
with the firmness of the contract, I would probably cut off that deal going 
forward.  -  Tommy

There are two Storage deals that are using the same contract number. Julie 
Meyers believes that deal 47472 is the correct deal, but wants to check with 
you first since you put in deal 60747. Let me know when you look at them if 
we need to cut off or kill deal 60747.

Karen,

I've looked in POPS and on day 16 of January 1999, I see a total confirmed 
volume of 61,365 and an actual of 62,151.  If I'm understanding you 
correctly, you're asking me to allocate all of this volume to deal #51862.

If so, that's incorrect.  Several deals are associated the this days volume.

Please write back or phone back with further details.

Thanks

Jackie, 

Volume is allocating to deal number 51862 on 1/16/99 on meter 984132, however 
the deal does not have this day on it.  Please have 1/16 added to the deal so 
the error will clear.

Thanks and if you need additional info, let me know.

Karen

For prior periods - I am not sure if you need to handle this using the 
instructions below - or if for prior months ONLY - if  you would be allowed 
to create a 
cashout ticket to clear out any prior period imbalances.   Your controller 
and volume management (Kathy Kelly) should make this call.

Kim and David can brain check me on this - but I think this is how parking 
should be done; however,
please verify with West or East desk economics to ensure accuracy/consistency.

PARKING PROCEDURES

Create a Storage deal in SITARA - Service Type: Parking  
Use this service deal to path to a storage account in UNIFY - this way you 
have accounted for the gas in UNIFY
Inject into storage account
Withdrawal from storage account

(When you do the opposite of parking - withdrawal first - it is called a 
"loan") 

Create two economic deals in SITARA - Exchange deal
Create an internal buy and sell of physical gas for economics and position 
purposes - (no invoices - fake 3rd party) 
Exchange deal - 
Sell to CPR Pipeline Exchange (parking gas)
Buy from CPR Pipeline Exchange (getting gas back)

Within the month parking - no money exchanges hands - except any service fees 
which can be recorded on the Storage deal.
Sell to CPR Pipeline Exchange (parking gas) -   Price = $0
Buy from CPR Pipeline Exchange (getting gas back) Price = $0

When the deal crosses a month - if you keep the risk within the desk - in the 
short term you record a big loss - sell at $0 - and the 
next month you record a big gain - buy at $0.   To manage this - usually the 
cash desk swaps out the time risk to a storage financial book - who will pick 
up the time 
spread loss and offsetting gain - as this book captures forward value.     
When you are adjusting your physical injections (parking) within the month - 
you will need to
adjust your swaps too - which will adjust the P&L for the time spread 
accordingly - otherwise you will have liquidation problems.

Period 1 - Sell to CPR Pipeline Exchange (parking gas) -   Price = $0   Swap 
to firm book for Index + mid
Period 2 - Buy from CPR Pipeline Exchange (getting gas back) Price = $0   
Swap to firm book for Index + mid

been posted to MSAS.  They are in the  process of trying to correct the 
problem.  However,  you will not see your charges in MSAS this month per 
Corporate IT.  ENA Consolidations is in contact with Corporate IT to ensure

The MTBE plant will continue operating at lower production rates of 
approximately 8 MBD to 9 MBD until April 6 or 7 at the earliest.  It will 
possibly be mid-April before full production can be resumed.  This is the 
result of the steam boiler problem experienced on Friday, March 24.  When 
more information is available, this will be updated.

FYI - We don't have any active contracts behind this meter.  There was a 
dedicated reserves purchase contract with Phoenix Gas Pipeline Company that 
terminated 7/31/99.  There was also a GTC - 1st Purchaser/Marketer with El 
Sordo Gathering Systems, Inc. which expired 8/1/99.

If you are aware of any other contract that we don't reflect in the Global 
Contracts database, please let me know.  Otherwise, there isn't any action 
that my group needs to take regarding this shut-in.

Subject: Shut-in of #986315

Meter 0986315 Shawnee Spring Common Point was shut-in on 6/13/2000 due to 
high dew point.  Repeated attempts by the pumper to dry out the gas have 
failed.  The meter will remain shut-in until the dew point is within pipeline 
quality specs.

I received a call from Carl Drachenberg with HMS at approximately 1:45 PM on 
6/13/00 stating that he pulled a stick on meter #986315 and it was wet and 
flowing at 35 lb. I asked Gary Hanks what we want to do and he said to have 
Carl notify the producer and shut it in.   I notified Carl and he got in 
touch with the producer and they shut the compressor down at approx. 2 PM on 
6/13 and at that time there wasn't any flow.  Carl came back out there at 8 
AM on 6/14 and closed the valve and removed the chart. There was no flow 
after they shut the unit down and it was flowing between 500 and 300 mcf.  
The meter is now out of service.

Any questions - you know where to find me.

Attached per your request is the Big Cowboy production for October 2000.  I 
also have the Gas Volume Statements from Coral Energy that shows the actual 
daily volumes for all of the meters, receipt and delivery, if you need that 
level of detail.



If there is anything else let me know either today or tomorrow because I will 
be on vacation next week.

Stacy,

 Oasis only show a delivery of 330,000 at point 1427.  We have two deals 
pathed for this volume: DEAL 158220 Lower Colorado - 300,000 (Mtr1472), and 
DEAL 157279 30,000 (Mtr 1472).  My issue is that the original Lower Colorado 
deal was for 310,000.  The additional 10000 is pathed on Mtr 1516. Do I cut 
deal 157279 by 10000 to make up to Lower Colorado? If so, could you please 
path it at point 1427 so that I will tie back to Oasis.  Please let me know 
as soon as you decide what to do.  Thanks

I'm not sure if you can help me, but I have a Danny Conner deal from Decemb=
er 2000 that has a price issue. =20

We were buying gas from The Houston Exploration Company on Black Marlin, Hi=
gh Island 138/HPL meter 98663, deal 508426.  The deal was priced at HSC - 0=
.14.  In December, a new platform came on, High Island 115/HPL meter 986431=
.  It did not start flowing until the 20th.  Danny did not put a new deal i=
n for this meter, so we combined the gas on deal 508426.  The Houston Explo=
ration thinks that the gas at HI 115 should be kept separate and priced at =
HSC GD - 0.14 since it did not begin flowing until the 20th.  We agree that=
 we received the gas.  We have the pipeline statement from Black Marlin.  W=
e just don't have the same pricing.  The Houston Exploration shows that we =
owe them an additional $222k due to this price difference.  We only purchas=
ed this gas in Dec 2000 and Jan 2001.  The deal for Jan, 547063, was priced=
 at GD - 0.14.  Can you verify how this deal should be priced?  I sent this=
 issue to Danny back in January and he said the IF price was correct, but T=
he Houston Exploration is sticking to their price.  If you need to talk to =
their trader, his name is Lester Lipperdt 713-830-6960.

TEXAS - Bammel, Centana, and PG&E Texas Pipeline.
WEST - Colorado, PG&E (one contract), PG&E Gas Transmission Northwest, 
Questar, and Williston
EAST - Cove Point, Dominion, Columbia Gas, Gulf South (Koch), National Fuel, 
Sonat, Tennessee, Transco, Egan, and Napoleonville.
SITHE - Union

Please provide the requested information below.

Thanks for your help in this matter.

Gas Accounting is initiating a project to ensure consistent treatment of

book codes and cost of inventory schedules that you have for each of the 
physical storage facilities.  We will also need what you show as the 1/31/01 
inventory balance for each.

David, 
I believe that we already have the information for Bammel.  Please provide 
the info for other Texas desk storage, if any.  

I would like to have this information as soon as possible.

Thanks, everyone.

just a quick reminder that we need to cover the Entex delivery off of Oasis.

currently ENA has a transport agreement on Oasis.  This agreement will not be assigned.

Not use AEP has an agreement on Oasis.  Just to make sure, I would recommend we
sale the gas to AEP/HPL at the point for the month of June just to make sure the delivery
is made.

Let me know what you think.

thanks

commercial teams your group was supporting overall ?  In addition, I noticed 
you allocated 15 hours to the activity ES002 - Non Routine Trade Monitoring &

I spoke to her over the phone and told her that we were short of the nom and 
she told me that a buy back needs to be put into place..  HL&P has paid us 
for the full 20,000 on the 27th.   We have a Entex Meeting on the 5th in Room 
37C1 @ 11:30, we can all discuss it then if you want to.

As I mentioned earlier, Lisa Hassold (PG&E) clarified that the PG&E Delivery
Point #00534580 is for the Maypearl Interconnect with Lone Star Pipeline
(rather than the other PG&E NTP 36-inch interconnect at Maypearl with
TUFCO's Old Ocean Line).

Again, thank you all for your help in the first nominations (Lone Star North
Line and Lone Star South Line) that Midlothian Energy Limited Partnership,
as limited agent for ABB Asltom Power Inc, has made for testing purposes at
the Midlothian power plant.

 Desk Managers,

I wanted to follow-up from the staff meeting this week on the item to get a representative from each of the desks, who will be the designated tester in addition to Richard.   Please respond with that person name.

Matt,

It would be helpful to all us to know when you will need these resources so we can manage the workload.

We're currently identifying processes that are inefficient and could possibly benefit from being rewritten or not even performed.  Going foward, I would like Bob to appoint a lead business person to whom we could ask questions and or suggest ideas to so that they could in turn validate this information with the desk managers/schedulers.  We had this approach with Nomlogic and having Clarissa work the issues worked quite nicely.  Who ever you choose, we would need about 15% of their time for now.  Later on, with coordination efforts and testing, it may go up to 75%.  I don't see that happening for a while though.

FYI

This is a reduction in total capacity from 528,000 to 400,000 at Station 809.

HPL has typically been running about 180,000 to 200,000 mmbtu through Station 
809 in August.  We can pull more gas off of the A-S line at Swan Lake to keep 
our throughput around the 175,000.  

My original conversation with EPFS was that the capacity would be limited to 
around 400,000 mmbtu total during the maintenance.  Station 809 will be down 
through the weekend and we will get a better picture of how much we can move 
without 809 running.  I will visit with EPFS on Monday and see if we can get 
the volume bumped up (to 400,000) and adjust on Tuesday as necessary.

If you have any questions please call.  36449.

Channel A/S Line Maintenance

Station 809 has scheduled maintenance on their 1B Solar Centaur Turbine for
the three gas flow days of August 15, 16 & 17, 2000.  During this
maintenance the 2 reciprocating engines will be operating.  The estimated
capacity through Station 809 during this time is approximately 350,000
mmbtu.  Both owners are entitled to 1/2 of this capacity(175,000 mmbtu) &
should schedule accordingly.

Contact me if you have any questions.

Imbalance update:  I spoke with Mike Bilberry and confirmed that this deal 
really is Energy In/Energy Out.  We should not be impacted in any way by a 
reallocation to correct PVR percentages or a C5 correction at the plant.   
HPL/ENA should rereceive the same volume, Dth for Dth at the residue or at a 
redelivery point such as Lobo/Agua.  I have left a message for my counterpart 
at Duke and am requesting that they deliver to us, somewhere, an additional 
20,125 Dth/Day for the month of December to balance us out.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.  I will advise 
everyone upon their agreement to payback so that our respective positions 
reflect the additional supply.

On Oasis and PGEV, we have been buying and selling as HPL.  However, we have been transporting the gas under ENA.  This is primarily for spot and base deals.  We want to keep these transport contracts with ENA.  The only term deal we have at Waha is to Tufco (0-60,000/day).  This deal is under ENA with it's own firm transport contract (now on Guadalupe Pipeline, which was previously Teco/PGEV).  The sale and transport will go with HPL.  The sale to Entex off of Oasis (currently under the ENA, will be assigned to HPL) must be served off of Oasis.  So HPL will need to acquire an Oasis contract for this deal.  Let me know if you have any more questions.

I would think that the first contract should go the AEP.  ENA won't be selling to Equistar
off of Channel for at least three months.  ENA will have to get a transport agreement with
HPL or Channel.

On the second contract:  Is HPL making the sale or ENA?  Is it a sale that is going
to AEP.  I know we are serving a small Entex point off of Oasis.  Is that for convenience,
can HPL sever the point some other way?

Someone let me hear what you think.

I spoke with Daren and there are a few contracts that he was aware of:

1. Channel -  012-15600-02-069	ENA using HPL's capacity - selling to Equistar on Channel

2. Oasis and PGEV - HPL is using ENA's capacity

3.  Tejas Ship and Tejas Gas - Daren says we don't do business often on these pipes as ENA, but we always have the possibility that we will at any time, so ENA would need it's own transport contracts

Let me know if anyone has questions.  Thanks!

I have some flow at the above referenced meter without a deal.  Flow was for 
the first 2 days only, and probably occured as the meter was in the process 
of being shut in.  We purchased the gas from Torch-Rally Partnership in 
Sept.  Can you extend the deal, or should I allocated off to strangers?

Please advise.

Mary

NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
published : October 17, 2001
FERC Issues NOPR on Intra-day Recalls of Released Capacity 
Given the inability of the natural gas standards-setting organization to resolve the issue of intra-day recalls of released transportation capacity, FERC has issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NOPR) that would give releasing shippers the flexibility to re-nominate their recalled capacity at the next scheduling opportunity provided by an interstate pipeline. 
Existing Gas Industry Standards Board (GISB) standards require a shipper that wants to re-nominate recalled capacity to notify its transportation provider by no later than 8 a.m. Central Clock Time (CCT) on a nomination day at the latest, and bars partial-day recalls of capacity. FERC proposes to allow shippers to recall capacity and re-nominate the recalled capacity at each of the three intra-day nomination opportunities. 
"By enabling releasing shippers to recall and renominate capacity quickly, they will have greater incentive to release capacity, providing capacity purchasers with an alternative to purchasing pipeline interruptible service. At the same time, this proposal will provide replacement shippers whose capacity is recalled with the same advance notice and protection from bumping as is provided to interruptible shippers under the Commission's regulations," the NOPR said [RM96-1-019]. 
Existing GISB standards applying to capacity-release recalls were adopted in 1996, when there was only one nomination per day at 11:30 a.m CCT and a single non-standardized intra-day nomination, it noted. "But the circumstances under which the recall standards were developed have markedly changed as the number of nomination opportunities have now expanded to four nomination opportunities." 
Given the lack of "consensus supporting" GISB's existing recall standards and the standards-setting group's failure to settle the issue, the Commission is forced to "resolve the policy question regarding partial-day recalls," the NOPR said. Permitting partial-day recalls of released capacity, the Commission concluded, was in keeping with the overall regulatory changes that it enacted in Order 637. 
The Natural Gas Supply Association (NGSA), which represents major producers, and Houston-based Dynegy let FERC know that they weren't big fans of partial-day recalls. These could undermine system reliability, they contend, by shutting in production and increasing scheduling problems, overruns, penalties or operational flow orders. 
But the Commission discounted these arguments. "...[T]he use of partial-day recalls should create no additional scheduling problems since recalls will be scheduled according to the existing scheduling requirements. In effect, releasing shippers using partial-day recalls are creating another form of interruptible transportation to compete with pipeline interruptible capacity, and shippers purchasing recallable capacity should be subject to the same scheduling rules that apply to interruptible transportation. Partial-day recalls will be no more likely to result in shut-in production than interruptible transactions that are subject to being bumped under the current standards," the NOPR noted.

On 5/1/2000 recorded flow of 9 Mmbtus from HPL's pipeline.   Deal #222051 was 
at this meter during April 2000, but the deal expired on 4/30/2000.  
Currently, this volume is being booked to the HPL Stranger Gas Contract.  
Logistics needs either (1) Deal #222051, (2) New Deal, or (3) approval to 
write-off this volume to Unaccounted for Gas.  (Please print, sign, and 
return original to Clem Cernosek).

Hey kids, Why don't we pool our resources and get " El Jefe " something nice?  Not like last year... I won't mention names (Donna).... when some individuals within the team didn't want to include the rest of us in their "reindeer games" for bosses day. Any suggestions? Round of golf, gift certificate??? I nominate Suzanne to collect the money. Any objections?
THANKS

Cheryl Jones has just left me a message letting me know that their 
programmers are working on a fix to the problem as we speak.  Cheryl is 
postponing our meeting for tomorrow till she has more information from the 
programmers.  Mike,  Cheryl  said her boss (Gary Anderson) has sent you a 
response to your concerns about this same problem could you let us all know 
what his response is.  In the mean time,  George could you give us a list of 
the known meters that were having  this problem with so I can give it to 
Cheryl,  and I'll try to get some kind of time frame from Cheryl as to when 
we can expect to hear something back from them.  Thanks to all.

Peggy and Patricia,

This is the last allocation exception I have to clear.  When you have the 
time, could you check the volumes for gas days 28 - 31 for October, 1999.  I 
phoned Peggy this morning regarding this meter, and apparently it is outside 
measured.  I need to verify that flow occured so that I can have a deal(s) 
extended to allocate the flow to.

Thank you again for all of your assistance, I really appreciate all that you 
have done.

Mary

Daren,

I am going to leave a copy of the meter volume, and prior purchases to review.


Thank you for you assistance and patience.

Mary

Please find the attached spreadsheets listing the unfinaled sales invoices 
for May production.  We have indicated which group is responsible for the 
outstanding item in the "Responsible Department" column.  The Settlement 
coordinator is also listed on these spreadsheets.  Please have your team 
members contact the coordinators directly for the information needed to final 
the invoice.

As communicated last week in our meeting with Sally, the deadline for 
completing this work so that the invoices can be finaled is Friday, June 16, 
2000.  We appreciate any efforts your teams can make in expediting the 
research to ensure we can final all May invoices by the end of day Friday.

Thank you for your support and cooperation in these efforts.

Daren---  

Oasis will be doing away with the temporary passwords for their on-line nom & confirm system effective 4/1/01, so it looks like you will need to review the agreement and get set up on it.  It is not mandatory, however; they are encourageing everyone to get on board.  Let me know what you want to do.  I have attached the agreement, and info on the nom/confirm cycles.  I have been using it this week and it is pretty user friendly.  The reporting capabilities are still being developed, but I am told it should be ready soon.  Take a look for yourself @ www.oasispipeline.com..........logon:  north.....password:  enron........currently, no intradays are allowed online(only by fax/email)  because they want to approve same days, but they are looking at allowing them in the future.

Deal 709296 should be on ASTRA Power LLC,  we have it on ADTRA Resources, Inc.  I spoke with their trader Sherry Wayman and she said that she did the deal with Daren Farmer and it should be ASTRa Power LLC  for April 2001.

Could you fix asap because payment is due on 25th.

Daren,

Do you know if this deal was supposed to run through 12/00 and 1/01?  It was 
a deal to buy 400 per day from Harman Operating and is currently in for 
11/15/00 to 11/30/00.  Volume management said they are looking for their 
money.

Let me know.  

Thanks.

Stella,
It is very important  that King Ranch is accurately scheduled in the 
system.   Sitara should be updated
with any changes so that Daren can properly manage the Texas Desk position.  
Hopefully we have moved
enough off of your desk to allow  you to concentrate on King Ranch.  Too many 
discrepancies have been made
and it is very costly to the desk.    Robert can assist if needed.     
Thanks,    Pat

Sorry bout the first comment, did not totally understand... We will handle this via the OA process, where I'm working with the OA group that will allow us a bucket of income or loss and we will run this through Tom's P&L... This will be a pass through for Tom's book... O

Megan

As I mentioned to you yesterday, it still looks like the volumes for gas delivered to TX GLO do not have Linda Robert's origination fee deducted.  Do we need to execute a PMA with TXGLO to deduct those volumes from the next delievery?

Also isn't there an entry that is missing in your file to capture the $ cost of gas for the gas delivered to TXGLO?  Is that being captured in Unify or is it being manually entered by Gas Accounting?

Darren
Do we need to execute a seperate deal ticket for the origination deduct?

Susan/Laynie
What busines unit are these cost centers rolling up to (11814 & 27117?)

Eric:
I reviewed the gas deals on Franks' spreadsheet and they agree with what is in Sitara.  As soon as I have the October gas numbers, I will forward them to you.

Attached is a spreadsheet of the TGLO deals booked to the GL to help you with our current settlement position.  It is divided by debit/credit entries.  When the sales are booked, a debit hits the customer account to create the open sale to apply the cash to and a credit hits the revenue account (40004000 third party; 40005000 intercompany) for the profit center.  

Below is a summary of where we are on the sale dollars to EGM.  I have already sent an email to risk to update the demand fees for the prior months and to book Aug and Sept crude.  I will wait for the go ahead from Frank before I final them to the GL.    Let me know if you have any questions.

These are my estimates. The volumes for April at T-ville and Colorado RS are 
either spot or April only. Janet does not know about next month yet.
So, 5000 total is a safe assumption.

Apparently, we inadvertently rolled the Duke delivery to Mobil refinery into April and gas flowed to Mobil via Centana from Duke April 1, 2, and 3.  I understand that there were no tickets entered into Sitara to cover that flow, so I have captured the transaction in Sitara utilizing the following tickets:

#727481  reflects the HPLC purchase from Duke on Centana's pipe April 1,2,3 total volume estimated to be 21,490mm
#538950  has been updated to show deliveries to Mobil refinery off Centana's pipe for the same time period, same volume
#727497  reflects HPLC selling the gas back to Duke (payback) at the same price it was purchased, a volume of 10,000mm for 4/12, at meter 7001

Please let me know if there are any questions.  If I've screwed something up, my apologies!!

Daren and Lauri:

We do have a problem with some of our mirrored meters.  When MIPS receives an 
"incomplete" from the parent meter it sends a -0- to POPS.  Yes, this is a 
big problem.  Our POPS team (Romeo D'Souza) has identified this problem and 
notified MIPS.  However, he was told this was not a priority item.   In the 
mean time we are overriding the volumes in POPS with the estimated volumes.

This particular meter was correct last night, the 14th rolled last night from 
MIPS and overrode the BAV with a -0- from day 14 forward.

This was corrected this morning and the meter re-allocated.

Thanks,

Charlotte

Subject: PG&E Texoma Volumes

In reviewing some of the imbalance numbers, I discovered that Valero Texoma 
(#71) BAV volumes have not fed into POPS since 3/14 causing an out of balance 
at the meter in excess of 500,000mm month to date.  The more critical part of 
this problem, however, is that POPS has fed 0 volumes back to Sitara on some 
of the HPLC deals.  This means that these purchase volumes (expenses) have 
not been picked up in Tom's P&L and are, instead, sitting in UA4.  To the 
extent that the purchase prices vary from the UA4 value, the P&L may take a 
hit when these actual volumes flow through.

I realize that Kim is out and that you guys are stretched thin, however, a 
problem of this magnitude needs to be addressed as soon as it's discovered.  
Someone needs to be overriding the 0 volumes so that Sitara is receiving 
correct information and the P&L is kept as accurate as possible.

Please give me a call if you have any questions.

Here is the weekend calls

Sat. Dec 23

9:45 am                 Bruce at PG&E called with some cuts. I called Eddie 
and informed per his request due to the deep cut at 9g96.
           9gd5 was cut from 16495 to 16488.   They parked the cut for us.
           9g96 was cut from 45000 to  38092.    Bruce and Eddie worked out a 
deal on that.

10:00am               Daren Farmer called requesting that we move the 
miles/Bayer gas from  the plants at meters 988056 and 981550 to the Katy tail 
gate due to wet   gas. I called Lee Papayoti and Rick Tiotrowski from Bayer 
to inform of the move and to get Bayer to nom with Midcon. Called Jackie 
Young and   she was already and her way to the office for other reasons and 
she Kindly renomed and resent the nom the tailgate for me .  THANK YOU    
JACKIE FOR YOUR KINDNESS. 

10:20am               Bruce at PG&E called again with some cuts at Channel 
due to El Paso.

  980584 Agua Dulce was cut from (on the channel transport) 21964 to 16884 
for  a new point total of 50156.  Old point total was 45076.
  Called  Gas Control and asked them to call channel's gas control and 
confirm. Called Sabrae to inform. 

3:30 pm                 Bruce Called again with more cuts
  980584 Aqua Dulce as cut again on the channel transport.   16884 was cut to

informed of the new numbers and asked to call Channels Gas Control to 
confirm.  

10:00am    Sam from Gas Control called and informed me that the Bayer plants 
didn't want to take any gas from HPL  due to the water content. The tail 
gate   still had the intraday change in place and so does Midcon apparently

l move   the 10000 back haul to HPL which I did.   The 5000  Duke gas we 
moved over to 5896 and will move to back to HPL on our 202 contract.  
Marilyn   said there will be a 1% fuel and a 4 cent change but  we could pay 
the fuel at another time or use it against the imbalance so she confirmed the 
full   5000.    New meter total is 49765.

4:00pm                Cindy PGE called with more cuts
  96d5 was cut from 16259 to 16100
  9g96 was cut from 45000  to 36215.  Cindy said that they would not park the 
gas this time for us.  I called Eddie to inform and he said he would call   
Cindy and dazzle her with his charm and wit and fix the problem.  Well that 
didn't work so we ended up moving it from TECO on the Mid TEX line   to 8740 
on HPL.

There is a drab of gas; 34 MM's on the first of August on the meter.  
Probably from valving off.  The above ref'd deal was from Jul, do you want to 
extend it for one day?  Let me know.

George,

There seems to be a problem with MIPS while trying to actualize
the January 2000 data (Y2K related). In order to actualize JAN
POPS has to manually load the actual files into POPS, the 
side effect of this is that some of the FEB data may be loaded
with numbers that are old. This will be rectified as we complete
loading the JAN actuals and then load the most recent MIPS
measured prelim numbers for FEB.

POPS is currently processing the MIPS files in the order they
were received, we should be done with this today. Please inform
us of any abnormalities that you see tommorrow.

thanks
Romeo

I have identified the additional HPLC wellhead purchases and have made 
corrections to the interconnect tickets accordingly.  Jackie is still having 
difficulty identifying all the wellhead purchase.  We feel there are at least 
6 meters flowing a total of appox. 7000 a day that are not showing up on a 
HPLC purchase or a HPLR transport.  I believe she has given you this 
information and will await instructions or for the purchases to be input 
reflecting the proper Enron Entity purchasing these volumes.

We have worked very hard on this issue and I apologize that it has not yet 
been entirely corrected.

Daren,

I have flow at this meter for the first, 118 Dth.  There is an expired 
purchase from Highland at the meter, but, this deal ended August 31st.  HPL 
had a deal with Highland in October to purchase these volumes (deal ticket 
418382).  I think that the deal needs to be extended, it looks like the valve 
was not completely shut by 9 am.  Pat has asked that this issue be resolved 
today, so, your assistance would be greatly appreciated.

Mary

During the period of 11/10/99 through 11/11/99, the above meter recorded flow 
of 1,613 Mmbtus.  There was no deal at this meter the month prior or after.  
Currently, Logistic has these volumes recorded to HPL Strangers Gas

Stacey,

Settlements has brought an invoice to zero out a sale of 10,000 mmbtu to El 
Paso Merchant Energy for 4/20/00 on PGEV.  There are 2 packages of  5000 deal 
numbers 247426 and 247583 on the market side and deal 247676 on the supply 
side.  These are HPLC brokered deal on PGEV that are buying and selling the 
same 10,000 to El Paso Merchant Energy.  The purchase and sale price is the 
same $3.02.  I do not know the intent of these deals so I am hesitant to just 
zero out the volume.   Will you let me know if that is okay?

Sales 
#451362

We billed Wyman Gordon 363 mmbtus at $4.7328 in Sept 2000.

 I spoke with Richard Moran at Wyman Gordon and he indicated that he has not 
had any physical gas deals with us in over a year and does not owe us the 
$1,718.01 we billed him for September.

Can you please validate if this is his gas or if this deal ticket should have 
been linked to some type of financial deal.  

Thanks- Katherine

I noticed that the Midcon transport usage tickets at Oakville & Moore are not 
in for March.  The previous deal tickets are 598934 & 598958 for that 
transport.  Should they?  Let me know if you want me to set up new tickets if 
need be...or let me know if you create them, so I can update MOPS & POPS.

Hello,

We have prepared January and February data and will be scheduling meetings 
with you in the next few weeks.  For the month of March, please provide a 
completed "Hours" survey for each position within your group.  This survey 
will collect the  time your team spent on performing their activities in the 
month of March.   

NOTE: We are now collecting EOL related activities.  If you spend time 
directly supporting EOL, and your survey does not have an activity that you 
can assign these times to, please contact me as soon as possible so we can 
add the appropriate activities to your survey.

To fill out the survey:

At the top of the spreadsheet, you will see a box labelled "Select Your RC".  
Click on the box and input your RC number, which will need to be 4 digits.
Once you have done this, another box will appear with the message "Select 
Position from Drop Box!" You can then select the position (i.e., staff, 
specialist, etc.) and "OK". The choices for positions are based on 
information contained in the Org Database (i.e., if a position is not listed 
that should be, please call me to discuss as it would indicate that 
corrections need to be made to the database).  Once you have the list of 
activities, please input hours (for the entire month) for each activity 
listed in the column labelled "Hours".
If you're filling out the survey for your team, save a file for each of the 
positions you fill out for your team prior to filling out the next position.  
If you do not, the information will be lost.

We have included February compiled hours per position (if you had two 
specialists performing the same activity - 20 hours each, the "Last Month" 
column would show a total of 40 hrs for that month).  As with last month, you 
have the option to complete the survey on behalf of your entire group or send 
this survey to each of your team members, allowing each individual to fill 
out the time they spent on each activity.  If there are any activities you 
perform not included in your survey, please contact me as soon as possible 
for a copy of the Activity Dictionary.

Please return these surveys by end of day Wednesday, April 5th.  If this is a 
problem, please notify me or Lisa Cousino immediately.

Thanks,
Shari

Can we verified this gas flowed?  If it did it should have been billed on his term deal if there was one in place.  If the gas flowed and we did not invoice for it on term let me know and I will put it in.

Deal #157288
Location: Centana
Days:  3/11-3/31 (gas is not a part of the exchange agreement).  

I need to have the spot deal placed on a different deal ticket than the 
exchange deal (#157288).
Will you break out this spot deal separately?



Thanks for fixing the price for the ETXG gas system in March.

Deal # 157288
Per our conversation yesterday afternoon, pls. separate the Centena term deal 
from the spot deal in Sitara for March 2000 production.  
Also, I need to have the price for the East Texas redelivery changed in 
Sitara from HS Index $-.085 to HS Index $-.0825.  This is per the contract 
the price for this redelivery point.

Team:

The attached provides a summary of our goals & objectives for 2000.  We have 
a number of challenges this year, but we making good progress building on our 
success in 1999.

The 2000 goals and objectives were developed as part of last year's budget 
process and were refined during our recent offsite.    A compilation of the 
presentations from the offsite were distributed to each of the VP's for 
discussion with their groups.  It will take continued effort from each of us 
to shift our source of earnings from monetizations to commercial 
origination.  As always, your ideas and active participation is encouraged.

Regards,
Brian

The GL currently has 1,177,186 MMBTU @ $3,548,001.99.  

I believe the sale took place in the facility.

Jim,

Where did the sale take place?  Was it an in place sale at the facility?  Stephen is working on the reconciliation.  If he cannot have it completed by this close, then we will have unaccounted for until he finishes his reconciliation.  We will do everything possible to get it cleared this close.  What does the G/L currently have for the storage number?

Rita,

It looks like we will be making our Bammel true-up payment to AEP in the next couple of days.  Included in the payment to AEP is a deduction for the sale of the Centana storage gas.  We are selling them 1,236,286 MMBTU @ $2.375 for a total of $2,936,179.25.  The sale is for September, 2001 production.  We will need a deal put in Sitara for that sale along with the appropriate pathing from storage by logistics.  However, there is only 1,195,754 MMBTU on report 006 in Unify (for contracts 96018371, 96014189, and 96019236).  How do we account for this volumetic difference?  Connie will be truing up the GL to match the current Unify volume.  The GL was short approx. 18,000 MMBTU because a beginning balance was not booked.  

This needs to happen before the upcoming close.

Thanks for you help in this matter.

Please let me know of any concerns.

Hi Everyone,
 See attached a listing of the documented enhancements that pertain to ENA 
Upstream.  What we need to do next is develop an impact for each one that 
gives an estimate of the number of hours saved for each item.  Please supply 
these savings where your name is listed if you haven't already done so.  The 
vision and purpose of this list is to provide Holland & Davis ( a consultant 
) and upper management with the necessary information to determine the extent 
of IT resources that would be needed to enhance Unify.  I will need your 
replies by COB May 31st.  

 

Thanks,  MVE

In response to Cheryl's note, in looking at a copy of a Confirmation Letter confirming the proposed agreement reached on March 1, 2000 to be effective April 1, 2000 through March 31, 2001, there is evergreen language.  
A termination letter is being prepared to be faxed to Exxon with an original to follow for their records. 

Cheryl, this GTC is different from the ones we usually see in that HPL required signatures from both parties executed by Exxon on 3/30/00 and HPL on 8/21/00.

If you have any questions, please call me at x35231.

Thanks, Kim

Subject:	Re: Exxon Company, USA Global # 96035668/Sitara # 212225   

I have re-checked Sitara & verified that the above deal was a Term, Firm deal.  This resulted in a GTC Purchase Firm contract being set-up in the Global Contracts System.  The term of the GTC was set as the term of the deal (4/1/00 thru 3/31/01) with no evergreen, meaning that the contract will expire at the end of this month.

To the best of my knowledge, all GTC Purchase Firms have the same language & they do not have evergreen.  They expire at the end of the primary term.

So, unless Exxon negotiated a deal with different, special language to allow for evergreen & included something about a "10 day notification" to terminate, there isn't any reason to "terminate" this contract.

If this is the case, please advise.  Otherwise, I don't think we need to do anything.  The contract will expire at the end of this month on its own.

Prior to 7/99  this was ENA not HPL, but there may be some issues on it as well for 3/99 to 6/99.  The deal ticket we used was 62717.  I will have to look further into the ENA activity because I know we still have some invoices that were paid under one company and we still have drafts under the other.

Daren, 

I am trying to get some payments out to Williams for old months 11/2000 and 1/2001 but global counterparty said this deal should have Black Marlin Pipeline Company Inc. instead of Black Marlin Pipeline Company effective 3/99.  The Black Marlin Pipeline Company was for an internal record (when it was an Enron entity).

I need help on this one.  I spoke to Gary shortly after he sent this e-mail the other day.  I wasn't sure what to say in the letter regarding how long they would be shut in -- Is there some repair that needs to be done to remedy the situation?  Are we ever going to take the gas again?  Should I tell them that it will remain shut in until the gas meets our specs?

At Gary's suggestion, I called Mike Morris & left a message, but haven't heard back from him.  Therefore, I am sending this e-mail to see if anyone else can give me some advise on the contents of the notification letter that I need to send out.

Thanks in advance for any help that you can give me.

Clarissa - Thanks so much for all your help with this pipe!  Everything looks great.  I just have a couple of paths
that I need to finish it:

January 2000 - I need deal #854688 pathed for EPGT and for TETC.  According to the invoice, we should have
                      11,129 dth on the interconnect.

February 2000 - I need deal #871184 pathed for HPL and CHAN.  HPL should have 3,600 dth and CHAN should
                       have 11,500 dth on the interconnect.

July 2000 - Deal #871172 has an interconnect issue.  According to MOPS contract #105124, they received 8,275 dth
                 on the Matagorda 624, but according to EPGT, they delivered 10,362 dth to HPL (?)  Could this possibly
                 need to be split somehow, or do you have any other ideas?

Let me know.  Thanks, Gloria 3-7118

This is one of the deals which you told me to zero out.  Unfortunately, I do 
not allocate PGEV.  Also,  Sherlyn has actualized PGEV and she has the 
support from the pipeline for the 1746918 volume.  Please let me know if I 
had missed something in our conversation.  Thanks

Tom, we attached both a consolidated p&l and an updated prudency schedule. 
The weater hedge made $165,000 today.  The only odd thing that we saw was the 
physical change due to deal changes with the HPLC Operational desk. This desk 
is a desk that is set up to account for fuel, gas loss, and physical UA4, we 
have tickets out there with zero volumes on them that get updated after the 
month is over once volume management knows where the gas needs to be 
allocated. What we found out that happened was that in the last week of 
February and in the first week of March Sitara added volumes to these tickets 
before were were running comparison reports to see the changes.  Darren 
noticed the incorrect volumes on these tickets and had logistics zero them 
out.  Darren thought that the changes would have no position effect as if it 
were a deal between HPLC and Texas, but it is actuall as if we changed a deal 
that we did with another region.  The value was offset by changes in TUFCO 
and storage.  We released $270,000 out of March prudency to keep you flat for 
the day.  Hope you had fun at the school function. I'll be here until about 
8:30, so feel free to call if you get this.
Bryan

I'm sorry, did we discuss BMC???.

Lee can confirm the accuracy of this, but BMC bought 20,000 from us and 
intended no swing and no buyback. Brandywine (Dorcheus) controlled the meter, 
therefore it is their responsibility to make up the overs and unders. I 
believe a deal is in place with Brandywine to cover that very issue for 
November. If not please let me know.

Lee, if this is not your understanding for Nov. business please let us all 
know.

Thanks 
Ken

Subject: Re: Meter 1428 Oct 99 - Beaumont Methanol

Lee, 
I need you to answer a few questions to resolve this issue.

First, you show a deal volume of 20,000  on Nov. 7 and the pipeline confirmed 
this volume.  Is this the volume you agreed to sell Beaumont Methanol?  This 
volume is in agreement what the deal ticket says, the volume confirmed by 
HPL, and Dorcheus's volume.  

Second, the buyback issue is that  a buyback is set up until June 2000 per 
Julie Meyers notes she sends out every month ( Last note sent Dec  3 and you 
are on distribution list) .  Brandywine has nothing to do with this issue. It 
is an issue between HPL and Beaumont Methanol.

Do we have an active buyback in place and how do you decide to use the 
buyback?

This is a commercial issue that I need further clarification from you if you 
have a buyback in place or not.  If not, please notify Julie and note on the 
deal ticket that this buyback is no longer effective.
If it is still active, please contact Chyral and resolve.

Let me know the final resolution.

Daren -
We had flow of 76 for the month of April but no deal came across in Sitarra.
Per Lee Papyotti, a deal is in place for April but he does not know the deal
number - he told me to ask you.
Thanks - Julie

Wanted to give you a heads up to these flexible physical deals that might 
involve your desks via EOL in the near future. We already have one in the 
East.  I stressed to the Sitara/EOL folks the importance of adding comments 
to the term sections of these baseload and term tickets so we know what is 
happening.  One side of these buy/sell or exchange deals will be ratable and 
the corresponding partner ticket will have the optionality.Comments will 
include the corresponding deal number, that it is in fact a buy/sell or 
exchange deal and the delivery time period(3,5 or 10 days) that the 
counterparty desires.
I hope this helps...THANKS!

Got any ideas on how this transaction should look.  This looks like a monthly 
volume that would be further refined to daily on the expected volumes once 
the counterparty has made their decision  (I would imagine logistics will be 
the one communicating with the counterparty).  We probably need EOL to 
indicate whether it is a 3, 5, 10 day delivery cycle and then indicate this 
as comments.

Linda/Karen -what are your thoughts on how separate GTC would work on this.

If we could all do a little homework.  I will get something scheduled for 
next week to discuss further.

We are positioning ourselves to release a new Product Type that we will refer 
to as a Flexible Physical Gas product. Legal is in the process of drafting a 
GTC and Product Type description that will be used with this Product Type. I 
will start the building process once Legal provides the GTC and Product Type 
description; but in the interim, here's a broadstroke description of how the 
transaction works:

Party A and Party B exchange gas during the month of June 2000.

Party A buys 10,000 MMBtu per day (or 300,000 total MMBtu) at TCO Pool Index

Party B has the right to notify Party A of when Party B wants to take 
delivery during the month of June, and may take delivery in one of three 
forms: 3-day delivery, 5-day delivery, or 10-day delivery. The gas nominated 
for each such day would be a percentage of the total 300,000 MMBtu (i.e.; If 
Party B chooses 5 days for nomination, Party A would deliver 20% of the 
300,000 MMBtu on each of those 5 days for a total nom of 100%).  Party B pay 
TCO Pool Index PLUS a premium.

I understand that this type of transaction is currently done 
over-the-counter. Scott Mills has previously issued an explanatory e-mail of 
Sitara concerns and we should begin to address those issues.

Bjorn - if you could ask someone to prepare a Sigma Factor in advance, then 
my turn around time to for the Product Type should be reduced. Also, due to 
the varying 'optionality', do you think these three different products will 
require three different Product Types?

Please feel free to call if you have any questions.

Hi Daren,

I saw the volumes come across for deal 819594. Thanks for taking care of that so promptly. On day 18, did you intentionally enter 50,000 days or was it a slip of the fingers? Did your information conflict with Jill's--she shows 30,000 for that day...................

Hey guys,

Just wanted to make known my concerns on this issue.  While I agree that 
Howard, Robert and George needed to work on this together, I do not think 
that Howard should have been the driving force behind this.  Once we left the 
meeting, they all convened on the 37th floor and worked from Howard's desk - 
with Howard sitting down doing much of the work.  I also think that the below 
e-mail should not have come from Howard, but should have originated out of 
the Logistics group.  I understand that Howard has prior scheduling 
experience, but he is not functioning in a scheduling role now and bascially 
took on that role in getting this set up correctly.  He too had to sit down 
and try to figure out what needed to be done and set everything up correctly 
(?).  In my opinion this is a kudoo for Howard for stepping up, but I am 
concerned at the role that he played.  Team effort is important and it's what 
we all want between our groups, but I want to ensure that everyone does their 
fair share and expectations are appropriately placed.  Let me know what you 
both think.  Thanks!

Pat Dresner (accountant) at Midcon Texas says she does not show these deals 
in her system and she can not pay on them.  You created the deals in Sitara 
and I don't have another trader's name.  Could you please talk to your KN 
trader regarding this situation?  If Midcon really got this gas, then someone 
at KN should tell their accountant about the deal.

Prod Mo. Entity     Point  Volume  Total Amount  Sitara #

Please let me know as soon as possible what you find out.  The 2/2000 
production invoices are due to be paid 3/27.

My latest understanding is the buyback will be in place through 12/31/99.

A new deal for 15,000/ day begins 1/1/00 and currently has no buyback

Robert:

I have updated the info at Enron Methanol per gas control's volumes (via 
meter overrides).  I did not realize that's what you wanted when you handed 
me the "sticky" on Monday.....  I thought you were just being informative.

Sorry about the confusion.

 This is a follow up to the note I gave you on Monday, 4/3/00 { preliminary  
flow data provided by Daren}.

 Please override POP'S  daily volume{ presently zero}  to reflect  daily 
activity you can obtain from Gas Control.
 
 This change is needed  ASAP for economics purposes.

Daren,

Wanted to let you know that there are still two sitara deals that need to 
have the expected volume brought down to "0" of the list that I previously 
sent you.
They are 114099 and 92918.

I appreciate you revising the ones that you have and you probably were going 
to handle the above two today.  In case you were please disregard this 
notice.  If you had fogotten, this can serve as reminder.

As usual, thanks for your help.

I have a volume issue with meter 986315 for 1/00 production.  The volume has 
been split between El Sordo and Torch Rally.  I think all of the volume 
should be under Torch Rally.  Please let me know if you find something 
different.  The old months have already been corrected.

Thanks,

Rich & Ellen:

We have some problems with the following two counterparties: TXU Gas Distribution & Enbridge Consumers Gas.  For TXU Gas Distribution, this is a unconsolidated division of TXU Gas Company and all deals booked under TXU Gas Distribution should be confirmed as TXU Gas Company.  I understand this is not the case.  For Enbridge Consumers Gas, this is not a valid entity.  At some point it will be a correct name, but for now deals should be confirmed and booked under Consumers Gas Co. Ltd.  

Each has a relatively recent deal booked to it that need to be changed as described above: Sitara 1085609 for TXU and 1086002 for Enbridge Consumers Gas.  

Please advise if there is something I need to do from my end to get this issue resolved.  

Thanks,
Max Sonnonstine

These troubled times mandate that Enron take a fresh look at our contingency plans for conducting business away from the office.  Bob Superty has asked me to put together a survey on processes and equipment that could be used if schedulers could not get into the office and use normal business processes and resources.

Please forward this memo and ask your respective schedulers to take a moment to fill in the requested data from your desk spreadsheets below.  We would like to have all responses received before November 1st. 

Please e-mail all responses to Richard Pinion with an updated Excel spreadsheet attached.  I will put together a master sheet from the individual replies.

thx

Here's the latest Global Performance Management Schedule for YE2000 and some 
friendly reminder tips for you and your direct reports.   The system is 
scheduled to open for feedback in 35 days.   Please forward all mid-year 2000 
evaluations to Janet De La Paz at EB3658a.

July 31-Oct 13th  Development & Testing
Oct. 2 -13th           Training-HR Community
Oct 9-27th             Training-All Employees
Oct 16th               System Opens to HR Community
Oct. 23rd         System Opens for Feedback
Nov. 17th        System Closes for Feedback
Nov. 20th        PRC Meetings begin
Dec. 15th        PRC Meetings Conclude
Jan 4-5th         Executive Committee Meeting

Reminders
Request that employees maintain an updated list of their acheivements and 
contributions to your group.   Tell them the information they forward to you 
will better help you in representing them.   
The focus of the PRC this year will remain on development of the employee and 
will emphasize comparing everyone within a particular peer group relative to 
everyone else in their peer group.  
Update your documentation of employee performance and communicate the key 
highlights of their performance or lack thereof  now with your direct reports 
so that the evaluation process creates minimal or no surprises for your 
direct report.   It is much easier to have a constructive evaluation session 
with your direct report if he/she already knows what the key areas of needed 
development are.   An ideal situation for the supervisor is one in which 
employees with performance issues (can't do or won't do) choose to exit the 
group voluntarily before the self evident evaluation has to be given. 

I will continue to provide updates and reminders as they become available.  
Let me know if you have any questions. 
hgm

Tom,

Can you please seek Daren's advise on nom adjust at the aforementioned meter 
due to this meter receiving 19 mmbtu's on a 28 nom?

Daren, there are two Sitara deal numbers associated w/this receipt meter 
(both gathering) 154608 and 138572.  138572 is Wellhead gas.

Thanks
-Jackie-

Jay,

Let's not assume what impact this will have. Even though it is better to zero out deals we(VM) wouldn't want to go in and zero out 2000 deals. 

We do have a few questions.

I would like to discuss what minimal impact is? How do you know what impact this will have? Is there a reason this will have little impact? Do all of these D2D deals have zero volume associated with them?
Who decided to do this?
Why are we doing this?
What time span are we talking (Production months/Year)
Let's determine the impact if any?

I would like to meet with you guys and get more detail on why we are doing this and determine the impact?

thanks,
m.m.

Jay,

If a deal is killed it poses a problem for us in Unify if there are any paths associated with the deal; therefore, we request the deals be zeroed out.  Call me if this is a problem.  Also, we would appreciate further details on why these deals are being killed.  

In addition, I have copied Rita and Mark from Volume Management for their input.

Regards,

Tammy

We will be killing about 2000 deals in Sitara tonight. Whenever a deal is touched in Sitara, it will bridge over to Unify. THese are Desk2Desk deals, and should have minimal impact on you.

The above referenced meters need to be placed on a K.  Please note the 
information below

98-6736  On 089 for 5/97 (activity @ this meter for 1/97 - 4/97 is on 
078-29165-101) the referenced CPR Deal # is 1567 which ends 4/97.
98-9638  On 089 for 6/97 (activity @ this meter for 1/97 - 11/97 is also on 
089) No referenced CPR Deal #.  The only month that has a K placed on it   is 
12/97 and that is on the 078-30100-103 K.

Thanks for your help.

Ken developed an industrial report before he left.  It can be found at

month of 2000.  I need you to update this for March.  This will need to be

Please take the initiative to get these things done.  I am counting on you 
and the others (Seniors in the group)
to get these things done.  We have 6 seniors in this group and I expect 
things to get accomplished.  I am not
a babysitter.  Lets get this job done or I will find people who want to get 
it done.  How about some team work

Subject: Unresolved Issues for Jan 1.- Followup

Here is a followup to the memo sent on 12/31/99.  FYI


Enron Field Services   -  Has not been nominated since September 99.  Have we 
stopped doing business on this pipe?  (Just an FYI - ?)  Do we need to get 
this assigned?  I can find old
   notes and try to get this pathed if necessary.  Someone just needs to let 
me know. Unresolved - appears to be unassigned?

Lavaca Expense Transport -  This is offsystem gas that HPLC Transports for 
ENA.  ENA has no nom at meter 1000 in Pops for Jan 1. Unresolved

MidCon Texas Pipeline   -  There were deals left unpathed for Jan 1 (and 
Dec?).  I brokered and nominated the obvious but we seem to have 10,000 with 
transport contract to move this    gas on and no sale to broker to.  As it 
stands, it looks like we have a long position.  Who is this assigned to?  I 
thought Carlos was handling this one, but I could    be wrong.  Unresolved

Channel Industries Pipeline  -  Several issues here:

 1. All Deals with the exception of the long term Transport Expense were left 
unpathed for Jan 1.  I viewed prior month transactions and pathed 
appropriately.  Someone
  needs to review for accuracy. Also, there were deals that went to zero, 
that were nominated for January.  Resolved but needs to be verified.

 2. We still do not have enough supply to meet our sales requirement.  This 
issue has been left unsresolved since October 99.  Volume Management cannot 
allocate was is
  not pathed and nominated.  Unresolved or Unpathed?

 3. There is a transaction for January that is once again not on our point 
specific transport contracts.  (Rec Mtr 1-6366 10,000 to Del Mtr 2-6203 
10,000).  This is a pathed pipeline. We have no rate.  We need to know the 
rate and whether one of the expense contracts needs to be amended for this 
transaction, we are not legally covered.  Carlos was handling this pipe in 
Dec.  Who is this assigned to for Jan? Unresolved

HPL Operational -  This Shipper on HPL has been left unpathed for December 
and January 1.  Who is this assigned to?  This can wait until we get back 
next week.  If it is left     unresolved, I will get it pathed when I return. 
I haven't had time to do this yet.  If we haven't figured out the assignement 
then I will get to it asap.

Deal #135714 was at this meter, but the contract tied to this deal expired at 
the end of August 2000.   Currently, these volumes are being booked to the 
HPL Strangers Gas Contract.  Logistics need either (1) Purchase Contract 
#96008903 tied to Deal #135714 extended, (2) new deal & contract, or (3) 
approval to write-off these volumes to Unaccounted for Gas.  (Please print, 
sign, and return original to Clem Cernosek).

Since we cannot fix the deal, go ahead and put a fixed price of $2.81359 on 
both lines of the May 2000 deal.  This will allow us to pay correctly.  If 
you can, please put some comments in the deal noting the true deal price so 
we have an audit trail.  Just let me know when it is done.

We have been looking at the daily volumes for the gathering contract to 
analyze the Producer Services portion of the P&L.  To do this, we have been 
looking at daily volumes on the 96026572 contract.  POPS shows a daily BAV of 
approximately 612,000.  MOPS shows a daily BAV of approximately 601,000.  I 
wanted to confirm that these volumes sound reasonable for you.  By the way, 
it also looks like the noms for the gathering contract are a lot higher, 
around 750,000 per day.

Please advise as to how you feel these BAv's come in compared to what you 
expect.  Thank you.

Darren,

I received another invoice for September production for Blue Dolphin.  Are we responsible for transportation fees for September and future production months?  Also, do the dehydration fees (MEI) apply to AEP as well? Currently, the August invoices have not been paid. If ENA Upstream is not responsible, let me know who/where I should forward the invoices.

Please follow the instructions below.

Why:  A suggestion was made (by Carlos) to centralize transport nominations 
we receive by email.  We now have an email account set up: 
HPL.Scheduling@enron.com.  The group is to let our customers know this is 
where all nominations need to be sent.  This way, if people are out (or no 
longer with us), someone will be able to receive the nomination change.  I 
have also created folders for each shipper.  As each nomination is addressed, 
the file is to be moved to the folder for later reference.  If the file is 
still in the "inbox", it has not been addressed.

Any comments to this, I would greatly appreaciate feedback.

 Hey Clem can you help us out with this one?  What are the volumes and deal 
tickets in question for those two days and what is the location?  We 
delivered to you at Centana and Enerfin.  Didn't we have that famous 
HPL/TETCO OBA already set up to handle the small volumes that are leftover 
after our deliveries to you?  Please let us know thanks!

Victor,

I didn't know that this was you!  I just snapped at the name.  What's up?

Here's the deal.  Enerfin has changed the OBA's effective date again.  It now 
is not effective until 12/2000.  Clem says that it's okay but we have to go 
back and change up previous months and have the OBA removed and show the 
effective date for 12/2000.  Clem is the point person on this. 

If need be, come on down and we'll talk.

Bye

Victor,

What's your opinion on this?  Can we go back and add days to prior month 
deals?  Do we use the same price?  If we do decide to do this, we will need 
to get TETCO to agree to do a retro for those days as well.

The above referenced days have been placed on strangers gas due to (I guess) 
the meter not being turned off in time.  The day prior to each of these days 
that are assessed to strangers gas, the only active K is the HPL 216.

Can these deals be rolled to cover these couple of days?

Subject: Meter 984132 for 1/16/99

Here is the issue for 1/16/99 at meter 984132.   

20,000 mmbtu were confirmed for Adonis in POPS.   10,000 mmbtu on day 5 and 
day 16.   Day 16 is not valid for deal 51862 (track id 6155), which is where 
10,000 was confirmed.   The  actual sale to Adonis was 10,000 which was 
invoiced and paid by Adonis.  We are trying to clear the feedback error 
report.   My question is why was 10,000 confirmed on 1/16/99 if the date is 
not valid for the deal?

When Karen allocates the actual 10,000 it is prorating 5,000 for each day 
that is confirmed (the 5th and 16th).  

Should the whole 10,000 be allocated to the 5th or should 5,000 be allocated 
to each day?   If 5,000 should be allocated to each day, the 16th needs to be 
added to the deal.

Daren - Meter 1591 has never flowed the entire nom.  This meter is has been 
over nominated.  It has had a nom of 1.000/day (429.000 total mmbtus) since 
1/28/99 and has flowed only 11.692.  Am I correct to say that this meter 
needs a lower nom?  Please let me know if I should look out for a lower nom 
in May.  Pat seems to think this may be affecting the P/L for April.  We only 
have estimates/actuals of zero on 4/1 & 4/2.  

Please let me know if this makes sense.

Aimee,
Please check meter #1591 Lamay gas lift.  It doesn't appear to have very much 
flow and the
BAV is showing the nom volume.  This could be adversely affecting the risk 
numbers.  Pat

Daren,

I know it's first of the month but the above meter has flow for 3/15 (71 
dec.) and 3/23 (35 dec.) but the deal (Sitara #213005) doesn't cover these 
two days.

Can you see if it is feasible to activate these two days in Sitara so that I 
can clear my exceptions for Volume Management?

Thanks

After comparing HPL's numbers with PG&E's numbers I have found a few 
discrepancies with the Tufco volumes.  
 
   HPL   PG&E

5/8   137.500   139.583

5/11   103.750   100.833

5/19   108.333   8.333

Days 8 and 11 have small discrepancies.  I got with Carlos on the 5/19 
discrepancy.  He checked the numbers sent to him by Tufco.  He verified that 
it should be 8.333.  I also checked with Steve in Gas Control regarding what 
flowed for Tufco.  Steve told me 8.300.  I have gone back into MOPS and 
corrected these volumes.   This should impact the UA4 number.  Also, this 
decreases the MidTexas cumulative imbalance.  As of 5/23 PG&E owes HPL 
4.649.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

Sherlyn,

Can you follow up on that deal we were looking at on Friday?  You had called and asked someone to release the deal so that it would show up in Path Manager or something to that effect.  I've looked in Sitara this morning and it doesn't look like it has been released or validated yet.

Thanks for your help.  Let me know if you need anything from me.

I noticed you both attributed hours to the ES002 Activity in the hours survey.  The system might not have prompted you to split out by percentages the commercial teams you supported perfoming that activity because I don't see it out there.  Will you please let know which commercial team you supported and the percentage - it looks like Tom Martin put 100% to Asset Trading but I'm not sure if it would be the same for the both of you.

Subject: HPL Meter #985892 South Katy Gas Unit No. 2 #1

Daren:

During the month of September and October 2000, gas flowed into HPL's 
pipeline at the above meter that is owned by Duke Energy Trading and 
Marketing, LLC.  Prior to September 2000, the gas was purchased under 
contract #960439646, and Deal #133196 that expired on 8/31/2000.  Effective 
11/1/2000, the gas was again purchased from Duke under Contract #96021934; 
Deal #466305, but this deal expires on 11/30/2000. 

Currently, Logistic has September and October 2000 volumes recorded to HPL 
Strangers Gas Contract.  In order to correct this, HPL Logistics needs either 
(1) Deals #133196 or #466305 extended to cover September and October 2000, 
(2) a new deal to cover September and October 2000, or (3) Logistics needs 
approval to write-off these volumes to Unaccounted for Gas Loss.  (Print, 
sign, and return the original to Clem Cernosek).


 ______________________________________________
 Deal/Deal Ticket#/Customer (Buyer/Seller)

    OR


 _________________________________________________________
 APPROVAL to Write-off the volumes to Unaccounted for Gas Loss


In addition,  since Deal #466305 expires on 11/30/2000 and gas is still 
flowing, Logistics needs either (1) Deal #466305 extended, or (2) a new deal 
to cover December 2000 and any other future months that this production is 
flowing into HPL's pipeline.

 New Deal #

Texas has a 42% increase Year to Year, a 22% increase Qtr. to Qtr. and a 30% 
increase Mo. to Mo.  The Yr. to Yr. and Qtr to Qtr increases can be explained 
by an increase in EOL transactions and Entex taking more gas.  The Mo. to Mo. 
increase is attributable to increase EOL transactions and TUFCO taking more 
gas.

It's that time again for the monthly and quarterly volumetric explanations!  
The database for May is now ready for viewing.  Just as a reminder, this is 
the shortcut on your desktop called "Statistical Database". 

As there is continued investor focus on our Wholesale Operations, Investor

Thanks Daren, I just found the answer this afternoon.  We paid Seagull.  
Ocean Energy bought Seagull, and Pam Boxx included this deal with her net to 
Seagull.  We just need to move the suspense amount.   Thanks.

I have no idea why payment would be suspended.  I don't remember having any

Daren, There are five HPLC purchase deals for 09/99 from Ocean Energy Inc.  
They were Craig Falbaum's deals.  A person who is no longer in my group 
suspended payment for these deals.  Gary suggested that I contact you and see 
if you have any insight as to why the deals might have been suspended, or 
know anything that might help.  Thanks.

On May 31,2000, the above meter flowed 15 Mmbtus from HPL's pipeline.  This 
is the only day that this meter flowed  during the period of 1/1/99 thru 
11/30/00.

Currently, the volume is booked to HPL Strangers Gas Contract.  Logistic 
needs approval to writeoff this volume to Unaccounted for Gas.  (Please 
print, sign, and return original to Clem Cernosek).

Daren,

Do you know if there should be a deal in place for Midcoast on this meter for 
January?  Currently, it only shows ENA.  I understand that a deal was added 
in December for Midcoast, but that deal was only good for Dec.

Thanks.

Mike

Daren,

I'm looking into this deal.   There is no volume on this deal for January 
00.     Should this deal have had some volume on it.
It was never scheduled with volume  however, in January it received flow of 
3461 due to ranking in POPS.  It was taken to zero once the actuals came in.

Please let me know if you intended to have volume on this deal for Jan 00

For days 4, 9, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17 and 28,  we are short at the aggregate 
meter.   Should the Reliant transport and Sales or do we charge Reliant a 
penalty?

Also, I notice that at meter 1554 we have 3rd party transport this month.  
This look strange because I've not seen them here before.

Please advice.

Thanks

FYI---I changed points on this deal from PGTT-TECO Waha 18002800 to PGTT-TECO 
Katy 20606100 for the 2nd.  Let me know if you don't agree with this.  The 
supply, Duke Field Svs, was originally trying to deliver to HPL at Midtex, 
this deal #589257 was also changed to meter 20606100.

Thanks,
Mark

Daren do you want to bump that volume up per the information in this note 
below.  George wanted to know and asked me.  It was previously nomed at 200. 
Let me know what you think and I'll make the change if needed.

George-

In this afternoon's meeting with Producer Services, Jill mentioned that the 
referenced well had been reperfed (meaning they shot more holes in the well 
piping allowing more gas to flow out of the well) and was now producing 
approximately 800/day.  Per Jill, the MDQ on this well is 3000/day.  You may 
want to look at getting this nom revised for the rest of the month.

Mary-  could you get Heidi or Lisa to check the transport rate we currently 
show on this?  It's being purchased for SC-.17 and is flowing through King 
Ranch.  

Thanks.

We invoiced Mirant Americas for deal 705989 and they do not see the deal in their system.  It was for 5,000/day from 4/1 - 4/2 at 5.10 on PG&E Texas.  Can you tell me who you did this deal with at Mirant?

You put a deal in for Torch for this time frame at this meter to clear an 
exception.  Should we put a new deal in with Cleco?  Let me know.

October.  If they are disputing the deal, please let me know and I will clear 
this up with them.

FYI - I've entered estimated vols into Sitara based on the following info 
from Mobil:

Jan 28 - their takes will be down by 15,000/d from current takes, due to one 
of their crude units coming down
Jan 29 - their takes will be down by an adiitional 5,000/d on top of that, 
due to their coker coming down

For Feb00, they estimated the following vols:

Feb 1 - 5 115,000/d
Feb 6 - 11 120,000/d
Feb 12 - 14 105,000/d
Feb 15 - 18 110,000/d
Feb 19 - 21 105,000/d
Feb 22 - 23 115,000/d
Feb 24 - 26 105,000/d
Feb 27 - 29 115,000/d

Based on assuming:
- Centana delivery point @ zero for all of Feb,
- high pressure delivery @ meter 1576 @ 15,000/d for all of Feb,
- EOG transport of 10,000/d @ meter 1040 for all of Feb,

.... I then entered the remaining daily vols for meter 1040.

    Mike:

    I have terminated about 12 to 13 inactive inter pipe/internal pools effective 12/01/01.  There are several  other inactive pools which I did not eliminate because 
    they had balances in it.
    I also spoke to Jim Tobacco at EPGT for at least an hour or so, going over every line item which was rejected, please get with me once you are back in the office
    and I will go over the "correct" pathing procedures.
    I met with Richard and reviewed November transactions for EPGT to determine if we could eliminate the External Pools but unfortunately we cannot do this.
    If we transport then we must use the External Pool.  However, you do not need to use internal pools but must use the imbalance pools which you are currently
    using, therefore, I have terminated the internal pools.
    Please review the changes and let me know if  this will work for you..
    I will be in touch with you after I meet with El Paso.

Gary,

Could you please remove  SCADA/MIPS from the following HPL meters. These 
meters are where Mid-Texas interconnects with
PG & E's system, and there should not be any measurement taking place on HPL. 
These meters were set up originally when we thought
that every meter on Mid-Texas should automatically have a corresponding meter 
on HPL. This assumption is now incorecct.

980388

980391
980392
980393
987271

If you assisted in the completion of the OPM Hours Survey in the past and/or 
are expected to in the future, you will need access to Microsoft Access 
beginning Wednesday, September 27, 2000.  If you do not have Microsoft 
Access, please go to the enron.itcentral.com website and complete an IT 
application request for Microsoft Access as soon as possible.

If you are not the individual who will be updating the hours surveys, please 
(1) coordinate with the individual who will and (2) notify Suzanne Nicholie 
at #57341.

On Wednesday, September 27, 2000 a new Hours Survey will be distributed to 
you and will be due for completion on Wednesday, October 4, 2000.

We have developed what we think to be an easier and more efficient method of 
handling the Hours Survey using Microsoft Access.  The Hours Survey is menu 
driven and you are not expected to need specific Microsoft Access training.

We will provide help lines and as needed direct training with the roll out of 
the new Hours Survey.  If you have any questions please contact anyone in the 
OPM group.

We need to revisit this issue again.   There is an exception at meter 4045 
for 2/99.   In order to clear this up, I need an ECT transport delivery at 
this meter for the 34000mmbtu.   See July's allocations in POPS for 
reference.    The displacement gas were scheduled as a delivery. 

I would like to have this issue resolved as soon as possible so that we 
could  clear this off our list.

Let me know if you have questions.

Thanks

Kim,

ECT sold 34,000mmbtu to PanEnergy at meter 4045 for 2/99.   I've verified w/ 
Rebekah Seales and she has determined that ECT did sell this gas to 
PanEnergy.  Therefore, we need to show a delivery at this meter for PanEnergy 
or whomever PanEnergy is selling this gas to at this point in POPS.  I need a 
delivery at this meter in order for this meter to balanced.  

Please take a look at this.  Call me if you have questions

Thanks.

Anita:

I did some additional research regarding the sale to PanEnergy at meter 4045 
on 2/27 and 2/28.  This sale was a brokered deal.



DATE   PURCHASE   VOLUME  SALE
2/27 & 2/28  Phillips Gas Mkt. (#55397)  10.000 MMBtu  PanEnergy Marketing 
(#64749) 10.000 MMBtu
2/27 & 2/28  Superior Natural Gas (#57065)   7.000 MMBtu  PanEnergy Marketing 
(#64749)   7.000 MMBtu

ECT did not transport this gas away from meter 4045.  If this gas was 
transported away from meter 4045, it would have been a transaction between 
PanEnergy Marketing (or whomever they sold the gas to at that point) and 
HPL.  Hope this information helps.

Additional info I see in Path Manager..................

Seems like this is a brokered deal, ECT is buying 20,000mmbtu from Philips 
Gas and 14,000mmbtu from Superior Gas and sell the total 34,000mmbtu to 
PanEnergy.

My question is then who is paying for the tranport of this gas, ECT or 
PanEnergy?  We need to schedule for the delivery of this gas at meter 984045.

Please let me know

Thanks

Per discussions that hopefully most of you have or will have with your 
respective managers, you have been selected to be a part of a team to address 
various issues associated with reconciling and clearing 1999 UA4.  The scope 
of the team will be to work as a team, on production months where the UA4 
number per our accounting systems is considerably larger in comparison to 
what the pipeline balancing reports has as unaccounted for.  This team will 
be dedicated fully to this effort and will need to be prepared to contribute 
whatever hours are needed to get the desired results.  Yvette will be 
locating a room that we can occupy for all of this week and next week.  This 
room will be a "war room".  Everyone is expected to report to the "war room" 
on a daily basis and should expect to be there unless something EXTREMELY 
pressing causes you to have to leave or people need to go back to their 
offices to retrieve data or information.  The expectations are that this 
group will work to identify any volume discrepancies, adjustments, etc. and 
be able to either correct or quantify those volumetric adjustments by no 
later than Mar. 24, 2000.  This team is effective as of tomorrow, Mar. 16, 
2000 at 9:00 a.m.  

Yvette- please try to locate a room by then and notify the above team members 
of the location.  In the case that you are not able to find a room right 
away, please have everyone go to Brenda's office in EB3748 at 9:00 a.m.

The items on the radar screen to address in resolving volume issues are:

1.  King Ranch
2.  Gulf Plains Plant
3.  Gulf Energy Imbalance
4.  Hanover Treaters
5.  South Texas Treaters
6.  Tejas Gas P/L Imbalance
7.  Channel A/S Line Unaccounted For
8.  Third party imbalances - MOPS vs. POPS

I received a call from CP&L about the February 2001 production invoice.  They are showing 5,000 mmbtu on February 21 for HPL.  We are not showing anything for HPL on that day.  Could you verify if this is correct?

Thanks for your help.

This amount, however, does not include the re-delivery fuel charges from PG& 
E that will be passed back to Pan Energy.  
As soon as we receive the information from PG& E, we will bill you 
accordingly.  

Thanks -Katherine (713) 345-8643

It started with  12,036 on the first and has slowly droped to 10,483 on the 
12th.  Pretty  steady drop.

Per authorization fromDaren Farmer, I have changed pipe code PGEV to PGTT.  The meter no. will remain the same.  The Rate Zone is PGTT and the Trade Zone is TUFCO.

Should you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Look thru the sequence history.  The Meter # on the opposite side did not change 
even though the pipe code did.  That is all I have to suggest.

I need to get the approval from Daren Farmer ext. 3-6905.  Please feel
free to contact him to discuss this matter.
Also, I do not believe the meter no. will be the same.  I searched PI
Grid and it shows HPL with DRN 92686 interconnect with meter no.
237-07-1-004, DRN 26879 for Teco Pipeline Co.
We have discrepencies/isssues.
What verifying information do you have for this meter?

This is a note to update you guys on the progress I'm making concerning 
cleaning-up and combining well-head deals...  So far, I have completed:

EOG:
Deal 126358 reflects 0 volumes on meter 6067 March 2000 forward
Deal 126281 reflects volumes on meter 6296 as well as volumes moved from 
sitara deal 126358; all volumes are at meter 6296

Forest:
Deal 132832 reflects 0 volumes March 2000 forward
Deal 139397 reflects the combined volumes from both deals on meter 6396

Suemaur:
Deal 138658 reflects 0 volumes March 2000 forward
Deal 138658 reflects the combined volumes from both deals on meter 9766


A similar effort will be made for: Saxet (deals 154608/138546); Comstock 
(deals 125827/125828/125899); and Costilla (deals 125783/125900)

Attached please find a schedule that shows all the active HPL Inter-Company 
Contracts that are recorded in the Global Contract System.  The dark shaded 
contracts are needed to perform HPL's daily/monthly activities.    Each of 
these have a comment.  

The lightly shaded contracts had activity in Year 2000, but  will not be 
needed for future activities.

The non- shaded contracts did not have any activity in Year 2000, and will 
not be needed for future activities.

This schedule was compiled by using information provided by Cheryl Dudley, 
Rita Wynne,  Daren Farmer, &   Clem's Expertise.

If you have any questions, please feel free to call any or all of us.





Thanks, Clem

Daren:

On 1/25/2000 the above meter has recorded flow of 18 Mmbtus into HPL's 
pipeline.  Currently, the volume is booked to HPL Strangers Gas Contract.   
Logistics needs approval to write-off this volume to Unaccounted for Gas.  
(Please print, sign, and return original to Clem Cernosek).



 ________________________________________________________________
 APPROVAL to Write-off the volumes to Unaccounted for Gas Loss

The above meter was a new meter effective 1/1/2000, and therefore, the volume 
flowing into HPL was probably caused by putting the meter in service.

Thanks, Clem

We don't have storage on PG&E do we?  I think that is park and lend.  What do you think?  I have put together the schedules for Spindletop and Bammel.

Has any progress been made on this?  So far, I have only received information on Cove Point.

We show that there is physical storage on the following pipelines:

TEXAS - Bammel, Centana, and PG&E Texas Pipeline.
WEST - Colorado, PG&E (one contract), PG&E Gas Transmission Northwest, Questar, and Williston
EAST - Cove Point, Dominion, Columbia Gas, Gulf South (Koch), National Fuel, Sonat, Tennessee, Transco, Egan, and Napoleonville.
SITHE - Union

Please provide the requested information below.

Thanks for your help in this matter.

Gas Accounting is initiating a project to ensure consistent treatment of physical storage between flash and the GL.  To that end, please provide the book codes and cost of inventory schedules that you have for each of the physical storage facilities.  We will also need what you show as the 1/31/01 inventory balance for each.

David, 
I believe that we already have the information for Bammel.  Please provide the info for other Texas desk storage, if any.  

I would like to have this information as soon as possible.

Thanks, everyone.

I'm not sure if you can help me, but I have a Danny Conner deal from Decemb=

We were buying gas from The Houston Exploration Company on Black Marlin, Hi=

.14.  In December, a new platform came on, High Island 115/HPL meter 986431=

ration thinks that the gas at HI 115 should be kept separate and priced at =
HSC GD - 0.14 since it did not begin flowing until the 20th.  We agree that=
 we received the gas.  We have the pipeline statement from Black Marlin.  W=

It seems to me that there have been several issues recently involving data 
feeds from measurement.  Regardless of the issue, you all seem to express the 
same concern:  a lack of accountability, no sense of urgency.....

I brought this up in Brian's staff meeting yesterday, in hopes to get some 
ideas on where to go to get some results.  Rita, I understaood from you that 
Gary has returned your call and you are setting a meeting for later this 
week.  Please include me in the meeting.  If we don't get what we need, it 
was recommended that I talk with Ellis Sturn.  If that doesn't work, Brian 
will talk with Rod Hayslett.  Rita:  Prior to the meeting, would you please 
coordinate the meeting and agenda, consolidating all issues/concerns?  Yvette 
can set the meeting.

Aimee,
Please check meter #1591 Lamay gas lift.  It doesn't appear to have very much 
flow and the
BAV is showing the nom volume.  This could be adversely affecting the risk 
numbers.  Pat

Attached is an updated transitions list.

Please review and send any changes so I can update.

I will update again Thursday and will include a column for status.

We are in the process of drafting procedures which will have to become a formal protocol for AEP.

These are:

Request for New/maintenance of counterparties.  Once Web page is developed, procedures will
be completed.

Request for new portfolios (books) after close.  Drafting procedures.

Request for new employee security.

Request to change curve mapping in ERMS/CPS.  Drafting procedures.

Also, it appears the IT service agreement may have to be amended to cover the 
Web pages used to push operational data to customers (If AEP wants to continue
the service) and the Tariff filing system we just put into production.

Also, we will need to resolve how we handle counterparties that Enron credit has request we suspend trading when
AEP wants to continue trading.

We have had discussions with AEP about all of these issues and procedures.

Kim/Anita-

A volume of 7247mm shows to have been allocated to the Reliant 201 contract 
for November.  There was no nomination for Reliant at this point in November 
and, therefore, there should be no volume allocated to their contract.  
Please make sure these volumes are moved off the Reliant contract prior to 
November close.

Thanks.

Hey Daren,

We're back on this issue again.  There is gas out there for days 1-3 and 6-20 
but the deal is only good for 21-31. 

Can you assist Anita and I w/a deal number to place the 1st 20 days on.  
Anita is attempting to close this issue.

As usual, thanks for your help.

Daren,

The above mentioned meter is on stranger's for the entire month of Jan. 
2000.  There is a deal ticket applicable to this meter from Jan. 21st thru 
the 31st.  Is it o.k. for Volume Management to apply volumes from the 21st 
thru the 31st to the 215?

I don't know what kind of issues was associated with this deal.

Thanks

Jackie,
I see that the gas at this meter is allocated to "stranger's" in POPS.   
Stephanie Gomes in Settlement thinks that this could be Encina's gas.  I see 
in Sitara that deal 152638 is only valid from the 21st - 31st.   Can you 
please take a look.

Hey Anita,
For meter # 0986725, 1/00 production, I am showing per meter statement that 
41,671mmbtu flowed.  Is that gas really Encina's.  Has the volume just not 
been allocated yet.  Could you let me know  what the deal is on the meter.

Darren:
Here is my problem.  As you know, HPLC did a deal with Texas General Land O=
ffice where we would exchange gas for crude.  The problem was HPLC was sell=
ing the gas and Enron Gas Marketing was receiving the crude.  Bryce Baxter =
worked out a series of intercompany deals between HPLC, ENA and EGM that wo=
uld book the deal correctly.  Julie Meyers was told how to create the deals=
 and she completed January and February, except for one small part, but Mar=
ch forward was never completed.  The attached word document explains the pr=
ocedure.  Basically, we were suppose to book an HPLC sale to the TGLO with =
volume and zero price.  This would book the volume to the GL and zero out t=
he receivable since we were never going to receive cash from TGLO.  Then, w=
e would book a sale from HPLC-Wellhead to ENA-Wellhead for the value of the=
 gas only (no volume) and a sale from ENA-Wellhead to EGM for the value of =
the crude (no volume).  For these deals, we would use demand fees. EGM will=
 pay ENA for the crude dollars.

  =20

I will give you the deals for January so you can see how the dollars move. =
 You will see that the price is still on the sale from HPLC to TGLO.  Julie=
 zeroed this out, but O'Neal put it back.  I've left him a message to find =
out why.
1.  Sale from HPLC-IM Wellhead to TGLO=09=09=09547201
2.  Sale from HPLC-IM HPLC to HPLC-IM Wellhead=09=09547205 =20
3.  Sale from HPLC-Wellhead to ENA-IM Wellhead Texas=09679847
4.  Sale from ENA-IM Wellhead Texas to EGM=09=09=09679859=20

Here is a preliminary list of what needs to be done to finish out the trans=
actions for March, April and May.  The previous email went to Kam Keiser, J=
ohn Grass, Linda Roberts and Dayem Khandker.  They may be able to help us w=
ork through this.  Let me know if you have any questions.

1.  Zero out the prices on the HPLC sales to Texas General Land Office, lea=
ve volume only.
=09Jan 2001=09547201=09
=09Feb 2001=09591307
=09March 2001=09640685
=09April 2001=09692167
=09May 2001=09755787
2.  Enter a ticket for the HPL-Wellhead sale to ENA-Wellhead for March, Apr=
il and May 2001 (the Feb deal number is 679848) for the value of the gas be=
low.  This should be entered as a demand fee only, no volume.
=09March 2001=09$774,612.50
=09April 2001=09$705,870.00
=09May 2001=09$664,609.00
=09
3.  Enter a ticket for the sale from ENA-Wellhead to EGM for the value of t=
he crude below.  There is an existing ticket for Jan and Feb that can be ex=
tended, deal 679859.
=09March 2001=09$757,603.93
=09April 2001=09$820,983.94
=09May 2001=09$598,885.13

4.  Update Jan and Feb crude values on deal 679859
=09Jan 2001=09change $886,638.63 to $886,015.18
=09Feb 2001=09change $839,008.31 to $842,475.06

Daren:

I'll follow-up on this, but I'm sure you know it isn't a very likely story.  
I'll be in Saudi this Friday, so if Mr. Maldonado has any leads there I can 
check'em out.

Please say hi to Doug and tell him we're getting a little closer to that gas 
pipeline to displace liquids on the Saudi west coast.

Regards,

Samir

Rob, 

I got your name from Doug Leach.  He  thought that you would be the person to 
talk to about this.

I got a call last night from Rudolph Maldonado.  (The operator forwarded him 
our way.)  He stated that he has some natural gas to sell in Saudi Arabia.  
His number is 562-866-1755.  Could you give him a call and check this out?  I 
told him that I would find someone that he could discuss this with.

I can be reached at 3-6905 if you have any questions.

Daren Farmer

Danny--

It looks like deal 133196 (purchase from Duke) at meter 5892 South Katy Gas 
Unit#2 needs to be renegotiated.  The deal expired 8/31/00, and they are 
allocating the gas to us for September.  Let me know as soon as you can so we 
can make sure the gas is allocated correctly for September, and so it can set 
it up for October if need be.

Thanks,
Mark

I spoke with Daren Farmer re: deal 133196 that expired 8/31/00 at meter 
985892, and he said the deal needs to be renegotiated in order for us to 
agree to buy that gas that is being allocated to us (volume of 4,098 MMBtu 
for Sept on gathering contract).  Unfortunately, Danny Conner handles this 
deal and he is out this week.  Daren said to wait until he gets back next 
week before we do anything with it.  

Thanks,
Mark

At this time I would like to keep it at 40.0/day.  We will work on trying to
take payback.  If the nominations to TGP go down from Transco at Starks then
TGP can easily take more from CIG at Sabine.

Friday 3/23 - Received a page from Silver in Gas Control at 8:00 pm regarding the Gulf Plains Plant.  They were cut into another pipeline (Tennessee), and wanted to overdeliver to us by 10M for the night.  Larry Zammit paged 8:05 pm, reiterated same.  We agreed to take the additional volume for the remainder of the evening only.

Saturday 3/24 - 7:30 am, received page from Lee in Gas Control regarding the Gulf Plains Plant, apparently they felt that they may need to overdeliver for Saturday's gas day as well.  Phoned Larry Zammit and spoke with him regarding the situation at the plant, he indicated that there may have been a miscommunication or misunderstanding at the plant.  Larry phoned the plant and made sure that they were on board to keep us balanced and not overdeliver to,  or swing on, HPL.

	2:00 pm - Phoned Lee in Gas Control to see how the pipeline was doing.  He indicated that we were pretty tight, but would probably make it without utilizing any OBA's.

Sunday - So. Union requested 15M beginning at 11:00 am. The pipeline was tight again, but Gas Control was okay.

Jay,

For June, I need a couple of things changed in Sitara: 
Deal 819592 - the commodity price needs to be 3.6318
Deal 819594 - the commodity price needs to be WAHA.HUB.GDP.D.A+.02

And for July............
It looks like we're missing some volume............
Deal 895651 - baseload deal - should have 55,000 per day allocated. AND in Sitara this deal should be priced at $3.0505.
Deal 895691 - swing deal - currently has 234,000 in the scheduled column and it should be 441,000 based on the spreadsheet I sent. Did you have some conflicting volumes? I'm resending what the volumes should be. AND the pricing for this should be at WAHA.HUB.GDP.D.A+.02.

 

I think that should do if for now. I'll wait to see how these changes come across. Please notify me when these changes have been made. Thanks!

Valerie,

In reference to a note sent to Darren Farmer:  Houston Pipleline mistake on June 18th

The volume of 50,000 for deal 819594 was a mistake.  The proper value was 30,000 just as you had mentioned.   Everything should now be fixed.  Please let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks, 
Jay Smith

Daren, There are five HPLC purchase deals for 09/99 from Ocean Energy Inc.  
They were Craig Falbaum's deals.  A person who is no longer in my group 
suspended payment for these deals.  Gary suggested that I contact you and see 
if you have any insight as to why the deals might have been suspended, or 
know anything that might help.  Thanks.

Daren - was there a deal for 5.000 at CP&L on Feb. 21?  CP&L shows 5.000, but I have looked in MOPS and there is not a deal.  Can you verify whether or not there was a deal for that day?  Thanks.

I received a call from CP&L about the February 2001 production invoice.  They are showing 5,000 mmbtu on February 21 for HPL.  We are not showing anything for HPL on that day.  Could you verify if this is correct?

Thanks for your help.

Coastal plans to bring up the Monte Cristo (meter 9873) today.  HPL is buying 
the residue (net 15% pvr) at Stratton effective today (vol. of 34M).  This 
gas is to be transported by HPL to the inlet (meter 980415) and may or may 
not be repurchased at the tailgate.  At this time, this gas is scheduled on 
the Strangers IT agmt., we are waiting for Brian Riley to return to the 
office so that we can determine if this will need to be placed on a separate 
transport agreement to the plant inlet, or added to the old agreement.  I 
will try to keep everyone  apprised to the extent that I am in the loop.

This is one of the deals which you told me to zero out.  Unfortunately, I do 
not allocate PGEV.  Also,  Sherlyn has actualized PGEV and she has the 
support from the pipeline for the 1746918 volume.  Please let me know if I 
had missed something in our conversation.  Thanks

Jackie, Talk to Darren about this. The deal you reference is an HPL deal with 
Dynegy and I don't have access to it. I'm on the East desk. Yesterday I 
extended the deal 421415 for the 6th and 19th and Meredith inserted a path in 
Unify - TETCO  to cover the small overflow volume between HPL and ENA. The 
ENA/HPL piece is done. The piece between HPL and Dynegy is what you need 
inserted.THANKS

Victor, can you extend the deal 422516 for days 6 and 9 please?  Thanks.  Oh 
and by the way, I had mistaken you for someone else when I sent you the

I don't want to tell you to add any contracts, because I am not sure about 
that.   I am just saying if you look at Ray's schedule there are 2 deals out 
there, one is a purchase from ENA and the other a purchase from Dynegy.  The 
track id I gave you was for ENA.   You  cannot allocate the Dynegy piece 
until I give you a track id.   I cannot give you a track id until the deal is 
extended for days 10/6 and 10/19.

Jackie,
You did not allocate this according to Ray's schedule.  The track id I gave 
you was only for the purchase from ENA.   You need to extend the deal for the 
purchase from Dynegy.   You put all of the volume on these 2 days on ENA, 
that is not what is on Ray's schedule, so we are still out on the 
interconnect report.

Jackie,

Your allocation is correct with the exception of days 10/6 and 10/19 where 
strangers gas is allocated.    I have created an accounting arrangement for 
these days and the new track id for ENA is 240384.  Please allocate the ENA 
portion according to Rays schedule for these 2 days.    Deal 422516 (Purchase 
from Dynegy) needs to be extended for these 2 days so I can do an accounting 
arrangement.   Alfonso  I need for you to allocate your meter daily, because 
we have tiered pricing this month.

Thanks.

During the period of 5/1/2000 through 5/31/2000, the above meter has recorded 
flow on the following days:

 Days    Mmbtus

 5/1/2000             942
 5/3/2000               68
 5/21/2000               65

           1,075

Deal #119068 was at this meter during April 2000 and again began 6/13/2000, 
but did not exist from 5/1/2000 through 6/12/2000.  Currently, these volumes 
are being booked under the HPL Strangers Gas Contract.  Logistics needs 
either (1) Deal #119068 extended, (2) New Deal, or (3) approval to write-off 
these volumes to Unaccounted for Gas.  (Please print, sign, and return 
original to Clem Cernosek).

Sitara 147092 is tiered pricing. If you want, you can nom whatever volume is 
on the deal ticket and the economics will work out correctly. It will keep 
things in balance a bit better, but you can go either way. For Feb there is a 
base deal for 5000/day and a term deal for 20,000/day. Only 15,000 of the 
20000 is pathed.

Subject: Teco's Indian Spring Plant

A meeting was held on November 1, 2000 at 3 pm in EB3270 to resolve Exxon's 
residue volume issue at Teco's Indian Spring Plant.   Exxon's issue is that 
the residue volumes that HPL is recording for Exxon's account for 
transportation do not equal to the wellhead volumes produced and delivered to 
PGE.   

Items that were identified so that Exxon's Issue could be resolved:

 1.  HPL is responsible for any UA4 loss/gain and fuel consumed on PGE's line 
attributable to Exxon's Big Sandy production.
 2.  If Exxon's production exceeds 500 mcf/d, HPL must on a monthly basis 
elect to process or not process the Exxon Big Sandy Gas.  If HPL elects 
to       process, then Teco buys the products from HPL.
 3.  If Exxon's production flows between 100 Mcf/d and 499 Mcf/d, then Teco 
can process and makeup the shrinkage to HPL with their own gas volumes. 
 4.  If Exxon's production is less than 100 Mcf/d, then HPL must terminate 
the Processing Agreement.  If HPL does not terminate and volume continue 
to        flow at less that 100 Mcf/d than HPL loses the shrinkage and must 
pay to Teco an additional $500 per month.

Solution:
 1.  HPL will schedule and record the Gain/Loss Volumes at HPL Meter #986884 
that is attributable to UA4 and Fuel on the PGE line.
 2.  HPL will schedule and record the sale volumes of PVR to Teco at HPL 
Meter #986884. 
 3.  The scheduling of the volumes for items  1 and 2 will allow for offset 
volumes to be record as adjustments to Exxon's transport volumes.
 4.  The HPL Logistics dept. (Mary Poorman) will inform Assets Group (Jack 
Simunek) when and if the volumes nominated for Exxon fall below 100 Mcf/d.

If any of the above does not reflect what was discussed or agreed to, please 
let me know at X-36650.

Thanks, Clem

Steps 2 - 4 have been done.

Mary, since Jackie is out tomorrow, you will need to verify the following 
information has flowed across to POPS tomorrow morning (check meter catalog).

Meter           Facility                         DRN

986892        515136                       60217
980439        501026                       286715

If there is a problem, then you will need to get with Romeo.

If everything is okay, you will need to let Sherlyn know so she can set up 
accounting arrangements on meter 439 and you will need to enter them into 
POPS.

Clem,

I have completed setting the confirm = 0 for 986892 and reallocated
all the days. They are all zero now, however 10/4/2000 and 10/5/2000
still have a non-zero BAV, these should get set to 0 by 10/6. Since
allocation will not allocate these days till 10/6 gas date.

Subject: Tetco/HPL (Enerfin) Meter #986892

Step I.

Romeo:   Please do Step 1 today, 10/4/00.

1.  Please change the confirmed noms to zero for all contracts that have be 
nominated for period 1/1/00 thru 10/31/00 for the above meter.
2.  Change the allocation method to "Not Allocatable" effective 1/1/99.
3.  Please reallocate the meter for period 1/1/99 thru 10/31/00.
4.  Call me after the above tasks have been completed.

Step  II.

Sherlyn:  Please check the following tommorrow, 10/5/00.

1   Verify with Settlements that the zero BAV adjustment were received  for 
all Contract Activities at Meter 986892 for period 1/1/99 thru 9/30/00.
2.  After verification is complete, please call me.

Step III.

Donna:  I will call you tomorrow, 10/5/00 to inform when you can make the 
following changes:

1.  Change the meter # and DRN # at Facility # 501026.  This facility should 
be Trade and Nom "YES".
2.  Change the meter # and DRN # at Facility # 515136.  This facility should 
be Trade and Nom "No".
3.  After completion, please call me as well as Romeo (x-34544).

Step IV.

Romeo:   Upon receiving a call from Donna:

1.  Please make the appropriate changes or corrections in POPs System for the 
Facility Changes made by Global Facilities Dept.  My understanding is that 
these changes can not be done automatically.
2.  Upon completion, please call me.

Step V.

Jackie:

1.  Tomorrow, 10/05 /00, after I am informed that Romeo has made his changes, 
I will let you know and you may begin scheduling Meter #0980439 which is the 
meter replacing #0986892.
2.  After completion, please let me know.

********

Gary:

This could create some problems for Gas Control, because all confirmed 
volumes will be zeroed including October, 2000 activities at meter 986892  
today (10/4/00).   This should correct itself within 24 thru 48 hours at 
meter #980439.

Daren:

This could also create some issues for you, but remember, these issues should 
clear within 24 to 48 hours.

Victor:

This is just for your information, since this should not create and changes 
for you.



IF ANYONE HAS ANY QUESTIONS, PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CALL ME AT X-3665O.

Subject: Interconnect / Intercompany issues

Below is a list of the major items that are still outstanding on the 
interdesk/interconnect report for 1999 and 2000 that is impacting the 
intercompany cleanup for SAP implementation.  These issues have been 
addressed in earlier E-Mails and this is an updated list of issues that need 
to be completed by June 19, 2000.


1) King Ranch interstates - Fred and Stella are working with Exxon to 
reconcile from Oct 1999 - Apr 2000 the interstate nominations for Tennessee 
and NGPL and also for Tejas.
                             
2) Tetco Meter 6892 -  Question of who has custody transfer at the meter.  
ENA is using Tetco's  volume and HPLC is using the HPL Measurement volume, 
causing a desk to desk variance.
                                            Clem and Pat are working on.

3) Transco Bammel  Meter 74 - Transco and HPL's nominations are out of 
balance at Meter 74. Charlotte needs to work with Transco to resolve.

4) Dow  Meter 4486 - The sale to Entex needs to be taken off of HPLC meter 
4486 and the sale needs to be at Dow Meter 4486.  
                                          A desk to desk between ENA (buyer) 
and HPLC (seller) needs to be set up on Dow Meter 4486.
                                          Ami needs to set up the deals and 
Thu needs to coordinate the months involved.

                                          Once this is done and Thu 
reallocates to Dow Pipeline, Jackie needs to zero out the confirmed noms and 
make the meter non allocatable in Pops.
                                          Clem verified with Steve Schneider 
that this meter is not on HPL's system.

5) East Texas Gas / Devon     - Devon invoicing ENA entire flow at Carthage.
     Meter 4607701                           East Texas keeping HPLC whole on 
nominations
                                                             Desk to desk 
deal is out of balance because of this 
                                                             Karen is working 
with Pennzoil and East Texas to reach agreement on how to handle this issue 
between them
          

6) PGEV -  Actuals on swing meters (HPL ) not matching expense volumes being 
allocated by PGEV.  
                    Sherlyn is working with Stacey and Charlotte to resolve.

7) Pan Energy Sales issues - discrepancies on PGEV.  Katherine and Sherlyn 
are working with Stacey  to resolve.

Rita, Please help me with this. I have some questions regarding Enerfin.
Why are we re-allocating prior month volumes at Enerfin after we matched your 
original numbers back in October? Can't this be fixed in the actualization 
process?  
The numbers for October between ENA-TETCO and HPL vary a good bit.  Are we 
your only customer at that point and why do we show volumes on days ENA had 
no transactions with HPL?  Can we simply put zero paths in UNIFY and extend 
our existing deals in Sitara with zero volumes and have you guys actualize 
these small volumes to handle this?  We go round and round at this point 
changing volumes two, three or more times. Call me if you have questions..  
Thanks Victor

Subject: Re: HPL discrepancy  

Victor,

The sitara ticket that we were using for the month of October is #421415.  
TETCO shows that the volumes that HPL was allocated on October 6th and 
October 19th, were 9 dths and 44 dths, respectively.  Those volumes were 
pulled off of our backhaul contract because there was no nomination in 
place.  This is the same problem that we have had over and over with them.  
Also, we just found out on Tuesday, that the OBA did not go into effect until 
December 1, 2000.  We were originally told that they were putting the OBA in 
effect retroactively to November of 1999.  In fact, I thought that HPL had 
made a lot of retroactive changes in the system to adjust for the OBA, do you 
remember that?  HPL told us that Ray Calles at TETCO is the one who decided 
that the OBA would not be effective until December of 2000.  Nobody even 
informed us of this change, I stumbled upon it when researching a November 
issue for Alfonso Trabulsi and Brenda Fletcher.  In addition to all of this, 
I received another email, which I will copy below, asking me to go in for the 
month of October and adjust all of my estimated volumes in Unify to match 
what HPL shows that we were allocated.  I had been going in all month long 
and matching to their numbers, and we were clean for the deadline at the end 
of the month.  I ran the allocation report from TETCO for the month of 
October, and some of HPL's numbers were very different from TETCO's, 
including the two days that I mentioned above.  I sent Jackie Young an email 
back showing her TETCO's numbers and I haven't received a response.  I will 
copy that email below as well, just to catch you up on what's been going on.

Subject: October Volumes

Hi Jackie,

I ran a report from TETCO's system to show the volumes that Enron was 
allocated for the month of October, and some of the volumes are very 
different from the volumes that you show.  I copied your numbers below and 
copied TETCO's volumes below that (with the disrepancies in red).  I was 
wondering if you could double check the 3rd, 4th, 11th, 12th, 25th, and 27th 
to see if you had purchases on those days from a counterparty other than 
Enron North America at that meter.  It looks like maybe the volumes that you 
show are the total flow at that meter, but I think that only part of the gas 
was actually allocated to us.  I don't mind putting the allocated volumes in 
path manager, but I'd like to make sure that on the above days, I am only 
putting in the amount that Enron was allocated.   

Also, on the 6th and the 19th TETCO shows exactly half of what you show, 
which I thought was kind of strange.  I am going to have to get TETCO's 
permission to do a retroactive nomination for those two days at the volumes 
you have requested, before I can put anything in Sitara or Unify.  My manager 
is out of the office and will be back tomorrow, but I would like for him to 
double check the deal that we will have to create in Sitara for those two 
days, since we are dealing with a prior month issue.

Stephanie,

The problem with the January payment is that the deal is set up incorrectly 
in sitara.   For January production deal 153864 shows HPLC purchasing gas 
from GMT Company Inc, not GMT Inc.  Someone needs to either correct the deal 
for 1/00 or put in a new deal, then I can do an accounting arrangement to 
make the necessary correction.    It is correct for 2/00 on deal 156292.  I 
emailed Daren on this because I see his name in sitara as the contact, but I 
am not sure who actually takes care of it.

Thu,
I'm not sure if this is your meter or not.  If it is not, could you please 
pass this email on to the correct person.
For meter # 9814, Jan. 2000 production, the volume was allocated to the wrong 
company.  The gas was allocated to GMT Company Inc., but it should have been
allocated to GMT, Inc.  For Feb. 2000 it is done correctly.
I need to recoup the money from GMT Company, so could you please let me know 
when the change has been made in the system.
Thanks for your help.

Stephanie ( 3-6004 )

Nick, it appears that we paid GMT Company, Inc. (BA 01474) of Corpus Christi 
instead of GMT, Inc. (BA 75046) of Houston.  These companies are not 
related.  We should pay the Houston GMT for production at meter 098-9814.  
Would you please make the necessary adjustments?  Thanks.

I was looking in Unify for last month and this invoice was finalled under the 
GMT Company Inc for 15975 mmbtu at meter 0989814.  The check was sent to 
their Corpus Christi address.  The Sitara# was 153864.  The Sitara # you gave 
me is showing February as the beginning month with GMT, Inc. as the payee.  
Do you know if these are different companies?

Cindy, GMT has advised Brian that they have not yet received payment for 
production at meter 098-9814 for the period from 1/14/2000 to 1/31/2000.  
Would you look into this and have them paid as promptly as possible?  It 
appears that the January deal was 156292 and I believe GMT produced 15,984 
Mmbtu in January.

to the gas quality issue early on?

Although the gas is non-spec, the volumes and gas total inerts are low enough 
that it can be blended okay before reaching Beaumont.  GO FOR IT.

As a precaution, we are starting a trend and I want to be very cautious.  
Once we connect a well, we can't go backwards.  Please be specific with GMT 
and limit him to this one well.  Otherwise he could drill more wells and flow 
them ALL through this new meter.

Attached is a file with my allocations of Texas Operations to be used for the 
2000 Plan.  However, please note that their are some problems/clean-up that 
needs to occur that I could not do.

As you requested, I have taken the % we allocated to Gas Assets last year and 
put the appropriate %'s into the appropriate group within Gas Assets as you 
have broken them out.  Please note:  Gas Network Trading is the same group as 
ST GasTexas (group 8) - Tom Martin is responsible for both.  I have indicated 
the appropriate %'s into the NEW buckets, but I was not able to ZERO out the 
ST GasTexas group as the cells are protected.  Consequently, the TOTAL column 
indicates that I have allocated over 100%.  The #'s in Gas Network Trading 
are correct.  Will you please delete ST GasTexas so that no one will allocate 
to it?
When the plan allocations were submitted last year, there was an error in 
RC1160 - Volume Management.  I thought we corrected it but it is still 
showing up incorrectly.  Please move the 8% under East Origin to ST GasEast.  
I was not able to correct this either as the cells have been protected.  
Please note:  This is not a change from the plan, but a correction of an 
error. 

I would appreciate you correcting these things for me, and forwarding the 
corrected version back to me for my records.  I will be working with our 
management team on the 1/00 allocations, and will provide you those by 
Friday.  Please call me if you have any questions.  Thanks.


MANAGEMENT TEAM:  Please review, and work on how we should be allocated for 
1/00.  We have changes for Denver business, Project Sally, NewCo, etc.  We 
will discuss in the staff meeting on Tuesday, 1/18.

Cindy,   I need to get a list of the people who are going to need FERC 
training for the ENA group.
GPG has sent me a list of people to train but nothing has been planned or 
confirmed.
I would like to schedule the training for the 3rd week of August after the 
July close.  I am planning to train the view role
from the production data translated by the module for july.  If we can get a 
head count then I can tentatively book
the rooms and equipment to do the training for August.
Thanks
Duane

Pat Dresner (accountant) at Midcon Texas says she does not show these deals 
in her system and she can not pay on them.  You created the deals in Sitara 
and I don't have another trader's name.  Could you please talk to your KN 
trader regarding this situation?  If Midcon really got this gas, then someone 
at KN should tell their accountant about the deal.

Prod Mo. Entity     Point  Volume  Total Amount  Sitara #

Please let me know as soon as possible what you find out.  The 2/2000

Janet- 

Per Southern Union's confirmation sheet, the 15,000 mmbtus spot deal on days 03/25 & 3/26 should be priced at  HSC GDP DA +.05 ( at Tuesday, 3/27/01 pricing- which was $ 5.235). Currently, Sitara is showing a price of  HSC GDP +.05.

 Is this Tuesday pricing correct?  If so, pls forward this to Daren so that he can change the price in Sitara to $ 5.235 +.05 ( Totaling $5.285).


Thanks- Katherine

I'm not sure what's going on, but I DID NOT see a TECO  deal ticket in MOPS 
for Houston Pipeline Company anywhere (January 1999 to March 1999).  I DID 
see one on Houston Pipeline Company Resources.

As my original note stated, I think this is a buy/sell which means that TECO 
Gas Processing should appear in both the Market and Supply depending on 
HPLC's position.

Please let me know something ASAP.

Mary, this is the message I left a voice mail concerning.  In addition to the 
other producer at this meter, the following needs to be setup:

POPS HPLC transport delivery  12-41500-203 done (there)
MOPS HPLC sale to Teco GP  12-86978-101 NEEDED (think this is buy/sell 
arrangement); no deal ticket.

Gary Lamphier is looking into the Exxon Jack Creek receipt flow at meter 6884 
- make final determination on whether it's either HPLR or HPLC.  The deal 
setup in POPS and MOPS as HPLR.

Summary:
Need HPLC sale to TECO related to transportation  delivery in POPS.
Final determination on whether the current HPLR purchase from TECO at Exxon 
Jack Creek is correct or should HPLC be purchasing from TECO - starting in 
February 1999 business.

Thanks for you help,  3-9768

Melissa's second sentence refers to the Teco Gas Processing Company 12/1/98 
contract covering meters 6884 and 419.  This contract was obtained in 
connection with the Seven Oaks/Turpentine Lease Line renewal, and it doesn't 
appear to have hit the system.  Please ensure that the contract is set up and 
filed.

George, 

At the 9th WorkDay meeting you had asked if we had seen the paper on the 
above referenced.  I have checked our database, and it appears that we have 
not.  The contract in the system does reflect at GS at this point. 

I also checked on Teco Gas Processing Company, and it does not appear we have 
seen the paper on this one either. 

Thank you, 
Melissa

Tom,

The Doehrman #1 well came on line for first delivery on Monday, 2/7/00 at 
11:45am.  The contract calls for intra-month pricing for deliveries that 
commence after the first day of the month.  Please create a one month 
baseload firm deal ticket for the remaining days of the month based on the 
following information:



Counterparty    Meter   Volume   Price

Union Gas Operating Company  9825   500mmbtu/d   100% Gas Daily less $0.10


Susan will create a committed reserves firm ticket for the remaining term of 
the deal once our geologists have gathered enough data to forecast the 
reserves of this well; at such time, we will request that this ticket be 
zeroed out.

If you have any questions or concerns, please give me a call.

Thanks,

vlt

We had flow on the first, prior to the shut in for work.  I need a deal to 
pick up the 500 and change that squeaked through the meter, please.  My 
exceptions need to be cleared pretty quickly.

Bob,

I wanted to just follow up with you about what we had discussed a couple 
weeks ago.  We had briefly touched on the possibility of me rotating down 
with Daren and working the off system scheduling.

I was talking with Daren last night and he had not heard anything about 
this.  I plan to begin working with Mark and Mary next week to learn how to 
schedule these pipes.  Before we begin this, I just wanted to make sure that 
what we had discussed is still planned.

Thanks for your time.

Mike

I'm trying to get this to pull through to Unify for payment to Spinnaker. Volume Management shows "no detail".
Sitara indicated  685 mmbut 4/1-4/30 expected.
Who needs to talk to who to get this fixed.
Payment MUST be set up by noon 5/24/01 for prompt payment to Spinnaker.
Thank you and Please advise.

I received the above allocation for this deal where there is a purchase from Spinnaker and a sale to Dow.  The volumes have not be actualized so there is nothing in Volume Management.  Can one of you look into this and get back to me.

I phoned Jackie Morgan to request that the aforementioned meter be added for

She wasn't in, at the time.  So, when she returns my call, I'll apprise you

Scotty/Richard,

Our DBAs would like to see what we can do to reduce the qty of rows in 
Contract_Event_Status.  We have over 1 Gig of data in that table.  I would 
like to suggest we have a nightly or weekly or monthly process to delete any 
row with a Last_Mod_Date over a month (or two) old.  So if someone balances 
February 1999 this month, we will keep it around for a month (or two).

Does any one else have a desire to keep this data for a shorter/longer period 
of time?

This is not an audit table.  This is just a "log" every nom/track/balance/EDI 
send/Fax send/sched qty/quick response since the beginning of time.

d.n.

Daren,

When I look back in CPR for the delivery periods of 10/00 - 12/00 on CPR Pipeline Exchange, I do not see anything being flashed as an imbalance, i.e. the buys and sales always equal in CPR.  However, we are booking an imbalance every month on the parking and lending contract.  Should there be something in CPR for these volumes?  Let me know because it is causing an OA variance for us.  Thanks!

 On 5/10/00 a pipeline leak was found on system 550.  By the evidence found 
it is believed to have been present for several months. We need to go back to 
at least January '00 for corrections.  Please input this gas loss to the 
system 550 balance. The estimated gas loss for January through April is as 
follows:

 January: 103,058 MCF 105,066 DTH
 February: 97,219 MCF 99,114 DTH
 March:  106,015 MCF 108,082 DTH
 April:  95,214 MCF 97,070 DTH


Gas loss for May will be forwarded as soon as we obtain the pressure readings 
from meter 
986501-10.                                                                    
                                   Attached is the supporting documentation 
used to calculate these volumes:





If you have any questions please call.

Please put the ENA 201 contract at this meter for April and May of 1999 with 
the Track ID 117848 and reallocate the meter for both months.  After this is 
done please let Stephanie and I know so that she can redraft her invoice the 
next day after POPS bridges to MOPS.  Also with respect to the second issue 
where Daren is asking for the price, Stephanie may be able to help you with 
this because she has a copy of Duke's invoice.


Stephanie:
The Crow O'Conner meter is essentially fixed.  When Aimee reallocates you 
will have to wait until the next day to redraft your invoice.  When Aimee 
gets back with us please redraft the invoice the next day and let me know if 
this issue is resolved.

The Crow O'Connor, meter 6757 has its gas allocated to Strangers Gas for 
April and May 1999 and Duke has been calling Settlements asking for their 
money.  I will need to set up accounting arrangements for this meter for 
these months so please provide me the correct transportation contract and 
valid deal # for this transaction.

In addition, the Sarco Lateral, meter 5192 has its gas allocated to Strangers 
Gas for May and July 1999 and Duke has been calling Settlements asking for

I would like to get this done ASAP since the customer is calling Settlements

Daren,

Yes, the gas on Deal 210722 is going to Reliant, however, it needs to be Brokered instead of Service as Tejas does not show any transport.  I don't know if it can be changed or if a new deal needs to be set up.

Thanks,

Daren,

Sherlyn Schumack suggested that I contact you with this matter.  I am working on some old HPL issues and have come across a deal that was initially set up, #208101, but this deal was subsequently killed (no reason found).  This deal was copied from #205533 which was good through 2/29/00.  Please set up a valid deal for March 2000 just like either one of these deals whereby HPL is buying gas from ENA on Tejas at the same points.  This deal is needed because it leads to a valid sale to Reliant Energy.  Please note that Reliant has been invoiced and settlement has already been made.

If I have not provided enough information or if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to give me a call.  As I need to resolve this issue as soon as possible, your prompt attention to this matter would be most appreciated.

Buddy

Pat,

I have been working with Volume Management, Settlements, Vance, and Bob to 
clean up some prior period and prior-to-current month issues.  This process 
should result in a correction to booked profit/loss for Vance and the desk.  
This has brought to my attention that we have been paying some parties 
manually for volumes when deals are not correctly entered.  I would propose 
that Logistics be included in the communication of when checks are manually 
cut.  It would be especially beneficial if we tracked manual checks by 
counterparty, meter, and/or deal ticket id or price.  I feel that this will 
allow us to spot and resolve potential issues more effectively.

Please let me know what your thoughts are on this matter.  

Thank you for your time,

Mary

Thanks, Elsa! Also I cannot find where Enron or HPL has ever executed a base
agreement with The Exchange Center so I will get one to you for review.
Thanks, Cooker

I did a search and found no deals for May for this counterparty.  Call
Daren Farmer at 713-853-6905, and he could probably put the deal in for
you.

5/31/01 for 286 mmbtu for a total of 429 mmbtu for 05/01. he deal last
month (04/01), was SA-70120. I don't have see a  sales draft  under ENA or
HPL for 05/01 sales to D&H, nor do I see any 05/01 sales deal under

Can you assist me in finding out if there was a sale to D&H in 05/01, and

Subject:	ENA Origination Track

All,

ENA is building an ENA Origination Track similar to that of the Trading Track.     Originators on both the Gas & Power side at the VP level have bought into the development of this program.    The management of the program will be the originators themselves under Louise Kitchen.   There will be structured rotations for the Analysts & Associates who join this program with a clear objective in mind - final rotation will be in Origination.

The below people, according to our records, are currently in your groups.   These candidates have been identified as they have completed at least one relevant rotation and/or have performed well in the previous prc.     Prior to contacting the below Analysts & Associates, I want to ensure your buy-in/recommendation of these candidates.      All selected candidates would be formally interviewed by the Origination management team (both gas & power) prior to joining the program.

I would be grateful for your early response as we are looking to schedule a date in November to commence interviews.

If you have any questions, please let me know and I will be happy to explain the program in greater detail.

Kind regards,

Karen

Daren,

We have deliveries of about 4,500/mo., more or less, at this meter beginning 
in May, 2000.  These volumes are currently on the Strangers Agmt, but,  I 
feel that a sales deal should be out there.   Please let me know what needs 
to be done to resolve this.

FYI.  I provided two reports to David Baumbach.  The reports were downloaded 
to Excel and saved to O:\Logistics\Buy_Sell_HPL_May_2000 and 
Buy_Sell_HPL_May_13_2000.  The first report reflects buys/sells by HPL across 
all pipes for the entire month of May.  The second report reflects buys/sells 
by HPL across all pipes for May 13, 2000, only.  Both reports were derived 
from the Volume Management module of UNIFY.  Please advise if you need 
additional information.

Daren, can you help me with placing K's @ the below listed meters?  I don't 
know if these deals should be rolled or if new ones were set up.

I'll need a K @ each specified meter for the month following the noted month 
that had a K @ it.

Thanks in advance for your help.

Saturday:

Mark from Aquilla was short 5000 into the Valero Hub and it appeared that 
PG&E may have to cut Aquilla's delivery into us, but Mark was able to get the 
5000 he needed to make the delivery.
Transco Bammel had some Unit testing by Transco preventing flow until 9 PM.  
I got with Robert A. From the East desk and he decided to go ahead and cut 
the nom down to 30 for Saturday's gas day.  I changed the confirm in Pops to 
reflect it.
Changed confirm for Midcon Hardy to show the correct 20,000.
Changed the confirm for Flaggstaff to show the correct 0.
Communicated with Reggie from Dynegy to get 4,000 at Transco Markham for 
Saturday's gas day confirmed with Transco.  It was finally confirmed later 
that night.

Sunday

At 6:00 the flow into Valero Riverside was 0'd out and changed to Valero 
T'Ville for the remainder of the gas day.  Gas Control said to do it 
verbally.  I could not get a hold of any scheduler with PG&E to see the 
contractual impact.  I let Ed Gottlob know and he said to just let it flow.

Attached please find the Activity Survey for the month of May, 2000.

I am sending the survey out this time as an opportunity to introduce myself 
to those of you I have not yet met.  I am being asked to take a direct roll 
in the further development and rollout of the Operations Pricing Model (fka 
Transaction Cost Model).  In the past, I have directed the implementation of 
several pricing systems based on activity based costing similar to the 
Operations Pricing Model (OPM).  Over the past couple of weeks my 
observations of the Model have lead me to be concerned with the quality of 
data used in the model.  It will take efforts by both you and the OPM team to 
get to a satisfactory level of data quality.  This process can start with 
this months data collection efforts.  Please pay particular attention this 
month as the "bar is being raised" by the management of Energy Operations for 
data quality and timeliness.

The attached survey drives your costs from your activities to the commercial 
teams.  Please select your RCs, and fill in the driver quantity for the 
requested driver for the month of May. Please fill out the attached activity 
driver survey with May numbers for your RC and return to Shari Mao by end of

Aquila split the volume between two points, that is why the deal changed.  
The total volume was still correct.  I just found out today, from Stacie, 
that a buy on EOL needs to be on the header and come from a PGEV Hub or Title 
Tracking Agreement.   I had previously been under the impression that 
whatever pipeline the customer wanted, buy or sell, was fine with us.  
However, keeping the purchases on Hub Agmts. will save Enron 
$.0025/transaction and push all imbalances and fees to the supplier.

Daren,

I left you a message regarding this matter 2 days ago.  Was wondering if you 
had time to look into this.

Conoco is saying that we are missing one day of sale to them:  5/5  10,000 
mmbtu at 2.95, deal #256686.

I am not seeing this in Sitara.  Could you please confirm?  

Customer has already called twice asking us to invoice them for this.

Thanks for your help on this.

Application of the fuel retained from transportation and treating contracts 
doesn't have to be done by zone or compressor, in fact I am sure there will 
be times when we are either short or long compressor fuel when compared to 
the pipelines total usage.  Usually, short.  I just do not think the market 
will let me lay off ALL of this risk.  It would be really nice if we could 
get the system to track compressor fuel used to service specific contracts 
but I am afraid it will always be a facility planning issue.  Fuel should not 
cause imbalances on the transportation contract.  A pipeline could be long 
fuel due to not running compression and in that case we would have to inject 
or hold in linepack the excess.  It seems that we would look at fuel on a 
total basis.

Subject: Re: Fuel  

We need to discuss further.  My concern would be that how do we know what % 
HPL should be retaining at a compressor or zone to make sure we recoup our 
fuel cost ?  Also, could allocated fuel cause a contract imbalance?  I think 
that Pipeline Operations can handle the scheduling of third party fuel 
retainage.  But, if we retain fuel on ENA transports, then we need to come up 
with a plan to nominate this in Marketing Operations to Houston Pipeline.  
Currently, this process is not in place.

Brenda,

As you know fuel is a big risk.  One of the things we are trying to do is get 
the shipper to pay fuel.  This would mean we would purchase, transport and 
possibly sell gas with a fuel percentage as part of the price.  Can the 
downstream systems, scheduling etc handle this?

Friday 3/23 - Received a page from Silver in Gas Control at 8:00 pm regarding 
the Gulf Plains Plant.  They were cut into another pipeline (Tennessee), and 
wanted to overdeliver to us by 10M for the night.  Larry Zammit paged 8:05 
pm, reiterated same.  We agreed to take the additional volume for the 
remainder of the evening only.

Saturday 3/24 - 7:30 am, received page from Lee in Gas Control regarding the 
Gulf Plains Plant, apparently they felt that they may need to overdeliver for 
Saturday's gas day as well.  Phoned Larry Zammit and spoke with him regarding 
the situation at the plant, he indicated that there may have been a 
miscommunication or misunderstanding at the plant.  Larry phoned the plant 
and made sure that they were on board to keep us balanced and not overdeliver 
to,  or swing on, HPL.

 2:00 pm - Phoned Lee in Gas Control to see how the pipeline was doing.  He 
indicated that we were pretty tight, but would probably make it without 
utilizing any OBA's.

Sunday - So. Union requested 15M beginning at 11:00 am. The pipeline was 
tight again, but Gas Control was okay.

Just so everyone is on the same page:

Based on Jennifer and Dale's discussions with Eric Bass, a new "tokenized 
period" will be set up in EOL.  The intent of this period (quick overview) is 
to allow for gas flow Monday through Friday and no flow on the weekends.  
This will generally be traded for in full month or rest of the month 
increments.

It is my understanding the although the trade can be conveyed correctly to 
the customer and priced accordingly using EOL, the trade itself (with 
Multiple Monday - Friday, no flow during weekend periods) cannot be handled 
internally by EOL.  Just as EOL is not able to handle this trade, the Sitara 
bridge from EOL cannot handle this trade.  Because of this, there should be 
heighten attention by Trade Capture given to the EOL Bridge monitor.  These 
trades will error out and will have to be entered manually.

An effort needs to be evaluated and prioritized by both applications (EOL and 
Sitara) on how a deal with multi-periods can flow without human 
intervention.  This has not been started.  In the meantime, a deal of this 
nature will have to be entered manually.

How do I know that a particular deal has multi-period flow?  Once the EOL 
product has been set up, Jennifer and/or Dale will let all involved know.  
The person(s) responsible for entering the deal will have to understand what 
is meant by the EOL product's delivery period and enter the deal 
accordingly.  

For example, assume that a deal has been traded for April:

  Four delivery periods (separate lines) should be included in the Sitara 
ticket
  
  Start: 04/03 Stop: 04/07
   04/10  04/14
   04/17  04/21
   04/24  04/28 
  
 Each delivery period (line) should have the same pricing

 Remember to enter the EOL deal number when creating the Sitara trade.

 Also remember that paths created in Unify assume the stop date is open 
ended.  Every effort needs to be made to make sure the appropriate end date 
is on the path; otherwise
 the number of reconciling items will increase.

Please forward this information to anyone else you think might be impacted.

Any concerns, please contact Sheri Thomas or myself.

extended the deal 421415 for the 6th and 19th and Meredith inserted a path in 
Unify - TETCO  to cover the small overflow volume between HPL and ENA. The 
ENA/HPL piece is done. The piece between HPL and Dynegy is what you need

I don't want to tell you to add any contracts, because I am not sure about 
that.   I am just saying if you look at Ray's schedule there are 2 deals out 
there, one is a purchase from ENA and the other a purchase from Dynegy.  The 
track id I gave you was for ENA.   You  cannot allocate the Dynegy piece 
until I give you a track id.   I cannot give you a track id until the deal is 
extended for days 10/6 and 10/19.

Jackie,
You did not allocate this according to Ray's schedule.  The track id I gave 
you was only for the purchase from ENA.   You need to extend the deal for the 
purchase from Dynegy.   You put all of the volume on these 2 days on ENA, 
that is not what is on Ray's schedule, so we are still out on the 
interconnect report.

Jackie,

Your allocation is correct with the exception of days 10/6 and 10/19 where 
strangers gas is allocated.    I have created an accounting arrangement for 
these days and the new track id for ENA is 240384.  Please allocate the ENA 
portion according to Rays schedule for these 2 days.    Deal 422516 (Purchase 
from Dynegy) needs to be extended for these 2 days so I can do an accounting 
arrangement.   Alfonso  I need for you to allocate your meter daily, because 
we have tiered pricing this month.

Thanks.

Daren, I completely forgot about Stacey's CQG ... was I supposed to send in 
another request for her and put it on Tom's Cost Center?  Or were we going to 
wait for Tom to okay it first??

Tess, would you please check with your commercial manager on the price. I do
not have a record of $5.30. My records indicate we've been purchasing this
gas at Inside FERC Houston Ship Channel less 7 which would be $5.30 for
April. Please recheck. Thanks.

FYI

Daren---On the 12th, there is a sale to Aquila on the Header system, for 
10,000........I think we were supplying it with AEC.  For whatever reason, I 
had the AEC 10.0 @ #11230 into Midcon...which isnt right because there was no 
market for it, and Midcon wasnt looking for it, but the Aquila deal was at 
#700 on WGR (Aquila).  So I went ahead and changed the AEC ticket to match up 
with the Aquila deal. Let me know if you think it is incorrect.

Thanks,
Mark

Per our conversation, the months relating to the CILCO deal with ENA - Texas 
are May 1999 - Sept 1999.  

However, when Howard and I talked about correcting the allocation in POPS, 
Howard is telling me that the CILCO sale is tied to the transport (206) 
contract in POPS.  If we remove the sale b/t ENA -TX and CILCO and put the 
sale b/t ENA-TX and the storage book, we no longer have a sale to tie to the 
transport.  Let me know what you think as we did not discuss this.  

Thanks!

This is one of the deals which you told me to zero out.  Unfortunately, I do 
not allocate PGEV.  Also,  Sherlyn has actualized PGEV and she has the

Shawna -  In addition to the meters sent to you in the earlier memo on the 
McMullen system, the following meters were shut in at approximately 12:00 PM 
on Thursday, December 9, 1999.  These meters were shut in order to install 
pigging facilities to remove liquids from the McMullen 12".  These producers 
should be brought back on-line sometime in the afternoon of December 10. 1999.

986847  Dolan Gas Unit #1
989604  Baker Central Point (Pioneer)
989638  Freeman Production - Maxine Field
989698  Mclean Bowers Central Point (Cordell)
989700  Tesoro Hoskins Central Point
989737  Pickett Texan Central Point
985853  Riser C/P Arco

986581  Sanger Heirs CDP
986682  Lynes J.R. Et Al #1
986845  Swierc #1

Once pigging facilities are in place, the McMullen 12" will be pigged 
(sometime early next week, week of Dec. 13) and all of the producers in the 
following attachment will be brought back on line.



If you have any questions, please call me at 36449.

I will be out of the office beginning Thursday, 12/24, returning on Tuesday, 
1/4.  In my absence, I have asked Steve Venturatos to be the point person for 
Texas Operations.

I realize that many of you will be working over the New Year's week-end to 
ensure a smooth transaction into the new year.  In advance, I truly 
appreciate all of the efforts.  Additionally, I would like to be kept 
informed on any critical issues, mainly so that I have no surprises when I 
return.  Therefore, I have provided numbers below where I can be reached.  I 
will leave it to your discretion as to whether you call me or leave me a 
voice mail in the office.  As you all know, I would rather be informed than 
surprised!

Steve,

Two questions:

1).  Does the answer below suffice for our needs?

and 

2).  If yes, and with Pat's answer in mind, would this be a cost that would 
go to your group first, then to Ed as O&M, or would it go directly to Ed?  


I am not sure who has the ability to control these cost more directly, you or 
Ed?


Thanks,

Troy

Becky,

In reviewing the spread the minimal volumes being reported are associated 
with the gas that supplies instrumentation on the pipeline, i.e. pressure and 
flow controllers, actuators, valve positioners, gas quality sampling and 
monitoring equipment, etc.

Pat, Attached is a file for unmetered gas loss for February 2000.  You have 
already answered my questions regarding meters 0980805, 0980877 and 0980803.  
After meeting with Steve Schneider it was decided to take a closer look at 
gas loss.  Steve would like explanations for all gas loss in Feb. 2000.  The 
attached file should help you.  All volumes in blue need an explanation.  Let 
me know if there is anything you need from me or if there is anything I can 
do.  Thank you.  Becky

Hey Daren,

We're back on this issue again.  There is gas out there for days 1-3 and 6-20 
but the deal is only good for 21-31. 

Can you assist Anita and I w/a deal number to place the 1st 20 days on.  
Anita is attempting to close this issue.

As usual, thanks for your help.

Daren,

The above mentioned meter is on stranger's for the entire month of Jan. 
2000.  There is a deal ticket applicable to this meter from Jan. 21st thru 
the 31st.  Is it o.k. for Volume Management to apply volumes from the 21st 
thru the 31st to the 215?

I don't know what kind of issues was associated with this deal.

Thanks

Jackie,
I see that the gas at this meter is allocated to "stranger's" in POPS.   
Stephanie Gomes in Settlement thinks that this could be Encina's gas.  I see 
in Sitara that deal 152638 is only valid from the 21st - 31st.   Can you 
please take a look.

Hey Anita,
For meter # 0986725, 1/00 production, I am showing per meter statement that 
41,671mmbtu flowed.  Is that gas really Encina's.  Has the volume just not 
been allocated yet.  Could you let me know  what the deal is on the meter.

Please prepare and send a termination letter by tomorrow March 16, 2001 on the above referenced deal.  Houston Pipe Line Company has not renegotiated a price and have no interest in buying the gas on an evergreen basis.  It is my understanding that we need to notify them within 10 days of the end of the delivery period

Daren - 

-FYI-


Exxon supply at Mobil Cayanosa has fallen off due to problems, so starting 
9/9 there nom will go from 5.000  down to .520 and going at least through the 
weekend 9/11.  Stacey has already bought gas from Duke to resupply (the 
difference 4.480) Midlothian at Duke Pegasus, in addition to the 8.600 
incremental she bought there.  So for the weekend, we should have a sale to 
Midlothian of 13,080 at Pegasus.

at this meter during  March, April, or May 1999.   Logistics needs approval 
to writeoff these volumes to Unaccounted for Gas.  Please print, sign, and 
return original to Clem Cernosek.

4000 vol.  the net at the meter being 149.   This does show up on my meter 
exception report.  Please advise.  Thank you.

FYI---I changed points on this deal from PGTT-TECO Waha 18002800 to PGTT-TECO 
Katy 20606100 for the 2nd.  Let me know if you don't agree with this.  The 
supply, Duke Field Svs, was originally trying to deliver to HPL at Midtex, 
this deal #589257 was also changed to meter 20606100.

Stella:

I set up the accounting arrangement on the HPLR transport contract 
012-64610-02-052 for January through June per Daren's instructions below.  
The tracking ID for all 6 months is 34500.

I also set up accounting arrangement on the HPLC transport contract 
012-41500-02-015 for July per Daren's instructions below.  The tracking ID 
for July is 34501.  If you would, please put the transport contract in POPS 
on Monday morning and call me when your done so that I can reallocate the 
meters.  I need to call Copano to tell them that their payment is on the way.

I need the transport contracts, HPLR and HPLC put in for all 31 days of each 
of the respective months.

As always thanks in advance for your help,

Fred

Daren:

I looked in Path Manager and I see two deals - 93480 and 93481, but I don't 
see deal 69176 for July forward that you mentioned below.  Also, please 
verify that the deal for January through June is 93481 and if the 69176 deal 
is correct for July forward.


Stella:

I will need to set up accounting arrangements for these deals from January 
forward.  From Daren's note below it appears that for January through June I 
will need an HPLR transportation contract put in POPS.  When Daren and I get 
the deal number issue resolved for July forward I will need an HPLC contract 
put into POPS.  Also for July forward, I will need the HPLC contract in POPS 
every month through December to allocate Copano line gain to if it occurs.

Thanks to both of you,

Fred

Fred, 

I have pathed the purchase from Copano for 1999 in MOPS.  Jan-Jun is under 
HPLR (Sitara 93481).  July forward is under HPLC (Sitara 69176).  I 
understand that I cannot renom this to the pipe for prior months, because the 
callout allocations will be affected.  So, you will need to set up accounting 
arrangements to get the nom into POPS.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Daren- FYI.  There are deal tickets in Sitara to cover this transaction- 
#69176 for HPLR and #93481 for HPLC- but they have zero volume and were not

Stella:

I need the above referenced contract put into POPS for January, May, June , 
July, and August 1999 forward.  I need the contract in POPS for August 
forward because I never know when Copano will allocate line gain to itself.

In 1998 a spot contract was set up between HPLR and Copano Pipeline/South 
Texas, L. P. with a Synergi contract number 078-62210-101 and a Global number 
of 96016880 by Karen Lambert.  Per Karen this old agreement was terminated by 
Dan Hyvl due to HPLR business change to ECT.  In 1999, when Copano began 
allocating line gain to themselves again I contacted Lauri, Karen, and 
yourself to see if I could get the contract in POPS.  Karen sent me an e-mail 
indicating that she set-up a new contract for this HPLC line gain purchase - 
Global # 96022367 (I don't have a "Synergi" contract number).  I know that in 
3/99 Lauri contacted Bernard Widacki at Copano to discuss this issue.

I need Lauri to review this and then I need the contract to be put in POPS so 
that I can correctly allocate the gas at this meter.  I have not allocated 
any line gain in 1999 and the volumes are small.  Karen is the most 
knowledgeable about this contract, so I suggest that any questions be 
directed to her regarding contract issues.  Karen worked with Bernard Widacki 
at Copano to set up the contract originally.

Thanks,

Fred

I need a desk to desk deal set up at meter 378 for February 2000.  It is an 
ENA sale (delivery) on the 202 contract and an HPL buy (receipt) on the HPL 
216 contract.  This is a very high priority because the bridge will close 
today.  If possible would you have this completed by Noon today?

The July customer trip is right around the corner.  I'm sure you will be 
hearing more questions from your customers as the day arrives.  Just in case, 
here are a few helpful hints. 

I am currently (today) in the process of putting together a To Bring list for 
you customers.  Just a helpful list of clothing items, sun skin care 
suggestions, etc. list that they may want to pack.  An agenda will be coming 
shortly after that.  As you all know each of your customers are responsible 
for getting themselves to Florida.  If for some reason you have a  . . . . . 
. high maintenance customer who is really pushing the issue of us helping 
them find a flight we will help target some flights they can take.  They will 
still be responsible for the  fare.  Please don't freely offer this 
suggestion only use it as an emergency.

I do have the list of each of your customers who have RSVP'd. if you have any 
customers who you are afraid may back out please let me know who they are so 
that I can make a "Glad you're coming do you have any questions?" phone call 
a few days before departure to ensure they are still coming.

If you have any other questions or concerns, let me know.

You asked me to book 3745 for you for Monday the 20th from 1-2 pm.  I had to 
bump you out of 3745, but I have
booked 3749 (down from 3745) for you for the same time.

Revision - According to measurement, there is flow of 7,394 in 8/98, however, 
there is nothing to indicate this is gas that was received on HPL in OSS.   I 
checked MIPs and there is a measurement statement that supports the flow rate 
of 7,394 MMBTu.  

Daren is there a deal in CPR which may not have fed over to OSS?   I checked 
OSS for the whole year of 1998 and there are no other deals in OSS.  It does 
seem strange that this is the only month of flow.

Thanks, Stella

SALARIES, SALARIES, SALARIES!!!   Everyone is having problems.  
Unfortunately, many of
you are new to your jobs and did not inherit paperwork to know what your 
staff's salary is.  I have the average
salary for each of the different staffing levels.  I have asked the HR 
department to also give me
the low and the high.  Let's face it - your staff today and their salary most 
likely are not what
they are going to be next year!  To much movement of people.  So using 
estimates and averages
will probably be as accurate as using current salary levels.

Here's what you can do:

1) Make a list of your staff just their positions.
2) Then put down if you think I should budget high, mid, average, low, low to 
average, etc.
 You can guess at this based on their experience, length of time in that 
position, etc.
3) Then I will calculate out an estimated salary to use for your budget.
4) Here is the average:

 Sr. $4,961
 Spec $3,964
 Staff $3,026
 Sr. Clrk $2,548
 Clerk $2,264
 Asst $3,162

Your list would look something like this:

 Assistant Average
 Clerk  Very High
 Sr. Clerk Low
 Specialist Low to Average
 Specialist Average
 Sr. Specialist Average to High
 Analyst  (They are all allocated at the same amount)

You can , however, use the exact amounts if you have them.  It's up to you.

Next Item - TRAINING!!!

Here's what you can do:

1) List your staff and the type of class they need
2) If you don't know the exact class you want to send them to, then list what 
type
 of class - for example personal enrichment (i.e. Time Management) or
 Technical (Derivatives or Applied Finance or Wellhead to Burnertip)
3) The personal enrichment classes cost aroung $500-$700
4) The technical classes cost aroung $800 - $1000.
5) Just list the type of class, and I'll do the rest.

Next Item - Headhunters!

Try 20% of the new hires salary for their fees.


Other Stuff - I have made a list of all of the unusual items we do during the 
year that
people forget about at budget time (i.e. flowers for secretaries day, birthday
ice cream, offsite meeting costs, customer gifts).  If you forget these 
items, I will
make sure it is added to your budget.


Once I put all of your budget information into the spreadsheets, we will 
review them
so that they can be adjusted as necessary and you can approve them.Hopefully 
this helps you some.

I have a problem with Tristar for May 2001.  The deal number is 779345.  They sent me an invoice for 40,000 from the 24th to the 31st at $3.975.  In our deal, we only have 6,000 on the 24th at $3.975.  Did you do a deal for 40,000?  I can't find a deal on Oasis or on HPL for this amount.

Mary,
Please be careful of EOL deals.  I got a call on Friday evening about this 
deal being changed but you had already left.
It is a deal with Aquila and the volume was changed.  Please check on this 
and communicate all changes  to Daren.  

Thanks,  Pat

Elsa,

I was informed to bill anything on HGPL by my supervisor, but when I talk to 
Priscilla Hamic she informed me that HGPL should be billed by offsystem and 
not the Texas desk.  The deals in Sitara that relate to HGPL all state that 
it is Texas desk.

Please let me know who should be billing MGI Supply for HGPL volume.

Thanks for your help.

These are revised schedules for Jan, Mar, &  Apr 2000 and the estimate 
(scheduled) volumes for May.
The prices were revised to capture Texas General storage revenue (fuel 
retention) in Jan, Mar, & Apr.  The fuel volumes are shown as a zero buy 
price for the storage book.
The April also has volume true-ups due to actual metered volumes. (Schedule 
6).  Another adjustment was made in April to true up the cumulative facility 
balance, (4,295 mmbtu).

Thanks,
Kenny

Hi Daren,

Sorry that I didn't include you on Gary's e-mail.  He presented these 
questions to the Volume Management Group (which I agree). I will now forward 
you the response from Volume Management.

I am uncomfortable putting a deal out there without more details.  Here are 
my questions:
 1) Why was this gas just discovered now?  And where has it been hiding?
 2) Adonis is a WMBE which means he has a direct pay agreement so never pays 
for gas taken.  We have to invoice
  the actual burner for this gas (HL&P, TU, CP&L, etc).  Can we identify end 
user and see if they paid for this gas or will have to pay.
 3) Adonis has skipped town and is no longer in business.  HL&P told me he 
got paid for gas that never was delivered (rumor).
  How can we invoice him now?
 4) 60,000 mmbtu seems like a high volume of gas to slip through the cracks 
for almost two years.  Answer the above questions and 
  I will be glad to approve this.

Karen,

I realize this.  It appears as if you're asking me to have day 16 added to 
the Sitara deal ticket so that all volumes that flowed for that day can 
allocate to this deal.

Maybe you might want to phone me if this is not the case.

Jackie,
What I am saying is that in POPS volume is allocated to deal number 51862, 
however in Sitara, this deal doesn't have day 16 on it.  Call me if you need 
further details.    X58381

Karen,

I've looked in POPS and on day 16 of January 1999, I see a total confirmed 
volume of 61,365 and an actual of 62,151.  If I'm understanding you 
correctly, you're asking me to allocate all of this volume to deal #51862.

If so, that's incorrect.  Several deals are associated the this days volume.

Please write back or phone back with further details.

Thanks

Jackie, 

Volume is allocating to deal number 51862 on 1/16/99 on meter 984132, however 
the deal does not have this day on it.  Please have 1/16 added to the deal so 
the error will clear.

Thanks and if you need additional info, let me know.

As a follow up to my message last week on charges for Analysts, I am 
attaching the file that Financial Operations used to charge your RC with the 
$6,400 in monthly costs that I detailed below.  I have received a few calls 
and E-mails stating that some reclasses need to be made because you no longer 
have an analyst in your group.  The information used by Financial Operations 
to charge your RC was obtained from the Org Database.  Please review the 
attached files for January and February to ensure that the proper RC was and 
is going to be charged.  If you have any corrections, please contact Brian 
Heinrich at Ext. 5-7677 ASAP since journal entries will need to be processed 
by this Friday, March 3rd.

If you have any questions, please call me.  I just want to let everyone know 
that it is important that we continue to keep the Org Database updated as 
changes are made.  It is and will continue to be the source of headcount 
information for Energy Operations.  Thank you for your continued support in 
this process.

Subject: Monthly Charges for Analysts on your RC report

I wanted to let all of you know how you will be charged for Analysts if you 
currently have or will have one in your RC for the year 2000.  The analyst 
program is being handled differently than it was in 1999.  In addition to the 
normal salary, benefits and payroll taxes, you will also be charged an 
overhead administration fee for the program.  You will be charged the 
following MONTHLY amounts for each analyst in the Detail Class code that I 
have indicated below:

Detail Class  Description   Amount
      1  Salaries and Wages                   $4,000
        552  Benefits                         774
        557  Payroll Taxes                         360
        820  Corporate Services                      1,266
    Total MONTHLY Cost                   $6,400 

The $4000 amount represents an average of all analyst salaries and does not 
indicate what the analyst in your RC is paid.  This amount will not change in 
February as the $4000 already includes merit raise information for 2000.

The $1266 represents the overhead costs of administering the program, 
including campus recruiting and office visits.

When you look at your RC report, you will see a line item labeled  "A and A 
Reclass" in each of the Detail Classes identified above.  Enron North America 
is invoiced by Corp. for the costs of all analysts.  Financial Operations 
makes a manual Journal Entry each month to charge the appropriate RC.  Please 
check your January 2000 RC report and make sure you were properly charged for 
the correct number of analysts you have currently.  If there are any errors, 
please let me know as soon as possible so that I can work with Brian Heinrich 
to have it corrected in February.  Please continue to check your RC report 
each month going forward.  Thanks.

If you have any questions, please call me.

Subject: Revision - Black Marlin - meter 986782 for 8/98 - UA4





Revision - According to measurement, there is flow of 7,394 in 8/98, however, 
there is nothing to indicate this is gas that was received on HPL in OSS.   I 
checked MIPs and there is a measurement statement that supports the flow rate 
of 7,394 MMBTu.  

Daren is there a deal in CPR which may not have fed over to OSS?   I checked 
OSS for the whole year of 1998 and there are no other deals in OSS.  It does 
seem strange that this is the only month of flow.

Thanks, Stella

Subject: OPM Hours Survey - January, 2001 - CHANGES!! PLEASE READ!


It's that time again to enter your hours and activities for January, 2001.  
Please use the shortcut below or go to the following path O:\Energy_Ops\OPM 
Hours Survey\ProdUser to access the hours survey.

PLEASE NOTE THAT THERE ARE SOME CHANGES THIS MONTH IN THE SURVEY.  THEY ARE 
AS FOLLOWS:

1) You must use your new SAP cost center in the survey this month.  I have 
attached a file that converts your old cost center incase you don't know what 
your new one is.

2) Due to the SAP cost center conversion, we were unable to roll over 
previous months commercial teams and headcount (FTE) information.  Therefore, 
we need you to enter the commercial teams your cost center supports and the 
FTE's in your cost center.  We will roll this information over beginning next 
month.

3) In previous months you were able to print a report that showed your prior 
months hours by activity.  Due to the SAP cost center conversion, that 
function is not available this month.  It will be available next month.  If 
you need your hours for prior months please call me and I will forward this 
information to you.

When completing the FTE's section of the survey, if there are any Director, 
Sr. Admin or Admin positions in your cost center, please complete 
accordingly.  You are not expected to complete a hours survey for these 
positions but we do need them to be included in your FTE's.

Please have your survey's completed by Wednesday, February 7.  Please call me 
if you have any questions or need me to help you complete the survey.

Thanks,
Suzanne
(X 5-7341)

1. Tom asked for a historical number for Entex the 2nd week on the job in t=
he=20
morning meeting. He wasn=01,t expecting me to bring forth anything because =
I had=20
just started. No one provided any information after the first day, so I=20
decided to look it up and do it myself. Tom was very pleased.

2. Tom gave that info to Ed, and he asked for further data:

a. About Cinco ranch, Greatwood, and Spring interconnects

I coordinated with Brad Blevins and applied it to the fact that origination=
=20
was booked for Nov, but the points had yet to be operational. Brad and I=20
remain in close contact to share any Entex interconnect info.

b. Research transport info

Documented why Entex Transport volumes decreased by 6000, and used info=20
towards the audit

c. Check weather forecast for Nov

I got weather info from Mike Roberts and developed some volumes that=20
corresponded with historical data related to the average of the forecast. T=
om=01,
s response was, "This is great. Why hasn=01,t anyone been able to do this=
=20
before."

3. Prepare and present Entex info in morning meetings and prebid meetings.

4. Work with weather research group to get better understanding of Entex=20
trends.

5. Prepare information gathering Entex data including:

Midcon Vols

Price behavior

Temperature and weather conditions

HPL vols

6. Thoroughly understand and apply Entex contracts:

-Realize need for daily vols and mentor summer intern to put together data=
=20
base of historical information (winter cap)

-Recognized accounting discrepancy that saved us $11,000

-Reorganized Entex tracking spreadsheets to incorporate a variety of info,=
=20
including booked volumes, weather, and contract terms

-Part of the audit team

7. Managed weather hedge (swap and put)

After doing some background work, I found out that the weather research gro=
up=20
was incorrect, and their files were feeding incorrect data (IAH temps inste=
ad=20
of HOU temps). This find resulted in a gain on of $3,376,780.
=20

8. Handle CES deals on the Texas Desk

-Organized and facilitated a meeting with back office to review all CES dea=
ls

-Incorporated all CES info with Enron systems

-Fully gather all data

-Liaison between Devon and Enron (whole trade floor)

-Ensure all information was correct

Daren,

The above mentioned meter is on stranger's for the entire month of Jan. 
2000.  There is a deal ticket applicable to this meter from Jan. 21st thru 
the 31st.  Is it o.k. for Volume Management to apply volumes from the 21st 
thru the 31st to the 215?

I don't know what kind of issues was associated with this deal.

Thanks

Jackie,
I see that the gas at this meter is allocated to "stranger's" in POPS.   
Stephanie Gomes in Settlement thinks that this could be Encina's gas.  I see 
in Sitara that deal 152638 is only valid from the 21st - 31st.   Can you

Subject: Meter # 0986725 - 1/00 production - Encina Gas Marketing

Hey Anita,
For meter # 0986725, 1/00 production, I am showing per meter statement that 
41,671mmbtu flowed.  Is that gas really Encina's.  Has the volume just not 
been allocated yet.  Could you let me know  what the deal is on the meter.

Thanks, Stephanie ( 3-6004 )

I just wanted to give all of you an update to my previous message on the 
replacement for Brian Heinrich in Financial Operations.  Jennifer Blay was 
going to be his replacement; however, Jennifer has accepted a position in 
Energy Operations working for Jeff Sorenson.  The newest addition to the 
Financial Operations staff is Holly Heath who joins us from Bank United.  She 
is located at EB-2419A and can be reached at Ext. 3-5843.  In addition, Sarah 
Brown will transfer as Manager of the Consolidated Reporting Team from the 
Gas and Transmission Assets Team in the Business Analysis and Reporting 
organization.  Sarah is located at EB-2419B and can be reached at Ext. 3-3417.

Brian will be helping to transition Holly into her new responsibilities.  As 
such, you will be receiving E-mails from Brian during the next week or so.  
After that, Holly will begin to request information directly from you.

Please join me in welcoming both Holly and Sarah into their new roles.  
Thanks for your patience during the next few weeks.  If you have any 
questions, please do not hesitate to call me.

Karen,

I realize this.  It appears as if you're asking me to have day 16 added to 
the Sitara deal ticket so that all volumes that flowed for that day can 
allocate to this deal.

Maybe you might want to phone me if this is not the case.

Jackie,
What I am saying is that in POPS volume is allocated to deal number 51862, 
however in Sitara, this deal doesn't have day 16 on it.  Call me if you need 
further details.    X58381

Karen,

I've looked in POPS and on day 16 of January 1999, I see a total confirmed 
volume of 61,365 and an actual of 62,151.  If I'm understanding you 
correctly, you're asking me to allocate all of this volume to deal #51862.

If so, that's incorrect.  Several deals are associated the this days volume.

Please write back or phone back with further details.

Thanks

Jackie, 

Volume is allocating to deal number 51862 on 1/16/99 on meter 984132, however 
the deal does not have this day on it.  Please have 1/16 added to the deal so 
the error will clear.

Thanks and if you need additional info, let me know.

Karen

We will need a small staff to handle potential trades for Wed. the 27th.  
Most of the pipelines are out of the office, so I would expect the work load 
to be minimal.  I plan on coming in, and would like to have a minimum of 
three on staff, so I need two volunteers (one offsystem, just in  case).  If 
anyone is going to be in town, please forward a number, in case we need to 
call any additional people in, or have you work on a laptop from home.  I 
will get with you after the new year to make up the holiday you miss, or, you 
can schedule your day now, I have the calendars.  Also, I will be out on 
vacation Friday, Dec. 22nd and will need someone to send the nominations to 
the plants, I don't expect to have full system coverage, just HPL/HPL and 
HPL/ENA as needed.  Let me know if you are interested in learning how to do 
this.

Thank you,

Mary

Loraine sent an allocation for fuel that is not scheduled.   Her schedule has 
fuel on days where there was no flow:
Day fuel
5 40
8 15
9 14

Can you let me know if we need to book fuel on this contract and what needs 
to be done on days where we have no flow?

We called Loraine and she told us to contact you since you are aware of this.

Hi Daren,

Can you please check into whether or not the below deals for the above meters 
can be rolled and extended?  If so, can you please perform this for me so 
that Anita can set up an accounting arrangement for me?

98-6719  Sitara Deal #166989 Flow @ meter began on February 10th but the deal 
is not effective until  February the 11th.
     No new deal # referenced and no evergreen flag.  This is on the 
gathering (96026573) K which is the only
     K @ the meter.

98-9676  Sitara Deal #151669 Deal good from 1/1/00 - 1/31/00 but there is 
flow for all of February 2000 with no K.  This is on the 215K      for 1/2000 
production which is the only K @ the meter.


Thanks

In an attempt to continue cross training on our desk,  Jackie and Susan will 
be switching duties.
Jackie will start training on Susan's desk and Susan on Jackie's and the 
transition will last most
of March and they will finalize it with April business.  It is important that 
we start communicating the
changes to our customers and make it as smooth as possible on them.  Thanks,  
Pat

I do not have a record of a spot deal in my notes or my deal sheet.  If Bob 
wants to call me with a tape that would be great.  The .085 difference 
results in $405 so I will call Bob and try to put this to bed.  As of now 
leave it allocated to a term deal.

A volume of 6,289 Mmbtu flowed over the noms for CP&L.  I don't have a record 
of a spot deal with them for that day.

Gary - Currently, that volume has been allocated to the Term agreement.  The 
price difference on that day is significant.  (HSC GD mid was 5.245).  If you 
don't have a record of a spot deal, the allocation should stand as it is.

Daren,

I am handling CP&L and am trying to resolve this issue from February 
production.  CP&L shows 5,000 mmbtu on February 21, but we do not have a 
deal.  Were you able to find anything out about this?

Thanks for your help.

Can we verified this gas flowed?  If it did it should have been billed on his 
term deal if there was one in place.  If the gas flowed and we did not 
invoice for it on term let me know and I will put it in.

Daren,

The above meter recorded a flow on Jan 15 this year.  It has not had any 
activity all the way back through 1999.  I checked with Cheryl Jones and the 
flow is good.  It was apparently turned on for that one day.  Do we need to 
put in a deal for this flow?  

Thanks.

Also, we had a transport nom from Texaco into King Ranch, so we will have 
adequate flow into Stratton.

Daren,

The below memo was rec'd on today from my contact at Lyondell (John Allen) 
referencing meter 98-1063's gas pressure problems on last night (3-7-00).

I thought that this might be some useful information to you.

Daren,

On January 15 and 16, HPL bought some gas from Western Gas Resources at the 
Aquila Header (10.000 and 5.000 MMBTU's respectively).  This was a late 
Friday change so in order to get it scheduled in POPS, the gas was scheduled 
on the stranger's gas contract.  However, deal ticket #143709 was never 
updated to reflect those late changes.  Please let me know if you want me to 
update the deal ticket.  Thanks, Susan.

It is the pipelines decision on how to allocate between the shippers, 
however, If the pipeline allocates the shortage to ENA then we need to follow 
the contract language and bill accordingly.  Just remember that we allowed 
makeup  on the 18, 19, & 20th for a total volume of 5K over 3 days so that 
will apply toward the 4th and part of the 9th.  All other volumes should be 
purchased back  per the language in the contract.  Remember they have a 
tolerance of 5% below the nomination.

Thanks,
Janet

For days 4, 9, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17 and 28,  we are short at the aggregate 
meter.   Should the Reliant transport and Sales or do we charge Reliant a 
penalty?

Also, I notice that at meter 1554 we have 3rd party transport this month.  
This look strange because I've not seen them here before.

Please advice.

Charlene, 

We should not have scheduled any volume for the 29-30th.  No price was 
negotiated that I can find. However, since gas did flow, I rolled the last 
price on the deal to cover those days.  What price is Hesco showing?

Deal #214948 already had volume and price for the 12th and 13th.  You may 
need to have the volumes updated by Volume Management.

I added the 15th and 16th to the deal ticket.

I do not have a record of a spot deal in my notes or my deal sheet.  If Bob wants to call me with a tape that would be great.  The .085 difference results in $405 so I will call Bob and try to put this to bed.  As of now leave it allocated to a term deal.

A volume of 6,289 Mmbtu flowed over the noms for CP&L.  I don't have a record of a spot deal with them for that day.

Gary - Currently, that volume has been allocated to the Term agreement.  The price difference on that day is significant.  (HSC GD mid was 5.245).  If you don't have a record of a spot deal, the allocation should stand as it is.

Can we verified this gas flowed?  If it did it should have been billed on his term deal if there was one in place.  If the gas flowed and we did not invoice for it on term let me know and I will put it in.

I am pleased to announce that Brian Heinrich will be joining the Strategic 
Operations group effective March 1.  Brian will be working with me on the 
budget and will help me to continue to develop processes and procedures that 
will streamline the monthly review of charges on your RC reports.  He will be 
working closely with his replacement in Financial Operations, Jennifer Blay, 
to accomplish this.  Jennifer has been previously providing support to the IT 
organization just as Brian had for Energy Operations.  Therefore, you will 
start receiving messages from Jennifer, like the one below.

Please join me in welcoming Brian to Energy Operations as well as Jennifer 
Blay in her new support role for Energy Operations.  If you have any 
questions regarding these personnel changes, please feel free to call me.  
You may continue to contact Brian with your questions as he works to 
transition responsibilities to Jennifer over the next few weeks.  But please 
know that Brian and I will be working with all of you, as well as Jennifer, 
to make things easier for each of you to control your 2000 budget.  Thank you 
for your continued support.

The above deal is a DD deal effective 7/1/2000-7/5/2000.  Can the deal be 
extended to the 6th to cover flow of .803 decatherms?

We've not yet received the OBA from TETCO yet.

Per Nelson Ferries(dealmaker): We do pay Spinnaker I-.08. O'Neal, could you 
please change the base purchase deals to reflect that price. I changed the 
transport tickets to show that we pay nothing.

Daren,

Sherlyn Schumack suggested that I contact you with this matter.  I am working on some old HPL issues and have come across a deal that was initially set up, #208101, but this deal was subsequently killed (no reason found).  This deal was copied from #205533 which was good through 2/29/00.  Please set up a valid deal for March 2000 just like either one of these deals whereby HPL is buying gas from ENA on Tejas at the same points.  This deal is needed because it leads to a valid sale to Reliant Energy.  Please note that Reliant has been invoiced and settlement has already been made.

If I have not provided enough information or if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to give me a call.  As I need to resolve this issue as soon as possible, your prompt attention to this matter would be most appreciated.

Buddy

Jackie,

Since the inlet to 3 River Plant is shut in on 10/19/99 (the last day of 
flow):
at what meter is the McMullen gas being diverted to?
at what meter is HPL buying the residue gas? (this is the gas from Teco, 
Vastar, Vintage, Tejones, and Swift)

I still see active deals at meter 3405 in Path Manager for Teco, Vastar, 
Vintage, Tejones, and Swift
I also see gas scheduled in POPS at meter 3404 and  3405.  

Please advice.   We need to resolve this as soon as possible so Settlement 
can send out payments.

Thanks

This is the fuel that is buy and sell between HPLC and HPLR.  For meter 9699 
it's 2.5% and for meter 2662 it's 4%.   However, the volume is a fixed amount 
every month and is kept whole.

Anita,

There is a delivery nom of 22 @ the above mentioned meter for 1/99 
production.  This is a receipt meter. 

Can you please explain the purpose of this delivery nom being @ this receipt 
meter?  I also have the same situation @ 98-2662 for 1/99.  Also, this 
activity is continuing on into 2/99.

Clem Cernosek expressed that these delivery noms are causing errors on his 
end of the spectrum.

Jackie-

I cannot for the life of me remember why this sale deal is in there.  I do 
believe it is valid and is a part of the purchase deal with Tesoro.  Jill 
Zively was the dealmaker and could probably answer your question as could 
George Weissman and Melissa Graves.  You might also check with Anita, the 
allocator, to see the support she gets for the allocation.  This may give you 
some clue as to what this volume represents.  (Let me know, too, since I hate 
forgetting things!!!!)

Okay, this one has been resolved....   the deals for days 9 and 10 are good.  
Sitara did not feed this deal to MOPS at all therefore it didn't feed to 
POPS.  

Sherlyn is setting things up and will provide me with a tracking ID, I will 
enter volumes and re-allocate the meter.

Very confusing but finally resolved.

Charlotte,

There is an interconnect variance at meter 980071 for 2/99.   It appears the 
variance is created on 2/9/99 and 2/10/99.  There is a transport usage deal 
ticket 72893 in Sitara which shows PG&E delivers 6,965 mmbtu to HPL on 2/9/99 
and 3,683 mmbtu on 2/10/99, but HPL does not show a receipt of this volume.   
Let me know if you need the PG&E support.

The CPR Report named Desk Summary is currently being reviewed for an 
upgrade.  I have been told that this report is used during bidweek to check 
positions on a particular pipe (for a particular zone).  If you do not need 
additional data, this report could very easily be added to the report 
selection in the SITARA Reporting application.  If anyone would like to see 
more detailed information on the report, please let me know.  There may be a 
report that is already in Production that they can access.

Please let me know if the format currently in CPR is sufficient as soon as 
possible.

Chao!

Daren - thank you for the list of the true, remaining ENA sales customers.  I 
have been researching your list & getting the contractual volumes that Brenda 
needs.  I am confused about Praxair though.

The sales contract between ENA & Praxair was assigned to HPLC eff/ 10/1/99.  
The only remaining contract between ENA & Praxair is a Master Financial 
Agreement.

Does Praxair really need to remain under ENA or is it okay under HPLC?  If it 
really needs to be under ENA, we will need to un-do the 10/1/99 assignment to 
HPLC or set-up a new contract between ENA & Praxair.

Please advise.

Cheryl, 

The counterparties with which ENA currently sales gas are:

City of Brazoria
Central Illinois Light Company
D & H Gas Company, Inc.
Markham Gas 
Merit Energy Partners
Praxair
Reliant Energy - Entex
Reliant Energy - HL&P
Southern Union Company
Texas Utilities Fuel Company (Now TXU Fuel Co)
Union Carbide Corporation
Unit Gas Transmission Company Inc


ENA has transacted with the other companies listed below, but that will most 
likely not happen again.  (HPL will trade with those counterparties.)

All ENA trades on HPL will be in Sitara.  We have reports which can be 
generated out of CPR that can list all deals by counterparty for ENA.  Let me 
know if you need something like that.  

Let me know if you have any other questions.

Just to update you on this project's status:

Based on a new report that Scott Mills ran for me from Sitara, I have come up 
with the following counterparties as the ones to which ENA is selling gas off 
of HPL's pipe.

Altrade Transaction, L.L.C.   Gulf Gas Utilities Company
Brazoria, City of     Panther Pipeline, Inc.
Central Illinois Light Company   Praxair, Inc.
Central Power and Light Company  Reliant Energy - Entex
CES - Equistar Chemicals, LP   Reliant Energy - HL&P
Central Illinois Light Company  Southern Union Company
D & H Gas Company, Inc.   Texas Utilities Fuel Company
Duke Energy Field Services, Inc.  TXU Gas Distribution
Entex Gas Marketing Company   Union Carbide Corporation
Equistar Chemicals, LP    Unit Gas Transmission Company Inc.


Since I'm not sure exactly what gets entered into Sitara, Pat Clynes 
suggested that I check with Daren Farmer to make sure that I'm not missing 
something (which I did below).  While I am waiting for a response from him 
and/or Mary Smith, I will begin gathering the contractual volumes under the 
above contracts.

Subject: ENA Sales on HPL

I am working on a project for Brenda Herod & was wondering if one of you 
could tell me if I'm on the right track & if this will get everything for 
which she is looking.

She is trying to draft a long-term transport/storage agreement between ENA & 
HPLC which will allow ENA to move the gas to their markets.  In order to 
accomplish this, she needs to know all of the Sales to customers that ENA is 
doing off of HPL's pipe.

I had Scott Mills run a report from Sitara showing all ENA Buy/Sell Activity 
on HPL since 7/99.  If I eliminate the Buys & the desk-to-desk deals, will 
this give me everything that I need?

Are there buy/sell deals done with ENA on HPL's pipe that wouldn't show up in 
Sitara?  Someone mentioned something about deals where HPL transports the gas 
on it's own behalf then ENA sells it to a customer at that same spot  --  
?????  Do deals like that happen? Would they show up in Sitara?

Is there anything else that I'm missing?  I'm not real familiar with how some 
of these deals happen nowadays so am very receptive to any 
ideas/suggestions/help that you can offer !!!

Thanks in advance.

I see that you have alot of the things that are on the error report, some of 
which I am not sure that I have assigned to you.  If anyone tells you that 
you are now doing something off of their desk, please refer them to me at 
this time.  I don't want anyone to dump any the "crap", or less savory work 
off of t heir desks onto you (we all have things we would prefer not to have 
to do which still must be done, it just comes with the territory).  Also, let 
me know if you feel comfortable with any additional shipper accounts.  I 
would like to see you crosstrain with Sabrae after the Holidays.

Thanks,

Mary

Specifically, meter 1373 has several deals set up and 6 of them are ranked 
10. These will not allocate properly as you know. Suggest you double check 
all the Industrials to ensure they are ranked correctly. January will then 
need to be re-nomed.

Daren,


This is one of the deals which you told me to zero out.  Unfortunately, I do 
not allocate PGEV.  Also,  Sherlyn has actualized PGEV and she has the 
support from the pipeline for the 1746918 volume.  Please let me know if I 
had missed something in our conversation.  Thanks

You probably haven't had time to look at the Duke Energy price.  When you get 
a chance could you please let me know what the correct price is for May 2000 
production.

Elizabeth,
Sorry, I can't remember if we had talked about this pricing issue or what.  
Were you looking into this issue  for me or was it passed to someone else.
Please see the email below.  I believe the system is pulling in the wrong 
price for WAHA.WTX.IF.M.I.. for 5/00 production.  The deal # is 250237.
 I looked at the publication and it shows that the price should be $2.95.  
The price of $2.95 plus $1 would equal the price of $2.96 which is what Duke 
is 
claiming the price to be instead of what we are showing which is $3.95.

Thanks, Stephanie ( 3-6004 )

Elizabeth,
I have a pricing discrepancy and I was not sure if I send this to you or 
Oneil.  
It's for Duke Energy, 5/00 production, deal # 250237.  Duke believes our 
price is too high.  The system downloaded a price of  $3.95 
The price should be WAHA.WTX.IF.M.I. , which is $2.95 for that month.  ( 
WAHA.WTX.IF.M.I. + 1 ) Duke believes we should have paid them $2.96.
I think the system pulled in the wrong price.  Could you please let me know 
if you handle this pricing issue or someone else?

Thanks, Stephanie ( 3-6004 )

Daren,

Stacey is out of the office today, I hope you can help.  Deal 107937 was 
originally set up for 155,000, but the nom was changed to 140,000.  I show 
5,000 was purchased from Conoco, where did HPLC get the additional 135,000?  
Sitara shows HPLC IM Wellhead.    Joanie Ngo says TXU is saying they bought 
155,000.   I am trying to back track to the purchase invoices to see what we 
were invoiced.

Just want to pat each of you on the back, and express my appreciation to each 
of you for taking time out of your schedules to meet yesterday.  The results 
of our time exceeded my expectations in that I feel we had quality discussion 
and also identified some ideas and solutions to put in place quickly.  Each 
of you contributed concerns and discussion ideas in a very professional and 
positive manner.   I also realize we have some follow-up to do, and would 
like for us to schedule our next time to meet.  I don't want to establish 
these discussions as "quarterly" or "monthly" meetings at this point - I'm 
not sure what frequency would be appropriate.  We can discuss it further as a 
team.  However, I know we at least one more session and I don't want much 
time to elapse before we reconvene. 

Yvette:  Would look at a time when everyone would be availble in March, 
preferably the week of 3/6, 3/13 or 3/20.  This may be difficult to schedule 
as Daren will be working around a new baby, and others are working around 
vacation time.  I anticipate a similar structure to yesterday's, but am very 
open to other's ideas.  Please let Yvette know if you some other idea.

I also want to express my appreciation to Yvette for organizing the 
afternoon.  She did a great job!!!

Thanks to each of you!!

Megan

As I mentioned to you yesterday, it still looks like the volumes for gas delivered to TX GLO do not have Linda Robert's origination fee deducted.  Do we need to execute a PMA with TXGLO to deduct those volumes from the next delievery?

Also isn't there an entry that is missing in your file to capture the $ cost of gas for the gas delivered to TXGLO?  Is that being captured in Unify or is it being manually entered by Gas Accounting?

Darren
Do we need to execute a seperate deal ticket for the origination deduct?

Susan/Laynie
What busines unit are these cost centers rolling up to (11814 & 27117?)

I reviewed the gas deals on Franks' spreadsheet and they agree with what is in Sitara.  As soon as I have the October gas numbers, I will forward them to you.

Attached is a spreadsheet of the TGLO deals booked to the GL to help you with our current settlement position.  It is divided by debit/credit entries.  When the sales are booked, a debit hits the customer account to create the open sale to apply the cash to and a credit hits the revenue account (40004000 third party; 40005000 intercompany) for the profit center.  

Below is a summary of where we are on the sale dollars to EGM.  I have already sent an email to risk to update the demand fees for the prior months and to book Aug and Sept crude.  I will wait for the go ahead from Frank before I final them to the GL.    Let me know if you have any questions.

Status of Sales to EGM
Cleared invoices		$3,905,963.20

to extend the deal or maybe there should be another deal in place.   This 
deal 155118 is valid on 1/26/00 only, but the rest of the volume you are 
looking for is scheduled on days 1/27 - 1/31.    I am sure there is no 
pricing on those days.  

I will let you know as soon as I hear from them.

Please make sure that Gary gets a copy of the Industrial spreadsheet.  Nobody

 First of the month  industrials are coming along fine.  I will finalize my 
pathing tomorrow, Thursday,  and set up buybacks and swings by the
    end of day Friday.
 
     The industrial "Buyback & Deficiency Deals" worksheet  has captured the 
necessary data to help Gas Control & the on-call scheduler as well as  
      myself and Client Services.
      I  will have a preliminary worksheet done by the end of day Friday.
 
      I am on vacation during the week of July 5th thru July 10th.

When will the buybacks and swings be set up for July?  I am a little 
concerned with the long weekend coming up.  I believe that we agreed that 
these would be set up by the 3rd work day, which would be Friday the 7th.  
(Six days of flow.)  I definitely don't think that we should any later.  It 
would be great if this could be handled sooner, miimizing our economic impact.

Additionally, we need to get the Industrial spreadsheet up and running 
again.  This report is very beneficial to Gas Control, industrial traders and 
schedulers on call.

Let me know what you think.

This is now the new policy. Please email justification to me when hiring replacements. Consider all alternatives before automatically re-hiring and also carefully consider the level you need to hire.

As you can see any additional hires require multiple sign-offs and will require a face to face meeting with me before proceeding.

Let me know if you have any questions. 

Tks - Bob

Subject:	Filling vacancies and adding head count

After my recent budgeting experience, I think we need to tighten up our procedures around filling vacancies and adding head count.

When filling vacancies, I would like to have each of you review the positions.  I think we need to challenge ourselves and the managers
to be as conservative as possible.  I would like to sign off on all replacements.  I promise not to be difficult.

When adding personnel over your current budgeted number, besides having the commercial team sign-off on the addition, I am think
that it may have to be approved by the COO of Americas (Louise).  I am planning on meeting with her next week to discuss in detail
how to keep her in the loop in new hires resulting from business changes (asset management deals or service arrangements)

Let me know what you think.

thanks

I combined the tickets for the Southern Union plants at Port Arthur and 
Galveston for April forward to accurately reflect the contract.  The new 
Sitara number is 224490, and the old numbers are: 17832 and109216. This 
change will allow for a more accurate estimate in our P&L as well as more 
accurate invoicing. I believe that this change will reduce our monthly 
variances due to these deals.   If you have any questions or concerns please 
feel free to give me a call

I am working on clearing an old TXU Lone Star/Gas Distribution balance from 
8/99 and 9/99.  We originally billed TXU on nominated quantities and they 
have shortpaid us due to meter adjustments.  These are brokered deals where 
we sold to TXU and purchased from ExxonMobil and Highland.  TXU has provided 
meter support since the deals were on Lone Star pipeline, however, I am 
unsure how to have Volume Management reallocate.  

For example, we originally sold 10,000 mmbtu on 8/3/99 to TXU and purchased 
1,200 mmbtu from Highland Energy and 8,800 mmbtu from ExxonMobil.  TXU shows 
the total amount of gas on 8/3/99 was 9,240 mmbtu.  How should the purchase 
piece be allocated between ExxonMobil and Highland since this was a brokered 
deal?

August 1999:

Sale
TXU Electric & Gas  deals# 104975, 104256, 104738
Lone Star Gas Co. deal# 101985
Purchase
ExxonMobil Corp. deal#101522
Highland Energy Co. deal#101530

September 1999:

Sale
TXU Electric & Gas deal#109046
Purchase
ExxonMobil Corp. deals#101522, 108564
Highland Energy Co. deals#101530, 108146


Please let me know if I need to speak with someone else about this.  Thanks 
for your help.

I need the following........

Assume we are in the new building and we have technical problems that force us out of the building either due to IT connection issues or problems with the building itself (AC, power, etc.). If we do have to leave the plan is to have the 30th floor completely available in this building as a backup for both the gas and power side. Obviously space is limited so what we will do is only bring the people that need to be in the building to get noms out and send the others home to handle business remotely. One approach is to take the EDI pipes and have them go to the 30th floor to ensure they have the support and quicker system then if they did their noms from home. Using this approach, and considering the space constraint please give me the number of desks you will need on the 30th floor. I'm open to suggestions so if you have a different approach or some good ideas feel free to share them. I need this by Friday 7/27 no later than noon. 


Tks - Bob

During the first six months after the move to the new building, IT has recommended that the 30th floor be maintained in case of any emergency.  
What we have to do is come up with the list of critical personnel.  There will be very limited seating, 

These should be just the people to finish the day when ever that happens.

Let's get together tomorrow and discuss.

thanks

Kellie-

I researched the statements you sent me and found deal ticket #109925 in 
Sitara which shows HPLC transporting on Midcon from Live Oak to Hardy Street 
for $.04/mm for the months of August and September.

The statement for November covers gas moving from Katy tailgate to Cogen 
Lyondell and is covered by Sitara deal ticket #133257.  The deal ticket shows 
a zero rate, however.  Elsa/Daren- do either of you remember this deal?  It 
was on November 30th for 5000mm.  Kellie- what is Midcon charging for this 
haul?

Thanks.

Mary-

Pursuant to your request, I reviewed FERC orders discussing seasonal rates.  
Based on what I found, Dan was right, it does not seem that seasonal rates 
are prohibited.  If proposed, however, seasonal rates must be cost 
justified.  I did not come across any particular discussion of what kinds of 
proof are necessary (you had asked about the time period for actual sales and 
elasticity of demand).  I have included a few paragraphs below from FERC 
orders that discuss seasonal rates, which may be useful to you.  Please let 
us know if you would like us to look into this any further.  Andrea

Related to 205/206

ALJ-DEC, 35 FERC ?63,076, Union Electric Company, Docket No. ER84-560-000, 
(June 04, 1986)
[65,264]

 It might be noted that UE could have established a seasonal/time-of-day rate 
with cost justification or by explaining its departure from cost-based rates. 
In Commonwealth Edison, the Presiding Judge rejected a higher seasonal demand 
charge for the summer because it was not cost justified. He also held, 
however, that where the rate design is not intended to reflect costs, the 
applicant "must justify the departure from cost-based rates. 18 C.F.R. o35.
13(b)(4)(iii)." 15 FERC ?63,048, at p. 65,229 (1981).

UE made a valiant effort to comply. It attempted to relate the off-peak costs 
to on-peak by its 50 percent discount argument and reference to its Exhibits 
UE-28 and UE-19. These exhibits amply justify the on-peak costs but offer no 
cost support for the off-peak discount. This discount is chosen as a matter 
of judgment. A similar proposal was rejected by the Presiding Judge in 
Commonwealth Edison. Id.

Although the argument of a "free ride" deserves consideration, based on the 
record we have here and in the absence of a detailed cost justification, UE's 
off-peak demand charge is rejected.

 REVERSED - see next paragraph

COMM-OPINION-ORDER, 40 FERC ?61,046, Union Electric Company, Docket No. 
ER84-560-000, (July 20, 1987)

Union's proposal to assess a capacity charge for off-peak service under 
specified circumstances (when a customer's off-peak demand exceeds twice its 
highest measured peak demand) not only reflects the fact that customers use 
the company's production and transmission plant off-peak and capacity-related 
costs are incurred during those times, but also recognizes the equity 
consideration created by the existence of the peak shaving option to certain 
customers. Upon consideration of the evidence presented and the merits of the 
arguments raised by the parties, we reverse the judge's ruling and allow the 
off-peak billing demand provision. Although we are approving Union's use of 
an off-peak billing demand provision, the Commission nevertheless believes 
that a strong incentive continues to exist for customers to peak shave and, 
thus, realize cost savings. Furthermore, although we adopt Union's approach 
as reasonable within the context of this case, this is not to say that only 
such an approach is appropriate or that this approach is preferred.



COMM-OPINION-ORDER, 11 FERC ?61,083, Florida Power Corporation, Docket No. 
ER80-206, (Apr. 25, 1980)
urging rejection of FPC's proposed rate increase.

On February 12, 1980, the Public Service Commission of the State of Florida 
filed a letter noting the absence of proposals relating to peak load pricing 
(time-of-day and seasonal rate differentials) in FPC's submittal. 5 The 
Public Service Commission urged our review of the issues of time-of-day and 
seasonal pricing in this proceeding.

We note that the questions of time-of-day and seasonal pricing are proper 
subjects for the hearing ordered below if any party chooses to pursue them, 
including the Florida Commission should it petition to intervene late in this 
proceeding.

COMM-OPINION-ORDER, 6 FERC ?61,292, Commonwealth Edison Company, Docket No. 
ER79-182, (Mar. 30, 1979)
[61,695]

Our review of Commonwealth's filing indicates that the proposed rates have 
not been shown to be just and reasonable and may be unjust, unreasonable, 
unduly discriminatory or otherwise unlawful. Therefore, we shall accept the 
proposed rates for filing and suspend those rates for five months, to become 
effective, subject to refund, on September 1, 1979.

We note with interest that the proposed rates are designed on a time-of-day 
and seasonal basis. The Commission has encouraged the use of innovative rate 
design as a way of more closely matching rates to costs and thereby 
minimizing misallocation of resources as well as reducing waste, inequity and 
discrimination. 4 We therefore direct the Presiding Administrative Law Judge 
to insure that the parties fully address the issues raised related to the 
cost support for the time-of-day and seasonal rate design.

FED-REGS, FERCSR ?13,963, FPA, Regulations 18 CFR Sec. 35.13 Filing of

specific application proposed.

(vii) Based upon information reported in Statements BB and BC, the utility 
shall list selected months that are normally the months of greatest 
significance in determining the need of the utility for power supply 
capability throughout the year. All twelve months may be selected, if 
appropriate. In its selection, the utility shall take into account any 
effects of local weather seasons and, particularly, the extent to which peak 
demands may tend to be similar in magnitude in two or more months of a 
weather season. The utility shall explain the reasons for the selections and 
describe the significance for the selections of seasonal variations in the 
weather.

REG-PREAMBLE, FERCSR ?31,044, Inquiry Concerning the Commission's Merger 
Policy Under the Federal Power Act: Policy Statement, Order No. 592, December 
18, 1996, Docket No. RM96-6-000, 18 CFR 2, 61 FR 68595 PART 01 OF 02.
1. Identify the relevant products

The first step is to identify one or more products sold by the merging 
entities. Products may be grouped together when they are good substitutes for 
each other from the buyer's perspective. If two products are not good 
substitutes, an entity with market power can raise the price of one product 
and buyers would have a limited ability to shift their purchases to other 
products. In the past, the Commission has analyzed three products: non-firm 
energy, short-term capacity (firm energy), and long-term capacity. 75 These 
remain reasonable products under the prevailing institutional arrangements, 
and applicants should recognize such products in their analysis. Other 
product definitions may also be acceptable. For example, the lack of on-site 
buyer storage creates products differentiated by time. Thus, peak and 
off-peak energy (seasonal and daily) may be distinct products.


ALJ-DEC, 15 FERC ?63,048, Commonwealth Edison Company, Docket Nos. ER79-182 
and ER80-106, (June 03, 1981) PART 02 OF 02.

 It is Commission policy that rate design reflect cost incurrence, Idaho 
Power Co., Opinion No. 13, issued May 4, 1978, mimeo at 26; Minnesota Power 
and Light Co., Opinion No. 12, issued April 14, 1978, mimeo at 24-5.

[65,229]


In both cases, the Commission rejected rate design features where there was 
no evidence in the record showing that the rate design features reflected 
cost incurrence, id. In its order setting this proceeding for hearing, the 
Commission took note of Edison's proposed seasonal differential and 
specifically directed that the parties fully address the issues related to 
the cost support for the seasonal rate design, Commission Order issued March 
30, 1979, mimeo at 4-5. On October 9, 1980, the parties were directed by the 
Presiding Judge to identify in their initial briefs the portions of the 
record that relate to cost support for the seasonal differential.

The requirement that Edison provide cost support for its seasonal 
differential, as discussed supra, is also set forth in the Commission's 
filing requirements for rate schedules: if the rate design is intended to 
reflect costs, the applicant must show how it reflects costs; if the rate 
design is not intended to reflect costs, the applicant must justify the 
departure from costbased rates, 18 CFR o35.13(b)(4)(iii) Statement P. 
Edison's seasonal differential is intended to lessen the costs imposed upon 
it by its prominent summer peak. Edison reasons that, since it must build 
capacity to meet its prominent summer peak, charging more in the summer would 
give customers an incentive to control their summer demands and, therefore, 
Edison's cost of adding capacity would be reduced (Tr. 169). Accordingly, 
Edison must show how its seasonal differential reflects the costs imposed on 
it by summer demand, under the Commission's filing requirements in 18 CFR o35.
13(b)(4)(iii) Statement P. Further, even PURPA Section 111(d)(4) relied upon 
by Edison states that rates "shall be on a seasonal basis which reflects the 
costs of providing service to such class of consumers at different seasons of 
the year to the extent that such costs vary seasonally for such utility." 
(Emphasis added.)

Further, support for relying on marginal rather than average costs comes from 
the Commission itself. In its order of March 30, 1979 setting this cause for 
hearing, mimeo at 4, 5, the Commission, in commenting on time of day and 
seasonal rates, mentioned that it encourage innovative rate design to match 
more closely rates to costs. In this regard, the Commission cited its Order 
No. 537, supra at 4, which specifically suggests use of pricing mechanisms 
based on marginal cost principles

[65,236]

for jurisdictional wholesale sales. Under the circumstances in this case, 
where the sale of economy energy is related to Edison's costs in adding or 
eliminating additional excess capacity, it is appropriate to establish the 
price for economy transactions on marginal costs. This provides a more close 
matching of the rate to the cost than would a rate design based on average 
costs. Accordingly, Winnetka's position on pricing of economy energy will not 
be adopted.

 AFFIRMED and REVERSED - see next paragraph

COMM-OPINION-ORDER, 23 FERC ?61,219, Commonwealth Edison Company, Docket Nos. 
ER79-182-000 and ER80-106-000, (May 12, 1983)
Turning to Commonwealth's exceptions, we find that the judge correctly 
rejected the seasonal differential. Even if we accept the company's 
interpretation of PURPA, it still has not cited any record evidence 
whatsoever of a difference in costs between summer and nonsummer months. 
Without at least some showing of a cost difference, it is impossible to make 
a judgment on the reasonableness of the company's 15.25% proposal. We 
therefore uphold the judge on this point.

We reverse the judge's adoption of a price set at 110% of the utility's 
incremental costs, however, and approve the type-B split-savings method 
proposed by Commonwealth. Under this method, economy transactions are 
arranged for a 12-hour or similar period at a fixed price based on cost 
estimates at the time of the agreement. If the utility's incremental costs 
rise to the point that continued supply would become burdensome, the utility 
may terminate supply. We find this method superior to that proposed by staff 
in that implementation is greatly simplified. Cost determinations need not be 
made as frequently.

and Transmission Rate Adjustments and Extensions, December 31, 1980, 10 CFR 
903, 45 FR 86976
[36,741]

Historically, many PURPA-type standards have been used in designing wholesale 
rates for the sale of Federal hydroelectric power. PMAs analyze costs to 
establish revenue requirements and consider this information in designing 
rates. Declining block rates for energy were once used by the PMAs but 
subsequently were found inappropriate and eliminated from rate schedules. 
Many of the PMAs for years have been effectively using various forms of load 
management measures in their rate schedules, such as scheduling limitations, 
loadshaping, capacity and energy overrun charges, etc. BPA has had a history 
of using seasonal rates for wholesale firm capacity and energy and also 
offered its direct service industrial customers interruptible rates some time 
ago. Southwestern has had interruptible capacity rates in effect since 1957. 
These examples demonstrate the willingness of the PMAs to implement 
PURPA-type standards where applicable.

Many of these PURPA-type standards, when applied appropriately in the design 
of PMA rates, can serve to implement the purposes of PURPA by encouraging 
conservation of energy, efficient use of resources and facilities, and 
equitable rates. The public participation process will provide an opportunity 
to examine these and other appropriate concepts.

The PMAs will continue to review and revise their power marketing practices 
on a system-by-system basis to serve the PURPA objectives. The Assistant 
Secretary for Resource Applications, working with the Administrators of the 
power administrations, and after receiving public comment, will consider the 
adoption of rate design guidelines, similar in form to the guidelines in RA 
6120.2 on financial accounting and ratemaking, which will reflect the 
experience gained by the PMAs in their system-by-system approach to rate 
design.

FED-LAW, FERCSR ?5021, PURPA, SEC. 111. CONSIDERATION AND DETERMINATION 
RESPECTING CERTAIN RATEMAKING STANDARDS.

 (4) Seasonal rates.--The rates charged by an electric utility for providing 
electric service to each class of electric consumers shall be on a seasonal 
basis which reflects the costs of providing service to such class of 
consumers at different seasons of the year to the extent that such costs vary 
seasonally for such utility.

FED-REG-NOTICE, FERCSR ?37,503, DOE Responsibilities Under Title I of PURPA

(4) Seasonal rates shall be established where costs vary by season;

PROP-REG-PREAMBLE, FERCSR 1988-1998 ?32,457, Administrative Determination of 
Full Avoided Costs, Sales of Power to Qualifying Facilities, and 
Inter-connection Facilities, March 16, 1988, Docket No. RM88-6-000, 53 FR 
9331, 55 FR 31882

Pricing flexibility may take several different forms. For instance, a 
contract could provide QFs with a price floor applicable to all the power 
supplied to the utility, but still provide for higher variable unit prices 
reflecting daily or seasonal periods. The price floor would provide the 
revenue stream necessary for the QF to secure financial support while

[32,174]
 
the price variability would induce the QF to maximize deliveries in peak-load 
periods when the utility values additional supplies most. Of course, the 
price floor should not exceed the minimum value of the utility's avoided 
cost. Similarly, a contract could provide for a two part price--a fixed 
payment for capacity and an energy price for power delivered. The QF would be 
assured a minimum revenue stream based on the value of its capacity. The 
variable energy component would allow the utility to dispatch the QF capacity 
only when it was economic. Whatever the pattern of contract payments, rates 
for purchases from QFs should always reflect how well the characteristics of 
the suppliers' power match the purchasing utility's need. This will ensure 
that the QF will make most production decisions on the basis of rates 
reflecting avoided costs (rather than the guaranteed average rate) and, at 
the same time, will receive revenues sufficient to attract investors.

To avoid problems such as those associated with take-or-pay contracts in the 
natural gas industry, the Commission wishes to stress the danger of including 
forecasted fuel costs in the fixed rate structure of long-term contracts, 
especially in combination with the specification of minimum purchase 
quantities. The Commission also encourages the use of time-of-day and 
seasonal rates in flexible pricing structures for long-term contracts.


REG-PREAMBLE, FERCSR 1977-1981 ?30,128, Small Power Production and 
Cogeneration Facilities; Regulations Implementing Section 210 of the Public 
Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, Order No. 69, February 25, 1980, 
Docket No. RM79-55, 18 CFR 292, 45 FR 12214, 45 FR ...

Rather than specifying that exact time-of-day or seasonal rates for purchases 
are required, however, the Commission believes that the selection of a 
methodology is best left to the State regulatory authorities and nonregulated 
electric utilities charged with the implementation of these provisions.

	Deal # 649741 is a 05/01 sale to BP Energy. BP is claiming that this deal should have been invoiced by HPL and not ENA. My contact also claims that this was confirmed by Gary Lamphier. I am not sure if Gary is with ENA or HPL. Is this something you can look into or do I need to send this to someone else?

Because of a timing issue with Client Services, I have fixed deal 157288, 
separating the Carthage meter to a new ticket.  That ticket is 229758.  The 
price for the Carthage is suppose to be IF HSC - .06.

Stacy:  I will need Feb pathed ASAP so Volume Mgmt can get the volumes 
moved.  Client Services needs to get this invoice out today.

This problem, among others with this exchange deal, is currently we have a 
massive A/R issue and we're trying to get this cleanup before end of month.

If you have any questions, please feel free to call me.

Daren,

The above mentioned meter (delivery) shows a small flow of 24 dec. on 
2-1-00.  The sitara deal (151694) has a stop date of 1/31/2000.

Can you please extend the deal thru 2-1-00 to cover this small volume?

Thanks

There were also many financial deals that were killed, but I hope that does not matter to Unify.

Jay,

Let's not assume what impact this will have. Even though it is better to zero out deals we(VM) wouldn't want to go in and zero out 2000 deals. 

We do have a few questions.

I would like to discuss what minimal impact is? How do you know what impact this will have? Is there a reason this will have little impact? Do all of these D2D deals have zero volume associated with them?
Who decided to do this?
Why are we doing this?
What time span are we talking (Production months/Year)
Let's determine the impact if any?

I would like to meet with you guys and get more detail on why we are doing this and determine the impact?

thanks,
m.m.

Jay,

If a deal is killed it poses a problem for us in Unify if there are any paths associated with the deal; therefore, we request the deals be zeroed out.  Call me if this is a problem.  Also, we would appreciate further details on why these deals are being killed.  

In addition, I have copied Rita and Mark from Volume Management for their input.

We need to discuss further.  My concern would be that how do we know what % 
HPL should be retaining at a compressor or zone to make sure we recoup our 
fuel cost ?  Also, could allocated fuel cause a contract imbalance?  I think 
that Pipeline Operations can handle the scheduling of third party fuel 
retainage.  But, if we retain fuel on ENA transports, then we need to come up 
with a plan to nominate this in Marketing Operations to Houston Pipeline.  
Currently, this process is not in place.

Brenda,

As you know fuel is a big risk.  One of the things we are trying to do is get 
the shipper to pay fuel.  This would mean we would purchase, transport and 
possibly sell gas with a fuel percentage as part of the price.  Can the 
downstream systems, scheduling etc handle this?

Daren,

I hate to be a pest but here's the deal on the above two meters:

98-1600  Sitara deal #159194 expired on 2/29/2000.  The flow for 2/2000 was 
on the 215K.  This meter (del.) flowed 53.863 for 3/2000.  There is no   new 
deal referenced, nor is the evergreen flag in effect.

98-6725  Sitara deal #214948 expired 3/27/2000.  No evergreen and no new deal 
referenced.  This is a little premature but this meter is active   monthly 
and I'm thinking that it will flow for this month with no K being applied.

Thanks

On 5/31/2000 the above meter has recorded flow of 16 Mmbtus from HPL's 
pipeline.   Deal #254839 was at the meter prior, but it expired on 5/21/00.  
Currently, the volume is booked to HPL Strangers Gas Contract.  Logistics 
needs either (1) have Deal #254839 extended, (2) new deal, or (3) approval to 
writeoff these volumes to Unaccounted for Gas.  (Please print, sign, and 
return original to Clem Cernosek).

NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
Breaking News : posted Sep 26, 4:16 PM
Proposed Rule Extends Marketing Affiliate Regulations to All Affiliates 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commissioners Wednesday agreed to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking broadening the application of standards of conduct for transmission providers, including both natural gas pipelines and power lines, to require separation of the regulated monopolies from any other company affiliate. 
Previously, the rules simply required creation of a firewall, including separate operations in separate locations staffed by separate personnel, between gas pipelines and their marketing affiliates. The proposed rule would wall off both gas and electric transmission operations from any other affiliate, gas or electric, including financial affiliates. 
The Commission was presented with two options regarding the application of the proposed rule to electric transmission affiliates, which still in many cases have bundled operations. One option would enforce complete separation, while a second would have exempted employees who deal in sales or purchases of bundled retail native load. Staff and Commissioners Wood, William Massey and Nora Brownell appeared to favor walling off all affiliated personnel, so they would not be privy to market information about transmission operations that other non-affiliated competitors did not have access to. 
Commissioner Linda Breathitt, however, argued for exempting personnel dealing solely with retail native load. Breathitt said that while she supported the eventual separation of the entities, she was concerned about the timing. "I see no compelling reason at this time; there have been no complaints and no evidence." She said she thought state commissions might consider the move an infringement on their jurisdiction. "I agree with concept philosophically, but I think there will be other opportunities later on, after we do a little more bridge-building with state commissions." 
Wood said he understood "the political issue here with respect to federal-state relations, but I think this is an opportunity for discrimination that ought to be eliminated." Staff pointed out that if there were any problems with transmission reliability or if some small utilities had problems, waivers could be granted. Staff was questioned by the commissioners as to how much information was available to affiliate personnel. "If I am an affiliate employee dealing solely with retail native load, I can go into the control room and get all the information I want," one staffer responded. 
Wood proposed, and the commissioners ratified, a proposed rule with no exceptions, but which makes clear that in the final rule the Commission may reverse field and determine that separation of employees dealing with sales of native load is not required. Commenting parties should provide cost/benefit analysis on both sides of the question. State commissions are also invited to comment. Wood had suggested the Commission extend the separation to all sales employees, "but make it clear that if we don't hear from people that they really want this separation, we ain't going to do it."

Brenda,

As you know fuel is a big risk.  One of the things we are trying to do is get 
the shipper to pay fuel.  This would mean we would purchase, transport and 
possibly sell gas with a fuel percentage as part of the price.  Can the 
downstream systems, scheduling etc handle this?

Karen,
The charts for station 985892 - Katy GU2 are mail outs and are not in the 
office at this time for us to review.
I have asked Jackie Birch to retrieve December 2000 & January 2001 and let us 
know when they arrive and 
we will follow up at that time on what if anything needs to be done.

Daren:

Sorry it has taken so long to get back to this issue, I am with EES now.  
Karen Lindley allocates this point but I feel the need to help her because 
this issue came to light while I was in transition.

Exxon allocates this point and we receive a allocation statement from them on 
a monthly basis.

December 2000
The total flow at the meter was 646 MMBtu.  I copied Esther Garcia on this 
e-mail so that she can look into the possibility that there is a measurement 
error.  Esther will need to respond to Karen on the matter of the possible 
measurement error.  Furthermore it seems odd to me that scheduling had 8,928 
MMBtu confirmed at this point and only 646 MMBtu flowed.  I would ask Mark 
where he got his confirmed volumes from.  As a temporary fix I reallocated 
the meter and gave the total flow to Alpine Resources.  They will be short 
paid in their minds until Ester and Karen can get the possible measurement 
error issue resolved.  I would also suggest that Mark and Karen get together 
to review the scheduling of this point so that Karen can call Exxon to 
reconcile their allocation with what we have (the additional Alpine deal) at 
this point.  Charlene can redraft her invoice on Monday 2/26/01 that will 
show the 646 MMBtu going to Alpine.

January 2001
Again scheduling has 9,193 confirmed at this meter when on 3,241 MMBtu 
flowed.  I temporarily reallocated the meter so that the entire volume that 
flowed went to Alpine.  They remain 10 MMBtu short paid but Charlene can 
redraft her invoice and pay them something until Mark (validity of other 
deals at this point) and Karen (Exxon's allocation of this point) can get 
this issue resolved.

There is also the issue with the Exxon transport at this point that was 
scheduled at 1,500 MMBtu per month for the months in question.  This 
transport affects the allocation at the King Ranch tailgate on the Exxon 024 
contract.  I copied Howard Camp who will be training the contractor that will 
take my place in Volume Management so that he can stay on top of the 
resolution of this issue.

3,251 mmbtu's for January 2001 .  This is on the Katy Gas Unit.  If anyone

This deal was not put in right.  The primary term of the contract goes out to 
9/30/00.  There is no evergreen to the contract.  The deal will end when the 
contract ends.  Therefore, I have taken the evergreen off, and added 
September to it.

If you have any questions, let me know.

I would think that the first contract should go the AEP.  ENA won't be selling to Equistar
off of Channel for at least three months.  ENA will have to get a transport agreement with
HPL or Channel.

On the second contract:  Is HPL making the sale or ENA?  Is it a sale that is going
to AEP.  I know we are serving a small Entex point off of Oasis.  Is that for convenience,
can HPL sever the point some other way?

Someone let me hear what you think.

thanks

bob

I spoke with Daren and there are a few contracts that he was aware of:

1. Channel -  012-15600-02-069	ENA using HPL's capacity - selling to Equistar on Channel

2. Oasis and PGEV - HPL is using ENA's capacity

3.  Tejas Ship and Tejas Gas - Daren says we don't do business often on these pipes as ENA, but we always have the possibility that we will at any time, so ENA would need it's own transport contracts

Let me know if anyone has questions.  Thanks!

Hi Daren,

I'm afraid I don't understand what you are asking me to do.  Do you mean that 
you want CC 105633 moved to Logistics PC 12667.  If so, there is a 
complicated process in order to do so.  Has someone else made this request or 
is this your own?  Please explain.

Attached is a revised allocation file for October.  Please note that the 
format of this file has been changed to reflect the new team reporting list.  
Also, "Global Markets" and "Industrial Markets" have been broken out for 
billing purposes.  If you have cost centers that are allocating to either of 
these teams, please provide a breakdown of those percentages by Monday, 
November 6th.

All other allocations are due by end of day today.

I have also included the team reporting list that is currently in use until 
the end of 2001. 

Thank you for your help.  Please call if you have any additional questions.

Daren - thank you for the list of the true, remaining ENA sales customers.  I 
have been researching your list & getting the contractual volumes that Brenda 
needs.  I am confused about Praxair though.

The sales contract between ENA & Praxair was assigned to HPLC eff/ 10/1/99.  
The only remaining contract between ENA & Praxair is a Master Financial 
Agreement.

Does Praxair really need to remain under ENA or is it okay under HPLC?  If it 
really needs to be under ENA, we will need to un-do the 10/1/99 assignment to 
HPLC or set-up a new contract between ENA & Praxair.

Please advise.

Cheryl, 

The counterparties with which ENA currently sales gas are:

City of Brazoria
Central Illinois Light Company
D & H Gas Company, Inc.
Markham Gas 
Merit Energy Partners
Praxair
Reliant Energy - Entex
Reliant Energy - HL&P
Southern Union Company
Texas Utilities Fuel Company (Now TXU Fuel Co)
Union Carbide Corporation
Unit Gas Transmission Company Inc


ENA has transacted with the other companies listed below, but that will most 
likely not happen again.  (HPL will trade with those counterparties.)

All ENA trades on HPL will be in Sitara.  We have reports which can be 
generated out of CPR that can list all deals by counterparty for ENA.  Let me 
know if you need something like that.  

Let me know if you have any other questions.

Just to update you on this project's status:

Based on a new report that Scott Mills ran for me from Sitara, I have come up 
with the following counterparties as the ones to which ENA is selling gas off 
of HPL's pipe.

Altrade Transaction, L.L.C.   Gulf Gas Utilities Company
Brazoria, City of     Panther Pipeline, Inc.
Central Illinois Light Company   Praxair, Inc.
Central Power and Light Company  Reliant Energy - Entex
CES - Equistar Chemicals, LP   Reliant Energy - HL&P
Central Illinois Light Company  Southern Union Company
D & H Gas Company, Inc.   Texas Utilities Fuel Company
Duke Energy Field Services, Inc.  TXU Gas Distribution
Entex Gas Marketing Company   Union Carbide Corporation
Equistar Chemicals, LP    Unit Gas Transmission Company Inc.


Since I'm not sure exactly what gets entered into Sitara, Pat Clynes 
suggested that I check with Daren Farmer to make sure that I'm not missing 
something (which I did below).  While I am waiting for a response from him 
and/or Mary Smith, I will begin gathering the contractual volumes under the 
above contracts.

Subject: ENA Sales on HPL

I am working on a project for Brenda Herod & was wondering if one of you 
could tell me if I'm on the right track & if this will get everything for 
which she is looking.

She is trying to draft a long-term transport/storage agreement between ENA & 
HPLC which will allow ENA to move the gas to their markets.  In order to 
accomplish this, she needs to know all of the Sales to customers that ENA is 
doing off of HPL's pipe.

I had Scott Mills run a report from Sitara showing all ENA Buy/Sell Activity 
on HPL since 7/99.  If I eliminate the Buys & the desk-to-desk deals, will 
this give me everything that I need?

Are there buy/sell deals done with ENA on HPL's pipe that wouldn't show up in 
Sitara?  Someone mentioned something about deals where HPL transports the gas 
on it's own behalf then ENA sells it to a customer at that same spot  --  
?????  Do deals like that happen? Would they show up in Sitara?

Is there anything else that I'm missing?  I'm not real familiar with how some 
of these deals happen nowadays so am very receptive to any 
ideas/suggestions/help that you can offer !!!

Thanks in advance.

Hello,

We are starting to prepare the February data for our model.  Please provide a 
completed "Hours" survey for each position within your group.  This survey 
will collect the the time your team spent on performing their activities in 
the month of February.  

At the top of the spreadsheet, you will see a box labeled "Select Your RC".  
Click on the box and input your RC number, which will need to be 4 digits.
Once you have done this, another box will appear with the message "Select 
Position from Drop Box!" You can then select the position (i.e., staff, 
specialist, etc.) and "OK". The choices for positions are based on 
information contained in the Org Database (i.e., if a position is not listed 
that should be, please call me to discuss as it would indicate that 
corrections need to be made to the database).  Once you have the list of 
activities, please input hours (for the entire month) for each activity 
listed in the column labeled "Hours".
If you're filling out the survey for your team, save a file for each of the 
positions you fill out for your team prior to filling out the next position.  
If you do not, the information will be lost.

We have included January compiled hours per position (if you had two 
specialists performing the same activity - 20 hours each, the "Last Month" 
column would show a total of 40 hrs for that month).  As with last month, you 
have the option to complete the survey on behalf of your entire group or send 
this survey to each of your team members, allowing each individual to fill 
out the time they spent on each activity.  If there are any activities you 
perform not included in your survey, please contact me as soon as possible 
for a copy of the Activity Dictionary.

Please return these surveys by end of day Friday, March 3rd.  If this is a 
problem, please notify immediately.

Thanks,
Shari

On 9/15/99, the above meter recorded flow of 2,476 Mmbtus.  There was Deal 
#113050 at the meter for 9/14/99 , but it expired on 9/14/99.  Logistics 
needs either (1) Deal #113050 extended to cover 9/15/99;  (2) a new deal to 
record these volumes; or (3) Logistics needs approval to writeoff these 
volumes to Unaccounted for Gas.  (Please print, sign, and return original to 
Clem Cernosek).

Aimee, 
Are you confirming these volumes with HL&P?  We have been doing some special 
deals at Green's Bayou and the HL&P dealmaker has been calling to find out 
what the volumes are.  I do not think he communicates with his scheduler, is 
that the case?  Anyway, we need to agree with HL&P on what volumes flowed on 
these special days and get them into the system so they can be billed 
correctly.

Aimee-

Gas control has some line work scheduled for 1/4,5,6 that will affect the 
referenced point.  Dynegy has nom'd 1800 at this point which I'm assuming 
they'll want baseload for January.  The desk also appears to have some gas 
nom'd out here (approx 1200mm).   Rather than cut these volumes, would you 
try to negotiate with Koch not to flow this gas during the outage, but to 
make it up as soon as the outage is over (they may be able to begin flow on 
1/6)?  Please let me know as soon as possible.

Thanks.

March a total of   3804 flowed (delivery) and for April it's averaging about 
100/day as a delivery.   in February this was on the  213 contract, deal 
#83088 as a receipt at this delivery meter.  Do we have a deal at this city 
gate to sell Palacios this gas?


THANKS!!!

Daren-
Deal # 421859 Sales
Deal # 421847 Purchase

Settlements is showing both a sales and purchase for Texas General Land 
Office and they are stating that they should not be billed or paid for 
anything. 
Are these deals suppose to be a washout and netted together? 

 If so, the volumes are not matching: the sales on HPL are 7,440 mmbtus on 
deal #421859 and the purchase on MidTX is 6,629 mmbtus. 
Let me know what type of deal this was intended to be. 

FYI
I was told that Tom Acton was handling this deal, but I believe he will be 
out until after Thanksgiving.

Here are the updates for May.  You will notice I have not added the extra 
deals for Equistar Chemical because it didn't effect the whole month, plus I 
only found the split out for the sale upto 4/00 not the purchase.

Subject: Tuesday, December 26th

We will need a small staff to handle potential trades for Wed. the 27th.  
Most of the pipelines are out of the office, so I would expect the work load 
to be minimal.  I plan on coming in, and would like to have a minimum of 
three on staff, so I need two volunteers (one offsystem, just in  case).  If 
anyone is going to be in town, please forward a number, in case we need to 
call any additional people in, or have you work on a laptop from home.  I 
will get with you after the new year to make up the holiday you miss, or, you 
can schedule your day now, I have the calendars.  Also, I will be out on 
vacation Friday, Dec. 22nd and will need someone to send the nominations to 
the plants, I don't expect to have full system coverage, just HPL/HPL and 
HPL/ENA as needed.  Let me know if you are interested in learning how to do 
this.

Thank you,

Mary

Daren,

I was wondering if it would be OK for me to sit in with you one day to get a 
general feel of your end of the process.  Pat had told me before he left that 
it would help me better grasp the process as a whole.

I understand the imminent cold weather is making things crazy, so now may not 
be the best time to be in your way.  But let me know if I can spend a day,  
morning, or even just an afternoon down there with you whenever it is a good 
time.  I think it will help me very much in my role.

Thanks.

Mike

FYI - 

I spoke with Patsy, per Daren's request, regarding a swap with Midcon Texas.  
Patsy agreed to lend us the gas we need at the meter, rather that swap with 
us.  The net effect, after they pay back what HPL parked on them, according 
to Patsy, is a lend of 12,276 MMBtu's.  MTP is going to confirm an addition 
16,903 total to HPL.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Mary

Karen/Sherlyn,

Gary has placed this in Daren's lap.  Please read the below information that 
was requested of me from Daren. 

This is the latest.

I'll get back as soon as I hear from Daren again about my response to him.

On day 5 in MOPS (HPL/ENA) there is a delivery nom of 10.0 pathed to the ENA 
201 K.  On day 16 in MOPS (HPL/ENA) there is not a deal (which is strange 
because day 16 in POPS references Adonis).  The deal on the 5th was a swing 
deal.

Jackie, 

What does MOPS show for the days in question?  It would be incorrect to add 
any days to the Adonis ticket mentioned below.  It sounds as if the meter was 
allocated incorrectly in POPS and/or a deal was not pathed correctly in 
MOPS.  Let me know what you find in MOPS.

Here is the issue for 1/16/99 at meter 984132.   

20,000 mmbtu were confirmed for Adonis in POPS.   10,000 mmbtu on day 5 and 
day 16.   Day 16 is not valid for deal 51862 (track id 6155), which is where 
10,000 was confirmed.   The  actual sale to Adonis was 10,000 which was 
invoiced and paid by Adonis.  We are trying to clear the feedback error 
report.   My question is why was 10,000 confirmed on 1/16/99 if the date is 
not valid for the deal?

When Karen allocates the actual 10,000 it is prorating 5,000 for each day 
that is confirmed (the 5th and 16th).  

Should the whole 10,000 be allocated to the 5th or should 5,000 be allocated 
to each day?   If 5,000 should be allocated to each day, the 16th needs to be 
added to the deal.

Just following up to my week ago note.

Rest assured I know how hectic things have been around here and how many 
irons you have in your fire. Time for my issues are, I'm sure, a lower 
priority.

Let me offer a thought or two.

I don't have enough challenges at the moment to hold my interest. 

 I had asked for next Wed and Thurs. off. Let's toss in Fri also. My 
expectation is you would have a plan by the time I would come back, Monday 
the 7th. I hate to be a pest but you need to get a better value for the 
paltry salary $'s you are paying me. Maybe a Tues-Thurs. week would work 
better for each of us. Or if things are going the way they seem to be;  you 
don't need me at all.

If  you could possibly let me know before the 7th what the plan is I sure 
would appreciate it. 



Thanks,

Ken

P.S. Just in case the plug is pulled on this --- please-- no formal goodbys. 
I will pay my respects to those I want too. I would very much like to just 
fadeout -- ok?

I need HPL Sales and Purchases, back dated to 8/99 between HPL and TECO to 
book any processing revenue or losses.  Apparently this is in addition to the 
current deal in place and is priced at at different rate.  Please let me know

Hi Daren,

I'm attempting to clear the above mentioned meter from an error report 
(Revenue Volume Comparison Report).  Howard apprised me, in a meeting last 
week, that the reason this meter is appearing in the aforementioned report is 
due to no volumes being scheduled in POPS but volumes appearing in MOPS.  The 
volumes @ this meter is for 4449 (Sitara deal tickets 240095 and 227697.  Due 
to this being a "check meter" the volumes will not bridge to POPS from MOPS.  
I'd like to request to revise the nome of 4449 to show "0" instead.  Can you 
approve this modification?

Thanks
-Jackie-

The Texas Gas Group will definitely be rolling out a "Super Peak" 5x8 product 
for gas delivery from 1300 to 2100 CDT.  If we decide to roll out another 
product, probably a "Peak" 5x12 (900 to 2100 CDT) we will let you know 
sometime today.
We will relay the prices to you on Monday.

Steve - 

One issue that immediately comes to mind is the 'General Terms and  
Conditions' ability to handle intra-day nominations. .This may require a new 
Product Type and GTC. 

Are we presently trading this product OTC, or is this unprecedented?

We are finalizing plans to introduce a new gas products(s) for July.  The 
product(s) would be an hourly product either 5x8 or 5x12 or 5x16.  
Even though we have not decided which product to introduce, I thought I would 
give you a heads up to keep you in the loop.

I just spoke briefly with Brian Riley, who is working to restructure the Knig 
Ranch contracts with Exxon, and put Coastal into the loop.  Yesterday I 
forwarded each of you an E-mail from Steve Van Hooser which had drafts of 
contracts attached.  As I talked with Brian, the King Ranch set up as he is 
negotiating will be simplified.  The intent, as I understood it, is that we 
will no longer buy at the wellhead.  Rather, Coastal is entering into a a 
gathering agreement with HPL to buy at the wellhead and ship to the plant.  
HPLC will buy at the tailgate of the plant, net of PVR.  So there will not be 
future settlements with Exxon on liquids.  The paper has not been returned 
from Coastal or Exxon yet, but the deal is effective 4/1/00.  Everything will 
be under new agreements, with receipts and deliveries by different 
counterparties.  The gas flow continues the same, just under new contracts 
and different counterparties.

Daren, Pat and Stella:  Daren, Brian said he would get with you to discuss 
the deal in further detail.  Please include Pat and Stella in the discussion 
also.  The contracts should be reviewed and understood to ensure proper 
scheduling.  As I mentioned to Greg Sharp and Brian, it is critical that we 
be kept in the loop, especially on retroactive deals, as scheduling, 
transport rates and risk are affected.

Thanks to everyone for ensuring the communication lines are in place.

I have a price discrepancy with one of Stacey's deals with Texaco Natural Gas for April 2001.  It is deal 695976 for 12,000/day.  We have it priced at WAHA gas daily + 0.005 and Texaco says it should be WAHA IF + 0.005.  Rick O'Bannion, the trader at Texaco, has confirmed their price.  Can you check this for me and let me know which is correct?

Thanks,
Megan

Ed has requested that we compile a list this morning of all parties/points 
which we owe gas to, in the event that we need to find a home for excess 
volumes today.  Please email me a list of any meters/contracts that you are 
aware of.  I am compiling an interim list based upon the RTU variance report 
for March, however, I don't want to rely on this list as you may be engaged 
in balancing at meters with variances.

Thank you,

Mary

I need help on this one.  I spoke to Gary shortly after he sent this e-mail the other day.  I wasn't sure what to say in the letter regarding how long they would be shut in -- Is there some repair that needs to be done to remedy the situation?  Are we ever going to take the gas again?  Should I tell them that it will remain shut in until the gas meets our specs?

At Gary's suggestion, I called Mike Morris & left a message, but haven't heard back from him.  Therefore, I am sending this e-mail to see if anyone else can give me some advise on the contents of the notification letter that I need to send out.

Thanks in advance for any help that you can give me.

Carlos, I added a line to these deals to include the 29th of February. I 
wanted to let you, so if you have any questions or need anything let me know.
Bryan



The following deals have end dates of 2/28/00 and likely should be 2/29/00.  
Take a look and change if necessary.

Note:  if a financial deal is associated with the deal it will likely need to 
also be changed.

Jeff,

Here are more deals that need to be moved into the bankruptcy books as a result of our contracts auto-terminating.  I hope to finish the list of auto-terminated deals today (if no emergencies arise that pull me off this).

 

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks for being so patient.

Thanks for the info! 

As Greg mentioned in the staff meeting today, the intent is that this 
restructured deal is papered effective 4/1/00.  The impact is potentially 
that the gas is not pathed properly by counterparty or on the appropriate 
transport/gathering agreements, etc.  If any rates are changing, then those 
need to be changed in our systems also.  There may be other areas of changes 
also - I'm not attempting to list them all.  Rather I just want to make 
people aware that retroactive deals can have impacts on the daily operations.

Thanks for the information.

Pat/Daren:  Can you get with Mike and/or Brian to determine the potential 
impact, if any?  Thanks.

Subject: Coastal Deal-With Exxon Participation under the Project Agreement

Brenda,

Per your request, attached are the Draft documents which will be used to 
finalize the new  Gathering Arrangment between HPL and Coastal, the revenue 
sharing arrangement between Exxon and HPL (Transaction Agreement) and the 
Residue Gas Purchase Agreement between Coastal, as Seller and HPL as Buyer 
(Amendment to Wellhead purchase agreeement).  

I do not have a copy of the Processing Agreement between Exxon and Coastal, 
as such agreement does not involve us (and I believe it is far from 
finalized. The only other document that I plan to prepare is a termination 
agreement relative to the current Liquifiables Purchase Agreement between 
Exxon as purchaser and HPL as seller--this termination will be affective as 
of 4/1/2000.

If I can be of any further assistance, please let me know.


Steve

The Popsprd bridge will be migrated to Nahou-Scacl1 on April 26th for 
debugging purposes. This migration should be transparent for Pops users with 
the exception of personal spread sheets using Pops tags. The node name for 
Pops tags on personal spread sheets will need to be changed to Nahou-Scacl1 
to allow for updating of Pops data.


Please call me if you have any questions concerning the migration.

Please plan to attend a meeting with Brian Redmond and Bob Hall on Thursday at 4:00 in conference room 3567.
  Each person should be prepared to discuss the current status of each "Bad Debt" account that was assigned to them in February.

If you are unable to attend you will need to schedule a private meeting with Brian Redmond at a later date.

Daren,

 Hey,  sorry about not calling you last Thur & Fri - I was out sick.  I think 
that were going to have to play this assistance thing on a day to day basis.  
I know I will be catching up for missing those days & I need to get some 
things in order this week for the new guy that starts next week.  So I'll 
just have to call you when I can spare the time.  Sorry for any inconvenience 
this may have caused you!

Thanks,
Kyle

Mike,
I show you pathed deal 951474 on 8/23/01 for production months January and February 2001.  This deal expired 12/31/00, and the late pathing has caused a bridgeback error for January and February 2001.

98-1534 is on the 215K for 3/2000 but is only good for 3/1 - 3/1 in Sitara, 
on deal #163005.  Can you see if it is o.k. to extend the deal for the rest 
of the month?  It has flow every day after the 1st.

98-6725 is also on the 215K for 3/2000.  The Sitara deal # is 214948 and 
covers every day except for day 16.  Can you also see if it is o.k. to extend 
the deal to cover this day?

Thanks

Megan, 

	I found Danny's book and he has the deal priced at 5.25.  I adjusted the price in Sitara.  Let me know if anything further is needed.

For once his is not a Panenergy question.  For sale deal 707274, DEFS says the price on 4/4 should be 5.25 and we have 5.20 in Sitara.  Can you confirm this price for me?

 Desk Managers,

I wanted to follow-up from the staff meeting this week on the item to get a representative from each of the desks, who will be the designated tester in addition to Richard.   Please respond with that person name.

Matt,

It would be helpful to all us to know when you will need these resources so we can manage the workload.  

Regards,

Tammy

All:

We're currently identifying processes that are inefficient and could possibly benefit from being rewritten or not even performed.  Going foward, I would like Bob to appoint a lead business person to whom we could ask questions and or suggest ideas to so that they could in turn validate this information with the desk managers/schedulers.  We had this approach with Nomlogic and having Clarissa work the issues worked quite nicely.  Who ever you choose, we would need about 15% of their time for now.  Later on, with coordination efforts and testing, it may go up to 75%.  I don't see that happening for a while though.

I wanted to let all of you know how you will be charged for Analysts if you 
currently have or will have one in your RC for the year 2000.  The analyst 
program is being handled differently than it was in 1999.  In addition to the 
normal salary, benefits and payroll taxes, you will also be charged an 
overhead administration fee for the program.  You will be charged the 
following MONTHLY amounts for each analyst in the Detail Class code that I 
have indicated below:

Detail Class  Description   Amount
      1  Salaries and Wages                   $4,000
        552  Benefits                         774
        557  Payroll Taxes                         360
        820  Corporate Services                      1,266
    Total MONTHLY Cost                   $6,400 

The $4000 amount represents an average of all analyst salaries and does not 
indicate what the analyst in your RC is paid.  This amount will not change in 
February as the $4000 already includes merit raise information for 2000.

The $1266 represents the overhead costs of administering the program, 
including campus recruiting and office visits.

When you look at your RC report, you will see a line item labeled  "A and A 
Reclass" in each of the Detail Classes identified above.  Enron North America 
is invoiced by Corp. for the costs of all analysts.  Financial Operations 
makes a manual Journal Entry each month to charge the appropriate RC.  Please 
check your January 2000 RC report and make sure you were properly charged for 
the correct number of analysts you have currently.  If there are any errors, 
please let me know as soon as possible so that I can work with Brian Heinrich 
to have it corrected in February.  Please continue to check your RC report 
each month going forward.  Thanks.

If you have any questions, please call me.

Daren,

I am handling CP&L and am trying to resolve this issue from February 
production.  CP&L shows 5,000 mmbtu on February 21, but we do not have a 
deal.  Were you able to find anything out about this?

Can we verified this gas flowed?  If it did it should have been billed on his 
term deal if there was one in place.  If the gas flowed and we did not 
invoice for it on term let me know and I will put it in.

Daren,
Do you have any information on these deals?  We cannot collect the cash from 
Midcon if we can't prove to them the
deals are valid. 

Thanks,

Pat Dresner (accountant) at Midcon Texas says she does not show these deals 
in her system and she can not pay on them.  You created the deals in Sitara 
and I don't have another trader's name.  Could you please talk to your KN 
trader regarding this situation?  If Midcon really got this gas, then someone 
at KN should tell their accountant about the deal.

Prod Mo. Entity     Point  Volume  Total Amount  Sitara #
1/2000  Midcon Texas Gas Services Corp. 0984132 20000  $51,600.00 157006

2/2000  Midcon Texas Pipeline Corp.  0984132 80,000  $206,800.00 170133


Please let me know as soon as possible what you find out.  The 2/2000 
production invoices are due to be paid 3/27.

Thank You,

Darren:
I have a request from Jim Coffey that I hope you can help me with.  He wants to know the cost of supplying the gas to the GLO.  I can follow the ENA deals in path Manager, but I am having a hard time with the HPLC deals.  It looks like we were using gas from the 215 contract.  I can't tell, though, how the gas got to the 215.  Can you tell me where we got the supply for HPLC to sell and at what price?  I need to know for Jan through May.  The GLO deal numbers are below, if you need them.

I decreased volumes at Carthage due to a fire at the East Texas Plant.  Also, 
the co-owner volumes provided were given to me as gross volumes and should 
have been net (after PVR).  I have made changes to reflect the lower volumes. 
The total volume change is approx 5500 (net). Total Carthage decreases from 
90565 to 85148 (net).

Daren - Would there be a problem if I created a desk to desk for meter 378 
for  March 2000 going forward?  It would help out with the allocation 
process.  The kind of deal I need is the total opposite of deal # 115101.  
Please let me know if there is a problem. Volume management would like this 
done today.  Thanls.

The ENA 012-27049-02-002 and HPL 012-41500-02-016 contract are not at Meter

We need the ENA 202 contract as a delivery and the HPL 216 as a receipt.  
Please get the deal in the System this morning and let me know what the deal

I only had one day trade with AEP for May.  I bought 5000 at 4.37 on 5/17.
They may have transacted with Kelly Stevens on the Central desk.

Can we verified this gas flowed?  If it did it should have been billed on his 
term deal if there was one in place.  If the gas flowed and we did not 
invoice for it on term let me know and I will put it in.

Thu,

We have an ongoing issue every month between what we nominate from GEPL into HGPL and on to King Ranch (flows into HGPL at meter 8284) and what is in the system as purchase gas upstream of the meter.  The volume has been anywhere from 6,000 to 10,000/Day over the nomination for at least the past six months.  Would you please fax the meter statements from GEPL for February so that I can try to determine which meters are flowing over what is nominated and verify that we have deals in the system for each offsystem meter.  Should you require a more specific listing, I have Tom's schematic of the area.

Thank you for your time.  Should you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Mary

Attached please find the Hours Survey and Instructions for the month of May, 
2000.

I am sending the survey out this time as an opportunity to introduce myself 
to those of you I have not yet met.  I am being asked to take a direct roll 
in the further development and rollout of the Operations Pricing Model (fka 
Transaction Cost Model).  In the past, I have directed the implementation of 
several pricing systems based on activity based costing similar to the 
Operations Pricing Model (OPM).  Over the past couple of weeks my 
observations of the Model have lead me to be concerned with the quality of 
data used in the model.  It will take efforts by both you and the OPM team to 
get to a satisfactory level of data quality.  This process can start with 
this months data collection efforts.  Please pay particular attention this 
month as the "bar is being raised" by the management of Energy Operations for 
data quality and timeliness.

While completing the survey, take this time to review last month's numbers. 
Please return these surveys to Shari Mao by end of day Friday, June 2.  

Please note the following changes:
The Nat Gas RC's will now see deal validation and transportation rate 
activities therefore, these surveys will be notably longer but will not 
necessarily take more time

If the survey does not contain an activity that your team spends time on, 
PLEASE DO NOT TYPE ANY ACTIVITIES IN THE SURVEY.  Contact Jennifer Reside at 
#35971 to discuss how to proceed.

If you have any questions relating to the model or this survey, or are unable 
to meet the survey due date, please call Jennifer Reside at #35971 (Shari is 
on vacation this week).

on evergreen.

Please advise.

Heidi-  There should be a deal ticket in Sitara for this sale to Engage, but 
it looks as though 12/99 was the last month a deal was entered 
(IF/HSC+1.00).  George/Craig- could you guys coordinate who should be rolling 
this deal or let us know if this gas should not be flowing?  Heidi-  
historically we've been charging $.60/mm for this transport.

I am finding flow out there on HPL 215 for meter 1520 (Tx City Coastal 
States) starting 4/1/00 (actually, no volume was scheduled but looks like it 
has been allocated since March 1).  Did you want a premium rate for this?

Anita,

There is a delivery nom of 22 @ the above mentioned meter for 1/99 
production.  This is a receipt meter. 

Can you please explain the purpose of this delivery nom being @ this receipt 
meter?  I also have the same situation @ 98-2662 for 1/99.  Also, this 
activity is continuing on into 2/99.

Clem Cernosek expressed that these delivery noms are causing errors on his 
end of the spectrum.

Jackie-

I cannot for the life of me remember why this sale deal is in there.  I do 
believe it is valid and is a part of the purchase deal with Tesoro.  Jill 
Zively was the dealmaker and could probably answer your question as could 
George Weissman and Melissa Graves.  You might also check with Anita, the 
allocator, to see the support she gets for the allocation.  This may give you 
some clue as to what this volume represents.  (Let me know, too, since I hate 
forgetting things!!!!)

Below is a list of the major items that are still outstanding on the 
interdesk/interconnect report for 1999 and 2000 that is impacting the 
intercompany cleanup for SAP implementation.  These issues have been 
addressed in earlier E-Mails and this is an updated list of issues that need 
to be completed by June 19, 2000.


1) King Ranch interstates - Fred and Stella are working with Exxon to 
reconcile from Oct 1999 - Apr 2000 the interstate nominations for Tennessee 
and NGPL and also for Tejas.
                             
2) Tetco Meter 6892 -  Question of who has custody transfer at the meter.  
ENA is using Tetco's  volume and HPLC is using the HPL Measurement volume, 
causing a desk to desk variance.
                                            Clem and Pat are working on.

3) Transco Bammel  Meter 74 - Transco and HPL's nominations are out of 
balance at Meter 74. Charlotte needs to work with Transco to resolve.

4) Dow  Meter 4486 - The sale to Entex needs to be taken off of HPLC meter 
4486 and the sale needs to be at Dow Meter 4486.  
                                          A desk to desk between ENA (buyer) 
and HPLC (seller) needs to be set up on Dow Meter 4486.
                                          Ami needs to set up the deals and 
Thu needs to coordinate the months involved.

                                          Once this is done and Thu 
reallocates to Dow Pipeline, Jackie needs to zero out the confirmed noms and 
make the meter non allocatable in Pops.
                                          Clem verified with Steve Schneider 
that this meter is not on HPL's system.

5) East Texas Gas / Devon     - Devon invoicing ENA entire flow at Carthage.
     Meter 4607701                           East Texas keeping HPLC whole on 
nominations
                                                             Desk to desk 
deal is out of balance because of this 
                                                             Karen is working 
with Pennzoil and East Texas to reach agreement on how to handle this issue 
between them
          

6) PGEV -  Actuals on swing meters (HPL ) not matching expense volumes being 
allocated by PGEV.  
                    Sherlyn is working with Stacey and Charlotte to resolve.

7) Pan Energy Sales issues - discrepancies on PGEV.  Katherine and Sherlyn 
are working with Stacey  to resolve.

Daren,

The above deal number expired at the end of November 2000 and needs to either 
be extended through December, or a new deal inputted.  Can you assist me in 
this?

Thanks.

Based on the conversation we had  at the meeting last Thursday, I am 
implementing the following changes to Humble Gas Pipeline and King Ranch Gas 
Plant.  If you disagree or feel you had a different understanding than the 
items below, please be sure to call me asap.

1. Input HPLC purchase from HPLR Liquids at meter 8793 (HPL/HGPL).  Remove 
the 3 Rivers gas from the Interconnect ticket and input on
 the Purchase Deal.

2. Input HPLC sale to HPLR Liquids at meters 9643 (KGPL/HPL) and 12 
(KGPL/HGPL).  Remove 3 rivers volumes from the interconnect tickets 
 at these meters and input on the sales Deals appropriately.

3. Change swing parameters for the King Ranch contracts to swing on Cage 
Ranch before swinging on 3 Rivers Gas.  This will hopefully allow 
 the sale for 3 Rivers gas to remain at one meter as much as possible.

I will hopefully have all of these changes made by the end of the day, and 
have all contracts repathed.  It is my understanding that we are implementing 
these changes effective Feb. 1st.

Stella,  This may or may not effect repathing of the HPLC gas at meter 9643, 
based on the swing parameters that you have been using.

Thank you.

We will need a small staff to handle potential trades for Wed. the 27th.  
Most of the pipelines are out of the office, so I would expect the work load 
to be minimal.  I plan on coming in, and would like to have a minimum of 
three on staff, so I need two volunteers (one offsystem, just in  case).  If 
anyone is going to be in town, please forward a number, in case we need to 
call any additional people in, or have you work on a laptop from home.  I 
will get with you after the new year to make up the holiday you miss, or, you 
can schedule your day now, I have the calendars.  Also, I will be out on 
vacation Friday, Dec. 22nd and will need someone to send the nominations to 
the plants, I don't expect to have full system coverage, just HPL/HPL and 
HPL/ENA as needed.  Let me know if you are interested in learning how to do 
this.

Thank you,

Mary

I have two outstanding pricing issues that I tried to resolve with Gary Lamphier, but didn't have any luck.  These deals are both day deals for February 2001 done by Danny Conner. The customer is showing a pricing difference according to what we have in Sitara.  Can you please help me resolve this pricing issue.

	Sitara Deal #		Sitara Price	Customer Price

	627800			   $5.25		   $5.23

Daren, I am trying to process two invoices from Samson Resources Co. (Samson 
Lone Star Limited) for September 2000 and October 2000.  The volume is at 
Carthage Hub.  I have not been able to find this volume in Unify for either 
month.  Samson has faxed me their confirmation and your name is listed as the 
contact.  Do you know the Sitara number for these deals?  Thanks.

I spoke with Larry Zamit this morning regarding the outage January 1 through 
6.  He agreed to hold the gas for us and batch it throughout the rest of 
January.  At this point we have 3,007 nominated for 1/1/00 and that is what 
he has agreed to hold.

Questions??  Give me a call.

 Attached is a M-T-D daily reading of gas that has flowed at meter #: 1528 
during May 2000 production.
 
 This data is provided to inform you of the activity at this meter. 
 
 HPL is the only counterparty doing business at this meter thus, Sitara 
ticket # 92887  will take the swing.

FYI

I added meter 987195 to the above deal for August 1999 to clean up a strangers gas issue for Clem.  No deal volume was put in, I just needed the point to show up in Unify for Volume Managment to assign a track ID.

Good Morning Daren:
I received a fax from D&H for 06/01 deliveries (HPLC sales to D&H), however
there is no sales draft in Unify for this sale. Please advise if the 360
mmbtu reflected on D&H's 06/01 allocations, for HPL meter # 428-Deweyville.
Tx. a valid HPLC sale and if so, who do I contact about getting deal in
Sitara and scheduled for HPLC, so as to invoice D&H this month!

Subject: Hourly Gas Deals

Here is a high level summary of our discussions last week.  I believe that 
the calculations listed below under option 1 show how HPL would like to 
capture deals and see their postions all based on a 24 hour flow rate basis.  
Option 2 shows what the values would look like under an hourly flow basis.  

Bob:  Please review with the other trading directors and see if they also 
prefer to see everything on a 24 Hour Flow Rate basis.  Thanks!  -  Tommy

Meter 0986315 Shawnee Spring Common Point was shut-in on 6/13/2000 due to 
high dew point.  Repeated attempts by the pumper to dry out the gas have 
failed.  The meter will remain shut-in until the dew point is within pipeline 
quality specs.

I received a call from Carl Drachenberg with HMS at approximately 1:45 PM on 
6/13/00 stating that he pulled a stick on meter #986315 and it was wet and 
flowing at 35 lb. I asked Gary Hanks what we want to do and he said to have 
Carl notify the producer and shut it in.   I notified Carl and he got in 
touch with the producer and they shut the compressor down at approx. 2 PM on 
6/13 and at that time there wasn't any flow.  Carl came back out there at 8 
AM on 6/14 and closed the valve and removed the chart. There was no flow 
after they shut the unit down and it was flowing between 500 and 300 mcf.  
The meter is now out of service.

Any questions - you know where to find me.

Heads up on this.  They will be putting in a firm ticket starting in January.

I have explained what a problem this causes your group, and we are working on 
a solution.  Unfortanuately, this whole thing was missed, until Susan started

Per our conversation yesterday,  the deals/contracts associated with this 
meter have been terminated as of 12/31/99.  Please let me know what the 
status is on this matter because the meter is still active and flowing and 
there is no contract to allocate to.  

Thanks,

Equistar will be bringing the Syngas plant back up effective May 10.  While the plant has been down, Enron has been buying the gas back at HSC - $.02.  Their load will come back up on the 10th and the price will be the fixed price on the deal of $5.75.

I appreciate your help on this.  Please let me know if there are any questions.

Craig

This is a follow up to the conversation you had with Pat yesterday and to 
reiterate retro contract assignments.  We have decided to go back to the old 
process of handling contract assignments mid-month.  This means that if we 
receive an assignment from legal after the 10th workday, that assignment will 
become effective for current month the following month.  For example, if I 
receive a notice from whomever that XYZ has been assigned to ABC on 11/15/00 
for an legal effective date of 4/00, I will create a new deal from 4/00 
forward.  On the new deal the currect month will be zeroed out under the 
expected volumes.  Bob would not start nominating this new deal until 12/00, 
leaving 4/00 - 11/00 to be moved by volume mangement.

If this is not a clear understanding from all parties, please let me know.

Rita:  If this becomes burdensome on your group, please let me know and we 
will readdress this issue.

Thanks!!

Julie

This deal was not transported on contract 1856, the 15,000 was sold to El Paso Merchant directly at that point.  It was 15,000 a day for the 30th and 31st.  

Let me know if you need anything further.

I have re-checked Sitara & verified that the above deal was a Term, Firm deal.  This resulted in a GTC Purchase Firm contract being set-up in the Global Contracts System.  The term of the GTC was set as the term of the deal (4/1/00 thru 3/31/01) with no evergreen, meaning that the contract will expire at the end of this month.

To the best of my knowledge, all GTC Purchase Firms have the same language & they do not have evergreen.  They expire at the end of the primary term.

So, unless Exxon negotiated a deal with different, special language to allow for evergreen & included something about a "10 day notification" to terminate, there isn't any reason to "terminate" this contract.

If this is the case, please advise.  Otherwise, I don't think we need to do anything.  The contract will expire at the end of this month on its own.

Please prepare and send a termination letter by tomorrow March 16, 2001 on the above referenced deal.  Houston Pipe Line Company has not renegotiated a price and have no interest in buying the gas on an evergreen basis.  It is my understanding that we need to notify them within 10 days of the end of the delivery period

.  If you need any additional information or have any questions, please contact me at 35656.  Thanks.  EMV

Daren has copied the old ticket and reput the volumes on a new deal ticket, 
dating back to the first, which reflects the correct Texas desk entity.  All 
of the buys/sales currently transacted at Waha by the Texas desk are done by 
HPLC-HPLC.  Please check your deal tickets as any volumes for April will need 
to be repathed, nom'd, etc.

Thank you,

Daren & Tom,

Beginning with August production, I noticed that Big Cowboy, into King Ranch 
appeared to be flowing approximately 9M over the nomination/day.  Per a 
conversation I had with Fred Boas today, I discovered that two wells with 
zero noms flowed a considerable volume.

They are as follows:

 Rocher Big Cowboy (27002) - 42,000 approx.
 Big Cowboy #2 (27003 - 84,000 approx.
  Total flow:  126,000 MM's, more or less

I think that this may be part of the production increase which we are trying 
to account for, in addition to the Acock production at the Briscoe well which 
came on in August.  Please let me know what you think.  I would like to make 
sure that we are capturing our purchases correctly for both accounting and 
our economics.

Thank you,

Mary

Greens Bayou.  I checked the deal ticket (286824) and it ends on 6/17.  There 
is still two more days that need to be reallocated.  Please let me know if  
you can extend this deal or create a new one.

Thanks.

As you are aware, we are starting to collect data for our February price 
model. I've attached a survey to help us collect the data that will be 
driving your costs from the activities to the commercial teams.  Please 
select your RCs, and fill in the driver quantity for the requested driver for 
the month of February. Please fill out the attached activity driver survey 
with February numbers for your RC by end of day Friday, March 3rd.  If your 
group currently generates a standard report that captures the surveyed data, 
please send the report to me, and put me on your recipient list beginning 
next month.  This will eliminate your need to fill out this survey every 
month.  If you would like us to collect this information from someone within 
your team beginning next month, please let me know.  

Please take this opportunity to verify the following:
1. The driver indicates a measure for the time and effort your team spent to 
perform these activities for each commercial team.
2. The activity is spent in support of the commercial teams identified 
(please let us know otherwise)
3. If the activity is using an allocation (for example "Allocate 0469" or 
"80-20 Split"), that the percentage allocated to each commercial team has not 
changed from last month.   (Please let us know if it has changed what the new 
allocation is).

In reference to these surveys, please note:
If you are allocating only infrastructure costs to some commercial teams 
listed in the survey, please identify them.  We will take your business 
support costs (such as feedback, training, etc.) and allocate them evenly 
among these teams.
The costs for "commercial team specific" activities that you filled time out 
for in the January time survey will be directly allocated to that commercial 
team (e.g. Genco Support will trace 100% of its costs to Genco).  

Please let us know if you have any questions on this survey.  

Regards,
Shari

Tom did some footwork and questioning and determined where the additional Big 
Cowboy production is coming from.  Apparently, HPL cut a deal to purchase 
this gas at "HPL meters" at Rocher and Big Cowboy #2, so the gas had been 
pathed on the gathering agreement into our pipe.  All along, these volumes 
have been flowing into the GEPL/Big Cowboy system and on to King Ranch.  Tom 
and I spoke with Clem about the most correct way to reflect the physical and 
determined that a Transport Usage ticket needed to be put into place, as IM 
Wellhead, to transfer the volumes from HPL to GEPL and into the plant.  

We unpathed the gathering agreement and brokered the HPL purchase to the TU 
tickets and moved the gas on our transport on GEPL to the plant, effective 
April 1.  This resolves our overproduction issues for April and forward.

Please let me know if you have any further questions, comments, or 
information to add.

I will leave Robert to the above accounts. I will refer all contacts on this 
subject to him for handling.

It is my personal belief that Robert is not yet ready to provide all the 
services necessary in this area, but I also know that full responsibility 
often is a good teacher.

Pat, as far as I'm concerned I'm out of the game. 

I will help Daren if needed and if not I'll be on my way.

GOOD LUCK to you in your endeavors.

This issue still has not been resolved, and it is effecting  the PG&E 
contract 5095-037, HPLC transport contract TA99-027, several deals on the 
interconnect report, and causing payment issues for Katherine Herrera to 
PanEnergy Marketing.  I have sent several emails, faxed the daily's and left 
voice messages, but have not received any updates to this issue.

I am looking into this with Lorraine to figure this out.  We did not nominate 
this for the days you are referring to, but Lorraine says she flowed this gas 
even though I cut the volume.  I will let you know when this is resolved.

Megan, 

The contract covering meters 098-5427 and 098-6831 executed by Hurd Enterprises, Ltd. was terminated effective 2/28/2001.  A replacement contract to cover these points effective 3/1/2001 was subsequently sent to Killam Oil Company, Ltd., but Killam has not yet executed and returned the replacement contract.  I cannot see how we handled Killam in March, but, as indicated below, Enron entered a baseload deal attached to a spot gtc for April - in fact, AEP has entered baseload deals attached to a spot gtc for June, July and August also.  Thus, I would suggest it would be appropriate to enter a baseload deal for Killam at meters 098-5427 and 098-6831 for Killam for May and attach it to a spot gtc. 

The "assignment" from Hurd to Killam is moot.  Since the Hurd contract has been terminated, both Enron and AEP can purchase this gas from Killam, the owner warranting that it has the right to sell this gas, without a contract amendment approving the assignment from Hurd to Killam.

George, 

Please read Megan's e-mail below.  The spreadsheet for May did not reflect any nomination for Killiam Oil.  Did the contract with Killiam terminate?  Should we be purchasing from meter(s) 5427 and/or 6831 and, if so, from what counterparty?  Please advise.  Thanks.

Bob:
I need some help with Killam Oil for May 2001.  They called me yesterday
asking about their May payment because they hadn't received it yet.  I
looked in Path Manager and saw that we did not have any deals with them in
May.  In April, we paid them for gas at HPL meters 985427 and 986831 (deal
742826 and 742829).  The gas at these meters has been put on HPL's
Strangers Gas contract in POPS for May.  Do you know why we do not have any
deals at these meters for May?  I was told by Charles Howard that there is
a pending assignment for these meters form Hurd to Killam.  He said for
June 2001, AEP paid Hurd.  Do you know who we are suppose to pay for May?
I would appreciate any help you can give me.

Thanks,
Megan

98-1052 (del. meter) has flow for 11/10/99 and 11/11/99.  Maxey Walters 
(field guy) informed me that he rec'd a call from our Mktg. people asking him 
to flow gas these two days due to problems ocurring at Phillips on these two 
days.  Can you please look into this for me and see if you can provide me 
with a K# to assess this business to?  Thanks.

98-6614 (rec. meter) has flow for every day this month but no K.  Last month 
it was on the 215K, Sitara #93035.  The start date on this deal is 7/1/99 and 
the stop date is 11/30/99.  Sitara #130917's start and stop date is 10/1/99 
and 1/31/00 but the expected vols for 12/99 are "0".  Can you look into this 
and tell me is the expected vols. for 12/99 should be different?

Thanks again.

We need to get together this afternoon at 2:00 PM in room 3745 to discuss how 
we will schedule and allocate the HPLR Liquids coming into Humble Gas 
Pipeline at meter 8793.  Karry, it is my understanding that you do not want 
an intercompany sale from HPLR Liquids to HPLC at this point.   How do you 
plan to get this gas to King Ranch since HPLR Liquids does not have a 
transport on Humble?

Daren, the intercompany HPLC purchase  is how it is set up currently in MOPS.

Robert, since Stella is out, we will need someone to represent Logistics.

Beginning on January 14th at meter 988022 (United Salt), the BAV feed into 
Pops shows excessive flow (over 200M/Day beginning the 15th).  O'Neal brought 
this to my attention this evening.  This issue will blow out our UA4 number, 
and probably our P & L.  I phoned Lee in Gas Control to make sure a tech was 
sent out to check calibration and scada feed.  I would like to have better 
estimates from the 14th through the 19th asap so that we can make corrections 
to all pertinent numbers.

Thank you,

Mary

On Tuesday, March 7th, Tejas took gas from us at Oasis Katy and gave it back 
to us at Tejas Laporte to help us out during an outage for $.02/mmbtu.  This 
transaction has not been scheduled correctly.  There are two deal tickets in 
Sitara to cover the Oasis portion of the deal:  #213145 covers ENA selling 
the gas to HPLC for HPLC to transport on Tejas.  Deal #213370 covers the 
transport usage on Tejas from Oasis Katy to Laporte.  I have edited this 
ticket to add the $.02/mm charge.  There needs to be a Tejas expense contract 
at Laporte, #665, to cover the approx. 25,000mm received there on the 7th.  
These volumes are currently sitting on the Laporte OBA.

Jackie-  if you would work with Carlos he should be able to walk you through 
getting this scheduled correctly in all systems.

Thanks.

In reviewing some of the imbalance numbers, I discovered that Valero Texoma 
(#71) BAV volumes have not fed into POPS since 3/14 causing an out of balance 
at the meter in excess of 500,000mm month to date.  The more critical part of 
this problem, however, is that POPS has fed 0 volumes back to Sitara on some 
of the HPLC deals.  This means that these purchase volumes (expenses) have 
not been picked up in Tom's P&L and are, instead, sitting in UA4.  To the 
extent that the purchase prices vary from the UA4 value, the P&L may take a 
hit when these actual volumes flow through.

I realize that Kim is out and that you guys are stretched thin, however, a 
problem of this magnitude needs to be addressed as soon as it's discovered.  
Someone needs to be overriding the 0 volumes so that Sitara is receiving 
correct information and the P&L is kept as accurate as possible.

Please give me a call if you have any questions.

Daren,

Is Fred's below concern something that you might be able to help us with?  I 
was thinking that (maybe) the volumes from this meter might belong to HPL.  
This is one of the meters that no longer go thru King Ranch.

Thanks

Meter 5688 is incorrectly scheduled to the HPL Liquids contract 
012-41970-02-002 in March 2000.  Also last month when you were out, Robert 
removed the volume from the Liquids contract at this meter and temporarily 
put it on a Strangers Gas contract.  If you could fix both months today and 
let me know when it is corrected  I would appreciate it.

Thanks,

I am new at the 3 Rivers allocation so bear with me, I took this over from

Meters 5688 and 5801 are not scheduled on the HPL Liquids contract

volume at these two meters so if you could fix this by early tomorrow morning

Kim,  

Will you please get with Mary Smith and Trisha Hughes with the Texas Rates 
group
and pick up from them the off system pipeline rates that they are handling.

You may want to visit with Daren Farmer also about the level of activity.

We need to transition this work to your team as soon as possible.

thanks

All except for last one rollled due to evergreen.  When you convert to ENA - 
IM Texas - don't forget to remove the evergreen flag on the old ECT - IM Waha

Should these not be converted to ENA - IM Texas ???  Some time ago - we were 
told this desk was dead and the existing deals would end.  This desk is not 
included in any Texas desk portfolios.

The ECT desks are supposed to be inactive - however - these deals keep 
rolling - and 
someone created some new ones?   If the desk is active - should we change it 
to ENA - IM Waha - 
as ECT is no more ???

Oasis will be doing away with the temporary passwords for their on-line nom & 
confirm system effective 4/1/01, so it looks like you will need to review the 
agreement and get set up on it.  It is not mandatory, however; they are 
encourageing everyone to get on board.  Let me know what you want to do.  I 
have attached the agreement, and info on the nom/confirm cycles.  I have been 
using it this week and it is pretty user friendly.  The reporting 
capabilities are still being developed, but I am told it should be ready 
soon.  Take a look for yourself @ www.oasispipeline.com..........logon:  
north.....password:  enron........currently, no intradays are allowed 
online(only by fax/email)  because they want to approve same days, but they 
are looking at allowing them in the future.

Daren:

During the month of September and October 2000, gas flowed into HPL's 
pipeline at the above meter that is owned by Duke Energy Trading and 
Marketing, LLC.  Prior to September 2000, the gas was purchased under 
contract #960439646, and Deal #133196 that expired on 8/31/2000.  Effective 
11/1/2000, the gas was again purchased from Duke under Contract #96021934; 
Deal #466305, but this deal expires on 11/30/2000. 

Currently, Logistic has September and October 2000 volumes recorded to HPL 
Strangers Gas Contract.  In order to correct this, HPL Logistics needs either 
(1) Deals #133196 or #466305 extended to cover September and October 2000, 
(2) a new deal to cover September and October 2000, or (3) Logistics needs 
approval to write-off these volumes to Unaccounted for Gas Loss.  (Print, 
sign, and return the original to Clem Cernosek).


 ______________________________________________
 Deal/Deal Ticket#/Customer (Buyer/Seller)

    OR


 _________________________________________________________
 APPROVAL to Write-off the volumes to Unaccounted for Gas Loss


In addition,  since Deal #466305 expires on 11/30/2000 and gas is still 
flowing, Logistics needs either (1) Deal #466305 extended, or (2) a new deal 
to cover December 2000 and any other future months that this production is 
flowing into HPL's pipeline.


 _____________
 New Deal #

Daren,

ATEs shows that your team has one specialist for 1497 in January and 
February.  Please let me know if ATEs is incorrect for the month of January 
and February.  If there is a specialist in your team, we have not received a 
survey from this person.  This lack of information prevents your expenses 
from being 100% allocated out to the commercial teams.  Please fill out the 
following survey and return it to me ASAP.  If you have any questions please 
call me at 3-3859.

Thanks,
Shari

Daren,

Should I change the counterparty on this sale, or is that handled by 
marketing?  Also, we may need to look at changing the Storage Agmt.   Please 
advise.

The trades below were originally executed between HPL and Cannon Interests 
Houston per terms of a specific Master Physical Agreement.  After recieving 
back executed documentation, we are ready to have the trades offically moved 
within the various Enron capuring systems from Cannon to Kinder Morgan Texas 
Pipeline, Inc. per the terms and conditions of the recently executed Master 
Physical Agreement between HPL and Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline, Inc.

First, here are the TAG Nos. of the trades we wish to have assigned.

NU2813
NA0376

Second, several trades are listed within a ERMS book called:  P A M
These trades show a 12-31-00 expiry and their Nos. are:

522284
830689
892696
904035
904276

I am not sure what these numbers are.  But, could you move them as well.

Thanks for your help.

Does it make a difference  if the information is communicated via a copy of 
customer "force majeure" letter or should it only be communicated
 via notes mail.  
 
There are several ways to communicate effectively issues that is beneficial 
to other departments, do you have a preference?

Deliveries to this meter were halted late in the day of January 20. The 
customer has maintenance issues that necessitated an earlier than planned 
turnaround.

It is my understanding from our trader this is another force majure situation 
resulting in no sale or buyback at this meter commencing with the shutdown.

Please take this into consideration when allocating and billing the customer.

Thanks

I show you pathed deal 951474 on 8/23/01 for production months January and February 2001.  This deal expired 12/31/00, and the late pathing has caused a bridgeback error for January and February 2001.

fyi - you will need to enter this into Sitara - remember, first 10,000/d is 
EOG transport.

Lee,

I did my fuel gas estimate and think that we will need 120-125 BBTU/Day of 
fuel
gas for the month of April.  On a side note, we will bring down our gas 
turbine
generator on Sunday morning.  This will bring our high pressure gas 
requirements
down to essentially zero (it will be zero if our Hydrogen Plant stays down) 
and
the demand will transfer to our low pressure gas.  We will be in this
arrangement for approximately 20 days.

Brian

For once his is not a Panenergy question.  For sale deal 707274, DEFS says the price on 4/4 should be 5.25 and we have 5.20 in Sitara.  Can you confirm this price for me?

Repairs to the Wilson Creek lateral were completed on Monday afternoon 
7/10/00.  Upon completion of repairs HMS found excessive corrosion on the 
meter run and notified pumper that they would remain shut-in until the 
producer replaced or repaired the meter run.  Once the meter run is replaced 
or repaired the lateral will be purged and packed and put back into service.

If you have any questions please call me at 36449.

Daren,

Below is Volume Management's answers to Gary's questions.

I'm now awaiting on an e-mail from Gary as to the direction that he is going 
to take.  I will follow suit according to his instructions.  

Should you come aboard, I'll await your decision as well.

Again, thanks.

Subject: Meter 984132 for 1/16/99

Here is the issue for 1/16/99 at meter 984132.   

20,000 mmbtu were confirmed for Adonis in POPS.   10,000 mmbtu on day 5 and 
day 16.   Day 16 is not valid for deal 51862 (track id 6155), which is where 
10,000 was confirmed.   The  actual sale to Adonis was 10,000 which was 
invoiced and paid by Adonis.  We are trying to clear the feedback error 
report.   My question is why was 10,000 confirmed on 1/16/99 if the date is 
not valid for the deal?

When Karen allocates the actual 10,000 it is prorating 5,000 for each day 
that is confirmed (the 5th and 16th).  

Should the whole 10,000 be allocated to the 5th or should 5,000 be allocated 
to each day?   If 5,000 should be allocated to each day, the 16th needs to be 
added to the deal.

Prior to 7/99  this was ENA not HPL, but there may be some issues on it as well for 3/99 to 6/99.  The deal ticket we used was 62717.  I will have to look further into the ENA activity because I know we still have some invoices that were paid under one company and we still have drafts under the other.

Daren, 

I am trying to get some payments out to Williams for old months 11/2000 and 1/2001 but global counterparty said this deal should have Black Marlin Pipeline Company Inc. instead of Black Marlin Pipeline Company effective 3/99.  The Black Marlin Pipeline Company was for an internal record (when it was an Enron entity).

In order to ensure that all computer-related equipment is being properly 
capitalized and not expensed in your RC, I would like to centralize the 
purchase of equipment for Energy Operations.  Going forward, if you need to 
purchase equipment for a new employee or need to upgrade your existing PC 
and/or monitor, please send me an E-mail containing the following information:

Employee Name (indicate if the employee is new)
Location
Phone Extension
Equipment you would like to purchase
Existing system number if upgrading your PC

I have set up an RC exclusively to capture purchases of computer-related 
equipment.  This will make it easier to properly capitalize these assets.

One more thing I need for each of you to do.  Please review your RC reports 
for January 2000 and make sure that there aren't any PC purchases charged to 
your RC.  You can find them in Cost Category 601 "Non-Capitalized Hardware 
and Software".  If you had any charges in this category for equipment, please 
forward a copy of your RC report to me as soon as possible so that I can work 
with Brian Heinrich to have the charges reversed from your RC in February.

If you have any questions, please call me at Ext. 3-6343.  Thank you in 
advance for your help to ensure that your RC does not go over budget for 
purchases of equipment that should be properly capitalized.

Deal # 547201

Texas General Land office has called and is disputing that this sale is a 
part of the month exchange deal for transport.  
Do we have the name of the trader at Texas General Land Office that did this 
deal with us ?

The sale was for 01/01-01/31 for 99,200 mmbtus at $9.82.

Thanks - Katherine

Please call Linda and get everything set up.  

I'm going to estimate 4,500 coming up tomorrow, with a 2,000 increase each 
following day based on my conversations with Bill Fischer at BMAR.

Darren,

The attached appears to be a nomination from Vastar Resources, Inc. for the 
High Island Larger Block A-1 #2 (previously, erroneously referred to as the 
#1 well).  Vastar now expects the well to commence production sometime 
tomorrow.  I told Linda Harris that we'd get her a telephone number in Gas 
Control so she can provide notification of the turn-on tomorrow.  Linda's 
numbers, for the record, are 281.584.3359 voice and 713.312.1689 fax.

Would you please see that someone contacts Linda and advises her how to 
submit future nominations via e-mail, fax or voice?  Thanks.

I don't know if they paid Torch, I would assume so, as this is October.  
According to Charlene, Cleco is invoicing us for this deal.  Intially, there 
was no deal in the system at all.

As communicated to you in an email dated September 19, 2000, we have 
developed an easier and more efficient method of handling the Operations 
Pricing Model hours survey using Microsoft Access.  The NEW & IMPROVED survey 
is ready for your input for the month of September.

What to do:

1)  Attached is a reference document that lets you know the purpose of the 
OPM Hours Survey, prerequisites to using the tool, helpful hints and contact 
information.  Please open and read.

2)  Click on the attached link to access the OPM Survey.  Please select "OK" 
at the warning message that appears and continue on to the database.  If you 
have any questions/comments, please contact Suzanne Nicholie at Ext. 5-7341.

The OPM team is available to support you while using this new tool.  During 
the next couple of days, one of the OPM team members will be contacting each 
of you to see if you need help or have any questions.

We are asking for a quick turn around of the completion of the survey and 
although it is month end, quarter end and the planning process is near 
completion, please complete the OPM Survey using the database by end of day, 
Friday, October 6.

Thanks, 

James Scribner

Mike,
I show you pathed deal 951474 on 8/23/01 for production months January and February 2001.  This deal expired 12/31/00, and the late pathing has caused a bridgeback error for January and February 2001.

accidentally failed to do the report for March 2001.  Attached is a report 
for March 2001 which covers all assignments, terminations & expirations 
entered since the last report was done on 2/15/01.  There will be a new

Jackie, 

Volume is allocating to deal number 51862 on 1/16/99 on meter 984132, however 
the deal does not have this day on it.  Please have 1/16 added to the deal so 
the error will clear.

Thanks and if you need additional info, let me know.

Karen

Daren - I need your help in resolving this issue.  There wasn't any deal in 
OSS for the above reference meter, nor could I find anything in CPR.  The 
contract shows 089-41500-102 representing a sale in the amount of 9448.

Daren,

I would like for these sessions to be separate, only because my group is 
probably at a different level than Lisa's in terms of understanding the 
business (not that we understand it in its entirety).  The last week of this 
month or the first week of March prior to the 6th workday is good for my 
group(s).  Let me know.  Thanks!

Rita and Lisa, 

Why don't ya'll get together and determine a range of days/times that would 
work for your groups to have a training session.  (Over lunch or early 
afternoon)  If you are interested, I would like to discuss how we operate the 
HPL system and the processes we go through during the trading day.  To help 
with the discussion, I have maps which highlight the main points and areas 
where we transact.  (There will be a few for you to keep at the desks.)  

I did this with the Logistics group.  I think it went pretty well.  If you 
want to do this, we need to allow 1.5 to 2 hours to talk about everything.  
Let me know.

Paso.  El Paso will not confirm the volume that high.  EOG revised their 
nomination as follows:

C/P Name Meter #  Orig Nom Rev Nom

EOG Res. 6296  5,733  2,300

Will you approve revising the volume in Unify down to 2,300?  Please advise.  
Thanks.

Bob

Southern Union for May
2100 83 st
2100 Port Arthur

These are my estimates. The volumes for April at T-ville and Colorado RS are 
either spot or April only. Janet does not know about next month yet.
So, 5000 total is a safe assumption.

Fred is trying to set up accounting arrangments to cover the Swift deal.  Can 
you please verify that you made this purchase from Swift?  If so, is there 
another deal to replace deal #114096 of should this deal be extended into 
January.    If I should forward this to someone else, please let me know.  

Thanks for you help, Stella

Stella:

The Swift deal is not pathed correctly in POPS.  I set up an accounting 
arrangement on the 012-41500-02-015 contract with the Track ID 80705.  Would 
you put the contract in POPS with the associated Track ID?  

The transportation contract (012-41500-02-003) for the Liquids Replacement 
gas is not POPS.  I looked in Path Manager and there is no deal for it 
either.  In December, the deal for this gas was 114096.  Could you extend the 
deal or get me the number for the new deal if there is one?  I need to set up 
an accounting arrangement so I will need for you to verify the deal number 
and transportation contract that this gas is supposed to go on.  When I set 
up the accounting arrangement I will let you know what the Track ID is so you 
can put the contract at meter 9643.

Let me know when all of this is done so that I can reallocate the meter.

Thanks,

Fred

Susan,

Hope you had a great new year and holiday season!  I have a couple of issues 
I want ot clear up for this year's contract.

The question is how valero wants to treat the three meter locations where you 
are currently pulling gas.  Our new contract that was just sent to you has a 
minimum take of 60,000 mmbtu (estimated 35,000 @ 8018 Celanese, 15,000 @ 1233 
Texas City, and 10,000 @ 1394 Dodge Street).  If you undertake at any meter 
excess volumes from another meter would be used to fulfill the entire 60,000 
mmbtu.  My accountant has told me that this is causing difficulties with the 
two plants and how they want to see gas purchases broken out.  We discussed 
this on the phone and I got your consent to split these invoices.  Now we are 
being told all three invoices need to be separate.  Since we always aim to 
please the customer, here is my recommendation for handling the contract 
through it's term.  Please let me know if this is fine.

Celanese 35,000 mmbtu/d minimum  On any given day if volumes fall below 
35,000 HPLC will buy back these volumes at GD Katy mid
      two days after flow

Texas City 15,000 mmbtu/d minimum On any given day if volumes fall below 
15,000 HPLC will buy back these volumes at GD Katy mid
      two days after flow

Dodge Street 10,000 mmbtu/d minimum On any given day if volumes fall below 
10,000 HPLC will buy back these volumes at GD Katy mid
      two days after flow

Any excess volumes taken at all three locations would be billed @ GD HSC High 
2 day after

Daren - What happened in Feb. was that Transco had allocated a different 
amount other than our measurement. I had been working with Fred on getting 
some allocations resolved for several different months.  Transco told us they 
would not go back and reallocate due to the statute of limitations (6 
months).  February had a significant amount not allocated.  We just need a 
deal set up so we can write these volumes off.  Let me know if you have any 
more questions.

now that we have a transport agreement on HPL.  On physical payback, I think the
best way would be to have the imbalance transfered to our agreement and then schedule
the payback directly to us.  
 
I guess we need to work this out with the AEP people.  I have talked to Kim Lastraps about
this.  Can you guys follow up and let me know what you decided.
 
thanks

Brian-  This relates to an imbalance due Enron pre-June 2001.  AEP/HPL is negotiating on Enron's behalf to clear these historical imbalances.  Lobo wants to pay this gas back on Wednesday.  You guys can take this in and transport it on HPL to a market (for a fee, of course) or you can outright sell it to HPL after taking receipt at King Ranch.  It is up to you.  I realize that Wednesday may be short notice.  I was not a party to determining the date of this resolution and have no problem getting these guys to hold off, if need be.  Just let me know how you want to proceed.  I'm at 832-668-1181.  Thanks.

Our imbalance to date is 6798dkthm, and we would like to schedule this for

Daren,   I just talked to Mary and she said that they developed the meter 
987341 for the meters that you had nominated under the 987012.   Under 
Aggregate 7012 is 4045;  6026; 6114; 6427; 6848; 9755 ;  these should all be 
under the 987341.  Do we need to renominate these meters or do I just move 
them in pops.  Let me know Daren  I aim to please ( I think that's a southern 
term!!)

HPL has elected to be kept whole with respect to processing during the month 
of December 2000 on its gas delivered from the Three Rivers Gathering 
System.  There should be no reduction for shrinkage and fuel at the plant for 
December 2000.


HPL will be kept whole with respect to ethane recoveries from the Big Cowboy 
gas being processed at the King Ranch Gas Plant during the month of December 
2000.  This election will reduce the shrinkage percentage from 20% of the 
inlet MMBtu's to 15% of the inlet MMBtu's.

If you have any questions please give me a call.

Thanks!

Clem,

I have completed setting the confirm = 0 for 986892 and reallocated
all the days. They are all zero now, however 10/4/2000 and 10/5/2000
still have a non-zero BAV, these should get set to 0 by 10/6. Since
allocation will not allocate these days till 10/6 gas date.

meter replacing #0986892.
2.  After completion, please let me know.

********

Gary:

This could create some problems for Gas Control, because all confirmed 
volumes will be zeroed including October, 2000 activities at meter 986892  
today (10/4/00).   This should correct itself within 24 thru 48 hours at 
meter #980439.

Daren:

This could also create some issues for you, but remember, these issues should 
clear within 24 to 48 hours.

Victor:

This is just for your information, since this should not create and changes 
for you.



IF ANYONE HAS ANY QUESTIONS, PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CALL ME AT X-3665O.

THANKS, CLEM

Aquila split the volume between two points, that is why the deal changed.  
The total volume was still correct.  I just found out today, from Stacie, 
that a buy on EOL needs to be on the header and come from a PGEV Hub or Title 
Tracking Agreement.   I had previously been under the impression that 
whatever pipeline the customer wanted, buy or sell, was fine with us.  
However, keeping the purchases on Hub Agmts. will save Enron 
$.0025/transaction and push all imbalances and fees to the supplier.

In order to prepare for the upcoming Sitara Release to production scheduled 
on 01/24, Sitara will be unavailable as follows:

 Production 01/21 (Fri.) 7:00 PM (CST) thru 01/23 (Sun.) 12:00 PM (CST) 
Conversion and checkout of data for Risk Assignment release
         (Sitara and CPR)

 Parallel 01/14 (Fri.) 7:00 PM (CST) thru 02/01 (Tue.) 8:00 AM (CST) Parallel 
environment will be used as hot back-up, view access only
 (Sitara)

I wanted to make sure everyone had plenty of advance notice.  I would like 
each of you to review these times with your staff.  The Production release is 
the largest to date and the time required to convert the data cannot be 
shortened any more.  Production users will not be impacted by the lack of the 
Parallel environment -we will continue to bridge deal updates to Unify 
Parallel as we do now for the period stated above; however access to Sitara 
parallel will be kept to view only.  A list of items included in this release 
will be forthcoming, as well as training for groups impacted by the Risk 
Assignment change.

I appreciate your help in making this happen.  Any questions, please do not 
hesitate to call myself or the Sitara hotline (x37049)

During the period of 9/5/99 thru 9/6/99, the above meter recorded flow of 
3,962 Mmbtus.  There was no deal at this meter the month prior or after.  
Currently, Logistics has these volumes recorded to HPL Strangers Gas 
Contract.  In order to correct this, HPL Logistics needs either a deal to 
record these volumes which have flowed into HPL's pipeline or Logistics needs 
approval to writeoff these volumes to Unaccounted for Gas.  (Please print, 
sign, and return the original to Clem Cernosek).

Daren,

A small volume (352 Dth) flowed on the 10th at Flagstaff meter, I think it 
may have been a test volume.  Do you want to put in a deal or hit strangers 
for now?

Please advise.

On day 5 in MOPS (HPL/ENA) there is a delivery nom of 10.0 pathed to the ENA 
201 K.  On day 16 in MOPS (HPL/ENA) there is not a deal (which is strange 
because day 16 in POPS references Adonis).  The deal on the 5th was a swing 
deal.

Jackie, 

What does MOPS show for the days in question?  It would be incorrect to add 
any days to the Adonis ticket mentioned below.  It sounds as if the meter was 
allocated incorrectly in POPS and/or a deal was not pathed correctly in 
MOPS.  Let me know what you find in MOPS.

Here is the issue for 1/16/99 at meter 984132.   

20,000 mmbtu were confirmed for Adonis in POPS.   10,000 mmbtu on day 5 and 
day 16.   Day 16 is not valid for deal 51862 (track id 6155), which is where 
10,000 was confirmed.   The  actual sale to Adonis was 10,000 which was 
invoiced and paid by Adonis.  We are trying to clear the feedback error 
report.   My question is why was 10,000 confirmed on 1/16/99 if the date is 
not valid for the deal?

When Karen allocates the actual 10,000 it is prorating 5,000 for each day 
that is confirmed (the 5th and 16th).  

Should the whole 10,000 be allocated to the 5th or should 5,000 be allocated 
to each day?   If 5,000 should be allocated to each day, the 16th needs to be 
added to the deal.

Please be advised that Contract No. Teco9121 shows in the Global Contract 
system as PG&E Texas Pipeline, L.P., however, the pipeline name should be 
PG&E Gas Transmission Teco, Inc..  Apparently, the pipeline name was entered 
into the global system incorrectly. I have confirmed this with Charles Berner 
in the Contracts Administration section and Kim Watson, both with PG&E Gas 
Transmission Teco, Inc..  The contract name should be PG&E Gas Transmission 
Teco, Inc.


I would like to change the pipeline to reflect the correct pipeline name 
effective April 1, 2000.  Thus it will not affect the previous noms for this 
contract.


All please respond to let me know if this will cause problems with 
replication or anything else with the system.


Julie and Stacey,  Deal No. 47434 is attached to this contract you may need 
to change this in your system.

Jackie-

I cannot for the life of me remember why this sale deal is in there.  I do 
believe it is valid and is a part of the purchase deal with Tesoro.  Jill 
Zively was the dealmaker and could probably answer your question as could 
George Weissman and Melissa Graves.  You might also check with Anita, the 
allocator, to see the support she gets for the allocation.  This may give you 
some clue as to what this volume represents.  (Let me know, too, since I hate 
forgetting things!!!!)

We are going to be rolling out a new product on EOL starting this bidweek.  
This product will be for physical delivery only on the weekdays (no weekend 
delivery).  Currently, the EOL/Sitara Bridge cannot handle this type of 
logic, so these deals will have to be input manually.

Let me know if you have further questions.

Subject: 24 x 5 Products

We are rolling out the use of the 24 x 5 Nat Gas Product commencing tomorrow, 
May 24th. 

The Product is a month-long Physical Nat Gas Product traded off the Texas 
desk. It will be identified as follows:

US Gas Phy       Exxon Katy WkD          Jun00           USD/MM

This Product is different from the usual Products traded on the Texas Desk in 
that the Product  description has an 
indicator of  WkD, which designates that the Product only moves gas on a day 
that is a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, 
Thursday or Friday.

These Products WILL NOT bridge into Sitara. Risk personnel will need to be 
diligent to identify these Products based 
on the information in the Product Description to ensure that the Products are 
entered into Sitara correctly (presumably - 
strips of Monday-Friday trades and the corresponding month-starting days 
and/or month-ending days).

We understand the potential impact of having to manually input these 
transactions and have asked the appropriate
systems personnel to examine the links between EOL and Sitara and consider 
building bridge capability. In the
interim, we anticipate that the trading volume on these Products will be low, 
and will ask for higher prioritization of the
bridging in the event that volumes increase.

Kellie,

PG&E will probably try to bill us for parking a volume of 10,263 for August 8 
and 9 at $.03/Mmbtu each day.  Please do not pay this charge when we receive 
this invoice.  PG&E was unable to make deliveries into El Paso because of 
high sulfur content in their gas and is trying to charge us with a parking 
charge for gas that they could not deliver.  Please let me know if you need 
any additional information.  Thanks.

Daren,

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.   Just a reminder for you 
to roll the first six days of December 1999 for 98-9789 Sitara #108246.

Carlos/Tom,

Please apprise when you've completed your research with Producer Services 
referencing the below meters that Daren have referred to as "Contract 
Terminated".

See notes in red below.  In each case where the contract has been terminated, 
Tom and/or Carlos will need to get with Producer Services to determine what 
we need to do (set up a GTC, renegotiate the term deal, etc).

Daren, can you help me with placing K's @ the below listed meters?  I don't 
know if these deals should be rolled or if new ones were set up.

I'll need a K @ each specified meter for the month following the noted month 
that had a K @ it.

Thanks in advance for your help.

Is this date really June of 1999?  Hopefully we're not just finding out about 
this?

I don't think we can even process this request.  The East Desk was not up and 
running on Unify in June of 1999.  All of our pathing for June of 1999 was in 
Autonoms and it's not y2K compatabile. With the volumes involved being so 
small and the accuracy of the data at Enerfin in question, why don't we let 
this volume hit the new OBA at Enerfin as a PPA???

I welcome your thoughts.
Victor

On the above mentioned dates, there was no nomination at the Enerfin meter.

6/3/99 and 6/8/99 revealed activity for ENA (202K).  Can the deal be extended 
for 6/4 (548 dec.) and 6/9 (40 dec.) to cover this flow so that Volume 
Management can create an accounting arrangement for these two days?

Thanks

Hi Julie, I have a question and I wasn't sure of who to start with.  I have a 
new meter for C&E Operating, meter # 0989813 that started up Nov.29.  I have 
a volume statement that confirms that volume did flow the 29th and 30th, a 
total of 660mmbtu.  The problem is there is nothing in the system for meter # 
9813 for 11/99 production.  I looked in Sitara,( sitara # 132030 ) and the 
deal  starts for 12/99 production.   I checked with Donald to make sure and 
he says that the meter did start up 11/29 and the price is HSC less $.10.  In 
order to get this deal into the system, who do I need to talk to???

Thanks,  Stephanie ( 3-6004 )

Joanie,

Logistics is waiting to hear from Daren on this issue.  He will either need 
to extend the deal or maybe there should be another deal in place.   This 
deal 155118 is valid on 1/26/00 only, but the rest of the volume you are 
looking for is scheduled on days 1/27 - 1/31.    I am sure there is no 
pricing on those days.  

I will let you know as soon as I hear from them.

 Anita,

 Per our meeting yesterday, I have set up the necessary usage tickets.  I 
could not set up just one b/c they can only be set up for approx. 3 months at 
a  time.  Therefore, I had to set up 7 usage tickets which are listed below:

 02/99 to 04/99  Sitara Deal 396904
 05/99 to 07/99  Sitara Deal 396925
 08/99 to 10/99  Sitara Deal 396942
 11/99 to 12/99  Sitara Deal 396951
 01/00 to 03/00  Sitara Deal 396956
 04/00 to 06/00  Sitara Deal 396964
 07/00 to 09/00  Sitara Deal 396680

 For 9/00 I will go back and repath it for the 1st through 12th so it should 
be correct when you allocate it.  Let me know when you have the track ids for

Christina,

The Indian Springs plant delivery into HPL will be taken out of service for 
repiping work effective Wednesday morning the 15th.   ENA will be moving 
Texas Desk purchases via Koch Gateway from Teco Polk Co. Plant (12780) to 
MidCon Needville (6350).  I have confirmed available capacity with Koch and 
made sure that the IT agreement is evergreen and will work for these 
purposes. 

Please let me know what I can do to ensure that the nomination process works 
as smoothly as possible.  I will work with Daren and Liz to make sure that 
the purchase and sales tickets are moved to Koch.  Please let me know who is 
responsible for the Transport Usage ticket on Koch, if necessary, I will put 
the ticket in this afternoon.  We will be responsible for a $.02 Commodity 
fee, ACA of $.0022  and 1.6% fuel (monetizes to $.09 approximately) to move 
these volumes. 

ENA will be receiving 84,987 Dth at the plant and  delivering 83,627 into 
MidCon Texas.  We also have the option to deliver by displacement into MidCon 
at Goodrich or Edna, or displace deliveries to Koch Bayside.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need anything further from 
me.  

Mary

Thanks Darren, I appreciate it.  We all know how often Enerfin's numbers 
change. Chances are we would have had to reverse any entry we made.

somthing with this on our side and not involve the East Desk.

Is this date really June of 1999?  Hopefully we're not just finding out about 
this?

I don't think we can even process this request.  The East Desk was not up and 
running on Unify in June of 1999.  All of our pathing for June of 1999 was in 
Autonoms and it's not y2K compatabile. With the volumes involved being so 
small and the accuracy of the data at Enerfin in question, why don't we let 
this volume hit the new OBA at Enerfin as a PPA???

I welcome your thoughts.
Victor

Daren,

On the above mentioned dates, there was no nomination at the Enerfin meter.

6/3/99 and 6/8/99 revealed activity for ENA (202K).  Can the deal be extended 
for 6/4 (548 dec.) and 6/9 (40 dec.) to cover this flow so that Volume 
Management can create an accounting arrangement for these two days?

Thanks

Subject: Re: PGTT Meter 986884 - Dec Issue  

Sorry it took me so long to get back to you.  PG&E did not fully process the 
gas stream at their Indian Springs plant on December 12 and 13 and took the 
reduced shrinkage, 19.000 MMBtu/d, and sold it to HPL at Gas Daily -$0.04.  
PG&E did not have the right to do that, so they are going to allocate that 
volume to Comstock, from whom we will buy the gas at the beginng of the month 
index.  At the same time PG&E will create an imbalance, for which they will 
pay HPL the same amount HPL paid them for the gas for those two days.  This 
should wash the sale at Gas Daily and leave HPL buying the gas at the 
beginning of the month IFHSC ( the price in the Comstock purchase contract) 
and selling it at the Gas Daily price for 12/12 and 12/13.  The paperwork is 
on its way to me to close this issue out.

Ed,

Sherlyn has brought to my attention the deal I have attached below.  
Apparently we bot from PGE Industrial on the 12th and 13th.  PG&E has 
allocated an offsetting sale at the meter to TECO, and claim that they are 
net deals.  I do not show a sale in the system at the meter, and I checked 
the 215 K for those days for a corresponding delivery to TECO, perhaps at 
another meter, and could not find one.  

Any light you could shed on this issue would be appreciated.

Mary

I updated the June transport usage tickets today through HPL, and will be 
finishing these tickets tomorrow.  Rates have been updated to reflect current 
matrix rates and all baseload rates that I know of at this time.  I have not 
yet received third party transport rates, so if you know of any, please let 
me know.  Also, I have zeroed out some volumes on some tickets for June, so 
your schedulers will have to update volumes as they know them.  Rule of thumb 
was that if I had to add a month, I refreshed the rate but left volume at 
zero.  If the months were already on the ticket, then I refreshed the rate 
and left the volume as is.

I would advise that your schedulers check volumes on all pipes to ensure 
they're reflected in Position Manager correctly.  Please let me know if you 
have any questions.  All pipes will be updated by tomorrow morning.

Heidi

You can extend them, but make sure that the volume is zero.

Volume management was wondering if deals 137870 and 235670 needed to be 
extended into 2001.  These are deals with Teco.  Let me know if you need me 
to extend them.

 This is a follow up to the note I gave you on Monday, 4/3/00 { preliminary  
flow data provided by Daren}.

 Please override POP'S  daily volume{ presently zero}  to reflect  daily 
activity you can obtain from Gas Control.
 
 This change is needed  ASAP for economics purposes.

Yes, they are taken care of. But in the future we need to devise some sort of 
communication from Lisa Kinsey so if there
is a change with Cilco, it is communicated to either you or me or Aimee or 
Kenny or someone and it is reflected on our 
withdrawal report.

The Cilco volumes are different than the confirmed volumes to Cilco.  Please 
review the attached the spreadsheets from Lisa Kinsey, the central desk 
scheduler responsible for the Cilco account.  The biggest variance is in 
January 2000.  Cilco withdrew 200,000 mmbtu's more than we booked @ bammel.  
Please let me know the best way to correct the problem.  I suspect the 
variance is showing up as a transport imbalance.  Also, the nomination for 
the current month is 7,327 mmbtu instead of 7,000 mmbtu per day.  7,000 is 
the volume delivered to Cilco after transport fuel.

Subject: Producer Shut-in list for Victoria 18" line work

George, 

Gary called me about this Shut In situation a few minutes ago, specifically 
regarding Meter 6722.  This meter is at the tailgate of Three Rivers, 
therefore, an HPL field employee will not be able to contact the producer 
(they probably have no idea where the gas is coming from that goes through 
this meter).  

Gary suggested that the deal maker contact these producers verbally, and then 
Connie Sutton will follow up with written notice.  Per our discussion, since 
Mary Jo and Gary are out this afternoon, I am forwarding this message to you. 

The concerned contracts are:  Cody Texas, LP, 012-64365-101, 96018049 and 
Samson Lone Star, 012-77555-105, 96016761.

Let me know if there is further information that I can provide.

Thank you, 
Melissa

Recap of PG&E Texas meeting 4/12/00.

Volume Issues:
? Sherlyn Schumack will provide Stacey Neuweiler with volume variances by d=

and contract as soon as possible (preferably the same day allocation is=20
received).
? Stacey will notify Sherlyn of correct volume or status if further researc=
h=20
is necessary as soon as possible.
? Sherlyn will notify logistics, Stacey, and Lorraine of PG&E Texas of=20
interconnect variances by day.
? Each group will respond promptly to ensure payment can be made through th=
e=20
system, eliminating manual line items on invoice.
? Charlotte Hawkins will see what was confirmed on the outstanding=20
interconnect issue for 2/00, and Daren or Charlotte will make the necessary=
=20
correction. =20

Rate Issues:
? Heidi Withers will pull daily rates from PG&E Texas bulletin board.
? Greg Steagall will provide Heidi with service verification(s) and the dai=
ly=20
allocation summary received from PG&E Texas during close, which shows rates=
=20
from PG&E Texas.
? No action will be taken on rate variances where PG&E was paid per their=
=20
invoice.  Heidi has talked with Brenda Herod, and Brenda is okay with this=
=20
course of action.=20
? There are four invoices from 1999 production where PG&E was underpaid, so=
=20
Heidi and Greg will work to correct those months to pay PG&E correctly. =20
There are no open invoices in Settlements.
? It was noted that manual line items are not to be used to pay PG&E per=20
their invoice in the future.  We expect to correct issues in the system pri=
or=20
to the due date of the invoice unless there is a valid disagreement between=
=20
ENA and PG&E.  If ENA has a valid disagreement, we will pay per ENA=01,s=20
verification.

Daren has put in a request for legal to transfer the ENA transport contract=
s=20
to HPL.   This would eliminate Stacey having to schedule the transport on E=
NA=20
as well as the desk to desk deal.  It would also prevent Sherlyn from havin=
g=20
to allocate the transport expense contract and the brokered desk to desk=20
deal. =20
He has not had a response from legal yet.

Here is a followup to the memo sent on 12/31/99.  FYI


Enron Field Services   -  Has not been nominated since September 99.  Have we 
stopped doing business on this pipe?  (Just an FYI - ?)  Do we need to get 
this assigned?  I can find old
   notes and try to get this pathed if necessary.  Someone just needs to let 
me know. Unresolved - appears to be unassigned?

Lavaca Expense Transport -  This is offsystem gas that HPLC Transports for 
ENA.  ENA has no nom at meter 1000 in Pops for Jan 1. Unresolved

MidCon Texas Pipeline   -  There were deals left unpathed for Jan 1 (and 
Dec?).  I brokered and nominated the obvious but we seem to have 10,000 with 
transport contract to move this    gas on and no sale to broker to.  As it 
stands, it looks like we have a long position.  Who is this assigned to?  I 
thought Carlos was handling this one, but I could    be wrong.  Unresolved

Channel Industries Pipeline  -  Several issues here:

 1. All Deals with the exception of the long term Transport Expense were left 
unpathed for Jan 1.  I viewed prior month transactions and pathed 
appropriately.  Someone
  needs to review for accuracy. Also, there were deals that went to zero, 
that were nominated for January.  Resolved but needs to be verified.

 2. We still do not have enough supply to meet our sales requirement.  This 
issue has been left unsresolved since October 99.  Volume Management cannot 
allocate was is
  not pathed and nominated.  Unresolved or Unpathed?

 3. There is a transaction for January that is once again not on our point 
specific transport contracts.  (Rec Mtr 1-6366 10,000 to Del Mtr 2-6203 
10,000).  This is a pathed pipeline. We have no rate.  We need to know the 
rate and whether one of the expense contracts needs to be amended for this 
transaction, we are not legally covered.  Carlos was handling this pipe in 
Dec.  Who is this assigned to for Jan? Unresolved

HPL Operational -  This Shipper on HPL has been left unpathed for December 
and January 1.  Who is this assigned to?  This can wait until we get back 
next week.  If it is left     unresolved, I will get it pathed when I return. 
I haven't had time to do this yet.  If we haven't figured out the assignement 
then I will get to it asap.

I noticed that the Midcon transport usage tickets at Oakville & Moore are not

transport.  Should they?  Let me know if you want me to set up new tickets if

Imbalances:
 I would like us to continue to pursue Channel/ El Paso/ Tenngasco for our 
payback.  They got our cashout number last week, where do they stand.  
Again,  I think Robert is an ally and I do not want to irritate him but 
things will not get any better in the future.  We need to resolve this 
imbalance.  Can we net some  of these contracts?
I like Mary Poorman's report; however I have questions:
 How can we miss black marlin so completely?  do we agree with this imbalance?
 Can we net all the Chevron and Dynegi contracts together for payback to 
Keith once we get the AR issue solved?
 Where do we stand on the Columbia Energy resolution?
 Where do we stand on the NGPL reconcilliation?
 Duke Energy 206 is still a problem.
 Do we need all these Amoco contracts they have 8, that seems like a large 
number to me, can we net some of them?
 Are we charging enough for the swing we get at the paper plant on the Entex 
contract?
 Is there a way to keep Tejas in line at Southern Union this winter?  That 
meter will really swing then and I do not know how much line pack they have 
the  right to use.
 Can we net the Corpus Christi gas marketing and all the Tejas/ Coral/Gulf 
Energy/Shell imbalances down?  How is the reconcillitation going?
 Can we smash the Entex and the Reliant contracts together so we can get rid 
of some of these contracts?  They have 9, that seems like a lot to me.
 Gulfmark is gone down the road can we check with someone about this 
contract, it seems like we should be able to net these volumes against some  
where we are owed?
 Is this Lone Star 213 imbalance real, if so how do we resolve?
 Where did the Exxon imbalance come from?
 Do we need 5 Texaco transportation contracts, can we get rid of some?
 Can we combine the Vastar and the Southern imbalances?
 What is the Webb/Duval do, can we get rid of it, combine this with Midcon, 
how old is this imbalnce?

Mick update the compressor fuel on the P/L but the new numbers do not seem to 
translate up to the profit calculation?  Can we do something about this?
I thought the imbalance report I got this Wed was pretty sad.  Some of the 
columns did not add and there seemed to be a lot of missing information.  Can 
we resolve this?
I am concerned about our capacity positons in the future, we are going to 
have to work on a better way to check our positions.
I had a meeting with Tom Shelton and our representative to the RRC, James 
Mann, the RRC is concerned about this winter and they have asked us to 
compile a list of customers we will cut based upon the priority we filed with 
the RRC several years ago.  Lauri will have a copy of the priority list.  We 
need to compile this list and get Tom and James comfortable with the 
process.  The last thing we need is the RRC hammering on us, when can we get 
this list?  I think we should be able to get something out of the contract 
system.  Jackie Morgan is who I would approach.

Daren:

During the period of 12/1/99 through 3/31/00 gas flowed into HPL's pipeline 
at the above meter.  The gas volumes that flowed are as follows:

12/1/99 - 12/31/99                   1,457  Mmbtus
01/1/00 - 01/31/00                         49  Mmbtus
02/1/00 - 02/29/00               7  Mmbtus
03/1/00 - 03/31/00               4  Mmbtus

         1,517  Mmbtus

Prior to 12/1/99, the volumes were being purchased from High Sierra Operating 
LLC under contract #96003435  Deal #26611 which have terminated.  Currently, 
Logistics has these volumes recorded to HPL Stranger Gas Contract.  In order 
to correct this, HPL Logistics needs either a new deal to record these 
volumes which have flowed into HPL's pipeline, or Logistics needs approval to 
write-off these volumes to Unaccounted for Gas Loss.  (Please print, sign, 
and return the original to Clem Cernosek).

any revisions as they arise.  Additionally, I have highlighted those deals 
that we expect to come on in February, at such time will we request tickets 
to be entered into sitara.

Hi Daren,

As per our phone conversation I sent you a fax, but I also wanted to let you 
have an electronic copy of the failed deals which need to be booked into 
SITARA. Attached is the detail on the six trades in question. Thanks!

If you guys remeber, I reminded you all last Tuesday, 5/30, in our staff 
meeting to be on the look-out for the attached message from James re: 5/00 
hours.  The deadline was Friday, 6/2, and unfortunately, very few of you 
responded.  I understand how busy each of you are and you have expressed your 
concerns on the process burdening you.  However, there are pressures 
internally to provide information to Sr. Management on a more timely basis.  
We need to do our part.  Please respond ASAP, but no later than Thursday, 
6/8.  Please contact Jennifer or Shari if you have any questions or need any 
help.

Additionally, for those of you who are involved in Bridgeline, we will be 
preparing a bid for our services going forward per a discussion I had with 
Trevor yesterday.  Therefore, the May drivers are very critical to that 
process also.

So everyone, please get your info in ASAP.  I appreciate your help.

Subject: May Hours Survey

Attached please find the Hours Survey and Instructions for the month of May, 
2000.

I am sending the survey out this time as an opportunity to introduce myself 
to those of you I have not yet met.  I am being asked to take a direct roll 
in the further development and rollout of the Operations Pricing Model (fka 
Transaction Cost Model).  In the past, I have directed the implementation of 
several pricing systems based on activity based costing similar to the 
Operations Pricing Model (OPM).  Over the past couple of weeks my 
observations of the Model have lead me to be concerned with the quality of 
data used in the model.  It will take efforts by both you and the OPM team to 
get to a satisfactory level of data quality.  This process can start with 
this months data collection efforts.  Please pay particular attention this 
month as the "bar is being raised" by the management of Energy Operations for 
data quality and timeliness.

While completing the survey, take this time to review last month's numbers. 
Please return these surveys to Shari Mao by end of day Friday, June 2.  

Please note the following changes:
The Nat Gas RC's will now see deal validation and transportation rate 
activities therefore, these surveys will be notably longer but will not 
necessarily take more time

If the survey does not contain an activity that your team spends time on, 
PLEASE DO NOT TYPE ANY ACTIVITIES IN THE SURVEY.  Contact Jennifer Reside at 
#35971 to discuss how to proceed.

If you have any questions relating to the model or this survey, or are unable 
to meet the survey due date, please call Jennifer Reside at #35971 (Shari is 
on vacation this week).

Subject: EOL Deal Ids In Path Manager

As you're aware, we're having to bridge Houston Street ids into Unify from 
Sitara.  

We are being asked, as a requirement, to not display the EOL id on statements 
that are identified as "Broker EOL trade" deals originating from EOL.  We 
have two options to accomodate this requirement:

Option 1 is to have the modify the bridge code to not bridge over the EOL 
deal id if the deal is a "Broker EOL trade"  deal.  One of the drawbacks of 
this option is that you won't be able to referenence the EOL id on the Path 
Manager for these related deals.  All other deals will have the EOL deal id, 
if applicable.  The EOL id would not show up on the statements because it 
wouldn't be populated.

Option 2 is to modify several areas of code in the Settlements area which may 
be more time consuming.  The obvious code change would be in the statement 
generation area as well as other report type information.  

Option 2 allows you the greatest flexibility while Option 1 may be quicker to 
implement.  

Please pass this along to others in your group and get feedback.  Please 
share your thoughts....
I've attached an email explaining the Broker EOL trades.  This is not to be 
confused with Broker deals done at a given point with not transportation.  
These will continue to come across as you'd normally expect.

Any questions, please ask...

Thanks!

Gerald/Eric-

I have a couple of questions regarding TGLO transport contract 
012-88494-202.  We are currently delivering a volume of 28.000mm into various 
Midcon interconnects on this contract that are designated to go to 
Reliant/Entex for the purpose of heating HISD schools.  The transport 
contract stipulates different rates for this delivery depending on whether 
the gas is intended for state facilities or not.  My first question, then, 
is:  are HISD schools considered state facilities?  And, if HISD schools are 
considered state facilities, does the fact that this gas is being delivered 
to them via Reliant/Entex utilizing Midcon's pipe make any difference?

I am asking these questions not only to assure that we are recouping the 
correct transport rate, but also to determine what the consequences might be 
if I interrupt this delivery.  We are having difficulty getting enough gas 
into Midcon to cover our Entex noms and I am just exploring my options.  I 
would also expect that this volume should decrease when HISD closes for the 
Christmas holidays- does the fact that this is an IT agreement give me enough 
leverage to cut this nom if TGLO does not do so voluntarily?

Thanks for your help.

Please find attached spreadsheet that compares hot days from May 2000 and May 2001.  There are two tabs, one tab contains the days May 16-18, 2000 and the other tab contains the days May 14-18, 2001.  Each tab contains both the load data and temp data particular to the days in question.  The days most directly comparable are May 17, 2001 (Thursday) and May 18, 2000 (Thursday), although the two days preceding May 18, 2000 were slightly warmer than the two days preceding May 17, 2001.  The peak on 5/17/2001, 44,923 MW, is 2.78% higher than the peak on 5/18/2000, 43,709 MW.  With similarly warm days before 5/17/2001 as there were before 5/18/2000, the peak would obviously have been even higher.  This would put the year-over-year growth in excess of 3%.  I believe this falls right in line with the growth rate year-over-year from an earlier analysis, somewhere in the range of 3.5% to 4%.  

Let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Darren:
I have a price issue with MGI Supply for January 2001.  For deal 551414, we have tiered pricing for days 13-16.  The first 20,000 at $8.71 and everything over at Agua Dulce GDP + $0.01.  MGI has the deal priced at the GDP + $0.01 only.  They do not have the $8.71.  Should this pricing be tiered?  MGI would owe us $10,600.00 if we go with their pricing.

Daren,
Just a quick note to follow up on UA4 issues.

For desk to desk deals, we are keeping the entry on co 89 since there is not 
a Co 16 contract with Co 16 and attaching an ECT transport contract to the 
backscreen.

On Park and ride deals, I am under the impression that the Park and ride deal 
would be booked to an 089 contract and cleared either intra month or in a 
subsequent month.
If this is true, was it done by reversing out or offsetting the previous Co 
89 entry.  I am not sure whether an ECT transport should be attached.  I hope 
you have some insight on this issue.

Let me know
HC

Julie,

Deal 640685 for March 01 production:  per Daren Farmer (in the Audit field in Sitara), this was copied from deal #547201.  This deal is the Crude Swap where volume stayed but price got zeroed out and booked as a demand charge under 679847 and 679848.

Please confirm that it is the Crude Swap and rebook as necessary.

If you have any questions or need additional clarification, please let me or Katherine H. know.

Thanks in advance for your help on this matter.

547201 & 591307 has been zeroed out.  679847 & 679848 have been created between ENA & HPLC.  679859 has been created for the sale to EGM from ENA Wellhead.  I have placed both January and February on that deal.

If this will not work, please let me know.

Thanks!!

George - I've done some T-accounts (the bean counter in me) and I think the following is the best way to handle this going forward:
	
Change the existing deals, 547201 and 591307, to a zero price.  This will eliminate the A/R balance on HPL's books for GLO, but will keep the volume nom'd to GLO and will not impact UA4.
Enter a ticket on HPL for a sale to ENA for the value of the gas that was zeroed out on the above tickets.  This should be entered as a demand charge only and the amounts should be $974,144 for 1/01 and $766,304 for 2/01.
Enter a ticket on ENA where the ENA-Wellhead Book purchases the demand from HPL.  The amounts would be the same as in #2 above.
Enter a ticket on ENA where the ENA-Wellhead Book sells demand to EGM for the value of the crude oil for the prior month.  For 1/01, the sale would be for $886,638.60 (the 12/00 Crude Oil delivered to EGM by GLO).  For 2/01, the sale would be for $839,008.29 (the 1/01 Crude Oil delivered to EGM by GLO).

This will require the following steps be taken monthly as this deal goes forward:
The price on the sale from HPL to GLO will need to be zeroed out monthly.
The demand charges on steps 2 and 3 will have to be updated to reflect the value zeroed out.
The demand charges on step 4 will have to be updated to reflect the value of the crude delivered to EGM.

Once this is done, the A/R balance for GLO will be cleared, the margin will be on the ENA Wellhead book, and the intercompany transactions will move the money from EGM to HPL.  This needs to be done monthly prior to flash, which will prevent any OA variances.  The index for the gas value is available shortly after the 1st of the month, and since the volume is firm, there shouldn't be a problem calculating the value.  We should also know the value of the crude oil so that we can flash the sale from ENA to EGM.  If you have any questions or see a better way to do this, please let me know.  Thanks.

Subject: Koch Three Rivers, #6722

Aimee-

Gas control has some line work scheduled for 1/4,5,6 that will affect the 
referenced point.  Dynegy has nom'd 1800 at this point which I'm assuming 
they'll want baseload for January.  The desk also appears to have some gas 
nom'd out here (approx 1200mm).   Rather than cut these volumes, would you 
try to negotiate with Koch not to flow this gas during the outage, but to 
make it up as soon as the outage is over (they may be able to begin flow on 
1/6)?  Please let me know as soon as possible.

Thanks.

Changes are in blue.

Last month there was some confusion from several schedulers I spoke to about when changes could be made to (August) after the cut off:  As noted in the table, after Friday, August 31st at 6PM there can be no changes (i.e. re-nominate, re-track, re-balance, bridge back to Sitara etc.) made to August production until Wednesday morning, September 5th.  

At 6PM Friday (or before if you are ready) I will be by to pick up the reports and exceptions dialogue.

thx

I received an invoice from PG&E Texas Industrial Energy for 6/00 production 
and I do not see one of the pieces in Unify.  They are invoicing us for 
50,000 MMBtu at 4.16 on 6/13.  Is this a good deal?  If it is, please tell me 
the deal number.  I checked path manager and I do not see anything there 
either.

Thanks,

Please have the operating companies for both Daren Farmer and Stacey 
Neuweiler moved from Enron North America (Co 413) to Houston Pipeline Company 
(012) ASAP.  Additionally, if possible, please have payroll ensure that their 
wages are not double dipped on Social Security.  The business reason for the 
move is for compliance with the Railroad Commission's Code of Conduct.  There 
is one other employee, Ami Chokshi, in Daren's RC which needs to remain as 
ENA until I get a ruling from Legal.  The RC remains the same, 1497.  
additionally, it is my understanding that there is no problem with multiple 
operating companies within a group.

Let me know if you need anything further.

Hal, as per our discussion here are the Logistics people that will be 
dedicated to the ENom development:

Key subject experts:

The Logistics managers for each of the various regions will be the key 
subject expert and will pull in the added resources (individual pipeline 
schedulers) for the really detailed work. As far as time dedicated we will 
commit to as much time as needed with the understanding that these 
individuals do have the responsibility for managing all of the scheduling 
activity in their regions. Bottom line is during bid-week and when 
emergencies develop they will be needed at their trading desks. All meetings 
with these individuals should be scheduled for the afternoon. 

Kathy Kelly - Northeast
Ed Terry - Southeast
Randy Gay - West
George Smith - Central
Darren Farmer - Texas


Project Steering Team:

Bob Superty
Randy Gay
George Smith

As discussed we might have to bring in others when the product starts to take 
shape and is impacting other areas (Global for example)


I look forward to our next meeting, thanks - Bob x30957

Daren,

I am handling CP&L and am trying to resolve this issue from February production.  CP&L shows 5,000 mmbtu on February 21, but we do not have a deal.  Were you able to find anything out about this?

Thanks for your help.

Can we verified this gas flowed?  If it did it should have been billed on his term deal if there was one in place.  If the gas flowed and we did not invoice for it on term let me know and I will put it in.

Because the payback was done for October 2001, we can't do it in POPS so we will have to make manual entries to clear the imbalance from the books and show the sale from HPL to ENA.

Rita, 
What time frame do intend to do this in?  I believe this contract is no longer effective after May 31, so if it is in October you will have to reactivate the transport contract so you can book it in POPS.

I talked to Daren and he's going to put a deal in the system for the
sale of the gas from ENA to AEP, so there would be no need for a manual

Daren - Meter 1591 has never flowed the entire nom.  This meter is has been 
over nominated.  It has had a nom of 1.000/day (429.000 total mmbtus) since 
1/28/99 and has flowed only 11.692.  Am I correct to say that this meter 
needs a lower nom?  Please let me know if I should look out for a lower nom 
in May.  Pat seems to think this may be affecting the P/L for April.  We only 
have estimates/actuals of zero on 4/1 & 4/2.  

Please let me know if this makes sense.

Hi Daren,
I received an email from Kenny Soignet to make sure everything was in the 
system for me to pay Cannon on Friday, 5/19/00.
The deal # is 257141.  I see that the volume has not been scheduled, so 
therefore it is not pulling into unify for me to pay.  
Are you the person that will be able to schedule the volume in order for me 
to pull up this deal?
( I see that in sitara that the deal is set for 5/00 production, does that 
matter? )

Thanks, Stephanie ( 3-6004 )

I'm trying to get this to pull through to Unify for payment to Spinnaker. Volume Management shows "no detail".
Sitara indicated  685 mmbut 4/1-4/30 expected.
Who needs to talk to who to get this fixed.
Payment MUST be set up by noon 5/24/01 for prompt payment to Spinnaker.
Thank you and Please advise.

I received the above allocation for this deal where there is a purchase from Spinnaker and a sale to Dow.  The volumes have not be actualized so there is nothing in Volume Management.  Can one of you look into this and get back to me.

It is my understanding the outages Valero incurred at the above locations are 
force majure situations during December and should not trigger the buyback 
feature of the contract.

Gary, I have not seen any documentation of this from Valero. Please follow up 
with your counterpart to secure the letter of notice or we will need to 
process the deal as if the buyback is active.

Thanks

Ray Calles (TETCO) told me today that he will put the OBA in the mail either 
tonight or first thing Monday.

Thanks for your help.

Daren,

I know it's first of the month but the above meter has flow for 3/15 (71 
dec.) and 3/23 (35 dec.) but the deal (Sitara #213005) doesn't cover these 
two days.

Can you see if it is feasible to activate these two days in Sitara so that I 
can clear my exceptions for Volume Management?

Thanks

My contact at Beaumont Methanol asked me to tell everybody in our shop the 
following:  to clarify whom to contact about the nomination and scheduling 
for Beaumont Methanol at meter # 1428.

First some background:  we feed Beaumont Methanol through a meter station 
that we own and control, but which also feeds Brandywine/DuPont.  In fact, 
the gas goes through a DuPont pipeline header downstream of our meter station 
before it gets to Beamont Methanol.  Sometimes we are doing business with 
both Beaumont Methanol and Brandywine/DuPont ..... but sometime we only do 
business with one of them.

WHOM TO CALL FOR ANY NOMINATIONS AND SCHEDULING ISSUES FOR BEAUMONT METHANOL:

Bob Dorcheus - Brandywine/DuPont - 281-293-1789
Chyral Hankins - Beaumont Methanol (Terra) - 712-233-6558

PLEASE DO NOT CALL THE BEAUMONT METHANOL CONTROL ROOM AT THE PLANT WITH 
REGARD TO SCHEDULING AND NOMINATION ISSUES.   THEY ARE OUT OF THE LOOP ON 
THESE ISSUES.  If we call the Beaumont Methanol control room at the plant 
with regard to scheduling and nominations issues, it will cause confusion of 
the type we had yesterday and today.

Obviously, it is of course OK for HPL Gas Control to call the Beaumont 
Methanol plant control room on any emergency operational issues.

Thanks ... and have a great weekend.

Lee

There have been so many CILCO issues until I'm not sure which one you are 
referencing.  If it relates to the CILCO sale that has created the large 
receivable balance, then we are waiting on a response from Daren.  I met with 
Daren and Kenny and we all agree that the sale between ENA-TX and CILCO is 
invalid and that the sale has to be with the storage book (your group will 
not have to do anything with this sale).  The problem lies in the associated 
transport with that sale.  This is the piece that we need Daren's help on.  I 
will touch base with Daren and see if we can get this resolved this week.  If 
this is not what you are referring to, please let me know.  Thanks!

Do you have any information on this?  Fred, I know you were in the meeting we

the logistics representative was.

Lisa, no I have not seen the adjustments come across for the summer months 
(off-peak) that we talked about at the meeting last month. Rita Wynn's group 
(Fred B.) is making the volume adjustments in Unify volume management and 
that has not been made as of last week when I talked to him. If you have any 
questions about this you might get with Rita are Fred.

Thanks, Jeff

Gary:

HPL received  volumes at the above meter during 1/1/99 thru 6/99.  Prior to 
1/1/99, ENA was purchasing some of the volumes from I P Petroleum under 
contract #016-44386-102; Deal #341832.   This deal expired 12/31/99, but the 
volumes continued to flow and be allocated to I P Petroleum by Pioneer.   
Since there was no deal to cover these volumes, these volumes were allocated 
to HPL Strangers Gas Contract.  

Volume Mgmt had previously requested a deal to cover these volumes from 
someone, but never received one.

Here are the months and volumes that need resolution:

Prod. Mth Mmbtus
Jan. 99    6,510 
Feb. 99    6,395
Mar. 99  14,789
Apr. 99  16,866
May. 99    8,415
Jun.  99  13,858

Total  66,833


Possible Solution:

1.  Need a Deal to cover the periods in question, or
2.  Provide authorization to writeoff the volumes.  (Print & return original 
to Clem Cernosek)

 
                                                                              
                                                                        
 APPROVAL to Writeoff the volumes to Unaccounted for Gas Loss

PS:   My understanding is that neither  I P Petroleum nor Pioneer have 
addressed any issues concerning these volumes.

the 14 decatherms that flowed on the 15th.

jACKIE, 

You need to talk to the East desk to see if they were allocated this extra 
gas on the 14th and 15th.  If they were, we can change the deal.  If not, the 
pipes will need to balance out during the next flow day.

During the period of 1/1/99 thru 7/31/00, the above meter has recorded flow 
on the following days:

    Days          Mmbtus
 3/30/99  22
 4/30/99  21
 8/3/99    5

 4/27/00  13
 7/31/00  18 

                203

Currently, these volumes are being booked under the HPL Strangers Gas 
Contract.  Logistics needs either a deal to record these volumes which have 
flowed into HPL's Pipeline or  Logistics need approval to writeoff these 
volumes to Unaccounted for Gas.

Thanks, Clem

10-31-99	    23

We used deal 83388 last January to write off this meter's HPL Strangers balances.  How should this flow be handled?

According to the contract the pricing of the gas we are selling back to 
Cannon is a WACOG of what we bought it for this summer.  Here is the 
calculation of the WACOG.  Let me know if there are any questions/comments.

I did a search and found no deals for May for this counterparty.  Call
Daren Farmer at 713-853-6905, and he could probably put the deal in for
you.

Julie -
Need your help again....
D&H gas Company, faxed their 05/01 volume support for HPL Meter 428
(980428), whihc reflects ENA gas sales to D&H for 5/11/01, 143 mmbtu and
5/31/01 for 286 mmbtu for a total of 429 mmbtu for 05/01. he deal last
month (04/01), was SA-70120. I don't have see a  sales draft  under ENA or
HPL for 05/01 sales to D&H, nor do I see any 05/01 sales deal under
SA-70120.

Can you assist me in finding out if there was a sale to D&H in 05/01, and
if so, what is the deal number and where is sales draft?

Thanks!
Tess

>From this mornings morning meeting, it is my understanding that the gas from 
McMullen into Humble (then King Ranch) will ve lowered due to line pigging 
for the next few days.  Please keep in mind that there are interstate sales 
out of King Ranch.  You may want to notify the traders that there will not be 
as much supply in King Ranch to meet these sales.

I have estimates for the sales and supply for the 27th.

Total Interstate sales out of the King Ranch Gas Plant = 26,422 MMBtu

Total Supply (less PVR) =     

Cage Ranch  = 37,600
Forest Oil  =  3,696
LaEncantada  =     767
Big Cowboy  = 34,697
Three Rivers(Current) = 18690


Total Supply For Sale on 27th.    = 95,450 MMBtu

These supply volumes are based on the Supply Deals in the Unify system.  If 
there are variances operationally, then the Sitara Supply Deals should be 
lowered appropriately.

make a new one for 2001.  They have flow in Jan. This is giving me a meter

FYI,  I was watching the position manager for ENA and noticed some business 
transactions on this pipeline.  This pipeline was bought by Duke Energy Field 
Services effective 8/1/99.  All HPLC transactions were moved to that pipe at 
that time.  The CES transactions that are current on this pipe should be 
moved to Duke Energy Field Services.  I believe the pipe was renamed when 
they bought it back in June or July.

If you have any questions, or want to verify this information, I would check 
with the Global contracts dept.

Here is the spreadsheet for April....let me know if you have any questions.  I also sent it to Katherine Herrera, and I think Paul Couvillan will be taking it over pretty soon from Katherine.

Daren I have three meters that have flow in Feb but no deal.

1.  Meter 0416  flowed the whole month  1-28.  This our ols friends at Pawnee 
gas plant fuel.  Last deal used was 289396 could you extend it.
2. meter 1601 had flow on the 15 &18.  This is Southern union Lockhart.  Last 
deal used with them was 285350 Hpl or 259208 ENA. 
3. Meter 1598 had flow the whole month 1-28.  This is MT Enterprise C/G- 
Panther.  The last deal used  is 284 620

I'll get Accounting Arrangements for these when you let me know the deal 
status and get them cleared up. Thanks.

Daren - Is there a reason there is a nom of 20.000/day at meter 385?  This is 
a non-allocatable meter.

I extended the deal 462490 for 11/21 to cover the extra volume.  There is a 
path in Unify already so Volume Mgt. should be able actualize volumes.

Victor,

Can you extend deal #465490 to cover a flow volume of 141 dec. for 11/21/2000?

Daren,

Can you extend deal #465322 for cover a flow volume of 140 dec. for

Thanks

Subject: Tuesday, December 26th

We will need a small staff to handle potential trades for Wed. the 27th.  
Most of the pipelines are out of the office, so I would expect the work load 
to be minimal.  I plan on coming in, and would like to have a minimum of 
three on staff, so I need two volunteers (one offsystem, just in  case).  If 
anyone is going to be in town, please forward a number, in case we need to 
call any additional people in, or have you work on a laptop from home.  I 
will get with you after the new year to make up the holiday you miss, or, you 
can schedule your day now, I have the calendars.  Also, I will be out on 
vacation Friday, Dec. 22nd and will need someone to send the nominations to 
the plants, I don't expect to have full system coverage, just HPL/HPL and 
HPL/ENA as needed.  Let me know if you are interested in learning how to do 
this.

Thank you,

Mary

Subject: Wholesale Volumes - August


It's that time again for the monthly and quarterly volumetric explanations!  
The database for August is now ready for viewing.  Just as a reminder, this 
is the shortcut on your desktop called "Statistical Database". 

As there is continued investor focus on our Wholesale Operations, Investor 
Relations requests that Business Analysis & Reporting provide monthly 
volumetric analysis for Wholesale Operations in addition to the quarterly 
analysis.  Please review the analysis for August 2000 and provide 
explanations for all material changes (+/- 10%) for the year/year, 
quarter/quarter, and month/month variances.  The current objective of 
Investor Relations is to use this analysis as a resource to answer potential 
investor or analyst questions, but it may be used for ad hoc requests and 
presentations.   It is essential that the volumes be verified by commercial 
personnel.

Please forward your verification and explanations via e-mail to me by 10:00am 
Friday, September 22.  Please feel free to call with any questions.

Thanks,

Misti

Deal #276494 ended June 15, but there is additional flow on meter #9602 from 
the 16th thru the 30th.  Could you extend this deal thru the 30th so that I 
can have Vol. Management create an accounting arrangement for it.  If you are 
not the person that I need to contact, could you let me know who I need to

This is to confirm our telephone conversation of earlier today in which we advised that the October 5, 1998 Contract for Sale of Natural Gas between Lower Colorado River Authority, Buyer, and Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp., Seller, for Natural Gas Supply to T. C. Ferguson Power Plant, Sim Gideon Power Plant and Hilbig Storage has NOT been transferred to Houston Pipe Line Company and/or AEP Energy Services, Inc.  Rather, the Contract remains an asset of Enron North America.  You should contact Tom Martin at 713.853.3079 to discuss this Contract.

Charlotte,

There is an interconnect variance at meter 980071 for 2/99.   It appears the 
variance is created on 2/9/99 and 2/10/99.  There is a transport usage deal 
ticket 72893 in Sitara which shows PG&E delivers 6,965 mmbtu to HPL on 2/9/99 
and 3,683 mmbtu on 2/10/99, but HPL does not show a receipt of this volume.   
Let me know if you need the PG&E support.

1. This is a valid flow.  Could you please extend the deal from Dec. (deal #

I am getting several phone calls from Alpine Resources demanding to be paid 
for meter 5892 and there is nothing there to be paid.  

The person name doing the requesting is John Childers and he said that he 
spoke to Daren Farmer.  He is looking for 859 mmbtu's for December, 2000 and 
3,251 mmbtu's for January 2001 .  This is on the Katy Gas Unit.  If anyone 
would like to talk to John his phone number is 281-646-0232

The plant went down at 0001 hrs this morning. My information is they moved 
their turnaround up and will be down for as long as 3 weeks. Please let us 
know how the economics should be handled---- buyback, force majure, no deal, 
or what.

Hi Daren,
I spoke with Ricky Archer at Calpine about some penalty charges I billed him 
for undertakes on Dec 20, 21, 31.
He said force majeure letters were sent to your attention.

If you have them, would you have someone fax a copy of those letters to met 
at 713-646-8420?

Do you have any other information on the force majure or should I speak with 
Jennifer?

Thanks for your help!

this file to AEP by Tueday morning unless I hear of any objection.  The

I have a volume issue with meter 986315 for 1/00 production.  The volume has 
been split between El Sordo and Torch Rally.  I think all of the volume 
should be under Torch Rally.  Please let me know if you find something 
different.  The old months have already been corrected.

Duke will be paid 9/22 for  May 2000 through July 2000.  We should have the 
August 2000 invoice by the end of next week. Megan Parker is handling this 
deal going forward and has contacted Duke to request an invoice for August.  
Megan was not receiving invoices, and since it is our policy to withhold 
payment unless we are invoiced, payment was not made on this until now.

Kris, 

Please forward this to the appropriate person.

We are buying gas from Duke at the Trevino Plant on Gulf Energy (Tejas) 
Pipeline.  This is a purchase that we obtained with the CES deal.  Duke 
(Laura Bates) has called, saying that they have not received payment in 4 or 
5 months.  The deal in Sitara is #145125.  Please look into this and let me 
know where we stand.

Thanks.

Subject: Tuesday, December 26th

We will need a small staff to handle potential trades for Wed. the 27th.  
Most of the pipelines are out of the office, so I would expect the work load 
to be minimal.  I plan on coming in, and would like to have a minimum of 
three on staff, so I need two volunteers (one offsystem, just in  case).  If 
anyone is going to be in town, please forward a number, in case we need to 
call any additional people in, or have you work on a laptop from home.  I 
will get with you after the new year to make up the holiday you miss, or, you 
can schedule your day now, I have the calendars.  Also, I will be out on 
vacation Friday, Dec. 22nd and will need someone to send the nominations to 
the plants, I don't expect to have full system coverage, just HPL/HPL and 
HPL/ENA as needed.  Let me know if you are interested in learning how to do 
this.

Thank you,

Mary

Daren,

There are two purchases at the above referenced meter for the 28th of Oct., 
1999.   Gas flowed without a purchase from the29th through the 31st.  Please 
let me know if we should be paying the swing parties(deal tickets117738 and 
120359) , or how I should allocate the volume.  

Thank you for your time and patience!!

Daren,

Mary Gregg from LCRA said that Sitara #283939 should have been for 
$4.50/MMBtu.  Currently in Deal Manager-Sitara, it is at $2.50 and that is 
the price that I billed them at.  Please verify the price and let me know 
what you find out.

If you have any question, please, call me.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Equistar has requested a scheduling/nomination change retroactive to January 
1. 

At the start of the month, Janice nominated a small volume to meter # 1165 
(or maybe it was to # 1266), DuPont Victoria.

Equistar wants that volume to go to meter # 1552 instead, for the whole month 
of Jan.

Any questions - call me at 3.5923

Thanks

The gas looks like it is not allocating correctly in Jan.
I have not researched as to why, but if you like I can come down and go over 
some things to help identify and correct these kinds of problems.

Let me know.

Darren,

Thank you for such a prompt response. When looking in the Volume Management, I saw volume scheduled in ENA and ENA Upstream.  I actualized in ENA  and I heard that Blue Dolphin will go to upstream starting July production month.  Could you confirm which entity for the month of June?  

Thanks!

I spoke with Nelson Ferries today.  We are responsible for the transport fees on Blue Dolphin for June.  I have pathed the volumes in Unify.  Please look into this and let me know if you have any questions.  Additionally, I input the purchase and sale deals that were not in the system.  Can you please inform the appropriate person in settlements to handle those deals?

As you might already know we had to reschedule our second meeting that was 
scheduled for Wednesday 2/16 to Tuesday 2/22 in room 3013. Lunch will be 
provided. I apologize and will avoid rescheduling our meetings in the future. 
I was encouraged by the excellent dialogue and contribution at our first 
meeting and believe we have the right group together to make the changes we 
know are needed in our work hours. 

Here is the list of items we agreed to cover at the next meeting:

Schedulers were going to touch base with their pipeline reps and other 
contacts on the different schedules they are using and document and discuss 
at the next meeting.

Each manager was going to discuss with their group what would work best for 
their desk and present this to the group at our next meeting

Bob was going to gather information on external 12 hour schedules and follow 
up with HR on schedules being used at Enron



The following is what I heard at the first meeting:

Our first item should be to establish a weekend and holiday schedule that 
would more or less guarantee (other than maybe an occasional call) you have 
the weekend off.  Cross-training seemed to be the key here. Some desks seemed 
to doubt this could be accomplished with current staffing levels. 
Cross-training is not an easy thing to accomplish and takes a "just do it" 
attitude. 

There doesn't have to be an across the board solution for Logistics. However 
all solutions we come up with will need to be formally documented so it will 
be easy to move to other alternatives as the business needs of each desk 
changes.

Late daily hours are a reality and at some desks tied directly to traders 
willingness to do deals at any time. As we get a better handle on what other 
companies are doing we might be able to find something that will help address 
this. Everyone is realistic about the exceptions such as bid-week etc. and 
really have no problems with those times when a long day is part of the job.

There were mixed reactions to a dedicated weekend team as opposed to some 
type of rotating group. Mixed feelings about whether the group would be open 
to a mandatory rotating weekend schedule. 


Feel free to get back to me if you have any comments or clarification. I'm 
looking forward to our next meeting - Bob

Jay,

If a deal is killed it poses a problem for us in Unify if there are any paths associated with the deal; therefore, we request the deals be zeroed out.  Call me if this is a problem.  Also, we would appreciate further details on why these deals are being killed.  

In addition, I have copied Rita and Mark from Volume Management for their input.

Regards,

Tammy

Richars/Tammy:


We will be killing about 2000 deals in Sitara tonight. Whenever a deal is touched in Sitara, it will bridge over to Unify. THese are Desk2Desk deals, and should have minimal impact on you.

I zeroed the path on deal 284599, and left 4,500 pathed on 339604 at meter 
4132, and pathed 5,000 for both deals 341801 & 341808 at meter 67 for 7/24 
only.  I also notified Betsy Boring/Southern about the situation and 
explained to her that any deal they make on EOL cannot be changed in any way, 
however we would move the gas for the 24th only because we ok'd the change 
before we realized it was an EOL deal.

I wanted to update you on those Phillips deals that the counterparty is 
saying are booked wrong.  I have left Gary L. a voice mail, but I have a 
feeling I won't be hearing from him.  So, we might not be getting an answer 
until next week on these deals.  The deals are; 131054 & 131048.

If I hear from Gary I'll let you know.  I'm hoping that they are ok.

Julie

Daren:

During the period of 1/1/2000 to 1/4/2000, the above meter has recorded flow 
on the following days with no deals attached:

 Days     Mmbtus

 1/1/00          3,737
 1/2/00          3,713
 1/3/00          3,730
 1/4/00             800
      
        11,980

Deal #120891 was at that meter during 12/99 production month, but it expired 
on 12/31/99.  Currently, these volumes are being booked under the HPL 
Strangers Gas Contract.  Logistics needs either (1)  have Deal #120891 
extended, (2) new deal, or (3) approval to writeoff these volumes to 
Unaccounted for Gas.  (Please print, sign, and return original to Clem 
Cernosek).

Daren - can you set up a delivery deal for meter 8740 for Jan 00 and Dec. 
99?   I checked OSS and there is an 089 operational contract that took the 
swing in case the meter flows more or less than the nom.   Third party 
contracts are supposed to stay whole.  Days 12-14 did not flow enough to 
cover the noms for Western.  We have the same problem on Jan. 25.  Please let 
me know, Brenda Herod would like this resolved today, as would I.

Stacy- Can you please set up a new deal for meter 8740 for Dec. 99.  The 
problem with this meter is,  all third party transports should stay whole and 
HPL takes the swing.  Several days the meter did not flow enough and the 
third parties did not receive all of their gas.  I need a delivery set up so 
the 3rd parties will stay whole.  If you have any questions, please let me 
know.

Thanks.

Aimee,

 We are still having problem with this meter.  From what I understand of our 
conversation a week or two ago, HPL needs to take the swing to keep the other 
contracts whole.  In the case where we have excess flow the HPL (R) contract 
takes the swing.  So in the case where we are short, shouldn't we have a HPL 
(D) contract to take the swing?  Please let me know if this will work.  I 
need to get back with Settlement today.  Thanks

Thu

Subject: Tejas Deliveries at Oasis Katy

On Tuesday, March 7th, Tejas took gas from us at Oasis Katy and gave it back 
to us at Tejas Laporte to help us out during an outage for $.02/mmbtu.  This 
transaction has not been scheduled correctly.  There are two deal tickets in 
Sitara to cover the Oasis portion of the deal:  #213145 covers ENA selling 
the gas to HPLC for HPLC to transport on Tejas.  Deal #213370 covers the 
transport usage on Tejas from Oasis Katy to Laporte.  I have edited this 
ticket to add the $.02/mm charge.  There needs to be a Tejas expense contract 
at Laporte, #665, to cover the approx. 25,000mm received there on the 7th.  
These volumes are currently sitting on the Laporte OBA.

Jackie-  if you would work with Carlos he should be able to walk you through 
getting this scheduled correctly in all systems.

Thanks.

There are two fields of gas that I am having difficulty with in the Unify 
System.

1. Cage Ranch - Since there is no processing agreement that accomodates this 
gas on King Ranch, it is my understanding  HPL is selling the liquids and 
King Ranch is re-delivering to stratton.  It is also my understanding that 
there is a .05 cent fee
 to deliver this gas.  We need a method to accomodate the volume flow on HPL 
at meter 415 and 9643.  This gas 
 will not be reflected on Trans. Usage ticket #123395 and #95394 since it is 
not being nominated from a   processing agreement.  We either, need to input 
a point nom (on HPL or KRGP) at these meters to match the nom at meter  9610, 
or a deal for Purchase and Sale (if King Ranch is taking title to the gas) 
needs to be input into Sitara at these meters  with the  appropriate rate.  I 
have currently input a point nom on KRGP to accomodate this flow, so we can  
divert some of this gas to the current interstate sales that are being made.

2. Forest Oil -   There is a processing agreement that will accomodate flow 
from the meter (6396) into King Ranch.  It is my
 understanding that this agreement was originally setup until Texaco had 
their own processing agreement.  I need   confirmation that the gas from this 
meter should be nominated on contract # (96006681) and that this agreement 
should  have been reassigned to HPLC. (It is currently still under HPLR).  

 If this gas is not nominated on the above transport agreement, then once 
again we need to accomodate the flow volume  on the HPL pipe with either a 
point nom or a Sitara Deal at meters 415 and 9643.

Howard - the above meter indicates a daily swing with no one in Volume 
Management's initials in OSS.  I need some information for Daren before it 
can be determined if a deal should be set up to cover the 089 contract for 
11/97 forward.

I've done some research as follows:

1/95 shows delivery on transport contract #012-82269-02-002 (Southeastern 
Marketing Co. as counterparty)

1/96 thru 10/31/97 shows delivery on transport contract #012-27182-02-001 
(Esperanza Marketing Corp as counterparty).

11/97 thru 12/97 shows delivery on 089-41500-102

1/98 shows delivery on  089-41500-101

No other transactions at this meter since 1/98.

Some questions I need answered are - why was volume allocated to transport 
contracts through 10/31/97 and then started to be allocated to the 089 
contract later?  Are the transport contracts no longer valid to allocate to 
and is that the reason the 089 contract was used?   Or should the transport 
contract be allocated to instead of the 089 contract for 11/97 forward?  Each 
item indicates a delivered volume, so either a transport  or sale is taking 
place.  

All the information that is supplied on the UA4 report is need a contract for 
9,448 MMBTU.

Since the meter was assigned to someone else during this timeframe before it 
was assigned to me, it's difficult to know why the 089 contract was ever used 
for allocation and since there are no other records such as deal tickets in 
CPR or OSS.

Need help, Stella

Daren - I need your help in resolving this issue.  There wasn't any deal in 
OSS for the above reference meter, nor could I find anything in CPR.  The 
contract shows 089-41500-102 representing a sale in the amount of 9448.


Thanks, Stella

I have input and updated transport usage tickets for July.  I did not update 
one for the demand charge for PGEV/Maypearl delivery, so if there is one, you 
will have to set it up in the system.  If you have any questions, please let 
me know.   Also, pay close attention to the Oasis and PG&E tickets for this 
month.  I do not yet know what baseload rates you have agreed upon, so you 
will need to adjust them in the appropriate tickets.  If you would, please 
let me know, too, what baseload business and rates you have agreed upon for 
both these pipelines.  Thank you.

Daren,
I'm not sure if you are the person that can make this change for me.  If you 
are not, could you please let me know who I need to speak to.
For meter # 78033 and # 78032 for 3/00 production forward, this deal is set 
up under the wrong Sitara #, therefore the volumes are not pulling in Sitara.
  The sitara # that it is currently attached to is # 149421 which this deal 
was only for 1/00 production.  The new Sitara number that we should be using 
is
Sitara # 156387 ( for meter # 78033 ) and Sitara # 156383 ( for meter # 78032 
).  I have attached an example  to help see what I am talking about.
( this was for 2/00 production )
Could you please let me know when the change has been made or if there is 
something that I need to do.

Thanks, Stephanie ( 3-6004 )

Daren has copied the old ticket and reput the volumes on a new deal ticket, dating back to the first, which reflects the correct Texas desk entity.  All of the buys/sales currently transacted at Waha by the Texas desk are done by HPLC-HPLC.  Please check your deal tickets as any volumes for April will need to be repathed, nom'd, etc.

Thank you,

Mary

We should sit and discuss the processes involved in creating new, 
unprecedented Product Types in EOL, as I think it is important for you to 
understand the myriad of processes involved. To start with, Legal will 
absolutely need to be involved, as it sounds like a new GTC  is in order.

Please call either Sheri Thomas or I when you are ready to discuss the new 
Product.

Steve - 

One issue that immediately comes to mind is the 'General Terms and

Product Type and GTC. 

Are we presently trading this product OTC, or is this unprecedented?

mmbtu/day.  The nomination is for 24,000 mmbtu/day.  The C/P is Costilla

Daren - Meter 1603 for September has a nom of 260.000 thru 9/26.  The flow is 
328.817, a difference of 68.817.  Sitara does not show who the trader is for 
this meter.  The price is Houston Ship +.02.  Should the nom be increased?

ENA was invoiced by Coral Energy for two deals on Tejas for June 2001 that I do not see in the system.  The first deal was on 6/1 for 5,400 at $3.87.  The second deal was on 6/13 for 22,000 at $4.25.  Do you know anything about these deals?  I think we would show it on ExxonKaty, but I can't find anything in path manager on ExxonKaty or Tejas.

Then the question would be:  where did we miss our projection?  Once again, I 
think we should include Rita in the reconciliation effort.

There is a deal for February but for a different meter.  Deal 138095 for meter 6331.

Daren, did we purchase gas for meter 6884 for February?

Deal # 157288
Per our conversation yesterday afternoon, pls. separate the Centena term deal 
from the spot deal in Sitara for March 2000 production.  
Also, I need to have the price for the East Texas redelivery changed in 
Sitara from HS Index $-.085 to HS Index $-.0825.  This is per the contract 
the price for this redelivery point. 

Thanks

Ed has requested that we compile a list this morning of all parties/points which we owe gas to, in the event that we need to find a home for excess volumes today.  Please email me a list of any meters/contracts that you are aware of.  I am compiling an interim list based upon the RTU variance report for March, however, I don't want to rely on this list as you may be engaged in balancing at meters with variances.

Thank you,

Mary

Meter 985688 recorded flow from March 14th to the end of the month, averaging around 130 per day.  The above deal has a zero volume in it, creating an allocation exception at that point.  Bob is out and this is a gathering point, so do you have any objection with me inserting a deal volume of 130 per day for that time period?

Thanks.

Stephanie:

Meter 6757 is done, redraft your invoice for both months and let me know if 
this meter is still an issue.

Meter 5192.  I never heard back from Aimee on which Transport contract to 
attach the deal 269123 to so for the months in question the gas is still 
allocated to the Strangers Gas contract.  Aimee is out on vacation until 
mid-June so I put in a call to Daren Farmer to find out which Transport 
contract I should attach the deal 269123 to.

When I find out which transport contract to use I will set up the accounting 
arrangements and then get Robert Lloyd to put the contract in POPS and 
reallocate.

Please put the ENA 201 contract at this meter for April and May of 1999 with 
the Track ID 117848 and reallocate the meter for both months.  After this is 
done please let Stephanie and I know so that she can redraft her invoice the

where Daren is asking for the price, Stephanie may be able to help you with 
this because she has a copy of Duke's invoice.


Stephanie:
The Crow O'Conner meter is essentially fixed.  When Aimee reallocates you 
will have to wait until the next day to redraft your invoice.  When Aimee 
gets back with us please redraft the invoice the next day and let me know if 
this issue is resolved.

You know, I don't think Robert would get on the same page with me if his life

 Thanks Ken however, the term deal agreed to by Lyondell {via nomination} is 
only for 15.0.
 Lyondell also nominated a 5.0 base deal.

Sitara 147092 is tiered pricing. If you want, you can nom whatever volume is 
on the deal ticket and the economics will work out correctly. It will keep 
things in balance a bit better, but you can go either way. For Feb there is a 
base deal for 5000/day and a term deal for 20,000/day. Only 15,000 of the 
20000 is pathed.

Hey Daren,

We're back on this issue again.  There is gas out there for days 1-3 and 6-20 
but the deal is only good for 21-31. 

Can you assist Anita and I w/a deal number to place the 1st 20 days on.  
Anita is attempting to close this issue.

As usual, thanks for your help.

Daren,

The above mentioned meter is on stranger's for the entire month of Jan. 
2000.  There is a deal ticket applicable to this meter from Jan. 21st thru 
the 31st.  Is it o.k. for Volume Management to apply volumes from the 21st 
thru the 31st to the 215?

I don't know what kind of issues was associated with this deal.

Thanks

Jackie,
I see that the gas at this meter is allocated to "stranger's" in POPS.   
Stephanie Gomes in Settlement thinks that this could be Encina's gas.  I see 
in Sitara that deal 152638 is only valid from the 21st - 31st.   Can you 
please take a look.

Hey Anita,
For meter # 0986725, 1/00 production, I am showing per meter statement that 
41,671mmbtu flowed.  Is that gas really Encina's.  Has the volume just not 
been allocated yet.  Could you let me know  what the deal is on the meter.

the 28th.  09/29/00 & 09/30/00 should have no noms.

Daren,

Can you please see if you can roll deal 156657 for day 1 for April?

This deal expired 3/2000.  There was no new deal # referenced nor was the 
evergreen flag applied.

This meter flowed 556 MMBTU's on April 1, 2000.

Thanks

Kellie-

I researched the statements you sent me and found deal ticket #109925 in 
Sitara which shows HPLC transporting on Midcon from Live Oak to Hardy Street 
for $.04/mm for the months of August and September.

The statement for November covers gas moving from Katy tailgate to Cogen 
Lyondell and is covered by Sitara deal ticket #133257.  The deal ticket shows 
a zero rate, however.  Elsa/Daren- do either of you remember this deal?  It 
was on November 30th for 5000mm.  Kellie- what is Midcon charging for this 
haul?

Thanks.

Daren,

I am inquiring about the status of this contract.  This contract was 
forwarded to you on April 10, 2000 for review and initial.  I need to know if 
you still have possession of this contract or who has possession of this 
contract.


I need to have this contract routed for signatures and returned to the 
counterparty.


Thank you.

I have re-checked Sitara & verified that the above deal was a Term, Firm 
deal.  This resulted in a GTC Purchase Firm contract being set-up in the 
Global Contracts System.  The term of the GTC was set as the term of the deal 
(4/1/00 thru 3/31/01) with no evergreen, meaning that the contract will 
expire at the end of this month.

To the best of my knowledge, all GTC Purchase Firms have the same language & 
they do not have evergreen.  They expire at the end of the primary term.

So, unless Exxon negotiated a deal with different, special language to allow 
for evergreen & included something about a "10 day notification" to 
terminate, there isn't any reason to "terminate" this contract.

If this is the case, please advise.  Otherwise, I don't think we need to do 
anything.  The contract will expire at the end of this month on its own.

Please prepare and send a termination letter by tomorrow March 16, 2001 on 
the above referenced deal.  Houston Pipe Line Company has not renegotiated a 
price and have no interest in buying the gas on an evergreen basis.  It is my 
understanding that we need to notify them within 10 days of the end of the 
delivery period

This particular meter looks okay today, so should not be impacting UA4.  Will 
keep you posted if I find any other problems.

90,000 MMBtu's for a grand total of 550,000 MMBtu's for the month. I don't

FYI....

This change went in for the Deal Validation group.   It gives them the 
ability to change counterparties names after bridge back.

Impact to Logistics - Unify
If a counterparty name change takes place to deals that have been bridge 
backed, it could cause problems on EDI pipes as that new counterparty name 
will flow over to Unify and repathing should eventually take place.
One problem may be with the Imbalance data sets, which are not in production 
yet......(EDI Imbalance Qtys would not match up to paths)
This may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities (especially where 
nominations were sent for entire month)
can't remember the rules on this one, but I think Unify does have some safe 
guards (idiot proofs) to force re-pathing.
Unify does have the ability to over-ride duns numbers, yet would still cause 
an additional step for EDI the scheduler would need to think through in order 
to get a clean quick response.
What are (if any) impacts to Vol Mgt if counterparty name changes take 
place?  (prior periods?  re-pathing?)

I have a call into Diane and Dave both.  After speaking w/ them, hopefully I 
can get a clear understanding of the true impact.  I am sure we'll need to 
put some processes and procedures together for Deal Validation to follow when 
these type of changes are needed.

Will keep you posted.

Thanks,

dg

Subject: Sitara Release (Re: Changes in Global due to Consent to Assignment)


Regarding the ability to change counterparties on deals in SITARA with 
confirmed volumes - Tom's words of caution:

If someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty - we created the 
ability for you to invalidate the deal - and 
then change the counterparty - however - I did add a warning message:

"Warning - changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes - make sure 
pipeline allows this change."   

Some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is 
feedback - I assume for the same reasons
we had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems 
(pre-UNIFY).  Some pipelines will require a new 
deal and we will have to zero out the old deal.

Before you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just 
in case it causes problems with their
pipeline.   Sorry - I don't know which pipes these are - you will have to ask 
the UNIFY team.

There is one rule still in place - you can change from ENA-IM East to ENA-IM 
Market East - but not from 
ENA-IM Texas to HPLC-IM HPLC - when changing business units - they must be 
the same legal entity. 
"Warning - not the same legal entity"

Also - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to Service deals 
(Transport Capacity, Storage, Cash Out).
Once the deal is invalidated - there are no rules.  Don't forget - the items 
were locked down for a reason.
 If you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down 
data that was validated - and someone used these
deals in UNIFY - it is highly likely that the UNIFY deals and paths created 
using these deals will get corrupted.  Always check 
with someone from UNIFY to make sure no one used these deals for anything in 
UNIFY.

Subject: Sitara Release (Re: Changes in Global due to Consent to Assignment)  

With the release that was put out Tuesday evening, Deal Validation should be 
able to change the counterparty on deals where the volume is something other 
than expected (e.g. confirmed, nominated, scheduled, etc.).  

In addition, this release will also capture "near-time" the contract changes 
that are made in global.  This means that need for server bounces will not be 
necessary.

 New/Changes to contracts will show up without having to get out of deal 
manager.
 New Counterparties, and new/changes to facilities will require getting out 
of all active Sitara apps (except for launch pad).  
  Once out of all apps, start a new app - the respective information that you 
are looking for will appear.

I mention "near-time" because we are constrained by the amount of time it 
takes for the change in Global data to trigger an alert for Sitara who then 
updates its information

The contract attached to that deal was a GTC Firm which ended 9/30/00.  I 
created a new ticket for those two days (461059).

Daren,

I have some flow at the above referenced meter without a deal.  Flow was for 
the first 2 days only, and probably occured as the meter was in the process 
of being shut in.  We purchased the gas from Torch-Rally Partnership in 
Sept.  Can you extend the deal, or should I allocated off to strangers?

Please advise.

Mary

Please read Brian's memo below.  We spoke briefly about this yesterday in the 
staff meeting.  I have copied each of you on a memo earlier today where I 
have provide the 2000 Plan allocations.  Please note that we were not making 
changes to the Plan, only breaking the Gas Asset group into smaller buckets.  
Any chnages which have been made since the budget was approved are NOT 
reflected on the allocation sheet.  Rather they ARE reflected on the 1/00 
allocations, and they will require explanations each month as all variances 
from Plan do.  This includes new RC's which have set up, etc.

I need each of you to review the 2000 Plan allocations as I submitted them 
earlier today, and provide an accurate allocation of your RC for 1/00.  What 
has your group spent their time on in 1/00???  Please be aware that we could 
receive questions from the Commercial teams, so document your logic.  Some 
things to consider:

Project Sally - allocate to Gas Network Development
Project Hurricane - allocate to ???? - (I have a call into Jim Coffey)
Denver Business - allocate to Rocky Mountain Asset Originations

If you have some other activities and your not sure where to allocate them, 
either call me, Jackie Nelson or Jim Coffey.

One other thing to note:  The Network Trading group will be further broken 
down into 2 groups:  Trading (Tom Martin and Jim Schwieger) and 
Transportation (Ed Gottlob).  Although the attached worksheet does not 
include this breakdown, please include it in yours.

I would like you allocations back to me no later than Thursday, 1/20 @ 
3:00pm.  Thanks.

Subject: 2000 Plan Allocations and January Allocations

The attached  files contain the Allocation Percentages for 2000 plan, January 
2000 Actuals and a description of the new Assets Teams.  

Please update the 2000 plan file to reflect the following changes to the 
Assets Team.  The Assets Team is now broken out into the following "groups" 
which are described in the attached Word Document:

RC#  Team Name    RC Owner



The 2000 plan file now has columns for the above teams, please take the 
percentage that was previously allocatated to Assets (which is in the 
Executive column) and reallocate it among all of the teams except Rocky 
Mountain Asset Originations that you support.  I have already inserted the 
new percentages to be used for Rocky Mountain, which are based on a portion 
of the Upstream Origination Allocation that was determined by the Assets 
group.  Consequently I have changed the allocation percentage for Upstream 
Origination.  I have also protected all of the cells except the ones you need 
to change to avoid confusion.

I also need you to update the percentages to be used for January 2000 
actuals.  I have added the new RC's that we have set up since plan has been 
complete, so please make sure you have each RC 100% allocated.

I will need the updated plan percentages returned to me by noon Wednesday 
January 19th, and the updated January 2000 percentages returned to me by end 
of day Friday January 21st.  

Thanks for your help in getting these updated.
Brian

Gloria, the difference between the two pipes for July 2000 is the actuals came in lower than what was nominated and scheduled on MOPS.  There isn't anything we can do about that difference, hopefully there is some kind of OBA that takes those variances.

Clarissa - Thanks so much for all your help with this pipe!  Everything looks great.  I just have a couple of paths
that I need to finish it:

January 2000 - I need deal #854688 pathed for EPGT and for TETC.  According to the invoice, we should have
                      11,129 dth on the interconnect.

February 2000 - I need deal #871184 pathed for HPL and CHAN.  HPL should have 3,600 dth and CHAN should
                       have 11,500 dth on the interconnect.

July 2000 - Deal #871172 has an interconnect issue.  According to MOPS contract #105124, they received 8,275 dth
                 on the Matagorda 624, but according to EPGT, they delivered 10,362 dth to HPL (?)  Could this possibly
                 need to be split somehow, or do you have any other ideas?

Let me know.  Thanks, Gloria 3-7118

Daren,

I have 2 allocation exceptions that require a deal to be extended.  Meter 
98-1488 Tenaska is showing small volumes flowed on days there was no deal.  
Can you extend the deal throughout the month so that the volumes will have a 
deal to link to.    I have the same situation on meter 98-1601.

If you have any questions, please let  me know.

Thanks,

Susan

Daren - Can you set up a deal for meter 7266? An accounting arrangement is 
always created every month.  It is used for the Texas General Land storage 
deal, (withholding 15% on their injections only).  It has been nominated in

Heidi-  There should be a deal ticket in Sitara for this sale to Engage, but 
it looks as though 12/99 was the last month a deal was entered 
(IF/HSC+1.00).  George/Craig- could you guys coordinate who should be rolling 
this deal or let us know if this gas should not be flowing?  Heidi-  
historically we've been charging $.60/mm for this transport.

I am finding flow out there on HPL 215 for meter 1520 (Tx City Coastal

Daren,
Deal 351653 is set up for 20,000mmbtu purchase from Duke at meter 981040 on 
HPL, but the actuals on CENT show a volume of 19,606 mmbtu at meter 77455 on 
8/2/00  with no deal set up.  Should this sale to Mobil have taken place on 
CENT  instead of HPL?

The contract (96007529) should have expired under ENA, but because of the timing of the expiration, it got "assigned" to AEP/HPL (96060798).  Therefore, for informational/historical purposes, I extended the term under 96060798 thru 5/31/01.

Someone from Linda's group will have to extend the term under the original contract in order for the deal to be attached.

I did a search and found no deals for May for this counterparty.  Call
Daren Farmer at 713-853-6905, and he could probably put the deal in for
you.

Julie -
Need your help again....
D&H gas Company, faxed their 05/01 volume support for HPL Meter 428
(980428), whihc reflects ENA gas sales to D&H for 5/11/01, 143 mmbtu and
5/31/01 for 286 mmbtu for a total of 429 mmbtu for 05/01. he deal last
month (04/01), was SA-70120. I don't have see a  sales draft  under ENA or
HPL for 05/01 sales to D&H, nor do I see any 05/01 sales deal under
SA-70120.

Can you assist me in finding out if there was a sale to D&H in 05/01, and
if so, what is the deal number and where is sales draft?

Thanks!
Tess

Tom did some footwork and questioning and determined where the additional Big Cowboy production is coming from.  Apparently, HPL cut a deal to purchase this gas at "HPL meters" at Rocher and Big Cowboy #2, so the gas had been pathed on the gathering agreement into our pipe.  All along, these volumes have been flowing into the GEPL/Big Cowboy system and on to King Ranch.  Tom and I spoke with Clem about the most correct way to reflect the physical and determined that a Transport Usage ticket needed to be put into place, as IM Wellhead, to transfer the volumes from HPL to GEPL and into the plant.  

We unpathed the gathering agreement and brokered the HPL purchase to the TU tickets and moved the gas on our transport on GEPL to the plant, effective April 1.  This resolves our overproduction issues for April and forward.

Please let me know if you have any further questions, comments, or information to add.

Clem,

The total volume of 1,517 mmbtu that flowed during the period of 12/1/99 
through 3/31/00 has been moved from the Strangers Gas Contract to 
012-41500-02-004 for write-off purposes.

Daren:

During the period of 12/1/99 through 3/31/00 gas flowed into HPL's pipeline 
at the above meter.  The gas volumes that flowed are as follows:

12/1/99 - 12/31/99                   1,457  Mmbtus
01/1/00 - 01/31/00                         49  Mmbtus
02/1/00 - 02/29/00               7  Mmbtus
03/1/00 - 03/31/00               4  Mmbtus

         1,517  Mmbtus

Prior to 12/1/99, the volumes were being purchased from High Sierra Operating 
LLC under contract #96003435  Deal #26611 which have terminated.  Currently, 
Logistics has these volumes recorded to HPL Stranger Gas Contract.  In order 
to correct this, HPL Logistics needs either a new deal to record these 
volumes which have flowed into HPL's pipeline, or Logistics needs approval to 
write-off these volumes to Unaccounted for Gas Loss.  (Please print, sign, 
and return the original to Clem Cernosek).

Just to update you on this project's status:

Based on a new report that Scott Mills ran for me from Sitara, I have come up 
with the following counterparties as the ones to which ENA is selling gas off 
of HPL's pipe.

Altrade Transaction, L.L.C.   Gulf Gas Utilities Company
Brazoria, City of     Panther Pipeline, Inc.
Central Illinois Light Company   Praxair, Inc.
Central Power and Light Company  Reliant Energy - Entex
CES - Equistar Chemicals, LP   Reliant Energy - HL&P
Corpus Christi  Gas Marketing, LP  Southern Union Company
D & H Gas Company, Inc.   Texas Utilities Fuel Company
Duke Energy Field Services, Inc.  TXU Gas Distribution
Entex Gas Marketing Company   Union Carbide Corporation
Equistar Chemicals, LP    Unit Gas Transmission Company Inc.


Since I'm not sure exactly what gets entered into Sitara, Pat Clynes 
suggested that I check with Daren Farmer to make sure that I'm not missing 
something (which I did below).  While I am waiting for a response from him 
and/or Mary Smith, I will begin gathering the contractual volumes under the 
above contracts.

Subject: ENA Sales on HPL

I am working on a project for Brenda Herod & was wondering if one of you 
could tell me if I'm on the right track & if this will get everything for 
which she is looking.

She is trying to draft a long-term transport/storage agreement between ENA & 
HPLC which will allow ENA to move the gas to their markets.  In order to 
accomplish this, she needs to know all of the Sales to customers that ENA is 
doing off of HPL's pipe.

I had Scott Mills run a report from Sitara showing all ENA Buy/Sell Activity 
on HPL since 7/99.  If I eliminate the Buys & the desk-to-desk deals, will 
this give me everything that I need?

Are there buy/sell deals done with ENA on HPL's pipe that wouldn't show up in 
Sitara?  Someone mentioned something about deals where HPL transports the gas 
on it's own behalf then ENA sells it to a customer at that same spot  --  
?????  Do deals like that happen? Would they show up in Sitara?

Is there anything else that I'm missing?  I'm not real familiar with how some 
of these deals happen nowadays so am very receptive to any 
ideas/suggestions/help that you can offer !!!

Thanks in advance.

In looking at  the MTD prod. vs. nom numbers, we have consistently been under nominated by about 2,000/day at Three Rivers and 2,000/day at the Saxet well.  We are making our imbalance worse, cumulative.  We need to update our forward position and our nomination by 4,000/day to stay in balance to entitlements.

Subject: HPL Optimization

Team,

As I mentioned in our HPL staff meeting we are investigating the merits of 
entering into a joint venture or another transaction structure that will 
position HPL to effectively compete in the Texas intrastate market.  Our 
primary objective is to gain access to additional sources of gas supply and 
achieve the required economies of scale to compete with other intrastate 
pipelines. I would appreciate your confidence and support in developing the 
optimal course of action for HPL and for Enron. 

The skills that we have developed in our group are critical to growing our 
Upstream Origination business in N. America, as well as to the ongoing 
operation of HPL.  Our origination strategy is to leverage our business 
operations, field operations, engineering, producer services, and marketing 
skills to capture value from transportation, gathering, storage and commodity 
opportunities on the gas/power grids.   We need our current employees to 
accomplish this objective across N. America.

We have proven our ability to add value to Enron by developing the 
Powder/Wind River pipelines, installing electric compressors, contracting for 
processing capacity, and establishing a new gas supply corridor along the 
Gulf Coast.  Our recent efforts to provide services such as business 
operations, measurement, trading/marketing, and accounting services to third 
party producers and pipelines also looks to be a promising growth opportunity.

It is very important to our ongoing business relationships and our 
competitive position in the market place that we DO NOT discuss HPL related 
matters with third parties.  Please come see me if you have any specific 
questions or concerns.  Also please refer any third party inquiries regarding 
HPL to Tim Determing.

Regards,
Brian

Aimee:

The volumes that we determined to be written off at this meter need to go 
into MOPS.  Please get a copy of a formal letter that Clem has prepared for 
other write-off's and send to Daren Farmer for approval .  Get Daren to put 
the proper deal tickets in MOPS and then let me know how to path this gas.  I 
will then set up accounting arrangements and get these volumes in the 
System.  the months in question are November and December of 1999, February 
2000, and June 2000.

Do you think that we can get this accomplished by October 31, 2000?  If not, 
please let me know a date when you think that we can get this resolved.

Thanks,

Fred

I received a call from the plant, apparently, they shorted us 60 Dth on the 
3rd of November.  However, someone opened the valve on the 20th and they 
flowed 69 Dth into the pipe without a nomination.  The plant is asking if we 
will phone Tennessee and accept allocation of this volume.  I realize that it 
is really not alot of net difference volumetrically, but, the market has been 
volatile and prices have risen significantly since the Nov. 3rd.  I also 
don't know what the market situation is like on TGPL, would we be creating an 
imbalance on a contract, is there a market to allocate to, are there any 
potential penalties?   I would like to resolve this today, if at all possible.

Please advise.

Please see the attached xcel file.  I think that I have found the missing volumes on Big Cowboy.  There are two wells connected to system 429, which flows into the Big Cowboy system and interconnects with HGPL at Meter 8284.  They are meters 986679 (currently in Trade Zone 18) and 986742 (Currently in Trade Zone 1).  I think that these should probably both be reassigned to Trade Zone 21.  This should resolve our volumetric issue.

Donna & George,

Please let me know if my assumption is in error.  I have a schematic that shows these meters going to HGPL off of GEPL Big Cowboy, however, if this is not correct then I will need to try to find the gas in another manner.

Thank you for your time.  Please let me know if you have any questions, comments, suggestions.

Mary

As you are aware, we are starting to collect data for our March price model. 
I've attached a survey to help us collect the data that will be driving your 
costs from the activities to the commercial teams.  In the 'Data' tab, please 
select the your RCs, and fill in the driver quantity for the requested driver 
for the month of February. Please fill out the attached activity driver 
survey with March numbers for your RC by end of day Wednesday, April 5th.  If 
your group currently generates a standard report that captures the surveyed 
data, please send the report to me, and put me on your recipient list 
beginning next month.  This will eliminate your need to fill out this survey 
every month.  If you would like us to collect this information from someone 
within your team beginning next month, please let me know.  

Please take this opportunity to verify the following:
1. The driver indicates a measure for the time and effort your team spent to 
perform these activities for each commercial team.
2. The activity is spent in support of the commercial teams identified 
(please let us know otherwise)
3. If the activity is using an allocation (for example "Allocate 0469" or 
"80-20 Split"), that the percentage allocated to each commercial team has not 
changed from last month.   (Please let us know if it has changed what the new 
allocation is).

In reference to these surveys, please note:
If you are allocating only infrastructure costs to some commercial teams 
listed in the survey, please identify them.  We will take your business 
support costs (such as feedback, training, etc.) and allocate them evenly 
among these teams.
The costs for "commercial team specific" activities that you filled time out 
for in the January time survey will be directly allocated to that commercial 
team (e.g. Genco Support will trace 100% of its costs to Genco).  

Please let us know if you have any questions on this survey.  

Regards,
Shari

Darren:
I have another HPLC issue...I received an invoice from Four Square Gas Company today for May 2001 gas that was never paid.  They have invoiced 1,654 at 4.825 (HSC - .085) at meter 986887.  I did not see a deal in Unify, so I went to POPS to find the meter.  I found that the gas was pathed to the Strangers Gas contract.  Historically, HPLC has always purchased the gas at this meter from Four Square, but it doesn't look like a deal was ever entered for May.  The April deal number was 695469.  Did HPLC purchase this gas in May?

   Mike:

  I am down to the last few error messages on the EPGT Quick Response and also looking into the external pool for WH034 in Unify.  About 70% of the line items have been cleaned up.

  I need the following information from you as soon as possible.  
  
 1.  The downstream contract number for Aquila Marketing and a "scheduled quantity report" for the Pooling contract WH034, this is the report you would obtain from the pipeline at the end of each cycle to determine cuts etc. or you can give me the user id and password 
  and I can go pull it myself.

  The EPGT's IT group is trying to research the correct DUNS # for Aquila Dallas Marketing.  If this issue is not resolved, I am planning on setting up a meeting with EL Paso on November 26th at 1:30 at their offices and I would like for you to go with me. We will meet with their IT and Business Group for about an hour or so.  
Your prompt attention to this will be greatly appreciated.






     Thank you.

Robert and I put our heads together and decided to enter the partnership 
agreement on the days in question to keep the third parties whole.  

Thu - it will be reallocated in about five minutes.  

If you have any questions, please let me know.

We do not have deal to enter for this.  You need to look at the entire Midtex 
line for each of the days that are out of balance.  If we are short at Katy, 
I would think that we would be long at Dewville.  (Many times, our receipts 
from the Midtex line at Katy are offset by our deliveries to Tufco at the 
Tap.)  This should help you fix the January problem.  Also, for December, you 
may need to ask PG&E where they show the delivery for Western.  Is it at HPL 
Katy, as our records show, or is it at PGE's another point on the Midtex 
line?  In any case, we don't have deliveries to make.  The only other remedy 
is to book the variance on the partnership imbalance.

Daren - can you set up a delivery deal for meter 8740 for Jan 00 and Dec. 
99?   I checked OSS and there is an 089 operational contract that took the 
swing in case the meter flows more or less than the nom.   Third party 
contracts are supposed to stay whole.  Days 12-14 did not flow enough to 
cover the noms for Western.  We have the same problem on Jan. 25.  Please let 
me know, Brenda Herod would like this resolved today, as would I.

Stacy- Can you please set up a new deal for meter 8740 for Dec. 99.  The 
problem with this meter is,  all third party transports should stay whole and 
HPL takes the swing.  Several days the meter did not flow enough and the 
third parties did not receive all of their gas.  I need a delivery set up so 
the 3rd parties will stay whole.  If you have any questions, please let me 
know.

Thanks.

Aimee,

 We are still having problem with this meter.  From what I understand of our 
conversation a week or two ago, HPL needs to take the swing to keep the other 
contracts whole.  In the case where we have excess flow the HPL (R) contract 
takes the swing.  So in the case where we are short, shouldn't we have a HPL 
(D) contract to take the swing?  Please let me know if this will work.  I 
need to get back with Settlement today.  Thanks

Last one, Shawnee Springs meter 986315.  Purchase should be from Torch on the 
215....  Was on deal ticket 138605, which expired in September, and has been 
allocated to up until Nov.   I think that Torch is now Cleco.  There should 
be a purch. at the meter.  Once we get the last two, you are done.

Daren, Sitara has two different prices for May 31,2001 causing a problem.
According to Lee Papayoti, the price for the swing volumes should
beHSC_FLW+1High.GDP.D.A.  However it is priced at HSC.GDP.D.A with the 31st
being priced at both.  This is causing Settlements to be overstated by
419MMBtu and $1,432.66.  Any help you could give would be greatly
appreciated. My phone # is 713-571-3273.

Jack

I tried to get into the Sitara ticket # 373590 to correct the swing pricing
....but I am not allowed to access it beacuse it is a deal from when we
were at Enron and I can't access those deals ....

Please ask Joanie or somebody as to what to try next, as I am at a loss!!

Please let me know if this is a vaild Demand Charge.

The deal is under a GTC contract and Daren indicated that he was not aware of 
this deal unless it has something to do with ENTEX. 
FYI the volume flow at this meter ( #981598) for Dec 2000 was zero.

Please advise-  Katherine

Fred,

I spoke w/Karry this morning on this issue and it appears as if this gas will 
be purchased by HPLC as wellhead.

I'm waiting for Karry to phone me back, after he's spoken w/Legal, before I 
give you a concrete answer.

Meter 5688 is incorrectly scheduled to the HPL Liquids contract 
012-41970-02-002 in March 2000.  Also last month when you were out, Robert 
removed the volume from the Liquids contract at this meter and temporarily 
put it on a Strangers Gas contract.  If you could fix both months today and 
let me know when it is corrected  I would appreciate it.

I am new at the 3 Rivers allocation so bear with me, I took this over from

Meters 5688 and 5801 are not scheduled on the HPL Liquids contract

volume at these two meters so if you could fix this by early tomorrow morning 
I would appreciate it.

this meter (400289) did not start until 9/15.  Could one of you extend the

I guess he won't be by as he knows it all now. And if he doesn't it will be 
my fault for not teaching him correctly. 

Supplemental to our conversation yesterday; I would come back to help you 
with a project or job for which you needed any of my talents. If it involves 
working with this guy ---- FORGET IT.

P.S. I have not taught him well as things are still being done incorrectly.

Brian-  This relates to an imbalance due Enron pre-June 2001.  AEP/HPL is negotiating on Enron's behalf to clear these historical imbalances.  Lobo wants to pay this gas back on Wednesday.  You guys can take this in and transport it on HPL to a market (for a fee, of course) or you can outright sell it to HPL after taking receipt at King Ranch.  It is up to you.  I realize that Wednesday may be short notice.  I was not a party to determining the date of this resolution and have no problem getting these guys to hold off, if need be.  Just let me know how you want to proceed.  I'm at 832-668-1181.  Thanks.

Rhonda, I took a look at the Missing Service Rates report and I don't have 
the rates to input into the system.  The best I can do is input them if you 
provide them to me.  I am sorry that I can't help more...call me if you need 
to at x1836.

Greg sent me the expense reconciliation reports that have come out were:

Powder River Gathering - Expense
Powder River Gathering - Revenue
East Texas Gathering - Expense
King Ranch Gas Processing - Expense
Humble Gas Pipeline - Expense
Channel Industries - Expense
TGPL - Expense
Black Marlin - Expense

I'm here till noon, and reachable after that at 713-385-7612.  I think that 
Charlotte or someone in the Logistics group can help with these rates.

It is my understanding the outages Valero incurred at the above locations are 
force majure situations during December and should not trigger the buyback 
feature of the contract.

Gary, I have not seen any documentation of this from Valero. Please follow up 
with your counterpart to secure the letter of notice or we will need to 
process the deal as if the buyback is active.

Thanks

Team,

On 15 November, Steve and Tom S. will represent HPL at a meeting of the Texas 
Energy Reliability Council hosted by Commissioner Michael Williams to discuss 
the outlook for gas supply and demand in Texas this winter.  I will dial in 
by phone once I am free from another meeting that morning.

Tom S.  can you find out more detail as to what we need to be ready to 
discuss and then coordinate with the appropriate HPL people to ensure we are 
prepared at the meeting.  Specifically, does James or anyone else need to 
attend or be on the call?

Thanks,
Brian

Nick,
I am not sure what happened to this volume.   I cannot tell by the audit 
trail, but there is a connection between meter HPL meter 987283,  and MIDT 
989807.   The volume you are referring to is on Mid-Tex Pipeline under meter 
989807.   It it pathed as a point to point nom with no deal reference.   I do 
not think this is correct because the deal you reference show HPLC as 
purchaser.   The volume is in MIPS under meter 989807, but  the supply deal 
is set up on HPL meter 987283, and the audit trail in Sitara shows the deal 
was moved from MIDT to HPL.   Get with Thu when she returns to see if she 
knows anything about this.

Hi Sherlyn,

Could you check to see why the volumes at this meter were zeroed out for the 
above months.  We paid Richardson back then and yesterday I noticed that we 
have a recoverable amount for the entire amounts paid for each month.  The 
sitara Deal #s are 127856 for Nov and 131729 for Dec.  Let me know if you 
additionall info from me.

Thanks,

Just wanted to keep everyone on point in terms of the importance and 
expectations of getting this King Ranch issue cleaned up for the prior months 
and correct on a go forward basis.  I spoke with Brenda on Friday to give her 
an update of our progress and one of the things that she stressed and wanted 
passed on to the team was the expectations that King Ranch would be clean 
(scheduled and allocated correctly)  for March and foward.  As of Thursday 
night's   P &L calc., unaccounted for March 2000 on Texas was a little over 
400,000 mmbtus.  As you all know, that number is way too high and should be a 
lot lower (on a bad month, no more than 100,000 mmbuts).  Hopefully, if King 
Ranch is the part of the problem for  March and we get these issues resolved, 
March will not be an issue.  I appreciate everyone's committment so far and 
hopefully we can apply this team concept in the future to prevent crisis 
modes like this from here on out.  If anyone has questions or concerns, 
please do not hesitate to let me know.  Thanks!

Subject: HPLR Liquids / Humble Gas Pipeline

We need to get together this afternoon at 2:00 PM in room 3745 to discuss how 
we will schedule and allocate the HPLR Liquids coming into Humble Gas 
Pipeline at meter 8793.  Karry, it is my understanding that you do not want 
an intercompany sale from HPLR Liquids to HPLC at this point.   How do you 
plan to get this gas to King Ranch since HPLR Liquids does not have a 
transport on Humble?

Daren, the intercompany HPLC purchase  is how it is set up currently in MOPS.

Robert, since Stella is out, we will need someone to represent Logistics.

I'll get with Brenda on February and Brian will be getting me March.  Ken 
Seaman should have be correct because I personally made him inactive on Feb 
15th (the final day of his last pay period . .. we couldn't do it his real 
last day because we had to allow that pay period to finish out so it would 
kick out a timesheet for him.)  The Specialist may actually be Ami because 
her title was incorrect for awhile (but we'll look at it to make sure).  

I'll keep you posted.

Starting with March, all Labor Distribution reports will come through me, and 
I will distribute them.  Brenda should have received all of the Labor Reports 
for the RC's that report to her for February.  I say "should have" because 
they were supposed to be sent out by someone  else.  I will try get you a

Hopefully in the future with me controlling the distribution, we will not 
have this problem.

Thanks again for your prompt attention to this matter, I appreciate it.  

There is a slight problem however, I couldn't find the deals for July and 
November 1999 in Path Manager.  I looked in Sitara and I see where you put 
the deal 269123 in for May 1999, but it is also in for July and November of 
2000.  Did you mean to put the deal in for July and November of 1999 and 
inadvertently put it in for July and November 2000?  If so would you put it 
in for July and November 1999 and send me an e-mail when you are done.  
Thanks,

Meter 5192.  I never heard back from Aimee on which Transport contract to 
attach the deal 269123 to so for the months in question the gas is still 
allocated to the Strangers Gas contract.  Aimee is out on vacation until 
mid-June so I put in a call to Daren Farmer to find out which Transport 
contract I should attach the deal 269123 to.

When I find out which transport contract to use I will set up the accounting 
arrangements and then get Robert Lloyd to put the contract in POPS and 
reallocate.

Subject: Teco Gas Processing; Meter No.: 6884

Each month at Seven Oaks, TECO (PG&E) makes an adjustment to the allocation 
to either pay HPLC for underages or charge HPLC for overtakes - ie. the 
difference between what our producers put in the plant and what we take from 
the plant after shrinkage.  This adjustment arrangement doesn't seem to be 
papered - it's just occurred each month for the past 5 years on a relatively 
routine basis.

Since the adjustment arrangement isn't papered, we've been having difficulty 
properly reflecting the deal in sitara and unify.  It has been suggested that 
we try to paper the deal for posterity (the lease to TECO has 9 more years to 
run), but, in view of the forthcoming expiration of the primary term of both 
the Comstock and Oryx (Sun and/or Kerr-McGee) contracts, I'm reluctant to 
open this can of worms.  I'd like your thoughts.

Greg, this relates to the Seven Oaks tailgate accounting issue we have been 
discussing.   HPLR once had an appropriate agreement in place, but that 
agreement has been assigned to ECT.  Until the agreement can be re-assigned 
from ECT to HPLC, we will use spot GTCs to clear the puchase/sale accounts 
for the period from 10/98 to 6/99 or perhaps 7/99.

Subject: Teco Gas Processing; Meter No.: 6884

Julie,

 In 1996, a contract was drawn up between HPLR and Teco Gas Processing, 
Contract Numbers 078-86978-101/078-86978-301.  In April '99, these contracts 
were assigned to ECT.  In October of 1998, these contracts should have been 
assigned to HPLC, but did not get assigned.  Beginning in Jan. '99, negative 
volumes started appearing in my purchase payment statements under Sitara 
#18372 (meter #6884), causing my payments to be reduced.  I believe that the 
deal number for the sale was being attached to the purchase contract.  (The 
purchase deal numbers which I have been using are Sitara #14086 and Sitara 
#11079).  Both these sales and purchases (since October '98) are suppose to 
be for HPLC.  Donald Reinhart stated that spot purchase and spot sale GTC's 
between Teco and HPLC can be set up from October of 1998 until the Master 
Contract is changed.  Amelia Alland has set these up, which I believe 
terminate in October '99.  The GTC spot contract numbers are as follows:

 Purchases:  012-86978-102; Global 96021450
 Sales: 012-86978-301; Global 96021451

 Per our conversation earlier can you make these retroactive adjustments?  
When complete, can you tell me what the new deal numbers will be?  

 Thank you so much for your help and let me know if you need additional 
information.

Gary,  Mainline valves to be closed on the 18" 3026 Line are as follows:   
U-5 at Crown Street  and U-6 at the end of the line where Ship Channel Loop 
3026 Line  ties into the Shell West 4792 Line.  

It is my understanding that the following customers within this outage 
section currently take gas:

Air Products  meter 1418
Albemarle  meter 1188

The current schedule would call for an outage to start on 4/13/00 and be back 
in service on 4/16/00.

Which mainline valves will be closed during the work and can you send me a 
list of the meters in the affected section?  I need to get with the Texas 
desk prior to their pre-bid meeting which is this Friday, March 24.

Based on the changes, it still appears to me the work is planned for the last 
week in April.  As a date becomes firm please let me know.

Thanks

The pipeline outage time mentioned in the memo below needs to be revised.   
Actual construction time should be 7 days and pipeline outage time should be 
3 days max.   This outage time, which is longer than the norm, is due to the 
fact that we will have to remove the existing line and replace it in the same 
ditch before tie ins take place.  

As an update, the first train is now scheduled to cross late today.  They now 
say that it may take 4 weeks to get all the trains in and out before we are 
able to begin replacing our line.




---------------
I have been advised by the Deer Park RR representative, Dean Truitt,  that 
the rail cars will begin arriving on 3/15/00.  

Per our conversations today, please have someone on Tuesday 3/13 adjust the 
regulators at Simpson and at Shell Deer Park so that 280 psig is the maximum 
pressure in that pipeline section.   

I will maintain contact with Deer Park on the duration of this project and 
keep you informed.  It is likely that the duration of the pressure reduction 
will be on the order of 2 weeks.  

After the initial 700 rail cars have entered and exited their facility, Deer 
Park will remove their railroad bed and allow us to perform a pipeline 
replacement  at that location.  This replacement would involve an outage on 
this segment of pipeline for approximately 7 days.  I would anticipate that 
this outage would occur in early April.

Thanks for your cooperation in this matter.

Danny

Subject: Bridgeline Workorder

I have some information on the e-workorders (EHURR and EHSET) that were set 
up to track the costs of Bridgeline.  Apparently the workorders themselves 
were not set up correctly so no costs could be coded to them in MSA.  We have 
corrected the workorder set-ups and they should be working now.  As for prior 
costs, I think we will be able to get a list of all the payroll costs that we 
attempted to code to EHURR and EHSET, and then book an entry in April that 
would reclass them to the workorders.  We would then be able to see all the 
costs associated with the project, as you wanted to do from the beginning,  
and code any future costs directly to the workorders.  I will let you know 
more when I finalize that this can really be done, I just wanted to keep you 
updated on the progress.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks,
Brian

Daren,

On the above mentioned dates, there was no nomination at the Enerfin meter.

6/3/99 and 6/8/99 revealed activity for ENA (202K).  Can the deal be extended 
for 6/4 (548 dec.) and 6/9 (40 dec.) to cover this flow so that Volume 
Management can create an accounting arrangement for these two days?

Thanks

Heidi, yes let's check the rates on the transport usage tickets.  Daren, is 
supportive of this decision.  Thanks, Mary

Subject: Re: transport flash for Feb 00  

The rates are in the system correctly in Unify (so that we can invoice 
correctly), but Daren's group uses a Sitara deal (the transport usage 
tickets) to estimate desk transport in the P&L during the month.  Right now 
we have not entered in or corrected rates in their transport usage tickets.  
Our group has not taken that step, since we have been most concerned with 
settling the G/L (after the month is over).  By not having the right rates on 
the transport usage tickets, the risk is that the P&L will be off during the 
month.  Would we change process and let Daren set up the transport usage 
ticket and then have us enter the rate?  If so, we would need to change the 
process with his group to put us in the process so that we can enter the 
correct rate.  Please let me know what you want to do.

FYI...the economics group publishes this report every month to show how much 
the marketing desk spent in transport.  They can get their expense numbers 
either from their estimate (from CPR) or from Unify, where we put the rates 
in.

One potential enhancement would be that in addition to managing rates for the 
transport capacity tickets, we set up the rates for the transport usage 
tickets.  I am going through the transport usage tickets for February right 
now (as part of the market meter study) and I see some rates I don't tie back 
to Lauri's matrix.  For example, Lauri's matrix shows 0.05 from Thompsonville 
to HSC, but the transport usage ticket (updated by Daren's group) has 0.055.  
This means the economic estimate can be off.  Let me know what you want to do 
with this.

Darren:
I'm not sure if you can help me with this, but I don't know who else to ask.  For April and May, we have gas pathed on deal 133304 to Conoco at the GEPL Big Cowboy point.  Conoco is saying that we did not buy that gas from them.  They have accounted for all of the HPL Big Cowboy gas and think we have over paid by about $1.5 mil each month for the GEPL gas.  Do you know why we added the GEPL meter to the deal in April?  Could we have bought this gas from someone else?  I have the meter statements from Tejas, but they do not say who the supply company was.

I received a call from Shannon last Wednesday (1/12), requesting what our 
needs might be for new analysts who will be starting in 2/00.  Shannon and I 
have talked specifics, but if you have an interest, please call Shannon ASAP 
@ x33853 to discuss the specifics.

It has been some time since we have put a new analyst into Logistics - Texas, 
but the other groups have taken new ones in the past.  I'm just asking you to 
think about it, and let me and Shannon know.  Thanks.


Shannon:  I do have an analyst rotating 6/1 from the Texas Risk team.  I 
might be interested in putting another one into the group, and it's not a bad 
idea to start now with training.  Can you let me know who you still need to 
place???  I would like to look at their resumes and talk with someone who 
interviewed them.  Thanks.

Peggy and Patricia,

This is the last allocation exception I have to clear.  When you have the 
time, could you check the volumes for gas days 28 - 31 for October, 1999.  I 
phoned Peggy this morning regarding this meter, and apparently it is outside 
measured.  I need to verify that flow occured so that I can have a deal(s) 
extended to allocate the flow to.

Thank you again for all of your assistance, I really appreciate all that you 
have done.

Mary

Daren,

I am going to leave a copy of the meter volume, and prior purchases to review.


Thank you for you assistance and patience.

Mary

I leave this with you. My take is that the situation is as I suspected and 
Pat wants me to pretty much leave them be. I will do that unless I hear a 
different plan from you.

Ken,
I think Robert has a good handle on things and can function on his own.  With 
that said, we always want different
checks and balances in place in order to capture the most accurate 
information, so if you see something that is
a problem please bring it to our attention.  Thanks,  Pat

FYI .... for Feb00 only, Equistar asked we deliver the gas under Sitara 
106736 to HPL meter 1373 instead (the plant it was originally going to is 
having some maintenance being done in Feb).

While I've already change the delivery point in the Sitara ticket, maybe 
something needs to bve done to the risk assignment .....

Do you think that we can get them fixed by Tuesday the 15th of this week?

Jackie, 

What does MOPS show for the days in question?  It would be incorrect to add 
any days to the Adonis ticket mentioned below.  It sounds as if the meter was 
allocated incorrectly in POPS and/or a deal was not pathed correctly in 
MOPS.  Let me know what you find in MOPS.

Here is the issue for 1/16/99 at meter 984132.   

20,000 mmbtu were confirmed for Adonis in POPS.   10,000 mmbtu on day 5 and 
day 16.   Day 16 is not valid for deal 51862 (track id 6155), which is where 
10,000 was confirmed.   The  actual sale to Adonis was 10,000 which was 
invoiced and paid by Adonis.  We are trying to clear the feedback error 
report.   My question is why was 10,000 confirmed on 1/16/99 if the date is 
not valid for the deal?

When Karen allocates the actual 10,000 it is prorating 5,000 for each day 
that is confirmed (the 5th and 16th).  

Should the whole 10,000 be allocated to the 5th or should 5,000 be allocated 
to each day?   If 5,000 should be allocated to each day, the 16th needs to be 
added to the deal.

Per our conversation yesterday afternoon, pls. separate the Centena term deal 
from the spot deal in Sitara for March 2000 production.  
Also, I need to have the price for the East Texas redelivery changed in 
Sitara from HS Index $-.085 to HS Index $-.0825.  This is per the contract

As a reminder, our PRC meeting will be held on Tuesday, 6/13 in EB37C1, 
beginning @ 12:00 Noon.  Lunch will be served, and Yvette has drinks and 
snacks throughout the day.  Our goal will be NOT to have dinner, but if 
necessary, we will.  I suggest each of you to make arrangements to stay as 
late as needed to ensure we reach a quality work product.

Our agenda:

Review of ground rules and responsibilities of the committee.

Each of you will provide a general business assessment of your team.  HR 
challenges should be identified along with needed skill sets, gap analysis 
and succession planning.  The template below should be used for the format.  
I am not interested in discussing the business goals, but you probably need 
to think through these in order to discuss the assessments that we will want 
to discuss as a group.

Review and discussion of exempt employees.  Each will be categorized into the 
six descriptors used in the feedback process.  I am expecting each of you to 
have a listing of accomplishments from your employees along with factual 
feedback and observations which will allow you to place your employees into 
appropriate categories.  I would like to stress that the data to sustantiate 
the performance descriptor should be factual and documented.  The focus of 
employee discussions must be on each employee's individual contribution 
towards accomplishing our business goals.  We must safeguard our discussions 
from "he said, she said" periferal distractors, and focus on the work product.

Promotion candidates discussion.

Once again, the PRC process is a valued process at Enron.  Each of you have 
been through it, so you understand the importance of confidentiality.  
Additionally, the Committee will be required to reach an unanimous vote.  
Please come to the meeting with your "Enron" hat on - not your individual 
group hat.  Our people are critical to our business.  Therefore, it is 
important for us to be honest when evaluating our staff.  We must identify 
our stengths and weaknesses, and work towards strengthening our people to 
ensure the very best business service we can provide.  What this means is 
that we should provide our employees with the very best constructive feedback 
possible.  In some cases, you may be providing a tough message, but it is our 
responsibility and obligation to ensure that each employee fully understands 
expectations, where they are on point and where they are NOT on point of 
meeting these expectations so that they can have the next six months to build 
needed skill sets and/or correct behaviors.  This is your obligation as their 
immediate supervisor.   If you have any questions, concerns or issues you 
would like to talk about prior to the meeting on Tuesday, please contact me 
or Hector.

In advance, I appreciate your time, energy and professionalism in this 
process.

The accomplishments by 6/19 is for Directors and above - to Sally.  
Individual groups under Sally will probably set their deadlines PRIOR to the 
smaller PRC's.    That is correct.
I did not understand that Promotions are to be discussed prior to the meeting 
with Sally  Our notes indicate that Sally wanted some prior discussions on 
this subject.   nor did I understand that the employee had to be in their 
role for 1 year.  Our notes indicate that this would be the general rule of 
thumb.  I thought the Promotion discussion would be an agenda item of PRC.  
We believe that discussion of promotions will also occur at the PRC.   
Additionally, I understood the Mid-Year promotion listing would not be as 
extensive as year-end, maintaining the year-end as the primary promotion 
time. We understood the same.

Daren,

I show that you extended the purchase, deal ticket 461059, to cover flow on 
the first two days.  However, now that measurement has closed, I show that we 
have flow on this meter for the entire month, with the exception of a few 
days in the middle.  Please let me know if we want to extend this deal (85% 
of hsc - lg, etc) or if I should put this gas on Strangers until we determine 
what to do.  I am now on the dreaded ua4 list from Vol. Mgmt.

Mary

This is an outside measured volume that we don't receive volumes on until 
month's end so systematically, no information equals zero. SPI, the software 
vendor for MIPS is investigating all of the rules currently in place for file 
transfers, particularly  0 volumes. The only possible solution is to tag all 
zero volumes sent in the nightly file process as (i) incomplete. I will let 
you know the outcome of this investigation and the monies required to 
complete. We may require a work order to complete based on the outcome of the 
investigation.

Subject: PG&E Texoma Volumes

Jeff/Gary,
 Where is measurement in the process of sending Pipeline Operations more 
complete data?  We continue to have this problem at various bidirectional 
meters and meter 980071 below is the latest casuality.  When MIPS sends 
Pipeline Operations a zero prelim, this becomes the best available number and 
overlays the estimate that Gas Control sends us.  When this happens & 
scheduling doesn't catch to override the zero, the desk's expense is 
understated. This is causing a huge mess for Texas Operations.  What is the 
plan to move this up on measurements priority list?  We need an answer ASAP!!

Charlotte, 
 At what other meters are we having this problem?

I spoke with Romeo D'Souza this morning regarding the on-going problem of 
MIPS feeding zeros to POPS when incomplete data is received.  

In light of the e-mail below regarding how important it is that we receive 
accurate data from MIPS ....  could you please update me on the status of 
this correction.  

Thank you so much.

Subject: PG&E Texoma Volumes

In reviewing some of the imbalance numbers, I discovered that Valero Texoma 
(#71) BAV volumes have not fed into POPS since 3/14 causing an out of balance 
at the meter in excess of 500,000mm month to date.  The more critical part of 
this problem, however, is that POPS has fed 0 volumes back to Sitara on some 
of the HPLC deals.  This means that these purchase volumes (expenses) have 
not been picked up in Tom's P&L and are, instead, sitting in UA4.  To the 
extent that the purchase prices vary from the UA4 value, the P&L may take a 
hit when these actual volumes flow through.

I realize that Kim is out and that you guys are stretched thin, however, a 
problem of this magnitude needs to be addressed as soon as it's discovered.  
Someone needs to be overriding the 0 volumes so that Sitara is receiving 
correct information and the P&L is kept as accurate as possible.

Please give me a call if you have any questions.

As you are aware, we broke a shaft in the MUG compressor on the methanol
unit at Clear Lake on Saturday March 11th.  We originally anticipated a two
week outage for repairs.  Unfortunately, due to delays in the delivery of a
coupling needed to finish repairs, we have extended the downtime for
another week.  We hope to be up April 2nd or 3rd if all goes well.

Stacey, I need your help in clearing PMA's for Oasis.  I have a lot of PMA's 
for 1999 related to rates missing or incorrect.  Would you help me by passing 
the information along to me?

Jan 1999
Mar 1999
Jun 1999
Aug 1999
Sep 1999

The Volume Management group (Rita Wynne's group) wants to have the rates 
cleared up by Wednesday next week, which means I will probably need to get 
something from you by Monday.  Sorry for the late notice.  Please call me at 
x 3-1836 if you have any questions.

Please let me know.  Thanks, Gloria

Clarissa - Thanks so much for all your help with this pipe!  Everything looks great.  I just have a couple of paths
that I need to finish it:

January 2000 - I need deal #854688 pathed for EPGT and for TETC.  According to the invoice, we should have
                      11,129 dth on the interconnect.

February 2000 - I need deal #871184 pathed for HPL and CHAN.  HPL should have 3,600 dth and CHAN should
                       have 11,500 dth on the interconnect.

July 2000 - Deal #871172 has an interconnect issue.  According to MOPS contract #105124, they received 8,275 dth
                 on the Matagorda 624, but according to EPGT, they delivered 10,362 dth to HPL (?)  Could this possibly
                 need to be split somehow, or do you have any other ideas?

Let me know.  Thanks, Gloria 3-7118

For those of you who have been trying to access the PEP System, this morning 
or today, stop trying.  There are still problems with the system and it is 
unlikely that you will be bale to get in or submit your reviewers 
successfully.

INSTEAD, please submit your list of reviewers to Brenda via e-mail.  She will 
make any changes necessary and forward them on to the PEP Helpdesk.  They 
will then be responsible for entering your reviewers manually.

If you have any questions, please call.

Thanx!

Subject: Performance Review - Mid-Year

It's that time of the year again - just earlier this year than last year!!!  
Please log into the PEP system, when it becomes available, and select at 
least five feedback reviewers.  The feedback is intended to reflect 
interraction throughout the organization.  For leads and managers and 
directors, please make sure you include at least one direct report.  The 
reviewers you select should be employees whom you have worked with frequently 
since 1/1/00 and whom can provide constructive feedback as to your 
performance.  Nothing prevents you from selecting more than 5 reviewers.  I 
will review them, and if I feel there are others whom should be added, I will 
do so.  ASSUMING the system becomes available soon, please complete your 
selection process by COB, Tuesday, 5/16/00.  I want to approve these ASAP, so 
we can get our request out early.  Turn around is critical.

The next thing I will need is a listing of your accomplishments for 2000.  I 
would like these by E-Mail by Monday, June 5, 10:00am.  Once again, the 
timeline is critical to the process, and is not negotiable.

Although we have reorganized the Risk group effective 5/1/00, I will still 
perform the performance reviews.  Mike, Steve will be responsible for your 
review. 

Let me know if you hav any questions or concerns.  Thanks for supporting the 
process and the timeline!

According to measurement, there is flow of 7,394 in 8/98, however, there is 
nothing to indicate this is gas that was received on HPL in OSS.   I checked 
MIPs and there is a measurement statement that supports the flow rate of 
7,394 MMBTu.  

Daren is there a deal in CPR which may not have fed over to OSS?  

Thanks, Stella

Step I.

Romeo:   Please do Step 1 today, 10/4/00.

1.  Please change the confirmed noms to zero for all contracts that have be 
nominated for period 1/1/00 thru 10/31/00 for the above meter.
2.  Change the allocation method to "Not Allocatable" effective 1/1/99.
3.  Please reallocate the meter for period 1/1/99 thru 10/31/00.
4.  Call me after the above tasks have been completed.

Step  II.

Sherlyn:  Please check the following tommorrow, 10/5/00.

1   Verify with Settlements that the zero BAV adjustment were received  for 
all Contract Activities at Meter 986892 for period 1/1/99 thru 9/30/00.
2.  After verification is complete, please call me.

Step III.

Donna:  I will call you tomorrow, 10/5/00 to inform when you can make the 
following changes:

1.  Change the meter # and DRN # at Facility # 501026.  This facility should 
be Trade and Nom "YES".
2.  Change the meter # and DRN # at Facility # 515136.  This facility should 
be Trade and Nom "No".
3.  After completion, please call me as well as Romeo (x-34544).

Step IV.

Romeo:   Upon receiving a call from Donna:

1.  Please make the appropriate changes or corrections in POPs System for the 
Facility Changes made by Global Facilities Dept.  My understanding is that 
these changes can not be done automatically.
2.  Upon completion, please call me.

Step V.

Jackie:

1.  Tomorrow, 10/05 /00, after I am informed that Romeo has made his changes, 
I will let you know and you may begin scheduling Meter #0980439 which is the 
meter replacing #0986892.
2.  After completion, please let me know.

********

Gary:

This could create some problems for Gas Control, because all confirmed 
volumes will be zeroed including October, 2000 activities at meter 986892  
today (10/4/00).   This should correct itself within 24 thru 48 hours at 
meter #980439.

Daren:

This could also create some issues for you, but remember, these issues should 
clear within 24 to 48 hours.

Victor:

This is just for your information, since this should not create and changes 
for you.



IF ANYONE HAS ANY QUESTIONS, PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CALL ME AT X-3665O.

THANKS, CLEM

 To path a buyback {MOP; Supply List}  with an existing Market Deal 
{typically baseload} please follow these steps:
  
 Theory # 1:   Example; Supply Deal = 5.0/d  & Market Deal = 5.0/d
 
  1.) Attach the Supply Deal with the Market Deal to establish a "buy/sell"  
path list contract  oppose to a transport contract.

  2.) Path the transaction on the "buy/sell" { or broker the deal}  contract.
 
  3.) This process is applicable only if the Supply Deal and the Market Deal 
are the same quantity.
 
  4.) This example will yield a net zero activity in POP.
  
 Theory # 2:  Example ;   Supply Deal = 7.0/d  &  Market Deal = 10.0/d
 
  1)  Follow  steps 1 & 2 in Theory # 1.
 
  2.) Additionally, create a service transportation contract {i.e. K-215}  in 
the path list.
 
  2.) Path 7.0 on the "buy/sell" path list contract and  10.0  on the 
transport {i.e. K-215} contract.
  
 This procedure will eliminate  an out-of-balance in MOP for both the "Supply 
Deal and the Market Deal"  and send 3.0  to POP via x-port K-215.
 
 Note:  Never path a buyback {Supply Deal}  using a receipt transport contact 
and the{ Market Deal}  using  a  delivery transport contract.
  
  POP's should only  reflect  the "net" on these two transactions {buyback 
and baseload deal}.

Anita,

 After speaking with Gary Lamphier, Big Thicket's allocation for 
Pecos'/Roberson's portion will be done differently.  Historically, their 
portion of the allocation was reduced for shrinkage.  Effective with October 
00's allocation, shrink will no longer be deducted.  The full amount of 
Pecos/Roberson's gas received at meter 6753 and delivered out at meter 8714 
(Vastar) will be kept whole.  I spoke with your contact Harold McGee at Big 
Thicket and he spoke with Pecos/Roberson regarding this and everyone is 
agreement.  Your allocation process will be done the same, however the 
Pecos/Roberson number on the allocation statement will no longer have 
shrinkage deducted.  I have gone over the numbers for October with Harold and 
he has stated the 23,174 is the amount that will be allocated to 
Pecos/Roberson, 946 will go to Jay, and 9114 will be for Enron (this portion 
has always been kept whole).  Can you please make sure that this is done.  If 
there are any questions, please let me know.  Thanks.

Fred or Anita,

 I just wanted to recap our discussion to be sure that we are all on the same 
page.  From my understanding, the allocation for meter 785: State Tract 121 
is supplied from Bryancy Braumley.  Prior to 09/1/00 Bryancy would calculate 
flow from certain wellheads, total this volume, and then send us an 
allocation that would show how much gas was allocated to Texas General Land 
and HPL (Sale from CLECO) at meter 785.  Effective 09/1/00 a compressor was 
put in and the gas from 785 now flows through this compressor, as well as the 
gas from meter 9662 (Deal 137595 Sales from Dewbre), and is now measured at 
meter 3527:Tivoli Station.  For Bryancy's allocation, she must take the meter 
statement from meter 3527 and deduct meter 9662's flow.  Once this is done, 
she can take that net number and do an allocation between Texas General Land 
and HPL (CLECO) like she has done previously.  I believe meter 785 is now a 
check meter and meter 3527 is the actual pay meter.

 For 9/00 there were two deals in place for the sale from CLECO, deal 397957 
and 449243.  Per discussions with Daren Farmer, Danny Conner, and Jennifer 
Martinez, I have been instructed to zero out the deal for 397957 and use 
449243 as the correct deal number.  Therefore, Fred Boas and I have zeroed 
out the 397957 deal and placed the volume that was allocated there to deal 
449243.  Deal 397957 was priced at ship less .18 which was incorrect and deal 
449243 is priced at ship less .15.  Therefore, an adjustment will generate 
for 9/00 for the difference in price and the change in location.  The 
allocated volume for CLECO did not change.  However, I am not sure that 
Bryancy is allocating the volume properly between Texas General Land and HPL 
(CLECO).  I have spoke to her, as well as Jennifer Martinez, and Curtis 
Funderbruk with CLECO so there might be some PMA's for volume differences.  
In addition, I have changed the allocation method at meter 3527 to be a 
callout\swing effect 9/00.  For October and succeeding months, the volume 
should be computed by taking meter 3527 deducting out meter 9662.  Then 
Byancy should take this net number and split it between Texas General Land 
and HPL (CLECO).  The Texas General Land nom is currently at meter 785 and 
the HPL (Cleco) deal is at meter 3527.  Fred mentioned that the Texas General 
Land nom might need to be moved to meter 3527 but nothing has been decided on 
that yet.  

 Please let me know if something I have stated is not your understanding or 
you need something more done on my end.  Also, let me know who is going to be 
doing this monthly allocation.  It might be beneficial to have one person 
doing all the points (meters 3527, 9662, 785).  Thanks for your help!!!

Daren--FYI

I changed the volume of the Tenaska IV deal 384258 to reflect the correct 
fuel amount, it was less fuel because some of the supply was from the katy 
area.....new sale total of 36,286 (after 8,406 removed for Brazos)

We will be killing about 2000 deals in Sitara tonight. Whenever a deal is touched in Sitara, it will bridge over to Unify. THese are Desk2Desk deals, and should have minimal impact on you.

Daren,

The above meter flowed on the 215K for 3/2000.  I has flow for the first two 
days of this month (Sitara deal #205569-deal ends 3/31/2000).

Can you please see if the deal can be extended or if the gas should be placed 
on stranger's?

Thanks

After talking to both Vance  Taylor and Julie Meyers, only 5 of the 13 deals 
are committed reserve deals.  If they are not committed reserve they're not 
in the IM wellhead portfolio.  The plan if everyone agrees, is to go ahead 
and move the 5 and re-path to them to the  gathering and leave the other 13 
on the 215 contract. Here is a list of the ones to move  and leave.

Thanks!

This meter has not been disconnected.  The measurement tech turned in a 
temporary disconnect to MIPs (about 2 months ago) because the meter has not 
flowed for approximately 4 months.  This allows the measurement tech to forgo 
testing the meter until it is ready to be put back in service.  Scheduled 
volumes should be taken to zero until further notice.

Thanks

Daren,

I show that you extended the purchase, deal ticket 461059, to cover flow on 
the first two days.  However, now that measurement has closed, I show that we 
have flow on this meter for the entire month, with the exception of a few 
days in the middle.  Please let me know if we want to extend this deal (85% 
of hsc - lg, etc) or if I should put this gas on Strangers until we determine 
what to do.  I am now on the dreaded ua4 list from Vol. Mgmt.

Mary

 Have you a chance to look into this?  We are required to clear intercompany

 I have an intercompany deal which I am missing one side of.  HPL purchased 
gas from Dynegy (deal 96378) and sold to ENA (deal97185) on Oasis Pipeline 
(meter 1335).   I can't find ENA's purchase from HPL.  Please let me know 
what  you find out.  This is affecting our intercompany report and we need to 
have it cleaned as soon as possible. Thanks

Subject: Houston Gas & Power Controls/Standards Assessment

As you all are aware, there is a heightened awareness throughout the company 
of the need for establishing global trading control standards and developing 
a process by which we will track and monitor on a regular basis our success 
at achieving those standards.  I have been asked by Sally to take the lead on 
meeting this objective.  For the last several weeks, I have been involved in 
an extensive review of the London office controls and procedures for their 
gas and power trading businesses.  We have used the findings of this review 
to start developing an assessment of controls, standards and measurement 
methodology for the London office.

In order to work towards our goal of developing global trading standards 
across Enron, we need to perform the same controls and standards assessment 
for the Houston gas and power businesses (we will assess global products and 
other commodities traded at a later date).  I will be in Houston Tuesday and 
Wednesday of next week to help facilitate this process.

I have scheduled a meeting next Weds., May 17 from 9:00 - 11:30 in EB49C1 so 
that we may review our controls, define the standards of meeting those 
control requirements and assess the risk associated with those controls not 
operating properly.  Before that meeting, I would like for all of you to 
develop for your  respective functional responsibilities the following:
 - a listing of all controls your group is responsible for (i.e. cash 
collections are timely)
 - a proposed standard that will ensure each control is being met to its 
maximum effectiveness (i.e. cash is collected within 30 days of deal date 
with            exceptions noted)
 - a quantitative measure to allow performance monitoring of each standard 
(i.e. % of cash collected within 30 days)
 - a description of current capabilities to calculate, track and report each 
measurement (i.e. automated A/R aging report)

I would urge you to be as detailed as possible in listing your control 
functions and to solicit feedback from your managers and leads.  A lot of 
work has already been done to identify this information so I would hope time 
requirements for this will not be extensive.  I have attached a worksheet to 
be completed with the information discussed above.  I have also attached a 
high level summary of proposed gas and power standards to use a guideline but 
it is certainly not all-inclusive and should be revised as necessary.

As discussed above, we will review the controls and standards listings for 
each functional group in the Weds. meeting and also assess the risk 
associated with each control.  I would like to achieve consensus on gas and 
power operating standards for Houston by the end of the meeting.  Let me know 
if you have any questions or comments regarding this process.  I look forward 
to seeing you next week.

Mary,

As in my email below to Daren, we are seeing some OA variances between flas=
h to actual on the PLE contracts on PGEV for 10/00-12/00.  I have verified =
with Thu Nguyen of what the statements from PGEV show and that is also what=
 we have booked in Unify and recorded to the G/L as an imbalance.  However,=
 when looking in CPR (under CPR Pipeline Exchange), there was not anything =
flashed for those months, thus our OA variance.  I seem to remember that St=
acy once said that although we may run an imbalance at the end of a month o=
n occassion, in those few times that we do, 1)it should be relatively small=
 and 2) in the following days of the next month, we should have worked the =
imbalance down to zero thus having no imbalance at the end of the month.  I=
n a voice mail from Daren today, he seemed to think the same thing was happ=
ening or even that by the end of each month, we were balanced to zero.  Can=
 you shed some light on these months and let me know if we should have had =
an imbalance and if we should have, why there would have not been anything =
flashed.  If we should not have had an imbalance, then we'll need your help=
 to figure out what went wrong in that PGEV shows an imbalance on their sta=
tements.  Let me know what you think.........


Thanks,

Daren,

When I look back in CPR for the delivery periods of 10/00 - 12/00 on CPR Pi=
peline Exchange, I do not see anything being flashed as an imbalance, i.e. =
the buys and sales always equal in CPR.  However, we are booking an imbalan=
ce every month on the parking and lending contract.  Should there be someth=
ing in CPR for these volumes?  Let me know because it is causing an OA vari=
ance for us.  Thanks!

Robert,
You can communicate by lotus notes, phone, memo or other means.  The point 
that I am making is to communicate
all and any industrial information to Daren, Gary Hanks, volume management, 
and myself.  There may be times to
also involve Lee and Gary as well as others.  This was just to assist you. 
Thanks,  Pat

Does it make a difference  if the information is communicated via a copy of 
customer "force majeure" letter or should it only be communicated
 via notes mail.  
 
There are several ways to communicate effectively issues that is beneficial 
to other departments, do you have a preference?

Deliveries to this meter were halted late in the day of January 20. The 
customer has maintenance issues that necessitated an earlier than planned 
turnaround.

It is my understanding from our trader this is another force majure situation 
resulting in no sale or buyback at this meter commencing with the shutdown.

Per Mary, Sitara can not handle it either.  It can calculate and withhold 
volume from the deal as a % for fuel, but not as part of the price.  Steve 
says this is a nightmare for the Denver office.  Can you take the "To Do" to 
follow-up on this throughout the systems, and get back with Ed to further 
discuss?  I'd really appreciate it.

Subject: Re: Fuel  

We need to discuss further.  My concern would be that how do we know what % 
HPL should be retaining at a compressor or zone to make sure we recoup our 
fuel cost ?  Also, could allocated fuel cause a contract imbalance?  I think 
that Pipeline Operations can handle the scheduling of third party fuel 
retainage.  But, if we retain fuel on ENA transports, then we need to come up 
with a plan to nominate this in Marketing Operations to Houston Pipeline.  
Currently, this process is not in place.

Brenda,

As you know fuel is a big risk.  One of the things we are trying to do is get 
the shipper to pay fuel.  This would mean we would purchase, transport and 
possibly sell gas with a fuel percentage as part of the price.  Can the 
downstream systems, scheduling etc handle this?

Daren,

I'm attempting to clean up my allocations, due to this being allocation close 
week for Volume Management.

98-1534 (delivery meter) overflowed into March, day 1 only,  for .30 
decatherms (Sitara Deal #163005 - Start date 2/1/2000  and stop daate 
2/29/2000).  The 215K is the only one at this meter for Feb. 2000 
production.  I don't see a new Sitara deal number being referenced nor do I 
see the evergreen flag applied here.  Please apprise if you can extend the 
ticket for this small amount for 3/1/2000 or if you want it handled 
differently.  

98-1052 (delivery meter), allocated flow for 2/21-2/24/2000 with no K 
applied.    Days 22 and 23 for February references the 215K (Sitara Deal 
#168884 start date 2/22/2000 stop date 2/23/2000.  Sitara deal #201636 has 
the same start and stop date as 168884 and neither references an evergreen 
flag or a new deal number).  

Thanks
-Jackie-

For Mar00, Siatar # 139055, you will need to make adjustments to the risk 
assignments etc., as I have made some changes to the booked deal.

For March 1 to 10, Enron Methanol will take zero volumes (they will be down 
for maintenance - a force majeure situation)

For March 11 to 31, they will take 33,000/d at a price of Gas Daily HSC mid 
flat.

Thanks

Lee

JM, 

The message below is related to deal #138094.  According to Joan, October is 
the last month for this deal.  However, the evergreen flag is activated in 
Sitara and a new line has been created for November.  Can you look into this 
please?

Daren you are correct in that this was only in MOPS for the 26th.  It was 
edi'd over to POPS from the 25th through the 31st populating all days with 
the 16,700 nom.  The nom was never -0- out in POPS therefore the change 
notification process in POPS did not pick up a change at this meter.  This 
meter is pathed by Kim and confirmed by me - it is extremely odd that this 
was missed in MOPS.  The record would have been out of balance and someone, 
if not several people, normally would make a comment on this.   Also  -  all 
of my records indicate that the 16,700 was good through the 31st except the 
MOPS entry.  My confirmations with Koch didn't reflect the -0- ;  the last 
report I have from Koch indicated the 16,700 stayed on, there was no record 
of a phone call indicating anything other than 16,700.  It is very odd for 
this many checks and balances to fail.  Also, the volumes were being sent 
back to MOPS which no one caught.   

I have spoken with Koch today and they agree that the 16,700 should have gone 
to -0- therefore I have removed the nom from POPS confirmed volumes and 
re-allocated the meter.  The OBA has taken the hit and I am working off the 
imbalance now.

Daren, I am sorry that you had to look into this when you feel this is my 
responsibility.  Stella was trying to help me out in clearing up errors 
because I was buried in current activity, thus the e-mail to you asking for 
your help.  

If this doesn't answer all the questions, just give me a call.

Thanks,

Charlotte

Subject: Re: Sale to Shoreline  

Stella and Charlotte, 

I looked into this deal.  We sold this gas for one day only.  In MOPS, the 
path was nominated for 1/26 only.  However, in POPS the path was nominated 
and confirmed for 1/26-1/31.  This should have been showing up as a 
bridgeback error during the month.  Also, someone should have identified that 
the path/nom in MOPS wasn't the same as the nom in POPS.  This discrepancy 
should have been found before we closed out January.

I researched this problem by reviewing both systems (looking at the path id 
in POPS, finding it in MOPS, and checking the audit on the path in MOPS).  
This type of issue should be researched and solved by the logistics group, 
who has all the necessary tools to find the problem.  The resolution, not the 
problem, should have been presented to myself or the marketer, with an 
explanation of what happened.  Some one still needs to find out how the gas 
was confirmed for the 27th-31st.

Since the gas apparently flowed, we will have to apply the overflow to the

Joanie,

Logistics is waiting to hear from Daren on this issue.  He will either need 
to extend the deal or maybe there should be another deal in place.   This 
deal 155118 is valid on 1/26/00 only, but the rest of the volume you are 
looking for is scheduled on days 1/27 - 1/31.    I am sure there is no 
pricing on those days.  

I will let you know as soon as I hear from them.

Hi Daren,

I know that this is a busy part of the day for you.  But, when you get a 
minute, can you please extend deal #465322 for cover a flow volume of 140 
dec. for 11/21/2000?

Thanks

 Daren,  EOG  is having problems with that same well 6296 but this time it's 
compressor problems.  They think that it will be for at least a week but you 
know how that goes.  They would like to drop the volume again to 4400.  If we 
change don't Kim will have an imbalance at this meter (she wanted me to let 
you know that).  Meter # 6598 YATES  would like to change the volume from 
4206 to 3366, and Vintage who had been over producing last month would like 
to increase from 270 to 320 to match the real flow.  I know these are 
bothersome changes but I'm trying to get the best numbers for both you and 
Vance for the up coming month.  Let me know and I'll be on the go  from the " 
THE TOM CAT"

Daren---

I need some help with meter 5892 for September 00 due to a feedback error.  
Deal 133196 (purchase from Duke on gathering contract) is erroring out due to 
it's expiration date of 8/31/00......however it still showed up in POPS (w/o 
a nom) on 9/1.  Volume management allocated volume to it according to the 
allocation statement.  Should this deal be extended?  I noticed it is not out 
there for October either.  I have the feedback error sheet & allocation if 
you want to see them.

Let me know,

Mark
x33396


p.s. Fred Boas said you used to handle this and you were very wise in the art 
of allocation......so I am expecting big results Grasshopper!

Robert,

I've taken care of 98-6719 (as far as getting it out of my allocation 
exception screen).  I'm going to place 98-9676 on Strangers Gas until you 
hear back from Daren or Julie.

Should Daren or Julie get back w/you, while I'm on vacation, please get back 
w/Anita Luong and provide her with the K # given to you (by Daren or Julie) 
as well as the dates of 2/1 - 2/29 (even though 3/1/2000 is reflected in my 
allocation exception screen) so that she can provide you with an accounting 
arrangement to place February's volumes on @ this meter.

It looks as though this meter is flowing starting 3/1/2000.  I guess that the 
trader will eventually place a deal in sitara for this meter.

Thanks

I've got a message into Julie Meyers to look into the contract at meter 9676, 
and will let you know what she determines.

Hi Daren,

Can you please check into whether or not the below deals for the above meters 
can be rolled and extended?  If so, can you please perform this for me so 
that Anita can set up an accounting arrangement for me?

98-6719  Sitara Deal #166989 Flow @ meter began on February 10th but the deal 
is not effective until  February the 11th.
     No new deal # referenced and no evergreen flag.  This is on the 
gathering (96026573) K which is the only
     K @ the meter.

98-9676  Sitara Deal #151669 Deal good from 1/1/00 - 1/31/00 but there is 
flow for all of February 2000 with no K.  This is on the 215K      for 1/2000 
production which is the only K @ the meter.


Thanks

These are my estimates. The volumes for April at T-ville and Colorado RS are

So, 5000 total is a safe assumption.

No one resolved this. It still needs to be done. You, Robert, and Volume 
management need to be involved for November. You and Robert can take care of 
Dec. If you need more input let me know.

Thanks

In November volume was applied to deal #92963 when, in fact, all volume 
should be on 125066. Please effect this change asap and insure December is 
set up for 125066. Deal #92963 should have been terminated at the end of 
October.

Sorry about leaving you off the "send list" . . . I inadvertently put Smith

This change is for the last two days of the month of March (I am sending a

Is this date really June of 1999?  Hopefully we're not just finding out about 
this?

I don't think we can even process this request.  The East Desk was not up and 
running on Unify in June of 1999.  All of our pathing for June of 1999 was in 
Autonoms and it's not y2K compatabile. With the volumes involved being so 
small and the accuracy of the data at Enerfin in question, why don't we let 
this volume hit the new OBA at Enerfin as a PPA???

I welcome your thoughts.
Victor

On the above mentioned dates, there was no nomination at the Enerfin meter.

6/3/99 and 6/8/99 revealed activity for ENA (202K).  Can the deal be extended 
for 6/4 (548 dec.) and 6/9 (40 dec.) to cover this flow so that Volume 
Management can create an accounting arrangement for these two days?

Subject: May Activity Survey

Attached please find the Activity Survey for the month of May, 2000.

I am sending the survey out this time as an opportunity to introduce myself 
to those of you I have not yet met.  I am being asked to take a direct roll 
in the further development and rollout of the Operations Pricing Model (fka 
Transaction Cost Model).  In the past, I have directed the implementation of 
several pricing systems based on activity based costing similar to the 
Operations Pricing Model (OPM).  Over the past couple of weeks my 
observations of the Model have lead me to be concerned with the quality of 
data used in the model.  It will take efforts by both you and the OPM team to 
get to a satisfactory level of data quality.  This process can start with 
this months data collection efforts.  Please pay particular attention this 
month as the "bar is being raised" by the management of Energy Operations for 
data quality and timeliness.

The attached survey drives your costs from your activities to the commercial 
teams.  Please select your RCs, and fill in the driver quantity for the 
requested driver for the month of May. Please fill out the attached activity 
driver survey with May numbers for your RC and return to Shari Mao by end of 
day Friday, June 2.

Please note the following updates:
For Nat Gas, Sally Beck is interested in physical (as denoted as PH in the 
survey) vs. financial (as denoted as FI in the survey) numbers, please 
provide statistics accordingly
If a driver has not been updated per your request, please call or email 
Jennifer Reside
If you have additional updates / suggestions or items that need correction, 
please call or email Jennifer Reside

If your group currently generates a standard report that captures the 
surveyed data, please send the report to Jennifer Reside.  This will 
eliminate your need to fill out this survey every month.  If you would like 
us to collect this information from someone within your team beginning next 
month, please let Jennifer know.

Please contact Jennifer Reside x3-5971 with questions (Shari is on vacation 
this week), or if you are unable to complete the survey within the allotted 
time.

Okay guys,

This one has been corrected.  The measured volumes pulled through this 
morning.  The allocations are corrected with deal #92399 on the 215 contract 
taking the swing.

Anything else just let me know.

Daren:

Sorry it has taken so long to get back to this issue, I am with EES now.  
Karen Lindley allocates this point but I feel the need to help her because 
this issue came to light while I was in transition.

Exxon allocates this point and we receive a allocation statement from them on 
a monthly basis.

December 2000
The total flow at the meter was 646 MMBtu.  I copied Esther Garcia on this 
e-mail so that she can look into the possibility that there is a measurement 
error.  Esther will need to respond to Karen on the matter of the possible 
measurement error.  Furthermore it seems odd to me that scheduling had 8,928 
MMBtu confirmed at this point and only 646 MMBtu flowed.  I would ask Mark 
where he got his confirmed volumes from.  As a temporary fix I reallocated 
the meter and gave the total flow to Alpine Resources.  They will be short 
paid in their minds until Ester and Karen can get the possible measurement 
error issue resolved.  I would also suggest that Mark and Karen get together 
to review the scheduling of this point so that Karen can call Exxon to 
reconcile their allocation with what we have (the additional Alpine deal) at 
this point.  Charlene can redraft her invoice on Monday 2/26/01 that will 
show the 646 MMBtu going to Alpine.

January 2001
Again scheduling has 9,193 confirmed at this meter when on 3,241 MMBtu 
flowed.  I temporarily reallocated the meter so that the entire volume that 
flowed went to Alpine.  They remain 10 MMBtu short paid but Charlene can 
redraft her invoice and pay them something until Mark (validity of other 
deals at this point) and Karen (Exxon's allocation of this point) can get 
this issue resolved.

There is also the issue with the Exxon transport at this point that was 
scheduled at 1,500 MMBtu per month for the months in question.  This 
transport affects the allocation at the King Ranch tailgate on the Exxon 024 
contract.  I copied Howard Camp who will be training the contractor that will 
take my place in Volume Management so that he can stay on top of the 
resolution of this issue.

Per our conversation earlier today, I need an accounting arrangement  set up 
for meter #980072 for the month of January so I can move the volumes from the

Daren,

On January 15 and 16, HPL bought some gas from Western Gas Resources at the 
Aquila Header (10.000 and 5.000 MMBTU's respectively).  This was a late 
Friday change so in order to get it scheduled in POPS, the gas was scheduled 
on the stranger's gas contract.  However, deal ticket #143709 was never 
updated to reflect those late changes.  Please let me know if you want me to 
update the deal ticket.  Thanks, Susan.

Daren - was there a deal for 5.000 at CP&L on Feb. 21?  CP&L shows 5.000, but 
I have looked in MOPS and there is not a deal.  Can you verify whether or not 
there was a deal for that day?  Thanks.

Aimee,

I received a call from CP&L about the February 2001 production invoice.  They 
are showing 5,000 mmbtu on February 21 for HPL.  We are not showing anything 
for HPL on that day.  Could you verify if this is correct?

Thanks for your help.

Rebecca

Over the past several weeks, we have seen an increase in the number of 
"killed" or modified EOL transactions.   Please remind each of your 
respective groups that this is not an option. Once a customer "clicks" on a 
deal, we have a valid, binding contract.   We lose our audit trail, and we 
can potentially expose ourselves from a Legal standpoint.   I talked to Mark 
Taylor about this today, and the best option is for Legal to prepare a 
termination agreement when we agree to let a customer out of a deal.  We 
(Product Control) should be notified immediately if someone is requesting to 
change an EOL deal.  You can call either myself, Jennifer Denny (x35824), 
Frank Davis (x37235), or Dale Neuner (39746). 

Call me if you have any questions.

    ticket to handle the buyback on meters 981373 & 981384 that pretain to 
Equistar for June and July 2000.

June 2000 activity.

 Daren wanted me to make this request to you for an Equistar Buyback Ticket 
on Enron North America{ENA}.
 
 Equistar has nominated activity on ENA for June and July 2000 production.
 
 Settlement seems to think a Buyback ticket is necessary to properly account 
for Equistar's monthly activity.

Janet- 

Per Southern Union's confirmation sheet, the 15,000 mmbtus spot deal on days 03/25 & 3/26 should be priced at  HSC GDP DA +.05 ( at Tuesday, 3/27/01 pricing- which was $ 5.235). Currently, Sitara is showing a price of  HSC GDP +.05.

 Is this Tuesday pricing correct?  If so, pls forward this to Daren so that he can change the price in Sitara to $ 5.235 +.05 ( Totaling $5.285).


Thanks- Katherine

Currently, these volumes are being booked under the HPL Strangers Gas 
Contract.  Logistics needs either a deal to record these volumes which have 
flowed into HPL's  pipeline or Logistics needs approval to writeoff these 
volumes to Unaccounted for Gas.  (Please print, sign, and return original to 
Clem Cernosek).  There was no deal at this meter the previous month or the 
later month.

Introduction

In response to feedback received from Enron traders worldwide, we have 
upgraded and improved the Stack Manager to include new functionality which we 
hope will improve its effectiveness and usefulness in the management of your 
products.

This new release will be automatically installed within the next few days. 
Please ensure you log out at night in order to receive the upgrade.

Summary of New Features

Multiple Children - A "Child" product can be the "Parent" of another Child 
(multiple links in a chain) and different types of links can be placed 
against a single Parent.

Static Product Bar Prices - When you change a price in the Product Bar and 
hit the "+" or "-" button, the price stays - it does not reset to the amount 
in Product Properties until you logout.

Sorting - You can sort by any field on the Products Tab simply by clicking on 
the title of the field. For multiple sorts, hold down your "shift" key.

Parent Products which are at the top of a stack do not have their basis 
relationship identified. (e.g. The Product bar might before have said: "Basis 
Link - Parent" and now would say "Stand Alone, Parent").


Detailed Feature Descriptions


Multiple Children

The new version of EnronOnline allows you to link several products together 
in a long chain. For example, Child Product A can be linked to Parent Product 
B, which is in turn linked to Parent Product C.

Warning: Although there is no absolute limit to the number of links in a 
chain, system performance is degraded by large chains. This is because when a 
customer attempts a transaction, the database must "lock" each and every 
product in the chain before it can process the transaction request. The 
database must then update the stack for each product before releasing the 
locks. "Vertical" chains (multiple parents and children in one long link) are 
much slower to process than "Flat" chains (One parent with many children). 
Large vertical chains should be avoided. 

Related to this feature is the ability to have several types of links on the 
same parent. For example, Child Product A can have a Basis link to Parent 
Product B. At the same time, Child Product C can have a Syncopated Basis link 
to the same Parent Product B. Parent B is the parent for both a Syncopated 
Basis link and a regular Basis Link.


Static Product Bar Prices

The new version of EnronOnline provides for "sticky" Product Bar price and 
volume changes. When you change a number on the Product Bar, it does not 
reset to the number contained in the Product Properties menu until after you 
have logged out. This makes it easier to update prices, volumes, spreads or 
offsets in a changing market without repeated hits to the "+" or "-" buttons. 

One of the benefits of setting these numbers to appropriate levels is that it 
reduces repeated price movements. With the old version of Stack Manager, if 
the price delta was too small, traders would often repeatedly hit the price 
movement buttons. Each of these price changes must be communicated across the 
website to customers and consumes valuable bandwidth. This makes it harder 
for customers to transact with us - each time they try, a new price update 
moves the price, resulting in an increased transaction failure rate. Entering 
an appropriate price into the Price Delta field and then pressing the price 
movement button means that fewer (but larger) price movements are necessary, 
improving overall system response and reducing customer transaction failure 
rate.

You may also notice a new addition to the Product Bar prices - a new field 
for Offset to Last Trade. This allows you to update the offset for Products 
which have Offset to Last Trade selected from the Product Properties Menu.


Sorting/Selecting

The new version of EnronOnline provide significant additional sorting 
functionality over the old. You can now choose any field heading (Type, 
Location, Reference Period,  etc.) and sort by that item. You can do multiple 
sorts by holding down the shift key. Example: If you select Type and then 
Location while holding the shift key, you will see your products sorted first 
by Product Type and then within each Product Type, by Location (in 
alphabetical order).

If you right click on the Product menu, you can choose from the same sort 
criteria, plus you can select "Sort by Web Order", which allows you to see 
your products in the same order as they would appear to a customer on the 
website (note however, that a customer on the website might be also seeing a 
number of products in addition to the ones you are managing).

When you select products, you can drag your mouse while holding down the left 
mouse button as always, but now you can also hold down the <ctrl> key while 
making your selections. This allows you to highlight products which are not 
necessarily adjacent to one another.


Parent Products and F/X Products

One of the differences in the way that the new version works is in its 
treatment of how parent products are displayed. The old version showed the 
type of link associated with the parent in the Product Bar (to the left of 
the main Product Bar update buttons above the products tabs). The new version 
does not show the type of link. This is because the new version allows for 
more than one type of link on each parent product.

Some traders may notice that  their  products which have f/x links are now 
identified with a stylised "fx" in the Product list. This is to enable easy 
identification of products which are run as a Foreign Exchange link to the 
parent, rather than managed individually.

Team:

I have asked Troy Denetsosie to be responsible for compiling and updating a detailed supply, market and infrastructure analysis of Texas.  This information will support both our origination and trading activities and we will use a lot of the format (website and other) developed by the other regions.  Spcifically,  Troy will offload a lot the analysis work that JD is currently doing on the market side and he will work closely with Bryan Hull to support the more immediate needs of the traders.

The deliverables from Troy will be: (1) a Texas section on the gas fundamentals webpage modeled after the Central region, (2) a daily report on gas flows, deals, basis positons, etc., (3) a detailed infrastructure analysis (maps, flows, etc) that will support the development of our supply/market hub positions.  Please give him your support.

Regards,
Brian

Subject:	FW: CRM Database

As you know, much of JD, Mark and my time to date has been geared around finding what companies, customers, phone numbers and past business that we may have done with the customers we started with and move forward from that starting point. In the few short weeks we have addressed, uncovered and started down the road to what I hope to be a very profitable 2001-2002. 

The CRM Database should be a great tool for those that follow. It appears that the originators would log in calls, meetings and any other business that gets discussed with the customer. This would have been a great tool for our group to have had in starting from ground zero.

There still appears to be some developmental issues around this program. In the meantime, we are using a number of spreadsheets to keep up with our business. Should the CRM Database not be approved or delayed, we have decided to populate the ACT 2000! database. This is currently supported by Enron but is not as user friendly as the CRM would be. The cost for ACT 2000! is relatively free!

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Subject:	CRM Database

On Thursday of this past week I went to a meeting regarding the CRM database which is designed by Siebel for the purpose of handling customer information.

The CRM database has only been implemented with trading/origination groups within Enron and provides the following capabilities:
	1.  Account & Contact Management
	2.  Activity Tracking & Planning
	3.  Potential Deal Management
	4.  Outlook Synchronization
	5.  Remote Connectivity/Synchronization
	6.  E-mail from Siebel and records activity

The current Enron groups that use this system are the Enron Industrial Markets that was implemented in May 2001 and the Freight Markets that was implemented in August 2001.  The following is a list of how these groups have been utilizing the system:
			Industrial MKTs				Freight MKTs
Users				175					45
Counterparties			8,200					20,000
Contacts			14,000					20,000
Activities			1,200					900
Quotes									150
Opportunities			361					11

The following groups have also inquired about this system and having it implemented:
		EOL
		Global Mkts
		EES
		Transportation
		East Power Orig
		Insolvent Debt
		
Some of the basic costs and timeline for this system are $120-$150,000 for 20-30 users with a 5 week timeline for implementation.  This is a basic implementation that may not include all of the functionality shown above (i.e., no remote connectivity).  

The reason that I have written this is to show a possible system that could be used by the gas floor origination and trading groups to manage contact information and share data among groups.  The cost to implement this for all of the origination groups does not appear to be prohibitive and it could be implemented in a good time frame.  Some of the issues are coordination among the groups and the desire to share information.  Let me know if you think this is a viable possibility and what would be the best way to approach the other origination groups.

Colin Tonks, database/system guy, within the Fundamentals group was also at the meeting and thinks this would work great.  He would be the individual coordinating efforts from the natural gas system side.
Thanks,
JD

We will be killing about 2000 deals in Sitara tonight. Whenever a deal is touched in Sitara, it will bridge over to Unify. THese are Desk2Desk deals, and should have minimal impact on you.

Clarissa - Thanks so much for all your help with this pipe!  Everything looks great.  I just have a couple of paths
that I need to finish it:

January 2000 - I need deal #854688 pathed for EPGT and for TETC.  According to the invoice, we should have
                      11,129 dth on the interconnect.

February 2000 - I need deal #871184 pathed for HPL and CHAN.  HPL should have 3,600 dth and CHAN should
                       have 11,500 dth on the interconnect.

July 2000 - Deal #871172 has an interconnect issue.  According to MOPS contract #105124, they received 8,275 dth
                 on the Matagorda 624, but according to EPGT, they delivered 10,362 dth to HPL (?)  Could this possibly
                 need to be split somehow, or do you have any other ideas?

Let me know.  Thanks, Gloria 3-7118

Daren,

Meter 1491 has steady flow for the first 13 days of the month.  It is the 
Shanghai Energy Gas Lift Sales Mtr.  Previously, these volumes have been 
placed on the Strangers Agreement, but, I don't know that that is correct.  
The volume is steady between 150 and 200 per day.  If I should be asking 
someone else, please let me know.

Thank you for all of your assistance and patience,

Mary Jane

Hi Daren, 

I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter. Here are the swing volumes as you requested. Don't pay attention to anything other than the highlighted columns in July's spreadsheet b/c it's not finished. If you need anything else, please let me know. Thanks!

Well- I have officially NOT heard from Hilcorp after numerous voice and email 
messages.  Please plan to have the gas rerouted back down the valley line for 
the Dec 1 forward.  Call if you have any questions-

Jackie, Talk to Darren about this. The deal you reference is an HPL deal with 
Dynegy and I don't have access to it. I'm on the East desk. Yesterday I 
extended the deal 421415 for the 6th and 19th and Meredith inserted a path in 
Unify - TETCO  to cover the small overflow volume between HPL and ENA. The 
ENA/HPL piece is done. The piece between HPL and Dynegy is what you need 
inserted.THANKS

Victor, can you extend the deal 422516 for days 6 and 9 please?  Thanks.  Oh

I don't want to tell you to add any contracts, because I am not sure about 
that.   I am just saying if you look at Ray's schedule there are 2 deals out 
there, one is a purchase from ENA and the other a purchase from Dynegy.  The 
track id I gave you was for ENA.   You  cannot allocate the Dynegy piece 
until I give you a track id.   I cannot give you a track id until the deal is 
extended for days 10/6 and 10/19.

Jackie,
You did not allocate this according to Ray's schedule.  The track id I gave 
you was only for the purchase from ENA.   You need to extend the deal for the 
purchase from Dynegy.   You put all of the volume on these 2 days on ENA, 
that is not what is on Ray's schedule, so we are still out on the 
interconnect report.

Jackie,

Your allocation is correct with the exception of days 10/6 and 10/19 where 
strangers gas is allocated.    I have created an accounting arrangement for 
these days and the new track id for ENA is 240384.  Please allocate the ENA 
portion according to Rays schedule for these 2 days.    Deal 422516 (Purchase 
from Dynegy) needs to be extended for these 2 days so I can do an accounting 
arrangement.   Alfonso  I need for you to allocate your meter daily, because 
we have tiered pricing this month.

Thanks.

Megan, 

The April and May nomination spreadsheets from Producer Services reflect that there were purchases from Conoco on HPL.  There are no references to any purchases from Conoco on GEPL.  On June 6, 2001, Tom Acton edited deal ticket # 133304 to include GEPL meter #'s 27-002-08 and 27-003-08.  I have no idea why Tom edited the deal ticket to include the GEPL meters.  Tom is no longer at AEP and I couldn't find any documentation to support the changes.  Please advise if you need additional information.

The pricing for the base deal is based on the GD, but it's the average of the gas daily plus .02, right? And I was told that Sitara could not handle this pricing structure, that it had to be calculated and entered as a fixed price. Is this correct?

The pricing on the base deal should also be based on GD.  I have changed the price to GDP.  Let me know if that doesn't correct that piece.  Jay is currently looking into the volume issue.

Jay,

For June, I need a couple of things changed in Sitara: 
Deal 819592 - the commodity price needs to be 3.6318
Deal 819594 - the commodity price needs to be WAHA.HUB.GDP.D.A+.02

And for July............
It looks like we're missing some volume............
Deal 895651 - baseload deal - should have 55,000 per day allocated. AND in Sitara this deal should be priced at $3.0505.
Deal 895691 - swing deal - currently has 234,000 in the scheduled column and it should be 441,000 based on the spreadsheet I sent. Did you have some conflicting volumes? I'm resending what the volumes should be. AND the pricing for this should be at WAHA.HUB.GDP.D.A+.02.

 << File: 0107 daily swing.xls >> 

I think that should do if for now. I'll wait to see how these changes come across. Please notify me when these changes have been made. Thanks!

In reference to a note sent to Darren Farmer:  Houston Pipleline mistake on June 18th

The volume of 50,000 for deal 819594 was a mistake.  The proper value was 30,000 just as you had mentioned.   Everything should now be fixed.  Please let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks,

Kim,  

Will you please get with Mary Smith and Trisha Hughes with the Texas Rates 
group
and pick up from them the off system pipeline rates that they are handling.

You may want to visit with Daren Farmer also about the level of activity.

We need to transition this work to your team as soon as possible.

thanks

bob

10,000 should be allocated to Adonis #51862 on the 5th only.  Nothing should 
be allocated or confirmed for Adonis on the 16th.  Additionally, it looks 
like 5000 was confirmed as a receipt from Mitchell (Track ID 3167) on the 
16th.  This should be -0- also.  By taking the conf/allocation for Adonis 
(Track ID 6155) and Mitchell (Track ID 3167) to zero on the 16th, the meter 
balance remains the same and the bridge errors will be cleared.

Gary has placed this in Daren's lap.  Please read the below information that 
was requested of me from Daren. 

This is the latest.

On day 5 in MOPS (HPL/ENA) there is a delivery nom of 10.0 pathed to the ENA 
201 K.  On day 16 in MOPS (HPL/ENA) there is not a deal (which is strange 
because day 16 in POPS references Adonis).  The deal on the 5th was a swing 
deal.

Jackie, 

What does MOPS show for the days in question?  It would be incorrect to add 
any days to the Adonis ticket mentioned below.  It sounds as if the meter was 
allocated incorrectly in POPS and/or a deal was not pathed correctly in 
MOPS.  Let me know what you find in MOPS.

Here is the issue for 1/16/99 at meter 984132.   

20,000 mmbtu were confirmed for Adonis in POPS.   10,000 mmbtu on day 5 and 
day 16.   Day 16 is not valid for deal 51862 (track id 6155), which is where 
10,000 was confirmed.   The  actual sale to Adonis was 10,000 which was 
invoiced and paid by Adonis.  We are trying to clear the feedback error 
report.   My question is why was 10,000 confirmed on 1/16/99 if the date is 
not valid for the deal?

When Karen allocates the actual 10,000 it is prorating 5,000 for each day 
that is confirmed (the 5th and 16th).  

Should the whole 10,000 be allocated to the 5th or should 5,000 be allocated 
to each day?   If 5,000 should be allocated to each day, the 16th needs to be 
added to the deal.

Daren - Deal # 97929, meter 1450 expired Nov. '99.  Is there a way for you to 
extend the deal or create a new one since there seems to be a little bit of 
flow each month?

Aimee:

There is a bridgeback error at the above referenced meter and month.  The 
reason for the error is that the deal, # 97929 has expired.  Please determine 
if the deal was to be extended or is there another deal to replace it?

To fix this I will set up an accounting arrangement but what I need from you 
is a valid deal number and the transportation contract that you want me to 
put the deal on.

Thanks in advance for your help,

Fred

The Methanol plant has determined extensive repairs are needed, including 
replacement of piping and retubing of 2 of the 3 preheat exchangers.

It appears that the plant will be down until the last week of the month.  At 
a minimum, the plant will be down until the middle of next week.    A better 
estimate of downtime will be available by tomorrow afternoon.

Imperial Sugar's volumes will be 142,000-144,000 mmbtu for the month of may instead of the 155,000 which we have scheduled.  Could we please make the appropriate nomination change and also let me know how we plan to price the buyback.  Also, is there any way to roll the 12,000 mmbtu deficiency over to June business.

Subject: Interconnect / Intercompany issues

Below is a list of the major items that are still outstanding on the 
interdesk/interconnect report for 1999 and 2000 that is impacting the 
intercompany cleanup for SAP implementation.  These issues have been 
addressed in earlier E-Mails and this is an updated list of issues that need 
to be completed by June 19, 2000.


1) King Ranch interstates - Fred and Stella are working with Exxon to 
reconcile from Oct 1999 - Apr 2000 the interstate nominations for Tennessee 
and NGPL and also for Tejas.
                             
2) Tetco Meter 6892 -  Question of who has custody transfer at the meter.  
ENA is using Tetco's  volume and HPLC is using the HPL Measurement volume, 
causing a desk to desk variance.
                                            Clem and Pat are working on.

3) Transco Bammel  Meter 74 - Transco and HPL's nominations are out of 
balance at Meter 74. Charlotte needs to work with Transco to resolve.

4) Dow  Meter 4486 - The sale to Entex needs to be taken off of HPLC meter 
4486 and the sale needs to be at Dow Meter 4486.  
                                          A desk to desk between ENA (buyer) 
and HPLC (seller) needs to be set up on Dow Meter 4486.
                                          Ami needs to set up the deals and 
Thu needs to coordinate the months involved.

                                          Once this is done and Thu 
reallocates to Dow Pipeline, Jackie needs to zero out the confirmed noms and 
make the meter non allocatable in Pops.
                                          Clem verified with Steve Schneider

Just to set the record straight, Measurement was not contacted nor informed 
that the recorded flow was inaccurate. We are dependent on the field to 
verify measurement information, and absent information to the contrary, the 
recorded volumes were published. The HMS technician , Charlie Speigel, was 
contacted today , and this issue was discussed and  verified that he 
neglected to notify GMS of the erroneous recorded flow. We will correct the 
statements to reflect zero flow based on this discussion.

Subject: Brandywine Meter #: 981225 ; March, 2000 Activity

There was no flow at meter 981225 for the month of March.  The HMS technician 
did contact measurement once to get the volumes zeroed out but apparently he 
will have to get with them again.  I have notified the tech and he is in the 
process of doing this.

The meter is set on pressure control and the valve is open.  Gas Control's 
understanding and the field's understanding is that at the time the 
Brandywine deal ended some sort of standby agreement was in place.  If this 
is not the case please let me know and we will notify the plant and close the 
valve.

Robert,  
 In the future if you have meters like this where there is a small flow 
volume without a nomination in place please check with Earl and myself so we 
can investigate before we get commercial involved.

Thanks

How is this meter set up?  Why would it have flowed in March?  Any ideas?  Is 
it on pressure control?  If so, what's the set point?  I need to know before 
I can go to Oxy and/or DuPont and make a claim ....

Can you please extend sitara deal #156657 for 3/1/00, if the deal will 
allow?  It was transported on the 215K, which was the only one out there for 
2/00.

It spilled over into March on day 1 for .423 dec.

Subject: 24 x 5 Products

Eric Bass, Texas Desk trader, requested the following product described below 
be traded on EnronOnline. This product will NOT bridge into Sitara and will 
have to be put in manually. 

The reason it will not bridge is due to the fact that it can have multiple 
stripes of start & end dates rather than one start & end date. Currently, 
EnronOnline can
only send one start & end date per deal therefore it will fail in the bridge 
monitor and will have to be manually entered into Sitara & subsequently 
cleared out of the monitor. 

Since these transactions could flow next day, it is imperative that these 
transactions get into Sitara as soon as possible. Please read the FULL 
description below. (This product looks like a month long deal but excludes 
weekends. The "Wkd" is short for week days.)

We do not anticipate a large volume of these transactions but need to be 
prepared to react quickly when they do. For the future, we are looking into 
the cost/benefit of EnronOnline having the capability of sending multiple 
dates for these types of products.

If you have any questions, please call me at 3-5824
Thank you.

Subject: 24 x 5 Products

We are rolling out the use of the 24 x 5 Nat Gas Product commencing tomorrow, 
May 24th. 

The Product is a month-long Physical Nat Gas Product traded off the Texas 
desk. It will be identified as follows:

US Gas Phy       Exxon Katy WkD          Jun00           USD/MM

This Product is different from the usual Products traded on the Texas Desk in 
that the Product  description has an 
indicator of  WkD, which designates that the Product only moves gas on a day 
that is a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, 
Thursday or Friday.

These Products WILL NOT bridge into Sitara. Risk personnel will need to be 
diligent to identify these Products based 
on the information in the Product Description to ensure that the Products are 
entered into Sitara correctly (presumably - 
strips of Monday-Friday trades and the corresponding month-starting days 
and/or month-ending days).

We understand the potential impact of having to manually input these 
transactions and have asked the appropriate
systems personnel to examine the links between EOL and Sitara and consider 
building bridge capability. In the
interim, we anticipate that the trading volume on these Products will be low, 
and will ask for higher prioritization of the
bridging in the event that volumes increase.

Darren,  we had a situation in December that we need your help to resolve.

Deal #125836 We have been purchasing gas from Cox Exploration on PG&E 
Hydorcarbons systems upstream of the processing facility.  This purchase 
agreement terminated 11/30/99.  I didn't path the gas on PGEH, however, I 
will take responsibility for not adjusting the interconnect ticket at 
Thompsonville.  I didn't catch this and the Deal on the HPL side appeared to 
be a valid flow issue for Kim Vaughn.  The plant continued to confirm this 
gas.

We have tried working through the pipeline, but they state that they will not 
know anything until the 15th.  Can you contact the producer and ask them to 
reverify this with the pipeline?  I would like Kim to be able to zero confirm 
and send back to Pops so Volume Management will not allocate up to the 
producer level.

Also I just realized that we have a committed reserve purchase agreement at 
the same meter with Tribo Production.  Should there have been an expected 
volume in this Deal?  Is it possible that Cox exploration sold their interest 
in this well to Tribo.  It may turn out that we should have flowed the gas 
after all.

This deal is to book the Teco PVR revenue.  It is my understanding that Teco 
just sends us a check, I haven't received an answer as to whether there is a 
predermined price associated with this deal or if Teco just lets us know what 
we are giving.  I can continue to chase this deal down if you need.

As a follow-up to Stephen Schwarz's message below regarding training 
resources, I wanted to let everyone know that there will not be a charge in 
2000 for any Energy Operations employee to attend any training classes that 
have been developed by Energy Operations (i.e., Sitara, Unify and 
Magellan/LiveLink).  There will be a charge to your RC, however, if an Energy 
Operations employee signs up for one of these classes and fails to cancel 
within the established guidelines.

I know there was a lot of concern regarding your budget and costs for 
training classes after the Corporate Training Department announced that there 
would be a change in policy this year.  Your RC will be charged a fee for any 
course that your employee signs up and attends through ERNIE.  I just wanted 
to clarify the costs associated for any systems training detailed above will 
not be charged to your RC even though you and your employees use ERNIE to 
register for these classes.  I have instructed the people in the Training 
Department who are in charge of billing to follow this policy.  If you 
receive a charge in error on your RC report, please let me know immediately 
so that I can make the necessary corrections.

If you have any further questions, please call me.  Thanks.

Beginning March 1, the training resources you have been using from the 
Project Sirius team, (Elwanda Bennett and Joyce Jenkins), will no longer be 
available.  We have outsourced the delivery of operational training, 
including the systems-oriented training that Elwanda and Joyce have been 
delivering, to TEAMLeadership Center.  Many of you are already working with 
TEAMLeadership on the development of operational training for Energy 
Operations.  TEAMLeadership will be working this year to integrate our 
systems training and operational training into a single coordinated training 
effort tailored to the needs of Energy Operations.

In an effort to manage effectively  both priorities and dollars spent, Lisa 
Cousino will be ENA's point of contact with TEAMLeadership.  Please make Lisa 
aware of all services requested from TEAMLeadership.  If you have any 
questions about these arrangements, please call Lisa at X36343.

Please share this information with your staff.

Friday 1/19/01 - Received a call from Sheila at Basin regarding a well which 
may be coming on this weekend (meter 9696).  Phone Lee in Gas Control 
regarding same.  Lee informed me that HPL would prefer that the volumes are 
not brought on until a field tech can pull a sample and verify that there are 
no liquids involved.  Lee further informed me that the same day to Tejas at 
Hardy was not in the system, and, per Gary Hanks, needed to be corrected.  
Lee informed me that the volumes were actually split 10M at Hardy/Tejas and 
10M at Lomax.  I went into Sitara and updated the deal ticket, pathed and 
nominated over to Pops.

Saturday 1/20/01 - 8:30 am  Sean paged regarding the nomination at Dow 
Freeport, he was questioning the validity, as we do not often flow at this 
meter.  I checked and the nomination was good for Saturday's gas day.  Sean 
informed me that the Valero Refinery was up and down and would be going 
completely down on Sunday.

10:00 am  - Sean called regarding Tejas LaPorte, meter 665.  Apparently, the 
meter had a confirmed volume of 20M and HPL/ENA had no deal at the meter.  
Checked in POPS and discovered that the deal was confirmed at 20M on a deal 
volume of zero.  Informed Sean that the Tejas volume was confirmed.  Also, 
per Sean Koch George West (meter 6722) had a nomination increase of 10M, 
which he wanted to confirm.

Sunday 1/21/01  10:00 am  Sean paged regarding the Dow meter 1442, Pops still 
showed a confirmed voume of 10M which Dow and Oasis showed at zero for 
Sunday.  I  checked the system and confirmed that the meter was indeed at 
zero and phoned Sean back to confirm.  Checked on MTP Hardy, Sean informed me 
that we came in on rate for Saturday and that current meter activity looked 
good.

Daren, I'm looking at S93481 for 01/00.  3,461 mmbtu was scheduled to Copano 
P/L in 02/00 and the counterparty was paid.  In 05/00 the volumes were 
reversed from this deal.  Would you be able to tell why they were reversed?  
I'm trying to determine if this is a valid recoverable item.  Thanks.

The above referenced days have been placed on strangers gas due to (I guess) 
the meter not being turned off in time.  The day prior to each of these days 
that are assessed to strangers gas, the only active K is the HPL 216.

Can these deals be rolled to cover these couple of days?

Charlene, 

Deal #214948 already had volume and price for the 12th and 13th.  You may 
need to have the volumes updated by Volume Management.

I added the 15th and 16th to the deal ticket.

This gas purchase is not a part of the wellhead portfolio but is being traded

Meter 986725 for March 2000.   Per Hesco both traders are gone at (Hesco and 
Enron)  and they (Hesco) were not paid  the correct price  in March on the 
days mentioned below. Hesco cannot find where the price for these days were 
recorded.  Per Hesco they  were underpaid by $32,101.57.  Hesco is wanting to 
come to our office to have a meeting about clearing this up.  It will be nice 
if we don't have to meet with them.

no, it was a GTC Firm.  You will need to create a new deal.

Daren---

I need some help with meter 5892 for September 00 due to a feedback error.  
Deal 133196 (purchase from Duke on gathering contract) is erroring out due to 
it's expiration date of 8/31/00......however it still showed up in POPS (w/o 
a nom) on 9/1.  Volume management allocated volume to it according to the 
allocation statement.  Should this deal be extended?  I noticed it is not out 
there for October either.  I have the feedback error sheet & allocation if 
you want to see them.

Let me know,

Mark

p.s. Fred Boas said you used to handle this and you were very wise in the art 
of allocation......so I am expecting big results Grasshopper!

I am working on a project for Brenda Herod & was wondering if one of you 
could tell me if I'm on the right track & if this will get everything for 
which she is looking.

She is trying to draft a long-term transport/storage agreement between ENA & 
HPLC which will allow ENA to move the gas to their markets.  In order to 
accomplish this, she needs to know all of the Sales to customers that ENA is 
doing off of HPL's pipe.

I had Scott Mills run a report from Sitara showing all ENA Buy/Sell Activity 
on HPL since 7/99.  If I eliminate the Buys & the desk-to-desk deals, will 
this give me everything that I need?

Are there buy/sell deals done with ENA on HPL's pipe that wouldn't show up in 
Sitara?  Someone mentioned something about deals where HPL transports the gas 
on it's own behalf then ENA sells it to a customer at that same spot  --  
?????  Do deals like that happen? Would they show up in Sitara?

Is there anything else that I'm missing?  I'm not real familiar with how some 
of these deals happen nowadays so am very receptive to any 
ideas/suggestions/help that you can offer !!!

Thanks in advance.

I received the above allocation for this deal where there is a purchase from Spinnaker and a sale to Dow.  The volumes have not be actualized so there is nothing in Volume Management.  Can one of you look into this and get back to me.

Each of you have been chosen by one or more of my direct reports to provide 
mid-year feedback.  I just wanted to urge you to provide this to me ASAP, as 
my PRC meeting wil be 6/13, even though the feedback system is open through 
6/16.  Therefore, I need your feedback by FRIDAY, 6/9 so that I can use the 
week-end to get ready.  Although I would prefer the feedback through the 
system, if you are finding yourself in a bind for time, please provide me 
your feedback verbally either through voicemail (mark it private) or I would 
be happy to meet with you.

I know we all receive many of these requests, but I sincerely appreciate 
constructive feedback.  Thanks in advance for your input!

The MTBE plant went down about 1 a.m. on Saturday morning, May 20, as a 
result of power failure.  Apparently lightning knocked out the power 
substation. 

The oleflex is starting up, along with the MTBE plant, and butamer.  Some 
production is expected tonight with full rains possibly attained tomorrow.

FYI------Guadalupe had a plant go down today 2/27, and therefore had to get 
some gas off Oasis, so they took all 40.0 from AEC back into the Aquila 
Header, so I moved the deals to reflect this on WGR (Aquila Header ).  
Guadalupe deals:  594527 & 578932.

They said there is a chance they will have to do it again tomorrow.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Darin,

Since the volume on this ENA deal is on PGEV (EPGT Texas) Pipeline, the ENA Volume Management contact is Hakeem Ogunbunmi.  His number is X-31801 and he has been cc'd on this note.  

FYI - ENA Volume Management has assumed all of the volume duties associated with all Texas deals that are not specifically on Houston Pipe Line.  For those on Houston Pipe Line, I will still be the contact.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

Buddy - Daren Farmer called and said that on 4/30/2001, on HPL deal #108058, that there was around 20,000 MMBTU scheduled, but when it was actualized, it was actualized at 0.  He thinks this is incorrect.  Can you check into this and get back with Daren?  I'll be out of the office tomorrow, so please get back with him directly.  Thanks.

The total flow has been 2804.

Bob,

I wanted to just follow up with you about what we had discussed a couple weeks ago.  We had briefly touched on the possibility of me rotating down with Daren and working the off system scheduling.

I was talking with Daren last night and he had not heard anything about this.  I plan to begin working with Mark and Mary next week to learn how to schedule these pipes.  Before we begin this, I just wanted to make sure that what we had discussed is still planned.

Thanks for your time.

Mike

Deal 114096 is the purchase from HPLR Liquids.  This purchase is on 138544

Stella:

The Swift deal is not pathed correctly in POPS.  I set up an accounting 
arrangement on the 012-41500-02-015 contract with the Track ID 80705.  Would 
you put the contract in POPS with the associated Track ID?  

The transportation contract (012-41500-02-003) for the Liquids Replacement 
gas is not POPS.  I looked in Path Manager and there is no deal for it 
either.  In December, the deal for this gas was 114096.  Could you extend the 
deal or get me the number for the new deal if there is one?  I need to set up 
an accounting arrangement so I will need for you to verify the deal number 
and transportation contract that this gas is supposed to go on.  When I set 
up the accounting arrangement I will let you know what the Track ID is so you 
can put the contract at meter 9643.

Let me know when all of this is done so that I can reallocate the meter.

Thanks,

Fred

Per Southern Union's confirmation sheet, the 15,000 mmbtus spot deal on days 03/25 & 3/26 should be priced at  HSC GDP DA +.05 ( at Tuesday, 3/27/01 pricing- which was $ 5.235). Currently, Sitara is showing a price of  HSC GDP +.05.

 Is this Tuesday pricing correct?  If so, pls forward this to Daren so that he can change the price in Sitara to $ 5.235 +.05 ( Totaling $5.285).

Below is a list of Sitara deals that had volume variances or where one side 
(purchase/sale) did not get accrued for the FEB 2000 accrual.     My goal 
here is to bring this to everyone attention and second to see if there is a 
solution.    I am taking a simplistic approach here in that since 
Intercompany Sitara deals are the same that the nominations on both sides 
should match on the month end accruals.    If I am wrong on this assumption 
or if there is a system limitation I am free to suggestions, ideas or 
resolutions.   Please feel free to give me a call. 

HPLC selling to ENA.   Production month FEB00(accrual):
Volume variance:

156071  HPL/0980391  vol var of 24,167mmbtu  <$60,538.34>

FYI.  Wanted to forward what I'm getting from legal on the TGLO contract- 
clear as mud.

Lauri,   From a legal standpoint, we can cut the nomination on an 
interruptible agreement at our discretion.  The contract clearly gives us 
this right.  I haven't specifically reviewed the contract, but I am assuming 
it is our standard form.  I will check this.

Yes, I would consider HISD facilities to be state facilities.  The fact that 
this goes to Entex first complicates the issue.  

Dan,  was the intent that it be directly delivered to state facilities, or if 
it ultimately ended up at state facilities?

I haven't heard anything back from you guys on this.  Any insight?  I know 
Linda Roberts is also working a deal with TGLO to convert bbls to mmbtus 
which could mean incremental volumes that TGLO would be trying to get into 
Midcon.

Gerald/Eric-

I have a couple of questions regarding TGLO transport contract 
012-88494-202.  We are currently delivering a volume of 28.000mm into various 
Midcon interconnects on this contract that are designated to go to 
Reliant/Entex for the purpose of heating HISD schools.  The transport 
contract stipulates different rates for this delivery depending on whether 
the gas is intended for state facilities or not.  My first question, then, 
is:  are HISD schools considered state facilities?  And, if HISD schools are 
considered state facilities, does the fact that this gas is being delivered 
to them via Reliant/Entex utilizing Midcon's pipe make any difference?

I am asking these questions not only to assure that we are recouping the 
correct transport rate, but also to determine what the consequences might be 
if I interrupt this delivery.  We are having difficulty getting enough gas 
into Midcon to cover our Entex noms and I am just exploring my options.  I 
would also expect that this volume should decrease when HISD closes for the 
Christmas holidays- does the fact that this is an IT agreement give me enough 
leverage to cut this nom if TGLO does not do so voluntarily?

Thanks for your help.

Daren,

This meter has recorded flow for the following days with no deal.

10-29-99 1300
10-30-99     23
10-31-99     23
2-06-01               (4222)

We used deal 83388 last January to write off this meter's HPL Strangers 
balances.  How should this flow be handled?

George-

In this afternoon's meeting with Producer Services, Jill mentioned that the 
referenced well had been reperfed (meaning they shot more holes in the well 
piping allowing more gas to flow out of the well) and was now producing 
approximately 800/day.  Per Jill, the MDQ on this well is 3000/day.  You may 
want to look at getting this nom revised for the rest of the month.

Mary-  could you get Heidi or Lisa to check the transport rate we currently 
show on this?  It's being purchased for SC-.17 and is flowing through King 
Ranch.  

Thanks.

Hi Daren,

Can you please check into whether or not the below deals for the above meters 
can be rolled and extended?  If so, can you please perform this for me so 
that Anita can set up an accounting arrangement for me?

98-6719  Sitara Deal #166989 Flow @ meter began on February 10th but the deal 
is not effective until  February the 11th.
     No new deal # referenced and no evergreen flag.  This is on the 
gathering (96026573) K which is the only
     K @ the meter.

98-9676  Sitara Deal #151669 Deal good from 1/1/00 - 1/31/00 but there is 
flow for all of February 2000 with no K.  This is on the 215K      for 1/2000 
production which is the only K @ the meter.


Thanks

Tom,

The following production commenced to flow on last week and a ticket should 
be created and entered into sitara based on the following:


Counterparty   Meter   Volumes  Price   Period

Texas Nom, LP(dba
        Garrison, Ltd.)  9656   500mmbtu/d  100% GD less $0.10 3/27 - 3/31


Susan will create a committed reserves firm ticket for the remaining term of 
the deal once our geologists have gathered enough data to forecast the 
reserves of this well; at such time, this ticket should be zeroed out.


Thanks,

In response to Cheryl's note, in looking at a copy of a Confirmation Letter 
confirming the proposed agreement reached on March 1, 2000 to be effective 
April 1, 2000 through March 31, 2001, there is evergreen language.  
A termination letter is being prepared to be faxed to Exxon with an original 
to follow for their records. 

Cheryl, this GTC is different from the ones we usually see in that HPL 
required signatures from both parties executed by Exxon on 3/30/00 and HPL on 
8/21/00.

If you have any questions, please call me at x35231.

Thanks, Kim

Subject: Re: Exxon Company, USA Global # 96035668/Sitara # 212225  

I have re-checked Sitara & verified that the above deal was a Term, Firm 
deal.  This resulted in a GTC Purchase Firm contract being set-up in the 
Global Contracts System.  The term of the GTC was set as the term of the deal 
(4/1/00 thru 3/31/01) with no evergreen, meaning that the contract will 
expire at the end of this month.

To the best of my knowledge, all GTC Purchase Firms have the same language & 
they do not have evergreen.  They expire at the end of the primary term.

So, unless Exxon negotiated a deal with different, special language to allow 
for evergreen & included something about a "10 day notification" to 
terminate, there isn't any reason to "terminate" this contract.

If this is the case, please advise.  Otherwise, I don't think we need to do 
anything.  The contract will expire at the end of this month on its own.

Please prepare and send a termination letter by tomorrow March 16, 2001 on 
the above referenced deal.  Houston Pipe Line Company has not renegotiated a 
price and have no interest in buying the gas on an evergreen basis.  It is my 
understanding that we need to notify them within 10 days of the end of the 
delivery period

Stacey-

As per my earlier voice mail messages, I needed to confirm what the actual 
flow of gas was on PG&E for February 24th.  The Service Summary Report from 
PG&E indicated a flow of 50,000 mmbtus on the 24th, however, the Swamp Rat 
Fuel Allocations (HPL) indicates a flow of 53,000 mmbtus.  Can you ask PG&E 
to confirm which of these volume is correct so that the February allocations 
can be finalized?  Please let me know if there is any additional information 
I need to provide you.  

Thanks for your help-

This is a snapshot of my worksheet for October, I haven't received all of the 
volumes for November, but, I don't expect any radical changes in production 
at this time.

Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance.

I have a request from the ENA settlements group.  Williams Energy is billing 
the HPL purchase deals on the ENA invoice.  The accountant at Williams says, 
that by the request of the HPL trader, the deals are to be billed to ENA.  We 
would like to have the Texas deals billed directly to HPL.  If you do not 
have a problem with this, can you ask your counterpart at Williams to split 
the deals between HPL and ENA?  It would make the payment process much easier.

Thanks,
Megan

Jackie I  talked with Daren and we would like to wait for now, It is a little 
early in the month and the well may be just getting revved up.  Wells tend to 
move around a bit through the month and usually  even out at the end but 
thank you for bringing it to my attention and please feel free to inform me 
of any others that you might see.  The more eyes the better.  Thanks Jackie.

I need some assistance getting these deals corrected in the system for the 
weekend, so that I can get my errors clear.  I have tried to change the 
counterparty, but I am not able.  Jackie is out again today, so, I will be 
behind the proverbial 8-ball and would greatly appreciate your help clearing 
these things up.

Deal ticket 468688 P-MGI is in system as HPLC purch.  The correct entity is 
ENA IM Texas, ENA made the orig. Sale
Deal ticket 468110 D2D to deliver to Central desk at Humble is on ENA, These 
tickets have always been HPLC and not ENA.

Please let me know if there is anything that I can do to speed the process.  
I need to have all of my errors clean today.

Thank you,

Mary

Subject: Rankings for Source/Destination
Please forward to logistics in your region......

Would any of the desks be opposed to enabling Unify to default the 
Destination rankings to the same rankings that are created in the Source 
rankings.  There would still be the ability to change to ranking on the 
Destination side however, it would not  affect the rankings on the Source 
side.  This will save time pathing and prevent the amount of data entry 
errors.   Would you please forward comments to your manager.    Dave 
Nommenson is aware that some of us are interested in this and would like to 
find out if it would be something worth putting into production.
Thanks.

We are in the midst of enhancing the Operations Pricing Model (fka 
Transaction Costing Model) and as a result the following applies:

 - Do not need the hours surveys completed for July or August
 - Need the activity driver surveys completed for July and August
 
Attached is the activity driver survey for the month of July.   Please fill 
out the attached activity driver survey with July numbers for your RC and 
return to Shari Mao by end of day Friday, August 11.

During the enhancment period (July and August) we will be standardizing and 
consolidating activities across all commodities and operational functions.  
This will result in a shorter survey and easier time assignment to activities 
for your teams.  The shorter and easier surveying process will begin with the 
September survey.

Please call either me or Shari Mao at 39641 or 33859, respectively for any 
clarification.  Thanks for your patience and help,

James Scribner

I'm trying to get this to pull through to Unify for payment to Spinnaker. Volume Management shows "no detail".
Sitara indicated  685 mmbut 4/1-4/30 expected.
Who needs to talk to who to get this fixed.
Payment MUST be set up by noon 5/24/01 for prompt payment to Spinnaker.
Thank you and Please advise.

Subject:	COWTRAP ALLOCATION - 4/01

I received the above allocation for this deal where there is a purchase from Spinnaker and a sale to Dow.  The volumes have not be actualized so there is nothing in Volume Management.  Can one of you look into this and get back to me.

Thanks,

Joyce

During the period of 12/1/99 through 12/3/99, the above meter has recorded 
flow on the following days:

 Days    Mmbtus

 12/1/99              173
 12/3/99                39

               106


Deal #124400 was at this meter during November 1999, but it expired on 
11/30/99.  Currently, these volumes are being booked under the HPL Strangers 
Gas Contract.  Logistics needs either (1) Deal #124400 extended, (2) new 
deal, or (3) approval to write-off these volumes to Unaccounted for Gas.  
(Please print, sign, and return original to Clem Cernosek).

The tickets are finished.  I have updated most of the third party tickets, 
with the exception of Oasis/West of Prairie Lea and Oasis/East of Prairie 
Lea.  I saw several May tickets with this path, and want to conserve 
tickets.  I set up one ticket for this path.  Please let me know if you have 
any questions.  Dave, once volumes get attached to these tickets, I would 
like to run a Basis Adjustment report by pipe to double-check the desk 
rates.  Thanks.

Subject: June Transport Usage Tickets

I updated the June transport usage tickets today through HPL, and will be 
finishing these tickets tomorrow.  Rates have been updated to reflect current 
matrix rates and all baseload rates that I know of at this time.  I have not 
yet received third party transport rates, so if you know of any, please let 
me know.  Also, I have zeroed out some volumes on some tickets for June, so 
your schedulers will have to update volumes as they know them.  Rule of thumb 
was that if I had to add a month, I refreshed the rate but left volume at 
zero.  If the months were already on the ticket, then I refreshed the rate 
and left the volume as is.

I would advise that your schedulers check volumes on all pipes to ensure 
they're reflected in Position Manager correctly.  Please let me know if you 
have any questions.  All pipes will be updated by tomorrow morning.

Heidi

Dave,

Please have Steve remove the meters in the following list from the estimate 
file.  These were accounting meters set up to represent the offsetting 
physical meters.  The physical meters should still receive estimates.

If you have any questions please call.

Gary,

Could you please remove  SCADA/MIPS from the following HPL meters. These 
meters are where Mid-Texas interconnects with
PG & E's system, and there should not be any measurement taking place on HPL. 
These meters were set up originally when we thought
that every meter on Mid-Texas should automatically have a corresponding meter 
on HPL. This assumption is now incorecct.

Can someone in your dept. please reverify and determine if these volumes are 
correct for June and August 2000.   HPL did not have any deals for these 
volume deliveries for either sales or transportation.

Aimee,

There is a feedback error on swing meter 981595, deal number 151203 for 
January 2000.  POPS and MOPS systems match, however in checking in Sitara, 
the deal number attached expired 12/31/99.  

I am not sure you are the correct person to address this with, if not, please 
let me know.  If you can fix this problem, please do so and let me know.

Thanks and let me know if you need any addtional data as well.

We need to revisit this issue again.   There is an exception at meter 4045 
for 2/99.   In order to clear this up, I need an ECT transport delivery at 
this meter for the 34000mmbtu.   See July's allocations in POPS for 
reference.    The displacement gas were scheduled as a delivery. 

I would like to have this issue resolved as soon as possible so that we 
could  clear this off our list.

Let me know if you have questions.

Thanks

Kim,

ECT sold 34,000mmbtu to PanEnergy at meter 4045 for 2/99.   I've verified w/ 
Rebekah Seales and she has determined that ECT did sell this gas to 
PanEnergy.  Therefore, we need to show a delivery at this meter for PanEnergy 
or whomever PanEnergy is selling this gas to at this point in POPS.  I need a 
delivery at this meter in order for this meter to balanced.  

Please take a look at this.  Call me if you have questions

Thanks.

Anita:

I did some additional research regarding the sale to PanEnergy at meter 4045 
on 2/27 and 2/28.  This sale was a brokered deal.



DATE   PURCHASE   VOLUME  SALE
2/27 & 2/28  Phillips Gas Mkt. (#55397)  10.000 MMBtu  PanEnergy Marketing 
(#64749) 10.000 MMBtu
2/27 & 2/28  Superior Natural Gas (#57065)   7.000 MMBtu  PanEnergy Marketing 
(#64749)   7.000 MMBtu

ECT did not transport this gas away from meter 4045.  If this gas was 
transported away from meter 4045, it would have been a transaction between 
PanEnergy Marketing (or whomever they sold the gas to at that point) and 
HPL.  Hope this information helps.

Additional info I see in Path Manager..................

Seems like this is a brokered deal, ECT is buying 20,000mmbtu from Philips 
Gas and 14,000mmbtu from Superior Gas and sell the total 34,000mmbtu to 
PanEnergy.

My question is then who is paying for the tranport of this gas, ECT or 
PanEnergy?  We need to schedule for the delivery of this gas at meter 984045.

Please let me know

Thanks

The Cilco volumes are different than the confirmed volumes to Cilco.  Please 
review the attached the spreadsheets from Lisa Kinsey, the central desk 
scheduler responsible for the Cilco account.  The biggest variance is in 
January 2000.  Cilco withdrew 200,000 mmbtu's more than we booked @ bammel.  
Please let me know the best way to correct the problem.  I suspect the 
variance is showing up as a transport imbalance.  Also, the nomination for 
the current month is 7,327 mmbtu instead of 7,000 mmbtu per day.  7,000 is 
the volume delivered to Cilco after transport fuel.

I received a call from CP&L about the February 2001 production invoice.  They 
are showing 5,000 mmbtu on February 21 for HPL.  We are not showing anything 
for HPL on that day.  Could you verify if this is correct?

Thanks for your help.

Since Lisa used fuchsia, I'll use lavender..

On # 1 I would eliminate that processing. In addition, can we delete/hide/n=
ot access old paths that haven't been used in gas production in lets say a =
year or so. Would this help performance?  This would also force the schedul=
ers to path/think about the way they are pathing their transactions and not=
 rely on old paths that may no longer be accurate!! We've seen old bad, zer=
o paths be re-used accidentally.
On # 2, The scheduling position window IS the weakest link.....GOODBYE!
On # 3, Contract Reference I know is used alot in the supply and market lis=
t. Nomlogic is also slated to use these contract reference fields for comme=
nts. Do we need it in the inventory list?  Probably not as much as the supp=
ly and market list but I still believe it's necessary for pools and imbalan=
ce accounts.=20
On # 4, We use this functionality alot on CGAS, TENN, TRCO and SAB...When w=
e path one to many or many to one in "chunks," it does seem to go faster th=
an one path at a time.
On # 5,  Brokered paths could really just be slammed in there. No need for =
the extra processing that occurs for service contracts .

Importance:=09High

All:

We're currently identifying processes that are inefficient and could possib=
ly benefit from being rewritten or not even performed.  Going foward, I wou=
ld like Bob to appoint a lead business person to whom we could ask question=
s and or suggest ideas to so that they could in turn validate this informat=
ion with the desk managers/schedulers.  We had this approach with Nomlogic =
and having Clarissa work the issues worked quite nicely.  Who ever you choo=
se, we would need about 15% of their time for now.  Later on, with coordina=
tion efforts and testing, it may go up to 75%.  I don't see that happening =
for a while though.

The sooner we get someone to devote to this, the better off we will be.  I =
expect these changes that we'll be looking into should improve performance =
quite a bit. =20

That being said, we've identified three items that would speed up processin=
g the retrieval of Path Manager. =20

1)  Currently, the Path Manager attempts to reuse Path Ids.  I can't think =
of any reason why we need to perform this extra step?    It runs through th=
is processing on the application and generally doesn't find a match.  I kno=
w Patti has mentioned this several times and I can't think of a valid reaso=
n for performing this work.  I talked with Dave Nommensen, and according to=
 him, what used to happen is that sometimes schedulers would get duplicate =
paths out there which is why they put this code in place???  From a schedul=
ing perspective, my understanding of what your main concern is to just main=
tain your position and be able to change it.  If you were overpathed, you'd=
 see it in the Path Manager either way. [Pinion, Richard]    To restate the=
 question for clarity, in path manager a scheduler pulls down a supply, mar=
ket and a service, adds any up/downstream contract information and/or Duns =
or DRN override and then saves it.  Unify looks for an old path with those =
exact variables and if it finds it re-uses it and if it does not find an ex=
act match creates a new path and path id.  I had been told that to do away =
with this function would create an unacceptably high amount of paths since =
any path once nominated on could not be deleted.  Has this changed???  At o=
ne time there were some schedulers that looked for the same path / activity=
 number match for nominations.  Texas Eastern was the only pipeline that ne=
eded the old activity numbers no matter how long it had been since they wer=
e used.  I spoke with Chris Ordway and the new LINK system no longer needs =
this to occur.  Transco uses activity numbers but uses the Activity number =
cross reference table to that function and therefore should not be affected=
.  Therefore, if it does not create a space or memory problem for Unify, I =
don't think that this constant old path look up is needed.   [Kinsey, Lisa]=
   Get rid of this. =20

2)  The scheduling position window:  does anyone use this?  If not, we'll r=
emove the code logic that populates this window.  I have never seen a sched=
uler use this.  Please verify. [Pinion, Richard]   Originally such a window=
 was in use by everyone in the legacy system "Autonoms" so it was duplicate=
d in Unify by request.  It is not used in Unify now because of the other so=
phisticated tools Unify provides which obviate it's use.  The only value wo=
uld be notification of bridge errors or contract imbalances but there are o=
ther ways to determine those problems.  As voted on in a previous meeting o=
f the managers - Lose it!  [Kinsey, Lisa]  Why is this still here?=09=20

3)  On the inventory pool list, does anyone need to see the Contarct Refere=
nces List?  Again, this code is called every retrieval time and doesn't app=
ear to be used from my observations.   If they do need this information, we=
 could provide it, but if not, I'd prefer to remove the functionality. [Pin=
ion, Richard]    This function is still very much in use by those with poin=
t based pipelines that must use the imbalance pool to facilitate balancing =
nomination volumes where multiple pipeline external pools exist and are pat=
hed through the same contract imbalance pool.  Keep it!  [Kinsey, Lisa]  Ye=
s.  We use this functionality a lot when pathing pools.=09=20

4)  When pathing a one to many or many to one set of paths, what's the aver=
age number of paths they create at one time?  What about updates?  I know t=
hat ANR and NIGAS are big users of this feature since they have small packa=
ges of gas that they are limited in size to.  Does the system seem faster w=
hen you update one record at a time or chunks of records?  My real question=
 is how often they do this and for what number of paths on both Updates and=
 Inserts.  By update, I mean, going to the path list and changing an upstre=
am / downstream contract or a PSNA which in turn forces a new path to be cr=
eated. [Pinion, Richard]    This one to many or many to one pathing goes on=
 every day on every pipeline.  There is no 'average'.  They typically updat=
e a path with up/downstream meters or duns or dnb numbers one at a time how=
ever.  I hope this answers your question.  I see no change to this process =
at this time  [Kinsey, Lisa]  On some pipes this function is used more than=
 others.  When it is used we try and do as many paths as possible.  At this=
 time I do not see a need to change this process. =09=20

5)  On brokered paths, do you want to utilize the same logic we have for Se=
rvice?  In other words, when updating Brokered arrangements, we don't incor=
porate the same logic for zeroing out the path and recreating a new arrangm=
ent link and hence sending it to be renominated?  Why do we do this for ser=
vice?  Is it because we have to renominate it?  I assume that's what it's f=
or since we don't send brokered paths to the pipe.  Anyway, with the Nomlog=
ic implmentation (two way interface), we were planning on having it behave =
the same way as service.  We need this verified. [Pinion, Richard]    We do=
n't perform the same logic for Brokered paths because these are not nominat=
ed to the pipeline and hence do not need a zero path to be resent to the pi=
peline when a significant change is made to the already nominated path.  I =
don't see a need to change the way Brokered paths are behaving at this time=
. [Kinsey, Lisa]  Agree with Richard.=09=20

Linda-

I did not know that this was part of a Natural Gas / Crude Oil exchange deal 
and billed Texas General Land Office for the gas sale  in Jan. 01

Do you have a Crude Oil payable to offset this sales invoice?
If so, will this A/R balance of $ 974,144.00 be netted against the Crude Oil 
Payable in SAP?

Please let me know, I would like to take care of the net in SAP ASAP.

Thanks- Katherine

The Crow O'Connor, meter 6757 has its gas allocated to Strangers Gas for 
April and May 1999 and Duke has been calling Settlements asking for their 
money.  I will need to set up accounting arrangements for this meter for 
these months so please provide me the correct transportation contract and

In addition, the Sarco Lateral, meter 5192 has its gas allocated to Strangers

I have created the new deals reflecting the Mid-Texas meters for the 
following deals beginning in January 2000:

ETOCO:   from HPL meter 393  to Mid-Texas meter 9738 
old sitara deal   = 133435
new sitara deal = 163874

Richardson:  from HPL meter 7283 to Mid-Texas meter 9807
old sitara deal   = 141691
new sitara deal = 164003

Mueller:  from HPL meter 7260 to Mid-Texas meter 9769
old sitara deal   =  156247 Feb. 2000 through June 2000
old sitara deal   =  143885 Jan. 2000 only
old sitara deal   =  143887 Jan. 2000 only
new sitara deal  = 164172 


Please take a look at the deals and let me know if I have doubled volumes, or 
if there is anything else I need to do to make things work better...

I think everyone agrees that there was a lot of confusion in Desk assignments 
and responsibilities.  With that said, I am listing some of the current 
issues that I have seen, that will need to be addressed quickly.  Most of 
these issues are none of my business, but since I see unpathed gas I thought 
you two might want to dicsuss these issues.

Enron Field Services   -  Has not been nominated since September 99.  Have we 
stopped doing business on this pipe?  (Just an FYI - ?)  Do we need to get 
this assigned?  I can find old
   notes and try to get this pathed if necessary.  Someone just needs to let 
me know.

Lavaca Expense Transport -  This is offsystem gas that HPLC Transports for 
ENA.  ENA has no nom at meter 1000 in Pops for Jan 1.

MidCon Texas Pipeline   -  There were deals left unpathed for Jan 1 (and 
Dec?).  I brokered and nominated the obvious but we seem to have 10,000 with 
transport contract to move this    gas on and no sale to broker to.  As it 
stands, it looks like we have a long position.  Who is this assigned to?  I 
thought Carlos was handling this one, but I could    be wrong.

Channel Industries Pipeline  -  Several issues here:

 1. All Deals with the exception of the long term Transport Expense were left 
unpathed for Jan 1.  I viewed prior month transactions and pathed 
appropriately.  Someone
  needs to review for accuracy. Also, there were deals that went to zero, 
that were nominated for January.

 2. We still do not have enough supply to meet our sales requirement.  This 
issue has been left unsresolved since October 99.  Volume Management cannot 
allocate was is
  not pathed and nominated.  

 3. There is a transaction for January that is once again not on our point 
specific transport contracts.  (Rec Mtr 1-6366 10,000 to Del Mtr 2-6203 
10,000).  This is a pathed    pipeline. We have no rate.  We need to know the 
rate and whether one of the expense contracts needs to be amended for this 
transaction, we are not legally covered.    Carlos was handling this pipe in 
Dec.  Who is this assigned to for Jan?

HPL Operational -  This Shipper on HPL has been left unpathed for December 
and January 1.  Who is this assigned to?  This can wait until we get back 
next week.  If it is left     unresolved, I will get it pathed when I return.



Pat  -   The following  was my recollection of the assignments for Dec 1 to 
the present.  You might want to confirm with Mary Smith and then you can 
proceed with decisions that need to be made based on possible unassigned 
issues.

Hank Eisenhours duties were split :

Mandey -   Handle all long term HPLC expense issues:  undeveloped contracts, 
December flow forward and cleanup of 1999 unresolved issues.

Carlos  -  All offsystem transactions for ENA and HPLC in Unify and all 
offsystem paper and electronic noms on Intrastate Pipes.  Ami and Stacey
  also handle some.  There is a lot of confusion here.  I found unpathed gas 
for December.  We'll need to address this one quickly.

HPL Transports were all split by zone.  Each Logistics rep is responsible for 
pathing all meters in their assigned zones in Unify.

HPL Operational seems to be left unassigned. 

I think most of the desk assumed that Carlos took over Hanks 
responsibilities.  The assignments above are my recollection only.

Our people tell me that the T/A is going as planned and CLMP plans to begin
start up on Sunday. Since it is a cold startup, it could take as long as a
week to get to full rates. In any event, CLMP plans to begin pulling gas at
reduced rates late Sunday or so.

Daren,

We are not receiving timely information from the Hub regarding our Park and=
 Lend Agreement.  I have not received an update since Tues or Wed of last w=
eek.   Mike has been phoning them furiously for information and has been to=
ld that they don't have it, or it will be ready later.  Per GISB, final sch=
eduled numbers on EPNG, NNG, and TW are reported at 9:00 am the following d=
ay (ie. Sunday final will be out at 9 AM on Mon.).  Prior to the transition=
 from PG&E, we received our balance by 9:15 or 9:30 AM.  I realize that the=
 transition has been difficult, they are never a cake walk, however, this t=
ype of information is crucial.  Further, they have not provided any final n=
umbers for the month of April, we should at least be able to receive a "bes=
t available" number, and the Interstate Pipes, due to GISB, have final sche=
duled numbers available on the first of the month.  I submit that ENA shoul=
d not be held liable for payment of the $0.03/day rate, as we have not rece=
ived the information we need to balance the agreement.  If EPGT plans to ad=
minister fees, then balance information should be communicated on a timely =
basis.  We may want to check the terms of the agreement, and/or negotiate a=
 reduced rate for the month of May.

Thank you,

Mary

Hi Mark!

Another interconnect issue - 7/99:

Can you please take a look at deal 109660?  It is set up with a transport 
usage ticket, however is a brokered deal.  I am not sure if it is pathed 
incorrectly or if possibly the deal is set up incorrectly.  

Let me know your thoughts.

Karen

Heidi-  There should be a deal ticket in Sitara for this sale to Engage, but 
it looks as though 12/99 was the last month a deal was entered 
(IF/HSC+1.00).  George/Craig- could you guys coordinate who should be rolling 
this deal or let us know if this gas should not be flowing?  Heidi-  
historically we've been charging $.60/mm for this transport.

I am finding flow out there on HPL 215 for meter 1520 (Tx City Coastal 
States) starting 4/1/00 (actually, no volume was scheduled but looks like it 
has been allocated since March 1).  Did you want a premium rate for this?

Janet- 

Per Southern Union's confirmation sheet, the 15,000 mmbtus spot deal on days 03/25 & 3/26 should be priced at  HSC GDP DA +.05 ( at Tuesday, 3/27/01 pricing- which was $ 5.235). Currently, Sitara is showing a price of  HSC GDP +.05.

 Is this Tuesday pricing correct?  If so, pls forward this to Daren so that he can change the price in Sitara to $ 5.235 +.05 ( Totaling $5.285).


Thanks- Katherine

Buddy - Daren Farmer called and said that on 4/30/2001, on HPL deal #108058, that there was around 20,000 MMBTU scheduled, but when it was actualized, it was actualized at 0.  He thinks this is incorrect.  Can you check into this and get back with Daren?  I'll be out of the office tomorrow, so please get back with him directly.  Thanks.

Duke is calling regarding the volumes we are delivering into Channel at the 
Gulf Plains Plant.  Apparently, we are half of the volumes delivered at the 
meter and Channel is pressuring the plant back.  Duke has asked if we will 
take the additional gas which is "undeliverable",  I think we may need to 
move our markets to another meter, ie. HPL/Agua.  Please advise.

I have reallocated the above referenced meter, per Daren and Clem's 
instructions.  All of the gas is on the MJG deal, as the ticket was valid 
through October, 2000.  Please call Clem if you have any questions.

Kyle and Greg this issue is still unresolved as well as a 6,000 variance on 
contract 5098-695.   I have provided Stacey with the daily allocation from 
PG&E Texas.   On Friday she told me she did have an answer yet, and she could 
not give me a time frame of when she would be able to get to it.   She said 
we have to understand their staff is short, and if anyone has any questions 
to call her or Daren direct.  At this time I still do not have an answer, but 
will let you know as soon as I do.

The actuals on this contract did not come in as scheduled.   The scheduled 
deliveries at Texoma are 374,503, but the actuals are 352,568.  At Teco Waha 
delivery you have 359,120 scheduled, but the actuals are 368,115.   I don't 
know what numbers you confirmed with PG&E Texas, so can you let me know first 
if you agree with PG&E Texas numbers and if you do, will you please make the 
necessary changes in unify.

Thanks.

Daren:

During the months of October 1999 and November 1999, gas flowed into HPL's 
pipeline at the above meter.    This gas was previously transported by EOG 
Resources  to Mobil (Beaumont) with the excess being purchased.   The Deal 
that EOG Resources Transport Contract (012-36702-02-001) moved gas to Mobil 
Beaumont expired a the end of September, 1999, but gas continued to flow into 
HPL's pipeline.  Currently, these volumes are being recorded to the HPL 
Strangers Gas Contract.   Logistics needs a deal to purchase these volumes.

Is this Enerfin gas we delivered?  What are the deal numbers in Sitara and 
how much volume are we talking about?
Darren, Isn't there an OBA set up in Enerfin that can handle small volumes?  
THANKS

Victor,

What's your opinion on this?  Can we go back and add days to prior month 
deals?  Do we use the same price?  If we do decide to do this, we will need 
to get TETCO to agree to do a retro for those days as well.

Subject: 10/2000 - Days 6 and 19 (98-0439)

The above referenced days have been placed on strangers gas due to (I guess) 
the meter not being turned off in time.  The day prior to each of these days 
that are assessed to strangers gas, the only active K is the HPL 216.

Can these deals be rolled to cover these couple of days?

Thanks
