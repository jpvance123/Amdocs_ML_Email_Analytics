Sounds pretty harmless to me.  If you don't want to do it, let me know and I'll play the bad cop.

Carly Fiorina Tops FORTUNE's List of 50 Most Powerful Women in Business
for Fourth Year

10/01/2001
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)

  NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 1, 2001--
  

  Lower-Profile Women Topple More Well-known Names From Tech and
  Internet Sector; Ranking Includes 14 Newcomers
  

  Though Hewlett-Packard lost $75 billion in market value in a year, CEO Carly
Fiorina hasn't lost her nerve, and for the fourth consecutive year holds the
No. 1 position on FORTUNE's ranking of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business.

  The complete list and accompanying stories are in the October 15 issue of
FORTUNE, available on newsstands October 8 and at www.fortune.com at 12:00
p.m. on October 1.  

  In the No. 2 spot is eBay CEO Meg Whitman, who runs an Internet company that
actually makes money: $85 million in the last four quarters on $582 million in
revenue. Oprah Winfrey, the Queen of Media, is mightier than ever, and holds
the No. 3 spot, up from No. 15 last year. She produces movies, brings comfort
and advice to millions of TV viewers, propels books to bestsellerdom, and,
last year, teamed up with Hearst Magazines' Cathie Black (No. 28 on the list)
to publish O, The Oprah Magazine-by some measures the most successful magazine
startup ever. At No. 4 is Andrea Jung, Chairman and CEO of Avon, who has
breathed life into ailing Avon. Mirant CEO Marce Fuller-the only newcomer in
the top five-holds the No. 5 position. Inside a stodgy utility, Southern,
Fuller built a high-growth trading and marketing unit, which was spun off in
April.  

  In these new, more tempered times, patience may be about to reap its reward.
In FORTUNE's annual survey of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business, there is
a clear emergence of women who came to power slowly. Says FORTUNE senior
writer Pattie Sellers in "Patient But Not Passive," the story that accompanies
the list, "By patience, we mean staying with a company, steadily building
influence there, and rising to power through determination and insider
knowledge, not promises and self-promotion."  

  Fiorina, who has claimed the top spot each year since FORTUNE's inaugural
list in 1998, heads the biggest company ($48 billion in revenues last year)
run by a woman. And she is still as audacious and impatient as ever. Wall
Street practically heckled her latest move-a bold bet to buy Compaq-but
Fiorina, 47, remains defiant. In difficult times, "people who drive change are
the subject of great scrutiny," she says.  

  As always, the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time. Last year,
power resided in the technology and Internet sectors, but that influence was
fleeting. Gone from the list this year: Deborah "Hurricane Debby" Hopkins, who
pushed her agenda too ambitiously at Lucent and lost her CFO job in May; Ellen
Hancock, who failed at her startup, Exodus; and Morgan Stanley's Mary Meeker,
who influenced so many to buy into the Internet fizz. But one Web warrior
looks better than ever: Meg Whitman, No. 2 on the list. She has never
overpromised to investors; instead she has diligently delivered above-target
profits every single quarter.  

  Fourteen newcomers join the list this year: Marce Fuller, President & CEO,
Mirant; Louise Kitchen, COO, Enron Americas; Colleen Barrett, President & COO,
Southwest Airlines; Betsy Bernard, President & CEO, AT&T Consumer; Anne
Stevens, VP, North America Vehicle Operations, Ford Motor; Maria Elena
Lagomasino, Chairman & CEO, J. P. Morgan Private Bank; Susan Desmond-Hellman,
EVP and Chief Medical Officer, Genentech; Janet Robinson, SVP, Newspaper
Operations, New York Times Co.; Carol Tomi, EVP and CFO, Home Depot; Carrie
Cox, EVP and President, Global Prescriptions, Pharmacia; Carole Black,
President and CEO, Lifetime Television Networks; Larree Renda, EVP, Retail
Operations, Safeway; and Louise Francesconi, VP and GM, Missile Systems,
Raytheon.  

  While the economy and its points of power change, the criteria we use to
evaluate power remains the same. Says Sellers: "We consider the size and
importance of a woman's business in the global economy, her clout inside her
company, and the arc of her career-where she has been and where she is likely
to go. When appropriate, we also weigh the woman's influence on mass culture
and society. That factor lifts Oprah Winfrey to No. 3 on this year's list."
The shifts on our list this year are dramatic, with 14 newcomers. But one
trend is especially intriguing: Women are taking on bigger businesses than
ever. A few years ago, responsibility for a $3 billion business almost
automatically earned a woman a spot on this list. No more. This year's FORTUNE
50 includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of $20
billion or more, which is a first.  

  In a related story, "It Took a Lady To Save Avon," Katrina Brooker looks at
Andrea Jung, Chairman and CEO of Avon. Says Brooker, "Jung knows what women
want and how to sell it to them. And that's what has made her one of the most
successful CEOs-male or female-in recent years." Over the past 20 months she
has overhauled nearly everything about the way Avon does business: how it
advertises, manufactures, packages, and even sells its products, and she has
done it not by abandoning the seemingly outdated Avon Lady, but by reviving
her. The result: growth in revenues, operating profits, and operating margins.

  In addition, FORTUNE includes an international list of the 50 powerful women
in business. The top ten, featured in the magazine, are Marjorie Scardino,
CEO, Pearson (Britain); Anne Lauvergeon, Chairman, Areva (France); Mary Ma,
Senior VP & CFO, Legend (Hong Kong); Marianne Nivert, President & CEO, Telia
(Sweden); Lien Siaou-Sze, Vice President, Hewlett-Packard (Hong Kong);
Patricia Barbizet, CEO, Artemis (France); Eiko Kono, President, Recruit
(Japan): Belinda Stronach, CEO, Magna International (Canada); Marina
Berlusconi, Vice Chairman, Fininvest (Italy); Christine Tsung, President &
CEO, China Airlines (Taiwan). You can read about the other forty at
www.fortune.com or in the international editions of FORTUNE.

UK:
LME turnovers fall, long-established trend halted.

07/03/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, July 3 (Reuters) - First-half volumes on the London Metal Exchange
(LME) fell nearly 16 percent from year-ago levels amid signs that years of
rising turnover on the world's largest non-ferrous metals market may be coming
to an end.

Traders said this year had seen volumes affected by the general downturn in
global economies, weakening prices and the knock-on impact of electronic
screen trading.
"The problem is the general conditions that are prevailing at the moment - we
are seeing recessionary signs that are dampening the market. It is cyclical,
and that is the worry because the cycle is lasting some time," one said.

Figures released on Tuesday by the LME showed that total futures and options
turnover during Jan/June 2001 fell to 29.899 million lots, down from a
Jan/June 2000 level of 35.440 million.

Traded options turnovers were significantly lower, falling to 1.481 million
lots from 2.784 million as reduced volatility deterred options interest.

Although the LME derives much of its liquidity from speculators, the bulk of
its trade comes from the metals industry - hedging and price protection.

"There is consumer and producer business around, but they are very selective
at the moment," another trader said.

Whether the trend continued throughout the year amd marked a sea-change after
some 10 years of almost uninterrupted volume growth may depend on market
conditions improving.

Most of this year has seen prices progressively weaker, with copper recently
at its lowest since July 1999, zinc and tin at levels last seen nearly eight
years ago, lead at a 12-month low-point and nickel and aluminium at two-month
lows.

Although prices have been softer, there have been occasions when tightness has
prevailed in some markets, lifting spot premiums, but these do not generate
trades.

"These squeezes that have taken place this year in copper, aluminium and tin
in particular have not helped," the second trader said.

When the market moves from contango, when nearby prices are cheaper than
forward, into backwardation, which is the opposite, hedging dries up.

The last year has also seen electronic trading take off, with competitors such
as Enron Online and Spectron Metals grabbing business. The LME has also
sanctioned and launched its own system - known as LME Select.

These still trade LME contracts, so the turnovers are not directly hit, but
screen-trading itself may be a factor.

"In some ways the screens, whoever they belong to, may be the problem," one
said.

"In the old days, you used to talk to people more, get a feel for the market,
and take a punt. Not so much now - the big boys still chat, but not as much,
and with the screens it is almost a 'matched bargain' situation," he said.

Kal, Please provide David with as many statistics as he needs for his book.
Could you also make sure that David gets help in turning around any
comments on any quotes etc he may want to use for his book as I understand
they have some pretty short timescales.

I have attached a couple of recent presentations and the old presentation
from the analyst conference in January.
(See attached file: extendedEOL.ppt)



Thanks

Louise

Louise - first congratulations on your new boy Scott - Marcus has been keeping me posted and I even saw those great photos on his desk.  I don't think we have met; I work for EPMI in NEPOOL with John Llodra and report to Ed Baughman.  

I am writing to ask if you would speak with my brother-in-law, Dave Gautschi, a partner with Deloitte & Touche, who is co-authoring a book on e-businesses called Net Markets (see attached outline and reproduction of the cover).  The focus of the book is to " ?? take a business executives perspective on the implications of B2B eMarketplaces on their business and overall business environment globally.  It will lead the reader through the basic options for implementing real valuable B2B tools and technologies.  It will then move to more and more complex AND valuable B2B opportunities.  More importantly, it will identify and articulate the day-to-day business IMPLICATIONS of Ebusiness."

Dave, a PhD in mathematics (go figure), a former marketing professor, a folk singer (he leads our family in song fests) and just a great guy is intrigued/impressed with Enron on Line (who isn't) and would very much like your insights.  I believe the exposure to both Deloitte and the readers of this book would be great for Enron in general and Enron On Line specifically.

If you are available please call his research assistant Mike Russell at 206-215-4285 to arrange a time to talk (they will be very responsive as their manuscript deadline is late July).  I am reachable today on my cell at 617-733-8713 and on vacation next week but Claudette Harvey will know where to reach me.

Thanks for your consideration and enjoy your new young one (kids are great, I have two)

George "Woody" Wood

POWER POINTS: Skilling Moves On To Charities, Family
By Mark Golden

08/24/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

  NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Jeff Skilling will be spending the next few years
working with charities in Houston and spending time with family, the former
chief executive of Enron Corp. (ENE) said in an interview.   

  The 47-year-old Skilling, who resigned abruptly from Enron after the
company's board meeting Aug. 14, repeatedly said he had left - as stated - for
personal reasons. Wall Street has been skeptical of the explanation, and
several analysts have said they're waiting for "the other shoe to drop." The
company's stock price fell 14% in response to the announcement last week - a
loss of about $4.5 billion in shareholder value - and hasn't recovered this
week.
  But the former chief executive said the stock price will recover once
investors see that his departure isn't a precursor to more bad news for the
company.   

  "I've spent the last 34 years working really hard," said Skilling, who
requested the interview with Dow Jones Newswires. "There are a lot of things
that I haven't been doing - personal interests, spending time with family.
There are a number of charitable things that I haven't spent the time on that
I believe I should. I don't mean fundraising, but hands on, getting out and
doing things, building houses, helping individuals."   

  Skilling, who has been involved with a multiple sclerosis charity for years,
said he plans to get involved in promoting the City of Houston.   

  "It's massively underrated as a place to work and live," he said. "It's a
great city, and I think I can do a lot to get that across."   

  Though insistent that there is nothing more to his departure than personal
reasons, Skilling said little to reveal why a talented executive would
surrender the top spot of the country's largest energy trading company just
six months after taking the job. Skilling had been Enron's No. 2 executive
from 1997 until this year, and he's generally credited with the success of
Enron's wholesale trading operations, which comprise about 80% of the parent's
earnings.   

  He confirmed there's no crisis in his family, and his health is fine.
Skilling, who assumed the chief executive title on Feb. 12, also denied that
he was suffering under the strain of the job.   

  Late last week, Chairman Kenneth Lay and other Enron executives in New York
told Wall Street analysts that Skilling had been going "kind of nuts" under
the pressure of being chief executive, one analyst said.   

  "It's not true that I was cracking up," he said. "Do I sound like someone
who is cracking up? The representation of me as thick-skinned is a reasonable
representation."   

  When asked if his departure could have been handled more smoothly so as not
to alarm investors, Skilling said that perhaps the mechanics could have been
better, but said that is hindsight.   

  "We thought it through and thought we were going about it in the right way,"
he said. "I don't know what we could have done differently. It will turn out,
in retrospect, fine, as soon as people see that there's nothing else." 
 
   About One Week's Notice 
   

  The former chief executive totally disagreed with speculation in this column
last week that Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay, who immediately resumed the role of
chief executive, may have wanted to regain day-to-day control of the company
and pushed Skilling out.   

  "I think the world of Ken. You can't find a bigger fan of his than me," he
said. "I was not forced out. Personal and family reasons are 100% of the
story. I guess it's kind of mundane, and I'm sorry it doesn't have as much
drama and suspense as a lot of people would like it to have, but that's what
the deal is."   

  Skilling said he spoke with Lay about wanting to do other things many times
over the years. The first serious discussion of his imminent departure came
about a week before the announcement, said Skilling, whose recollection of his
giving notice to Lay was somewhat cloudy.   

  "The board knew what was going on, and that was the point (the Aug. 14 board
meeting) where the decisions were going to be made," he said.   

  The decisions?   

  "I guess to accept my resignation," Skilling said.   

  Enron refused to release a copy of the minutes of the Aug. 14 board meeting,
which was regularly scheduled. The company doesn't generally release
board-meeting minutes, spokeswoman Karen Denne said.   

  The former chief executive continues to work as a paid adviser to Enron. A
clause in his contract prevents him from competing with the company through
the end of 2003, and he has no plans to work outside the energy industry.   

  That might sound like a big comedown from running the country's most
aggressive energy company, but Skilling said the move fits.   

  "Some people say 'Well, you were working and aspiring so long to become CEO
of Enron.' That's not true. I was working to build a business, and we did,"
said Skilling, who is credited with transforming the company into a trading
powerhouse.   

  "The company I built is doing great. My life is moving on."   

  He also said the company will do fine without him. Some analysts have
expressed concern about Enron's ability to retain its top talent. Skilling's
predecessor as Enron's No. 2 executive, Richard Kinder, for example, left the
company in 1996 after Lay announced that he would be retaining the chief
executive spot for another five years. Kinder went on to buy Enron's small
liquids pipeline business and turned that company into Kinder-Morgan Inc.
(KMI).   

  Enron's current management, Skilling said, has a "very deep bench." For
example, he described Enron Energy Services Chief Executive Dave Delaney as
"awesome."   

  "Dave created the Canadian business in Enron," Skilling said.

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 1, 2001-- 

Lower-Profile Women Topple More Well-known Names From Tech and
Internet Sector; Ranking Includes 14 Newcomers 

Though Hewlett-Packard lost $65 billion in market value in a year, CEO Carly Fiorina hasn't lost her nerve, and for the fourth consecutive year holds the No. 1 position on FORTUNE's ranking of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business. 
The complete list and accompanying stories are in the October 15 issue of FORTUNE, available on newsstands October 8 and at www.fortune.com at 12:00 p.m. on October 1. 
In the No. 2 spot is eBay CEO Meg Whitman, who runs an Internet company that actually makes money: $85 million in the last four quarters on $582 million in revenue. Oprah Winfrey, the Queen of Media, is mightier than ever, and holds the No. 3 spot, up from No. 15 last year. She produces movies, brings comfort and advice to millions of TV viewers, propels books to bestsellerdom, and, last year, teamed up with Hearst Magazines' Cathie Black (No. 28 on the list) to publish O, The Oprah Magazine-by some measures the most successful magazine startup ever. At No. 4 is Andrea Jung, Chairman and CEO of Avon, who has breathed life into ailing Avon. Mirant CEO Marce Fuller-the only newcomer in the top five-holds the No. 5 position. Inside a stodgy utility, Southern, Fuller built a high-growth trading and marketing unit, which was spun off in April. 
In these new, more tempered times, patience may be about to reap its reward. In FORTUNE's annual survey of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business, there is a clear emergence of women who came to power slowly. Says FORTUNE senior writer Pattie Sellers in "Patient But Not Passive," the story that accompanies the list, "By patience, we mean staying with a company, steadily building influence there, and rising to power through determination and insider knowledge, not promises and self-promotion." 
Fiorina, who has claimed the top spot each year since FORTUNE's inaugural list in 1998, heads the biggest company ($48 billion in revenues last year) run by a woman. And she is still as audacious and impatient as ever. Wall Street practically heckled her latest move-a bold bet to buy Compaq-but Fiorina, 47, remains defiant. In difficult times, "people who drive change are the subject of great scrutiny," she says. 
As always, the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time. Last year, power resided in the technology and Internet sectors, but that influence was fleeting. Gone from the list this year: Deborah "Hurricane Debby" Hopkins, who pushed her agenda too ambitiously at Lucent and lost her CFO job in May; Ellen Hancock, who failed at the startup, Exodus; and Morgan Stanley's Mary Meeker, who influenced so many to buy into the Internet fizz. But one Web warrior looks better than ever: Meg Whitman, No. 2 on the list. She has never overpromised to investors; instead she has diligently delivered above-target profits every single quarter. 
Fourteen newcomers join the list this year: Marce Fuller, President & CEO, Mirant; Louise Kitchen, COO, Enron Americas; Colleen Barrett, President & COO, Southwest Airlines; Betsy Bernard, President & CEO, AT&T Consumer; Anne Stevens, VP, North America Vehicle Operations, Ford Motor; Maria Elena Lagomasino, Chairman & CEO, J. P. Morgan Private Bank; Susan Desmond-Hellman, EVP and Chief Medical Officer, Genentech; Janet Robinson, SVP, Newspaper Operations, New York Times Co.; Carol Tomi, EVP and CFO, Home Depot; Carrie Cox, EVP and President, Global Prescriptions, Pharmacia; Carole Black, President and CEO, Lifetime Television Networks; Janet Davidson, Group President, Integrated Network Solutions, Lucent; Larree Renda, EVP, Retail Operations, Safeway; and Louise Francesconi, VP and GM, Missile Systems, Raytheon. 
While the economy and its points of power change, the criteria we use to evaluate power remains the same. Says Sellers: "We consider the size and importance of a woman's business in the global economy, her clout inside her company, and the arc of her career-where she has been and where she is likely to go. When appropriate, we also weigh the woman's influence on mass culture and society. That factor lifts Oprah Winfrey to No. 3 on this year's list." The shifts on our list this year are dramatic, with 14 newcomers. But one trend is especially intriguing: Women are taking on bigger businesses than ever. A few years ago, responsibility for a $3 billion business almost automatically earned a woman a spot on this list. No more. This year's FORTUNE 50 includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of $20 billion or more, which is a first. 
In a related story, "It Took a Lady To Save Avon," Katrina Brooker looks at Andrea Jung, Chairman and CEO of Avon. Says Brooker, "Jung knows what women want and how to sell it to them. And that's what has made her one of the most successful CEOs-male or female-in recent years." Over the past 20 months she has overhauled nearly everything about the way Avon does business: how it advertises, manufactures, packages, and even sells its products, and she has done it not by abandoning the seemingly outdated Avon Lady, but by reviving her. The result: growth in revenues, operating profits, and operating margins. 
In addition, FORTUNE includes an international list of the 50 powerful women in business. The top ten, featured in the magazine, are Marjorie Scardino, CEO, Pearson (Britain); Anne Lauvergeon, Chairman, Areva (France); Mary Ma, Senior VP & CFO, Legend (Hong Kong); Marianne Nivert, President & CEO, Telia (Sweden); Lien Siaou-Sze, Vice President, Hewlett-Packard (Hong Kong); Patricia Barbizet, CEO, Artemis (France); Eiko Kono, President, Recruit (Japan): Belinda Stronach, CEO, Magna International (Canada); Marina Berlusconi, Vice Chairman, Fininvest (Italy); Christine Tsung, President & CEO, China Airlines (Taiwan). You can read about the other forty at www.fortune.com or in the international editions of FORTUNE.

I don't know if you guys have read the cover story of the current issue of Red Herring...read it last night, it is not up on the web yet. A friend forwarded it to me in scanned format..I guess the doomsdayers will now come out of the woodworks.. interestingly, this article pre-dates Skilling's departure...

Kal, Please provide David with as many statistics as he needs for his book.  Could you also make sure that David gets help in turning around any comments on any quotes etc he may want to use for his book as I understand they have some pretty short timescales.

I have attached a couple of recent presentations and the old presentation from the analyst conference in January.




Thanks

Louise

You mean I can't put it in the EnTouch!  It isn't cross company, so it doesn't require approval.

FYI - The pun above refers to the small down-time we had a few days ago and talks about that being one of the proofs that things are not well at Enron....  Great time to take pot shots at everything we do for these guys!

Enron offline.

08/17/2001

Enron CEO Jeff Skilling quit this week at a time when the company has problems
in almost every geographic region and business sector in which it operates.

Its once-vaunted broadband business is in the dumps, and the Dabhol power
project, at one time the prize example of foreign investment in India, has
turned into a debacle (EC Jul.13,p4). The company recently withdrew
mysteriously from two high-profile Middle East gas ventures, including a stake
in one of three Saudi projects (EC Jun.15,p5). Just last week, an explosion
took down its Teeside power plant in the UK, killing three workers (EC
Aug.10,p9), and its internet-based trading service, EnronOnline, suffered a
morning-long outage. California has issued virtual "wanted posters" for the
company and its execs for allegedly causing the state's electricity crisis.
The stock has tracked the downfall. Just a year ago, Enron was trading at more
than $90/share. It was recently hovering around $42, and has dropped since
Skilling's announcement below $40. Not even the 22nd consecutive quarter of
record earnings, issued last month, helped. Sharks could now start circling
the waters. Several years ago, Royal Dutch/Shell made overtures, apparently
drawn by access to Enron's massive North American gas and power marketing
business and gas pipeline system. When nothing came of the talks, Shell bought
Tejas Energy. The Shell rumors have now resurfaced - and Enron investors might
be prepared to listen this time round.

Although the stock price decline began on the watch of once and again chief
executive Ken Lay, it accelerated once Skilling assumed the post in February
as Lay headed to Washington to become part of President George W. Bush's
unofficial advisory team. Skilling's move also coincided with the overall
slide in all tech stocks, but termination of a highly touted broadband
partnership with Blockbuster Video accelerated the decline.

Though Skilling says he left for personal reasons, reports that some board
members were unhappy with his performance had been circulating for weeks. Nor
is Skilling the only one to jump Enron's troubled ship. Rebecca Mark, once
viewed as a possible rival to Skilling, "resigned" last summer because of the
poor performance of Enron's Azurix water business. Joe Sutton, who headed
Enron's international business, left last autumn over a difference in
strategy. Sutton supported investments in hard assets, while Enron's business
model now is "asset light." More recently, vice chairman Cliff Baxter and Lou
Pai, who headed the retail energy unit, have departed, and Ken Rice, once the
golden boy of broadband, is reportedly leaving.

Lay assured analysts after Skilling's announcement that Enron would continue
the strategy of building up its trading operations and operating with a
minimum of assets. Based on the past year's stock performance, it might be
better to head in another direction.

FYI - the claim that both ICE and EOL have more than 1/3 of the electronic trading market each may be true, but doesn't reflect on how much more we have on EOL than on ICE....

  NEW YORK, Aug. 23 /PRNewswire/ -- Electricity trading continued to move
online in the past six months, but most wholesale power deals are still being
done through traditional voice brokerages, the latest Energy Argus survey has
found.  Internet-based trading now makes up 38% of trading in the US, up from
28.5% in February and 25% in April 2000, according to Argus data.  

  Most online trading is done through either IntercontinentalExchange or
EnronOnline, each of which have more than a third of the electronic market,
the survey of 40 power traders found.  However, another 24% of the
transactions are completed through a variety of other platforms, including
DynegyDirect, Bloomberg Powermatch and TradeSpark.
  Although their market share has declined from 75% two years ago, traditional
brokers continue to process most power trades, due to their ability to offer
options and other derivatives, their dominance in the short- term physical
markets and some trading houses' reluctance to embrace online technology.

UK: INTERVIEW-Metals screen trade set to evolve - Spectron.
By Andy Blamey

10/12/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Electronic trading of base metals futures has established a firm foothold in the market but the nature of online trading platforms looks set to evolve further, says Gavin Gross, head of LME metals at Spectron Futures Ltd. 
UK-based energy and commodities broker Spectron's electronic platform for the trading of London Metal Exchange (LME) contracts has become required viewing for traders alongside the LME's own system LME Select and the Enron Group's EnronOnline.
"I think we've proved that people will trade LME derivatives contracts online, because there are some great advantages to doing so," Gross told Reuters in a telephone interview. 
"And unlike the physical markets, where things haven't really taken off online, all three platforms are pretty much indispensable to the market." 
Both Spectron and LME Select are neutral platforms in which Category 1 and Category 2 LME members trade with each other, while EnronOnline is open to a wider membership but has Enron itself as the sole counterparty in each transaction. 
This leaves a gap in the market for a multi-party trading system open to industry participants beyond the immediate trading community, Gross suggested. 
"I think the clear trend for metals derivatives trading for the future is for open platforms which would allow dealers and clients in the market to interact with each other online," he said. 
Direct access for clients to an electronic trading environment could mean changes in the role of the broker, he said. 
"Clients will have the advantage of more control, more visibility and more transparency in what they do. However, they'll have to pay for services," Gross said. 
"You could see a situation where dealers specialise in different areas - certain dealers would provide credit functions, certain institutions would provide clearing, others would provide execution and certain companies would provide market-making." 
DIFFICULT CONDITIONS 
Difficult market conditions are already forcing metals traders to rethink their activities; this week alone has seen N.M. Rothschild & Sons exit base metals trading and both Bank of Nova Scotia and Enron looking to scale back. 
"On the LME now you've got low volumes, falling volatilities, falling prices and we're in the grips of a bear market. It's very, very poor for business in general," Gross said. 
"There are too many dealers around chasing a shrinking amount of business...Each company is going to have to look very carefully at their business and their staffing levels." 
Spectron has not been immune from declining volumes. 
"Our volumes for the first 12 months of operation were fantastic, way beyond what we had expected. However, our volumes have fallen in the recent quarter," Gross said. 
"That's due to two factors: first, the overall market activity is lower, and second LME Select has managed to attract some of the business that we would previously have had 100 percent of." 
The company is now looking at ways to further develop its trading platform. 
"We're beginning to investigate ways to add certain features and do things differently. That might involve creating an alternative platform where clients could access prices and thereby widen the service," Gross said. 
But, he stressed, "we have to keep the interests of our dealer clients foremost." 
UNCERTAINTY 
In the current environment, the LME's refusal to throw its weight behind either open-outcry floor trade or its new screen system - the exchange has taken pains not to express any preference and to "allow the market to decide" - may prove to be counterproductive, Gross said. 
"By having two systems running side by side ... the exchange is almost moving in two totally different directions," he said. 
"There's a feeling that the ring is doomed, which doesn't do anything to encourage its use, while the reluctance to fully back electronic trading means that you're still only seeing a trickle of business going through Select in terms of overall volumes." 
While preferences vary in different sectors of the market, the current uncertainty is helping no-one, he said: 
"Metals traders just want to trade. They just want to know with some kind of certainty how the market will be structured in future so they can structure their business to support that and make money."

Louise,

I thoroughly enjoyed our telephone conversation several weeks ago.  As
promised, I am following up with some thoughts on how we might best use the
time I have on your calendar next week.  I am very much looking forward to
the visit with you and some of your team members.  Joining me on the visit
will be Yoko Sugiura Selden.  She works with me in my consulting business
and is also helping me with the course.  She is a former investment banker
and joined my firm after we were married.  I thought I might indicate some
of the discussion areas I would like to explore.

Just to remind you, I have launched a brand new course at Columbia
University, Graduate School of Business, titled Internet Financial
Management.  The theme of the course is how companies can use the Internet
to create sustained excess shareowner returns.  This theme applies equally
to pure-play B2B and B2C companies as well as to the bulk of traditional
companies that are trying to figure out how best to leverage the Internet in
their "normal" course of business.  To describe this process I have used the
term "e-tizing".  By that I mean the total transformation of a firm's
business processes such that all relevant operations and communications,
whether they are internal (i.e., among operating units and functions) or
external (i.e., between a firm and its customers, suppliers and alliance
partners), are performed on the Internet.  Obviously the decision of where
to "e-tize" and where not to is ultimately an ROI question. (By the way, GE
uses the term "digitizing" for roughly the same notion.)

In order to make the course experience for the students especially valuable
and to provide a much broader exposure for Columbia in the Internet area, I
have departed from the typical course format in two key ways.  First, since
everything is moving too quickly for a textbook to exist, I have assembled a
world-class group of lecturers who have kindly agreed to make the time to
join us.  Second, the students are grouped in teams to work on specific
action learning projects with corporate sponsors.  In addition, Geoff Colvin
of Fortune and I are writing up the lecturers and will craft them into a
series of Fortune articles.  So far we have been very fortunate, the
speakers have been extremely accommodating and absolutely outstanding in
both content and delivery - not to create any pressure!!  To give you a
feel, Terry Jones, the CEO of Travelocity, will be spending a good deal of
time on this coming Monday discussing the implications of what he has
learned, in creating one of the most effective Internet sales and marketing
machines, for traditional companies that sell to consumers.

As further background, the student teams are working with Applied Materials,
Travelocity, Trilogy and Barnes & Noble.com.  This small set of companies
represents a nice cross section of B2B, B2C and more traditional brick and
mortar companies.  Irrespective of the company setting, each student team
will be focusing on projects that deal with using the Internet to create
sustained excess shareowner returns.  The target Fortune audience will also
cover a broad cross section of companies, but with an emphasis on
traditional non-pure play Internet enterprises.

Louise, with respect to your presentation, I would like for you to explore a
fairly specific set of issues so that (a) the student teams will be able to
use the learnings to leverage their projects with their sponsor companies
and (b) the series of lectures will mesh together very effectively for our
writing for Fortune.

For the non-pure play Internet companies, I want to use GE and Enron as best
practice examples.  I have been meeting extensively with the GE folks and am
beginning to get a pretty good handle on what they are doing today and what
they are likely to be doing over the next few years.  In the same vein, I
view my visit to Enron as having three primary goals: (i) getting to know
you and some of the Enron management team, (ii) getting a good understanding
of how your business is using the Internet to create shareowner value and
(iii) establishing a working outline for your session in April.  Clearly (i)
and especially (ii) will form the basis for (iii).

I have scheduled the following times with Tammie to meet with you and/or
your team:
February 21: 12:00 - 3:30  --  Louise (work on (ii) and plan for Feb. 22)
February 22:   8:00 - 2:30  --  Work with other team members
February 22:   2:30 - 5:30  --  Louise (Review learnings and plan (iii))

A sampling of the kinds of questions I would like to investigate would be
the following:
-	Is the essence of what you have accomplished the creation of a totally new
business or "e-tizing" a pre-existing business?
-	How pervasive is the use of the Internet in the day-to-day running of
Enron?  For example, has Enron gone the route of Cisco and GE in trying to
e-tize sufficiently to close your books globally on a daily basis?
-	To what extent is the approach of your business to the Internet creating
or forcing compatibility of technology/information systems between you and
your "customers" (i.e., trading partners?) and "suppliers" (participants in
the physical value chain?)?
-	We discussed the critical role of process definition and detailed mapping
to your success.  Could you outline for us the process and what are the 5-10
major success factors and 5-10 "failure" factors?
-	From a technology perspective, I believe you mentioned that you first
looked outside for a solution and found that typical ERP type approaches
would have required such massive modifications, that you felt "starting from
scratch" would be more valuable.  I would like to discuss that in more
detail.  Also, how did you systematically tackle the task?   What was the
timeline?  Having been through the experience, what are the key learnings
for next time --- what not to do, what to do more off and how to go faster?
-	Also, on the technology level I would be very interested in learning about
the full set of technology building blocks --  including telecom, hardware
(servers, routers, etc.), storage (software and hardware), content software.
Also along those lines, what are the costs --  capital, set-up and
maintenance? (Should this be 2% or 10% of revenue?)
-	How is the overall technology investment managed so as to get optimal
synergies and yet not impinge on the distinctive diverse needs of various
different businesses in Enron?
-	How are you measuring "customer," "supplier," and operational metrics
differently due to your Internet efforts?  How has this change the form,
content and use of your financials?

After reading this e-mail, if you have any thoughts please don't hesitate to
give me a call (212-688-2034) or send an e-mail message.

Yoko and I are really looking forward to our visit!!

Thanks in advance.  Best regards,

Larry

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

EBS Joins EWS
Effective, July 12, EBS has become a business unit within Enron Wholesale S=
ervices.  All EBS commercial support functions will be integrated into thos=
e units within EWS, which enables us to better manage the resources and cos=
ts of the support functions.

All EBS commercial functions have been consolidated into the following unit=
s:
Europe - headed by Matthew Scrimshaw
Asia - headed by Anthony Duenner
Americas - headed by Rich DiMichele

Additionally, the North American EBS origination teams have been consolidat=
ed into one group, led by Stewart Seeligson.  North American trading and ri=
sk management will continue to report to Paul Racicot.  Paul will also over=
see the global portfolio from a risk management perspective.

Global Network Operations will continue to report to the EBS Office of the =
Chairman.

All EBS asset positions will continue to be reviewed and repositioned to mo=
st effectively meet the future needs of EBS and the Portland office will be=
 closed by October 1.


Global Strategic Sourcing
Effective July 1, a number of measures and recommendations have been implem=
ented to reduce expenditures associated with, among other things, travel an=
d entertainment, and professional services.  Global Strategic Sourcing ("GS=
S") will undertake this very important initiative and they would like to en=
list your support in the implementation of these new procedures.

This message will focus on Travel and entertainment.  Next week's message w=
ill focus on professional services.

Travel and Entertainment - Enron has a tremendous opportunity to save on tr=
avel and entertainment expenditures by making some relatively painless adju=
stments.

?=09Air Travel - Air transportation is the single largest component in the =
travel mix.  In recognition of this fact, a number of significant discounts=
 have been negotiated with all of the major carriers.  There are two separa=
te channels available to employees to access the Enron-negotiated fares.  T=
he first is Travel Agency in the Park ("TAP"), or the GSS-approved preferre=
d travel agency for your location, and the second is the new Enron-managed =
online travel booking service, ClickTrip, located at <http://clicktrip.enro=
n.com/enron>.

Over the coming weeks, GSS will be promoting training and usage of ClickTri=
p, as the primary method of booking domestic U.S. travel for a number of re=
asons.  First, excluding proprietary carriers like Southwest Airlines, Clic=
kTrip provides employees easy access to all travel and pricing options for =
their destination, including the Enron-negotiated fares.  Second, industry =
data shows that employees will generally make the most cost-effective trave=
l decision when presented with the relevant facts.  Conservatively speaking=
, we estimate that a 20% savings in airfare is attainable through the use o=
f this tool alone.  Third, it is relatively painless to use.  Fourth, Click=
Trip is accessible 24X7 from any internet-enabled personal computer and aft=
er-hours telephone support is available. If you have travel-related questio=
ns, please contact Tracy Ramsey at ext. 6-8311.
=20
One final air travel reminder worth promoting: For employees who fly in the=
 United States, use of non-refundable coach tickets generally runs 65 perce=
nt less than refundable tickets and can usually be changed by simply paying=
 a $100 fee.

?=09Lodging and Car Rental - GSS has also negotiated preferred rates at a n=
umber of hotel chains in many cities worldwide to accommodate your business=
 unit's individual hotel policy. Additionally, preferred car rental rates i=
ncluding insurance coverage with National (U.S. and Canada) and Alamo (U.S.=
) have been negotiated for your use.  More detailed information is availabl=
e regarding both programs through our travel site located at <http://travel=
.enron.com>.

Enron Industrial Markets - Forest Products
EIM began trading in the physical markets for Forest Products (newsprint, p=
ulp, recycled paper, and lumber) in August, 2000 and Steel in January, 2001=
.  Since then EIM has handled over 140,000 tons of recycled paper, 180,000 =
tons of newsprint, 150,000 tons of pulp, 160 million board feet of lumber, =
and 210,000 tons of steel.  Currently on a weekly basis, EIM is moving appr=
oximately 20,000 tons of forest products (newsprint, pulp and recycled pape=
r), 3 million board feet of lumber, and 10,000 tons of steel products throu=
ghout the world. =20

Due to much larger volumes of forward trading, EIM is expanding its physica=
l product delivery capabilities around the world to physically handle 5 mil=
lion tons per year.  The EIM Logistics Group coordinates the activities of =
customer service, supply and demand matching, scheduling of owned assets, a=
nd physical transport and warehousing.  These activities are primarily coor=
dinated through the Houston office, with additional resources in London and=
 Singapore.

Additionally, EIM owns paper mills in Quebec City and New Jersey which have=
 a combined production capacity of 750,000 tons of newsprint per month, and=
 a cold rolling steel mill in Arkansas with capacity of 400,000 tons per ye=
ar.  Each of these facilities includes Logistics resources that are coordin=
ated through the EIM Logistics Group.

Enron Global Markets - LNG
Enron Global LNG has enhanced its Atlantic Basin LNG supply portfolio with =
volumes from Nigeria LNG Limited (NLNG).  Enron Global LNG recently signed =
a Memorandum of Understanding with NLNG for delivery of 1 BCM/ year (billio=
n cubic meters) or (97,000 Mcf/day) from the NLNG Plus Project.  This is a =
two train expansion of NLNG's existing Bonny Island LNG production facility=
.  The expansion is scheduled for completion in 2005.  This deal represents=
 a major step in the establishment of Enron's global LNG network.

EGM - Finance & Structuring
On June 29, 2001, Enron Global Markets - LNG Group successfully completed t=
he divestiture of its 100% equity interest in Progasco, to CHDR, Inc. via a=
n all cash transaction.  Progasco sells and distributes LPG to commercial a=
nd industrial clients, and independent resellers, through a fleet of tanker=
 trucks, bobtail trucks and 13 filling plants throughout Puerto Rico.  CHDR=
, Inc. is the record and beneficial owner of all of the issued and outstand=
ing shares of stock of Tropigas de Puerto Rico, Inc. ("Tropigas").  Upon co=
mpletion of this transaction, Tropigas, hitherto the 3rd largest market pla=
yer will operate the newly consolidated entity and control a 35% market sha=
re, becoming the 2nd largest Puerto Rican LPG marketer.=20

The sale proceeds of approximately $14.3 million, have been split between P=
rotane (a wholly owned Enron Corp. Delaware subsidiary) and San Juan Gas (S=
JG), and were used to pay down inter-company debt owed to SJG and Pro Carib=
e.  The net (pre-tax) gain recorded on the transaction was $3.9 million.=20

The profitable sale of this strategic asset allows EGM to exit the retail p=
ropane business it inherited through the 1985 merger of three companies: Pr=
otane, Petrolane and Imperial Gas, and will enable Enron to better deploy t=
he cash received and more efficiently manage its Puerto Rican human resourc=
es.=20

EGM - Weather
The Weather group just completed a deal with People's Energy to protect the=
m against lower gas prices during a warmer than normal winter.  This innova=
tive winter protection was structured to manage People's exposure to both t=
he volume and price of natural gas.  Greg Penman and Bob Beyer, from the Ch=
icago office, were the lead dealmakers for this transaction.  Simlar deals =
with other counterparties are expected to come over the winter season.
Also, the Weather Group has started exploring new opportunities with EES.  =
To support this effort, Elsa Piekieniak has joined the group.  Elsa is look=
ing for several people to help her with this initiative.  If you're interes=
ted in a position, please contact Elsa.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

UPDATE ON ENRON EUROPE'S CONTRIBUTION TO 2ND QUARTER RESULTS
Congratulations to all staff for your contribution to another fantastic qua=
rter! =20

By now we hope you will have had an opportunity to read about Enron's Q2 ea=
rnings, which were released to the investment community in Houston on Thurs=
day, 12th July.  Overall the business has seen continued strong growth with=
 revenues increasing to over $100 million in the first half of the year up =
from $30 million for the same period last year.  Earnings per share this qu=
arter also exceeded analyst expectations and came in at $0.45 for the quart=
er up from $0.34 for the same period last year.

Equally important, however, is the vital role Enron Europe played this quar=
ter in contributing to the company's overall results.   We are seeing some =
terrific trends here in Europe - notably, on the wholesale side, the Contin=
ental, UK and Nordic power and gas teams keep going from strength to streng=
th as we see exceptional growth in volumes and transactions continue this q=
uarter.  Total physical and financial settled volumes for gas and power in =
Europe have seen an increase of 172% in the first six months of the year co=
mpared to the first six months in 2000 and the total number of transactions=
 per day has risen to 604 from 272 last year.  Specifically, UK power volum=
es are up 204% to 147 TWh in the first six months of 2001 from 48 TWh in th=
e same period last year.  Continental gas volumes have grown from 351 Bbtue=
/day in 2000 to 1,390 Bbtue/day in 2001 - a 296% increase - and Continental=
 power volumes have seen growth of 360% with volumes rising from 18 TWh in =
the first six months of 2000 to 83 TWh for the same period this year.  The =
growth in volumes is not simply limited to the UK and Continental markets, =
however, as Nordic power volumes have increased by 153% from 29 TWh to 73 T=
Wh in the first half of 2001.

The success stories are not just limited to gas and power trading, however,=
 and abound throughout the business:

Enron Energy Services
The retail business has experienced a real boost this quarter with the clos=
ing of EES' first, major "marquis" brand energy outsourcing transaction wit=
h supermarket giant, J. Sainsbury plc.  Of equal importance, Enron Direct's=
 business continues to grow with total customers now in excess of 160,000. =
 The success of Enron Direct's business model has translated into the devel=
opment of new business on the Continent in the Netherlands and Spain and, m=
ore recently in North America, with the 2nd quarter opening of Enron Direct=
 Canada. =20

Enron Credit
A year after Enron Credit's launch, the total life to date notional value o=
f transactions has surpassed $11.8 billion and in the 2nd quarter alone, En=
ron Credit generated $10.4 million in EBIT.  Further, more than 20,000 read=
ers per week view the Enron Cost of Credit (ECC) through independent public=
ations.  =20

Enron Australia
With 2nd quarter power volumes up 177% from the first three months this yea=
r, Enron Australia is gearing up for a strong growth year.  With the develo=
pment of a physical power position key to expanding Enron's power trading i=
n Australia, work began this quarter to identify and begin the initial purs=
uit of asset development projects.  Other businesses undergoing significant=
 expansion this quarter were coal, renewable energy credits and weather der=
ivatives.=20

Spain:  Arcos
The Arcos asset development project in Spain continues to make great progre=
ss with third party access to gas supplies for the power project being succ=
essfully negotiated this quarter, plus the project achieved another milesto=
ne in the permit/government approvals arena with the granting of its water =
concession in Q2.

UK:  ETOL
ETOL, a long-standing contributor to Enron Europe's earnings, generated yet=
 another profitable transaction this quarter with the signing of a series o=
f deals with chemical giant Du Pont for supplies at Wilton International. T=
he transaction further strengthens Enron's relationship with Du Pont, one o=
f ETOL's largest customers, and will extend the current steam and power sup=
ply contract through 2010. =20

Enron Metals
A year after entering the metals business, Enron Metals has seen increased =
volumes of 130% in its merchant and financial trading operations this quart=
er with volumes up to over 3.5 million tonnes as compared to just over 1.5 =
million tonnes in the 2nd quarter last year.  Not only has the team seen po=
sitive growth in volumes this quarter, but they have increased their share =
of trading on the LME by 50% and are making significant progress with Proje=
ct Salem - a major IT and systems improvement project that will streamline =
deal capture and risk management for metals transactions.  Finally, the met=
als team achieved a true home run this quarter when they closed a major ten=
-year origination transaction that, through the addition of smelting assets=
, will enable the metals team to improve its trading position.  The transac=
tion proved to be the perfect opportunity to leverage all of Enron's tradin=
g and origination capabilities and involved input from a number of groups a=
cross Enron.  =20

Looking to the future, we have every expectation that the strong growth we'=
ve witnessed in Europe for the first half of the year will continue through=
 end 2001.  So, in the words of Solomon Smith Barney analyst, Ray Niles, wh=
en talking about Enron's European wholesale operations results this quarter=

Louise - first congratulations on your new boy Scott - Marcus has been keeping me posted and I even saw those great photos on his desk.  I don't think we have met; I work for EPMI in NEPOOL with John Llodra and report to Ed Baughman.  

I am writing to ask if you would speak with my brother-in-law, Dave Gautschi, a partner with Deloitte & Touche, who is co-authoring a book on e-businesses called Net Markets (see attached outline and reproduction of the cover).  The focus of the book is to " ?? take a business executives perspective on the implications of B2B eMarketplaces on their business and overall business environment globally.  It will lead the reader through the basic options for implementing real valuable B2B tools and technologies.  It will then move to more and more complex AND valuable B2B opportunities.  More importantly, it will identify and articulate the day-to-day business IMPLICATIONS of Ebusiness."

Dave, a PhD in mathematics (go figure), a former marketing professor, a folk singer (he leads our family in song fests) and just a great guy is intrigued/impressed with Enron on Line (who isn't) and would very much like your insights.  I believe the exposure to both Deloitte and the readers of this book would be great for Enron in general and Enron On Line specifically.

If you are available please call his research assistant Mike Russell at 206-215-4285 to arrange a time to talk (they will be very responsive as their manuscript deadline is late July).  I am reachable today on my cell at 617-733-8713 and on vacation next week but Claudette Harvey will know where to reach me.

Thanks for your consideration and enjoy your new young one (kids are great, I have two)

George "Woody" Wood

Top Marketer Volumes Still Showing Tremendous Growth, NGI Says

08/23/2001
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)

  DULLES, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 23, 2001--North America's top 20 largest
natural gas marketers showed a greater than 20% increase in volume--up 31
Bcf/d--during the second quarter to 168.9 Bcf/d. 

  Only Coral, PG&E, Williams and ExxonMobil reported slight decreases compared
to the second quarter of 2000, according to NGI's quarterly ranking of the
companies based on volume.
  "We're seeing a lot more electronic trading," said Ben Schlesinger of
Maryland-based Schlesinger & Associates in explaining the causes of the
continued growth. "EnronOnline is still seeing growth and so is ICE
(IntercontinentalExchange). I also think we are seeing a lot more financial
trading as well. There was plenty in the last year or two, but I think one
thing that has continued to change is the real upsurge in the kinds of risk
trading that these guys are offering. That's a movement that's likely to
continue in the both the gas and electricity markets." 

  The largest volume and percentage increases among the top 20 were shown by
American Electric Power, BP, Mirant, El Paso, PanCanadian and Reliant. AEP
jumped from 18th in NGI's ranking in the second quarter 2000 to 10th in 2Q2001
with a 5.5 Bcf/d increase (179%). BP moved up to second place from fifth with
a 4.9 Bcf/d increase (66.2%). 

  BP's second-place volumes, at 12.3 Bcf/d were only half of Enron's 25.3
Bcf/d. Mirant came in third with a 4.1 Bcf/d rise (53%)to 11.8 Bcf/d. Although
El Paso posted 51% volume growth (3.1 Bcf/d), it was pushed down by several
other rapidly growing companies to the 9th place from No. 2. 

  Filling in the top 10 were Reliant in fourth place, Duke in fifth, Dynegy
sixth, Aquila seventh and Sempra eighth, according to NGI's tally. 

  "Volumes aren't perfect, but they are the best and most clear thing that we
have in terms of gauging the size of these business," Credit Suisse First
Boston Analyst Curt Launer told Natural Gas Intelligence. "That growth you are
seeing is going to continue. This is an industry which really is only reaching
one third of the market that is out there for it. If you total all of the
things that these companies are doing right now, they really are only
addressing about $100 billion worth of what is really a north of $300 billion
U.S. energy market. There's probably three to five years worth left of
excellent growth because you are going to have a tripling of the market that
these companies address over the next several years before you and I have to
have a conversation about who has a better business model or who really can
gain market share and is doing things better than anyone else."

CEO Departure Puzzles Enron Investors

When Enron's President and CEO suddenly and unexpectedly announced he was
leaving the company earlier this week, the stock got hammered due to the
increased uncertainty. The exact reasons for the departure are puzzling and
remain a mystery, and this is probably not the last chapter we'll hear in
this story.


By Paul Larson (TMF Parlay)
August 17, 2001


The plot around Enron (NYSE: ENE) has thickened. On Tuesday evening, the
commodities market maker's president and CEO, Jeffrey Skilling, said that
he was leaving his posts for "personal reasons." Skilling had spent most of
his career rising through the ranks at Enron and had manned the CEO post
since February. Many saw Skilling as quite brash, sharp, egotistical, and
one who brought more than his fair share of youthful energy to the
"new-age" Enron.


But now that Skilling has resigned, Chairman Kenneth Lay -- the man
Skilling took the reins from -- will again act as president and CEO until a
permanent replacement is found. Lay was Enron's CEO from 1985 until earlier
this year, and he was largely behind the company's push to become the
wholesale trading powerhouse it is today after years as a sleepy gas line
operator. (For more on the energy industry, see our latest issue of The
Motley Fool Select.)


So why did Skilling bail?
The first reason Skilling cited for his departure was the very vague
"personal reasons." Both the company and Skilling denied the resignation
was for health reasons of any kind, and the secrecy and resultant
uncertainty has sent the stock diving, losing roughly $6 (or about 14%) of
market value on extremely heavy volume in the two trading days since the
announcement was made.


The move is especially puzzling since the departure is hitting Skilling in
the pocketbook -- hard. Since Skilling is leaving voluntarily, he will not
receive a severance package that would have reportedly been worth more than
$20 million in cash and stock had he been forcefully pushed out. Even if
Skilling had been doing a terrible job at Enron, one would think he would
stick around and wait for the axe to fall instead of leaving on his own,
given that potential windfall.


The departure is even more riddling when one considers a roughly $2 million
loan outstanding that Enron has to Skilling. If Skilling had been canned,
this loan would have been forgiven. More importantly, if Skilling had
fulfilled his employment contract to the end of the year -- a mere four
more months -- Skilling could have kept this $2 million free and clear. How
many folks do you know who pass up $2 million for four months of work?


Yet another oddity in this case is The Wall Street Journal's report that
one of the reasons Skilling left was because of Enron's faltering share
price. Ironically, the fashion in which he has left has been directly
responsible for causing the shares to breach a new annual low.


Many long-time Enron investors may remember when Skilling brashly called
Enron's shares undervalued back in January, saying the stock should trade
above $120. But since Skilling took the helm, the stock has done nothing
but fall, losing over half its value in the past six months. Even though
much of the stock's weakness had nothing to do with the company's operating
performance, the pressure of not living up to that bullish projection was
supposedly very difficult for Skilling.


Still, the exact reasons for the sudden departure remain a mystery today.
Both Skilling and the company deny there were any accounting problems or
other improprieties behind the resignation, and both continue to speak
quite positively about Enron. But for a company that has a reputation of
strong management, this week's activities are highly out of character.
Investors may be unsatisfied with the current state of affairs and
information, but for the time being there's little to do but stay tuned.

Drop in Natural-Gas Prices May Be Good For Consumers but Hinder New Production
By Alexei Barrionuevo
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

10/02/2001
The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

In the wake of last month's terrorist attacks, natural-gas prices have slid below $2 per million British thermal units, frustrating any hopes that prices will rebound this year to levels that would encourage more investment in natural-gas projects. 
Analysts predict that with prices at current levels, projects to bring more liquefied natural gas into the U.S. could be shelved or canceled.
Natural-gas prices, which reached highs of nearly $10 per million BTUs last December, had held to around $3 to $5 per million BTUs for much of the year. At $2 per million BTUs and below, producers have a hard time justifying exploration and new production. 
Analysts blamed the drop on weak industrial demand, fueled by the struggling chemicals and metals industries and by weaker electric-utility demand. Nearby November futures fell 36 cents yesterday to $2.208 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
In the Boston area, however, different concerns could lead to higher prices for that region. Last week, the U.S. Coast Guard, under pressure from local lawmakers, indefinitely banned LNG tankers from entering Boston Harbor. LNG makes up 15% of New England's gas supply and nearly half of its supply on very cold days. The Coast Guard and Department of Transportation are studying concerns that a LNG tanker could become a bomb for terrorists. 
Already, relative to other areas, natural-gas prices have inched higher in New England, where natural-gas pipeline constraints have long hampered the market. The spread between prices in New England and the Gulf Coast widened last week by 30 cents to $1.30 per million BTUs, said a spokeswoman for Distrigas, a unit of Belgium's Tractebel SA. But the lack of LNG isn't likely to become a big issue until winter hits and natural-gas storage is used up. 
Richard Grant, CEO of Distrigas, says LNG has a 30-year safety record at the company's Everett, Mass., terminal. While LNG is flammable, he says it is unlikely to explode. He adds that "there are a lot of things being said right now that are just not factual. But until we answer the concerns, we won't be able to bring a ship in here." 
Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown was among several brokerage firms downgrading fourth-quarter projections for natural-gas prices last week. "Prior to Sept. 11, we were seeing signs that a lot of industrial demand was coming back," said Jay Saunders, a Deutsche Banc analyst. "But all that is out the window now." Deutsche Banc is now estimating a 20% drop in winter demand in the industrial sector, which accounts for more than a quarter of total U.S. natural-gas consumption. The slack demand has resulted in supplies that have practically overflowed storage, which is on pace to be full by the end of October. 
While prices that are close to historical levels are good for consumers, such low prices could scare many producers away from making investments to ensure future natural-gas demand is met. Lower prices have already led energy companies to slow their drilling and some firms, such as EOG Resources Inc., plan to moderate production in the next two months. Gas drilling-rig counts fell to 953 last week from 1,030 at the end of August. 
Even with the increased natural-gas drilling of earlier this year, overall natural-gas supply is expected to increase just 1% this year, as the country's mature wells continue to be depleted faster than companies can replace them. The tight supply picture has analysts optimistic that prices will rebound next year amid lower interest rates, increased defense and relief spending and returning consumer confidence. 
Still, the downturn could cause some firms to rethink or postpone projects to import gas in a liquid form. With prices high last winter, El Paso Corp. and Enron Corp., among others, said they would build a dozen or so receiving terminals for liquefied natural gas, which is gas compressed and frozen to minus-260 degrees Fahrenheit. "You will see some cancellations and some delays," predicts Marshall Adkins, an analyst with Raymond James & Associates in Houston. 
Natural-gas prices need to average $3 per million BTUs on the East Coast and $3.50 on the West Coast to justify bringing in LNG to those areas, said Ronald Barone, an analyst with UBS Warburg. 
A spokeswoman for El Paso, Houston, says the company is moving forward with at least three terminals for the U.S. market. Enron said it is also pushing ahead with a terminal in the Bahamas that would pipe the gas to Florida starting in 2004.

Enron leases part of Mumbai estate to Citibank
Freny Patel MUMBAI

10/02/2001
Business Standard

Copyright (c) Business Standard

After months of scouting for a buyer for its one lakh square feet office space at Wockhardt Towers in Bandra-Kurla Complex, Enron has been able lease out 10,000 square feet of it to Citibank NA. 
Against an expected realisation from Rs 130 crore for the outright sale of its four floors, Enron will get around Rs 1.2 crore a year by leasing out one floor to Citibank.
The deal was struck recently by the global real estate consultant, Cushman & Wakefield, at a monthly rental of Rs 100 per square foot. 
With property prices in Mumbai having slumped and with no reprieve expected in the 
short run, companies are increasingly opting to lease space instead of blocking funds in illiquid assets. 
Property consultants say that if Enron manages to lease out the entire four floors, it will be easier for it to sell the property to a buyer, as the buyer would be assured of a fixed income. 
Enron had eyed a deal of Rs 130 crore when it mandated global real estate consultants to sell the premises at around Rs 12,000 per square foot. 
This is despite the fact that real estate at Bandra Kurla currently fetches Rs 8,000 to Rs 9,000 per square feet. In June 2000, the US energy giant had shelled out Rs 125.75 crore when it acquired the four floors, plus car park space, from Wockhardt, the pharmaceutical company. 
The deal was struck at Rs 10,500 per sq ft, and included parking space for 101 cars. 
Industry sources said that Enron had spent a sum close to Rs 150 crore to acquire the property, and pay for the interior furnishings of two of the four floors it had acquired. 
In order for it to break even, it would have had to sell its real estate at the rate of Rs 13,000 per square foot. 
Four to five global real estate consultants have been appointed by Enron for the sale of its premises. A leading consultant said that it has been difficult to find any buyers for such a large property. 
"Most international buyers prefer to take property on lease instead of an outright purchase," he added. 
Moreover, the inefficiency of the building in terms of the super built-up area is another reason why corporate entities are not too eager to acquire the premises, and Enron's proposition continues to go abegging, said the consultant.

Carly Fiorina Tops FORTUNE's List of 50 Most Powerful Women in Business for Fourth Year

10/01/2001
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 1, 2001-- 

Lower-Profile Women Topple More Well-known Names From Tech and
Internet Sector; Ranking Includes 14 Newcomers 

Though Hewlett-Packard lost $65 billion in market value in a year, CEO Carly Fiorina hasn't lost her nerve, and for the fourth consecutive year holds the No. 1 position on FORTUNE's ranking of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business. 
The complete list and accompanying stories are in the October 15 issue of FORTUNE, available on newsstands October 8 and at www.fortune.com at 12:00 p.m. on October 1. 
In the No. 2 spot is eBay CEO Meg Whitman, who runs an Internet company that actually makes money: $85 million in the last four quarters on $582 million in revenue. Oprah Winfrey, the Queen of Media, is mightier than ever, and holds the No. 3 spot, up from No. 15 last year. She produces movies, brings comfort and advice to millions of TV viewers, propels books to bestsellerdom, and, last year, teamed up with Hearst Magazines' Cathie Black (No. 28 on the list) to publish O, The Oprah Magazine-by some measures the most successful magazine startup ever. At No. 4 is Andrea Jung, Chairman and CEO of Avon, who has breathed life into ailing Avon. Mirant CEO Marce Fuller-the only newcomer in the top five-holds the No. 5 position. Inside a stodgy utility, Southern, Fuller built a high-growth trading and marketing unit, which was spun off in April. 
In these new, more tempered times, patience may be about to reap its reward. In FORTUNE's annual survey of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business, there is a clear emergence of women who came to power slowly. Says FORTUNE senior writer Pattie Sellers in "Patient But Not Passive," the story that accompanies the list, "By patience, we mean staying with a company, steadily building influence there, and rising to power through determination and insider knowledge, not promises and self-promotion." 
Fiorina, who has claimed the top spot each year since FORTUNE's inaugural list in 1998, heads the biggest company ($48 billion in revenues last year) run by a woman. And she is still as audacious and impatient as ever. Wall Street practically heckled her latest move-a bold bet to buy Compaq-but Fiorina, 47, remains defiant. In difficult times, "people who drive change are the subject of great scrutiny," she says. 
As always, the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time. Last year, power resided in the technology and Internet sectors, but that influence was fleeting. Gone from the list this year: Deborah "Hurricane Debby" Hopkins, who pushed her agenda too ambitiously at Lucent and lost her CFO job in May; Ellen Hancock, who failed at the startup, Exodus; and Morgan Stanley's Mary Meeker, who influenced so many to buy into the Internet fizz. But one Web warrior looks better than ever: Meg Whitman, No. 2 on the list. She has never overpromised to investors; instead she has diligently delivered above-target profits every single quarter. 
Fourteen newcomers join the list this year: Marce Fuller, President & CEO, Mirant; Louise Kitchen, COO, Enron Americas; Colleen Barrett, President & COO, Southwest Airlines; Betsy Bernard, President & CEO, AT&T Consumer; Anne Stevens, VP, North America Vehicle Operations, Ford Motor; Maria Elena Lagomasino, Chairman & CEO, J. P. Morgan Private Bank; Susan Desmond-Hellman, EVP and Chief Medical Officer, Genentech; Janet Robinson, SVP, Newspaper Operations, New York Times Co.; Carol Tomi, EVP and CFO, Home Depot; Carrie Cox, EVP and President, Global Prescriptions, Pharmacia; Carole Black, President and CEO, Lifetime Television Networks; Janet Davidson, Group President, Integrated Network Solutions, Lucent; Larree Renda, EVP, Retail Operations, Safeway; and Louise Francesconi, VP and GM, Missile Systems, Raytheon. 
While the economy and its points of power change, the criteria we use to evaluate power remains the same. Says Sellers: "We consider the size and importance of a woman's business in the global economy, her clout inside her company, and the arc of her career-where she has been and where she is likely to go. When appropriate, we also weigh the woman's influence on mass culture and society. That factor lifts Oprah Winfrey to No. 3 on this year's list." The shifts on our list this year are dramatic, with 14 newcomers. But one trend is especially intriguing: Women are taking on bigger businesses than ever. A few years ago, responsibility for a $3 billion business almost automatically earned a woman a spot on this list. No more. This year's FORTUNE 50 includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of $20 billion or more, which is a first. 
In a related story, "It Took a Lady To Save Avon," Katrina Brooker looks at Andrea Jung, Chairman and CEO of Avon. Says Brooker, "Jung knows what women want and how to sell it to them. And that's what has made her one of the most successful CEOs-male or female-in recent years." Over the past 20 months she has overhauled nearly everything about the way Avon does business: how it advertises, manufactures, packages, and even sells its products, and she has done it not by abandoning the seemingly outdated Avon Lady, but by reviving her. The result: growth in revenues, operating profits, and operating margins. 
In addition, FORTUNE includes an international list of the 50 powerful women in business. The top ten, featured in the magazine, are Marjorie Scardino, CEO, Pearson (Britain); Anne Lauvergeon, Chairman, Areva (France); Mary Ma, Senior VP & CFO, Legend (Hong Kong); Marianne Nivert, President & CEO, Telia (Sweden); Lien Siaou-Sze, Vice President, Hewlett-Packard (Hong Kong); Patricia Barbizet, CEO, Artemis (France); Eiko Kono, President, Recruit (Japan): Belinda Stronach, CEO, Magna International (Canada); Marina Berlusconi, Vice Chairman, Fininvest (Italy); Christine Tsung, President & CEO, China Airlines (Taiwan).

Carly Fiorina Tops FORTUNE's List of 50 Most Powerful Women in Business for Fourth Year

10/01/2001
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 1, 2001-- 

Lower-Profile Women Topple More Well-known Names From Tech and
Internet Sector; Ranking Includes 14 Newcomers 

Though Hewlett-Packard lost $65 billion in market value in a year, CEO Carly Fiorina hasn't lost her nerve, and for the fourth consecutive year holds the No. 1 position on FORTUNE's ranking of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business. 
The complete list and accompanying stories are in the October 15 issue of FORTUNE, available on newsstands October 8 and at www.fortune.com at 12:00 p.m. on October 1. 
In the No. 2 spot is eBay CEO Meg Whitman, who runs an Internet company that actually makes money: $85 million in the last four quarters on $582 million in revenue. Oprah Winfrey, the Queen of Media, is mightier than ever, and holds the No. 3 spot, up from No. 15 last year. She produces movies, brings comfort and advice to millions of TV viewers, propels books to bestsellerdom, and, last year, teamed up with Hearst Magazines' Cathie Black (No. 28 on the list) to publish O, The Oprah Magazine-by some measures the most successful magazine startup ever. At No. 4 is Andrea Jung, Chairman and CEO of Avon, who has breathed life into ailing Avon. Mirant CEO Marce Fuller-the only newcomer in the top five-holds the No. 5 position. Inside a stodgy utility, Southern, Fuller built a high-growth trading and marketing unit, which was spun off in April. 
In these new, more tempered times, patience may be about to reap its reward. In FORTUNE's annual survey of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business, there is a clear emergence of women who came to power slowly. Says FORTUNE senior writer Pattie Sellers in "Patient But Not Passive," the story that accompanies the list, "By patience, we mean staying with a company, steadily building influence there, and rising to power through determination and insider knowledge, not promises and self-promotion." 
Fiorina, who has claimed the top spot each year since FORTUNE's inaugural list in 1998, heads the biggest company ($48 billion in revenues last year) run by a woman. And she is still as audacious and impatient as ever. Wall Street practically heckled her latest move-a bold bet to buy Compaq-but Fiorina, 47, remains defiant. In difficult times, "people who drive change are the subject of great scrutiny," she says. 
As always, the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time. Last year, power resided in the technology and Internet sectors, but that influence was fleeting. Gone from the list this year: Deborah "Hurricane Debby" Hopkins, who pushed her agenda too ambitiously at Lucent and lost her CFO job in May; Ellen Hancock, who failed at the startup, Exodus; and Morgan Stanley's Mary Meeker, who influenced so many to buy into the Internet fizz. But one Web warrior looks better than ever: Meg Whitman, No. 2 on the list. She has never overpromised to investors; instead she has diligently delivered above-target profits every single quarter. 
Fourteen newcomers join the list this year: Marce Fuller, President & CEO, Mirant; Louise Kitchen, COO, Enron Americas; Colleen Barrett, President & COO, Southwest Airlines; Betsy Bernard, President & CEO, AT&T Consumer; Anne Stevens, VP, North America Vehicle Operations, Ford Motor; Maria Elena Lagomasino, Chairman & CEO, J. P. Morgan Private Bank; Susan Desmond-Hellman, EVP and Chief Medical Officer, Genentech; Janet Robinson, SVP, Newspaper Operations, New York Times Co.; Carol Tomi, EVP and CFO, Home Depot; Carrie Cox, EVP and President, Global Prescriptions, Pharmacia; Carole Black, President and CEO, Lifetime Television Networks; Janet Davidson, Group President, Integrated Network Solutions, Lucent; Larree Renda, EVP, Retail Operations, Safeway; and Louise Francesconi, VP and GM, Missile Systems, Raytheon. 
While the economy and its points of power change, the criteria we use to evaluate power remains the same. Says Sellers: "We consider the size and importance of a woman's business in the global economy, her clout inside her company, and the arc of her career-where she has been and where she is likely to go. When appropriate, we also weigh the woman's influence on mass culture and society. That factor lifts Oprah Winfrey to No. 3 on this year's list." The shifts on our list this year are dramatic, with 14 newcomers. But one trend is especially intriguing: Women are taking on bigger businesses than ever. A few years ago, responsibility for a $3 billion business almost automatically earned a woman a spot on this list. No more. This year's FORTUNE 50 includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of $20 billion or more, which is a first. 
In a related story, "It Took a Lady To Save Avon," Katrina Brooker looks at Andrea Jung, Chairman and CEO of Avon. Says Brooker, "Jung knows what women want and how to sell it to them. And that's what has made her one of the most successful CEOs-male or female-in recent years." Over the past 20 months she has overhauled nearly everything about the way Avon does business: how it advertises, manufactures, packages, and even sells its products, and she has done it not by abandoning the seemingly outdated Avon Lady, but by reviving her. The result: growth in revenues, operating profits, and operating margins. 
In addition, FORTUNE includes an international list of the 50 powerful women in business. The top ten, featured in the magazine, are Marjorie Scardino, CEO, Pearson (Britain); Anne Lauvergeon, Chairman, Areva (France); Mary Ma, Senior VP & CFO, Legend (Hong Kong); Marianne Nivert, President & CEO, Telia (Sweden); Lien Siaou-Sze, Vice President, Hewlett-Packard (Hong Kong); Patricia Barbizet, CEO, Artemis (France); Eiko Kono, President, Recruit (Japan): Belinda Stronach, CEO, Magna International (Canada); Marina Berlusconi, Vice Chairman, Fininvest (Italy); Christine Tsung, President & CEO, China Airlines (Taiwan).

Lockyer Fires Earthy Attack at Energy Exec

   SACRAMENTO -- In a dramatic escalation of energy crisis rhetoric,
California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer this week suggested the chairman of a
Houston-based power company should be locked in a prison cell with an
amorous, tattooed inmate named Spike.

   Lockyer, who is investigating whether energy firms have manipulated
prices on the wholesale electricity market, made the comment in an
interview with the Wall Street Journal that appeared Tuesday.
   "I would love to personally escort [Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth] Lay
to an 8-by-10 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says, 'Hi
my name is Spike, honey,' " Lockyer said.

   Enron spokesman Mark Palmer called the comment "counterproductive
rhetoric" that "does not merit a response."

   But other industry representatives denounced the remark as
"outrageous," especially because neither Lockyer's office nor any
investigative panel has filed charges against Enron or other companies.

   "You'd expect that the state's chief legal counsel would file charges
first and make public statements second," said Gary Ackerman of the
Western Power Trading Forum, an association of energy producers and
traders. "We're very disappointed with his choice of words, which don't
exactly fit the profile of his office."

   In an interview Tuesday, Lockyer said he decided to "ratchet up" the
commentary to "put [energy companies] on notice" that "we are not afraid
of them and have the will to prosecute."

   "What I'm trying to do is let these economic buccaneers understand
that if we catch them, they're going to be prosecuted," Lockyer said.
"Just because they're multimillionaires and run big corporations, it
doesn't provide them with immunity."

   The attorney general is investigating whether power company officials
tried to maximize profits through illegal manipulation of prices on the
wholesale energy market. Several panels, including a state Senate
committee and the California Public Utilities Commission, are conducting
similar probes.

   On Tuesday, Lockyer announced that three power companies have agreed
to turn over documents subpoenaed months ago by his investigators. The
attorney general went to court to obtain the documents after the
companies failed to meet a March 19 deadline to hand them over.

   Lockyer said the forthcoming documents would help his office as it
sifts through mountains of evidence in search of possible violations of
antitrust or unfair business practice laws.

   "Evidence is accumulating that certainly infers illegal activity,"
Lockyer said. "But we need to make sure it's compelling and clear enough
that you can convince a jury."

   Lockyer said he singled out Enron's chairman because the Houston
company is the world's largest energy trader.

   At least one observer found Lockyer's comments refreshingly candid.
Harry Snyder, a senior advocate of Consumers Union, said, "Let Lockyer be
Lockyer."

LONDON -- BG Group PLC extended its reach in the Indian subcontinent and expanded its exploration and production portfolio with the purchase of the offshore Indian assets of U.S. energy group Enron Corp. for $388 million (422 million euros). 
Analysts applauded the purchase by the U.K. oil and gas company, saying it is acquiring some promising assets inexpensively. The price works out to less than $2.30 per barrel of oil equivalent, given the proven and probable reserves of more than 170 million barrels of oil equivalent of Enron Oil & Gas India Ltd. "We value other Indian oil and gas reserves at $2.90 (assuming an oil price of $18), so BG appears to have paid a good price," said ABN Amro in a research note.
A Bombay-based energy analyst reckoned Enron "probably undersold," noting that earlier this year Indian state-owned Oil & Natural Gas Corp., a partner of Enron's Indian unit, had its $400 million offer for the assets rejected. 
Enron has experienced mixed success as an integrated energy operator in India, and is attempting to exit the controversial Dabhol Power Project, India's largest private power plant, in which it has a 65% controlling stake. 
The Indian unit's assets comprise a 30% stake in the Tapti gas field and the Panna/Mukta oil and gas field, and a 62.64% interest in the CB-OS/1 exploration license in the Gulf of Cambay off western India. The Enron unit is the designated operator of these developments. 
Equity production from the fields amounts to 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, representing about 6% to 7% of BG's total output. For the year ended March 31, Enron's Indian unit posted pro forma profit after tax of $60 million on revenue of $160 million. 
The acquisition complements BG's fledgling refining and marketing interests in India, which include holdings in western Indian distributors Gujarat Gas Co. (65%) and Mahanagar Gas (50%). It is also the driving force behind a project to pipe liquefied natural gas from Iran to tap India's growing appetite for gas.

BG to Buy Enron Assets Offshore India 
British oil and natural-gas company BG Group agreed to acquire the offshore Indian assets of U.S. energy company Enron for $388 million. The purchase of Enron Oil & Gas India, with proven and probable reserves of more than 170 million barrels of oil equivalent, is valued at about $2.30 a barrel, a bargain by international standards, analysts said. Enron has had mixed success as an integrated energy company in India, and is attempting to unwind its 65% stake in Dabhol Power, India's largest private-sector power plant.

The BG Group of Britain agreed to buy the oil and natural gas fields of Enron in India for $388 million. The operations include a 30 percent stake in the Tapti gas field and the Panna/Mukhta oil and gas fields, plus 63 percent of an untapped deposit on the country's west coast. BG said the assets held more than 170 million barrels of oil and gas. They do not include Enron's Dabhol Power project, which has been entangled in a nine-month payment dispute with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board. Enron is looking to sell its 64 percent stake in the project for $1.2 billion to cover the cost of its investment. Tata Power and BSES, both of India, have indicated an interest, people close to the talks said. Suzanne Kapner (NYT)

COMPANIES & FINANCE UK - BG to expand assets in India.

BG, the gas and oil group, has stepped up its efforts to develop India into one of its core markets with the $388m ( #262m) purchase of assets owned by Enron, the US energy and trading group. 
The deal is the latest sign of Enron's retreat from the region, and comes as the group is separately attempting to withdraw from the $2.8bn Dabhol power plant following a payment dispute with Maharashtra state.
BG is placing particular emphasis on developing markets. 
It has operated in India for 10 years but has so far concentrated on gas distribution through a 65 per cent interest in Gujarat Gas Company and a joint venture with the Gas Authority of India in Mumbai. 
David McManus, BG executive vice-president responsible for eastern hemisphere business, said the transaction would give it the opportunity to develop the Indian gas market. The company has a view to creating demand for imported liquefied natural gas through BG's planned Pipavav LNG terminal in Gujarat. 
"India has the second fastest-growing gas market after China and we see it as a core place to use our expertise," he said. 
The agreement is subject to confirmation from Enron's partners that BG will be able to take over operating the fields, and consent from the Indian government. 
Analysts said the acquisition was a logical next step for BG and appeared good value against market expectations of a $600m price for the assets. 
Iain Reid of UBS Warburg said: "Either BG are extremely good negotiators or there is an element of risk attached to the speed at which production can be increased."

Abreast of the Market
Cisco, Extreme Networks Surge As Technology Stocks Lead Rally
By Robert O'Brien

NEW YORK -- As U.S. stocks staged their biggest rally since last spring, technology stocks were leaders on hopes that the extended period of fundamental deterioration might have begun to draw to a close. 
Cisco Systems, which traded at a 52-week low just last week amid dismal expectations for sales and earnings, finished $2.47, or 22%, higher at $13.95 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.
Other networking-products names also enjoyed some eye-catching gains. Extreme Networks jumped 1.42, or 22%, to 7.84. Foundry Networks climbed 1.04, or 16%, to 7.37. Ciena improved 2.52, or 27%, to 12.03. All trade on the Nasdaq. 
The gains came after Cisco's chief executive, John Chambers, told an audience at a broker-sponsored conference that the company felt comfortable with estimates for its earnings in the current quarter, which ends this month. 
The Nasdaq Composite Index, sparked by the bulge in technology prices, shot up 88.48, or 5.93%, the index's biggest one-day improvement since the spring, and the fifth-sharpest improvement this year, as well as the 14th-best one-day advance ever. The index finished the session at 1580.81, which is just above where it closed Sept. 10, the day before the terrorists struck the U.S. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which got a strong contribution from technology components like Microsoft and International Business Machines, climbed 173.19 points, or 1.93%. That was the ninth-sharpest one-day gain this year; the industrial average ended at 9123.78. 
"There was a real nice tone to the market today," said Pat Davis, head of Nasdaq trading at UBS Warburg, said. "But I don't think you can say we've heard all the bad news we're going to hear. 
Over the past three weeks, Wall Street analysts had been systematically reducing their earnings projections to better reflect the deterioration in economic conditions. Only over the past several days had they begun to focus on valuations, saying that, in some instances, stock prices looked attractive, even projecting weaker earnings. 
Lehman Brothers, for example, jumped to the defense of some software names, and a number of those marked improvement. Shares of PeopleSoft gained 3.14, or 15%, to 23.68 on the Nasdaq, a 50% improvement over its Sept. 27 52-week low of 15.78. BMC Software added 74 cents, or 5.8%, to 13.60. 
A number of storage-products makers marked sharp improvements, after Dain Rauscher Wessels insisted high-quality names in the sector would be able to realize earnings targets. McData, for example, rose 2.11, or 26%, to 10.15, while QLogic shot up 5.89, or 33%, to 23.96, both on the Nasdaq. 
Several other sectors of the market, including those that have suffered most in the days since the attacks on Sept. 11, managed to mount recoveries. Shares of Delta Air Lines gained 2.27, or 8.4%, to 29.36. Continental Airlines advanced 1.93, or 11%, to 19.32. AMR, the parent of American Airlines, rose 1.45, or 7%, to 22.12. 
Shares of several insurers moved higher on the prospects of higher rates. Ace climbed 5.41, or 19%, to 34.31. Everest Re added 5.24, or 7.6%, to 73.80. XL Capital advanced 5.05, or 6.2%, to 86.45. 
Nortel Networks wasn't punished for warnings that it would report a much wider loss in the third quarter than analysts had been anticipating. Nevertheless, the stock finished 25 cents higher, up 4.7%, at 5.54. 
L-3 Communications added 4.22, or 4.7%, to 93.60, reaching a 52-week high. The New York maker of defense communications products signed an agreement to acquire the Canadian aviation-services provider Spar Aerospace. 
Sun Microsystems moved up 99 cents, or 12%, to 9 on the Nasdaq. The Palo Alto, Calif., networking-products developer said it received a two-year, $100 million sourcing pact from News Corp. 
Qwest Communications, which slumped to a 52-week low Tuesday, gained 1.60, or 10%, to 17.20. CIBC World Markets talked up the stock, citing its valuation. 
Eli Lilly fell 3.62, or 4.4%, to 79.25. The drug maker warned that sales of its blockbuster antidepressant Prozac have eroded faster than expected after it lost its patent protection two months ago. 
Shares of several independent energy marketers moved higher, helped by comments from Salomon Smith Barney, which said the recent selloff in the group left the stocks at attractive valuations. Enron gained 2.88, or 9.4%, to 33.49, Dynegy added 1.66, or 4.3%, to 39.96, and Duke Energy gained 37 cents, or 0.9%, to 39.60. 
Best Buy rose 3.70, or 9.2%, to 48.80 in what proved a strong session for retail, after Credit Suisse First Boston called the Minneapolis retailer the best name in hardline consumer-electronics retailing. 
Shares of some real-estate-investment trusts weakened, following skeptical comments on earnings from UBS Warburg. Boston Properties fell 1.48, or 3.9%, to 36.37, Simon Property, Indianapolis, eased 20 cents, or 0.7%, to 26.90, and Apartment Investment and Management, Denver, lost 1.56, or 3.5%, to 42.80. 
Idec Pharmaceuticals advanced 2.12, or 4.1%, to 53.74, on upbeat comments Dain Rauscher made about the drug developer.

Enron to sell assets in oil, gas off India 
BG Group pays $388 million; power plant is still on market 
By MICHAEL DAVIS 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
British natural gas company BG Group has struck a deal to buy Enron Corp.'s offshore oil and natural gas properties in India for $388 million in cash, the companies said Wednesday. 
These properties are the last of the oil- and gas-producing properties Houston-based Enron retained after it spun off Enron Oil & Gas, now named EOG Resources. 
The deal marks another step for Houston-based Enron away from owning large physical assets. The company wants to focus on trading and making markets in a variety of commodities. 
It is "another significant step for Enron in selling assets not integrated into its wholesale or retail energy businesses," the company said in a written statement. 
Enron's other assets for sale in India include the controversial Dabhol Power Project, India's largest private power plant, in which Enron holds a 65 percent controlling stake. 
Reports surfaced Wednesday that Enron might be willing to sell its stake in the $3 billion project at a discount. Analysts have said for months now that Enron would like to exit the project but has been unable to find a buyer willing to make the right offer. Tata Power Co., India's largest private electricity firm, has acknowledged that it has held preliminary talks over Dabhol. 
The oil and natural gas reserves sale includes a 30 percent stake in the Tapti natural gas field and the Panna/Mukta oil and natural gas field 60 miles northwest of Mumbai and a 62.6 percent interest in the offshore block CB-OS/1 exploration license. All are on the west coast of India. 
Production from the fields is about 70 million cubic feet of gas and 8,200 barrels of oil per day. Reserves in the field are estimated to be 170 million barrels of oil equivalent. BG paid about $2.30 per barrel of oil equivalent. 
The other partners in the Tapti and Panna/Mukta offshore operations are Oil and Natural Gas Corp., which holds 40 percent, and Reliance Industries, with a 30 percent stake. The other partners in the CB-OS/1 license are Hindustan Oil Exploration Co., with 17.36 percent, Tata Petrodyne with 10 percent, and Oil and Natural Gas Corp. with 10 percent. 
Enron acquired its natural gas reserves in India with an eye to using them as fuel in the Dabhol plant. 
In August, Houston-based Enron said it and its other foreign partners were ready to sell their stakes in Dabhol for no less than $1 billion, an amount estimated to be sufficient only to cover their costs and direct financial investment in the project. 
Dabhol has been facing problems for nearly a year over high tariffs and payment defaults by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, its sole customer. It was forced to shut down its 740 megawatt plant on India's west coast in June after the board stopped buying power. 
John Ambler, Enron spokesman, would not comment specifically on any possible negotiations to sell the Dabhol project, but said the company favors selling its stake. 
"We continue to believe that the quickest and best approach for solving this issue is for the government of India and/or Indian financial institutions to acquire the foreign stakeholders in the plant," Ambler said. "We are continuing to pursue the legal remedies available to us under the power purchase agreement and are seeking a recovery of our costs." 
The shutdown has stalled an expansion program that was almost complete and would have raised the generating capacity at the project to 2,184 megawatts. 
Other partners in Dabhol include General Electric and the Bechtel construction firm, which each own 10 percent. 
The remaining 15 percent is held by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, the nearly bankrupt power distribution monopoly in the state where the plant is located. 
BG's existing interests in India include holdings in western Indian natural gas distributors Gujarat Gas Co. and Mahanagar Gas. The company is also working on a project to move liquefied natural gas from Iran via pipeline into India. 
India's gas demand is projected to grow by 50 percent over the next 10 years, while its gas production is declining. 


Edison rates to remain high under utility's deal with state
By KAREN GAUDETTE
Associated Press Writer

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Consumer advocates warn that Southern California Edison customers, already saddled with last spring's record rate increase until 2003, could face even more rate hikes in the months ahead. 
The deal secretly negotiated with the state Public Utilities Commission this week settles a lawsuit filed by Edison last November and is designed to keep the utility from following Pacific Gas and Electric, the state's largest utility, into bankruptcy.
It lets Edison pay off more than $3 billion of a $3.9 billion debt, in part by forcing ratepayers to continue paying higher rates imposed last May for at least the next two years. 
Consumer advocates, however, said Wednesday that other consequences of the state's power crisis could send rates higher still. 
The state's power-buying agency has yet to announce exactly how much money it needs from utility customers to repay the state for the billions of dollars it has spent buying electricity this year and to pay for about $43 billion of long-term power already contracted for delivery. 
The prospect of continuing to pay higher rates and possibly enduring even more price hikes in the future dismayed some Edison customers. 
"We can't stay in business," said William Ho, general manager of Top Hat Cleaners in West Hollywood, where the monthly electric bill has gone from $600 before the state's energy crisis to nearly $1,200. "We would have to raise prices, and we're already heading into a recession." 
Ho said Top Hat has tried to cut back on electricity use by shutting off display lights in the windows. But he added, "You can't press clothes in the dark." 
It's unclear how much more money ratepayers will be called upon to contribute without knowing how much the state needs to pay billions of dollars in power-buying costs, said Nettie Hoge, executive director of The Utility Reform Network, a San Francisco-based consumer advocacy group. 
Hoge and other consumer advocates said this week's deal amounts to a ratepayer bailout of Edison, which supported the state's failed deregulation plan. 
"It's like saying I'm not going to beat you any harder, so it shouldn't hurt," she said. 
John Bryson, Edison International president and chief executive officer, said the settlement would help the utility restore its good credit and repay its creditors. 
Edison owes nearly $4 billion to hundreds of power companies, ranging from energy marketing giant Enron Corp. to the state Independent System Operator, manager of the state's power grid. 
"The agreement means stability, predictability," he said during a conference call with reporters Wednesday. "It means preserving and enhancing the infrastructure of electricity that makes the economy of our region work." 
The PUC said the agreement would help the state begin pulling away from its role as a power-buyer. Commission President Loretta Lynch said the agency had little choice in figuring a way to let Edison repay its debts and avoid bankruptcy. 
"I think that this is a balanced compromise, but clearly it does allow ratepayers to pay off some of the back debt," she said. 
The state Department of Water Resources so far has spent $9 billion buying electricity for customers of Edison, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and San Diego Gas and Electric Co. 
The shareholder-owned utilities suffered huge losses by being unable to pass along soaring wholesale power costs to their ratepayers. The state's 1996 deregulation law imposed a price cap on energy rates paid by customers. 
That price cap was the focal point of Edison's lawsuit against the PUC, with the utility contending the state had no right to prevent the utility from passing the cost of energy to its customers. 
Under the deal struck this week, Edison also must direct its available cash and an estimated $1.2 billion it would have issued in shareholder dividends toward paying its debt. The utility could be due refunds ordered by federal energy regulators, and that money also would have to help pay down the debt. 
The agreement now goes before U.S. District Court Judge Ronald S.W. Lew in Los Angeles, who could rule on it this week. 
"Right now Judge Lew has his hands in the pockets of ratepayers. ... Will he pull out $3.3 billion for Edison or will he protect the working men and women of California who can least afford to pay a superfluous bailout tax?" said Douglas Heller of the Santa Monica-based Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, which organized a protest rally Wednesday outside the federal courthouse in Los Angeles. 
Heller estimated the settlement could cost Edison ratepayers $750 each over the next four years.

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- U.S. energy company Enron Corp.'s (ENE) Indian unit, Dabhol Power Co., has defaulted on interest payment of $24 million to Indian lenders for its Dabhol phase II project, reports Press Trust of India news agency. 
"DPC has not made interest payments due on Sept. 30 to its Indian lenders (comprising) both rupee and dollar debts for the second phase," a DPC spokesman told PTI.
The Indian financial institutions have a 62.04 billion rupee ($1=INR47.925) exposure to the 1,444-megawatt Dabhol phase II, which is 96% complete. Foreign lenders have an exposure of around $444 million toward the project, the report added. 
Dabhol is a 2,184-megawatt power project located in the western Indian state of Maharashtra. Enron holds a controlling 65% stake in DPC. Costing $2.9 billion, the project is the single largest foreign investment in India to date.

BG pays Enron pounds 263m for Indian oil and gas

BG IS TO BUY Enron's oil and gas assets off India's west coast for $388m (pounds 263m) in a move that will make the UK-based oil and gas producer the largest foreign investor in the country's upstream energy market. 
The deal will add 5 per cent to BG's total output, with 19,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, of which 60 per cent is gas. According to David McManus, BG's executive vice president, it will be earnings accretive from day one. "There is currently a deficit between the supply of gas, which is currently all indigenous gas, and the need for gas within India," Mr McManus said.
Some analysts see demand doubling over the next 10 years, making India one of the world's fastest-growing energy markets. 
The assets being sold by the US group Enron include a 30 per cent stake in the Tapti field and the Panna Mukta field north-west of Bombay. 
BG shares closed down 2.5p at 261p in a mixed oil sector after the news. Mark Redway, an analyst at Teather & Greenwood, said: "The logic is good and they're paying quite a low multiple at six or seven times last year's earnings, but [after the 11 September attacks in the US] there's a lot of investor nervousness at the moment over exposure to this part of the world."

India: BG India to buy Enron's gas, oil assets

10/04/2001
Business Line (The Hindu)

NEW DELHI, Oct. 3. BG India has entered into a conditional agreement to acquire Enron's offshore interests in the country for a consideration of $388 million. 
The contract signed on Tuesday night with Enron Oil and Gas India Ltd involves purchase of the latter's 30 per cent stake in the Tapti gas field and the Panna-Mukta gas/oil fields besides the 62.64 per cent interest in the CB-OS/1 exploration block.
Addressing a press conference here on Wednesday, Mr Nigel Shaw, BG India Chief Executive Officer, said that the sale was contingent on the other stakeholders agreeing to BG as the operator of the exploration fields. 
The rider of approval from other stakeholders comes in the backdrop of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), a 40 per cent stakeholder in the Panna-Mukta, Tapti fields, besides a 10 per cent stake in the CB-OS/1 exploration block, seeking operatorship of the fields. 
When contacted, the ONGC Chairman, Mr Subir Raha, said, "ONGC's position remains unchanged and it is still pressing for operatorship of the fields. We are currently in talks with BG on the issue." 
"We are in talks with the Government as well as ONGC on the issue. We are not contemplating a situation when operatorship is denied," 
Mr Shaw replied when queried on the issue. He stressed that in case the other parties do not agree, the deal will fall through. "We will walk away in such an event," he said. 
On the legality of ONGC's claim, Mr Shaw said, "under the agreement, at the point of change of control (from Enron to BG), the other stakeholders can object to the transfer of operatorship (to BG). However, the contract is not clear on the deadlock." 
Mr Shaw was hopeful that the transfer of shares would take place by the end of the month. 
Currently, in the Tapti and Panna-Mukta gas fields, Reliance Industries Ltd holds 30 per cent stake while ONGC holds 40 per cent equity. In the case of the CB-OS/1 exploration field, Hindustan Oil and Exploration Company holds 17.36 per cent, Tata Petrodyne 10 per cent and ONGC 10 per cent. 
The BG vision: BG plans to double the gas production capacity of the Tapti gas fields by 2004, according to Mr Shaw. Though not willing to reveal the quantum of investment in the future, he said that BG would be committed to its share in the expansion of the fields besides the exploration efforts on CB-OS/1 field where three wells are scheduled to be drilled in December. 
"There is opportunity for significant investment in the fields and one of the frustrations has been the lack of this." 
BG will be honouring the present gas sale agreement with Gas Authority of India Ltd (GAIL) which involves sale of gas at base load level for the life of the asset (exploration field). However, the venture will be free to find new markets for sale of any incremental gas recovered from the fields. Currently, the fields yield 70 million standard cu.feet of gas per day and 8,200 barrels of oil per day. 
BG has a 50 per cent stake in Mahanagar Gas Ltd, a gas supply company in Mumbai. Further, it is in the process of setting up an LNG regassification terminal in Pipavav. 
BG is not interested in buying out Enron's upcoming LNG regassification facility at Dabhol since it is setting up its own LNG regassification terminal at Pipavav, Gujarat, Mr Shaw said. 
Mr Shaw said that given the vast market potential and the dwindling recovery from the domestic fields, there would not be any conflict of interest between the gas sold from the LNG terminal and that from the exploration fields. 
On the pricing front, the Tapti and Panna-Mukta fields enjoy a fixed price contract till 2004. Beyond this period, the pricing is internationally linked. 
Once the deal is completed, BG India plans to initiate talks with Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) and ONGC to second their personnel at the operating level of the exploration venture, according to Mr Shaw. 
Further, it would minimise the involvement of its parent company in London as well as keep the number of expatriates in the joint ventures to a minimum. 
BG has so far invested $150 million in its ventures in the country.

Former Enron executive to head homeland security 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
Army Secretary Thomas White, a former Houston energy executive, has been picked to serve as the Defense Department's top official for homeland security. 
White will work closely with Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge, who was named by President Bush in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks to head a new Cabinet-level Office of Homeland Security. 
The new office will coordinate the efforts of more than 40 government agencies in tightening domestic security and rooting out terrorist threats. 
White was named to serve as the Pentagon's liaison by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld on Tuesday. 
White is a retired Army brigadier general who became the Army's top civilian executive in May. Before he was nominated for the Army post by Bush, White was vice chairman of Houston-based Enron Energy Services. 
"In the wake of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, homeland security has emerged as a paramount national priority," White said. "As the Department of Defense executive agent for homeland security, I look forward to working closely with Gov. Tom Ridge as he leads this vital effort." 
A 23-year veteran of the Army, White served as executive assistant to Gen. Colin Powell while Powell headed the Joint Chiefs of Staff under former President Bush. Powell currently is secretary of state. 


British Gas to buy Enron's oil, gas assets for $388 m

British Gas India today announced that it has reached an agreement to buy the assets of Enron Oil & Gas India Ltd for $388 million. The assets include a 30 per cent interest in the Tapti gas field and the Panna/Mukta oil and gas fields as well as a 62.64 per cent interest in a licence to explore the CB-OS/1 block. All three are located on the west coast of India and are operated by Enron. 
However, British Gas India chief executive officer Nigel Shaw said the deal is subject to the condition that British Gas gets operational control of the fields. "If we are not the operator, we will walk away from the deal," he said. The deal, signed in London last night, would require clearance from the Indian government. Shaw revealed that British Gas India has already initiated a dialogue with the government for this.
But the deal seems to have run into a roadblock even before the ink on it has dried. The state-owned Oil & Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) which has a 40 per cent interest in the fields is expected to try for the operatorship of the oil and gas fields which were earlier operated by Enron Oil & Gas. 
However, petroleum minister Ram Naik said "all issues will be sorted out in due course". "Enron today wrote to me to go ahead with the deal. We will examine the issue," he said. 
According to oil industry sources, the operatorship is based on a consensus_and not on the percentage of shares held_among shareholders. The proposed sale of Enron's assets does not "mean an automatic transfer of operatorship and the shareholders will have to come to a consensus," ONGC sources claim. 
What is more, ONGC had earlier unsuccessfully bid $350 million for Enron's oil and gas assets. ONGC has the first right of refusal, according to an ONGC official. ONGC chairman S Raha was unavailable for comment. 
Shaw admitted that the contract between the three existing partners does not lay down the course of action in case a deadlock emerges on the issue of operating the oil and gas fields. 
"We are in active discussion with both ONGC and Reliance. We are hopeful of wrapping it up by the end of this month," Shaw said. 
An ONGC official, however, said the state-owned company was aware of the development but had not been informed officially by Enron. 
Shaw also disclosed that British Gas was willing to make further investments to ramp up production at the Tapti and the Panna/Mukta fields. 
"Further investments have not happened as the partners could not agree. We are looking at the possibility of doubling production by 2004," he said. 
When asked what would be the investment required for such an exercise, Shaw said that it would run into hundreds of millions of dollars. 
The three oil and gas fields together produce around 300 million cubic meters of gas and 29,000 barrels of oil a day. 
An Enron spokesman refused to comment on the issue of operatorship as did a Reliance spokesman. 
Enron Oil & Gas has 30 per cent interest in the Tapti gas and Panna/Mukta oil and gas field, ONGC has a 40 per cent interest and Reliance has the remaining 30 per cent. 
In the case of CB-OS/1, the other partners are Hindustan Oil Exploration Company with 17.36 per cent and Tata Petrodyne and ONGC with 10 per cent each.

Drop in Natural-Gas Prices May Be Good For Consumers but Hinder New Production
By Alexei Barrionuevo
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

In the wake of last month's terrorist attacks, natural-gas prices have slid below $2 per million British thermal units, frustrating any hopes that prices will rebound this year to levels that would encourage more investment in natural-gas projects. 
Analysts predict that with prices at current levels, projects to bring more liquefied natural gas into the U.S. could be shelved or canceled.
Natural-gas prices, which reached highs of nearly $10 per million BTUs last December, had held to around $3 to $5 per million BTUs for much of the year. At $2 per million BTUs and below, producers have a hard time justifying exploration and new production. 
Analysts blamed the drop on weak industrial demand, fueled by the struggling chemicals and metals industries and by weaker electric-utility demand. Nearby November futures fell 36 cents yesterday to $2.208 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
In the Boston area, however, different concerns could lead to higher prices for that region. Last week, the U.S. Coast Guard, under pressure from local lawmakers, indefinitely banned LNG tankers from entering Boston Harbor. LNG makes up 15% of New England's gas supply and nearly half of its supply on very cold days. The Coast Guard and Department of Transportation are studying concerns that a LNG tanker could become a bomb for terrorists. 
Already, relative to other areas, natural-gas prices have inched higher in New England, where natural-gas pipeline constraints have long hampered the market. The spread between prices in New England and the Gulf Coast widened last week by 30 cents to $1.30 per million BTUs, said a spokeswoman for Distrigas, a unit of Belgium's Tractebel SA. But the lack of LNG isn't likely to become a big issue until winter hits and natural-gas storage is used up. 
Richard Grant, CEO of Distrigas, says LNG has a 30-year safety record at the company's Everett, Mass., terminal. While LNG is flammable, he says it is unlikely to explode. He adds that "there are a lot of things being said right now that are just not factual. But until we answer the concerns, we won't be able to bring a ship in here." 
Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown was among several brokerage firms downgrading fourth-quarter projections for natural-gas prices last week. "Prior to Sept. 11, we were seeing signs that a lot of industrial demand was coming back," said Jay Saunders, a Deutsche Banc analyst. "But all that is out the window now." Deutsche Banc is now estimating a 20% drop in winter demand in the industrial sector, which accounts for more than a quarter of total U.S. natural-gas consumption. The slack demand has resulted in supplies that have practically overflowed storage, which is on pace to be full by the end of October. 
While prices that are close to historical levels are good for consumers, such low prices could scare many producers away from making investments to ensure future natural-gas demand is met. Lower prices have already led energy companies to slow their drilling and some firms, such as EOG Resources Inc., plan to moderate production in the next two months. Gas drilling-rig counts fell to 953 last week from 1,030 at the end of August. 
Even with the increased natural-gas drilling of earlier this year, overall natural-gas supply is expected to increase just 1% this year, as the country's mature wells continue to be depleted faster than companies can replace them. The tight supply picture has analysts optimistic that prices will rebound next year amid lower interest rates, increased defense and relief spending and returning consumer confidence. 
Still, the downturn could cause some firms to rethink or postpone projects to import gas in a liquid form. With prices high last winter, El Paso Corp. and Enron Corp., among others, said they would build a dozen or so receiving terminals for liquefied natural gas, which is gas compressed and frozen to minus-260 degrees Fahrenheit. "You will see some cancellations and some delays," predicts Marshall Adkins, an analyst with Raymond James & Associates in Houston. 
Natural-gas prices need to average $3 per million BTUs on the East Coast and $3.50 on the West Coast to justify bringing in LNG to those areas, said Ronald Barone, an analyst with UBS Warburg. 
A spokeswoman for El Paso, Houston, says the company is moving forward with at least three terminals for the U.S. market. Enron said it is also pushing ahead with a terminal in the Bahamas that would pipe the gas to Florida starting in 2004.

Enron leases part of Mumbai estate to Citibank

Copyright (c) Business Standard

After months of scouting for a buyer for its one lakh square feet office space at Wockhardt Towers in Bandra-Kurla Complex, Enron has been able lease out 10,000 square feet of it to Citibank NA. 
Against an expected realisation from Rs 130 crore for the outright sale of its four floors, Enron will get around Rs 1.2 crore a year by leasing out one floor to Citibank.
The deal was struck recently by the global real estate consultant, Cushman & Wakefield, at a monthly rental of Rs 100 per square foot. 
With property prices in Mumbai having slumped and with no reprieve expected in the 
short run, companies are increasingly opting to lease space instead of blocking funds in illiquid assets. 
Property consultants say that if Enron manages to lease out the entire four floors, it will be easier for it to sell the property to a buyer, as the buyer would be assured of a fixed income. 
Enron had eyed a deal of Rs 130 crore when it mandated global real estate consultants to sell the premises at around Rs 12,000 per square foot. 
This is despite the fact that real estate at Bandra Kurla currently fetches Rs 8,000 to Rs 9,000 per square feet. In June 2000, the US energy giant had shelled out Rs 125.75 crore when it acquired the four floors, plus car park space, from Wockhardt, the pharmaceutical company. 
The deal was struck at Rs 10,500 per sq ft, and included parking space for 101 cars. 
Industry sources said that Enron had spent a sum close to Rs 150 crore to acquire the property, and pay for the interior furnishings of two of the four floors it had acquired. 
In order for it to break even, it would have had to sell its real estate at the rate of Rs 13,000 per square foot. 
Four to five global real estate consultants have been appointed by Enron for the sale of its premises. A leading consultant said that it has been difficult to find any buyers for such a large property. 
"Most international buyers prefer to take property on lease instead of an outright purchase," he added. 
Moreover, the inefficiency of the building in terms of the super built-up area is another reason why corporate entities are not too eager to acquire the premises, and Enron's proposition continues to go abegging, said the consultant.

Carly Fiorina Tops FORTUNE's List of 50 Most Powerful Women in Business for Fourth Year

10/01/2001
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 1, 2001-- 

Lower-Profile Women Topple More Well-known Names From Tech and
Internet Sector; Ranking Includes 14 Newcomers 

Though Hewlett-Packard lost $65 billion in market value in a year, CEO Carly Fiorina hasn't lost her nerve, and for the fourth consecutive year holds the No. 1 position on FORTUNE's ranking of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business. 
The complete list and accompanying stories are in the October 15 issue of FORTUNE, available on newsstands October 8 and at www.fortune.com at 12:00 p.m. on October 1. 
In the No. 2 spot is eBay CEO Meg Whitman, who runs an Internet company that actually makes money: $85 million in the last four quarters on $582 million in revenue. Oprah Winfrey, the Queen of Media, is mightier than ever, and holds the No. 3 spot, up from No. 15 last year. She produces movies, brings comfort and advice to millions of TV viewers, propels books to bestsellerdom, and, last year, teamed up with Hearst Magazines' Cathie Black (No. 28 on the list) to publish O, The Oprah Magazine-by some measures the most successful magazine startup ever. At No. 4 is Andrea Jung, Chairman and CEO of Avon, who has breathed life into ailing Avon. Mirant CEO Marce Fuller-the only newcomer in the top five-holds the No. 5 position. Inside a stodgy utility, Southern, Fuller built a high-growth trading and marketing unit, which was spun off in April. 
In these new, more tempered times, patience may be about to reap its reward. In FORTUNE's annual survey of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business, there is a clear emergence of women who came to power slowly. Says FORTUNE senior writer Pattie Sellers in "Patient But Not Passive," the story that accompanies the list, "By patience, we mean staying with a company, steadily building influence there, and rising to power through determination and insider knowledge, not promises and self-promotion." 
Fiorina, who has claimed the top spot each year since FORTUNE's inaugural list in 1998, heads the biggest company ($48 billion in revenues last year) run by a woman. And she is still as audacious and impatient as ever. Wall Street practically heckled her latest move-a bold bet to buy Compaq-but Fiorina, 47, remains defiant. In difficult times, "people who drive change are the subject of great scrutiny," she says. 
As always, the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time. Last year, power resided in the technology and Internet sectors, but that influence was fleeting. Gone from the list this year: Deborah "Hurricane Debby" Hopkins, who pushed her agenda too ambitiously at Lucent and lost her CFO job in May; Ellen Hancock, who failed at the startup, Exodus; and Morgan Stanley's Mary Meeker, who influenced so many to buy into the Internet fizz. But one Web warrior looks better than ever: Meg Whitman, No. 2 on the list. She has never overpromised to investors; instead she has diligently delivered above-target profits every single quarter. 
Fourteen newcomers join the list this year: Marce Fuller, President & CEO, Mirant; Louise Kitchen, COO, Enron Americas; Colleen Barrett, President & COO, Southwest Airlines; Betsy Bernard, President & CEO, AT&T Consumer; Anne Stevens, VP, North America Vehicle Operations, Ford Motor; Maria Elena Lagomasino, Chairman & CEO, J. P. Morgan Private Bank; Susan Desmond-Hellman, EVP and Chief Medical Officer, Genentech; Janet Robinson, SVP, Newspaper Operations, New York Times Co.; Carol Tomi, EVP and CFO, Home Depot; Carrie Cox, EVP and President, Global Prescriptions, Pharmacia; Carole Black, President and CEO, Lifetime Television Networks; Janet Davidson, Group President, Integrated Network Solutions, Lucent; Larree Renda, EVP, Retail Operations, Safeway; and Louise Francesconi, VP and GM, Missile Systems, Raytheon. 
While the economy and its points of power change, the criteria we use to evaluate power remains the same. Says Sellers: "We consider the size and importance of a woman's business in the global economy, her clout inside her company, and the arc of her career-where she has been and where she is likely to go. When appropriate, we also weigh the woman's influence on mass culture and society. That factor lifts Oprah Winfrey to No. 3 on this year's list." The shifts on our list this year are dramatic, with 14 newcomers. But one trend is especially intriguing: Women are taking on bigger businesses than ever. A few years ago, responsibility for a $3 billion business almost automatically earned a woman a spot on this list. No more. This year's FORTUNE 50 includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of $20 billion or more, which is a first. 
In a related story, "It Took a Lady To Save Avon," Katrina Brooker looks at Andrea Jung, Chairman and CEO of Avon. Says Brooker, "Jung knows what women want and how to sell it to them. And that's what has made her one of the most successful CEOs-male or female-in recent years." Over the past 20 months she has overhauled nearly everything about the way Avon does business: how it advertises, manufactures, packages, and even sells its products, and she has done it not by abandoning the seemingly outdated Avon Lady, but by reviving her. The result: growth in revenues, operating profits, and operating margins. 
In addition, FORTUNE includes an international list of the 50 powerful women in business. The top ten, featured in the magazine, are Marjorie Scardino, CEO, Pearson (Britain); Anne Lauvergeon, Chairman, Areva (France); Mary Ma, Senior VP & CFO, Legend (Hong Kong); Marianne Nivert, President & CEO, Telia (Sweden); Lien Siaou-Sze, Vice President, Hewlett-Packard (Hong Kong); Patricia Barbizet, CEO, Artemis (France); Eiko Kono, President, Recruit (Japan): Belinda Stronach, CEO, Magna International (Canada); Marina Berlusconi, Vice Chairman, Fininvest (Italy); Christine Tsung, President & CEO, China Airlines (Taiwan). You can read about the other forty at www.fortune.com or in the international editions of FORTUNE.

Drop in Natural-Gas Prices May Be Good For Consumers but Hinder New Production
By Alexei Barrionuevo
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

10/02/2001
The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

In the wake of last month's terrorist attacks, natural-gas prices have slid below $2 per million British thermal units, frustrating any hopes that prices will rebound this year to levels that would encourage more investment in natural-gas projects. 
Analysts predict that with prices at current levels, projects to bring more liquefied natural gas into the U.S. could be shelved or canceled.
Natural-gas prices, which reached highs of nearly $10 per million BTUs last December, had held to around $3 to $5 per million BTUs for much of the year. At $2 per million BTUs and below, producers have a hard time justifying exploration and new production. 
Analysts blamed the drop on weak industrial demand, fueled by the struggling chemicals and metals industries and by weaker electric-utility demand. Nearby November futures fell 36 cents yesterday to $2.208 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
In the Boston area, however, different concerns could lead to higher prices for that region. Last week, the U.S. Coast Guard, under pressure from local lawmakers, indefinitely banned LNG tankers from entering Boston Harbor. LNG makes up 15% of New England's gas supply and nearly half of its supply on very cold days. The Coast Guard and Department of Transportation are studying concerns that a LNG tanker could become a bomb for terrorists. 
Already, relative to other areas, natural-gas prices have inched higher in New England, where natural-gas pipeline constraints have long hampered the market. The spread between prices in New England and the Gulf Coast widened last week by 30 cents to $1.30 per million BTUs, said a spokeswoman for Distrigas, a unit of Belgium's Tractebel SA. But the lack of LNG isn't likely to become a big issue until winter hits and natural-gas storage is used up. 
Richard Grant, CEO of Distrigas, says LNG has a 30-year safety record at the company's Everett, Mass., terminal. While LNG is flammable, he says it is unlikely to explode. He adds that "there are a lot of things being said right now that are just not factual. But until we answer the concerns, we won't be able to bring a ship in here." 
Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown was among several brokerage firms downgrading fourth-quarter projections for natural-gas prices last week. "Prior to Sept. 11, we were seeing signs that a lot of industrial demand was coming back," said Jay Saunders, a Deutsche Banc analyst. "But all that is out the window now." Deutsche Banc is now estimating a 20% drop in winter demand in the industrial sector, which accounts for more than a quarter of total U.S. natural-gas consumption. The slack demand has resulted in supplies that have practically overflowed storage, which is on pace to be full by the end of October. 
While prices that are close to historical levels are good for consumers, such low prices could scare many producers away from making investments to ensure future natural-gas demand is met. Lower prices have already led energy companies to slow their drilling and some firms, such as EOG Resources Inc., plan to moderate production in the next two months. Gas drilling-rig counts fell to 953 last week from 1,030 at the end of August. 
Even with the increased natural-gas drilling of earlier this year, overall natural-gas supply is expected to increase just 1% this year, as the country's mature wells continue to be depleted faster than companies can replace them. The tight supply picture has analysts optimistic that prices will rebound next year amid lower interest rates, increased defense and relief spending and returning consumer confidence. 
Still, the downturn could cause some firms to rethink or postpone projects to import gas in a liquid form. With prices high last winter, El Paso Corp. and Enron Corp., among others, said they would build a dozen or so receiving terminals for liquefied natural gas, which is gas compressed and frozen to minus-260 degrees Fahrenheit. "You will see some cancellations and some delays," predicts Marshall Adkins, an analyst with Raymond James & Associates in Houston. 
Natural-gas prices need to average $3 per million BTUs on the East Coast and $3.50 on the West Coast to justify bringing in LNG to those areas, said Ronald Barone, an analyst with UBS Warburg. 
A spokeswoman for El Paso, Houston, says the company is moving forward with at least three terminals for the U.S. market. Enron said it is also pushing ahead with a terminal in the Bahamas that would pipe the gas to Florida starting in 2004.

Enron leases part of Mumbai estate to Citibank
Freny Patel MUMBAI

Business Standard

Copyright (c) Business Standard

After months of scouting for a buyer for its one lakh square feet office space at Wockhardt Towers in Bandra-Kurla Complex, Enron has been able lease out 10,000 square feet of it to Citibank NA. 
Against an expected realisation from Rs 130 crore for the outright sale of its four floors, Enron will get around Rs 1.2 crore a year by leasing out one floor to Citibank.
The deal was struck recently by the global real estate consultant, Cushman & Wakefield, at a monthly rental of Rs 100 per square foot. 
With property prices in Mumbai having slumped and with no reprieve expected in the 
short run, companies are increasingly opting to lease space instead of blocking funds in illiquid assets. 
Property consultants say that if Enron manages to lease out the entire four floors, it will be easier for it to sell the property to a buyer, as the buyer would be assured of a fixed income. 
Enron had eyed a deal of Rs 130 crore when it mandated global real estate consultants to sell the premises at around Rs 12,000 per square foot. 
This is despite the fact that real estate at Bandra Kurla currently fetches Rs 8,000 to Rs 9,000 per square feet. In June 2000, the US energy giant had shelled out Rs 125.75 crore when it acquired the four floors, plus car park space, from Wockhardt, the pharmaceutical company. 
The deal was struck at Rs 10,500 per sq ft, and included parking space for 101 cars. 
Industry sources said that Enron had spent a sum close to Rs 150 crore to acquire the property, and pay for the interior furnishings of two of the four floors it had acquired. 
In order for it to break even, it would have had to sell its real estate at the rate of Rs 13,000 per square foot. 
Four to five global real estate consultants have been appointed by Enron for the sale of its premises. A leading consultant said that it has been difficult to find any buyers for such a large property. 
"Most international buyers prefer to take property on lease instead of an outright purchase," he added. 
Moreover, the inefficiency of the building in terms of the super built-up area is another reason why corporate entities are not too eager to acquire the premises, and Enron's proposition continues to go abegging, said the consultant.

Carly Fiorina Tops FORTUNE's List of 50 Most Powerful Women in Business for Fourth Year

10/01/2001
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 1, 2001-- 

Lower-Profile Women Topple More Well-known Names From Tech and
Internet Sector; Ranking Includes 14 Newcomers 

Though Hewlett-Packard lost $65 billion in market value in a year, CEO Carly Fiorina hasn't lost her nerve, and for the fourth consecutive year holds the No. 1 position on FORTUNE's ranking of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business. 
The complete list and accompanying stories are in the October 15 issue of FORTUNE, available on newsstands October 8 and at www.fortune.com at 12:00 p.m. on October 1. 
In the No. 2 spot is eBay CEO Meg Whitman, who runs an Internet company that actually makes money: $85 million in the last four quarters on $582 million in revenue. Oprah Winfrey, the Queen of Media, is mightier than ever, and holds the No. 3 spot, up from No. 15 last year. She produces movies, brings comfort and advice to millions of TV viewers, propels books to bestsellerdom, and, last year, teamed up with Hearst Magazines' Cathie Black (No. 28 on the list) to publish O, The Oprah Magazine-by some measures the most successful magazine startup ever. At No. 4 is Andrea Jung, Chairman and CEO of Avon, who has breathed life into ailing Avon. Mirant CEO Marce Fuller-the only newcomer in the top five-holds the No. 5 position. Inside a stodgy utility, Southern, Fuller built a high-growth trading and marketing unit, which was spun off in April. 
In these new, more tempered times, patience may be about to reap its reward. In FORTUNE's annual survey of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business, there is a clear emergence of women who came to power slowly. Says FORTUNE senior writer Pattie Sellers in "Patient But Not Passive," the story that accompanies the list, "By patience, we mean staying with a company, steadily building influence there, and rising to power through determination and insider knowledge, not promises and self-promotion." 
Fiorina, who has claimed the top spot each year since FORTUNE's inaugural list in 1998, heads the biggest company ($48 billion in revenues last year) run by a woman. And she is still as audacious and impatient as ever. Wall Street practically heckled her latest move-a bold bet to buy Compaq-but Fiorina, 47, remains defiant. In difficult times, "people who drive change are the subject of great scrutiny," she says. 
As always, the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time. Last year, power resided in the technology and Internet sectors, but that influence was fleeting. Gone from the list this year: Deborah "Hurricane Debby" Hopkins, who pushed her agenda too ambitiously at Lucent and lost her CFO job in May; Ellen Hancock, who failed at the startup, Exodus; and Morgan Stanley's Mary Meeker, who influenced so many to buy into the Internet fizz. But one Web warrior looks better than ever: Meg Whitman, No. 2 on the list. She has never overpromised to investors; instead she has diligently delivered above-target profits every single quarter. 
Fourteen newcomers join the list this year: Marce Fuller, President & CEO, Mirant; Louise Kitchen, COO, Enron Americas; Colleen Barrett, President & COO, Southwest Airlines; Betsy Bernard, President & CEO, AT&T Consumer; Anne Stevens, VP, North America Vehicle Operations, Ford Motor; Maria Elena Lagomasino, Chairman & CEO, J. P. Morgan Private Bank; Susan Desmond-Hellman, EVP and Chief Medical Officer, Genentech; Janet Robinson, SVP, Newspaper Operations, New York Times Co.; Carol Tomi, EVP and CFO, Home Depot; Carrie Cox, EVP and President, Global Prescriptions, Pharmacia; Carole Black, President and CEO, Lifetime Television Networks; Janet Davidson, Group President, Integrated Network Solutions, Lucent; Larree Renda, EVP, Retail Operations, Safeway; and Louise Francesconi, VP and GM, Missile Systems, Raytheon. 
While the economy and its points of power change, the criteria we use to evaluate power remains the same. Says Sellers: "We consider the size and importance of a woman's business in the global economy, her clout inside her company, and the arc of her career-where she has been and where she is likely to go. When appropriate, we also weigh the woman's influence on mass culture and society. That factor lifts Oprah Winfrey to No. 3 on this year's list." The shifts on our list this year are dramatic, with 14 newcomers. But one trend is especially intriguing: Women are taking on bigger businesses than ever. A few years ago, responsibility for a $3 billion business almost automatically earned a woman a spot on this list. No more. This year's FORTUNE 50 includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of $20 billion or more, which is a first. 
In a related story, "It Took a Lady To Save Avon," Katrina Brooker looks at Andrea Jung, Chairman and CEO of Avon. Says Brooker, "Jung knows what women want and how to sell it to them. And that's what has made her one of the most successful CEOs-male or female-in recent years." Over the past 20 months she has overhauled nearly everything about the way Avon does business: how it advertises, manufactures, packages, and even sells its products, and she has done it not by abandoning the seemingly outdated Avon Lady, but by reviving her. The result: growth in revenues, operating profits, and operating margins. 
In addition, FORTUNE includes an international list of the 50 powerful women in business. The top ten, featured in the magazine, are Marjorie Scardino, CEO, Pearson (Britain); Anne Lauvergeon, Chairman, Areva (France); Mary Ma, Senior VP & CFO, Legend (Hong Kong); Marianne Nivert, President & CEO, Telia (Sweden); Lien Siaou-Sze, Vice President, Hewlett-Packard (Hong Kong); Patricia Barbizet, CEO, Artemis (France); Eiko Kono, President, Recruit (Japan): Belinda Stronach, CEO, Magna International (Canada); Marina Berlusconi, Vice Chairman, Fininvest (Italy); Christine Tsung, President & CEO, China Airlines (Taiwan). You can read about the other forty at www.fortune.com or in the international editions of FORTUNE.
