We have a shirt and we really want her to be a part of the team- I know that
the format -- with practices with 2 teams combined with Spring Break and bad
weather have made it a little difficult to have the same feeling that we all
did with our little micro teams but I know she would like the other girls on
the team and have fun! I'll make sure Roy brings her shirt to practice on
Thursday. Thanks for letting me know about this and we''ll work together to
amok this fun for her! Kathy

Whoops!  I goofed.  The transport deduct on gross volumes (including fuel 
value) is $.2602.  The transport deduct on net volumes is $.2422.

Sorry for the confusion.

Susan,

How have you come with the question I (actually the producer) had about the
contracts, and being able to change some of the lanuage.  They are looking
to be up and running in the next two weeks.

I'll give you a call tomorrow sometime.

Ok, here's the plan.....

Kali and Michael will leave for Brazil with y'all on Wed. the 27th on the 
evening flight (?).  Let me know the exact Continental flight number so we 
can make the reservations.  We'll get the seat assignments coordinated later 
I guess.

Renato and I will take a flight out of Houston on the evening of July 6, 
arriving Saturday morning.   The four of us will return to Houston on the 
next Fri. night flight (13th).  I think we've decided not to go to Foz do 
Iguacu, since we have so little time.  Instead, we'd like to go to Rio for a 
few days.  Can we all go together and drive.  Maybe you could get hotel 
reservations there?

Let me know what you think.   We're excited about the trip.  The kids can't 
wait.

Susan

We will not be settling the El Paso/Stingray imbalance.  El Paso insists on 
being paid back in kind, as opposed to cashing out at prices when the 
imbalance occurred.  We'll just carry the imbalance on our books.  Maybe 
we'll pay it back next year.

Thanks,

Same transport & fuel deductions.

As for the BTU issue, Joe has talked with the Destin people several times

out.  Joe will call again today.  Sorry about the delay, but we really have

I reconciled the imbalance between Stingray and LRP, but as to who approached 
who first, I don't remember.  It was my job to resolve all imbalance 
discrepancies on LRP, and then give my findings to commercial.  As I was 
working with Sherryl Cranford at Stingray, she made it clear that they were 
anxious to get the imbalances resolved and settled as well, and that was the 
only imbalance we discussed.  I think Sherryl and I agreed to that imbalance 
sometime in september.  Whether or not they've been asking for the gas back 
since February, I don't know because I didn't deal with LRP companies until 
several months later.

Leslie-

When did we agree with El Paso/Stingray on the 11,973 dth owed to Stingray?  
Have they been asking for this gas back since February?  Did you approach 
them first on settling this?  The reason I'm asking these questions is that 
HPL had a big imbalance due them from an El Paso operated line in Texas.  HPL 
had been asking for the gas back from the beginning and El Paso finally paid 
them back in kind this month.  I do not want to pay Stingray back in kind.  I 
want to pay them Feb. 2000 IF NGPL-LA.

There are several little features that EOL traders such as myself would like 
to see on the website and stack manager.  I realize that there may be bigger 
issues being worked on currently, but would it be possible for EOL to survey 
Enron traders as well as outside traders on suggestions for enhancements??  
For example, I'd like to be able to sort completed trades by date on stack 
manager.  Also, it would be nice if we could have a shading feature on the 
website, so people could shade products different colors.  This might cut 
down on trades made in error.

Thanks,

Jan-

I checked the website for the hotels at Foz.  The tourism website is down.  
It looks like  a great place.  I'll have to convince Renato to go (you know, 
he might miss out on working out for one day).  I think the kids might like 
it too.  Did Alexia and Sebastien like it or was it too much walking?  I 
asked my boss about it.  He went with his family when he was living in 
Argentina.  They really enjoyed it.  Can you go ahead and check on flights 
and which hotel to stay at?  The Hotel Colonial Iguacu e Spa looked like the 
nicer one on the internet.  I imagine the flights will be cheaper booking 
them there.  Is that right?  Let me know the airline and I'll check here.  I 
guess we would go on July 4 and return on July 5.  Also, would y'all want to 
go as well?

Thanks for your help.

Susan

We were allocated a total of 7591 mmbtu at the receipt point for November.  I 
think our contract for November is at the average of the Inside FERC  
postings for the three pipes plus a penny.  Those prices are as follows:

Transco Zone 3  $4.51
Florida Zone 3    $4.45
Sonat                      $4.47
Avg                        $4.4767  +  0.01 = $4.4867 

The same transport fee and fuel percentage as last month should be deducted 
from this price.  I think the allocated fuel was 23 mmbtu.
 
Also, keep in mind that we scheduled 31,112 mmbtu per Rebel's directions.  
ENA will have to cash out the difference with Destin (at higher prices!).

Thanks,

Susan Pereira

Susan,

Do you have any idea when we will receive volumes and pricing for the Bazor
Ridge Gas Plant for November?  If I need to contact someone else concerning
these issues please let me know.

Sorry about that! I've been sick and I guess I forgot. We had the show last
weekend so it was pretty hectic around here too.

This weekend, Sat or Sun at 3PM should be fine. Let me know which works for
you.
I don't want to promise too far in advance because of the erratic party
schedule.

Thanks for your help.  It sounds like your girl scout outings are a little 
more exotic than ours.  Our last event was an overnight campout in one of the 
girls' backyards.  The girls had a lot of fun.  I was lucky and didn't have 
to volunteer.  Michael got to be an only child for the night and got all the 
attention.  He loves it when Kali spends the night away!!

Talk to you soon.

Susan

Hi Susan,
??? Glad you guys are going to  Foz, I think you'll really enjoy it.? Don't 
worry about giving me your  credit card number, etc.? It will be easier for 
me to pay for it from here  and then you can just reimburse us.? In fact, you 
can give a check to Papi  and he can deposit it for us there.
??? I'm taking the Girl Scouts on  an all day outing today to an indian 
village so I won't talk with the travel  agent today.? However,? I'll call 
her and then tomorrow go by and  finalize everything.? Afterwards I'll send 
you all of the  details.
??? Hope your week goes  well.......give the kids a big hug.
??? Jan
?
PS? Just a reminder to get your visas, I  don't know if you have done that 
already.
???  tchau..........

Susan,

Jane Saladino, an accountant with Enron, called the EOTT accountant to let
her know that the transportation on Bazor Ridge should be $.25, rather than
$.24.  Is this correct?

Susan and John:

Staff would like to reschedule the tentative Tuesday P & Z meeting.

City council members are also set to meet on this date for a elevated
tower/cell tower workshop.

I had envisioned a 30 minute meeting with P & Z members to finalize the last
remaining item (driveway distance from right-of-way) at the Tuesday meeting
before council's workshop.

However, I have since received a letter and sketch from CenterAmerica
concerning the demolition of Weiner's.  CenterAmerica is proposing a 3 to 4
story development consisting of retail on the first floor and a self-storage
facility on the remaining floors.

Staff would like to begin discussion with P & Z on this CenterAmerica
proposed project.

Would you be available on either Wednesday (February 7) or Thursday
(February 8) at
7:00 P.M. for a longer meeting?

Hi Susan,
??? Went by the travel agent's  today to see what she found for your trip to 
Foz.? I'm still waiting on  some confirmed prices but a strong estimate would 
be between R$1,000 to R$1,300  and depending on the exchange it would be 
between US$500 and US$650 per  person.? The price includes airfare, hotel 2 
nights, complimentary  breakfast all mornings, transport from and to airport, 
english speaking guide  and driver (he also takes you to the Argentina side), 
tours on the Brazil and  Argentina sides, boat tour at the bottom of the 
falls, and a tour of the aviary  of tropical birds of Brazil.? There's also a 
helicopter tour you can take  but it's not included in the price.? This is 
with TAM airline.?  
??? We would stay in Rio Sunday,  Monday and then on Tuesday you and Renato 
would leave Rio around 11am and arrive  in Foz around 2:30 and get to the 
hotel around 3:30.? You would spend all  day Wednesday there and leave 
Thursday at 3:30 to arrive in SP at  5:00PM.
??? When she confirms the prices  I'll send you all the details.? Until then, 
let me know what you think of  this so far.
?

Hello U of Chicago Recruiting Team,

I am about to bombard you with all of the resumes that have been submitted 
for summer internship with Enron..  We are needing to choose 12 candidates to 
invite, with about six alternates.  We are having two schedules which means 
that will be interviewing 24 people total.  The Career Placement office 
requires that 50% of you list be open for bid, therefore 12 candidates will 
be open.

I am going to forward the e-mails that have the resumes attached. Please 
review and choose 12 invites and 6 alternates.

I am also going to forward the teams commitment to participation as it stands 
so far.

We will be needing 4 interviewers day one and 2 on day two.

Let us try and meet on Tuesday to discuss the resumes.  We need to have our 
choices to the Career Placement Office.  Please let me know what time is good 
for Tuesday.

Thanks -=- Paul L.

Dear Mr. Junek-

Per Scott Goodell's advice, I am officially informing you that the CES 
offshore firm contract is now on your book.  Scott thinks that it is 
volumetric, so there should be no impact on you.  The wellhead desk will take 
this over as soon as their pools are set up on Col. Gulf.

Sincerely yours,

Susan (aka "the bitch")

I just spoke to Stacy Dickson and she confirmed that the contract was mailed 
out a week ago.  She will e-mail it to Molly and mail it again regular mail.
Sorry for the delay.

Susan,

I hear you are covering for Andy Ring the next couple of weeks.....

We only had two NYMEX match-ups for April, one with ABG Gas Supply (sitara 
#700336) and one with El Paso Merchant.
Andy entered them in Sitara, and I was able to find the deal with ABG Gas 
Supply, but can not find the deal with El Paso.
Could you or somebody in your group possibly find the relevant deal-number ?

I appreciate your help !

Regards,
Ellen

On your voice mail you said that the Gas Daily term was October 2000 and the 
Inside Ferc term was November 30, 2000 through February 28, 2001.  Should it

Good questions!  The volumes are at the wellhead, so the fuel volumes would 
need to be deducted.  Destin has changed their fuel to 0.003%.  As for the 
prices, the Sonat gas daily prices should be reduced by $0.24 /mmbtu 
transportation.

Let me know if you have any more questions.

Susan

Susan,

Please bare with me on these questions.  1)  Do the volumes have the 1%
fuel taken out?
                           2)  Do the prices have the transportation taken
out?

I assume somethings, but a thought best to ask.

Thank you,

Stevens

There was a small amount of gas sold from the Kahuna Gas plant in October.
I have spoken with Joe Casa with Enron and he is going to provide volumes.
Can you please provide me the October pricing or give me the name of
someone who can?

Hi Susan,
    I would think that 2 nights , 3 days is plenty for Rio.  We could arrive
Sunday  see Corcovado, P?o de A?ucar, Tijuca rainforrest, and a few outlying
beaches.  Then late Tuesday afternoon the 10th you and Renato could fly out
for Foz.  Depending on the flight schedules you may have to wait until early
Wednesday morning the 11th. I think that Tuesday would be better so you're
not feeling rushed, but we'll see what flight times are offered.  Spend two
nights at Foz and fly into SP late Thursday evening the 12th.  Hang around
the house on Friday, put your suitcases together and head back for Houston
that evening.
    Too bad you're not able to spend more time here, but given what time you
have I think you'll be seeing the two most interesting places in Brazil. All
of the others, Amazon, Pantanal, Bahia all take so much travel time to get
there that it's not even really worth the attempt to see them.   If you do
decide on Foz, don't mess with packing your coats, it'll be easier to borrow
some of ours.
    The travel agent is looking at fares, etc. so I'll let you know what she
finds.
I'll be in touch.............Jan

Jan-

I was looking at the wrong week.  Sorry, stress and sleep deprivation are my 
only excuses.  How much time should we spend in Rio?  Should we leave for Foz 
on the 11th?  I just heard about the Cataratas this morning from Scott Neal.  
That was the place he suggested and that sounds great.  I'll work on Renato 
when he gets back in town.  

Thanks,

Susan

Hi susan,
??? Glad to hear that you're  interested in the Foz.? I think it would be a 
great trip for you to take,  although I'm confused about the dates of the 4th 
and 5th.? Don't forget,  the six of us will be in Ilha de Comandatuba for the 
week of June 30 til July  7th.? If we stick to the original schedule we would 
all be getting into  S?o Paulo Saturday the 7th.? The driver would pick up 
you and Renato  and you guys would arrive at the house a few hours before 
us.?  
???? What could easily work  is for all of us to go to Rio on Sunday the 8th, 
spend a few days there and  then, you and Renato could fly directly to Foz 
from Rio and the kids and I would  drive back to s?o Paulo.? You guys could 
then fly into S?o  Paulo from Foz.
??? The hotel I would suggest at  the Foz is the Cataratas.? It's located 
within walking distance of the  falls on the Brazil side and set inside the 
national reserve forrest with all  kinds of walking trails.? They might offer 
a service to get to the  Argentina side of the falls, I'll check into that.? 
If not you just take a  taxi or car service.? 
??? When we went we stayed at  Mabu which had all of these thermal swimming 
pools, large grounds, pond  etc.? It was more for the kids to enjoy.? Our 
kids liked the falls but  after walking on one side of it had no interest for 
the other.........too much  walking.? It would be a nice get-away for the two 
of you I  think.
??? I'll check into flights and  hotels today and let you know what I find 
out.? I haven't heard much about  Hotel Conial Igua?a, I'll see what I can 
find on it here.
??? I'll be in touch  soon..Jan
PS? Let Renato know that just finished  having a workout room built at the 
house.? Also, he can enjoy some great  running in front of the beach while 
you're in Rio --?? so hopefully he  won't suffer too much withdrawal 
!.................have a good  one

Subject: Enron Center Garage

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being 
offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. 
Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an 
exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, 
will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

If the receivable is for ENA, it will have to be settled separately.  Andy 
Ring talks to Koch for day trading.  Maybe she could pursue this.

Kathy-

Thanks for the email.  Kali was not able to make last Sunday's game due to a 
schedule conflict that I had.  Plus, she will not go to the last game because 
her best friend's birthday party is at the same time.  I had her skip another 
friend's party to make the one game she did participate in (all the softball 
girls schedule their parties on Sunday so as not to conflict with those 
games!!).  If it's not too late, do not order a trophy for her.  She really 
was never much of a team participant.  I'm hoping her enthusiasm this fall 
will be like last fall and not this spring.  Thanks for all your help, time 
and effort.

Susan Pereira

P.S.-
Do you know who some of the U10 girls coaches will be??  Will you be 
coaching?  I did not sign up to coach because I may asst. coach my son's U6 
team.

Subject: FW: Project GEM/Windows2000 Deployment Migration


I wanted to take a few minutes to not only introduce myself, but also to 
inform you that ProjectGEM - the Windows2000 Global Enron Migration - is well 
underway and is now approaching your group to begin the initial steps of 
upgrading to this newer operating system.
 
Along with upgrading the O/S, Enron has also took the initiative to move over 
to Microsoft Outlook2000, for our messaging client.  This will provide more 
flexibility and ease-of-use for e-mail, calendars, contacts -- not to mention 
an easier medium to synchronize data to your handheld devices.
 
I would like to start the migration process first with visiting with each of 
you, going thru a 'profile process' that should last no more than 10-15min.  
Profiling can begin as early as tomorrow (4/17/01) - so here is what I ask of 
you:
 
*** Please reply to this e-mail with a date/time that I can stop by.  Being 
that most of you sit in the same, general location - I'm hoping this 
profiling process should take no more than a few days. ***
 
Feel free to e-mail/call me should you have any questions or any specific 
concerns with this process, as we strive to ensure the migration from WinNT 
to Win2K is a smooth, efficient one.



Thank you,

Kacee Downey

Roy Anne-

Will the last brownie meeting be on the afternoon of May 9?  We have early 
dismissal that day.  The recognitions for the cookie sale may not be 
available until the evening of the 9th.  I've emailed the coordinator to see 
if we can get them earlier.

Thanks,

Susan

Stevens,

Joe put a call into Destin today, but our contact was out.  Once we talk to 
the right person and find out exactly what needs to be done, I think we would 
be very interested in having Rebel draft the letter.  I'll let you know as 
soon as I know...

Susan

Susan,

I have told Rebel that you and I have discussed the BTU issue and the
complaint.  Harvey Petter with Rebel has offered to draft a letter.  Would
this be acceptable for you?  If it meets with Enron's approval it could be
sent by your office.  It might save you and your attorneys a lot of time,
but that is not how you might want to handle it.

Let me know.

Stevens

Susan,

We are getting very close to the start up of the Bazor Ridge plant.. When I
talked to you Friday, you were going to request that Stacy "generate the
paper".  Has this been done yet?  The invoicing does not appear to be an
issue any more, our controller would like us to invoice Enron and Rebel to
invoice EOTT on all products.  Also, I am assuming that you changed the
September pricing to Gas Daily, as you implied below, on August 25.  Right
now we are looking at a start up on the last 10 days or so of September.

If there are problems with any of the above, please call me a soon as you
can today at (601)969-1568.  I will be out the rest of the week.  If
anything comes up after today please contact Dan Cole at the same number.

Thank you,

Stevens

Stevens-

I've been trying to get in touch with our attorney Stacy Dickson to see if
the confirmation is signed.  The last version of the confirmation reflected
gas daily pricing for August and index pricing for Sept, Oct and Nov.  I
think we will need to amend this if the time periods are going to be
different.

I'll let you know when I hear back from Stacy.

Susan,

As I understand it (which could be dangerous), if it comes on in 1st, 2nd
week of September we have to use Gas Daily, is this correct?  Our comtract
calls for the time period to be 3 months, after the 1st day following the
first month of production.  This would carry the contract through,
December.

Also, the operator of Destin pipeline is still telling the operator of the
well that Enron does not have a shipping agreement in place.  I have told
them that Enon is telling us they are ready to recieve.

EOTT driver training has been rescheduled for the mornings of 9/5 and 9/6.
DuFore driver training has been rescheduled to the afternoon of 9/5.  I
expect to have residue gas for sale between 9/2 and 9/6, depending on how
well plant commissioning goes.

Let me know if you require any additional information.

Hi, Jan.  I hope you are all doing well.  Maman has updated us on your 
mother's condition.  I know it must be stressful, especially from long 
distance.  Kali liked her birthday gifts.  Believe it or not, we didn't 
already have the World Pup movie. We had rented it back in February and the 
kids liked it.

I'm not sure if you got my last email before we left on vacation, but I was 
wondering what your travel schedule was in June.  When will you be arriving, 
when will you be returning (Kali has warmed up to the idea of travelling 
without us on the plane), etc.  The earliest we could leave for Brazil would 
be the evening of Friday, July 6.  We would probably need to return to 
Houston by July 14.  Let me know how that sounds.  Also, if we need to 
reschedule for another time until you get things straight for your mother, 
let me know.  That's certainly more important.

Talk to you soon.....

Susan

Daniel Kieran with Cinergy/Producer's Energy called me because he wanted 
clarification on something in the contract.  He thinks were forgetting about 
the imbalance due LRP of 10,644.  I thought you said the reason the price was 
so low was because that imbalance had been taken into consideration, so in a 
sense we are netting the two.  Is this correct?  Also, was the Oryx imbalance 
of (770) taken into consideration in the agreement below?

Cinergy has agreed to settle the imbalance of 11,035 mmbtu owed them at 
$1.77/mmbtu.  Please prepare the paperwork showing us paying them $19,531.95 
to clear this imbalance.

Destin does not feel comfortable with volumes yet at your meter.  They are 
waiting for final meter numbers before allocating to our transport contract.  
That should happen some time next week.  We will send you those numbers and 
the prices once we receive the final allocation.

Can you please provide me the October pricing or give me the name of

I wanted to clarify with you the transportation costs on Destin.  The 
transportation rate is $.24/MMBtu and the ACA charge is $.0022/MMBtu.  This 
should be deducted from the net volumes received on our transportation 
contract.   The net volumes are the volumes allocated to our contract for 
redelivery after 0.3% fuel in kind has been deducted from the gross volumes 
at the receipt point into Destin.  If you bill us on gross volumes, then you 
must deduct the value of the fuel as well as the $.2422/mmbtu in 
transportation costs from the pipeline.  From my calculations, deducts from 
gross volumes would be $.258 in Oct., $.2556 in Nov. and $.2602 in Dec.   
Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks

Susan Pereira

Hi, Jan!  I don't know if you'll get this, but Maman said your email was back 
in business (my words, not hers!).  I asked the kids about going ahead to 
Brazil with y'all.  Michael will do whatever; Kali was a little hesitant.  
When do you think you'll be coming here and when do you think you'll leave.  
We'll need to coordinate the travel schedules.  We're going to use OnePass 
miles for at least two tickets, so we'll need to finalize things in early 
April to get seats.

Talk to you soon.

Susan

Kali Pereira was not able to make the lesson on Sunday the 21st due to car 
trouble.  By my calculations, she has taken 3 private lessons since and 
including Dec 31, leaving an $89 balance of the $170.  That would allow for 3 
additional private lessons.  What days and times will work over the next few 
weeks?  Saturdays and Sundays will work depending on the time.  After school 
during the week might work, with the exception of Mondays.

Thanks,

Susan Pereira

Scott Neal said the 4 of you were the best resources for the information I 
need:  a list of deals and counterparties that you do wellhead transactions 
with.  We are gathering this info in order to be able to accumulate position 
information related to wellhead deals.

Thanks for your help.

Hi, Elise.  Sorry to bother you, but when Kali was unwrapping her presents 
last night, there were two without cards or tags (probably lost in 
transit!!).  We narrowed it down to Laura and Sofi.  So that we can get the 
thank you notes correct, did Laura give Kali  a Skipper doll or a bath set in 
a blue bag?  Thanks for your help.

Susan

P.S.- We ended up selling 131 boxes at the booth on Saturday.

That sounds great!!  We're looking forward to the trip as well.  The kids are 
anxious to have Alexia and Sebastien here to play with.  I don't know if 
there are any activities in particular that Alexia and Sebastien want to do, 
but I know Kali and Michael would be happy just to play at home and swim.  
Mayba a movie or two.  By the way, we just saw Spy Kids for the second time.  
If it's playing down there, you ought to take the kids.  Alexia will 
especially enjoy it.

See you soon.

Love,

Susan

Hi Susan,
??? How's it going?? I  firmed up everything with the travel agent 
yesterday.? I still don't have a  price to give you because the hotel hasn't 
set one yet for the ground portion  (that's life in Brazil!), but it will be 
somewhere in the range that I had said  earlier.? 
??? Everything is all set and  reserved, and as soon as we have a price I'll 
purchase them.? So for the  time being don't worry about writing a check and 
I'll get back with you when  it's all finalized.? I'm really looking forward 
to having the kids return  with us and having you guys come down...it's going 
to be a lot of  fun!
??? Talk with you  soon..............Jan

Do you know if we have actually collected on the imbalance settlement 
payments from Koch and LIG?  Also, are we in agreement with El Paso on the 
Stingray imbalance volume (11,973 mmbtu due Stingray)?  I have a statement 
from El Paso showing this volume.  They want us to sign and return the volume 
statement.  

Thanks,

Ruth-

I went ahead and scheduled Kali to do the GSWEC camp the first two sessions.  
I've only put the deposit down, so I can get that money back if we decide to 
do the Blue Fox Farm camp instead.  Hopefully, we'll have that info the first 
week in May.  Marla is planning on signing up Blakely for the second session 
there, pending what the Blue Fox Farm schedule looks like.  I think Anna 
Edelman is also interested.  I left a message with Sue today letting her know 
that I was reserving a spot for Kali at GSWEC just in case the Blue Fox Farm 
doesn't work.

Thanks,

Susan

I was wanting to know what the imbalances are booked at.  Are they all 
mark-to-marketed or valued at some historical pricing?  Also, can you work 
with LIG on the paperwork for settling the imbalance?

Thanks,

You left me two messages yesterday.  One regarding Louisiana Intrastate 
paying us $3.00/MMBTU for their imbalance on LRP, but I don't remember what 
the other message was regarding.

The three indices are 9.81,9.89 and 9.97;  the average is $9.89.  So, the 
contract price is $9.89 + .01 less .2422 transport on the net of fuel 
volumes.  If you invoice on gross volumes you will need to deduct the value 
of the fuel (0.3%).

Renato and I are already signed up to work Kali's class booth and our son's

all afternoon at one booth, but if something changes I would be more than

Dear Second Grade parents, 

Our class booth is the pinata booth and the booth chair is Mary Rothwell. 
?As  
you may know, she is expecting a baby in early April. ?She is still willing  
to run the booth and prepare the pinatas before the fair but will need  
someone to help her that day since she will have her newborn with her. ? 
Duties would begin mid morning with setup and continue until 2:30 or 3:00  
with cleanup. ?During F& F hours from 11:00 - 3:00 her helper would need to  
help run the booth, hanging the pinatas from the tree, collecting tickets,  
etc. ?There are also several parent volunteer hourly slots that have not 
been  
filled - one slot from 1:00 - 2:00 and two slots from 2:00- 3:00. 

Could any of you help with any of this? ?If so, please email me and I will  
let her know. 

Thanks! 
Margaret Pierce 
Room Parent

I got the email you forwarded to me.  Have you responded to Suzanne 
Sugarbaker yet?  I would be happy(?) to talk with her, so please feel free to 
forward my email address to her.  If I don't hear back from you today, I will 
probably email Suzanne directly this weekend.  Maybe I can clarify a few 
issues with her.  As for Cindy Colvin's "presentation," I've spoken with 
Richard Rothfelder on how we might handle future situations like this.  In 
the meantime, I'm taking extra vitamins to thicken my skin.  

Let me know what responses you receive today on the RFP.  I know we will need 
to schedule a committee meeting in the next week or so.

Thanks,

Susan

P.S.-
Please email me back today at our home email address :

Koch has sent payments. LIG said they sent it but that was a month ago, so 
I've followed up and am waiting to hear from Bud Elkins.  That imbalance of 
11,973 due Stingray is correct but is no longer on LRP's books, it's been 
assigned to ENA.  Thanks.

Do you know if we have actually collected on the imbalance settlement 
payments from Koch and LIG?  Also, are we in agreement with El Paso on the 
Stingray imbalance volume (11,973 mmbtu due Stingray)?  I have a statement 
from El Paso showing this volume.  They want us to sign and return the volume 
statement.  

Thanks,

Leslie-

We will cashout the imbalance with the two Koch entities in the following way:

We owe Koch 11,885 mmbtu at $3.90/mmbtu, which equals $46,351.50.
Koch owes us 13,639 mmbtu at $2.21/mmbtu and 11,720 mmbtu at $2.38/mmbtu, 
which equals $58,035.79.
The net of these imbalances is $11,684.29 due to Enron.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I negotiated this with Scott Garrison 
at Koch.

Thanks,

Susan Pereira

So far you're only the second person who's asked  that, so I expect that I 
can get your troop's things sorted out on the 8th and  you could either come 
during the day to help sort or pick them up that  evening.?? I'm hoping there 
aren't any shortages on T-shirts,  etc.

Julie-

Is there any chance that the recognitions will be  available prior to May 9?
Our troop is having its last meeting before the  summer on the afternoon of
May 9.? Let me know if I can  help.

Thanks,

Susan,

I have Kali on our list for Sat the 25th. If you can, send a check for $27
and that will move you to the head of the list. Prepaid riders go to an
instructor ahead of "stand-by" riders. If you are unsure about whether or not
Kali wants to ride, wait to pay. There are no refunds or make-ups for prepaid
lessons.

donation, I'm glad we got it, because we ended up short on the cash collected

Hi, Elise.  Sorry to bother you, but when Kali was unwrapping her presents
last night, there were two without cards or tags (probably lost in
transit!!).  We narrowed it down to Laura and Sofi.  So that we can get the
thank you notes correct, did Laura give Kali  a Skipper doll or a bath set
in a blue bag?  Thanks for your help.

Susan

P.S.- We ended up selling 131 boxes at the booth on Saturday.

In the past, Jesse would let me know about our imbalance and cashout price.  
He would do the paperwork and trade out of the imbalance with another party.

Brenda,
Victor and I totally agree with you.  With the increase of wellhead 
production and swings that we are seeing, we are totally revisiting the way 
we handle wellhead.  Beginning with March we will be taking a closer look at 
what our production is doing and will enter appropriate cash out tickets on 
Venice.  

Just to let you know, we are going through the process of looking at wellhead 
production on all our pipes and at what is the best method to handle.

Venice invoices for cashout on a one month lag.  The February invoice cashed 
out the January  volume of <19,385> at $6.8121 for a total credit of 
$132,052.55.  The imbalance for February production is  <4455> and to trade 
the imbalances, VGS must be notified in writing on or before the 25th of 
March.

There are no cashout tickets for VGS on the CPR cashout reports that I ran 
for January and February production.  From looking back at several months of 
invoices, we appear to get cashed out every month.  Would it be possible to 
have cashout tickets entered for VGS?

If you have see any problems with the imbalance volumes reflected on the 
invoice, please let me know. 

Thanks,
Brenda

Hi, Jan!  I hope you are all doing well.  I'm sorry to hear that your mother 
is ill.  I'm sure it's frustrating to be so far away.  

I know you have other things on your mind right now, but I wanted to check 
with you about our visiting this summer.  We were thinking about the second 
week in July.  We have not made any definitive plans.  Let me know if that 
will work.  If this summer doesn't work, we can always try next summer...

Take care.

Looks fine, Jan.  Thanks for taking care of this for us.  Let me know the 
exact amount if the exchange rate changes.  I'll give a check to Papi to 
deposit in your account.  

I hope you are all doing well.  Maman told us of your struggles to get the 
medication you need.  I hope things work out.  How are the kids doing?  Kali 
and Michael are very excited that school is almost out--just two more weeks.  
They can't wait for Alexia and Sebastien to get here.

See you soon..

Love,

Susan

My understanding is that our deal converted to the average of three IF 
indices + .01 (less transport and fuel) effective November thru February.  

The November price would then be $4.4767 + .01 = $4.4867 less $.2422 less 
0.3% fuel.
The December price would be $5.9967 + .01 = $6.0067 less $.2422 less 0.3% 
fuel.

Please let me know if this is not your understanding.  Also, please keep in 
mind ENA has taken losses on cashing out negative imbalances on this 
production.

David-

If I want to communicate with the other commission members, am I supposed to 
funnel it through you?  If so, I want to find out if anyone is interested in 
setting up a table at the carnival (April 21) to solicit public opinion on 
P&Z issues.  We could set up next to the tree committtee or share a table.  
I'll be at the carnival until about 3 pm; however, I'll be working from 
12-2.  Also, we could solicit public opinion outside the clubhouse on 
election day, May 5.  I could do that anytime before 4 pm.  Anyone else 
interested???

Thanks,

Subject: Any Petal Gas Storage Issues?

As reported previously in the trade press, Petal Gas Storage has decided to 
build its own pipeline to connect its storage facility in Forrest Co., MS to 
interconnections with Southern Natural, Destin, and Transco in Clarke and 
Jasper Cos., MS.  We have received FERC's notice of the application (Docket 
No. CP01-69), and will be filing an intervention before the February 20 
deadline.  Southern Company Services has contracted for the full 700,000 
Mcf/day of capacity for a term of 20 years.  The project calls for about 59 
miles of 36-inch pipeline and a 9,000 HP compressor station at a cost of 
about $94,343,700.

As part of its application, Petal also submitted pro forma tariff provisions 
and rates for firm and interruptible transportation services and asked for 
authority to charge negotiated rates.  Petal also requested approval of 
certain deviations from the pro forma transportation agreement for the 
contract with Southern, apparently to allow Southern to act as agent for its 
affiliated operating electric utilities to apportion capacity among them.

Please advise if you have any issues with Petal that should be made a part of 
our intervention.  The certificate application is 635 pages, not including 
another 778 pages for the environmental reports, so I'm not going to request 
a copy unless someone indicates a desire to review it.

be possible to do the lesson earlier, like 11 am or noon?  Or, Kali has 
Monday the 19th off and could do a lesson anytime that day.

We've received the money from Cinergy and Koch for the cashout volumes, but 
I'm still waiting on Louisiana Intrastate.  LIG sent the check to the wrong

Kathy-

Just let me know when you get the trophy.  I can pick it up at your house 
(front porch or whatever is convenient for you) and leave the $$ in your 
mailbox.

You can send it to me at 1904 Albans 77005. It is small and very mailable.  
Kali is such a good player and sweet girl - I know she is going to have fun  
no matter what. I think we all are going to miss the Micro Soccer days with  
small teams and more of a chance to get to know everyone! Have a great  
summer! Kathy

Kali Pereira was not able to make the lesson on Sunday the 21st due to car 
trouble.  By my calculations, she has taken 3 private lessons since and 
including Dec 31, leaving an $89 balance of the $170.  That would allow for 3 
additional private lessons.  What days and times will work over the next few 
weeks?  Saturdays and Sundays will work depending on the time.  After school 
during the week might work, with the exception of Mondays.

Thanks,

Susan Pereira

Just want you to know I received and checked your  paperwork.? It's nice to 
get a head start on things, thanks!? I did  not find a T5 - which is OK as 
long as you hadn't turned one in with cash and I  missed it.
?
I did make a minor adjustment which you'll need to  know about when 
distributing the recognitions.? The donated box of cookies  had to be to be 
assigned to a girl, so I gave it to Kendra Muecke.? She  originally sold 49, 
and with the extra box, she is at the level to receive the  patch and face 
stickers. You'll get the extra patch and stickers kit with your  stuff in May.

Julie-

I left my paperwork in the green box at your  doorstep yesterday.? I wanted
to make sure you received it.? I'll  be out of town until March 25, so if
you have any questions, I won't be  able to respond until then.

Thanks,

Susan  Pereira

Thursdays at 6:30 will generally work for us; however, on Thursday the 15th 
we unfortunately have a conflict.  Can you send me the list of girls who are 
on the team?  I know Kali is curious whether she knows anyone or not. 

Thanks,

Susan

Sorry for delay, it's been real busy.? On the practice schedules, the only 
switch I have made is to put the 2? 7:40 sessions back to 5:30 to 6:30.? 
Assuming they will have smaller attendance, I am asking Nebo to only schedule 
1 trainer for each session.? We will plan on using half of the Pershing 
middle field unless the Pershing Large field is empty. 

See how this works, I am putting this into effect with Nebo's trainers unless 
I hear any objections by tomorrow evening.? Let's plan on charging $40 per 
player for the Spring, no matter how many sessions they attend.? And remind 
them that they can attend any day or session if they miss theirs.? If any get 
too crowded, we'll adjust the trainer situation. 

M? -?? U-6?? 5 teams 30 kids Pershing Large 6:30-7:40?? 2 trainers 
T?? -?? U-7B? 3 teams 18 kids possibly 1 U-8? 7-8 kids? Pershing L 6:30-7:40 
2 trainers 
T? -?? U-8G? 2 teams 20 girls? Pershing Middle 5:30-6:30? 1 Trainers 
W -?? U-6? 2 teams 12 kids U-7 G 4 teams 24 girls Pershing L 6:30-7:40? 2
