Mike - I'd suggest we move on any decon work for our facilities at the same 
time.....

The find of PCBs in the compressors will undoubtedly be the subject of next 
week's meeting.  The presence of PCBs does not limit their use at that 
station.  PG&E would be reluctant to move the engines around on the system.  
Depending upon the concentrations at the time, they may be restricted in 
their ability to sell or reuse the compressors.  I'm not aware of any true 
decon process for such equipment.  Vector may be able to propose a piecemeal 
decon project but it would likely be expensive and involve the outage of the 
equipment for a significant period of time.   We might want to gather a group 
of folks and go over the agenda and our pososible response to a request by 
PG&E to take down thier compression.

Subject: Additonal Information Concerning PG&E

On a related note, I spoke to Vector concerning the equipment which was 
suggested for cleaning on the PG&E system.  It is as follows:

 2 scrubbers, some underground C/S piping, filter separator, horizontal tank, 
2-10.84 drip locations

The Vector proposal for mobilization, demobilizataion and cleaning the above 
PG&E equipment will be approx. $ 75, 000.  

I approached Vector about the pipeline cleaning between our M/S and their 
C/S.  They quoted a turn key price of $34,000.  Because this piping belongs 
to Transwestern, we should contract this cleaning ourselves.  If the decision 
is made to address this cleaning, I think we would want to have it done 
during the same time period as the PG&E cleaning activities.  I will also 
need some lead time to notify Vector and determine an appropriate methodology 
to be used.  Vector apparently has an approved methodology for cleaning pipes 
to 36".  

One additional note, apparently PG&E has discovered PCBs in their gas 
compressors.  In wipe samples taken of the internal compressors PCBs were 
found at regulated levels.....

I just spent about 40 minutes on the phone with my counterpart discussing the 
upcoming meeting.   The call was cordial.  A couple of items that came up 
worth passing on are as follows:

 There is some expectation in PG&E to decon the compressors.  They may not 
wish to do so right now but maybe soon.  There is also discussion of these 
being out of service for up to a couple of months.  I passed along the idea 
that it is probably best to simply monitor the situation and the PCB matters 
may well take care of themselves through routine maintenance activities and 
continued operation.  No official decon processes exist as far as were are 
aware.  There are no restrictions on their continued use exist at that 
location.  PG&E may be considering employee exposure or continued source of 
contamination as issues why they want to decon. We should expect to this to 
come up during the meeting.  I do not think that this type of decon would 
necessarily be in line with the standard for reimbursement under our 
operating agreement - which is "reasonable action, measured in accordance 
with commonly accepted standards of care and practice in the natural gas 
pipeline industry in California."  I'm not aware of SoCal engaging in any 
such action even though their system was highly impacted by PCBs.   I did not 
bring this standard up but we should be aware of it and recommend monitoring 
before any decisions are made.  My counterpart did acknowledge that even when 
the Long Term facilities eliminated the delivery problem, that we may well 
have continued issues with respect to the PCBs in the station and the 15 
miles of pipe downstream for some lengthy period of time.  PG&E did not 
appear to be contemplating any pigging or decon of this section of the system.

 PG&E may be looking for some more comfort on the question of "source 
control".  We have said that this situation is relatively unique to the 
Topock Lateral but we have had some minor hits elsewhere recently.  We should 
be in a position to explain why the remainder of the system is not a problem 
and even if it should be why the Long term facilities should be able to 
handle any concerns.

There are two different sizes of filters at Topock

1.  At PG&E there is one 54 inch ID X 17'-6" Horizontal filter separator.  
This separator has 74 elements to it.  They are 4 1/2" OD by 72" long.

2.  At the Selexol plant there are two 48" IDX17"-6" Horizontal filter 
separators.  These separators have 52 elements to each.  They are the same 
size filter as above.

I will be sending a copy of the purchase orders these have all the 
dimensions.  One of these sheet show that the filter elements are 76" long 
this is incorrect.  They are 72" long.

We will talk to you later.  We will be on our way to Kingman in the morning.

pipe between our M/S and the Topock C/S, a decision has been made to postpone 
cleaning of his section of the pipeline.  should cleaning occur of this 
section, it is anticipated that it will not occur untill the installation of 
the filter separator at the PG&E C/S, sometime later this year.  Vector has 
been notified of this change in plans and will adjust their cleaning 
schedule  accordingly.

On tuesday of this week, Lou Soldano and I attended a meeting between the 
above referenced parties concerning the issue of PCB's which had migrated 
into the PG&E system.  Southwest Gas is a customer of PG&E's and recieves 
natural gas from PG&E for delivery to its customers,   PG&E has prepared a 
media statement which it is going to be sent out to those parties which 
receive gas from interconnects testing positive for PCBs.  As of today, only 
the customer base around Needles, California will see the PG&E statement.  

The two issues of note.  First, Transwestern was able to make some minor 
changes to the media statement to more clearly show in the statement that 
this release of PCBs was an isolated incident and that all parties are 
diligently incorporating measures to contain and manage this release.  
A copy of the revised media statement is available upon request  from Louie 
or myself. 

Second,   PG&E and Southwest Gas have jointly agreed to conduct immediate 
sampling activities at downstream interconnect locations on the Southwest Gas 
system to determine if the PCB's have spread into parts of their system.  
Results of this sampling will be presented in a meeting tentatively scheduled 
in a couple of weeks.  Transwestern will probably atttend this meeting.

Mike I wanted to give a short update on the latest events related to the PCB 
issue with PG&E.  Transwestern met with PG&E this last Wednesday with an 
agenda that included some sharing of sampling results collected downstream of 
their first C/S (Topock) and on out west toward their main distribution 
areas.  With respect to the most recent sampling data, Low PCB concentrations 
(N.D. to 38 ppm) have been detected in drips and interconnects between Topock 
and Hinckley C/S.  The good news is that PCB's have not been detected 
downstream of Hinckley which is approx. 160 miles from the Topock C/S.  PG&E 
has also initiated construction and installation of some drips and small 
separators at locations where their gas feeds into other lines or directly 
into customers.  the proposed installation date for the large mainline filter 
separators is still on target for 6/1/00.

Now for the bad news.  At the conclusion of the meeting, PG&E has stated that 
they want their Topock C/S decontaminated.  This includes all piping and 
equipment.  I stated to them the impractabibility and zero success rate of 
removing all the PCB's from their system and that there would be no 
quarantees that the deconning would be successful.   The contract PCB 
deconning companies only have permits which would guarantee cleanup to 10 
ug.  They were told that it would be impossible to clean everything and that 
in all probability the PCB concentrations would be showing up as the gas 
continues to move through the system.  Additionally, the better remediation 
approach would be to continue to remove PCB containing liquids at strategic 
locations.  Even with this, they were pretty insistent that their management 
wanted the facility cleaned.  Preliminary $$ estimates range to approx. 3-5 
million.

I think that this is only the "tip of the iceberg".  If they are successful 
with this action, the pipeline system will be next.  Their pipeline is not 
piggable and to make it such would require replacement of pipe, valves etc. 

Ill keep you informed on this,,,,,,,

Gents -  I say we go with it and present what we think is appropriate in 
Frisco and see what else they want.  There is something we filed with the EPA 
back in 1994 (I have a complete copy) and there is not a great deal of 
information after that since we have been dry.  

Larry & Butch - since we have to pull the info what do you think????

The pig that was run to PG&E on Monday came in dry with no liquids.  As you 
will notice there are a few new sample points with liquids that were 
accumilated.

Please see attached documents.

Mike, I spoke to Ralph and he gave me an open week of April 17th in San 
Francisco.  He thought that one day would be more that adequate.  I need to 
have somebody contact the PG&E side for their availablity during that week.  
Should I or someone else contact Rod Bosche or let Louie do this from his end 
with our legal contacting their legal? 

Some of the highlights that I had requested to Ralph for his presentation was 
the following:
 
  PCB's are a contaminant, just as benzene is, which occurs naturally in the 
gas.  Health issues of PCBs in pipeline are not a concern especially from a  
customer and employee standpoint (the name PCB lends itself to public outcry 
of the unknown)

 Removal of PCB's is best accomplished by managing liquids, not deconing

 Fiilter separators are a proven method of PCB removal

 Transwestern's proactive assistance with SoCal on their system to manage 
their PCBs

 Most pipelines on the east coast have PCB's and no adverse environmental 
impacts have occurred

I spoke with Ralph Komai, PCB expert for SoCal, concerning his availability

PCB's in natural gas pipelines.  He has stated that he would be available to 
do this as long as Transwestern picks up his expenses and hourly rate  
($200.00/hr).  As per your approval, Louie, I will inform Ralph that we are 
in agreement with his conditions and I will schedule a day when he would be 
available in California to put on the training for PG&E.

Larry,
I would like to know the results of such a test.  However, before I say "go 
for it" I would like to know how Mr. Soldano feels about it.  He has a better 
feel for the "politics" that might surround such a move.  Caveat:  Will you 
wear face paint and a green beret for this mission?  Just joking!  Let me 
speak with him first before you get my "final" answer.  Thanks for the 
reminder.  John

Subject: Kern River Tank Sampling

John and Lou,

As we discussed during our trip to the airport from the SoCal PCB meeting, I 
had mentioned that I would like to show up at the PG&E's Kern River I/C tank 
and do some liquids sampling.  Is this still a go?  I have discussed this 
with Randy Williams of our Needles team and I have requested that he found 
out the driving directions to the tank from someone on PG&E, particularily 
from someone at their Topock C/S.  I have asked him to casually ask for this 
and not make an issue of it.  Because the field probably is more layed back 
about this kind of stuff and not in the political center, it seemed like the 
right thing to do and would not raise any flags to PG&E.  

Let me know if you want me to proceed......

The topock Lat. is still dry as a bone at the Measurement station and at the 
SLX plant. See attached on liquids gathered for this months sample run. 
Results will follow as soon as the results come back. Thanks,

On a related note, I spoke to Vector concerning the equipment which was 
suggested for cleaning on the PG&E system.  It is as follows:

 2 scrubbers, some underground C/S piping, filter separator, horizontal tank, 
2-10.84 drip locations

The Vector proposal for mobilization, demobilizataion and cleaning the above 
PG&E equipment will be approx. $ 75, 000.  

I approached Vector about the pipeline cleaning between our M/S and their 
C/S.  They quoted a turn key price of $34,000.  Because this piping belongs 
to Transwestern, we should contract this cleaning ourselves.  If the decision 
is made to address this cleaning, I think we would want to have it done 
during the same time period as the PG&E cleaning activities.  I will also 
need some lead time to notify Vector and determine an appropriate methodology 
to be used.  Vector apparently has an approved methodology for cleaning pipes 
to 36".  

One additional note, apparently PG&E has discovered PCBs in their gas 
compressors.  In wipe samples taken of the internal compressors PCBs were 
found at regulated levels.....

Bill

Attached is the letter and analysis spreadsheet sent to Rod Boschee today. 
The letter outlines the additional interim steps identified at this weeks 
meeting. The letter also contains reference to a spike in the analysis 
results at Transwesterns Measuring Station filter separator. The split sample 
came back at this site at 216/185 PPM. We are making arrangements to have the 
sample rerun at another lab. All other analysis points remained consistent 
with last week. Lou Soldano advised me that since the spike occurred on our 
equipment, that it may not be worthy of my personal phone call to Rod.

Lou Soldano has also prepared a draft of a letter for you to send to Mr 
Mazotti regarding our on going concern and additional plans. He has, or will 
be sending that to you directly.

If you have any questions, please call.

Mike

Just a short note to let you know that I received a call from Rod Bosche of 
PG&E apprising me of a meeting PG&E will be having with SW Gas this tuesday.  
They will be discussing PCB issues and the sampling results from the PG&E 
system.   From discussions with Louie, a media statement is being prepared by 
them which Louie has a copy of.  The statement is a little harsh and makes 
some statements which are incorrect.  Louie and I are planning to attend this 
meeting in Las Vegas to possibly assist in making some suggestions about 
rewording their statement and provide some additional insight and history on 
the Transwestern system with respect to PCB's.  The results of this meeting 
will be forwarded at a later date.....

Inspected 3 filter cases down stream of Inlet separator at the SLX plant, all 
were still clean and dry. Got a slug of liquid in the Inlet filter separator 
at the SLX about 90 gallons. Did not get any further down stream, also took 
sample of it. See attached for our sample results for this month. PG&E are 
having problems with their phone lines so Sherwood labs could not fax their 
results. Therefor I don't have their results on the spred sheet.I will send 
them out as soon as I get them. Thanks,Randy

After the Topock line has been cleaned and placed back in service, I 
recommend immediate flushing with diesel.
The existing Selexol tank and injection system can be used for this purpose. 
HYSIM simulations verify the existing high pressure injection pump is a good 
fit for the quantity of diesel to be added on a continuous basis, 
(approximately 1 B/D).  Inject  1 or 2 barrels of diesel in front of each pig 
to begin with.  I would buy diesel No. 2 because it has a wider boiling point 
range than No. 1.  The diesel should be analyzed for PCB content  before we 
purchase /inject.

The above guideline should be adjusted based on the actual volume of liquids 
seen at the meter station filter separator.  If you can keep a small but 
continuous amount of free liquids at this separator , the gas will be 
saturated with heavy hydrocarbons which will dilute and flush PG&E's 
downstream system.

1 to 2 Barrel per day of diesel injected into 200 MMSCF/D has a major effect 
on the C7+ concentration  in the gas stream and on the hydrocarbon dew point. 
Most of the hydrocarbons in diesel  are naturally ocurring to some extent in 
natural gas. The carbon number for diesel ranges from about C10 to C 20 with 
a corresponding boiling point of 350 oF to 650 oF.  It is anticipated that 
some of the heavier hydrocarbons in the C18 to C20 range will  drop out along 
with compressor oil carryover to substantially increase the amount of liquid 
PG&E sees in their downstream drips.  The net effect of this is a substantial 
reduction of the PCB concentration.  I would expect that after 30 to 60 days 
of continuous injection the PCB contaminant level should drop by an order of 
magnitude.

The reason I would not inject Selexol after the pipeline has been cleaned is 
because you would  leave a finite quantity of Selexol coating the pipeline 
which could  then absorb and concentrate any potential PCB contaminant in the 
gas and potentially  recontaminate downstream equipment.

I will be on vacation from June 19 to June 26.  If you have any questions 
please call.

As a result of the latest meeting with PG&E over the greater than 500 ppm PCB 
liquids collection at the PGE Topock C/S filter separator (F/S), presented 
below is a summary of the deconning and sampling activity which occurred 
6/29/00.

Vector was instructed to use a high caustic detergent (Cimclean) as the 
cleaning agent for removing PCB's from the Topock F/S (50:50 Cimclean:water 
mixture).  Diesel was not used in the deconning process.  The only equipment 
cleaned by Vector was the PG&E F/S.  Transwestern's filters in its separator 
were replaced,  but no cleaning or deconning was perfromed to this unit.   
The filters were also replaced in the PG&E separator.

The following samples were collected during this project:

On the Transwestern side:

 1. Wipes (3) of the interrior body of our filter separator after the filters 
were removed.  Large areas were wiped to determine presence/absence of   
PCB's.  (Not 100 sq. cm. sample)

 2. A composite sample of a used filter removed from the upstream separator 
at the Selexol Plant.  The filters appeared to be exceptionally clean 

 3. Composite sample of the fine powdery rust  which had collected in the 
bottom of the F/S.   Approximte volume one cup.  
 
 4. Composite sample of the used filters from the F/S. Visible appearance of 
the filters removed from this vessel showed them to be clean and    virtually 
unstained.  A small discoloration was present on the ends of each filter 
confirming that the filters were sealed properly in the F/S. 

 5. A sample of an unused clean stocked filter.  This was a control sample. 


On the PG&E side:

 1. A liquids sample of the residual in the upstream leg of the Topock filter 
separator prior to deconning.  Approx. volume one cup

 2. Sample of the solids (fine, blackened, powder) which had collected in the 
F/S.  An estimate of the volume of this material removed form the F/S   prior 
to deconning was approximately one gallon.

 3. Wipe samples (3) of the interrior of the F/S prior to deconning (not 100 
cm sq. wipe)

 4. Used filter media from the F/S.  The operation of the F/S filters are 
designed to be a twice pass through of the same filter.  Composite samples   
were collected of the upstream and downstream portions of the filters.

 5. Wipes (3) of the deconned filter separator interrior walls. 

The only inconsistency observed during the cleaning and inspection process 
was the volume and  buildup of the black fine powdery hydrcarbon material 
which was present in the F/S at the Topock C/S and conspicuously small amount 
of rust colored material which was present  in Transwestern's F/S .  As 
previously mentioned, samples were collected of  both materials.  The only 
difference between the two locations was the color of the materials and the 
volume.  It is suspected that the deconning activity conducted in August of 
99 loosened hydrocarbon solids present in the 1850 feet of pipe which had 
over time moved and collected in the PG&E F/S.  The small amount of rust 
materials observed in the Transwestern F/S is the result of the pigging 
activity from the Selexol Plant into the Transwestern F/S.  I will have 
reprensentataive samples of both materials.  

Photographs  were also taken of the cleaning and inspection activities and 
will be available for review at the forthcoming meeting in Flagstaff with 
PG&E.
on the 13th of July.  Analytical results will also be completed at this time.

Rich, thanx for the sampling update.  Ill pass it along to the apropriate 
parties.  A cursory look at the data shows it to be inconsistently up and 
down, as expected, with no glaring increases.  Anything urgent we need to 
discuss?

In light of the recent PCB issue with PG&E on the Topock Lateral,  I have 
asked Mr. John Woodyard of Roy F. Westin to c ome to Houston and make a  
presentation on PCB's in natural gas pipelines.  Mr. Woodyard has 
considerable experience in the management of PCB's and works closely in 
industry associations (INGAA and GRI),  Mr. Woodyard also works as a 
consultant in this capacity. 

The date of this meeting will be on Friday, September 3rd, beginning at 9:00 
am.  Lou Soldano will be setting up a meeting room and will notifiy all 
attendees via lotus notes prior to the September 3rd meeting date. 

I think this meeting will be very interesting and informative and and 
encourage all to attend, if possible.

This is just a short update on the conference call just completed with 
Michael Adewumi of Penn State, concerning the PCB pipeline modeling project 
proposed for the Transwestern mainline system.  David Roensch, Dr. Adewumi 
and myself discussed the latest proposal submitted by Adewumi and based upon 
his answers to the technical and operational questions, it appears that the 
model will yeild some useful information.  Adewumi was asked about the 
simultaneous modeling of PCB's and arsenic and feels that the model can 
address this situation.  He felt that by initiating the model to the pipeline 
segement  selected for the study (between C/S 4 and C/S3) this information 
could be projected to the other pipeline segments with physical and 
elevational conditions not represented in the segment selected.  As is the 
case with most projects of this nature, answers to some questions cannot be 
addressed until we begin the process. 

It appears that the next step in this process is to have Mike Terraso contact 
Michael Adewumi.  David Roensch and I will be available to feed technical and 
operational information to Adewumi for his modeling input.  It may also be in 
the best interest of this project  to see a team of technical and operational 
experts from Enron and Transwestern begin a  brain stroming of this project 
during the data input stage to address issues related to the field cleaning 
trials, both of the pipeline system and the C/S piping.  By working through 
the process, we may be able to alleviate some potential concerns  and 
increase the cleaning success.  Although Transwestern has been involved in 
this type of cleaning for a number of years, based upon the liquids data 
results, the system has met with variable success.  The more technical and 
operational information we can incorporate into the model, the better will be 
the modeling conclusions and results of the  cleaning activity.

I spoke at length today with Rod Boschee at PG&E.  The main focus of our 
discussion was logistics/planning for the upcoming 4/13/99 meeting between TW 
and PG&E representatives.  Mr. Boschee, as in earlier conversations this 
week, did not mention the 3/25 sample results.  Rather, it was agreed (also 
mandated by his boss, Bill Mazotti) that the time was ripe for a follow-on 
meeting to our initial discussion in Topock back in January.  I provided 
verbal notification to Mr. Boschee that Transwestern had retained an outside 
contractor for purposes of a decontamination process to be accomplished 
tomorrow at our filter separators.  In addition to my verbal notification, I 
told him that TW would provide PG&E with a letter, just to complete the paper 
trail.  I reinforced the importance of communication between the companies, 
both formal and informal.  A copy of the letter I faxed to Mr. Boschee is 
attached below.


Mr. Boschee will be preparing a draft agenda for the 4/13 meeting for TW to 
consider.  In addition to TW providing an update on all interim as well as 
long term plans for the lateral, Mr. Boschee noted two important items.  
First, PG&E would like more information regarding the proposed controlled 
Selexol flush.  Their concern is that the Selexol was colored initially as 
the culprit in this PCB issue, and now is being considered a part of a 
revised interim solution.  Secondly, PG&E would like to discuss the upcoming 
filter change at its station currently scheduled for 4/29.  

We've decided to meet in Las Vegas on 4/13.  The choice of Vegas seemed to be 
more centralized (vs. San Francisco), as well as more convenient for those of 
us travelling all the way from Houston.  PG&E is planning on having the 
following personnel attend the meeting:
 Rod Boschee-  Director of Contract Development
 Dave Anderson-  Attorney
 Mel Wong-  Project Manager, Topock Lateral project
 Jody Garcia-  District Superintendent, Barstow Dist.
 Tony Estrada-  Environmental
 2 as-yet-to-be-named Barstow team members

Transwestern is planning on having the following personnel attend the meeting:
 Jeff Fawcett- Marketing
 Louis Soldano-  Attorney
 Mike Nelson-  VP Operations
 Rich Jolly-  District Ops
 Larry Campbell-  Environmental
 Bob Iversen-  Technical advisor, Selexol/PCB matters
 Earl Chanley-  Engineering

The plan is to take Bill's plane from Houston, pick-up Mike Nelson in 
Amarillo, meet in Vegas, and return (with drop-off in Amarillo) to Houston in 
one day.  I'm coordinating the logistics with Virginia O'Neill.  My guess at 
this point is that we'll plan on being in Las Vegas by 10:30 a.m., with the 
meeting to begin at 11:00 a.m., a working lunch served at 12:00 noon, and 
adjourn somewhere around 2:00 p.m., with a return flight of 2:30 p.m.

Lou Soldano is in receipt of a few of Bill Cordes' suggestions to the letter 
that Bill will send out to Bill Mazotti that will: (1) outline the revised 
Interim Plan, including the Selexol flush, (2) notify him of our initiative 
to decon TW's filter/separators, and (3) reinforce our desire to meet on 
4/13.  If the logistics (KEYEX meeting) can be worked out, the letter will 
probably go out by Friday.

If you have any questions regarding the matters outlined above, please advise.

Attached is another draft of the agenda for the meeting.  I added one item
of concern to PG&E having to do with the unfortunate financial problem of
your parent.

I have also attached in advance of the meeting the latest budget information
covering 2001.  I hope to send you the projected 2002 budget data on Monday.


It looks like we will have five attendees with only one able to play golf
(that being me).

We will see you on Tuesday evening at 7:00 pm in the lobby.  Hope everyone
will have a great Thanksgiving holiday.

Based on the call from Rod Boschee today noting meetings set up with 
Southwest, Lou and Larry Campbell will be attending. I believe it would be 
helpful for Dave Schafer or a rep from communications to attend, as well. 
PG&E appears to be getting ready to divert attention to us. Worthwhile to 
read the PG&E media statement at the end of this lotus notes. Mike

FYI - it also appears that there is a meeting next tuesday in Vegas with SW 
Gas and SoCal.   They will have PG&E media folks ther to discuss possible 
public distribuion of some type of notice concerning this matter.

Dave Schafer (VP of HR and Media) is unavailable so I would suggest that 
Larry, myself and possibly someone from market - Lorraine??? - also attend.

please see the attached.   Comments???  I doubt that PG&E would make any 
changes.  I'd still like to make some suggestions.  Dave - it might be 
worthwile to speak to your counterpart who appear to be Jon Tremayne.   At 
least we have a heads up on thier response.  I'll review our last Q&A and 
send the comments to Dave.

Lou --

Attached is the current version of our Standby statement (i.e., statement to
read to media, in the event they "call").


 <<000207s2.doc>>

To date, and through history of our gas quality matters betw. TW and PG&E,
we have had no calls, and therefore, we have NOT externally utilized this
statement.

We (you and I) should chat this PM or tomorrow Friday, re any developments.

Cheers!

The environmental clearances are still in effect as long as we stay on our 
right of way and in our measuring station yard.  For any construction work at 
the PG&E station, we will need written aprpoval from PG&E.  I  will notify 
the state and county of California when we do the construction work.  Earl, I 
will need to know the amount  of natural gas which will be released during 
the blowdown of the 1850 feet of pipe, our separator and meter tubes.  Pg&E 
will be responsible for the notification of gas release for their separator 
and piping....

The following is the update I received from the Kingman Team on todays 
pigging activities:

Tiny,
 We kicked two pigs today with 55 gals of diesel in front of each pig.  On 
the first run we got only enough liquid to get a sample.  The pig came out 
with a big chunk out of it.  Don't know what is causing this because we have 
received a couple of pigs that were damaged.  This is only the second pig 
that has come in that we cannot use again.   
 When the second pig came in, we received 41 gals of liquid.  We had to haul 
it out a pail at a time.  We pulled about half from the seperator and half 
from the drain tap in front of the seperator.
 These two runs took us nine hours to run, that is why we only did two.  We 
plan on putting in 100 gals of diesel tomarrow since they are going to ship 
some more diesel for us on Monday.  If flow rate permitting we plan on 
kicking two more pigs tomarrow with 100 gals each.

Brent  & Russ

Per this evenings discussions with Gas Control, it looks like we will have 60 
mmcfd scheduled to PG&E for tomorrows (Sundays) gas day.  Gas Control will 
make every effort to coordinate flows with PG&E and insure we have higher 
flowing volumes during the pigging hours if at all possible.  Again the new 
pigs are due to be on site by Tuesday.   I forwarded an e:mail message to 
Kingman informing them to insure they split a sample with PG&E on the 15 MP 
sample point.  

I've set up a conf. call for this Friday the 13th at 10:00 am Houston time.  
We should have additional sampling infromation by this time not only from the 
Weekly Report but on the pigging activites as well.  (877-795-3687   pin 
323297)

My comments on information communicated to Boschee are shown below.

Hope you had a better flight home than me - late one hour departing, flew to 
Omaha and circled because of lightning and thunderstorms until we had to go 
to Kansas City for fuel, then back to Omaha to sneak in between lightning 
bolts - the drive home was a combination of being blinded by lightning, 
unable to see because of driving rain, or praying the car could make it 
through the flooded streets! Anyway, home by 1:15 AM, so not too bad.

Here's what I believe to be our current plan, which will be communicated to 
PG&E through letter to Rod Boschee.

1.  Continue to inject diesel at a 55 gal rate and pig daily through 8/15
We will be running from 2 to 4 pigs daily (depending on flow rates) and 
injecting 100 gallon per pig run.  Today (Saturday) was the exception because 
of flow rates and the volume of diesel on hand (400 gn's).  Two pigs were run 
at 55 gallons of diesel per pig.  This 400 gallons under the previous pigging 
schedule would have lasted for 1 1/2 weeks at the single pig per day & at 55 
gallons per pig.  A load of diesel will be on location Monday.   

2.  Collect liquids from all pig runs for analysis and trending (daily or as 
often as pigs are received)

3.  Collect liquids from TW's filter / separator for analysis and trending 
(daily)
This is above and beyond the weekly accumulation and split sampling at this 
point.  The Weekly Split sampling will still continue.  

4.  After 8/15, continue pigging daily w/o injection of any liquids to dry 
pipe through 9/7

5. Repeat steps 2 and 3 above

6. Schedule Vector to be on site September 7 to decontaminate a.) 1850' of 
pipe from TW's measurement to PG&E's filter/separator and b.)  PG&E's 
filter/separator.  
Larry/Earl - We're still OK on clearances for ROW and excavation etc... 
should we need to make a cut into the 1850' of pipe aren't we?  I'm assuming 
the clearances we received for the siphon project would carry forward????

7. Post 5 day outage for scheduled pipeline maintenance on EBB as soon as 
Vector confirms date.

8. Trending and analysis will determine if any pigging or further decon work 
will be done on TW's upstream pipe.

Please review, add, subtract, correct, etc. prior to Monday. Thanks for 
continuing help - this is going to be a very tough win, if a win is possible. 
Mike

We completed decontamination of the inlet filter at the selexol plant today. 
It was dirty but 
no liquid. There was some dried sludge in the bottom of the vessel and the 
filters were 
extremely dirty. We plan to do both of the filters on the discharge side 
tomorrow.I got a phone 
messsage from Jeff and he hasn't heard anything from PGE since the letter was 
sent . We will 
plan to bypass and clean the filter on the west side of the river, last one 
on our system Saturday
unless we hear something different tomorrow. We will notify the PGE operators 
of their plant 
tomorrow of our plans.If anyone needs to contact me my pager number is 
1-800-921-9564 and office
phone number is 505-260-4003. Leave a message on the office phone and it will 
automatically
page me. I'll give everyone an update late tomorrow. We should have the hot 
tap valves on location 
tomorrow for the selexol injection. We plan to install the valves as soon as 
they arrive.

Thanks RJ

By the way Bisti came on line today and they plan to run it tonight and be 
back on location to 
check on the unit tomorrow.

Mike   
We completed the decontamination on both of the filter separators on the 
discharge of the Solexol Plant.  There was a thin film of an oily substance 
(presumably Solexol) on the interior wall of the filter separators.  However, 
both sets of filters were very clean.  No moisture was present on the filters 
and there was not any sludge or build up on any of the filters.  The filters 
that were removed had the same appearance of a brand new filter.  As a matter 
or fact, when you laid a new filter beside a used filter you could not tell a 
difference.  The filters being used are a Sock type filter and when you ran 
your hand across the filters you could not detect the presence of any 
moisture at all.

So, it's presumed that the system has been completely absent of any liquid.  
The small amounts of liquid being collected from week to week for sampling 
must have been accumulated from the run down or film, pre-existing on the 
interior of the filter separator housing.  A decontamination and triple rinse 
of each filter separator should result in a total absence of any liquid for 
future samples, other than the remaining soap and water used for the final 
rinse that could not be drained from the vessels.

Rich and I visited the Topock compressor station this morning and reviewed 
the sampling point on PG&E's inlet scrubber.  Rich made the recommendation to 
Randy Williams and Rick Bezanson (PG&E) that future samples be taken straight 
off the bottom of the scrubber rather than from PG&E's 1000 gallon blow down 
tank.  The purpose of this was to reduce the exposure to contaminating future 
samples with pre-existing PCB's that may have collected in the 1000 gallon 
blow down tank over a period of time.  PG&E agreed to sample from this point 
on future collections.

Both of the discharge lines on each filter separator at the Solexol plant 
have been hot tapped in preparation of Solexol injection.  Piping has been 
installed and pumps are in place to accommodate the Solexol injection as 
well.  However, NO injection of Solexol will take place until after our 
meeting next Tuesday with PG&E.

Transwestern has agreed with PG&E today to postpone our planned 
decontamination of the filter separator at Transwesterns PG&E meter station 
until April 28th, at which time Transwestern and PG&E will perform a 
decontamination of both TW's and PG&E's filter separators simultaneously.   

                                                                              
               Thanks, Tiny

Just a short message to apprise everyone of the cleaning results performed on 
the filter separator from the Transwestern M/S.  Wipe tests taken of the 
interrior portions of the separator prior to cleaning revealed PCB results 
of: 360, 500 and 520 microgram.   This was not a standard wipe taken of a 
specific area.  These wipes were taken over large areas to determine 
presence/absence of PCB's within the separator.  After the cleaning operation 
was completed, three wipe samples were taken of the interrior portions of the 
separator.  All results showed non detect at less than 1.0 microgram.  I feel 
we can be fairly certain that the separator is free of residual PCBs.  

Jeff, would you pass this information on to your counterpart for PG&E?

See attached for sample results for this months sample run. Larry I think the 
reson we got NDs on our samples is because the lab raised the reporting limit 
due to dilution necessary for analysis. Don't know why maybe you can find out 
for us. We won't use this lab next  time, we will be going back to Sherwood 
Labs.  Thanks, Randy

results prior to next weeks report.  

Started decontamination and filter change outs of the 1) inlet filter 
seperator at the Solexol Plant 2) both filter seperators on the discharge of 
the Solexol Plant 3) the filter seperator at Transwesterns PG&E measurement 
station.  Operations and contractors are gearing up today (Thursday 4/8) to 
start the decontamination on the inlet filter at the Solexol plant which will 
set the pace for the remaining 3 seperators.

Operations has been informed that PG&E will be performing a decontamination 
and filter change out at their filter seperator on the inlet of the PG&E 
Topac compressor station.  This has been scheduled for April 28th.

Mike,  I reveiwed the proposal by Adewumi and it is correct and fairly 
accurate, for the purposes of a historic account and and in as far as  what 
was provided to him in the way of data and history.  His proposed scope seems 
to be conclusive and appears to be what we need.   I have included Louie in 
the distribution  and am sure he will have some input. 

My comments are as follows:

1.  I dont know how relevant it is to know about the customers facilities at 
this time.  As you know, we have more than one customer (PG&E and SoCal), and 
I  think that we should maintain a low profile especially with respect ot 
SoCal.  Both parties in the past,  have been helpful and very cooperative in 
matters  pertaining to PCB's. Because the modeling study will be conducted 
between C/S 3 and C/S 2, the customers facilities should have no impact on 
this.  

2.  Also, I would like to see if we can deal with  PCB's and arsenic at the 
same time?  Is it possible to simultanously model both contaminants?

3. Because the modeling efforts are conducted on a very small portion of the 
pipeline, can this section be used for all of the Transwestern system?  In 
leau of  the fact that we have pipe under rivers, over rivers, major 
elevation chages in short distances etc which are not covered in the section 
to be modeled, will  the pipeline characteristics be covered to the extent 
that it will yeild information applicable to the entire pipeline system?

4. I am also concerned about stirring up the PCB's and moving additional 
PCB's into the SoCal system.  Its been pretty quiet  in discussions with the 
SoCal  PCB person.  I wonder if we should notify Ralph Komai to be on the 
alert when we start the cleaning?  Louie, thoughts?

5. Injection of terpenol into the station yard piping.  How will we do this 
and how do we get it out?

6. Impact of terpenol on gaskets, engine parts, etc.

Subject: The Draft of the PCB Cleanup Proposal



Dear Mike, David, Larry and Ben:
 Please find attached the draft of the PCB migration/cleanup proposal as
promised. This is only the technical portion of the proposal. Once we agree
on the specific scope of the work, the necessary man-hours and the
associated budget can then be developed.
 In addition, we have studied the material given during our meeting and have
developed a preliminary list of the data that we would need from you once
the project begins. I have decided to attach the list so as to give you
adequate time to collect and/or collate this information.
 Please give me your feedback on the proposal as soon as possible so that we
can develop the final version and submit an official proposal. Equally
important, the more preparation and planning we do at this stage, the faster
the progress that would be made once the project actually begins. Thank you
and have a wonderful weekend.

Attached is another draft of the agenda for the meeting.  I added one item
of concern to PG&E having to do with the unfortunate financial problem of
your parent.

I have also attached in advance of the meeting the latest budget information
covering 2001.  I hope to send you the projected 2002 budget data on Monday.


It looks like we will have five attendees with only one able to play golf
(that being me).

We will see you on Tuesday evening at 7:00 pm in the lobby.  Hope everyone
will have a great Thanksgiving holiday.

Subject: Issues Pertaining to Meeting with PG&E

I spoke with Tony Estrada yesterday concerning the sampling protocol and he 
indicated that the document is almost finished.  We then focused our 
discussion upon agenda items for the upcoming meeting in Las Vegas on 
Monday.  One thing we should begin to think about and I'm pretty sure it will 
be an agenda topic during the meeting, is the issue of the pipe contamination 
between our Measuring station and their compresssor station.  Tony's feeling 
is that  with all the cleaning of equipment and installation of the pigging 
facilities, this section of pipe may be a future headache.

It seems that Vector was onsite with the PG&E and they may have pointed out 
this point of concern.  PG&E might possibly want this this portion of the 
system flushed.
