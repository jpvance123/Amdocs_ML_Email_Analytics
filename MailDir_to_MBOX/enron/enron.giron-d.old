Here is the spreadsheet we discussed in today's meeting.  It should be pretty 
straightforward.  If you have any questions, please ask.  I'll be happy to 
help you out.

I will look at a way to "tie-in" Winzip with this spreadsheet.  I don't know 
if it is possible, but if I can accomplish it, I'll let you know.

Subject: Excel file to help you out

Here is a spreadsheet I worked up to help you determine what files need to be 
cleaned up.  It is pretty simple and straightforward.  You can enter a 
directory, file extention (if you want all file types, just enter a "*"), a 
minimum file size, and a modified before date.  The spreadsheet will perform 
a search of the directory and all subdirectories and return the files 
matching the criteria you specified.

The information is returned sorted by directory, but you can then sort by 
size, date, or whatever.

This should help you make a quick pass through your files on the "O" drive to 
determine some of the older/bigger ones you can clean up.

I would encourage you not to just enter "O:\" in the directory because the 
program will take forever, and you will run out of rows in excel to store the 
data.  Since it is in Excel, it will take just a while if you run it on a 
directory with a lot of files, so be a little patient.

I don't want to spend a lot of time supporting this thing, so if you 
distribute further, just don't tell them where you got it from (unless you 
want to designate a given person on your desk to perform the work).  

Let me know if you have questions or problems.

Greg

I have encountered the following problems calcing at home.

1.  On my Portcalc screen, everything was very tiny.  It worked but I know I 
couldn't copy a post id because I wouldn't be able to see the new number.

2.  I wanted to look at my curves last night and they opened up with errors.  
Basically it's like opening up the curves on a machine without the correct 
drivers.  Seems like we need to put those drivers on the network and maybe 
upgrade it to Oracle 8i too.

3.  I don't know how we can change the printer to print at home.  Only 
concern here is if we are offsite and have a local printer (will we be able 
to put that printer on the network?).  

That's all I can think of right now.

Any suggestions?

Dave

Darron,

I met this man's wife, Nadia Rodriquez, in orientation.  Here is what she 
said about her husband's work experience.

"My husband just finished his MBA and his company's moving to Atlanta.  He 
has been offered two positions there but we would rather stay here.  His 
background has been in the securities industry, most recently in compliance 
where he ensures that brokers follow NASD and SEC regulations in all aspects 
(e.g. trading, marketing, etc.).  Prior to the compliance role, he was a 
broker with PaineWebber.  Also, he has extensive computer skills and is used 
to dealing with all levels of personnel."

She should be sending me his resume soon.

As discussed in the brown bag classes today many people would like to be able 
to see the NYMEX prices updated in real-time.  Attached is a modified TDS 
file that will listen to the NYMEX price.  When you open the file an error 
message appears but the file does work.  Just go to the listen page and you 
can see each of the months.  Please forward this file to your group if you 
feel it will be useful to them.  If you have any questions just ask.

Subject: Synthetic Storage Liquidation Variances

Darron,

I am going to try to put my thoughts on paper, but call me if there are any 
further questions...

For April, we have 1,390,618 of expense on the back page.  I have narrowed it 
down to the following...
 Tagg #N06517 being double booked  $952,500  (the correct tagg # is N08646).  
 The other side of the storage transaction is in 9/00 physical liquidation 
file and it is for 1,866,000.
 Looks like double booking it actually made us money. Check it out though!
 
 137,000 in liquidations should have been moved to commodity expense to cover 
transportations
 OA, but it wasn't., so we this is income for us.

 Two deals were booked in sitara but not tagg and, therefore, no liquidation 
to cover the expenses.
 They are sitara #242510 and #128336.  The total of these equaled 429,477.  

For May, we have 1,889,707 in income on the back page.  This comes from:
 Another deal booked twice....Tagg #N05499 was booked as duplicate (the right 
one is #N08617)
 The other side (expense) of the deal was taken in Dec.99. Therefore, I see 
this as true income!
 
 Tagg #NJ4479, I will have to talk with you about this.  I don't fully 
understand it myself.

 93,924 (Tagg #NG0049), this should have been transferred to 3rd party 
sales/purchases.
 This storage deal is booked directly with the third party.

I have not looked at July in full, but have some print outs to give you.

Please let me know if you have any further questions on this crap!  I am just 
a phone call away.

Dawn
