I will be taking a sabbatical beginning any moment.  I have no control over 
the exact time; it may have already happened.  I plan to visit the mountains 
and the ocean.  They miss me. I miss them.  

Unfortunately, Enron requires employees to use vacation time instead of Inner 
Self time, so I will have to return someday.  Looks like July 5th.  I'm kind 
of bummed about it, but maybe by then I will have transcended to a new 
plateau of understanding.

In my absence, contact Milind Patil, x39247 for Unify performance issues.

Thanks for understanding,

Subject: possibly adding deal prices to Path Manager

Donna,

A request was brought up this week that I would like you to run by the 
managers for input:
 - add the deal price to the Sales and Supply list windows of Path Manager
This seems more significant based on the transactions from EOL.

This has been mentioned in the past, but has had some related "baggage":
 - impact on performance, may run slower.  Could make it an option so you pay 
the price when you need it.
 - ability to show tier info.  Maybe just use the work "Tiered" and not try 
to represent the actual pricing
 - agreed format for those deals that have index pricing and percentage and 
fixed price offset (ie 98% of IF.Transco.ZN1 + .02)

This column would be customizable by resizing and relocating it by user 
preference.

Let me know what you hear.  d.n.

Changing counterparty names on Sitara deal tickets has absolutely no impact 
to any downstream processes.  

I hope the following will give more clarification.   

Let me know if you have any questions or need more detail! 

Thanks,
dg  3-9517


Sitara / Unify - Process
* Scenario - Counterparty name changes on Sitara deal ticket after deal had 
been pathed, scheduled & bridged back from Unify.
* Impact - zero impact to Logistics & Volume Management, absolutely 
harmless.  Settlements has process in place to eliminate issues.
* Process - 
Counterparty A in Sitara changes to Counterparty B.   
Ctprty A was on original path sent to pipeline.  
The new name (ctprty B) does bridge over to Unify.
Ctprty A remains at the path level in Unify (gui display does not change)
Ctprty B is now displayed at the deal level in Unify.  The field is now 
highlighted to indicate a change occurred. (gui display changes only at high 
level, not on path)
The Scheduler has choice to repath (if necessary), or not re-path
If re-pathing occurs, the new counterparty name will be displaced on new path

Unify pushes back the deal number & meter to Sitara (not ctprty info)
Balancing works on deal number & meter only (not ctprty info)
The confirmation desk utilizes the information in Sitara (where all 
information is correct)
Volume Management utilizes the information in Unify for pipeline tie-out.  
(all information sent to pipeline is correct at the path level and will match 
up perfectly)
Settlements utilizes information in Unify.  
Settlements recognizes that changed ctprty names changes contracts, which 
would create two notification entries
If invoice did happen to go out to wrong ctprty, re-draft would occur.
(note:  there was an issues discovered on reports which IT is correcting now)


Autonoms "Tom's words of warning" - 
Previously there was an issue when counterparty name changes took place after 
deals were pathed and nominated.  Basically it would change a key on an EDI 
path (duns number) not affecting any other of the information already 
nominated to the pipeline.  If the scheduler re-nominated, data at the 
pipeline would get doubled up and the scheduler would have NO way to correct 
the problem.  In most cases, the schedulers would have to get the pipeline to 
manually cut the original nominated volume.  This is not an issue with Unify 
(as explained above).


(Dave - feel free to chime in if I left anything out.)

Subject: Re: Sitara Release (Re: Changes in Global due to Consent to 
Assignment)  

FYI....

This change went in for the Deal Validation group.   It gives them the 
ability to change counterparties names after bridge back.

Impact to Logistics - Unify
If a counterparty name change takes place to deals that have been bridge 
backed, it could cause problems on EDI pipes as that new counterparty name 
will flow over to Unify and repathing should eventually take place.
One problem may be with the Imbalance data sets, which are not in production 
yet......(EDI Imbalance Qtys would not match up to paths)
This may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities (especially where 
nominations were sent for entire month)
can't remember the rules on this one, but I think Unify does have some safe 
guards (idiot proofs) to force re-pathing.
Unify does have the ability to over-ride duns numbers, yet would still cause 
an additional step for EDI the scheduler would need to think through in order 
to get a clean quick response.
What are (if any) impacts to Vol Mgt if counterparty name changes take 
place?  (prior periods?  re-pathing?)

I have a call into Diane and Dave both.  After speaking w/ them, hopefully I 
can get a clear understanding of the true impact.  I am sure we'll need to 
put some processes and procedures together for Deal Validation to follow when 
these type of changes are needed.

Will keep you posted.

Thanks,

dg

Subject: Sitara Release (Re: Changes in Global due to Consent to Assignment)


Regarding the ability to change counterparties on deals in SITARA with 
confirmed volumes - Tom's words of caution:

If someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty - we created the 
ability for you to invalidate the deal - and 
then change the counterparty - however - I did add a warning message:

"Warning - changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes - make sure 
pipeline allows this change."   

Some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is 
feedback - I assume for the same reasons
we had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems 
(pre-UNIFY).  Some pipelines will require a new 
deal and we will have to zero out the old deal.

Before you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just 
in case it causes problems with their
pipeline.   Sorry - I don't know which pipes these are - you will have to ask 
the UNIFY team.

There is one rule still in place - you can change from ENA-IM East to ENA-IM 
Market East - but not from 
ENA-IM Texas to HPLC-IM HPLC - when changing business units - they must be 
the same legal entity. 
"Warning - not the same legal entity"

Also - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to Service deals 
(Transport Capacity, Storage, Cash Out).
Once the deal is invalidated - there are no rules.  Don't forget - the items 
were locked down for a reason.
 If you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down 
data that was validated - and someone used these
deals in UNIFY - it is highly likely that the UNIFY deals and paths created 
using these deals will get corrupted.  Always check 
with someone from UNIFY to make sure no one used these deals for anything in 
UNIFY.

Subject: Sitara Release (Re: Changes in Global due to Consent to Assignment)  

With the release that was put out Tuesday evening, Deal Validation should be 
able to change the counterparty on deals where the volume is something other 
than expected (e.g. confirmed, nominated, scheduled, etc.).  

In addition, this release will also capture "near-time" the contract changes 
that are made in global.  This means that need for server bounces will not be 
necessary.

 New/Changes to contracts will show up without having to get out of deal 
manager.
 New Counterparties, and new/changes to facilities will require getting out 
of all active Sitara apps (except for launch pad).  
  Once out of all apps, start a new app - the respective information that you 
are looking for will appear.

I mention "near-time" because we are constrained by the amount of time it 
takes for the change in Global data to trigger an alert for Sitara who then 
updates its information

The new SITARA to UNIFY bridge monitor is in production.

The monitor shows deals in error state (failed) or in queue to bridge 
(pending) - for deals going to UNIFY from SITARA.

You will find it under - Start - Programs - Trading - SITARA - SU Bridge 
Monitor.

You may need to load the Borland BDE v5.0 software to use this, if not 
already loaded. 

We enhanced the monitor to make it a more useful tool.




If deal is in an error state on the SITARA side - we have not sent it over to 
UNIFY.
If the deal in an error state on the UNIFY side - SITARA has sent it to UNIFY 
- however - it is in the UNIFY failed deal group.

You can sort by the columns - best to sort by business unit.

The date column - shows the last time someone edited the deal. 
Start Date and Stop Date - are begin and end date of deal.

SITARA deal ID - as well as - EOL deal ID.

Indicates if the deal is an business unit is an agent on the deal.

If you are contract or validation support - please do not edit the STATUS = P 
deals - these are the deals with pending status for desk to desk transactions 
(awaiting the other desk to approve the deal or changes to the deal).  If you 
release these deals - you will be the approver of the deal - as you have 
access to multiple desks. 

You can hit the refresh button to re-query the data - or set the auto refresh 
on the tool bar.

We did not build Filter by Business Unit for multiple reasons:
- the expense to build the filter.
- it is easier to support if everyone is looking at the same thing.
- if there is a new business unit - you will see it.
- normally - there should not be more than a screen full of deals in error 
state - once Petro Can/Suncor/Sunoco are set up - we will have a reasonable
  number to look at - and you can sort by the business unit column. 
- If you do want to filter - you may do so - by using the send to excel 
feature - under tool bar option - file - dump to excel.

If you have any questions or problems - please call the SITARA hotline.

Subject:	Sitara EOL Bridge Problem Today

The problem we faced today was due to 2 eol deal packets (2098073, 2099764) not having startdate and enddate.  Missing these 2 tibco message fields caused the bridge to bounce and resulted in the queue to build up while the bridge is starting up. (The bridge takes 2 minute for startup).  Each time these deals are sent/resent, it continuously cause the Sitarar EOLBridge to restart, thus magnifying the buildup of the queue.

The corrective action we are taking at our end is to build a rejection logic when eol packets do not have start and/or enddate.

Hi,

You probably already heard... test of the new Sybase data base release is off 
for today.  Testing will resume tomorrow, Wed 6/21 at Noon.  People should at 
least verify their security access today.  If you do not have access, please 
contact Diane Niestrath at 3-9931 or Dave McMullan at 3-9127.

Subject: Unify stress test next week with Sybase 12.0

We have done some preliminary testing of the latest version of Sybase 
(version 12).  We have seen very positive results from our initial tests and 
would like to proceed with a "stress test" (not to be confused with me 
showing up each day at work).  We would like to do 2 tests next week due to 
hardware and business restrictions.

The test would be similar to those from late-1998 (ah, those were the 
days!).  We will ask all users, as well as I.T. folks, to run as many of 
their usual processing during a scripted time frame from approx noon - 1:30pm 
on Tuesday and Wednesday. Be sure to order some yummy pizza or sandwiches for 
your staff!

The Sybase 12.0 environment can be accessed via Start/Programs/Test 
Applications/Unify Applications/Unify Gas-Power Stage.  On the Login window, 
select server = "ASE 12 Test".  If you usual Production password does not 
work, try "houston".  If that does not work, try a neighbor's (Audit says 
that fine, its just a test).  Each user should plan to run several sessions 
where permissible to simulate a heavy load on the system and to make up for 
those not able to participate during this time.  Please have your staff try 
to login some time Monday to insure they have access.

The test script during the time period will be:
12:00 - 1:30 Logistics:  pathing, nominating, running some reports
12:20 - 1:30 Volume Management: do your thing
12:40 - 1:30 Settlements/Accounting:  pile in

Please let me know if your area would NOT be able to assist in this very 
important test.  The results of these 2 tests will dictate whether we should 
pursue our migration to this new release in mid-July.  The less bid weeks 
with poor system performance the better!

Thanks in advance for your help, d.n.

All,

When we convert Unify to Sybase 12.0, all passwords will get reset to 
"houston".  Once you login to Unify you will have to change you password.  
This is an unavoidable side affect of migrating to Sybase 12.0.

Thanks,
Chris

To help avoid Unify problems during bid-week we must be keeping up with the 
business on the non-EDI pipes throughout the month rather than wait until the 
end of the month to clean-up and bridge back. The IT staff has identified 
this as one of the things Logistics could do to help them maintain reasonable 
performance. 

Please make sure you know the status of each of your pipes and speak to the 
schedulers if you see they aren't keeping their data clean and bridged. I 
expect you to keep on top of this throughout each month.

We are asking everyone else to work around our schedule so lets make sure we 
do our part.

Thanks - Bob

Importance:=09High

All:

We're currently identifying processes that are inefficient and could possib=
ly benefit from being rewritten or not even performed.  Going foward, I wou=
ld like Bob to appoint a lead business person to whom we could ask question=
s and or suggest ideas to so that they could in turn validate this informat=
ion with the desk managers/schedulers.  We had this approach with Nomlogic =
and having Clarissa work the issues worked quite nicely.  Who ever you choo=
se, we would need about 15% of their time for now.  Later on, with coordina=
tion efforts and testing, it may go up to 75%.  I don't see that happening =
for a while though.

The sooner we get someone to devote to this, the better off we will be.  I =
expect these changes that we'll be looking into should improve performance =
quite a bit. =20

That being said, we've identified three items that would speed up processin=
g the retrieval of Path Manager. =20

1)  Currently, the Path Manager attempts to reuse Path Ids.  I can't think =
of any reason why we need to perform this extra step?    It runs through th=
is processing on the application and generally doesn't find a match.  I kno=
w Patti has mentioned this several times and I can't think of a valid reaso=
n for performing this work.  I talked with Dave Nommensen, and according to=
 him, what used to happen is that sometimes schedulers would get duplicate =
paths out there which is why they put this code in place???  From a schedul=
ing perspective, my understanding of what your main concern is to just main=
tain your position and be able to change it.  If you were overpathed, you'd=
 see it in the Path Manager either way. [Pinion, Richard]    To restate the=
 question for clarity, in path manager a scheduler pulls down a supply, mar=
ket and a service, adds any up/downstream contract information and/or Duns =
or DRN override and then saves it.  Unify looks for an old path with those =
exact variables and if it finds it re-uses it and if it does not find an ex=
act match creates a new path and path id.  I had been told that to do away =
with this function would create an unacceptably high amount of paths since =
any path once nominated on could not be deleted.  Has this changed???  At o=
ne time there were some schedulers that looked for the same path / activity=
 number match for nominations.  Texas Eastern was the only pipeline that ne=
eded the old activity numbers no matter how long it had been since they wer=
e used.  I spoke with Chris Ordway and the new LINK system no longer needs =
this to occur.  Transco uses activity numbers but uses the Activity number =
cross reference table to that function and therefore should not be affected=
.  Therefore, if it does not create a space or memory problem for Unify, I =
don't think that this constant old path look up is needed.   [Kinsey, Lisa]=
   Get rid of this. =20

2)  The scheduling position window:  does anyone use this?  If not, we'll r=
emove the code logic that populates this window.  I have never seen a sched=
uler use this.  Please verify. [Pinion, Richard]   Originally such a window=
 was in use by everyone in the legacy system "Autonoms" so it was duplicate=
d in Unify by request.  It is not used in Unify now because of the other so=
phisticated tools Unify provides which obviate it's use.  The only value wo=
uld be notification of bridge errors or contract imbalances but there are o=
ther ways to determine those problems.  As voted on in a previous meeting o=
f the managers - Lose it!  [Kinsey, Lisa]  Why is this still here?=09=20

3)  On the inventory pool list, does anyone need to see the Contarct Refere=
nces List?  Again, this code is called every retrieval time and doesn't app=
ear to be used from my observations.   If they do need this information, we=
 could provide it, but if not, I'd prefer to remove the functionality. [Pin=
ion, Richard]    This function is still very much in use by those with poin=
t based pipelines that must use the imbalance pool to facilitate balancing =
nomination volumes where multiple pipeline external pools exist and are pat=
hed through the same contract imbalance pool.  Keep it!  [Kinsey, Lisa]  Ye=
s.  We use this functionality a lot when pathing pools.=09=20

4)  When pathing a one to many or many to one set of paths, what's the aver=
age number of paths they create at one time?  What about updates?  I know t=
hat ANR and NIGAS are big users of this feature since they have small packa=
ges of gas that they are limited in size to.  Does the system seem faster w=
hen you update one record at a time or chunks of records?  My real question=
 is how often they do this and for what number of paths on both Updates and=
 Inserts.  By update, I mean, going to the path list and changing an upstre=
am / downstream contract or a PSNA which in turn forces a new path to be cr=
eated. [Pinion, Richard]    This one to many or many to one pathing goes on=
 every day on every pipeline.  There is no 'average'.  They typically updat=
e a path with up/downstream meters or duns or dnb numbers one at a time how=
ever.  I hope this answers your question.  I see no change to this process =
at this time  [Kinsey, Lisa]  On some pipes this function is used more than=
 others.  When it is used we try and do as many paths as possible.  At this=
 time I do not see a need to change this process. =09=20

5)  On brokered paths, do you want to utilize the same logic we have for Se=
rvice?  In other words, when updating Brokered arrangements, we don't incor=
porate the same logic for zeroing out the path and recreating a new arrangm=
ent link and hence sending it to be renominated?  Why do we do this for ser=
vice?  Is it because we have to renominate it?  I assume that's what it's f=
or since we don't send brokered paths to the pipe.  Anyway, with the Nomlog=
ic implmentation (two way interface), we were planning on having it behave =
the same way as service.  We need this verified. [Pinion, Richard]    We do=
n't perform the same logic for Brokered paths because these are not nominat=
ed to the pipeline and hence do not need a zero path to be resent to the pi=
peline when a significant change is made to the already nominated path.  I =
don't see a need to change the way Brokered paths are behaving at this time=
. [Kinsey, Lisa]  Agree with Richard.=09=20

Subject: Unify performance problem on Wednesday

As you are aware, the Unify system experienced significant performance 
problems Wednesday from approx 9:30 am - 11:20 am.  The duration of the 
problem was due to a type of system behavior we had not experienced before.  
The problem was exacerbated by a multitude of additional user logins thinking 
that a fresh login might work better.  Additional logins never improve 
performance and generally degrade it, but that is another story.  (There was 
actually a single user with 21 sessions!)  We had to "bounce" the server 
twice to bring the system back to its normal level of performance.

The good news is that we found out what caused the problem.  It was not a 
particular user or a particular report or process.  It was actually an 
intentional change to a specific table that we have done numerous times in 
the past, but this particular change had drastic side effects.  We have 
contacted Sybase with this problem to see if they can help determine if the 
behavior is a "feature" or a bug.  In the meanwhile, we will do these types 
of changes at night during scheduled outages.

I apologize for the frustration, anxiety, and extra work brought on by this 
problem and will take every precaution to see that it does not happen again.  
If you have any further questions or comments, please feel free to give me a 
call.

Dave N.

Volume Management should be fine with this change. All name changes will be 
still attached to the original path of the Buy/Sell deal. The Settlement 
Group will have to make sure that the new name that is being added to the 
deal has the appropriate 'Statement Group' attached.  Other than that this 
change should flow smoothly.

Thanks,
m.m.

Subject: Re: Sitara Release (Re: Changes in Global due to Consent to 
Assignment)  

FYI....

This change went in for the Deal Validation group.   It gives them the 
ability to change counterparties names after bridge back.

Impact to Logistics - Unify
If a counterparty name change takes place to deals that have been bridge 
backed, it could cause problems on EDI pipes as that new counterparty name 
will flow over to Unify and repathing should eventually take place.
One problem may be with the Imbalance data sets, which are not in production 
yet......(EDI Imbalance Qtys would not match up to paths)
This may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities (especially where 
nominations were sent for entire month)
can't remember the rules on this one, but I think Unify does have some safe 
guards (idiot proofs) to force re-pathing.
Unify does have the ability to over-ride duns numbers, yet would still cause 
an additional step for EDI the scheduler would need to think through in order 
to get a clean quick response.
What are (if any) impacts to Vol Mgt if counterparty name changes take 
place?  (prior periods?  re-pathing?)

I have a call into Diane and Dave both.  After speaking w/ them, hopefully I 
can get a clear understanding of the true impact.  I am sure we'll need to 
put some processes and procedures together for Deal Validation to follow when 
these type of changes are needed.

Will keep you posted.

Thanks,

dg

Subject: Sitara Release (Re: Changes in Global due to Consent to Assignment)


Regarding the ability to change counterparties on deals in SITARA with 
confirmed volumes - Tom's words of caution:

If someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty - we created the 
ability for you to invalidate the deal - and 
then change the counterparty - however - I did add a warning message:

"Warning - changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes - make sure 
pipeline allows this change."   

Some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is 
feedback - I assume for the same reasons
we had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems 
(pre-UNIFY).  Some pipelines will require a new 
deal and we will have to zero out the old deal.

Before you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just 
in case it causes problems with their
pipeline.   Sorry - I don't know which pipes these are - you will have to ask 
the UNIFY team.

There is one rule still in place - you can change from ENA-IM East to ENA-IM 
Market East - but not from 
ENA-IM Texas to HPLC-IM HPLC - when changing business units - they must be 
the same legal entity. 
"Warning - not the same legal entity"

Also - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to Service deals 
(Transport Capacity, Storage, Cash Out).
Once the deal is invalidated - there are no rules.  Don't forget - the items 
were locked down for a reason.
 If you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down 
data that was validated - and someone used these
deals in UNIFY - it is highly likely that the UNIFY deals and paths created 
using these deals will get corrupted.  Always check 
with someone from UNIFY to make sure no one used these deals for anything in 
UNIFY.

Subject: Sitara Release (Re: Changes in Global due to Consent to Assignment)  

With the release that was put out Tuesday evening, Deal Validation should be 
able to change the counterparty on deals where the volume is something other 
than expected (e.g. confirmed, nominated, scheduled, etc.).  

In addition, this release will also capture "near-time" the contract changes 
that are made in global.  This means that need for server bounces will not be 
necessary.

 New/Changes to contracts will show up without having to get out of deal 
manager.
 New Counterparties, and new/changes to facilities will require getting out 
of all active Sitara apps (except for launch pad).  
  Once out of all apps, start a new app - the respective information that you 
are looking for will appear.

I mention "near-time" because we are constrained by the amount of time it 
takes for the change in Global data to trigger an alert for Sitara who then 
updates its information

A walk-thru/demo of this new functionality was held today with the Logistics 
Managers and representative schedulers from each region except for Texas and 
Calgary.  The changes were well received and no revisions were requested.  
They would like to have the changes migrated to Production the evening of 
Tuesday, January 18 for use the morning of Wednesday, January 19.

Paul, could you please insure that the network folks have the Tibco install 
complete by Monday, including Terminal Server.
Scotty, Paul may need one of your folks to insure that the Tibco install 
works OK on Terminal Server (none of us have access).
Scotty, can you follow up with Calgary and Texas since they missed the demo.
 Also, what level of security is desired for the rollout - selected 
schedulers or all of Logistics?
Dave M, plan to have the last few related items in Stage by Monday to insure 
all is clean by Tuesday night. (print, filter, closed Path List, & app close 
error msg)

If you do not feel like this schedule can be met, please let me know as you 
become aware.

Thanks, d.n.

During mid-july, SITARA will change the logic on Desk to Desk deals to post 
the volume associated with the Sales (Seller) side to the SITARA deal.  
Currently, the volume on the Receipt (Buyer) side is being posted.  This 
change will be implemented in order to coincide with the logic currently 
being used in SAP.  This change should help to avoid Intercompany imbalances.

Please be aware that this change will effect Desk to Desk deals only.  The 
logic on Transport Usage deals will remain as it is currently - Delivery 
Point (To) - posts to the SITARA deal.

If you have any questions, please give me a call at X39222.

Chao!

Subject: Prelminary Findings on Deals Not Bridging

I've attached a spreadsheet showing deals that were not bridged to Unify for 
November.  Please don't let this alarm you, this is how the bridge has always 
worked.  If you have questions or would like to discuss, please let me know.

Every instance I've found looks okay because of the following:

* A Transport Ut ticket on the same pipe was the deal
* The deal was killed
* The deal was entered as a mistake buy and should of been a sell hence the 
Inactive state in Unify
* The deal was a demand based deal price with no volumes
* The deal didn't have a point assigned to it, only a zone

Thanks

Revision in bold.  Pass on to any who may need this.

In order to provide the ability to track transport expense by Desk, Sitara 
was modified to allow multiple Transport Capacity tickets for the same 
Service Contract provided that they are for different desks and only one is 
tagged as "Primary".  Here is the procedure for setting up new Capacity 
tickets to reflect the "other" desks:

a.  You will probably first notice this via a warning/error message in Path 
Manager when building a new path.  The message will read something like   
"Source/Destination 123456 for desk IMCT does not match Service contract 3434 
and will be removed."
b.  Make note of the deal number in the Service List of the Service contract 
that you were using in the new path.
c.  Open that Transport Capacity deal in Sitara.  Then hit Copy.
d.  On the new deal:
 Change the Buyer from the old desk to the new desk that matches the Supply 
or Market deal that you are pathing with.  If it a deal for which we are 
  agent, then don't change the Buyer but instead change the Agent to the new 
desk.  The "primary" deal will carry the actual Agent.  The Agent
  contract will get cleared.  Re-select the Agent Contract.
 Changing the Buyer causes the Contract field to get blanked out.  Re-select 
the Pipeline contract.
 Just above the various exchange line items is a Primary Deal check box.  
Un-check it.
 On each exchange line item, change the MDQ to zero and for any Negotiated 
rates, uncheck them as well.  The "primary" deal will carry the MDQ and
  any negotiated Demand, Commodity or fuel.
 Hit Release.
e.  You may need to re-retrieve Path Manager.  You should see the Deal number 
in the Service list now read "Multiple".  Right-click/Service Deals will list 
the  specific deals.
f.  Re-build the path as you originally desired.  The warning/error message 
should not appear again.

This could occur for any combination of Desk and Service Contract.
Please file this in your "Call Dave If I Can't Find This" folder.

Thanks, d.n.

Matt / Ben:

I am responding to your request for comments on revising path manager by expanding the parameters of the path termination process to include zero volume paths on the last day of the month as a way to speed up Unify response and retrieve times.  

Based on my interviews of various desks including AEP and Calgary and our recent discussions, we find a legitimate business need to allow zero volume paths to roll from month to month (requirements contracts on wellhead gas).  Following is a recap of what is PROPOSED to be done regarding zero path termination.

1.  All paths that are zero on the last day of a month  (exception noted in #2 below)  will terminate on that day and WILL NO LONGER roll into the following month.
	This path termination out function will run every night.  Any paths changed to zero retroactively will zero out future month's paths UNLESS a volume 
	is on that path in the future month.

2.  Zero Paths marked as "always send nominations" WILL CONTINUE to roll from month to month until changed to some other nomination option.  It appears that HPL
	(736 paths) and NIGAS (1136 paths) might have some paths rolling that no longer need to.  A special one time handling of these paths will be coordinated with the
	scheduler when you are ready.

3.  Zero paths which roll from month to month using the "Volume Management - Do Not Send" function will CEASE to do so.  This was agree to by Patti in regards to 
	paths for OBA tracking.

ALL:
Please respond via e-mail with any comments.

Stacey,

It looks like your missing paths revealed a quirk in our suppression of zero 
paths.  There were 4 paths initially entered as zero, then changed to 
non-zero on a later date.  The system did not correctly determine that the 
zero path should no longer be suppressed.

We have fixed the 4 paths affected and have corrected the code so this won't 
happen any more.  Below is a screen print of the Nov 22 problem that is now 
fixed.

Thanks, d.n.

Please take note of Dave's very important  message regarding Sitara 
positions. We absolutely cannot afford to go through this again and need to 
do everything  possible to help limit the exposure. With prices where they 
are and winter weather upon us we will most likely have a very challenging 
bid week. 

That being said I want each of you to make sure we adhere to the "daily 
clean" process. You should pull all the necessary reports each day and keep 
after the schedulers to make sure they are up to date. If you wish, Donna and 
Richard can make these available each day and distribute to the group. We 
don't have much time so this needs to happen immediately.

Donna, please provide me with a daily summary of all the desks for the 
remainder of the month. 


Let me know if you have any questions or concerns, thanks - Bob

Subject: Sitara positions, end of month feedback from Unify

Bob, et al,

As I am sure you recall, we had a problem with Sitara positions earlier in 
the month and had to cease trading early and revert to CPR for positions.  
Although I have not gotten very far in my transition off of Unify and onto 
Sitara and TDS, we do see some potential for this happening again towards the 
end of this month and the beginning of next month.

The problem with managing positions is a combination of sheer deal counts, 
along with updates to those deals.  A large portion of these updates come to 
Sitara via the Unify Bridge Back process.  It would be ideal if we could 
continue to have the Unify data "cleaned/scrubbed" week to week and try to 
avoid having the bulk of the month being updated/bridged in the final 
week/days of the month.  I know this is the goal of Logistics, but I just 
want to help reinforce that goal due to the performance impact it can have on 
the Gas Trading systems.  Perhaps a few extra pair of eyes on the Pipeline 
Exception Summary and the Bridge Back Pipeline Summary in Unify this month 
would help.

Another area that causes these transaction counts to increase is the need to 
have 2 months "active" at a time.  In other words, when November is over and 
we are in the first week or two of December, Sitara continues to maintain 
positions for November.  This November data degrades the ability to update 
December positions in a timely manner.  We may find ourselves having to 
remove the November deals from the Sitara positions sooner than we have in 
the past.

I will be trying to work with the Sitara team in the coming days/weeks to 
implement some combination of quick fixes, as well as look into the long term 
changes necessary to support our increased trading business.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments in this area.

Thanks, d.n.

Beginning this week, we are actively testing the changes to Path Manager to 
receive real-time deal updates from Sitara.  To prepare for this, we would 
like to have a limited group of schedulers from each desk go thru a quick 
walkthru/training of the new features sometime early next week.  This should 
only take about 30 minutes.  Once they are comfortable with the features and 
performance, and once the testing is complete, we would like to migrate this 
to Unify Production either next week or the week after.  This should give us 
an adequate adjustment period prior to the next bid week.

Once it is migrated to Production, we can either roll it out to all 
schedulers or to selected schedulers via security.

Heather, could you please schedule some time with the designated schedulers, 
Scotty, and myself early next week.  A room with a projector would work best.

Thanks, d.n.

In order to provide the ability to track transport expense by Desk, Sitara 
was modified to allow multiple Transport Capacity tickets for the same 
Service Contract provided that they are for different desks and only one is 
tagged as "Primary".  Here is the procedure for setting up new Capacity 
tickets to reflect the "other" desks:

a.  You will probably first notice this via a warning/error message in Path 
Manager when building a new path.  The message will read something like   
"Source/Destination 123456 for desk IMCT does not match Service contract 3434 
and will be removed."
b.  Make note of the deal number in the Service List of the Service contract 
that you were using in the new path.
c.  Open that Transport Capacity deal in Sitara.  Then hit Copy.
d.  On the new deal:
 Change the Buyer from the old desk to the new desk that matches the Supply 
or Market deal that you are pathing with.  If it a contract for which we are 
  agent, then don't change the Buyer but instead change the Agent to the new 
desk.  The "primary" deal will carry the actual Agent.
 Changing the Buyer causes the Contract field to get blanked out.  Re-select 
the contract.
 Just above the various exchange line items is a Primary Deal check box.  
Un-check it.
 On each exchange line item, change the MDQ to zero and for any Negotiated

>From Matt's response it sounds like you might want to specify exception personnel for 8-12, 12 thru 4:00, and 4 thru 6 Normal business hours and not end of the month, holidays or long weekends.

yes, you are correct.  when we watchdog, we'll most likely do VM and Settlements and not PM.  But, in the afternoon, if they need payments out the door, PM will get it.  It goes both ways.  So, if you send me who needs to be in the system no matter what, that would help.  

you are correct, 8-12 is logistics critical, and after that it's anyones guess.

Based on Victor's response, I think there is some confusion.  There are actually several critical time periods depending on the group and time of day.  Perhaps to eliminate the confusion you could specify which time period you are going to watchdog.  I interpreted it to mean the 8-12 AM period but Victor was thinking the afternoon.  Depending on the time there might be different people who should be kicked out.

The critical users on the east desk using path manager will be Meredith Homco, Clarissa Garcia, Christina Sanchez and Victor Lamadrid. If you could alert us as to when y'all are invoking watchdog to kick logistics out, that would be great.  THANKS

Going forward, as a precautionary measure, we will begin locking users out of the system if the need arises.  We will use our Watchdog application in order to initiate this process.  We will do so only as a last resort and will notify you that we will be doing this.  Our reasons for doing this are mainly to ensure the critical system resources are provided to the users that need them the most.

The old list we had from Sybase no longer exists.  I need your help in putting together a new list.  Please provide the list of people who ARE ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL users that have to be on the system.  Obviously, the situation isn't remedied if everyone is an exception user :)

Please provide User Name and Application they need (i.e. Volume Management, Settlements, Path Manager).

The sooner I get this, the sooner we can get this implemented.

Thanks!

Desk Managers, 

I will be issuing a small laminated version of the attached list of contacts for escalation of Unify and EDI issues in a small laminated version.  The objective in putting Richard first on the list is to address any issues that are business related or education related prior to getting IT folks involved; thereby, freeing up our IT folks to work on programming fixes and enhancements.  

<<EscalationProcedures.xls>> 

After implementation, if you feel these escalation procedures are not providing the level of support your desk requires, please let me know. 

Regards, 

Tammy

To clarify the memo that I sent yesterday concerning Buyer vs. Seller on 
Intercompany deals, I want to make sure that everyone understands that not 
only will the Seller side post on the SITARA deal but that the Volume 
Feedback Reconciliation report  will reflect the error(s) associated with the 
buy side as well.  It will no longer show the the error(s) generated by the 
sales side as it currently does.  This change will coincide with the way SAP 
reports Intercompany transactions.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Note: The Volume Feedback Reconciliation report is the report which I 
distribute on a daily basis.

Thanks,
RHP

It has been brought to my attention that SAP will not use the Buyer as the 
governing value associated with Intercompany deals but the Seller.  
Currently, SITARA captures the volume bridged back on the buy side not the 
sales side.  I wanted to make sure that those of you who would be impacted by 
the change were aware of how SITARA would reflected the volumes associated 
with Intercompany deals.  If there are any concerns with this, please let me 
know as soon as possible.  I will need to have an adjustment made to the 
Volume Feedback Reconciliation report to reflect this change once it has been 
finalized.   It may be a month or two before this is implemented but I wanted 
to make sure everyone had advance notice.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at X39222.

Thanks,
RHP
