Larry,
Call Kimberly or Gina and talk to them about how they would suggest doing 
this.  They are both great people to work with and have been so helpful on 
other initiatives.  I know they will have some ideas.  It may be that EBIZ 
could be used or some other internal company media.   John

John, I just spoke with Dan Walker, Vice President  of Development for the 
Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation about Enron's initiative for a corporation 
partnership.  After we had discussed our interest and desire and what 
opportunities are available with the Foundation for Enron, Dan stated that 
will be visiting with the Foundation's CEO next week and one of the issues to 
be discussed will be development of  an MOU or Agreement between Enron and 
the RMEF.  Looks like things are beginning to progress.

Im having quite a bit of interest from some of the Houston based Enron 
employees about how they can get involved.  Any suggestions on how I can 
"advertise" opportunities within the Corporation for employee involvement 
with the RMEF?

Well, I would suggest that you include some example of potential activities 
(not limited to them only, but they are possibly representatives of the types 
of activities that the RMEF could expect.  These might include:  the use of 
heavy equipment (e.g., bulldozer, road grader, backhoe, etc) to do dirt work 
or relocate materials from one place to another; to use volunteer field 
employees to  perform agreed to work on RMEF projects (e.g., fence building 
and/or repair, demolish any old structures, buildings, corrals, loading pens, 
feeding and/or watering stations, etc.); to plant wildlife feed plots, etc.  
Of course, all of this type work would only be done if both parties to the 
agreement had agreed as to the type of work, timing, expense, etc.  ETS will 
provide supplies and materials needed for all projects that are agreed to by 
both (unless a third party has already agreed to provide the supplies 
needed).  You could also add that ETS would consider the funding of certain 
auction items for local chapter banquets and/or purchase a table at such 
local banquets where we have employees that will attend.  

If this kind of detail is not what he is looking for, then we might have a 
serious problem in going forward.  If he is looking for specific details of a 
project - then you will have to wait until you get a team ready to offer a 
project to the RMEF for their specific consideration.  However, that will not 
be the overall umbrella agreement that I would like to get in place.

Let me know if this is a problem.  John

Larry,

Thank you for sending me a copy of the MOU between you and NWTF.  The RMEF,
while interested in working with you, will need more substance behind the
partnership and how we intended to work together.  I'm up to my neck in a
restructuring process through the end of the month or I would offer some
recommendations.

If you would like to take a crack at a draft MOU with specific details
associated with the partnership, I would be happy to review another draft.
In November, I should have a bit more time to spend on this opportunity.  If
you are simply looking for a local partnership to work on projects, I will
steer you to Alan or one of our local staff members in the region.

Again, thank you for the interest and I look forward to working with you on
a mutually beneficial partnership.

Dan

Ivan,  the reason that you're having such a hard time making contact, is 
because the Foundation is going through some changes in their management. 
They are having a big pow-wow  this week to get things straightened out.  The 
new CEO will be a person named Ron Marcoux, and I  will be speaking with him 
next week.  In the interim, I have been working out some issues with the New 
Mexico/Texas Director and am scheduled  to meet with the Arizona Director in 
a couple of weeks.  Its pretty exciting to see the support from others in 
Enron.  Based upon initial contacts with the Missoula headquarters and 
regional directors, habitat conservation efforts are where the Foundation is 
placing a large part of its emphasis.   Ill keep you apprised of the 
partnership and how others can get involved after my discussions with the 
Foundations new CEO........

Larry  - Sorry for the delay, but with PRC, life in HR has been pretty
intense.  I also made some initial contacts with the RMEF and have only
managed to play phone tag with the people I really needed to talk to.
Sounds like you've had better luck.

My approach was to look at a way to partner with the RMEF with their land
and habitat conservation programs on a national level rather than focusing
on any particular state.  Hopefully this would encourage broad based Enron
employee support and not foster any state biased partisanship.

Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation contact I tried is:

     Tony Schoonen
     VP Marketing
     Missoula, MT
     406/523-3432

Other Enron Employees I discussed this endeavor with and have indicated
their support are: Ken Crowl (Omaha), Virgil Pfennig (Iowa), & Ty McNeil
(Clifton, KS).

Others that might be interested are: Bob Besecker (Hugoton, KS), Roger Buck
(South Omaha), Andy Gieser (Omaha), Bill Sugg (Glasgow, MT), Ray Knox
(Clifton, KS), Joe Hill (Wolf Point, MT), Ron Omsberg (Mandan, ND), John
Nelson (North Branch, MN), Don Keller (Beatrice, NE), Larry Lottman
(Beatrice, NE), Steve Stedman (Beatrice, NE), Dale Johns (Palmyra, NE),
Kurt Weber (Beatrice, NE), Scott Finkbiner (Glasgow, MT), Bob Hopkins (Wolf
Point, MT), Roger Westfall (Omaha), & Jeff Boyce (Glen Ullin, ND).

All these are from my previous experience in North Operations.  As I
develop relationships as HR Rep for SE Operations, I am sure I will find
more interested employees.

Let me know what you think we should do from here.

Ivan, I had an opportunity to make contact with the Rocky Mountain Elk
Foundation.  I have contacted the Montana office, which is  the national
headquarters and they have steered me to contacts in New Mexico and
Arizona.  I have met with the New Mexico RMEF contact and he is extremely
interested in GPG involvement and assistance.  I plan on meeting the
Arizona contact in the near future.  If you will steer me on to the states
you and other Enron employees would be interested in providing some
volunteer time and efforts, Id be glad to do the initial RMEF contact for
you.  Let me know at your convenience.....

   Randy, about a month ago, you passed along a name to me of an employee
   that had expressed an interest in developing a partnership with the
   RMEF.  During the conversation with him, he was supposed to check with
   his relatives for a contact name for the RMEF.  I havent heard from him
   since that conversation.  Would you please help me out with his name and
   telephone number.  I want to check with him and see if he is still
   interested.  If not, Im going to pursue a partnership effort  through
   the New Mexico and Arizona chapters of the foundation.

   Thanks for your help.

Dan, sorry about taking so long it getting back to you about this, but I had 
a couple of crises I had to address,  Im still realing from the impact.  I 
have attached for your review the agreement which we are in the process of 
finalizing with the Wild Turkey Federation.  Take a look at the document and 
let me know what you think.  After your review we can make the necessary 
changes and modifications.  I have been advised by our legal department that 
each of the three major pipelines owned and operated by Enron will need a 
separate contract, with the RMEF, so what we decide for Transwestern, will 
undoubtably work for the others.  Thanks for your patience in this.
