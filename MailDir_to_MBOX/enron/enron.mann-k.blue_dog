How about "The Deal Might Not Happen LLC". In a call yesterday, Northwestern 
proposed changing the economic terms significantly, which would reduce our 
gross margin by more than half. We are awaiting a written proposal.

It probably makes sense to go ahead anyway with the formation of the LLC, 
because we'll eventually need it even if this particular deal does not close. 
How about Merchant Energy Ventures, L.L.C. ?

Let's catch up tomorrow.

Regards,

Ben

Thanks for the e-mail. I also got your voice-mail. We will of course wrap up 
all outstanding items on change orders quickly. Also, rest assured, we intend 
to give you ample notice of project location, etc. for the units after we're 
sure we have a deal for a joint project with the customer. 

As I mentioned in our call, please let me know if you will be able to improve 
the delivery date on the air filter for unit 1 as we have been advised that 
it is presently scheduled for a June 15 delivery date.

Thanks much for looking into this, and for the e-mail below.

Dear Ben,
I have asked Gib Bosworth of GE Power Sys in Arizona to call you about the
availability of the 2 units we call Blue Dog.  He has a customer who is
interested in the units because of their timing.  I have advised him you are
also closely working with others for these turbines.

Attached is a copy of the invoice that we issued for the storage of Unit #1.
This invoice has not been paid.  I believe you are waiting for the signing
of the contract change order.  Neither of us expected this process to take
this long.

As we have an agreement that the equipment will be stored, and we agree on
the price of the storage, I am requesting that this invoice be paid
immediately.

Carlos,

I am working with NorthWestern in a negotiation similar to the Panda or Delta 
deal regarding the placement of a turbine.  NorthWestern has requested a 
draft of what the amended LLC document will look like, in particular, what 
rights and control will Enron have?  I would appreciate if you could send me 
a draft that I can forward to NorthWestern to further our negotiations.  We 
are working on an expedited schedule and would appreciate a quick response.  
Please advise when the document will be ready.

Thanks

Chris

Catherine:  Lisa phoned me and said she would give you a heads up that this 
second change order needed review and quick turn around.  Coincidentally, Kay 
Mann is reviewing change order # 1 and will be looking into the change from 
LJM to E-Next Generation language implications.  Hopefully the comments on 
one will apply to the other.  Suggest you call Kay straight away to save time.

I am attaching both for your convenience.  I look forward to you comments.  
By the way Kay; GE is looking it over right now too, and Scott Dieball has 
been asked to review.  I Scott's review is not necessary please let me know.

Matt,

Why do I have to pay for the cranes at GE's factory to get the turbine on a 
rail car?  Section 10.2 1 states that the Seller shall be responsible for 
loading Purchaser's mode of transportation upon arrival to the Delivery Point.

Also, I would expect crane would also be available at New Port News (major 
shipyard) and Houston to off-load the turbine and or generator.

Chris

Subject: Cost Breakout for Blue Dog #1 storage

Chris,

In response to your inquiry, the following is the cost breakout for the GE 
storage quote:

$50,000 = Long Term Preservation Procedures on the GTG
$198, 000 = Transportation to the storage yard (contract ref: Exhibit N-1)
$78,500 = Handling Costs (cranes) to upload on the method of transportation
$78,500 = Handling Costs (cranes) to offload in the storage yard
$64,000 = Storage costs through 30 JUN 01 (16k per month for MAR, APR, MAY, & 
JUN)

TOTAL = $469,000

Costs that are incurred "up-front" are 1,2,3,& 4.  After discussing this with 
GE, this is their Lump Sum price.

As you know, I just love to pile on. I took what I think are the latest form 
docs and made some changes to incorporate additional commercial terms I want 
to go out with. Please review the attached clean and redline drafts. In the 
interest of time, would it be OK for Caroline to review (I've really got 
people chomping at the bit).

Thanks,

Ben

want to make sure I'm looking at the right stuff.

Subject: Northwestern Offer Letter

Chris, prior to our call this afternoon, I wanted to alert you to one term
that was discussed in our Monday telephone call that I inadvertently left
out of the letter you received yesterday.  Specifically, we would want the
Enron carry to continue until September 1, 2001.  Thus, Northwestern would
be obligated to close on the transaction (and get Enron its money) on or
before this date.  Again, this specific term was discussed in the Monday
call and left out of the letter.  I apologize for the oversight.  Let me
know if this is a problem.

Nearly final docs.

The change they want in the LLC is the addition of a statement indicating 
that for tax purposes this is a  single member LLC, or something like that.

The promissory note is felt to be necessary due to the adjustment mechanism 
for any change orders.  Has something to do with them getting all the basis.

Hi there,

I've made some suggested changes on the CO you sent.  In the interest of time 
I'm sending this to David Marshall, since this largely deals with ROL and 
insurance, and I couldn't tell if he has read this previously.

Thanks,

Chris:

1. I have not analyzed the TurboPark deal to determine what would constitute 
an event of default in that deal and at the same time preclude our ability to 
exercise our call option. Finance / Accounting have not provided specific 
guidance on this.

2. We have spoke to GE. We have advised them of the deal with Northwestern. 
We do not believe the acknowledgement and consent will be a problem, and that 
it will follow the same discussion process as has been going on regarding 
Pastoria.

3. NW does not have negotiating rights on the acknowledgement and consent. 
They must accept it to the extent the one we receive for this deal is 
substantially the same as the one for Pastoria (we've attached the Pastoria 
form to the letter agreement).

4. If NW flakes, we keep the $8 million, can sue them to close, and can 
resell the units. This remote scenario would likely provide us with 
additional upside.

5. The only scenario that we don't get paid are the two scenarios outlined in 
my previous e-mail: we cannot obtain the GE acknowledgement and consent, or 
we otherwise cannot effect the assignment because of a default in E Next. NW 
does not have any other outs.

6. The income from the deal is expected to be at least $8 million, but could 
be as high as $10 million depending on the exact closing date, and potential 
LDs we may receive from GE. I've attached the DASH which contains an income 
analysis.

Regards,

Ben

Ben and Kay,

What is our performance obligation to E;Next?

Have we spoken to GE re consents?  Is GE going to be difficult because this 
is the Frame division, not the Lee J and the LM6000 team?

Does NW have any discretion / approval rights / negotiating rights w/ respect 
to the assignment to the LLC?

If NW flakes, can we keep the $8MM or do we have to resell and sue for any 
shortfall?

In what scenario(s) would we not get fully paid?

Assuming Sep 1, what is the income from this deal?

Subject: Northwestern Deal

Dave / Chris:

I wanted to give you both a heads up that the Northwestern (NW) GE 7EA deal 
should close today or tomorrow, and advise you of a related earnings 
recognition issue. 

The deal that we are on the path of closing is consistent with the executed 
DASH and works as follows: at the signing of the letter agreement, NW pays 
ENA $3 million, with another $5 million paid on July 15 (the Turbine 
Deposits). The balance of $40 million is paid by NW at such time as the 
assignment of the turbine contract is made to the LLC, and ENA sells the LLC 
member interests to NW. The outside date for this to occur, via a notice 
provided by NW, is Sept. 1. The $8 million paid by NW, and the obligation to 
purchase the member interests is a firm commitment guaranteed by Northwestern 
Corp. The only condition to NW's obligation to purchase the member interests 
is that ENA effect the assignment of the turbine contract into the LLC. If 
ENA does not effect the assignment, then NW would also be entitled to a 
return of the $8 million in Turbine Deposits. 

This structure is the same we followed for the Intergen deal which closed in 
January, except the Intergen deal did not have an extended period between the 
date of execution of the letter agreement, and the turbine contract 
assignment. In the Intergen deal, ENA did not receive any payments prior to 
the assignment and sale of the member interests.

The earnings issue raised by accounting (Herman Manis) is that, 
notwithstanding NW's firm commitment to purchase, ENA has two (albeit very 
minor) performance obligations. First, ENA has to obtain an Acknowledgement 
and Consent from GE prior to or concurrent with exercising its purchase 
option with E Next and assigning the turbine contract to the LLC  (we have 
had to do this for every turbine transaction). Second, ENA has to perform 
under its agreement with E Next in that if there is an event of default prior 
to the time we effect the assignment, we theoretically could loose our 
purchase option right with E Next and be unable to perform under our 
agreement with NW. We have suggested to Herman that both of these items are 
perfunctory in nature, and that all income from this transaction should be 
recognized upon execution of the letter agreement, We have further stated 
that we could obtain a letter from GE solving the first issue, but there is 
no solution to the second issue. Herman advised us that to the extent we 
receive a letter from GE on the first issue, and can convince Arthur Anderson 
that the second item is perfunctory in nature, we could recognize all income 
upon execution of the letter agreement (prior to the actual assignment of the 
turbine contract to the LLC). He did not think we had a good case relative to 
the second issue, and is reluctant to approach Arthur Anderson.

Thus, based on the above, in a worst case we may not be able to recognize any 
income form this transaction until Q3. While we think we have a shot at 
getting accounting to change their position, we do not think that this 
outcome should change our position on the deal as the underlying 
profitability is significant. The deal is also consistent with the approved 
DASH. We therefore recommend that we proceed with the execution of the letter 
agreement, and then decide as to how we should proceed on the income 
recognition issue depending on your views regarding income being recognized 
in Q2 vs. Q3.

Please advise me if you are OK with us closing on the deal as scheduled, or 
if you have any other questions.

Regards,

Ben

Hi Rose,

NorthWestern has requested these minor changes. What do you think?

Subject: NW

We had our daily phone call with NW.  I don't know that we really have 
significant  points of disagreement.  They understand that we are working 
some accounting issues, and they have a general idea of what we want to do.  
I suggested that we come up with the work arounds with our accountants, and I 
will think about it this weekend.  I have a couple of ideas but I really want 
to mull it over.

They look forward to receiving the turbine contract.  Chris, could you 
forward the draft change orders with it?

One point they raised is that they want the ability (with GE consent) to have 
us refund the future payment due to GE (less 7% for time value of money), 
retaining the payment obligation.  All of this is post closing.  They are 
putting up a full blown parent guaranty to GE for the turbine contract, and 
since the payment should only be around $4mm, that would probably be 
acceptable to GE.  

Keffer et al will issue revised documents tonight.  There are no calls 
scheduled tomorrow or this weekend, giving everyone "quiet time" to review 
the contract.  Other than the accting issues, this should be about it. 

We deferred discussions about an extension until Monday.

Kay

Kay:

Enclosed is a revised draft of the proposed letter agreement for the 7EA
turbines reflecting Ben's business points and the matters discussed in our
telephone conference earlier today.  Also enclosed is a blacklined copy
reflecting revisions from the December 15, 2000 draft of the prototype
letter agreement.  Although we have enclosed a blacklined draft reflecting
revisions from the final draft of the CA/ED-I letter agreement, this is
difficult to read due to our re-arrangement of the reps and warranties.  If
you have any questions or comments, please advise.  (I have received the
courier package with the GE Facility Agreements).

Marguerite:

In an effort to finalize the documents that will need to be executed at
closing, I have taken the liberty of drafting two written consents: one of
the Members of Montana Megawatts I, LLC electing NorthWestern Generation I,
LLC as the sole Manager, and the other of the sole Manager of the LLC
replacing the officers and approving the loans from ENA and NorthWestern
Generation I, LLC.  Let me know if you have any comments to the drafts.
Apart from these consents, we will need to coordinate to draft a joint
instruction letter to Citibank.

Regards,

Marisa

Attached please find an initial draft of the First Amended and Restated
Limited Liability Company Agreement for Project Blue Dog.  I am also
including a marked copy of the same that illustrates all of the
modifications that I made to the Delta form that you e-mailed to me
yesterday.

Two questions came to mind as I was preparing the draft.  First, if, as
stated in Section 2(b) of the Letter Agreement, the Turbine Contract is
between LLC and GE, why does the ENA have to cause the LLC to acquire such
rights?  No immediate answer jumped out at me upon reviewing the Turbine
Contract.  Second, I wasn't sure if the year in Sections 6.2(a) and (c)
needed to be 2001 or 2002.  Please let me know.

Regards,

Marisa

Ben,

The latest version of the change order for storage to Unit 1 specifically 
states:

"Subject to Section 2.4 above, Seller shall retain risk of damage and loss 
under the Agreement and shall be responsible for the care, maintenance 
custody and control of Unit 1 while in storage.  For the purpose of 
determination of Warranty obligations under the Agreement, the delivery of 
the last Major Component of Unit 1 to Seller's storage facility in undamaged 
condition shall be deemed completion of Unit 1 delivery to the Delivery 
Point.  Such Unit 1 delivery date shall be used in the interpretation of 
Section 14.1.1 of the Agreement."

Chris / Kay:

I talked with John today and told him about Northwestern. I basically said we 
were close to agreement on doing a project in Montana for the first unit, 
with the destination of the second undetermined at this time. I asked him not 
to disclose this to the rest of GE until our deal is signed. He was very 
positive on this.

I also mentioned the air filter, and he stated that he thought the LD clock 
stopped when the unit was put into storage. I suggested that both GE and 
Enron look into this to make sure we're in agreement before we bring a 
partner in. He appreciated the suggestion and told me Jeff Darst would get 
back to me.

Chris - in the meantime, could you please review the contract on this point?

Thanks.

Ben

Please find attached a copy of the latest revision of Change Order 1 to the 
Blue Dog contract with GE.  The attached letter from Jeff Darst is now gone, 
but GE is insisting that warranty language be included to the Change Order.  
I've talked to Jeff Darst about removing the language and had his verbal 
agreement that some of the language could be removed, but just received 
written comments back from him today with not only the same warranty wording, 
but some additional warranty language in Part III.  These changes would be 
added to Section 14.1.2 Warranty Clarifications in the contract.

Please review this Change Order and let me know if we can live with these 
warranty provisions.  Otherwise, we will need to talk directly to Jeff's 
attorney and commercial people to get it resolved.  Please also provide me 
with any additional comments so that I may route this Change Order for 
execution.

Brian, is there an EECC attorney that needs to review this Change Order as 
well.  Please advise.

Thanks

The Escrow Agreement that is attached appears to be in final form and
contains all of the changes that we requested.  As a result, will you
overnight the sig pages and the incumbency certificate to Tremaine Wright?
If you prefer, you can courier the documents to my attention, and I can
coordinate getting them to Paul Hastings.  Tremaine needs 3 sig pages and 1
incumbency certificate.  Thanks.

Renee-

I understand your need to incorporate the actual changes into the change 
order itself as opposed to an attachment.    After reading GE's (Jeff 
Darst's) document, I can't easily extract from it what you need.  I need to 
write something from scratch.  Instead of trading several emails with 
yourself and Jeff Darst, it would be more efficient for me to give Jeff a 
call myself to come up with something acceptable to the both of us which also 
meets your requirements below.  (I'm thinking that the actual scope items 
should be in your change order and GE's requirements/recommendations for the 
future modifications can be attached -- Much the same way their standard 
specs are attached to a purchase contract. ) 

I'm in Austin today and tomorrow (Thursday) and will be back in the office on 
Friday.  If you can't wait, or need to talk to me before that, give me a call 
on my cell phone (713) 412-6873.

Hope this helps.
Eric

Subject: Blue Dog Max, comments on draft CO # 1

Eric,

I need to incorporate the essential parts of what Jeff Darst refers to as 
Attachment 2 below (91209_14 Jul 2000_Chiller Provisions.doc) into the Change 
Order, not as an attachment.  This Attachment contains specifications as to 
what they are providing as well as stipulations as to how we are to install 
the inlet chillers.  I need to know which are the specifications as to what 
they are providing and how the scope is being changed.  I'm not concerned 
with their recommendations of how we are to install the inlet chillers since 
that is our scope and our liability/warranty.

Please separate out the scope items that need to be included in the Change 
Order and provide me with the wording so that I may get another draft of this 
Change Order out for review.

If you want to get together to discuss, please give me a call.

Thanks

Brian,

We are in agreement with the language you proposed for Change Order #2 with
the following exception;

We suggest that the first sentence of the revision of 2.6 be retained but
that the balance of the provision be deleted and substituted with the
following:

> Purchaser and Seller agree that the Primary Warranty Period for Unit 1
> Equipment placed into storage shall be determined in accordance with
> Article 14.1.1 of the Agreement except that the Primary Warranty Period
> shall end no later than thirty-six (36) months from the date the last
> Major Component of Unit 1 is delivered to Seller's storage facility in
> undamaged condition.
>
We believe the above wording is a compromise to satisfy your concern that
Unit 1 could be damaged in transit to the storage facility.  The above
wording extends the warranty period, at no cost to Enron, at least by a
duration equal to the transit time to storage .

It is our hope that we can proceed from here.

Regards,

Jeff

Jeff & Tony:  The agreement as I understand it is to develop the Performance 
Test Guidelines and Emissions Test Guidelines currently in the Contract, to 
include the infoormation, criteria and details for testing on liquid fuel 
too.  We should not change what exhist for natural gas, without full advance 
agreement by GE.  These guidelines will completely supersede Exhibits F and 
F-2 in the Contract so that people will only have to look in one place for 
them.  Tony and Jeff must get together to agree on the start point for 
updating the guidelines for liquid fuel.  Jeff suggested TECO because his 
internal review has already been performed on that contract.

Attached is my latest draft addressing the comments below.  I agree that we 
need to add the liquid fuel composition to Exhibit A-1, and Chris Booth 
informed me that the Site conditons will remain the same.  Then I am still 
waiting for Chris or Tony to tell me if any additional Basis Conditions are 
need (like water injection rate or minimum lilquid fuel pressure at ...) 
other than the liquid fuel composition.  

If Kay Mann and Rose Engeldorf (legal for ENA & E-Next) have anything that 
needs to be added, I'll let you know right away.

Please compare to the Rev 0a to see the changes

ct with GE


Brian,

The following are our comments to CO #3:

First page after title page; title and section 1 should refer to Change
Order No. 3 not No. 2.

In section 2, refer to Section 11.2 instead of 5.5.2.

2.3  In the second line, for clarity, I suggest we change the words "when
operated on liquid fuel set forth in Attachment 3" to read "when operated on
liquid fuel having the composition specified in Attachment 3".

2.3  The section refers to "Net Electrical Output" and "Net Heat Rate" and
"Emissions". The terms should be "Adjusted Electrical Output" and "Adjusted
Heat Rate" and "Adjusted Emissions" to be consistent with the terminology of
the base contract.

2.3  When corrected to basis conditions, will the methods described in
Exhibit F to the base contract for use in making corrections in the case of
natural gas apply equally to liquid fuel?  If not, appropriate changes to
Exhibit F should be made.

2.4  To the end of the sentence add the words "and shall be subject to the
mutual agreement of the parties."

2.5  Is your intent to expand Exhibit A to include the basis conditions for
liquid fuel?  Most of the conditions are the same.  The only changes would
be Fuel Composition (actually, Exhibit A-1 should be expanded to include the
Basis Liquid Fuel) and adding the Fuel LHV for liquid fuel.

2.6  To the end of the sentence add the words "and shall be subject to the
mutual agreement of the parties."

Attachment 1 prices the dual fuel adder at $1,455,000.  It should be
$1,445,000.

Chris, Tony, Jeff:

Here is the first, cut.  You can see that the Attachments need information.
I will insert the GEI liquid fuel specification since it is a PDF file.
Chris, Jeff gave you till Friday to provide the liquid fuel composition
without impact to production.  Please provide soonest.

Tony: I already sent you the contract so you can see what Basis Conditions
need to be added and what testing guidelines too.

Jeff:  What do you see is missing?

This needs to be "TurboParked" (parties changed, GFinance advised).  Is there 
any special deal on payment for the change order?

I'll figure out how to change the signature lines, etc.

Chris:
 
Are we already paying GE for the change order? Is GE pushing to have this 
resolved? Pending input from Kay, I would like to hold off documenting it 
until we deal with the contract assignment and ultimate disposition of the 
unit.

Please follow up with Kay.

Thanks,

Chris,

On behalf of Matt Tezyk, please find attached below the Blue Dog Change Order 
for ENA's signature.  This had fallen through the cracks and Matt said that 
you would be handling it for me.  Thank you very much.

Once ENA has signed off on two (2) originals of the Change Order, you may 
return them to me at 3AC 712A.  I will then forward them to Jeffrey Darst for 
his signature.  Copies of the fully executed change order will be distributed 
upon return from GE.

Jeff and Kay:

I have addressed Kays comments with regard to CO 2:

1. RE: Section 2.6 and Jeff's comment to end Warranty on March 11, 2004.  
Under the Contract, the Primary Warranty period has a sunset date of 36 
months after completion of delivery of each Unit.  If I knew for certain that 
March 11, 2001 that the Unit would be in storage, I would have no problem 
acknowledging that the sunset date would be March 11, 2004.  If we establish 
the storage facility as the Delivery Point, then the Contract language takes 
us to the same point, and I do not have to hold my breath while the train 
moves the CT to the storage facility.  In addition, I want to keep the 
Primary Warranty Period the same for all the parts of the Unit 1, so the 
final delivery to storage should start the clock running for the purposes of 
the Installation Period, deemed Acceptance, and the 36 months sunset date in 
Contract Section 14.1.1, as I have now drafted C.O. 2, Section 2.6.

2. RE: Section 2.11 and Kay's comment that except for the cosmetic 
deterioration we address in C.O. 2, Section 2.4, it seems the language could 
be interpreted that I am letting GE off the hook for all liability when risk 
of damage and loss passes per this section.  I have added clarifying language 
to say that GE does not shed its liability accrued while Unit 1 was under its 
control just because risk of damage and loss passes to someone else for 
transportation to the Site.

Kay and Jeff:  Please let me know if I have properly represented the issues 
and provided satisfactory corrections.

Mr. Jacoby,

I understand that you are the appropriate individual at ENA to review the GE 
Change Order and have it executed by ENA.  I believed that Ace was going to 
contact you regarding the Change Order, but I cannot confirm this.

Please review the Change Order #1 attached below.  You may then print it out 
and have it executed by ENA prior to my sending it to GE or I can bring you 
two (2) originals for signature.

due to the move, I cannot determine who executed the original Agreement.  By

Attached is my cut at a closing checklist with timetables for distributing 
documents.  Please review and edit it appropriately.  In particular, please 
ensure that everything is addressed, including any additional items required 
under the Letter Agreement.  In general, there are two deadlines -- Friday 
for the form of Escrow Agreement (base it on the prior version, form of 
Guaranty (although the Buyer may want their own unique terms, we can at least 
present them with a form to expedite this process and ensure that our issues 
are properly addressed), and forms of promissory note (although the Buyer 
will want their own unique terms, we can at least present them with a form to 
expedite this process) so that once one Buyer is indentified then we can 
distribute those documents to them on Monday morning.  Then the other 
documents necessary for the transaction such as the transmittal letters and 
forms of membership certificates so that we can distribute those on Tuesday.  
The targeted execution dates that I have are Friday for the Letter Agreement 
and next Monday for the Closing.  Thanks and please call me with any 
questions.

When are you available today to get together and call Ben about the Blue Dog

Also, an attorney from King & Spalding (I believe she said her name was

the original closing documents for the Blue Dog/Northwestern transaction.  Do 
you know where these are?

Ben

The way we actually paid the invoices changed slightly after Chris had sent 
the letter to GE.  We deducted the LD's and the retention amount from the 
April 25th invoice (since the May invoice was not due until May 25th).

On May 8th, a wire totalling $1,671,039 was sent to GE -- this represented 
$469,000 for the c/o #2 invoice and $1,202,039 for the April 25th invoice 
less the LD's and retention.

To respond to Jeff Darst's letter, we can say that we are planning on paying 
the May 25th invoice in full (assuming we're not planning on deducting 
additional LD's for May 8-May 25).  

We just need to clarify with Jeff that both the LD and the retention were 
deducted from the April invoice, and then we can deal with resolving the 
issues he discusses in his letter.

Regards,
Rebecca

I am also attaching a list of Money Market investment options for review by
Northwestern as well as the appropriate tax forms and Incumbency Certificate
for establishing the new account.

Please do not hesitate to call me should you have any questions.

Andrea

Subject: Northwestern Deal

Dave / Chris:

I wanted to give you both a heads up that the Northwestern (NW) GE 7EA deal 
should close today or tomorrow, and advise you of a related earnings 
recognition issue. 

The deal that we are on the path of closing is consistent with the executed 
DASH and works as follows: at the signing of the letter agreement, NW pays 
ENA $3 million, with another $5 million paid on July 15 (the Turbine 
Deposits). The balance of $40 million is paid by NW at such time as the 
assignment of the turbine contract is made to the LLC, and ENA sells the LLC 
member interests to NW. The outside date for this to occur, via a notice 
provided by NW, is Sept. 1. The $8 million paid by NW, and the obligation to 
purchase the member interests is a firm commitment guaranteed by Northwestern 
Corp. The only condition to NW's obligation to purchase the member interests 
is that ENA effect the assignment of the turbine contract into the LLC. If 
ENA does not effect the assignment, then NW would also be entitled to a 
return of the $8 million in Turbine Deposits. 

This structure is the same we followed for the Intergen deal which closed in 
January, except the Intergen deal did not have an extended period between the 
date of execution of the letter agreement, and the turbine contract 
assignment. In the Intergen deal, ENA did not receive any payments prior to 
the assignment and sale of the member interests.

The earnings issue raised by accounting (Herman Manis) is that, 
notwithstanding NW's firm commitment to purchase, ENA has two (albeit very 
minor) performance obligations. First, ENA has to obtain an Acknowledgement 
and Consent from GE prior to or concurrent with exercising its purchase 
option with E Next and assigning the turbine contract to the LLC  (we have 
had to do this for every turbine transaction). Second, ENA has to perform 
under its agreement with E Next in that if there is an event of default prior 
to the time we effect the assignment, we theoretically could loose our 
purchase option right with E Next and be unable to perform under our 
agreement with NW. We have suggested to Herman that both of these items are 
perfunctory in nature, and that all income from this transaction should be 
recognized upon execution of the letter agreement, We have further stated 
that we could obtain a letter from GE solving the first issue, but there is 
no solution to the second issue. Herman advised us that to the extent we 
receive a letter from GE on the first issue, and can convince Arthur Anderson 
that the second item is perfunctory in nature, we could recognize all income 
upon execution of the letter agreement (prior to the actual assignment of the 
turbine contract to the LLC). He did not think we had a good case relative to 
the second issue, and is reluctant to approach Arthur Anderson.

Thus, based on the above, in a worst case we may not be able to recognize any 
income form this transaction until Q3. While we think we have a shot at 
getting accounting to change their position, we do not think that this 
outcome should change our position on the deal as the underlying 
profitability is significant. The deal is also consistent with the approved 
DASH. We therefore recommend that we proceed with the execution of the letter 
agreement, and then decide as to how we should proceed on the income 
recognition issue depending on your views regarding income being recognized 
in Q2 vs. Q3.

Please advise me if you are OK with us closing on the deal as scheduled, or 
if you have any other questions.

Regards,

Ben

Section 4(a) of the April 26th Letter Agreement provides that "NorSub will
pay directly to the Escrow Agrent all acceptance, setup, administration and
other fees associated with the Escrow Account and Escrow Agreement. "
Accordingly, I have revised the signature block to Citibank's original Fee
Letter to substitute NorthWestern Generation I, LLC for Enron North America
Corp.  A copy of the revised document is attached.  Please deliver an
executed copy of the Fee Letter along with the incumbency certificate and
the Form W-9.  Thanks.

Marguerite:

I have reviewed Citibank's mark-up and have only one comment.  Section 6(a)
changes the per annum escrow fee from $3,000 to $83,000, which is a
typographical error since the fee schedule sets the per annum fee at $8,000.
All other changes relate to form not substance.  Do you agree?  Please
confirm.  I will rely on you to address Citibank's question on page 11
regarding the organizational structure of NorthWestern Generation I, LLC.

As you know, NorthWestern will need to deliver a Form W-9 and a completed
incumbency certificate.  At your earliest convenience, please update me on
the status of these documents.  Pursuant to the terms of the Letter
Agreement, the escrow account needs to be set up before this weekend, so we
will need to coordinate efforts as quickly as possible.

Regards,

Marisa

Attached is a revised draft of the LLC Agreement which has been marked to
indicate the changes from the draft distributed on Friday, April 13.  Since
the most substantive change made to the LLC Agreement reflects
NorthWestern's desire to have the LLC treated as a single member limited
liability company for tax purposes, it might be a good idea to get your tax
team to sign off on the revised draft.  Call me if you have any questions.

Marisa

Chris / Kay:

I talked with John today and told him about Northwestern. I basically said we 
were close to agreement on doing a project in Montana for the first unit, 
with the destination of the second undetermined at this time. I asked him not 
to disclose this to the rest of GE until our deal is signed. He was very 
positive on this.

I also mentioned the air filter, and he stated that he thought the LD clock 
stopped when the unit was put into storage. I suggested that both GE and 
Enron look into this to make sure we're in agreement before we bring a 
partner in. He appreciated the suggestion and told me Jeff Darst would get 
back to me.

Chris - in the meantime, could you please review the contract on this point?

Thanks.

Ben

Kay:

Later this afternoon, I plan to send you preliminary drafts of the following
documents:

1. Revised Letter Agreement;
2. Escrow Agreement;
3. Guaranty Agreement; and
4. Promissory Note by LLC payable to ENA.

In the meantime, I had a couple of questions. First, since the Blue Dog deal
is a wholesale assignment of a contract, will I still need to prepare items
7 and 8 on the closing checklist (letter from ENA to Prospective Buyer to
deliver the form of Facility Agreement and letter from Buyer to ENA to
advise regarding the Form of Facility Agreement).  Second, will you send me
the blank certificates that will serve as the Membership Certificates for
the LLC?  Carolyn mentioned that, in the past, these certificates have come
from an Enron Stock Book.

Thanks,

Marisa

Gentlemen:

I would like to introduce into the contract the latest set of guidelines that 
we have agreed to with GE.  Those guidelines are currently for a power island 
type test at ARCOS, but they can easily be converted into a gas turbine only 
test.  Furthermore, the latest guidelines are much more precise, technically 
correct and reflect all of the agreements that GE and us have reached over 
the last year or so.  I understand that we do not want to go into a whole new 
set of reviews, etc, but I believe I can modify the ARCOS guidelines to 
address the testing of gas turbines (gas and oil) relatively quickly, get 
together with GE's performance engineer, go over the guidelines and have 
everybody agreeing rather rapidly.  We have a better document that what is 
currently in the contract for Blue Dog, why not use the better document?

Regards,

Tony

Subject: RE: Change Order #3 to Add Dual Fuel to Unit #2 in BlueDog Contra ct

Jeff & Tony:  The agreement as I understand it is to develop the Performance 
Test Guidelines and Emissions Test Guidelines currently in the Contract, to 
include the infoormation, criteria and details for testing on liquid fuel 
too.  We should not change what exhist for natural gas, without full advance 
agreement by GE.  These guidelines will completely supersede Exhibits F and 
F-2 in the Contract so that people will only have to look in one place for 
them.  Tony and Jeff must get together to agree on the start point for 
updating the guidelines for liquid fuel.  Jeff suggested TECO because his 
internal review has already been performed on that contract.

Attached is my latest draft addressing the comments below.  I agree that we 
need to add the liquid fuel composition to Exhibit A-1, and Chris Booth 
informed me that the Site conditons will remain the same.  Then I am still 
waiting for Chris or Tony to tell me if any additional Basis Conditions are 
need (like water injection rate or minimum lilquid fuel pressure at ...) 
other than the liquid fuel composition.  

If Kay Mann and Rose Engeldorf (legal for ENA & E-Next) have anything that 
needs to be added, I'll let you know right away.

Please compare to the Rev 0a to see the changes

Brian,

The following are our comments to CO #3:

First page after title page; title and section 1 should refer to Change
Order No. 3 not No. 2.

In section 2, refer to Section 11.2 instead of 5.5.2.

2.3  In the second line, for clarity, I suggest we change the words "when
operated on liquid fuel set forth in Attachment 3" to read "when operated on
liquid fuel having the composition specified in Attachment 3".

2.3  The section refers to "Net Electrical Output" and "Net Heat Rate" and
"Emissions". The terms should be "Adjusted Electrical Output" and "Adjusted
Heat Rate" and "Adjusted Emissions" to be consistent with the terminology of
the base contract.

2.3  When corrected to basis conditions, will the methods described in
Exhibit F to the base contract for use in making corrections in the case of
natural gas apply equally to liquid fuel?  If not, appropriate changes to
Exhibit F should be made.

2.4  To the end of the sentence add the words "and shall be subject to the
mutual agreement of the parties."

2.5  Is your intent to expand Exhibit A to include the basis conditions for
liquid fuel?  Most of the conditions are the same.  The only changes would
be Fuel Composition (actually, Exhibit A-1 should be expanded to include the
Basis Liquid Fuel) and adding the Fuel LHV for liquid fuel.

2.6  To the end of the sentence add the words "and shall be subject to the
mutual agreement of the parties."

Attachment 1 prices the dual fuel adder at $1,455,000.  It should be
$1,445,000.

Chris, Tony, Jeff:

Here is the first, cut.  You can see that the Attachments need information.
I will insert the GEI liquid fuel specification since it is a PDF file.
Chris, Jeff gave you till Friday to provide the liquid fuel composition
without impact to production.  Please provide soonest.

Tony: I already sent you the contract so you can see what Basis Conditions
need to be added and what testing guidelines too.

Jeff:  What do you see is missing?

Before we send anything other than the "thank you" e-mail I sent to Jeff, and 
before we have any conversations with GE on this point, we need to seek Kay's 
guidance based on her read of the contract and the issues Jeff raised in his 
letter.

Kay - will you have some time to talk about this Friday?

Ben

The way we actually paid the invoices changed slightly after Chris had sent 
the letter to GE.  We deducted the LD's and the retention amount from the 
April 25th invoice (since the May invoice was not due until May 25th).

On May 8th, a wire totalling $1,671,039 was sent to GE -- this represented 
$469,000 for the c/o #2 invoice and $1,202,039 for the April 25th invoice 
less the LD's and retention.

To respond to Jeff Darst's letter, we can say that we are planning on paying 
the May 25th invoice in full (assuming we're not planning on deducting 
additional LD's for May 8-May 25).  

We just need to clarify with Jeff that both the LD and the retention were 
deducted from the April invoice, and then we can deal with resolving the 
issues he discusses in his letter.

Regards,
Rebecca

Kay:

I am attaching a blackline of the Letter Agreement that includes
Marguerite's latest changes so that your tax/accounting specialists may
review Section 5(e) (which deals with deemed refunds and deemed payments).
Although we are still reviewing the Letter Agreement and the other
transaction documents, we wanted to alert you to Section 5(e) so that we
could discuss this provision with you on the 12:30 call.

Thanks,

John and Marisa

Eric,

I need to incorporate the essential parts of what Jeff Darst refers to as 
Attachment 2 below (91209_14 Jul 2000_Chiller Provisions.doc) into the Change 
Order, not as an attachment.  This Attachment contains specifications as to 
what they are providing as well as stipulations as to how we are to install 
the inlet chillers.  I need to know which are the specifications as to what 
they are providing and how the scope is being changed.  I'm not concerned 
with their recommendations of how we are to install the inlet chillers since 
that is our scope and our liability/warranty.

Please separate out the scope items that need to be included in the Change 
Order and provide me with the wording so that I may get another draft of this 
Change Order out for review.

If you want to get together to discuss, please give me a call.

Thanks

Sorry, I lost track of the versions. Here are my two questions/comments:

What are we gaining or losing by putting a drop dead date of March 2004?

On 2.11, I think relinquishing them from "damage" is broader than it needs to 
be, since the contract language is "risk of loss".  However, if the deal is 
that they are off the hook for cosmetic deterioration during storage, I think 
that can be addressed specifically in the change order.

Kay

Kay:
We are sill awaiting your approval to proceed with this revision of CO 2 
(Storage of Unit 1) for Blue Dog.  Your last comment that I did not get GE to 
agree to was the change to their responsibility for cosmetic deterioration 
during storage.  They believe that any cosmetic deteriation in storage would 
be viewed as their fault, therefore there was no real distinction of fault.  
They want to be off the hook for normal deterioration that occurs during our 
storage in their storage facility.

PS.  Storage has begun.

As I mentioned, Marguerite believes that the parties should sign the Escrow
Agreement without filling in the amount left blank in Section 1.  Let me
know what you think.

Given the fact that Section 4(a) of the Letter Agreement requires NorSub to
pay all fees associated with the Escrow Account and Section 4(b) requires
NorSub to fund the Escrow Account, Kathleen Carnahan of ENA suggested
revising Sections 1 and 6 of the Escrow Agreement, which make ENA and NorSub
jointly responsible for the payment of these monies.  Accordingly, I have
marked up the Escrow Agreement, but Chris Booth wanted me to confirm with
you whether you thought the changes were worth making.  If so, I will
forward the revised document to Chris so that he can get Citibank to signoff
on the new draft.

Also, do you have a moment to discuss the dollar amount that needs to be
included in Section 1?  Let me know, and I'll come up.

==============================================================================


Attached is a  revised draft of the LLC Agreement which has been marked to 
indicate the changes  from the draft distributed on Friday, April 13.? As we 
discussed, the most  substantive change made to the LLC Agreement reflects 
NorthWestern's desire to  have the LLC treated as a single member limited 
liability company for tax  purposes.? While Enron's tax persons have not yet 
agreed to this concept,  we have forwarded the attached draft in order to 
clarify our request and to  provide Enron's tax persons with the language we 
believe is necessary to meet  NorthWestern's objectives with respect to this 
matter.???  
?
You will note that a  significant number of provisions regarding tax matters 
have been deleted.?  Such provisions have been deleted because, to the extent 
the LLC is treated as a  single member limited liability company, such 
provisions would no longer be  relevant.
?
A revised draft of  the Letter Agreement will be circulated  shortly.

Chris and Ben:

Since Kay is tied up on a 3:00 conference call, she asked me to summarize
the issues raised by Marguerite's latest mark-ups.  The issues are as
follows:

1. In Section 6(h) regarding the Change Order, Marguerite has added a rider
pursuant to which ENA would be required "to cause the Original Purchaser
and/or the Agent to use commercially reasonable efforts to afford NorSub (or
its agent or representative), upon request of NorSub, such opportunity or
opportunities to discuss with GE (or to consult with GE concerning) such
matters pertaining to the Turbines and/or the Original Turbine Contract as
NorSub desires to discuss with GE (or to consult with GE concerning) and
which GE is obligated under the Original Turbine Contract to discuss with
(or concerning which GE is obligated under the Original Turbine Contract to
consult with) the Purchaser and/or Agent thereunder; provided, however, that
each of ENA, the Original Purchaser and the Agent shall have the right to be
present at, and to participate in, each such discussion (or consultation."
According to Jerry DeBerry, Michael Young raised this concept with Ben, and
Ben accepted it in principle.  Please confirm if you are okay with this
rider going into the Letter Agreement.

2.  In Section 8(a), Marguerite has added a clause whereby ENA agrees to be
responsible for, and to pay GE when due, and to hold the LLC and NorSub
harmless from any damages or indemnification payments which become due and
payable to GE on and after the Closing Date as a result of any event
occurring, or any circumstance arising, prior to the Closing Date.  Since
this provision effectively shifts the Change Order risk onto ENA, Kay
suggests that we only accept the provision if a reciprocal provision is
included that allows ENA to terminate the agreement as a result of any event
or circumstance that increases the Purchase Amount.  Do you agree?

3.  Finally, with respect to the LLC Agreement, NorthWestern would like to
be able to exercise its call rights with relative freedom while forcing ENA
to wait until Takeover or 12/31/02 before being able to exercise its put
rights.  Neither Jerry nor Marguerite understands why ENA cares when
NorthWestern takes ENA out.

Jerry and Marguerite were working on scheduling a conference call for
sometime tomorrow, so I will send you an e-mail confirming the details as
soon as I hear back from them.

Best regards,

Marisa

Subject: Comments to Turbine Purchase Documents



We have forwarded to you via facsimile our comments to the Letter Agreement
and the LLC Agreement. The majority of our comments, as you will note, are
intended to clarify the understanding of the parties with respect to the
various matters set forth in such documents and are not intended to "change
the deal". Except that, upon the advise of our tax counsel, we have
adjusted the amounts of the promissory notes to be issued in connection
with the transaction in order to maximize the LLC's basis in the Turbines.
We believe this is consistent with your initial draft of the Letter
Agreement.


Also, please note that we have included additional language in Section 6 of
the Letter Agreement which provides NorthWestern with the opportunity to
consult with GE on matters relating to the Turbines. This reflects our
understanding of an agreement that had been reached among the parties.


With respect to the LLC Agreement, we would like to discuss with you the
following: (i) the timing of the exercise of the Call Right and (ii) the
intent of your proposed language in Section 7 relating to the rights of
each Member to act in its own best interests with respect to the Call and
Put Rights.  To that end, we propose scheduling a conference call on
Tuesday afternoon, April 11, 2001.  Please contact me as soon as possible
with a time that is convenient for your team.


We look forward to hearing from you.


Note: We will forward to you shortly, revised drafts of the documents for
which we have drafting responsibility.

Attached is a copy of the invoice that we issued for the storage of Unit #1.
This invoice has not been paid.  I believe you are waiting for the signing
of the contract change order.  Neither of us expected this process to take
this long.

As we have an agreement that the equipment will be stored, and we agree on
the price of the storage, I am requesting that this invoice be paid
immediately.

Kay:

John and I have the following comments regarding Paul Hasting's mark-up:

1. Pursuant to the new language in Section 3.1.5 (Right to Purchase
Turbine), please confirm that, upon execution of the LLC Agreement, the LLC
shall have acquired "all of ENA's rights and interest in, to and under the
Turbine Contract."

2.  We recommend that your tax specialists sign off on the new language in
Sections 4.7 and 8.3(b) and in Article 6.

3. The revised put and call provisions (Sections 7.2(a) and (c)) allow
Northwestern to exercise its call rights with relative freedom but force ENA
to wait until Takeover or 12/31/02 before exercising the put.  This, of
course, changes the deal.

4. Paul Hasting's additions to Section 11.14 (a) limits the pool of
arbitrators to those arbitrators on file with the AAA in Montana and (b)
selects the State of Montana as the place of arbitration.  We recommend that
ENA reject these two changes and leave in the original provisions.

Call us at your convenience to discuss.

Regards,

Marisa

Subject: BlueDog Change Order #2, Rev 6

Kay:  I have edited the draft you sent me and placed GE's comments in a 
different color so you can see their comments next to yours.  Risk Management 
(Paul Parrish) is OK with the 100% coverage.  The original deal was that they 
would be off the hook for cosmetic damage incurred by GE's storage, so to put 
them back on the hook was a bit of a retrade.  Otherwise I think their 
comments (other than the approval of the assignment comment) are in order.

Is this draft acceptable to you?

		 Subject: BlueDog Change Order #2, Rev 5


Brian,

The following are our comments to the subject change order.  If you like, we
can set up a time to discuss these comments.  As I mentioned on the phone,
many of the comments directed at Part 1, Item 1 are due to the fact I do not
have a signed copy of Consent to Assignment.  I am searching for a copy at
this end, but if you have ready access, a copy would be appreciated.

Part I

1.  The base contract defines the party GE is contracting with as the
"Purchaser".  LJM2is the Purchaser under the base contract. I understand
assignment of the contract by LJM2 to E-Next is under consideration and was
supposed to have occurred in December. I do not have a copy of the Consent
signed by GE or any other signed documents indicating that the assignment
has taken place.  Assuming the assignment has taken place, according to the
unsigned documentation I have, Enron North America Corp. should be replaced
as the contracting party in paragraph 1 by E-Next Generation LLC as the
party that is contracting with GE and is the Purchaser.   As I understand
the draft Consent agreement, Enron North America is supposed to be the Agent
for E-Next and is not the Purchaser.  This is consistent with the cover page
of the draft CO No. 2.

Revision 5 to the Change Order does not quite succeed in making the
correction.  It should say "... between General Electric Company ("Seller")
and E-Next Generation LLC ("Purchaser") dated May 31, 2000 (the
"Agreement"), Purchaser, acting through its Agent, Enron North America
Corp., hereby amends ...".  However, CO No. 2 with this correction to
paragraph 1 should not be signed by GE until GE has agreed to the assignment
to E-Next.  Otherwise, the signed CO. No. 2 could, by itself, be construed
as consent by GE to the assignment.

2.1  Delete the added language that begins with the words "on or prior to
the Guaranteed Unit Shipment Date(s)...".  Because Unit No. 1 is going to
storage and the customer controls when it is released from storage and when
it gets to the jobsite, the risk of late delivery originally assigned by the
contract to GE has shifted to the customer.  This is recognized in section
5.5.2 of the contract which states that if GE is directed to ship to
storage, for the purpose of assessing LDs and final payment, GE's delivery
obligation is deemed fulfilled.  The original guaranteed delivery dates are
no longer relevant. If the Unit 1 equipment is close enough to being ready
for delivery that it must be shipped to storage because the customer cannot
take possession of it, it does not matter if we ship to storage before or
after the contract delivery dates.

2.2  The comment to 2.1 applies to this paragraph also.  Further, there is
no guaranteed delivery date for non-Major Components as long as delivery of
that equipment does not impede the continuous progress of installation.

2.4  Delete the words "unless caused by Seller or its Subcontractor" at the
end of this paragraph. Otherwise, the paragraph first takes a responsibility
away from GE and then re-imposes it.  As I understand it, there is a
significant possibility that some cosmetic deterioration to external
surfaces will occur to the equipment while it is in storage.  This is a
function of the storage conditions and GE is responsible for those
conditions.

2.6  Delete in its entirety the second sentence which reads "Passage of
title and warranty obligations of Seller with respect to the Unit 1
Equipment remain unchanged under the Agreement".  Article 5.5.2 makes it
clear that Purchaser's direction to place equipment into storage causes
title to pass and delivery for the purposes of LDs and final payment to
occur even though Purchaser has not taken physical possession of the stored
equipment.  5.5.2 also indicates that all expenses incurred by Seller as the
result of placing equipment into storage shall be payable by Purchaser.
These expenses include any extension of the Primary Warranty Period that
results from storage.  The deleted sentence should be replaced by: "The
parties agree that the Primary Warranty Period for Unit 1 Equipment placed
into storage shall be determined in accordance with Article 14.1.1 of the
Agreement except that the Primary Warranty Period shall end for the gas
turbine and generator no later than March 11, 2004 and for the balance of
the Unit 1 Equipment on March 31, 2004 unless extended by mutual agreement."

2.10  We will insure the equipment to 100% of its purchase price.  The
policy in place will have a $300,000 deductible, for which GE will be
responsible.

2.11  Seller's responsibility for both damage and loss, not just loss,
should pass to Purchaser.

The rest of the changes are acceptable.

Regards,

Jeff

Chris:

Since the 30-day window for setting up the escrow account on Project Blue
Dog is nearing its term, I wanted to check in.  As I recall, Kathleen
Carnahan had prepared the Incumbency Certificate required by Citibank.   In
addition, Carolyn Campbell indicated to me that Andrea Mahar was her contact
at Citibank on the Delta deal.  Andrea's number is 212-657-1007, and she
will likely ask regarding the nature/timing/amounts of the disbursements.
In past deals, Citibank has provided us with a fee schedule and a list of
money market investment options, so I imagine we will need to ask Andrea for
copies of the same.  According to Carolyn, Andrea might refer you to a woman
named Estelle Lawrence at 212-657-2076, but the initial contact needs to be
with Andrea.  Finally, an electronic copy of the negotiated Escrow Agreement
is attached.  We will need to have Citibank sign off on this document as
soon as possible.

Please call me if I can help out in any way.  My direct dial is
713-751-3244.

Regards,

Marisa

Folks:

With respect to the Northwestern transaction, I'd like to understand what it 
would take in the letter agreement to allow us to recognize the entire $8MM 
upon execution of the letter agreement. In my conversation today with Kay, we 
talked about making sure we could at least recognize the $8MM in equal 
instalments between the execution of the letter agreement and September 1, 
2001 (the outside date for closing). If at all possible, I'd like to take 
this one step further so that the entire amount could be recognized in Q2. 
Let's plan to talk about this on Monday. Any thoughts on this prior to Monday 
would be appreciated.

Regards,

Ben

I am attaching for your review marked and clean copies of the following
documents:

1. Letter Agreement between Enron North America Corp. and NorthWestern
Generation I, LLC;
2. ENA Promissory Note (Exhibit A);
3. First Amended and Restated LLC Agreement (Exhibit C);
4. Escrow Agreement (Exhibit F); and
5. ENA Guaranty (Exhibit G).

In addition, I am attaching a preliminary draft of Enron's form of
Assignment and Assumption Agreement (Exhibit B) with the caveat that the
document remains subject to changes pending further review by Enron.  Please
note that I am not attaching (1) a copy of the GE Guaranty (Exhibit E)
because we are satisfied with Paul Hasting's draft of this document and (2)
the LLC Promissory Note (Exhibit D) because Marguerite will circulate this
document as soon as she is done preparing it.

Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.

Chris,

I am the account manager for the Enron relationship.  I understand you would
like to establish an escrow in pretty short order.

Attached are Citibank's comments to the escrow agreement.  In order to
complete this transaction, Escrow also needs to receive the following
documents:

1) completed incumbency by all parties to the agmt;
2) Form W-9 for NorthWestern only; and
3) signed fee schedule.

Once I receive an execution copy of the agreement, I will provide you with
Citibank's wire instructions.  You have the option of including our fees
with the initial deposit or wiring our fees directly to our billing
department.  Please let me know which you prefer so that I may coordinate on
our end.

I look forward to working with you and trust that you will feel free to
contact me should you have any questions or comments.

I would like to have a chance to read it, which I haven't.  I still finishing 
up the Intergen docs.

The reason we were using a summary is that we don't know how GE is going to 
react, which might result in some changes to the contract.  In the case of 
the LM's we had already agreed with GE concerning the terms applicable to the 
equipment after assignment.

Is there any reason we would attach a summary of the master 7EA facility 
agreement rather than a redacted copy? Other than that, it looks good to me. 
Are you OK with us sending this out?

Also, it would be helpful to have all exhibits to send with the letter (i.e., 
LLC Agreement, Facility Agreement summary, escrow agreement, etc.) Please let 
me know the status of these.

Thanks,

Enclosed is a revised draft of the proposed letter agreement for the 7EA
turbines reflecting Ben's business points and the matters discussed in our
telephone conference earlier today.  Also enclosed is a blacklined copy
reflecting revisions from the December 15, 2000 draft of the prototype
letter agreement.  Although we have enclosed a blacklined draft reflecting
revisions from the final draft of the CA/ED-I letter agreement, this is
difficult to read due to our re-arrangement of the reps and warranties.  If
you have any questions or comments, please advise.  (I have received the
courier package with the GE Facility Agreements).

Here you go.  It's pretty specific to the Pastoria contract, but has been 
blessed by Mike Barnas (subject, of course, to GE getting what they want on a 
guaranty!!!  grrrr).

Hi Karen,

Could I get a copy of whatever the latest version is of the GE consent for 
Pastoria?  We have a potential deal coming up to move some frames out of 
TurboPark, so I would like to see the current state-of-the-are version.

Thanks,

Dave / Chris:

I wanted to give you both a heads up that the Northwestern (NW) GE 7EA deal 
should close today or tomorrow, and advise you of a related earnings 
recognition issue. 

The deal that we are on the path of closing is consistent with the executed 
DASH and works as follows: at the signing of the letter agreement, NW pays 
ENA $3 million, with another $5 million paid on July 15 (the Turbine 
Deposits). The balance of $40 million is paid by NW at such time as the 
assignment of the turbine contract is made to the LLC, and ENA sells the LLC 
member interests to NW. The outside date for this to occur, via a notice 
provided by NW, is Sept. 1. The $8 million paid by NW, and the obligation to 
purchase the member interests is a firm commitment guaranteed by Northwestern 
Corp. The only condition to NW's obligation to purchase the member interests 
is that ENA effect the assignment of the turbine contract into the LLC. If 
ENA does not effect the assignment, then NW would also be entitled to a 
return of the $8 million in Turbine Deposits. 

This structure is the same we followed for the Intergen deal which closed in 
January, except the Intergen deal did not have an extended period between the 
date of execution of the letter agreement, and the turbine contract 
assignment. In the Intergen deal, ENA did not receive any payments prior to 
the assignment and sale of the member interests.

The earnings issue raised by accounting (Herman Manis) is that, 
notwithstanding NW's firm commitment to purchase, ENA has two (albeit very 
minor) performance obligations. First, ENA has to obtain an Acknowledgement 
and Consent from GE prior to or concurrent with exercising its purchase 
option with E Next and assigning the turbine contract to the LLC  (we have 
had to do this for every turbine transaction). Second, ENA has to perform 
under its agreement with E Next in that if there is an event of default prior 
to the time we effect the assignment, we theoretically could loose our 
purchase option right with E Next and be unable to perform under our 
agreement with NW. We have suggested to Herman that both of these items are 
perfunctory in nature, and that all income from this transaction should be 
recognized upon execution of the letter agreement, We have further stated 
that we could obtain a letter from GE solving the first issue, but there is 
no solution to the second issue. Herman advised us that to the extent we 
receive a letter from GE on the first issue, and can convince Arthur Anderson 
that the second item is perfunctory in nature, we could recognize all income 
upon execution of the letter agreement (prior to the actual assignment of the 
turbine contract to the LLC). He did not think we had a good case relative to 
the second issue, and is reluctant to approach Arthur Anderson.

Thus, based on the above, in a worst case we may not be able to recognize any 
income form this transaction until Q3. While we think we have a shot at 
getting accounting to change their position, we do not think that this 
outcome should change our position on the deal as the underlying 
profitability is significant. The deal is also consistent with the approved 
DASH. We therefore recommend that we proceed with the execution of the letter 
agreement, and then decide as to how we should proceed on the income 
recognition issue depending on your views regarding income being recognized 
in Q2 vs. Q3.

Please advise me if you are OK with us closing on the deal as scheduled, or 
if you have any other questions.

Regards,

Ben

We are sill awaiting your approval to proceed with this revision of CO 2 
(Storage of Unit 1) for Blue Dog.  Your last comment that I did not get GE to 
agree to was the change to their responsibility for cosmetic deterioration 
during storage.  They believe that any cosmetic deteriation in storage would 
be viewed as their fault, therefore there was no real distinction of fault.  
They want to be off the hook for normal deterioration that occurs during our 
storage in their storage facility.

PS.  Storage has begun.

Chris:
 
Are we already paying GE for the change order? Is GE pushing to have this 
resolved? Pending input from Kay, I would like to hold off documenting it 
until we deal with the contract assignment and ultimate disposition of the 
unit.

Please follow up with Kay.

Thanks,

Ben

Chris,

On behalf of Matt Tezyk, please find attached below the Blue Dog Change Order 
for ENA's signature.  This had fallen through the cracks and Matt said that 
you would be handling it for me.  Thank you very much.

Once ENA has signed off on two (2) originals of the Change Order, you may 
return them to me at 3AC 712A.  I will then forward them to Jeffrey Darst for 
his signature.  Copies of the fully executed change order will be distributed 
upon return from GE.

Kay:

My only comment is in Section 5(e). The specific reference to Article 19.2 of 
the Facility Agreement should be deleted, and the paragraph should read 
"...as may be required pursuant to the Facility Agreement, ...".

I'd like to be able to send this out on Tuesday. Please let me, Fred and 
Chris know when you have reviewed this draft.

Thanks,

Ben
