TEAM CARLTON MAILBOX : ATTENTION MIKE DENZEL

We have received your acceptance and you are confirmed for ClickAtHome Pilot 
2.

You will be notified with an e-mail by November 17th on how and when you can 
access the ordering web site. Ordering is not expected to
begin until December. 

As a pilot participant, you will be testing various aspects of this new 
program such as the program offerings, program communications, product and 
service ordering, vendor services and program support.  At this time, the 
pilot program is not intended to provide access to Enron's network for 
telework purposes.   If you need Enron access for business reasons, please 
continue to maintain your existing computer and connection for this purpose.  
 In advance, we appreciate your co-operation and patience under this pilot 
program.  

Employees will have great options under this program for computers, 
peripherals, and Internet connectivity.   Your personal selections will 
determine your out-of-pocket expense, if any.  By participating the Pilot, 
you are not obligated to order hardware or connectivity, but will be given 
the opportunity to review your options and associated prices.

We know you are interested in more details.  However, one of our primary 
Pilot objectives is to test the communication on our web site.  We would like 
you to review more details about program offerings and related out-of-pocket 
costs, if any, once the pilot web site is available.  After agreeing to the 
Pilot Participants Agreement and reviewing these materials on the web site, 
you may choose to defer ordering until the All Employee roll-out in early 
2001 if you wish.

Please send any questions to the clickathomepilot2@enron.com mailbox.

Thanks.

Pilot 2 Participants!

Thanks again for participating in ClickAtHome's Pilot study.  We are very 
anxious to get started and are so excited to bring this incredible benefit to 
you!  We promised we would follow up this week, so here we are...  

Based on feedback we have received from Pilot 1, we are taking additional 
time to further integrate with our vendor websites and are expanding the 
vendor offerings to bring broadband coverage to more employees.  We 
anticipate ordering to begin in late December.  Please feel free to email us 
at clickathomepilot2@enron.com if you have any questions.  

Thanks again,
The ClickAtHome Project Team!

Nelson,
As you know, Grand Cheniere was under maintenance in October and we had to 
shut in Johson Bayou.   Francis wants us to reallocate (trespass gas) that 
they continued to flow onto ANR in the amout of  54,536mm to us  at an agreed 
upon price of $5.20.   ANR has agreed to do this next week.  Since you are 
out today Francis asked us to make sure you called him about this as well as 
another issue.  
Mark

This is a message from Cindy Olson, Executive VP, Human Resource & Community 
Relations.

Please take a few minutes to complete the attached, very brief survey. Your 
input is important in helping determine future efforts in this vital area.

You have been randomly selected to participate in the second of an ongoing 
series of surveys that will be conducted to help us gauge how effectively we 
are leveraging diversity to enhance our organization.

As you know, Enron is engaged in a struggle to recruit and retain the quality 
of talent necessary to allow us to meet and beat our competition.  The 
business case for diversity is inarguable and we must step-up to the 
challenge of recruiting, developing and continually valuing an increasingly 
diverse workforce.  Such an effort requires that we look at diversity in a 
broader context that combines the different thoughts and ideas, life and work 
experiences, as well as skill sets of employees. It is this combination that 
will enable Enron to remain the leading innovator and one of the most admired 
companies in the world.

Thanks in advance for your cooperation and contribution.

Here is the draft procedures that I sent you back in September.  It does not 
incorporate the changes that you sent
us a few days latter.  I will forward a copy of that memo also.  We are 
looking forward to getting with you to discuss the 
procedures and timing.

Subject: Procedures for Incremental Empire Gas for On-Peak Day Ahead Market

Marty suggested that I get these discussions kicked off on your side while he 
was
out-of-town today.  Basically, I started off with your proposed procedures 
and made
a few changes that Enron needs to make sure that right amount of gas shows up 
at the
correct time.

Also, we are suggesting a confirmation form be sent back and forth between 
Enron and
Sithe every day.  This will help document all the small little details and 
costs so that we
both drop anything through the cracks.  I am suggesting that we e-mail this 
confirm form
to the right folks in both our companies, so that no one is left out of the 
loop.

You will also notice our attempt to make sure that everyone has a clear 
understanding
of exactly what is included in the numbers that are reported to Enron's 
traders.  The timing
of your calls will be when everyone is very busy in our trading group.  There 
will not be much
time to have long conversations, but it is very important that everyone have 
the same
understanding what the numbers mean.

Please take a look at this on your side and see if there are some other 
things that need to
be included.

Thanks,

Ruth

the election




Looks like Maury and I will be moving back to Texas soon, based on the
following proposal....

Solution to the Election:

#1:  Al Gore becomes President of the United States (all 49
states).

#2:  George W. Bush becomes the President of The Republic of Texas.

Gore shouldn't mind as he said we were the worst state in the union
during the campaign.

So what does Texas have to survive as a Republic?:

NASA in Houston, Texas (we will control the space industry).

We refine over 85% of the gasoline in the United States (that is why
Houston has problems with the air quality).

Defense Industry (we have over 65% of it).  The term "Don't mess
with Texas," will take on new meaning.

Oil - we can supply all the oil the Republic of Texas will need for
the next 300 years.

Natural Gas-Again we have all we need (too bad about those northern
states). Al Gore will figure a way to keep Tipper and you warm....

Computer Industry-we currently lead the nation in producing computer
chips.
A small place named Texas Industries, Dell Computer, EDS, etc., etc.

Health Centers-We have the largest research centers for Cancer
research, the best burn centers, and other large health planning centers.


We have enough colleges to keep us going:  UT, Texas A&M, Rice,
University of Houston, SMU, Baylor, UNT, Texas Women's University, etc.

We have a ready supply of workers (just open the border when we need
some more) and our friends across the border will pour in by the
thousands.

We have control of the paper industry, plastics, insurance, etc.

This just names a few of the items that will keep the Republic of
Texas afloat.

Now to the rest of the United States under President Gore:

Since you won't have the refineries to get gas for your cars, only
President Gore will be able to drive around in his SUV which gets him
about 9  miles per gallon.  The rest of the United States will have to
walk or ride bikes.

You won't have any TV as the space center in Houston will cut off
your communications.

You won't have any natural gas to heat your homes but since Al's
promised global warming, I'm sure you won't get cold!

You won't need our computer chips since you won't have electricity
to power the computers.

So don't worry about us down here in Texas.  We will be OK.

David J. Robinson, D. Min.
President
Houston Graduate School of Theology

IN SPORTS TODAY:

After failing to secure a win via a recount of points, the Tennessee Titans
(6-7) are now demanding to replay the final down of their recent 42-41 loss
to the Dallas Cowboys (7-6).  Titan team officials explained that Titan
fans
intended for the final down field goal attempt to be good, and that
replaying the down is therefore justified despite the ruling of officials
that the ball did not pass thru the uprights.  Titan team officials added
that the width of the uprights confused kicker Al DelGreco (17yrs - Auburn)
on the 19 yard attempt and that the uprights should be widened for a replay
of the down.  Cowboys team officials countered that DelGreco had seen the
uprights before the game and had not complained to the officials.  They
added that Cowboy kicker Tim Seder (R - Arkansas) successfully kicked thru
the same uprights during the game from distances of 47, 42 and 36 yards.

Kevin,
 As we discussed, here are the changes I feel need to be made to the form 
before Enron North America Corp.  can agree to use it.

1.  Change 1.1 to read as follows:  This Agreement shall be effective upon 
its execution and shall continue in full force and effect through December 
31, 2000.

2.  Change 3.1 to read as follows:  Upon not less than 36 hours advance 
notification by Vector, Seller shall be obligated to sell and deliver to 
Vector, and Vector shall be obligated to purchase and receive from Seller, at 
the time stipulated by Vector in the advance written notification, at a Point 
of Sale, a quantity of gas equal to Seller's PSQ for such Point of Sale, as 
specified in Exhibit A to this Agreement.  The parties agree that time is of 
the essence in this Agreement..

3.  Add 4.2 to read as follows:  4.2  If Vector fails to purchase and receive 
from Seller the quantity of gas required to be purchased and received by it 
under Article 3.1 for any reason other than the occurrence of an event of 
Force Majeure, Vector shall indemnify Seller and shall be liable to pay 
Seller an amount equal to the difference between the price that would have 
been paid to Seller and the Gas Daily low price, set forth in Gas Daily under 
the heading "Daily Price Survey" under the listing applicable to Chicago and 
using the low price in the range of prices published for the day that Vector 
failed to perform multiplied by the volume Vector failed to purchase and 
receive from Seller for such day.

4.  Add the following language at the end of 9.1.  For breach of any 
provision for which an express remedy or measure of damages is herein 
provided, such express remedy or measure of damages shall be the sole and 
exclusive remedy hereunder.  If no remedy or measure of damages is expressly 
herein provided, the obligor's liability shall be limited to direct actual 
damages only, such direct actual damages shall be the sole and exclusive 
remedy hereunder and all other remedies or damages at law or in equity are 
waived.  Unless expressly herein provided, neither party shall be liable for 
consequential, incidental, punitive, exemplary or indirect damages, lost 
profits or other business interruption damages, in tort, contract, under any 
indemnity provision or otherwise.

5.  Add the following Seller's information in 10.1.
 Enron North America Corp.

Subject: I'll keep taking punches until their will grows  tired.

In 1974 the S&P 500 dropped 27% AFTER the first  rate cut by the fed.? In 
1981 it dropped 15% AFTER the first rate cut by  the fed.? With a S&P 500 
still trading at twice it's growth rate, 20 vs  10, a NASDAQ still trading at 
70 times earings, and a bullish advisor sentiment  still at 55%, the backdrop 
for a sharp rally isn't very good.? In a slowing  earnings enviroment I 
believe investors should focus on two sectors.? The  first are companies like 
Tootsie Roll Industries that manage to grow earnings  like clockwork.? 
Secondly, telecom/tech companies that are trading at their  growth rate and 
there is some assurrance that their customers are in a position  to keep 
ordering and paying for products.? For Tootsie Roll Industries it  is easy 
since the end user is the consumer and this products' consumption is  fairly 
recession proof.?? Efficient Networks' customers are SBC  Communications and 
others who then install their products to offer their  customer price savings 
that justify their capital investment. As long as SBC's  is financially 
strong and their ROI warrants the investment, the Efficient's of  the world 
appear to be interesting ideas.?  


? There will be layoffs not just in the DOT com world, probably everybody  at 
AMAZON, but also certain industries like the Financials and Auto's.?  This 
should remove once and for all any last Greenspan' fears of a wage led  
inflationary revival.? His comments yesterday were an admittance that this  
economy is softer than 14 feet of fresh powder in Montana.? Housing prices  
and financial assets were simply too inflated in general.? That doesn't  mean 
there aren't some good real estate markets and it doesn't mean there aren't  
any fair priced companies.

 As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More 
comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

Mark Frevert and Mark Haedicke

"Our Finest Hour"
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1883013984/

horrors of that distant war, and also documents the efforts on the
home front. This selection of photographs and extended captions
from the pages of "Life" and other contemporary publications
gathers images that have become part of American iconography.

Andy Rooney's "My War"
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1586480103/

recounts his experiences as a correspondent for "Stars and Stripes,"

As you are aware, Enron utilizes temporary staffing services to satisfy=20
staffing requirements throughout the company.  For the past several months,=
 a=20
project team, representing Enron=01,s temporary staffing users, have resear=
ched=20
and evaluated alternative Managed Services programs to determine which sour=
ce=20
would best meet our current and future needs in terms of quality, performan=
ce=20
and cost containment objectives.  The Business Unit Implementation Project=
=20
Team members are:=20

Beverly Stephens, Administration, ENA
Norma Hasenjager, Human Resources, ET&S

Jane Ellen Weaver, Enron Broadband Services
Paulette Obrecht, Legal, Corporate
George Weber, GSS

In addition, Eric Merten (EBS), Kathy Cook (EE&CC), Carolyn Gilley (ENA),=
=20
Larry Dallman (Corp/AP), and Diane Eckels (GSS) were active members of the=
=20
Selection Project Team.

As a result of the team=01,s efforts, we are pleased to announce the beginn=
ing=20
of a strategic alliance with CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services Group.  This g=
roup=20
will function as a vendor-neutral management entity overseeing all staffing=
=20
vendors in the program scope. They will also provide a web based online=20
technology tool that will enhance the ordering and reporting capabilities. =
=20
The goal of our alliance with CORESTAFF is to make obtaining a temporary=20
worker with the right skills and experience easier while protecting the bes=
t=20
interests of the organization.=20

We plan to implement Phase I of this improvement effective January 2, 2001.=
 =20
This Phase I of the implementation will encompass administrative/clerical=
=20
temporary workers at the Houston locations only. If you currently have=20
administrative/clerical temporary workers in your department, the enhanceme=
nt=20
will not affect their position. In an effort to preserve relationships, all=
=20
current staffing vendors will be invited to participate in this enhanced=20
program.  CORESTAFF shares our commitment to minimize any disruptions in=20
service during this transition.=20
=20
We expect to incorporate the administrative/clerical workers in Omaha,=20
Seattle and Portland in Phase II, which is scheduled for February, 2001.  T=
he=20
scope and timing of any additional phases will be determined after these tw=
o=20
phases have been completed.

Realizing the impact that the temporary workforce has in business today, we=
=20
selected CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services Group based on their exceptional=
=20
management team, commitment to quality service, and creative solutions to o=
ur=20
staffing needs.  The relationship promises to offer Enron a cost effective=
=20
and simple means for obtaining temporary employees.

In the coming weeks, Enron and CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services Group will b=
e=20
communicating to Enron=01,s administrative/clerical temporary staffing vend=
ors=20
about the new process. =20

There are many benefits to this new Managed Services program, which are=20
outlined on the attached page.  More details on how to utilize CORESTAFF=01=
,s=20
Managed Services program will be announced soon and meetings will be=20
scheduled to demonstrate the reporting system and to meet the Managed=20
Services team.

What is Managed Services?

CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services program includes:

? Vendor-neutral management model
? Equal distribution of staffing orders to all staffing partners
? Web-based application with online ordering, data capture and customized=

? Benchmarking and performance measurement for continuous improvement
? Methodologies for accurate skill-matching and fulfillment efficiencies=20
