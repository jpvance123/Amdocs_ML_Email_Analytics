TAKING A HARD LINE
PG&E Insists ratepayers pick up $3 billion tab for deregulated electricity

San Francisco's Pacific Gas and Electric Co. plans to come out with guns 
blazing today when it makes its case to state regulators for why ratepayers 
should be saddled with about $3 billion in unforeseen power costs. 
But while the utility insists it is guided first and foremost by a sense of 
what is right and fair, the reality is that PG&E is maneuvering with its back 
to the wall. 
Wall Street, that is. 
``No one wants to hold stock in a company that is subsidizing its 
customers,'' said Paul Patterson, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in 
New York. ``If PG&E has to swallow this $3 billion, investors will run in 
droves.'' 
``The whole idea of Wall Street is to enhance shareholder value,'' agreed 
Carol Coale, an analyst at Prudential Securities in Houston. ``PG&E's 
management has to be seen to be doing that.'' 
In documents filed with the California Public Utilities Commission late 
Wednesday, the utility said it will not be left ``holding the bag'' for 
outstanding electricity costs accrued when wholesale power prices spiked 
sharply higher during the summer. 
Because of a current rate freeze, the utility has been unable to pass along 
those additional costs in monthly power bills. Customers of San Diego Gas & 
Electric saw their bills triple this summer after SDG&E became the first 
California utility to qualify for an early end to the rate freeze. 
A senior PG&E official, requesting anonymity, told The Chronicle yesterday 
that there is virtually no room for compromise on whether the company will 
swallow even a portion of that $3 billion in unexpected costs. 
He said PG&E intends to recoup its expenses either from customers or -- and 
this is a longshot -- in the form of refunds from power companies. 
``There is a strong feeling here that we have every right to collect every 
dime, either from generators or customers,'' the official said. ``We have a 
pretty strong leg to stand on, under federal law, to get all of the money 
we've had to pay out.'' 
Analysts were mixed on whether federal law does indeed favor PG&E and fellow 
utility Southern California Edison on this question. Some agreed with the 
companies that electricity distributors cannot be held accountable for 
surging wholesale power prices and that ratepayers must pay for the power 
they use. 
But others pointed out that electricity customers were told when California's 
energy market was deregulated in 1996 that they would be protected by a rate 
freeze until early 2002 and that this rate freeze precludes utilities from 
passing along any extra charges until that time. 
Legal matters aside, no one doubts that the stakes are high for investors 
and that this is very much on the minds of PG&E executives as they go into 
today's PUC hearing. 
``If you're an owner of the stock, you want management to take a position 
that minimizes loss,'' said Paul Fremont, an analyst at Jefferies & Co. in 
New York. 
PG&E's share price dipped 44 cents yesterday to $27.13, still well above its 
52-week low of $19.69. 
``PG&E has to stick to its guns to maintain financial stability,'' said 
Patterson at Credit Suisse First Boston. 
Prudential's Coale stressed that shareholders would not take kindly to any 
solution that involves a big hit on PG&E's bottom line. 
``What shareholders do not want to see is a huge write-down,'' she said. 
``You would hope for the solvency of the company that PG&E's management would 
care most about shareholders, not ratepayers, at this point.'' 
That seems to be the case. The senior PG&E official said the only thing the 
utility is prepared to negotiate is the length of time ratepayers should be 
given to pay off the $3 billion. 
He said four years of surcharges atop customers' regular monthly bills is one 
possibility but quickly added that PG&E could be flexible on how long the 
surcharges are imposed. 
``That's where we see room for compromise,'' the official said. 
Until recently, the PUC had been unwilling to even discuss whether utility 
customers, and not the utilities, should be paying the unforeseen power 
costs. 
That changed when the commissioners recently agreed to accept a request from 
PG&E and Southern California Edison that they revisit the matter. Today's 
public hearing is the first step in that process. 
For its part, Edison wants to pass along to customers about $2.3 billion in 
costs over a five-year span. PUC President Loretta Lynch said commissioners 
are trying to keep an open mind about how best to resolve the dispute, which 
threatens to explode from a regulatory issue into a political hot potato. 
``A lot of folks are pitching a lot of ideas,'' she said. ``No decisions have 
been made.'' 
In fact, a major wild card is what the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
will do, if anything, to stabilize California's electricity market. The 
commission is scheduled to issue a draft report Wednesday outlining its 
intentions. 
Federal commissioners refused yesterday to discuss the contents of their 
draft report, saying only that they have been working hard to determine 
whether California's power prices are ``just and reasonable,'' and, if not, 
what to do about it. 
``The California situation has been incredibly difficult and thought 
provoking and time consuming,'' said Commissioner Linda Key Breathitt. 
While federal regulators have authority to demand that power generators 
refund consumers if found to have illegally manipulated prices, few observers 
expect such a harsh step to be taken. 
Rather, the commissioners are widely expected to impose new restrictions on 
wholesale electricity prices for a limited period of time. California 
wholesale prices are now capped at $250 per megawatt. 
Ironically, surging wholesale prices could also benefit PG&E customers. The 
utility reaps profit from selling power it generates into the wholesale 
market and has proposed that revenue from its network of dams and the Diablo 
Canyon nuclear power plant be shared in the future with ratepayers. 
If such a scheme were to get the green light from the PUC, the senior PG&E 
official said this could shave about one-fourth off the $3 billion and 
``lessen the pain a little bit'' for ratepayers. 
Ultimately, however, the utility will have to convince not just the PUC but 
also its customers that passing along billions of dollars in extra charges is 
the most appropriate solution. 
``It's going to be a difficult sell, public relationswise,'' said Herbert 
Hart, an analyst at Redwood Securities Group in San Francisco. ``PG&E just 
got done reporting an excellent quarter.'' 
The utility's parent company, PG&E Corp., reported this week that its 
quarterly operating income jumped 34 percent to $248 million (68 cents per 
share) from $185 million (50 cents) a year ago. 
Whatever else, Hart said, ``it's important to maintain good relations with 
your customers.''

FYI.  It appears that the California Governor is working pretty hard to stop 
this market.  We are looking into the politics behind this letter, especially 
who in the administration drove this dramatic response.

Just received by fax a press release and letters sent by Davis to Jim 
Hoecker, the Chair and the CEO of the ISO, the Chair and the CEO of the PX, 
the Pres. of the PUC, the Chair of the Energy Oversight Board.  The language 
is highly charged and negative.  Tim/Bob:  Note call for caps on PX 
equivalent to caps in ISO real time market.  In sum:

Letter to Chair and CEO of the ISO
Apply to FERC for extension of rate cap authority
Apply to FERC for finding that market is not competitive.
Reduce wholesale price cap to lowest reasonable level.

Letter to Chair and CEO of PX
Apply to FERC for bid caps in day-ahead and day-of spot markets equal to ISO 
caps in real time markets.

Letter to Pres of PUC
Wholesale electricity market lacks competition.
Support filings that he's asked the ISO and the PX to make at FERC.
File a petition with FERC requesting a finding that "no competitive market 
currently exists in California, and requesting an extenstion of the price cap 
authority..."
Refund immediately to SDG&E consumers the $100 million dollars SDG&E "found" 
in an account

Letter to Chair of Energy Oversight Board
Urge ISO to petition FERC for extension of price cap authority
Urge ISO to lower caps to lowest reasonable level
Urge ISO to file petition with FERC for finding that "no competitive market 
for energy exists in California"

Letter to Hoecker (cc'd are Clinton, Boxer, Feinstein, Farr, Lewis, Burton, 
Brulte, Hertzberg and Baugh)
"...there is virtually no price elasticity in this market, and little 
prospect of change in the short run."
If FERC's investigation finds abuse, FERC should order refunds to consumers.

Steve:

Your angle is much better for the corporation, and a lot of the below might 
be "mastering the obvious," but here it is.

- Rob

-----------------------------------------------------
 The petroleum, natural gas, and electricity price situations have a 
different set of facts but a common demoninator--very tight infrastructure 
relative to energy demand.  Here is a general set of conclusions with a few 
"sound bites."


* The current energy price situation is "all about economics."  It is 
economics 101--supply and demand.  Demand has been rising faster than supply 
with a predictable response.  This is the bad news for consumers.  The good 
news is that there is reason to believe that prices for oil and natural gas 
are at the top of their commodity price cycle.  The NYMEX futures market 
shows a "backwardation curve" for both--look in the daily Wall Street Journal 
in Section C under "Futures Prices"  that usually is around page 14.  Look at 
the settle price for the different energy commodities and the prices after 
the prompt month (October) fall over the next months and years except for 
this winter's natural gas price.

* Big oil did not suddenly get big or greedy with petroleum prices any more 
than "big gas" has with natural gas.  Many of the same players were 
profit-maximizing during the previous price slump.

* The constraint on energy markets is not the resource base but the 
infrastructure to produce, refine, and transport supplies.  Infrastructure 
constraints have had a cumulative effect of slowing the great engine of 
market supply,    reflected siting issues and also low profitability (partly 
the result of rapid implementation of new environmental requirements).

* The solution is to stop taking supply for granted and build more 
flexibility and incentives in the system to profitably meet ever-rising 
demand.  Energy investment must compete against many New Economy investment 
opportunities that have potentially high rates of return.

Oil

This is a global market so declining U.S. production is a very small part of 
the world supply, but the real constraint is domestic refining capacity.  
Since 1990, operable U.S. refineries have declined from 205 to 159 when 50 
refineries closed and only 4 new refineries entered the market.  [National 
Petroleum Council, "U.S. Petroleum Refining," June 2000, p. 23.  Other 
refineries have been able to expand to increase overall capacity, but 
capacity utilization has risen rapidly in recent years and is above 95%--a 
tight situation.  EPA permits to allow further expansion is a major issue to 
making sure that domestic infrastructure keeps up with demand (p. 27).  A 
number of proposed requirements to further improve the environmental quality 
of gasoline has raised profitability questions as well (pp. 27-30). 

The two actions the U.S. can take in the short run to increase crude supplies 
are to lift the embargo on Iraq and withdraw oil from the Strategic Petroleum 
Reserve (up to 3 mmbd).  Liquidating the reserve could be part of a 
privatization program to get support from the free market community, and the 
proceeds could be used to help low income energy users this winter.  The days 
don't get much more "rainy" than now given that without price controls price 
and not supply is in question in an "emergency."

A longer run approach must be to encourage domestic and international 
drilling to make the supply response as elastic as possible to higher 
prices.  Alaska activity such as drilling at the Arctic National Wildlife 
Reserve (ANWR) would be a major contribution to world supplies.

On the gasoline side, much has been written about "boutique fuels" where 
certain environmental requirements are required for certain regions that 
makes the supply/demand balance very sensitive to interruptions (such as 
refinery downtime or a pipeline closure).  The key to prevent price spikes 
for consumers is to not let new environmental requirements outrace technology 
or infrastructure constraints.  This discontinuity happened earlier this 
summer in Chicago, for example, where gasoline prices rose well above $2 per 
gallon.

Electricity

This is an infrastructure problem that could be alleviated by a more 
efficient use of the transmission grid to get power to its highest valued 
uses.  California in particular has followed a "soft" energy path where 
conservation was substituted for permitting urgency for new power plants.  
The digital age is driving demand growth although many traditional appliances 
(such as refrigerators) are using less power.  General economic growth also 
means many new appliances, traditional and new, are being produced and used, 
adding to power demand.

Natural Gas

 Natural gas supplies (and infrastructure to some degree) must catch up to 
high demand after many years of slumping gas prices and reduced incentive.  
Over 200 Tcf of potential gas reserves is in areas that are off limits to 
drilling--something that should be corrected given the advances in drilling 
technology that make exploration and production much less invasive to surface 
area than ever before.  Other public policy drivers should be a continued 
emphasis on expedited certification for new pipelines and avoiding new short 
run regulatory "fixes."  Past this winter, however, gas prices are expected 
to decline, so consumers can lock in long term prices that are below current 
prices.


Conclusion

Energy supply and infrastructure have been taken for granted for too long.  
It was assumed that low prices would continue despite increasing 
disincentives to increase supply and infrastructure to meet demand.  Demand 
has also increased faster than thought due to economic prosperity and the 
"wealth effect."  Market forces can correct the imbalance over time without 
regulatory quick fixes and with reasonable incentives for industry 
performance.

Energy: Critics say tactics allowed in the deregulated market, which let

federal investigation is underway.

   With Southern Californians reeling from skyrocketing electric bills,
critics charge that fewer than a dozen power suppliers are reaping far
greater profits than are justified by the recent surge in wholesale prices
of the natural gas they use to create electricity.



  Their behavior is a major focus of a formal investigation announced
last week by federal regulators. Among those under scrutiny are power
merchants including <B>Duke</B> <B>Energy</B>, <B>Dynegy</B>,
<B>Reliant</B> <B>Energy</B>, Calpine,
Southern Co. and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. Critics
say the companies are earning huge windfalls selling energy to the two
state agencies charged with distributing power in California.

   The power merchants themselves deny any profiteering, describing their
market moves as legal business practices and welcoming the investigation.
   The underlying cause of California's energy turmoil is a severe
shortage of power-generating capacity to meet the soaring energy demands
of the state's booming economy. This summer the state at times has had to
import more than 20% of its energy needs, a shortfall equal to the output
of about 20 medium-size power plants. No plants of any size have been
built in the state in 10 years.
   But the problem goes beyond a supply-and-demand imbalance. The
so-called merchant power companies' ability to bend the market to their
advantage--using what appear to be legal strategies--illustrates what
many say are serious flaws in the state's deregulated energy market.
   One major flaw is that sellers do not have to participate in the
state's main electricity auction--the so-called "day forward" sale held
one day before electricity is delivered to the state's residences and
businesses. Instead, generators are withholding power until the day of
delivery, when desperate state agencies are willing to pay steep prices
to keep the power flowing.
   The upshot has been a doubling of electric bills for the 1.2 million
customers in San Diego Gas&Electric's coverage area, and Southern
California Edison and Pacific Gas&Electric customers may be facing
higher prices once their rates are unfrozen in 2002.
   There is little prospect for short-term relief; with no additional
power generation due for a year, the prices of natural gas and crude oil
are still rising. In fact, state officials expect the market to become
tighter over the next year as demand and fuel prices rise.
   In pointing the finger at the power merchants, Gov. Gray Davis, some
academics and utility executives charge that California consumers are
being victimized by sophisticated trading techniques that take advantage
of the market system to extract huge profits.
   Deregulation "only works if people act responsibly. It won't work if
people say their only goal is to make as much money as humanly possible,"
Davis said last week.
   This brokering takes place on the California Power Exchange and the
Independent System Operator, two agencies created by the 1996 legislation
that ostensibly opened up 70% of the state's power market--represented by
the PG&E, SCE and SDG&E service areas--to competition. To create that
competition, lawmakers ordered the utilities to sell power plants to
independent companies, which now are selling electricity to the state.
   The Power Exchange is a clearinghouse for the bulk of energy trading
that is completed a day in advance of delivery, which normally fills most
of the state's energy needs. The ISO, the nominal traffic cop arranging
deliveries over the power grid, also has the authority to hold same-day
power auctions for immediate delivery in the event of unexpectedly high
demand.
   The Power Exchange is subject to a price cap of $250 per
megawatt-hour, a ceiling imposed earlier this summer as prices began to
soar. But the ISO has the authority to pay as much as it has to for
supplementary power if the previous-day purchases prove insufficient to
keep the state's lights on.
   And it is the secondary ISO market where power suppliers, leveraging a
seller's market, are holding sway. By withholding their energy from the
Power Exchange and opting instead to bid their supply to the ISO, they
are betting that same-day shortages will generate prices as close to the
price cap as possible, possibly even above it.
   It's apparently working.
   On some days, the ISO has ended up buying one-fifth of the state's
energy needs, not the 5% to 10% maximum originally envisioned. In the
process, desperate to meet demand, the ISO is paying premium prices and
those prices are being passed along to consumers.
   The problem with the market apparently defies easy solutions. At an
emergency meeting Friday to discuss ways of dealing with the crisis, the
ISO board rejected a staff proposal to force energy merchants to allocate
at least 90% of the electricity they intend to sell in the "day forward"
auction held by the Power Exchange, instead of holding back until the day
of delivery.
   Although ISO Chief Executive Terry Winter said the measure would
restore some market order, the board rejected it on fears that it might
create unforeseen ramifications, possibly even power suppliers abandoning
the state altogether.
   As the market stands now, independent power companies have been able
to exploit the power shortages and the market's quirks to charge the
state higher rates than the increases in the price of natural gas would
seem to warrant, said Severin Borenstein, a UC Berkeley professor and
energy specialist.
   With fellow UC Berkeley professor James Bushnell and Stanford's Frank
Wolak, Borenstein studied the Power Exchange over a 15-month period ended
in September and found evidence of "market power," or the power
generators' ability to raise prices above competitive levels for
sustained periods.
   Unless there is collusion among two or more power providers, the
exercise of market power is not illegal, experts say. But if prolonged,
it is a symptom of a seriously dysfunctional market.
   "I think [market power] has probably gotten worse this year. There are
players big enough to move the price and move it a lot. Prices are
clearly way above their costs," Borenstein said.
   Edison CEO John Bryson and Stephen Baum, head of SDG&E parent Sempra
Energy, have similar criticisms. Their claims will be investigated by the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the latest of five probes underway
into California's worsening energy predicament. "We'll see whether there
are alternative market rules that should be adopted to have a better
functioning, more efficient market," said Daniel Larcamp, FERC's director
of market tariffs and rates. "Looking at market power issues is an
important focus of our investigation."
   Power suppliers Duke Energy and Calpine denied any market
manipulation, saying the bulk of their energy is sold on long-term
contracts and is not used to unduly sway day-ahead prices on the Power
Exchange or same-day sales on the ISO.
   "No way are we manipulating the market, and we have welcomed
investigation into our business practices," said Tom Williams, spokesman
for Duke Energy's California regional office in Morro Bay. "It's easy to
point fingers at someone who controls only 4% of the market, much of
which has already been sold in the forward market months ago."
   Calpine spokesman Bill Highlander said the high prices are simply a
case of demand far outstripping the state's ability to meet it. "Ten
years ago, you had more supply than demand. Now you have a skyrocketing
demand from population growth, a robust economy and Internet-fed
additions to demand," Highlander said.
   Charles Cicchetti, a USC professor of government, business and the
economy, agrees and said the market is performing exactly as expected,
given supply shortages. He objects to the limited price ceilings opposed
by state officials.
   "The choice should be to either regulate the whole thing, go back to
where we were or let the market work," Cicchetti said. "This hybrid is
causing problems to get worse."
   But something appears to be worsening an already bad pricing
situation, and critics believe it is market manipulation. In the FERC
order initiating its investigation, the agency noted that California's
wholesale electricity costs on June 29 were $340 million--a sevenfold
increase over the same date in 1999. Over the same period, natural gas
prices only doubled.
   FERC will look at other aspects of the state's energy deregulation as
well--at the fact that utilities have no choice but to purchase power
from the central power exchange and have only limited power to hedge or
make bilateral deals on their own with outside firms.
   In an interview last week, the FERC's Larcamp said his agency is
reserving the right to roll back rates, order refunds or even impose a
new market framework to replace the Power Exchange and ISO.
   Larcamp said the FERC's probe will contrast California's troubled
power market with the Pennsylvania-Maryland-New Jersey system, which
gives end users more freedom to cut their own deals with suppliers. The
result is that Pennsylvania has more than 130 power suppliers competing
for the state's business, versus no more than 15 in California.

Subject: Rate cap , Ratepayer relief and siting bills 

Summary of Davis/Alpert bill AB 260

Retro-active to June 1, 2000 through December 31, 2002, 6.5 cent/kWh cap on 
the energy component for residential and small commercial customers (under 
100 kW).  The Commission has the ability to extend through 2003.  The 
Commission also has the ability to adjust the cap.

Commission can use revenues from utility-owned assets, refunds from FERC to 
offset the undercollections.  (In addition, a companion bill was passed that 
provides $150 million of general fund money to offset undercollections.)

Large commercial/industrial/agricultural customers have an opportunity to 
"opt-in" to the 6.5 cent/kWh cap with an annual true-up.

SDG&E will under a prudence review by the CPUC, which may be another source 
of funds to offset the undercollection.

Specific classes subject to cap:

  Schedule A, all acute care hospitals, all public and private k-12 schools, 
all accounts on AL-TOU under 100 kW.

Summary of the rate payer relief bill AB 1156 which would 
Transfer of $150,000,000 from the general fund  to a subaccount within the 
Special Fund for Economic Uncertainties.  
Appropriate those funds from the subaccount, to the commission, to reduce the 
adverse impact of high-cost wholesale energy purchases on certain ratepayers 
if a specified rate ceiling is in effect, and if the commission determines 
that a specified revenue shortfall would result in a ratepayer surcharge 
greater than 10%, and the electricity rates were directly linked to Power 
Exchange costs.  
Declare that, on January 1, 2004, any remaining balance in the account would 
revert to the General Fund.
Become operative only if AB 265 is enacted, as specified.
 Take effect immediately as an urgency statute.

A Return to Regulation? California Problems Spark National Trend
By: Will McNamara

=3D=3D=3D

With state power reserves falling below 7 percent for the second straight
day, and the demand for electricity continuing to increase, the California
Independent System Operator (CA-ISO), issued a Stage Two electrical emergen=
cy
on Tuesday. A Stage Two Emergency is a serious occurrence as it signals
that electric operating reserves in the state have fallen below 5 percent.
The Cal-ISO has issued over 10 Stage Two emergencies this summer, leaving
little doubt that the power supply problem in California has reached=20
disastrous
proportions. Other states (and foreign countries such as Japan) that have
deregulated their energy markets=01*or are about to do so=01*have kept a cl=
ose
eye on the problems in California. These problems have sparked a national
debate over whether returning to or maintaining a regulated energy market
is a better option.

ANALYSIS: I've been tracking the chronic problems facing California in
RCI's IssueAlerts for several months, so for further background please
visit our archives at the link offered below. Yet, generally speaking,
it's fairly obvious that the promises of deregulation in California have
not materialized. Limited transmission lines, the fact that no new power
plants have been built in almost two decades, and a 3-percent increase
in demand have driven costs up in California instead of down. On Tuesday,
approximately 43,218 MW of power was consumed, topping Monday's peak of
43,087 MW. Exacerbating the already tight supplies is the fact that some
2,220 MW of generation, mostly in Southern California, are unavailable
due to power plant mechanical failures.

However, perhaps even more pertinent is a movement that I am seeing develop
both within California and other states that arguably is a direct result
of the problems we've seen on the West Coast. This movement is founded
on a platform that suggests deregulated energy markets should become regula=
ted
once again, and those states that haven't adopted a restructuring plan
should take a "timeout" and reconsider if competition truly offers more
benefits than headaches.

Not surprisingly, California lawmakers and consumer advocates=01*blaming=20
deregulation
for the high rates that customers of San Diego Gas & Electric are now payin=
g=01*
suggested
that the California market should become "re-regulated." Proposals included
imposing more governmental control over energy prices (which led to the
recent lowering of the price cap in the state to $250/MW) to having utility
companies buy back all the power plants they were forced to sell only two
years ago.

But the discussion of re-regulation has not been limited to California.
The New York City Council, for instance, has posted a bill that would give
the City authority to regulate the output of lead into the atmosphere.
As lead is a small part of the pollution generated by power plants, if
this bill passes the City would have a handle on power generation that
it does not now have.

Even more striking is the coalition of 23 low-cost energy states that have
petitioned Congress to exempt them from participating in deregulation.
The Low-Cost Electricity States Initiative (LCESI) actually has been in
existence for over a year, but is gaining momentum again now that it can
use California as an example of all that is wrong with deregulation. Some
of these states only want to open their wholesale markets to competition,
but not their retail markets. Others want to avoid deregulation altogether.
As a lobbying group, the LCESI has tried to convince Congress that any
federal restructuring law should be secondary to state plans, and that
any mandate regarding state participation in deregulation will be appealed.


Other low-cost states have started to drag their heels regarding deregulati=
on,
even if they have not officially joined LCESI. Iowa, for instance, recently
decided that it won't even pursue the issue of deregulation during the
2001 session of its legislature, upon the urging of the state's largest
utility, MidAmerican Energy. New Mexico, which had previously approved
a start date of Jan 1., 2001, for electric competition, now has delayed
that start date until Jan. 1., 2002, to further investigate the impact
that competition will have on the state.

On the other hand, two states that are moving forward with their Jan. 1
start dates=01*Illinois and Ohio=01*continue to watch California closely bu=
t
think such problems will be averted in their own states. Ohio points to
the fact that its rate freeze won't be lifted for five years, which will
protect residents from the kind of price spikes now hurting customers in
San Diego. Illinois customers also will benefit from a longer rate freeze
and the fact that regulators in the state=01*having watched problems regard=
ing
supply materialize in California=01*allowed for incumbent utilities to dive=
st
of their power plants, but did not mandate it. Thus, importing power from
the wholesale market won't be as necessary in Illinois as it is in Californ=
ia.

However, between the 23 members of LCESI and the approximately 24 states
that have adopted some form of a restructuring plan, the United States
is almost evenly divided with regard to states that would or would not
be participating in deregulation. But, realistically, would states even
be allowed to "opt-out" from electric competition? Perhaps this might work
on the wholesale market, but ultimately I cannot see half of the U.S. state=
s
retreating from retail competition if the other half is participating.
When educated properly about the true benefits of competition, electric
customers=01*especially industrial and commercial customers=01*will push fo=
r
competition within their states or go to states where they can choose their
energy provider. In addition, because of the way the nation's transmission
grid is structured, it would be near impossible to transport power any
great distance if states along the way refuse to grant access to their
transmission lines.

Moreover, perhaps it is not entirely wise to use California as a test examp=
le
for how deregulation will work nationally, as the LCESI is now attempting
to do. First, California clearly made some mistakes in its own restructurin=
g
plan, not the least of which was the combination of mandating divestiture
and not allowing new plants to be built, ultimately leaving the state with
power supply problems. But other states are learning from these mistakes
and developing better restructuring plans. Second, states such as Pennsylva=
nia
have adopted longer periods for rate freezes and stranded cost recovery,
thus protecting customers from price spikes for a longer period. Third,
deregulation in California has only been in effect for two and half years.
To write it off as a "failure" without allowing this huge system to work
out its own kinks is a mistake.

Duke Energy Offers Governor Davis Solutions to California's Power Supply 
Shortfall 

     Committing to Deliver 3,000 Megawatts of New Supply to California
               And a Five-Year Fixed Price Supply Contract

    HOUSTON AND MOSS LANDING, Calif., July 31 /PRNewswire/ -- Duke Energy
North America (DENA) today offered to California Governor Gray Davis specific
solutions to address the state's electricity supply shortage proposing to
deliver 3,000 megawatts of new supply through the construction of generation
facilities.  In addition, DENA proposed a five-year, fixed-price supply
contract to incumbent utilities to address the immediate concern with volatile
electricity prices.
    "California's high electricity prices during peak-demand periods result
from insufficient supply to meet the demand," said Jim Donnell, president and
chief executive officer of DENA.  "In the past ten years, no significant new
power generation facilities have been built in California.  During the same
period, peak demand has risen more than 10,000 megawatts.  This combination
has caused the state's reserve margin to fall to less than 2 percent, which
necessarily results in higher prices and abnormal volatility."
    Under current procedures, it takes in excess of four years to deliver new
power generation in California.  To add substantial incremental generating
capacity to California, DENA proposed Governor Davis use his existing
authority under the California Emergency Services Act to streamline the
permitting process to facilitate the rapid construction of environmentally
friendly generation by 2001.  DENA also asked the governor to use his current
authority to allow California utilities to enter into bilateral contracts with
energy providers, so they could better manage their exposure to high energy
prices.
    To help solve the state's supply shortfall, DENA said it remained
committed to adding substantial generation in California.  Within two months
and upon receiving final regulatory approvals, the company will begin
construction on 1,000 megawatts at its Moss Landing facility.  The expansion
of the current 1,478-megawatt facility will be in commercial operation by
summer 2002.  And, with an expedited permitting process, DENA could deploy its
available resources to construct an additional 500 megawatts for commercial
operation in 2001 and 1,500 megawatts for 2002.
    To address the concern associated with the high energy prices experienced
this year, DENA offered to provide up to 2,000 megawatts of electricity to the
incumbent utilities at $50 per megawatt-hour for a five-year period beginning
Sept. 1, 2000.  This would mitigate the exposure to price spikes, for a
reasonable time period during which additional generation resources can be
built.
    "DENA is committed to help bring electricity price stability for the
citizens of California through these proposals," Donnell said.  "We are
confident that our expertise in building and operating power generation
facilities can help resolve the supply crisis."

Bruno --

I completely disagree with this pleading.   Direct access customers should 
not be afforded the same regulatory "bad policy" as bundled customers as 
relates to their energy component.  If the regulatory fix was to reduce 
distribution rates for the period, then I would seek that fix.

We, as Enron, have been loudly proclaiming that our direct access customers 
have managed their price exposure by locking in with a contract and price 
with us.  We took the price exposure for our customers and managed it 
appropriately.

If other members of ARM are not hedging their short retail position than they 
are just as "bad" as the utility.  

This is not the message we want to be sending.  This pleading should say what 
Bruno's change proposes, and then little more.  The competitive market looks 
like  a bunch of "yahoos" for advocating markets and price volatility and 
then asking for handouts!

Subject: Comments on Duque/ Wood Decisions -- Due TODAY 8/16

Attached is the first draft ARM's our comments. It will be revised, however 
we need to get comments in ASAP

I asked Jeanne Bennett to change the third sentence in the introduction from 
"ARM does not dispute the need to offer relief..." to a statement that would 
reflect ARM's belief that the market will ultimately offer the best hedging 
tools for all customers, However, ARM recognizes that there is an immediate 
problem in SDG&E than can be mitigated on an interim basis with the Wood or 
Duque proposal.  

The paragraph will be redrafted to clarify the fact that we do not want the 
levelized payment plan to be the default for any customer class and that the 
LPP should be only offered to smaller customers on an optional basis as 
larger customers are more sophisticated and can find these options in the 
market.

If you have concerns, please provide comments by 11 am CST on 8/16 as the 
filing is due on 8/16

Business World: How California Turned Out the Lights
By Holman W. Jenkins Jr.

08/30/2000
The Wall Street Journal
A27
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Back in the 1970s, National Lampoon proposed a solution for inflation: pay 
people less in salaries and wages, and
charge less for things in stores. 

Now the state of California has seized upon the identical solution for its 
electricity woes. By fiat, it has lowered the
price that utilities are legally allowed to pay for bulk electricity, and 
also lowered the price they are allowed to
charge for the same electricity to their end users.

Wow, we wish someone had hit upon this approach before. Rents too expensive? 
Make apartment owners put us
up for free. Medical bills a nuisance? Require doctors and hospitals to work 
for nothing. 

Almost any inconvenience can, in theory, be solved by passing a law 
compelling others to do what we want. If any
state is well situated to make this its comprehensive approach to governing, 
it's California -- being a state in close
geographical proximity to North Korea. 

Because each year the graduate schools release another class of educated 
professionals into the readership, we
probably need to emphasize why the National Lampoon solution wouldn't work: 
Lowering the price of electricity
creates an incentive for consumers to consume more. At the same time, 
lowering the price creates an incentive for
producers to produce less. 

Now, for extra credit: Whose idea of a solution is this? 

California's politicians, most notably State Sen. Steve Peace, have 
calculated, undoubtedly to a pointillistic degree,
that any blame for blackouts will naturally accrue first to the utilities -- 
because a blackout is an urgent problem
demanding an urgent solution. Meanwhile, higher prices are something 
consumers can resent at their leisure, even
unto November, and thus would be more likely to take out on elected 
officials. 

Electricity makes an interesting challenge for deregulators, one we've been 
fumbling heroically. Electricity cannot be
stored, except at ridiculous expense. Ever try to run your house on 
batteries? 

A second quality is that demand is highly variable, fluctuating by 100% in a 
day, and often nearly as much
seasonally (as measured peak to peak). To meet the highest demand, a utility 
might easily find itself having to keep
an entire generating facility on hand that it would only fire up a couple 
times a year. A peak plant -- the one that
stands between customers and a blackout -- runs only about 200 hours 
annually. That's a large capital good that
sits idle 357 days out of 365. 

A third quality is that electricity doesn't travel well over long distances, 
though technologists are working on this.
But thanks to the efforts of the New Yorker and other publications scaring 
people about the unproven health risks of
power lines, try building a new set of lines across anybody's neighborhood 
anyway. 

These are all reasons why, in the past, it was deemed efficient to produce 
and distribute power within one company
over a large geographic area. 

"Monopoly" is a bad word when used by a newspaper but not when used by an 
economist. It wasn't monopoly that
led utilities to build expensive nuclear plants in the 1970s and 1980s. It 
was "cost-plus" rate regulation. In other
words, any utility, as long as it could get a regulator's approval, was 
guaranteed to collect its construction costs
and an operating profit on any plant it built. 

Is this a good way to encourage the building of expensive power plants, 
enough so that there would always be
sufficient power to go around even on peak days? Yes. 

Result: To this day we have a system that in no way induces consumers to be 
rational in their usage. Looking
around, your columnist right now is running a fan, two computers and umpty 
lights, most of which he could turn off
with no impact on his comfort and productivity. In fact, the stereo has been 
switched on but turned down to zero
since last Friday. But why get off the couch to shut it off? 

The sensitive, new age solution: Reward utilities not for how much they 
invest in construction but how efficiently
they meet demand -- which, in the first instance, would mean incentives for 
consumers to rationalize their usage. 

The rough-and-ready solution: Free utilities to sock their customers with 
whatever prices they want, and let
customers fight back by turning off lights or seeking out alternatives (which 
exist aplenty if you look hard enough). 

But California and other states have opted for a bonehead-with-a-drawing 
board solution: They call it deregulation but
the scheme seems to have been designed with the idea that consumers still 
shouldn't know how much electricity
costs from one moment to the next. 

Utilities were more or less forcibly stripped of their generation role: Now 
they would be middlemen, buying power on
the open market. The problems with this approach range from a shortage of 
transmission capacity to the greatly
magnified difficulty of preventing grid overloads and other nasty physical 
effects when the generating plants and the
grid aren't under the same control. 

Even under deregulation, of course, utilities still have an obligation to 
meet peak demand. But, effectively, it's farmed
out to the market, and if the power isn't there, it isn't there. And 
California has made sure it won't be there in the
future by slamming down price controls. 

Maybe it's time we retired the word "market" altogether from the policy 
debate, since it's become one of those
conjuring words that justifies everything and has ceased to mean anything. A 
modern economy creates or negates
markets as it needs to: The real underpinning is property rights and freedom 
of contract. Would we tell GM to stop
making engines and buy them on the open market? No, because we assume that GM 
has every incentive to make
the most efficient decision itself. Yet government planners have decided, 
based on no evidence, that the age-old
vertical efficiencies in the electricity business simply don't exist. 

By whatever route, California's solution is to allow utilities with the skill 
and experience to run integrated power
distribution networks to get on with the job -- without either the old 
guarantees or the old heavy-handed restrictions
on their freedom to price. Utilities can judge for themselves how much of 
their demand to contract out to
independent suppliers. 

Undoubtedly there would be a need for residual regulation to protect the most 
vulnerable consumers and make sure
universal service is available to all. But that would be far less intrusive 
than the "deregulation" they've been
practicing in California -- and that's now unraveling in California, 
discrediting the idea of a more market-based
electrical system.

  State's Power Grid Again Pushed to Brink of Rolling Blackouts Energy: High
  temperatures, generator shutdowns push usage within 5% of capacity. Heat 
wave is
  expected to continue today. 
  NANCY RIVERA BROOKS

  Los Angeles Times 
  Home Edition

  Sweltering weather across California pushed the state's heat-stressed 
electricity grid close
  to meltdown Monday, and state power officials urged electricity 
conservation because today
  and Wednesday could be even worse.

  Power was cut to hundreds of large business customers and about 125,000 
residential and
  business air-conditioner and agricultural pumping customers Monday after 
the California
  Independent System Operator, which runs the electricity grid for about 75% 
of the state,
  declared a Stage 2 power emergency. At Stage 2, when the grid is using more 
than 95% of
  available power, the state's big investor-owned utilities are asked to 
interrupt power to
  customers that have agreed to this voluntary action in exchange for 
discounted rates.

  Grid reliability was threatened when two electricity units in Northern 
California stopped
  working for a time as heavy air-conditioner demand began to push power use 
higher,
  Cal-ISO spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle said.

  Demand peaked at about 42,000 megawatts on the Cal-ISO grid, but the two 
unidentified
  units, representing about 320 megawatts of generation, were returned to 
service in the
  afternoon--in time to help keep the state from reaching its first Stage 3, 
which would lead to
  neighborhood blackouts.

  "We were right on the edge of warning about a possible Stage 3," McCorkle 
said. "A couple
  of generators fell offline in late morning, and that kind of gave everybody 
a scare."

  A Stage 3 emergency would be declared if power reserves fall below 1.5%--in 
essence,
  when the electricity grid is using more than 98.5% of available power--and 
rotating outages
  of nonessential customers for an hour or longer would become likely to keep 
the grid from
  failing. That would result in widespread blackouts lasting several hours.

  Electricity use was also high in the area served by the Los Angeles 
Department of Water
  and Power, peaking near 4,750 megawatts Monday. But DWP customers were not
  threatened by power interruptions or rolling blackouts because the 
municipal utility has
  more than enough generating capacity to meet demand.

  "We're doing OK as we have all summer long," said DWP General Manager S. 
David
  Freeman.

  Cal-ISO asked Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric and San 
Diego Gas &
  Electric to call on all of their interruptible-power customers to 
immediately stop using
  electricity, representing a potential 3,000 megawatts, or roughly the 
amount of electricity
  used by 3 million homes.

  Thousands of students at College of the Canyons in Valencia experienced the 
California
  equivalent of a snow day Monday when power outage alarms rang about 1:30 
p.m, the
  seventh time this year, college spokesman Sue Bozman said. If the college 
doesn't pull the
  plug, it pays a big fine.

  "For several years, we saved $100,000 a year by being on this 
interruptible-service plan,"
  said Bozman, who with other administrators finished the work day with 
mobile phones and
  portable computers. "But when the alarm rings and we decline to turn off 
our power, it's a
  whole different ballgame."

  One such day in May, during final exams, the college didn't cut power and 
penalties totaled
  $30,000, she said.

  During the height of Monday's power crisis, PG&E--whose territory suffered 
local blackouts
  on June 14 in a similar reliability emergency--kept an open telephone line 
to Cal-ISO for
  minute-by-minute updates, spokesman Ron Low said.

  SCE and the other utilities begged customers to use as little electricity 
as possible, and
  grocery stores around the state voluntarily reduced lighting and other 
power use to comply.

  "We're issuing a call to action, a call that everyone needs to take 
seriously," Pam Bass,
  SCE's senior vice president for customer service, said in a statement as 
electricity use
  soared Monday. "If the demand for power does not decrease soon, we will be 
directed by
  the state to begin shutting off power for blocks of customers. Everyone 
needs to cut their
  use of power now to avoid forced outages."

  Today and Wednesday could be even more challenging: Cal-ISO is predicting 
peak use of
  44,827 megawatts for today. Peak demand was expected to be 44,537 megawatts 
on
  Monday, but conservation and power-interruption programs kept the total 
lower.

  "We are anticipating tomorrow to be a good deal like today," SCE 
spokeswoman Karen
  Shepard-Grimes said Monday. Electricity demand in SCE territory peaked at 
17,860
  megawatts before the Rosemead-based utility asked power customers to cut 
2,500
  megawatts of electricity. "It got really touchy today," she said.

Rob -- This info is great.  For use w/ the media, we'll need to simplify, and 
it would be helpful to have specific examples of what a utility would pay and 
the overall result of a market with price caps, the current "open" market 
(under ISO regulation, buying from the PX) and a pure open market (using 
hedges to manage risk).  

thx.

Here is a one pager on the general problem of price regulation.  Next we will 
need to discuss the particular cases and identify specific distortions, which 
the field people will have to provide.

Rob --

I think this is a great start for the outline of policy reasons against price 
caps.  If possible, let's run it by PR to see what more structure they want.

See if this is of use and whether I need to do more.

I hope it sets a framework from which the specifics of the price cap examples 
and distortions can be added.

Attached is an article about Minnesota Attorney General Mike Hatch who said 
Thursday he would oppose legislation to deregulate energy markets in the 
state - at least for now. "Let's see a state where it works," said Hatch.


Minnesota Attorney General Hatch calls for wait to deregulate. He thinks it 
would dim energy outlook .

Subject: Governor's Press Conference -- Shot Across the Bow


Governor Davis held a press conference today at which he accused
"out-of-state generators" of price gouging and market manipulation.  He
called on FERC to expedite their investigation of the market and to provide
for consumer rebates if FERC cannot conclude that California prices are
"just and reasonable."

Below are my notes from the press conference.  Attached is the Governor's
press release.

Karen Edson

Notes from Gov. Davis=01, Press Conference:


Opening Statement
Record hot temperatures; lack of supply; price manipulation have created th=
e
crisis.
Electricity is the life blood of the State's economy.
He (the Governor) has responded with several recent steps.
Among them is his request that the AG & FERC examine price manipulation

1st Point
He is calling on the CPUC to establish a price stability rate for consumers
and business.
His intent is to reduce rates to $55-$65/mo. for next year or two.  (This
point was unclear.  Did he mean rates, bills, or what?)
Customers need predictable, reliable, affordable rates

2nd Point
The Governor called on President Clinton and Chairman Hoecker to expedite a=
n
investigation of the unconscionable rates being charged by out-of-state
generators to California utilities
The Governor wants FERC to make evidentiary findings that rates are just an=
d
reasonable.  If FERC can=01,t make such findings, he wants them to require
consumer rebates.  (This portion of his comments is not reflected in the
attached press release.  It is taken right from the script of Senator Steve
Peace.)

3rd Point
Believes deregulation will work. Generators must be held responsible.  When
gouging and extorting; you must pay the price.

Attached is an article from the San Diego Union-Tribune stating that a good 
solution for the power crisis is energy conservation through the use of 
real-time meters. By using the real time meters, consumers will have better 
knowledge of energy prices and be less likely to use as much power during 
peak times, thus bringing demand into line with current supply. Is there a 
way for EES or the New Energy Company to take advantage of this type of 
opportunity through their energy management products?

Consumers Grow More Anxious As They Are Cut Loose In <B>Electricity's</B>
New
Free Market
By KIRK JOHNSON

Aug. 27, 2000
New York Times
Page 29, Column 2
c. 2000 New York Times Company

   Over the last 20 years, a dogma has taken root in America that says
people would be happier and better off if they were all continually
shopping for the best deals. Consumers, according to this theory, should
be empowered and freed from the old business monopolies and the dictates
of fussy bureaucrats.



  So airlines were deregulated, and telephone service, and then the
Internet arrived, giving people the ability to choose from 10 different
sellers of the same merchandise. The bull market on Wall Street brought
5,000 mutual funds begging for attention. Having more choices became an
end in itself.

   But for millions of people, especially in New York and California,
the doctrine of the sovereign consumer has come into question this
summer around a commodity that most had taken completely for granted:
<B>electricity</B>. A recently deregulated <B>energy</B> market, which was
supposed to
increase choices and reduce prices, has, for most residents, done
nothing of the kind. Many community leaders and politicians, calling for
investigations and caps on rising <B>electricity</B> bills -- up 30
percent to
40 percent from those of last August in many areas -- have denounced
<B>energy</B> <B>deregulation</B> as either a failure or a fraud.
   Some social scientists say that the anxiety over <B>energy</B> is
exposing
something even deeper in the human wiring. At a time when protesters
have railed in Seattle and Washington against chain stores and global
branding, and prominent social critics have denounced the intrusion of
endless choice into every corner of life -- a phenomenon that Barry
Schwartz, a psychologist at Swarthmore College, calls ''the tyranny of
freedom'' -- the public's worries about <B>electricity</B> may say more
about
human nature than about kilowatts.
   Perhaps, this alternative theory says, there is a point at which
people no longer wish to be autonomous, rational consumers at all. Maybe
they would just as soon delegate their decisions regarding some
transactions, as they did when Consolidated Edison was the only game in
town and government was assigned to make sure that the company played by
the rules. Maybe when it comes to <B>electricity</B>, a mysterious and
dangerous thing that is also the foundation of modern living, Americans
are just a little afraid to be alone.
   ''In the past we trusted that state regulators who were appointed by
our elected officials were watching out for us, which may or may not
have been true,'' said Edward A. Smeloff, a former utility industry
official who runs a research group on <B>electricity</B> at Pace
University.
''The new model is, 'Figure it out for yourself.' ''
   Some economists and <B>energy</B> industry experts say the sense of
powerlessness and confusion that many people feel is perhaps as much a
source of anxiety and anger as higher <B>electricity</B> bills. The
players
have all changed and no one seems to be in charge.
   The old Brooklyn Union Gas Company, for example, still remembered by
many New York residents for the fuzzy, feel-good images of its
advertising, has become the cool and metallic-sounding KeySpan
<B>Energy</B>.
The old Con Ed, on the other hand, was like a crotchety grandfather who
sometimes had to be prodded and yelled at, but who nonetheless presided
over the system.
   The company now throws up its hands  and says it is not responsible
for recent price increases; Con Ed's wires are simply a delivery
mechanism for the unregulated corporations that own generating plants,
Con Ed's chairman said at a recent hearing at City Hall.
   Opinion poll takers say anxiety about deregulation may also have
something to do with a contradiction in the American psyche that they
say has opened up in recent years, a contradiction about what people
really want. Surveys conducted by Yankelovich Partners, a research and
consulting firm based in Norwalk, Conn., have said, for example, that a
majority of people want more control over the details of their lives,
but a majority also want to simplify their lives, a result that Barbara
R. Caplan, a partner at the firm, has called ''the paradox of our
time.''
   Deregulated <B>energy</B> arrived right in the middle of those
conflicting
goals; because only a handful of <B>energy</B> competitors have been
attracted
to the New York market, most people still do not have much choice in
their <B>electricity</B>, and yet it all seems more complicated than ever,
as
well as more expensive.
   Another factor, some researchers say, may be a result of timing.
People have had experience with deregulation, and they have seen that it
did not always unfold to their benefit. The hub-and-spoke system
developed by the airline industry, for example, has given airlines
near-monopoly power at many airports around the country, resulting in
less competition, not more. Consumers have also seen that although tools
like the Internet have made buyers more powerful in getting good prices,
corporations on the other side of the transaction have become more
powerful, too, in gathering information about them.
   ''Years ago, you went into an auto dealership and had to negotiate to
buy a car, but only the corporate side had knowledge of what the real
costs were,'' said Mark L. Gillenson, a professor of management
information systems at the University of Memphis. ''Now you go into the
Internet, and lots of places will give you that information for free.''
On the other hand, Professor Gillenson said, the data that corporations
are collecting about people are creating what the old car dealer could
never have imagined: knowledge about what people want before they even
ask.
   Lurking behind all those forces, some psychologists say, is the
growing sense that people are simply being asked to decide too much.
Economic deregulation has accompanied what may be called social
deregulation, as issues that were not even considered decisions in the
past  have become issues of conscious choice: whether to get married and
have children, or how to express oneself sexually, as gay, straight or
somewhere in between.
   And the more choices there are, the more it can seem possible to
achieve an ideal result in every case, leading to a doomed, treadmill
kind of behavior often seen in people who continually change their
long-distance telephone service as they endlessly seek an incremental
price advantage.
   ''Over what domains in life are you supposed to have control?'' said
Professor Schwartz, the Swarthmore College psychologist. ''Nobody gets
depressed when you can't control the weather, and years ago nobody got
depressed because they couldn't control your telecommunications or
<B>electricity</B> either, because those things couldn't be controlled,''
he
said. ''But now you can, or you're told that you can, and so you're
going to be continually frustrated.''
   And <B>electricity</B> is also just different. Unlike a telephone call,
or
an airline ticket, nobody ever really wants to buy <B>electricity</B>
itself --
rather, people buy its expression and result: a cold beer in the fridge,
a light to read by. By the standards of American marketing, it is barely
a product at all.
   ''People want to make choices about clothes and restaurants and what
houses they live in, but a lot of us would rather not be bothered with
having to make a choice about <B>electricity</B>,'' said Wendy Kaminer, a
public policy fellow at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study in
Cambridge, Mass. ''It's not a desire to be disempowered,'' Ms. Kaminer
added. ''It's a desire not to be bothered.''
   Finally, some experts think that the long bull market for stocks, in
which share prices mostly just go up, has made people forget a
fundamental truth about how markets work: they are genuinely fair only
over the long run, while at any given time, there are likely to be as
many losers as winners.
   ''Deregulation and privatization were sold implicitly on the
assumption that everybody can win from this, but I'm hard pressed to
find an example in the real world where that has happened,'' said Willis
Emmons, a professor in the strategy, public policy and ethics department
at Georgetown University's business school. Right now, Professor Emmons
added, ''maybe somebody is winning, but it isn't the consumer.''

Today, Friday, Gary Fergus of the Brobeck firm and I met with Attny. Harvey
Morris of the CPUC to negotiate an extension of time for responding to the
five subpoenas issued to Enron affiliates and Portland General.   We
negotiated both an extension for initial responses (two weeks) plus an
opportunity to submit a proposal for a significant reduction in the scope of
the request for production of documents.   This will include a further
extension for other documents that are to be produced, as well as a
reservation of rights to object to the production of other documents.  We
are working in close contact with Richard Sanders and the EPMI legal team in
Portland on further refining both responses and potential objections.

However, in light of recent communications between the Governor's office and
senior Enron officials, and the prospect of additional such communications,
Both Gary and I wanted to report an unusual aspect of the negotiation with
the CPUC.   At the beginning of the meeting, as we were indicating the
overall burden of the request, the CPUC attorney indicated the extreme
pressure the Commission was under to "get to the bottom" of what was
happening in the California power markets.  He also recited that "many
parties have pledged their cooperation in this investigation to the
Governor".  He then proceeded to state that parties who delayed providing
responses and raised objections to the requests for production instead of
cooperating would "be placed on a list of non-cooperative parties" which
would be made available to the Governor and legislators and that such
parties would have to bear the consequences of such actions.

This rather explicit threat is, in my experience, unprecedented at the CPUC.
I also know the attorney in question well enough to know that he would never
invoke political reprisals on his own, and was obviously instructed to do so
by CPUC Pres. Lynch or her senior staff.  Both Gary Fergus and I responded
that such a threat was both improper and disturbing for a party simply
trying to exercise its legitimate rights to adjudicate burdensome discovery
requests, but there was no attempt to withdraw the threat.  This comment
speaks volumes about the pressure which the CPUC President feels to achieve
a politically acceptable result in this matter.  Those senior Enron
officials in communication with the Governor should be made aware of this
incident.

Steve  Here  are  4  slides I developed for your  use,  two showing the 
cumulative  gas cost
savings  in the  U.S.   at the city gate due  to  deregulation of the 
interstate pipelines -- calculated   in both nominal and real terms   since 
1984.  The  savings
have  grown  to over  $144  billion  (nominal)  and   $268 billion  ( in real 
terms ).

The other   two  slides show  what  key  factors  moved    WTI   market 
prices   and  Louisiana   gas prices over the past  12 months.  I am 
developing the final 
electricity  price  slide to show the key  factors   that  changed   US  
electricity prices at key basis  points--  including  Southern California   
and  ERCOT  over the past   12 months...  Margaret

Sorry to bring it up again, but did we finally give up on UC/CSU?  Jessie 
Knight called me.  He's now the CEO of the Chamber of Commerce is S.D.  They 
plan to launch a campaign next week telling businesses in S.D. that the best 
thing to leave Sempra and switch to another provider.  ("Do you want the 
Legislature to manage your energy costs, or do you want to manage them 
yourself?")  

They want to give illustrative examples of folks who've switched and how well 
they're doing.  Ray McNally's sister is an extremely enthusiastic Enron 
customer and is going to contact the Chamber.  Be useful to have a business 
or two, or, UC/CSU.  Know it's a long shot, but figured it don't hurt to try.

  Internet Utility Plans Move to Westchester

  c. 2000 New York Times Company 

  The New Power Company, an Internet utility, is planning to establish its 
headquarters in
  Purchase, N.Y., state and Westchester County officials said yesterday.

  New Power was formed in May by the Houston energy giant Enron to work with 
America
  Online and I.B.M. to sell electricity and natural gas to homes and small 
businesses over
  the Internet. It has been temporarily located in Greenwich, Conn.

  In return for its commitment to create 400 new jobs at its future 
headquarters and invest $7
  million in renovating and outfitting 80,000 square feet at a Purchase 
office complex, New
  Power is eligible to apply for hundreds of thousands of dollars in energy 
discounts and tax
  exemptions from state and county agencies. Joseph P. Fried (NYT)

  Markets Drillers Seek New Natural Gas Sites

  Natural gas drillers are turning up the heat on Uncle Sam to open up more 
areas for
  exploration, amid the highest gas prices ever.

  Anadarko Petroleum Corp. said Wednesday it plans to start drilling for 
natural gas in two
  parts of the Arctic by early 2002, in hopes that a gas pipeline to the 
Lower 48 states will be
  built by 2008.

  The company last month bought the right to explore 176,000 acres in the 
MacKenzie Delta
  of the Canadian Arctic. It will begin seismic shooting, which maps the 
geology of potential
  drilling sites, this winter in both the Delta and Alaska's North Slope, 
said John Seitz,
  president and chief operating officer.

  Natural gas prices in the last decade haven't been high enough to justify 
the expense of
  building a gas pipeline from Alaska, major oil companies have said.

  But with prices having doubled this year, interest in building a line has 
been renewed.

  Gas futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 4.5 cents to $5.318 
per million
  British thermal units Wednesday, down just slightly from Tuesday's record.

  "The country needs gas from the Arctic," Seitz said, speaking at the Dain 
Rauscher
  Wessels oil and gas conference in Houston.

  About a dozen companies have pipeline proposals on the table, Seitz said. 
He estimated
  that at least one route could be built by 2008. Some estimates are for as 
early at 2005, he
  said.

  Drilling on both Anadarko's MacKenzie and North Slope properties could 
begin in December
  2001 or January 2002, Seitz said.

  But chances for construction of a gas pipeline could be threatened if the 
government
  intervenes to push down prices, experts say.

  "We've got an election year, so anything's up for grabs," said Lisa 
Stewart, executive vice
  president of business development for oil and gas explorer Apache Corp.

  Another energy giant, gas producer and energy trader Enron Corp., also 
warned against
  government intervention.

  "Markets do correct, and this market also will correct," Enron CEO Kenneth 
Lay said at
  the Governors' Natural Gas Summit in Columbus, Ohio. "As long as the 
regulators will leave
  it alone . . . this market will come back into balance in the next two or 
three years."

  Without government interference, Apache thinks prices will remain appealing 
enough to
  spur new drilling. Stewart noted that gas inventories are low nationwide 
and demand is
  expected to boom.

  The government will probably move or be pressured to open up lands now off 
limits to
  explorers, rather than impose price controls, Seitz said. California and 
the Rocky
  Mountains are ripe for exploration, he said. "The solution for the prices 
is more supply, and
  we need to have more land to explore and exploit," he said.

  Shares of both Anadarko and Apache rose Wednesday, even as many other 
energy stocks
  fell. Anadarko (ticker symbol: APC) gained 95 cents to $64; Apache rose 19 
cents to
  $62.69. Both trade on the New York Stock Exchange.

  Enron (ENE), one of the hottest energy stocks, fell $2.69 to $82.17 on the 
New York Stock
  Exchange.

Enron's CEO Lay: Don't Overreact To Natural Gas Prices

09/21/2000
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

(This article was originally published Wednesday) 


HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- The competitive natural gas market can deliver reliable 
service and help consumers
reduce exposure to rising gas prices, Enron Corp. (ENE) chairman and chief 
executive officer Kenneth Lay said
Wednesday in Ohio.

Using a number of slide graphics, Lay spoke at Wednesday's natural gas summit 
in Columbus, Ohio, convened by
Alaska Gov. Tony Knowles and Ohio Gov. Bob Taft. 

Lay warned against overreacting to the recent run-up in prices and urged 
officials to encourage utilities to take
advantage of price hedging opportunities to protect consumers against price 
volatility. 

Lay said the Nymex natural gas futures board shows gas prices, although at a 
peak $5.495 per million British
thermal units, declining to $3.345/MMBtu by September 2003. 

"The gas resource base remains robust and today's prices will self-correct 
over time," Lay said. Overall, he said, the
market has delivered more than $174 billion in savings to consumers since the 
market opened to competition in
1984. 

Lay said those utilities that haven't protected their customers against 
rising prices this winter will pay less per unit
of gas than they did in the early 1980s. 

The Enron chairman, a close friend of Republican Texas Gov. George W. Bush, 
also urged government officials to
consider lifting access restrictions to develop new gas supplies to meet 
growing electricity generation demand from
the growing digital economy. 

Federal statutes restrict production drilling in the U.S. Eastern Seaboard, 
the Gulf Coast of Florida and California,
and the Rockies, Lay said.. 

About 400 people attended the one-day conference Wednesday, sponsored by the 
Interstate Oil and Gas Compact
Commission (IOGCC). 

Also offering presentations were Dr. Fausto Alzati Araiza, Mexican 
President-Elect Vicente Fox's energy advisor
and Nick Schultz, vice president of regulatory and transportation policy for 
the Canadian Association of Petroleum
Producers. 

Daniel Yergin, chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, also urged a 
"continent-wide" response by
industry and government to address the current natural gas price shock and 
meet long-term energy needs. 

The price shock means most U.S. utilities anticipate an increase of between 
20%-40% in residential heating bills
this winter while industrial customers will be hit even harder - as much as 
50%-100% increases in energy costs,
Yergin said. -By John Edmiston, Dow Jones Newswires, 713-547-9209;

Report on Business: Technology At Work
Web consultants feel dot-com pain Failure of many Internet startups causes 
plunge in consulting revenue
DOUGLAS A. BLACKMON AND ANN CARRNS
Wall Street Journal

09/21/2000
The Globe and Mail
Metro
T6
All material copyright Thomson Canada Limited or its licensors. All rights 
reserved.

A big dose of reality is sinking in for the Web's professional gurus. 

After months of defying the gravitational pull of imploding dot-coms, 
revenues are plunging at some Internet
consulting firms as big companies shift their investment strategies for Web 
technology. Investors have reacted by
letting the air out of a slew of once high-flying stocks.

One of the fastest-growing consultancies, iXL Enterprises Inc., announced the 
layoff of 350 workers less than a
week after the resignation of its president and an announcement that revenue 
in the current quarter will be as much
as 20 per cent lower than expected. 

Meanwhile, there were signs that an earlier generation of consulting firms 
was trying to move in for the kill, mounting
raids to steal talented young Web experts from the battered firms. Deloitte 
Consulting was the most brazen, taking
out a full-page ad in The Wall Street Journal urging employees of Web firms 
to jump ship. 

The extent and precise nature of the Web consulting fallout isn't clear. iXL, 
Viant Corp. and Xpedior Inc., each of
which have issued warnings of lower-than-anticipated third-quarter revenues, 
maintain that large firms are slowing
spending as they feel less pressure from Internet start-ups. 

"In June and July, the global 1,000 companies started looking around and 
saying, 'Holy Cow, these dot-coms aren't
around anymore, nipping at my heels . . . I'm going to take more time to make 
these decisions,' " said William
Nussey in an interview after he resigned as president of iXL. 

But senior executives at major corporations say that while the climate and 
pace may have changed, they are still
investing heavily in the Internet. 

Bank of America, for instance, announced in July that it plans to spend 
$70-million (U.S.) on electronic commerce
initiatives over the coming six months. 

Kevin Koertje, marketing director at Boise Cascade Corp.'s office-products 
unit, which generates hundreds of
millions in on-line sales, said the company "is pouring a tonne more money" 
into Web systems. 

But much of that is going to older firms with expertise in legacy computer 
systems, such as KPMG Consulting, and
to narrowly specialized technology experts. 

Indeed, the biggest shift in Web consulting may be simply that some customers 
are no longer convinced they want
outside help in developing on-line strategies. Xpedior, for instance, said 
Sears Roebuck & Co., which is building up
its in-house Web expertise, has reduced its use of the consulting firm's 
services this year. 

Analysts say investors must differentiate between firms with true strategic 
expertise to sell and those that are
merely proficient at setting up Web sites. 

Mayank Tandon, an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott, said firms with true 
"intellectual capital" will be the
ones to succeed, citing Chicago consultant Diamond Technology Partners Inc., 
which works closely with Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. and Enron Corp. 

Raul Fernandez, chief executive officer of Proxicom Inc. of Reston, Va., said 
his firm is on track to meet revenue
projections.

An arm of energy giant Enron Corp. will build a $100 million power plant 
south of Colorado Springs to sell electricity
to the former Public Service Co. of Colorado, which wants to add generating 
capacity around the state. 

The plant, to consist of four natural gas-powered turbines generating 215 
megawatts, will be built near an existing
electric substation, west of Interstate 25 and about six miles south of 
Colorado Springs Utilities' Ray Nixon Power
Plant.

Denver-based Xcel Energy Inc., formerly Public Service, serves Denver, 
northern Colorado and other areas outside of
Colorado Springs. It plans to spend $1.55 billioncq to upgrade its 
power-generation and transmission capacity
around the state. The goal is to have enough new power for 1.6 million 
households beyond the 2.5 million customers
Xcel Energy now serves. 

Earlier this year, Xcel sought proposals from companies interested in meeting 
its projected power needs. Enron
North America Corp., a subsidiary of Houston-based Enron, an electric, gas 
and communications powerhouse, was
one of nine successful bidders responding to Xcel's request for proposals. 
Those nine bidders will help supply about
1,500 megawatts of generating capacity around Colorado. 

Another successful bidder, Wilexco Inc. of Englewood, also was chosen by 
Xcel, and plans to build an 83-megawatt
plant south of the planned Enron facility at a cost of more than $90 million. 
It will burn tires to generate its power
although the facility still needs to clear various local and state regulatory 
hurdles. 

Enron should complete its facility by June, said Eric Thode, director of 
public relations for Enron North America
Corp. Wilexco's plant is targeted for operation by 2003, said company owner 
Brian Wilde. 

Xcel spokeswoman Jessica Anderson said her company has a 10-year deal with 
Enron to buy power. Wilde said
his deal with Xcel is for 15 years. 

"The people who live and work here in Colorado need this additional 
generation," Anderson said. 

At the end of those initial contracts, Enron and Wilexco could sell power to 
other users. The opportunity for such
deals might be enhanced if Colorado deregulates its electric industry and 
opens it up to competition. 

Until now, state lawmakers have rejected deregulation efforts. Still, 
Anderson said, the addition of the power plants
helps position the state for the time when deregulation takes place. Xcel, as 
Public Service, supported deregulation
legislation in the General Assembly. 

Wilde, of Wilexco, said selling electricity in a deregulated market wasn't 
the reason his firm sought to build its plant
because he doesn't know what the electric industry will be like in 15 years. 

Thode echoed that sentiment, saying, "This plant is being built for the deal 
as it currently exists. This deal makes
sense because this deal makes sense, period." 

Colorado Springs Utilities also is adding generating capacity. 

Two 30-megawatt, gas-fired turbines have been added to the Nixon Plant, which 
burns coal to generate its power.

            Koch forms unit to trade bandwidth

                           WICHITA, Kan. -- Closely held Koch Industries, one 
of the
                           world's largest energy traders, said it has formed 
a unit to trade
                           bandwidth, or spare capacity on fiber-optic 
cables. 

                           Koch Global Bandwidth Services will be led by Bill 
Mohl, who
                           has held several senior management jobs at Koch 
for the past five
                           years. He also was vice president at Altra Energy 
Technologies.
                           The unit will be based in Houston. 

                           Koch Industries, based in Wichita, joins companies 
such as
                           Houston-based Enron Corp. and Tulsa-based Williams 
Cos. that
                           have diversified into trading bandwidth from their 
pipeline
                           business. 

                           Enron plans to spend as much as $1.95 billion over 
the next two
                           to three years to expand its fiber-optic network 
and
                           broadband-trading operations, Chief Executive Ken 
Lay said
                           Wednesday in Houston. 


USA: Profit-taking hits Enron stock.

09/20/2000
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2000.

HOUSTON, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Energy marketer Enron Corp. saw its stock fall 
sharply for a second day
Wednesday, a move analysts attributed to profit-taking after a strong run for 
the shares since early July. 

Enron closed $2-11/16 lower at $82-3/16 on the New York Stock Exchange 
Wednesday after losing $5-9/16
Tuesday, making a total decline of slightly more than 9 percent over both 
days.

Analysts noted the decline followed a strong performance by the stock, which 
broke above a mid-$60s to mid-$70s
trading range in August to hit a 52-week high of $90-9/16 on Aug. 23, more 
than doubling its end-1999 value of
$44-6/16. 

"Inevitably you are going to get some profit-taking as we get near the end of 
the quarter and people want to lock in
some of their profits," said Merrill Lynch analyst Donato Eassey. 

Ed Tirello of Deutsche Banc Alex Brown said the decline was due in part to 
investors viewing Enron as a
technology play, because of its online trading and broadband businesses. 

Consequently Enron's stock was susceptible to weakness in the tech-heavy 
Nasdaq market this month, which
appeared to have triggered selling by momentum investors, Tirello said. 

Merrill Lynch's Eassey said Enron's stock might also have been hurt by an 
article in the weekly Texas supplement
to the Wall Street Journal, which called into question the trading profits 
reported by Enron and other big energy
marketers. 

Eassey dismissed the article as "misleading" and said he retained a Buy 
rating on Enron's stock with a 12
month-price target of $95. 

"This is a stock that you've got to have in your core portfolio. Enron is 
still one of the premier companies that you
can own in all of the market," he said. 

However, investing in Enron was not without risks and amounted to betting on 
the company's ability to execute
successfully on new technology opportunities, he added.

Re: Electric Power Industry Reform

Dear Chairman Hoecker:

We are consumers or represent consumers of electric power.  We write to urg=

you and your colleagues to take the initiative to address the intolerable=

of power at the lowest possible cost to consumers.

There are many actions you and your colleagues should take to ensure that t=

prices.  For example, you and your colleagues should remove roadblocks in t=

many companies that own transmission systems to restrict access to their=20

policy is shortages, blackouts and skyrocketing prices.  Like the interstat=

another just as freely as motorists do.  All electricity suppliers should=

have the same access to the transmission lines in order to transport power =

where it is most needed.

FERC should also discourage electricity suppliers=01, reliance on spot and=

short-term electricity markets for power supply.  Instead, FERC should urge=
=20
suppliers to purchase a portion of their power needs under long-term=20
contracts.  Locking in electricity costs at fixed prices protects consumers=

from unexpected price swings that can be financially devastating.

We strongly urge you and your colleagues to seize the initiative on these=

Very truly yours,

It's hard to formulate a position without more of the specifics, but I think 
our message should generally be:
We support providing immediate rate relief to small residential customers.  
We believe that relief is best provided by giving San Diego the ability to 
procure power on a fixed price basis from the market.  San Diego has offers 
in front of it now; those should be evaluated and the legislature and the 
commission should give San Diego the flexibility to accept one or more of 
them.  This is sounder than running huge deferrals (deficits) to be later 
recovered from consumers.
Rate relief should be accompanied by real reform.  Rate caps have bad long 
term consequences: they cause shortages.  Combining short-medium term rate 
relief with expedited siting of new facilities will address the near term 
problem while laying the proper groundwork for a long term solution.

This email reflects today's events in Sacramento. The information provided is 
subject to change because of constant flux. However it is important for us to 
provide this information for feedback and to caution as to new regulations 
that may affect some deals in the making .

Governor Davis, Assembly Women Susan Davis, and Senator Alpert had a press 
conference.

They will introduce a rate/bill stabilization plan for SDG&E and an 
expediting siting bill. There is no language as of yet. 

Although there is no specific language, the following elements may be 
included:

The stabilization plan will be applicable to residential and probably 
commercial customers in SDG&E
The bill cap may be set at $68 for residential.
The cap will be in place until the end of 2002
There will be language on expediting siting for generation plants  

Sam Wehn and Sandra McCubbin have been talking with the CEC executive 
director and several legislators about the siting portion of the bill. 

Any comments as to the bill cap proposal?

I agree with much of what Jeff has written.  Here are some additions -

On FERC getting a lot right, look at the Order in relation to our 4 key 
points filed in the White Paper -
Removing Market Transparency - Still need FERC to take action
Development of Forwards Market and Risk Management - Great results
Removing distortions on Prices - Wrong action
Ending Cal ISO / Cal PX Stakeholder Boards - Great results

On the risk management issue, FERC itself said "The single most important 
remedy that California market needs is the elimination of rules that prevent 
market participants from managing risk". [FERC PRESS RELEASE]

ADD - FERC Staff did a great job on preparing a detailed analysis of the 
market issues.

Here are the messages as I understand them.  Please let me know if I've 
misconstrued anything.  Thanks.

FERC got  a lot right in the order and we're very encouraged as a result.
In particular, ending the PX buy/sell requirement and permitting utilities to 
manage risk through a portfolio of short and long term contracts is a 
fundamental step in the right direction.
However, the proposed price cap is unworkable and will jeopardize realibility 
in California.  As structured, it will:
discourage the development of new generation to serve California
fail to provide adequate incentives for demand responsiveness.
force Enron to abandon 300 MWs of new power projects planned for California.
We look forward to participating in FERC's process and are hopeful that 
FERC's final order will fix the deficiencies in the current price cap 
proposal.
We encourage California to work with FERC to implement the proposals and 
quickly fix the flaws in the market on behalf of the state's consumers.

August 9, 2000

Wall Street Journal
200 Liberty Street
New York, NY 10281

Dear Editor:

John Fialka and Rebecca Smith are to be congratulated for the first piece of
journalism I am aware of that has attempted to explain what is really behind
the energy problems in the overheated West (Deregulation Leaves Electricity
Market Ripe for Manipulation by Power Firms, August 4). As this piece makes
clear, these crises of capacity and delivery of electricity around the
nation are doomed to continue for a simple reason:  electricity is a new
game, still being played under old rules. It is becoming a competitive
market, but the old rules written for a government-sanctioned monopoly market 
haven't been
updated.

As a result, some old-line utilities are exploiting and even contributing to
the crises with behavior that is not controlled by the old rules. As the
story details, utilities can drive prices up, exacerbate the energy shortage
by withholding electricity from the grid, or impede the free flow of
electricity across lines they control.  It's gamesmanship, very profitable
and not illegal, but definitely not in the public interest.

There is a very simple fix to the problem.  Write new rules.  Some old
laws need to be repealed. Some new oversight over this interstate commodity
has to be given the Federal government so that the general welfare gains
some control over local profiteering.  There are bills in Congress that make
these fixes. But a few powerful utilities block their passage. As long as
this blockade remains in effect, the industry cannot move forward to
modernize itself, build new generating capacity, and streamline the way
electricity moves from region to region.  Some day, Congress will pass the
needed legislation. Why not now?


Sincerely,




Bill Paxon
National Chairman
Americans for Affordable Electricity

Attached are some articles concerning further development and elaboration on 
the California power crisis and testimony to the Senate Energy, Utilities and 
Communications Committee by the CEO of CAL-ISO concerning the power 
issues/problems.

Testimony before Senate Energy, Utilities & Communications Committee And the 
Assembly Utilities & Commerce Committee
By Terry M. Winter, President and CEO
California Independent System Operator
August 10, 2000




An August 10th article from Natural Gas Intelligence that talks of the 
defensive posture the California Independent System Operator (Cal-ISO) has 
taken concerning the accusations that Governor Davis' emergency electricity 
report had made about the new deregulated market. 



An article from Natural Gas Intelligence talks about the vote, on July 31st,  
by the California Independent System Operator (Cal-ISO) Board to move the 
price cap to $250. The pros and cons of the price cap are mentioned, as well 
as other remedies for the power situation. Also, there are several comments 
in the article from California Senator Steve Peace on how "dysfunctional" the 
market is and why it should be restructured.

		 Subject: Re: Dereg Articles

I've taken the editor's pencil to Dan's draft.  Here's the result:

 Kirk Johnson's September 26th article, Debate on Need for New Power Plants 
Ignores Conservation, leaves readers with the misperception that competitive 
electricity markets discourage conservation.  True customer choice proves 
otherwise.
 My company supplies electricity to a number of businesses in Maine.  One of 
these customers is a  paper mill that uses more electricity than thousands of 
homes.  When New England power prices temporarily spiked last May, we 
actually paid the mill to shut down ... which they were more than happy to 
do.  As a result, the customer made money, the grid worked better, and 
residential customers didn't hear a word about "brownouts."
 The financial rewards in the open market create much better incentives to 
conserve than do the bureaucratic, one-size-fits-all programs of the 
regulatory elite.  It's proving true in Maine, why not give New York and 
other states the same choice?

Calif. city contracts with Enron to protect from volatility

08/08/2000
Megawatt Daily

  A small California city that currently buys one-third of its
electricity on the wholesale market has turned to Enron Power Marketing
for protection from price volatility.

  The City of Roseville, which operates a municipal electric utility,
last week signed a five-year contract with Enron, beginning Sept. 1,
under which Enron will provide the city with 50 MW around-the-clock at a
fixed price of $49/MWh. The total bill to the city will come to $114
million.
  "One-third of our needs today, we have to go the market," said Tom
Habashi, director of Roseville Electric. The muni, which has a peak
summer load of 240 MW to 250 MW, obtains about one-third of its power
needs from the Western Area Power Administration and the remaining third
from generating units it owns through the Northern California Power
Agency.

  Hot weather in June drove demand much higher than Roseville had
predicted earlier in the year, Habashi said. Power consumption in July
was below predictions, but prices were twice as high as had been
forecast. The cost for power in August is expected to remain much higher
than predicted, Habashi said.

  Once the summer months have passed, Roseville expects to pay about $6
million more than it had budgeted for wholesale power expenses. That,
Habashi said, led the city to look for alternatives.

  "We had to weigh things out, see whether we are willing to take the
risk of market price fluctuations and pass those prices along to
customers," he said.

  On the flipside, he noted, prices could go below the fixed rate
Roseville will pay to Enron through September 2005. The city, through a
vote of the City Council last Friday, chose to contract with Enron
despite the potential risk. Habashi said the contract "will give us some
stability."

  Another unknown variable, Habashi said, is how many Roseville
customers will switch power providers. A few were given the option at
the beginning of this year, but none have left yet. Choice for all
customers will be phased in over four years.

  The city, which is located about 15 miles from Sacramento, expects
rapid residential and business growth, and is forecasting that its
electricity needs will double by 2005.         ML

Financial Desk 
State's Utilities Could Be in Hot Water as Bills Are Due Power: Whether they 
can collect funds for escalating costs is a question that worries Wall 
Street, others.
CHRIS KRAUL

As the meter runs on California's electricity crisis, shock over this 
summer's price spikes is giving way to a new concern: uncertainty over 
whether and how the state's three investor-owned utilities can collect the 
staggering amounts in power costs they haven't been allowed to pass through 
to consumers. 
The unanswered question is how high the bill--now $4 billion and 
counting--will go, and whether consumers will foot all or part of it. And 
that there are no easy answers--perhaps short of an overhaul of the state's 
deregulated power market, or legislation from officials seemingly reluctant 
to act--only adds to the growing anxiety. 
Rate freezes in effect at Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric 
and San Diego Gas & Electric, which serve about three-quarters of the state's 
residents and businesses, are forcing the utilities to borrow an estimated $1 
billion a month to cover their added wholesale costs. Those loans are 
draining the companies' resources and threatening their financial structure, 
analysts say. 
The rising unpaid balance presents a longer-term burden that worries Wall 
Street, the state's business interests and, of course, the utilities. If 
passed along to consumers, the amount could ultimately negate the promised 
benefits of cheap energy that were the reason for being for the landmark 
deregulation of California's electricity industry. But making the utilities 
absorb the entire "undercollections" would strike a grievous financial blow 
to the companies. 
The crisis also has created a potential time bomb for shareholders of parent 
companies Edison International and PG&E Corp. Skyrocketing wholesale 
electricity costs are canceling out deregulation's underlying assumption of 
low-cost wholesale energy--and the projected generous retail margins with 
which utilities were to pay off nuclear plants and other uneconomical assets. 
The deregulation law gave utilities until March 2002 to complete the payoff, 
when open-market conditions would take over in their service areas. But with 
wholesale electricity costs where they are, the "stranded asset" balances are 
growing instead of shrinking--and posing an enormous potential hit for 
shareholders, who would have to absorb the remaining "bad asset" costs after 
the deadline passes. 
Whether the companies' shareholders or ratepayers--or both--end up footing 
the undercollection bill, all Californians could pay in the long run, 
analysts say, if current market problems remain unresolved and the state is 
seen as a less attractive place in which to do business. 
How will it all shake out? Wall Street is as much in the dark as 
Californians, said Lori Woodland, an analyst with Fitch Inc. of Chicago, one 
of three debt-rating agencies to recently lower their outlooks for Southern 
California Edison, PG&E, SDG&E and their parent companies. 
"It's not clear how regulators view this issue," Woodland said. "They may 
permit the utilities to recover their costs [from ratepayers]; they may not. 
That's a big uncertainty, and it may remain this way for months. Meanwhile, 
power prices are very high, and significant amounts of money are flowing out 
the door of the utilities." 
The uncertain prospects for collecting those billions of dollars also affect 
stock prices, and PG&E in particular has slumped in recent days as the 
implications register with investors. From a high of $31.64 on Sept. 11, PG&E 
shares have dropped to Thursday's close of $23.19 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
Amid the finger pointing and doubts, many wonder if electricity deregulation 
itself could be junked and the state's power industry re-regulated. Others 
suggest that rate freezes be extended indefinitely or hope that the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission now investigating the California electricity 
market will take corrective action to make it all better. 
Although the parties involved all seem fearful of the dimension of the crisis 
and doubtful of any near-term solution, consensus couldn't be less evident 
among the major players on how to deal with it. Although all three utilities 
agree the current market isn't working, they have not come forward with a 
common plan to solve the crisis and aren't working on one, sources say. 
Partial lifting of the rate freezes is advocated by PG&E Corp. and Sempra 
Energy, parent of SDG&E, the first state utility to pay off its stranded 
costs and thus be allowed to fully pass along wholesale costs to customers. 
The state Legislature has since stepped in to freeze SDG&E rates after a 
political firestorm fed by customer protests over bills that doubled and even 
tripled during the summer. 
Lifting the rate freeze would stem the tide of electricity undercollections, 
a sum the utilities realize is not necessarily collectible in the current 
political climate. 
"We have to fix these retail rates, which mask the true cost of electricity 
and which are creating the shortfall," said SDG&E President Edwin A. Guiles. 
In San Diego, for example, the average price paid by SDG&E customers zoomed 
from 11 cents per kilowatt-hour last year to 28 cents at its highest point 
this summer, before the Legislature stepped in to cap the rates, bringing the 
average price paid down to about 10 cents. 
So tinkering with the rate freeze could be politically hazardous. 
"The pain we saw in San Diego this summer is something we want to avoid for 
our customers in Northern and Central California," said PG&E spokesman Jon 
Tremayne. 
PG&E is expected soon to formally petition the state Public Utilities 
Commission to lift its rate freeze. The San Francisco-based utility argues 
that the $2.8-billion value of its Northern California hydroelectric 
properties, which under deregulation it is required to divest, would erase 
its stranded costs and make it eligible to pass along wholesale costs to 
consumers. 
Southern California Edison's chief financial officer, Jim Scilacci, said the 
utility could possibly be eligible to lift the rate freeze later this year if 
planned asset sales bring high enough prices. 
But with the legally mandated rate freeze in effect in San Diego, observers 
doubt that the state would let PG&E and Edison revert to market prices. 
In response, some consumer advocates are saying, in effect: Let the 
utilities, which ignored warnings of the electricity shortages at the root of 
the summer's price spikes, lie in the beds they made and pay the unforeseen 
costs of deregulation themselves. 
"Essentially this is the result of a deal gone wrong. It's buyer's remorse," 
said Michael Shames of the Utility Consumers' Action Network, a San Diego 
watchdog group. "The utilities cut a deal, and now they don't like the terms 
of the deal and they want out of it." 
Somewhat more flexible is Ed Yates, senior vice president of the 
Sacramento-based California League of Food Processors, whose energy-intensive 
industry could be devastated by the full brunt of high wholesale energy 
costs. 
"What frightens us is that the utilities and the state could declare the rate 
freeze over and we'd have a San Diego situation," Yates said, referring to 
how the rising summer power costs made some San Diego County agricultural 
products noncompetitive. "What we want is rate stability. But I don't see a 
solution. There are powerful interests at work who don't agree on the goal." 
State officials are divided, with some including PUC President Loretta Lynch 
looking to the federal government to impose order. Gov. Gray Davis has 
discussed holding an energy summit next month to try to hash out solutions, 
but no date or agenda have been set. 
"The governor is obviously aware of the problems that California utilities 
are facing and continues to be committed to making deregulation work and is 
calling on everyone involved to act in a responsible way," said spokesman 
Steve Maviglio, adding that Davis has set aside much of October to work on 
the problem. 
Lynch made it clear she will be unreceptive to any solution that would have 
consumers absorbing all of the undercollections and that resolving the 
utilities' huge debts must come as part of a comprehensive overhaul of 
California's dysfunctional electricity market. 
"I don't think there is a simple solution. The utilities have a problem, I 
agree, but the resolution is much more complex than having the ratepayer eat 
the bill," Lynch said. "The answer lies in a broader solution of addressing 
the wholesale energy market." 
Unclear is how long Wall Street would wait for some kind of resolution before 
downgrading utilities' debt, the next step after the negative outlook 
revisions. 
"There are obviously many challenges presented to the power industry," said 
Standard & Poor's David Bodek. "The costs are very high and at the end of the 
day have to be borne by someone. If it's the utilities, there are financial 
implications that could impact credit quality."

California Utilities' LossesOn Electricity Pose Risk

By REBECCA SMITH

Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL

California's two biggest utilities are losing so much
money buying electricity in the state's deregulated
market that they have run up deficits equivalent to half
their net worth in just four months.

If the cost of wholesale power continues to exceed the
price these utilities are allowed to bill their
customers, as currently seems likely, they could become
technically insolvent sometime next year. That would put
pressure on regulators to orchestrate a
multibillion-dollar public bailout, similar to the "too
big to fail'' response that in the past pushed
governments to rescue banks.

Such a scenario is quietly being discussed by bond-rating
concerns that recently reduced their credit outlooks for
Pacific Gas & Electric Co., a unit of San Francisco-based
PG&E Corp., and Southern California Edison, a unit of
Edison International of Rosemead, Calif. Bond- rating
concerns say they aren't sure how much additional debt
can be borne by the two affected utilities before they
will have difficulty paying their bills.

Probe of California Power Prices Begins, but New Plants
Aren't Seen as Solution (Sept. 11)

Los Angeles Utility Is Benefitting, Surprisingly, From
Deregulation (Sept. 6)

California Lawmakers Vote to Limit Electricity Costs
(Sept. 1)
"If this is just a seasonal aberration, the utilities can
get through it," says Lori Woodland, analyst for Fitch
IBCA. "If it goes on for six or nine months, it's a very
serious situation." Adds A.J. Sabatelle, senior credit
officer at Moody's Investors Service Inc.: "At some
point, you have a financial crisis."

The utilities say they are having no difficulty meeting
expenses and don't envision problems in servicing their
debts. But they are vigorously lobbying state and federal
regulators to change the rules of the game, hoping
somehow to raise rates to make up for the shortfall. The
California utilities' experience may be a harbinger of
what could happen in other states where wholesale power
prices have surpassed the amount that utilities are
allowed to charge their ratepayers.

For now, utilities are making ends meet by going to the
financial markets to borrow money. PG&E, a giant utility
that serves one out of every 20 Americans, is seeking
approval to increase its debt capacity by $1.4 billion.
It is borrowing $200 million, while Edison is tapping
$250 million from the commercial paper market. "This is
going to be a long, tough road," says Jim Scilacci, chief
financial officer for Southern California Edison.

Today's situation represents a complete turnabout from
what was expected when California deregulated its energy
market on March 31, 1998, which opened electricity
pricing to competition. California tried to give its
utilities a competitive edge nationally by deregulating
faster than other states and by creating a mechanism to
allow investor-owned utilities, such as PG&E and Edison,
to quickly pay down debts incurred to serve customers
under the old regulatory system.

To do this, the state legislature set retail rates at
high levels, which, at first, generated fat surpluses for
the utilities. As the money piled up, utilities used it
to pay down debts for generation facilities that were
otherwise unprofitable in the new deregulated world. By
the end of this June, PG&E and Edison together had
collected more than $12 billion and were on track to
finish paying down debts well ahead of the March 31,
2002, deadline set by the legislature. At that point,
rate freezes were to end and retail prices were to
fluctuate with the market.

But all that went out the window in June, when wholesale
power prices surged, topping the rates the utilities were
allowed to charge retail customers. Average prices at
state-sanctioned energy markets were four to five times
the prices of a year earlier, and three to four times the
level utilities could charge customers.

The accumulated shortfall has been so enormous at PG&E,
that analysts expect its deficit to exceed $3 billion by
Oct. 31, more than half its shareholder equity of $5.7
billion, which is defined as assets minus liabilities.
Southern California Edison finished August with a deficit
of $2 billion, equivalent to almost two-thirds its net
worth of $3.2 billion. The utilities, though they have
been accumulating deficits, aren't required to report
these as losses on their earnings statements.

That leaves utilities in a bind. They want to end the
rate freeze to be able to pass on the real cost of
electricity to consumers. But should the freeze end
before the statutory deadline of 2002, they get
clobbered. That is because they will immediately have to
book a loss on their power-purchase deficits. What's
more, they can't use the proceeds from planned
power-plant sales to cover those losses; instead, should
the freeze end, they will be obliged to refund some of
the proceeds to ratepayers. In PG&E's case, the refunds
could total $500 million, while in Edison's case, the
amount is $254 million.

Publicly at least, utility executives insist a mechanism
will be found to let them recoup the money spent on
electricity.

Consumer advocates are gearing up for the fight. Nettie
Hoge, executive director for San Francisco consumer group
Utility Reform Network, says ratepayers shouldn't end up
footing the bill for a deal cut by utilities that
benefited them before prices shot up.

Utility executives are now distancing themselves from the
legislation that got them into such a mess, which was
drafted with their assistance. PG&E Chairman Robert Glynn
says it is best not to "overanalyze" the "old deal."
Instead, he says, regulators and legislators should sit
down with utilities and construct a new agreement, since
"it's in the broad interests of the state not to have
critical energy infrastructure look like a leper."

Mr. Glynn says the current deal offers "mutually assured
destruction" to both utilities and ratepayers. Something
must be done, he says, or consumers throughout most of
the state will experience "a San Diego-style rate shock."
The utility serving that city, San Diego Gas & Electric
Co., ended its freeze a year ago and began passing
wholesale power costs directly through to ratepayers.
Legislators intervened this summer, however, and
temporarily capped retail rates when monthly power bills
nearly tripled. The utility, a unit of Sempra Energy, is
also accumulating a deficit as a result.

So long as banks and bond markets believe the utilities
will be repaid, they will be able to borrow, analysts
say. "Until we hear politicians of consequence state
otherwise, our position is that we believe the utilities
will be made whole," says Richard Cortright, a director
at Standard & Poor's corporate ratings group.

But that opinion could change if it looks like the
utilities will have to swallow a big loss. The result:
lower credit ratings that would raise borrowing costs and
could trigger a downward spiral. "You're talking about
top-rated companies, though," said Ms. Woodland of Fitch
IBCA. "To get to insolvency, a lot would have to happen."

In the meantime, utilities are doing all they can to
control the hemorrhaging. They have gotten authority from
regulators to buy more power under long-term contracts at
fixed prices, reducing their vulnerability to spot-market
volatility. And they have petitioned federal regulators
to declare California's market so badly flawed that
generators should be denied market pricing and, even,
ordered to pay refunds.

Nevertheless, several forces are working against them.
Although they can sign bilateral contracts, prices remain
high for those as well. What's more, they can't buy less
power than their customers need. If they don't buy
enough, the California Independent System Operator, the
organization responsible for reliability, will step in
and make purchases for them and send them the bill.

Perhaps the biggest problem facing PG&E and Edison,
though, is one of timing. The California legislature is
out of session until December, and regulators haven't
even really started to address the issue formally. In the
meantime, the utilities' deficit is growing by tens of
millions of dollars daily.

U.S. Panel Proposes Big Market Change
To Curb California's Electricity Prices

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission proposed sweeping changes in 
California's deregulated electricity market in a bid to push down high 
electricity prices. 
The proposed order, which will be open to industry and public comment before 
being implemented, comes as Californians are suffering record high power 
prices. The proposals go further than many industry watchers had expected but 
stop short of ordering that profits be seized from generators and refunded to 
consumers, as the state's utilities and many public officials had demanded. 
The move also marks the first time the federal government has intervened to 
make major changes in a state market since the era of electricity 
deregulation began four years ago. 
"California's market had become a threat to the health and financial 
well-being of the average citizen," said FERC Chairman James Hoecker. "We had 
to do something after the tsunami hit." 
The draft order proposes to cap wholesale electricity prices for two years at 
$150 per megawatt hour but to allow electricity-plant owners to receive 
higher prices, on a case-by-case basis, if they can demonstrate they deserve 
it. The cap in New York and New England, other deregulated markets, is $1,000 
per megawatt hour. The cap has been set higher there because competition in 
those markets has held down retail prices. 
The four-member commission, in authorizing the new "soft cap" for wholesale 
prices charged in California, dismissed a variable-price scheme adopted last 
week by the California Independent System Operator, the organization 
responsible for keeping enough electricity on hand to meet actual demand. 
That scheme, which now won't be implemented, would have capped prices at 
between $65 and $250 per megawatt hour, depending on demand. 
An important element in FERC 's new pricing plan is that it makes it less 
likely that a single generator will be able to effectively set the price that 
everyone receives, as has previously been the case. Under the old regime, 
even a small generator could ramp up prices for the entire spot market if it 
could position itself as the last unit called into service to meet demand. 
The commission came down hard in its interpretation of the high prices seen 
in the California market last summer. It said the wholesale prices paid to 
generators failed to satisfy the federal test that electricity rates be "just 
and reasonable." But Mr. Hoecker, FERC 's chairman, also said the commission 
had no authority to order profits seized from power generators and traders so 
that refunds could be made to those who paid the high prices. "We exercise 
such authority as Congress gives us," he said. "It's as simple as that." 
Mr. Hoecker acknowledged that FERC 's decision not to seek refunds would 
undoubtedly disappoint California regulators, utilities and consumer 
advocates. "They expected a lynching and . . . the disgorgement of ill-gotten 
gains," he said. 
FERC 's decision to not take action on refunds, at least for now, leaves the 
state of California with a major mess on its hands. Since June, wholesale 
power costs have exceeded the amount utilities were able to charge their 
customers by more than $5 billion. For now, utilities are footing the bill 
since customer rates are frozen and it is impossible to pass those costs 
along. But the utilities are lobbying state regulators for permission to dump 
the cost on consumers, offering to soften the blow somewhat by stretching out 
the collection period over four or five years. State regulators and 
legislators, without help from FERC to retrieve profits from generators and 
traders, now have an unpalatable choice: leave the burden on utilities or 
back-bill consumers who never asked for deregulation in the first place. 
While the FERC proposal does nothing to remedy the problem of past 
shortfalls, the commissioners said they were doing their utmost to push down 
prices in the future. FERC said it wants to eliminate a requirement that 
California's investor-owned utilities buy and sell all their power through 
state-sanctioned energy auctions -- regardless of the prices in those 
markets. That is the law now. This simple change would enable utilities that 
have sold most of their plants and buy power in the open market to hedge 
their price risk by signing contracts with a variety of suppliers. 
The commission also effectively issued a vote of no confidence to the 
governance structure used by the state's market-making organizations, the 
ISO, which operates the transmission system and runs a "balancing market" to 
keep energy supplies in sync with fluctuating demand, and the California 
Power Exchange, which runs a day-ahead market and a forward auction. 
Both organizations have large,unwieldy stakeholder boards consisting of 
representatives of different interest groups such as generators, utilities, 
large consumers and others and have been accused of putting the parochial 
interests of members ahead of the state's 35 million consumers. "They've 
become a debating society among interest groups," says Curt Hebert, one of 
the commissioners. 
FERC said it wants the boards of the ISO and the power exchange dissolved, 
most likely within 60 days. In their place, it wants smaller, disinterested 
boards such as those that exist in the East, where New York, New England and 
the mid-Atlantic states all have ISOs. It didn't, however, order the boards 
merged as some members had speculated might occur. 
Terry Winter, chief executive of the ISO, said he was an "avid supporter" of 
the stakeholder boards that looked like a worthy experiment in democracy 
"until all the heavy financial and political pressures caved in on them" last 
summer. This year alone, the ISO board changed price ceilings three times as 
different coalitions garnered the necessary votes, each time sending shock 
waves through the markets. 
In general, observers reacted positively to the FERC proposals, which will be 
the subject of a public hearing on Nov. 9. Generators were relieved there 
won't be refunds and were happy that the new "soft cap" system would allow 
price variation among generators with different costs. Steve Bergstrom, 
president of Dynegy Inc., which owns power plants in California, said he is 
pleased " FERC has shown it isn't going to stop deregulation." 
Utilities were pleased at the effort at cost containment and purchasing 
flexibility. But Mike Florio, an attorney for a San Francisco consumer group 
who sits on both the ISO and Power Exchange boards, said he finds it 
impossible to reconcile FERC 's conclusion that prices weren't fair with its 
reluctance to seize profits. "I thought `just and reasonable' rates were a 
requirement of the law, not just some guiding principle," he said.

U.S. Proposes Changes in Electricity Marketing in California

Citing the ''seriously flawed'' nature of the California electricity market, 
which was plagued with price spikes and brownouts this summer, the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission proposed changes yesterday in the sale and 
pricing of electricity intended to overhaul deregulation in the state. 
The commission's review was set off by widespread outrage after consumers in 
San Diego saw their electricity bills triple this summer. 
Once viewed as a pioneer in developing an efficient electricity market, 
California is now thought to embody the many problems that can arise from 
deregulation. States that are taking a go-slow approach to deregulation are 
sure to follow closely the changes proposed for California. 
Commission and industry analysts warned that the proposed measures, which 
would affect 85 percent to 90 percent of the California market, were but a 
first step to undoing the complicated knot of factors that led to high 
prices. They said the measures were not a guarantee that prices would be 
lower next summer. 
''Some people want, to use a psychobabble word, closure on all this,'' said 
Robert Michaels, a deregulation expert and professor of economics at 
California State University at Fullerton. ''But the California institutions 
are so complex that no one measure by F.E.R.C. will resolve it. The process 
will go on for a long time.'' 
The commission oversees the progress of deregulation across the country 
although states determine the specific conditions. The commission will accept 
commentary on the proposals and issue a binding order in December, a 
spokeswoman said. 
California electricity prices rocketed last summer largely because consumer 
demand for power outstripped supply. As a result, the commission warned, 
California officials will have to find ways to build more power plants and 
transmission lines. 
The commission's recommendations center on the sale of power through 
institutions set up as part of California's deregulation process. Many 
investor-owned utilities no longer generate power, but buy it on the 
wholesale market. Currently, utilities can buy and sell power only through 
the California Power Exchange, a state-run electricity marketplace. The 
commission has proposed eliminating that requirement so utilities can shop 
around for long-term electricity contracts, a move most analysts welcomed. 
''This gives us more flexibility to obtain affordable power for customers,'' 
said Shawn Cooper, a spokesman for the PG&E Corporation, the major utility in 
Northern California. ''Right now, we're limited on the energy product we can 
buy.'' 
Turning to the exchange, Mr. Cooper said, ''is like going to a car lot and 
being able to buy only one or two models.'' 
But experts said the other proposals might be easily thwarted by 
power-generating companies seeking top dollar. The commission proposed, for 
example, to lower the price cap for a megawatt hour to $150 from $250. Power 
suppliers that bid over $150 would be paid their price but would be required 
to explain the reasons for their bid. Such a system, some experts say, would 
prove a sizable loophole. 
James Bushnell, a research associate with the Energy Institute of the 
University of California, said, ''I think a clever engineer at any power 
company could come up with a whole bunch of reasons for whatever they want 
their costs to be.''

The Cutting Edge U.S. Urges Major Fixes for State's Power Market Energy: 
Federal panel says electricity crisis is product of flaws in deregulation,

California's electricity crisis is the product of flaws in the deregulated 
market and a long-term shortage of power in the state, federal regulators 
said Wednesday, proposing sweeping changes to fix the $23-billion electricity 
trade. 
But the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission stopped short of ordering 
retroactive reductions of the sky-high electricity prices paid since June, 
saying it lacked the legal authority. 
The commission, which found no evidence of individual companies driving up 
electricity prices, left the door open for some sort of refund should it 
uncover specific instances of such market abuses. That leaves undetermined 
whether major utilities can pass on more than $5 billion in electricity costs 
to consumers across the state. 
The technical changes proposed to fix California's flawed market include 
giving utilities freedom to buy power from sources other than the 
state-mandated exchange and imposing loose price caps on power purchases. 
Still, California faces years of high prices and threatened blackouts, the 
commission said, unless legislators and regulators tackle problems beyond the 
federal body's scope, particularly the faster building of power plants and 
transmission lines. 
"Ideally, some people would want us to round up the bad guys who manipulated 
this market without restraint or conscience and order disgorgement of all 
their ill-gotten gains. It's not as simple as that," Chairman James J. 
Hoecker said at a special meeting of the four-member commission. "If 
information that the market was or is being manipulated unlawfully comes to 
us through complaint or as product of our own investigation--we will act on 
that information, I guarantee you." 
The commission's menu of proposed changes to the California market, which it 
hopes to enact by the end of the year after public comment, drew scalding 
criticism from consumer groups, tepid praise from utilities and power 
generators, and a mixture of hot and cold responses from politicians. 
Nonetheless, observers expect the proposals will be approved in their current 
form. 
Some lauded the commission's proposed order for what it didn't do, mainly 
impose cost-based electric rates that would have represented a 
"re-regulation" of the industry. Generators breathed a sigh of relief that 
the commission--at least for the time being--did not judge the power 
merchants as having wielded illegal "market power," and therefore subject to 
refunds to the utilities and consumers they sold power to. 
And even consumer advocates, angry as they are, were comforted by the 
commission's finding that electricity rates at times this summer were "unjust 
and unreasonable," legal language that could open the way for the California 
Public Utilities Commission or the California Legislature to go after any 
profits they consider excessive. 
Gov. Gray Davis, during a news conference with U.S. Energy Secretary Bill 
Richardson to unveil initiatives to improve electricity supply and 
reliability, called the federal commission's proposal "a mixed blessing." 
"They do recognize that we're operating in a dysfunctional market and they do 
agree that rates are not just and reasonable," Davis said. "However, they did 
not, as I encouraged, order rebates to the consumers and businesses in San 
Diego who were literally gouged for the profiteering and market manipulation 
San Diego had to suffer through." 
Among the market changes proposed by the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission: 
* A temporary reworking for the next two years of the way prices are set for 
electricity in the California Power Exchange, the primary market for 
electricity. Currently, the highest bid for each hour sets the price for all 
the bids during that hour. The commission would change that policy so that 
bids higher than $150 a megawatt hour could not set the "market clearing 
price" paid by all participants. 
* Freeing the big utilities--Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas & 
Electric and San Diego Gas & Electric--from the requirement that they 
purchase most of their electricity from the Power Exchange. This would give 
the utilities greater freedom to shop for the best deals on electricity. 
* Requiring all market participants to schedule 95% of their transactions the 
day before rather than--as happened repeatedly this summer--waiting until the 
day the power is needed, buying at the last minute in an emergency market 
operated by the California Independent System Operator. This nonprofit was 
formed to schedule and transmit electricity, but found itself this summer in 
the unexpected position of running a major market for electricity as 
generators sought the best price for their electrons. 
* Overhauling the boards of governors of the California Power Exchange and 
the California Independent System Operator, which currently are composed of 
"stakeholders" representing all parties to deregulation, including 
generators, utilities and consumer advocates. Instead, the two nonprofit 
corporations would have smaller, independent boards selected by the current 
boards. 
(Customers of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, which is not 
participating in market deregulation and has escaped the state's power woes, 
are not affected by these proposals.) 
The commission based its proposals on a staff investigation that blamed high 
electricity prices on a supply-demand imbalance and market design problems 
that give electricity sellers the opportunity to drive up prices when 
supplies are tight. But the commission found no evidence of specific attempts 
by individual companies to drive up the price of electricity, partly because 
there was not enough time to conduct such a thorough, formal investigation. 
Curt Hebert Jr., the only Republican on the commission, offered the most 
criticism of the proposed order. 
"If it were up to me, today's order would be much, much different," Hebert 
said. "However, on balance, it appears to be a step in the right direction." 
Hebert said he could support the order only because it does not represent the 
final order and may be changed after the three-week public comment period. He 
said he would prefer that the order eliminate all price controls. 
California's two biggest utilities--Southern California Edison and Pacific 
Gas & Electric--commended the commission for its proposed fixes, calling them 
"a sound beginning." 
In particular, PG&E called the proposed reform of bidding "a creative attempt 
to fix the market and moderate prices, while still allowing competition to 
evolve." 
Power players praised FERC 's decision to allow utilities to go outside the 
PX to procure energy--a practice that a couple of years ago was deemed too 
risky because it might give the big utilities the temptation and impunity to 
self-deal: buying from their own affiliates. 
Although utilities have had limited power to make long-term energy contracts 
outside the PX, utilities have been reluctant to enter into them. That's 
because state regulators reserve the right to review such deals and to force 
companies and their shareholders to eat added costs if market rates decline 
below the contracts. 
Together, PG&E and Edison estimate that they have spent at least $5 billion 
more on electricity this summer than they could pass on to customers who are 
protected by a rate freeze imposed in 1996 as part of the deregulation law. 
The Public Utilities Commission is weighing the utilities' requests to 
eventually pass on those costs to customers. 
But consumer groups were outraged by the lack of rebates to customers of San 
Diego Gas & Electric, and, by extension, to the customers of SCE and PG&E, 
who currently are protected by a rate freeze but could face sharply higher 
bills if the utilities are allowed to pass along their uncollected 
electricity costs. 
"They are trying to give medicine for an incurable disease, and that's 
electricity deregulation," said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer 
and Consumer Rights. " FERC has found that rates were excessive, yet they 
failed to take action. That's like a judge that says we have all the evidence 
in the world that this guy committed murder, but it's all inadmissible." 
Mike Florio, a lawyer with the San Francisco-based consumer group called the 
Utility Reform Network and a member of the Cal-ISO board, said the commission 
took a step backward by nullifying Cal-ISO's recent decision to set a sliding 
rate cap of as low as $100 per megawatt hour. The commission ordered that the 
price cap in the Cal-ISO market remain at $250 a megawatt hour until the new 
FERC pricing mechanism is finalized. 
"I wasn't one of those that thought FERC was going to ride in on a white 
horse and rescue us, but this appears to have made things worse," Florio 
said. 
San Diego County Supervisor Bill Horn said that county attorneys would review 
the FERC order to assess the county's options for pursuing rebates. 
"We're proceeding on our own," he said. On Tuesday, supervisors voted to 
study creating a municipal utility district.

A scathing AP article against Governor Davis concerning his inaction with the 
California crisis. Davis is facing two issues. Sign the current rollback bill 
that is going through the legislature and upset the energy industry, or veto 
the bill and have many voters upset at him. Governor Davis is aware of the 
upcoming elections for members in his party, as well as the 2002 governor 
election and knows that his decision may cost himself and other members of 
his party election wins. Also, there is now talks that during August 21st PUC 
meeting the governor will suggest rate rollback for San Diego  to July 1998 
rates. This is a complete 180 degree turn from his August 3rd PUC meeting 
where he said he would steer clear of rate rollbacks or freezes and push for 
only a rebate.


Attached is a personal interest type story providing the general publics view 
of the whole California power situation.

Long-Term Power Contracts Present Dilemma for Utilities Energy: They see 
risks in proposals by electricity- generating firms if wholesale rates were 
to drop significantly.

California electricity users just can't seem to buy a break. 
After a summer of sky-high wholesale prices that briefly socked the bill to 
consumers in San Diego, various power marketers have come forward with a deal 
for the state's big utilities: Sign long-term contracts for electricity, at 
one-third to one-half current prices, and everybody goes home happy. 
But utilities and independent power generators have yet to sign such 
bilateral contracts despite industry assurances that the deals could offer a 
way out of the state's continuing electricity crisis. 
The aversion of utilities to the contracts' risks, regulatory uncertainty and 
the unsettled energy market overall are cited as causing the stalemate. In 
any case, the standoff is yet another sign that the deregulated California 
electricity market isn't working as expected, with residents, small 
businesses and utility shareholders the ultimate losers. 
Power merchants, which complain that they have been cast as heavies and as 
market manipulators during the summer-long electricity crunch, say the 
contracts they have offered to utilities illustrate how they are putting 
"solutions on the table," as one executive put it, that so far have not been 
picked up. 
Southern California Edison, a unit of Edison International, and PG&E Corp.'s 
Pacific Gas & Electric received permission from regulators last month to sign 
long-term contracts to buy energy directly from generators and bypass the 
California Power Exchange, where wholesale prices soared this summer on 
higher-than-expected demand and generation shortages throughout the West. 
San Diego Gas & Electric, a unit of Sempra Energy, got a green light to sign 
such bilateral "forward" contracts last week. The utility's 1.2 million 
customers suffered through a summer of doubled and tripled bills before price 
caps were enacted last month; retail prices in Edison and PG&E territory 
remain frozen under terms of the state's landmark 1996 regulation bill. 
Those limits on rates have saddled the utilities with $5 billion in 
uncollectable costs--the difference between the skyrocketing wholesale rates 
and the prices they can pass along to consumers. Doubts surrounding whether 
the utilities will recoup any of that growing deficit is causing increased 
nervousness on Wall Street. 
On Wednesday, Edison International shares plunged $3.19, or 14%, to $19.88 on 
the New York Stock Exchange in heavy trading, as investors focused on the 
risks the company faces in borrowing to cover power costs. The stock now has 
slumped 24% from its recent high. 
PG&E Corp. slid $1.92 to $25.39 on Wednesday, extending its loss to 20% from 
its recent high, also on concerns about its borrowing needs. 
After the state's Public Utilities Commission authorized bilateral contracts, 
power merchants including Duke Energy Corp., Reliant Energy Inc. and Dynegy 
Inc. came forward, offering to supply power to the utilities at fractions of 
the going wholesale rate. 
The power merchants have been touting energy as cheap as $50 per 
megawatt-hour in contracts spread over one to five years. That would seem to 
offer big savings over the average Power Exchange electricity price so far 
this month of $122 per megawatt-hour and the $166 average for 
August--dramatic spikes upward from the $40 average of August 1999. 
Why, then, have no deals been cut? 
Edison and SDG&E say that the Public Utilities Commission's right of review 
would create huge potential liabilities for their shareholders if wholesale 
electricity prices were to fall. 
The risk is that prices on the Power Exchange could drop significantly 18 to 
24 months from now, when added generation capacity coming online in 
California should ease shortages. That could leave utilities paying more 
under contracts than on the open market. 
"The PUC could look at the transactions, find them to be imprudent, say the 
difference between the contract price and Power Exchange price was the cost 
of our actions, and then try to recover the difference from shareholders," 
said Kevin Cini, Southern California Edison's manager of energy supply and 
marketing. 
The PUC could possibly take such action any time the contract price turns out 
to be more than a 5% "safe harbor band" above the average Power Exchange 
wholesale price over the life of the contract. "We think the safe harbor 
should be 20%," Cini said. 
A source at the PUC--some of whose members have been against bilateral 
contracts on grounds they distort the workings of the Power Exchange--said 
the utilities want a "blank check" to make deals and bypass the commission's 
mandated oversight role in setting retail electricity rates. 
"The utilities don't want any constraints on what they can do," said a PUC 
administrative source who asked not to be identified. "They don't want the 
PUC to take a retroactive review and say this was unreasonable and disallow 
some costs, nor do they want pre-approval and be subjected to review." 
Industry observers say that the PUC's right to review all contracts longer 
than two years hamstrings the utilities' ability to hedge their risks in the 
volatile state energy market. 
"The utilities can judge the risks. What we need is the PUC to allow the 
utilities to enter into these deals without the second chance of looking at 
them," said Greg Blue, senior director of Dynegy, a Houston-based power 
merchant that owns several power plants in Southern California. 
Regulators and consumer advocates, meanwhile, are concerned that allowing the 
utilities to sign contracts for supply represents a merchant role they 
relinquished under deregulation. 
Mike Florio of the Utility Reform Network, a San Francisco-based consumer 
watchdog, said the utilities could someday lose some of their retail customer 
base, "leaving the remaining customers to pay contracts costing more than 
what was available on the spot market." 
Stanford professor Blake Johnson believes the California wholesale market 
will one day "settle out" as a mixture of short-term contracts on the Power 
Exchange and long-term bilateral deals. Until then, he said, he can see the 
risks on both sides of the issue. 
"When the house is on fire," he said, "it's not the right time to buy the 
insurance policy."

Here's my stab at organizing the tremendous amount of material everyone has 
gathered these past few days.

The biggest points are in the biggest bold type.
The subsidiary points are in smaller bold type.
The substantial is in regular type.

Please send me your feedback.

I have some questions and coments.

WHY DOES ENRON FEEL THE NEED TO FILE SEPARATELY? We can't we file with ARM?

WHY DO WE WANT THE DISCUSSION NARROWED TO SDG&E ONLY?  I can see pros and 
cons of each way.

I DO NOT SEE HOW WE CAN SUPPORT PRICE CAPS.....If we could not support them 
on the wholesale side, how can we support them on the retail side?  Doesn't 
it kill the ESP business?  Doesn't it eliminate any benefits of dereulation?  
If we support them, we are givibng in to the unjustified terrorism that is 
taking place in CA.  We don't even now whrer the monry is coming from.  What 
if they expect to get it from us.  Hey, can we sue -- we can't if we SUPPORT 
price caps.

WE MUST STICK WITH THE PRINCIPLES WE'VE FOUGHT FOR ALL THESE YEARS -- SOME 
THINGS ARE JUST  WORTH FIGHTNG FOR.
I recommend opposition of the price caps -- the resukt of the knee=jerk, 
weekly about -face by the CPUC which cannot possibly be considered to be 
reasoned decision making

Unless we receive comments by 9 a.m. p.d.t. Monday, August 14, this will be 
Enron's pre-hearing conference comments relative to the Investigation opened 
by the Commission.  These comments will be filed Monday.  Please make sure 
Bruno is copied on your comments.

NOTE:  

Rather than opposing a cap for small consumers, which I believe is imminent, 
I would prefer to advocate that it apply only to small consumers, under 20 
kW, and only for a limited period of time.  I would prefer to argue that the 
cap should not apply to larger consumers, who  already have access to market 
solutions to insulate them from market volatility.

PLEASE LET ME KNOW ASAP IF WE CANNOT SUPPORT THIS POSITION.

Dan, only one addition to PHC.  Will advise on filing.

Subject: FERC Presentation on California/West Wholesale Market

Last Thursday, I made the first attached presentation to the FERC Staff at 
the power marketer's meeting on the FERC's investigation of the wholesale 
market in the West (and in particular California).  Ellen Wolf (of Tabors 
Caramanis) and I created this presentation building on previous presentations 
by Tim Belden and Dave Parquet.  In the presentation and the meeting we made 
the following points:
There isn't much FERC can do because the cause of the price spikes is not in 
the wholesale market.  We discouraged FERC from taking any action that would 
hurt the vibrant wholesale market in the California and the rest of the West 
as well.
High prices logically resulted from scarcity and if the Commission does 
anything it should (1) investigate whether market power was being exercised 
by any party and, (2) if necessary to protect the market (while still 
incenting needed generation) establish a price cap at a scarcity rent level 
equal to the price at which loads were willing to interrupt.  
The IOUs have not properly prepared for the risk of high prices caused by 
scarcity.  They have failed to hedge and have underscheduled their load, 
therefore having to fill a large percentage of their load at ISO real time 
prices.  My analogy was that this was like day trading your retirement fund 
as an asset allocation scheme.
The market would function better if more information was provided to the 
market.
The Commission should do whatever it can to incent participation by load.
To see the presentation, detach, save, and view in Powerpoint.  When you do, 
you will find there are many "hidden" slides that were not part of the oral 
presentation but were provided to Staff in hard copy for additional 
information.

According to the head of the investigation (Scott Miller), the staff got alot 
more out of this meeting than Staff's previous meetings with the IOUs and the 
generators.  Based on the numerous phone calls I've been getting, the Staff 
is looking into the data we provided.  

I have also attached a revised version of the presentation that Tim sent to 
Scott Miller on Friday.  Tim's version conveys the same message but takes a 
different approach to conveying the message.  On Friday, Tim talked to Scott 
and answered some additional questions.  Tim said that Enron is in favor of 
eliminating the mandatory PX buying requirement and would like the IOUs to be 
able to buy from Enron Online.  He also explained more fully the existence of 
scarcity .

Clarifications:

SDG&E's Bill cap is as follows

Residential: $68 per mouth through 1/1/01 and $75 per mouth through 12/31/01 
for those who consume 500kWh per month or less - market prices for the others 
residential.
Commercial: $220 per mouth through 1/1/01 and $240 per mouth through 12/31/01 
for those who consume 1500 kWh per month or less - market place for other 
commercial
The decision intends to allow for future adjustment of the kWh monthly 
consumption for bill caps retroactive to June 1, 200 to ensure that customers 
in hotter inland regions have an appropriate level of usage cap and medium 
size commercial customers are provided relief.

Subject: SDG&E Rate Cap

Duque's Decision passed 3-2 (Duque, Neeper, Bilas - Lynch, Wood) - Both 
Neeper and Bilas said that they were only voting for this decision because of 
pressure. They both felt that last meeting's decision provided sufficient 
relief and provided for a investigation to address longer term problems.

Summary: 

The Decision institutes a rate stabilization for residential and commercial 
customers
 Residential: $68 through 1/1/01 and $75 through 12/31/01 for those who 
consume 500kW or less - market prices for the others residential 
 Commercial: $220 through 1/1/01 and $240 through 12/31/01 for those who 
consume 1500 kW or less - market place for other commercial

Other rate schedules: Subject to market prices

Implementation date: Retroactive to 6/1/00 - SDG&E will provide a credit for 
those customers that are eligible no latter than September 30th

The decision intends to allow for future adjustment of the kWh rate caps 
retroactive to June 1, 200 to ensure that customers in hotter inland regions 
have an appropriate level of usage cap and medium size commercial customers 
are provided relief.

The bill stabilization plan requires SDG&E to file comments, by September 30, 
addressing the implementation and transition of a Levelized Payment Plan 
(LPP) for all customers on an "opt out" basis. However, the procedure for the 
implementation of the LLP will allow customers to readily exercise choice, 
while those that do not exercise choice will default into the LPP.

The Commission will also further study the bill stabilization plan as to 
direct access customers. 

Revenue shortfalls are to be booked into the TCBA for future recovery of the 
net shortfall. 

Discussion: 
Senator Alpert, Assembly Women Davis, Mayor Golding , the former mayor, 
several members of the City and County of San Diego Board of Supervisors made 
a public appearance. All thanked the Commission for  having this special 
session. All supported the Wood decision. All stated that it did not  go far 
enough and insisted that all customers should be subject to the cap. Assembly 
Women Davis stated that she would be going back to the legislation  to pass 
the Davis/Alpert Bill establishing a cap for all customers. However, 
Asseblymember Wright, chairman of the Utilities and Commerce Committee, has 
been open and has shown opposition to the Alpert/Davis bill.

-- *DJ FERC Finds No Abuse Of Calif Elec Mkt Pwr -Commissioner --

-- *DJ FERC Won't Order Refunds By Generators - Commissioner --

-- DJ FERC/Calif -2: Report Blames Calif Market Structure --

  LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
investigation into California's wholesale energy market has found no abuse
of
market power by generators this past summer and the agency won't order
generators to refund billions of dollars in excessive revenue to consumers
or
utilities, a FERC commissioner told Dow Jones Newswires.
  The FERC commissioner said generators weren't solely to blame for
California's
summer of soaring power prices, but said constraints within the market
structure, such as "hedging" restrictions imposed by state regulators -
utilities' limited ability to purchase power in the forward market -
resulted in
higher prices.
  The FERC commissioner said market power did occur but generators weren't
purposely manipulating the market in order to make more money so refunds
will
not be ordered.

 DJ FERC/Calif -3: `Sweeping' Changes Planned For Cal-ISO,PX --

  Market power is a term used to describe how generators can influence
power
prices by controlling electricity supply during tight demand periods.
  As reported, FERC announced last week that it had received the results of
an
eagerly anticipated staff investigation of market conditions that sent
power
costs in California soaring over the summer.
  The agency scheduled an extraordinary meeting for Nov. 1, at which it
plans to
vote on proposed remedies based on the report's findings.
  California experienced a summer of soaring wholesale power prices that
led
to
landmark state Legislation to cap wholesale prices for retail customers in
San
Diego, where most of the price shocks were felt.
  In addition, sweeping changes within the state's Power Exchange and
Independent System Operator will be proposed, the commissioner said, citing
the
report.
  The FERC report also said it was a bad idea to force utilities to
purchase
power exclusively from one exchange with limited products, and various
price
cap
proposals that were passed by the ISO recently exacerbated the price
situation,
according to the commissioner.
  A FERC spokeswoman contacted by Dow Jones Newswires Friday said the
agency
wouldn't comment on what or what's not in the report.

California regulators cut San Diego electricity rates in close vote
MICHAEL LIEDTKE, AP Business Writer


   (08-21) 16:28 PDT SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- With consumers howling about
unexpectedly high electric bills this summer, California's Public Utility
Commission took a step back from deregulation and cut rates for most San
Diego residents by 43 percent, so that most customers will pay no more
than $68 per month through January.
   By a 3-2 margin, the commission also approved a rate cut for small
businesses and school districts, resulting in estimated bills of $220 a
month for customers that don't exceed strict usage limits of 1,500
kilowatt hours.
   "This isn't going to help anybody," muttered San Diego restaurateur Susan
Bauman as she waved a $10,284 electricity bill showing one of her two
businesses used 30,000 kilowatt hours in July.
   PUC Commissioner Henry Duque, who drafted the proposal, said it provides
some relief while encouraging energy conservation, since customers who
exceed the usage limits will have to continue paying market rates.
   Other San Diegans who attended the hearing called the action woefully
inadequate.
   "We are bleeding to death and this will not stop the hemorrhaging," said
San Diego Supervisor Dianne Jacob. "We are going to die unless we get more
help."
   The PUC rejected an alternative proposal that would have imposed price
controls through 2003 and lowered bills by 60 percent from current levels.
   Ed Guiles, CEO of San Diego Gas & Electric Co., said the alternative would
have accumulated hundreds of millions of dollars in deferred costs. With
interest, those costs ultimately would be passed on to customers beginning
in 2004.
   But even the measure that did pass could end up costing San Diego
customers as much as $100 million after 2001, Guiles said.
   "This is an interim solution that stabilizes the bills for consumers but
does not get to the root part of the problem of high energy prices,"
Guiles said.
   Consumer advocates say customers should not be forced to pay for the
higher rates, now or in the future.
   "The proposals are really just a ruse. They move the burden from the
consumers' checkbook to their credit cards to be paid at a future date,"
said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, a
Santa Monica watchdog.
   The deregulation of the state's $20 billion electrical power industry --
imposed under a complex 1996 law that phases in the effects from south to
north -- was supposed to lower prices by creating greater competition.
   But demand has outstripped electricity supplies, due to a growing
population, booming high-tech economy, and less electricity available from
neighboring states that haven't deregulated their systems.
   A sweltering summer in much of California hasn't helped, and cost hikes
and continuing power shortages that caused rolling "brownouts" in the San
Francisco Bay area in June have spurred demands of a repeal.
   Monday's action came at an emergency meeting called at the request of Gov.
Gray Davis, who asked the commission to lower soaring electric bills that
have sparked outrage in California's second largest city -- and fears in
other California regions due to buy electricity on the open market as
early as next year.
   Residential and business customers who receive their power from SDG&E have
seen their electric bills double or even quadruple since their rates were
deregulated in June.
   Jacob and other San Diego-area politicians on hand at San Francisco's
hearings said they were headed to Sacramento to lobby for a state law
proposing to revert rates to 1996 prices. The proposal doesn't specify who
would pay for the rollback.
   Other critics said the PUC's rate limits won't help elderly and sick
people who must run their air conditioning during the hot summer months.
Opponents also warned that small businesses still might have to lay off
employees or move from the area to offset their rising expenses.
   "What we have done is lower the rates for turning on your TV or running
your refrigerator, but basically what we're telling people is, don't turn
on your air conditioner," said PUC Commissioner Carl Wood, who wanted the
steeper rate cut that failed Monday.
   The cap adopted Monday applies to residential customers who limit usage to
500 kilowatts per month. About 70 percent of homes in San Diego fall under
the cap, estimated Duque.
   The prevailing market rate has soared under deregulation.
   On August 13, the average wholesale price for San Diego electricity was
$117 per megawatt hour, up from $25 per megawatt hour at a comparable time
last year, said Wood.
   The estimated $68 cap for residential customers will remain in effect
through January 2001 and then increase to a projected $75 cap through
December 2001.
   The projected $220 cap on electric bills that applies to businesses and
school districts will increase to $240 per month after January.
   Under deregulation, private utilities were required to sell off their
power plants and open their markets to electrical resellers, and buy power
on the open market, paying an amount that may fluctuate from day to day.
   But the state has been shunned by some power developers who are uncertain
about deregulation, and few new power plants are in the works.

Jacque Reid, anchor:
To save money, consumers are finding ways to cut down on costly electricity
bills.  Greg Clarking reports on how to get better rates using the Internet.
Greg Clarking reporting:
Helene Baldizzone, a New York City artist, was growing increasingly
concerned about rising electricity costs, so she signed up with start-up
electricity retailer SmartEnergy.com.
Helene Baldizzone (SmartEnergy.com Customer):  I thought, OK, well, let's
try somebody else because the bills had been going up little by little every
month with ConEdison.  So I thought, well, I have nothing to lose at this
point.
Clarking:  Baldizzone is happy with SmartEnergy where she has locked in a
rate of 8.3 cents per kilowatt hour.  She was paying as much as 13.3 cents
per kilowatt hour before switching.  SmartEnergy says its goal is to let
consumers take advantage of the sometimes confusing options created by
deregulation of the energy industry.
Gautam Chandra (President/CEO, SmartEnergy.com):  What we are doing is
taking that confusion away by being the agents for the customer in terms of
looking at the best prices, locking in the best prices for them.
Clarking:  SmartEnergy, currently available in New York City, will be
available in all twenty-four deregulated states within the next few months.
There are a number of electricity suppliers in each of the deregulated
states and consumers can save a lot of money by doing a little research.
Rick Cowles (Energyland.com):  Don't sit back and just hang in there and
wait and see what's going to happen a year or two down the road because
you're going to find that electric rates have definitely changed in a year
or two and it may not be to your advantage.
Clarking:  To find out what energy options are available in your area, you
can call your state's public utility commission or click on to
Energyland.com for a complete list of energy suppliers and their rates.
Cowles:  Right now, consumers are kind of in a unique position where they do
have the ability to go in and see some immediate savings.
Baldizzone:  It's easy.  But I like especially saving the money.  It's
better in my pocket.
Clarking:  That's Your Money.  Greg Clarking, CNN, New York.

The following summarizes recent price cap events in California.  I think that 
I have most of it right.  If there is anything wrong or missing please let me 
know.  Please don't share the attached spreadsheet with anyone outside of 
Enron.

Regards,
Tim

New Cap Specifics
On 10/26/2000 the ISO Board passed a motion by a vote of 13-10 to implement a 
new price cap methodology.
The new methodology will become effective 11/3/2000 or as soon thereafter as 
can be implemented.  CAISO staff has indicated that it will be difficult to 
achieve that start date.  They have not yet indicated what an achievable date 
might be.
The new price cap methodology will remain in place until:
Comprehensive market changes have been implemented and the market has proven 
to be workably competitive under a variety of load conditions.
Either FERC or the ISO board orders its removal.
Cap prices will be based on the average NYMEX L3D settlement average and the 
following heat rate table:
  Load Level  Heat Rate  4.00 Gas Example Cap
  <25 GW   10,775   $43.10
  25 GW to 30 GW 14,175   $56.70
  30GW to 35 GW  17,225   $68.90
  35GW to 40 GW  27,225   $108.90
  >40 GW   $250/MWh  $250/MWh
Caps will be rounded up to the nearest $5/MWh increment.
Demand bids and demand responsiveness programs are exempt from these caps.
The ISO will post the price caps for each load level at least 48 hours prior 
to the beginning of each calendar month.  Based on the ISO's two day-ahead 
system load forecast, the ISO will post hourly caps at least 24 hours prior 
to the hour of delivery.

FERC Context
FERC has delegated cap authority to the CAISO until 11/15/2000.
The ISO has asserted that they don't need FERC authority since it is a bid 
cap rather than a sales cap.  FERC regulates sales, not purchases, of 
electricity and therefore can regulate sales prices but not purchase prices.
The ISO has filed with FERC for an extension of the price cap authority.  
FERC has to rule on the filing by 11/18/2000.  (Note that this is 3 days 
after their authority expires)
FERC will release its proposed order on 11/1/2000 based on the results of its 
206 investigation of the California wholesale power markets.  We don't know 
what they will find or what they will propose.
The proposed order will have a 30 day comment period, after which FERC will 
likely issue a final order.  FERC will be accepting oral comments on 
11/9/2000 in Washington.  Enron still has to determine who will provide oral 
comments.
Many companies have filed at FERC advocating or opposing a litany of price 
caps, cost based rates, and market redesign recommendations.
It is likely that the price caps approved by the ISO board will go into 
effect.  How long they will remain in effect will depend on whether FERC 
extends the ISO price cap authority and whether the final order stemming from 
the current 206 investigation stipulates a specific price cap policy.

Impact of Price Caps
The attached spreadsheet contains a table of likely maximum monthly prices at 
different gas price levels.  We think that this is the highest that markets 
would clear since it assumes that each hour clears at the cap.  It is hard to 
say whether actual prices would clear significantly lower than the cap 
because we don't know whether sellers will offer below the cap or at the 
cap.  The assumptions behind our analysis are detailed in the bullets below.
Take actual historical loads from 1999 and 2000.   
Calculate implied price cap for each hour using actual historical load, new 
price cap methodology, and a range of gas prices.
Divide historical hours into peak and off-peak buckets.
Calculate average price for each month for peak hours and off-peak hours.  
For example, we have two years worth of data for the months of January 
through September.  Each month has approximately 400 hours.  for January 
through September, we took approximately 800 observations for each month (400 
from each year) and calculated a simple average of all of the individual 
observations.
We created a peak table and an off-peak table.  The table shows the 
calculated implied cap based off of the acutal loads at varying gas prices 
for each month.  This value represents what the month would clear at if each 
hour cleared at the cap (based on historic loads).  While any given hour 
could be above this value, our calculation estimates the likely monthly 
average cap value!
The blue shading indicates what the caps would be given current (10/27/2000 
NYMEX) forward prices.  The yellow shading indicates those forward power 
prices which are in excess of the proposed cap.

F.Y.I.

                              
  California Lawmakers Vote to Limit Power Costs 
  By Rebecca Smith 
    
  09/01/2000 
  The Wall Street Journal 
  Page A4

  California lawmakers voted to extend modest relief to San Diego residents 
burdened with
  high electricity bills and set the groundwork for faster construction of 
badly needed power
  plants. They stopped short, however, of passing legislation that would roll 
back retail power
  rates to levels seen prior to deregulation .

  Late Wednesday, lawmakers sent a bill to Gov. Gray Davis that limits to 6.5 
cents per
  kilowatt hour the amount that small customers of San Diego Gas & Electric 
Co. can be
  charged. The utility is allowed to add power-delivery and other reasonable 
costs to that
  commodity price.

  The price, equivalent to a bulk power cost of $65 per megawatt hour, is far 
higher than the
  average price of power for 27 of the 31 months in which California's market 
has been
  deregulated. But in June and July, the average price of power obtained by 
the utility from a
  state-sanctioned energy auction rose to 12 cents and 10.5 cents, 
respectively, compared
  with the 2.3 cents and 2.8 cents charged in those months a year earlier.

  Passed directly through to customers,the resulting bills sparked a near 
mutiny. The
  rate-cap measure applies to residential and small commercial customers, as 
well as to
  schools and hospitals.

  In addition to the rate cap, which can be adjusted upward or downward by 
the California
  Public Utilities Commission until December 2002, the legislature earmarked 
$150 million of
  general-fund revenue, which can be used to subsidize San Diego power costs 
if they greatly
  exceed the 6.5-cents-per-kilowatt-hour rate. For now, the utility would be 
expected to make
  up any difference between revenue collected and the actual cost.

  Steve Baum, chairman of Sempra Energy, parent of San Diego Gas & Electric 
Co., said the
  rate-cap measure is "deeply flawed" because it limits the amount prices can 
rise but sets
  no floor. That means any shortfall could grow -- without a mechanism for 
customers to pay
  it down -- until the end of the rate-cap period, which could last until 
December 2002 or
  December 2003.

  Mr. Baum said Sempra stands to suffer an undercollection of perhaps $664 
million, provided
  future prices approximate the New York Mercantile Exchange forward prices 
through
  December 2002. "It's irreparably damaging to Sempra," he said because it 
"creates
  tremendous uncertainty" that makes it hard for the San Diego energy company 
to finance
  new projects such as a new transmission line.

  The legislature also appeared likely to approve a bill speeding up the 
permit process for the
  construction of new power plants, in part by beefing up staffs of 
regulatory agencies that
  review the plans.

CalPX:High Summer Pwr Prices Mostly From Fundamentals
By Mark Golden
  
10/04/2000 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- High electricity prices this summer in California were 
the result of market fundamentals and structure, rather than market 
manipulation by particular participants, according to a preliminary report by 
the California Power Exchange. 
Rising demand in the state and in the western U.S. overall combined with a 
lack of new generators to push wholesale prices to levels about three times 
as high as prices last summer, according to the preliminary report obtained 
by Dow Jones Newswires. 
And the price rise was predictable, according to the report. 
Citing hot weather from May to July in California and the Southwest, lower 
hydroelectric supplies in the Northwest, higher natural gas prices, higher 
prices for nitrogen oxide emission allowances, the report says that "reserve 
margins during peak hours in May and June in the Western Systems Coordinating 
Council region dropped to a thin 4% to 6%, compared to the forecast 17% to 
20%." 
"Price movements in California and the WSCC are consistent with analysis by 
Cambridge Energy Research Associates, which has demonstrated a high 
correlation between low capacity reserve margins and high spot prices in 
other regions of the U.S.," the report says. 
While the CalPX recommends changes to its market rules, it says that prices 
were sometimes higher in other parts of the western U.S. than in California 
this summer, further evidence of a genuine market imbalance between supply 
and demand. 
The CalPX market flaws, however, "provided incentives to suppliers to 
speculate on receiving higher prices in the Real-Time and Ancillary Services 
markets (which are operated by the California Independent System Operator) by 
moving their supply to those markets, leaving less supply in the CalPX 
Day-Ahead market. These design flaws need to be addressed," the report says. 
Although suppliers had incentives to move power to the highest-priced 
markets, the CalPX found no "consistent pattern by individual participants or 
participant category. As a result, it is difficult to single out any one 
group as the force driving prices." 
CalPX will send the final report to various bodies investigating the 
California wholesale electricity market, including the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission, the California Public Utilities Commission, the 
California Attorney General, the California Electricity Oversight Board and 
the state legislature. 
Its findings may not sit well politically with some of those bodies, 
according to one source. California utilities, Gov. Gray Davis, and various 
legislators and regulators have been blaming independent power generators - 
"out-of-state" companies that bought big generating stations from the 
utilities over the past three years - for market manipulation and price 
gouging. Those groups hope to build a case with the FERC that would force 
suppliers to refund some of their big gains this summer back to California's 
utilities and to the customers in the San Diego area, who have received high 
electric bills. 
Instead, the CalPX's preliminary report proposes corrections that are 
relatively modest, such as increasing demand responsiveness, removing 
barriers to new generation, proportionally allocating out-of-market purchase 
costs to the utilities that underscheduled power purchases and encouraging 
utilities to buy more power in the forward market. 
As ordered by state legislation to deregulate the electric utility industry 
in California, the regulated utility units of PG&E Corp (PCG), Edison 
International (EIX) and Sempra Energy (SRE) purchase the power they need one 
day in advance through the CalPX and make any last-minute purchases through 
the California ISO.

Attached are more articles that speak of the current California power crisis.

Mercury News Article primarily dealing with Governor Davis' view on the 
situation and what he is doing to help solve the issue. Davis has a three 
part plan: investigate price gouging, ask PUC to set up two-year plan to cut 
rates in half and asked for voluntary conservation. 

Asking Clinton to speed up a federal probe of apparent electricity 
price-gouging by out-of-state power producers and called on state regulators; 
A spokesman for the independent energy producers said his group welcomed a 
federal investigation, saying it would determine that ``California simply 
does not have enough generating and transmission capacity.'' 
To stabilize skyrocketing utility bills in San Diego; Davis called upon the 
Public Utilities Commission on Wednesday to set up a two-year plan to cut 
rates nearly in half for residential and business customers of San Diego Gas 
& Electric.  Davis described his proposal as ``a rate-stabilization plan'' 
designed to lower bills. ;Nettie Hoge, executive director of The Utility 
Reform Network, a consumer group, criticized Davis' plan. She said consumer 
groups want the Legislature to freeze rates in San Diego at July 1999 levels. 
Volunary actions: Davis joined with grocers to announce a voluntary program 
to conserve power on extremely hot days, meaning lights in Bay Area 
supermarkets would be dimmed and air conditioning dials set higher to cut 
power use by 10 percent. 
Davis contends that deregulation will work out, perhaps in three or four 
years, when a dozen or more power plants in the pipeline start generating 
electricity. 



Mercury News article states it is not time to re-regulate the markets and 
provides the following solutions to solve the crisis.
Matters will improve when California has: 
-> More sources of power. 
-> A more sophisticated electricity market. 
-> Smarter consumers -- that is, consumers with the information they need to 
be thrifty. 
Also the article talks of the Power Exchange (PX) and the Independent System 
Operators (ISO) and how these two groups are making the prices higher; i.e 
market imperfections that result from the uniqueness of electricity as a 
commodity and the immaturity of the new exchanges are enabling producers to 
obtain higher prices than the underlying conditions dictate. 
Article concludes by saying the deregulated market is just beginning and with 
a few adjustments will work out fine


Mercury News article speaking of a new report commissioned by Governor Davis 
on the energy crisis. The article is primarily about the following issues.
A report commissioned by Gov. Gray Davis concluded that deregulation is ``not 
working,'' and recommended a series of actions, including asking the federal 
government to help control prices. 
The report was written by the president of the California Public Utilities 
Commission and the chairman of the California Electricity Oversight Board and 
made 30 recommendations to help ease the threat of power shortages and price 
spikes. 
Report suggested that  the state-mandated freeze on utility rates, which is 
tentatively in place for PG&E customers through March 2002, might need to be 
extended further. 
The report also suggested the upgrading power transmission lines into San 
Francisco and  hooking up businesses to a central command center via the 
Internet, so their lobby lights and air conditioning could be turned off 
automatically when state power supplies were low. 
Two key state agencies, the Independent System Operator and the Power 
Exchange, were criticized in the report. It accused the ISO and the Power 
Exchangeof being unresponsive to the needs of consumers, in part because 
their boards include people with ties to power companies. It also complained 
that they did not provide key pricing and other data requested by the 
report's authors to assess the state's energy problems.
Also in the article is a repsonse by the ISO and PX to the claims made in the 
governor's report.

Wattage Monitor is a service that helps electricity customers find a 
competitive electric supplier to help lower their bills. To SDG&E customers, 
they are offering a choice of 14 companies to buy their electric power.

Wattage Monitor Service Teams Help Lower Electric Bills 

SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 21 /PRNewswire/ -- As summer temperatures continue to
heat up and electricity prices do the same, Wattage Monitor Inc.
(OTC Bulletin Board: WMON) offers consumers an escape by locating a
competitive supplier that can lower their bills.
    Customers of San Diego Gas & Electric can choose to buy electric power
from 14 other companies besides their regulated utility.  Most of these
competing companies allow Wattage Monitor system users to switch to their
service automatically.  And there are savings to be had.  In some cases
competing suppliers are offering as much as $120 per year in savings or more.
    "With the surge in power prices has come great interest in saving on
electric bills," notes Gerald R. Alderson, President of Wattage Monitor.  "In
response we have expanded our service, sent consumer service teams to
San Diego to help consumers choose a supplier and have made it easier to
switch on-line at http://www.wattagemonitor.com or through our toll-free 
service
reached by calling 1-888-WATTAGE," he added.
    The California electricity market is in a significant transition from a
regulated market to a competitive one.  But like telephone long-distance
service, a consumer must switch to a competing supplier to lower their bill.
As consumers increasingly become aware that they have a choice and switch,
competition is expected to produce even greater savings.  But consumers must
act to realize the savings available.
    Wattage Monitor is a nationwide, free to consumers service that offers
residential and commercial electric consumers their specific electric service
options through its website http://www.wattagemonitor.com or its toll-free 
service
888-WATTAGE.  Consumers may also easily and conveniently enroll with the
supplier of their choice.  Competing electric suppliers' rates and services
are posted by zip code.  Simple, straightforward, comparative and all in one
place.

Looks good, except for the comments on "discourages generation".  Make it 
"discourages peaking generation".  

Although I agree that any price cap has a "discouraging " impact on the 
generation market, it is a matter of degree in this sound bite environment.  
To the point, without a creative exit strategy, I would not waste development 
money on a 10000-13000 BTU/KWh heat rate peaking project.  However, even with 
the FERC order, I will continue to spend money developing base load, 7000 
BTU/KWh heat rate projects.  The state is tremendously short on power, the 
price cap goes away (theoretically) in two years, $150 is well above the 
average expected price in our forcast models (although I agree not above the 
price for particular hours if scalers are applied.)

I agree with much of what Jeff has written.  Here are some additions -

On FERC getting a lot right, look at the Order in relation to our 4 key 
points filed in the White Paper -
Removing Market Transparency - Still need FERC to take action
Development of Forwards Market and Risk Management - Great results
Removing distortions on Prices - Wrong action
Ending Cal ISO / Cal PX Stakeholder Boards - Great results

On the risk management issue, FERC itself said "The single most important 
remedy that California market needs is the elimination of rules that prevent 
market participants from managing risk". [FERC PRESS RELEASE]

ADD - FERC Staff did a great job on preparing a detailed analysis of the 
market issues.

Here are the messages as I understand them.  Please let me know if I've 
misconstrued anything.  Thanks.

FERC got  a lot right in the order and we're very encouraged as a result.
In particular, ending the PX buy/sell requirement and permitting utilities to 
manage risk through a portfolio of short and long term contracts is a 
fundamental step in the right direction.
However, the proposed price cap is unworkable and will jeopardize realibility 
in California.  As structured, it will:
discourage the development of new generation to serve California
fail to provide adequate incentives for demand responsiveness.
force Enron to abandon 300 MWs of new power projects planned for California.
We look forward to participating in FERC's process and are hopeful that 
FERC's final order will fix the deficiencies in the current price cap 
proposal.
We encourage California to work with FERC to implement the proposals and 
quickly fix the flaws in the market on behalf of the state's consumers.

As discussed in last Friday's meeting on strategies related to higher energy 
prices, Harry asked me to develop the attached projection of delivered gas 
prices for this winter.

The projection is based upon EIA's monthly analysis of delivered gas prices 
for residential, commercial and industrial customers for selected states 
(Connecticut, Virginia, Illinois and Texas) for the 1999-2000 winter heating 
season (Nov-Mar).  Assuming pipeline and LDC mark-ups remain constant, the 
delivered prices were adjusted for the NYMEX Henry Hub projection of wellhead 
prices for the 2000-2001 winter period.  A national projection is also 
included.

Because the commodity portion of the gas bill for residential customers is a 
smaller percent of the total bill compared to commercial and industrial 
customers, the increase for residential customers will be less pronounced 
than for commercial or industrial customers.  In addition, LDC purchased gas 
cost mechanisms will moderate the effect of the price increase to some extent 
because monthly price increases are averaged out over an extended period (12 
months in some cases).  Furthermore, some state public utility commissions 
(e.g. Connecticut) are conducting meetings with LDCs to discuss looking for 
ways to lessen the impact of the projected increases. That being said, Nipsco 
recently announced residential prices are expected to increase 50-60% this 
winter over last winter (in line with the projection for Illinois).

If you are interested in a similar projection for other states, or have 
comments with respect to the above let me know.

Steve, thanks for the helpful materials. However, if the experience in 
overseas deregulating electricity markets where price increases and spikes 
have occurred is any precedent, we will need to have some more down-to-earth 
responses to a some of the potentially inflammatory issues facing the 
politicians:
    1. When the prices spike, who reaps the windfall? Who sells that most 
expensive 1% of the kwh? Is it a careful planner or a lucky speculator or 
market manipulator? Someone is making a bunch of money off the screwed up 
system. Who is it, and why is that OK?
    2. We do not allow people to inflate water prices to consumers in times 
of drought, or food prices in times of hurricanes or floods. Even gasoline 
price increases in periods of high demand are within 20%-30% of the base, not 
2,5,10 or 100 times the average like spot electric prices. The issue isn't 
whether the system is broken or not or how bad partial regulation is or how 
much demand has increased versus supply. Thes will be seen as "ivory tower" 
discussions. The populist political issue is, until the problem is fixed, why 
should some shrewd big electric company or middleman be allowed to profit off 
the misfortune of consumers who did not cause the problem? Why should anyone 
be allowed to profiteer by selling at multiples above their generation cost?
    3. The hedges, fixed price contracts and other de facto insurance against 
volatility that Enron or others offer could be seen as a symptom of the 
problem rather than the solution.  Enron could be seen as at best a band aid 
and at worst an opportunist made possible only by a broken system - - -sort 
of like the guys who ran the old style protection rackets, or Colombian 
"security consultants" who "guard " pipelines from the threats their guerilla 
afiliates create, or  political risk insurance that you shouldn't really need 
if the host country wasn't so screwed up. Don't worry about high crime in 
your neighborhood -  - - just hire an off-duty policeman.   Who needed these 
new electricity risk management products in the old days before deregulation? 

    We have to be able to answer these types of questions at the level of the 
ordinary citizen, not merely have the correct long-term competitive market 
solution, or the forces of ignorance and re-regulation will gain momentum. 
Are we sure we shouldn't back a temporary peak hour price cap  until the 
regulatory problems we're all familiar with are worked out, to avoid a much 
worse long term rollback?. - - -DLH

Subject: Talking Points re "reregulation" in California

As I promised this morning at the executive committee meeting, below are some 
talking points for your use.

Overall message:  the market is working, regulation is not.

In California, peak demand rose by 10% over the last 4 years while new 
capacity grew by only 2%.  But, as you would expect, the market responded by 
proposing 8,000MW of new generation - - more than enough to offset the peak 
demand growth.  The regulatory process, at both the state and local level, 
has failed to site this new generation.  The problem is regulation, not 
deregulation.

When San Diego customers began experiencing the effects of higher prices, 
Enron responded with a fixed price which would have shielded San Diego 
customers from price volatility and provided prices below their current 
summer levels (Enron's price was about $55/MWH).  After publication of 
Enron's offer, nine other companies made offers.  Again, the market responded 
where regulation failed.  San Diego has not accepted any of these offers 
because of regulatory/legislative restrictions on its ability to buy outside 
of the PX (i.e. the spot market).

In markets where siting is easier, suppliers have moved to build additional 
generation.  Enron built 3 plants in response to the 1998 price spikes.  
Those plants were planned, sited and built in less that 12 months - - in time 
for the summer of 1999.  Where regulatory hurdles are lower, the market 
responds.

The solution to current pricing and reliability issues is more competition 
not reregulation.  Policy makers should:

Open the transmission grid so that power can get from where it is to where it 
is needed.

Expedite interconnection of new generation.

Expedite siting of new facilities.

Give customers a choice, so that they have better access to demand side 
solutions.


Also attached is a more detailed discussion of California, prepared by Jeff 
Dasovich of our San Francisco office.

California's Governor Orders Regulators
To Slash Electric Rates in Southern Areas

By ANDY PASZTOR and JASON LEOPOLD
Staff Reporters of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL

Gov. Gray Davis ordered California utility regulators to
immediately slash electricity rates in southern parts of the
state by about 50%. The move threatens to ratchet up the
political debate over high power prices and could end up
pitting California against federal regulators.

If the appointed Public Utilities Commission approves such a
rollback, typical residential electric bills for some 1.1
million customers would shrink to about $55 a month from the
current $122 level, according to Sempra Energy's San Diego
Gas & Electric Co. unit. Rates have nearly doubled in the
past three months. The governor's plan also would
essentially freeze rates for the next two years.

Consumers and Regulators Seek to Cope With Lingering
California Power Crisis (Aug. 4)[PARA]Deregulation Leaves
Electricity Market Ripe for Manipulation by Power Firms
(Aug. 4)[PARA]California Agencies Are Beset by Major
Electricity Shortages (Aug. 3)[PARA]California Cuts Price
Cap for Electricity Once Again (Aug. 2)

Stretching from the Mexican border to the southern part of
Orange County, the region affected by the order has been
hard hit by steep price spikes stemming from local power
shortages, regulatory confusion and unusually hot weather.
As a result of deregulation, area consumers in July 1999
became the first California residents to pay market prices
for power.

While the utilities commission isn't slated to hold an
emergency meeting until Aug. 21, commissioner Richard Bilas
said that Wednesday's announcement already was branded as
"extreme" by some state lawmakers who accused Gov. Davis of
trying to "pre-empt the legislature" by capitalizing on the
politically charged issue. The legislature previously had
scheduled to take up the issue of proposed rate rollbacks as
early as Thursday.

The state commission last week rejected call for mandatory
rate reductions. But Wednesday, commission president Loretta
Lynch said the governor is "calling for the right thing" to
provide "price relief and some predictability" to San Diego
customers. The governor also announced an agreement with
grocery store operators that could result in as much as a
10% voluntary reduction in energy use by such stores when
power supplies are especially tight.

Democratic State Sen. Steve Peace says that consumption in
fast-growing parts of the state, like the San Diego area,
have surged to levels that weren't anticipated until 2015.
Mr. Peace, the architect of deregulation here, is urging
state agencies not to approve any sales of interests in
power plants owned by California-based utilities until
conditions normalize.

Meanwhile, the Navy isn't waiting for state initiatives.
With its San Diego power bills projected to climb to $39
million from the $20 million budgeted from June to
September, Navy planners have been quietly studying the
possibility of bringing in two of their own generators to
supply electricity to San Diego bases. In addition, admirals
have demanded sharp reductions in power usage, including
orders to turn off all lights in many offices during peak
times. "We are working by the lights of our computers," said
a Navy spokesman. As Sedge's largest San Diego customer, the
Navy uses about 130 megawatts per day during high demand
periods.

Steve Baum, president and chief executive of Sempra, said
the "electric market is broken" and all factions must work
together to prevent out-of-state generators from "gouging"
California residents by selling power "at unconscionably
high prices." But he said state utility regulators are
better equipped to find ways to cushion the blow from
wholesale price hikes than are "instant-pudding bills"
proposed by lawmakers.

As we begin to meet with FERC Staff on the Wholesale market issues related to 
CA problems, I think that we need to put together a list of questions that 
FERC needs to be asking Western power market participants.  

The following are some questions that I think are important to have FERC ask; 
I'm sure there are more.

1. Were California utilities underscheduling load into the PX day ahead 
market?  
2. How many MWs did the CA ISO procure during each hour during the Summer 
2000?  How does this compare with CA ISO procurement during 1999?
3. Has PG&E changed its bidding behavior associated with its Hydro facilities 
in 2000?  
3. Are there baseload facilities that were operated differently in 2000 than 
in 1999?
4. Were any generation plants off-line due to unplanned maintenance during 
Summer 2000?
5. How did the CA ISO demand side program work?  Why didn't more load 
participate?  
6. What options did SDG&E have to "hedge" its retail rates?  What were prices 
in the CAL PX block forward market on Jan 15, 2000 and May 15, 2000?
7. How high did natural gas prices go in California for generation during 
Summer 2000?
8. Were other Western power markets prices higher (year-on-year)?
9. Did the CA ISO Board face political pressure to reduce bid caps?  Is this 
appropriate for a FERC jurisdictional entity?
10. What specific details is SDG&E referring to in its Complaint on 
"unworkably competitive" CA ISO markets?  Can these be fixed "quickly"?

Please add other questions.

Some comments from Tim on the outline

Because the prices are based on L3Day NYMEX prices, when two out of three 
prices have already been posted, it is impossible for parties to hedge their 
risk for November.  [For your information but not for the filing - We have a 
big position for November so we need to get this pushed off until December or 
we could lose alot of money].
By basing the caps on heat rates from 1999, the ISO assumed that this was the 
proper test period.  This is not a good test year given that generators lost 
alot of money in 1999.

Clinton Seeks Stepped-Up Power Probe --- Surging Prices for Electricity In 
California Spur Move;
Emergency Loans Planned
By Rebecca Smith and John J. Fialka
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

08/24/2000
The Wall Street Journal

WASHINGTON -- The Clinton Administration and federal energy regulators 
stepped up efforts to respond to a
politically disastrous rise in California electricity prices, threatening to 
go as far as re-regulating some prices if they
determine that the free-market experiment in the state has failed. 

The moves by federal authorities come as California regulators and lawmakers 
scramble to come up with an
expedient solution to high power prices in the San Diego area, where monthly 
bills have in some cases quadrupled
since last summer.

In a 21-page order issued yesterday, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
said that under the Federal Power
Act it can intervene to limit the prices charged by generators to the 
California market -- if it determines the prices
they are charging aren't "just and reasonable," and the market is not 
"workably competitive." 

The order accompanied an upgrade of the FERC's effort from a staff probe to a 
formal investigation, requested by
President Clinton, who also yesterday extended $2.6 million in federal 
emergency loans to low-income residents in
the San Diego area to help pay their electric bills. 

"There is a crisis of confidence in California wholesale electricity markets 
that threatens to erode the political
consensus necessary to sustain a market-based approach to regulation,"William 
Massey, one of four FERC
commissioners, said yesterday in an opinion attached to the order. "In these 
circumstances, the FERC must act
forcefully and decisively to . . . insist that jurisdictional wholesale 
markets produce consumer benefits and just and
reasonable rates." 

As prices have risen, power generators such as Duke Energy Co., the local 
utility, San Diego Gas & Electric Co.
and public officials have all pointed the finger at one another for what 
appears to be a badly flawed market. California
governor Gray Davis, who is pushing for local legislation that would lower 
bills and accelerate power-plant
construction, yesterday said "out-of-state generators" were most responsible 
for "bringing San Diego residents to
their knees." 

FERC's action yesterday originated in a complaint filed Aug. 2 by San Diego 
Gas & Electric Co, a unit of Sempra
Energy, the utility whose customers have riased the most outrage over the 
rate rises. 

The utility sold off its plants and now buys all the power its customers use 
out of a state-sanctioned auction,
passing those market costs directly through to its customers. 

Steve Baum, Sempra Energy chairman, said FERC's action is a warning to 
generators "that the prices they've been
receiving are now at risk." He expects FERC to eventually issue a ruling that 
California's market isn't competitive,
setting the stage for a possible return to cost-based rates in periods of 
high demand. Prior to deregulation in 1998,
the rates utilities charged for electricity were based on their underlying 
cost. Deregulation allowed them to charge
whatever the market would bear. 

Mr. Clinton said the the FERC investigation would allow Washington to "better 
understand" what is happening in the
California market so the government can protect consumers there and in other 
deregulated states. 

While politicians and regulators seek solutions, wholesale power prices in 
California are becoming more aberrant. 

Even on days when consumption and prices normally drop, such as Sundays, 
prices have been stubbornly high this
summer. For example, the auction price of electricity to be consumed at 10 
p.m. last Sunday was $125.48 per
megawatt, or more than four times the price such power commanded on the third 
Sunday of August in 1999. The
markup is especially noteworthy because actual demand on that day was 12% 
lower than on the comparable day a
year earlier. 

"A number of people are looking at the high prices trying to figure out 
what's going on," says Jesus Arredondo,
spokesman for the state-sanctioned entity that runs the state's day-ahead 
energy auction, the California Power
Exchange in Pasadena, Calif. 

These prices have remained high despite the best efforts of public officials. 
For instance, the organization that runs
the state's electric grid and is responsible for keeping consumers constantly 
supplied with electricity has reduced
the maximum price it will pay for electricity this summer to $250 per 
megawatt hour from $750. While this action
has capped peak prices, it has also caused an increase in the overall number 
of hours in which prices are
abnormally high. 

Take yesterday for instance. Prices for power in California never dropped 
below $108 per megawatt hour, even for
power contracted for delivery in the dead of night, and the hourly price was 
at or above $200 in 13 of 24 hours
despite only moderately high demand. 

California's problems are likely to step up pressure on Congress to pass 
omnibus legislation which would provide
uniform national rules for deregulated state energy markets and make more 
efficient the interstate
power-transmission system, Mr. Clinton said yesterday. 

The administration has pushed for such a measure but the House Commerce 
Committee, which has jurisdiction
over the legislation, still appears deadlocked on the details. It plans to 
hold a hearing in California on
electricity-market conditions there next month.

FERC To Meet Nov 9 To Propose Remedies To Calif 
                    Pwr Mkt 
                    Friday, October 20, 2000 08:17 AM 
  
                    LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--In an unusual move, the Federal 
Energy Regulatory                     Commission said Thursday it will meet 
Nov. 1 to discuss remedies to California's                     troubled 
wholesale power market. 
                    Details of a probe into California's wholesale 
electricity market will also be released at                     the Nov. 1 
meeting. As reported, state and federal regulators launched the probe over    
                 the summer, saying the market wasn't workably competitive. 
                    FERC also said it expects to hold a public hearing Nov. 9 
to discuss possible                     solutions to California's power 
crisis. 
                    The place and time of both meetings haven't been decided 
yet. 
                    Regarding Thursday's announcement, FERC Commissioner Curt 
Hebert said "rather                     than waiting for Nov. 1 to release 
the findings of our staff's investigation, I urge the                     
chairman to release the completed report now...it can only help heal the raw 
emotions                     rampant in the state of California." 
                    FERC said it was rare that it would announce details of 
its procedures. The                     commission said its own rules don't 
allow it to normally announce its procedures. 
                    "Because of the need for expeditious action to address 
the serious issues affecting                     California electric power 
markets and California consumers...the commission is taking                   
  the unusual step of announcing in advance the procedures it expects to 
follow over the                     coming weeks to move forward in these 
proceedings," the FERC order said. 
                    The commission said it will give a three-week deadline 
for parties to intervene and to                     comment on the possible 
solutions presented by the commission. 
                    FERC said it anticipates issuing an order by the end of 
the year "adopting and                     directing remedies to promptly 
address to the extent possible the identified problems                     
adversely affecting competitive power markets in California." 
                    If necessary, FERC said it would hold additional meetings 
to develop solutions "to                     other identified problems." 
                    California's wholesale power prices soared this past 
summer. Customers of San                     Diego Gas & Electric Co., a unit 
of Sempra Energy Corp. (SRE, news, msgs), paid                     
market-based rates for power, which resulted in triple-digit utility bills 
for its customers.                     The state's three investor-owned 
utilities also racked up billions of dollars in debt due                     
to high wholesale costs. 
                    SDG&E customers are currently paying a fixed rate for 
their power, while customers of                     the state's other two 
utilities are still bound by a rate-freeze. 
                    Generators have been accused of gouging customers and 
manipulating the market,                     although no evidence has been 
offered up yet. However, the FERC investigation may                     
address that.

Cal-ISO CEO To Announce Remedy To Lower Power 
                    Cost 
                    Friday, October 20, 2000 08:16 AM 
                    (This article was originally published Thursday) 
                    LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--California Independent System 
Operator Chairman and                     Chief Executive Terry Winter will 
hold a news conference Friday morning to announce                     a 
possible solution to reduce the state's electricity costs. 
                    An ISO spokesman wouldn't comment on the details of the 
news conference. 
                    According to a news release, Winter will speak about 
"potential vehicles for containing                     costs, while 
maintaining the ISO's high standards of reliability." 
                    The ISO controls about 75% of California's power grid and 
real-time market. As                     already reported, the grid operator 
has come under fire this summer for failing to                     
immediately reduce a price cap in its real-time market. 
                    Currently, state Sen. Steve Peace, D-Chula Vista, is 
drafting legislation to merge the                     ISO and the state's 
Power Exchange.

CalPX Told To Release Confidential Trade Data To State 
  
09/22/2000 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones&Company, Inc.) 
LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- California's Electricity Oversight Board has 
ordered the state's Power Exchange to hand over confidential information to 
the board regarding the trading activities of utilities, generation companies 
and other market participants who traded power at the exchange since June, 
according to a copy of a subpoena obtained by Dow Jones Newswires. 
The subpoena marks the first time the state will gain access and learn how 
each company traded power in the day-of, day-ahead and block forward markets. 
Moreover, the EOB subpoena requests the CalPX release the names of the 
participants who traded power at the exchange since June to better understand 
how and why the participants conduct business in the various markets at the 
exchange. 
The CalPX has until Wednesday to hand over "aggregate supply and demand 
curves, individual firm bid dates, final schedules for each firm by 
generating unit, injection point and take out point," from June 1 through 
September and continue supplying trading data through Nov. 1. 
In addition, the subpoena requests "block forward trade positions by firm for 
June, July, August and September" and that this information continue to be 
supplied through October and November. 
The subpoena is part of the state's ongoing investigation into California's 
troubled deregulated electricity market, which has resulted in high wholesale 
power prices in San Diego, landmark legislative action and accusations of 
collusion, price gouging and market power. Gov. Gray Davis ordered an 
investigation in June, when power prices soared to near record levels and 
rolling blackouts wreaked havoc in the Bay Area.

its various markets to alert them of the EOB subpoena.

Chris --

Given this development, now may be the right time for Enron to come in and 
make a "public" offer to SDG&E.  We may be able to put some pressure on the 
CPUC to approve a full requirements offer that works with the legislative 
rate cap.

I'll be in contact with you to discuss.

Jim

Surprise, surprise.  

SDG&E is afraid to do anything without the pre-approved reasonableness from 
the CPUC which I don't think will be obtained.

Given the way the numbers came out, I guess we don't need the talking points, 
but we should still try to get to the bottom of this because we will be 
called on to comment to regulators and media.  Unless we have strong evidence 
to the contrary, it seems to me that wholesale markets are working .... they 
are open and they are competitive.  On the other hand, retail gas markets 
suffer from the same problems as electric markets ... they are not open, 
customers don't have effective choices and price signals don't get through, 
so there is no demand response when prices rise.  

On the points raised in the attachment, I'm still not sure I follow point 4.  
Also what does" electric disconnect" mean?

Leslie:  Looks good.  Just a couple of comments:

1. General
May want to point out that the roots of California's current gas woes are the 
same ones causing the electric problem---combined effect of California's 
"import-based" energy policy and the state's failure to invest in in-state 
infrastructure.  California imports about 25% of its electricity, but about 
80-90 percent of its gas supply.  California has failed to invest in the 
in-state infrastructure necessary to support increased gas demand over the 
last decade.  So we've got an interstate pipeline superhighway to the border 
and a dirt road of in-state transportation once you get into California.
The last bullet seems to suggest that manipulation may be taking place.  Can 
we support that suggestion, and is it one that we want to make necessarily?  
If we do suggest that manipulation may in part explain current prices, do we 
need to propose ways to eliminate it?  Otherwise, seems that we may be giving 
FERC ammunition to take action without trying to "steer" that action in the 
right direction.  Maybe I'm reading too much into the bullet.

2. Specific
Competition for gas coming to California has increased significantly.  The 
midwest (via Alliance) is competing away Canadian gas.  The Southwest 
(Nevada, Arizona) is competing away supply from the Southwest before it hits 
the California border.

Here are five articles pertaining to Enron and the offer we made in San 
Diego. I am looking for others.

Karen Denne remarks in the San Diego Union Tribune that Enron has offered 
fixed price contracts and that Enron customers have not been effected by this 
price spike. July 25, 2000



The article below states that Enron has put an offer for energy at 5.5 
cents/KWh on the table, and others are
expected to provide a variety of possible deals. July 16, 2000 San Diego 
Union Tribune (SDUT)



Enron has already made one offer, but the
price is too high and the terms are too long. July 11, 2000 SDUT



The local utility, a unit of Sempra Energy, denied reports yesterday that it 
would soon reach an agreement with Enron Corp. on a deal that would lock
in power rates for years for a large segment of its customer base... The 
initial offer from Enron was to provide power for four years at 5.5
cents per kilowatt, according to Peace, who emphasized he hoped SDG&E would 
receive competing bids from other companies.
Hoge said Enron's track record and the nature of long-term power contracts 
made her skeptical that such a deal could save San Diego money.
"With fixed contracts, you always end up paying more than you should on the 
other end," she said. "And Enron always has a way to make these contracts
work for them." July 11, 2000 SDUT



Concerning Enron ..."This is no better than a boiler fraud on the people," 
said Harvey
Rosenfield, who unsuccessfully pressed a ballot initiative to overturn
deregulation. "They jack up rates over 200 percent -- then they offer you a
deal at a 50 percent hike.

"I don't think the solution to this problem is to put the people of San
Diego at the mercy of Enron."

Enron is offering to sell San Diego power for four years at 5.5 cents per 
kilowatt hour,
according to Peace. The price would be about 50 percent less than current 
costs, but more than 50 percent above rates paid as recently as this
spring.

The record high gas prices of this summer and fall and the questions
regarding supply adequacy for this winter have focused attention on
natural gas far beyond the confines of the direct market participants.
The national media, regulators, politicians, industrial groups, and
consumer advocates have all raised concerns about what will transpire
in terms of prices and availability this winter=01*and what can be done
about it. These conditions, however, are a culmination of trends that
have been developing in the gas market for five years or more; reversal
of these trends is likely to require more than one season or even one
year. In this environment, prices in the $4.00 to $5.00 per MMBtu
range have become the norm and will be sustained into the winter.
Equally important, further spikes to the $6.00 to $7.00 range cannot be
ruled out.

Here is an additional paragraph from ENA legal which I will add.

Under the gas contacts of ENA, a diversion of gas as a result of governmental 
action would likely be an event of force majeure excusing the performance of 
ENA.  As an aside, you should note that the vast majority of ENA's gas 
business involves deliveries to its customers at various city gates.  ENA has 
very limited exposure to transportation or pipelines owned by local 
distribution companies.

Attached are the articles that I had sent to Steve Kean concerning the offers 
Enron made in San Diego. Please let me know if you need further information. 
My number is 713-853-4382. 

Thanks,

Gavin Dillingham

SDG&E is entertaining offers from major power companies for a fixed-price
contract to stabilize electricity prices. The utility has received at least
one proposal from Enron Corp. for a multiple-year contract at prices less
than half current levels -- but 50 percent above prices in the spring.



"It's like apples and oranges," said Thomas Williams, the Duke spokesman. 
He noted that Roseville had recently secured power at 4.9 cents from Enron
-- a Duke competitor -- but had signed a five-year contract.



SDG&E also said yesterday that it received "several" proposals from power
companies to provide fixed future prices for electricity, which involve
long-term contracts touted by power companies -- a "market solution" to the
rate roller coaster residents have experienced.

The utility declined to provide a precise number of proposal details but
said it would evaluate the offers over the next two weeks and make
recommendations to regulatory authorities. Peace said earlier that Enron is
expected to be a bidder, offering a fixed price about 50 percent above
rates of last May.


Palmer said Enron could protect consumers from electricity price spikes by
entering into "hedging" agreements with local utilities, which are
contracts that provide guaranteed pricing for certain periods. He said the
company had reached such an agreement with the utility servicing Hartford,
Conn.

Duke committing to Deliver 3,000 Megawatts of New Supply to California And a 
Five-Year Fixed Price Supply Contract



Karen Denne remarks in the San Diego Union Tribune that Enron has offered 
fixed price contracts and that Enron customers have not been effected by this 
price spike. July 25, 2000



The article below states that Enron has put an offer for energy at 5.5 
cents/KWh on the table, and others are
expected to provide a variety of possible deals. July 16, 2000 San Diego 
Union Tribune (SDUT)



Enron has already made one offer, but the
price is too high and the terms are too long. July 11, 2000 SDUT



The local utility, a unit of Sempra Energy, denied reports yesterday that it 
would soon reach an agreement with Enron Corp. on a deal that would lock
in power rates for years for a large segment of its customer base... The 
initial offer from Enron was to provide power for four years at 5.5
cents per kilowatt, according to Peace, who emphasized he hoped SDG&E would 
receive competing bids from other companies.
Hoge said Enron's track record and the nature of long-term power contracts 
made her skeptical that such a deal could save San Diego money.
"With fixed contracts, you always end up paying more than you should on the 
other end," she said. "And Enron always has a way to make these contracts
work for them." July 11, 2000 SDUT



Concerning Enron ..."This is no better than a boiler fraud on the people," 
said Harvey
Rosenfield, who unsuccessfully pressed a ballot initiative to overturn
deregulation. "They jack up rates over 200 percent -- then they offer you a
deal at a 50 percent hike.

"I don't think the solution to this problem is to put the people of San
Diego at the mercy of Enron."

Enron is offering to sell San Diego power for four years at 5.5 cents per 
kilowatt hour,
according to Peace. The price would be about 50 percent less than current 
costs, but more than 50 percent above rates paid as recently as this
spring.

Duque's Decision passed 3-2 (Duque, Neeper, Bilas - Lynch, Wood) - Both 
Neeper and Bilas said that they were only voting for this decision because of 
pressure. They both felt that last meeting's decision provided sufficient 
relief and provided for a investigation to address longer term problems.

Summary: 

The Decision institutes a rate stabilization for residential and commercial 
customers
 Residential: $68 through 1/1/01 and $75 through 12/31/01 for those who 
consume 500kW or less - market prices for the others residential 
 Commercial: $220 through 1/1/01 and $240 through 12/31/01 for those who 
consume 1500 kW or less - market place for other commercial

Other rate schedules: Subject to market prices

Implementation date: Retroactive to 6/1/00 - SDG&E will provide a credit for 
those customers that are eligible no latter than September 30th

The decision intends to allow for future adjustment of the kWh rate caps 
retroactive to June 1, 200 to ensure that customers in hotter inland regions 
have an appropriate level of usage cap and medium size commercial customers 
are provided relief.

The bill stabilization plan requires SDG&E to file comments, by September 30, 
addressing the implementation and transition of a Levelized Payment Plan 
(LPP) for all customers on an "opt out" basis. However, the procedure for the 
implementation of the LLP will allow customers to readily exercise choice, 
while those that do not exercise choice will default into the LPP.

The Commission will also further study the bill stabilization plan as to 
direct access customers. 

Revenue shortfalls are to be booked into the TCBA for future recovery of the 
net shortfall. 

Discussion: 
Senator Alpert, Assembly Women Davis, Mayor Golding , the former mayor, 
several members of the City and County of San Diego Board of Supervisors made 
a public appearance. All thanked the Commission for  having this special 
session. All supported the Wood decision. All stated that it did not  go far 
enough and insisted that all customers should be subject to the cap. Assembly 
Women Davis stated that she would be going back to the legislation  to pass 
the Davis/Alpert Bill establishing a cap for all customers. However, 
Asseblymember Wright, chairman of the Utilities and Commerce Committee, has 
been open and has shown opposition to the Alpert/Davis bill.

Calif. power resources will be 3,752 Mw short in 2001

By David Feliciano, BridgeNews

Scottsdale, Ariz.--Dec. 7--California resources and reserves for
electricity will be 3,752 megawatts short of the anticipated load in 2001,
California Independent System Operator (ISO) President and CEO Terry Winter
said Thursday at the annual Western Systems Coordinating Council meeting.

"I'm concerned about supply," Winter said.

"Without sufficient supply, markets will set socially and politically
unacceptable price levels (for wholesale power)"

Winter said California power resources will total 46,679 Mw in 2001, but
load is expected to reach well over 50,000 Mw. Over 17,000 Mw of new 
generation
is planned for the state, but most new power plants are not expected to begin
service until 2002 and beyond.

Not helping California's cause, Winter said, are reduced imports of power
this year from neighboring states, down from 7,500 Mw in November of 1999 to
3,900 Mw this November.

Winter also pointed to the affect of a soaring natural gas market. "You can
build generation, but in California, natural gas and emissions are the next
problems. Natural gas is running into the same problem electricity has...there
is a shortage."

Due in part to the above California wholesale power prices have skyrocketed
since May, leading to rolling blackouts in San Francisco in June and a series
of conservation emergencies since that time. The state has been under a power
conservation warning much of this week.

As tools to solve California power woes, Winter suggested the ISO file for
an extension of price cap authority for power until markets are demonstrated 
to
be workably competitive. The ISO's authority to set price caps, which 
currently
stands at $250 per Mw/hour expired Nov. 15. The Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission on Nov. 1 proposed caps of $150 Mw/hour, but has yet to officially
rule on the matter.

Winter also called for the California Public Utilities Commission to allow
full peak requirements to be forward contracted and hedged by load.  End

*********************************
California ISO Files Emergency Action With FERC to Deal With Electricity 
Supply Crisis

FOLSOM, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 8, 2000 via NewsEdge Corporation  -
While grappling
with another Stage Two Emergency today, the California Independent
System Operator (California ISO) is taking swift action to deal with a
critical shortage of bids in the ISO market as well as serious
underscheduling of electricity in the forward markets. The proposed
market changes create the incentive to sell power in existing markets
and allow the ISO to compete better for regional energy, which is in
short supply throughout the western United States.

This afternoon, the ISO filed an emergency tariff Amendment 33
filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).
Commencing at 3:00 p.m. today Friday, December 8, 2000, the California
ISO will implement a $250 "soft cap" on the ISO's Real-Time Energy
Market similar to that proposed by FERC in its November 1 Order
Proposing Remedies for California Wholesale Electric Markets (93 FERC
61,121).

Analogous to the soft cap proposed by FERC, Energy bids prices in
excess of $250/MWh will no longer be rejected by the ISO's
computerized scheduling system but, instead, will be evaluated in
price merit order. The California ISO has recently been placed in the
position of having to negotiate prices for power in real-time and is
finding it increasingly difficult to manage these negotiations while
at the same time balancing supply and demand; causing significant risk
to the California ISO's ability to maintain reliable control of the
power grid. The ISO will no longer negotiate prices in real-time. To
the extent the ISO issues dispatch instructions to Scheduling
Coordinators (market participants) for energy bid prices in excess of
the $250 soft cap, then settlement will be as-bid, subject to refund,
if the costs cannot be verified. Market participants will be required
to submit cost documentation to the FERC, with informational filings
to the ISO and the state, supporting any Energy payments priced in
excess of the soft cap.

The current $250 price cap in Ancillary Service capacity bids is
unaffected. Also, the market clearing prices for Ancillary Services
and Imbalance Energy will continue to be calculated and posted up to
the $250 soft cap.

Amendment 33 proposes three key elements:

1. Implement a "soft cap" of $250/MWh for Imbalance Energy. This
soft cap would limit market clearing prices to $250/MWh, but would
allow market participants to submit bids over $250 if they submit
verifiable costs.

2. Allocate the costs for energy purchases above the soft cap to
Scheduling Coordinators who rely on the ISO's real-time energy
purchases to meet their loads, rather than buying their own supplies
in the forward markets; and

3. Impose penalties on Participating Generators that fail to
comply with ISO dispatch instructions. Amendment 33 is posted on the
ISO's website at www.caiso.com under FERC FILINGS on the home page.

The ISO has seen a dramatic increase in costs for the power it
buys in real time. For the first five days of December we averaged
approximately $5 million per day. However, on December 5th we paid $36
million, December 7th $81 million. Failure to take action now would
have the local utilities and ultimately their customers continue to
face these extraordinary costs.

The California ISO is charged with managing the flow of
electricity along the long-distance, high-voltage power lines that
make up the bulk of California's transmission system. The
not-for-profit public-benefit corporation assumed the responsibility
in March, 1998, when California opened its energy markets to
competition and the state's investor-owned utilities turned their
private transmission power lines over to the California ISO to manage.
The mission of the California ISO is to safeguard the reliable
delivery of electricity, facilitate markets and ensure equal access to
a 12,500 circuit mile "electron highway."

Federal Agencies Gear Up Hydro System to Meet Demand

PORTLAND, Ore., Dec. 8 /PRNewswire/  via NewsEdge Corporation  -
Due to an impending power shortage,
federal agencies will increase generation at nearly all of the federal dams.
This may cause some projects to operate outside the limits of the biological
opinion under the Endangered Species Act as additional water is released for
generation from upstream reservoirs, the Bonneville Power Administration said
today.

The announcement came following a call by the Regional Emergency Response
Team and Northwest governors for conservation of electricity when arctic air
invades the Northwest beginning this weekend. The team comprises Northwest
utilities, the Northwest Power Planning Council and representatives of the
four Northwest states.

BPA officials said that this step must be taken in order to ensure that
heavy demand for electricity can be met in the region through next week.
Forecasters are predicting freezing temperatures on both sides of the
Cascades. BPA supplies about 40 percent of the region's electricity, most of
it generated at dams in the Columbia River Basin.

"Utilities in the region have assessed their generating inventories and
determined that the region is clearly short of energy and in an emergency
status," Delwiche said. "The BPA and other utilities must take extraordinary
steps immediately to avoid potentially severe shortages next week."

Water is stored in reservoirs behind upstream dams and released in the
spring to assist downstream migration of juvenile salmon. BPA manages the
storage to ensure that enough water is available to both meet electrical
generating requirements and flows for salmon. BPA has the authority to exceed
guidelines of the biological opinion under emergency conditions.

"It is very important that everyone - residential and commercial consumers
and industries -- do what they can to cut back on their use of electricity
during this cold snap," said Greg Delwiche, BPA's vice president for
generation supply. "Every kilowatt hour saved now means less need to draw
water from the reservoirs."

Calif. Restarts Dirty Power Plants

By JENNIFER COLEMAN
Associated Press Writer
SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) via NewsEdge Corporation  -
Hoping to ease the state's electricity
crisis, air-quality regulators Friday allowed the restart of
several power plants in Southern California that had been shut down
because they had reached air pollution limits.

The move came a day after California encountered an
unprecedented power crunch, with electricity supplies for the
state's 34 million people so perilously low that California only
narrowly avoided blackouts.

The power crunch has been blamed on cold weather in the
Northwest, the shutdown of some generating plants for repairs or
other reasons, and the effects of utility deregulation in
California.

On Thursday, during the emergency, power plants capable of
producing 2,400 megawatts were off-line because they had exceeded
their pollution limits. One megawatt is sufficient to power about
1,000 homes.

On Friday, the South Coast Air Quality Management District
agreed to let some of those polluting power plants return to
operation and restore about half of that lost generating capacity.
However, those plants will have to pay daily fines.

Restarting the over-polluting plants should provide a cushion
for state, said Stephanie McCorkle, a spokeswoman for the
California Independent System Operator, which runs the state's
power grid.

In addition, hundreds of companies voluntarily cut consumption
Friday to avoid imposed outages.

``We're still encouraging conservation efforts,'' said Lori
O'Donley, spokeswoman for the ISO. ``We're optimistic that we won't
have to'' impose shutdowns on commercial customers.

Federal energy regulators are working with the state to find
power that can be diverted to California during the crunch, moves
that could include increasing hydroelectric generation out of
state.

The power grid's managers were able to avoid blackouts Thursday
by shutting down the enormous state and federal pumps that push
water from Northern California to central and southern regions.

The phased-in deregulation of California's $20 billion
electrical power industry was supposed to lower prices by creating
greater competition. But demand for electricity has outstripped
supply, in part because of a growing population and a booming
high-tech economy.

Electricity is also in short supply because energy companies
held off building new power plants while deregulation was in the
planning stages. In addition, deregulation has forced utilities to
sell off their power-generating assets, such as dams and plants,
and import electricity from neighboring states, where power demand
is high right now because of a cold snap.

		INSIDE TRACK: Saving up for a rainy day: WEATHER RISK MANAGEMENT: This week's 
storms have prompted businesses to face up to the need to hedge against 
changes in the climate, says Toby Shelley:
Financial Times, Nov 2, 2000, 763 words

		As emergency services brace themselves for more gales after the worst storms 
since the hurricane of 1987, businesses and the public are beginning to 
realise what climate change means: not just flood damage but also disruption 
of infrastructure and transport. 
		The Association of British Insurers says the bill for Sunday's storm will 
amount to hundreds of millions of pounds. This comes on top of last month's 
flood damage in Kent of Pounds 40m-Pounds 80m. Bad weather cost insurers 
Pounds 861m in 1999. 
		While the costs of flooding are fairly easy to quantify, the financial burden 
in terms of business forgone is less obvious. Swimsuit and umbrella 
manufacturers face an obvious weather risk (although a company making both 
would be nicely hedged), but so do 70 per cent of all companies, according to 
industry experts. 
		As awareness of such risks increases among shareholders, chief executives are 
less able to use the climate as an excuse for lower profits. As a result, a 
growing number of companies are developing weather risk management using some 
of the many instruments now available (see below). 
		Europe is catching up with the US in developing mechanisms and tools to help 
companies manage such risk. The London International Financial Futures 
Exchange aims to launch weather futures contracts early in 2001; Societe 
Generale is developing weather hedge funds; Enron, the US energy and trading 
group, is launching another 17 sites in Europe around which to trade weather 
risk; and Weather Risk Marketing is putting together an insurance programme 
in the London market, aimed at FTSE 200 companies, with capacity of Pounds 
100m per customer. 
		The global market in weather risk derivatives is valued at Dollars 
3bn-Dollars 8bn (Pounds 2bn-Pounds 5.5bn) and is mainly in the US. 
		Gas and electricity market deregulation provided the impetus for UK energy 
companies to enter the weather derivates market. Centrica, the UK-based 
energy supplier, is particularly enthusiastic. Given a "normal" winter in 
1999, Centrica's profits would have been Pounds 24m higher. 
		Thor Lien, Enron's senior weather derivatives trader in Europe, values the US 
market at about Dollars 3bn and believes growth next year in Europe could 
double that. But there are a number of imbalances in the current market and 
brakes to further development. 
		The very enthusiasm of the energy sector means demand for derivative hedges 
against warm winters far outweighs demand for hedges against cold winters. 
		Nick Ward, weather risk broker at Spectron Futures, says higher winter demand 
can leave the current derivatives market with characteristics of an insurance 
market where risks have to be absorbed. 
		Lack of liquidity in the market is limiting business, according to some, 
although Mr Ward says the derivative market can look at Pounds 50m risks. An 
active hedger agrees: "The derivatives and reinsurance markets are certainly 
developing, with some larger transactions, which may be in the tens of 
millions, being explored. Most deals, however, remain relatively small in 
comparison with the overall level of risk that could be transferred in these 
markets." 
		SocGen is the only bank to have committed itself thus far to the weather risk 
market and is developing a Dollars 145m hedge fund activity in Europe and 
Asia. Diego Wauters, global head of insurance derivatives, says his team 
often closes two or three deals a week worldwide. It has done about 60 deals 
globally over the last 12 months, 70 per cent of them weather risks. 
		Data pose a problem for some companies. Rob Preston, a director at Speedwell 
Weather Derivatives, says the cost of access to UK weather data from the 
government-owned Meteorological Office may be restricting the take-up of 
weather risk management by smaller companies. For data from a local weather 
site, the Met charges Pounds 1,500 for temperature and the same again for 
rainfall. 
		Another significant brake on market development is lack of awareness. Even 
where treasurers are persuaded of the value of hedging weather risks, selling 
the idea to the board can be difficult. 
		Peter Blogg at Liffe does not expect a flood of interest when futures 
contracts begin trading. Rather, the plan is to establish them as benchmarks. 
At a conceptual level, protecting profits from the weather is accepted by 
many chief executives but few are putting weather risk management into 
practice. 
		David Gamble, executive director of Airmic, the UK risk managers' 
association, says there is a growing interest in the area, although few 
non-energy companies have taken an interest so far. Retailers such as 
Sainsbury and Tesco have no involvement, nor does Railtrack, the notoriously 
weather-prone rail operator. Cargill, the global trading house, is active in 
the US but maintains only a watching brief in Europe. 
		The future structure of the emerging market remains unclear. Mr Preston 
foresees a two-tier basis: a primary market in tailored deals accepted by 
insurance and capital market companies; and a secondary market in wholesale 
traded risks appealing to insurers and energy companies. 
		For Enron, Mr Lien sees a rapidly growing wholesale market in Europe with the 
extremes covered by insurers who will, increasingly, be able to hedge their 
exposure on the derivative market. He says that big exposures require 
syndicated insurance at present but in six months' time the derivatives 
market will have more liquidity.

HOUSTON CHRONICLE
Arena foes, supporters battle it out 
By JANETTE RODRIGUES 
Copyright 2000 Houston Chronicle 
With less than a week to go before the arena referendum is put to a vote, 
supporters and foes put aside any niceties in favor of bare-knuckle brawling 
during a debate Wednesday. 
Both sides spent a lot of time pitching, spinning and trying to persuade 
members of The Greater Heights Area Chamber of Commerce, which sponsored the 
event. 
The debate started out in classic point-counterpoint style, with a panel of 
Houston television news anchors asking the questions. But both sides quickly 
went into attack mode. 
In the pro-arena corner were Harris County-Houston Sports Authority Chairman 
Billy Burge and Don Jordan, the co-chairman of Let's Build It Together, the 
pro-arena campaign group. Opposing them were Metropolitan Coalition President 
DeWayne Lark and conservative activist Bruce Hotze. 
"Les Alexander gets all the benefits," Hotze said. "If this was a marriage it 
wouldn't last a week. It is not a good deal." 
Burge retorted: "Mr. Hotze, you sound like Bill Clinton -- a half-truth is 
the blackest lie of all." 
After a few of Hotze's anti-arena comments received applause from the 
audience, Jordan chided some of those gathered. 
"You can be very confused and ... clap about the statements that are being 
made to you that aren't exactly accurate," he said. "That is one of the 
benefits of being here today. You can look beyond some of the advertising 
that has gone up, 90 percent of which is incorrect." 
Later, the event got even more colorful after KTRK-Channel 13 anchor Bob 
Boudreaux asked anti-arena activists what they knew about the deal that 
fiscally conservative U.S. Rep. Bill Archer, R-Houston, didn't know. Archer 
is appearing in the pro-arena campaigns' most recent television commercials. 
"I think the pro-arena campaign has been a Clinton-esque campaign of 
misstatements and misleading, and I think they have told people that the 
Rockets are going to pay their fair share," Hotze said. "They pay nothing up 
front. I think if Bill Archer knew all the facts, Bill Archer would not come 
out and endorse this." 
Jordan responded: "That's an incredible statement. The only thing I know 
about that might be more incredible than what you just heard is if anybody 
out there believed it. Bill Archer knows what's going on about this arena 
down here." 
Opponents accused pro-arena forces of doling out corporate welfare at 
taxpayers' expense, while proponents repeatedly criticized arena opponents' 
statements as misleading and inaccurate. 
Backers of the arena say it would spur downtown development, strengthen the 
economy, boost good feelings about the city and cement Houston's position as 
a world-class city. 
Lark said that he supports a new arena, but that taxpayers shouldn't have to 
foot the bill -- especially when a billionaire sports team owner stands to 
benefit the most from the deal.

Briefs: City and state 
Azurix shareholder sues over deal's price
A shareholder has sued Azurix Corp. and its parent Enron Corp. on grounds 
that a $275 million plan to take Azurix private undervalues the water 
company's shares. 
Azurix spokeswoman Diane Bazelides said the company has not been served with 
the papers and therefore is unable to comment on the lawsuit. 
Houston-based Enron last week offered to provide financing to let Azurix 
purchase its shares at $7 apiece. Enron owns a little more than a third of 
the water company it created two years ago and controls another third through 
an investor group called Atlantic Water Trust. 
In one of six lawsuits filed in Delaware Chancery Court, Azurix shareholder 
Thomas Turberg says Enron and Azurix's directors have violated their duties 
to shareholders by agreeing to purchase the shares at a price that is less 
than the water company is worth. 
The defendants are trying to use their control of Azurix to force 
shareholders "to sell their equity interest in Azurix at an unfair price, and 
deprive Azurix's public shareholders of maximum value to which they are 
entitled," the suit says. 
Turberg asks the judge to grant class-action status to his case, stop the 
transaction and award damages and legal fees. 
Enron shares rose $1.19 to $83.25, while Azurix shares fell 19 cents to 
$6.06. Azurix's shares have fallen more than 80 percent since Enron took the 
company public last year.

'Big-picture' strategy gives C.I. Global edge Growth-oriented, diversified

Lured by historically stronger returns and a recent increase in RRSP 
foreign-content limits, Canadian investors have poured a record $39-billion 
into foreign securities so far this year. 
And thanks to some excellent performance and strong brand loyalty among 
financial advisers, a fair chunk of this exodus has been heading into several 
funds sponsored by C.I. Mutual Funds Inc.
Consider the $3.2-billion C.I. Global Fund. Under the tutelage of long-time 
manager William Sterling, the 14-year-old fund returned 21.1 per cent in 
1997, 26.2 per cent in 1998 and 37.1 per cent last year. 
Over the 10 years ended Sept. 30, these strong numbers propelled it to a 
stellar compound average annual rate of return of 17.7 per cent, well above 
the 13.7-per-cent average of its global equity-fund peers. 
Against a backdrop of rising inflation, technology jitters and potential 
interest-rate hikes, however, the fund has been struggling more recently. 
Year to date, it has delivered barely a break-even return. 
Despite this recent blip, though, fund analyst Stephen Kangas, managing 
editor of Toronto-based Fundlibrary.com, calls mammoth C.I. Global a 
"must-have" fund. 
"Bill Sterling's big-picture strategy and [co-manager] Stephen Waite's 
stock-picking have worked to put this fund not only in the first quartile but 
right up there as a core offering within the global category," Mr. Kangas 
says. 
Mr. Sterling and his team, most recently working for C.I. through independent 
Credit Suisse Asset Management LLC, now have a major stake in a new 
portfolio-management partnership, New York-based C.I. Global Advisors LLP, 
that manages several funds in the Toronto-based C.I. family. 
This new partnership "means the management group is in place for the long 
haul," says Mr. Kangas, who favours arrangements where managers have equity 
stakes. 
Driven by the big-picture themes outlined in his appealing book, 
Boomernomics, and using discounted cash flow as his primary yardstick, Mr. 
Sterling has created a growth-oriented, broadly diversified fund that seldom 
has much in common with its benchmark, the Morgan Stanley World index. 
It generally contains about 140 stocks, with the largest holding limited to 
roughly 3 per cent of the portfolio and the top 10 stocks representing no 
more than 20 per cent of the pie. "You really can't do it any other way," Mr. 
Sterling says. "When it comes right down to it, nobody really knows who's 
going to win all the battles. With technology in particular, you have to take 
a much broader view." 
Similarly, although currency movements are always a factor in any global 
fund, Mr. Sterling makes little attempt to hedge his dollar exposure, 
preferring to use it as another key criterion in determining his country 
choices. "We're much more likely to back an exporter who's going to benefit 
from a sliding currency than to try and play the currency itself. That's 
really where you're going to benefit." 
Although still sporting a positive outlook for the long term, Mr. Sterling 
has been trying to reduce the risk in the portfolio in recent months. Despite 
the increased promise of an economic soft landing in North America, he still 
worries that U.S. corporate profits may fail to meet expectations. 
"We've been feeling a bit defensive for a while now. As long as central banks 
are raising rates -- and we think one or two quarter-point hikes in the U.S. 
are still likely -- you're going to see continued volatility and uncertainty, 
particularly in U.S. technology stocks." 
Consequently, he's reduced the fund's holdings in the United States and, to a 
lesser extent, in Europe. Right now, the fund has 52 per cent of its stocks 
in the United States, 21 per cent in Europe and 7 per cent in Japan, with 
roughly 13 per cent in cash. That's a far cry from the beginning of the year, 
when the fund had roughly two-thirds of its money south of the border and 
very little cash on hand. 
Over the past 18 months, U.S. tech stocks have swung dramatically, almost 
twice as much as the rest of the market. As a result, the securities of many 
technology companies are priced more like options than stocks, Mr. Sterling 
says. "And that means likely more volatility, rather than less. Prudent asset 
allocation suggests that you diversify away from an asset class as its 
volatility increases. Despite the very real merits of the sector, investors 
shouldn't have all their eggs in some high-tech basket." 
Although technology still plays a significant role in the fund -- big 
holdings include PMC Sierra Inc., Broadcom Inc., Vodafone Airtouch PLC and 
Cisco Systems Inc. -- Mr. Sterling quickly points to what he calls "the 
leopards" within the fund's largest holdings. 
Companies such as Corning Inc. are an increasing force in fibre optics, and 
ones such as utility giant Enron Corp. are "changing their spots and looking 
for new ways to succeed. But, unlike many younger tech companies, they still 
make money in the process," he says. 
For conservative investors looking to diversify their holdings, the fund is 
"definitely a core fund for most portfolios," Mr. Kangas says. 
"Put this C.I. fund together with, say, a strong offering like AGF 
International Value, and you've got an excellent foundation to build upon. 
Lower risk, strong returns, broad diversification -- I think this fund has 
really delivered on all these fronts. Highly recommended."

Calif Generators See FERC Ruling As Step, Not Solution
By Christina Cheddar

11/01/2000
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- California's power generators think federal regulators 
took a big step toward improving what they see as a flawed market for 
wholesale electricity, but may have stopped short of total solution.
Earlier Wednesday, a committee formed by the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission released recommendations to revamp the Golden State's power 
market. 
The recommendations sprung from a probe conducted by the committee that 
sought to explain why California power prices tripled this past summer. 
Overall, companies supplying power to the state applauded the committee's 
finding that market manipulation by power generators in the state wasn't to 
blame, as some consumer groups had charged. 
FERC is the third agency to agree that there was no price collusion in the 
market this summer, said Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) spokesman Tom Williams. 
Company officials also said they were pleased by the agency's recommendation 
that California should allow its three utilities to buy power from a variety 
of suppliers and buy power in the forward markets. 
Previously, the utilities were required to buy and sell all power through the 
state's Power Exchange at market prices. 
The previous requirement, which bound the utilities to one supplier, 
effectively created another monopoly, said Enron Corp. (ENE) spokesman Mark 
Palmer. 
"Utilities should be able to manage their own price risk," Palmer said. 
Williams Cos. (WMB) spokesman Tim Thuston agreed. He said his company had 
been advocating this change, and was pleased to see it included in the 
agency's recommendations. 
However, generators did raise concerns over a so-called soft cap. Under the 
provision, a supplier who sells power above $150 a megawatt would be entitled 
to receive the bidding price, however, the supplier would have to file 
several reports to the FERC. 
Previously, all bidders in a single-price auction had to pay the highest bid 
paid, which was otherwise known as the market clearing price. Under the 
committee's recommendation, the market clearing price will never exceed the 
$150/MW cap. 
The companies also were concerned about a provision that could lead to 
refunds after October 1. 
Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) spokesman John Stout a two-year refund window is "a 
cloud hanging over the market." 
During Stout's initial review of the voluminous FERC report, he said he 
wasn't able to determine exactly how the FERC would establish what is the 
right price for power. 
He said Reliant would be paying attention to this provision, which he said 
could have broad implications for the companies who operate in the state. 
Other officials also noted that sometimes power is traded several times 
before it reaches its end-users. In those cases, how would refunds be 
determined, officials asked. 
In sharing their initial reactions to the 100-page report, company officials 
agreed there is still much work to be done. Officials said they plan to make 
additional recommendations to the state's agencies in the days ahead. 
The changes in the California power market are sure to affect the strategies 
of the state's power generators. 
Enron has already decided to back off plans to install 300 megawatts of new 
generation in the state next spring, said Enron's Palmer. The generation was 
part of a project proposed by the California Independent System Operator. 
Enron and 13 other companies are in negotiations to build the capacity, which 
would have operated during periods of peak demand, when prices are the 
highest. 
Palmer said the lingering uncertainty in the state's power market makes the 
project less financially attractive. 
Still, other financial opportunities could be created by the proposed 
regulations. Palmer said Enron's price-risk management operations could get a 
boost because the state's utilities will now be free to purchase power in the 
forward markets. 
Other trading companies also see an opportunity there, but none would 
estimate its potential value. 
Duke Energy spokesman Tom Williams emphasized the Charlotte, N.C., company's 
commitment to California. Duke, which supplies 4% of California's power, has 
already made a significant investment in the state, he said. 
Duke expects to continue to spend money in the state. For example, Duke will 
proceed with its plans to build its Moss Landing power plant in Monterey 
County. 
As for other power projects, Williams wouldn't provide specific details. 
Still, many believe additional capacity is needed to meet the state's growing 
power needs and lower prices. 
According to Williams, the FERC recommendations don't do enough to encourage 
new generation to be built in the state. 
"I think the next two months are full of uncertainty," Williams said. He 
added, as long as uncertainty persists in the market, companies won't want to 
make the investment. 
This point was echoed by other company officials. 
As the companies continue to review the order and make recommendations, it is 
likely officials will focus future debate on the soft cap and refund 
provisions of Wednesday's proposals. 
Still, the companies appeared encouraged that progress has been made toward 
correcting the state's markets. 
And a lot is at stake, according to Reliant's Stout. Not only is the 
company's future strategy in California riding on these decisions, but states 
like Nevada have slowed deregulation efforts in order to watch the events 
unfolding in California, Stout said. 
Stout said now is the time for consumer groups, power suppliers, utilities 
and the state agencies to come together "to get this power market fixed."

IN THE MONEY: Enron Looks To Un-Dip Its Toe From Water
By Carol S. Remond

11/01/2000
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Sometimes it's easier to peddle a hard-sell when you 
don't have everyone looking over your shoulder.
That's what appears to be the case with Enron Corp. (ENE) and what it's doing 
with its majority stake in Azurix Corp. (AZX), the water company Enron 
partially spun-off to the public two years ago. 
In an unusual transaction, Enron has offered to loan Azurix $275 million so 
that it can buy back its stock from the public for $7 a share - that is, any 
and all shares owned by everyone except for those controlled by Enron. 
Following some fancy financial footwork involving trusts that own some of the 
Azurix stock on its behalf, the Houston, Texas energy and commodity trading 
company appears to be priming Azurix for a sale after failing to clinch a 
deal the more traditional way. 
(In a letter to Azurix, Enron indicated that so far, four potential buyers 
have presented themselves. But the top suitor, who offered $7 a share, seems 
to have had a change of heart after taking an in-depth look at the company). 
Details of the latest scheme are scant. All that is clear so far is that 
Enron has hired Lehman Brothers as an adviser regarding its plans for Azurix. 
Although Enron declined to comment on its plans, people familiar with the 
matter suggested that a complex transaction is now in the offing. 
One option Enron had was to do this in the more traditional manner: Buy back 
Azurix shares itself. But that posed a problem. In doing so, Enron would have 
owned more than 50% of the water company, forcing it to consolidate all of 
Azurix' financials on its balance sheet - including a healthy $1.3 billion in 
debt. 
Instead, with a little wave of a financial wand, it appears Enron has found a 
creative way around that problem. 
Here's how it works: Enron loans $275 million to the management of Azurix so 
it can repurchase the non-Enron related shares from the marketplace. That 
leaves an entity called the Atlantic Water Trust continuing to hold 67% of 
Azurix' shares. Atlantic Water is half-owned by Enron and another trust 
called Marlin Trust Co. Enron has voting rights on Marlin's shares. 
A person familiar with the situation suggested that the transaction, which 
has yet to be made public, would include some form of sweetner to entice 
management to back an Enron-arranged sale of Azurix to a third party. 
"Instead of being a growth-oriented play on deregulation and privatization in 
the water utility industry, Azurix will become a sort of quasi utility 
company," said Anatol Feygin, J.P. Morgan's Enron analyst. "Once that is 
done, Enron will be able to cut overhead and development activity and look 
for a buyer." 
An Azurix spokeswoman said Enron's offer is under consideration. She declined 
to comment on Enron's assertion that the water company had retained two 
advisers earlier this year to evaluate its strategic alternatives. 
What's clear so far is that if Enron succeeds in taking Azurix private, 
streamlining the decision making process by excluding private shareholders 
and the need to report to the Securities and Exchange Commission, it won't be 
able to sell the water business in parts and would likely look for a buyer 
for the whole lot. 
That's because the equity of Azurix's crown jewel, U.K.'s Wessex Water Ltd. 
is used to back a GBP400 million credit facility. 
"They can't sell Wessex first because to do so they would have to take that 
facility out," said John Kennedy, a utility analyst at Standard & Poor's. 
Azurix acquired Wessex in October 1998 for $2.4 billion. People familiar with 
the matter suggested that Enron is now in the process of re-evaluating 
Wessex, as well as smaller assets in Latin America. Analysts said that Wessex 
may now bring in about $1.8 billion. (Taking out long-term debt that comes to 
about $4.25 a share). 
So why is Enron so eager to get out of the water business? 
Trouble has been brewing for a while. In September, following months of 
Azurix falling short of analysts' earnings, its high-profile chief financial 
officer, Rebecca Mark, simultaneously resigned from her position and stepped 
down from Enron's board. 
The fact is that Azurix has fallen short of Enron's expectations. The 
energy-trading giant appears to have misjudged the speed of privatization in 
the water and waste-water industry. And now with projects behind, revenues 
have been slow, some $1.3 billion in long-term debt has accumulated and Enron 
appears to have given up on its plans. 
At the end, Enron's seconds may soon fuel ongoing utility consolidation in 
Europe. As least four large European water companies are believed to be 
potential buyers: France's Vivendi's Generale des Eaux and Suez-Lyonnaise des 
Eaux and Germany's E.On and RWE. 
The price of Azurix shares slumped as low as $3.37 earlier this month, far 
below its spring 1999 initial public offering price of $19. Azurix' stock was 
recently trading at about $6.125. - Carol S. Remond; Dow Jones Newswires;

USA: Transwestern N.M. gas line cut 25 pct on train derail.

11/01/2000
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2000.

SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Gas flows through a Transwestern (TW) 
natural gas pipeline in New Mexico have been cut by about 250 million cubic 
feet, or 25 percent, while the line is checked for damage after derailed 
train cars fell near the line, a Transwestern spokesman said Wednesday. 
The freight train derailment occurred late Sunday but the company was not 
informed the train cars had fallen near the gas line until Monday, when gas 
flows were reduced, he said.
The TW pipeline, in northwestern New Mexico, feeds California gas markets and 
normally operates at around one billion cubic feet a day. 
The spokesman for Transwestern Pipeline Co., a subsidiary of Houston-based 
Enron Corp. , was unable to say when the line would be back at normal 
capacity. 
No one was believed to have been hurt in the accident, he added.

US Natural Gas Cash Prices End Up On Arbitrage Spreads

11/01/2000
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- U.S. natural gas physical prices mostly rose Wednesday 
with the New York Mercantile Exchange futures board, but still held a 15- to 
16-cent differential to the Nymex, one of the largest seen this year, traders 
said. 
The cost of carrying gas to storage blew out the differential, a Houston 
trader said, as some pipelines refused to allow more gas into storage at this 
late date. "Storage (and arbitrage) wasn't an option," a trader said.
That stagnated some non-incremental buying dead in its tracks, he said. He 
expects the 15- to 16-cent differential to continue on Thursday. 
Also, in the West, gas was looking for a home after some transportation had 
to be redirected because of a force majeure on Enron's Transwestern East of 
Thoreau line. 
A train derailment in New Mexico had damaged the line, cutting back and 
shifting gas deliveries from the East to the West, traders said. 
The Nymex December futures gas contract settled Wednesday at $4.686 per 
million British thermal units, up 19.6 cents as traders brushed aside an 
apparently bearish American Gas Association storage report and bought gas in 
preparation for possible wintry forecasts. 
Although predictions were for a build in the 60-65 billion cubic feet range, 
the AGA said 70 Bcf was added to storage last week, still within some 
expectations and considered slightly bearish. The anticipated total fill of 
about 2.7 trillion cubic feet has been a factor in driving prices down these 
last few weeks, marketers said. 
Swing physical gas for November at the benchmark Henry Hub in south Louisiana 
rose 4 cents-8 cents to a $4.32-$4.48/MMBtu range. November index at the 
Henry Hub is $4.50/MmBtu. 
Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line at Station 65 deals rose 2 cents on the bid, 
but fell 4 cents on the offer to a $4.35-$4.44 range. Index is seen at $4.51. 
At Katy in East Texas, buyers paid $4.25-$4.39, up 1 cent on the bid, down 3 
cents on the offer from the Transwestern outage. Index is seen at $4.43. 
At the Waha hub, prices closed at $4.17-$4.27, down 5 cents-10 cents, also as 
a result of the Transwestern outage. November index for the first of the 
month is at $4.50, flat to the Henry Hub. 
Prices in the West and California and New York moved above $5.00, traders 
said. The California Border index is put at $5.19; PG&E Citygate at $5.33; 
Transcontinental New York Zone 6 line at $5.10 and Texas Eastern's M3 line at 
$4.96, traders said.

PLEASE DON'T SHOOT THE MESSENGER
DEREGULATION NOT THE PROBLEM
By Philip R. O'Connor. Philip R. O'Connor is president of Chicago-based
NewEnergy Midwest, the leading provid-er of...
August 17, 2000
The firestorm raging in the San Diego area that devours homes and likely
will be followed in the spring by mudslides that will carry homes into
ravines isn't what Midwesterners are used to.
But there's no blaming Bad Ol' El Nino this time. The firestorm that has
everyone pointing fingers has to do with electric power shortages, rolling
blackout warnings and summer utility bills that have soared two and
threefold over last summer's.
To avoid "wearing the jacket," (in our Chicago patois), California's
voter-shy public officials and utility executives are blaming Bad Ol'
Deregulation.
Understandably, but regrettably, the media have tended to follow the story
line that electricity deregulation is to blame. Such stories could well
create worry that deregulation in Illinois and elsewhere in the Midwest will
lead to San Diego-style problems.
If anything, deregulation in the Midwest is avoiding the fundamental errors
California made, not only during the two years of deregulation but during
the decade preceding deregulation. In the summer of 1998 the Midwest had
some close calls of its own when triple-digit temperatures drove wholesale
electric prices for certain midday hours to as much as 100 times the normal
price.
The reigning theories in the California panic today are much like the myths
that emerged in the Midwest back then. There were allegations of price
gouging by power producers and warnings that we were moving too fast toward
deregulation--even though there was no retail deregulation and competition
in the Midwest at that time. In fact, it was the lack of retail,
customer-level competition that allowed the wholesale market to fly
completely out of control. Since 1998, the Midwest has begun to get its act
together.
In California, the initial reactions are to put the toothpaste back in the
tube and to burn the witch. But my native state still will need to face up
to its legacy of thinking, "I'll do that tomorrow," while at the same time
trying to regulate free markets as if there were no tomorrow.
Deregulation, which started in California in the spring of 1998, is but a
messenger of painful truths. The truth is that the chickens are coming home
to roost and that any attempt to retreat into the past will produce more
power shortages and higher prices.
There are some big differences between Illinois, the first state in the
Midwest to open up the electric network for customer choice, and California,
the first state in the nation to open up the network for competition.
In spite of a booming California economy spurring massive increases in
electrical demand, not one new power plant came on line during the
1990s--and none since. California thought it could rely on power plants in
other western states, but those plants are now serving growing loads in
their own areas.
In Illinois and elsewhere in the Midwest, new clean natural gas-fired plants
are able to serve during periods of peak demand. Gov. Ryan has convened a
committee to review state and local government handling of proposed "peaker"
plants. It seems likely to keep strict environmental standards in place
while helping to identify ways to reduce uncertainties, speed up
approvals--or disapprovals--and thereby reduce costs and improve power
reliability.
While the Midwest is realizing the benefit of newly constructed transmission
lines that allow access by Chicago and other areas to competitive power
supplies, many areas in California, remain too dependent on just a few local
power plants.
In California, once a utility finishes collecting "stranded-cost" charges to
pay off investments in nuclear plants and high-cost power contracts, price
caps for plain, old utility service based on rates in place prior to
deregulation are lifted. That's why San Diego Gas & Electric, the first
utility to finish collecting stranded costs, merely had the job of acquiring
power in the wholesale market and passing along the cost to customers who
had not switched to new competitive suppliers.
In Illinois and Ohio, by contrast, utility rates are capped at reduced
levels for at least five more years for customers who do not switch.
Illinois and the Midwest have stayed away from such Rube Goldberg
contraptions as the California Power Exchange that was supposed to serve as
a sort of mandatory clearing house for wholesale power transactions but
instead became a sort of private regulator that regulated no better than the
government used to.
The rules of the game in the Golden State could not have been more skewed
against giving opportunities for customers to switch to new competitors or
to take other precautions to avoid high summer power prices during an
unexpected heat wave. My NewEnergy colleagues in California have faced an
ever shifting set of increasingly inhospitable rules. In Illinois, utilities
and new competitive suppliers, have had more flexibility to offer products
that let customers choose between fixed prices that balance out the ups and
downs of the market or prices that float with the seasons.
Importantly, Illinois regulators have been reasonably quick to approve
proposals that let utilities and new suppliers, such as my company, work out
contracts with commercial and industrial customers to reduce their
electrical demand during peak summer hours in return for payments. Such
arrangements, less available in California, are key to avoiding blackouts
and blunting big-price spikes.
As chairman of the Illinois Commerce Commission from 1983 through 1985, I
remember when the costs of new nuclear plants showed up in electric
rates--today's stranded costs. I know what California utility commissioners
must be going through as they seek solutions for problems with roots going
back at least a decade. They'd better have thick skins and nimble minds.
I'll never forget former Gov. Jim Thompson, whose 1982 campaign I co-managed
and who appointed me to the ICC, saying, after several big rate increases,
the political equivalent of "I've never seen this man before in my entire
life." Having been yelled at on the bus by angry consumers a few times on
the way to the office, I could only be happy that Thompson had the good
political judgment to say, "I know not the man," on his own without my
prompting. I felt proud, not betrayed.

Temecula, Calif., Forms Committee to Study Electric Deregulation

California

Reporter (TM) 

TEMECULA, Calif.--Shocked by San Diego County's experience with skyrocketing 
electric rates this past summer, the City Council has formed a committee to 
study ways of shielding Temecula residents from similar jolts when the 
deregulation wave washes into Riverside County in a couple of years.

The council appointed colleagues Jeff Comerchero and Mike Naggar to serve on 
the electric needs committee, scheduled to hold its first meeting later this 
month. 

"Deregulation is something that is supposed to be friendly to customers," 
said Mayor Jeff Stone.

It turned out to be anything but these past few months as temperatures 
soared, sending demand for electricity to power air conditioners and monthly 
electric bills for neighbors to the south through the roof. The rest of the 
state watched in amazement as the 1.2 million customers of San Diego 
Gas&Electric sweated through a long, hot summer, serving essentially as 
California's guinea pigs in the statewide experiment with electric 
deregulation. They were the first to feel the effects of wildly fluctuating 
wholesale rates passed directly on to customers.

"We're concerned that deregulation may have that sort of effect on Temecula 
and our residents, and we would like to try to avoid Temecula residents 
getting a double or triple bump on their bills," Naggar said.

"The electric deregulation took San Diego officials by surprise," he said. 
"They were asleep. We now know what can happen, and we don't want to be 
caught asleep."

One of the things the committee will look into is whether it would make sense 
for Temecula to try to contract with an electric provider to bring in 
relatively cheap power for its 54,000 residents. The area is served by 
Southern California Edison.

San Marcos and Chula Vista have held talks with the Enron Corp. about the 
possibility of providing power to their residents to hold down rates. Those 
cities are studying the experience of Palm Springs, which in 1997 contracted 
with Portland Gas and Electric to provide residents with a flat rate for 
electricity for five years.

Whether such an arrangement would work for Temecula is anyone's guess, Naggar 
said.

"If it turns out we can't do anything, at least we've gotten everybody's 
attention," he said.

Naggar said the council has yet to form a committee charged with monitoring 
San Diego Gas&Electric's proposal to string new lines across huge metal 
towers through Southwest County, to relieve San Diego's electric rate 
explosion. Cities and communities throughout Southwest County have rallied 
against the project, saying they don't want the visual blight and perceived 
health threat from having fat power lines buzzing 150 feet overhead.

The San Diego-based utility is expected to name a preferred route soon.

"I get about five or six e-mails a day on the preferred route subject," 
Naggar said. "It is a hot, hot, hot issue. But there is nothing for us to do 
until they make a move. If they decide to go down the middle of Temecula, I 
can assure you we'll make a move. If they decide to go through the (Santa 
Rosa) Plateau, I can assure you we'll discuss it."

Temecula council members have been unanimously opposed to bringing new power 
lines through, or near, the city since the project was unveiled about two 
months ago. And, in September, City Manager Shawn Nelson sent off a letter to 
the utility expressing the city's opposition to routes through the pristine 
hills of De Luz to the west and the verdant Wine Country to the east as well.

  California Lawmakers Vote to Limit Power Costs
  By Rebecca Smith

  09/01/2000
  The Wall Street Journal
  Page A4
  (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

  California lawmakers voted to extend modest relief to San Diego residents
burdened with
  high electricity bills and set the groundwork for faster construction of
badly needed power
  plants. They stopped short, however, of passing legislation that would
roll back retail power
  rates to levels seen prior to deregulation .

  Late Wednesday, lawmakers sent a bill to Gov. Gray Davis that limits to
6.5 cents per
  kilowatt hour the amount that small customers of San Diego Gas & Electric
Co. can be
  charged. The utility is allowed to add power-delivery and other
reasonable costs to that
  commodity price.

  The price, equivalent to a bulk power cost of $65 per megawatt hour, is
far higher than the
  average price of power for 27 of the 31 months in which California's
market has been
  deregulated. But in June and July, the average price of power obtained by
the utility from a
  state-sanctioned energy auction rose to 12 cents and 10.5 cents,
respectively, compared
  with the 2.3 cents and 2.8 cents charged in those months a year earlier.

  Passed directly through to customers,the resulting bills sparked a near
mutiny. The
  rate-cap measure applies to residential and small commercial customers,
as well as to
  schools and hospitals.

  In addition to the rate cap, which can be adjusted upward or downward by
the California
  Public Utilities Commission until December 2002, the legislature
earmarked $150 million of
  general-fund revenue, which can be used to subsidize San Diego power
costs if they greatly
  exceed the 6.5-cents-per-kilowatt-hour rate. For now, the utility would
be expected to make
  up any difference between revenue collected and the actual cost.

  Steve Baum, chairman of Sempra Energy, parent of San Diego Gas & Electric
Co., said the
  rate-cap measure is "deeply flawed" because it limits the amount prices
can rise but sets
  no floor. That means any shortfall could grow -- without a mechanism for
customers to pay
  it down -- until the end of the rate-cap period, which could last until
December 2002 or
  December 2003.

  Mr. Baum said Sempra stands to suffer an undercollection of perhaps $664
million, provided
  future prices approximate the New York Mercantile Exchange forward prices
through
  December 2002. "It's irreparably damaging to Sempra," he said because it
"creates
  tremendous uncertainty" that makes it hard for the San Diego energy
company to finance
  new projects such as a new transmission line.

  The legislature also appeared likely to approve a bill speeding up the
permit process for the
  construction of new power plants, in part by beefing up staffs of
regulatory agencies that
  review the plans.

  California Lawmakers Vote to Limit Power Costs
  By Rebecca Smith

  09/01/2000
  The Wall Street Journal

  California lawmakers voted to extend modest relief to San Diego residents
burdened with
  high electricity bills and set the groundwork for faster construction of
badly needed power
  plants. They stopped short, however, of passing legislation that would
roll back retail power
  rates to levels seen prior to deregulation .

  Late Wednesday, lawmakers sent a bill to Gov. Gray Davis that limits to
6.5 cents per
  kilowatt hour the amount that small customers of San Diego Gas & Electric
Co. can be
  charged. The utility is allowed to add power-delivery and other
reasonable costs to that
  commodity price.

  The price, equivalent to a bulk power cost of $65 per megawatt hour, is
far higher than the
  average price of power for 27 of the 31 months in which California's
market has been
  deregulated. But in June and July, the average price of power obtained by
the utility from a
  state-sanctioned energy auction rose to 12 cents and 10.5 cents,
respectively, compared
  with the 2.3 cents and 2.8 cents charged in those months a year earlier.

  Passed directly through to customers,the resulting bills sparked a near
mutiny. The
  rate-cap measure applies to residential and small commercial customers,
as well as to
  schools and hospitals.

  In addition to the rate cap, which can be adjusted upward or downward by
the California
  Public Utilities Commission until December 2002, the legislature
earmarked $150 million of
  general-fund revenue, which can be used to subsidize San Diego power
costs if they greatly
  exceed the 6.5-cents-per-kilowatt-hour rate. For now, the utility would
be expected to make
  up any difference between revenue collected and the actual cost.

  Steve Baum, chairman of Sempra Energy, parent of San Diego Gas & Electric
Co., said the
  rate-cap measure is "deeply flawed" because it limits the amount prices
can rise but sets
  no floor. That means any shortfall could grow -- without a mechanism for
customers to pay
  it down -- until the end of the rate-cap period, which could last until
December 2002 or
  December 2003.

  Mr. Baum said Sempra stands to suffer an undercollection of perhaps $664
million, provided
  future prices approximate the New York Mercantile Exchange forward prices
through
  December 2002. "It's irreparably damaging to Sempra," he said because it
"creates
  tremendous uncertainty" that makes it hard for the San Diego energy
company to finance
  new projects such as a new transmission line.

  The legislature also appeared likely to approve a bill speeding up the
permit process for the
  construction of new power plants, in part by beefing up staffs of
regulatory agencies that
  review the plans.

CRECers,

Note attached SDG&E press release calling on Governor Davis to use his
emergency powers to remedy the accelerating energy crisis by taking a
number of actions, e.g., directing local air districts to temporarily lift
emissions limits for in-state power plants so that the plants which have
met or exceeded their air-emissions limits can run.  In addition, SDG&E
reported it made an emergency filing with FERC requesting an immediate
reinstatement of price caps on interstate natural gas pipeline
transportation to the CA border.

Market Manipulation or Fair Earnings in California? Enron, Dynegy Report
Huge Profits
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
As energy companies report third quarter earnings, many active as wholesale
providers are announcing huge profits. For instance, Enron Corp. and Dynegy
have both reported over-the-top earnings for the third quarter, reaping
the benefits of skyrocketing energy prices and a continued focus on asset
expansion. Both companies benefited from high energy prices this summer,
especially in California where electricity prices soared to record levels,
resulting in a doubling and tripling of the generation part of power bills
for San Diego Gas & Electric Co. (SDG&E) customers. At the same time that
these companies are reporting huge earnings, accusations have been leveled
that generators and trading companies "manipulated the production of power
from June through August to create a false shortage and push up prices."

ANALYSIS: First, let me say that I am not picking on Enron and Dynegy.
They just happened to release their Q3 earnings comparatively early, openin=
g
themselves up for evaluation. According to the California Energy Commission=
,
other non-utility owners or traders of power in California include Calpine,
Destec, Duke, Reliant, Southern, and Williams, who altogether own about
40 percent of the generation in the state (compared to the 15 percent owned
by California's three investor-owned utility companies). As additional
3Q financial statements are released, I would expect any company that is
active on the wholesale market to report a significant increase in earnings=
,
reflective of the summer price volatility. Even a mid-size utility like
the Public Service Company of New Mexico (PNM) has posted whopping profits
for Q3, which it attributed directly to the "scalding wholesale electric
market in the Western United States."

With that said, let's take a look at the numbers that we have for the big
players, which are startling. Enron's recurring net income, up 31 percent,
rose to $292 million, or 34 cents a share, compared with 1999 third quarter
earnings of $223 million, or 27 cents a share. By its own admission, sales
in Enron's four business units=01*wholesale energy operations and services,
retail energy services, transportation and distribution, and broadband
services=01*grew nearly $30 billion in the third quarter alone. The income
before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) reported by Enron's
wholesale group increased 66 percent in 3Q to $627 million from $378 millio=
n
a year ago. The commodity sales and services business increased IBIT to
$404 million in 3Q compared to $172 million last year. CEO Kenneth Lay
says he is "very optimistic about the continued strong growth" of the compa=
ny.
Over at Dynegy, they are singing the same happy tune. Dynegy reported=20
recurring
net income of $176.5 million, or 55 cents a share, compared with Dynegy
/ Illinova pro forma recurring net income of $96.5 million, or 32 cents
per share, for the same period last year. Much of this growth is coming
from Dynegy Marketing and Trade, whose reported net income increased to
$141.9 million=01*80 percent of the company's consolidated net income.

While neither Enron nor Dynegy has mentioned California in their explanatio=
ns
of the strong Q3 earnings, clearly the high prices in the state must have
played a large role in the companies' profits. I think most everyone was
expecting any company active in wholesale trading to show strong numbers
in the third quarter, based on the high prices in California alone, but
the extent of the increase is really stunning.

The short answer for the price spikes has been that demand in the state
increased to unanticipated highs, while supply became stretched to meet
the power needs. Going a step further, limited transmission lines, the
fact that no new (significant) power plants have been built in almost two
decades, and a 3-percent increase in demand drove costs up in California
instead of down. Exacerbating the already tight supplies was the fact that
some 2,220 MW of generation, mostly in Southern California, was unavailable
during the summer months due to power plant mechanical failures. Plus,
growing demand in Arizona and lower hydroelectric production in the Pacific
Northwest also contributed to the squeeze in supplies on which California
could rely.

Customers of SDG&E were hit hardest of all as the utility had paid off
its stranded costs, removing a rate freeze and exposing customers to=20
market-based
prices. Customers of the other two California IOUs=01*SCE and PG&E=01*were =
protected
because they were still under a rate freeze. However, the utilities themsel=
ves
claim to have also suffered from the price spikes as they buy a great deal
of their power on the wholesale market. Due to limited supplies, PG&E and
SCE were forced to pay market prices for power but yet were unable to incre=
ase
their customers' rates. For instance, PG&E claims it was paying $0.18/KWh
for energy when by law it could only charge customers $0.055/KWh, leaving
it with an estimated $2.7 billion debt that it is petitioning the CPUC
to bill back to customers.

All of this has been characterized as the "fiasco in California," leaving
many to conclude that the market in the state is not workably competitive.
The only clear winners in the situation were the wholesale providers, who
appeared to simply benefit from the low supply and high demand cycles that
drove California this summer.

The California Power Exchange, the state's power auction through which
all power is traded,  issued a recent report acknowledging that, while
the state's electricity market is severely flawed, it could find "no patter=
n
of abuse by any group, individual or company participating in the state's
main electricity auction." Rather, the California PX maintains that the
price spikes were caused by the high demand for electricity, a lack of
new generation, higher natural-gas prices, and a drop in out-of-state=20
electricity
imports.

Yet, a new report initiated by a group of utilities in the Pacific Northwes=
t,
casts doubt on this and suggests that wholesale providers actually caused
the high energy prices. A Portland-based firm that conducted a private
investigation of the California market asserts that the state had plenty
of electricity generation this summer, and that wholesale providers withhel=
d
power to create artificially high prices. Specifically, the report=01*writt=
en
by economist and utility industry consultant Robert McCollough=01*says Cali=
fornia
in fact had a 32-percent reserve margin, despite the high prices and the
fact that the California ISO issued repeated power emergencies all summer
claiming that the state was in a critical power shortage. In addition,
McCollough claims that demand in California was actually lower than what
was forecast by the Western Systems Coordinating Council. Using EPA data
to suggest that power plants ran below full capacity during peak times
last summer, McCollough accuses generators of voluntarily lowering their
production to drive up prices=01*essentially creating a market power situat=
ion
in which energy buyers are left with little choice but to pay exorbitant
prices.

The report cites Dynegy as an example. Dynegy and NRG Energy Inc. are invol=
ved
in a joint venture called Cabrillo Power, which oversees the operation
of the Encina power plant in Carlsbad, Calif.  McCollough reports that
the Encina plant operated at well below its full capacity for much of June,
even though wholesale prices were well above the generating plant's cost
of production. A representative from Cabrillo Power denied that the Encina
plant had been used to game the system in this way, and stated that, in
fact, the plant was often in danger of being shut down last summer due
to heavy output.

The response to both McCollough's and the PX's report has been very mixed.
One camp remains steadfast in claiming that western states did indeed have
a supply shortage this summer, which was the primary reason for the high
prices. People in this camp also claim that data from the EPA about power
plant emissions are questionable. On the other hand, other investigations
continue, following the same claim that generators have gamed the system.
The central question to be answered is whether or not companies that genera=
te
and/or trade power held back power from the California PX in order to force
heavier use of real-time markets at higher prices. Certainly, wholesale
providers knew that their power had to be dispatched and understandably
they were pleased by the high price of power this summer. Yet this is not
the same thing as purposeful manipulation, which has not been officially
determined. FERC and the CPUC have been examining these claims since July,
and the California attorney general also has initiated an investigation.
At this point, there is no clear answer=01*only a lot of questions and one
independent report that has made questionable assertions.

California Adopts Variable Pricing, Raising Ire of Generators, Traders
By Rebecca Smith
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

10/30/2000
The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -- In the latest attempt to fix California's troubled deregulated 
energy market, officials adopted a unique variable-pricing plan that already 
is being criticized by power generators and traders as unworkable and praised 
by utilities and consumers as much needed protection against gouging. 
Under the plan, adopted late last week by the governing board of the 
California Independent System Operator, or ISO, a quasipublic agency 
responsible for maintaining electricity reliability in the state, the cap on 
wholesale power will be reset hourly from about $65 per megawatt hour at 
low-demand times to no more than $250 an hour at periods of high demand. It 
was the third time this year that officials effectively lowered the price cap 
on wholesale electricity in a bid to contain -- so far unsuccessfully -- 
soaring total power costs.
The move underscores the chaotic atmosphere prevailing in California's power 
market after a two-year-old experiment in deregulation has come undone. In 
other deregulated markets such as New York and New England, prices are capped 
at $1000 per megawatt hour, which are intended to be low enough to prevent 
market abuse but high enough to give generators incentive to build new 
plants. California's system was supposed to work the same way. But because 
utilities in California divested themselves of the bulk of their plants but 
weren't allowed to lock in fixed-price supply contracts, unlike in the other 
markets, merchant generators have had much greater sway over prices here on 
the spot market, where most power trades. 
During the first nine months of the year, the average price of wholesale 
electricity was $90 per megawatt hour in California, triple the price of a 
year earlier. Even on cool days in October, the price generally has remained 
above $100 per megawatt hour. California utilities have lost money on those 
power purchases because their customers' rates are frozen at $54 to $65 per 
megawatt hour, far lower than the average price utilities have had to pay for 
that power. The deficits exceeded $5 billion in the June-to-September period. 
California utilities buy the power used by their customers from the 
state-sanctioned auctions administered by the ISO and a sister organization, 
the California Power Exchange. In New York and New England, by comparison, 
less than 20% of power is purchased from the spot markets because utilities 
there were able to sign the fixed-price contracts, which California utilities 
weren't allowed to do. The price-cap decision passed last week by a vote of 
13 to 10, primarily with support from utilities and board members 
representing consumer interests. It was pushed aggressively by Pacific Gas & 
Electric Co. and Southern California Edison, the state's two big 
investor-owned utilities that have gotten caught in the price-spike vise this 
year. 
Some ISO members say they had no choice but to support the measure to ratchet 
down price caps. "We're going after the windfall profits," said S. David 
Freeman, general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, 
who voted for the measure. "What we've got now is a market accustomed to 
ripping off the consumer. This can't be allowed to go on." 
But other experts said the hasty measure may make California's problems even 
worse. "The short-term regulatory fix is always to fix prices," said Pam 
Prairie, director of the Institute of Public Utilities at Michigan State 
University in East Lansing. "But there's a real danger you'll set prices too 
low and make your supply problems even worse." 
Other economists agreed. "At best, this is poorly administered cost-based 
regulation," said Frank Wolak, an economics professor at Stanford University 
who sits on an independent market-monitoring committee at the ISO. "At worst, 
it creates all sorts of perverse market incentives." 
For example, it may increase the problem of "megawatt laundering" on hot days 
in which in-state generators sell power to out-of-state customers who then 
sell it back into the state, effectively bypassing the cap. Likewise, it 
could encourage generators to build new plants outside of California, rather 
than where they are needed near its major cities, also to avoid the cap. In 
the end, it could increase stresses to the state's already overburdened 
transmission system. 
In fact, the decision already has brought to a halt the state's forward 
electricity market, which allows wholesale customers to sign contracts for 
power they will use in the future. The market had been trading as much as 
1,000 contracts a week. On Friday, there was practically no activity. 
"This decision shows the height of lunacy," said Rick Shapiro, a managing 
director at Enron Corp., the giant Houston-based energy trader. Mr. Shapiro 
said Enron and other generators will file appeals at the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission asking that the new pricing formula be rescinded. 
It is possible the FERC may throw out the pricing formula anyway. It is 
expected to issue a major order on Nov. 1 directing changes in California's 
market structure. That order will include its determination of the 
effectiveness of price caps. It also is expected to judge the merits of the 
governance structure at the ISO, which has lately been marked by infighting. 
Recently, consumer groups have charged that the ISO board has put the 
business interests of its members ahead of members' fiduciary duty to 
California residents. 
The most recent price-cap measure was approved over the objections of 
executives at the ISO whose job it will be to implement the formula. ISO 
Chief Executive Terry Winter said the measure is flawed because it doesn't 
take into account the amount of power available to the California market. Mr. 
Winter fears the caps will place the state at a disadvantage relative to 
neighboring states with no price caps. About 11 states are electrically 
interconnected in the West, meaning power can be moved between them and chase 
the highest prices. 
"We keep getting accused of making our market too complicated," Mr. Winter 
said. "Then along comes this proposal" with caps that would adjust repeatedly 
throughout the day, depending on demand.

Enron Corp. offered to lend Azurix Corp., an Enron spinoff, $275 million so 
that it could take itself private. 
Enron, which has been frustrated with the global water company's performance, 
suggested Friday that public shareholders receive a cash offer of $7 a share 
for their Azurix stock. While nearly double the stock's value prior to the 
offer, the suggested price nevertheless was far below the $19 at which Azurix 
made its debut in 1999.
An Azurix spokeswoman said the board, on which Enron has seats, had not yet 
decided how to treat the Enron offer. An Enron spokesman said that taking the 
company private would "give us more opportunity to directly affect our 
investment." In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, 
Azurix soared $3 to $6.56 in heavy trading. 
Azurix had hoped to create a splash by doing to the water business what Enron 
had done to the energy business -- increase competition and provide trading 
skills capable of creating new financial products out of old commodities. But 
Azurix stumbled, nearly from the outset. Deregulation of the water business 
and government privatizations of water systems, on which it was counting, 
were slow to come, crimping growth opportunities and profit. And Enron, 
accustomed to higher, faster returns, grew impatient with the 
capital-intensive water business. 
The company's first chief executive, Rebecca Mark, a onetime head of Enron's 
international division, resigned in the summer with the agreement of Enron 
executives, who said it was time for new leadership. The incoming chief 
executive, John Garrison, said he would look for buyers for some of the 
company's businesses; he was unavailable to comment Friday. Ms. Mark was 
believed to be considering making an offer for some of those businesses, 
herself. She declined a request for an interview. 
In its letter to Azurix officers, Enron said the water company received four 
offers from prospective suitors after Ms. Mark's departure, the best of which 
came from an unidentified bidder who offered $7 a share and went through a 
lengthy due-diligence process before backing down, apparently spooked by 
Azurix's cash flow, capital structure, tax considerations and some securities 
litigation. 
In its proposal letter, made public Friday, Enron said it concluded "that 
there is no other buyer willing to pay the $7" and so proceeded with its own 
offer. But Enron said it won't try to limit Azurix's ability to negotiate a 
better deal with others, should they come forward. Finally, Enron noted that 
Azurix had considered various partial or full-liquidation alternatives but 
said they didn't seem likely to produce more than $7 a share.

Wessex switch likely

Wessex Water's American parent company is likely to be taken private after a 
disastrous 14-month spell as a quoted company. 
Wessex, which provides water services to the South of England, was bought by 
Azurix in 1998 for Pounds 1.6 billion. Azurix wanted to use Wessex's 
expertise in privatised water supply to build a global business. However, 
since listing at $19 a share in June last year, Azurix stock has gone into 
freefall, closing at less than $4 earlier this week. Azurix slumped because 
it drastically misjudged the number of privatisation opportunities.
It emerged last night that Enron, the Texan energy and trading company that 
is Azurix's biggest shareholder, has taken the unusual step of offering to 
lend Azurix $275 million (Pounds 190 million) to buy its publicly held 
shares, thereby taking it private. 
The Enron proposal would value Azurix at about $800 million or $7 per share - 
63 per cent less than the IPO price. Enron would control Azurix and Wessex 
Water if it went private.

Enron water unit could go private under loan plan

Enron offered Friday to lend Azurix, its struggling water affiliate, about 
$275 million so Azurix can go private by purchasing 38.6 million shares that 
are publicly traded. 
The deal would have Azurix buying back its stock at $7 per share, about 
double what the shares were trading for Thursday. That's a big comedown for 
Azurix shares, which sold for $19 each when the Houston company went public 
in June 1999.
The maneuver technically can be called a "take-under," said analyst Carol 
Coale of Prudential Securities in Houston. She also described it as Enron's 
least painful solution for what to do with the venture that never lived up 
its ambitious plans. 
"Nothing about Azurix has been positive for Enron, in my view," said Coale. 
"This is a solution to a problem." 
Azurix spokeswoman Diane Bazelides said its board is studying Enron's 
proposal. She added that it was too early to comment on the offer because the 
proposal's structure had not been outlined. 
Enron imposed no deadline for a decision by Azurix, but reserved the right to 
withdraw the offer if Azurix's position with prospective customers and 
employees deteriorated. 
One of Enron's conditions is that Azurix not sell any major assets before the 
buyout. 
The deal would not change Enron's large stake in Azurix, said Palmer. It owns 
a third, while the other third is owned by the Atlantic Water Trust, in which 
Enron owns a 50 percent voting interest. 
The proposal's advantages include giving public shareholders a premium to the 
market price, said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer. 
The common stock of Azurix zoomed Friday on the news, gaining $3 to close at 
$6.56 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Becoming a private company would give Azurix management greater flexibility 
in restructuring. Coale said it would reduce Azurix's general and 
administrative costs, helping it to bid against lower- cost foreign 
competition, particularly two big French companies. Azurix's high cost 
structure has been its primary problem, she said. 
Azurix has been looking at cost and strategies ever since it got a new 
president and chief executive on Aug. 25, said Bazelides. That was the date 
that Rebecca Mark resigned as Azurix's high-profile chairman and chief 
executive. 
Enron and Azurix have been looking at "strategic alternatives" for nine 
months, J. Mark Meets, Enron's executive vice president for corporate 
development, said in a letter filed with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. 
One alternative was selling the company, he said. 
That didn't work out because the offers from three companies didn't exceed $4 
per share. 
The fourth potential buyer said it would consider offering $7 per share, said 
Meets. But that suitor backed out, citing reasons like cash flow, complexity 
of the capital structure, tax considerations and pending securities 
litigation. 
"We are obviously quite disappointed by this most recent turn of events," 
Meets said in the letter. "However, we strongly believe that there is no 
other buyer willing to pay the $7 per share initially proposed (but later 
withdrawn) by the fourth bidder."

Quietly, Bush's team talks about transition; Plenty of folks in Austin would 
love to follow Bush to D.C.
Ken Herman American-Statesman Capitol Bureau Chief

10/28/2000
Austin American-Statesman
A1
(Copyright 2000)

Not long ago, at a glossy wooden table in a Texas Capitol office, two of Gov. 
George W. Bush's high-level appointees discussed one of the key issues in 
state government these days. It involved the relative merits of White House 
posts that could be available to the two appointees if Bush becomes 
president. 
Asked this week whether it's a common topic around the Capitol, one of the 
appointees gestured to the anteroom of his office and made a motion 
indicating that even the midlevel folks have Washington on their minds.
Near the banks of the Colorado, Potomac Fever is a near-epidemic. 
And though it is political faux pas to be too open about doing White House 
transition planning before Election Day, be assured it is going on at Bush 
headquarters, where top officials are cognizant of the fine line between 
looking too confident now and looking too unprepared later. 
The candidate himself -- as well as his top aides -- steers clear of 
transition talk. When asked who might wind up in his Cabinet, Bush looks 
backward instead of forward, saying that his selection of Dick Cheney as his 
running mate should offer a glimpse of the kind of people who would wind up 
in his administration. 
The transition work, such that it is, is under the aegis of longtime Bush 
friend and aide Clay Johnson, who began as head of the gubernatorial 
appointments office and now serves as chief of staff. Johnson said nobody has 
been interviewed for any Washington post, but he has compiled a file of folks 
who are interested in serving in a Bush administration. 
Johnson also has been reading up on previous transitions -- ones that went 
well and ones that didn't. His preliminary conclusion is that the outgoing 
administrations are generally helpful and supportive, even if they were 
ousted by the incoming administration. It's the incoming administrations that 
can make the mistakes, he said. 
There is no shortage of think tanks that have think-tanked the topic. Back in 
August, the Heritage Foundation, based in Washington, issued a transition 
handbook titled "The Keys to a Successful Presidency." 
"Though we really don't expect either campaign to talk about it (and would 
discourage them from doing so), the message here is it's time to start 
planning for a possible presidential transition, quietly, well behind the 
scenes, but with the understanding that the preparation done during the next 
70 or so days, and the work done in the 70 or so days that follow (between 
the election and the inauguration) will very well determine the initial 
success or failure of the next administration," Herbert Berkowitz, a 
foundation vice president, said in releasing the study. 
All indications are that the Bush team has been following the advice, with 
Johnson at the helm. 
Johnson cautions against expectations that a Bush administration would be 
overloaded with Texans. 
"It's the United States of America, not the United States of Texas," he said. 
Despite that caveat, there is no shortage of Texans who are considered 
shoo-ins to fill some of the thousands of slots Bush could offer if he wins. 
Johnson confirms that he is very interested in a Washington job. Early 
speculation among Bush aides makes Johnson a potential leading contender for 
head of personnel at the White House. 
Karen Hughes, Bush's communications director since his 1994 gubernatorial 
campaign, is expected to become Bush's press secretary if he wins the White 
House. Karl Rove, Bush's longtime political guru, also will be on board, 
though he could wind up with an out-of- the-White-House post, perhaps at the 
Republican National Committee. 
Not as certain is the potential future for Joe Allbaugh, who is part of the 
"iron triangle" of top advisers -- along with Rove and Hughes -- who have 
been on board with Bush since the 1994 campaign. Allbaugh serves as manager 
of the presidential campaign and previously served as chief of staff in the 
governor's office. 
Capitol speculation indicates Allbaugh could decide to skip a White House 
post, possibly in favor of a lobbying job, if he is not tapped as chief of 
staff. That post could go to Don Evans, a longtime Bush friend who headed the 
megasuccessful fund-raising effort for the presidential campaign. 
However, not everyone has Potomac Fever. For example, Terral Smith, Bush's 
legislative director, said he will stay in Austin to lobby. 
In addition to the speculation about appointees, the approaching election has 
sparked talk about when Bush might leave office if he wins. Under the U.S. 
Constitution, he could remain governor until he has to become president on 
Jan. 20. 
Much more likely, however, is that Bush would leave office sooner than that, 
perhaps as soon as two or three weeks after the Nov. 7 election, if he wins. 
That could cause a housing problem for Bush, whose main residence is the 
Governor's Mansion, which comes as a free perk of the job. The Bushes have a 
home under construction at their ranch in Crawford, near Waco. The ranch also 
has a smaller house in which the Bushes now spend weekends. 
Not out of the question is that Bush could work out an arrangement with Lt. 
Gov. Rick Perry, who would become governor if Bush resigns, to remain in the 
Governor's Mansion for several weeks after he leaves office. 
If the race among Texas senators to replace Perry as lieutenant governor 
complicates the timing of the resignation, Bush could stay in the governor's 
office a little longer, but no later than the first week of January. After 
all, he will want to give Perry time to bask in his gubernatorial 
inauguration before the Legislature convenes Jan. 9. 
No matter when Bush resigns, confidantes believe he might use his Crawford 
ranch for interviews with potential top-level appointees, including Cabinet 
members.

Dynegy: Calif Price Caps Will Compromise Elec Reliability

10/27/2000
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- A Dynegy executive said Friday that the California 
Independent System Operator's plan to impose hourly price caps on the 
wholesale power market will compromise reliability by forcing generators to 
sell electricity out of state.
"If the ISO says it will not buy above a certain price and generators cannot 
operate below that price, then we have no choice but to find other markets to 
participate in," said Dynegy senior vice president of marketing and trading 
asset management Lynn Lednicky. "That may lead to the ISO not finding the 
power it needs at a price it wants to pay." 
The ISO plans to construct hourly price caps each month based on forecast 
load, natural gas prices and generation unit efficiency. The caps will take 
effect Nov. 3 or soon therafter. 
Dynegy Inc. (DYN) sent a letter to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
asking it to address reliability consequences of the price caps before Nov. 
3. Dynegy specifically requested that FERC discuss the issue at its Nov. 1 
meeting, when it will release a report on California's electricity problems. 
Enron Corp. (ENE) and Southern Company (SO) share Dynegy's concerns about 
reliability and plan to petition FERC about the issue, said a trader 
listening in to a conference call between the three companies.

SEC Filing Shows 3rd Parties Contacted Enron About Azurix
By Christopher C. Williams

10/27/2000
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

New York -(Dow Jones)- Shares of Azurix Corp. (AZX) jumped 84% in heavy 
trading Friday after parent Enron Corp. (ENE) proposed to take the company 
private in a $7-a-share buyout.
Filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission showed that Enron made 
the proposal after not being satisfied with offers it had received from four 
third parties for its stake in Azurix. 
In a letter to two members of Azurix's board, Enron said three potential 
buyers "were unlikely to be willing to pay more than the then-current market 
price of approximately $4 a share." 
Enron said a fourth potential buyer indicated it would consider a $7-a-share 
offer, but it said that proposal was recently withdrawn. "The reasons given 
by the bidder included pro forma cash flows, the complexity of the capital 
structure, tax considerations and the currently pending securities 
litigation," the letter said. 
Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Houston-based Enron, declined to say whether 
Enron was entertaining current third-party interests or was in any talks with 
other parties regarding its Azurix stake. 
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Azurix ended Friday up $3 to 
$6.56 on 2.8 million shares, compared with average daily volume of 239,000 
shares. Enron was up $1.38, or 1.8%, to $78.88 on 1.6 million shares, 
compared with its daily average turnover of 2.4 million. 
In the SEC filing, Enron, saying it's familiar with Azurix's various partial 
and full liquidation alternatives, said its buyout proposal is conditioned 
upon Azurix not selling any significant assets prior to the buyout. 
"Although we agree that such plans may result in greater value to Azurix's 
shareholders than the maintenance of the status quo, we believe that these 
options almost certainly will not result on a present value in a greater 
return to Azurix's shareholders than $7 a share," the letter said. 
Enron also said its buyout proposal doesn't include any breakup fees or other 
"deal protection devices." This frees Azurix's board to pursue an acquisition 
that "might provide greater value" to shareholders. 
Daine Bazelides, a spokeswoman for Azurix, declined to say whether Azurix is 
now entertaining offers for the company. She did, however, confirm the 
information contained in Enron's filing. "The historical information in the 
filing is factually correct," she told Dow Jones Newswires. 
She said she doesn't know when Azurix board will respond to Enron's proposal. 
In the filing, Enron didn't set a deadline, but warned that Azurix's position 
with customers and employees may deteriorate further. "We must therefore 
reserve the right to withdraw our proposal at any time," Enron's letter said. 
In the letter, Enron pointed out that Azurix had retained two 
"internationally recognized investment bankers" early this year to evaluate 
strategic alternatives, which included the potential sale of the company to 
unrelated third parties. 
Enron said it strongly believes there isn't another buyer willing to pay $7 a 
share for Enron's indirect interest in Azurix. "We believe it is in Azurix's 
best interest, as well as the best interest of its shareholders and 
employees, if Azurix were no longer a publicly traded company," Enron said.

Enron offers to buy out Azurix
Financial Times
By Hillary Durgin in Houston
Published: October 27 2000 23:31GMT | Last Updated: October 27 2000 23:36GMT


Enron, the Houston-based energy and trading group, said on Friday it had 
offered up to $275m in funding to take Azurix private at a buy-out price of 
$7 per share. 
The specific structure of Enron's proposal has yet to be determined, Enron 
said. Azurix said its board would now consider the proposal. The timing of 
any decision was unclear. 
Enron owns directly and indirectly about 66 per cent of Azurix, the troubled 
Houston water company, whose main asset is UK-based Wessex Water. 
The buyout offer is the latest development in a history of problems at 
Azurix, which was spun off from Enron and taken public at an offering price 
of $19 per share. 
But a combination of poor market timing, competitive industry conditions and 
empty promises by the company on Wall Street took their toll on the company, 
whose shares have since plummeted and have been trading most recently around 
the $3-per-share range. In August, Rebecca Mark, Azurix chief executive 
officer, resigned both from Azurix and from the board at Enron. 
Enron's offer came after four unnamed parties approached Enron about buying 
its stake in Azurix. 
While three of the four were unwilling to pay more than the then market price 
of about $4 per share, a fourth party who was considering offering $7 per 
share (before accounting for any dilution for stock options) later declined 
to pursue the transaction, Enron said in Friday's letter to Azurix, outlining 
the buyout proposal. 
"We strongly believe that our proposal is fair to Azurix's public 
stockholders," the letter stated. "Our proposed transaction would permit 
Azurix's stockholders to receive, on a timely basis, a cash payment for their 
shares that is significantly above the price at which those shares have 
traded in several months." 
Analysts that follow Azurix and had valued the shares at between $6 and $8 
per shares said the offer was fair. Analysts that follow Enron said that 
Azurix's business strategy had proved to be a failure and was characteristic 
of the hard asset approach that Enron has gradually distanced itself from. 
Enron's shares closed at $78.88 up $1.38 on Friday. Azurix's shares rose $3 
to close at $6.56.

California is electric industry test case 




By Deborah Adamson, CBS.MarketWatch.com
Last Update: 3:03 PM ET Aug 23, 2000 
NewsWatch
Latest headlines

SAN DIEGO (CBS.MW) -- The federal government will provide grants and loans to 
help local residents and businesses pay for soaring electricity bills, 
President Clinton said Wednesday.
Clinton said $2.6 million will be earmarked to help low-income families and 
seniors pay for electricity bills that have more than doubled. He urged the 
Small Business Administration to provide loans to companies that are 
struggling to pay power bills.
He also called for expediting the investigation of wholesale power markets by 
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
"We'll do what we can to help you," the president said during a televised 
news conference at the White House in Washington.
Test case yields public outcry
The San Diego area is a test case for the rest of the country over the 
feasibility of electric industry deregulation. The region -- which also 
encompasses South Orange County, north of San Diego -- is the first in the 
nation to have its power market completely deregulated. 
New York, New England and mid-Atlantic states are following suit, and they're 
watching California carefully.
Thus far, the San Diego test has turned out to be a shambles.
Electricity supply that hasn't increased in 10 years failed this summer to 
meet strong demand resulting from a growing state. With market forces in play 
for the first time, strong demand led to much higher wholesale rates that was 
passed along to residents.
After a public outcry, the California Public Utilities Commission on Monday 
approved a plan that would cap customers' electric bills for normal use, but 
they'll pay market rates for anything extra. Utility companies also can 
collect on any shortfalls later.

In other words, if the electric company can't pass along the entire cost of 
buying the energy for now, they'll be able to pass it along months later. 
Therefore, people who are used to seeing lower electricity bills for the 
cooler months in fall and winter won't see much of a drop-off.
"It's a shameful pay-now-or-pay-later plan," said Bob Finkelstein, staff 
attorney for the Utility Reform Network, a consumer advocacy group. 
"California jumped off the deregulation cliff."
State legislators, which have the power to expand on the commission's ruling, 
shelved a plan to roll back rates to mid-1999 levels and cap them for 
customers of San Diego Gas & Electric, a Sempra Energy (SRE: news, msgs) 
subsidiary. They faced opposition from Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, and from 
Republican lawmakers.
Davis prefers a plan that would cut rates by 60 percent immediately but that 
would stipulate customers pay the full amount of what they owe later. 
Republican lawmakers want the state to use taxpayers' money to help pay 
electric bills for consumers while businesses get tax credits.
San Diego fiasco
The Southern California fiasco came about as a result of a deregulated 
electricity market that began two years ago. The effects of deregulation are 
being felt first in the San Diego area because it was the first to end its 
rate freeze -- last summer. The rest of California should follow, region 
after region, by 2002. 
The idea sounded good: Deregulate the electric industry and let the market 
set the prices. With competition, rates should come down and service should 
improve. When the long-distance phone market was deregulated, it did bring 
about low prices and greater competition.
But things got messed up along the way.
For one, the hope that consumers and businesses could one day shop for 
electricity as they shop for better deals among long-distance carriers was 
dashed, at least for now. Initially, hundreds of companies had signed up to 
offer power but most have gone out of business or left the market. Of the 
remaining companies, most serve the more lucrative corporate market, said 
Linda Sherry, a spokeswoman at Consumer Action.
Also, the strategy of letting housing developments form power cooperatives 
and negotiate better rates "didn't pan out," Sherry said.
Demand far outstrips supply
Demand for power in California surged as businesses and the population grew. 
But supply didn't grow with it because no new electric generation plants have 
been built in the state for 10 years. Last year, the state approved five 
applications to build new plants, but they're years away from becoming 
operational.






Under the deregulated market, electric utility companies were mandated to 
sell their power generation plants. By separating the provider of electricity 
and the generator of electricity, the idea is to usher in a more competitive 
market.
Today, San Diego Gas & Electric buys from electric generators through an 
auction market.
But the auction market rules as set up actually make the situation in San 
Diego worse. According to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, when 
electric utilities accept bids from generators at various prices, they are 
required to pay to everyone the rate of the highest bid. But in a situation 
where the electric company needs all the power available, it has to accept 
all the bids and apply the highest price to every deal -- inflating the cost.
Electric generators were taking advantage of the situation by charging more, 
Sherry said. FERC is investigating and plans to issue a report later this 
year. But for now, price caps have been set.
Utility company buffeted
Ed Van Herik, a Sempra spokesman, said the auction rules are putting the 
squeeze on utility companies, already buffeted from all sides by public 
outcry and political pressure.
But Utility Reform Network's Finkelstein said San Diego Gas & Electric isn't 
totally blameless because it could have done a better job of hedging high 
costs.
"They could have entered into (futures) contracts to hedge these risks," 
which would have allowed the utility to buy electricity at prices under 
normal conditions, the attorney said.?

I'd say, "What next?", but I'm afraid to ask....
Regarding our California strategy, preventing the merger would seem to be 
right up there with "end the price caps" in our list of priorities.  At 
today's FERC hearing, a hair-brained consumer advocate called for merging the 
PX and the ISO.  During the panel I was on, I made the point that a merger 
would make California's problems worse than they are today.  The FERC 
Commissioners seemed somewhat responsive to my concerns.
P.S. After the panel, Heber lobbied me hard to support transcos.

By Jason Leopold 
     Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
     SAN DIEGO (Dow Jones) -- David Freeman, seen a likely replacement for 
Marcie Edwards on the board of governors of the California Independent System 
Operator, said his first order of business would be to try and merge the ISO 
and the California Power Exchange. 
     Edwards resigned her post on the ISO Thursday. 
     An informal consensus among the board has already approved his 
membership. 
     Freeman told Dow Jones Newswires that the $250 per megawatthour 
wholesale power price cap in California is too high, and that he would like 
to see it reduced below $100/MWh. 
     "I think my role (on the board) will help the state solve it's serious 
generation shortage problem," Freeman said. 
     Some market participants said Freeman is expected to run for chair of 
the ISO's board of governors, a seat currently held by Jan Smutny-Jones. 
     The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power has this summer been able 
to sell the ISO power in the real time market, and make a great profit for 
itself in return.

CONFIDENTIAL WORK PRODUCT


The key points for the next 2 weeks are as follows:

1. Sen. Alpert Legislation on Rate Caps
 - 2290 may be "dead"
 - Senator staff recognizes the legislation has "problems"
 - Senator is still looking to move something with another vehicle
 - Enron MESSAGE:  "CPUC is fixing the problem, legislature should do 
nothing; if you decide to do     something, then use Enron's fixes" (which 
simply codify the CPUC's decision)
 -  focus on customers' support for our legislative fix rather than IEP
 - Jeff D. to talk with customers, give them our fix, tell them to sit tight, 
and contact Sandi M. to discuss
 - Sandi M. to talk with Sen. Alpert about our fixes

2. Continue to support Williamson Act fix for Pastoria
 - Committee meeting on 8/18 fo Urgency bill
 - no opposition identified to date (some question about Farm Bureau though)
 - Sandi M. to attend meeting to support bill

Sandi M. will report back on events tomorrow afternoon.

It looks like we can secure both items in a reasonable fashion.  We need to 
stay focused and coordinated.  If anyone has any questions, please let me 
know.

Joe,

Below are articles that state that deregulation is better for everyone in the 
long run and though the California issue is bad, currently, it is not because 
of deregulation, but because of transmission and generation issues. 


''A deregulated world is the right market for electricity,'' said Ron Walter, 
senior vice president at Calpine, an independent power producer in San Jose 
that is building three plants. 

New York Times Article
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------
The root cause of California's electricity crisis is regulation, not 
deregulation. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------

Other States are learning from CA deregulation and believe that there 
deregulation will be more successful. Electric utility deregulation is 
sending up sparks in California, but that's not short-circuiting other 
states' plans.
At least for now, many are pledging to learn from California's mistakes and 
forge ahead by opening their own markets.
Texas, Ohio and Michigan are among 25 that have passed deregulation laws but 
not yet put them into effect. The three heavy industrial electricity users 
have big plans for competition.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------

Enron is mentioned in this article along with Boeing stating that..."We've 
certainly been exposed to the higher prices, and it's uncomfortable in the 
short term," said Keith Warner, the energy manager at Boeing, which spends 
about $200 million on power in the U.S. annually. "But in the long term, 
deregulation and open access (to transmission from other electric companies) 
is where we want to be. In every deregulation we've gone through in this 
country, competition has lowered prices."
 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------
This shows a more even view of deregulation stating its faults and its 
advantages. "The lack of supply has to do with deregulation and the 
uncertainty of a financial return on new investment of generation," 
Borenstein said. "But we still would have a supply problem under regulation 
and prices would still be high." 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----

Mercury News article states it is not time to re-regulate the markets and 
provides the following solutions to solve the crisis. Article Below.
Matters will improve when California has: 
-> More sources of power. 
-> A more sophisticated electricity market. 
-> Smarter consumers -- that is, consumers with the information they need to 
be thrifty. 
Also the article talks of the Power Exchange (PX) and the Independent System 
Operators (ISO) and how these two groups are making the prices higher; i.e 
market imperfections that result from the uniqueness of electricity as a 
commodity and the immaturity of the new exchanges are enabling producers to 
obtain higher prices than the underlying conditions dictate. 
Article concludes by saying the deregulated market is just beginning and with 
a few adjustments will work out fine

Steve:
I think I already forward these to you, but if not, they're the prices that 
Henderson came up with for fully shaped prices to the utilities.  May be 
useful re: conversations with the Street about getting the utilities out of 
procurement.  Note that the date on the prices is 10.02.00 so they're 
somewhat stale, but arguably still indicative.  I'm also going to give you 
the prices Belden just gave us (prior to the run up yesterday, though) for 
prices at SP15.

Best,
Jeff

Palmer said Enron could protect consumers from electricity price spikes by
entering into "hedging" agreements with local utilities, which are
contracts that provide guaranteed pricing for certain periods. He said the
company had reached such an agreement with the utility servicing Hartford,
Conn.

Looks good.  I think you implicitly say this, but I think you should make it 
more explicit:

The continued growth of the new economy is threatened by our electricity 
infrastructure more than anything else.
The high tech industry requires market driven solutions to reliability and 
pricing not the old style command and control regulated monopoly approach.
Let's start getting the word out!

Attached is an article about deregulation, price volatility, California power 
issues and how EES and other energy management type of companies are helping 
with solve these problems. 



Attached is an article about how PG&E is offering incentives to its larger 
customers in California that which asks them to use less energy, in turn the 
customers are guaranteed to be blackout free. There is a little controversy 
over this issue because the incentive is not offered to small business or 
residents.

The recent problems in San Diego and the media attention surrounding the 
power shortages and retail price spikes leads one to believe the problems are 
solely the result of restructuring efforts. However, some areas that have 
"deregulated" don't regret the decision.
Last week, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge said that electric competition will 
save consumers in his state $3 billion by 2001 and increase productivity, 
employment and personal income by 2004. His comments came as a response to a 
report recently issued by the state government. 
The report, prepared by the state Department of Revenue to measure the impact 
of restructuring on state finances, said that forecast reductions in retail 
electricity prices will improve the state's economy in several ways.
By 2004, as a direct result of electric competition, the report says:
** The real gross state product will be $1.9 billion, or 0.5%, higher than 
the baseline;
** Overall employment will increase by 0.5%, amounting to 36,400 full-time 
and part-time jobs, including more than 3,000 manufacturing jobs, nearly 
7,000 retail-sector jobs, more than 5,000 construction jobs, nearly 2,700 
transportation and public utility jobs, and more than 12,000 service-sector 
jobs;
** Nominal personal income will increase by $1.4 billion, or 0.3%;
** The price index will decrease by 0.47%; and,
** The population will increase by 51,400 persons, or 0.4%, as workers move 
to the state.
"Pennsylvania's national leadership in electric competition continues to 
bring dramatic savings and economic benefits to Pennsylvanians," Ridge said. 
"And, according to this new report, those savings and benefits will continue 
for some time to come. We expect electric competition will help create more 
than 36,000 jobs between 1998 and 2004, and have a major positive impact on 
our state's economy. And millions of Pennsylvania families and employers 
continue to save money on their electric bills - without even lifting a 
finger."
Savings from electric restructuring allow consumers more money to spend and 
invest, creating positive multiplier effects on the state economy, Secretary 
of Revenue Robert Judge said.
"Our research confirms that while consumers of electricity will realize rate 
reductions, there are many other benefits to Pennsylvania through electric 
competition," Judge said.
The Public Utility Commission estimates that consumers will save nearly $3 
billion by January 2001 due to electric competition.
The report includes an analysis of the effects of restructuring on sales tax 
and personal income tax revenue. The 1996 restructuring law required that 
deregulation bring no net effect on "immediate" state tax collections, the 
report says. Under the law, the Revenue Department must report to governor 
and the General Assembly providing information on tax revenues to enable 
lawmakers to judge the law's impact on the economy and to decide whether new 
laws are necessary to "maintain tax revenue neutrality during the transition 
period."
The revenue neutral reconciliation, the adjustment mechanism used to compare 
tax revenues collected before restructuring and after restructuring, is 
working as intended, the report says.
As required by the law, the Revenue Department will produce two more reports 
for the General Assembly and the Governor, one in August 2001 and one in 
August 2002.
Like Pennsylvania, some in Ontario say the movement toward a competitive 
market for electricity has saved customers upwards of $500 million through 
rate reductions.
Even though the Ontario Energy Board (OEB) is currently considering scaling 
back or stopping the move to competitive markets, one of the province's 
largest utilities, Toronto Hydro-Electric, says local regulators should 
recognize the savings from restructuring.
Toronto Hydro says the restructured market is successful because of the 
"utility's commitment to fair prices and safe reliable service in the new 
competitive electricity market." Since 1993, rates have fallen for all 
customer classes, the utility claims.
"We agree whole-heartedly with the need to protect consumers in the new 
electricity market," Toronto Hydro Vice President Blair Peberdy said. "As a 
municipal electric utility, we've protected consumers to the tune of more 
than $500 million through rate reduction strategies for the past seven years. 
Our rates are 12.5% below the consumer price index and we have reduced rates 
since 1993. That's why we're keen for the province to stay focused on 
introducing commercial reforms in the electricity distribution sector. We've 
invested millions in preparing for the opening of the new energy marketplace 
already and we're ready to go."
The utility warned against further forced rate reductions in light of the 
savings they have produced. Toronto Hydro also called for regulators not to 
lower prices at the expense of more reliable service.
"Considering the rate freezes and reductions that Toronto Hydro has 
implemented since 1993, price minimization should not outweigh other 
objectives in the OEB act," the testimony says. "Protect consumers not just 
in terms of rates, but also in terms of the quality of electric distribution 
services."
The company is also pushing for regulatory action to move along with 
competitive reform, not to delay the developing market already in a 
transition phase, because it might scare away new participants.
"The government has put a solid foundation in place for the new electricity 
market," Peberdy said. "Now is the time to look forward, not back. We're 
excited about the potential for new investment, new energy technologies and 
new business opportunities for Toronto Hydro, and we are prepared to work 
with the OEB to develop options that will help sustain the government's 
vision."

Byers fines will boost renewable energy 
TERRY MACALISTER AND PAUL BROWN

Electricity companies will face hefty fines for failing to meet environmental 
targets under proposals to be outlined today by the industry secretary, 
Stephen Byers.

He will delight the green lobby by ruling out waste incineration from his 
definition of "renewables" and by putting the emphasis on new forms of energy 
such as wind power. 

An early consultation docu ment suggested a "buyout" fee of 2p per 
kilowatt-hour for those who failed to buy 5% of their supplies from renewable 
sources by 2003 and 10% by 2010. Well-placed sources say Mr Byers has 
privately accepted the need to charge a "buyout" fee of 3p per kilowatt hour, 
which will anger the electricity companies but please the renewable industry.

"We anticipate this will kickstart our sector, lead to over pounds 5bn worth 
of capital investment and create thousands of jobs," said one executive from 
a renewable energy company.

Big companies such as National Wind Power, a division of Innogy (formerly 
National Power) and PowerGen Renewables will be among the beneficiaries.

Stephen Tindale, chief policy adviser to Greenpeace UK, said dropping 
incineration would put the government "back on the right trajectory after a 
series of disappointments". But the green lobby admits that further financial 
help might be needed and say electricity companies will pass on some of their 
extra costs to consumers.

The Department of Environment has had a target of 10% of electricity from 
renewables by 2010 for more than two years as part of the government's 
manifesto pledge to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20% by the same date. 
But deregulation has forced the price of electricity down, helping gas-fired 
power stations but penalising the less competitive renewable sector.

Partial Electric Rate Freeze OKd for Hard-Hit San Diego/Critics say more 
relief needed for deregulation
David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer


   Responding to calls for action from Gov. Gray Davis, the California Public
Utilities Commission approved a limited rate freeze yesterday for
electricity users in San Diego, where power bills have skyrocketed in
recent months.
   However, the measure was harshly criticized by San Diego officials and
consumer activists as being an insufficient remedy for surging rates
resulting from deregulation of the state's electricity market.
   They are now looking for relief from legislators in Sacramento, who are
expected to vote today on a bill that would allow them to sidestep state
energy regulators and impose more extensive restrictions on how much San
Diegans can be charged for power.
   "I'm extremely, extremely disappointed," said San Diego County Supervisor
Dianne Jacob, who flew up for yesterday's PUC meeting in San Francisco
with other local officials.
   Former San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor urged California legislators to
scrap the state's electricity deregulation altogether. "To continue the
farce so that the whole state is under this terrorist economic endeavor is
just ridiculous," she said.
   O'Connor added that Bay Area ratepayers should be concerned about what
will happen when Pacific Gas and Electric Co. lifts a freeze on its own
electricity rates, perhaps as soon as next summer.
   "We already have the train wreck in San Diego," she said. "It's coming
your way next."
   The PUC voted 3 to 2 to approve an immediate "bill stabilization plan"
ensuring that most residential customers using 500 kilowatt hours or less
in electricity would pay no more than $68 per month through Jan. 31, 2001.
Their bills would be capped at $75 a month for the remainder of next year.
   Business customers using no more than 1,500 kilowatt hours would have
their monthly bills capped at $220 until the end of January, subsequently
rising to $240 a month.
   Michael Shames, executive director of San Diego's Utility Consumers'
Action Network, acknowledged that the average residence uses 500 kilowatt
hours a month in juice, but said this figure is skewed by inclusion of
vacation homes, apartments, condominiums and other relatively low power
users.
   Many San Diego Gas & Electric customers use double the amount of power
stipulated in the PUC's rate cap, he said.
   The PUC's measure, Shames said, "does precious little for government,
schools, hospitals and businesses who are currently being hit hard by the
energy debacle." RESTAURANT'S BILL SOARS
   One San Diego business owner, Susan Bauman, said her restaurant used
30,000 kilowatt hours last month and that her monthly power bill doubled
to more than $10,000. For the entire year, she said, her electricity bills
will total more than $100,000.
   "The commission just doesn't get it," said Mike Florio, an attorney for
The Utility Reform Network, a San Francisco consumer group.
   The commission's vote was along party lines, with the three Republican
appointees -- Henry Duque, Richard Bilas and Josiah Neeper -- voting in
favor and Democratic appointees Loretta Lynch and Carl Wood dissenting.
   Lynch and Wood had favored an alternative measure that would have applied
the rate freeze to a greater number of customers. In speeches prior to the
vote, San Diego officials were unanimous in also supporting the more
extensive proposal.
   "We did take some action today," Lynch, the PUC president, said in an
interview afterward. "But clearly, this commission is not used to acting
on an emergency basis."
   A special PUC meeting was scheduled after the governor, taking heat for
the state's surging power costs, called on the commission to provide
relief for ratepayers in San Diego, the first California city to feel the
full effects of deregulation.
   Davis said yesterday that he would have preferred passage of the more
sweeping PUC alternative but hailed the approved measure as "clearly a
step forward."
   He reiterated his belief that electricity generators are gouging
consumers.
   Average San Diego power bills have more than doubled over the past four
months as the local utility passes along rising wholesale costs to
customers.
   Electricity generators are now being investigated by the PUC, the attorney
general's office and other authorities to determine if they are
manipulating prices as demand for juice far outstrips available supply.
LOBBYING BEGINS
   After yesterday's PUC vote, the San Diego officials who attended the
meeting, including four of five county supervisors and Mayor Susan
Golding, piled into cars and headed for Sacramento. They said they will
lobby legislators for passage of more far-reaching rate relief.
   "This is affecting the health, safety and welfare of everyone in our
service area," Golding said. "We need relief and we need it now."
   Earlier this month, the state Senate voted 28 to 0 to approve a plan to
roll back San Diego power rates to prederegulation levels. Passage of the
bill in the Assembly is now seen as more likely following the outcome of
the PUC meeting.
   Sen. Dede Alpert, D-San Diego, said yesterday that without additional
measures, local schools will be forced to pay about $45 million in
additional electricity costs using funds otherwise earmarked for
structural and academic improvements.

Sorry it took a while.  My "new" computer really hasn't worked since I got 
converted a few weeks ago, and there's no telling when it might work.  Here's 
the latest market power report---I faxed you the Exec Sum earlier.

Judge Wetzel was present and a transcript was taken.  The quasi-legislative 
hearing was the beginning of a record developed for the investigation into 
the workings of wholesale/retail markets.  This session focused on Wholesale 
markets.  There will be subsequent sessions on retail issues, market 
structure and other related issues in the future.  My conclusion from this 
session is that Wood is looking for support for increasing regulatory 
intervention in the market.

Dan Larcamp, Director of the Office of markets, Tariffs and Rates, FERC, was 
present.  He relayed FERC's concern of this matter and a desire to hold 
hearings in San Diego.  He also relayed that Hoecker held a press conference 
announcing the opening of a 206 investigative proceeding into the operation 
of the wholesale markets in California, which carried with it refund 
authority.

The format of the hearing was to respond to pre-filed questions developed by 
Wood/Lynch.  Each member of the panel would respond to the questions and any 
questions posed by the Commissioners, the Judge or the CPUC Attorney.  No 
questions were posed by members of the audience.  Yesterday's panel of 
academics were comprised of:

1.  Dr. Timothy Duane-UC Berkley
2.  Dr. William Hogan-Harvard
3.  Dr. Frank Wolak-Stanford (ISO Market Surveillance Committee)
4.  David Marcus-Energy Consultant for the Coaltion of Utility Employees
5.  Dr. Gene Coyle
6.  Dr. Jean-Michel Glachant, Universite Paris I Pantheon Sorbonne

The panel was asked to speak as individuals and not on behalf of any 
institutions they may represent.  While the purpose of the panel seemed to be 
to determine that market power was being exercised and that prices were too 
high and therefore not just and reasonable, the panelist stopped short of 
blaming generators and market participants in behaving illegally.  The 
concensus generally was that market power did exist at various times, but the 
mere existence did not constitute bad behavior.  None, with the exception of 
Dr. Wolak who is in the process of doing a study using recent data as part of 
his role for the Market Surveillance Committee, had done a study.  There was 
some discussion, though not much, of the monopsony power of the utilities.  I 
think ultimately the group conceded that scarcity of supply amplified 
concerns about the exercise of market power, as even the increase in gas 
costs did not fully explain the recent spikes.  Wolak believes that encourage 
utilities to enter into forward purchases will reduce the exercise of 
real-time market power. 

Hogan seemed to be there with Sempra's interests in mind.  He continued to 
promote expansion of the ISO's abilities to dispatch load as well as maintain 
system reliability.  There was alot of discussion about forward purchase 
ability for utilities so as to be less subject to volatile market prices.  
The concerns were also discussed about the appropriateness of a distribution 
utility making purchasing decisions on behalf of its customers.  This 
included discussion of separation of these functions and the default provider 
role.  

Most everyone agreed that rolling back to a regulated market was not feasible 
without raising other major and serious concerns, however there seemed to be 
support for some interim measures where cost-of-service regulation may be a 
good idea and that was during peak periods.  All agreed that a demand 
response, and price signals, are important in the long-run, although not to 
the extent currently experienced in San Diego.

Today's panel included representatives from SDG&E, SCE and PG&E, TURN, UCAN 
and ORA.  

While yesterday's panel maintained objectivity as to whether or not 
generators were exercising market power to the detriment of the system, 
today's panel made no bones about the generators being to blame.

SCE/PG&E indicated their need for relief for recovery of market costs in 
excess of the rate freeze.  SDG&E was still on the hot seat for their 
inaction in hedging any of their supply.  SDG&E brought up their failed PBR 
proposal and ORA and UCAN thought that that may be one way to incent the 
utility to be more responsible with their purchases.

UCAN discussed the Governor's direction and the potential for putting rate 
caps into affect for residential and small commercial.  He mentioned that C&I 
customers are experience difficulties as well.  

TURN raised the need for cost-based bid caps and cost-based peaking 
contracts.  Mike Florio, TURN, urged against any further divestitute of 
assets and alleged market concentration on those assets that had been 
divested.  In fact, TURN urged the Commission to seek legislation to clarify 
the Commission's authority to order retention of assets.

Neeper urged that part of the solution should be changing the current 
requirement to use the PX as the only authorized exchange, although TURN 
disagreed.

Subject: Daily Update/ Legislative activity - 08/24/00

Siting related bills

1. Good new - The Williamson Act passed the Senate 34-1, It should be heard 
at the assembly Saturday or Monday if it is not redirected to a Committee 
hearing.

2. There was a long meeting with Ducheny with regards to AB 970. The enviro's 
boycotted, they want to draft a bill with Keeley. Labor was obstructionist - 
they wanted to gut all the expediting siting  language with regards to all 
facilities except for the peaking plants.  

Rate Cap related bills
1. The Edison Language on Rate Stabilization may not go anywhere. Edison has 
not found an author because of the efforts of Enron and others lobbying 
against it. Furthermore there are signs that Gov. Davis opposes it.

2. The Governor's office has issued a proposed language for a rate cap bill. 
The language however is not available as of yet. It may be released today or 
tomorrow. SDG&E has shown concerns over the content of the bill. They seem to 
think that it is worse than initially proposed by the Governor in his press 
release. 
The bill includes retroactive rate caps through 6/1/00. 
The rate cap could reflect Wood's rate cap proposal (6.5 cts cap on the 
energy component
The bill does not specify who or how the costs associated with the cap will 
be recovered. (The reasoning is that UDCs will be more cautious in their 
procurement if there is uncertainty on who is responsible for the costs.)
All of this is speculative. We hope to see the actual language soon.

3. Enron has been working with the Republican leadership to promote a rate 
cap proposal similar to the amended language we have proposed for AB2290.
The bill focuses only on SDG&E customers and our major principals are the 
following. 
The Interim Rate Cap should be limited to residential and small commercial 
customers, plus specific institutions that have a significant public role, 
such as schools and hospitals.  
The Interim Rate Cap should be limited to the period ending December 31, 2001.
The Interim Rate Cap must be structured so that any undercollection is 
eventually recovered from the same customers who benefit from the lower rates 
provided by the rate cap.

Flaws Cited in California Electricity Market
? 
10/07/2000 
The New York Times 
Page 4, Column 1 
c. 2000 New York Times Company 
PASADENA, Calif., Oct. 6 -- California's electricity market is not ''workably 
competitive'' and needs to be fixed, the California Power Exchange said in a 
draft report. 
Wholesale power prices from May to July more than quadrupled from a year 
earlier as demand strained supplies during weather that was hotter than 
normal. Some generators appeared to hold back power at times of peak 
consumption, waiting until prices surged. 
This happened because of ''structural flaws in the design of the California 
electricity markets,'' the report said. ''These design flaws need to be 
addressed,'' it said. A final report is expected next week. 
The exchange recommended easing restrictions on building power plants and 
penalizing companies for waiting until the last minute to deliver power. It 
did not cite a specific power-plant owner, marketer or utility as responsible 
for the problem. 
The nonprofit power exchange was created by the state legislature in 1996 to 
operate a marketplace where utilities and other big buyers and sellers could 
get electricity. 
The PG&E Corporation's Pacific Gas and Electric, Edison International's 
Southern California Edison and Sempra Energy's San Diego Gas and Electric buy 
all their power through the exchange. 
Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison have said they face 
billions of dollars of losses because rates they can charge customers are 
frozen far below the rates they had to pay for power on the exchange this 
summer.

Steve, I understand that you are developing a campaign for California, 
considering all of media attention that has been placed on this state.  I 
publish a weekly deregulation report and it contains some information that 
may prove useful.  The report is attached.

Subject: FERC Presentation on California/West Wholesale Market

Last Thursday, I made the first attached presentation to the FERC Staff at 
the power marketer's meeting on the FERC's investigation of the wholesale 
market in the West (and in particular California).  Ellen Wolf (of Tabors 
Caramanis) and I created this presentation building on previous presentations 
by Tim Belden and Dave Parquet.  In the presentation and the meeting we made 
the following points:
There isn't much FERC can do because the cause of the price spikes is not in 
the wholesale market.  We discouraged FERC from taking any action that would 
hurt the vibrant wholesale market in the California and the rest of the West 
as well.
High prices logically resulted from scarcity and if the Commission does 
anything it should (1) investigate whether market power was being exercised 
by any party and, (2) if necessary to protect the market (while still 
incenting needed generation) establish a price cap at a scarcity rent level 
equal to the price at which loads were willing to interrupt.  
The IOUs have not properly prepared for the risk of high prices caused by 
scarcity.  They have failed to hedge and have underscheduled their load, 
therefore having to fill a large percentage of their load at ISO real time 
prices.  My analogy was that this was like day trading your retirement fund 
as an asset allocation scheme.
The market would function better if more information was provided to the 
market.
The Commission should do whatever it can to incent participation by load.
To see the presentation, detach, save, and view in Powerpoint.  When you do, 
you will find there are many "hidden" slides that were not part of the oral 
presentation but were provided to Staff in hard copy for additional 
information.

According to the head of the investigation (Scott Miller), the staff got alot 
more out of this meeting than Staff's previous meetings with the IOUs and the 
generators.  Based on the numerous phone calls I've been getting, the Staff 
is looking into the data we provided.  

I have also attached a revised version of the presentation that Tim sent to 
Scott Miller on Friday.  Tim's version conveys the same message but takes a 
different approach to conveying the message.  On Friday, Tim talked to Scott 
and answered some additional questions.  Tim said that Enron is in favor of 
eliminating the mandatory PX buying requirement and would like the IOUs to be 
able to buy from Enron Online.  He also explained more fully the existence of 
scarcity .

Mary,

Can we tone down the demand-side management language.  Our short-term retail 
position in California is that the rate freeze by law should be maintained 
until December 31, 2002.  Of course, in the long-run we believe demand-side 
management and demand elasticity is and important tool toward managing the 
prices in California.  Perhaps you can refer to demand elasticity as a 
long-run goal or focus your discussions on demand elasticity with respect to 
the utilities' current tools in their interruptible tariffs.  Also, you could 
focus more on the utilities' new ability to purchase outside the PX.  I am 
afraid that coming out too strong on demand-side management as a short-run 
solution plays into the utilities' hands to end the rate freeze early to the 
detriment of the retail market.

Roger

USA: Calif. utilities seek ISO power price cap cut to $100. 
? 
10/04/2000 
Reuters English News Service 
(C) Reuters Limited 2000. 

SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Pacific Gas and Electric Co (PG&E) said 
Wednesday it is joining with Southern California Edison and a California 
consumer group to seek a reduction of the Independent System Operator (ISO) 
price cap for electricity to $100.00 per megawatt hour (MWh) from the current 
$250.00 cap.

PG&E, the utility subsidiary of San Francisco-based PGOCorp. , proposed the 
lower price cap as part of a broader package of steps it is taking to "make 
sure the California power market can operate more efficiently," a company 
official told reporters at a briefing here. 

Southern California Edison is the utility subsidiary of Edison International 
, based in Rosemead, Calif.

PGOsaid the request was backed by The Utility Reform Network (TURN), a San 
Francisco-based consumer group that has protested against soaring electricity 
prices as a result of California's bid to deregulate its electricity industry.

The California ISO, established as part of the deregulation effort, oversees 
the operation of about 75 percent of the state's power grid, serving some 27 
million people.

The move by PGOand Edison follows a summer of chaos in the California power 
market, where a shortage of electricity generated within the state and open 
market power pricing sent the cost of wholesale power to nearly twice its 
historical average, frequently trading above the proposed $100.00 cap.

One other argument we could make:  according to the traders, the gas market 
is very liquid.  Because the gas market is very liquid, generators will sell 
their gas and turn off their units.  So the ISO will create a reliability 
problem.

To simplify, for the trading floor, the biggest California issues EPMI  is 
currently pursuing at FERC are:

Beneficial resolution to Price Caps
Access to all market information - "more, better, faster"
Path 15 - control by the ISO not PG&E

However, Tim has numerous other concerns and I'm sure Dennis, Chris and Dave 
do as well.  Accordingly, Tim would like to meet to discuss how we should 
address these concerns and to develop a better understanding of  some of the 
items listed below and the relative priority of these items.  I'd like to 
propose that this meeting happen in Portland.  Shall I set this up?  Please 
forward this to others you think should be involved.

Because so much is going on in California, I thought it would be important to 
draft up a list of current activities that Enron is active in or monitoring 
to make sure that everyone knows what is happening.  The following list of 
issues may not include everything.  If I've left something off that needs 
attention or someone is working on, please add it to the list.

  Business; Financial Desk 
  Sempra Still Feeling the Heat Energy: The parent firm of 2 Southern 
California
  utilities is weathering criticism from all sides, with more flare-ups on 
the horizon. 
  NANCY RIVERA BROOKS 
    
  09/17/2000 
  Los Angeles Times 
  Home Edition 
  Page C-1 
  Copyright 2000 / The Times Mirror Company 

  Sempra Energy just can't seem to get out of the hot seat.

  First there was the controversial 1998 merger between the parents of San 
Diego Gas &
  Electric and Southern California Gas, which created the Sempra Energy 
holding company
  and gave it more customers--21 million--than any other utility company in 
the nation.

  Now, although the calendar says autumn is less than a week away, warm 
weather still has
  Sempra sweating through a summer of electricity discontent. And winter 
doesn't look like
  much fun either for Sempra or its natural-gas customers, with residential 
gas bills projected
  to increase 30% to 35% without fueling anything above a strictly regulated 
rate of return for
  Sempra's gas utilities.

  Hanging over the San Diego-based energy company is a new uncertainty 
generated by the
  turmoil in California's restructuring electricity industry. Of particular 
concern to the
  investment community is a rapidly swelling debt caused by the difference 
between the high
  wholesale cost of electricity and the freshly capped retail power rates for 
the 1.2 million
  customers of San Diego Gas & Electric.

  Who will pay that debt--Sempra Energy's shareholders or SDG&E's electricity
  customers--and how big it will grow may not be known for years. The answer 
will hinge in
  part on an investigation of SDG&E's conduct by the California Public 
Utilities Commission.

  In the meantime, Sempra Energy, whose two utilities serve nearly 7 million 
gas and
  electricity meters representing about 21 million customers from Central 
California to the
  Mexican border, continues to post sparkling earnings largely because of its 
non-utility
  businesses. Sempra wants to be much more than its utilities, pushing into 
energy trading
  and electricity and natural-gas contracting outside of California.

  Indeed, Sempra has stressed that recent profit surges came not at the 
expense of its
  California utility customers. Consumer advocates are not persuaded, 
painting Sempra as a
  profit-hungry company that has not done enough to protect ratepayers.

  Despite all the tumult, Sempra's previously languid stock price has risen a 
bit this summer,
  a fact that appears to amaze even Stephen L. Baum, Sempra's new chairman 
and chief
  executive.

  "Maybe it's all the publicity we've been getting," he recently quipped, 
ruefully.

  It's a careful-what-you-wish-for proposition for Sempra Energy, which spent 
hundreds of
  thousands of dollars in the last two years to boost its corporate profile 
by, among other
  things, becoming a sponsor of Staples Center and rolling out a new logo 
that looks like a
  small flaming man. Now the corporation and its San Diego utility are 
puzzling over how to
  repair an image so scorched that angry residents in SDG&E's 
4,200-square-mile territory
  covering the San Diego area and southern Orange County have taken to 
verbally and
  physically abusing company employees.

  "This has been an agonizing time for all of us," Baum told the Federal 
Energy Regulatory
  Commission at a hearing Tuesday that is part of an investigation into this 
summer's
  gyrations in the California wholesale electricity market. "SDG&E takes 
enormous pride in
  serving this community with safe and reliable electric service at, what 
were until recently,
  just and reasonable prices."

  Although regulators themselves, not to mention consumer advocates, warned 
of looming
  shortages in power supplies, no one predicted this summer of sky-high 
prices during which
  wholesale electricity prices jumped fivefold and bills doubled for SDG&E 
customers, the
  first in the country to pay free-market power prices.

  That produced a "Ratepayer Rebillion"--so dubbed by Michael Shames, 
executive director
  of the San Diego-based Utility Consumers Action Network, a longtime SDG&E 
sparring
  partner. The shock waves quickly reached utility regulators and state 
lawmakers, the
  architects of electricity deregulation , who are still scrambling for 
solutions.

  "SDG&E has become the corporate equivalent of the gang that couldn't shoot 
straight,"
  Shames said. "They have the distinction of having the market blow up on 
them in a very
  visible way . . . and I'm quite convinced they didn't have a clue how 
customers were going
  to respond."

  This high-voltage atmosphere visited the San Diego area because SDG&E did 
such a good
  job selling its power plants, as required under deregulation . The 1996 law 
that launched
  the overhaul of California's electricity world broke the industry into 
three separate
  businesses: companies that make electricity, companies that distribute 
electricity and
  companies that sell electricity directly to consumers and businesses.

  SDG&E and the state's other big investor-owned utilities--Edison 
International unit Southern
  California Edison and PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric--lost their 
secure monopoly
  status. They were deemed to be electricity distribution companies 
only--though still
  monopolies in that segment of the business.

  The utilities handed over their long-distance transmission systems to a new 
nonprofit, the
  California Independent System Operator, and were required to buy their 
electricity from
  another new nonprofit, the California Power Exchange. The utilities 
remained the default
  provider for customers who didn't pick a new electricity retailer, but they 
were required to
  pass along the cost of electricity with no markup.

  Electricity rates for consumers and small businesses were frozen until the 
utilities paid off
  their "stranded assets"--investments in nuclear power and renewable energy 
contracts that
  became unprofitable under deregulation --or until March 2002. Rates are 
still frozen for
  SCE and PG&E customers, but SDG&E customers lost that protection in July 
1999, after
  the San Diego utility sold its power plants to eager buyers who were 
willing to pay much
  more than book value.

  The rapid payoff surprised even regulators, who had developed no 
post-freeze rules. The
  California Public Utilities Commission allowed SDG&E to maintain a 12% 
ceiling on prices
  for the summer of 1999 and recoup any excess electricity costs later. 
Thanks to a cool
  summer and a smoothly functioning wholesale market, the ceiling was little 
employed.

  This summer, however, no ceiling was allowed by the PUC as part of its 
original post-freeze
  order, SDG&E executives said. And prices on the California Power Exchange 
began
  behaving strangely, spiking higher and higher even in the middle of the 
night when demand
  was low.

  San Diego-area electricity users began seeing "true market prices from a 
market that's
  dysfunctional," Baum said. "Of course I wish we had foreseen this market 
spike. We
  didn't."

  Consumer fury has been calmed somewhat by a new law that caps electricity 
prices for
  SDG&E residential and small-business customers at 6.5 cents a 
kilowatt-hour, compared
  with the 21.5-cent peak this summer. Who will eventually pay the 
electricity costs above
  the cap, currently collecting in a balancing account, is left unclear by 
the legislation.

  It could mean a big balloon payment for customers, or some of the costs 
could be shared
  by SDG&E if a PUC investigation finds that the utility didn't act in the 
best interests of its
  customers in buying electricity. A companion bill that would use $150 
million in taxpayer
  funds to defray some of the costs passed the Legislature but has not been 
signed by Gov.
  Gray Davis.

  "I don't think that we did anything wrong," Baum said. "This is a bum rap 
that has been
  hung on us, on SDG&E, that we somehow mismanaged the power supply for our
  customers."

  PUC officials and consumer advocates have criticized SDG&E for not 
"hedging" more by
  buying ahead of time when prices are relatively low, for example. SDG&E 
said that it asked
  the commission for such authority but didn't get it. What's more, Baum 
said, SDG&E found
  better prices for its customers than did SCE or PG&E, even though they have 
broader
  hedging ability.

  SDG&E will have to borrow money to pay for the electricity, since 
ratepayers aren't paying
  the full cost. SDG&E says the under-collection of electricity costs could 
eventually top
  $800 million, whereas sponsors of the rate-cap bill put the total closer to 
$150 million.

  The future debt and the unsettled state of the deregulation process in 
California were the
  reasons given when Moody's Investors Service recently changed the credit 
outlook for
  Sempra and SDG&E to "negative."

  Shareholders can't be happy with Sempra's stock price, which fell from a 
high of about $28
  a share right after the 1998 merger between Enova and Pacific Enterprises, 
which was
  loudly opposed by consumer advocates because of the market clout a merged 
company
  would wield, to a low of $16.63 in April. Sempra bought back 36.1 million 
shares at $20
  each in February and lowered the stock dividend to $1 a share from $1.56 a 
share. The
  stock closed Friday up 14 cents at $20.14 on the New York Stock Exchange.

  Baum acknowledged that the company has lagged in return to shareholders, 
blaming that
  partly on a turning away by investors from utilities and other old-economy 
companies to
  Internet and other new-economy stocks.

  Sempra wants to be much more than its utilities and has made some promising 
inroads
  into unregulated areas, such as energy commodity trading, 
telecommunications,
  power-plant building and the sale of electricity and natural-gas to 
consumers and
  businesses in other states, Mexico, South America and Canada, analysts said.

  In fact, Sempra Energy Trading, which buys and sells electricity, natural 
gas, oil and coal,
  earned more money in the first quarter--$3 million--than in all of 1999. 
That subsidiary's $40
  million in second-quarter earnings was primarily responsible for Sempra's
  better-than-expected income for the period of $110 million, or 55 cents a 
diluted share, up
  34% from the second quarter of last year.

  Analyst Paul Fremont of Jefferies & Co., who has a "buy" rating on Sempra, 
notes that the
  trading company income will be volatile and that the other subsidiaries 
remain unknown
  quantities.

  "They've really got to have sustained growth in that [unregulated] part of 
the business
  because there's not a lot of growth in the utility part" in California, 
Fremont said.

  Sempra's earnings growth during this electricity furor has consumer 
advocates fuming even
  though company executives emphasized that electricity trading gains came 
from the East,
  not California.

  "Consumers don't need to feel sorry for this company," said Mindy Spatt, 
spokeswoman for
  the Utility Reform Network, also known as TURN, a San Francisco-based 
consumer group.
  Spatt noted that Sempra's new El Dorado power plant near Las Vegas "did 
very well"
  selling electricity in Nevada and California during most of the second 
quarter.

  "We don't think consumers should be responsible for the failures of 
deregulation , and we
  think that Sempra is in a much better position to pay for some of these 
costs than the
  average San Diegan," Spatt said.

  Sempra has had some problems in reaching beyond its California utility 
origins. One
  subsidiary, Energy America, which sells electricity and natural gas door to 
door in six
  Eastern states, has run afoul of regulators in two states because of 
aggressive sales
  tactics that prompted complaints from consumers. The company has been 
variously fined
  and ordered to retrain salespeople.

  Sempra is on track to reach its goal of reaping one-third of its earnings 
from its
  non-California businesses by the end of 2003 and to increase overall 
earnings by 8% to
  10% compounded annually in the next four years, Baum said.

  That success is whipping up customer ire.

  "People tend to look at Sempra-SDG&E as a monolith. . . . People are 
saying, 'They're
  making a ton of money here. That company is doing very well. We're getting 
screwed, and
  we don't like it, and why should we have to pay for it?' " Baum said. "It's 
a very natural
  reaction. People don't understand, and they don't care to understand."

  One of SDG&E's immediate concerns is fixing relations with its customers. 
Baum said the
  utility recently polled customers and found that 9% considered it credible, 
down from 35%
  ("which is not much to brag about, but it's not bad in the utility 
business") before the
  electricity crisis.

  "I don't know that a corporation can do very well with a credibility rating 
of 9% on a
  sustained basis. That is something I worry about," Baum said.

  SDG&E President Debra L. Reed said most customers don't understand that the
  investor-owned utilities are now only distribution companies, despite a 
$90-million education
  campaign by the Public Utilities Commission.

  "They see our name on the bill and they think we're making money on the 
commodity,"
  Reed said. "We have a lot of education to do with our customers. But we 
realize that it is
  probably not the best time to educate them in the middle of what they see 
as a crisis. . . .
  What we're trying to do is help them through this."

  Is Another Energy Crisis Ahead?; Winter Fuel Costs Will Rise; After That, 
Nothing Is
  Certain 
  Kenneth Bredemeier

  This winter the mailman will be delivering markedly higher heating bills 
throughout much of
  the country, including the Washington area.

  Those who use natural gas--the dominant heating fuel in the Washington area 
and
  throughout the United States--face a 27 percent increase. Heating oil 
customers,
  particularly in the Northeast where 35 percent of homeowners use the fuel 
to warm their
  houses, may have to pay more than $2 a gallon--twice the current price--as 
the days grow
  shorter and temperatures plunge.

  Motorists get hit in the wallet every time they pull into a service 
station: They now typically
  pay more than $1.60 a gallon for gas, and the days of 90-cent-a-gallon 
gas--yes, it was just
  last year--are but a distant memory. At least that's better than in 
England, France and
  Belgium where motorists are waiting in long lines to buy $4-a-gallon gas, 
only to find that
  some stations have run out.

  Is this the start of an energy crisis?

  Many energy analysts and government economists say not, that supplies of 
various forms
  of energy will prove sufficient over the next few months, but that the 
costs will continue to
  follow the law of supply and demand. When there's not an excess of a fuel 
available--and
  numerous types of fuel reserves are quite low--consumers will likely think 
the product costs
  too much, at least compared with the prices they've been accustomed to 
paying.

  But as winter approaches, several loosely connected events that spanned the 
globe over
  the past couple of years have heightened awareness of energy in our lives 
and reminded us
  of a lesson learned in the 1970s: Energy prices can be volatile, 
unpredictable and can
  reverberate throughout the economy.

  As Philip Verleger Jr., a partner with the Brattle Group, a Cambridge, 
Mass., economic
  consulting firm, concluded, "Consumers will have to spend more on energy. 
They will have
  less to spend on other things."

  On top of the triple-whammy of higher natural gas, heating oil and gasoline 
prices,
  consumers are also vulnerable to the vagaries of the electricity market 
because the industry
  has been in the midst of deregulation .

  While California and other states have struggled with power prices during 
the adjustment to
  the new competitive environment, electric utilities locally have maintained 
stability.
  Potomac Electric Power Co. says its 621,000 residential customers in the 
District and
  suburban Maryland--about 15 percent to 20 percent of whom heat their homes 
with
  electricity--will find their bills about 5.5 percent lower this winter, 
assuming they use the
  same amount of electricity as last year. Across the Potomac River,Dominion 
Virginia
  Power's customers in Northern Virginia are likely to see their bills stay 
about the same.

  Much of the current energy pricing is out of consumers' hands, analysts 
say, because the
  United States has chosen, to a large degree, to remain dependent on oil 
pumped out of
  distant lands controlled by OPEC nations.

  The 11-member Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed last 
weekend to
  increase its oil production by 800,000 barrels a day in hopes of pushing 
the price down to
  $28 or so. Even so, oil prices hit a new 10-year high on Friday, closing at 
$35.92 a barrel
  amid worries about tensions between Iraq and Kuwait. These are prices not 
seen since the
  days of the military buildup before the Persian Gulf War in November 1990.

  Analysts say that 21 months ago, when oil was below $10 a barrel and 
natural gas was at
  $2 per 1,000 cubic feet, drilling companies, many of which produce both 
fuels, began to
  curtail their exploration as a result of dwindling revenue.

  The OPEC nations cut their production at the time to force prices 
upward--and now they
  have more than tripled. Private exploration for more natural gas in the 
United States, chiefly
  in the Gulf of Mexico and several southern and southwestern states, only 
grew after drillers
  concluded that the demand was significant enough and they had sufficient 
capital to look
  for more.

  Peggy Laramie, spokeswoman for the American Gas Association, the 
natural-gas utilities'
  trade group, said the low price of gas at the time contributed to a feeling 
by producers that
  there was plenty of supply, so they cut back on drilling for about nine 
months, from August
  1998 to April 1999. Fewer than 400 rigs were drilling at the time, although 
now that figure
  has topped 800.

  With little new natural gas exploration, the flow through the supply chain 
slowed, of course,
  even as demand increased in the United States, Europe and Asia.

  The result was predictable: Higher natural-gas prices at the wellhead and, 
over time, bigger
  bills for consumers. The $2 wellhead price has now risen to $5. Laramie 
said the last time
  wellhead prices were this high was in 1985.

  As Verleger said, "Demand was growing. We didn't pick up the supply 
and--whoops, there's
  a problem."

  In the Washington area, where perhaps 70 percent of all homeowners heat 
with natural gas,
  Washington Gas Light Co. estimates that its residential customers will see 
the typical
  monthly bill jump $26, to $112.50, in the November-to-April period, a 27 
percent increase
  over last winter.

  Laramie said the gas utilities' trade group believes that with the renewed 
exploration, natural
  gas prices "will be moderating by spring, but we don't want to 
over-promise."

  The price of oil and its derivative products is expected to remain 
volatile, depending on a
  host of factors, including demand by consuming nations, the severity of the 
upcoming
  winter months after a string of three relatively mild winters, and how much 
more oil OPEC
  nations might decide to produce if prices stay high.

  This mix of factors leaves the analysts, OPEC and government economists 
using a lot of
  "ifs" and "buts" and "possibilities," but mentioning few certainties.

  OPEC President Ali Rodriguez predicted this past week that oil prices could 
reach $40 a
  barrel this winter, even if only for a relatively short time.

  "Crude oil prices are very high and will remain very high throughout the 
rest of the year,"
  said John Lichtblau, chairman of the Petroleum Industry Research 
Foundation, which is
  funded by oil companies. In terms of gasoline, a shortage is unlikely, "but 
prices will be
  high," he said. "It can go back to $1.40 a gallon because of more 
production and lower
  crude prices. It won't start right now, maybe later this year or early next 
year."

  But with heating oil, he said, an unusually cold winter in the Northeast 
could bring about
  problems, given low inventories. "I don't see a shortage, but prices will 
be very high."

  Verleger was less certain.

  "We do have a problem," he said. "I think we're going to see high prices 
this winter for
  heating oil and natural gas. But I'm not certain about it. I'm not willing 
to go out and say it's
  going to be awful."

  With oil prices at record levels, President Clinton last week came under 
increasing
  pressure to tap the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve, nearly 570 
million barrels of crude
  oil stashed at four sites in Louisiana and Texas.

  The reserve is intended for use in cases where the president determines 
there is a national
  supply emergency. High prices alone do not qualify. The White House says 
all options to
  combat the current low reserves of various fuels and high prices are under 
consideration. In
  the past, however, the oil reserve has been tapped to combat mechanical 
breakdowns in
  the oil industry's pipeline system or to trade lower-quality oil for a 
better grade.

  "If the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is released, that would knock $15 a 
barrel off the price,"
  Verleger said. "One piece of news like that and this [crude oil price] will 
drop like a rock."

  At least for the winter months, electric utilities generally have found a 
way around the high
  price of oil and natural gas that some of them must use during peak-demand 
periods in the
  summer to generate electricity. They're able to focus their winter 
generation on cheaper
  fuels--coal, nuclear and hydroelectric power.

  "That's cheaper fuel and fuel that's less subject to the volatility of the 
world oil and world
  natural-gas markets," said Chuck Linderman, director of energy generation 
and supply
  policy for the Edison trade group. "Generally we're in good shape on 
supply."

Hi Steven,

 Attached is the first of four documents that we have prepared for
the focus groups.  All of the exercises are works in progress and I am
sending them to you for comments. (Hopefully, we are on the right track.)
As we discussed, I am happy to fly down to Houston tomorrow so that we can
review these materials together.  If, however, you feel that we can edit the
exercises via email that's fine too. Just let me know which arrangement
makes you the most sense to you. Hope all is well.

Regards,

Liz

SmartEnergy, a Con Edison competitor, is offering New York and Westchester
consumers price protection with the ability to lock-in today's natural-gas
rates for a period of one year. In a separate announcement, myHomeKey.com
announced that it will offer energy savings packages designed to reduce
energy consumption and lower rates for customers in the face of rising
energy costs.

ANALYSIS: As reports continue to accumulate that a natural-gas shortage
will send prices skyrocketing this winter (see my IssueAlert from Oct.
9 on the subject), the most common response from electric utilities has
been to warn their customers that they will see higher rates over the next
few months. I can point to several examples. Minneapolis-based Xcel Energy
announced a few weeks back that its natural-gas customers could face heatin=
g
bills that are 35 to 50 percent higher than their bills last winter. Domini=
on
East Ohio has warned its residential customers that they can expect to
pay about $70 more per month for natural gas from November through January.
And the warnings are coming not only in the Midwest and Northeast=01*where
low winter temperatures drive up energy bills every year=01*but in the West
as well. In California, PG&E warns that its customers can expect to see
their winter bills increase by about $25, to an average bill of $75 (compar=
ed
to $50 last winter). These are just a few examples of utility companies
across the United States playing damage control, trying to minimize the
customer outrage when customers suddenly see their bills double or triple.

Along with their warnings, these utilities give reasons=01*perhaps seen as
excuses by the public=01*for the rising cost of energy. There is a shortage
of natural gas across the country, brought about by a drop-off in productio=
n.
It was an unusually hot summer, which depleted supplies for energy. Demand
in general has grown to surprising levels.

Meanwhile, start-up online companies that many of us have not even heard
of are using the rise in natural-gas prices as a golden marketing opportuni=
ty,
and attempting to take business away from traditional utility companies.
SmartEnergy is a perfect example. In existence just since April 1999,
SmartEnergy offers electricity and natural gas to residential and small
business customers. According to EnergyGuide.com, for an average home in
New York City, SmartEnergy's natural-gas rates typically have run about
$189 per month, compared Con Edison's $140. Under its new promotion,=20
SmartEnergy's
plan for natural gas guarantees that New York City and Westchester gas
customers who sign on with their service now will be locked into current
natural-gas rates for the next 12 months. This promotion comes at an ideal
time for those who opt to switch, as natural-gas prices should begin their
projected sharp increase over the next few weeks. Based on recent forecasts=
,
SmartEnergy is claiming that Con Edison customers who make the switch can
expect to save up to 40 percent on their energy through the winter months.
The start-up company also is offering 500 United Airlines Mileage Plus
Reward Miles credit and $25 sign-up bonus to entice customers away from
Con Edison.

Based on the available information about SmartEnergy, it is unclear how
the online provider will be able to guarantee the 40-percent reduction
in natural-gas rates. I would presume that SmartEnergy has entered into
some hedging strategies to minimize its risk in the event that natural-gas
prices remain high into the next year. Any prudent provider would have
a hedging strategy to protect itself, and locking itself into 12-month
contracts without its own contracts for obtaining natural gas at spot marke=
t
prices would certainly raise questions about the future of SmartEnergy.
In addition, SmartEnergy will have difficulty in recruiting customers away
from Con Edison and other utility providers. Many customers still have
reservations about signing on with an online company that they do not know.
There will be some customers who jump at the chance to lock in current
rates for 12 months, but many others will stick with the company that they
know even if their rates increase.

I did a quick search around Con Edison's Website to see if it might be
offering an alternative offer to retain its customers, but could find nothi=
ng
that the utility is doing to specifically address the projected increase
in natural-gas prices this winter. Con Edison does offer a level billing
program in which customers receive a consistent bill amount each month,
alleviating fluctuation in their bills. Yet, as a utility company, Con
Edison has a standard offer of service that regulators closely monitor.
It is possible that Con Edison could request changes to the standard offer
service, which would likely need to be approved by the New York Public
Service Commission. The PSC could agree, or determine that the competitive
offers by providers such as Smart Energy are a positive result of=20
deregulation.
In addition, Con Edison could be hampered by fuel contracts that may not
allow it much flexibility with regard to lowering its rates. Overall, Con
Edison probably does not have a lot of flexibility regarding the rates
it can charge customers, thereby making this offer from SmartEnergy difficu=
lt
to beat.

The other online start-up taking advantage of natural-gas prices is=20
myHomeKey.com,
which made a recent promise to reduce home heating, oil, natural-gas, and
electricity rates. The marketing route that this online start-up is taking
is energy efficiency=01*teaching households how to more effectively use the=

energy and, hopefully, save money as a result. Energy is not the only servi=

myHomeKey.com
just recently launched co-branded sites with KeySpan Corp. and TXU Energy
Services to "provide millions of local customers" with the ability to check
energy efficiency in their homes.

What's important to note about these two developments is the advantage
that online energy providers have over traditional utilities. As utilities
try to disengage themselves from regulatory-bound rate structures, online
companies have the freedom and flexibility to offer attractive products
and billing options to customers in deregulated states. There are the onlin=

providers that we know about, such as Utility.com and Essential.com.=20
Utility.com
has not yet started to sell natural gas, although it has established a
partnership with Sempra Energy in which Sempra Energy Trading will sell
natural gas in deregulated markets via the Utility.com Web site. Utility.co=

plans to start selling natural gas by the end of this year, but it has

to open up its service across the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions. Yet,
on a weekly basis, new start-up online energy providers surface, eager
to grab their own share of the retail market.

I also wonder where The New Power Company is in all of this rush to capital=
ize
on the marketing opportunities surrounding the rise in natural-gas prices.
It would seem like a natural for TNPC to make a big splash with its own
marketing efforts, as it already promises lower prices for both natural
gas and electricity. In any event, as the natural-gas shortage may become
a public relations nightmare for utility companies across the country,
it conversely could work to the advantage of the more agile online provider=

the future are expected to be fired by natural gas. However, shortages
caused by cutbacks in exploration budgets and restrictions on where
new drilling can occur have analysts predicting gas prices this winter
will be the highest they've ever been. Should there be a change in
policy to encourage exploration and production of natural gas on
federal lands and the continental shelf to help meet future demand
requirements?

SELECTED RESPONSES:


  I have been following the California story for some time. I have
consulted with CA utilities over the past 9 years and have spent
considerable time examining the recent events and their history. I
believe each and every person that reviewed and approved
California's deregulation should be required to go back to school
and take Economics 101. I don't believe the AG in California will
find any manipulation unless the generators have figured a way to
control the weather - and raise temperatures 10-15 degrees above
normal.  There is no significant baseline power in California. The
consumers, regulators and politicians in California that have been
pushing for deregulation are experiencing first hand the effects the
flawed legislation California enacted and the reality of economics.
  The regulators in California, the NE part of the country, and
elsewhere created imbalanced markets in the 1980's and early 1990's.
We now are asking the same agencies, if not the same individuals,
that created the mess to fix it. Talk about the fox watching the hen
house, but its even better. The fox built a hen house and is being
asked to fix the problem now that we're noticing chickens are
missing.
  Spot market prices for ANY commodity will skyrocket, when demand
increases dramatically and supply is limited.  If you cap prices,
you'll almost certainly create shortages. I would have hoped we
would have learned something from the seventy years of Communist
rule in Russia. Can you say "RATIONING"?  Almost everyone has been
misled to believe electric prices will decline under "competition"
without examining the underlying capital and operating realities of
the electric industry compared to other "deregulated industries."
If you want your power at prices below those a free market will
support, be prepared to go without your electricity at times.
  After an accurate comparison of the electric industry to other
deregulated industries, you will discover that in a "fully"
deregulated electric industry, retail electric prices will average
from 10 to 20 percent higher than existing prices. And prices will
reach from five to ten times above current prices at times during
demand spikes.
  David L. Robbins, N/A, N/A
  David.Robbins@WellsFargo.COM

----------------------------------------------------

  The answer is Yes and No.
  Tremendous price increases for the cost of energy over the last 6
months have an inevitable impact on the cost of generating electricity.
  However, those price increases do not cover the full extent of the
increased cost for electricity for San Diego Gas and Electric.  My
sources tell me that there has been some collusion among the major
IPPs servicing SDG&E which accounts for some of the other increases.
  SDG&E's mismanagement accounts for the rest.
  Carl R. Clark, President, Energetech Corp.
  cclark@energetech.com

----------------------------------------------------

  Was any assistance offered recently when the price of gas
increased? Would any assistance be offered in any substantive way if
the price of sugar or rice increased?
  The increase in electricity prices is a function of a mismatch
between supply and demand.
  The consumers' concerns about this issue should be heard by
suppliers in the form of new peaking power units, cogeneration,
combined-cycle technology or improvements to the efficiency of
existing generating plants.
  If local suppliers are unwilling or unable to address the issue,
new suppliers will do so.
  "Market forces" work well enough in other sectors; they will work in
CA given time.
  David Whitehead, VP Sales - GENTRACK, Sanderson Computers
  davidw@gentrack.com

----------------------------------------------------

  The generators are closely following the rules set by the
independent system operator.  The solution would be to have the
consumers educated enough to demand, and pay for, a service that
provides them consistent pricing - this would be a niche for a
service provider to go to the generators and capture enough
generation capacity at a given rate to meet the customer demands.
One thing that is not discussed in any of these articles is the
average price of electricity over a longer period, say the entire
year.  In addition, as I recall, during the transition period, the
ratepayers received quite a reduction in rates.
  Gary Hilberg, Vice President - Business Development, The PIC
  Energy Group
  ghilberg@picworld.com

----------------------------------------------------

  Competition is as competition does, usually with little thinking or
planning involved.  Some of us in California tried to bring various
forms of planning and scenario forecasting to management and public
eyes on thoughts on the future.   But scenarios of belief in the
grow-and-build era of the 60s-70s tended to over-forecast load
growth for nuclear power (7%a year), just as it was logical for
management to believe in low forecasts for the 90s (2% a year) in
the deregulation era.
  The reality of growth cycles is a bit like saying "feet in ice and
hand in fire," i.e., the average temperature is pretty comfortable.
  Was AB 1890 a good thing?  No value judgement, it was a political
deal for $28 billion.  Remember Diablo Canyon.  Some CEOs and public
officials made their careers on this sort of thinking.
  Best wishes California, hopefully there will be light in the night
skies.   Place blame appropriately.

  Is this question a joke?  Of course they are. This behavior will
continue as long as the PR fog that has been created by the IOUs'
shameful campaigns while they have had their hands in our pockets.
These managements know they will not be fit to compete in a
competitive market and will do anything to keep the "fat, dumb, and
happy" mindset promoted they think that blaming their shortage
exploitation on deregulation.
  Randy Castleberry, CEO, Tempulse Information Management
  randy@tempulse.com

----------------------------------------------------

  Whether or not individual generators are trying to manipulate is not
the question and price caps are certainly not the answer.  The main
problem is that the press has been led to believe that the situation
is the result of 2 years of deregulation, not the 100 years of
regulation that led to shortages of both generation and
transmission.  In addition, one must remember that the vast majority
of generation remains under regulatory and/or legislated prices --
only about 10% is actually "bid" and cleared; no wonder the market
thinness has lead to volatility.  Second price auction certainly
doesn't help, since everybody gets paid whatever (the one
manipulating?) is the highest bidder's bid.  Price caps will only
stifle the construction of new supply and new supply is half of the
answer to price volatility.  The other half is meaningful demand
responsive behavior -- price caps will hide true costs from
consumers and stifle that too.  A little more patience is what's
needed.

----------------------------------------------------

  Oh sure, why not -- it worked for the phone companies, right,
well, didn't it?
  Okay.  Admittedly they're making over twenty-percent returns on
investments, but you've never heard about a phone brownout, have
you? ;)
  David Draper, Regulatory Analyst, Florida Public Commission
  DDraper@PSC.STATE.FL.US

----------------------------------------------------

  Power marketers (and utilities with generating capacity to sell and
traders to sell it) are not manipulating the market, just taking
advantage of the opportunities it is offering.  That's what a
market, unfettered by regulation, is about.  The answer to your
second question, then, is that price caps are clearly re-regulation
and anti-free market.  We either deregulate or re-regulate the
electric industry.
  Reginald Ankrom, President, EnNova Energy Solutions
  rankrom@rnet.com

----------------------------------------------------

  You reap what you sow.  CA rushed into deregulation without a
complete review of the impact.  Market value means profit and any
company, to remain in business, looks at the profit motive as the
primary driving force.
  Putting a cap on prices is going back to the old system of
guaranteeing a profit without regard to efficiency and conservation.
  The current system, like all systems in the past, will eventually
self correct.  Users and suppliers will reach a common plateau.  It
may take some time and may hurt financially but eventually we will
work it out.
  The United States has historically swung in large amplitudes in
everything we have done.  From complete isolationism prior to WWII
to complete globalization in the 1950s and 1960s; from no
environmental controls to (what some people may consider excessive)
tight controls.
  I wish us a happy future.

  If coal is the least expensive fuel, install two used coal-fired
steam generators (boilers), each capable of supplying turbo-
generators adequate for the entire San Diego County load.
  As an alternative, install used boilers capable of burning waste
fuel to supply the turbo-generators; free fuel is a very good price.
San Diego can surely issue the various permits?
  Sell any surplus power, so the residents of San Diego can enjoy
free electricity, i.e., generate for 3 cents/KWh and sell it for 6.
  I understand a large quantity of used equipment is available?

----------------------------------------------------

  Market manipulation, no. Taking advantage of a somewhat silly
demand/supply imbalance situation, yes. The analogy that comes to
mind is that of a farmer whose crops in the midst of a drought are
doing okay, so he can charge more for them. (We should remember that
this same farmer at other times will suffer through lean times where
supply exceeds demand.)
  A few additional points:
  1. The current focus in the press is on summer price spikes. What
about the generally lower energy commodity prices that SDG&E
ratepayers got in the winter and spring?
  2. Until a bunch of merchant plant capacity comes online to serve
the California market, things may get uglier before they get better.
Then again, maybe Mr. Greenspan's interest rate hikes finally will
begin to take effect.
  3. Summer price spikes in California seem to be lower than spot
market situations that occasionally occur in the Midwest and in the
New York area.
  4. How about getting the CEC off its duff and getting some
additional generating and transmission capacity approved?
  5. Don't count out DSM completely yet (at least for peak-shaving).
  Phil Sisson, N/A, Sisson and Associates, Inc.
  pasisson@mcgi.com

----------------------------------------------------

  Price spikes in California, as in other parts of the country, are a
sign of electricity markets that are not entirely efficient or
competitive.  In the specific case of California, the reasons for
this can be found in the way that the state has deregulated the
market and the subsequent actions they have taken in an attempt to
control it.
  Cal-ISO's creation of the government-granted monopoly known as the
PX or power exchange helped to ensure that California's market could
never truly be efficient.  Many of California's generators are
forced to buy and sell from this power pool which discourages the
development of a true, robust bilateral market for wholesale
electricity.  The introduction of further price caps not only
discourages power marketers from short-term sales into the state in
times of need, but also creates an atmosphere that will discourage
long-term entry as well as the development of independent generation.
  California needs real, robust competition -- not another step deeper
into the regulatory morass that they have created.
  Kevin O'Donovan, Director, Government Affairs, Industry Networks
  kmodonovan@hotmail.com

----------------------------------------------------

  I live in the Pacific Northwest yet we are paying prices as high,
and at times higher, than southern California. Generators are
withholding power until pricing reaches acceptable levels in markets
where they can sell, not in local service areas.    Why else would
generation be reduced "for economic reasons"?  Once again
opportunists have twisted a good idea into a profitable venture for
a very small group.  The concept of deregulation was to enhance
competition through freedom of choice of the end user, NOT THE
SUPPLIER.  We are a captive audience.  Try to get by for just one
day without use of electricity.    When price controls were removed,
generators and marketers were allowed to set pricing at whatever
level they wanted.  There is not one single fuel source used by
medium to large generators that costs an equivalent of  $250 per MWh.
  A solution would be to cap prices, not at a fixed level, but at a
cost of service (fuels, maintenance, labor, etc.) plus a maximum
allowable profit margin.  Also, require generators to run regardless
of economics.  Under the "must run" would be a requirement to
satisfy native loads and contract obligations before selling power
outside of local service territories.  Let's get away from pricing
based on whatever the market will bear and get back to pricing based
on cost of service.  Let the electric industry face the same
economic problems as the rest of industry.

  Manager, N/A
  N/A

----------------------------------------------------

  I believe that the current, deregulated, marketing infrastructure
invites manipulation and artificially inflated rates simply because
the new laissez-faire market has no real constraints.  The new
arbitrage trading has created multiple layers of parasites who are
living well by adding no value to the commodity...only extra cost to
the end user.  The trend of abuse is clear and I think price
ceilings are inevitable.
  Roy (Chip) Burton, Project Engineer, Multi-Level Technologies, Inc.
  Chip@m-lti.com

----------------------------------------------------

  As a market moves up the supply curve on peak, there is no doubt that there
is more supplier concentration, and the potential for market manipulation.
However, price caps are not a satisfactory long-term solution to high
prices. They will inevitably lead to blackouts. A better long-term solution
will be encourage more competition by identifying and removing barriers to
new peaking and base load generation, particularly distributed generation,
that can be located in load centers to serve peak loads.
  Peter Evans, Senior Vice President, Catalytica Combustion Systems
  PEvans@mv.catalytica-inc.com

----------------------------------------------------

  The two-part question goes first to motive, then to solution.
  No one can prove THAT the generators are gaming the system, versus
the system is working as it should.  The fact is that the result of
operating the open market system as presently designed is
unacceptable. It is totally unacceptable that the competitive market
in California is supposed to, and attempting to, operate in a
condition of supply-demand-price equilibrium that does not exist.
That Californians should pay many billions of extra dollars to
support an ineffective market system imposed upon them by regulators
and legislators in the name of lower costs is sane only to those
currently lining their pockets. That price caps are needed in this
ineffective or, as some people laughingly call it, imperfect market
goes without question. That generators or marketers cannot make a
buck at a $250 per MWh cap is laughable. This is five times more
than consumers ever paid for energy.
  The only issue that needs resolving is how long the price caps
should remain in effect. That answer should depend on when the
promised market-in-equilibrium can be brought to bear, and when a
workable western RTO can guarantee economic transmission rates for
California consumers.
  Otherwise, re-regulate. At any cost, it will be cheaper than where
we're heading.
  Joe Bongiovanni, General Manager, Hardwick Electric Department
  Joebhed@aol.com

----------------------------------------------------

  I believe that the people in San Diego are not able to see the full
picture regarding deregulation of electric rates.  They were
proposed as a means of overall rate reduction because of
competition, and on a yearly basis this is still possible.
  (1) Electricity was already high in California because of the
environmental controls and difficulty of building new plants.
  (2) Very few new plants are being built, and a perfectly good
plant at San Onofre (Unit 1) was shut down reducing our resource margins.
  (3) Californians were not told that price volatility will be high in
a free market as the price charged will be the price of the most
expensive unit on line.
  (4) Today, no one is talking about what happens during the low
demand periods when the competition for selling power will be very
high driving the price down to the point that some plants will
probably want to pay you to use power so that they can stay on line.
  Thus, the situation of a free market system for electricity is not
good for either a public that wants consistent bills or the power
producers that can make money only when demand is very high. It will
take several years of bumpy conditions to iron out the competitive
market for electricity.
  Bill Hannaman, P.E., Senior Staff Engineer, DS&S
  hannamang@ds-s.com

----------------------------------------------------

  Don't blame this situation on the market players - a utility
without generation is like a race car without tires. Until
investors, customers, and employees stand as one against utilities
selling off all their generation, this situation will continue to be
one of simple market economics (supply vs. demand). The only winners
are the executives of these utilities as they get rewarded for the
high sale prices of the plants, while customers are exposed to
higher prices and lower reliability and, sadly, employees lose jobs,
pay level, and seniority that are hard, if not impossible, to replace.
  Frank Richards, Technical Sales Rep., Austin Energy
  Frank.Richards@austinenergy.com

----------------------------------------------------

  IF there is manipulation of prices, price caps are not the way to
penalize the criminals because price caps affect every single
seller, not the individual or handful of individuals who are
restraining the market and acting against the public interest. I do
tend to believe that price runups in California today aren't due to
market manipulators so much as they are due to the regulatory
neglect (and complacency bordering on hubris) CA has labored under
for the past 15 years (with no new plants being built while domestic
demand grew and regional available importable supply shrank).
  Returning to price caps, isn't it fairly simple to illustrate that
the California caps have served to do the following:  normal sellers
of power sell at x.  Let's say there are nefarious actors who
withhold power to later sell it at artificially inflated prices, of
x + 10, rather than the market rate of x + 1 that would have arisen
as demand increased and supply tightened.  This is crude but bear
with me.  In high dudgeon the politicians intervene and impose a cap
of x - 10, which captures the bad actors but also unfortunately
penalizes all of the other actors in the market, slam dunking them
in order to stop the few bad actors. Results:
  All the investors who put money into the market in good faith that
the rules would allow them to make an adequate return on their
investment, are now penalized by caps that shave off money from
their profit-making times in the market, for what is so far an
unproven allegation against other unspecified bad actors.  So how
many will want to build in this "market," with this new and highly
volatile form of risk?
  And, what California accomplished for fifteen years through
regulatory neglect, it will now persist to accomplish through
political intemperance.  Putting caps onto the market will not solve
shortages, it will not solve price problems, more plants will not be
built, transmission won't be built, reliability will get worse.
California is in for many more years of problems if they don't put
their energy problems in order.
  What is with California and price controls?  First President Richard
Nixon, who imposed national wage and price controls which failed
miserably, had to be pulled off because they only hid, not solved,
problems that continued to fester, and contributed greatly to the
inflation of the later 1970s.  Now price caps, which will do about
the same.

----------------------------------------------------

  The "Electric Wholesale Market" and "Deregulation" in general is
primarily in name only.  One of the regional issues is the allowance
of existing monopolistic participants to divest wholesale production
in their own service territory and to ultimately repurchase
wholesale production under non-regulated entities in the same
electrical region.  Allowing the same entities to have monopolistic
ownership of the transportation and distribution of the product,
while also owning non-regulated regional wholesale production of the
product, begs for market problems.   Placing caps on the wholesale
price of the product not only masks the real issues, but also could
prevent the entrance of new participants.
  Anonymous, Senior Domestic Marketing Manager, N/A

----------------------------------------------------

  Are power generators deliberately manipulating the market to obtain
higher profits in San Diego?  Of course they are -- the bidding
rules for selling power into the PX require that all producers
receive the price asked for by the most expensive producer selected.
  Thus, there is a tremendous profit-making incentive to withhold
power until the price goes up.
  But the bidding rules are only a part of the problem.  The whole
premise that electric power can be delivered competitively is a big
lie.  Why?  As economist Eugene Coyle explains in "Price
Discrimination, Electronic Redlining, And Price Fixing in
Deregulated Electric Power" (Washington, DC: American Public Power
Association), a commodity product with high fixed costs will force
producers to discriminate between customers, to collude with each
other to maintain profits, and to merge to eliminate competitors.
The best examples are the airlines, which charge different prices
between leisure and business customers, who collude through their
ticketing computers, and who have merged into four or so major
carriers (and they are exploring joint ventures to reduce it to
about two or three).  The same is now happening in deregulated
 electricity.
  Many will argue that electricity competition hasn't been given a
fair chance.  However, even if you believe that competition can
somehow develop in a commodity market with high fixed costs, who
will have the political muscle to create more competitive wholesale
markets, which will require true open access to the transmission
system?  Enron, the loudest promoter of open access, just got its
butt kicked by the big investor-owned utilities, which have proved
their strength on Capitol Hill by killing open access legislation.
And the big for-profit holding companies are very strong at the
state level as well.
  So, just as we have been saying for more than four years,
deregulation will only lead to unregulated monopolies, because of
the physical and economic nature of the electric power itself, and
because no one has the political power to enact the structural
reforms needed to overcome the power of the for-profit holding
companies that still completely dominate this industry.
  Charlie Higley, Energy Research Director, Public Citizen

----------------------------------------------------

  I believe the answer to the question is NO!  The problem is lack
of supply during peak demand periods.  The cry for re-regulation is
ludicrous.  Part of what FERC intended with the implementation of
wholesale deregulation was for the market to send accurate price
signals to the supply side so they would be motivated to develop and
innovate new forms of supply and demand side management.  And this
is precisely what is occurring.
  Politicians are ignoring the fact that the price of natural gas
has at least doubled in the last several months, the electric supply
from the Pacific Northwest is reduced because of reduced summer
run-offs that supply the extensive hydro system, an unplanned
nuclear plant outage, as well as very hot weather covering the
entire West Coast.  All of the combined events have contributed to
the current problems faced in the West and, more specifically,
southern California.  Is anyone complaining, when during light load
periods, the price of power is low and at times almost zero?  Would
"regulation" have changed any of this?  I fail to see how.  As long
as consumption goes unchecked and the "not in my backyard" (NIMBY)
prevails when companies propose additional new generation and
transmission facilities, we will continue to have high prices during
peak demand. While the above is a simplification of the problems
being faced in the West, these are some of the basic issues that
need to be addressed whether wholesale deregulation had been
implemented or not.

----------------------------------------------------

  Hot weather and lack of surplus capacity caused the price spikes
and price caps now just prolong the pain.  The state of California's
actions in imposing wholesale price caps is a simple issue of
politically motivated interference in the free market that will
ultimately harm consumers.  The price caps tarnish the allure of
investing in new generating capacity and the incentive for
electricity buyers to plan ahead more effectively.  How many lotto
tickets would a state sell if the politicos decided that a $3
million prize is too extravagant?  Would reducing lotto winnings to
$1,000 make it a better producer of state revenue?
  There are market-based forwards, derivatives and other mechanisms
for buyers and retailers to protect themselves from price spikes
caused by summer supply shortages.
  The long-term answer is to let the market provide financial rewards
To those who take risk to build generating capacity.  When enough new
generators join in, the market will reach equilibrium.
  Eric C. Williams, Market Solutions Analyst, EPRI Market Solutions
  ewilliam@epri.com

----------------------------------------------------

  Assuming that the excess demand in the wholesale market is based
on capacity limits, then capping market rates confuses the situation
by encouraging consumption and discouraging conservation and the
availability of alternative supply sources.
  The de facto vertically integrated electric utility system with its
comprehensive regulatory oversight has been in place since circa
1935. Transition to a restructured system is going to take more than
a few years. In the meantime, dealing with system peak loads is
where attention should be focused.  Reregulation and wholesale
market caps on prices harken back to the old system.  It's time to
begin figuring out how to deal with these system peaks more creatively.

USA: Calif. allows SDG&E to strike bilateral power deals.
  
09/21/2000 
Reuters English News Service 
(C) Reuters Limited 2000. 
SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 21 (Reuters) - California regulators on Thursday approved 
an order allowing utility San Diego Gas and Electric to buy power through 
bilateral contracts. 
The utility had previously been mandated to buy all its power through the 
Pasadena-based California Power Exchange. 
The contracts can be for up to five years and must expire by December 31, 
2005. The amount of power that can be bought is limited but a CPUC spokesman 
could not immediately confirm details of the restriction. 
Last month, the California Public Utilities Commission allowed the state's 
other two investor owned utilities, Rosemead-based Southern California Edison 
and San Francisco-based Pacific Gas and Electric to buy power on bilateral 
contracts under similar terms. 
Wholesale electricity prices have risen to record levels this year, resulting 
in sharply higher power bills for SDG&E customers, who were the first in the 
nation to pay market-based prices without a safety net. 
The price spike for customers was exacerbated by a lack of hedging by SDG&E. 
The CPUC's move to allow bilateral contracts is seen as part of an attempt to 
encourage more hedging. 
San Diego Gas and Electric is a unit of Sempra Energy , Southern California 
Edison a subsidiary of Edison International and Pacific Gas and Electric a 
unit of PG&E Corp .

Please forward this to Steve Kean

The information we previously sent you was wrong based on information given 
by PG&E. Further investigation has lead to us discovering that the California 
Utilities do offer an option on all their rate schedules for all customer 
classes in which the customer can choose to install a real time meter and be 
subject to the hourly PX price.

The customer must pay for the meter (approx. $1,200) and all related metering 
activities: installation including the installation of an extra telephone 
line, maintenance and reading. 

If the customer chooses the PX Price Option, he/she will be billed the 
bundled amount credited the PX credit and added the actual usage/hour times 
PX hourly price.

However, it is very likely that very few customers and no bundled residential 
or small customers have chosen this option.

BEEP stack is the supply curve for real-time energy that the ISO develops on 
the basis of bids and offers.  The problem is that the plants the ISO 
ultimately dispatches from the stack often conflict with the merit order 
developed from the bids/offers, and the ISO has never been clear about the 
decision metrics it uses to determine ultimate dispatch.  Everyone, including 
Belden, thinks it can and ought to be a helluvalot more transparent.

As I promised this morning at the executive committee meeting, below are some 
talking points for your use.

Overall message:  the market is working, regulation is not.

In California, peak demand rose by 10% over the last 4 years while new 
capacity grew by only 2%.  But, as you would expect, the market responded by 
proposing 8,000MW of new generation - - more than enough to offset the peak 
demand growth.  The regulatory process, at both the state and local level, 
has failed to site this new generation.  The problem is regulation, not 
deregulation.

When San Diego customers began experiencing the effects of higher prices, 
Enron responded with a fixed price which would have shielded San Diego 
customers from price volatility and provided prices below their current 
summer levels (Enron's price was about $55/MWH).  After publication of 
Enron's offer, nine other companies made offers.  Again, the market responded 
where regulation failed.  San Diego has not accepted any of these offers 
because of regulatory/legislative restrictions on its ability to buy outside 
of the PX (i.e. the spot market).

In markets where siting is easier, suppliers have moved to build additional 
generation.  Enron built 3 plants in response to the 1998 price spikes.  
Those plants were planned, sited and built in less that 12 months - - in time 
for the summer of 1999.  Where regulatory hurdles are lower, the market 
responds.

The solution to current pricing and reliability issues is more competition 
not reregulation.  Policy makers should:

Open the transmission grid so that power can get from where it is to where it 
is needed.

Expedite interconnection of new generation.

Expedite siting of new facilities.

Give customers a choice, so that they have better access to demand side 
solutions.


Also attached is a more detailed discussion of California, prepared by Jeff 
Dasovich of our San Francisco office.

  California Lawmakers Vote to Limit Power Costs
  By Rebecca Smith

  09/01/2000
  The Wall Street Journal
  Page A4
  (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

  California lawmakers voted to extend modest relief to San Diego residents
burdened with
  high electricity bills and set the groundwork for faster construction of
badly needed power
  plants. They stopped short, however, of passing legislation that would
roll back retail power
  rates to levels seen prior to deregulation .

  Late Wednesday, lawmakers sent a bill to Gov. Gray Davis that limits to
6.5 cents per
  kilowatt hour the amount that small customers of San Diego Gas & Electric
Co. can be
  charged. The utility is allowed to add power-delivery and other
reasonable costs to that
  commodity price.

  The price, equivalent to a bulk power cost of $65 per megawatt hour, is
far higher than the
  average price of power for 27 of the 31 months in which California's
market has been
  deregulated. But in June and July, the average price of power obtained by
the utility from a
  state-sanctioned energy auction rose to 12 cents and 10.5 cents,
respectively, compared
  with the 2.3 cents and 2.8 cents charged in those months a year earlier.

  Passed directly through to customers,the resulting bills sparked a near
mutiny. The
  rate-cap measure applies to residential and small commercial customers,
as well as to
  schools and hospitals.

  In addition to the rate cap, which can be adjusted upward or downward by
the California
  Public Utilities Commission until December 2002, the legislature
earmarked $150 million of
  general-fund revenue, which can be used to subsidize San Diego power
costs if they greatly
  exceed the 6.5-cents-per-kilowatt-hour rate. For now, the utility would
be expected to make
  up any difference between revenue collected and the actual cost.

  Steve Baum, chairman of Sempra Energy, parent of San Diego Gas & Electric
Co., said the
  rate-cap measure is "deeply flawed" because it limits the amount prices
can rise but sets
  no floor. That means any shortfall could grow -- without a mechanism for
customers to pay
  it down -- until the end of the rate-cap period, which could last until
December 2002 or
  December 2003.

  Mr. Baum said Sempra stands to suffer an undercollection of perhaps $664
million, provided
  future prices approximate the New York Mercantile Exchange forward prices
through
  December 2002. "It's irreparably damaging to Sempra," he said because it
"creates
  tremendous uncertainty" that makes it hard for the San Diego energy
company to finance
  new projects such as a new transmission line.

  The legislature also appeared likely to approve a bill speeding up the
permit process for the
  construction of new power plants, in part by beefing up staffs of
regulatory agencies that
  review the plans.

We will hold a conference call within 1 to 1 1/2 hours after the conclusion 
of the FERC meeting this morning on California.  Joe Hartose and Donna Fulton 
are at the Commission for the meeting, and they are hoping to talk with FERC 
staff after the meeting to get a better idea of the thinking at FERC, so we 
would like to hold off on the conference call until they have these

In case you have not seen, attached is a copy of a speech Steve Peace gave on 
energy
supply.  Also:

*  I spoke with Tom Riley, UC/CSU account manager, and he has a conference 
call with
the customer tomorrow.  He feels very confident that UC/CSU San Diego will 
jump on this
issue.  We need to discuss how we want to use them and when.  Obviously the 
sooner,
the better.

* I have not heard back from The New Power Company, but Dennis has a pricing 
plan if they
are willing to move forward.  I have left a message with Lou to determine 
what his thoughts are
and should hear back tonight.

* I'm still waiting for a list of three residential customers that may be 
willing to talk, as well as
other San Diego based businesses.

Subject: California Power Issue

Following is an excerpt from a LA Times article illustrating a different, 
more negative point of view concerning deregulation compared to earlier 
articles I had sent. 
The whole article is attached at the bottom. 

 
Overconfident lawmakers even inserted as Section 330A of the Public Utilities 
Code: "It is the intent of the Legislature that a cumulative 
rate reduction of at least 20% be achieved not later than April 1, 2002, for 
residential and small commercial customers from the rates
 in effect on June 10, 1996."

Fat chance! And under deregulation, with production of electricity in 
independent hands, separated from the major utilities,
 there is a division of responsibility: When things go wrong, it is nearly 
impossible to assess whom to blame.

So where do we go from here?

Already, while ostensibly resisting re-regulation, utility officials are 
suggesting they need help. This is not surprising. Deregulation
 is one of the most oversold concepts in American life. Without a continued 
government hand, things frequently run off the tracks.

When John E. Bryson, chief of Edison, came last week to The Times to meet 
with reporters and editorial writers, he expressed 
mystification that market prices have been so high, even at times when demand 
is relatively low.

He called for a federal investigation of the price levels.

In the meantime, he and aides suggested, some price ceilings might be 
temporarily 
in order.

I suspect they might not be all that temporary.

If after joining in a $40-million utilities campaign to defeat a quixotic 
ballot initiative that would have stifled
 deregulation, Edison leaders are now proposing so much regulation, it shows 
not only a commendable candor but also 
how grim they realize the immediate prospects are.

etc. are encouraged and welcome.  I have five minutes.  Consequently, based 
on what other panelists say, and general tenor of the hearing, may end up 
emphasizing some points more and others less in opening, and use any Q & A to

Summary of Davis/Alpert bill AB 260

Retro-active to June 1, 2000 through December 31, 2002, 6.5 cent/kWh cap on 
the energy component for residential and small commercial customers (under 
100 kW).  The Commission has the ability to extend through 2003.  The 
Commission also has the ability to adjust the cap.

Commission can use revenues from utility-owned assets, refunds from FERC to 
offset the undercollections.  (In addition, a companion bill was passed that 
provides $150 million of general fund money to offset undercollections.)

Large commercial/industrial/agricultural customers have an opportunity to 
"opt-in" to the 6.5 cent/kWh cap with an annual true-up.

SDG&E will under a prudence review by the CPUC, which may be another source 
of funds to offset the undercollection.

Specific classes subject to cap:

  Schedule A, all acute care hospitals, all public and private k-12 schools, 
all accounts on AL-TOU under 100 kW.

Summary of the rate payer relief bill AB 1156 which would 
Transfer of $150,000,000 from the general fund  to a subaccount within the 
Special Fund for Economic Uncertainties.  
Appropriate those funds from the subaccount, to the commission, to reduce the 
adverse impact of high-cost wholesale energy purchases on certain ratepayers 
if a specified rate ceiling is in effect, and if the commission determines 
that a specified revenue shortfall would result in a ratepayer surcharge 
greater than 10%, and the electricity rates were directly linked to Power 
Exchange costs.  
Declare that, on January 1, 2004, any remaining balance in the account would 
revert to the General Fund.
Become operative only if AB 265 is enacted, as specified.
 Take effect immediately as an urgency statute.

FYI.  Just got a call from Jan Smutney-Jones.  Apparently, word is on the 
street that Peace intends to begin targeting Enron as an example of the 
"misconduct" that Peace alleges has occured in California's markets.  Smutney 
thinks Peace may be keying off the comments of the "unnamed" trader in the 
Dow article claiming that Enron's been buying power and holding on to it.  
Apparently Peace's other angle is/will be:  "The same people who colluded in 
the design of this market are now colluding to profit unfairly from it."  No 
idea of when and how Peace might launch any attacks.  Two immediate thoughts:

Apart from the bad reporting in the Dow article, that article shows that 
Enron got beat by, among others, two federal (Canada and the US), one state 
(SRP) and one municipal (LADWP) government.
David Freeman, who now heads up LADWP, was appointed "Czar" by the State of 
California and charged with the task of implementing Steve Peace's brain 
child (AB 1890).  Freeman set up the ISO and PX market structures.  He also 
set up the Governing Boards.

The JP Morgan report below gives further credence to the Mills/Huber thesis 
of digital-age power growth.  The in-the-trenches story is different from 
some of the academic studies by the conservation mavens.

I tend to think that Enron needs to re-position its message re:  RTOs.
>From what I can tell, we have been a proponent of Transcos before FERC for
the most part during the RTO debate.  Only Detroit Edison's Transco
proposal comes close to our initial vision.  Given that what is most likely
is a bunch of not-for-profit ISOs being created in the East and West, why
not re-establish our position.  This meeting gives us an opportunity to
really set up this distinction and draw some "bottom lines".

>From what ESCA was telling us, I don't think that they typically would go
to these as speakers.   However, it may be something they would want to do
to promote their systems (hopefully that will be consistent with the Enron
model).

Since Scott Miller and Massey of FERC are on the agenda 9/28-29 , it may
make sense for Enron to make sure that Ed Cazulet of APX and the Cal PX
people on the agenda are promoting the "Enron" model.  Cal PX is coming in
next week.

EEI is pleased to announce a three-conference series addressing RTOs and
electricity market design.

*  RTOs and Market Design:  How to Get Electricity Markets to Work.
September 28 and 29, Hilton Washington Embassy Row.
Current draft agenda attached.  This conference features a star-studded
cast of speakers addressing market design issues from all around the
country,  Keynote by Commissioner William Massey.

*  RTOs:  The October Filings
November 2 and 3, Washington D.C. (hotel information to come).
Team leaders from each of the RTOs under development that must file in
October will present their RTO plans.  EEI will have summaries of all of
the major filings available.   This conference will give everyone a chance
to be on the same page as to what the RTO filings propose and to learn what
is being developed around the country.

*  RTOs:  The January Filings

Greetings All:

Here is a cut at message points and supporting sources to back them up.  All 
errors are mine (unless, like Steve Peace, I can find someone convenient to 
point a finger at.)  Particular thanks to Bruno, who helped enormously.  The 
document is, of course, incomplete and will require considerable work, but 
hope it offers a helpful point of departure.  We plan to continue working on 
it on Monday.  If I've missed anyone on the distribution, please forward 
along.  And if anyone has any questions, don't hesitate---415.782.7822.  I 
can be reached at home this weekend at 415.621.8317.  Have a good weekend.

Best,
Jeff

We need to be careful how we position this.  I'm concerned that this may be 
perceived as Enron re-entering the residential market -- even though we're 
proposing to supply SDG&E rather than direct end-use customers.  How does 
this compare to the other eight offers SDG&E has received?

Attached is a write-up of a presentation on making a "public" offer in 
SDG&E's territory for supplying their residential load.

If we are to do this, we need to probably have something ready by late August.

Any comments?

Here are some more thoughts:
FERC should take a hard look at why the ISO is almost always in an "inc" 
situation in real time.  Without structural incentives to go short into real 
time, I would expect the CAISO to "inc" in some hours and "dec" in others -- 
with no consistent patterns.
The IOU's have four choices for purchasing power:  PX Block Forward, PX Day 
Ahead, PX Day Of, and CAISO Ex Post.  They had ample opportunity to purchase 
lower cost power in the PX Block Forward but didn't buy enough.  That left 
them short in the Day Ahead.  They can reduce Day Ahead prices by moving some 
of their load to the Ex Post market.  Dave Parquet did an Econ 101 
presentation on this incentive at the CAISO board meeting in June.
The ISO remains primarily in "inc" mode even during the shoulder months when 
prices are lower, another indicator that the real time "inc" problem is 
driven by the load side rather than the supply side.  The IOU's continue to 
go short into the ISO Ex Post market even when the CAISO Ex Post price is 
consistently above the PX Day Ahead price.
There is evidence that the IOU's are not willing to pay above the CAISO price 
cap for energy from the PX in the Day Ahead market.  Does it matter that the 
price cap for the ISO also acts as a PX price cap?
The NOx market in California is very tight.  How has this contributed to 
higher costs and has the complete lack of available NOx credits prevented any 
generators from running?
How large was the impact of the below normal water year on the supply side?  
The attached presentation quantifies this effect in the Northwest.  (I have a 
theory on how hydro capacity completely overstates reserve margins in the 
west from an economic perspective.  I can go into more detail if you wish.)
Friction between California PX and ISO markets and other western markets.  
For example, why are actual flows going into the state yet prices out side of 
the state are higher?  Another example of anomylous behavior is at COB on 
8/11 and 8/12.  There was congestion from California TO the northwest those 
days in the Day Ahead market.  In real time the NW ended up being a net 
seller of about 3,000 MW from the NW TO California.
Demand Side - we really need to press on this issue because all of the 
proponents of price caps claim that as soon as the demand side is "workably 
competitive" then there is no need for price caps.  Is large-scale economic 
demand response required for a competitive market?  What if demand response 
is there, but at very high prices?  The demand response in California is a 
joke.  With 2700 MW of interuptible, why did the utilities and the CAISO only 
get around 600 MW of economic demand response.  Much of this response comes 
at $1500/MWh.  The assymetric treatment of supply side resources and demand 
side resources can be justified on environmental grounds, but not economic 
grounds.  So why this assymetric treatment?  This gets to the question of the 
fine line between "scarcity rents" which are ok, and market power which is 
not.  If power is scarce, and demand truly values it at $1500/MWh then 
shouldn't that be the price.  At what price would the rest of the 
interuptible load economically curtail?  Bottom line -- there are about 2,000 
MW of load that should be able to respond to price signals that chooses not 
to or values power at more than $1500/MWh.
Burden of proof -- what empirical measures should be used to assess market 
power?  The reports published to date have been unimpressive.  The Market 
Analysis Unit report, for example, does a bunch of handwaving and then 
concludes that there is market power.  But they never explain why.  I would 
think that proof might be something like this:  Generator X sets price y% of 
the time when loads exceed Z MWs.  Or, four generators set price 80% of the 
time when prices exceed $200/MWh.  They have all the data to be able to tell, 
yet they don't provide any empirical measures.  The only test I've heard of 
so far is the UC Energy Institute report that demonstrates that generators 
are submitting bids above their marginal cost.  The PX report states that 
supply bids are fewer and at higher prices than last year.  They fail to 
mention the fact that there are 5,000 fewer MW of hydro this year relative to 
last.

Subject: FERC INVESTIGATION IN CA - What should they be looking for?

As we begin to meet with FERC Staff on the Wholesale market issues related to 
CA problems, I think that we need to put together a list of questions that 
FERC needs to be asking Western power market participants.  

The following are some questions that I think are important to have FERC ask; 
I'm sure there are more.

1. Were California utilities underscheduling load into the PX day ahead 
market?  
2. How many MWs did the CA ISO procure during each hour during the Summer 
2000?  How does this compare with CA ISO procurement during 1999?
3. Has PG&E changed its bidding behavior associated with its Hydro facilities 
in 2000?  
3. Are there baseload facilities that were operated differently in 2000 than 
in 1999?
4. Were any generation plants off-line due to unplanned maintenance during 
Summer 2000?
5. How did the CA ISO demand side program work?  Why didn't more load 
participate?  
6. What options did SDG&E have to "hedge" its retail rates?  What were prices 
in the CAL PX block forward market on Jan 15, 2000 and May 15, 2000?
7. How high did natural gas prices go in California for generation during 
Summer 2000?
8. Were other Western power markets prices higher (year-on-year)?
9. Did the CA ISO Board face political pressure to reduce bid caps?  Is this 
appropriate for a FERC jurisdictional entity?
10. What specific details is SDG&E referring to in its Complaint on 
"unworkably competitive" CA ISO markets?  Can these be fixed "quickly"?

Please add other questions.

Jim

  Despite Woes In California, Other States Push <B>Electricity</B>
<B>Deregulation</B>

Aug. 10, 2000
Dow Jones Online News
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

  CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)- <B>Electricity</B> <B>deregulation</B> has
suffered a setback
in California as the state grapples with short supply and rising prices.
But other states are pushing ahead with opening their <B>power</B> markets
to
competition, saying their approach should avoid the problems plaguing
the state which led the nation down the <B>deregulation</B> path four
years
ago.

  California has seen its <B>power</B> market roiled by heat waves that
left
the state scrambling to meet demand, and by soaring prices in San Diego
and southern Orange County, the first region of the country to have its
<B>power</B> market completely <B>deregulated</B>.

  "California is giving deregulation a bad name," said Texas state Sen.
David Sibley, a Republican who helped craft the bill to deregulate that
state's power industry. "But I still feel good about the bill we passed.
I feel even better about it."
  Deregulation backers outside of California said that state's
experience has been sullied by two basic shortcomings: insufficient
power generation to cover the state's demand and the exposure of retail
customers to market rates before a competitive retail market had
emerged.
  By contrast, Texas expects to have plenty of power generation on hand
when it opens its retail power markets to competition on Jan. 1, 2002.
  Unlike California -- where uncertain market conditions, local
opposition and, until recently, insufficient power prices have kept
power plant developers waiting in the wings -- Texas has attracted
billions of dollars in new power-plant investment.
  More than 10,000 megawatts will be added to the Texas grid before
competition begins, according to reports on new power plants. That's an
increase of about 20% over the state's current generating capacity.
  "The bill they passed did not send the right signals to the market,"
Sibley said of California, a Texas legislators visited before addressing
the issue in 1999. "We learned from California what we did not want to
do."
  Like Texas, Michigan hopes its success in attracting power-plant
developers to the state will help it avoid California's problems when it
allows customers to start choosing their power providers on Jan. 1,
2002. According to Gary Kitts, chief administrative officer at the
Michigan Public Service Commission, attracting independent power
producers is a key element for creating healthy competition and prices
at the retail level.
  Michigan is only in the early stages of writing the rules that will
restructure its power markets, but major developers already have begun
to show interest in building new plants in the state.
  Only days after the state passed its restructuring bills this spring,
Dallas-based Panda Energy International Inc., a privately held company,
announced plans to build a 1,000-megawatt plant by late 2004.
  Two new merchant plants already have broken ground, and three more are
in the planning stage, Kitts said.
  Likewise, Ohio regulators are hoping new power plant development will
spark healthy competition at the wholesale and retail level when
competition debuts Jan. 1, 2001.
  "We have quite a bit of generation going in the next year," said Ed
Hess, chief of the electricity division at the Ohio Public Utility
Commission.
  Ohio companies like Cinergy Corp. (CIN) and FirstEnergy Corp. (FE) are
either planning new Ohio generators or have recently brought new plants
on line.
  Like Michigan, Ohio companies won't have to sell off their plants as a
condition of deregulation and expose themselves to wholesale price
spikes as California utilities have had to do. Also, the state probably
won't see wholesale price caps similar to a $250 per megawatt-hour cap
approved last week by California's grid operator, Hess said.
  While caps can protect consumers from bloated wholesale power prices
in the short term, they can worsen the problem ultimately by deterring
development of the new power plants needed to correct supply shortages,
said Sam Rendazzo, a lawyer who represents an Ohio industrial users
group.
  "You're basically damping the pricing that developers are looking
for," he said. California is "perhaps the most dramatic evidence of a
market that's not functioning."
  In addition to counting on new generation, deregulation advocates
outside California also plan to insulate consumers from wholesale price
swings until competitive retail markets exist.
  Under the Texas restructuring law, utility rates are frozen until the
debut of competition. At that time, rates will drop 6% and hold there
for three years or until a utility has shed 40% of its customers to
competing retail suppliers.
  "There will be no authority to change rates until competition exists,"
said a Texas Public Utilities Commission spokeswoman.
  Michigan will also freeze its rates, Kitts said - for three or five
years, depending on the customer, in hopes giving competitive markets
time to develop.
  Nevertheless, California's high-profile woes are making it harder to
push deregulation elsewhere.
  Oklahoma, for example, has set a target of mid-2002 for the start of
retail competition. But the state has yet to work out the details in
legislation. The Oklahoma House of Representatives defeated a bill in
the final hour of this year's session, and a lawmaker said California's
problems will make deregulation a tougher sell in 2001.

Calif EOB Official Says ISO, PX `Don't Get It' 
  
09/21/2000 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones&Company, Inc.) 
   LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The executive director of California's
Electricity Oversight Board stressed to the state's Power Exchange and
Independent System Operator to   provide detailed information to the state
agency before making changes to their market structure.   

In an e-mail obtained by Dow Jones Newswires and sent Monday to ISO and CalPX 
officials, EOB executive director Gary Heath wrote he was unaware that the 
ISO had engaged in a new "seasonal super peak day of market" to purchase 
forward power Tuesday from Santa Clara-based Automated Power Exchange. 
The CalPX and APX have developed a proposal that would allow its customers to 
power in hour blocks directly to the ISO weekdays. 
The ISO had filed with federal regulators last week seeking authority to make 
such purchases, but apparently the Electricity Oversight Board was left in 
the dark. 
"No one seems to get it," reads the email written by Heath and sent to ISO 
and PX officials. "No more surprises from the ISO, PX, etc. This is not the 
time to change any procedures without notice to the EOB... you file with the 
(Federal Energy Regulatory Commission) seeking approval of the ISO's ability 
to buy in forwards and you have no sense to run this by the state before you 
file..." 
"We are in troubling times," Heath's e-mail states. "Both corporations must 
begin to realize that what was created by the state can be undone." 
Neither of the parties mentioned in the e-mail would comment on the issues. 
The ISO and PX are currently the target of a state audit spearheaded by state 
Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, who believes merging the two corporations will 
help California's troubled deregulated market work better for consumers. Sen. 
Peace, in past interviews, has threatened to dismantle the current ISO 
structure and have the EOB control the ISO markets. 
Heath also wrote his board was upset that the federal Bonneville Power 
Administration has managed to save California from rolling blackouts, 
referred to as a stage three emergency, "at the last minute." 
"I've got the administration on my butt wanting to know what's going on with 
BPA and we can't get a straight answer from the ISO... no more BS from the 
ISO," the e-mail states. 
Furthermore, Heath stated the ISO must run any proposed changes or additions 
to its market structure before the EOB before filing with federal regulators 
as well as providing the EOB information on power plant outages. 
"When we ask for information on outages... I expect the ISO to fully disclose 
to us," the e-mail says. "The ISO&PX are quick to make market rule changes 
but are too reluctant to make changes in your disclosure of information/data 
to the state."

Hey, the last I heard -- Tuesday -- there wasn't going to be any legislation 
--  and that's why the Gov and Lynch were taking their strong and ugly 
stances? Whast happened?

Did we try to get some language in there?  Seems as if we were out-played

Subject: Energy rate relief bill gets OK
State Senate passes rollback; legislation to go to Assembly

Energy rate relief bill gets OK
State Senate passes rollback; legislation to go to Assembly
By Ed Mendel 
STAFF WRITER 
August 11, 2000 

SACRAMENTO -- The state Senate approved legislation yesterday that would cut 
San Diego's soaring electric bills by half and could credit consumers for 
excess rates paid since June 1. 
The measure, if passed by the Assembly and signed by the governor, would 
reduce bills to the level San Diego Gas & Electric Co. customers were paying 
in July 1999. While customer payments would be cut in half, however, SDG&E 
ratepayers could be liable in several years for the balance. 
The credit to consumers would hinge on a finding of improper overcharges by 
power companies. 
The rollback-and-reimbursement measure -- carried by two San Diego Democrats, 
Sen. Dede Alpert and Assemblywoman Susan Davis -- sailed out of the Senate 
with support from 24 Democrats and four Republicans. 
All three of the Republicans who represent parts of San Diego County voted 
for the bill. The 27th vote needed for two-thirds approval of the urgency 
measure came from Sen. Bill Morrow, R-Oceanside. 
"We have a dysfunctional market that is not working and has been just so 
incredibly painful for the people I represent," Alpert told the Senate. "We 
need your help. We need it now." 
San Diego is the first area of the state fully affected by deregulation 
legislation enacted four years ago. But other areas will be deregulated 
within two years, and legislators do not want soaring rates in their 
districts. 
A vote on the Alpert-Davis bill in the Assembly was delayed for at least a 
week because of potential opposition from Republicans. Gov. Gray Davis, who 
is proposing a similar reduction that would not be retroactive to June 1, has 
taken no position on the bill. 
"It's important to keep this bill moving along," said Morrow, who said he 
struggled with the vote because the bill does nothing to speed up the 
construction of new power plants. 
The bill, AB 2290, would cut rates to the July 1, 1999, level and make the 
reduction retroactive to June 1 of this year. State and federal regulatory 
agencies would be asked to determine if San Diego ratepayers have been 
improperly overcharged. 
In the years ahead, San Diego ratepayers could be reimbursed for high rates 
paid this summer through a credit that would lower their monthly bills -- but 
only if the investigation finds an improper overcharge and that repayment can 
be collected from those responsible. 
Alpert said the cost of the credit could be born by energy generators for 
overcharging, SDG&E for failing to make cheaper energy purchases, and the 
state and federal government for not protecting ratepayers. 
"I don't think anybody believes anybody is going to be 100 percent 
responsible for this," Alpert said. 
The governor Wednesday asked the Public Utilities Commission to meet Aug. 21 
and reduce rates for SDG&E customers by half, dropping a typical residential 
bill from the current level of $120 a month to $65. 
The governor's plan is similar to the Alpert-Davis bill, but it's not 
retroactive to June 1 and would take effect this month. Critics of the 
governor's plan doubt that an investigation will result in the recovery of an 
overcharge from generators, marketers or SDG&E. 
Nettie Hoge, executive director of The Utility Reform Network, said that what 
Davis has proposed is likely to be not a true rate reduction, but simply a 
plan to spread the payment of high rates over several years. 
"San Diegans can't afford a pay now and pay later scheme," Hoge said. "They 
are in the midst of an economic and public health crisis." 
The Alpert-Davis bill needs at least six Republican votes for approval in the 
Assembly. Alpert said two Assembly Republicans representing parts of San 
Diego, Charlene Zettel of Poway and Pat Bates of Laguna Niguel, support the 
bill and are listed as co-authors. 
She hopes to get support from three other San Diego County Republicans: Steve 
Baldwin of El Cajon, Howard Kaloogian of Encinitas and Bruce Thompson of 
Fallbrook. 
Assembly GOP Leader Scott Baugh of Huntington Beach said the bill should be 
heard in committees, rather than simply put up for a vote on the house floors 
without public hearings. 
"To just ram through a rate rollback, a rate freeze and a rate reimbursement 
does nothing to address the underlying problems that created the energy 
shortage," he said. 
Baugh said he would like a discussion of the contention by some that rebate 
checks that began going out to SDG&E customers this week will solve much of 
the problem this year. 
He said standby generators could be built within six months to provide power 
in periods of peak demand to protect San Diegans from high rates next summer. 
The rebate checks are a $390 million refund for overcharges related to 
deregulation and amount to $260 for the average household. An additional $100 
million refund will take the form of a credit on bills for August and 
September, totaling $34 for the typical residence. 
At a legislative committee hearing on deregulation, Sen. Steve Peace, D-El 
Cajon, clashed with Loretta Lynch, president of the Public Utilities 
Commission. He said the refund checks only go to residences and small 
businesses, not medium-sized businesses hurt by high rates.

Talked to Dave.  In a nut shell, here are the problem areas in the bill as he 
sees it.  It was a very brief conversation, but I think I've captured the key 
points:
Based on an expectation that the "expedited siting" bill would help site 
plants, Dave's group had six plants on the drawing board.

The 5 ppm requirement kills 4 of the 6, i.e., the 4 can't meet the 5 ppm 
requirement.
The requirement that the plants would either be 1) shut down after 3 years or 
2) replaced with a combined-cycle plant kills the other 2 because a) shutting 
down the plants in 3 years kills the economics, and b) the sites for the two 
LM-6000s can't accomodate combined cylces (i.e., Dave couldn't get siting).
In addition,the generator would be required to sign an exclusive with the ISO 
(which the EOB would have to approve), which takes away the optionality of 
going to the market, thus killing the economics.
On the labor side, it's complicated, but in essence, by requiring that "...it 
be shown that the applicant has a contract with a general contractor and has 
contracted for an adequate supply of skilled labor to construct, operate, and 
maintain the plant," 
it forces Dave to negotiate a labor deal before he knows what the project is 
(i.e, before the project has been approved), and,
it effectively prevents Enron from having the option to use internal 
resources (this issue is very specific to Enron; I can explain more if folks 
prefer).

In short, bullets 1-3 would seem to affect both Enron and the market, while 
the last bullet is, according to Dave, very Enron specific.  Point 2 in 
bullet 4, according to Dave is sensitive and should not be made public.

If any questions, let me know.  Bruno has emailed the price cap and the 
"general-funds-to-help-finance-the-cap" bills, and faxed the siting bill.

Best,
Jeff

This email reflects today's events in Sacramento. The information provided is 
subject to change because of constant flux. However it is important for us to 
provide this information for feedback and to caution as to new regulations 
that may affect some deals in the making .

Governor Davis, Assembly Women Susan Davis, and Senator Alpert had a press 
conference.

They will introduce a rate/bill stabilization plan for SDG&E and an 
expediting siting bill. There is no language as of yet. 

Although there is no specific language, the following elements may be 
included:

The stabilization plan will be applicable to residential and probably 
commercial customers in SDG&E
The bill cap may be set at $68 for residential.
The cap will be in place until the end of 2002
There will be language on expediting siting for generation plants  

Sam Wehn and Sandra McCubbin have been talking with the CEC executive 
director and several legislators about the siting portion of the bill. 

Any comments as to the bill cap proposal?

With Dereg Under Fire,Enron Calif Elec Business Heats Up
By Jason Leopold

  LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- While federal regulators try to find a way to
stabilize soaring wholesale electricity prices in California, Enron Corp.
(ENE) has been quietly striking up deals with some suburban communities to
sell them fixed-price power at a lower rate.

  In the past month, the Houston-based electricity service provider entered
into long-term fixed-rate contracts with the city of Roseville and is
negotiating similar deals with the cities of San Marcos and Chula Vista. Both
of those cities currently get their power from San Diego Gas & Electric Co, a
unit of Sempra Energy Inc. (SRE), and pay market rates for electricity.
  Enron has also struck a deal with Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc.
(HOT), one of the world's largest hospitality companies, to sell the company
electricity at a fixed rate for the next 10 years. The company has four hotels
in California, three of which buy their power from SDG&E.

  Sources close to the matter said Enron has contracted to sell the hotel
power at about 6 cents per kilowatt-hour, compared with the 22.5 cents/KWh
Starwood said it was charged by SDG&E in August.

  Neither company would disclose the terms of the deal. But Starwood said it
expects to reduce its energy costs by more than $200 million over the next 10
years.

  Enron, the largest trader of electricity and natural gas in the U.S., will
purchase power to cover such contracts on the wholesale markets and use its
experience to manage the risks, while paying a fee to utilities like SDG&E for
use of their distribution networks.

  "That really is our core strength," said Harold Buchanan, chief operating
officer for Enron Energy Services North America. "We understand how to manage
those risks."

  High Rates Driving Industrial Customers, Cities To Switch

  The growing interest in fixed-price supply contracts is fueling a comeback
of sorts for Enron.

  The Houston-based company had tried to break into California's retail power
market just after deregulation, even spending nearly $1 million to advertise
the venture during the Super Bowl. But Enron gave up trying to win residential
customers in 1998, citing disappointing response and lower-than-expected
profits.

  That was when deregulation and competitive power markets were full of
promise. Oddly enough, now that deregulation is coming under attack in
California, soaring power prices are building demand for Enron's services.

  The company is fielding calls from large industrial customers in San Diego
that have seen their utility bills triple in the past three months and are
interested in signing long-term fixed-rate contracts, Buchanan said.

  "Overall, what Enron can provide is reliability pricing in San Diego that's
written in stone," Buchanan said. "It's far cheaper than what they're paying
now with the utilities."

  A number of large industrial customers negotiating with Enron declined to
comment.

  The city of Roseville, near Sacramento, entered into a $114 million contract
with Enron last month to purchase 50 megawatts of electricity for five years
at $49 per megawatt-hour.

  Furthermore, the city has started talks with Enron about building and
operating a 750-megawatt natural gas-fired power plant that city officials
expect will contribute to lower costs for the purchase of electricity.

  Mayor Harry Crabb said the plant could protect residents from the price
spikes that have plagued customers of SDG&E since June.

  San Marcos, in San Diego County, is proposing to switch electricity service
for its 10,000 residents to Enron from SDG&E - a move the City Council said
could shave about $12 million a year off the city's power bill. Enron has said
it would offer the city terms nearly identical to those it offered Roseville.

  An SDG&E spokesman said last week that the utility supports such
arrangements, saying they're one way deregulation is supposed to work.

  Enron offered earlier this summer to sell power to SDG&E itself for four
years at a fixed rate of 5.5 cents/KWh, but the utility said the price was too
high.

  California Gov. Gray Davis signed legislation two weeks ago to cap
electricity rates for SDG&E's customers at 6.5 cents/KWh.

Tim always tells me EPMI's biggest problem about accessing transmission
with the ISO is the lack of public information.  Tim wants all ISO
information - as he says "more, better, faster."  In other words he wants:
meter and outage information, water levels, bids and schedules, actual
flows, transmission availability and congestion.

Making this information available is necessary for three reasons.  This
information would help the market to police itself and provide better price
signals producing a more efficient market.  It would remove competitive
advantages held by monopsony load servers and generators owning a large
percentage of the generation in the market.  It would also, as Sue points
out, remove the transmission availability knowledge advantage held by the
grandfathered transmission contract holders.

Subject:  Re: ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS ON CA TRANSMISSION ACCESS  (Document
link: Mary Hain)

OK.  I'll take a shot in answering your questions, Steve. Others are free
to comment as well.

The transmission issues in the ISO are greatly lessened.  If you talk to
the traders, they LOVE it.  Before April1, 1998, they had no sales to CA.
Now, they have millions of dollars of sales.  Why?  -- no transmission
access to speak of before the ISO took over.

We still have some problems, however.  The problems have been there since
day one and FERC has punted on them.  We have a huge FERC case dealing with
many of them.  We also appealed a stupid FERC order on Path 15 probably at
least a year ago and have heard nothing from FERC on it. The traders have
also seriously considered a FERC complaint on Path 15.

So, what are the access issues?

Path 15 is the major constraint point between northern and southern CA.
Has been for years. The transmission fix is basically adding a third
intertie line between Tracy and Tesla. When I left PG&E in 1996, the
estimated coast was $300 million.  The congestion costs did not justify
building the line then.

PG&E continues to control Path 15 and tells the ISO what's left after PG&E
allocates the capacity and decides what the rating is and when it changes.
There is no transparency.  PG&E has the ability to use Path 15 to advantage
Diablo Canyon given the existing contracts.  Carl has looked into it
somewhat and doesn't think PG&E is, but;... The ISO says it can't interpret
PG&E's contracts with the munis and filed some funky thing with FERC about
how it's some kind of overseer -- we protested and have now appealed.  The
munis have been receiving preferential access since Day One -- their
contracts were generally subservient to the IOU rights -- more like
interruptible -- but once the ISO started, all of a sudden, the muni rights
became super firm superceding the IOU rights (as far as we can tell from
sketchy filings and discussions with ISO staff). That's why we have pushed
the issue.  Also, Dynegy and Power Exchange (not the PX) have rights on
Path 15.  Tim Belden would love to get some info on how that constaint is
being operated.

Information in general is pretty sketchy on real-time transmission.  We
have complained to the ISO about how the ISO knows what's going on in
transmission (as do the utilities), changes what it does, which then
changes prices, and then doesn't tell us until after the fact.  The ISO has
promised to do better, but I don't think has implemented any real changes
yet.

Advantageous access.

Except for what's going on in Path 15, I don't think the IOUs have any
advantages on access -- except with respect to Regulatory Must Run
resources like nuclear and hydro -- but I think it's resource specific,
rather than owner specific. The munis are another story.  See next item.

Munis Preference

This is a huge issue here and I assume across the country.  In making a
devil's bargain with the munis, the FERC has put the ISO into an untenable
situation.  The "sanctity of contracts" under any and all conditions has
created preference for incumbents (not the IOUs -- but everyone who had a
transmission contract with the IOUs) and poor rights for those poor
schlepps like us who have come into the new market.  The ISO cannot operate
the system this way and is forced to give the munis/Dynegy more than they
had originally and to let them do things no one else can do (e.g., some
munis get to change their schedule after the actrive hour begins, some get
to do it every half hour, so far most haven't had to pay for ancillary
services, etc.)

There are many, many examples of how we are discriminated against (in
addition to Path 15) and of how FERC has shined us on -- but yet we fight
on. The most recent muni giveaway is the litigation surrounding the "new"
transmission charge for CA -- into this has been entangled the rules for
munis joining the ISO.  The munis want huge handouts to join. And part of
the "new" T rate includes hundreds of millions of subsidies for munis --
I've pointed out that this amounts to the IOU's customers paying for the
munis' stranded transmission costs, when they are already paying for the
IOUs' stranded generation costs, but this argument fell on deaf ears in the
ISO.  It's really not our issue, but it does make you kind of sick about
where public policy stands in this state.

Subject:

When we have described the problems and solutions for California we have
focussed on generation siting and flexibility to hedge.  We have stayed
away from transmission issues on the assumption that California, with its
ISO and PX, does not suffer from the same discrimination issues as other
parts of the country.  Is this true?  Does California's system layer in
priorities for utility use of the system -- eg doesn't PG&E control "path
15"?  Does that control provide advantageous access to PG&E?  Are there
other examples and are there links between these "preferences" and the
current problems in California?  As we are trying to convert reliability
and pricing concerns into FERC action these would be helpful arguments to
have available to us.

CalPX To Ask FERC To Reduce Day-of, Day-Ahead Price Cap:
Board Caves In To Political Pressure

By Jason Leopold

LOS ANGELES--The California Power Exchange, the spot market where electricity 
is
bought and sold in the state, approved a measure Wednesday seeking federal
authority to impose a
$350 per megawatt-hour bid cap on wholesale power prices in its day-of and
day-ahead markets.

Members of the CalPX's board of governors admitted that the measure was 
approved
 as a result of
intense political pressure being placed on the board by state lawmakers and 
Gov.
 Gray Davis.

"Not approving this is political suicide," said CalPX board member Carolyn
Keherein, who also serves
on the board of governors at the California Independent System Operator. 
"We're
not changing
anything but the perception in the market."

The CalPX current cap on wholesale power prices in the day-of and day-ahead
market is set at $2,500,
but that is only a technical limitation of their computer system and has had 
no
effect on power prices.

State lawmakers believe a price cap would stabilize high power prices being
passed on to retail
customers, most notably consumers in San Diego. Ratepayers there are paying
market-based rates for
electricity and have seen their utility bills nearly triple in the past two
months.

The price cap would need to be approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission before it goes
into effect at the Power Exchange. FERC has not indicated whether it would OK
the measure, but said
it would investigate it.



If you have any questions, please feel free to call me directly.

Oil and Natural-Gas Shortages: Will They Create a Winter of Discontent?

U.S. retail energy fuel costs, already high by historical standards, are
expected to remain high this winter due to crude prices that are projected
to remain at levels unseen since the Gulf War, said the Department of Energ=
y
on Friday. In addition, households that use natural gas are likely to see
the largest year-on-year percentage increase in their bills as well, accord=
ing
to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). The agency said U.S. reside=
nts
can expect heating expenditures to increase by 25 percent for heating oil
and propane and 40 percent for natural gas.

ANALYSIS: Despite common belief to the contrary, there is a direct correlat=
ion
between the price cycles of oil and natural gas. The fact that there are
legitimate concerns surrounding the availability of both power sources
gives validity to the warnings of price increases this winter. When fuel
prices are low and natural-gas supplies are abundant, there is arguably
little connection between the two. However, the present situation as we
head into winter is the exact opposite=01*high oil prices and a comprised
supply of natural gas, leaving the two unquestionably intertwined. As energ=
y
users opt to switch from oil to natural gas, this affects natural gas suppl=
y
and raises gas prices.

How did we arrive at this alarming situation, which may have been justifiab=
ly
labeled an "energy crisis"? Regarding oil, in 1998 the worldwide oil indust=
ry

these increases promised by OPEC may not be enough to meet growing demand.
This is alarming as the United States is very reliant on foreign oil, which
already accounts for about half of U.S. oil use.

The high price of oil has sent many customers looking for natural gas,
only to find that it is also in questionable supply. Most reports suggest
that natural gas heats about 55 percent of all U.S. homes. The imbalance
between supply and demand found in the oil industry is also found in natura=
l
gas, resulting in a projected 20 to 40 percent increase in heating bills
this winter. Over the last month, prices for natural-gas futures have climb=
ed
to record levels of more than $5 per million Btus. Yet, unlike oil, most
of the blame placed on low supply for natural gas focuses on the United
States rather than other countries. A reported 60 percent of federal lands
have been placed off limits to natural-gas drillers, leaving as many as
200 million acres (out of a total of 1.5 billion) available but restricted
for natural-gas expansion. The Clinton administration and environmental
groups have been fiercely protective of federal reserve lands and prohibite=
d
drilling for natural gas (or oil) in states like Alaska, where some 36
trillion cubic feet of gas is known to be locked underground. At the same
time, EPA standards have become so pro-natural gas over the last decade
that few coal-fired plants have been built in the last 10-20 years, placing
an increasingly high dependence on natural gas, even though alternative
fuels are not necessarily available to serve as a substitute.

Given the connection between oil and natural gas, any successful attempt
to lower oil prices would in turn help to lower natural-gas prices. The
ability to rely more heavily on oil once again would decrease the need
for fuel switching, thus reducing the present burden on natural gas. Toward
this end, in late September President Clinton authorized the release of
30 million barrels of crude oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve
(SPR), the nation's emergency oil stockpile. The president's action caused
additional alarm in some groups who said that the need to tap into emergenc=
y
supplies so early in the season signaled real trouble with oil supplies.
Others said the 30 million barrels would do little to ease the problem,
and that it would take between 2 and 3 million barrels a day for one month
to reduce current crude oil prices.

So what is the solution? As noted, the issue has become politically polariz=
ed.
Within their campaign proposals, Gov. Bush proposes spending $7.1 billion
to open up U.S. energy resources and reduce dependence on foreign sources.
Specifically, Bush has proposed, among other things, opening 8 percent
of the Arctic National Wildlife Range, which probably contains about 10
billion barrels of oil. Vice President Gore opposes drilling in federal
land, and instead aims to protect the U.S. environment, increase reliance
on low-pollution fuels and focus on energy-efficiency / lower consumption
programs. Articulating the Democratic position on this issue, Senator Joe
Lieberman made the following comments last week in the vice presidential
debate: "There are more resources within the United States. If we can get
three miles more per gallon from our cars, we'll get a million=01*we'll sav=
e
a million barrels of oil a day, which is exactly what the refuge, at its
best, in Alaska, would produce=01(We've got to develop fuel cells, alternat=
ive
energy. We've got to encourage people to conserve..."

But what is the answer now, as winter fast approaches? Unfortunately, natur=
al
gas has no emergency fund like the SPR which it can tap into. The degree
to which the oil/gas supply issue will have a dramatic impact this winter
will depend on the weather. The colder the temperature, the greater the
need for heating power sources, which will drive up the cost for both oil
and natural gas. Meteorologists are predicting a tough winter, one that
in actuality may be near normal but will seem colder after the four past
winters, which were unusually mild due to La Ni=0Fa. Already, temperatures
are dipping to surprising lows across the country. Considering that it
is only early October, warnings are continuing to accumulate that supply
will be stretched to meet demand, which unquestionably will drive up the
price of energy bills.

Looking forward, much of what happens from here will depend on which candid=
ate
is elected in November. Most within the energy industry agree that more
production is the only answer to supply concerns. Yet, expanding production
will not be an easy task, especially in an election year. This is not an
issue that is gaining high priority within Congress, as politicians aim
to end their session before the presidential election. With such exceedingl=
y
opposed candidates, the impact that the imminent election will have on
future energy policy cannot be underestimated.

SCE, California ISO Propose Market Stabilization Plans; FERC to Meet This
Week
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
===============================================================

Southern California Edison (SCE) filed a four-point plan calling on the
California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to act by year's end to settle
the financial uncertainty threatening state consumers and utilities resulting
from California's dysfunctional electricity market. This follows a separate
measure filed by the California ISO with the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) that attempts to limit reliance on spot markets for energy
purchases. FERC is scheduled to meet on Nov. 1 to discuss the California
power market and remedies for the state's troubled move to deregulate retail
service, which caused drastic price spikes this summer.

ANALYSIS: This is the latest chapter in the ongoing saga surrounding 
California's
energy market. FERC's meeting on Wednesday of this week is being met with
a great deal of anticipation as many market participants hope that some
sort of regulatory decision will be made to repair the California market.

First, let's establish what SCE is proposing. SCE has petitioned the CPUC
to take four immediate steps: 1). Support market reform by providing utilities
with greater freedom to contract for longer-term supplies of power, completing
review of SCE's bilateral contract proposals, and rectifying market structure
problems that have become apparent; 2). Confirm that utilities will be
able to recover their reasonable procurement costs incurred on behalf of
customers; 3). Implement a post-rate-freeze rate stabilization plan instead
of the current approach that directs utilities to pass through volatile
wholesale power costs, and provide for a modest rate increase beginning
Jan. 1, 2001, to avoid larger future increases; and 4). End the uncertainty
about the disposition of remaining utility generation assets.

I think this can all be translated as follows. 1). SCE (and presumably
PG&E) want to overturn California's strong resistance against bilateral
contracts. Under California restructuring law, the local distribution company
must purchase power directly from the Power Exchange. Bilateral contracts
with generators are largely prohibited, meaning that currently in California
suppliers cannot establish direct contracts with utilities, as is allowed
in other states such as Texas. 2). SCE and PG&E are both in severe debt,
due to accumulated under-collection resulting from the disparity between
the high cost of wholesale power and rate freezes in their service 
territories.
SCE's debt is about $2.4 billion, while PG&E's debt could be as much as
$2.9 billion. Both utilities want to be able to charge customers for their
debt. 3). SCE and PG&E want to avoid the sky-high prices that San Diego
Gas & Electric had to charge its customers when they were exposed to 
market-based
prices this summer. SCE claims that its rate stabilization plan would increase
rates by less than 10 percent, keeping rates at 1996 levels when adjusted
for inflation. SCE will identify the term of this rate increase in a more
formal proposal to the CPUC, but believes that the less-than-10 percent
increase would be sufficient to recoup its $2.4 billion debt if it were
in place for four to five years. 4). AB1890 strongly encouraged that the
California IOUs divest their power plants, as part of the agreements for
stranded cost recovery. SCE sold 12 natural-gas plants, and presently has
two coal plants and its shares of one nuclear plant in Arizona in escrow.
The CPUC has dragged its heals on approving or disapproving the sale of
plants currently in escrow, and SCE is pushing the agency to finally decide
whether or not to allow pending sales to be completed.

The California ISO's proposal is more specific, but also geared toward
market stabilization. The Cal-ISO wants to implement a $100/MWh bid cap
(reduced from $250/MWh) on electricity purchases in the ISO's spot market.
However, the Cal-ISO's plan includes several exemptions, including those
generators that can prove they will lose money at the $100 rate, generators
that contract 70 percent of their supply to serve California customers,
and generators producing less than 50 MW (renewable power, imported power,
etc.) Thus, the current rate cap of $250/MWh would remain in place and
serve as the absolute rate cap for those suppliers who are exempt from
the $100 payment cap.

Further, the Cal-ISO wants to require that generators contract 70 percent
of their capacity in forward markets, and that users schedule at least
85 percent of their load in forward markets. The Cal-ISO contends that
California IOUs should be easily able to schedule 85 percent of their load
by entering into contracts with generators. The Cal-ISO wants to affix
a "real-time deficiency charge" on both generators and users that do not
use the forward markets. The Cal-ISO submitted its plan to FERC because
it want its proposals to be implemented not just in California, but on
a national basis.

Although the Cal-ISO is approaching the matter from a national perspective,
the lack of forward contracting has caused particular problems within its
own state. The lack of adequate forward contracting has placed a burden
on the Cal-ISO's Real-Time Market, which was designed to handle only 5
percent of the electricity traded in wholesale markets, but in fact is
handling about 20 to 30 percent. The Cal-ISO proposal seems to be taking
into account the problem of an out-of-sync wholesale/retail market by 
encouraging
generation to stay in the state.  Otherwise, capped generators may sell
power outside of California if the wholesale prices were to exceed $100
per megawatt hour in the neighboring states.  Should FERC approve this
national rate cap, however, it will be precedent setting and will signal
that the wholesale power market is not truly deregulated.

As noted, FERC plans to meet on Nov. 1 to examine the California market
in detail. FERC initiated a formal probe of the California market in late
August, with its investigation focused on the summer's price spikes, the
state's market structure including the Cal-ISO and the Power Exchange,
as well as market-based sellers in California. The meeting this week 
reportedly
will disclose findings from FERC's investigation and "consider proposed
remedies."

SCE's proposal has been submitted to the CPUC for review and is not on
FERC's agenda for approval. However, it is likely that whatever FERC decides
will have a direct impact on how the CPUC rules on SCE's plan. In particular,
FERC will be examining the issue of market power, and whether or not any
generators active in the California market intentionally gamed the system
by withholding generation to drive up energy prices. And the problem is
by no means limited to what occurred in San Diego this summer. Even though
the summer demand season has now ended, wholesale prices remain high, a
problem that is exacerbated by concerns surrounding supplies of natural
gas across the country.

CA  94105

Pacific Gas and Electric Company Welcomes FERC Report
San Francisco - Pacific Gas and Electric Company issued the following 
statement on the report issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
(FERC) today:
"Pacific Gas and Electric Company is pleased that FERC has used its authority 
to give California many of the tools we need to fix the wholesale electricity 
markets in this state. We agree with Chairman Hoecker and other FERC 
commissioners that this report is a sound beginning to the process of 
repairing the marketplace, but that more actions will need to be taken, at 
both the state and federal level, before the goal of a working, competitive 
energy market can be realized in California. 
"The new bid framework the Commission ordered represents a creative attempt 
to fix the market and moderate prices, while still allowing competition to 
evolve. Our hope is that this new framework will be successful in moderating 
electricity prices. 
"While the report does not find evidence of market power abuse in California 
this summer, FERC does provide for potential refunds, should abuse be 
discovered, effective as of the beginning of October 2000. 
"We are very pleased with the opportunity the Commission has given us to 
review and comment upon this report, and look forward to providing our 
comments on November 9, and throughout this proceeding."
The FERC action comes one day after Pacific Gas and Electric Company made an 
unprecedented $790 million payment to the Power Exchange for wholesale 
electricity costs for the single month of August 2000. 
"The wholesale electric market in California is clearly broken," said Gordon 
R. Smith, president and chief executive officer of Pacific Gas and Electric 
Company. "We cannot continue to borrow money to pay excessive wholesale power 
prices, which will hit our customers sooner or later. We welcome thoughtful 
intervention to repair the market."

   The current brouhaha surrounding San Diego <B>electricity</B> bills is
a
poignant reminder of just how politicized an issue can become under
the rubric of fostering the public good.  In this case, California's
seven-year <B>electric</B> industry <B>deregulation</B> effort, with
complete
support and crafting from the Democratic-controlled state
Legislature, is being made the whipping boy for the current price
spikes.



  The truth is anything but.  Nevertheless, facts have never stopped
elected officials, politically appointed regulators or consumer
advocates as they try to elbow one another out of the way to be seen
by consumers as their patron saint.

   In the debate over this summer's high power bills it is the very
folks who are screaming the loudest who have contributed the most to
the "crisis."  Among the culprits -- Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon,
the Legislature, Public Utilities Commission member Carl Wood, and
San Diego Gas&Electric Co. -- each has contributed to the bills
going through the roof.
   But having said that, it never has been, nor does it need to be, a
crisis for the state or for San Diego County.  California will
survive the current electrical bumps and grinds, but it may not
survive the political fallout.
   It is now clear that two Gov. Gray Davis appointees -- Wood and
CPUC President Loretta Lynch -- want to re-regulate the electric
industry as does Sen. Peace.  SDG&E unfortunately was dumb enough to
help establish the climate that has allowed them to demagogue the
issue and escalate its importance way out of proportion.
   Start with a recent assault by Wood to declare that a "radical"
deregulation policy driven by ideology rather than economic soundness
has created a "crisis."
   The cornerstone of the problem, as Wood sees it, is that there
haven't been any major power plants built in the state in more than a
decade. (It is also true that when California's electric
restructuring law was unanimously passed four years ago, there was an
over-supply of generation capacity within the state.) Wood wants to
turn that around by mandating utility-built power plants.
   Wood knows all too well that more than a dozen major generation
plants are under construction or in the state's lethargic approval
process right now.  If, magically, they could all be built by next
summer, California would be awash in electrons.  They can't, but
there is the prospect for getting ahead of the curve by the summer of
2003, if the state -- Gov. Davis, most specifically -- does something
to accelerate the current siting approval process.  Earlier this
month, the governor set in motion work to streamline the siting
process.
   Regulatory intervention (some call it re-regulation) is what Peace
has had on his mind at least since winter when, at an energy
discussion held in San Diego, he sounded the drumbeat for the
government to try to correct what he perceives as failings in the
market.  At the same time, he and his colleagues in the Legislature
for the past couple of years have stymied CPUC moves to step up the
deregulation process for both natural gas and electricity.
   Most notably, Peace engineered a bipartisan rider in this year's
budget bill that prevented the state's utilities from buying some of
their power supplies outside the state-created power exchange.  That
move, and SDG&E's passive financial management, helped eliminate one
means of lessening the current electric bill shock.
   There are further design flaws in California's restructured
electricity market -- initiated by Peace to buffer San Diego from
having the highest priced power in the state -- that have complicated
the newly developing market, and for which politicians take no
responsibility.
   Finally, there is SDG&E, which clings to its own self-proclaimed
fiction that it is only an "energy delivery service" and holds no
responsibility for what has happened to the 1.2 million households
and businesses using the juice it delivers.
   In fact, however, the utility company could have taken some steps
in the spring in terms of financial risk-management instruments
offered through the California power exchange that would have lowered
the price spike.  It also could have been more aggressive in
promoting conservation by customers.
   Subsequently, SDG&E has been tripping all over itself making
emergency filings to the CPUC, seeking authorizations it could have
aggressively pursued before the crisis.  The regulators granted
everything it asked for, finally, on Aug. 3.
   But SDG&E does have a generating role -- it still has a 20 percent
interest in the San Onofre nuclear plant and a corporate affiliate
operates a new power plant in Nevada.
   And, guess where that plant sold all of its power during the
recent crunch in California?  To Arizona -- that's where!

  PG&E Presses to End Freeze That Keeps
  Power Costs Low in Northern California 
  By Rebecca Smith 
    
  09/15/2000 
  The Wall Street Journal 
  Page A3 
  (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

  California's largest utility is pushing to end a four-year-old retail rate 
freeze that has
  insulated millions of Northern Californians from the volatile wholesale 
electricity prices that
  have rocked San Diego this summer.

  PG&E Corp., parent of Pacific Gas & Electric Co. in San Francisco, said it 
wants to end
  the freeze imposed in 1996 by the state legislature as soon as possible, 
because it is
  losing money under the arrangement. In a filing with the Securities and 
Exchange
  Commission, PG&E said it has collected $2.2 billion less from customers 
this summer
  than it has shelled out to buy bulk power for them from the 
state-sanctioned California
  Power Exchange, a central auction.

  PG&E's disclosure sets the stage for a major confrontation between the 
utility and
  regulators. It will be up to the California Public Utilities Commission to 
balance conflicting
  needs: the utility's desire to protect its shareholders from potentially 
huge losses, and the
  commission's own duty, as regulator, to protect the public from a flawed 
market that
  appears incapable of delivering the "just and reasonable" rates required by 
law. Legislators
  now say they fear the state could be tipped into a recession if electricity 
prices don't drop
  soon.

  Under the state's 1996 deregulation law, all California investor-owned 
utilities were allowed
  to freeze rates at what seemed like high levels. Utilities were permitted 
to use surplus
  revenues to pay down generation-related debts that regulators said would 
render them
  uncompetitive in a deregulated world. It worked well until this summer. 
PG&E charged
  customers, on average, $54 for each megawatt hour of electricity supplied 
even though it
  paid only $26 and $31 a megawatt hour, respectively, for that power in 1998 
and 1999. By
  June 30, it had collected enough surplus money to cancel $6.2 billion of 
debts.

  But the situation went haywire this summer as wholesale power prices 
lurched upward. The
  utility paid an average price of $163 a megawatt hour for electricity in 
June, $110 in July and
  $187 in August. Prices may be higher yet this month. The average price of 
power to be
  consumed today, for example, is $200 a megawatt hour, or nearly four times 
the amount
  that PG&E can bill its customers.

  Until recently, it was assumed that the utility would be able to recapture, 
in times of weaker
  demand, any shortfall that occurred in high-priced summer months. But that 
is looking less
  and less certain. Power prices projected for coming months look higher than 
the $54 a
  megawatt hour that PG&E now charges, particularly with natural-gas prices 
roughly triple
  the price of two to three years ago. The latter pushes up generating costs 
at natural
  gas-fired plants. Another problem is that there is less power available to 
be imported from
  outside California. In fact, the Pacific Northwest is expected to run short 
of power this
  winter, with less water available than in recent years for hydroelectric 
generation, putting
  pressure on California's market right when plants normally are taken out of 
service for
  maintenance.

  PG&E's chief financial officer now says he sees no reason to prolong the 
pain. He wants
  the freeze ended or he wants protection from high wholesale prices. "People 
did not
  envision the situation we have today," says Peter Darbee. Yesterday, 
Moody's Investors
  Service Inc. issued a negative outlook on PG&E, Edison International and 
their big utilities,
  citing the "increased supply risk" assumed by the utilities and "the 
unsettled state of
  electric deregulation in California."

  But state officials are loath to let consumers feel today's market 
volatility. Knowing that,
  PG&E may seek to strike a bargain in which it would continue some sort of 
rate freeze in
  exchange for permission to recoup some of the money it has lost. But there 
is no provision
  for that under current state law. The law simply says that when the 
utilities have paid down
  certain categories of costs, the freeze ends. If they haven't paid down 
these debts by March
  31, 2002, it ends anyway, and they have to swallow any loss.

  The wild card is what will happen with PG&E's 4,000-megawatt hydroelectric 
network, the
  biggest such system in North America. The utility has offered to shave $2.8 
billion from the
  tally of debts billed to ratepayers, if it is allowed to move its 
powerhouses and dams into
  the hands of an unregulated affilate. Such a move would end the rate freeze 
since the
  proceeds would be more than enough to offset the amount PG&E says it is 
otherwise
  entitled to collect from ratepayers, some $1.6 billion.

  But so long as power prices are volatile, nobody really wants the freeze to 
end but PG&E.

  In its SEC filing, the company said that it has no reason to believe, at 
the current time, that
  it will be able to recover lost monies and said it may be "required to 
write off the
  unrecoverable portion as a one-time charge against earnings" -- potentially 
amounting to
  billions of dollars. The same scenario exists for Edison International's 
Southern California
  Edison Co. unit, which serves most of the lower third of the state and has 
run a deficit of
  roughly $1 billion this summer.

  Observers say both utilities are wary of inciting consumer anger, should 
they be too
  aggressive in lobbying for an end to the freeze. A case in point: In 
hearings before federal
  energy regulators on Tuesday, Steve Baum, chairman of Sempra Energy, owner 
of San
  Diego 's utility, said the company's utility trucks are being defaced and 
workers are being
  intimidated by customers who are furious about power bills that have 
doubled and tripled
  since June. San Diego Gas & Electric Co. is the only utility, thus far, to 
end its rate freeze
  and pass wholesale power costs directly through to customers.

  State Sen. Debra Bowen, chairwoman of the California Senate utilities 
committee, said the
  legislature is reluctant to become involved. She said the legislature 
"feels like somebody
  who's fallen into poison oak enough times that all we have to do is walk 
past a bush and we
  break out in a rash. That's the way we react to these energy issues now."

  A Dwindling Faith In Deregulation 
  New Ways to Harness Electricity 
  By NEELA BANERJEE 
    
  09/15/2000 
  The New York Times 
  Page 1, Column 2 
  c. 2000 New York Times Company 

  Over a few sultry days in the summer of 1997, the state of Wisconsin got an 
early taste of
  the electricity shortages that now threaten several other regions of the 
country. An
  unusually large number of nuclear plants that supply the northern Midwest 
were closed for
  maintenance just as an unexpected heat wave drifted into the area. 
Wisconsin Electric,
  which serves Milwaukee, shut off electricity to 80 businesses; every few 
hours, it
  beseeched consumers to limit their energy use.

  Wisconsin Electric averted blackouts, but the scare profoundly changed the 
state's
  approach to deregulating the power industry, a process it had begun to 
explore only a year
  earlier. Like many other utilities, Wisconsin Electric initially pushed for 
what it and others
  called the Big Bang: state regulators giving up control over the production 
and pricing of
  electricity almost immediately.

  But after the 1997 power shortage, Wisconsin Electric, along with most 
local businesses
  and consumer advocacy groups, began to support a go-slow approach to 
deregulation, first
  building in an extra margin of reliable power before encouraging the state 
to remove its
  decades-old grip on the electricity industry.

  Lately, the rest of the country has been drawing the same conclusion. Just 
like Wisconsin,
  several other states have lost their early faith in the instantaneous, 
smooth creation of a
  free and fair electricity market. Deregulation has faltered as surging 
consumer demand
  outstrips the supply of electricity, and regulators and utilities scramble 
to cope with
  successive summers of price volatility and power failures.

  More than a year ago, the wholesale price of electricity charged by power 
plants in the
  Midwest surged to $6,000 a megawatt-hour, compared with average costs of 
$21 to $22 for
  the same amount of power. Con Ed customers in New York paid 43 percent more 
for
  electricity this June than last year. Prices have spiked elsewhere as well.

  And when rolling blackouts rippled through Silicon Valley and electricity 
bills doubled in
  San Diego over several weeks this summer, California's pioneering approach 
to
  deregulation came to embody what many see as the failings of the process.

  Despite the second thoughts about deregulation, few experts expect a return 
to the days of
  strict government control. A world in which various power generators 
compete openly to
  provide electricity at market prices still offers the prospect of both 
lower costs for business
  and consumers and higher profits for utilities than is possible under the 
traditional, more
  inefficient system in which monopoly suppliers are supervised by government 
regulators.

  ''California is an indication to the rest of us that we need to do our 
homework to make
  deregulation work,'' said Dick Olson, legal counsel with the Wisconsin 
Industrial Energy
  Group, an association of large companies. ''Some people want to stop the 
process, but the
  genie is out of the bottle.''

  But getting from here to there is proving far more difficult than expected. 
Lacking a clear
  federal approach, states are finding their own way and, in the process, 
casting doubt on
  some early promises.

  ''Deregulation was definitely oversold to consumers by many people,'' said 
Severin
  Borenstein, director of the Energy Institute at the University of 
California at Berkeley. ''To
  economists and a few others, deregulation was a calculated experiment, and 
we knew it
  would have its costs.''

  Historically, a regional electric utility, which was owned by investors and 
regulated by the
  state, generated power, transmitted it over high-voltage lines and then 
distributed it in
  low-voltage form into homes and businesses. In broad terms, deregulation 
calls for
  separating generation, transmission and distribution into distinct 
businesses.

  Deregulation advocates argued that if power plants were sold to private 
owners, they would
  compete among themselves to sell power to transmission and distribution 
companies at
  cheaper prices, driving down the cost of electricity. But that outcome was 
predicated on the
  realities of the mid-1990's, when power plants had spare capacity.

  But with few power plants coming on line recently, particularly in 
California and the
  Northeast, deregulation was introduced in the late 1990's at the worst 
possible time. In the
  thriving economy, businesses demanded more electricity, and people built 
bigger homes
  and bought more gadgets, sharply narrowing the gap between available 
supplies of
  electricity and peak demand. Fuel for generation has also become more 
expensive,
  especially natural gas, whose price has doubled even as it has grown 
increasingly popular
  because it is cleaner than other fuels.

  ''I think that the expectation that deregulation will always give you lower 
prices is
  unrealistic,'' said John B. Ramil, president of the Tampa Electric Company, 
a unit of TECO
  Energy Inc. ''Consumers think that competition will lead to lower prices 
automatically, when
  actually they will be paying market prices for power.''

  Advocates rallied support for electricity deregulation by asserting that it 
would deliver the
  choice and the low prices that deregulation of telecommunications has 
brought. But they
  forgot that the restructuring of the telephone industry, like power 
deregulation now, angered
  consumers early on, when local calling rates rose and the proliferation of 
choices baffled
  many people. Lawmakers and regulators took years to iron out the process, 
which is still
  going on. And because electricity is even more vital than telephones, there 
is far less
  tolerance for interruptions in service and volatile prices.

  ''You can't assume that you can deregulate in one year and sit back and 
watch how things
  work,'' said Barry Abramson, senior utility analyst with PaineWebber. 
''Regulators and utility
  officials have to come back frequently and correct problems they never 
expected until the
  system gets it right.''

  Seeing an Example In Pennsylvania

  So far, 24 states have tried some form of deregulation, but regulators and 
utilities in other
  regions say changes in their local electricity industry are inevitable, too.

  Among states where deregulation has occurred, Pennsylvania has emerged so 
far as the
  place where the promises of competition and lower prices are being met most 
successfully.
  The state began to draw up a deregulation blueprint in 1996, around the 
same time
  California did, driven by electric rates in Philadelphia and other major 
cities double the
  average in the United States.

  But Pennsylvania opted for a plan that calls for substantial government 
involvement in the
  market at every step. The state protected the utilities against losses from 
their older plants;
  in return utilities had to agree to freeze rates until 2006 at 1997 levels 
to protect
  consumers.

  The state aggressively advertised a choice of new electricity providers. 
More important, it
  set the benchmark generation rates for traditional utilities at a fairly 
high level, which made
  some outside competitors' prices look favorable in comparison and which 
spurred
  consumers to choose new power providers.

  As a result, more than 528,000 residential and business users, about 10 
percent of the
  total, have switched to other providers that sell them power at a fixed 
price over long
  periods. A recent study by the State of Pennsylvania estimated that 
consumers have saved
  about $2.84 billion in energy costs over the last three years.

  As consumers sought new power providers, those same companies began to 
build new
  plants in and near Pennsylvania, shoring up electricity reliability in the 
area. About 19,000
  megawatts of power, adding 50 percent more capacity, are expected to come 
on line in
  Pennsylvania in the next five years.

  Pennsylvania also cobbled together the independent system operator PJM from 
a network
  of neighboring states that could transmit power easily to one another, 
creating a grid third in
  size behind the entire transmission systems of France and of Japan.

  Trying Rate Caps In California

  Yet the lurching progress of deregulation in the country as a whole and the 
loss of old
  certainties like reliable power at steady prices have ignited a popular 
backlash in many
  areas, most vividly in California. There, the state has decided to cap 
rates in San Diego at
  1999 levels for the next two years. Other Californians have urged a 
rollback of deregulation,
  demanding that power plants sold to private owners be placed under 
government control
  again.

  The widespread short supply of electricity and the peculiarities of the 
commodity itself have
  given generation companies enormous leverage in the marketplace. Unlike 
most other
  goods, electricity cannot be stored to be used when there is a shortage. 
Nor is it something
  consumers can do without, which means the companies that supply people with 
electricity
  will pay just about any price to keep the lights on.

  Most analysts say that the exercise of such influence is not illegal --nor 
unexpected --
  since companies can be expected to try to maximize their profits. But 
California's complex
  power buying mechanism has created a situation in which relatively small 
players have
  extraordinary influence.

  On June 14, for example, the temperature in San Francisco hit 103 degrees 
and heat
  records were broken all over the Bay Area. The state's Independent System 
Operator,
  which coordinates transmission of electricity, predicted that during peak 
use on that
  weekday afternoon, California would need 43,000 megawatts. But reports from 
the power
  plants working that day showed only 36,000 megawatts available. As a 
result, the California
  I.S.O. paid $1,500 a megawatt to various plants that were not running; some 
of those plants
  had bet on a shortage and delayed generation until the price of power 
reached the cap.

  ''The world knows we'll make up that energy shortfall somewhere,'' said 
Spence Gerber,
  director of settlements at the I.S.O. ''People go in and make their bids 
knowing we're not
  going to shut the lights off. We have no choice.''

  In California, rate freezes have prevented most utilities from passing on 
much of the higher
  price of power to consumers. In San Diego , however, the rate freezes were 
lifted just as
  the city strained under a heat wave. That led to the doubling of customers' 
bills in the span
  of a month.

  One part of any long-term solution, experts say, is to increase the supply 
of electricity,
  through building new power plants and transmission lines. But few 
communities want power
  plants or transmission towers on their turf, adding to delays.

  So far, states have relied on caps on the wholesale price of power to keep 
costs down. In
  California, the price cap, until recently, was $750 a megawatt, and in 
Pennsylvania, it is
  $1,000. But California officials concede that power plants sometimes get 
$1,500 a
  megawatt-hour -- $750 for being on standby and $750 for the power itself.

  Caps, if set too low, may dissuade companies from producing electricity and 
from building
  new power plants. ''If you fix caps at $250, you have to realize that if in 
a neighboring state
  someone is offering $251 for power, you will have a serious shortage,'' 
said Richard Priory,
  chairman of Duke Energy, a nationwide power generation and trading company.

  Given the complexities, deregulation, with its connotation of a 
laissez-faire management of
  an industry, seems a misnomer. The focus is now on reorganizing the 
electricity industry,
  rather than cutting it loose, and of using sophisticated forms of 
regulation to foster
  competition and efficiency.

  ''What we're looking at is re-regulation, regulation in a different manner 
than we had before,''
  said Douglas Hale, senior economist with the Energy Information 
Administration in
  Washington. ''Electricity is not one of those commodities that you can walk 
away from and
  let take care of itself. You need a central authority to make sure it 
doesn't all come
  crashing down.''

  In Wisconsin, rather than having the legislature adopt an overall plan, the 
central state
  authority has moved to revamp the transmission sector before tackling 
generation, the
  reverse of what most other states have done. The Midwest price spikes in 
1998 revealed
  that while neighboring states were willing to provide power, there were not 
enough
  transmission lines in Wisconsin to bring it in. As a result, the Wisconsin 
government has
  compelled the state's four major utilities to surrender operation of their 
transmission lines to
  the Midwest Independent System Operator, which covers several states, to 
make sure all
  companies have equal access to power lines.

  ''The problem with the big bang in an industry like ours is that you take a 
large risk,'' said
  Larry Salustro, senior vice president of Wisconsin Electric. ''Maybe in 
three years, the
  market will be better. But in those three years, people will go through 
difficult personal and
  financial times.''

  The transmission company will be responsible for building new lines to 
improve the
  importing of power, and though they own shares in the concern, no single 
utility controls it.
  Wisconsin plans to double transmission capacity in the next four or five 
years, by which
  time the state would be ready to deregulate generation.

  ''You won't have low prices unless you create an effective market 
structure,'' said Lee
  Cullen, counsel for Customers First, a Wisconsin consumer advocacy group. 
''Everybody
  can support competition as a superior system, but we're not rushing 
headlong into it.''

  Building safeguards against the volatility deregulation brings will clearly 
take years, as more
  generation -- mostly in small natural-gas-fired power plants -- starts up, 
as more power lines
  are built to move electricity to where it is needed most and as business 
and consumers
  respond to higher prices by finding ways to conserve power and limit use 
during peak
  periods.

  Some businesses and the occasional residential customer have set up links 
with their
  utilities to respond to electricity prices in real time, by turning down 
lights or allowing air-
  conditioning to shut down briefly when a computer message informs them of 
price spikes.
  So far, however, such operations are rare.

  ''Until consumers can see and respond to real-time prices, price caps will 
remain a
  necessary evil,'' Mr. Borenstein said. ''The dirty secret of restructuring 
is that it is replacing
  old forms of regulation with new ones.''

  * Re "Davis Walks a Political Tightrope on Energy Prices," Sept. 12: The 
deregulation of the California utilities
  didn't include a change in the strangling bidding rules to which these 
utilities, unfortunately, are bound. They are
  required to buy their power through a state-sponsored day-ahead market, 
rather than being allowed to bid on
  longer-range contracts on the free market, which would permit them to lock 
in lower pricing.

  The California Legislature wanted to retain controls on pricing, thinking 
it would result in the lowest costs. Well,
  the legislators were wrong! The real damage is that the public now believes 
energy price increases were due to
  deregulation, but in fact the utilities still aren't deregulated enough to 
permit freedom of bidding. Take the reins off
  the bidding prices, and prices will come down.

  Why do the state taxpayers have to pay to keep San Diego residents' 
electric bills down to $68 a month? Either
  the power providers are ripping the people off, or they have had really 
cheap electricity because San Diego Gas &
  Electric didn't invest enough in increasing power-generating capacity.

  They could shut off the air conditioning and probably keep their bill that 
low. My parents never had any air
  conditioning, and they lived where it got over 100 degrees every year. In a 
lot of cases we would be better off
  without it, just not as comfortable. There is no constitutional right or 
guarantee that we have to have air
  conditioning or cheap electricity. It sounds like a good time to start 
conserving.

Seems that we could provide Lay/Skilling with the power point slides as prep 
for any calls.  As a starter, it would be useful to provide McNeally with a 
letter that he could send to federal and state decision makers.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff --

Let's see if we can get material to Lay or Skilling to call McNeally this 
week (Oct 9) so that we ask if they'll talk with Rebecca by Oct 15.  What 
exactly do we need to give to Lay or Skilling before the call?  What will 
Enron send to McNeally if he agrees?  Do we have all of this?

Agree completely.  Notion I had was that we give Rebecca the slides, tell her 
the story on background, then she trots off to interview McNeally, Ellison, 
etc.  Just a thought.  Might be easier, faster channel that achieves the 
quick action/message we're looking for.

I don't disagree with Jeff that the WSJ would be a great message point.  I 
would recommend, however, that one of Enron's allies interview for the 
story.  For Enron to speak for the hi-tech industry is a bit questionable.  
Better if we can approach Intel or Sun now and ask them to talk with R. Smith.

FYI.  Rebecca got back in touch wanting to talk about the history of dereg in 
California.  Been trading messages.  When she gets back to me with what she 
wants to discuss, I'll check back in before having the conversation.  
Question:  What about giving her a copy of our high tech slides with the 
intent of getting her to do a story on it?  She might be a good "carrier."  
Thoughts?  One story has already hit the SJ Mercury News.

Best,
Jeff

Calif Officials Examine Cal-ISO, CalPX Merger 
  
09/21/2000 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones&Company, Inc.) 
LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- California officials are examining the possibility 
of a merger between the state's Independent System Operator and the 
California Power Exchange. 
The state auditor's office met Monday with the ISO to look into the ISO's 
operations and its relationship with the CalPX, according to documents 
obtained by Dow Jones Newswires. 
The audit was requested by state senator Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, who 
believes a merger between the ISO and the CalPX would make California's 
electricity market more competitive, said Jan Smutny-Jones, chairman of the 
ISO Board of Governors. 
The ISO controls 75% of the state's electricity grid and real-time 
electricity market. The CalPX is the spot market where electricity is bought 
and sold in the state. 
Monday's meeting, which lasted approximately 1 1/2 hours, was largely 
introductory, said ISO legal counsel Charles Robinson. 
"There were five or six people from the auditor's office, and they talked 
briefly about the scope of the audit and the time frame. We provided 
information on how the markets work and the ISO's organizational structure," 
Robinson said. 
The auditor's office will meet with the ISO Monday for 4-5 hours for a 
"training session on ISO 101," Robinson said. Once the office has a sense of 
the ISO's activities, he said, a more intensive document and on-site review 
will take place. 
The audit is expected to be finished by spring, said state auditor Mary 
Noble. 
Senator Peace requested the audit in mid-August due to concern over high 
wholesale electricity costs and the doubling of electricity rates paid by San 
Diego customers. 
San Diegans are the first to pay market-based electricity rates under the 
state's 1998 deregulation law. A recent report by the Electricity Oversight 
Board and the California Public Utilities Commission showed that wholesale 
electricity prices in the state have increased 270% over the same period in 
1999. 
In his audit request, Peace said he also wanted to examine how effective the 
ISO and CalPX were at detecting and correcting market problems. 
Peace, who is running for California Secretary of State, is the architect of 
the state's deregulation law and has sponsored several bills to refine that 
law.

	High-tech demands strain power grid
	BY MATT MARSHALL
Mercury News 
	During a summer of rolling blackouts and rising power rates, one silent 
culprit is adding unexpectedly to the shortages: the new, spreading e-world 
of networked computers. 
	E, after all, means e-lectricity, as well as electronic. 
	Over the past three years alone, U.S. corporations have spent $1 trillion 
installing a vast world of wiring used now for everything from e-mail to 
e-business, and it all depends on -- surprise, surprise -- a constant, 
reliable flow of electricity. 
	``Every single piece of it gets plugged into a wall somewhere,'' said Mark 
Mills, an energy consultant and co-author of the Digital Power Report. 
	Experts differ on how much the needs of high-tech equipment, as well as the 
economic expansion that it has spurred, have boosted the demand for 
electricity. But according to the Edison Electric Institute in Washington, 
D.C., they've added about one percentage point per year to the growing demand 
for power nationally since 1990. 
	In California, the high-tech revolution has consumed even more electricity -- 
an extra two to four percentage points each year of power over the amount 
originally predicted, the institute says. In 1988, the California Energy 
Commission believed the state would need 54,000 megawatts of power by 2000, 
partly to accommodate robust economic growth. But this year California 
actually required 56,000 megawatts. 
	That difference is enough to power about 2 million homes. ``There's no 
getting around it,'' Mills said. ``Cyberspace, far from virtual, is very real 
and anchored in electrons.'' 
	Depending on whom you believe, high technology consumes from 3 percent to 20 
percent of the nation's total power generation, and some expect that number 
to rise to as high as 40 percent by 2010. ``Whether that number is 5, 10, 30 
or 40 percent, is open to question,'' says Jim Owen, spokesman of the Edison 
Electric Institute. 
	The added demand from the e-world couldn't come at a worse time. California 
is now caught in a serious electricity shortfall for various reasons: an 
unexpectedly hot summer, aging power plants that are prone to break down, 
years of poor investment in new plants and the new efforts at deregulation in 
the state. 
	Imbalance since 1995 
	For the past five years, the supply of electricity statewide has grown much 
more slowly than the demand for it from companies and residents. Supply and 
demand were in balance until about 1995. Since then, supply has grown only 1 
percent, while demand has expanded by 11.5 percent, according to the 
California Energy Commission. 
	For the Bay Area, state officials say there exists a shortfall of around 900 
megawatts, or enough electricity to power about 900,000 homes. ``You guys in 
California are the biggest energy hogs around,'' says Michael Economides, 
professor of chemical engineering, who has studied power consumption. ``Take 
a house with three teenagers. You have six phone lines, recharged cellulars, 
car phones and computers.'' 
	San Jose, for example, sucks up about 2,535 megawatts from outside the city 
and produces only 165 for itself, according to Stephanie McCorkle, 
spokeswoman at the state's Independent System Operator, which controls the 
purchasing of much of California's power. To make up the difference, the city 
needs to draw on outside sources that are limited themselves, since they come 
from other areas that are also growing quickly. 
	Blackout warnings 
	With the state running beyond capacity, local power officials are warning of 
blackouts in the summer. 
	When a rolling blackout hit Silicon Valley on June 14, several companies were 
alarmed. They stepped up talks within a task force of the Silicon Valley 
Manufacturing Group about ways to conserve energy use and to minimize the 
burden on the local power grid. 
	Sun Microsystems Inc. has estimated that a blackout costs up to $1 million 
per minute, according to Larry Owens, division manager of customer services 
for Silicon Valley Power, the utility that manages power for many large 
companies in Santa Clara County. 
	Chuck Mulloy, spokesman for Intel Corp., said that if one of its fabrication 
plants shuts down, ``it could cost millions, depending on the 
circumstances.'' 
	Nevertheless, many computer companies are reluctant to talk about their power 
needs, saying that it will alert competitors about their cost structures. 
	Some say they're confident the Bay Area shortfall can be patched up over the 
next couple of years through a variety of measures, including building local 
power plants and transmission stations. Local generation is important, 
experts say, because it prevents voltage instability, which can seriously 
harm high-tech computer servers that require high reliability. 
	For some of their most precise equipment, Internet economy companies need 
what's called ``five 9s'' -- or 99.999 percent reliability -- to ``nine 9s'' 
or 99.9999999 percent reliability. 
	This, in turn, requires backup hardware, backup generators, backup batteries, 
switches and software, said Mills, the energy consultant. The need for local 
power is one of the issues in the debate surrounding the proposed Calpine 
plant for Coyote Valley, which, if approved, would go online by 2003. 
	Cisco Systems Inc., which is proposing to build a campus in the area, has 
opposed the plant for health and safety reasons. Cisco's officials say that a 
patchwork of other plans already in place -- including building two power 
plants in Pittsburg, and others in San Francisco, Contra Costa and San Mateo 
counties -- will eventually generate enough electricity to avoid building 
another plant. 
	In high demand 
	Meanwhile, many of the new e-businesses have a voracious appetite for 
electricity. Exodus Communications Inc., Intel and Inktomi Corp., for 
example, have erected massive Web-hosting and data centers that use about 10 
times the amount of electricity per square foot of a typical commercial 
building. 
	For example, a 100,000-square-foot Web-hosting center built by Exodus 
consumes enough electricity to power 100,000 homes, estimated Ed Quiroz, 
regulatory analyst at the Public Utilities Commission in San Francisco. 
	``They've completely caught projections off guard,'' he says. ``It's a huge 
growth industry. The limiting factor is going to be the reliability of 
electricity.'' 
	And there's no sign that the demand for power in Silicon Valley will slow any 
time soon. 
	Mills said the amount of electricity consumed by watching a movie by 
video-streaming over the Internet is 20 times more than that used to watch 
the same movie on television. 
	Mobile phones, he said, use about three times the amount of electricity that 
normal phone lines do because they operate by bouncing signals off of base 
stations. All of these will be on the rise, he pointed out, especially in 
Silicon Valley. 
	``The buildup of the Internet has just begun,'' he says. ``And in the valley, 
there's a shadow of electricity growing behind it.''

Title: Weathering the Summer Price Volatility and Highs--How Will Retail 
Marketers Fare?

**********************************************************************

This summer retail marketers have been confronted with extraordinarily 
difficult market circumstances for both gas and power. So far this summer, 
average weekly power prices have risen above $100 per megawatt-hour (MWh) in 
several markets--almost double many of the standard offer levels. This 
differential between market prices and standard offers has made it almost 
impossible for retail marketers to offer customers an attractive service 
proposition in many areas of the United States open to competition. 
Similarly, in the gas market this summer (May through June) prices at the 
Henry Hub have averaged $3.92 per million British thermal units (MMBtu), well 
above the average of $2.62 per MMBtu during the same period last year. In 
some cases, the volatile gas and power markets this summer are proving lethal 
to retail marketers that chose to ride the spot markets rather than properly 
hedge their purchases and who lack the balance sheet strength to carry the 
burden. In addition, som!
e retail marketers have experienced difficulty with contract fulfillment by 
their wholesale suppliers, even when the retailer may have felt secure going 
into the summer. As a result of these market conditions, a few marketers have 
even relinquished their customers, returning them to the utilities who are 
the default suppliers.

Retail marketers serving these difficult markets (which include the West, 
PJM, and New England) are approaching the current situation with a number of 
different strategies, including

*  selling either part or all of their customer base

*  continuing to serve their existing customers but not renewing their 
contracts and planning to exit the market

*  turning customers back on utility service

*  continuing full steam ahead

The irony of this situation is that high prices over the next few years may 
actually help increase consumer awareness about competitive energy supplies 
and may even cause utilities under unrecoverable price cap rates to question 
whether they should remain in the merchant business. Uncertainties whether 
retail marketers can withstand these conditions and regulators and other 
interested parties will tolerate a sustained period of both high and volatile 
prices or if instead they will step in and adjust the rules in the name of 
protecting retail customers.

In this briefing CERA examines the question of whether one possible fallout 
from this summer's high and volatile energy prices will be increased 
consolidation among retail marketers, as retail customers (and/or businesses) 
begin to be actively bought and sold. We also examine the implications on 
retail markets of recent federal legislation supporting the legality of 
electronic contracts. In addition, we focus our first regional analysis on 
the regulatory developments and retail activity in the Northeast states and 
Canadian provinces--one of the most dynamic regions in terms of retail energy 
activity.

Retail Metrics

Trading Retail Customer Bases: Avenue for Building Market Share

Although the impact of volatile and high energy prices this summer may be 
bleak for many retail players, for a new entrant and/or contrarian buyer, 
this could be an excellent time to pick up customers "on the cheap" and build 
market share. In the past month there have been three notable cases of retail 
energy companies buying retail customer bases from other companies--in some 
cases just the retail customers have been purchased and in other cases whole 
retail energy businesses have been purchased. Examples include

*  North American market entry strategy. Centrica, an energy marketing 
business in the United Kingdom, purchased Direct Energy, an energy marketing 
business in Canada that also has a joint venture with Sempra called Energy 
America. Through its acquisition of Direct Energy, Centrica acquired 820,000 
Canadian gas customers and 27.5 percent ownership interest in Energy America, 
a US company that has 450,000 gas and power customers (see Table 1). In 
addition to gaining access to the largest retail customer base in North 
America, Centrica was able to buy a company with significant experience in 
various North American retail markets.

*  Gaining critical mass for an IPO. The New Power Company (a joint venture 
between Enron, IBM, and AOL) recently acquired over 300,000 gas and power 
customers from Columbia Energy Services as a way to quickly build market 
share before an initial public offering, for which a request has recently 
been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

*  Building market share. Energy America acquired 50,000 gas customers from 
Titan Energy, an energy marketer in Georgia, after the latter filed for 
bankruptcy.

In the two cases of bankruptcy, mass-market gas customers were purchased in 
the range of $44-$112 per customer. It appears that purchasing a base of 
retail customers is a cheaper form of buying market share than purchasing an 
entire company or division. For example, Centrica paid between $480 and $645 
per customer in its purchase of Direct Energy's business. This metric is 
somewhat misleading, however, as the purchase of Direct Energy also included 
upstream gas assets.

The three recent transactions join the list of retail customer acquisitions 
over the past year or two (see Table 1). These transactions are generally 
occurring for three common reasons: either as a result of a retail marketer 
bankruptcy (e.g., Titan Energy and Peachtree Gas), because companies are 
changing their strategic focus (e.g., NiSource/Columbia Energy and PG&E), or 
as a market entry tool (e.g., AES, Centrica, New Power). CERA expects many 
more players to consolidate and exit the business this year, particularly in 
the aftermath of the summer market.

The idea that the current climate might offer a good buying opportunity for 
retail customers has not been lost on the market. While existing retail 
markets are struggling to make ends meet, the number of marketers requesting 
certification has increased in some places such as Massachusetts, where it is 
expected these new entrants will attempt to purchase other marketers' 
businesses.

Table 1 shows extreme differences in prices paid for retail customer bases 
(on a total-cost-per-customer basis), since a wide variety of factors 
contribute to the cost of a customer and/or a retail business. CERA does not 
suggest that this table provides an apples-to-apples comparison on the cost 
of a customer. In terms of just pure customer acquisition costs there can be 
significant regional differences in the value of a customer owing to average 
use per customer and local market conditions. For example, a residential gas 
customer in Georgia will likely use far less gas than one in Michigan and 
should be valued differently as a result. Other factors such as buying 
habits, load size, existing contracts, and future potential growth in the 
market need to be evaluated to determine the proper valuation of customers. 
In addition, a myriad of factors can affect the value of a retail company, 
including what other capabilities, assets, and other factors are part of the 
deal, separat!
e from the customer base and underlying contracts.

Retail Market Share Consolidation Could Be the Trend over the Next Year

Although the buying and selling of retail customers through aggregators was a 
common feature of Ontario gas restructuring, this tactic has not been as 
prevalent in the United States for two reasons. Marketers have been 
distrustful of the methods of acquisition of other players and are therefore 
skeptical about the loyalty of customers if they were to be acquired through 
a purchase. Additionally, many have felt that they could acquire customers at 
a much lower cost than by purchasing an existing customer base.

This historical reluctance to buy retail customer bases seems to be changing, 
and will likely continue to change in the future. Over the past few years 
there has already been a maturation of many of these marketers and of the 
rules that they must obey. In addition, as larger name companies enter the 
retail markets, the risk associated with buying a customer base that had been 
acquired through questionable means has been drastically reduced.

With the emergence of significant players such as Enron, Centrica, and Shell 
into the retail market,  further customer buyouts will occur as these and 
other large players work to gain enough scale to make the retail business 
significant to their bottom line. The new breed of retail marketers may be 
better capitalized to play the short-run game of building market share as 
well as the long-run game. As a result, these players may be able to achieve 
scale in a market where no single company has achieved significant scale to 
date. In addition, many of these companies have strong wholesale marketing 
capabilities to support their retail marketing capabilities, inform their 
contracting practices, and help shield them from being on the wrong side of 
volatile markets.

Market Developments

New Law Removes the Wet Signature Barrier, but Lack of Uniform Rules Persists

The regulatory requirement for retail energy marketers to obtain written 
("wet") signatures from end users wanting to switch their energy service 
provider has posed a major cost barrier to marketers that already face high 
customer acquisition costs. As a result, a number of competitive energy 
marketers have exited markets with wet signature requirements. This cost 
barrier will be lowered in October when recently passed federal legislation 
takes effect--sparking renewed interest in the affected markets as well as 
guaranteeing that in the states scheduled to open, electronic customer 
sign-ups and transactions will be legally binding.

In late June, President Bill Clinton signed into law the Electronic 
Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, which will take effect 
October 1, 2000. This law overrides state regulatory rulings and laws that 
have required wet signatures. However, although the news is a step forward 
for marketers, the issue is not entirely cut and dried.

*  The Act confirms the legality of electronic transactions, while giving the 
states broad authority on how to implement and judge requirements for these 
transactions.

*  It stipulates that parties engaged in transactions must both agree to 
conduct commerce electronically. This act neither mandates electronic 
commerce nor allows it to be mandated if not agreed to.

*  The Act follows on an earlier act titled the Uniform Electronic 
Transactions Act (UETA), which was proposed last year by the National 
Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws. For the states that 
adopted this earlier Act, the latest Congressional legislation allows them to 
adhere to the UETA. States that have not implemented the UETA will be under 
the jurisdiction of the new federal legislation, which is slightly more open 
to interpretation than the UETA.

What does this legislation mean at the state level? Unfortunately, this Act 
did not come in time to have a significant impact on the states that have 
troubled marketers (e.g., Arizona and New Jersey). Prior to the passing of 
this new legislation, Arizona adopted its own version of the UETA in April. 
Almost concurrent with the federal legislation, New Jersey recently approved 
an Internet pilot program to allow marketers to use electronic signatures to 
switch customers beginning in September. The program will be open to 350,000 
customers (10 percent of the market) and will last for six months before 
reevaluation by the Board of Public Utilities (BPU). However, in lieu of the 
federal legislation, the BPU will vote in August on lifting the program cap. 
It remains to be seen if either the pilot or new rules will be sufficient to 
lure back the marketers (e.g., KeySpan, DTE, Conectiv) that pulled out of New 
Jersey over the past year, citing the state's wet signature rules as one of!
 the primary reasons for their exit. Given the high use and ownship of 
personal computers in the residential market, as well as customer interest in 
being able to shop for suppliers over the Internet (about one third of 
customers surveyed in New Jersey supported Internet sign-up), we expect this 
recent ruling could jump-start marketing to the mass market this fall.

This legislation will have the most significant impact in states that have 
not opened to competition or ruled on wet signatures. Although benefiting all 
marketers by increasing their options, this Act benefits pure e-commerce 
players the most. The cost of acquiring customers over the Internet can be 
substantially less than other forms of customer acquisition such as mail 
(whose costs include paper and postage) or door-to-door sales (which involves 
high labor costs). Since many consumers will continue to remain without 
Internet service for the midterm, another implication of the ruling is that 
it will drive further customer segmentation by different types of marketers.

The implementation of the electronic signature law may signal the advent of 
the Internet as a favored marketing tool over the more traditional means of 
marketing to customer through paid advertising, direct mail, or door-to-door 
sales. Since the Act does not require states to accept oral communication as 
legally binding, many states will continue to require written or electronic 
signatures. "Slamming" and "cramming" remain the concern of many state 
regulators, resulting in rules that disallow oral transactions as a means of 
signing customers.

The cost of acquiring customers over the Internet can be substantially less 
than other forms of customer acquisition such as mail (whose costs include 
paper and postage) or door-to-door sales (which involve high labor costs). 
This will help divide the retail market into players serving different 
customer segments. One set will continue to acquire customers that do not 
have Internet access through traditional methods, whereas the other set of 
retail players will acquire and conduct business over the Internet, typically 
gaining higher income customers.

Though there can be little question that states will eventually have to allow 
marketers to transact and acquire customers over the Internet, the 
state-by-state rules governing electronic transactions are likely to continue 
to be nonstandard. Although the intent of the law as it is written is to 
nullify state wet signature legislation in all but a few cases, there could 
be some confusion over its interpretation at the state level. One area to 
watch will be how states interpret one of the law's few exceptions--that 
customers must be notified in a nonelectronic format when their utility 
service is being terminated. Some regulatory agencies may take that to mean 
that when consumers switch away from utility service, some form of 
communication must be sent to the consumer, and potentially a regulatory 
commission could require marketers to bear some or all of these costs.

Regional Analysis--Northeast Market

The attention being given to the high-priced summer market of 2000 is masking 
what could be seen as small steps forward for competition in the Northeast. 
Despite headlines about retail players exiting some markets and customers 
being returned to system supplies, state regulatory activity is proceeding 
apace this year, and there continues to be a steady influx of new players 
that are waiting for certification in states such as Massachusetts and New 
Jersey. Still, this has not been a banner year for retail activity in the 
Northeast (see Figure 1 and Table 2).

Regulatory Front

The region has more competitive retail power markets open than any other in 
the United States. Of the nine states in the Northeast, only New Hampshire 
and Vermont have not been opened to competition, although both states are 
moving forward to break the political impasse there. Maine and Connecticut 
have opened since January.

Although natural gas competition got off to an early start in the region, it 
now lags electric access, with only New York, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey 
technically open to gas competition to all customers. Over the next year, the 
only state that is expected to take any significant step forward on the gas 
front is Massachusetts, as the Department of Telecommunications and Energy 
(DTE) is likely to rule in favor of opening the market to all customers by 
the end of the year.

There has been a decrease in the number of customers in some utility 
jurisdictions that are competitively buying gas and power in the Northeast 
since March, particularly in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Since March the 
number of customers switched to retail marketers has dropped from 612,000 to 
547,000 for gas and increased somewhat for power from 680,000 customers to 
801,000. Although new competitors continue to petition for the right to serve 
in a number of northeastern states, in a few of the newly opened access 
states, retailers have been slow to step forward with competitive offers. 
This is particularly true for offers directed to residential and small 
commercial customers.

Wholesale Volatility

Market share of retail players in the Northeast has always remained highly 
fragmented, and utility affiliates retain the bulk of deregulated market 
share. This is poised to change over the next year, as some of the early 
retail marketers experiencing difficulty under the current market conditions 
pull back, leaving room for new entrants on the sidelines. In many of the 
states, wholesale prices this summer dramatically exceeded the level of 
competitive offers in the marketplace, exceeding $100 MWh in some cases in 
New England. A few retailers caught without a secure supply of wholesale 
power were forced to return their customers to the provider of last resort 
service. It will be important to watch these markets in the fall to see if 
customers return to these marketers and/or whether the regulators adjust the 
rules to prohibit this kind of behavior and/or fix the rules that perpetuate 
this discrepancy between the standard offer and market price.

Until the wave of new supply resources are built and brought online in these 
markets, high and volatile prices are likely to be a characteristic of this 
market. It remains to be seen if retailers will have learned the lessons from 
this past summer, however, and go into the next peak period with firm supply 
contracts as well as arm themselves with the marketing savvy to take 
advantage of customer aversion to high and fluctuating prices with offers of 
a stable price, while providing the marketer with a significant margin above 
the wholesale price.

The story is similar for gas, as CERA expects strong gas prices in the 
Northeast to continue for the new few years, until increased supply comes 
into the market. High prices will continue, owing to tight storage 
inventories and increased demand for gas for power generation, with last 
winter's volatility likely to be repeated in upcoming winters.

Canada

The largest Canadian market in the Northeast is Quebec, as Ontario will be 
covered as part of our Midwest regional analysis. The Quebec gas market is 
the only northeastern Canadian gas or power market fully open to competition. 
There is no investigation into power competition in Quebec at this time. It 
is likely that Quebec will wait and see how opening of the Ontario power 
market plays out next year before taking any action, just as it watched and 
repeated the Ontario gas market experience.

Greenfield gas distribution companies are being built in New Brunswick and 
Nova Scotia, which will be served by Sable Island gas supplies. The 
regulatory focus there is to encourage hooking customers up to gas system 
supplies, not necessarily to promote retail competition.

I understand how things get taken out of context and I don't want us to
overreact. However, there are ways to head this kind of comment off before
it is raised. We developed some MESSAGES for Jeff to use in his travels. We
should try to put those back in front of him now and then reinforce those
in our follow-ups with the press after his interviews. I believe Kathy gave
a copy of these to Mark Palmer and Peggy Mahoney as well as the results of
the focus group research we did on the topic.

It looks like there are about 12 articles in the San Diego Union concerning 
bidders in the San Diego market. Following are other articles and letter to 
the editor.



SDG&E is entertaining offers from major power companies for a fixed-price
contract to stabilize electricity prices. The utility has received at least
one proposal from Enron Corp. for a multiple-year contract at prices less
than half current levels -- but 50 percent above prices in the spring.



"It's like apples and oranges," said Thomas Williams, the Duke spokesman. 
He noted that Roseville had recently secured power at 4.9 cents from Enron
-- a Duke competitor -- but had signed a five-year contract.



Letters to the Editor

The real reason our electric rates are so high is because San Diego Gas &
Electric made a major goof by selling off all its power plants to other
utilities. That's why only San Diego County is suffering from deregulation.

The rest of the state is being served by other utilities that have plants. 
They can produce electricity for about 11 cents per kilowatt hour. They do
not need much of the California power pool electricity.

However, SDG&E's parent company, Sempra, has no local power generators and
is forced to take all of its electricity from the pool, which is being
exploited by large out-of-state utilities, such as Enron, which is charging
25 cents per kilowatt hour. The California power pool sells all power at
the same rates, but only Sempra is forced to buy large quantities.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.

I find it difficult to believe your readers are surprised by the recent
rise in electricity rates. Opponents to deregulation predicted the outcome
some years ago before AB 1847 was passed. Anyone with a simple education in
economics would foresee that with deregulation the utilities would direct
their marketing at the largest users who would lock in low rates by
contract. In the end, the individual homeowner would pay for any rate
increases.

Advising people to lock in a rate with Enron or a similar company will not
resolve the problem. Someone somewhere at the lower end of the food chain
will have to pay the deregulated power rate.

If one had even read AB 1847, one would have discovered that the initial 10
percent rate reduction was paid for by issuance of state bonds and guess
who will pay those off. As you may now realize, the power generation
industries in California and New York were not interested in any studies
based on reality, which were discarded.

The public's lack of diligence with pending legislation will be paid for by
the same public. The studies were available, but I guess that initial rate
reduction was more appealing.
ROBERT EMERY
El Centro
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
State Sen. Steve Peace is realizing that deregulating the power industry
from one monopoly (SDG&E) to another (Enron) isn't working. Well, duh! And
to compensate for his stupidity, we the consumers should make ourselves
heard through "economic disobedience."

The real statement and fresh resolve from Peace are his apology to all of
his constituents that relied on and voted for him, to reverse and fix this
ridiculous mistake.

I hope he had our best interests at heart when he bought into this idea. 
Who specifically lobbied him for this? Has anyone else noticed the
deafening silence by all our other elected state officials from San Diego? 
We have the highest gas prices, highest milk prices and now highest power
prices!

Does anybody in state government care about the people? Or is this the
Republican doctrine of less government in action?

  MANY Web sites scream about what they will sell you for next to nothing, or 
less. But how
  about a site that pays you not to buy?

  A strange notion, but one that has more solid economic underpinnings than 
many of those
  desperate give-it-away dot-coms. Then again, the commodity in question is 
not the typical
  stuff of e-commerce transactions, like a plane ticket from Cincinnati to 
Nashville next
  Thursday or a vintage Barbie doll or 20,000 widgets of a certain shape. 
This promising new
  business is using e-commerce for a commodity that absolutely everybody 
needs:
  electricity.

  As it turns out, one kilowatt may look like another, but its price may vary 
by a factor of
  more than 100 in a single day. At night a kilowatt-hour -- the amount of 
electricity needed to
  light 10 100-watt bulbs for an hour -- may sell for a penny or two, because 
most of the
  generating capacity is unused. But on a hot afternoon, in places where the 
market is
  deregulated, the same amount of power could cost $1 or $5, or even more.

  Traditionally, though, utilities charge most customers pretty much the same 
price for the
  kilowatt-hour no matter what they pay to buy it or if they generate it 
themselves. Even
  companies with time-of-day rates are charging a price that varies by only a 
few pennies
  from peak to off-peak.

  But as California approached a summer of tight electricity supplies this 
year, Pacific Gas
  and Electric started an e-commerce marketplace where customers could be 
paid not to
  buy. In theory, the system would work with any customer, but it is only 
practical with big
  consumers, mostly businesses, because otherwise the number of transactions 
becomes
  hard to manage.

  As the state danced on the edge of rotating blackouts, the company quickly 
applied to
  regulators for permission to expand its program, called E-Bid. The system 
works like this:
  every afternoon, the utility gets an estimate of what power will cost on 
the wholesale market
  the next day. When the price is high, the utility notifies big customers 
that have signed up
  for its program, alerting them to log on to a secure Web site.

  There, according to Ronald K. Lowe, a company spokesman, the estimated 
price is
  posted. If the customer, generally a factory, is willing to cut its 
consumption 20 percent
  from its normal level, then it accepts the bid, and the utility pays the 
customer the posted
  price, minus the normal retail cost per kilowatt-hour. If the bulk price is 
$250 a
  megawatt-hour, for example, that makes electricity 25 cents a 
kilowatt-hour, compared with
  a typical price to the factory of 5 cents or so. For every kilowatt-hour 
that the factory does
  not use on the next day, the company pays 20 cents.

  The transaction has two functions. It cuts the risk of the grid running 
short of power and
  causing a blackout. And by reducing the peak demand, it takes a few buyers 
out of the
  market and makes the price lower for the remaining buyers. As the summer 
ended,
  proponents of this kind of marketing said that the unanticipated price 
swings, especially in
  places like San Diego, where some customers faced bills that had tripled, 
showed the
  necessity for making hourly prices obvious to electricity users, so that 
they would not
  blithely continue with normal consumption patterns at times of 
extraordinary price spikes.

  But the California program is still small; on one tough day this summer, 
July 31, 29
  customers participated, cutting demand by 40 megawatts, compared with a 
peak demand
  of 21,000 megawatts.

  Pacific Gas and Electric charges customers $600 to enter the program and 
requires that
  they be able to cut demand by at least 500 kilowatts, which is enough to 
run about 100 big
  houses. But it has applied for permission to cut the entry fee to $100 and 
take applicants
  who can cut demand by only 250 kilowatts.

  Such transactions are only possible through electronic commerce, but by 
setting just one
  price in a 24-hour period, P.G.& E.'s system is hardly taking full 
advantage. Wisconsin
  Electric Power began a more flexible system this summer in which it invites 
big customers
  to log on to a site, where it offers a price per kilowatt-hour not used. If 
it does not attract
  enough bidders to meet its needs, it can post a new bid price a few minutes 
later.

  Such transactions could apply the market forces that already exist at the 
wholesale level to
  the level of the electricity user, possibly even a homeowner.

  ''There's been a whole lot of debate over the years as to whether or not an 
average
  consumer will ever shift consumption based on price principles,'' said 
Scott A. Weiner, a
  senior vice president of Sithe Northeast, an independent power producer. 
''On the other
  hand, people who run large office buildings or factories can get those 
price signals in a very
  strong way,'' said Mr. Weiner, a former environmental commissioner for New 
Jersey.

  BUT, he said, at the moment, there is a supply curve -- a changing level of 
the amount
  available, depending on the price offered -- but no real demand curve, 
because the buyers
  do not know what the price is and thus cannot respond. Demand is therefore 
not affected
  by price.

  ''In the absence of a demand response, nobody can ever say, 'The price is 
too high, I'm not
  going to pay that,' '' Mr. Weiner said. ''As load response programs come 
into development,
  it's clear the Web will play a very vital part of making that real and 
accessible.''

  A second form of e-commerce is emerging on a business-to-business model, 
and it's one of
  the few forms that the government has required. It is called Oasis, for 
Open Access
  Same-Time Information System, ordered by the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission.
  Oasis gives companies that build free-standing power plants a way to market 
their power
  and for companies that consume electricity a way to see the market. Oasis 
systems are
  increasingly operated by new entities called Independent System Operators, 
which have
  been formed on the East Coast and in California to run the transmission 
grids that were
  formerly controlled by electric utilities.

  The systems vary from place to place, but are supposed to show the price of 
electricity,
  sometimes broken down by location, to take account of transmission 
bottlenecks.

  At the California Independent System Operator, William H. Simmons, the 
manager of
  market applications, development and support, said that some aspects of 
electricity trading
  existed years ago on electronic bulletin boards. But the ability of users 
to identify available
  transmission links and schedule their use depended on the Web. ''It could 
not have
  happened if it were not for the Internet,'' he said. The Independent System 
Operator works
  with the California Power Exchange to arrange delivery of the power that 
generators and
  customers contract for on the exchange.

  Both Oasis and programs like E-Bid have the potential to adjust electricity 
use to reflect
  costs, experts say, and that would be one way to hold down peak demand and 
thus make
  the system less prone to overload.

  Eric Hirst, an energy consultant in Oak Ridge, Tenn., and a former 
scientist at the national
  laboratory there, speaking at a conference in Washington this spring on 
reliability problems,
  said the result would contrast with the former pattern of electricity use. 
When people know
  the price of a product they are consuming, they behave differently, 
economists say; in the
  case of electricity, they will consume it in relation to its seasonal price 
or even hourly price.

  As Mr. Hirst said, ''When people used to pay 5 cents a kilowatt-hour, it 
didn't matter to
  them whether electricity was free or $2 a kilowatt-hour.'' 

  Graph: ''Lights Out'' Californians use so much electricity that the state 
is flirting with
  blackouts. And because of deregulation , prices are sharply higher, 
especially in peak
  periods. Now, utilities are paying some big customers to cut their 
consumption during
  those periods. Below, the California Power Exchange's output and prices for

Report: US Transition To Competitive Pwr Markets Muddled

09/20/2000
Dow Jones Energy Service

(This article was originally published Tuesday) 


WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The U.S. electricity sector is mired in a "prolonged 
and muddled transition" from
regulated monopolies to competitive markets, and the political arena offers 
little hope of fixing the problem,
according to the authors of a new report from Cambridge Energy Research 
Associates and Arthur Andersen.

The report, "Electric Power Trends 2001," paints a picture of inefficiently 
structured and balkanized power markets
hampered by inelastic demand and a gridlocked power grid. 

With myriad special interests involved in framing the debate, politicians at 
neither the state nor the federal level are
likely to resolve the problems anytime soon, said Cambridge Energy's Lawrence 
Makovich and Arthur Andersen's
Jon Wierda. 

"Unfortunately, the power industry right now is muddling through," Makovich 
said. "There isn't an effective political
process to sort this out." 

"We don't see this as something that's going to have a quick fix," agreed 
Wierda. 

The solution to the problem is "expert design," rather than the political 
process, Makovich said. 

The report assesses the status of electric industry competition two years 
after California became the first state to
deregulate and open up its retail power market. 

And with California's ill-designed and flawed market restructuring causing a 
headline-grabbing power-supply crisis,
there is an increasing risk that a backlash will cause policymakers to 
re-regulate the industry, Makovich said. 

Already a half-dozen states have moved to slow down previously approved plans 
to open up power markets to
competition, Makovich said, citing New Mexico, North Carolina and Oklahoma as 
among those. 

"There are right ways and wrong ways to put a competitive market together," 
he said, critical of the "serious flaws"
in California's approach, which contributed to a dearth in investment in 
generation and transmission capacity. 

The report identified a number of what it deemed surprises in the wake of 
California's first-in-the-nation
deregulation experiment. 

Among them, the report cited: 

- A patchwork quilt of restructured markets has developed, the result of the 
failure of Congress to issue a top-down
restructuring mandate providing "immediate and sweeping changes." As of 2003, 
only half of U.S. electricity
consumers will have a choice among competitive power providers, the report 
found. 

- In states where customers do have a choice among competitive providers, 
they are choosing not to choose. "Less
than 1% of electric customers switched from a traditional supplier in 1999, 
even though more than 20% of retail
customers could choose among alternative power suppliers," the report found. 

- The lack of investment in transmission interconnections has contributed to 
balkanized power markets with "sharp
locational price differentials," the report said. 

- Volatility in power markets once deemed abnormal is rapidly becoming the 
norm, despite flourishing competitive
spot markets for wholesale power. 

- This market volatility has prompted what could become "an electric supply 
tsunami," as proposals have been
advanced to build 240,000 megawatts of generation capacity, an amount 
equivalent to one-third of the existing
capacity in the U.S. 

- Transmission capacity has declined and bottlenecks aren't being resolved, 
contributing to increased threats of
blackouts and brownouts. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's order on 
regional transmission
organizations puts the issue at "center stage," the report said. "However, 
the order is not a bold move to confront
gridlock." 

Many of the surprises identified in the report are interwoven with one 
another. 

For instance, the potential for supply to overwhelm demand, represented by 
the large number of new power plant
proposals, is exacerbated by the economics of the industry that provide an 
incentive to keep older plants operating. 

There are 40,000 megawatts of new power plant capacity now under 
construction, and another 30,000 megawatts
for which developers are seeking permits to build, Makovich said. Even with a 
50% failure rate, that represents two
to three times the amount needed, he said. 

And the surprise doubling in natural gas prices over the past year 
complicates those development plans, since 93%
of the planned projects involve gas-fired plants, the report said. The report 
attributed the doubling in gas prices to a
lack of coordination between investments in natural gas supply and power 
generation. 

"High gas prices make old plants all the more valuable," said Makovich. 

Further, the surprising value of divested power plants, many of which are 
more than 30 years old, and which sold for
as much as four times book value, has resulted in utilities' stranded 
investment being much less than anticipated. 

The gridlocked transmission network complicates the "misalignment 
geographically" of much of the planned power
plant development, Makovich said. He noted that California, where there is a 
severe supply crisis, hasn't built a new
plant in a decade, while Texas is overbuilding. 

Makovich credited ill-designed markets with the failure of retail customers 
to switch power suppliers. 

A key component of California's supply crisis was the "well-intentioned" 
decision to impose a rate freeze for retail
customers until the state's three investor-owned utilities paid down their 
stranded investment, Makovich said. 

But without retail customers receiving a price signal allowing them to react 
to growing market volatility, there was no
demand response, and the volatility was exacerbated. 

The California market design left San Diego's consumers subject to 
spot-market pricing just as the supply crisis
caused by the price freeze erupted, he said. 

"The companies with active management able to react to surprises are the 
companies that will survive" the
transition, said Wierda. The "tsunami" of power plant investment will require 
a portfolio approach to asset
management, he said. 

Successful companies will be headed by chief executive officers who act as 
"chief risk officers," he said.

 Escaping Rate Freeze

  PG&E Corp. is banking on the proposed sale of its extensive Northern 
California
  hydropower operations to help it get out from under a consumer-rate freeze 
that the
  company says has cost it $2.2 billion this summer. The San Francisco-based 
company's
  utility unit, Pacific Gas & Electric Co., wants to sell the 4,000-megawatt 
hydroelectric
  system -- the largest network in North America -- to an unregulated fellow 
affiliate. Such a
  move would generate upward of $2.8 billion in cash and allow the utility to 
pay off its
  so-called stranded costs, principally expensive nuclear-power plants. Once 
that happens,
  the utility said in filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange 
Commission, it intends to
  seek permission from state regulators to end the consumer-rate cap. Under 
the state's
  1996 electric- deregulation law, PG&E would then be free to raise rates and 
recoup
  losses caused by this summer's spike in the wholesale electricity price.

HEADLINE: SDG&E Seeks $16 Million for Energy-Efficiency Assistance for 
Customers 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, July 24, 2000 

BODY: 
 
To provide its customers with additional assistance this summer and next, San 
Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) has requested from the California Public 
Utilities Commission (CPUC) $16 million over the next two years to increase 
funding for energy-efficiency programs.
"Our customers need assistance today in lowering their energy costs and 
today's proposal will bring an additional $16 million funding to encourage 
energy conservation in our region," said Edwin A. Guiles, president of SDG&E. 
"This money can be used to help replace old, inefficient appliances, such as 
air conditioners and refrigerators, which will result in reduced electric 
bills and less strain on our state's electric-supply system."
Of the $16 million, SDG&E would allocate an additional $4.3 million 
exclusively for low-income energy-efficiency assistance programs over the 
next two years.  
Under the proposal filed Friday, the low-income assistance funds will be used 
to expand existing programs, such as refrigerator and evaporative cooler 
replacements, while introducing new programs, including room air-conditioner 
replacements and evaporative cooler maintenance and repair. The program also 
includes incentives for landlords to replace refrigerators and air 
conditioners in rental units.
The rest of the money would go into other energy-efficiency programs to 
provide incentives for removal and recycling of operating second 
refrigerators; refrigerator and room air-conditioner replacement; replacement 
of inefficient pool pumps; and increased incentives for a variety of programs 
to benefit small businesses.
Funds for these additional incentives come from 1999 programs that did not 
draw as much customer participation as expected. For instance, large 
customers requested less than half the amount budgeted for a program designed 
to provide energy-efficiency incentives to them.
Details on the programs are still being developed, but they should be in 
place in early September. The CPUC is expected to act on SDG&E's filing in 
late August.
In California's newly created competitive energy marketplace, SDG&E is a 
delivery-service provider. For those customers who have not chosen another 
energy service provider, SDG&E buys electricity from the California Power 
Exchange (Cal-PX) and passes that cost directly onto its customers, with no 
mark-up. The price of power is now a function of supply and demand in the 
open market. Over the last several weeks, SDG&E customers have seen their 
electric bills rise sharply due to the significant increase in commodity 
costs as a result of power demand in California and surrounding states.
Friday's proposal marks the latest in a series of actions SDG&E has taken 
recently to help customers grapple with high electric prices.
On July 20, SDG&E and the Cal-PX proposed a new market-based power bidding 
solution to the CPUC that would allow SDG&E to procure power for customers 
with less price volatility over the next five to nine months.
On July 14, SDG&E filed a request with the CPUC to accelerate the return of 
$100 million in customer money from a CPUC-controlled account. The CPUC's 
approval of SDG&E's request would release of money acquired from 
power-generating benefits of San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station and other 
assets would decrease the August and September residential electric bills by 
$34, or $17 a month.
That proposal, combined with the deregulation-dividend checks most SDG&E 
customers will receive next month, will result in a total of about $500 
million benefit to them in August and September -- nearly$300 for the typical 
residential customer -- helping to ease cash-flow problems from higher 
electricity prices.
The company is actively promoting a level-pay program to all customers, which 
enables them to even out their bill payments over the course of the year, so 
they can manage better against their monthly household budget. Those 
customers participating in the plan will see bills this summer that are 
comparable to last summer's bills.
SDG&E also has increased communications to both residential and business 
customers regarding the changes in the energy marketplace, available 
energy-efficiency funding and conservation tips for reducing electric bills.
Information about these programs is available by calling 1-800-411-SDGE.
San Diego Gas & Electric is a public utility that provides service to 3 
million consumers through 1.2 million electric meters and 740,000 natural gas 
meters in San Diego and southern Orange counties. SDG&E is a subsidiary of 
Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE), a Fortune 500 energy services holding company based 
in San Diego, with 12,000 employees, revenues of nearly $5.5 billion and more 
than 9 million customers in the United States, Europe, Canada, Mexico and 
South America.

SDG&E filed a Complaint with the FERC that requests an "emergency order 
capping at $250 per MWh the prices" for all parties selling into the Calif 
ISO and the Calif PX.   SDG&E claims that the Calif ISO and the Calif PX are 
"fundamentally flawed and inherently incapable of producing workable 
competition".

EPMI is directly impacted by this Complaint.   Even though FERC has approved 
EPMI's Market-Based Rate certificate after a finding that we had no market 
power, this Complaint would restrict us from selling at above $250 per MWh 
into the Calif ISO and Calif PX.

Government Affairs is responding in two ways --

1. A direct response from EPMI to FERC responding that there has been no 
finding that EPMI has market power and therefore we should not lose our 
market-based rate authority.

2. A response through WPTF (Western Power Trading Forum) and EPSA to argue 
more broadly the facts of what is going on in California (bad hedging by 
SDG&E) and poor market structure rules.

The fundamental problem is that the FERC is running scared about price spikes 
and may, without any real thinking, approve such a Complaint.  SDG&E has 
asked for expedited treatment and a decision could be out as early as mid 
August.

This issue again highlights how important the on-going FERC Investigation in 
Market Issues is for Enron.  We are putting together a detailed plan of how 
Enron will present our recommendations to FERC in this Investigation and will 
discuss this with you.

Call with questions.  

Thanks,

Jim

US FERC Chairman Vows Action By Dec On Western Pwr Woes
? 
10/05/2000 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will 
act no later than December in response to power capacity and volatility 
problems that plagued Western power markets this year, Chairman James Hoecker 
said Thursday. 
Hoecker, after appearing before the Senate Energy Committee, told reporters 
that he expected the results of an expedited staff investigation of the 
matter to be forwarded to the commission before the month is out. 
The commission will "take serious action" in response to the staff report 
"before the holidays," he said, without elaborating. 
Before the panel, Hoecker said he expected the commission to act in response 
to the staff's nationwide probe of problems besetting competitive wholesale 
markets before the end of this year. The staff report on the nationwide 
investigation is due Nov. 1. 
In meeting with reporters after the hearing, Hoecker appeared to indicate 
that the response to the Western market woes could come sooner than December. 
Hoecker outlined the tentative timetable after the Senate hearing into 
concerns the Pacific Northwest is becoming increasingly prone to power supply 
shortages in the coming years. 
The Northwest Power Planning Council projects that by 2003 the regions runs a 
one in four risk of a power shortage - and resulting grid blackouts or 
brownouts - during peak summer and winter demand periods as demand outstrips 
supply. 
In order to lessen that 25% risk to an acceptable 5%, the council determined 
the region would need an additional 3,000 megawatts of new generation 
capacity, either installed or imported from elsewhere. 
The hearing featured testimony from the Bonneville Power Administration and 
others regarding how California's grid capacity problems this summer have had 
an adverse affect on the region in terms of price volatility. 
Prepared testimony from BPA featured a graph illustrating that the region's 
spot market prices during the two years prior to California's power market 
restructuring never exceeded $50 per megawatt-hour, and typically were well 
below that level. 
Since the California power exchange began operating in May 1998, spot market 
volatility markedly increased into a price spike this summer in excess of 
$200 per megawatt-hour. 
But another key factor in the Pacific Northwest's problems was dry weather 
that depressed available hydropower generation from the region's massive 
complex of federally owned dams, said Stephen Oliver, BPA's vice president of 
bulk power marketing and transmission services. 
The difference between a wet year and a dry year is 5,000 megawatts of power 
generation capacity, Oliver told the committee. 
Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., who chaired the hearing, elicited from Oliver 
that operational changes mandated to aid migration of salmon and other 
endangered fish cost the system another 1,000 megawatts of capacity. 
"At this point, the pricing problems in California and the Northwest appear 
to be related," he said, citing near-record warm weather in the region and 
lower-than normal hydropower availability. 
Additionally, Hoecker attributed the region's price volatility to 
California's "very high reliance on the spot market." 
The supplies of power in the U.S. West are "simply inadequate," Hoecker said. 
The picture painted by the hearing testimony served in contrast to the 
"rumbling" of officials in California that imports of federal hydropower from 
the Pacific Northwest were contributing to California's market problems, 
noted Sen. Gordon Smith R-Ore. 
"It is the structure of (California's) market that has created the problem," 
said Smith, noting, too, that the state's discouragement of new power plant 
capacity has contributed to the problem. 
"It looks like the markets have gone haywire," said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., 
who attributed the problems to deregulated power markets. He vowed to fight 
any congressional deregulation legislation that threatens to raise power 
costs in the Pacific Northwest.

Interesting info for those of you who follow or have an interest in this type 
of data regarding succes of market liberalisation.  Further interesting to 
note that household prices fell in Sweden and Finland, markets that already 
had liberalised wholesale markets, after furhter market opening to 
residential secotr.  Note fall in German prices, which, despite bad access 
regime, ended up with a suicidal competition in the wholesale market by 
incumbents.  Let me know if you need more/have any questions.   mcs

Sandi, Joe Hartsoe, Mary Hain --

Sandi --

I realize that the bill needs Assembly passage, but given the current 
situation I don't see why this won't happen.  I am still very concerned about 
the language in the newsstory which creates a "witch hunt" mentality to go 
after "suppliers" for the refund to San Diego.  With the ISO report that 
concludes that there was market power in certain hours, we are exposed to the 
ability to have a retroactive pricing.

Joe -

Will you please look into legal of retroactive ratemaking.contained in the 
news story?  I am not sure if it makes sense to have to "refund" our 
earnings, but don't they do this in New England?

Mary --

Look at the ISO report and let's determine our total exposure.  If FERC wants 
to allow the ISO to restate energy prices during certain hours, will we have 
a huge exposure?

Let me know.

Jim

PG&E's Rate Cap Proposal: Leading the Charge for Re-Regulation, or Protecti=
ng
Itself from Economic Disaster?
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Pacific Gas & Electric Co. (PG&E), in filings with the California Public
Utilities Commission (CPUC) and California Independent System Operator
(Cal-ISO), has requested that a rate cap be placed on wholesale purchases
in the state. The utility is asking the CPUC to lower the current rate
cap from $250 per megawatt hour to $100, or 10 cents per kilowatt hour.
In seeking the rate cap, PG&E is joined by Edison International, the parent
company of Southern California Edison, and The Utility Action Network (TURN=
),
a ratepayer advocacy group.

ANALYSIS: The current rate cap of $250 per megawatt hour in the wholesale
market of California resulted from the price spikes experienced in San
Diego this summer. As San Diego Gas & Electric had paid off its stranded
costs, the retail rate freeze in its area was lifted and SDG&E customers
were exposed to market-based prices, which doubled and at times tripled
due to increased demand in the state and power supply concerns. PG&E custom=
ers
were not exposed to the price spikes because, at the time, PG&E had not
paid off its own stranded costs and was still under a retail rate freeze.

Yet the company has felt the impact from the price spikes just the same.
PG&E buys a great deal of its power on the wholesale market, and as a resul=
t
is about $2.2 billion in debt (some figures suggest it is as high as $2.7
billion). Due to the retail rate freeze still in effect, PG&E has been
unable to pass this debt on to customers by raising its rates. In real
terms, PG&E was paying up to 19 cents per kilowatt hour on the wholesale
market this summer, when by law it was only allowed to charge its customers
on average 5 cents per kilowatt hour. In total, PG&E has paid about $2.7
billion more to suppliers than it can bill customers for, and this amount
is growing by hundreds of millions each month. This explains the utility's
motivation in wanting to see the CPUC further lower the cap on wholesale
rates in California.

However, even though PG&E as a whole is in debt, the utility=01*as well as
other divisions under parent company PG&E Corp.=01*is still making money of=
f
deregulation in California. For instance, PG&E's Diablo Canyon nuclear
plant has been able to capitalize on the high value of power on the wholesa=
le
market. The utility confirmed recently that altogether its power facilities=
=01*
the
ones left after the utility was forced to divest the bulk of its power
assets=01*still provide about $150 million a month to the utility. In addit=
ion,
PG&E Corp.'s unregulated energy commodity trading operation has been doing
very well. And the unregulated National Energy Group=01*which operates in
markets outside of California, such as Massachusetts, Rhode Island and
New Hampshire=01*posted a 233-percent profit increase for the second quarte=
r.
Thus, it is important to note the distinction between PG&E and its parent,
PG&E Corp. Ironically, as a whole, PG&E Corp. has stated that it does not
support rate caps, and has opposed the issue when it has surfaced in other
states.

PG&E reported second-quarter earnings of $216 million on $2.3 billion in
revenue, representing a 26-percent increase over the same quarter last
year. Third quarter earnings also reportedly will be strong. This puts
PG&E in an awkward predicament. On one hand, PG&E wants to convince=20
shareholders
that the company is doing well and making money from the commodities that
it sells. On the other hand, PG&E is attempting to convince regulators
that it is losing money due to the high wholesale prices that it must pay
for power. In fairness, though, the revenue PG&E has earned cannot come
anywhere near to paying off the massive debt the company has accrued due
to its obligation of serving customers.

PG&E's rate freeze is scheduled to end March 31, 2002, at the very latest,
or sooner if it is determined that PG&E's stranded costs have been repaid,
something that utility executives say may already have taken place. Due
to higher-than-expected revenues and higher-than-market valuations of the
utility's assets, it may very well be the case that PG&E's stranded costs
are already paid off. When this is officially determined by the CPUC, PG&E
will argue that customers should be liable for some or all of the debt
it has assumed while the rate caps were in place. The CPUC has scheduled
a hearing to address these issues on Oct. 19. The core question of these
proceedings will be whether or not PG&E should be allowed to turn over
its debt to customers through rate increases once the rate freeze is lifted=
.
PG&E wants to be able to retroactively bill customers for its debt, based
on the date which the CPUC determines that PG&E had in fact paid off its
stranded costs, a point groups such as TURN will surely protest.

It may seem surprising that TURN was among the group with PG&E that filed
the petition to lower the rate cap on wholesale prices. Typically, TURN
and PG&E (along with most utilities) are at polar opposites regarding most
issues. However, both agree that wholesale rates are too high and want
to see a new cap put into place, but for completely different reasons.
TURN says that PG&E and other utilities took a risk when agreeing to the
rate freeze and they should not be allowed to pass debts that resulted
from that risk onto customers. TURN continues to retain a watch over the
proceedings related to PG&E's proposal, specifically with regard to the
possibility that the CPUC will allow the utility to raise rates on customer=
s.

Within the course of these new developments, it's important to be clear
on PG&E's motivations. Some California lawmakers and consumer advocates
have called for a complete return to regulation, arguing that deregulation
in California has become a failed experiment. Many have surmised that PG&E'=
s
proposal for wholesale caps is essentially a call to return California
to a regulated structure. I think this is a misinterpretation. PG&E has
very clearly stated that its proposal is a "necessary short-term step to
try to bring prices back in line." PG&E's efforts really shouldn't be viewe=
d
as a move to return California to a regulated market. Rather, PG&E is merel=
y
attempting to protect its own interests. The utility wants to secure tempor=
ary
lower rates for the power it needs to buy on the wholesale market and trans=
fer
its debts to customers once the rate freeze is lifted. A return to regulati=
on
via a permanent rate cap would not be in PG&E's best interests as it contin=
ues
to sell power from its nuclear plant. In addition, PG&E probably recognizes
that regulation would discourage additional companies from building new
power plants in California, which would not be good for the long-term econo=
my
of the state. This also would do little to lower wholesale prices in=20
California.
As we discovered this summer, the less supply, the higher the price for
power.

PG&E's proposal to lower rate caps on wholesale prices is, more than anythi=
ng
else, an attempt to protect itself from what it perceives as disastrous
economic impact if it is not able to transfer its debt to customers. A
recent Wall Street Journal report inferred that if wholesale prices continu=
e
to exceed what PG&E can charge customers, the utility could become=20
"technically
insolvent" sometime next year. It will be interesting to see if the CPUC
has the same perception when it evaluates PG&E's proposal later this month.

Legislative package only delays pain, critics warn 
By Craig D. Rose 
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER 
September 1, 2000 
Consumer and political leaders -- as well as Sempra Energy's chief executive 
-- said yesterday that the three electricity bills before Gov. Gray Davis do 
nothing to fix the fundamental cause of soaring bills. 
The cause, they say, is that power generators can continue to charge what 
most characterize as exorbitant prices for their electricity -- and consumers 
ultimately face the daunting task of paying them. 
No matter if all of the bills are signed, the leaders say California's power 
market will remain a seller's game that gouges overmatched consumers. And 
while San Diego Gas and Electric Co.'s hard-pressed customers may pay less 
now, they will pay back all or nearly all the savings -- plus interest -- 
beginning in 2003. 
"The governor's bill postpones the pain, but the pain is still there," said 
Maureen O'Connor, a former mayor of San Diego who has been active in seeking 
relief from the soaring bills afflicting SDG&E's 1.2 million electricity 
customers. 
The rate bill promoted by Davis and now awaiting his signature will have 
SDG&E's customers pay about 6.5 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity, or 
70 percent more than what they paid as recently as May. 
Power companies, however, will continue to charge the customers as they have; 
presently, they're charging about 21 cents per kilowatt hour for SDG&E 
customers. The difference between 6.5 cents and whatever prices above that 
level emerge from the state's volatile power market will be recorded as IOUs 
for each customer in so-called balancing accounts. 
A second bill before the governor could provide up to $150 million in state 
money to help pay the balancing accounts, but the bulk of the IOUs will 
almost certainly be paid by SDG&E customers themselves when they become due 
in 2003 or 2004. A third bill before the governor would speed the 
construction of power plants. 
So while the rate bill lets customers pay less now than they owe, it 
obligates them to pay the balance with interest later. 
The situation creates the potential for a troublesome compounding effect: The 
higher electricity prices grow, the more is set aside in the balancing 
accounts -- and the greater the wallop to customer wallets when the accounts 
come due. 
Based upon prices now paid for future electric deliveries, Sempra Energy 
estimates customers will owe $664 million by 2003. IOUs of that magnitude, 
said SDG&E, will require that customers pay a surcharge of $40 monthly for a 
year on top of whatever they are already paying for their power bills. 
Keep in mind that typical residential bills at this time last year were about 
$55; they now stand at about $130. Consumer advocates say it's likely power 
prices will remain at levels that will lead to huge debts for customers under 
the Davis proposal. 
"The generators have shown themselves to be unconscionable in extorting 
profits," said Nettie Hoge, executive director of TURN, a San Francisco-based 
consumer group. 
Hoge said the bills that emerged "seemed the best a corrupt system could spit 
out." She added that TURN and other groups will shift their focus to 
pressuring the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to restrain the electric 
generating companies and wholesale power markets. 
FERC, she said, must legally determine if charges from generating companies 
are reasonable. TURN and other groups will also press for re-regulation of 
the industry and will begin to explore municipally owned generating plants. 
Michael Shames of the Utility Consumers' Action Network supports the Davis 
bill, although he said it won't fix "the almost irreparably broken California 
energy system." 
"The problem is that California's electricity customers have been subjected 
to market prices in a dysfunctional energy market," Shames said. "It's a 
market controlled by the sellers of power and their cronies." 
But Shames said the Davis bill provides at least temporary protection against 
further rate shocks, and he expects taxpayers across the state will 
ultimately assist SDG&E's customers in paying their electricity bills. 
But Jamie Court, executive director of the Foundation for Taxpayer and 
Consumer Rights, which has called for re-regulation of the industry, opposes 
the rate-cap legislation. 
"This keeps ratepayers and taxpayers on the hook for the costs," said Court, 
who added that the bill also locks in near doubling of power rates compared 
to last year. 
Stephen Baum, chief executive officer of Sempra, said the bill puts SDG&E -- 
a Sempra subsidiary -- in the position of financing the difference between 
what power companies charge for their power and what it collect from 
customers over the next three years. 
The balancing accounts, Baum said, could grow so large that they will 
challenge Sempra's ability to borrow to cover them. 
"The problem is with the wholesale markets," said Baum, who today becomes 
chairman as well as chief executive of Sempra. "This legislation does nothing 
but postpone a big bill." 
He added that Sempra believed the bill included ambiguities that could be 
illegal if not later clarified by the California Public Utilities Commission. 
"If (the PUC) can't or won't, then I think the legislation is legally flawed 
and can't stand," Baum said.

I talked  with Jamie  Rosenfeld,  the   CERA  SVP     and he  said Dan Yergin 
is 
very much interested in this  type of   advocacy  and  right now is highly 
sought out by TV  and   print media  on these  same   issues which are of 
concern  to Enron -- on  supply  security,  managing  price volatility  and 
supply  turmoil, avoiding regulatory  backlash,  and promoting just  letting 
the  market  work .  Beyond   Dan  taking   media  referrals  and  an Op  Ed 
--  they suggested   several more  ideas.  

1.  November  1-2  is  CERA's Houston Conference Roundtable.  The  day 
before  the Conference Enron  could host  a special  session,  a top 100  
Leadership Circle, or  a special dinner  and   dinnner /speaker  to which key 
media  would  be  invited.  Enron  could  invite  special  attendees  like  
PUC, NARUC  ,  Congressional  types  and other Opiniion Leaders  to attend.  
We  would   get the  shadow  benefit  of   1500-2000  attendees  and media  
in town  for the  Roundtable  the next  day.  

2.
In concert with the  recent  release  of   the   CERA  Electric Power  Trends 
publication,  CERA  would quickly  prepare  a  similar  short  version of  a 
Natural  Gas Trends publication (much is on the shelf   already)  and  
Enron   could  purchase  bulk   copies of  each .  We  could  use a  custom  
cover letter  from  Ken and/or Jeff   as the opportunity  to  inform    PUC  
chairs, key  Members  of  Congress,  the  two  Presidential  campaigns' 
leadership  and other Opinion leaders about  issues of importance  to Enron  
and its   businesses  -- this merges nicely  with
the  pro  energy  choice, pro markets, pro deregulation  messages contained 
in the  text and  graphics of  Cera's  Trends  publications.

3.
Enron  could   sponsor     a  10 minute  and  or even  a 30- 40 minute   
Energy  Security  themed  multi media  presentation  full of  intellectual 
content  addressing the  key  electricity  and gas  reliability  and pro 
market forces  messages  Enron is  espousing .We would   advise  target 
audiences in  a  letter  as to how to access  the show on the Cera  media  
center  on their  web site  and  Cera  could  do this in concert with   
EBS.   Or  it   could  be  an add- on  to  the  Trends  publication/ letter  
send  out.  In any case  the multi media message  gets the  advantage of  
exposure  to  the 10 000  eyeballs  the  CERA  site   already offers. 

4.   In Feb  CERA  has  its  Houston Executive  Conference.  If  we have  a  
rough  winter  that  could  be  great timing
for  Enron  to  use this  as a Problem Solving and Policy Setting Forum  for 
a  high level   'how  to'  Workshop --and/or   invite  in  some  natural  gas 
and electricity  end  users  and/or  gas distributor speakers  from  the   
buy side that  "did it  right"  and  can  talk  about   how they  hedged  or  
set  up their  portfolios    to make it  successfully through a  tough  
winter market.  Security  analyst speakers talking  about   doing it the  
right  way  would also be  useful.

My   thought  is  that   Item   2.    sending  the  Trends  publications   
coupled with   brief  multi media  messaging
(from  Item 3) might  give us the bigger   impact  faster and more  
targeted   than  the others.  

 Do any of  these  appeal   to  you  ?

Cal-PX subpoenaed over price spikes
  
10/02/2000 
The Energy Report 
(c) Copyright 2000 Pasha Publications, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
The California Power Exchange (Cal-PX) has responded to subpoenas from 
several federal and state bodies investigating the price surges that hit 
California's wholesale market this summer, according to state officials. 
FERC, the California Public Utilities Commission, the California Attorney 
General, the California Electricity Oversight Board and auditors from the 
Joint Legislative Audit Committee of the California State Legislature are 
currently conducting investigations into electricity deals and pricing 
practices in the wholesale energy market during the summer. All of the 
agencies have issued different subpoenas demanding the release of documents 
pertaining to market conditions and participants. 
A Cal-PX spokesman called the subpoenas "no big deal" and said they are 
served to protect the confidentiality of the information given to the various 
agencies. Information about specific marketers and their methods could be 
detrimental if it were released to the public, the spokesman added. Attorneys 
for the Cal-PX have been cooperating with the different bodies conducting the 
investigations. Initially the agencies had announced they would work together 
on their investigations, but the need to issue separate subpoenas for the 
release of information demands that the bodies proceed individually. In 
addition, some of the agencies have needed to issue more than one subpoena to 
receive different records, contributing to the paper trail arriving at the 
Cal-PX.

Edison International CFO Disputes 'Technical Insolvency' Claim
By Mark Golden
  
10/03/2000 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Edison International's treasurer and chief financial 
officer, Ted Craver, disputed Tuesday a claim made last week that 
California's utilities risk "technical insolvency" in 2001. 
Since May, California's three investor-owned utilities have been spending far 
more to purchase needed electricity than they are getting paid by customers. 
As a result, the undercollections in the "transition revenue account" of 
Edison's regulated utility unit, Southern California Edison, grew by $1.97 
billion between May 1 and August 31, the company reported to the Securities 
Exchange Commission. 
An article Wednesday in the Wall Street Journal, which is published by Dow 
Jones & Co., said that "if the cost of wholesale power continues to exceed 
the price these utilities are allowed to bill their customers, as currently 
seems likely, they could become technically insolvent sometime next year." 
"The way this term was used insinuated that you take the transition revenue 
account, and whatever the gross number is equates to the amount of debt that 
you would have to raise," Craver said in an interview. "That is not at all 
the way it works. That is not an accurate portrayal." 
California Gov. Gray Davis acknowledged the concerns Friday, saying, 
"California consumers have a legitimate need for California's utilities to 
remain solvent, and the state must be committed toward that end." 
But Edison's Craver said the situation is not that simple. 
"That transition revenue account balance says nothing about what we have to 
fund in the market," Craver said. "Southern California Edison has some 37 
balancing and memo accounts set up by the California Public Utilities 
Commission. What we have to fund is the net amount of all of them, plus 
whatever else is going on, and the net figure is considerably smaller than 
the $1.97 billion. It's like picking out one line item on the balance sheet 
and saying this is all that matters. No accountant does that or looks at it 
that way." 
Craver also said that the term "technical insolvency" has no specific meaning 
to him. 
A PG&E Corp (PCG) spokesman declined to comment when asked this week if it 
risks technical insolvency next year. The company is seeking refunds from 
independent generators that have been selling power to the state's utilities, 
and for the future it has asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to 
consider a return to cost-based pricing specific to each generating station 
in the state. 
Utility bond analysts, nevertheless, are concerned about California utility 
debt. 
"I don't believe the utilities are going to go bankrupt, but they don't have 
any assurance from the legislature, governor or regulators," Bear Stearns's 
Ted Olshanski said. "The uncertainty is critical." 
Bear Stearns has a negative outlook on Edison and PG&E bonds due to the 
uncertainty on the recovery of these energy costs. 
This summer's period of undercollections has continued into the fall, with 
the California's wholesale market for Wednesday power at $135 a 
megawatt-hour, compared with the $65/MWh that SCE gets from customers. 
The current best asking price for on-peak power fall all of 2001 in southern 
California is $85/MWh. 
When asked how long Edison can continue to fund the difference between its 
purchase power costs and the revenue it receives from customers, Craver 
responded: "How long can ratepayers or anyone afford those prices, which 
don't have anything to do with reality? The market mechanisms don't work." 
California's utilities are hoping to make significant changes to the market, 
and some of those changes would require action by the state legislature, 
which is out of session until December. 
"I don't know that this is something that waits for the legislature," Craver 
said. "There are a lot of things that can be done before the legislature 
meets. We have significant issues before the FERC and the CPUC." 
Olshanski said he hoped for a political solution. 
"We're not sure how its going to end," he said. "We expect regulators and 
legislators to step up and provide for a constructive resolution. In the 
past, the California legislature has approved measures to make companies 
whole."

I agree with Donna that we need to present our vision of the RTOs and our 
expectations of the shortcomings of the RTO filings prior to the October 15 
filing.   I would hope that we have a standardized presentation (Enron's 
policy objectives, regional issues, the good news, what's not right today, 
etc.) to share with FERC staff.  I would guess that we want to set up 
meetings by RTO / region so as to not overwhelm staff.  

>From my perspective, I'd focus on Cal ISO, NW RTO, MISO, Alliance RTO, Grid 
South, Florida Transco if I couldn't do all.  What do people think?

It seems to me that Joe Hartsoe should coordinate all of these meetings and 
make sure that we are bringing the right people at the right times.

Thanks,

Jim

Subject: Re: EPSA Meeting  

Since the rates departments are going to review the October 15 RTO filings, 
and because we expect many of them to be deficient, I think we can take 
advantage of some opportunities to set up meetings with the three directors 
-- Alice Fernandez, Rob Cupina, and Mike Coleman -- to educate them and their 
staffs on the minimum RTO requirements we feel are necessary for a successful 
RTO.  We can also take this opportunity to let them know some of the 
weaknesses we expect to see in the filings, so that they can begin to think 
about these issues before the filings are made.  Also, by meeting with FERC 
staff prior to the filings, we can state our positions without ex parte 
communications on any specific filings.  To make the meetings successful, 
we'll need to get input and information from the regional people on the 
status of the RTO negotiations.  It might also make sense to have a regional 
person attend these meetings to provide first hand accounts of what's been

Subject: EPSA Meeting

The EPSA meeting in Chicago was successful.  In addition to numerous 
stakeholders, the press was there in full force. It became clear that 
deregulation is not complete, and that the problem is not deregulation -- but 
continuing unnecessary regulation. 
    
Commissioner Massey's speech on why competition is necessary was actually 
quite good.  His message is approximately 90 percent consistent with Enron's 
on the wholesale level (He even called for Federal siting authority.).  He 
sees price caps as a stop gap only and votes for them as a last resort.  
However, he still contradicts himself when he questions the use of single 
price auctions because they do not work as intended; but, he comments that 
PJM is working.  I and others will work with him to make sure he 
understands.  

I spent time with Mike McLaughlin (Director of Corporate Applications) and 
Rob Cupina (Director of Rates, Central).  We spoke about the RTO filings due 
October 15.  I shared my concern that some of the RTO filings may be 
incomplete and asked what actions FERC may take if the filings are 
deficient.  Mike indicated that the RTO filings will be processed by the rate 
offices of the three regions (east, central and west) in Dan Larcamp's group 
(OMTR).  He believes that Order 2000 will become as "voluntary" as Order 436 
was.

If you would like to discuss or have particular questions, please do not 
hesitate to call -- 202.466.9150  JOE

Orange County/State briefs: Truckee firm offers cut-rate electricity

August 16, 2000

Orange County Register

A Truckee company is selling electricity for 8 cents per kilowatt hour, far
less than what many south Orange County residents have been paying this
summer. TenderLand Power Co. will guarantee the flat rate for a year,
starting Oct. 1, for up to 60,000 customers. That equates to roughly 5
percent of all the customers now using San Diego Gas & Electric Co.

This week, SDG&E is selling electricity for 17.6 cents per kilowatt hour.

Residents may want to wait before switching, because a cut in SDG&E bills
could be in the offing, said Jodi Beebe at the Utility Consumers' Action
Network in San Diego.

TenderLand Invites 60,000 Electricity Customers to Opt Out of Electric Rate
Crisis

08/15/2000

Business Wire

(Copyright (c) 2000, Business Wire)

TRUCKEE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 15, 2000--TenderLand Power Company
has invited 60,000 California electricity customers on a first-come,
first-served basis to choose TenderLand, receive a flat electric generation
rate, and stand up for their right under deregulation to switch away from
San Diego Gas & Electric, thereby completely opting out of the rate crisis
being experienced by SDG&E customers.

In response to the high electric rates in San Diego, the California
Legislature as well as the California Public Utilities Commission has
proposed laws and procedures which create a deferred payment plan disguised
as a lower, or "frozen" fixed electric rate plan. The proposed directives
may require even those electric customers who switch or plan to switch from
SDG&E to pay for the costs of this "electric rate loan" whether or not they
receive their power from an alternative electric service provider like
TenderLand. Clearly, such a situation would infringe upon the rights of
electric ratepayers participating in a deregulated electricity market, as
they may still be forced to pay added costs for expensive energy purchased
by their local electricity distribution utility (like SDG&E) and consumed by
the utility's own customers.

"TenderLand views this possible situation as unfair to ratepayers who have
benefited by deregulation and exercised their right to choose, or plan to
choose an alternative electric service provider," said TenderLand Chief
Financial Officer Ken Keddington. "TenderLand is committed to taking all
possible action to protect its customers from these possible additional
costs while providing a renewable energy option."

"When California electricity customers choose TenderLand to receive
renewable power at a true flat electric generation rate, they will also join
TenderLand's crusade against passing added costs to those who want to opt
out of the statewide electric rate crisis, especially noticeable in San
Diego, by switching to alternative electric service providers."

The flat rate offer is limited to the first 60,000 new residential and
commercial customers who sign up with TenderLand. For more information, call
toll free at: 877/872-0932, or sign up on TenderLand's website at
www.TenderLand.com.

TenderLand Power Company, Inc. provides its customers with 100% renewable
power and is committed to furthering the development of new renewable
generation nationwide. The company is headquartered in Truckee, Calif.,
began retail operations in April 1999, and serves customers throughout most
of California.

Cal-ISO: underscheduling caused grid failures
  
09/28/2000 
Megawatt Daily 
(c) Copyright 2000 Pasha Publications, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 
Under-scheduling of load on the part of California's utilities caused 
reliability problems in the state's electricity grid this summer, Ziad 
Alaywan, the managing director of engineering and support at the California 
Independent System Operator (Cal-ISO) said. Speaking at a Cal-ISO stakeholder 
meeting this week, Alaywan said Cal-ISO was forced to spend over $100 million 
in out-of-market purchases this summer in order to cover unscheduled load not 
purchased by the utilities in the day-ahead markets. 
A confluence of factors added up to create the emergency situations the 
Cal-ISO faced this summer, according to Alaywan. He cited arbitrage between 
the California Power Exchange (Cal PX) and Cal-ISO markets, a reliance on 
real-time (rather than day-ahead) markets and a general shortage of power 
supply in California as reasons why California's power grid was stretched to 
its limits this summer. 
According to figures presented by Alaywan, the instance of under-scheduling 
was some 50% higher this summer than in the two previous summers. This 
under-scheduling resulted in a total of 36 stage 1 and 2 emergencies between 
June 1 and August 15 and dictated that the ISO curtail 13,450 MW on 12 
different occasions. In addition, the ISO spent $100,820,000 on out-of-market 
electricity purchases during that period, up from $790,000 the previous year. 
As a solution, Alaywan suggested increasing incentives to engage in forward 
scheduling of power and that supply be increased. The Cal-ISO has made a 
request for proposals for some 3000 MW for next summer to be used as a 
peaking management tool, as well as allotting $800 million for transmission 
upgrades over the next five years, Alaywan said. 
Elena Schmid, Cal-ISO's vice president of strategic development and 
communication, also speaking at the meeting cited insufficient generation, 
inadequate transmission, under-scheduling of load, a lack of price responsive 
demand, and the exercise of market power as market failures handicapping the 
ISO's smooth delivery of power. To combat these shortcomings, Jeanne Sole, in 
charge of long-term grid planning at the ISO, suggested that the ISO 
encourage expansion of the gird and the competitive provision of electricity 
for the California market. Changes must be made in the ISO and other entities 
involved in power transmission and regulation over the next 18 months to 
lessen the likelihood of such problems occurring in the future, the speakers 
said. ADP

Hello everyone,

Until further notice, my participation on meetings has come to an immediate
halt.  At a minimum, this includes DQI and stakeholder meetings.  The
attached letter below was distributed to all employees  today and gives an
explanation into the reasoning for this decision.  Obviously, this decision
impacts other areas besides SCE's participation in meetings, but this
elevates the concern over SCE's financial position in the market.  I am not
sure at this time if a formal press release will be sent out.  If you have
any questions, please let me know.

Dear Fellow Employees:

These have been times of great uncertainty and, quite frankly, great
frustration for everyone involved in trying to encourage state authorities
to immediately address the mounting undercollection of excessive wholesale
electricity costs that we and the state's other investor-owned utilities
have incurred over the past six months.

These costs for SCE alone, which currently cannot be passed on to customers
due to the mandatory rate freeze, total more than $2 billion.  As you can
see, we effectively have been forced to finance electricity purchases for
our customers, because the California wholesale electricity markets are not
workably competitive.  Despite our ongoing efforts to move the California
Public Utilities Commission and other state authorities to act with
urgency, the clearest signal we are getting from them at this point is
further delay.  With mounting debt, however, each day of delay costs us
more and further jeopardizes our ability to pay our bills, to continue
serving our customers in a reliable manner with superior customer service,
and to help sustain California's growing economy.

Toward this end, I am immediately implementing, as a first step, a series
of cost-reduction measures, including an immediate freeze on hiring,
general new construction and remodeling, and a suspension of all
nonessential equipment purchases and service contracts.  Additionally, we
are suspending charitable and community contributions, eliminating all
discretionary travel, and further reducing administrative expenses
throughout the company.

In the event that we do not receive appropriate and swift action from the
CPUC, it will be necessary to implement much more substantial reductions,
which would affect our workforce and major capital, infrastructure and O&M
expenditures.  Analysis and planning for this contingency are underway,
should such measures become necessary.  In all this, however, I should
emphasize our intention to retain a skilled workforce at SCE and to provide
electric service without compromising the safety of our employees.

The irony of all this is the fact that our company is performing well and
meeting its goals?thanks to all of you.  In a real sense, we and our
customers have become the victims of unintended consequences of a
California state market that is broken and dysfunctional.  We continue to
believe that a near-term rate increase is absolutely necessary to ease our
cash hemorrhage.  We do not yet know whether the CPUC will provide this
essential near-term relief.

I realize that these circumstances may create significant anxiety for
everyone, but I encourage you to remain focused on performing your jobs in
an excellent and safe manner.  This means we need everyone's cooperation
and continued efforts in order to be successful.  As we have done in past
weeks, we will keep you apprised of new developments relative to our
numerous filings regarding our energy procurement cost recovery effort and
the state and federal processes regarding market reform in general.

Chairman, President & CEO

SDG&E also said yesterday that it received "several" proposals from power
companies to provide fixed future prices for electricity, which involve
long-term contracts touted by power companies -- a "market solution" to the
rate roller coaster residents have experienced.

The utility declined to provide a precise number of proposal details but
said it would evaluate the offers over the next two weeks and make
recommendations to regulatory authorities. Peace said earlier that Enron is
expected to be a bidder, offering a fixed price about 50 percent above
rates of last May.

Let's see if we can get material to Lay or Skilling to call McNeally this 
week (Oct 9) so that we ask if they'll talk with Rebecca by Oct 15. ?What

Enron send to McNeally if he agrees? ?Do we have all of this?

We need to come up (very quickly) with a strategy on how to get the market 
information that will be important for FERC Investigation into the public 
arena.

I keep thinking that FERC can require the information and somehow get it made 
public right away.  

1. What information is not public that would be helpful?

2. What strategy will work to get FERC to take action?

To make sure that Enron is not missing any opportunities to make our points 
on competition, we need to develop some key message points and facts.  

My understanding is that the key story line is that  "COMPETITION IS WORKING 
AND SHOULD BE PUSHED FORWARD".  
We need to be able to give examples of what is happening - deregulation 
customers are winning.  For example, our CSU customers are just fine even 
with higher energy markets.

I think that are some key questions that we need to consider when we put 
these together:

Who is the audience?  My answer - California policymakers, key stakeholders, 
FERC, federal government.

Can we use this in the FERC Investigation on Markets?  My answer - we have 
to; California is too big and important not realize that California will play 
a role in FERC's discussions.

What is the timing of message?  My answer - Wherever and whenever; needs to 
be coordinated.  This CA legislative process (next 2.5 weeks) may be a 
possibility.  FERC Investigation.  Taking the story nationally is good if we 
have the facts from CA.

Who will deliver the message?  My answer - Everyone on the Enron team needs 
to have the same message all of the time.  We can't let any opportunity pass 
us by.

Do we demonize the utilities?  My answer - if necessary; we just need to make 
sure that we have as many facts to prove our points if we do attack.

How do we prove that "rolling back" to regulation is ridiculous?  My answer - 
retain LEGC to develop the hypothetical of what would have happened?  NEEDS 
TO BE DISCUSSED INTERNALLY - LEGC MAY NOT BE THAT FRIENDLY.

Next Steps:  Jeff Dasovich needs to put out first cut based on our earlier 
notes and any incremental information from our analysis teams (e.g., TCA, 
McNally / Temple). 

Thanks,

Jim

Subject: Talking Points re "reregulation" in California

Peter, attached are three documents that Steve Kean said could be used for 
external communication concerning the California Power Issue. The first one 
is talking points from Jeannie Mandelker, following that is Steve's message 
to the Executive Committee, and the final attachment, at the bottom of the 
page, are talking points from Jeff Dasovich.

Let me know if you need further information.

Subject: Talking Points re "reregulation" in California

As I promised this morning at the executive committee meeting, below are some 
talking points for your use.

Overall message:  the market is working, regulation is not.

In California, peak demand rose by 10% over the last 4 years while new 
capacity grew by only 2%.  But, as you would expect, the market responded by 
proposing 8,000MW of new generation - - more than enough to offset the peak 
demand growth.  The regulatory process, at both the state and local level, 
has failed to site this new generation.  The problem is regulation, not 
deregulation.

When San Diego customers began experiencing the effects of higher prices, 
Enron responded with a fixed price which would have shielded San Diego 
customers from price volatility and provided prices below their current 
summer levels (Enron's price was about $55/MWH).  After publication of 
Enron's offer, nine other companies made offers.  Again, the market responded 
where regulation failed.  San Diego has not accepted any of these offers 
because of regulatory/legislative restrictions on its ability to buy outside 
of the PX (i.e. the spot market).

In markets where siting is easier, suppliers have moved to build additional 
generation.  Enron built 3 plants in response to the 1998 price spikes.  
Those plants were planned, sited and built in less that 12 months - - in time 
for the summer of 1999.  Where regulatory hurdles are lower, the market 
responds.

The solution to current pricing and reliability issues is more competition 
not reregulation.  Policy makers should:

Open the transmission grid so that power can get from where it is to where it 
is needed.

Expedite interconnection of new generation.

Expedite siting of new facilities.

Give customers a choice, so that they have better access to demand side 
solutions.


Also attached is a more detailed discussion of California, prepared by Jeff 
Dasovich of our San Francisco office.

Sarah --

Can you please set up a call to discuss the following?

1. EPSA / FERC Meeting.

The Aug 24 FERC meeting and Enron's participation?  I hope that you, Mary 
Hain and Jeff Dasovich will be able to attend.  This is pretty important and 
we need to make sure that we have the issues outlined well.

2. CA meeting with Scott Miller.

Also, can we meet with Scott Miller while he is in California?  Do we need 
get on his schedule?  Messages we want delivered?  Can we find out who he is 
meeting with?

3. CA ISO Information.

Finally, we need more information from the CA ISO to handle the upcoming AG 
investigation.  Is Scott Miller getting information from the CA ISO that we 
can't get?  Mary, what information is public and what is confidential.  I was 
wondering if we needed to ask FERC to order more information into the public 
domain to undertake the investigation.  The AG will be getting the 
information, so why not get it first?  Also, why not leverage this 
investigation into asking for more information from the CA ISO (including the 
list Jeff D. put together earlier)?

Subject: EPSA Marketer Conf. Call

1.  EPSA/Boston Pacific Statistical Analysis 

Boston Pacific plans to be done with the analysis by second week in September.

EPSA proposes holding a call next Friday (Aug. 25) afternoon with Craig Roach 
to discuss Craig's approach for the analysis.

2.  California 

Scott Miller (FERC) is in California now meeting with people -- pressure on 
FERC continues to be increased

Discussed proposed rate freeze

3.  FERC Investigation (see today's Energy Daily Article)  -- Concern that 
FERC is under pressure to do something -- shots being taken at FERC and Scott 
Miller to do more than just visit California with FERC auditors

two meetings next week Aug. 23 and Aug. 24 -- generators in on Aug. 23, 
marketers on Aug. 24 -- to discuss California
FERC will have additional meetings on other areas of country later
EPSA plans to have a working lunch on Thursday before the meeting at FERC -- 
meeting at FERC 2:00 - 4:00
 We need to confirm with EPSA if we're planning on attending
I suggested EPSA have a pre-meeting so that we have a united front
 EPSA will hold a conference call on Tuesday 11:00 am EDT with the entire 
group (both generators   and marketers) to work on our presentation, and then 
we may decide to begin meetings (as   necessary) on Wednesday (for 
generators) or Thursday (for marketers) morning prior to the FERC  meetings
Scott told Mark that there is pressure on his group to come up with their 
fact findings (at least on California) prior to November 1

4.  TPC Paper

EPSA asked if anyone has questions, has everyone gotten through the document.

PECO Power Team (new member) says this paper goes a step further than the 
EPSA paper -- while PECO is very comfortable with the EPSA paper, they are 
very uncomfortable with the TPC -- more strident and takes positions that 
PECO could not support
Dynegy person asks is this tying in with the coalitions working in the 
individual regional RTO negotiations.  Mark said no.  Julie says its not 
supposed to be responsive to one RTO proposal -- SPP, Midwest, etc.
Duke has not yet read the paper -- everyone decided to hold off discussions 
to the next call

5.  Elcon holding transmission customer meetings to plan for upcoming NERC 
meetings.  Charles Yeung is active in  this.

6.  Louisiana PSC Technical Conference

EPSA cannot participate in this technical conference being held on August 29 
-- the EPSA summit is that day in Chicago

7.  No conference call next week --

DJ Calif PUC Unlikely To Order Refunds From Pwr Generators
Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.



(This article was originally published Thursday)


     LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--The California Public Utilities Commission 
likely won't order generators to refund billions of dollars in windfall 
profits from last summer's wholesale power price spikes to utilities and 
customers, commissioners told Dow Jones Newswires Thursday.

     A Republican commissioner said the PUC knows generators are manipulating 
the wholesale power market in California but the commission doesn't have the 
"expertise in-house to figure out who it is and how it's being done."

     "Even if we could force refunds, it would take five to 10 years in court 
to decide if generators should refund money," the commissioner said. "I don't 
think the state is willing to spend the money or the time."

     In addition, the commission is nowhere near deciding whether Edison 
International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison and PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit 
Pacific Gas & Electric can pass on a combined $5 billion in debt to their 
ratepayers, the commissioner said.

     A decision won't likely be made until mid-2001, the commissioner added.

     Only PUC President Loretta Lynch and Commissioner Carl Wood support 
having generators refund windfall profits to utilities and ratepayers. The 
commission's investigation, one of two ongoing probes into the state's 
troubled wholesale power market, has been unsuccessful in finding evidence 
that would force generators to refund billions of dollars, according to 
documents obtained Thursday by Dow Jones Newswires.

     Last week, federal regulators determined generators didn't manipulate 
the market. But they did find flaws in the state's market structure and said 
rates were "unjust and unreasonable."

     The state's Independent System Operator and Power Exchange have also 
concluded they have no evidence to prove generators manipulated the market in 
order to drive up wholesale power prices.

     The commissioner said the PUC doesn't support the utilities' efforts to 
pass on $5 billion in wholesale power costs to ratepayers.

     The commissioner said "if it came down to deciding tomorrow, the 
utilities would be left holding the bag."

     PG&E and SoCal Edison pay about 16 cents a kilowatt-hour for wholesale 
power. But the utilities charge their customers far less under a 
state-mandated rate freeze.

     As reported earlier Thursday, SoCal Edison President and Chief Executive 
Officer Stephen Frank said the utility's inability to immediately recover 
more than $2 billion in debt from its ratepayers may force the company to lay 
off employees and reduce major capital spending.

     PG&E filed a lawsuit in federal court Wednesday asking a judge to allow 
the utility to pass on $3 billion in debt to its customers.

Good article.  These consultants / academics work for the group we are 
talking to about writing a "what if no deregulation" piece for Enron and 
hopefully others.

They do not support the Davis/Alpert Bill (SDG&E Rate Freeze). (However, th=

This also seems to take some wind out of the Pescetti bill (Freeze Extensio=

This seems to be a political play. We do not believe that the republicans=

think that the Governor will actually declare a special session. The Alpert=

Rob & Karen --

John Jura is working on putting together some numbers to compare "hedging" 
versus "riding the market".  Initial difference looks pretty good.  When 
complete, we'll get these numbers to you.

Rob -- This info is great.  For use w/ the media, we'll need to simplify, and 
it would be helpful to have specific examples of what a utility would pay and 
the overall result of a market with price caps, the current "open" market 
(under ISO regulation, buying from the PX) and a pure open market (using 
hedges to manage risk).

Here is a one pager on the general problem of price regulation.  Next we will 
need to discuss the particular cases and identify specific distortions, which 
the field people will have to provide.

I hope it sets a framework from which the specifics of the price cap examples

F.Y.I.

                              
  California Lawmakers Vote to Limit Power Costs 
  By Rebecca Smith 
    
  09/01/2000 
  The Wall Street Journal 
  Page A4

  California lawmakers voted to extend modest relief to San Diego residents 
burdened with
  high electricity bills and set the groundwork for faster construction of 
badly needed power
  plants. They stopped short, however, of passing legislation that would roll 
back retail power
  rates to levels seen prior to deregulation .

  Late Wednesday, lawmakers sent a bill to Gov. Gray Davis that limits to 6.5 
cents per
  kilowatt hour the amount that small customers of San Diego Gas & Electric 
Co. can be
  charged. The utility is allowed to add power-delivery and other reasonable 
costs to that
  commodity price.

  The price, equivalent to a bulk power cost of $65 per megawatt hour, is far 
higher than the
  average price of power for 27 of the 31 months in which California's market 
has been
  deregulated. But in June and July, the average price of power obtained by 
the utility from a
  state-sanctioned energy auction rose to 12 cents and 10.5 cents, 
respectively, compared
  with the 2.3 cents and 2.8 cents charged in those months a year earlier.

  Passed directly through to customers,the resulting bills sparked a near 
mutiny. The
  rate-cap measure applies to residential and small commercial customers, as 
well as to
  schools and hospitals.

  In addition to the rate cap, which can be adjusted upward or downward by 
the California
  Public Utilities Commission until December 2002, the legislature earmarked 
$150 million of
  general-fund revenue, which can be used to subsidize San Diego power costs 
if they greatly
  exceed the 6.5-cents-per-kilowatt-hour rate. For now, the utility would be 
expected to make
  up any difference between revenue collected and the actual cost.

  Steve Baum, chairman of Sempra Energy, parent of San Diego Gas & Electric 
Co., said the
  rate-cap measure is "deeply flawed" because it limits the amount prices can 
rise but sets
  no floor. That means any shortfall could grow -- without a mechanism for 
customers to pay
  it down -- until the end of the rate-cap period, which could last until 
December 2002 or
  December 2003.

  Mr. Baum said Sempra stands to suffer an undercollection of perhaps $664 
million, provided
  future prices approximate the New York Mercantile Exchange forward prices 
through
  December 2002. "It's irreparably damaging to Sempra," he said because it 
"creates
  tremendous uncertainty" that makes it hard for the San Diego energy company 
to finance
  new projects such as a new transmission line.

  The legislature also appeared likely to approve a bill speeding up the 
permit process for the
  construction of new power plants, in part by beefing up staffs of 
regulatory agencies that
  review the plans.

Steve:

I have slightly revised the talking points to incorporate the concept of FERC 
jurisdiction over reliability and to note that there are procedural options 
for DOE and/or FERC  --  actions that can be taken immediately (DOE emergency 
authority) and longer-term solutions (the CRT or Petition for Rulemaking).

I agree that it is difficult to stomach the idea of supporting a rate cap and 
don't  believe we should.  However, a rate cap will not necessarily kill our 
value proposition in CA.  From a product standpoint, a rate cap will push us 
back to a "discount off of frozen tariff" product as we will be able to 
offfer some discount based on the shoulder months (assuming there are any 
left) and based on how long the rate cap lasts.  As you are aware, this is 
the most successful product we have had in CA.  and customers are comfortable 
with it.  If the caps last long enough, we can go past the rate freeze period 
and offer pretty good discounts.  Additionally, customers will probably want 
to see this product post rate freeze based on this summer.  Additionally, a 
rate cap will probably benefit our risk management folks through next summer.

Please don't misinterpret this message.  I believe we need to continue to 
oppose the caps.  In my opinion, this is the slippery slope of re-regulation 
that opens the door to massive uncertainty that we cannot hedge.  But, based 
on the current political climate, it appears that they are inevitable.  IF 
they occur, it is not the end of our ESP business.  As always, we continue to 
adapt to the political wrangling that seems to occur daily.

Please call me if you wish to discuss this further.  Thanks.

I have some questions and coments.

WHY DOES ENRON FEEL THE NEED TO FILE SEPARATELY? We can't we file with ARM?

WHY DO WE WANT THE DISCUSSION NARROWED TO SDG&E ONLY?  I can see pros and 
cons of each way.

I DO NOT SEE HOW WE CAN SUPPORT PRICE CAPS.....If we could not support them 
on the wholesale side, how can we support them on the retail side?  Doesn't 
it kill the ESP business?  Doesn't it eliminate any benefits of dereulation?  
If we support them, we are givibng in to the unjustified terrorism that is 
taking place in CA.  We don't even now whrer the monry is coming from.  What 
if they expect to get it from us.  Hey, can we sue -- we can't if we SUPPORT 
price caps.

WE MUST STICK WITH THE PRINCIPLES WE'VE FOUGHT FOR ALL THESE YEARS -- SOME 
THINGS ARE JUST  WORTH FIGHTNG FOR.
I recommend opposition of the price caps -- the resukt of the knee=jerk, 
weekly about -face by the CPUC which cannot possibly be considered to be 
reasoned decision making

Unless we receive comments by 9 a.m. p.d.t. Monday, August 14, this will be 
Enron's pre-hearing conference comments relative to the Investigation opened 
by the Commission.  These comments will be filed Monday.  Please make sure 
Bruno is copied on your comments.

NOTE:  

Rather than opposing a cap for small consumers, which I believe is imminent, 
I would prefer to advocate that it apply only to small consumers, under 20 
kW, and only for a limited period of time.  I would prefer to argue that the 
cap should not apply to larger consumers, who  already have access to market 
solutions to insulate them from market volatility.

PLEASE LET ME KNOW ASAP IF WE CANNOT SUPPORT THIS POSITION.

Dan, only one addition to PHC.  Will advise on filing.

Subject: Re: Talking Points re "reregulation" in California  

Steve, thanks for the helpful materials. However, if the experience in 
overseas deregulating electricity markets where price increases and spikes 
have occurred is any precedent, we will need to have some more down-to-earth 
responses to a some of the potentially inflammatory issues facing the 
politicians:
    1. When the prices spike, who reaps the windfall? Who sells that most 
expensive 1% of the kwh? Is it a careful planner or a lucky speculator or 
market manipulator? Someone is making a bunch of money off the screwed up 
system. Who is it, and why is that OK?
    2. We do not allow people to inflate water prices to consumers in times 
of drought, or food prices in times of hurricanes or floods. Even gasoline 
price increases in periods of high demand are within 20%-30% of the base, not 
2,5,10 or 100 times the average like spot electric prices. The issue isn't 
whether the system is broken or not or how bad partial regulation is or how 
much demand has increased versus supply. Thes will be seen as "ivory tower" 
discussions. The populist political issue is, until the problem is fixed, why 
should some shrewd big electric company or middleman be allowed to profit off 
the misfortune of consumers who did not cause the problem? Why should anyone 
be allowed to profiteer by selling at multiples above their generation cost?
    3. The hedges, fixed price contracts and other de facto insurance against 
volatility that Enron or others offer could be seen as a symptom of the 
problem rather than the solution.  Enron could be seen as at best a band aid 
and at worst an opportunist made possible only by a broken system - - -sort 
of like the guys who ran the old style protection rackets, or Colombian 
"security consultants" who "guard " pipelines from the threats their guerilla 
afiliates create, or  political risk insurance that you shouldn't really need 
if the host country wasn't so screwed up. Don't worry about high crime in 
your neighborhood -  - - just hire an off-duty policeman.   Who needed these 
new electricity risk management products in the old days before deregulation? 

    We have to be able to answer these types of questions at the level of the 
ordinary citizen, not merely have the correct long-term competitive market 
solution, or the forces of ignorance and re-regulation will gain momentum. 
Are we sure we shouldn't back a temporary peak hour price cap  until the 
regulatory problems we're all familiar with are worked out, to avoid a much 
worse long term rollback?. - - -DLH

Subject: Talking Points re "reregulation" in California

As I promised this morning at the executive committee meeting, below are some 
talking points for your use.

Overall message:  the market is working, regulation is not.

In California, peak demand rose by 10% over the last 4 years while new 
capacity grew by only 2%.  But, as you would expect, the market responded by 
proposing 8,000MW of new generation - - more than enough to offset the peak 
demand growth.  The regulatory process, at both the state and local level, 
has failed to site this new generation.  The problem is regulation, not 
deregulation.

When San Diego customers began experiencing the effects of higher prices, 
Enron responded with a fixed price which would have shielded San Diego 
customers from price volatility and provided prices below their current 
summer levels (Enron's price was about $55/MWH).  After publication of 
Enron's offer, nine other companies made offers.  Again, the market responded 
where regulation failed.  San Diego has not accepted any of these offers 
because of regulatory/legislative restrictions on its ability to buy outside 
of the PX (i.e. the spot market).

In markets where siting is easier, suppliers have moved to build additional 
generation.  Enron built 3 plants in response to the 1998 price spikes.  
Those plants were planned, sited and built in less that 12 months - - in time 
for the summer of 1999.  Where regulatory hurdles are lower, the market 
responds.

The solution to current pricing and reliability issues is more competition 
not reregulation.  Policy makers should:

Open the transmission grid so that power can get from where it is to where it 
is needed.

Expedite interconnection of new generation.

Expedite siting of new facilities.

Give customers a choice, so that they have better access to demand side 
solutions.


Also attached is a more detailed discussion of California, prepared by Jeff 
Dasovich of our San Francisco office.

Mona,  Although the option provision with true-up is better than a rate cap 
but I fear this will lead to more confusion in the market place, a price that 
may be below market today which will foster the do nothing attitude.  I fear 
that customers given a choice will take the I will pay you later Vs paying 
you now approach.  The administrative issues this creates are also 
tremendous.  I would rather give on the residential option for the commission 
to extend another year vs agreeing to the opt in provision.

Subject: Draft Legislative Language


	

We have seen an early release of legislative language.  It is SB 1433 
Alpert/Davis.

1.  It institutes a rate cap of 6.5 cents/kWh for residential and small 
commercial retroactive to June 2000 through December 31, 2002.  It leaves the 
ability for the Commission to extend to 2003 if in the public interest.  (We 
will strike the last part.)

Small commercial customers are all accounts on Schedule A, all accounts who 
are general acute care hospitals, public and private k-12 schools and all 
accounts on AL-TOU (up through 6000 kWh/billing period)

2.  Provides an opt-in provision for large commercial/agricultural/industrial 
customers with an annual true-up.

The sense I got was that CMTA/CLECA may have asked for this.  It gives 
legislative cover.  Will be difficult to administer and the true-up will 
discourage sign up. 

Please let me know if you agree.

3.  Provides that overcollections of PPA/QFs/SONGs will be used to offset 
undercollections of cap.

Our comment is that the overcollections, on a pro-rata basis will be used to 
offset the cap.  All customers pay stranded costs associated with those 
contracts, all customers should receive stranded benefits.

4.  SDG&E is still subject to reasonableness review by the Commission.  To 
the extent FERC orders refunds as part of its investigation, such refunds 
will go to SDG&E's customers.

Not too bad.

The commission just passed on a 3/2 vote the Duque position.  Duque was the 
plan where "approximately 70% of all residential customers who consume 500 
kWh or less will pay no more than $68 per month for electricity."  "The plan 
will alsoensure that the approximately 70% of all commerical customers who 
consume 1,500 kWh or less will pay no more than $220 per month."

Commissioner Lynch fears that the Duque plan will be tied up in legal 
disputes rather than provide rate relief to the consumers.
