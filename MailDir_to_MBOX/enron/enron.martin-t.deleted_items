Hi Jeff,
 
Becky said she faxed a request for the Klein High pool and followed up with a phone call.  She was given no indication that someone else had already put in a request and our request was already on the coach's desk.  The school did indicate that pool fees are going up Jan 1, 2002.  I'm sure that will show up on the contract they send us.  They will send the contract to Becky Miller (Oak Creek Village) and she will call me when she receives it.  See you at the pool!

HOUSTON -- Kenneth L. Lay was ousted Wednesday from Enron Corp., the Housto=
n company that he spent 15 years building into the world's largest energy t=
rader only to watch it crumble amid allegations of financial trickery.=20
Enron announced it is beginning a search for a turnaround specialist to sav=
e what is left of what was once the nation's seventh-largest company, but w=
hich now holds the dubious distinction of having filed the largest-ever ban=
kruptcy petition.
Lay said his decision to resign as chairman and chief executive was reached=
 in cooperation with Enron's board and the 15-member creditors' committee s=
elected as part of Enron's bankruptcy proceedings. Enron filed for bankrupt=
cy protection Dec. 2, listing more than $50 billion in assets and more than=
 $31 billion in debts.=20
The bank-dominated creditors' committee had been pushing for Lay's resignat=
ion so that new managers could oversee Enron's attempt to reorganize and re=
pay the money it owes, sources familiar with the situation said. The decisi=
on was reached Wednesday morning during a board meeting with Enron's far-fl=
ung directors checking in by telephone.=20
"The creditors just want a green-eyeshade guy who gets their money back for=
 them," one source said.=20
Lay will remain a director of the company.=20
"I want to see Enron survive, and for that to happen we need someone at the=
 helm who can focus 100% of his efforts on reorganizing the company and pre=
serving value for our creditors and hard-working employees," Lay said in a =
statement. "Unfortunately, with the multiple inquiries and investigations t=
hat currently require much of my time, it is becoming increasingly difficul=
t to concentrate fully on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders."=
=20
Lay, 59, has been named in more than 50 lawsuits, and his company's disinte=
gration is being investigated by several congressional committees, the Just=
ice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission.=20
That Lay was tossed out comes as less of a surprise than the leisurely time=
 it took to do it, Enron watchers said.=20
Lay held on as a series of damaging financial disclosures about murky off-b=
alance-sheet partnerships and overstated earnings hammered Enron's stock pr=
ice, wiping out billions of dollars of investor holdings and the retirement=
 savings of Enron employees.=20
Lay survived a failed last-ditch merger attempt with cross-town rival Dyneg=
y Inc., which fled claiming that it hadn't realized the depths of Enron's t=
roubles. He lasted as Enron's debt plunged to junk status and lenders turne=
d their backs, causing an all but fatal cash crunch that pushed Enron into =
bankruptcy.=20
But the heat rose in the last few weeks with revelations that Lay and other=
 Enron executives contacted Bush administration officials late last year se=
eking help for the flailing company, that Lay was touting the stock to empl=
oyees and urging them to buy shortly before Enron announced its worst quart=
er in corporate history, that Lay was warned in August by a company vice pr=
esident of a possible corporate implosion if details of the off-balance-she=
et transactions became known and that documents were shredded by Enron empl=
oyees and those of its auditor, Andersen.=20
"For whatever value remains in Enron to be realized, Lay's resignation was =
necessary," said Edward Muller, an investor in energy ventures and former p=
resident of Irvine-based Edison Mission Energy. It was necessary because "L=
ay's presence, with an obvious personal interest, stood in the way of decis=
ions being made to realize value for creditors and move the organization fo=
rward."=20
Prudential Securities analyst Carol Coale said the decision comes too late =
and is likely to play poorly on Wall Street.=20
"When Wall Street was calling for Ken Lay's head, it was early in the game,=
" said Coale, who is based in Houston and has followed Enron closely. "Wall=
 Street thought that would be the responsible thing for the board to do. Bu=
t at this point, it makes him look guilty."=20
"I don't think the market's going to react favorably to that," she said, no=
ting that the company's stock took a steep plunge when CEO Jeffrey Skilling=
 resigned abruptly in August. Enron, which little more than a year ago trad=
ed at nearly $90 a share on the New York Stock Exchange, closed Wednesday a=
t 34 cents in over-the-counter trading, down 9.5 cents. Lay's resignation w=
as announced after markets closed.=20
The reaction from Enron employees, current and former, was bitter.=20
"It was bound to happen," said Maritta Mullet, a former 10-year employee wh=
o lost nearly half a million dollars in would-be retirement benefits. "I'm =
surprised he's been able to face up to all these people and stay in there s=
o long.=20
"I feel terribly betrayed by him," added Mullet, who said Lay was "blushing=
 over with how good everything looked" in a September online chat with empl=
oyees.=20
That enthusiasm cost her and others dearly.=20
Rumors had swirled in recent days that a new management team was about to b=
e named, perhaps to be led by Jeffrey McMahon, Enron executive vice preside=
nt and chief financial officer. McMahon was named to those posts in late Oc=
tober, replacing Andrew Fastow, who helped engineer the off-balance-sheet p=
artnerships that greased Enron's slide into bankruptcy.=20
McMahon was treasurer in 2000 and reportedly objected to the conflicts of i=
nterest caused by Fastow's twin roles as Enron chief financial officer and =
manager of two of the partnerships. McMahon then moved to a small Enron sub=
sidiary but was brought back in a futile attempt to calm investors.=20
With Lay's departure, McMahon would be the only remaining member of Enron's=
 three-person office of the chairman. The third member, Enron President Law=
rence Greg Whalley, is leaving Enron to run the trading operation that Enro=
n is selling to UBS Warberg in a noncash profit-sharing deal.=20
Enron officials have touted the pending sale of the company's trading opera=
tion to UBS as the beginning of a new future. The deal was blessed by the U=
.S. Bankruptcy Court on Friday, and UBS has already extended job offers to =
640 Enron employees.=20
Still, if Enron management believes the company can move forward more smoot=
hly and reorganize without Lay, Mullet and others are doubtful.=20
"I didn't think the company could survive with him staying. But I don't thi=
nk the company can survive either way," she said. "I don't see what's left.=
"=20
"It's about time," said one former Enron vice president who spent four year=
s at the company. "I think he's entirely culpable. He knew what was going o=
n. He was responsible. He was captain of the ship."=20
The former vice president, who asked not to be named, said the board of dir=
ectors has been passive and should have acted sooner.=20
"I was wondering when they were going to get around to it. I've been shocke=
d that the [Bankruptcy] Court allowed the same management to stay in place.=
 It seems like the shredded documents were the last straw."=20
One current Enron finance executive said, "Good. Now they can start cleanin=
g house. He's a great guy, but he fell asleep at the wheel a bit. There has=
 to be someone taking some responsibility here, and he's chairman."=20
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said he did not know what kind of retirement pa=
ckage Lay was being given, but noted that any agreement would have to be ap=
proved by the Bankruptcy Court.=20
Lay earned hundreds of millions of dollars at Enron, primarily through lucr=
ative stock options in recent years.=20
In 2000, Lay exercised options worth $123.4 million, according to Enron fil=
ings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. His base salary that year=
 was $1.3 million, and he was given a $7-million bonus.=20
At the end of 2000, Lay held 5.1 million options worth $257.5 million, and =
an additional 1.5 million options worth more than $100 million that were sc=
heduled to vest in coming years, according to the SEC documents.=20
However, the plunge in Enron's stock price probably renders any unexercised=
 options worthless.=20
Lay received a $3.6-million bonus in January 2001. The company has not rele=
ased figures relating to his 2001 salary and option grants.=20

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE CHAIRMAN
Enron Chief Quits Under Pressure And Calls Inquiries a Distraction
By JIM YARDLEY and JOHN SCHWARTZ

01/24/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 6
c. 2002 New York Times Company

HOUSTON, Jan. 23 -- Kenneth L. Lay resigned this evening as chairman and ch=
ief executive of the Enron Corporation under pressure from outside creditor=
s, nearly two months after his company filed for one of the largest bankrup=
tcies in the history of American business.=20
Mr. Lay, 59, suggested in a statement that he had decided to resign ''in co=
operation'' with the court-appointed creditors committee that is overseeing=
 the bankruptcy proceedings. He said the various federal inquiries into Enr=
on's collapse were too large a distraction as he tried to resuscitate the c=
ompany he has led since 1986.
''I want to see Enron survive, and for that to happen we need someone at th=
e helm who can focus 100 percent of his efforts on reorganizing the company=
 and preserving value for our creditors and hard-working employees,'' he sa=
id in a statement released by the company.=20
''Unfortunately,'' he added, ''with the multiple inquiries and investigatio=
ns that currently require much of my time, it is becoming increasingly diff=
icult to concentrate fully on what is most important to Enron's stakeholder=
s.''=20
Mr. Lay will remain on Enron's board. The creditors committee is searching =
for a specialist in reorganizing companies to join Enron and serve as actin=
g chief executive as soon as possible.=20
Thomas A. Roberts, a lawyer for Enron in New York, said that Mr. Lay had be=
en discussing the possibility of resigning since early December. Mr. Robert=
s said that a representative of the creditors committee had called him Tues=
day night. ''The creditors committee really thinks Ken should think about s=
tepping down as an officer and employee of the company,'' he said.=20
Mr. Roberts then called Mr. Lay at his home about 10 p.m. Tuesday. ''I pass=
ed that along and said, 'We probably need to think about this.' We talked a=
bout it awhile, and he said he was going to get something to eat and talked=
 with his wife,'' Mr. Roberts said.=20
The two men talked again the next morning; Mr. Lay said that he would conve=
ne a conference call among the directors later that morning. Mr. Roberts wa=
s included in that call.=20
During the call, Mr. Lay gave a synopsis. ''He said the time had come for h=
im to resign as an officer of the company so that somebody could get in the=
re and work on rebuilding it because his time was going to have to be dedic=
ated to all of these investigations that were taking place,'' Mr. Roberts s=
aid.=20
Mr. Roberts said that it was very important that Mr. Lay was staying on as =
a board member because ''he will continue to be available to advise the com=
pany.''=20
The resignation of Mr. Lay comes after a string of recent revelations that =
have raised questions about the conduct of Enron's top executives, includin=
g Mr. Lay himself. Disclosures by Congressional investigators have shown th=
at Mr. Lay helped create and oversee some of the financial arrangements tha=
t helped lead to Enron's collapse.=20
In August, he was warned in a private memorandum from a company vice presid=
ent that Enron's accounting practices could bring down the company.=20
Yet even as he was selling his own shares of Enron stock in September and O=
ctober, he was reassuring employees that the company would rebound and enco=
uraging them to buy. His lawyer has said Mr. Lay was selling not because of=
 lack of confidence in Enron but because he faced margin calls as investmen=
ts in his personal portfolio declined in value.=20
Mr. Lay will now face scrutiny for his role in Enron's collapse from federa=
l investigators and Congressional committees. On the day he resigned, the c=
ompany that he had once helped develop into the nation's largest energy tra=
der was instead a half-empty tower in which two floors were secured by fede=
ral agents.=20
A White House spokeswoman, Jeanie Mamo, said, ''This doesn't change the pre=
sident's focus, which is on the ongoing criminal investigation and on the p=
olicy reviews to protect people's pensions.''=20
Mr. Lay had been a popular leader as Enron grew the last 15 years into an e=
nergy giant that he transformed, Cinderella style, from an unglamorous gas =
pipeline company. He was considered by peers as a man of big ideas, a crusa=
der for free markets and a risk taker in the Texas wildcatter tradition. Bu=
t while he was busy befriending the nation's most powerful politicians, ere=
cting one of the tallest buildings in Houston and pledging $100 million to =
put Enron's logo on the city's new ballpark, the little things were turning=
 out to be Mr. Lay's big problems.=20
One after another, disclosures spilled out of his company in recent months:=
 off-balance-sheet partnerships had hidden billions in debt; years of Enron=
's reported profits had been exaggerated. The stock price, once at more tha=
n $90 a share, tumbled to less than a dollar. A flood of lawsuits resulted =
as retirement systems, shareholders, former employees and others said that =
Enron's failure to disclose its accounting flaws amounted to a violation.=
=20
''He fell on his sword,'' said John Olson, an energy industry analyst here =
who was a lone skeptic about Enron when the company was flying high. ''It w=
as probably the right thing to do. Given the climate of opinion in Houston,=
 and where the company is in attempted recovery, this is probably in the be=
st interests of everybody.''=20
Mr. Lay hoped at first that he could avoid filing for bankruptcy when he en=
tered into merger talks with Dynegy, his Houston rival. But that deal fell =
apart, spawning more lawsuits and hard feelings, and leaving Enron with lit=
tle choice but to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. On Dec. 3, the company la=
id off more than 4,000 workers and was vilified in the hometown where he wa=
s once thought to be a mayoral candidate.=20
There is no question that Enron employees did benefit over the years when t=
he stock price soared, as did Mr. Lay. He has collected more than $300 mill=
ion since 1989, mostly through exercising stock options.=20
In Texas, he was first known as a friend and supporter of former President =
George Bush. But when George W. Bush ran for president in 2000, Mr. Lay gai=
ned a national reputation as one of the ''pioneers,'' the top fund-raisers =
who gave more than $100,000 to Mr. Bush's presidential campaign. In all, En=
ron along with Mr. Lay have given more than $600,000 to Mr. Bush's politica=
l campaigns dating back to his first failed run for Congress in West Texas.=
=20
Enron did not limit its contributions to Mr. Bush. The company has made don=
ations to nearly two-thirds of the members of Congress and much of the Repu=
blican establishment in Texas.

Enron's Lay Resigns as Chairman, CEO --- Panel Appointed by Court Had Reque=
sted Change; Interim Chief Is Sought
By Mitchell Pacelle and Rebecca Smith
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

Kenneth L. Lay resigned as chairman and chief executive of Enron Corp., the=
 company announced last night, less than 24 hours after the court-appointed=
 creditors committee requested his removal.=20
The beleaguered company and the creditors committee are now searching for a=
 chief restructuring officer to also serve as interim chief executive, the =
company said. The company has launched a separate search for a new chairman=
.
The committee, which consists of 15 Enron creditors, had contacted the comp=
any's lawyers at about 9 p.m. Tuesday to request Mr. Lay's resignation and =
the appointment of a restructuring officer to take over running the company=
, according to Thomas Roberts of Weil Gotshal & Manges, counsel to Enron. M=
r. Roberts said he relayed the request to Mr. Lay, who offered his resignat=
ion to Enron's board at a meeting late yesterday morning. Mr. Lay will rema=
in on Enron's board.=20
"I want to see Enron survive, and for that to happen we need someone at the=
 helm who can focus 100%" on the reorganization, Mr. Lay said in a prepared=
 statement. "Unfortunately, with the multiple inquiries and investigations =
that currently require much of my time, it is becoming increasingly difficu=
lt to concentrate fully on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders."=
=20
In recent weeks, Mr. Lay worked tirelessly to find some way to end the cris=
is that drove into bankruptcy the company he built. Beginning in 1985, Mr. =
Lay took a second-tier gas-pipeline company, formed through the merger of H=
ouston Natural Gas and InterNorth Inc., and forged it into the nation's big=
gest energy trader. Enron became a tireless proselytizer for deregulation a=
nd competitive markets, reflecting Mr. Lay's belief in open markets honed a=
s a Ph.D. economist at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and a colle=
ge economics professor.=20
The company is already talking to a couple of people about the chief-execut=
ive position, and has drawn up a lengthier list of people to approach about=
 the chairman position, according to someone familiar with the process.=20
While a final decision about Mr. Lay's fate rested with Enron's board, the =
position of the creditors committee carries considerable weight in the bank=
ruptcy process. Under bankruptcy law, after a company files for Chapter 11 =
bankruptcy-court protection, as Enron did Dec. 2, the fiduciary responsibil=
ity of its board expands from shareholders to include all creditors.=20
Mr. Roberts said Mr. Lay had been considering resigning "off and on" since =
before Christmas.=20
Mr. Lay had stepped down as chief executive in January 2001, only to return=
 to the job after his successor, Jeffrey K. Skilling, abruptly resigned in =
August as the company's stock was falling. Mr. Lay also agreed to step down=
 if Dynegy Inc. had completed its proposed acquisition of Enron, which unra=
veled as Enron's problems mounted in November.=20
In the wake of damaging allegations about the destruction of Enron-related =
documents, and reports of Mr. Lay's sales of tens of millions of dollars of=
 Enron stock in the past year as the company's condition deteriorated, ther=
e was a growing sense on the creditors committee that he wasn't the best ma=
n to run the company as it tries to maximize recoveries to creditors, accor=
ding to people familiar with the committee's deliberations.=20
Many creditors are worried that Enron's assets may be worth far less than t=
hey initially had hoped, meaning creditors are likely to receive far less t=
han the billions of dollars they are owed.=20
In response to criticism, Mr. Lay has indicated he wasn't fully aware of th=
e details of the controversial partnerships whose disclosure led to major f=
inancial losses and, even worse, to a loss in investor confidence in Enron.=
 But Mr. Lay was present at board meetings where some of the partnerships w=
ere approved and where a waiver of the company's conflict-of-interest polic=
y was discussed to enable former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow to r=
un them.=20
As the partnerships came under public scrutiny, Mr. Lay defended them in in=
terviews, saying the transactions were fully vetted and approved by the boa=
rd and had been done to benefit Enron.=20
Given controversy swirling around Mr. Lay and other top Enron executives, i=
t is hardly surprising that creditors would question his future.=20
There is ample precedent for the forced departure of top executives of comp=
anies that have filed for bankruptcy. In November, Linda Wachner, longtime =
head of Warnaco Group Inc., was replaced as chief executive officer by a tu=
rnaround expert after she lost the support of creditors in bankruptcy proce=
edings.=20
If a company's board doesn't accede to the wishes of the creditors committe=
e, bankruptcy law gives creditors further leverage to force a company's han=
d.=20
Creditors can file a motion asking the court to appoint a trustee to run th=
e company, supplanting the top executive and the board. To gain such relief=
, creditors must prove gross mismanagement or fraud by current management.

Ken Lay resigned Wednesday as chairman and chief executive officer of Enron=
 at the request of the committee representing the company's creditors.=20
"I want to see Enron survive, and for that to happen we need someone at the=
 helm who can focus 100 percent of his efforts reorganizing the company and=
 preserving value for our creditors and hard-working employees," Lay, 59, s=
aid in a statement released Wednesday night. "Unfortunately, with the multi=
ple inquiries and investigations that currently require much of my time, it=
 is becoming increasingly difficult to concentrate on what is most importan=
t to Enron's stakeholders."=20
The committee representing creditors in Enron's bankruptcy told Lay Tuesday=
 night he had become a distraction and must step aside because of the many =
allegations being leveled at the company, a source close to Enron said Wedn=
esday night.=20
Lay, who will stay on the board of directors, oversaw the company's growth =
from a staid pipeline business into an energy powerhouse that dealt in natu=
ral gas, electricity and other commodities.=20
After a decline that began early this year, the company finally collapsed i=
n October amid charges it had improperly inflated revenues and concealed de=
bt by using questionable accounting techniques. Thousands of employees were=
 put out of jobs and still more lost their retirement savings.=20
Thomas A. Roberts, a corporate lawyer helping oversee Enron's reorganizatio=
n, said Lay had been considering stepping down since before Christmas.=20
Lay couldn't be reached for comment.=20
He is scheduled to testify Feb. 4 before the Senate Commerce Committee. Enr=
on spokesman Mark Palmer said he did not think Lay has changed plans to do =
so.=20
Palmer said he was unsure whether Lay would be receiving any severance.=20
The creditors committee apparently didn't object to Lay remaining on the bo=
ard of directors, who Palmer said had asked Lay to stay on to help with the=
 restructuring. Lawyers representing the creditors committee couldn't be re=
ached Wednesday night.=20
The board and creditors committee are in the process of selecting a "restru=
cturing specialist" to serve as acting chief executive officer. The board, =
itself the target of lawsuits, will soon select a new chairman.=20
Lay notified remaining Enron employees of his resignation in an e-mail sent=
 Wednesday night. He told them he was proud of what Enron and its employees=
 had accomplished over the years and praised them for the help they had giv=
en to other employees and their communities.=20
In Washington, U.S. Rep. Ken Bentsen, D-Houston, said Lay's announcement wa=
s "no great surprise when you consider the fact that he had lorded over a c=
ompany that collapsed as a result of what appears to be great mismanagement=
, if not fraud."=20
"I don't think he had any other choice but to step aside," he said, adding =
that he doesn't expect Enron to be resurrected.=20
"I've been highly skeptical of whether we would ever see Enron rise again,"=
 Bentsen said. "The chairman and CEO (Lay) ultimately has to take responsib=
ility for that."=20
House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Sugar Land, said he is focused on finding =
out what happened at Enron.=20
"It's been a very hard time for too many Houstonians," he said. "This doesn=
't change that fact, nor the fact that we still need answers."=20

ture. Andersen was the accounting firm for Enron before the collapse.=20

Kenneth L. Lay resigned yesterday as chairman and chief executive of Enron =
Corp., caught between unrelenting pressures from the energy company's credi=
tors and a circle of federal and congressional investigators pursuing the r=
easons for Enron's collapse late last year.=20
Lay, 59, who founded the Houston company in 1986 and presided over its surg=
ing growth as an energy trader in the late 1990s, submitted his resignation=
 around noon in a conference phone call with the company's board of directo=
rs. He will remain on the board.
His resignation, on the eve of two congressional hearings, had been sought =
by a committee of major creditors who hold veto power over Enron's Chapter =
11 bankruptcy reorganization. "You work for the creditors. The creditors wa=
nted someone else," said one Enron official.=20
Lay's departure came a day after FBI agents moved into Enron's headquarters=
 tower to investigate charges of widespread shredding of corporate document=
s after government investigations of Enron had begun. Agents said they foun=
d a trash can containing shredded material and sealed off the area. Documen=
t destruction at Enron and its outside auditing firm, Arthur Andersen, will=
 be a key focus of today's Capitol Hill hearings.=20
Yesterday, people familiar with an investigation into shredding of Enron-re=
lated documents at Andersen's Houston office said scores of employees were =
involved. Ken Johnson, spokesman for the House Energy and Commerce Committe=
e, said it was "many" people, not just a few. Others familiar with the situ=
ation say all those involved were on Enron's audit team in the Houston offi=
ce, or were technical employees directed by the Enron team.=20
A friend and major political backer of President Bush, Lay formed Enron by =
combining two natural gas pipeline companies and transformed it into a powe=
rful supplier of gas and electricity. In the 1990s it created a vast, compl=
ex energy and commodity trading operation marked by increasingly elaborate =
outside partnership structures that are a central focus of the Enron invest=
igations.=20
Lay is scheduled to make the first appearance by a senior Enron executive b=
efore congressional panels investigating his company's demise at a Senate h=
earing Feb. 4. He also is a lead defendant in lawsuits by Enron shareholder=
s and former employees. Their lawyers charge that Lay and other company exe=
cutives enriched themselves through sales of Enron stock while misleading i=
nvestors and employees about the company's rapidly deteriorating financial =
condition last year.=20
"I want to see Enron survive, and for that to happen, we need someone at th=
e helm who can focus 100 percent of his efforts on reorganizing the company=
 and preserving value for our creditors and hardworking employees," Lay sai=
d in a statement.=20
After filing the largest bankruptcy petition in U.S. history Dec. 2, Enron =
is trying to sell assets, settle its debts and survive as an energy produce=
r and distributor. Although the company laid off about 4,500 employees from=
 its headquarters staff, it has about 19,000 employees worldwide at energy,=
 pipeline and water supply installations, the company said.=20
"It was becoming increasingly difficult for Ken to concentrate fully on wha=
t is most important to Enron's stakeholder" -- the bankruptcy reorganizatio=
n, said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer.=20
"Ken had considered the possibility that he might want or need to step down=
 back before Christmas," said Enron's chief outside corporate lawyer, Thoma=
s A. Roberts of Weil, Gotshal & Manges. A representative of Enron's credito=
rs committee called Roberts on Tuesday to say that Lay should consider resi=
gning and after Roberts and Lay discussed it, Lay resigned.=20
Today's hearings are being conducted by the Senate Governmental Affairs Com=
mittee, which is looking into financial and regulatory issues surrounding E=
nron's collapse, and the oversight subcommittee of the House Energy and Com=
merce Committee, which is looking into alleged document destruction by Arth=
ur Andersen.=20
A White House spokeswoman, Jeanie Mamo, said the resignation does not chang=
e the president's focus. "It is on the criminal investigation, which will c=
ontinue, and on the policy reviews to protect people's pensions," she said.=
=20
Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Joseph I. Lieberman -- a pro-busine=
ss Democrat from Connecticut with an eye on his party's 2004 presidential n=
omination -- has summoned former Securities and Exchange Commission chairma=
n Arthur Levitt Jr. and other witnesses to testify about financial and regu=
latory issues.=20
Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin, (R-La.) chairman of the House Energy and Commerce=
 Committee, said yesterday he had moved the investigatory hearing ahead of =
one planned by the full committee to examine Enron's financial activities a=
nd relationships because it was urgent "to get to the bottom of this."=20
"We cannot do our work if people are going to destroy documents," he said.=
=20
Andersen recently admitted that the company's audit team last October destr=
oyed thousands of documents and e-mails resulting from its audit of Enron a=
fter learning that the SEC was looking into Enron's accounting practices.=
=20
Rep. James C. Greenwood (R-Pa.), who chairs the subcommittee on oversight a=
nd investigations, said Andersen agreed late yesterday to provide a senior =
partner to answer questions about policies and procedures regarding documen=
ts. Andersen attorney Nancy Temple and Michael Odum, who was on the Anderse=
n team at Enron, will appear under subpoena.=20
Greenwood said they would be questioned about when they became aware that E=
nron or Andersen might face litigation or an SEC probe, and how this affect=
ed their handling of relevant documents.=20
David B. Duncan, who led Andersen's audit of Enron, has also been ordered t=
o appear. His attorneys have told the committee he probably will refuse to =
testify by invoking his right against self-incrimination. Duncan previously=
 spoke to committee investigators, but not under oath.=20
Lieberman has labeled the Enron story a "corporate scandal," and indicated =
he wants to use the hearings to explore the role of the SEC, the Department=
 of Energy and other oversight agencies.=20
Under Lay, Enron was a leading political advocate for natural gas and elect=
ricity deregulation, courting allies in Washington and state capitals with =
intensive lobbying and generous contributions. Enron made $1.9 million in p=
olitical contributions between 1999 and 2001, according to a campaign spend=
ing watchdog group, the majority of it to Republicans. Lay, other Enron exe=
cutives and the company itself contributed more than $220,000 to Bush's pre=
sidential campaign.=20
As Enron was unraveling last fall, Lay tried to win help from the Bush admi=
nistration, contacting Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans and Treasury Secr=
etary Paul H. O'Neill in October. The Cabinet officials said they turned do=
wn Lay's requests for assistance in holding off a pending downgrade of Enro=
n's credit rating -- a critical issue for the heavily indebted company.=20
Lieberman has avoided direct criticism of the White House's ties to Lay and=
 other Enron figures, saying he has seen no indication of illegal activity.=
 That caution, say political observers, reflects many Democrats' concerns a=
bout the risks of appearing overly partisan, especially if congressional in=
quiries turn up no evidence of White House wrongdoing.=20
The central question Lay faces now is what he knew about Enron's deteriorat=
ing financial condition last year. Lay and other top executives professed t=
hat the company's future was bright at a time when its foreign energy proje=
cts were losing money and a crucial Internet networking venture was failing=
.=20
In August, Enron Vice President Sherron Watkins warned Lay directly that th=
e company faced a threat of accounting scandals because of its use of outsi=
de partnerships and investment entities to conceal debts and exaggerate rev=
enue, she said. Enron asked another outside law firm, Vinson & Elkins, to i=
nvestigate the charges, but said nothing about Watkins's warning.=20
Two months later, Enron revealed the first of a worsening series of account=
ing violations and errors, the Securities and Exchange Commission launched =
an inquiry, and the company's final collapse began.=20
Thousands of Enron shareholders have lost retirement savings in Enron stock=
 and Lay has become a focus of their anger.=20
"I believe he cares very much for the jobs that have been lost and the pain=
 that's been done," Roberts said. "It's been extraordinarily difficult. He'=
s held up very well."=20
Like dozens of others in Congress serving on committees involved in the inv=
estigation, Lieberman has received political donations from accounting comp=
anies, including Andersen's political action committee. The New Democrat Ne=
twork, a campaign group he co-founded to support the election of centrist D=
emocrats, also has received $14,500 from the Andersen PAC and $15,000 from =
Enron's PAC since 1997, according to PoliticalMoneyLine, an independent mon=
itoring group.=20
As a Republican loyalist, Tauzin is expected to keep attention focused on t=
he corporate misdeeds of Enron and Andersen, and away from Enron's ties to =
the GOP. He has made clear he will not join Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif.)=
 in using the investigations to highlight the ties between President Bush, =
some of his top aides and Enron.=20
Waxman "is carrying on a very partisan fight and trying to make this into a=
 political deal," said Tauzin. "It isn't."=20
Over the years, campaign groups controlled by Tauzin have received large su=
ms from the accounting industry, including Andersen. But those who have fol=
lowed Tauzin's career say that won't necessarily affect how he proceeds.=20
Born in the tiny southern Louisiana town of Chackbay, he grew up in a popul=
ist political culture that often viewed big corporations with as much suspi=
cion as big government. He was elected to Congress in 1980 as a Democrat, a=
nd switched to the GOP in 1995.=20
On the powerful Energy and Commerce Committee, Tauzin developed close conne=
ctions to the telecommunications, energy and accounting industries. In the =
mid-1990s, for example, he worked for securities litigation reform that lim=
ited lawsuits against accounting firms. In 2000, he battled against a propo=
sal by the SEC's Levitt for far-reaching reforms of the accounting industry=
 that would have prevented firms from maintaining lucrative consulting cont=
racts with companies they audit. Andersen had such contracts with Enron.=20
But the same year, Tauzin led an aggressive investigation of the role of Fo=
rd Motor Co. and Firestone in accidents involving Ford Explorer vehicles. T=
hat resulted in legislation strengthening tire safety rules.=20
"Friend or foe, our committee is going to go after anyone who has done some=
thing wrong," said Tauzin. "I'm not interested in the political friendships=
. We're going to treat everyone the same."=20
Tauzin's investigators were the first to arrive at Enron headquarters in Ho=
uston to gather documents. Among the items they found was the Watkins lette=
r warning Lay of accounting problems.=20
Tauzin said yesterday he would keep an open mind on whether it might be nec=
essary to institute some of the changes in the accounting industry that Lev=
itt proposed -- and he opposed -- in 2000.=20
"If the regulatory balance is wrong today, then we need to rebalance it," h=
e said.=20
Sens. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) and Jon S. Corzine (D-N.J.), both membe=
rs of the Banking Committee, said yesterday that they are drafting legislat=
ion that would prevent accounting firms from offering both audit and consul=
ting services to the same client. Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) has said sh=
e will introduce similar legislation.=20

Loss booked as unit profit, memo claims=20
By MARY FLOOD and TOM FOWLER=20
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle=20
Jan. 24, 2002, 12:41AM
Enron reported a profit at its energy-services business last year by moving=
 the unit's huge losses onto the books of another corporate division, a for=
mer Enron employee says.=20
The allegations of questionable Enron accounting were made Aug. 28 by forme=
r Enron Energy Services employee Margaret Ceconi in a five-page memo to Cha=
irman Ken Lay and the board of directors slightly more than three weeks aft=
er she and others in her department were laid off.=20
Her allegations echo those made just a few days before by Sherron Smith Wat=
kins, Enron's director of corporate development, in a memo to Lay. But whil=
e Watkins criticized the accounting treatment of several peripheral off-the=
-books entities, Ceconi's e-mail zeroed in on a part of the company that ha=
d been ballyhooed as an important growth engine.=20
Ceconi, 41, now working at a Houston consulting firm, said she had been lur=
ed to Enron early in the year after spending four years at GE Capital in Da=
llas, where she was senior vice president, by promises of $800,000 to $1 mi=
llion in salary.=20
That, she said in her memo, was simply a "fraudulent" way to attract her an=
d others to Enron, and symptomatic of the widespread corporate dishonesty d=
isplayed in its accounting and other business practices.=20
"Lying was rewarded in the culture at Enron," she said. "Fraud is fraud. Bu=
t there was a kind of blind loyalty there."=20
At Enron Energy Services, or EES, actual losses of at least $500 million we=
re moved to another sector of Enron to make EES appear profitable, the memo=
 says.=20
Ceconi said the losses were hidden in Enron Wholesale Services, the company=
's highly profitable and well-established trading arm.=20
Mark Palmer, spokesman for Enron, would not discuss specifics in the memo, =
which he said was "obviously from a disgruntled employee."=20
Of the EES losses, he said, "these are serious allegations. They are the ki=
nd of allegations that should be made to government officials if she believ=
es that."=20
"Enron touted EES as deserving a premium value on Wall Street," said Carol =
Coale, an analyst with Prudential Securities Research. She and other analys=
ts said that hidden EES losses not only would have been seen as a material =
disclosure by investors before Enron declared bankruptcy, they could still =
be relevant.=20
"If it comes out that earnings are compromised with funky accounting at EES=
 that could affect the (bankruptcy) reorganization plan as it is right now.=
" Coale said some EES contracts are still seen as viable assets.=20
Ceconi, who has a degree in accounting, said she had asked the Securities a=
nd Exchange Commission questions about the practices while still at the com=
pany and, after being laid off, informed the agency of actual problems.=20
SEC spokeswoman Christi Harlin in Washington, D.C., said the agency cannot =
comment on whether it received a complaint or what was done.=20
Ceconi's e-mail is replete with the personal criticism of mid- and upper-le=
vel managers that might be expected from a disgruntled employee.=20
But her attorney, Demetrios Anaipakos, said she wrote it not out of anger b=
ut out of a sense of obligation to company management and federal regulator=
s.=20
"She had a good faith concern that Enron may have been violating various SE=
C rules and regulations and well as various accounting standards," Anaipako=
s said.=20
The e-mail is less specific about the accounting practices than Watkins' me=
mo, which also mentioned concern about "valuation issues" at EES, one of th=
ree surviving divisions at Enron.=20
Ceconi's says, "EES has knowingly misrepresented EES' earnings. This is com=
mon knowledge among all the EES employees, and is actually joked about. But=
 it should be taken seriously."=20
Ceconi, who was vice president at a Houston bank before going to Dallas, sa=
id in the memo that it was to "everyone's amazement" that EES, despite its =
huge losses, reported a profit in the second quarter of 2001.=20
A fellow employee at EES, asking not to be identified, confirmed Wednesday =
that the people who worked there could not understand how EES could report =
a profit, and that there were constant rumors that losses were being hidden=
.=20
Ceconi's e-mail began, "One can only surmise that the removal of (Chief Exe=
cutive) Jeff Skilling was an action taken by the board to correct the wrong=
doings of the various management teams at Enron. However, based on my exper=
ience at this company, I'm sure the board has only scratched the surface of=
 the impending problems that plague Enron at the moment. ... "=20
Noting problems in various Enron interests around the world, she said, "Obv=
iously the board has (its) hands full at the moment, ... Some would say the=
 house of cards (is) falling. You are potentially facing shareholder lawsui=
ts, employee lawsuits ... heat from the analysts and the newspapers."=20
EES was formed to help companies manage and reduce their energy costs. By s=
ecuring fixed prices through long-term contracts, EES helped customers main=
tain predictable supplies at stable costs. It also provided energy audits a=
nd helped companies improve their energy efficiency.=20
It made a breakthrough in 1997, when the Archdiocese of Chicago agreed to l=
et EES manage its energy needs by buying natural gas to heat 1,000 schools,=
 churches and other facilities.=20
The division didn't begin to report profits until late in 2000, but then re=
venues steadily improved. In the first quarter of 2001, it reported profits=
 of $40 million. In the second quarter, $60 million in profit was reported =
earned on more than $7 billion in contracts.=20
Ceconi said those profits were surprising given that many contracts had to =
be renegotiated to Enron's disadvantage. Many of the assumptions made by En=

Accounting for Enron: Congress Probes Shredding by Andersen --- Executives =
Are Subpoenaed To Testify Before Panel In House in Enron Case

WASHINGTON -- Enron Corp.'s chief auditor at Arthur Andersen LLP warned the=
 energy-trading giant against putting "misleading" information in a news re=
lease about third-quarter earnings last October, according to a memo that t=
he auditor wrote for his files.=20
But David Duncan's concerns were ignored, according to the memo, one of two=
 on the subject obtained by investigators for the House Energy and Commerce=
 Committee, which opens hearings on Enron and Andersen today.
The first memo of Mr. Duncan, who has since been fired, is dated the day be=
fore Enron's earnings announcement on Oct. 16. He writes that Enron's repre=
sentation "could potentially be misunderstood by investors."=20
Specifically, he warned that Enron's claim of $1.01 billion of "nonrecurrin=
g" charges falsely allowed the company to tell investors that it was "on tr=
ack" to meet strong earnings growth in 2002.=20
In an e-mail response to concerns raised by Mr. Duncan, a Chicago lawyer fo=
r Andersen, Nancy Temple, appeared to ignore the crux of his misgivings abo=
ut Enron's actions and, instead, suggested he make changes to his memo. Amo=
ng other things, she recommended that he delete her name from the memo sinc=
e it "increases the chances that I might be a witness, which I prefer to av=
oid."=20
Both the auditor and lawyer will appear today before a House Energy and Com=
merce subcommittee. The hearing was initially set to discuss document destr=
uction at Andersen, but aides to committee Chairman Billy Tauzin, a Louisia=
na Republican, said they expect that the newly obtained memos about the Enr=
on news release between Mr. Duncan and Ms. Temple will spark unanticipated =
questions.=20
The lawmaker who called the hearing, Oversight and Investigations Subcommit=
tee Chairman James Greenwood (R., Pa.), said 80 Andersen employees were ins=
tructed to destroy documents related to the auditor's work for Enron. He sa=
id he planned to ask Ms. Temple whether she was aware of document destructi=
on while visiting Houston in late October, a time that shredding was going =
on.=20
Meanwhile, Army Secretary Thomas E. White, a former Enron executive, disclo=
sed that he had spoken with former Enron colleagues on 30 occasions in the =
past seven months. He said he met with Enron President Lawrence "Greg" Whal=
ley on Oct. 4, weeks before the company began seeking government help to wa=
rd off bankruptcy. All of the contacts were "personal in nature" and involv=
ed conversations about "the general financial condition of Enron," he said,=
 but no one asked him to intercede on the corporation's behalf.=20
Three Andersen executives have been subpoenaed to testify about the matter =
today before the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, one of several =
congressional panels looking into the collapse of the Houston energy-tradin=
g concern.=20
Mr. Duncan will refuse to answer questions, citing his Fifth Amendment righ=
ts against potential self-incrimination, his lawyer said. The subcommittee =
plans to ask Mr. Duncan a single question as a formality and then excuse hi=
m, said one person familiar with the negotiations with House officials.=20
Once Mr. Duncan is dispatched, the star witness is likely to be Ms. Temple.=
 Mr. Duncan has cited an Oct. 12 e-mail reminder from her of the firm's doc=
ument-disposal-and-retention policy in explaining his actions. Rep. Greenwo=
od said she will be questioned about that e-mail as well as reports that sh=
e visited the Houston branch of Andersen in late October, after a Securitie=
s and Exchange Commission investigation of Enron had been announced.=20
Andersen Chief Executive Officer Joseph Berardino managed to avoid the emba=
rrassing spectacle of being subpoenaed to testify against his will, thanks =
to some late-night negotiations between his representatives and the House E=
nergy and Commerce Committee staff. Mr. Berardino's representatives agreed =
that he would testify in the near future and to send the company's managing=
 director of professional standards, Dorsey Baskin Jr., in his stead at the=
 hearing today.=20
The Senate Government Affairs Committee also opens its hearings on Enron to=
day with a much broader inquiry into systemic explanations for Enron's fail=
ure. Former SEC Commissioner Arthur Levitt is expected to discuss his unsuc=
cessful efforts to ban accounting firms from auditing companies with which =
they have consulting contracts. Andersen had lucrative consulting contracts=
 with Enron while auditing the company's books, a common practice in the in=
dustry, and Enron's accounting practices are at the center of investigation=
s into its collapse.=20
The disclosures from Army Secretary White came in a letter responding to qu=
estions from Democratic Rep. Henry A. Waxman of California, a chief adminis=
tration antagonist on Enron issues.=20
"Since joining the administration, no one has asked that I intercede with a=
nyone, in any way, for the benefit of Enron Corp. Further, I have not done =
so," Mr. White wrote to Mr. Waxman. He said his contacts with former collea=
gues were congratulatory in nature in June, after he took his new post, and=
 became sympathetic later as Enron's situation deteriorated in the fall.=20
Mr. White said he had two discussions about Enron's collapse with Defense S=
ecretary Donald Rumsfeld in early November and with Secretary of State Coli=
n Powell on Dec. 12. Both of those conversations were focused primarily on =
the concern of Mr. Rumsfeld and Mr. Powell about "my personal well-being. M=
y response in both cases was that I had suffered significant personal losse=
s, but that I would persevere," Mr. White said.=20
Mr. White offered limited details of his own significant financial losses i=
n Enron's collapse. Though he didn't say exactly how much he lost, Mr. Whit=
e said he was still in the process of divesting when Enron went into its do=
wnward spiral. Stock that was selling for $50 a share when Mr. White began =
selling in June was valued at $12.85 on Oct. 30, the date of his last sale,=
 of 86,709 shares. Mr. White also said the company has stopped paying him h=
is retirement benefits.=20
The army secretary reports one conversation with Kenneth Lay, on Sept. 10, =
that Mr. White said he initiated in order to wish Mr. Lay well in his new p=
ost as Enron's Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Lay resigned from his posts las=
t night.=20

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE OVERVIEW
WIDE EFFORT SEEN IN SHREDDING DATA ON ENRON'S AUDITS
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

01/24/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 5
c. 2002 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON, Jan. 23 -- Scores of people who worked at Arthur Andersen's Hou=
ston office were involved in the destruction of documents related to the En=
ron Corporation, the chairman of one of the Congressional subcommittees tha=
t will begin hearings Thursday on Enron's collapse said today.=20
The chairman, Representative James C. Greenwood, Republican of Pennsylvania=
, head of the House Energy and Commerce oversight subcommittee, said invest=
igators for the subcommittee had determined that document shredding was wid=
espread and that up to 80 people had received orders to destroy papers. He =
said it called into question Andersen's attempts to blame rogue employees f=
or the episode.
The hearings on Thursday will be Congress's first public exploration into t=
he Enron collapse, the largest corporate Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in Am=
erican history.=20
Tonight, Enron's chairman and chief executive, Kenneth L. Lay, announced hi=
s resignation, saying the many investigations into the company's collapse w=
ould require too much of his attention.=20
Last week, Andersen, one of the Big Five accounting firms, fired the lead p=
artner on the Enron account, David B. Duncan, saying he orchestrated widesp=
read document destruction shortly after learning of a government investigat=
ion into Enron's finances.=20
But Mr. Greenwood expressed skepticism about that account. ''Do you believe=
 that 80 Andersen employees were directed by Mr. Duncan to violate an expre=
ss provision of policy by Andersen in the face of yet another investigation=
, and none of them picked up the phone and called their superiors and said,=
 'This doesn't seem right'?'' he asked. ''The question we need to get to is=
, Were there instructions from above.''=20
Other people close to the investigation said they doubted that the number o=
f Andersen employees was as high as Mr. Greenwood's estimate, but they said=
 it was a much larger group than the company had suggested. Mr. Duncan is e=
xpected to appear under subpoena at the energy and commerce subcommittee he=
aring, but he plans to invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrim=
ination, his lawyer said today. Mr. Duncan, will ''rely on his Constitution=
al right not to testify'' unless he is given immunity, his lawyer, Robert G=
iuffra, told the committee in a letter today.=20
Also today, Congressional investigators made public a memo Mr. Duncan wrote=
 last October saying he expressed concerns about the way in which Enron was=
 about to disclose huge losses from controversial dealings that investigato=
rs believed played a significant role in the company's collapse. The disclo=
sure, he said, was misleading to investors and possibly illegal.=20
On Oct. 16, Enron disclosed that it lost $618 million during the third quar=
ter and that it would have to reduce its net worth by $1.2 billion, partly =
because of dealings with investment partnerships that had been headed by An=
drew S. Fastow, who was then the company's chief financial officer. At the =
time, the company said the losses were the result of one-time losses, leavi=
ng the impression that the company could weather the bad quarterly results.=
=20
But two days earlier, Mr. Duncan warned the company's chief accounting offi=
cer, Rick Causey, that the way the company planned to disclose the informat=
ion might be ''misconstrued or misunderstood by investors,'' according to a=
 memo Mr. Duncan wrote to his files on Oct. 15 that was made available to C=
ongressional investigators. However, the press release Enron issued the nex=
t day was ''essentially the original presentation,'' Mr. Duncan wrote.=20
Mr. Duncan said in his memo that he had warned Mr. Causey that the Securiti=
es and Exchange Commission initiates enforcement actions against companies =
that issue financial information that is ''materially misleading.'' He said=
 the company should rewrite its earnings report and bring in lawyers to ass=
ure that its statements were not false.=20
One week later, officials in Andersen's Houston office began to shred Enron=
-related documents on a massive scale, even though Enron had just disclosed=
 that the Securities and Exchange Commission had begun an investigation int=
o its finances. Andersen fired Mr. Duncan last week, saying he had ordered =
the destruction of the Enron papers.=20
An Andersen spokesman, Charlie Leonard, characterized Mr. Duncan's memo as =
routine and said it reflected internal debates about accounting issues that=
 occur between auditors and corporate executives. He added: ''It looks like=
 that with the exception of some inappropriate phrasing, Mr. Duncan was doi=
ng what he was supposed to.''=20
Tonight, an Andersen official repeated the firm's assertion that Mr. Duncan=
's actions, aided by other partners in the Houston office who were demoted =
or placed on leave last week, had not been sanctioned.=20
''The one glaring fact here is that David Duncan, with full knowledge of an=
 S.E.C. investigation, initiated a massive document destruction campaign,''=
 official said.=20
The hearings that begin on Thursday, which will eventually involve 10 diffe=
rent committees, could lead to changes in pension, tax, securities and acco=
unting laws, though many experts are skeptical how far lawmakers will go. P=
ast efforts to tighten laws in these areas, particularly auditing standards=
, have been beaten back by industry lobbying.=20
The fall of Enron has touched off a scramble in the capital to assign blame=
 and avoid the taint of the company's prodigious political donations.=20
Some Democrats in Congress see the Enron case as a windfall that could dent=
 President Bush's lofty public approval ratings. But many Democrats are als=
o vulnerable because the company spread its largess so widely and the accou=
nting and regulatory practices that led to Enron's collapse took place unde=
r Democratic and Republican administrations.=20
In the House, the Energy and Commerce subcommittee will cross-examine three=
 senior Arthur Andersen officials about why the firm destroyed Enron docume=
nts after learning about an S.E.C. investigation into the company's finance=
s.=20
Also, the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee will examine whether govern=
ment policies failed and what new legislation is needed. The first witness =
will be Arthur Levitt, the former S.E.C. chairman whose efforts to tighten =
auditing standards two years ago were derailed by opposition from Congress.=
=20
Separately, Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the ranking Democr=
at on the House Judiciary Committee, formally asked the Justice Department =
to appoint a special counsel to investigate Enron, arguing the case ''repre=
sents one of the largest corporate frauds in the nation's history'' and cit=
ing the large campaign donations Enron has provided to President Bush over =
the years and the large number of senior administration officials who worke=
d for or invested in the company.=20
A Justice Department official said that he had not seen Mr. Conyers's lette=
r and that officials were still proceeding with their criminal investigatio=
n.=20
Also today, the Senate Finance Committee asked Enron to turn over tax retur=
ns for the past 16 years, in a letter sent by the committee chairman, Max B=
aucus, Democrat of Montana, and the ranking Republican, Charles E. Grassley=
 of Iowa. Their request follows the disclosure in The New York Times last w=
eek that Enron used almost 900 subsidiaries in tax-haven countries and othe=
r techniques to pay no income taxes in four of the last five years.=20
In an interview, Mr. Greenwood said Mr. Duncan had sought immunity for his =
testimony but had been rebuffed. Justice Department officials are worried t=
hat grants of immunity made by Congress might hamper their criminal investi=
gation of Enron and Andersen.=20
Investigators had asked Andersen's chief executive, Joseph F. Berardino, to=
 appear, but Mr. Berardino said he would be willing to attend on a later da=
te. Instead, Dorsey Baskin, a senior technical expert at Andersen, will tes=
tify. Two other Andersen officials -- Michael C. Odom, a partner in Houston=
, and Nancy Temple, an in-house lawyer in Chicago -- are scheduled to testi=
fy.=20
While the House subcommittee hearing will focus on Andersen's document dest=
ruction, attention will turn later to the reasons for Enron's flawed accoun=
ting. In Mr. Duncan's memo, the auditor says Andersen had expressed serious=
 reservations about Enron's accounting, particularly the company's descript=
ion of large losses as ''nonrecurring,'' or one-time, charges.=20
Andersen had advised Enron that its use of the term ''could potentially be =
misunderstood by investors,'' Mr. Duncan's memo states. ''We pointed out th=
at such items are, more often than not, included in normal operating earnin=
gs in'' financial statements that are put together using generally accepted=
 accounting practices.=20
The next day -- the same day Enron disclosed the earnings press release tha=
t Mr. Duncan objected to -- Ms. Temple, who had been involved in discussing=
 the matter with Mr. Duncan, sent an e-mail message to Mr. Duncan and other=
s at the firm suggesting that language be deleted from the memo ''that migh=
t suggest we have concluded the release is misleading.''=20
A copy of the message showed that Ms. Temple appeared to be worried about p=
otential litigation on Enron's finances and she sought to remove her name f=
rom the list of people who received the document: ''If my name is mentioned=
 it increases the chances that I might be a witness, which I prefer to avoi=
d.''=20
Ms. Temple's lawyer did not return a telephone call for comment. Mr. Leonar=
d, the Andersen spokesman, said Ms. Temple was simply worried about waiving=
 attorney-client privilege. Her reference to not concluding that the press =
release is misleading reflects her understanding that auditors ''don't have=
 a right or responsibility to pass judgment on press releases,'' only forma=
l financial statements, he added.=20
Mr. Duncan, 42, has told investigators that he was only destroying document=
s in keeping with an Oct. 12 e-mail message from Ms. Temple that emphasized=
 that they follow a policy requiring some documents be destroyed. Mr. Dunca=
n has told investigators he stopped shredding after Ms. Temple ordered it h=
alted Nov. 9.=20
While Andersen officials have sought to blame Mr. Duncan and other employee=
s in Houston office for the destruction of the documents, investigators are=
 skeptical and want to probe why the firm waited more than two weeks after =
Enron disclosed the S.E.C. investigation to order the shredding stopped.=20
Mr. Greenwood said that in interviews with committee investigators, Mr. Dun=
can stated that on at least two occasions before Oct. 12, Ms. Temple asked =
him, ''How are you on compliance with the document-retention on Enron?''=20
''Did she really mean that,'' Mr. Greenwood asked, ''or did she mean, 'How =
are you doing on getting rid of the documents?'''

WASHINGTON -- A fired executive with Enron Corp.'s accounting firm, Anderse=
n, warned the energy trading company that some of its public statements mig=
ht mislead investors, a memo obtained Wednesday shows.=20
As Enron was preparing to make the first public disclosure of its financial=
 problems, David B. Duncan, the Andersen partner who oversaw the Enron acco=
unt, advised Enron that language in its news release "could be misconstrued=
 or misunderstood by investors," according to an Oct. 15 memo written by Du=
ncan.
Duncan is expected to be called to testify today at the first congressional=
 hearing to examine why Andersen destroyed thousands of documents related t=
o the Enron account. Andersen, claiming Duncan acted against orders in shre=
dding documents, fired him last week.=20
Duncan has contended that Andersen executives in Chicago were aware of Enro=
n's problems and that he was singled out as a scapegoat.=20
On Oct. 16, Enron reported a $1.2-billion charge against shareholder equity=
. In his memo a day earlier, which he prepared for his files and copied to =
Andersen attorney Nancy Temple, Duncan said he raised objections to Enron's=
 characterization of some of the charges as "non-recurring" in a company ne=
ws release. He noted that the Securities and Exchange Commission had been c=
racking down on companies that improperly used the term.=20
Temple wrote back and suggested that Duncan delete her name from the memo d=
ue to a concern that the reference to Andersen's legal department might be =
viewed as a waiver of attorney-client privilege.=20
"If my name is mentioned, it increases the chances that I might be a witnes=
s, which I prefer to avoid," Temple wrote on Oct. 16, according to a copy o=
f her e-mail.=20
Duncan, who was fired by Andersen for allegedly orchestrating the destructi=
on, has pointed to an "unusual" Oct. 12 e-mail from Temple, reminding emplo=
yees to abide by the company's policy for deleting old files.=20
Sources close to the Enron investigation say the new memos show that Anders=
en was concerned in mid-October about its own legal liability in the Enron =
scandal, including the possibility that Temple might later be called as a w=
itness.=20
But the company did not advise its workers to preserve Enron documents unti=
l Nov. 9, after it was subpoenaed by government investigators.=20
An Andersen spokesman called the memos standard and appropriate. He said Te=
mple didn't want a reference to her conversations with Duncan because they =
were covered by attorney-client privilege.=20
An attorney for Duncan declined to comment on the memo.=20
But in a contentious opening salvo to the government's burgeoning inquiry, =
Duncan plans to refuse to testify today before the House Energy and Commerc=
e Committee.=20
The public standoff between Duncan, who wanted immunity in exchange for his=
 testimony today, and the committee, which refused his request for a tempor=
ary postponement of his appearance, are the first examples of what Washingt=
on experts predict could be several months of finger-pointing and legal man=
euvering.=20
"He's flying from Houston to Washington to assert the 5th [Amendment] and l=
eave," said Duncan's attorney, Robert J. Giuffra Jr.=20
In a letter to the committee Wednesday, Giuffra expressed frustration that =
the committee would not allow Duncan to postpone his testimony in order to =
review two boxes of Andersen documents that were not provided to him until =
Tuesday.=20
He also noted that it was unusual to require a potential witness to appear =
before a congressional committee and be sworn in, merely to invoke his cons=
titutional right to refuse to testify. Duncan had offered to provide the co=
mmittee with a sworn statement invoking the 5th Amendment in lieu of appear=
ing at the televised hearing.=20
"Most of the time, these things are worked out," said Jack Blum, a Washingt=
on attorney and former Senate investigator. "But if the effect you want is =
drama, you bring them in to take the 5th."=20
Committee spokesman Ken Johnson noted that Duncan spent 4 1/2 hours talking=
 to committee investigators behind closed doors.=20
"All we're asking is that he provide the same information to the committee =
under oath."=20
The committee also planned to subpoena Andersen Chief Executive Joseph F. B=
erardino but reportedly has agreed to allow an Andersen partner, Dorsey Bas=
kin, to come in Berardino's place.=20
The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, which Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (=
D-Conn.) chairs, is also holding hearings today, focusing primarily on issu=

Enron Audit Fee Raises Some Brows
JERRY HIRSCH
TIMES STAFF WRITER

01/23/2002
Los Angeles Times
Home Edition
A-1
Copyright 2002 / The Times Mirror Company

The fee Enron Corp. paid the Andersen accounting firm to audit its books wa=
s one of the richest in corporate America, a fee that reflects the complexi=
ty, and possibly the risk, inherent in the job.=20
Enron paid Andersen $25 million for the year 2000 audit, a figure higher th=
an all but one of the companies in the Dow Jones industrials that reported =
their audit fees. The average charge among the blue chips was just $9 milli=
on, according to a review of such fees by The Times.
It also was large compared with the fees other energy companies paid their =
accountants, even Andersen. In a review of fees listed in Securities and Ex=
change Commission filings, The Times found that audit contracts averaged $3=
 million at nine large energy companies, including Andersen clients Mirant =
Corp., UtiliCorp United Inc., Dynegy Inc. and Calpine Corp.=20
Andersen's fee was a red flag to some experts and critics who say it could =
have clouded the company's judgment as it examined Enron's tangled financia=
l structure. The high fee no doubt reflected the difficulty of the audit, b=
ut it also may have hinted that Enron's finances contained unknown risks. I=
ndeed, Andersen executives debated internally whether the audit and other f=
ees would be perceived as a breach of the firm's independence.=20
An Andersen spokesman defended the fee, saying it reflected the size and co=
mplexity of Enron.=20
"This was a very sophisticated business," Andersen spokesman David Tabolt s=
aid. "The fee is set by the scope of the audit and the kind of people that =
have to be brought in to do the work. There are a whole lot of factors that=
 go into it."=20
Tabolt said the audit fee was in line with those of Enron's peers--the top =
10 companies in the Fortune 500. But even by that standard, the fee was lar=
ge.=20
The nine other companies at the top of that list paid an average of $14.5 m=
illion for their audits. Only Citigroup Inc., the nation's largest financia=
l services company, paid more than Enron: $26.1 million.=20
Even if Enron were looked at as a financial services company, the fee it pa=
id was unusual. The Times examined the fees of seven large financial servic=
es companies--including Citigroup, American International Group, Goldman Sa=
chs Group Inc. and Bank of America Corp.--and found that the average audit =
charge was $15.5 million.=20
Several accounting professors and industry insiders said the high fees coul=
d be an indicator of the complicated nature of the Enron audit or the perce=
ived risk of the account.=20
"The relationship between a client and its auditors is a complicated thing =
because auditors get paid by the client but are supposed to be independent,=
" said Rick Antle, an accounting professor at the Yale School of Management=
.=20
"If you tell your client 'no' too many times, you don't have a client. But =
if you go along with everything they suggest, you could end up in jail," sa=
id Antle, who added that there is insufficient information yet to determine=
 whether the high fees Andersen collected influenced its judgment.=20
However, critics of the accounting industry say the fees Enron paid Anderse=
n--including an additional $27 million for consulting work--and the scandal=
 arising from the audit highlight problems that include the independence of=
 auditors and how the business is marketed and sold.=20
They argue that the fee clouded the minds of auditors, who were loath to en=
danger Andersen's contract by forcing Enron to adhere to stricter financial=
 standards.=20
The audit--and its failure to more fully disclose internal conflicts of int=
erest of Enron executives, billions of dollars in hidden debt and hundreds =
of millions of dollars in losses--is now the subject of multiple federal in=
vestigations.=20
Even top Andersen executives debated the propriety of the fees it was colle=
cting from Enron--which, including the consulting work, reached $1 million =
a week.=20
In a meeting almost a year ago, a group of the firm's top partners on the E=
nron engagement and at Andersen headquarters in Chicago discussed "whether =
there would be a perceived independence issue solely considering our level =
of fees," according to a Feb. 6 internal e-mail summarizing the meeting.=20
The partners estimated that the combined take on the Enron audit and consul=
ting contracts could reach $100 million annually. Ultimately the partners d=
ecided that they were not troubled by such a figure "as long as the nature =
of the services was not an issue."=20
The amount a firm charges for accounting services can be a warning sign for=
 audit problems, said Mark Cheffers, who operates the AccountingMalpractice=
.com Web site.=20
Certainly, the Enron fee was large enough to have the potential to color th=
e judgment of the firm's staff, Cheffers said.=20
But there is equal danger at the other end of the scale, where low audit fe=
es are designed to gain an accounting firm entry to a large company so it c=
an sell a host of profitable consulting and other services, Cheffers said.=
=20
Companies only last year began disclosing what they paid auditors, and ther=
e is not enough information yet to interpret what differences in fees mean,=
 said Lawrence Revsine, a Northwestern University accounting professor.=20
"We can't say that when there is a $25-million audit versus a $15-million a=
udit, something rotten is afoot here, but we will be able to as more inform=
ation about audit fees comes out now and it is studied," he said.=20
Revsine said researchers will look at how differences in a company's number=
 of locations, employees, complexity of transactions and other factors can =
affect an audit.=20
Audits are intended to provide independent verification that a company is g=
iving investors an accurate picture of its finances and that it is followin=
g consistent and generally accepted accounting rules and standards.=20
Enron's downfall, caused in part by the accounting treatment of a series of=
 partnerships and ventures affiliated with the Houston energy trader, has t=
hrown thousands of employees out of work and has cost the company's pension=
ers and investors billions of dollars in stock value losses.=20
Yet it would be a mistake to assume that all audited financial statements g=
o through the same type of scrubbing and are comparable, said Ira Solomon, =
who heads the accounting department at the University of Illinois.=20
For example, two identical companies with the same level of sales and cost =
structures could have different profit figures based upon the way they cons=
truct their financial statements. The cost of inventory can be calculated b=
y two methods that yield different results in the short term. Each approach=
 is an accepted practice, and each produces a different profit figure, Solo=
mon said.=20
J. Terry Strange, vice chairman, assurance and advisory services, for accou=
nting firm KPMG, which audits Citigroup, said it makes sense that financial=
 services companies pay higher audit fees than other companies.=20
"The size of the fee is directly related to the size, and more importantly,=
 the complexity of the enterprise being audited," Strange said. "Financial =
services companies are, generally speaking, the most complicated businesses=
. The reason they are complicated is that they are in the financial risk bu=
siness.=20
"So risk enters into [calculating an audit fee]--the nature of risk that th=
e enterprise takes and the amount of work that must be done to become comfo=
rtable that the auditor understands and agrees with the accounting and beli=
eves that the enterprise has controls in place to manage the risk they are =
taking," he said.=20
By those standards, it would make sense that Enron would be an expensive au=
dit. The company in many ways operated as a financial services business, de=
veloping new trading mechanisms and markets for everything from energy to t=
elecommunications services--in the process inventing transactions that were=
 new to the business world.=20
With that came high risks.=20
"Clearly this was a very high-risk client. They were doing things in an ind=
ustry that had never been done before," said Randolph Beatty, dean of USC's=
 Leventhal School of Accounting.=20
But Andersen spokesman Tabolt said the company does not build a "risk premi=
um" into its audit fees.=20
Each of the five largest accounting firms conducts the audits of 2,000 to 3=
,000 publicly traded companies in the United States, according to the Publi=
c Accounting Report, an industry newsletter. They so dominate the business =
that the No. 6 firm in the country, BDO Seidman, has only 325 SEC-reporting=
 clients.=20
Although companies occasionally change auditors for such reasons as fees or=
 arguments or service issues, most companies stay with the same auditor for=
 years, occasionally putting their contracts out to bid.=20
Certain firms specialize in industries. Andersen, which audits only two of =
the 30 companies that make up the Dow Jones industrial average, has a large=
 energy business practice. PricewaterhouseCoopers specializes in large comp=
anies and audits 14 of the Dow 30.=20

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: GAUGING THE ASSETS
Plaintiffs Ask: Just How Deep Are the Pockets At Andersen?
By JONATHAN D. GLATER

c. 2002 New York Times Company

The growing stack of lawsuits against Arthur Andersen, which audited Enron'=
s financial statements, raises the question of just how much could the firm=
 really afford to pay out.=20
In the latest suit, filed yesterday in Federal District Court in Houston, E=
nron employees argue that the accounting firm helped hide Enron's true fina=
ncial condition and contributed to losses of more than $1.3 billion from th=
eir retirement funds.
Federal and Congressional investigators, along with legions of plaintiffs' =
lawyers, are engaged in a fierce and competitive search for evidence of wro=
ngdoing at the accounting firm in its dealings with Enron, the Houston ener=
gy trader now in bankruptcy court. Andersen, after all, could conceivably s=
atisfy at least some of Enron's creditors.=20
It is not easy to determine how much Andersen is worth or how much it could=
 pay to satisfy the various lawsuits if it loses or chooses to settle. But =
claims of more than $1 billion, as identified in yesterday's suit, could co=
me dangerously close to wiping out the firm, said independent analysts who =
track the industry.=20
In public statements about the impact of Enron's collapse Joseph F. Berardi=
no, Andersen's chief executive, has emphasized that the firm's clients are =
standing by it and that its employees are trying to focus on the firm's wor=
k. ''We are meeting with our clients every day,'' Mr. Berardino said on ''M=
eet the Press'' on Sunday. ''Our clients know what we really stand for, and=
 our clients are standing by us because we do great work.''=20
Like the other Big Five accounting firms, Andersen is a private partnership=
 and does not have to disclose much information about its financial conditi=
on.=20
''They like to be under the radar screen,'' said Arthur W. Bowman, editor o=
f Bowman's Accounting Report.=20
Some general information has been amassed by accounting industry analysts a=
nd lawyers who have been involved in litigation against the Big Five firms.=
=20
Andersen's first line of defense is its insurance. While that amount is a c=
losely guarded secret -- plaintiffs' lawyers would dearly love to know how =
much coverage an accounting firm has so that they could settle lawsuits for=
 the full amount of the policy -- some of the firm's peers described, in ge=
neral terms, what that insurance looks like.=20
Big accounting firms generally have an outside insurance policy of $100 mil=
lion to $300 million. That policy would come with a sizable deductible, too=
 -- probably $50 million to $100 million. Above that, some firms self-insur=
e, for example by setting up ''captive'' offshore subsidiaries that sell in=
surance back to the parent firm. (Setting up such a company offshore confer=
s certain benefits on the subsidiary, like a smaller required capital inves=
tment by the parent.)=20
Until June 1998, the Big Five firms pooled insurance funds, so that a big i=
nsurance payout by one firm could affect another. That system is no longer =
in effect and would not be invoked in any Enron-related lawsuits because th=
ey have all been filed well after 1998, said executives at a big firm.=20
Next would come the firm's capital, a figure very difficult to determine. P=
artnership capital is the result of payments made by the a ners. Consulting=
 partners may be compensated differently from auditing partners, as are dif=
ferent partners in different cities. But when an auditor is first promoted =
to partner, he must pay a portion of his compensation into the firm, essent=
ially buying a stake in the company. That first payment could amount to nea=
rly all of his compensation, probably $150,000 to $250,000 a year. In later=
 years, those partners would probably plow a smaller portion of their compe=
nsation back into the firm to cover operating expenses.=20
The firm's capital base, consisting of assets, like furniture, computers an=
d offices, and cash, might total $1.5 billion to $2 billion, said accountan=
ts familiar with the Big Five, but plaintiffs' lawyers said that liquidatin=
g the firm would be difficult. The firm could also draw on lines of credit =
from lenders for some unknown amount, while it rebuilt capital. Some analys=
ts said, however, that partners were more likely to choose to disband than =
to try to rebuild a depleted capital base with loans or their own money.=20
The firm could raise money by selling off business lines, said Melvyn I. We=
iss, whose law firm, Milberg Weiss Hynes Bershad & Lerach, is one of severa=
l that have filed suits against Enron executives and Andersen. ''Maybe they=
 can sell the firm, or pieces of it,'' he said.=20
Because Andersen is a limited liability partnership, it is unlikely that an=
y plaintiff could collect from a partner's personal assets, unless that par=
tner was directly involved in wrongdoing that led to the firm's liability. =
For example, partners intimately involved in the Enron account could concei=
vably be found personally liable in a shareholder lawsuit, lawyers said.=20
''It's unclear where the chain of liability would end,'' said David J. McCa=
be, a lawyer at Willkie Farr & Gallagher in New York. ''But clearly the par=
tner who was responsible for supervision'' would be at risk, he said.=20
Of course, Andersen's ability to survive depends on how it fares in lawsuit=
s as well as how its business does. It is too early to tell whether clients=
 are jumping to some of the firm's rivals, though some other big firms say =
that they have picked up a smattering of Andersen clients.=20
The other risk to the firm is a loss of personnel as the Enron scandal drag=
s on. While many headhunters said they had not yet seen a flurry of resumes=
, Dean McMann, chief executive of the Ransford Group, which advises account=
ing firms, said he had received more than 1,000 e-mail messages and phone c=
alls from Andersen employees curious about the job market for them.=20
''The only reason you want to know what's happening in the market is you wa=
nt to be in the market,'' Mr. McMann said. ''It's not a very good market ri=
ght now.''

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE OFFICE
Morale and Occupancy Are Low At the Headquarters in Houston
By DAVID BARBOZA

01/24/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 4
c. 2002 New York Times Company

HOUSTON, Jan. 23 -- Inside the glass-sheathed 50-story Enron headquarters h=
ere, the televisions that once carried news and financial channels in the e=
levators have been turned off. ''ETV is under construction,'' the monitors =
now read.=20
''They don't want to make people more nervous than they are already,'' expl=
ained one former executive who has visited the building since he was laid o=
ff in December after the company filed for bankruptcy protection. ''It's ve=
ry, very grim.''
This is the new face of the Enron Corporation, once the world's biggest ene=
rgy trader but now a skeleton of its old self. Not long ago, 7,000 people w=
orked for the company in downtown Houston. Now only about 4,000 of the fait=
hful are left. Entire units have been decimated; whole floors are practical=
ly deserted.=20
For weeks after the filing, Keith Couch had the 27th floor virtually to him=
self. People would stop by and notice the lone figure tapping away at a key=
board. They would laugh, giggle and point at the rows of empty desks that s=
uggested a neutron bomb had been set off.=20
''It's been dead here for a while,'' said Mr. Couch, 34, who works in the i=
nformation technology group at Enron and has since moved to a more populate=
d floor. ''It's not like being in a funeral, but it's quiet -- real quiet,'=
' he said. ''The place I used to work isn't here anymore.''=20
These days, Enron is being carved up; its accounting is being scrutinized b=
y litigants, and its corridors are even being prowled by F.B.I. agents, pho=
tographing documents and hoping to prevent important information from reach=
ing the shredding machines.=20
Two days after a former employee gave lawyers a box full of shredded financ=
ial documents, the kind of papers the company warned people not to destroy,=
 both Enron and the F.B.I have stepped up security. The 19th and 20th floor=
s, which once housed the accounting offices and even some employees from Ar=
thur Andersen working on internal auditing, are now under guard. Stairway a=
ccess was sealed on Tuesday.=20
This is the humbled face of the new Enron, beleaguered, embattled and under=
 siege. Legions of class-action lawyers are in town meeting at the Four Sea=
sons Hotel, drafting new strategies on how to pull valuable financial docum=
ents out of the building. And government investigators of all types are als=
o here, combing through the financial ruins of a company that rose to No. 7=
 on the Fortune 500 list, albeit because of revenue that some now say was i=
nflated.=20
The media hordes come and go, often straddling all corners around 1400 Smit=
h Street, where a giant ''E,'' tipped on its side as a corporate emblem, se=
nds a dual message about a company that once defied gravity and now relucta=
ntly succumbs to it.=20
''People are nervous about being there,'' said a former executive who has k=
ept in touch with friends and colleagues inside the building. ''They still =
feel guilty about being there.''=20
This was once the home of the old- economy company that went new economy --=
 a dot-com energy company that acted like a Wall Street trading house and b=
oldly told competitors they were ''dinosaurs'' and Enron was going to eat t=
heir lunch.=20
Today, Enron cannot afford the new $200 million 40-story corporate tower un=
der construction across the street. It was supposed to relieve the congesti=
on in the main headquarters tower . Now, the company is moving employees ov=
er from 3 Allen Center, a nearby tower where it has long housed other worke=
rs.=20
''It definitely feels empty,'' said one worker who asked not to be named. '=
'You feel a lot of things are missing. And morale is kind of low.''=20
Enron recently sold off its profitable energy and power trading group to UB=
S in exchange for promises of about a third of the pretax profits. Soon Enr=
on will also lose the natural gas pipeline that Dynegy is to get after the =
failed merger between the companies.=20
Away from its headquarters, many companies acquired by Enron along the way =
are trying to conduct business as usual. But it isn't easy. Portland Genera=
l Electric, a utility that serves northern Oregon, has not been forced to l=
ay off any of its 2,700 employees. But with the Enron stock price in the ba=
sement, so are many employees' retirement hopes.=20
''I've been climbing poles and doing line work since 1966,'' said Roy Rinar=
d, 54, whose 401(k) plan once was worth as much as $472,000. ''Now I'm sitt=
ing here with basically $12,000 to show for it.''=20
Mr. Rinard said the uncertainty hanging over the utility's future made it h=
ard to focus on work. ''Everyone is concerned about the direction we're goi=
ng, whether we're going to be broken apart and separated or remain an intac=
t utility,'' he said.=20
The broadband unit, which was supposed to offer high-speed telecommunicatio=
ns services, came unglued even before Enron's Chapter 11 filing. Nine month=
s ago, it employed about 1,000 people. Now, there is virtually no one in th=
e unit. The trading floor for another unit, Enron Global Markets, is idle -=
- a room of computers but no heads.=20
The average passer-by might not notice anything unusual from outside the En=
ron headquarters, but inside the building seems less cramped. This afternoo=
n, a little coffee shop on the ground floor, which used to be crowded at 4 =
p.m. with chattering and deal-making employees, had just two patrons.=20
''The elevators used to be so crowded,'' said Jeff Snyder, 24, a former emp=
loyee who has gone back into the building recently. ''Now you get one and y=
ou ride by yourself.''=20
One can see a pleasant but more stoic look on the faces of Enron people.=20
Many remember that just months ago there was an energy about the place. The=
re was the fast pace, the giddiness of riding with a company whose stock we=
nt to the moon in 1999 and 2000.=20
A giant banner hanging in the Enron lobby had proclaimed, ''From the World'=
s Leading Energy Company to the World's Leading Company!'' After Sept. 11, =
it was replaced by an American flag; and that was probably a good thing bec=
ause by now it would serve only as a daily reminder of how grossly overconf=
ident the company once was.=20
Down in the lobby, where security guards carefully keep unwelcome visitors =
at bay, an electrified ''E'' inside the lobby still twirls, and the ticker =
showing Enron's stock price is still aglow. But today, the price of Enron's=
 stock, which has been delisted from the New York Stock Exchange, scrolled =
across at 34 cents a share, down 9 cents.=20
The new Enron is filled with people moving into what is now its lone buildi=
ng to fill the gaps. On many floors, there is no receptionist and there are=
 empty cubicles.=20
Of course, Enron still has three major natural gas pipelines, it still owns=
 Portland General Electric (though it is being sold), and it still has Enro=
n Wind and Enron Energy Services, which delivers energy to commercial and i=
ndustrial companies.=20
But the legal department was chopped, and so were human resources, accounti=
ng, tax and corporate services. And fewer people are on hand to field news =
media calls.=20
''We just moved; we got smaller,'' said Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman. ''=
We had 27; now we have 7.''=20
More than 100 Arthur Andersen people have departed, some before and some af=
ter Enron said this month that it would fire the company as its auditor.=20
To lighten up the place, Elicia de la Cruz had a baby shower in the payroll=
 department today. Coming out of the building this afternoon, her friend Pa=
uline Sanchez said the shower had brought some smiles.=20
''It was a nice change,'' she said.=20
Still, life goes on. The credit union is open, and so is a small supermarke=
t where workers can get fresh deli meats. The health club was closed for a =
while but is now open again, though the $10 monthly membership fee has been=
 increased to $25.=20
Representatives of the news media are eager to get into 1400 Smith Street. =
Some chase Enron employees to their cars. Not long ago, a photographer paid=
 an Enron employee to smuggle in a camera to photograph the place. Security=
 seized the camera.=20
The people who are photographing, though, are agents from the F.B.I., who t=
oday were on the 19th and 20th floors. ''It's kind of weird,'' one Enron em=
ployee said. ''They say we're exhibit No. 102.''=20
The company used to give regular video updates on the building under constr=
uction next door, even with skits by the ''building guy.''=20
''The joke was,'' one employee said, ''that the building guy would be repla=
ced by the bankruptcy guy.''

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE CRITICS
Sharpton, in Houston, Calls Attention to the Workers
By MICHAEL BRICK

01/24/2002
The New York Times
Page 6, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

HOUSTON, Jan. 23 -- The Rev. Al Sharpton pulled up to RJ's Rib Joint this a=
fternoon to meet with local ministers, a state representative, an N.A.A.C.P=
. official and a victim of the Enron collapse.=20
Local television cameramen were waiting under the veranda. The three palm t=
rees looked a little out of place.
''I'm here because I'm very concerned about the employees and the investors=
,'' Mr. Sharpton said. ''As the investigation goes forward, somebody needs =
to step forward and call on the government to bail out the victims.''=20
Then the cameras turned on Mary Behn, the Enron victim. The local ministers=
 shepherded her inside to a private dining room to prepare for a full-blown=
 news conference. Just about everyone but Mr. Sharpton tried the ribs. Mr. =
Sharpton stuck to the chicken. A couple dining in the main room did not ini=
tially recognize him as he passed by, they said, because he had lost so muc=
h weight.=20
The Enron debacle has made Houston the center of a certain kind of temporal=
 universe, and Mr. Sharpton has recognized an unusual opportunity for his b=
rand of social criticism.=20
So has the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, who said in a telephone interview that he=
 would arrive in Houston Thursday night and conduct several meetings with f=
ired workers under the auspices of his Operation PUSH organization.=20
Mr. Jackson said he would remain here through Friday, in hopes of meeting w=
ith Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chief executive. ''I think one thing that Ken L=
ay and President Bush should agree on is that these workers need to be made=
 whole,'' he said.=20
There has been talk of the two ministers jostling for pre-eminence on issue=
s of social justice; all that Mr. Jackson's local representative, William-P=
aul Michael, would say on that score about Mr. Sharpton's visit was, ''it's=
 interesting that he is here just before reverend's here.''=20
So Mr. Sharpton has a one-day head start on Mr. Jackson.=20
After lunch, Mr. Sharpton escorted Ms. Behn before the cameras to tell her =
story. She worked at Enron for 15 years. She is a single parent with a chil=
d in college. Her stock is worthless and she has no income.=20
''We want to be able to start our lives over again,'' she said. ''We thank =
Mr. Sharpton for allowing himself to be present to help.''=20
And Mr. Sharpton had one last point to make.=20
''The laryngitis that the leading Democrats have had on this issue to me is=
 frightening,'' he said. Democrats and Republicans alike plan numerous hear=
ings into Enron's collapse, with one scheduled Thursday in each house of Co=
ngress.=20
Mr. Sharpton and local ministers plan to bring other former Enron employees=
 and stockholders to a meeting next week and then to Washington, but for no=
w they have just Ms. Behn. Mr. Sharpton said that because everyone was focu=
sed on the investigation, the workers' troubles were being overlooked. Many=
 of these workers do at least have savings and job prospects.=20
Still, said Michael P. Williams, the pastor of the Joy Tabernacle here and =
one of the ministers who met with Mr. Sharpton, ''people define themselves =
by what they do -- when you stop being that, after 15 years, after 20 years=
, that's a big blow.''=20
Back in the private meeting room, as everyone was finishing sides of potato=
 salad (Mr. Sharpton opted for the baked potato), the Rev. James W. E. Dixo=
n said that former Enron workers in his church were asking for advice about=
 their careers and their assets.=20
Mr. Sharpton said the workers deserved remuneration because regulation fail=
ed. And he sees his own opportunity here, too.=20
''As I explore running for president,'' he said, ''it is interesting that n=
one of the other candidates have been here.''=20
Told that Mr. Jackson will be here Thursday, he said: ''Maybe. But he isn't=
 running for president.''

Jan. 23, 2002, 11:55PM
The government failed to protect investors from the downfall of Enron and t=
herefore should find money to help those who lost their savings in the corp=
oration's collapse, the Rev. Al Sharpton said Wednesday.=20
"Somebody must stand up" for those people, Sharpton said at a news conferen=
ce on the steps outside Enron. "There must be a commitment by the governmen=
t to bail them out."=20
If the government can afford to bail out airlines and other struggling corp=
orations, he said, "they can certainly find money for victims who would not=
 have been victimized if the government had protected them."=20
The Rev. James Dixon, president of the Texas chapter of the National Action=
 Network, and Larry Green, district director for U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson L=
ee, D-Houston, also attended.=20
Sharpton, president of the National Action Network, said he came to Houston=
 after talking with Dixon about the effect of Enron's collapse.=20
"The ripple effect in the community is huge," said Dixon, of Houston's Comm=
unity of Faith Baptist Church. He noted scores of families in his and other=
 churches who have suffered critical financial wounds in the wake of Enron'=
s collapse.=20
Green said Jackson Lee was in Washington Wednesday, introducing legislation=
 to ensure a disaster like Enron's collapse will never happen again.=20
Sharpton and Dixon have scheduled a town hall meeting for 7 p.m. Wednesday =
at Community of Faith Baptist Church, 1024 Pinemont.=20

REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
Taking Stock of Enron

01/24/2002
The Wall Street Journal
A18
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

The first two of at least eight Congressional hearings on Enron kick off to=
day, an embarrassment of political riches. We're as curious as anybody to l=
earn what was going on behind Enron's accounting kimono, but in the meantim=
e we've been taking a peek ourselves at other parts of the company's anatom=
y.=20
In particular, we've looked into the alleged problems with Enron's pension =
plan, the source of much hot populist rage. What we've learned is that, at =
least in this part of the Enron debacle, the reality isn't nearly as awful =
as some of the headlines. Consider some of the facts:
-- Enron's pension plans followed standard practices of most big, publicly =
traded firms. Enron offered several arrangements -- from employee stock-opt=
ion plans to defined benefits -- but the one that has everybody outraged is=
 its 401(k).=20
Enron's employees could set aside up to 15% of their pretax salary in a 401=
(k), up to the IRS limit of $10,500 last year; they could put the cash into=
 one of 20 different investment vehicles, including mutual funds and a brok=
erage account. Workers controlled this money in their own self-directed acc=
ounts and were free to switch among investments or even cash out (with a ta=
x penalty).=20
Enron had about 24,000 workers world-wide before bankruptcy and about half =
of them participated in the 401(k). So we're talking about 11,000 employees=
 and a plan with about $1 billion in total assets, of which from $500 milli=
on to $600 million was invested in Enron stock.=20
-- Enron also matched up to half of these worker contributions, up to 6% of=
 base pay. But it matched in Enron stock, and employees were required to ho=
ld this matched stock until age 50. That limitation has come in for critici=
sm, but keep in mind the stock was free. Some politicians want to stop comp=
anies from matching in stock, but the danger is that they then won't match =
at all.=20
This arrangement is also fairly typical of big plans. About half match with=
 company stock and half with cash. General Electric's plan offers a cash ma=
tch, for instance, but about three-quarters of its workers use that money t=
o buy company stock.=20
-- Contrary to the headlines, Enron employees were not forced to watch help=
lessly as the value of their stock cratered, trapped by a malicious "lockdo=
wn."=20
A lockdown, more properly a "transaction suspension period," occurs when co=
mpanies change record keepers. Transactions are barred for a time so the ne=
w record keeper can verify account accuracy and make a reconciliation. Lock=
downs can last anywhere from a few days to two months, depending on the siz=
e of the plan, its complexity and the sophistication of the record keepers.=
 Last year, 24,000 private investment plans changed record keepers.=20
Most important, Enron notified employees of the coming lockdown several tim=
es -- first by mail and then by four separate e-mails. Enron shares were st=
ill trading in the $30 range at this time, when workers had ample opportuni=
ty to sell. The lockdown itself started Oct. 26 and ended Nov. 13, so worke=
rs were locked out for only 11 stock-trading days. And during that time Enr=
on's stock fell from $15.40 to $9.30, a rather small decline for a stock th=
at had already lost almost 70% of its value during 2001.=20
-- 401(k) plans do not promote dangerously undiversified portfolios. Divers=
ification is an important financial tool, permitting investors to reduce ri=
sk without reducing expected returns. In long-term financial planning, it m=
akes excellent sense to hold a portfolio that is diversified across a range=
 of assets.=20
But diversification is also a highly individual thing. Strategies depend mo=
stly on age; a person nearing retirement should hold fewer risky assets tha=
n one starting a career. But after adjusting for age, all assets should be =
considered together. For example, a person who is heavily invested in real =
estate might want to achieve balance by a single-minded approach in other v=
ehicles, like ginning up her 401(k) for equities.=20
That doesn't mean holding 100% of equities in company stock is a great idea=
. But then again if the rest of an investor's equity portion is well-divers=
ified, such a concentration isn't crazy. In hindsight, a 100% concentration=
 in Microsoft made a lot of sense and lot of millionaires. A 100% concentra=
tion in Enron also made sense for a while; from January 1998 to January 200=
1, Enron's shares increased fivefold.=20
-- Enron's 401(k) experience does not indicate that the plan is fiendishly =
flawed and government must step in to correct it. If workers knew Enron's t=
rue condition, they would no doubt have declined to invest in company stock=
 in their self-directed accounts. The problem is that they didn't know the =
true condition of Enron, but then neither did the credit rating agencies, v=
arious federal overseers, stock analysts, auditors and (possibly) even much=
 of its senior management. This was a failure in truth-telling and truth-fe=
rreting out and it was system wide.=20
All of which means that while the Enron pension story is tragic, it's more =
about specific corporate blunders and wrongdoing than it is about flaws in =
pension law or in 401(k)s. It's certainly no excuse for Congress to lobotom=
ize a private pension system that has given millions of Americans a comfort=
able retirement.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: RETURNS UNDER SCRUTINY
Senate Finance Panel Wants Tax Information From Enron
By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

The Senate Finance Committee yesterday asked Enron to disclose its corporat=
e income tax returns.=20
In a letter to the chief financial officer of Enron, Senator Max Baucus, De=
mocrat of Montana, who is chairman of the committee, and Senator Charles E.=
 Grassley of Iowa, the ranking Republican, said ''it is critical that the p=
ublic and the Congress have a more informed understanding of the activities=
 and transactions related to Enron's tax returns and pension programs.''
The New York Times reported last week that Enron paid no taxes on its profi=
ts in four of the last five years and was eligible for $382 million of refu=
nds. Enron created 881 partnerships in the Cayman Islands and other tax hav=
ens, most of which also have strict bank secrecy laws, actions the Finance =
Committee plans to examine in hearings that may begin as soon as March.=20
Vance Mayer, an Enron spokesman, had no comment.=20
Several leading tax lawyers said they saw no benefit to Enron in making its=
 tax returns public.=20
Mortimer Caplin, the Kennedy administration's tax commissioner, said, ''I w=
ould try to resist them as much as I could if I was representing Enron.''=
=20
Six other Washington tax lawyers, some of whom represent Enron or its credi=
tors, agreed. ''Disclosure would just lead to more questions, and that won'=
t help Enron,'' said one of the lawyers, who insisted on anonymity.=20
Federal law allows the Senate Finance Committee, the House Ways and Means C=
ommittee and the Joint Committee on Taxation to inspect any tax return, but=
 requires that they do so in closed session. The committees are not allowed=
 to disclose what they glean from tax returns, and for that reason, some co=
mmittee tax experts refuse to inspect actual returns. Disclosure of informa=
tion on the returns is a felony.=20
The letter from the two senators took note of their committee's authority t=
o inspect the returns in closed session. They said their request was a cour=
tesy ''to allow Enron an opportunity to provide the public a better underst=
anding of the events at Enron.''=20
Mr. Baucus, in an interview, said that he hoped Enron would decide ''to wor=
k on a solid constructive basis with the committee.''=20
''This is not a witch hunt,'' Senator Baucus said. ''I want to get the fact=
s and work with the company if they want to work with us.''=20
He said that if a closed-door review of the income tax returns showed that =
Enron had complied with all tax laws, he would then focus on changing those=
 laws so that corporations could not eliminate income taxes through the use=
 of partnerships in tax havens.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: POLITICAL MEMO
In Personal Anecdote, Some See New Distance Where Others See New Strategy
By RICHARD L. BERKE

01/24/2002
The New York Times
Page 6, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON, Jan. 23 -- To listen to President Bush, it was almost as if an =
epiphany involving his mother-in-law drove him to turn on the Enron Corpora=
tion, his most generous political benefactor. In assailing Enron on a trip =
Tuesday to Belle, W.Va., Mr. Bush said, ''My own mother-in-law'' lost all o=
f her investment when the company's stock collapsed.=20
But people close to Mr. Bush said his mother-in-law, Jenna Welch, served as=
 a convenient device for him to distance himself from the Enron debacle and=
 to appear more empathetic to its investors and employees than to the wealt=
hy business executives who escaped the Enron collapse with flush bank accou=
nts.
White House officials insisted that there was no change of emphasis -- or h=
eart -- and noted that Mr. Bush's newly disparaging comments about Enron, a=
nd his mother-in-law's experience, came in response to reporters' questions=
.=20
''This was definitely not a predetermined strategy shift of any sort,'' sai=
d Dan Bartlett, Mr. Bush's communications director. ''It's the same thing h=
e's been saying in private meetings and conversations with staff for the pa=
st month.''=20
Yet other advisers to Mr. Bush said the president had recently discussed wi=
th Karen P. Hughes, his counselor, and a tight circle of aides, that he nee=
ded to move more aggressively -- and in a much more public way -- to distan=
ce the White House from Enron and its chief executive, Kenneth L. Lay.=20
They said Mr. Bush was in part responding to many of his friends in Texas w=
here, in the words of one adviser, ''This has really put a gash in the fabr=
ic of the community.'' More pragmatically, they said polling for the Republ=
ican Party has shown that Mr. Bush's relationship to energy companies is on=
e of his biggest vulnerabilities.=20
In addition, they said, the White House did not want to end up too much on =
the defensive, as often happened when controversies swirled around Presiden=
t Bill Clinton. Already, Congressional Republicans appeared to be moving ah=
ead of Mr. Bush by announcing that they were returning their Enron donation=
s -- while the president was still expressing remorse over the collapse.=20
''It changed the terms of the debate to Bush's family being a victim,'' Sco=
tt Reed, a Republican strategist, said of Mr. Bush's remarks, ''and for the=
 first time it gives the Republicans the high ground on the Enron mess. I w=
as with a lot of Democrats at lunch today, and they saw it as a turning poi=
nt.''=20
An outside adviser to Mr. Bush said, ''They don't want Bush to appear to be=
 aloof and focused only on the big financial problems of Enron.''=20
Other Republicans were more skeptical, suggesting that Mr. Bush's hasty ret=
reat from his friendship with Mr. Lay -- and his fresh outrage over Enron -=
- was transparent.=20
A longtime Bush adviser said: ''He doesn't necessarily turn on people but h=
e cuts them off. This is cut and run.'' He added, ''It was a little gratuit=
ous invoking his mother-in-law.''=20
Yet by mentioning his mother-in-law, Mr. Bartlett said, the president under=
scores that he is sympathetic to the personal and financial havoc brought o=
n by Enron's collapse.=20
''It shows that he does understand that the typical investor and the everyd=
ay employees of Enron were really hurt by this,'' he said.=20
Specifically, Mr. Bush told reporters on Tuesday: ''What I'm outraged about=
 is that shareholders and employees didn't know all the facts about Enron. =
My own mother-in-law bought stock last summer, and it's not worth anything =
now. If she had known all the facts, I don't know what her decision would h=
ave been made, but she didn't know all the facts. And a lot of shareholders=
 didn't know all the facts.''=20
Still, it can be treacherous for presidents, or would-be presidents, to try=
 to personalize problems of ordinary Americans to their own lives. Al Gore'=
s citing of the price of his mother-in-law's arthritis medicine backfired. =
(He said she paid nearly three times as much for it as the same medicine us=
ed by his ailing dog, Shiloh.) And the audience burst into laughter at a pr=
esidential debate when President Jimmy Carter said he chatted about nuclear=
 weaponry with his daughter, Amy.=20
''This is very dangerous for the president,'' said Stanley Greenberg, a Dem=
ocratic pollster. ''I don't know that the president can attack Enron and be=
 plausible or authentic. It will not take away the close relationships betw=
een Enron and Arthur Andersen and the administration. It will look like hyp=
ocrisy.''=20
Asserting that Mr. Bush did not suddenly bring up the anecdote about his mo=
ther-in-law, Mr. Bartlett said he first heard the president mention it at a=
 private meeting of the White House economic team on Jan. 10. He also said =
that had the response been orchestrated, there would have been no need for =
Ms. Hughes to call him at the White House from West Virginia to seek more d=
etails about Ms. Welch's $8,000 Enron investment.=20
''When Karen called me from the road, she said, 'Can you get the details on=
 the Enron stock?' '' Mr. Bartlett said. ''We didn't have the details. It's=
 not something we had all in the can. We had to call the accountant.'' (In =
fact, after gleaning new details, White House officials ended up correcting=
 Mr. Bush on the timing of his mother-in-law's investment.)=20
Beyond the political imperatives, White House advisers said Mr. Bush has be=
en affected by the concerns expressed by many of his closest friends in the=
 energy business.=20
''He's hearing from all kinds of people in Texas on this thing,'' said a cl=
ose friend of Mr. Bush. ''You can't be in the Houston community without see=
ing the devastation, and those stories are getting out.''=20
Some advisers to Mr. Bush said he did not act sooner to denounce Enron beca=
use he and his aides were inundated with questions about ties between the a=
dministration and Enron officials.=20
To reinforce Mr. Bush's determination to side with the stockholders and Enr=
on employees, Mr. Reed said the president's mother-in-law should join inves=
tors who are suing Enron.=20
''The logical next step for the White House is to have the mother-in-law jo=
in this class-action suit,'' Mr. Reed said. ''That's the way to cement this=
 baby.''

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: FADING NEST EGGS
Labor Dept. Reviews Ban On Stock Sale
By JO THOMAS

01/24/2002
The New York Times
Page 6, Column 6
c. 2002 New York Times Company

HOUSTON, Jan. 23 -- The Labor Department is reviewing whether the Enron Cor=
poration acted properly when it told its employees they could not sell Enro=
n shares in their retirement accounts at a time when the shares' value was =
evaporating, agency officials said today.=20
Specifically, investigators are reviewing the actions of everyone who was r=
esponsible for administering the company's 401(k) retirement savings progra=
m.
Enron employees who were laid off after the company filed for bankruptcy la=
st month say in a class- action lawsuit that their rights were violated by =
a ''lockdown'' that prevented them from selling their shares after the comp=
any announced a third-quarter loss of $638 million, causing the stock to tu=
mble.=20
Ann L. Combs, the assistant secretary of labor in charge of the Pension and=
 Welfare Benefits Administration, which oversees and enforces federal laws =
governing employee pensions and health plans, said that 20,795 Enron employ=
ees held $2.1 billion in the company's 401(k) plan at the end of the year 2=
000, 63 percent of which was in Enron stock.=20
At that time, 7,600 people held another $1 billion worth of Enron stock as =
part of the employee stock ownership plan, Ms. Combs said, and 20,000 peopl=
e were enrolled in a defined-benefit pension plan, with assets of $270 mill=
ion that are federally guaranteed and not involved in the bankruptcy. Some =
employees could have belonged to more than one program.=20
''This investigation will take time,'' Ms. Combs said today. ''It involves =
collecting tens of thousands of documents, interviewing people, and trying =
to make sure we've nailed down all the facts.''=20
The secretary of labor, Elaine L. Chao, said her agency had begun investiga=
ting Enron two weeks before it filed for bankruptcy protection on Dec. 2, a=
nd she vowed today to do what she could to protect workers ''who have seen =
their retirement savings evaporate.''=20
Speaking at a briefing in Washington, linked by telephone to reporters acro=
ss the nation, Ms. Chao said she was working with Donald Evans, the commerc=
e secretary, and Paul H. O'Neill, the secretary of the Treasury, to recomme=
nd to President Bush changes in the laws that are intended to protect worke=
r benefits.=20
Her agency is looking into the possibility of civil and criminal violations=
 at Enron, she said.=20
Enron maintains that it sent letters to all employees on Oct. 4 -- 12 days =
before the third-quarter loss was announced -- saying accounts would be fro=
zen starting Oct. 29 while the administration of the plan was switched to a=
 new company. Enron says the change was planned for months and lasted only =
10 days, a period in which the stock fell $3.83.=20
But e-mail messages released by Eli Gottesdiener, a lawyer in Washington wh=
o represents some employees, include a Sept. 27 message to all employees sa=
ying that the lockdown would begin on Oct. 19 and last about a month. Mr. G=
ottesdiener has said that the e-mail message misled employees so that they =
did not sell shares in a week in which the stock fell $10.65. Enron shares,=
 which were above $90 in August 2000, are now worth less than 50 cents.=20
Ms. Combs said such freezes ''are very common'' when plans change recordkee=
pers. But those responsible are required to protect the participants and be=
neficiaries, she said.

Labor probes 401(k) lockdown=20
Officials look into blocked stock sales=20

Jan. 23, 2002, 10:04PM
WASHINGTON -- The Labor Department's probe into the Enron debacle has focus=
ed on a period when participants in the company's 401(k) retirement plan we=
re barred from selling their Enron stock, Labor Secretary Elaine Chao said =
Wednesday.=20
It is important, Chao said, that the government "protect Enron workers who =
have seen their retirement benefits evaporate."=20
Employees, ex-employees and retirees were unable to sell some of their Enro=
n shares for 10 days in late October and early November, at a time when the=
 stock price was nosediving.=20
The regulators' task will be to determine whether the company's decisions w=
hen handling the 401(k) plan were prudent and reasonable.=20
Enron spokesman Vance Meyer declined to comment on the department's investi=
gation, except to note that the company first notified the plan participant=
s in early October, 3 1/2 weeks before the "blackout" period.=20
Labor Department officials began looking into the company's collapse on Nov=
. 16, when regulators first became concerned Enron might be headed to bankr=
uptcy.=20
Labor officials would not say Wednesday when they expect to complete the pr=
obe, although Ann Combs, the assistant secretary for the Pension and Welfar=
e Benefits Administration noted: "This investigation will take some time."=
=20
Plan participants were blocked from selling their shares because Enron had =
hired a new administrator to handle the record-keeping for the retirement s=
avings plan.=20
The period -- also called a lockdown -- was supposed to facilitate a smooth=
 transition when Chicago-based Northern Trust Co. turned over records to th=
e new administrator, Lincolnshire, Ill.-based Hewitt Associates.=20
"It was a transition that was in the works for months," Meyer said.=20
Lockdowns are not uncommon when companies change plan administrators, Labor=
 officials said Wednesday.=20
On Oct. 4, 2001, Enron officials told employees the lockdown period would b=
egin on Sunday, Oct. 28, and continue until Nov. 20. But with the stock pri=
ce falling, Enron employees started pressing management to alter its plans.=
=20
In an e-mail to employees on Oct. 25, the company's benefits department not=
ed: "We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July. We und=
erstand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as=
 short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the plan=
 in total and your account in particular."=20
Company officials were able to cut short the transition period, although ma=
ny participants complained they received no notice that the blackout period=
 had been abbreviated.=20
Enron contributed stock amounting to 50 percent of the contributions each e=
mployee made to the plan, up to 6 percent of salary. Under the company's 40=
1(k) rules, only those employees aged 50 and over could sell those matching=
 shares.=20
During the lockdown period, no Enron stock in the 401(k) plan could be sold=
, even stock employees had bought on their own.=20
Some employees have complained they had their entire life savings invested =
in Enron stock and lost everything when the energy and trading giant tumble=
d into bankruptcy court.=20
At the end of 2000, nearly 21,000 current and former Enron employees partic=
ipated in the company's 401(k), the Labor Department said. About 63 percent=
 of the $1.6 billion worth of assets in the plan at that time were invested=
 in Enron stock, the vast majority of which were non-matching shares employ=
ees had purchased on their own.=20
Enron also offered two other retirement plans, a more traditional, defined-=
benefits pension plan and an employee stock-ownership plan.=20
At the end of 2000, about 20,000 current and former employees participated =
in the pension plan, with assets of about $270 million, none of it invested=
 in Enron shares.=20
About 7,650 were enrolled in the stock-ownership plan. At the end of 2000, =
their shares were worth about $1 billion.=20
Federal regulations require that companies offering traditional, defined-be=
nefit plans invest those funds in a diversified portfolio. No more than 10 =
percent of a plan's funds can be invested in a particular stock.=20
Congress, however, specifically excluded 401(k) employee contribution plans=
 from those rules. In the wake of the Enron debacle, lawmakers now are cons=
idering whether to force employees to diversify their 401(k) portfolios as =
well.=20
Also on Tuesday, a group of Enron employees filed suit in federal court in =
Houston accusing a slate of Enron executives, as well as the accounting fir=
m Arthur Andersen, Enron's outside auditor, of racketeering.=20
By conspiring to hide Enron's true financial position, the suit alleges, th=
e Enron executives and Andersen caused employees to lose their retirement f=
unds.=20
A group of four Enron employees first filed suit last fall. On Tuesday, ano=
ther 96 employees added their names to that complaint and raised the racket=
eering allegations for the first time.=20
The employees are hoping to have their case certified as a class action.=20
Steve Berman, an attorney representing the employees, said the workers coul=
d not sue Enron itself, since the corporation has already sought protection=
 from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.=20
Among those named in the suit are Enron Chairman Ken Lay, who resigned Wedn=
esday, former CEO Jeffrey Skilling and former Chief Financial Officer Andre=
w Fastow. The suit also names David Duncan, Andersen's lead partner on the =
Enron account.=20
Meyer declined to comment on the suit. A spokesman for Andersen declined im=
mediate comment.=20
A hearing in the case is scheduled for Feb. 25.=20

WASHINGTON -- Until recently, the flood of millions of working people into =
the stock market, principally through their retirement accounts, was hailed=
 as evidence that Americans at all economic levels can make it on their own=
.=20
Then Enron Corp. collapsed, throwing thousands out of work and destroying t=
he retirement nest eggs of thousands more. While investigators search for c=
lues of foul play, Washington is rushing in with legislative fixes--includi=
ng proposals to limit how much company stock can go into retirement account=
s.
For many, it is too late. The collapse of Enron's retirement arrangements i=
s only the latest in a series of similar financial fiascoes during the last=
 decade. But hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of Americans continue=
 to shoulder the same kinds of risk borne by Enron workers before their sav=
ings evaporated.=20
"We're fooling ourselves if we think Enron is a scandal that doesn't have a=
nything to do with the rest of us," said Norman P. Stein, a member of the L=
abor Department's employee retirement advisory council and a University of =
Alabama law professor. "What happened to Enron workers could happen to you.=
"=20
The reason is a sea change in how Americans make financial provisions for t=
heir old age. Working people have turned the stock market into their retire=
ment system, and themselves, rather than their corporate employers, into re=
tirement money managers.=20
Individuals are now responsible for making the basic investment decisions f=
or half the nation's non-Social Security retirement savings, rather than ha=
ving those decisions made the old-fashioned way--by employers who promise b=
enefits no matter what.=20
That is up from a little more than one-third in the early 1990s. Individual=
s, together with big institutions, have pumped more than two-thirds of the =
nation's $10 trillion-plus in public and private retirement savings into st=
ocks.=20
So when the stock market takes off, as it did in the late 1990s, so does Am=
erica's retirement system. And when it tumbles, as it has in the last two y=
ears, so do retirement savings.=20
"We have a system that has succeeded in amassing a formidable pool of capit=
al and providing retirement benefits to millions of people," said J. Mark I=
wry, who as benefits tax counsel for the Treasury Department until last yea=
r was one of the most powerful regulators of the retirement system in Washi=
ngton.=20
"On the other hand, the self-direction of investments has shifted the risk =
of retirement investment from employers to employees, and many workers have=
 ended up assuming imprudent amounts of it."=20
They often have done so without even knowing what they did.=20
Retirees Look Back at Costly Errors=20
Bill Quinlin certainly didn't.=20
The 65-year-old Robstown, Texas, resident retired from Enron several years =
ago, after nearly three decades as a gas pipeline operator, to care for his=
 dying mother. He had nearly all his retirement savings, save a small pensi=
on and Social Security, in 25,000 shares of Enron stock.=20
When the stock was at its height at better than $80 a share and Quinlin was=
 a paper millionaire, a friend suggested he sell some of his holdings.=20
But Quinlin said he could not bring himself to do it, largely because the p=
lace was being run by Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's longtime chairman, who resign=
ed late Wednesday.=20
Lay had saved a utility where Quinlin once worked. And the executive had co=
me down every year or so while Quinlin was at the Corpus Christi pump stati=
on to take the men out for barbecue.=20
"I thought that guy walked on water," Quinlin said recently of Lay. "Why, i=
f he walked in here this minute, I'd probably sit right down and talk to hi=
m." Quinlin's shares have gone from being worth about $2 million to a coupl=
e of thousand.=20
Roger Boyce said he didn't understand the risks he was shouldering either, =
even though he is sophisticated in financial matters.=20
The 67-year-old Minneapolis-area resident retired from Enron in March 2000 =
after almost two decades as a benefits executive and another decade as a sa=
fety and security manager.=20
Boyce said he was well aware that the world of retirement savings was chang=
ing when Enron stopped offering old-fashioned pensions in the late 1980s an=
d replaced them with plans such as 401(k) accounts, to which it contributed=
 fixed amounts of stock, but made no promise of what benefits employees cou=
ld expect when they retired.=20
"I knew I had to manage these accounts, and I was aware the best protection=
 was diversification" out of Enron stock and into other stocks and mutual f=
unds, he said.=20
But Boyce ended up pumping about two-thirds of his retirement savings into =
Enron because of the company's rapidly rising stock. In any case, he reason=
ed, with the company in so many lines of business it represented a diversif=
ied investment all on its own. Even if one business line failed, another wo=
uld take its place.=20
"I know a normal person's question is: 'How stupid could you be?' " But it =
was difficult to resist, he said.=20
Like Quinlin, Boyce saw his Enron stock tumble almost $2 million in value. =
He and his wife, Marilyn, have been forced to scrap the idea of setting up =
trusts for their six grandchildren.=20
"It's very tough to swallow," he said.=20
It used to be that employees relied for retirement income on pensions in wh=
ich employers managed the funds, promised retirees a "defined benefit" and =
kept excess profits or losses to themselves. The shift to 401(k)s, IRAs and=
 employee stock ownership plans--in which employee contributions are define=
d but benefits are left to market forces--is usually portrayed as part of a=
 titanic struggle between an old, dying, paternalistic, industrial order an=
d a new, freedom-filled, entrepreneurial economy. And, in part, it has been=
 just that.=20
"When we first tried to sell the idea of the 401(k) to Bethlehem Steel in 1=
981, they said, 'You don't understand; it's part of our culture to take car=
e of our people,' " recounted Ted Benna, a Bellefonte, Pa., consultant who =
is widely considered the "father of the 401(k)."=20
"That paternalistic attitude has been blown away" by new technology, global=
ization and Reaganite politics, he said.=20
The only problem with the old-versus-new portrayal is that it overlooks two=
 crucial facts. The first, as even Benna will concede, is that 401(k)s and =
similar accounts were not originally intended to replace traditional pensio=
ns and grew in a piecemeal fashion. The second is that it was government ta=
x subsidies, as much as market forces and individual choice, that produced =
the new accounts. According to a variety of regulators and lawmakers, that =
gives Washington a big responsibility for making sure they are run well.=20
"Society has a lot riding on people's retirement savings," said Sen. Barbar=
a Boxer (D-Calif.), who co-sponsored legislation to restrict the proportion=
 of company stock such as Enron's in retirement accounts. "We're paying for=
 them with big tax breaks."=20
Indeed, the tax break for pensions and retirement savings is the very bigge=
st that Washington offers, topping such giants as the mortgage interest ded=
uction and the employer tax exclusion for employee health insurance, and am=
ounting to about $100 billion a year.=20
"Uncle Sam is the largest single investor in the retirement system and has =
a legitimate interest in how it works," said Iwry, the former Treasury offi=
cial.=20
Only it didn't work in the case of Enron. And, according to critics, it cou=
ld fail in the same way at some of the nation's other big companies.=20
In the investment world and at the casino, putting most of your chips on on=
e color--or most of your money in one stock--is a gamble.=20
Before the fall, fully 60% of the money in Enron's 401(k) plan was in Enron=
 stock. But that hardly qualified the company for the top slot when it come=
s to packing retirement plans with company stock.=20
At consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble, the portion of P&G stock in the u=
nusually generous retirement plans exceeds 90%, according to D.C. Plan Inve=
sting, a financial newsletter. At Coca-Cola and General Electric, it is abo=
ut 80%. At McDonald's and Home Depot, it is just below 75%.=20
"The single-largest source of excessive risk for employees in retirement pl=
ans is undue concentration in employer stock," Iwry said.=20
Investment Industry Balks at Reform Efforts=20
Most congressional proposals for what to do about the problem run along one=
 of two lines: imposing limits on the amount of company stock allowed in pl=
ans or encouraging more investor education. Key critics, including 401(k) i=
nventor Benna, say that neither will work. In the case of stock limits, eve=
n some of the authors concede the measure falls far short of what is needed=
.=20
Boxer and Sen. Jon Corzine (D-N.J.) want to impose a 20% cap on company sto=
ck and reduce the tax break that companies would get when they contributed =
stock instead of cash. A similar House bill would reduce the cap to 10%.=20
Both proposals have met with howls of protest from the investment industry,=
 which argues that individuals should have the right to invest their money =
as they see fit.=20
Boxer is well acquainted with the argument; many of the same objections wer=
e raised when the California Democrat tried to win similar restrictions aft=
er floor retailer ColorTile Inc. went bankrupt five years ago, wiping out e=
mployees' 401(k) savings. Her measure was eventually so watered down it mad=
e almost no difference.=20
By contrast, the investment industry enthusiastically supports a bill by Re=
p. John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) that would encourage companies and 401(k) provi=
ders such as mutual fund groups to offer education and financial advice by =
limiting their liability if their advice turns out to be bad.=20
Boehner acknowledged that his measure could pave the way for conflicts of i=
nterest such as mutual funds advising employees to buy the fund's products.=
 But he said the danger could be limited by requiring that the conflicts be=
 disclosed. He asserted that there were no parallels with Enron and others =
encouraging workers to invest in the companies' own stock.=20
"The lesson of Enron is diversify, diversify, diversify," Boehner said. "Wh=
at we've got to do is get that across to people by giving them broader know=
ledge and access to advice." Critics say the Boehner bill is an invitation =
for trouble.=20
Old-fashioned "defined benefit" plans follow diversification rules that go =
beyond company stock and a requirement that retirement savings be converted=
 to an annuity, or fixed annual payment, when people retire to ensure that =
they don't outlive their own finances and end up in poverty.=20
To date, no lawmakers, even sharp critics, have publicly proposed giving th=
e same kind of protections to 401(k)s and the "defined contribution" world.=
=20
The reason is clear: Such restrictions would fly in the face of the individ=
ual choice that has made 401(k)s so popular.=20
But there are signs that some people are beginning to move in that directio=
n.=20
Corzine, for example, said last week that the cap he and Boxer are proposin=
g for company stock should be extended to all assets in 401(k) plans so tha=
t individuals could not put more than 20% of their retirement savings in an=
y one investment. Benna is pushing a plan to give companies new protections=
 against employee lawsuits over retirement accounts if firms agree to effec=
tively direct employees' investment options to a few prearranged diversifie=
d portfolios.=20
"Nobody likes to say it, but people who don't know the difference between s=
tocks and bonds are being asked to pick particular ones," said Stein, the A=
labama law professor. "People are being given too many decisions to make."=
=20
During the late 1990s when the stock market was climbing 20% and 30% a year=
, such views would have been dismissed out of hand. But with stocks stumbli=
ng, the country under assault and polls showing Americans increasingly conc=
erned about "personal security," some believe there is a chance for change.

How to Predict The Next Fiasco In Accounting And Bail Early
By Cassell Bryan-Low and Jeff D. Opdyke
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

So you're not a Wall Street analyst or professional short seller. Still, yo=
u do have some tools at hand for avoiding being caught in a stock that suff=
ers an accounting blowup.=20
While the highly publicized accounting problems at collapsed energy-trading=
 firm Enron are just the latest in a series of corporate accounting scandal=
s, there are numerous warning signs that skeptical investors use to protect=
 their money, and some are straightforward enough for individual investors =
to follow.
"After Enron, investors realize they have to question every financial state=
ment they get," says Murray Stahl, director of research at Horizon Research=
, a New York investment-research firm. If nothing else, the Enron debacle "=
will make the issue of accounting very important in the future."=20
Short sellers -- bearish investors who try to profit from a stock's decline=
 by selling borrowed shares in hopes of replacing them with shares bought l=
ater at a lower price -- see no shortage of occasions where their hard-nose=
d approach to financial analysis will come in handy. Thanks to factors such=
 as stock incentives for executives and auditors collecting fees for consul=
ting, "accounting now is worse that it ever has been," says Marc Cohodes, a=
 partner at Rocker Partners, a New York hedge fund.=20
Here are some red flags that such professional investors watch out for to g=
uard against potential trouble down the road:=20

Invoices Increasing, Sales Slipping: If a company's accounts receivables ar=
e growing faster than sales, that signals some concerns about the quality o=
f the sales. Among other things, swelling accounts receivable could indicat=
e "channel stuffing," or overselling to distributors to pad short-term fina=
ncial results.=20
Similarly, if inventories are growing faster than sales, that could signal =
a company isn't able to sell inventory as quickly as originally believed. D=
epending on the type of inventory, there might be the added risk of the inv=
entory becoming obsolete, resulting in write-downs.=20
In 1998, Sunbeam, a maker of household consumer products, restated earnings=
 downward for six previous quarters. The company, which had seen a surge in=
 accounts receivable, acknowledged that the original revenue had been prema=
turely booked, and it cited a variety of other accounting moves that were n=
ecessary to restate. Sunbeam had inflated sales of such things as barbecue =
grills by offering retailers low prices and easy cancellation terms, promis=
ing, say, to hold the grills in Sunbeam's warehouses for later delivery.=20
Dubbed a "massive financial fraud" by the Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n, the company filed for bankruptcy reorganization in February 2001.=20

Concentrate on Cash: The cash-flow statement tracks all the changes that af=
fect a company's cash position, be it cash flowing in from debt and stock o=
fferings, or cash flowing out in the form of dividends. It can also serve a=
s an indicator of potential chicanery inside a company's accounting.=20
A telltale sign of trouble is negative cash flow from operations while the =
company's so-called Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation a=
nd amortization) is positive. Short sellers note that in such a case, a com=
pany could be using accounting gimmickry to make its business look healthie=
r than it really is. If operating cash flow is negative, in reality the com=
pany is consuming cash rather than generating it, as its Ebitda figure woul=
d suggest.=20

Risky Returns: At the end of the day, what makes a stock move is its return=
 on capital -- how much profit a company generates off the assets it employ=
s, such as its cash, inventories and property, plants and equipment.=20
Most financial statements break apart a company's operations to show invest=
ors which segments generated which portion of sales and profits. By isolati=
ng individual segment returns, says one short-selling analyst, investors ca=
n determine where earnings are coming from and whether they seem fishy. A f=
ew simple calculations can reveal a lot.=20
Consider Mirant, an energy peer of Enron. As part of its balance sheet, the=
 Atlanta company shows assets and liabilities "from risk management activit=
ies," both current and noncurrent. Subtract the liabilities from the assets=
, the analyst notes, and Mirant has $80 million of equity in that business.=
 As part of the footnote attached to those balance-sheet items, Mirant note=
d that it generated essentially $221 million off those assets during the th=
ird quarter.=20
That kind of stunning return, about 275%, is hard for any company to sustai=
n, raising questions about the likelihood that such strong performance can =
be maintained indefinitely. The same analysis shows the other segments had =
far more humble returns. A Mirant financial expert wasn't available to comm=
ent.=20

It's All Relative: Often, a company's financial statements will include a "=
related-party transactions" section, pointing to dealings with its own offi=
cers or related companies. Maybe the company has loaned money to its office=
rs to buy company stock, or cash to an affiliate to buy products from the c=
ompany.=20
Either way, investors should be aware of the potential pitfalls. Some short=
 sellers say these dealings can signal that a company thinks of corporate c=
ash as belonging to management and not the shareholders, and thus is more f=
reewheeling with it than a more conservative company is. Enron may be a cas=
e in point; its downward spiral into bankruptcy-court protection started as=
 investors focused on nettlesome related-party transactions involving the t=
hen-chief financial officer.=20

Recurring Nonrecurring Charges: Another red flag, according to Nathaniel Gu=
ild, a partner at Short Alert, a research firm in Charlotte, N.C., is the p=
ractice of repeatedly labeling restructuring and other charges as "nonrecur=
ring," "one-time" or "unusual," when they aren't truly one-off expenses. Be=
cause most analysts ignore such charges in their earnings models, this can =
create a cloud of smoke that obscures the company's true earnings power. "Y=
ou can write off anything, in any fashion," Mr. Guild maintains. "There is =
very little regulation in that area."=20

Consult the Consulting Fees: The case of Enron also has focused the spotlig=
ht on the issue of auditor independence. Thanks to new rules introduced by =
the Securities and Exchange Commission, companies now are required to discl=
ose how much they pay their auditors not just for auditing, but for nonaudi=
ting work as well. The question investors should ask themselves, says Rocke=
r Partners' Mr. Cohodes, is how independent an auditing firm can be that is=
 getting paid as much or more for consulting services as it is for auditing=
. "It is a huge conflict," he contends. In the Enron example, the company i=
n 2000 paid Arthur Andersen $25 million in audit fees and $27 million for n=
onaudit work, including consulting.=20

Army Secretary Thomas E. White, the highest-ranking Bush administration off=
icial to come from Enron Corp., has told colleagues in the administration t=
hat he suffered "significant personal losses" as he sold his Enron stock to=
 comply with his government ethics agreement, according to a letter release=
d yesterday.=20
The Jan. 22 letter, which White wrote in response to a query by Rep. Henry =
A. Waxman (D-Calif.), was released by Waxman's office.
In the letter, White listed sales of 405,710 shares of stock between June 1=
3 and Oct. 30 at prices ranging from $50 to $12.85 a share. Though the sale=
s yielded $12.1 million, he said he told Secretary of State Colin L. Powell=
 and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld that he "had suffered significant=
 personal losses, but . . . would persevere."=20
Among administration officials, White had by far the largest holdings in En=
ron stock and stock options. The financial disclosure form he filed last sp=
ring revealed that he held $25 million to $50 million in stock and a simila=
r amount in options at that time. Bush senior adviser Karl Rove and Charlot=
te Beers, undersecretary of state for public diplomacy, reported the next h=
ighest holdings: $100,000 to $250,000. The government requires disclosure o=
nly within broad ranges.=20
White took office May 31. According to an agreement he signed and filed wit=
h the Office of Government Ethics, he pledged to divest himself of his Enro=
n stock and options within 90 days.=20
In an interview yesterday, he said that he had sought and received an exten=
sion, which expired Nov. 20, and that he has sold all his Enron stock. In h=
is letter to Waxman, he said he had renounced his options.=20
White spent 11 years as an Enron official, leaving last spring as vice chai=
rman of Enron Energy Services. His salary, according to his disclosure form=
, was $5.5 million a year. He also reported that, at the time he filed his =
disclosure, he owned a condo in Aspen, Colo., worth $5 million to $25 milli=
on and a similarly valued condo in Naples, Fla. According to property recor=
ds, he currently owns a waterfront penthouse in Georgetown that he bought f=
or $5.5 million last June.=20
When White left Enron, he received a $1 million severance payment and $13 m=
illion in payment for stock appreciation rights, also known as "phantom sto=
ck."=20
"We appreciate Secretary White providing the information," said Waxman, ran=
king minority member of the House Government Reform Committee. "We intend t=
o review it.=20
In his letter, White also said that he had had "brief" conversations with P=
owell on Dec. 12 and with Rumsfeld on Nov. 10. Both men were concerned only=
 with the impact Enron's bankruptcy would have on his "personal well-being,=
" he said.=20
White also said that he had had 29 phone conversations or meetings with Enr=
on Chairman Kenneth L. Lay and other Enron officials beginning last June, b=
ut that at no time was he asked to intervene on behalf of the failing compa=
ny.=20
In an interview yesterday, White said that he thought Enron's collapse was =
a tragedy. "I worked there for 11 years, and I have a good many dear friend=
s that were a part of the corporation that I got to know well," he said. "T=
he economic damage done to them and their wives and their families is tragi=
c. So that's where my principal concern is."=20

Accounting for Enron: Bush's Plan to Name Accounting Veterans To SEC Raises=
 Some Eyebrows in Congress
By Scot J. Paltrow
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

01/24/2002
The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

President Bush's plan for a Securities and Exchange Commission dominated --=
 for the first time ever -- by commissioners with close ties to the account=
ing industry is raising concerns in Congress in the wake of Enron Corp.'s c=
ollapse.=20
The accounting failures that helped precipitate the collapse have made refo=
rm of accounting-industry oversight the biggest issue immediately facing th=
e SEC.
But if the president's previously announced plans are fully carried out, th=
ree of the five SEC commissioners will be individuals with close profession=
al ties to Big 5 accounting firms. Yesterday, the president made a recess a=
ppointment of two commissioners, including Cynthia A. Glassman, a principal=
 at Ernst & Young LLP. His nomination in December of Paul Atkins, a lawyer =
and partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers, to a seat on the commission is still=
 pending in the Senate. SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt, who took office last year=
, until then was an attorney for all the Big 5 firms as well as the industr=
y's main trade association, the American Institute of Public Accountants.=
=20
Even without the eventual approval of Mr. Atkins, Mr. Pitt and Ms. Glassman=
 together will make a majority for the time being, as there are two vacanci=
es remaining on the commission. The only other sitting commissioner is Isaa=
c Hunt, a holdover from the Clinton administration, who became Mr. Bush's s=
econd recess appointee yesterday.=20
The recess appointment, made while Congress isn't in session, enabled the p=
resident to bypass the usual process of Senate approval. Ms. Glassman will =
be able to serve until the end of this year. The move drew swift condemnati=
on from Democrats in the House and Senate, even though the White House soug=
ht to blunt criticism by pairing the move with the recess reappointment of =
Mr. Hunt, a Democrat.=20
People close to the Senate Banking Committee say the Atkins nomination is i=
ncreasingly likely to face close scrutiny and potential opposition because =
of his ties to the industry.=20
A spokesman for Sen. Jon Corzine (D., N.J.), former co-Chief Executive of G=
oldman Sachs and a member of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs =
Committee that will vote on the Atkins nomination, said the senator faulted=
 the administration for bypassing the hearing process for Ms. Glassman's ap=
pointment. He said Sen. Corzine "has concerns about putting on the board th=
is concentration of people who have the same background, especially since t=
he chairman himself was a lawyer representing the accounting industry."=20
The timing of the president's choices is putting the White House in an unco=
mfortable position as new disclosures have been made almost daily about aud=
its of Enron by Arthur Andersen LLP and shortcomings in accounting regulati=
on. Anne Womack, White House press secretary, said the president is going a=
head with his choices and denied that he has any desire to pack the commiss=
ion with industry partisans.=20
Ms. Womack said [Ms.] Glassman "has an extensive background as an economist=
" and with the Federal Reserve Board, in addition to her five years most re=
cently with Ernst & Young. Mr. Atkins "has experience with accounting firm =
but also has served on SEC before," she said, and Mr. Pitt, she continued, =
"brings a legal background. Put these things together and you represent all=
 the relevant disciplines that come before and are affected by SEC."=20
The White House said it made the recess appointments because the large numb=
er of vacancies on the commission made it imperative to get a commissioner =
in place at least temporarily.=20
But several prominent experts on the SEC said the president's moves are sur=
prising in view of the Enron developments. Alan R. Bromberg, professor of s=
ecurities law at Southern Methodist University in Dallas said, "It's very q=
uestionable in my mind," adding "It looks me like life is going to be a lot=
 easier for accountants with this commission."=20
Ms. Glassman and Mr. Atkins weren't available for comment. An Ernst & Young=
 spokesman said the firm played no role in suggesting Ms. Glassman's nomina=
tion to the White House, adding, "She's not going there to represent us in =
any way."

Accounting for Enron: Insurance Companies Cut Sales Of Once-Plentiful Suret=
y Bonds
By Christopher Oster
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

01/24/2002
The Wall Street Journal
A8
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A combination of a weak economy, Enron Corp.'s problems and significant los=
ses from the Sept. 11 terrorist strikes have led the insurance industry to =
sharply reduce sales of once-plentiful and cheap surety bonds. Rates on man=
y of the bonds they still do sell have soared 50% to 1,000%, analysts said.=
=20
Surety bonds are issued by insurers to companies that want to guarantee per=
formance or payment in a business transaction, to assure the companies' bus=
iness partners that the concerns will complete the transactions. Without th=
at assurance, some business grinds to a halt.
The insurance industry's unwillingness to issue surety bonds is hitting har=
dest those businesses that themselves are being hit by the recession. A pri=
me example is Kmart Corp., which cited its inability to secure such bonds a=
t a reasonable price as a factor leading to its decision to file this week =
for bankruptcy-court protection. Kmart used surety bonds to guarantee the p=
ayment of claims under its workers' compensation insurance program, as well=
 as other liabilities that the company self-insured against.=20
But insurers are less willing to provide surety bonds to these companies fo=
r such purposes because of the heightened risk, in a sluggish economy, that=
 the companies will need to draw on them.=20
"When you go into a recession, companies are going to go into default," sai=
d Don Watson, managing director at Standard & Poor's insurance ratings grou=
p. Mr. Watson expects companies with deteriorating credit quality to have a=
n increasingly hard time obtaining surety bonds, which many consider vital =
to continuing business.=20
The property-casualty insurance industry is unwilling to extend itself beca=
use it is sitting atop claims from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks that are =
expected to top $40 billion, or about one-fourth of the capital base of com=
mercial property-casualty insurers. A company's capital base is particularl=
y important in the surety-bond business because regulators require large am=
ounts of capital to back such bonds.=20
On top of this, the bankruptcy-court filing by energy-trading firm Enron la=
te last year could lead to potentially large payouts on surety bonds that w=
ere in place to guarantee the supply of oil and natural gas by Enron to var=
ious parties. Several insurers have announced exposure to Enron losses, inc=
luding Chubb Corp., which said it has $220 million of such exposure.=20
In a recent report, insurance broker Willis Group Holdings Ltd. said insura=
nce companies are "more likely to allocate capital to property-casualty lin=
es of business that present the prospect for higher returns" than do surety=
 bonds. The report notes that the availability of surety bonds for self-ins=
urance and other types of financial guarantees "will be severely curtailed,=
 if written in the market at all." In the past year alone, the number of su=
rety reinsurers has dropped to 12 from 16. Several primary surety-bond writ=
ers have exited the business.=20
Like nearly all lines of property-casualty insurance, surety-bond prices fe=
ll in the 1990s as insurers competed fiercely for premium dollars. Underwri=
ting became lax because in some cases claims might not be paid for years an=
d insurers assumed they could turn a profit by investing the premiums in th=
e soaring stock market.=20
"The business had gotten very cheap," said Mark Reagan, chief executive of =
the construction practice of broker Willis Group Holdings Ltd. Underwriting=
 manuals suggest premiums of $20 per $1,000. But "companies were getting bo=
nds for $1.25 for $1,000 of coverage."=20
The most obvious impact will be on the construction industry. Contractors b=
uy surety bonds to ensure the completion of their work. "It's going to furt=
her limit or inhibit commercial property development, which will be a furth=
er drag on the economy," said S&P's Mr. Watson.

Accounting for Enron: Pension Funds, Not Lawyers, Drive Holder Suits
By Richard B. Schmitt
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

01/24/2002
The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Lawyers for Enron Corp. shareholders marched into a Houston court with grea=
t show this week with a box full of shredded documents carted out of Enron =
headquarters by an ex-employee.=20
The disclosure made good theater, but it also reflects a little-noticed cha=
nge in the world of shareholder litigation. Such suits were once driven by =
lawyers who raced to the courthouse to be first to file so they could contr=
ol the case and collect the biggest fees. Now, the suits are being driven b=
y pension funds, like the one administered by the Regents of the University=
 of California that hopes to become the lead plaintiff in the Enron shareho=
lder case.
As a condition of hiring their lawyers, the Regents required that Milberg W=
eiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach commit dozens of lawyers, investigators and for=
ensic accountants, among others, to the case. "They demanded a level of att=
ention that is unprecedented," said Darren Robbins, a Milberg Weiss partner=
 in San Diego.=20
The result: Milberg Weiss, a firm that was once widely criticized by busine=
ss groups for doing little work on behalf of shareholders, has done 100 int=
erviews with potential witnesses and hired dozens of professionals to pore =
over evidence it has collected -- all before a judge even decides whether t=
he firm's client will be named lead plaintiff and it will get the job of le=
ad lawyer.=20
Ironically, all this has come about because of a 1995 law aimed at putting =
the likes of Milberg Weiss on a short leash. Previously, under class-action=
 rules, practically any investor who lost money in a stock could be a plain=
tiff. The result was a system that some companies viewed as legalized extor=
tion, where they settled even nuisance claims to avoid the costs of litigat=
ion. The law changed the game by boosting the needed proof in such cases an=
d by giving investors with the largest losses first crack at controlling th=
em.=20
Now, the lawyers are having to be salesmen, courting new business, with glo=
ssy presentations at institutional-investor conferences and competing in be=
auty contests staged by the investors to pick lawyers. "They are in hot pur=
suit of these clients," said Richard Koppes, former general counsel of the =
California Public Employees' Retirement System and currently a lawyer in th=
e Sacramento, Calif., office of Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue. "It is a new ma=
rket for them, and they recognize that."=20
Shareholder litigation was new terrain for the California Regents, which de=
spite managing $54 billion in pension assets, had never headed up a big sec=
urities-fraud action before. That changed when it lost nearly $145 million =
investing in Enron.=20
The two sides hooked up after the university treasurer heard a presentation=
 by Milberg Weiss partner William Lerach at an invitation-only investor con=
ference. Officials invited Mr. Lerach to make a pitch for the Enron suit at=
 a private meeting last month. Several other firms also made unsolicited bi=
ds for the work. "The university came to believe that Milberg Weiss had the=
 resources and the will to make a substantial rather than a symbolic recove=
ry," said Lloyd Lee, a lawyer for the university in Oakland.=20
Some class-action specialists say the involvement of large investors will m=
ake it more difficult for defendants like officers and directors of Enron t=
o resolve cases. "Plaintiffs' lawyers used to settle pretty quickly," said =
Tracy Nichols, a partner with Holland & Knight in Miami. "Now, they have an=
 institutional client looking over their shoulders, saying, `How hard are y=
ou going to push for me?"'

Dynegy Inc. said fourth-quarter profit rose 36%, partly boosted by electric=

Profit from operations climbed to $144 million, or 41 cents a share, from n=
et income of $106 million, or 32 cents, a year earlier. Revenue fell 13% to=
 $8.74 billion.
Dynegy's power sales more than doubled last quarter from a year earlier, an=
d costs from canceling its bid for rival Enron were less than expected, exe=
cutives said. Dynegy's stock gained after earnings matched analyst estimate=
s, rising $1.25, or 5.4%, to $24.55 on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares =
fell 26% last quarter and had dropped 54% in the last year.=20
Dynegy's trading and marketing profit rose 58% last quarter from a year ear=
lier, boosted by business from customers trying to lock in gas and electric=
ity prices. North American gas sales rose 14%.=20
Dynegy wrote off $51 million, or 14 cents a share, in the quarter for its t=
rading business with Enron, which filed for bankruptcy last month. Other co=
sts included $7 million, or 2 cents a share, to end its bid for Enron in No=
vember and $9 million, or 3 cents, for severance costs related to its Illin=
ois electric utility. That made net income $77 million, or 21 cents a share=
.=20
The company had said Enron costs might reach $125 million. Dynegy will pay =
a $65-million dividend over two years to Chevron Texaco Corp. for its parti=
cipation in the Enron bid.=20
ChevronTexaco owns 27% of Dynegy and provided $1.5 billion to Dynegy for it=

 Costs Related to Enron

HOUSTON -- Dynegy Inc.'s fourth-quarter net income fell 27%, hurt by exposu=
re of its energy trading operations to fallen rival Enron Corp., as well as=
 acquisition-related costs including its aborted acquisition of Enron late =
last year.=20
Dynegy posted net income of $77 million, or 21 cents a share, compared with=
 $106 million, or 32 cents a share, a year earlier.
The results were depressed by a $78 million pretax charge stemming from ene=
rgy trading deals with Enron, which filed for bankruptcy-court protection i=
n December. In addition, Dynegy took a $10 million pretax charge for costs =
related to its canceled $9 billion acquisition of Enron. Restructuring at D=
ynegy's Illinois Power Co. unit resulted in a $15 million pretax charge, wh=
ile merger-related costs from the February 2000 acquisition of Illinova Cor=
p. also came to $15 million. A special dividend associated with stock issue=
d to ChevronTexaco Corp. in November cost $3 million.=20
Revenue dropped 13% to $8.74 billion from $10 billion.=20
Still, Dynegy said the quarter benefited from strong earnings from its whol=
esale energy network segment, led by increases in North American gas volume=
 and total power sold. The company noted, however, that its liquids and tra=
nsmission and distribution segments were hurt by mild weather and the econo=
my.=20
After excluding nonrecurring items, Dynegy said its earnings amounted to 41=
 cents a share -- in line with analysts' expectations as reported by Thomso=

nergy delivery network is capable of generating solid earnings even in the =
most turbulent market environment," said UBS Warburg analyst Jay Yannello.=

Congress Fought Changes to Accounting Rules Over Past Decade

WASHINGTON -- As Congress opens a slew of hearings about Enron Corp.'s coll=
apse, outraged lawmakers who are pointing fingers about bad accounting migh=
t well beware of fingers pointing right back.=20
House and Senate interrogators are questioning how the energy-trading compa=
ny's financial mess could escape auditors' detection. But they shoulder som=
e of the blame: Congress, including some of Enron's most vocal critics ther=
e, routinely opposed significant new accounting rules over the past decade.
Lynn Turner, head of Colorado State University's Center for Quality Financi=
al Reporting and a former chief accountant at the Securities and Exchange C=
ommission, cites several attempts to improve accounting standards throughou=
t the 1990s that Congress fought. One effort, in particular, would have str=
engthened the authority of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, an ind=
ependent rule-making body.=20
The standards board has come under blistering attacks each time from compan=
ies who press Congress not to require new accounting disclosures. "Pressure=
s from some members of Congress have unfortunately led to compromises that =
I don't believe were always in the interest of investors," Mr. Turner says.=
=20
Some prominent past critics of the standards board are playing a different =
tune. Beyond zeroing in on Enron's own longtime auditor, Arthur Andersen LL=
P, Congress intends to explore whether to toughen requirements for how comp=
anies are audited and what information must be disclosed to investors.=20
Consider Rep. Richard Baker, the Louisiana Republican who chairs a House su=
bcommittee on capital markets, securities and government-sponsored enterpri=
ses. At a hearing last month, Mr. Baker asked an SEC official whether "we n=
eed better disclosure or accounting standards that give investors the real =
picture?" And later, expressing dismay about Enron's misleading disclosures=
, he asked Andersen's chief executive, Joseph Berardino, if authorities nee=
d to impose penalties for improper disclosure "so severe that it ain't wort=
h the risk?"=20
Yet Mr. Baker was a strong opponent of a standards board proposal, that rec=
ently was approved, that requires companies to better disclose their use of=
 derivatives; those are investments pegged to the underlying value of asset=
s, such as commodities or currencies. The standard board's new rules seek t=
o ensure that corporate financial statements accurately reflect those risks=
.=20
Mr. Baker called hearings about the proposal after banking regulators and i=
ndustry groups objected that the standards board hadn't adequately consider=
ed earnings volatility that the derivatives disclosure might cause for comp=
anies -- particularly banks, the biggest users of derivatives.=20
When the standards board pressed ahead, Mr. Baker introduced a bill to allo=
w public companies to object to proposed accounting principles in federal c=
ourt. He described his proposal "as a legislative remedy to a flaw in the p=
rivate sector process for developing financial accounting standards."=20
Though the Baker bill was unsuccessful, the pressure from Congress led the =
standards board to issue new, less stringent disclosure standards, which ha=
ve recently taken effect. "Rep. Baker plans to address existing accounting =
problems," Rep. Baker's spokesman, Michael DiResto, said yesterday.=20
The SEC, which oversees the standards board, also has frequently been caugh=
t in a cross-fire from Congress, which it has complained makes it harder to=
 impose needed regulations. The derivatives proposal, for instance, sparked=
 a row about the independence of the standard board's standard-setting proc=
ess -- and in particular about whether the SEC and former SEC Chairman Arth=
ur Levitt improperly pushed the proposal forward.=20
Sen. Phil Gramm, the lead Republican and former chairman of the Senate Bank=
ing Committee and a frequent critic of the standards board and the SEC, acc=
used Mr. Levitt of telling business representatives not to testify before C=
ongress on the derivatives issue. A Senate official later retracted his all=
egation. Mr. Gramm, a Texas Republican and the Senate's second-largest reci=
pient of Enron political contributions, has said he will skip any Enron-rel=
ated hearings; his wife was on Enron's auditing board.=20
In a 1997 speech, Mr. Levitt said he found the attacks on the standards boa=
rd's process and its proposals "alarming." He added, "Critics are focusing =
too much on lobbying the decision-making process and not enough on thoughtf=
ul, substantive input into that process."=20
Sen. Joseph Lieberman, the Connecticut Democrat who chairs the Senate Gover=
nmental Affairs Committee, opens a hearing today into Enron's collapse. Amo=
ng the questions he says he is probing: "Why did Enron's auditors allow the=
 company to overstate its profits for four years by over a half a billion d=
ollars, using what now appear to be very questionable accounting practices?=
"=20
But Mr. Lieberman, the former Democratic vice-presidential nominee and a 20=
04 presidential prospect, is a longtime critic of the accounting board, and=
 he has rallied opposition to its proposed rules more than once. Recently, =
he challenged one to overhaul the accounting for corporate mergers and acqu=
isitions, an issue of importance to the high-tech industry. In the fall of =
2000, amid the tight presidential race, Mr. Lieberman joined with a biparti=
san group of 13 senators in a letter urging the standards board to postpone=
 consideration of the changes until Congress reconvened in 2001.=20
The letter, among other things, claimed the accounting changes "will make m=
ergers and acquisitions very difficult for high-technology companies." In t=
he House, California Reps. Christopher Cox, a Republican, and Calvin Dooley=
, a Democrat, introduced a bill for a one-year moratorium on the standards =
board proposal.=20
The proposal called for new disclosures on mergers and acquisitions. Compan=
ies cried foul, complaining the change would reduce their earnings. Under p=
ressure from Congress, the standards board backed off, but still required n=
ew accounting that gives investors more information about the true initial =
costs of acquisitions and how to track the investment over time.=20
Lieberman spokesman Dan Gerstein said such activity by the senator stemmed =
from concern that government bureaucracy was out of touch with the real-wor=
ld impact of its proposal. "They are not democratically elected or accounta=
ble," he says. "In extreme circumstances, it's incumbent on Congress to ste=
p in."=20
Similarly in 1994, Sen. Lieberman was a leading figure in a bipartisan grou=
p of legislators who opposed a proposed change in accounting for stock opti=
ons. The change would have required that a company's current earnings refle=
ct the value of future stock options. Blocking the change was a big priorit=
y of the high-tech community in Silicon Valley, where growth-oriented firms=
 had made a regular practice of conferring stock options on executives and =
employees in lieu of direct compensation.=20
With the technology industry growing in clout along with its campaign donat=
ions for both political parties, the industry's concerns were well-received=
 on Capitol Hill. The Senate voted 88-9 for a Lieberman resolution urging t=
he accounting board to back off. It did.=20
"This was not just Joe Lieberman and a couple other folks out on a lark," s=
ays Mr. Gerstein, the spokesman. The senator "felt a compelling need to int=
ervene," he adds, given the potential impact of the proposal on an importan=
t sector of the economy.=20
The accounting board has had its defenders in Congress, such as Michigan De=
mocrats John Dingell in the House and Carl Levin in the Senate. Mr. Levin i=
n 1994 resisted the congressional efforts to influence the accounting board=
 rule on stock options, and argued that the Lieberman resolution "would put=
 the Senate on the record as opposing honest accounting."=20
Now Mr. Levin is paired with Mr. Lieberman at the Governmental Affairs Comm=
ittee, working to probe Enron's collapse.

Crazy busy, huh? Won't take but a sec. Ever hear of E-mail-management softw=
are produced by Omniva Policy Systems? It performs an amazing trick: With a=
 single click, a company's E-mail disappears irreversibly. No matter where =
in the world it happens to be, even if it is sitting on disks in a vault at=
 the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mission impossible? Naw, the E-mai=
l files don't actually vaporize. It works this way: When an E-mail message =
is created, Omniva encrypts it before sending and retains the key, which ca=
n be set to expire automatically after a certain number of days. When a rec=
ipient opens a message, the E-mail software checks with Omniva to make sure=
 that the key hasn't expired. When the message is "deleted," it is the key =
that is deleted, which renders the messages permanently unreadable. Here's =
how Omniva's Dave Marvit puts it: "We're empowering people to have conversa=
tions that go away." You think the folks at Arthur Andersen would be intere=
sted, too?=20
Here's the beauty part: It's perfectly legal. Companies can delete all E-ma=
il--without first archiving--as long as it's done as a matter of routine an=
d before being the subject of a particular criminal or civil investigation.=
 That's why attorneys who specialize in "risk management" tell their client=
s to purge all E-mail after 30 days. And why leave it to fallible individua=
ls to clean house regularly? Omniva's software makes the cleaning automatic=
, eliminating "the devastating liability created by casual comments archive=
d permanently."=20
Whaddya think about an endorsement deal with Omniva? Their Web site feature=
s the woes of companies that didn't "manage" their E-mail. Bridgestone/Fire=
stone found itself in a world of hurt, according to Omniva, because of thos=
e undeleted E-mail messages showing that the company was aware of the tire =
safety issues. The result--of the E-mail that surfaced, not the defects--wa=
s "a deluge of bad press and questioning by lawmakers." You're sayin', "Tel=
l me about it!"=20
If you find yourself in court, and some snotty federal prosecutor waves you=
r own E-mail in your face, you've got lots of company, buddy. Remember when=
 the richest guy on the planet was on the witness stand and had an E-mail p=
rintout shoved under his nose: "Did you write this, Mr. Gates, on or about =
Jan. 5, 1996?" He had to hem and haw and feign befuddlement, all because th=
e King of All Software hadn't installed software in his own company that wo=
uld have made those embarrassing conversations "go away." So don't beat you=

te away!=20
TO: Harvey Pitt, chairman, SEC=20
FROM: John Q. Public, Enron shareholder=20
I hate to take you away, even momentarily, from The Case, but I would like =
to pull one good thing out of this towering fiasco: elimination of the loop=
hole that permits publicly traded corporations to routinely destroy the ele=
ctronic files that document the conduct of their business. I'm not talking =
about the panicky throw-everything-overboard document purging at Arthur And=
ersen last October; I'm talking about the corporate policies that mandate r=
egular cleaning out of E-mail boxes, every 30, 60, or 90 days, at millions =
of corporate offices. That E-mail may prove to be critically important mont=
hs, perhaps years, later when investigations into malfeasance are initiated=
. The law should require that all internal communications be preserved perm=
anently for later retrieval.=20
When the SEC was founded in 1934, business was conducted on paper, which is=
 cumbersome and expensive to handle, copy, and store. Given the technology =
of the day, it was natural that the SEC required that publicly traded compa=
nies submit mere summaries of financial performance, not the full corpus of=
 memos and correspondence. But technology has advanced, business now takes =
place in an electronic medium, and most communication consists of text that=
 takes up infinitesimal storage space. The cost of preserving millions of r=
ecords is now negligible. Using tape backup, the cost of storing 400,000 E-=
mail messages is about $1. And using a concept called single-instance stora=
ge, the costs of archiving an entire firm's correspondence shrinks still mo=
re dramatically because only the original full-text copy and a list of the =
recipients are stored, not the 1,000 identical copies floating around the c=
ompany.=20
Existing commercial software can automatically preserve in a centralized ar=
chive all the mail purged from individual boxes, but companies need the SEC=
 to make its preservation a matter of law, not choice.=20
It may be too late for us Enron victims, but let's modernize our oversight =
of publicly traded companies so that future malefactors will have reason to=
 pause, knowing that the documentary record of their actions cannot after t=
he fact be erased.

To an uncanny degree, Andy Fastow mirrors the growth of Enron Corp. As the =
Houston-based energy giant rocketed to fame as a supernova of the "new econ=
omy," Fastow, its chief financial wizard, soared upward with it, crafting t=
he complex partnership deals that in a short 10 years turned a sleepy pipel=
ine outfit into the seventh-largest corporation in America. Now, with Enron=
 in flames, having erased$67 billion in the largest bankruptcy in history, =
Fastow, a onetime Master of the Universe, is the most wanted man in corpora=
te finance, the target of untold lawsuits and unchecked rage.=20
Like the junk bond and savings and loan debacles before it, the Enron colla=
pse is fast becoming a signature scandal. Its impact is felt in thousands o=
f layoffs, the implosion of retirement savings, and possible criminal charg=
es for massive accounting and securities fraud. Last week's developments al=
one were the stuff of corporate fiction: An Enron executive warned Chairman=
 Kenneth Lay months ago of her worries about the partnerships Enron used to=
 keep hundreds of millions of dollars in debt off its books. Enron's auditi=
ng firm, Arthur Andersen, fired its lead auditor when it was learned that A=
ndersen destroyed documents after an investigation had begun. Then Enron fi=
red Andersen. The head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, until rec=
ently stroking the accounting industry, proposed a new oversight body. Busi=
ness leaders speculated openly about whether Andersen would survive.
Through it all, the man everybody wanted to talk to was Fastow, a 40-year-o=
ld, trombone-playing M.B.A. who made at least $30 million from the Enron pa=
rtnerships while small investors lost their shirts. Fastow, who remains rel=
atively secluded in his expensive Houston home, has frustrated investigator=
s by balking at an SEC subpoena and dancing a fandango with congressional i=
nvestigators. The seclusion ritual appears to be of a piece with Fastow's y=
ears with Enron. In his spacious top-floor office, surrounded by original, =
expensive art, Fastow has maintained an extraordinarily low profile over th=
e years, granting few interviews, a virtual unknown even to many Enron empl=
oyees.=20
Yet, while some Enron officials say Fastow chafed at Enron's corporate swag=
ger, he was, in many ways, a product of it. Many at Enron thought the compa=
ny and its executives could do no wrong, and, some colleagues believe, so d=
id Fastow. It was in part because he was presumed a financial genius that t=
he board approved his machinations without adequate questioning. "He was a =
master politician; the board loved him," says a former employee. Others who=
 did challenge him landed on his enemies list, objects of his occasionally =
volatile temper. In the company's annual "rank and yank" performance review=
s, in which the employees who scored lowest were fired, Fastow shone. But s=
ome former colleagues say he also used the reviews to reward allies and tak=
e revenge on those who crossed him.=20
Hyperventilating. Fastow was hired at Enron to drum up oil and gas deals, b=
ut his bosses quickly realized his talent for packaging the financing for n=
ew deals and restructuring other deals already on the books. Despite his ti=
tle, Fastow never really played the CFO role at Enron. Typically, chief fin=
ancial officers are a company's main envoy to Wall Street, walking a fine l=
ine between husbanding the firm's finances and hand-holding big players lik=
e analysts and institutional shareholders so important to setting the stock=
 price. But Fastow developed surprisingly little presence on the Street. "O=
rdinarily, the CFO is hyperventilating and pontificating at analyst confere=
nces," says John Olson, an analyst for Sanders Morris Harris. "[Fastow's] r=
ole was sitting in the backroom coming up with those partnerships."=20
The details of those partnerships, which played a pivotal role in Enron's u=
ndoing, are truly complex. But the bottom line is this: In their pure form,=
 such partnerships are helpful in arranging financing or attracting investo=
rs for a particular project, and they can minimize taxes. In Enron's case, =
they became a vehicle for keeping huge amounts of corporate debt off the bo=
oks Enron presented to the world. That was important because too much debt =
makes borrowing more expensive. For Enron, that would mean lower profits, a=
nd as a Wall Street darling, that would not do.=20
The problems with the partnerships, according to attorneys now suing the co=
mpany, are that in creating them, Enron would contribute company stock or o=
ther assets, which would essentially be used to secure big loans. It's not =
supposed to go both ways; the assets can't serve dual roles as reserves for=
 the partnership and collateral for a loan. Critics also point to a conflic=
t of interest. Fastow was part of the partnerships but also an executive of=
 Enron. As the partnerships did business with the company, Fastow's loyalti=
es were inherently torn. Moreover, Enron guaranteed profits for the entitie=
s. If the targets were missed, Enron would make up the difference, typicall=
y through issuance of new stock. That would put more stock in circulation, =
potentially depressing the price.=20
Mutants. By the time Enron filed for bankruptcy, the company listed more th=
an 3,500 partnerships, often with complex links to other entities or unknow=
n parties. "They just mutated into something virtually unrecognizable," say=
s Olson. "Investors didn't know if they were investing in widgets or in an =
Indonesian coffee plantation." As early as 1997, some executives were chall=
enging Fastow, only to see their criticisms pushed aside. "I said, `I don't=
 care if Arthur Andersen has passed off on this or if the board of director=
s has approved it. It does not pass the smell test,' " said one former Enro=
n employee. "That was not a politically astute thing of me to say." At a co=
mpany meeting last October, Vice President Jim Schwieger pressed Lay about =
the partnerships; Lay responded by ending the meeting. Later that day, Fast=
ow approached Schwieger, shook his hand, and offered to sit down and answer=
 any questions. The next day, Schwieger says, Fastow was gone.=20
Enron itself seems to be positioning Fastow as the fall guy, suggesting tha=
t the partnerships were Fastow creations that he failed to explain thorough=
ly. But U.S. News has learned that Fastow, who is represented by high-profi=
le attorney David Boies, is beginning to push a two-tiered defense. Althoug=
h Fastow declined to comment, his allies argue that the partnerships were c=
reated with the support and backing of Enron. Thomas Bilek, a Houston attor=
ney who represents investors, said that Enron employees say Fastow has docu=
ments establishing the involvement of other company executives in the finan=
cial house of cards.=20
Fastow is also likely to contend that the problem with the partnerships lie=
s not in their creation but in how they were accounted for. A source close =
to Fastow argues that his responsibilities were limited to acquiring capita=
l from outside investors and that he had no authority over accounting for t=
hem. That responsibility, Fastow maintains, fell to Richard Causey, Enron's=
 chief accounting officer. Yet several former employees said Fastow created=
 the partnerships precisely so they could be accounted for off the books. A=
 lawyer for Causey said his client did nothing wrong.=20
"A sound plan." Fastow was hardly the rogue operator Enron paints him to be=
, other officials say. One former executive recalls that sign-offs from the=
 legal department to the accounting department were required on the deals. =
"It wasn't just an automatic," the employee says. Others say Fastow made no=
 secret of his activities. Michael Klein, a friend and independent oil and =
gas producer, says Fastow discussed partnerships with him. "He told me it w=
as a sound business plan that was approved and encouraged by Enron," Klein =
recalls. Even Enron's law firm, given a limited mission to examine some of =
the transactions, reports that company executives blessed the deals at the =
center of the controversy, known as the LJM partnerships. Says one employee=
 who worked in the finance group: "Andy never pulled the trigger on the fin=
al decision at LJM." That, the employee says, required former CEO Jeffrey S=
killing's approval.=20
Fastow created his new financial order in Houston after leaving the shadow =
of the old. The middle of three brothers, he spent his early childhood on L=
ong Island before moving to New Providence, N.J., a middle-class suburb of =
New York. In high school, Fastow displayed a progressive flair while servin=
g his senior year as student representative to the state board of education=
, proposing that teaching of contraception be made mandatory in public scho=
ols.=20
Regular newspaper reading as a child helped develop his interest in finance=
. He went to Tufts University for a degree in Chinese and economics. There,=
 he met his wife-to-be, Lea Weingarten, from a prominent Houston family. Gr=
aduate business school was at Northwestern University outside Chicago, wher=
e he concentrated on finance. Not long ago, Fastow was a proud son of each =
institution, someone to be mined for generous alumni donations. By last wee=
k, the schools were reluctant to provide any information on him.=20
While attending business school at night, Fastow worked at Chicago-based Co=
ntinental Bank Corp., one of the nation's biggest banking companies. At the=
 bank, he found ways to morph existing assets into new sources of cash, ski=
lls he would put to use at Enron.=20
The father of two young sons, he is a onetime pilot and a decent tennis pla=
yer, coaches youth sports, and has been a patron of contemporary arts, even=
 donating pieces for display at a trendy Houston gallery. Property records =
show he bought a 68-acre spread in Vermont in 1998, and he is now building =
an 11,500-square-foot home in one of Houston's finest neighborhoods. Fastow=
 has also contributed to charity, forming his own private foundation. Unlik=
e Lay, Fastow has been temperate politically, with only $3,200 in donations=
 to President Bush and a Texas congressional candidate topping his list.=20
Through his ordeal, Fastow has had devoted supporters. "This is a man of in=
tegrity and honesty," says Ned Rifkin, a friend who until recently was dire=
ctor of the Menil Collection, the museum to which Fastow lent his art. "I j=
ust pray this isn't damaging to their family." Rabbi Shaul Osadchey, who of=
ficiated at Fastow's wedding, calls Fastow a mensch, the Yiddish term for a=
 man of good character and sound values.=20
But many investors hurt by the company's collapse have been clamoring to ma=
ke Fastow pay. "Fastow broke a trust," says Enron veteran Maritta Mullet, w=
ho says the company's collapse cost her $500,000. In a way, he already is p=
aying. One of the charities Fastow has supported, a Houston center that hel=
ps the homeless, is now seeing former Enron employees apply for help with t=
heir rent.

Washington has been all atwitter about the possibility that the Enron colla=
pse will cause a political scandal for the Bush administration. We are remi=
nded over and over that Enron generated more political contributions for Ge=
orge W. Bush than any other company, and the subtext of many of the news st=
ories is that the Bush administration must have done Enron some favors in r=
eturn. But there is no evidence that it did. By trying to fit Enron into th=
e familiar scandal template, the media are missing larger, more important l=
essons.=20
There is no dispute that Enron officials contacted Treasury Secretary Paul =
O'Neill, Treasury Under Secretary Paul Fisher, and Commerce Secretary Donal=
d Evans seeking help as Enron stock plunged. Former Clinton Treasury Secret=
ary Robert Rubin, now a top executive of Citigroup, which loaned Enron $800=
 million, asked Fisher whether he should call the bond-rating companies to =
question their downgrade of Enron's credit.
The response in each case was the same: No. Nor did Enron get what it wante=
d in public policy. The biggest change Enron sought--limits on carbon emiss=
ions, so that it could make money running emissions-trading markets--was fi=
rmly opposed by the administration. Editorial writers are already busy cluc=
king that the Enron case shows the need for campaign finance reform. It sho=
ws just the opposite: With this administration, at least, campaign contribu=
tions bought nothing--not even access: O'Neill, Fisher, and Evans would hav=
e taken the calls of top officials of the nation's No. 7 company even if it=
 hadn't given hefty campaign contributions.=20
Broken laws? Democrats with presidential ambitions like Connecticut Sen. Jo=
seph Lieberman are still talking about digging for evidence showing that th=
e administration did something for Enron. Other Democrats, including Califo=
rnia Rep. Henry Waxman, complain that the Bush administration didn't do eno=
ugh for Enron shareholders. A more sensible approach is being taken by a Mi=
chigan Democrat, Sen. Carl Levin. His investigation is focusing on whether =
Enron and its auditors broke the law and whether laws or accounting standar=
ds should be changed to protect investors and make markets work properly.=
=20
The Bush administration's refusal to intervene on Enron's behalf, like its =
refusal to intervene massively in Argentina's economic crisis, is an exampl=
e of how its policies differ from those of the Clinton administration. In 1=
995, Rubin put together a $52 billion loan guarantee package for Mexico, wi=
thout support from Congress. In 1998, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,=
 supported by the Clinton Treasury Department, provided $3.6 billion to bai=
l out Long-Term Capital Management, a hedge fund. Both bailouts seemed to w=
ork well: Mexico's economy and Long-Term Capital recovered. Creditors who m=
ight have gotten nothing did well.=20
But such bailouts create what economists call moral hazard: If creditors be=
lieve they're going to be bailed out, they will extend credit profligately,=
 which will lead to more bankruptcies and financial crises. The Mexico bail=
out may have contributed to the 1997 East Asian financial crisis, and the L=
ong-Term Capital bailout may have contributed to the Enron bankruptcy. The =
Bush administration's actions--or inactions--on Enron and Argentina will re=
duce moral hazard and make lenders and investors think twice about where th=
ey put their money.=20
Of course, the facts in Mexico and Argentina, Long-Term Capital and Enron a=
re not precisely the same, and you can construct an intellectually defensib=
le position for both administrations' actions. Even so, they seem to reflec=
t a difference in temperament between the two parties. When a Democrat as i=
ntelligent as Henry Waxman suggests that the government somehow should have=
 acted to protect the share price of a single company, one must suspect tha=
t his temperament, not his intellect, is speaking.=20
For Democrats are temperamentally inclined to believe that government shoul=
d act to help people who are hurting, while Republicans are more inclined t=
o let markets take their course. The Clinton administration actively promot=
ed foreign investments by U.S. companies, including Enron, after it contrib=
uted to Democrats. The Bush administration seems less inclined to do so. Th=
e media are chortling that the Enron collapse will hurt Bush by showing how=
 cozy he is with big business. But an administration disinclined to interve=
ne in the marketplace is likely to be less popular among beleaguered CEOs a=

Congress's Enron Challenge

Copyright 2002, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved

CONGRESS BEGINS grappling with Enron today. The Senate Governmental Affairs=
 Committee will hear testimony from regulatory experts; a House subcommitte=
e will hear about the shredding of documents by Arthur Andersen, Enron's au=
ditor. It is hard to overstate the importance of these and other hearings t=
hat Congress will convene over the next few weeks. The scandal gets steadil=
y murkier, with news of document destruction at Enron compounding the impre=
ssion that some people at the company had no respect for legality. Moreover=
, the scandal spotlights a complex list of regulatory failures, ranging fro=
m weak oversight of auditors to inadequate pension safeguards to the comple=
te lack of federal supervision for many of the derivative financial instrum=
ents traded by non-bank companies.=20
The need for leadership from Congress is especially strong, because the exp=
ert agencies that might usually be out in front are dithering. Harvey Pitt,=
 the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, shows little incli=
nation to strengthen oversight of auditors; indeed, his weak gesture on thi=
s issue last week has prompted all five members of the respected Public Ove=
rsight Board to resign in protest. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission=
, which ought to monitor the swaps and other "over-the-counter" derivatives=
 traded by non-bank firms much as financial regulators currently inspect th=
e books of banks, shows no inclination to press for this authority. Both co=
mmissions are plagued by vacancies as well as leaders who seem reluctant to=
 act. Somebody needs to push them.
The Senate is starting off on the right foot by hearing from Arthur Levitt,=
 the former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and Lynn Tu=
rner, the SEC's former chief accountant. Messrs Levitt and Turner are both =
rightly outraged by the lax state of audit regulation. Auditors who sign of=
f on fraudulent financial statements are seldom punished properly for the s=
erious damage that they cause to ordinary people's savings. And despite a s=
tring of audit failures, the profession has repeatedly fought off attempts =
by Mr. Levitt and other reformers to toughen oversight -- not least by dona=
ting generously to members of Congress, who in turn have opposed tough regu=
lation. In the wake of Enron, this needs to change. The Senate should liste=
n carefully to its first witnesses today and frame reform accordingly.=20
Enron's failure poses one central question. If this company issued make-bel=
ieve accounts, why should anyone believe that dozens of other companies are=
n't practicing the same deception? Unless Congress can close the regulatory=
 loopholes that permitted Enron's fall, there will be more corporate implos=
ions. Millions of innocent savers will get hurt. And the nation's vaunted c=
apital markets will forfeit the public trust that allows them to function.

All Enron Cards on the Table

Copyright 2002, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved

Talk cards with any good poker player and the discussion will soon turn to =
"tells": the unintended signals other players give that reveal whether they=
 hold good hands or bad.=20
Last week, the Bush administration gave its clearest "tell" yet that it doe=
sn't like its Enron hand. In response to my inquiries about contacts betwee=
n administration officials and Enron executives, a senior White House offic=
ial warned: "Waxman risks transforming himself into the Dan Burton of the D=
emocrats."
This unusual jab wasn't meant as friendly career advice. Republican White H=
ouses rarely throw gratuitous insults at senior Republican members of Congr=
ess like Mr. Burton, the chairman of the Government Reform Committee. To ma=
ke sure the message wasn't lost, the White House press secretary later call=
ed my efforts a "partisan waste of taxpayer money."=20
These blunt personal attacks signal a high level of White House anxiety: It=
s strategy is to discredit me and make other Democrats nervous about invest=
igating Enron's influence on White House policies.=20
What's especially odd is that these attacks are coming even though I've bee=
n careful not to make any accusations about the president, the vice preside=
nt or any of their staff. Having seen the mistakes of Republican investigat=
ions into the Clinton administration at close range, I have no interest in =
repeating the pattern of accuse first and investigate later. A better way i=
s to ask for relevant information before reaching conclusions.=20
For the past two months my staff has been conducting a broad inquiry into E=
nron's collapse. We've been trying to learn how thousands of American famil=
ies were robbed of their financial security. As a minority member of the Ho=
use, I can't call hearings or issue subpoenas, but a Web tip line has been =
surprisingly helpful in identifying parts of the puzzle.=20
What offends the White House are the questions I have been asking about Enr=
on's contacts with administration officials. While the investigation into E=
nron shouldn't be driven by politics, no area -- including Enron's politica=
l activities -- should be off limits.=20
The Bush administration wants to wall off its relationship with Enron from =
congressional inquiry. In essence, it argues that the president has a const=
itutional right to block investigation into the influence of special intere=
sts on White House policy. The administration has even rebuffed the efforts=
 of the General Accounting Office to learn what actions Enron requested fro=
m the vice president's energy task force, forcing GAO to consider the unpre=
cedented step of suing the White House.=20
Some facts are coming to light nonetheless. Enron was the administration's =
biggest campaign contributor. The company's lobbyists met secretly and repe=
atedly with the vice president's energy task force. The final energy plan c=
ontained 17 provisions that Enron wanted.=20
Last April, Enron CEO Ken Lay met with Vice President Dick Cheney, urging h=
im to oppose price relief in the California energy crisis. The next day, th=
e vice president called the Los Angeles Times and argued against price caps=
. Two months later, the vice president raised Enron's concerns about the Da=
bhol power plant with a senior official from India.=20
Lay weighed in with the White House director of personnel about appointment=
s to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The president later nominate=
d candidates apparently supported by Lay. Lay also called Office of Managem=
ent and Budget Director Mitch Daniels to lobby for the repeal of the corpor=
ate minimum tax. The administration subsequently endorsed the House-passed =
stimulus bill, which repealed the tax and gave Enron a $254 million windfal=
l.=20
Because all the facts are not yet in, congressional Democrats have carefull=
y refrained from alleging that the White House took specific actions becaus=
e of Enron's lobbying. But the White House is wrong to hide behind this rea=
sonable restraint as a justification for resisting congressional inquiries =
about Enron's extraordinary access.=20
It's also appropriate to ask the administration questions about its reactio=
n to Enron's collapse. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and others made the =
right call in not bailing Enron out. But had Secretary O'Neill initiated an=
 expedited investigation into the conduct of Enron executives, he could hav=
e discovered in October that they had cashed out $1 billion in stock and th=
at Enron employees were in a 401(k) "lock-down." Even then, it might have b=
een difficult for the administration to take steps to mitigate the harm to =
Enron employees and other victims, but no one even tried.=20
It's time for the administration to draw a new hand. It should begin with c=
omplete disclosure of all the Cheney energy task force records. Just as imp=
ortant is a full accounting of all administration contacts with Enron repre=
sentatives. Nothing else will resolve legitimate questions that deserve exp=
lanation -- or fulfill the new approach that George W. Bush promised to bri=
ng to Washington.=20

A Gift To the Democrats

Copyright 2002, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved

On the basis of "things are seldom what they seem," especially in matters r=
elating to Enron, you should know that CEO Kenneth L. Lay is not from the L=
one Star State. He may sound like the quintessential high-handed, high-flyi=
ng Texan, given to overwhelming people and brooking no opposition. But the =
man who purchased everyone who might stand in his way was born and educated=
 in Missouri and did not hit Houston until 1970, when he took a PhD in econ=
omics at the University of Houston.=20
Texan Robert Strauss, who has known Lay casually for many years, says he "d=
oesn't fit the caricature of the self-promoting tycoon" -- the kind who usu=
ally does what he did: "He's quiet and well-mannered, with an air of refine=
ment about him. And I find it strange I should say this, because I am incen=
sed at what he did."
Since he rocked the world's financial markets with the biggest bankruptcy i=
n history, Lay has been in one of his many mansions. We can't expect to see=
 him here until Feb. 4, when he appears before a Senate Commerce subcommitt=
ee chaired by Byron Dorgan.=20
He made monkeys of his monitors all the way: the Washington regulators, the=
 Wall Street analysts, the congressional watchdogs, the Manhattan investmen=
t bankers, and the auditors, Arthur Andersen, who served Enron in the dual =
capacity of consultants and accountants, and whose legerdemain relieved the=
 company of the tedium of paying taxes.=20
The high-finance scene today looks like a beach where there's been an oil s=
pill and creatures stumble out of the water, their wings plastered to them =
by the slick. No one has a plausible explanation for why they were still te=
lling the public to buy, buy, buy when Enron was sinking fast. Newspaper an=
d television screens throb with accounts of the heartbroken who trusted Lay=
 when he told them, in the face of other warnings, that all would be well.=
=20
Even Houston, proud, polluted capital of the oil "bidness," is a little ash=
amed. The town wears the Enron brand. The whole U.S. attorney's office had =
to bow out of the fraud case of the century because all were involved with =
Enron in one way or another. The FBI has taken over the job of interrupting=
 the shredding parties at the stricken headquarters. It wouldn't have known=
 about them except for a woman named Maureen Castenada, a former employee. =
There are no good guys yet in Enron, only good women: Ms. Castenada and She=
rron Watkins, who told Lay that "legal is not right."=20
After a week of dodging queries about his former pal and benefactor -- Kenn=
eth Lay was President Bush's number one contributor -- the president wheele=
d around and joined the forces of outrage, thankfully recording a victim in=
 his own family, his mother-in-law.=20
Republicans are nervous as they try to depict Enron as an isolated case of =
capitalism gone mad and the serene balance of the market place torn up by a=
 rogue company. They are aware, though, that some of their cherished projec=
ts have been endangered: parts of the president's economic stimulus bill, w=
hich, according to the Congressional Research Service, would have awarded E=
nron $254 million in "corporate alternative minimum tax credits" -- a gift =
few members of Congress, even those blessed with the bipartisan benefaction=
s of Kenneth L. Lay, would be inclined to give.=20
As for the Democrats, they have been handed a backdrop for the congressiona=
l campaign that they hardly know what to do with. They have been given a pe=
erless chance to show the truth of what they have always said about the Rep=
ublicans -- that they favor government of the corporations, by the corporat=
ions and for the corporations. They have scheduled 10 congressional hearing=
s, which is obviously too many. They might try to whittle the number down b=
y excluding members who received Lay bounty, such as Sen. Joe Lieberman. Th=
ey could blow it.=20
Presidential strategist Karl Rove suggested at the Republican National Comm=
ittee meeting that he understood the dimensions of the problem, by suggesti=
ng that GOP candidates could run on the coattails of the commander in chief=
. Democrats cried foul. House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt howled "shame=
," a strident response to what was really only politics -- Democrats didn't=
 hesitate to run on Bill Clinton's golden economic record, did they? And if=
 George W. Bush can't talk about the war for fear of offending Democrats, w=
e've entered new realms of political correctness.=20
For Democrats to wail that they have supported the war -- they have not dar=
ed to open their mouths without praise for the president's prowess -- sound=
s self-righteous and self-pitying. They could spend their time better by fi=
guring out how to use the present the gods have handed them -- and what to =
ask Ken Lay when they finally see him.

If nothing else, Enron's difficulties have not only given us a lesson in Ec=
onomics 101, but they also have told us how Washington operates.=20
All the people in the Enron mess have played their roles -- from the execut=
ives in the company and their accounting firm to the lawyers who served the=
m so well. But none of them could accomplish what they did without the Wash=
ington lobbyists. They are the ones who protect companies from a government=
 that cannot be trusted.
Lobbyists are just like you and me, and they put on their golf shoes one fo=
ot at a time.=20
You have to be qualified to be a lobbyist. Many, but not all, are recruited=
 from Congress. They have decided they are fed up with politics and want to=
 make some big money for a change, or have lost an election and are not fit=
 to do anything else.=20
Lobbyists are very friendly people. They call lawmakers and administration =
officials by their first names: "Ted," "Terry," "George." Theirs is the onl=
y profession, except for the FBI, that makes house calls.=20
The job of the lobbyist is to stop a law that will hurt his clients and lob=
by for a bill that will make everyone rich.=20
This is an example of how it works: The Hidden Valley Gas and Energy Co. ha=
s ex-senator Glad Handle on its payroll to lobby for the company in Washing=
ton. Glad Handle is a Republican, and he replaced ex-congressman Taylor Blu=
ewhistle, a Democrat, who was fired after Al Gore lost the election.=20
Glad moves among the Capitol, the White House and any agency that can affec=
t Hidden Valley business.=20
Let's say Congress wants to pass a law forbidding Hidden Valley to deliver =
natural gas and smoke cigarettes at the same time.=20
What Congress doesn't know is that Hidden Valley owns a cigarette company a=
s well as a gas company. Banning smoking near a gas plant will seriously hu=
rt its tobacco business.=20
Glad invites Sen. Carl Fiddle to the Burning Tree country club. Fiddle is i=
n charge of the Smoking and Energy Committee. He is greeted warmly by Handl=
e, who says, "Remember when we filibustered an equal rights bill together?"=
=20
They play 18 holes, and then Glad asks Fiddle, "How's the election campaign=
 going?"=20
"We could use $100,000 in soft money to buy sweat shirts for our volunteers=
."=20
Glad takes out his checkbook and says, "Why didn't you say that before?"=20
Sen. Fiddle replies: "You're a lobbyist, so we hated to ask you for somethi=
ng. If we take your money, what can we do for you?"=20
"Nothing much. If you want to hold up the Anti-Smoking Gas Bill in committe=
e, that would be fun."=20
"It's done."=20
"What about getting the oil rights to West Point?" Glad asks.=20
"I know the person at EPA you should ask for."=20
Glad says, "Can I buy you a beer?"=20
"You know, Glad, that's against Senate rules."=20

I also disclosed that past relationship the very first time I mentioned Enr=

Energy giant Enron's conduct has been so egregious that even President Bush=
, a personal friend of just- resigned company Chairman Kenneth L. Lay, has =
finally felt compelled to denounce the corporation's alleged defrauding of =
employees and outside investors. If politicians are starting to return dona=
tions from Enron to assure the electorate that Congress isn't bought and pa=
id for, then drastic measures surely need to be taken to reassure investors=
 as well.=20
Unfortunately, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt is t=
aking exactly the opposite course. The giant Andersen accounting company is=
 under intense scrutiny for its auditing in the Enron debacle. Instead of p=
ushing for reform, however, Pitt is dismissing the need for it, claiming "t=
here is nothing rotten with the accounting industry."
Pitt has called for creating an oversight board. The five-member board curr=
ently responsible for ethics oversight has resigned, and its head, Charles =
Bowsher, a former U.S. comptroller general, has denounced Pitt's proposals =
as too friendly to the industry that is supposed to be monitored. The new o=
versight board would apparently be largely controlled by the industry's Ame=
rican Institute of Certified Public Accountants.=20
Pitt, as the head regulator of financial markets, has come up with some coz=
y proposals that are astonishing. But they are less so considering that Pit=
t, a lawyer, had as clients the five biggest U.S. accounting firms, includi=
ng Andersen, as well as the American Institute of Certified Public Accounta=
nts. Unless he changes course, he will be unable to restore investor confid=
ence that fair and open audits are taking place.=20
Despite Pitt's claims, there is a lot that is rotten in the accounting indu=
stry. It appears that Andersen did not just wink at Enron's end run around =
the law; Andersen may have abetted it. Though Andersen is reported to have =
shredded paperwork, memos have surfaced showing that auditors were aware of=
 Enron's enormous manipulation of its reported earnings, which were really =
losses, and did nothing to expose it. On the contrary, because auditors can=
 also be consultants to the companies they are supposed to monitor, the inc=
entive is for them not to blow the whistle. Andersen, for example, received=
 $27 million from Enron for consulting work.=20
Congress needs to pass a law that would create an oversight board that woul=
d have enough power to police the industry effectively. It also needs to ma=
ke it illegal for auditors to work in any capacity for corporations other t=
han auditing. That would help end the smell from the accounting industry th=
at Pitt is pretending doesn't exist.

SEN. TOM DASCHLE (D-SD), MAJORITY LEADER: I think we all have to be very fo=
rthcoming here and I think it`s important in this case that the vice presid=
ent, like everybody else, provide the information required.=20
O`BRIEN: To date, there has been no evidence that anyone in the administrat=
ion acted improperly in the Enron collapse. In fact, some of Enron`s most i=
mportant beneficiaries have also lost money. Texas Senator Phil Gramm and h=
is wife, Dr. Wendy Gramm, say they lost around $686,000 in the Enron demise=
. Enron had showered the senator, a champion of deregulation, with campaign=
 contributions. And Dr. Gramm, an economist, serves on Enron`s board of dir=
ectors. Her deferred compensation was lost when Enron declared bankruptcy.=
=20
And finally, reverberations from last week`s recommendation by Harvey Pitt,=
 the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, for a new regulato=
ry agency to oversee the accounting profession.=20
(END VIDEOTAPE)=20
That didn`t sit well with the public oversight board, a five-member commiss=
ion that already oversees ethics and disciplinary issues. All five members =
have resigned, saying Pitt`s new agency would render their work irrelevant.=
 Pitt has now written back, urging the members to reconsider, saying his pr=
oposals would in fact strengthen the oversight board, not weaken it -- Kath=
leen.=20
HAYS: Tim, in regards to Harvey Pitt`s role in proposing a new kind of over=
sight board, is there any talk in Washington that maybe Mr. Pitt has been t=
oo close to some of the big players, the big 5 accounting firms are his cli=
ents, the AICPA, the association of accountants, one of his clients, what`s=
 the talk down there on that?=20
O`BRIEN: Well not only those, also he represented Arthur Andersen when he w=
as in private practice before joining the Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n. Some Democrats say that`s a conflict of interest and he should recuse hi=
mself. Legally it really isn`t, because you can`t identify the views expres=
sed by a lawyer on behalf of a client with the lawyer himself.=20
Harvey Pitt is the first to say he has another client now, it is the United=
 States America and there is no conflict. However, he has indicated that he=
 will step back from the investigation. The SEC ordered the investigation, =
he`s in charge of the SEC but he is not going to participate in the probe.=
=20
HAYS: OK, Tim, thanks for the report.=20
Starting tomorrow, Congress gets down and dirty on the Enron scandal. Sever=
al committees begin their investigations into the biggest corporate collaps=
e ever. Allan Chernoff reports on the battle for witnesses before a subcomm=
ittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.=20
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)=20
ALLAN CHERNOFF, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A behind-the-scenes strug=
gle between David Duncan, the fired Andersen Partner, who oversaw the Enron=
 audit and the subcommittee on oversight and investigation.=20
Subcommittee chair, James Greenwood:=20
REP. JAMES GREENWOOD (R), PENNSYLVANIA: We subpoenaed him. He still doesn`t=
 want to come. He wants immunity. We are not going to grant him immunity. H=
e wants to take the 5th, and we are telling him to come in tomorrow. If you=
 want to take the 5th Amendment that`s your constitution right, but do it a=
t the hearing, and if you don`t do it we reserve the right to cite you for =
contempt of Congress.=20
CHERNOFF: A source close to Duncan says he will appear and simply will invo=
ke the 5th Amendment protection against self-incrimination.=20
His attorney had argued to the subcommittee that "Mr. Duncan has not yet ha=
d access to all the documents necessary for him to prepare for a formal hea=
ring."=20
REP. BILLY TAUZIN (R), LOUISIANA: I think he needs to be there to explain w=
hy he was willing to give us 4.5 hours of testimony and wouldn`t go public =
with the same testimony. But, he has his rights, and we`ll respect his righ=
ts.=20
CHERNOFF: According to Andersen it was Duncan who ordered employees at the =
Houston office to shred and delete Enron-related documents. Duncan has told=
 congressional investigators he was only following company orders, in the f=
orm of a memo reminding the engagement team of our documentation and retent=
ion policy, written by Andersen attorney Nancy Temple. She will testify.=20
Of particular interest to the subcommittee, an October 23 Andersen e-mail a=
ddressed to David Duncan and other executives discussing a conference call =
agenda which included the SEC, legal representation, and response to SEC.=
=20
Andersen says Duncan had directed the document disposal at a meeting on Oct=
ober 23. Andersen`s chief executive, Joseph Berardino, who testified before=
 Congress in December, fought off the subcommittee`s request. Instead, the =
Chicago headquarters is sending executive Dorsey Baskin, who oversees the f=
irm`s policy on audit and work papers.=20
(END VIDEOTAPE)=20
A demoted Andersen executive Michael Odom also is scheduled to testify befo=
re the subcommittee. Now, on the Senate side, Senator Lieberman`s Governmen=
tal Affairs Committee will be looking into the question of what Washington =
might have done to protect investors and businesses from the Enron fallout =
-- Kathleen.=20
HAYS: Thanks Allan. I`m sure you are going to be a very busy man tomorrow.=
=20
***
With Congress back in session, economic stimulus, the recession and Enron a=
re shaping up as the biggest items on the congressional agenda. Jonathan Ka=
rl joins us with more from Capitol Hill. Hi, Jon.=20
JONATHAN KARL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Kathleen. And Congress is picking up=
 right where it left off last year, the question of economic stimulus, what=
 they can do to get the economy going.=20
Right now the Republicans as we speak are over in the Capitol building, mee=
ting, on the Senate side, trying to think about how to respond to Senator T=
om Daschle`s latest gamut.=20
Daschle has put on the table a possible proposal on economic stimulus that =
boils down to this: He says Democrats would give up much of the spending th=
at was in the Democratic stimulus plan last year, in exchange for the Repub=
licans giving up many of the tax cuts they had in their proposal.=20
What you are left with, basically, is this: Extend unemployment benefits, a=
lso rebate checks for low-income taxpayers who did not get tax rebate check=
s last year, and the third item would be some modest tax breaks to encourag=
e companies to invest in new equipment. Making the case for that, Daschle c=
ame out today and used a new verb, perhaps a new addition to the English la=
nguage. The verb is "to "Enron." He was criticizing the Republicans, talkin=
g about deficits, and then he used the verb "to Enron."=20
This is what he had to say.=20
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)=20
DASCHLE: I don`t want to Enron the people of the United States. I don`t wan=
t to see them holding the bag at the end of the day just like Enron employe=
es have held the bag. I don`t want to destroy their Social Security system.=
 I don`t want to destroy their Medicare system. I don`t want to destroy the=
ir ultimate ability to look with confidence at their retirement.=20
(END VIDEO CLIP)=20
KARL: So, you see a sign that while the Democrats are saying they don`t wan=
t to politicize the upcoming Enron hearings, clearly Democrats see the pote=
ntial to try to talk about Republican economics as a kind of Enronomics, wh=
ich is another term we have heard used by Democrats up here on Capitol Hill=
.=20
And also, Kathleen, at the top of the show, you heard Tim O`Brien talk abou=
t how Senator Phil Gramm`s wife, Wendy Gramm who is on the Enron board, los=
t some 600,000 in her 401(k) when the Enron stock went south.=20
Well, another little bit of news on Senator Gramm. Senator Gramm tells CNN =
that he will recuse himself from all matters directly related to the invest=
igation of Enron here in Congress. Gramm is saying that he will continue to=
 talk about issues related to Enron, such as pension reform and changes in =
the rules that govern accounting companies. But he will recuse himself in a=
nything directly related to the investigation of Enron given that his wife,=
 Wendy Gramm, is on their board -- Kathleen.=20
HAYS: Thanks for the report, John, and for the new verb "Enron." Jonathan K=
arl on Capitol Hill.=20
Still to come tonight, we`ll tell you why your safe deposit box may not be =
as safe as you think it is, and why it may not be insured.=20
The nation`s mayors are concerned with keeping our cities safe. We`ll tell =
you how homeland security chief Tom Ridge plans to help.=20
And Boeing`s profits are down. The year ahead looks bleak. And yet the comp=
any`s CEO is optimistic. He`ll tell us why.=20
ANNOUNCER: Next, Kathleen talks with Phil Condit, CEO of Boeing.=20
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)=20
HAYS: The accounting industry`s reputation has been devastated by the Enron=
 scandal. The SEC has proposed a new panel to police the industry, that dec=
ision has been applauded by the American Institute of Certified Public Acco=
untants. The group`s president and CEO, Barry Melancon, joins us now. Welco=
me.=20
BARRY MELANCON, PRES. & CEO, CPAS: Hi, Kathleen.=20
HAYS: I think it`s interesting that Charles Boucher who was head of the pub=
lic oversight board that resigned in protest today, says there`s plenty of =
oversight. What has been lacking in overseeing the accounting industry is t=
he power to discipline. The power to demand records. What do you think of h=
is statement?=20
MELANCON: Well, in actuality what Chairman Pitt is proposed is a process wh=
ere discipline is addressed, Kathleen. And in fact moves from the oversight=
 to public participation. And obviously public participation is a higher or=
der of participation than public oversight, and so the activities that Chai=
rman Pitt proposed is moving us to new area which a majority of non-auditor=
s, people who are not in the profession would actually be involved in the d=
ecision-making process over discipline and quality control.=20
HAYS: But in fact the public oversight board was not comprised of people in=
 the accounting profession. And let me come back to that question, is there=
 something that Mr. Pitt has proposed that is going to put teeth in this ne=
w oversight board? So again, you`d think it would be very important to be a=
ble to demand to see certain records and have the threat of some kind of pu=
nishment from this board hanging over auditors if they don`t do their job.=
=20
MELANCON: Well, what Chairman Pitt has proposed is a process by which a dis=
ciplinary board -- or in monitoring quality control. If someone was found t=
o be deficient in the quality they were doing, they would actually lose the=
 rights to be able to audit public companies, that`s pretty significant tee=
th. HAYS: What about the basic conflict of interest, this --also this does =
not seem to be addressed by Mr. Pitt`s proposal, at least not so far. Many =
of the large accounting firms do audits of companies, they also have anothe=
r part that has consulting contracts where they advise the very managers th=
at the other part of the firm is auditing. Is that problem going to be addr=
essed by Harvey Pitt`s proposal?=20
MELANCON: Well, in actuality, former Chairman Arthur Levitt adopted a rule =
at the end of his term that addressed that issue very directly. It outlawed=
 or made by rule the inability to do certain services, it`s severely limite=
d other services and it created a total aspect of transparency and disclosu=
re if services were performed outside of the audit. But I might add, that`s=
 sort of an easy issue to address from the standpoint it sounds good. But e=
ven if we had an outright ban, which is a very complicated point, this is v=
ery complicated issue, Enron, and that outright ban itself would not preven=
t the reoccurrence of Enron. HAYS: But it might prevent a conflict of inter=
est in these firms. This is an issue that most every kind of accounting pro=
fessor seems to bring up when they`re asked about it.=20
MELANCON: In actuality there are over 300,000 CPAs in this country, and I t=
hink if you talk to small business people, business managers, they turn to =
their CPA`s for things other than just audits. And it`s just part of the pr=
ofession for over a hundred years. And it`s been a critical element in the =
profession being part of the fiber, if you will, of the success of the Amer=
ican economy. Doing things like taxes, doing things like general advisory o=
n whether someone should lease or buy, financial services are all part of w=
hat CPAs, men and women throughout this country who are doing things every =
day, and yet those same men and women do a very good job of drawing the lin=
e and in fact are drawing the line today. HAYS: Thank you very much, Barry =
Melancon for joining us.=20
MELANCON: Thank you.=20
***
HAYS: Today, a federal judge in Houston held a hearing on whether to impoun=
d documents from Enron regarding the company`s collapse. The hearing follow=
ed allegations that documents were being shredded by Enron employees as rec=
ently as last week.=20
Tim O`Brien has the latest on today`s hearing. Hi, Tim.=20
O`BRIEN: Kind of a non-decision, Kathleen. Federal judge Melinda Harmon say=
s she wants to let the lawyers work out the details of any solution. And th=
e lawyers for the plaintiffs, representing investors and former employees, =
are said to be very close to agreement with the lawyers for Arthur Andersen=
.=20
The plan now is to allow the plaintiff`s lawyers and their experts total ac=
cess to all records which are being kept in four secure locations: Houston,=
 San Francisco, Chicago and New York. Attorneys for Andersen have already p=
romised, of course, no more documents would be shredded, no computer files =
deleted.=20
The plaintiff`s lawyers will have all the ordinary rights of discovery if t=
hey don`t get what they want or have any suspicions documents are being wit=
hheld or destroyed. Their remedy would be to go back to court.=20

Poor Kenny Boy=20
Will Durst - WorkingForChange.com
01.23.02 - SAN FRANCISCO -- Poor Kenneth Lay. Just this time last year he w=
as riding higher than bacteria on a gnat inside the ear of a giraffe with a=
 hyperactive pituitary. And now the powers that be are starting to pile on =
like he was a secret member of the Taliban's high command and they discover=
ed his black turban on a shelf in the closet behind the gay porn tapes.=20
This is all because Enron reportedly put a few employees' retirement in a b=
it of jeopardy, and Kenny Boy, as our hero President is wont to call him, m=
ight have sold a couple of shares of Enron stock while the company was expe=
riencing their minor financial setback.=20
It turns out there is an extremely logical and reasonable explanation for t=
his "suspicious" behavior. Mr. Lay was not trying to ditch his stockholders=
 and employees, but merely trying to raise some quick cash. To put it in th=
e simplest of terms, for the "layman": he used his millions of dollars in E=
nron stock to repay loans made to him by the company and then he would take=
 out more loans to repay money he owed on his other investments. That's all=
.=20
Of course Mr. Lay was concerned about Enron's health, that's why on Septemb=
er 26 he used an online chat to urge employees to buy Enron shares because =
the stock was "an incredible bargain" which it was. It's an even better bar=
gain now. Huge bargain as a matter of fact.=20
You know what, I think people are just jealous. And indignant. And pissed. =
And outraged. And bitter. And angry. Just because Enron didn't pay any inco=
me taxes four out of the last five years, although whose fault was that? Th=
e shred happy accounting firm of Arthur Anderson, that's who. And weren't t=
hey fired last week? Of course they were. By who? Enron. See, problem disco=
vered, action taken.=20
Of course, nobody cares what happens to Mr. Lay. Who's wringing their hands=
 over the fact this persecuted American has had to stay liquid by selling m=
ost of the properties he owns and pays taxes on all over this great nation =
of ours? No one. We're talking 3 out of the 4 homes he owned in Aspen, Colo=
rado. Now this beleaguered CEO only has one destination to stay while skiin=
g. How is one supposed to entertain when the help is staying in the same 12=
 bedroom manse as the guests?=20
The only consolation is though his name will be dragged through mud by a ve=
ngeful media, the man himself is destined to receive justice. It is very do=
ubtful any of the ten Congressional investigating committees will be able t=
o form a quorum for even considering an indictment. After all, 250 out of 5=
35 members of Congress received campaign contributions from Enron and that =
doesn't include the Attorney General's office, which has recused itself. As=
 a matter of fact, I'm pretty sure everyone in DC except for Monica Lewinsk=
y has recused themselves from this investigation. Perhaps Mr. Lay will take=
 some solace from the price an old Enron ethics manual being sold on Ebay r=
ight now for over $250 whose seller advertises it as being in mint conditio=
n. Hopefully Mr. Lay has a couple of cases of old manuals laying around the=
 garage. I doubt if any of them were ever used.=20

Your Invitation to Enron's Executive Forum

The Office of the Chairman would like to invite you to participate in an Enron Executive Forum.  This invitation is extended to those who attended an Executive Impact and Influence Program within the past few years.  These informal, interactive forums will be approximately 90 minutes in length and held several times per year.  

Most of the participants in the Executive Impact and Influence program have indicated a strong desire to express opinions, share ideas, and ask questions to the Office of the Chairman. Although attendance is not mandatory, the forums are designed to address those issues.  They also afford the Office of the Chairman opportunities to speak directly to its executive team, describe plans and initiatives, do "reality checks", create a "rallying point" and ensure Enron's executive management is on the "same page" about where Enron is going---and why.

We realize that individuals based outside the United States will not want to make a special trip to attend the meeting, but may be able to attend one of the sessions while they are in Houston on other business.  We also hope to schedule a similar session in London later this year.

We currently have a session planned for:

Wednesday, June 20, 2001 from 3:00 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. in Houston, EB50M

The Office of the Chairman will host the forum. Here's how it will work:
?	Each session will have approximately 25 participants.
?	The format will be honest, open, interactive dialogue.
?	This will be your forum. Don't expect to simply sit and listen to presentations.
?	This will not be the place for anonymity. You can safely ask your own questions and express your own opinions.
?	You can submit questions/issues in advance or raise them during the forum.
?	Some examples of topics you might want to discuss include, but are not limited to: the
direction of Enron, business goals/results, M&A activities, projects/initiatives, culture, leadership, management practices, diversity, values, etc.

Because the forum will work only if everyone actively participates, we encourage you to accept this invitation only if you intend to have something to say and if you are willing to allow others to do the same.  We also ask that you refrain from canceling your attendance once enrolled so that we will not have to cancel the forum.  The Office of the Chairman is very willing to take valuable time from their busy schedules to hold these forums.  Enrollments will be on a first come first served basis and we hope you would be able to honor your commitment to attend.  For planning purposes, it is essential that you RSVP no later than Monday, June 11, 2001 by return e-mail to Debbie Nowak, or via fax 713.646.8586.

We will confirm your registration with you, in writing and forward a list of enrollees to the Office of the Chairman.

Should you have any questions or concerns, please notify Gerry Gibson via e-mail (gerry.gibson@enron.com).  Gerry can also be reached at 713.345.6806.  

Thank you.

With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

Becky said they are going up in Jan.  She could probably find out the cost.
The other big issue is the bulk head starts for 10 and unders at Klein Oak.
I know that concerns some of my team's board members and Kleinwood's.  They
would rather be able to start all the races from the starting blocks at one
end of the pool.  We can do that at Klein but not at Klein Oak.

It seems like we would have approximately the same cost for air at Klein
Oak or Klein..  I guess the question is how much have the pool fees gone
up from last year and does that make it too expensive to have air.  Who
knows the prices?

Subject:	Move Related Issues

As you all know, our move is scheduled for this weekend.  Hopefully,  you and your groups are all progressing well in your preparations for the move this Friday. Please take the time to read the information contained in this message because most of the information contains reminders or FYI items and will be important to you and your group.  Please forward this to those in your group that may need this information.  

?	Voicemail instructions - Please have everyone in your group clear all new voicemail messages by 5:00 PM, Friday, 11/16.  All saved messages, greetings and recorded names will be saved.  If a message is left before cutover the message will be saved, but the message light will not be displayed when you arrive.  As a precautionary meassure please check voice mail upon your arrival Monday morning even if the message light isn't on.  

?	Building access - ECS will not be available for general access until Monday morning at 5:00 AM.  Due to the gas and power moves being combined, it is unlikely that the move team will be prepared for the POC's to come in on Sunday to unpack.  (Separate instructions will be generated for those who are needed to test trading applications.)  NOTE: Only those whose names have been approved and submitted to security will be allowed access on Sunday.
o	Monday - 5:00 AM for all employees

?	Security & badges -  All POC team members should be familiar with the routes into ECS as we discussed at our recent move meeting.  Please be sure to share this information with all of the people in your group.  If you need additional copies of the floor plans that have the access routes highlighted, please contact Carli Smith (5-3473). Please stress to everyone to have their badges with them at all times.  No one will be allowed access without their badge.  If anyone tries to access the building from the garage via the skyring and they do not have their badge, they will be sent back through the garage to the street level to walk across the street to the round kiosk in the Enron building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed back to ECS via the 2nd floor and the skyring.

?	Move team colors - As mentioned at the move meeting, the following is a list of the color designations (vests) for the various teams that will be on the floor when we move in.  
o	Red - Move Team
o	Orange - Desktop Support/IT
o	Green - Telephony

?	Newspaper subscriptions - The delivery location for all newspaper subscriptions need to be changed to ECS 05/06.  It is our intention to have all daily newspapers delivered to the mail desk located in the ECS 2nd floor corridor.  It will be the responsibility of the assistants to either pick up the papers for their group or designate someone in their group to pick up the papers.  If your papers continue to be delivered to your old floor of ECN, contact Sunny Rodgers (3-6116).

?	Move boxes -  Please encourage your group to pack and bring no more than about 6 boxes per person.  You may call Facilities (3-6300) if you need to request additional boxes.

?	Move labels -  If you run out of labels or if you are missing any labels, please call Carli Smith (5-3473) to have additional or missing labels printed.

?	Laptops - Important - Please ensure that all cable locks have been removed from all laptop computers by 5:00 PM on Friday.  If any cable locks are left on the computers they will be destroyed by the move team in order to move the computers as scheduled.

.	Bottled water - Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispenses filtered water.  The large bottles of water (5 gallon) will not be allowed on the floor.  We would also like   to discourage the use of small bottles of water due to limited storage space and the availability of filtered water at several locations.  

?	Phone sets - Although most of you are aware of this, we just wanted to remind you that there will be only one phone on each desk - either a turret or an Avaya, but not both.  Do not tag your phones, a new phone will be waiting for each person on their desk in the new building

I hope I have covered some of the outstanding questions or issues you might have, but if I have missed something, please let me know.  Thanks so much for all your help and hard work.

At Least Two Bids Seen For Enron Trading Ops - Lawyer

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) expects at least two bidders to come in Monday with offers to jump-start the energy company's trading operations.
"We expect bids today. Probably two or more," said Martin Bienenstock, a lawyer who represents Enron in its bankruptcy proceedings in New York. 
Bienenstock declined to identify possible bidders. 
But a person familiar with the matter said that Citigroup (C), one of Enron's main creditors, would likely be among those bidding for Enron's trading assets. 
Bids are due by 4 p.m. EST Monday. An auction will be held Thursday.

Enron Trading Ops - 2: Bids Won't Include Cash

01/07/2002
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Under a plan designed to bring back some value to its trading operations - including EnronOnline which, until not so long ago, accounted for 25% of all wholesale energy trading in the U.S. - Enron has been looking for a 51% partner with great credit worthiness to form a joint venture. 
Under the joint venture, dubbed New Energy Trading Operations, or NETCO, Enron and its partner would be sharing revenue.
The deal is crucial to Enron's creditors, including Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM), because it's seen as key for those lenders and others to recoup some of the money lost in the Enron's meltdown. 
Citigroup was first expected to emerge as a stalking horse that could have flamed interest from other parties. But that didn't happened. Swiss banking giant UBS AG (UBS) and Goldman Sachs Group (GS) and American International Group Inc. (AIG) have also been reported as a potential bidders. 
Enron's lawyer Bienenstock said that he didn't expect the bids to include any financial payments from the outside parties. 
"This is not about money," Bienenstock said. "We're getting creditworthiness and they're getting a gigantic value in assets." 
Enron hopes that an alliance with a big-name bidder like Citigroup, UBS or Goldman would bring back customers who began fleeing Enron's trading floors in November when prospects of a merger between Enron and rival Dynegy Inc. (DYN) started fading. 
Although Enron has said that it was looking for a 51% partner, the final structure of the venture may vary depending on the bidders' needs, Bienenstock said. 
"Each bidder has its own particular needs and own desires," the Enron lawyer said. 
Court documents show that Enron intends to contribute software and hardware to NETCO, not specifying what exact assets are up for grab. 
Bienenstock said he didn't expect a lawsuit brought by software company Solarc Inc. against Enron for copyright infringement to complicate the bidding process. 
"If there was infringement, that could be offset against future distribution" of revenue, he said. 
Each bidder will have to make a $25 million deposit to prove the validity of its offer. But that deposit will be returned if a bid isn't accepted or if no cash contribution is part of the actual offer. 
Meanwhile, this week's bidding process will likely affect how much financing Enron gets at the end of the month. 
The energy company is now expected to receive less than the $1.5 billion in debtor-in-possession financing first agreed to after it filed for bankruptcy on Dec. 2. 
As reported, Enron's better-than-expected cash position, now seen around $400 million to $500 million, and continued reluctance by Wall Street to back a new Enron loan are likely to contribute to a much smaller DIP package. 
"We haven't discussed it yet," Bienenstock said of the new DIP plan. 
Final approval of the interim financing is scheduled for Jan. 30.

Enron fighting push to move bankruptcy case here
The Houston Chronicle
Jan. 7, 1:58 PM

NEW YORK - Enron Corp. is fighting a push by creditors to move the former energy trading giant's bankruptcy case from New York to its hometown of Houston.

Many of the creditors are located in the Houston area or others parts of the West. They were to be heard today by a bankruptcy judge in New York, where Enron filed for Chapter 11 protection. 
Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez said today as the hearing began that he doesn't intend to rule today but expects to do so by the end of the week.

Large creditors, such as energy traders Dynegy and El Paso Corp., and smaller ones, like the Southern Ute Indian Tribe of Colorado, believe it would be more convenient and economical to hear the case near the location of many Enron creditors and assets. Dynegy and El Paso are based in Houston.

In a motion filed by Dynegy and other creditors, lawyers also say there is "an emotional interest to be served" by moving the case to Houston, where thousands of Enron employees were laid off and many more witnessed the rapid evaporation of their retirement plans when the company's stock plummeted.

Also today, at least two companies were expected to make bids for a majority stake in Enron's wholesale energy trading unit, a lawyer for the company said.

Enron lawyer Martin Bienenstock, of Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP in New York, said he expects Enron's core business, which needs a credit-worthy partner to resume operations, to fetch "probably two bids or more" by the 4 p.m. deadline. An auction is scheduled for Thursday. 
With regard to the change-of-venue hearing, analysts say creditors are also hoping for a potentially more favorable hearing in Houston, whose economy has suffered as a result of Enron's demise.

Lawyers for Enron, and a handful of creditors opposed to relocating the proceedings, are expected to argue that it would be less expensive and more accomodating if the case were administered in New York, home to the armies of lawyers and bankers working on both sides. 
Howard B. Comet, an attorney for Weil, Gotshal and Manges, said it would also be easier for business partners and potential witnesses involved in Enron's worldwide operations to participate if the proceedings took place in New York.

"The focus of the financial restructuring is here," Comet said.

Citigroup Inc. of New York, Barclays Bank PLC of London and Dresdner Bank AG of Frankfurt are among the creditors opposed to changing venues.

Under the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure, a case may be transferred from one district court to another "in the interest of justice or for the convenience of the parties." The basic criteria considered by judges ruling on previous change-of-venue motions have been: the proximity of creditors, debtors and witnesses; the location of assets, and the cost.

"Judges have considerable discretion in making the call," said Robert Christmas, a bankruptcy expert with the law firm Nixon Peabody LLP in New York.

Christmas said moving the case to Houston would create "an atmosphere of pressure that does not exist in New York."

"That gives creditors the ability to have unhappy employees tramping around the courthouse," he said.

Christmas said few cases of this size have ever been moved, but that Judge Gonzalez could be swayed by the fact that so many of Enron's energy-trading partners are located in and around Houston.

Cases have been moved in the past if there were a lot of small creditors based in one area. However, new technologies have made it possible for interested parties to participate in the proceedings from thousands of miles away. For example, Houston-based lawyers for Enron creditors gave testimony last week via teleconference.

Enron collapsed late last year when revelations of questionable accounting practices and mounting debt caused investors and traders to lose confidence in the company. Its stock price, trading above $85 a year ago, is now firmly below $1 per share.

Enron's filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy law on Dec. 2 in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. One of the company's smaller subsidiaries, Enron Metals and Commodity Corp., is based there.

Lawyers for the Southern Ute tribe, a natural gas supplier, said the decision to file for bankruptcy in New York "is indicative of Enron's desperation to avoid facing the facts at its home in Houston."

Enron Plans to Release 4th-Quarter Results, Balance Sheet in March

01/07/2002
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Dow Jones Newswires 
NEW YORK -- Enron Corp. doesn't plan to announce its fourth-quarter results until March and breaking with past practice, will also release its balance sheet at the same time, according to company spokesman Mark Palmer.
In the past, Enron (ENE), once the largest trader of energy in the U.S., issued its financial results shortly after the close of the quarter. However, the company normally doesn't release its balance sheet until weeks later, in its quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
The idea is to announce the results and file with the SEC at the same time, Mr. Palmer said on Monday. 
Enron, which filed for bankruptcy in early December, was criticized by some investors for not providing enough information in its earnings reports. 
The Houston-based energy trader caught investors off guard when it reported a $618 million loss in the third quarter, and a sharp reduction in shareholder equity related to the unwinding of a financial partnership with its former chief financial officer. In the days that followed, information about the company's financial situation continued to be uncovered. 
Eventually, Enron was forced to restate earnings for several years, reducing its net income during the period by several hundred million dollars.

Enron Shareholders File Class Action Lawsuit Vs Dynegy
By Erwin Seba

01/07/2002
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Two Enron Corp. (ENE) shareholders filed a class action lawsuit Thursday against Dynegy Inc. (DYN) in Harris County District Court in Houston.
The shareholders allege they were harmed, as potential third-party beneficiaries, when Dynegy canceled a proposed merger with Enron in November of last year. 
"Dynegy breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing by, among other things, its wrongful termination of the merger agreement, its failure to continue with and diligently pursue the merger, its falsely representing that it was conducting its due diligence when it had no right to terminate the merger agreement based upon due diligence, and by raising issues as to Dynegy's intent to complete the merger with Enron and then backing out of a fully negotiated transaction, causing the ratings agencies to lower Enron credit ratings and a dramatic loss in business," according to the court filing. 
Bringing the suit are Bernard Shapiro, a New York state resident who owned 11,750 Enron common shares as of Nov. 28, and Peter Strub, a New Jersey resident who own 553.216 Enron common shares as of Nov. 28. 
Shapiro and Strub are suing on behalf of all those who owned Enron stock on Nov. 28, 2001. According to the court filing, the class may include "several hundred thousand" members. 
The two men are represented by Thomas E. Bilek, of the Houston law firm of Hoeffner & Bilek L.L.P. 
This is the second Enron shareholder lawsuit filed against Dynegy for canceling the merger.

BN Amro's Gaw Comments on the Impact of the Enron Collapse
2002-01-07 16:19 (New York)

     New York, Jan. 7 (Bloomberg) -- Peter D. Gaw, vice president
and managing director for energy at ABN Amro Holding NV's North
America unit, comments on the impact of Enron's bankruptcy on the
investment community and energy companies.
     Enron, once the largest energy trader, filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection on Dec. 2, after disclosures about its
finances and bookkeeping shook investor confidence. Enron used
``off-balance sheet'' partnerships to shift debt from its books,
for example.
     Gaw was speaking at a conference sponsored by the New York
Society of Security Analysts and the Electric Power Supply
Association.

     ``December 2 was Pearl Harbor for the industry. But the
industry as a whole did a good job of unwinding its positions.
There were no serious problems.''

     On the reaction of the investment community to Enron's
collapse:
     ``We were asking the tough questions of Enron. We just
weren't demanding the answers. Now we are focusing on quality of
earnings, mark-to-market accounting and cash growth. We are
looking for a simplified financial structure, but that doesn't
mean everything on an off-balance sheet basis is bad. But the
financial community will be much more critical.''

     On the response of energy companies and their plans for new
power plants:
     ``Companies are trying to reduce debt, sell assets and make
their financial statements solid and clear, so I don't think we'll
see a lot of new projects in the first half of this year.''

Duke Energy was once considered the hopelessly asset-encumbered version of Enron. Nowadays that's not such a bad thing. 
A year ago Duke Energy was a wallflower in the frenetic dance of the energy traders. As Enron pursued its now infamous asset-light strategy, casting off power plants and pipelines to focus on wholesale trading, Duke remained wrapped in a protective mantle of $34 billion in hard assets. By September 2000 Enron was trading at 67 times earnings, while Duke's multiple was 20.
Suddenly Duke's assets no longer look like liabilities. Enron is bankrupt, and Dynegy and El Paso are struggling to maintain their bond ratings. But thanks to its more cautious strategy--bolstered by ownership of the Carolinas' largest electric utility and an interstate pipeline system--Duke has a shining A+ rating from Standard & Poor's, just one notch below that of J.P. Morgan Chase. 
That allows Duke to keep expanding as rivals pull back. While Enron was melting down in mid-November, Duke raised $750 million in a stock offering--to help pay for the $8.5 billion acquisition of Westcoast Energy, a Canadian pipeline operator. Westcoast, in turn, will give Charlotte, N.C.-based Duke a powerful trading position in California and the Pacific Northwest as gas takes on increasing importance as a fuel for electricity plants. 
Like most of Duke's assets, the new pipeline will serve primarily as a vehicle for wringing more profits out of Duke's $15-billion-a-year trading operation. A pipeline can provide a 7% return on invested capital, but the real money is in selling hedges and derivatives based on Duke's ability to deliver gas. "You don't make money off an asset simply because you own it," says Richard Priory, Duke's chief executive. "You trade around it." 
Trading has been the fuel for Duke's fifteenfold revenue increase since 1995 to an estimated $70 billion in 2001. But don't expect Duke to fill the void created by Enron's collapse. Where Enron made a market in just about anything, from long-term gas supply contracts to memory chips, Priory demands that Duke's traders stick to the commodities Duke transports through its pipelines or generates in its power plants. That unadventurous strategy keeps a damper on earnings growth--Duke predicts earnings-per-share growth of a modest 10% to 15% over a base of $2.10 in 2000 going forward another two years--but ensures it will be around next Christmas. 
Duke's transformation from a geographically constrained Southern utility to trading giant came about during the first rumblings of deregulation. What's surprising is the resolutely conservative biography of the guy who made it happen. Priory, 55, grew up in a single-parent household in Lakehurst, N.J. His mother couldn't afford to pay college tuition, so he landed an engineering scholarship at West Virginia Institute of Technology, later receiving a master's degree from Princeton University. After a few years teaching engineering at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, he joined Duke Power in 1976 as a design engineer, rising steadily to president by 1994. 
By the time he took charge, Priory was convinced the traditional utility-business model no longer worked. He'd followed the generic playbook for utilities in the early 1990s, slashing employment and boosting efficiency (Duke Power's payroll fell from a high of 25,000 to 10,000). But there was only so much more cutting he could do. Then he'd be stuck in charge of a regional utility with single-digit earnings growth. A rate increase would take you only a little way out of this mire. He could gussy up the utility for sale, or he could pursue some of the outlandish strategies then coming into style, like buying developing-country power plants or investing in unrelated businesses. 
Instead Priory placed all his bets on a deceptively simple concept--convergence between the markets for gas and electricity. Duke wasn't the best place to be thinking such thoughts: The regulated utility still generates almost all its electricity with coal or nuclear fuel. But Priory knew that natural gas would become the fuel of choice for virtually all new generating plants. If he could combine his utility with a gas company, a new world of trading opportunities would open up. When the price of gas rose, he'd buy electricity and sell gas. If electricity prices rose, he'd buy gas and sell the juice. The key was owning the assets on all sides of the trade so he wasn't just speculating with shareholders' money. 
At the same time Priory was looking for a partner in the gas business, Paul Anderson, chief executive of Panenergy, a big Houston gas pipeline company once known as Panhandle Eastern, was looking for a utility. Anderson wasn't coy about his quest: He put a lightbulb on the cover of the 1995 annual report, not because Panenergy was in the electricity business, but because he wanted it to be. "I talked to the CEO of just about every electric utility in the U.S." recalls Anderson, now chief executive of Melbourne, Australia-based BHP Billiton Group. "When I got to Priory, I basically found out he had the same view of the world as I did." 
What made Priory stand out was his commitment to changing the way Duke did business, from a focus on finessing state regulators and running power plants and transmission lines to capitalizing on larger market forces that influenced the values of those assets. Anderson had already put Panenergy through that transformation by acquiring Associated Natural Gas, a Denver trading company, two years before. With Associated's 1,500 traders as shock troops, Anderson had changed Panenergy from an inward-focused pipeline operator into an accomplished trading house. The market had voted its approval by marking up Panenergy's stock fivefold over five years. Could some of that energizing be transferred to Duke with a merger? 
In August 1996 Priory, Anderson and their lieutenants met at a hotel in Memphis to hash out the details. Talking through the night, they arrived at a plan for Duke to take over Panenergy and bring its strategy of asset-based trading to the North Carolina utility. Anderson would be chief operating officer and other top Panenergy executives would still hold key jobs. 
There was grumbling from the utility side. "Some people were saying, 'Hey, I thought this was a takeover,'" Anderson recalls. But the merger went smoothly. It was understood from the start that Priory would remain in charge; so at the end of 1998 Anderson left to run BHP, then an Australian mining conglomerate. (Not surprisingly, he's since acquired a trading firm.) 
The basic strategy hashed out in that Memphis hotel hasn't changed. Duke views every asset, whether it's a pipeline or a 500-megawatt power plant, as holding both intrinsic and extrinsic value. The intrinsic value is the ability for the asset to make money. In the case of a power plant, that includes the location of the plant and the efficiency with which it transforms gas into electricity. Duke can't do much to change the inherent value of its assets, and it assumes competition will eliminate any edge it has anyway. 
The only way to make money, therefore, is to maximize the extrinsic value by trading around the assets (see chart). When it builds a power plant, for example, it sells some of the expected output in the forward market and buys the gas to fuel that output. As construction proceeds, the difference between the price of gas and the price of electricity widens and narrows, giving Duke the opportunity to sell more of the expected output if the price rises or sell output in future years to lock in profits on electricity it has yet to generate. Duke did this with a pair of "peaker" plants it built in Indiana and Ohio, locking in the first year's expected profits before construction was completed. 
If the traders sense a market is becoming too competitive, they may call for the outright sale of the plant. Duke did that in Hidalgo, Tex., where it sold a majority stake in a 500-megawatt plant for $235 million to Calpine in 2000, three months before it was completed, and mothballed five other projects in the face of rampant overbuilding. 
Duke is keeping the undeveloped sites--long-call options, as it were--on the possibility that electricity will become profitable again in Texas. In the meantime it's building 11 more plants around the country, as part of a diversification strategy designed to weather what could be severe downturns in the electricity market in certain regions such as Texas and the Midwest. 
Prices--whether of generating capacity or of energy--fluctuate. The traders with staying power are in the best position to capitalize on these fluctuations. That's why Goldman Sachs can make more money trading bonds than you can. And that's why Duke can make more money than Calpine.

ONGC spurns BG operatorship offer once again
Our Corporate Bureau MUMBAI

Copyright (c) Business Standard

The Oil and Gas Corporation (ONGC) has rejected yet another offer of the UK-based oil and gas major BG Group Plc, to become an operator in the three offshore oil and gas fields - Tapti, Mukta and Panna - on the western coast of India. 
Subir Raha, chairman and managing director of ONGC told newspersons here that BG had offered a cash settlement on December 20 asking us to respond by December 21. "We have rejected the offer as it was not sufficiently responsive".
This is a second offer made by the BG group. It withdrew its earlier offer of giving 10 per cent stake in an exploratory gas block in Brazil provided it relinquishes its claim as operator of these three discovered oil and gas fields. 
BG Group entered into an agreement with the beleaguered US energy major Enron Corporation to acquire 30 per cent equity in these three fields for $ 388 million. 
The offer is conditional on being granted operatorship of these fields. 
"BG went and made a deal with Enron. BG came and asked us to give them operatorship saying they could improve the running of the fields. We asked them why do you think we can't do the same?" Raha said. 
Elaborating on the cash settlement, another ONGC official said that BG offered to withdraw a case of arbitration where Enron billed $4.5 million as additional expenses incurred on these fields. BG offered to withdraw the case and offered $11.5 million cash in lieu of the foregoing operatorship ONGC claims on these three fields. ONGC owns 40 per cent and Reliance Industries, the remaining 30 per cent in the Panna, Mukta and Tapti fields.

(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- IntercontinentalExchange, an online energy and metals marketplace, grew its trade volume 15-fold and increased the number of participating firms and users more than 400% in 2001, ICE said Monday. 
ICE volume and new-user interest skyrocketed in the autumn as Enron Corp. (ENE) filed for bankruptcy protection and suspended trade on its EnronOnline Internet-based trading platform.
Capping off the year, ICE set a new daily record Dec. 27 with natural gas trading of 500 billion cubic feet, breaking by 18% the previous daily record set Dec. 4, ICE said. 
More than 400 commodity trading firms execute trades on ICE. The platform matches many buyers and sellers, providing less counterparty credit risk than platforms offering the same counterparty in every deal. 
Intercontinental Exchange, based in Atlanta, launched its metals trading on the Internet in August 2000 and its energy trading in October 2000. 
ICE partners include American Electric Power Co. (AEP); Aquila Energy (ILA); BP Amoco PLC (BP); Deutsche Bank AG (G.DBK); Duke Energy (DUK); El Paso Corp. (EPG); Goldman Sachs Group (GS); Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. (MWD); Reliant Energy (REI); Royal Dutch/Shell Group (RD); Societe Generale SA (F.SGF) unit SG Investment Banking; Mirant Corp. (MIR); TotalFina Elf SA (TOT); and Continental Power Exchange, which provided the trading technology and management team.

Enron To Tap Restructuring Expert To Replace Ex-CEO Lay

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Who Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) taps to replace Kenneth Lay as the company's chief executive will provide clues about the future shape of the bankrupt company.
Lay resigned late Wednesday amid pressure from the company's creditors committee. Enron, once the nation's largest energy trading company, now is preparing a search for a chief restructuring officer to serve as an interim chief executive. 
In an e-mail to employees, Lay said, the restructuring specialist would join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations. 
The decision was applauded by Enron's creditors committee, which is using its clout to exert its will over how the company reorganizes in order to protect its interests. 
"The creditors committee is pleased with Ken Lay's and the Enron board's decision regarding Ken Lay's departure," said Luc Despins, a partner at Milbank Tweed, the firm representing Enron's creditors committee. 
"The creditors committee views this as a step in the right direction to maximize value for all creditors. The committee is encouraged that Enron is proceeding with the retention of a chief restructuring officer," he said. 
Despins declined to comment on what qualities the creditors committee would be looking for in a candidate, or how long the process might take. 
Sources familiar with turnaround efforts and executive recruitment said the process will be swift, and a decision could be made in few days. 
These people say Enron's next step will be to form a search committee made up of members of the creditors committee and the board. Next, the committee would work with a recruitment firm to identify candidates and make a selection and offer to the candidate. He or she would need to be approved by the bankruptcy court, one of the sources said. 
Enron spokesman Vance Meyer said he couldn't immediately comment on the details of the selection process. However, he said, Enron was in "an active search." 
There is a small pool of turnaround experts that come to mind, one executive recruiter said. The list includes individuals such as Robert S. Miller, currently chairman and chief executive of Bethlehem Steel Corp. (BS). 
Miller, who is best known for negotiating the 1980 loan bailout of Chrysler Corp, wasn't immediately available to comment. However, through a Bethlehem Steel spokeswoman, he said he remains committed to helping restructure the Bethlehem, Pa., steel company. 
"I made a personal commitment in September 2001 to the board of directors and to the employees of Bethlehem Steel Corp. to work with the firm until it was on stable ground," Miller said. 
Beyond executives who specifically deal in restructuring, there are those like financier Carl Icahn, who are famed for their ability to dismantle a company and eke out the value of its assets. 
Although it isn't necessary that the individual come from the energy industry, knowledge of the sector is helpful. 
Whoever is chosen, the person's reputation and background will say a lot about the strategy Enron's board and its creditors committee plan to take in the restructuring, said John Challenger, chief executive of Challenger Gray and Christmas, a Chicago-based outplacement firm.
As for Lay, he will remain on Enron's board. 

In his email to employees Wednesday, Lay cited the distractions caused by "multiple inquiries and investigations" as one factor contributing to his decision to resign. 

Both Lay and Earl Silbert, a Washington, D.C.-based attorney representing Lay, weren't available for comment. 

Lay's departure follows other recent exits. Vice Chairman  Mark Frevert left at the end of December, and Greg Whalley, Enron's president and chief operating officer, will join Swiss bank UBS AG (UBS), which acquired Enron's trading operations on Jan. 18. 

Both Frevert and Whalley were part of Enron's office of the chairman. The lone remaining member of office of the chairman is Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon, who was named chief financial officer after Andrew Fastow was forced to resign. 

Questions regarding an off-balance sheet financing vehicle run by Fastow sparked the initial inquiry into Enron's finances by the Securities and Exchange commission. 

Enron's Myer said he wasn't immediately sure whether others would be promoted to the office of chairman. 

Other departures include that of Mike McConnell, who was president of Enron Global Markets. 

According to Meyer, some of the resignations reflect Enron's restructuring efforts. 

Since filing for bankruptcy protection in early December, some of Enron's assets have been sold off or have  suffered.

USA: White House - Lay resignation will not deter probe.

(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

WASHINGTON, Jan 24 (Reuters) - The resignation of Enron Corp chairman Kenneth Lay will not deter the administration from seeking answers to the energy trading firm's spectacular collapse, a White House spokesman said on Thursday. 
Asked about Wednesday's resignation of Lay, a friend and major political supporter of President George W. Bush, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said, "Nothing changes the determination of this administration to help protect people's pensions."
"I know that no matter what happens to one individual there, even if that individual is a friend of the president's or is a supporter of the president's, nothing is going to stop the president and this administration from pursuing justice," he said. 
Enron is facing multiple congressional and federal investigations over its collapse, which threw thousands of employees out of work and devastated investors, including employees whose pension plans were heavily invested in Enron stock.

Enron auditor ripped as hearings open 
Congressional probes of energy firm's collapse begin

Surrounded by counsel, David Duncan invoked the Fifth Amendment Thursday in order not to testify before a Congressional panel investigating actions surrounding Enron's collapse.

MSNBC STAFF AND WIRE REPORTS

WASHINGTON, Jan. 24 -  The chairman of a House panel investigating Enron's collapse asserted Thursday that the shredding of records by Enron accountant Arthur Andersen clearly 'compounded the catastrophic business failure' of the energy giant. Top Andersen executives responded to the criticism by telling the panel that David Duncan, its lead partner for auditing Enron's books, was largely responsible for the most of the destruction of documents sought by government investigators.

AS EXPECTED, Duncan refused to testify at the House hearing, invoking his right under the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution. 
       Rep. Jim Greenwood, R-Pa., said that the decision by Duncan not to testify "will hamper the important work of this committee in our search for the truth that what transpired at Andersen during the critical period we are examining." 
       The hearing came a day after Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay, who has close ties to President Bush, resigned his post. 
       As the House panel pursued the document destruction at Andersen, the Senate Governmental Affairs Committees planned to question former regulators and other experts on whether the government failed to exercise proper oversight of Enron. 
       The Securities and Exchange Commission started looking into Enron's accounting in mid-October, after the company reported a third-quarter loss of more than $600 million. The agency's inquiry eventually included demands for financial documents from Enron and Andersen. 
       Enron's slide into the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history on Dec. 2 left thousands of employees without jobs and their retirement savings all but gone because the funds had been tied largely to now-nearly worthless Enron stock. Other investors and creditors also have lost hundreds of millions of dollars.
       At least 11 congressional committees plan hearings on the collapse of what once was the nation's seventh-largest corporation. 
       While reports emerged this week of document shredding at Enron's Houston headquarters as well, the focus of the House subcommittee, for the time being, is on the destruction of Enron-related papers at Anderson at a time last fall when the energy giant was descending toward bankruptcy.
       Last week, Andersen fired Duncan because of his role in Enron-related document destruction in October and November, just as Enron's problems were publicly emerging and the SEC began a formal investigation. 
       But Duncan has claimed to investigators that he was following company guidance on document destruction laid out in an Oct. 12 e-mail from Andersen corporate attorney Nancy Temple at the firm's Chicago headquarters.
       Temple and Dorsey Baskins Jr., managing director of Andersen's professional standards group, were expected to be quizzed by the House panel as to why the memo was written and on the firm's normal paper shredding policies. The company claims the Temple memo was routine and aimed only to combat the "pack-rat" mentality of many accountants. 
       Duncan's interpretation of the Oct. 12 memo reflected a sinister view, one supported by another Andersen manager, Michael C. Odom, who also has told investigators he viewed the memo as unusual. He also has been subpoenaed to testify.
       And a new Andersen document, obtained from committee sources Wednesday, also suggests the Temple directive was more than routine. In the Oct. 24 memo from a manager, employees were told the document shredding was so important that it should be pursued even "on an overtime basis, if necessary for the remainder of this week or for however long it takes." 
       Investigators also may question Temple about a warning by Duncan last October that Enron's explanation for huge third-quarter losses might be misleading investors. Duncan expressed his concerns to Enron officials on Oct. 15, a day before the losses were announced with no change, according to several memos made available by the House subcommittee.
       But if lawmakers had hoped to hear from Duncan, they have been disappointed.
       Robert Giuffra Jr., one of Duncan's attorneys, informed the subcommittee 
       Wednesday that the Duncan has not had time to prepare, has not had access to critical documents and will testify only if given immunity - as is his right under the Fifth Amendment.
       "Mr. Duncan seeks the full disclosure of the truth" and will continue to cooperate with the congressional investigations as well as those by the Justice Department and the SEC, Giuffra wrote.
       Kenneth Johnson, a spokesman for the full committee, said the panel did not want to impede a criminal investigation at the Justice Department, so it rejected the immunity request as well as a request by Duncan that he not be required to appear.
       
ANDERSEN OFFICIALS DECRY SHREDDING

       Meanwhile, Andersen partner C.E. Andrews and Andersen managing director Dorsey Baskin, in written testimony to the House subcommittee, said the destruction by Duncan was wrong and that the auditing firm has taken steps in response.
       "Our investigation indicated that he directed the purposeful destruction of a very substantial volume of documents - and in doing so, he gave every appearance of destroying these materials in anticipation of a government request for documents," the two said.
       Duncan has said through his lawyers he did not do anything wrong but was simply following instructions from Temple and is cooperating with government investigators.
       "The case of Mr. Duncan was clear enough to allow us to draw conclusions about his responsibility at an early stage of the inquiry. That is not true of other Andersen personnel who were involved with the destruction of documents," the two Andersen executives told the House subcommittee on oversight and investigations.
       "Our investigation into the destruction of documents by Andersen personnel is far from complete," they said.

Enron Executives Depart, Trader Seeks New Leaders
2002-01-24 16:00 (New York)

     Houston, Jan. 24 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. executives are leaving the company as it struggles to survive the largest U.S. bankruptcy case, while creditors began exerting power to salvage the remains of the fallen energy trading giant.
     A day after Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay resigned amid pressure from the creditors, the company stepped up the search for new management to rescue it from oblivion.
     Officials at three New York-based consulting firms that specialize in turning around failing businesses are the front runners to replace Lay, people close to the company said. They areAlvarez & Marsal, Glass & Associates Inc. and Zolfo Cooper LLC, the people said.
     ``My guess is Enron will get sold off in pieces and the creditors will be left to fight over the bones,'' said Al Koch, chief operating officer of turnaround consulting firm Jay Alix & Associates.
     Creditors are concerned Enron may be worth less than they thought, analysts say. That means they're likely to get a fraction of the more than $40 billion they're owed.
     With Lay's departure, Enron plans to choose a turnaround specialist to run the company until a permanent replacement is found, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said. For now, Chief Financial Officer Jeff McMahon and Stan Horton, chairman and chief executive of Enron Global Services, are in charge, Palmer said.

Perceptions

     Deborah Hicks Midanek, a senior official at Glass & Associates, declined to comment on whether her firm might be named to lead Enron's reorganization.
     ``Stabilizing perceptions'' of Enron is of paramount importance, she said. ``Enron needs to restore confidence that the company is being handled in a responsible manner.''
     Bryan Marsal, co-head of Alvarez & Marsal, declined to comment. His partner, Tony Alvarez, is chief executive officer of apparel maker Warnaco Group Inc.
     Stephen Cooper of Zolfo Cooper didn't return phone calls seeking comment.
     Lay's resignation was intended to fend off appointment of a Chapter 11 trustee in the case, experts say. A Chapter 11 trustee would supplant Enron's top officials and its board of directors.
The trustee would likely name a new law firm to replace Weil, Gotshal & Manges as Enron's bankruptcy attorneys.
     A group of creditors led by Wiser Oil Co. and Nuevo Energy Co., former Enron trading partners, has asked U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez in Manhattan to appoint a Chapter 11 trustee to run Enron's North American operations.

`Fed Up'

     ``Motions by creditors to appoint a trustee or administrator is a clear indication that they are fed up,'' said Nancy Rapoport, dean of the University of Houston Law Center. ``There's a lack of confidence in Lay.''
     Lay's attorney, Earl Silbert, and Luc Despins, an attorney for Enron's creditors' committee, didn't return phone calls.
     To oust management and have a trustee appointed, creditors must show management has been incompetent or committed fraud, said Patrick A. Murphy, a lawyer with San Francisco's Murphy Shenemen Julian & Rogers.
     Document shredding and suggestions the true state of the company's financial health was covered up might be adequate grounds to name a trustee, lawyers suing Enron said.
     ``If this were a smaller case, this would result in the instant appointment of a trustee,'' said David M. Bennett, a Dallas lawyer representing some Enron creditors.
     Enron's slide into insolvency has devastated its executive ranks. Of the 14 executives listed in the company's annual 10-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in April, at least half, including former Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Skilling and former Vice Chairman Clifford Baxter, are no longer with the company.

Departures

     Vice Chairman Mark Frevert said in interview that he left the company at the end of the year. Frevert said he ``really can't say'' whether he quit or was fired.
     Greg Whalley, president and chief operating officer, is set to join Swiss bank UBS AG, which acquired Enron's trading operation on Jan. 18, according to the sale documents.
     In early December, Enron paid $55 million to 500 employees to persuade them to stay at the company for 90 days. Three-fourths of the employees held positions below the rank of vice president at the time.
     McMahon became CFO in October, after the ouster of Andrew Fastow, who set up and ran many of the private partnerships that led to Enron's demise. McMahon, a certified public accountant, joined Enron in 1994 from MG Natural Gas Corp., where he was CFO.
     Phone calls to Enron seeking comment from McMahon and Whalley weren't returned.

Seeking Control

     With most of Enron's more desirable assets sold or withering, creditors have stepped up efforts to control what's left of the company.
     In court papers filed yesterday, the creditors' committee asked a bankruptcy judge for permission to investigate Enron's former auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, to help it prepare possible legal action against the accounting firm.
     Enron fired Andersen last week after the firm admitted employees destroyed Enron-related documents.
     Lay's resignation comes amid a dozen government investigations and more than 50 civil lawsuits into Enron's collapse. The company filed bankruptcy Dec. 2 and fired more than 4,500 employees after it admitted overstating profit by $586 million since 1997.

UBS Moves To Start Up Former Enron US Energy Trade Ops
By Mark Golden and John Edmiston

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- UBS AG (UBS) unit UBS-Warburg took a step forward Thursday in its restart of the acquired North American energy trading unit of Enron Corp. (ENRNQ).
UBS Warburg management asked all Enron employees that had accepted employment offers or intended to do so to attend a hastily called orientation meeting in Houston at the posh Houstonian Hotel. About 700 employees attended thee meeting, where they were given basic information about UBS and dealt with routine employment matters, attendees outside the hotel said. 
The employees were told that they would hear more about UBS' vision for the trading unit next week. 
UBS declined to comment on the meeting. 
UBS has offered jobs to the vast majority of Enron's North American energy trading staff, and many of those workers have already signed employment contracts, Enron and UBS employees said. The unit is expected to start trading next month. 
"Our goal is to reestablish the business," UBS spokesman David Walker said. "The buildup will be measured and focused on customer needs." 
In a deal approved by the bankruptcy court last week, UBS will take ownership of Enron's North American energy trading operations. The transaction involves no cash, but Enron will collect a third of the unit's profits for 10 years. UBS can begin to buy out Enron's interest in Year 3 of the deal. 
Walker declined to comment on whether UBS expects its energy trading volume to approach Enron's former level, nor would he say what the size of the unit's capitalization will be. The company won't be afraid of taking some big risks, however. 
"The risk profile will be consistent with the risk profile of UBS Warburg," Walker said. 
Some traders for other companies have questioned whether the UBS/Enron group could be anywhere near as large as the old Enron. Without enormous capitalization, the unit won't be able to make huge directional calls on commodity prices or stand by those calls for awhile even when the market moves in the opposite direction, as Enron did. Without huge deal flow, some traders have said, UBS/Enron won't have the market information that helped Enron traders make the right directional calls most of the time. 
But employees of Enron and UBS disagreed Thursday. 
"They haven't given us specifics, and I'm sure it won't be like 'the Big E' - that was an extreme situation," one trader moving to UBS said. "But they recognize the need for a certain amount of latitude in order to make money in this business. Will there be a severe change to risk limits? I don't think so." 
A UBS employee agreed. 
"That's what we do for a living: We manage risk and sometimes make big bets, too," the employee said. "Don't think that we don't have any tolerance for that." 
UBS has no intention of buying any of Enron's current trading positions, which are in the process of being liquidated following Enron's bankruptcy filing Dec. 2. Nor does UBS have any intention of acquiring Enron's retail unit, Enron Energy Services, which worked closely with the wholesale traders. 
"We plan on building up our own portfolio," Walker said.

USA: Jesse Jackson to meet, pray with Enron's Lay.

01/24/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

HOUSTON, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Civil rights activist Rev. Jesse Jackson and former Enron Corp. chief executive Ken Lay were set to talk on Thursday night in a meeting at Enron headquarters that was likely to include a prayer session, a Jackson spokesman said. 
The hastily arranged session will be part of a two-day Jackson visit to Houston to drum up support for thousands of laid-off Enron employees who lost their savings in the energy trader's financial collapse, spokesman Mike Levine said.
"(Jackson) wanted to meet one-on-one with Lay just to let him know he's not here to come after him. He's just here to raise support for the employees," Levine said. 
"I'm sure they'll do some praying," he said. 
The besieged Lay, who is the son of a Baptist preacher, resigned in disgrace as Enron's chairman and chief executive officer on Wednesday, saying he could not reorganize the bankrupt company and fight its mounting legal battles at the same time. 
He remains on Enron's board of directors, but is scheduled to testify before Congress next month and faces numerous civil lawsuits and a criminal investigation by the U.S. Justice Department. 
Enron was the nation's top energy trading company until Dec. 2 when a ruinous financial scandal forced it into Chapter 11 bankruptcy. 
Jackson's visit comes a day after fellow activist Al Sharpton appeared on the steps of Enron headquarters to urge federal help for Enron employees and investors. 
An Enron spokesman was not immediately available for comment.

The Collected Letters of Enron's Employees: Michael Lewis
2002-01-24 14:33 (New York)

     (Commentary. Michael Lewis, whose books include ``Next: The Future Just Happened'' and ``Liar's Poker,'' is a columnist for Bloomberg News. The opinions expressed are his own.)

     Berkeley, California, Jan. 24 (Bloomberg) -- One of the high points of my day is reading the mail I receive from current and former Enron Corp. employees.
     If you are in the middle of a big media story and have some feel for its nuances, the coverage of that story always seems ridiculously inadequate. A lot of Enron's employees seem to feel the press doesn't fully understand what has happened to them.
     At any rate, a number of Old Enronians have felt compelled to call or write to me. Thanks to them I know that the now notorious Raptor partnership, into which Enron's top executives stuffed many bad investments, got its name because raptors ate garbage.
     Thanks to them I understand that the documents Arthur Andersen shredded were probably butt-covering memos from junior accountants to their bosses that spelled out the tacit understanding between the junior accountants and Enron that enabled Arthur Andersen to turn a blind eye to Enron's deceits.
     Thanks to them I know that Jeffrey Skilling was widely regarded as the shrewdest of the top executives and, by resigning for ``personal reasons,'' signaled to everyone else that Enron was doomed.
     But these letters from Enron's employees -- especially the ones from people still working at Enron -- are frustrating, because they usually come with a request that I avoid contacting them for further discussion. They don't want to be famous, just understood.

Unanswered Questions

     With no one on the inside to quiz, I still don't understand the story as it demands to be understood. Big questions remain about Enron, including:
     1) Why did Enron make so many really stupid investments?
     At the heart of the company's problems were a lot of inexplicable purchases of Indian power plants and Brazilian pipelines and so on. As one especially acute Enron correspondent put it, ``it really takes a ton of people to flush billions down the toilet. Popular wisdom would have us believe that it was just a few bad apples at the top (but) at the very least hundreds of employees knew about a couple of bad deals they worked on. Why weren't they wondering who was making all the money?''
     Enron's investment decisions were so colossally inept as to suggest an ulterior motive. But the best explanation I've received -- that Enron bought power plants in far-flung places to gain access to information about supply and demand in those markets that it could use in trading -- still rings hollow.

Fastow Mystery

     2) Why didn't Enron's former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, sell his Enron stock on the way down? Kenneth Lay and Skilling and other top executives clearly knew that they had to
get out while the getting was good and sold millions of dollars of Enron shares.
     Lay was more or less hand-selling his private holdings to his employees. But Fastow, who knew as much about the rot as anyone, held on when he must have known the stock was likely to collapse. Why? Even as he functioned as Enron's CFO was he grooming himself for the courtroom? Is that why he was so quick to hire crack trial lawyer David Boies?
     3) Why isn't it considered strange that Enron lent millions of dollars to its already rich chairman? Lay's lawyer has claimed that Lay sold some of his Enron stock simply to repay personal loans the company made to him. But why was the company lending him money in the first place?

This Is Morality?

     4) Why was Sherron Watkins, the author of the now famous letter to Lay, reprinted last week in the New York Times, regarded within Enron as a deeply moral person?
     Her letter has been waved about in the media as a weapon against Lay, as evidence that the boss ignored warnings from below, and that there was at least one good woman inside Enron who was deeply, deeply disturbed by the bad behavior.
     But Watkins' letter was not a work of moral philosophy. Her chief concern was not that Enron was breaking the law and cheating its investors, but that people outside Enron might find out that Enron was breaking the law and cheating investors -- and that, as she put it, ``my eight years of Enron work history will be worth nothing on my resume.''
     5) Why do people continue to work for companies even after they've concluded the people who run them are dishonest?
     Watkins' letter quotes a fellow employee saying ``I know it would be devastating to all of us, but I wish we would get caught. We're such a crooked company.'' Many of Enron's employees now claim to have been equally cynical about their enterprise.
     None of the many I've heard from has risen to the defense of Lay, Skilling, Fastow, et al. But all of these people seem to believe that their cynicism absolves them from any personal responsibility. Many of them apparently see themselves as innocent victims. Were they?

Enron delinquent in state tax payments

SACRAMENTO (AP) - California tax officials say the embattled Enron Corp. is more than a year late in paying a $493,000 tax bill. 
The bankrupt energy giant is facing investigations by congressional committees and the Securities and Exchange Commission. California Attorney General Bill Lockyer has subpoenaed the company regarding his investigation into last year's price spikes in the wholesale energy market.
And a California legislative committee investigating possible price manipulation has served additional subpoenas on Enron officials about possible destruction of documents. 
The California Franchise Tax Board said Enron's corporate tax payment was due March 15 of last year. 
The state will send a notice to Enron later this spring if it doesn't receive its money, said Pat Hill, a spokesman for the Franchise Tax Board, which collects individual and business taxes. 
"Whatever taxes you owe, you have to pay by the deadline, which in Enron's case was March 15. The return isn't due until October," Hill said. He didn't know if the company had filed a return by the deadline. 
Enron's bill is accruing 7 percent interest while it goes unpaid, he said. 
The state may have to file a claim in the company's bankruptcy hearing to get paid. 
"We'll be in the same line as all those families of employees the company owes," said Steve Maviglio, spokesman for the governor. 
The taxes are owed for earnings in California in 2000. Corporate taxes are typically not public information, but the tax board does release the amount of money companies owe when they are delinquent. 
Every year, about 600,000 California residents and 22,000 corporations get a letter from the tax board because they haven't paid, Hill said. The board usually gives companies as long as 15 months after the due date before it sends the letter. 
If companies refuse to pay taxes, the board can revoke their corporation status, effectively ending their ability to do business in the state. 
"Enron has other more pressing issues, I think," Hill said. 
Enron's bill is a small fraction of the state's annual tax collection, about $40 billion.

Andersen employees paid overtime to shred Enron documents - internal memo

01/24/2002
AFX News
(c) 2002 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

WASHINGTON (AFX) - Employees working for Andersen LLP were paid overtime to shred documents related to Enron Corp, according to an internal Andersen memo released by the House of Representatives' Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. 
"We do expect that people will be able to do this on an overtime basis, if necessary, for the remainder of this week, or for however long it takes for each of you to be comfortable" that the document retention and destruction guidelines are being met, the Oct 24 e-mail message said.
On Nov 10, a new policy instructing Andersen employees to stop shredding documents was implemented, but the prior policy allowed for destruction of certain documents. 
The memo was released following a hearing where Andersen executives were questioned by committee members about the company's role in the growing Enron scandal.

USA: Judge grants early Andersen depositions in Enron suit.
By C. Bryson Hull

01/24/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

HOUSTON, Jan 24 (Reuters) - A federal judge on Thursday ordered six key Andersen employees to give early depositions about the shredding of Enron-related documents, handing an initial victory to shareholders suing the auditor and the failed energy giant's top insiders. 
U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon granted in full a motion for discovery in the massive suit that requires the preservation of all Enron-related records held by Andersen, the accounting firm that Enron Corp. fired last week. The motion was requested by all but one plaintiff in the suit.
Allegations of systematic document shredding at Andersen and Enron rapidly mobilized plaintiffs' attorneys, who pushed for the early discovery and depositions to preserve as much evidence as possible in what is certain to be a lengthy lawsuit with billions of dollars at stake. 
The six employees include Andersen's fired top partner on the Enron account, David Duncan, who on Thursday asserted his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination during a hearing before the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. 
Andersen fired him on Jan. 15 for ordering the destruction of Enron documents after a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission probe was launched in October. 
Also giving depositions will be four other Andersen partners in Houston who were relieved of their management responsibilities and a lawyer who sent an e-mail explaining Andersen's document-destruction policy to the auditor's Houston office. 
Harmon's order waives a provision of U.S. securities law that delays depositions until a judge determines whether a suit is frivolous. The provision is intended to prevent legal interviews from being improperly used to gather business information. 
The depositions cannot be taken until 20 days from now, and are restricted to eight hours and limited to the topic of document and data destruction or storage. 
The order allows Andersen's outside lawyers to guard the documents at their own sites and permits the plaintiffs to inspect those sites immediately. Andersen must within 20 days categorize and report the documents they have found or recovered, and explain the steps it took to recover deleted documents, the order says. 
One lawyer said the plaintiffs were delighted with the judge's ruling. 
Andersen, joined by lawyers who are suing them on behalf of the New York City and state of Florida pension funds, had opposed only the early depositions. 
"We had asked for 95 percent of this, and even had suggested a lot of it," Andersen attorney Rusty Hardin said. "We'll make those people available. We just thought it would be more convenient for them to give the depositions a few months from now, when they were more familiar with the documents." 
Hardin said he only had control over the appearances of the five current Andersen employees, who all have their own attorneys. 
Since Duncan has been fired, his own attorney will handle the depositions, Hardin said. A Duncan representative had no immediate comment, having just learned of the order.

Arthur Andersen Ordered to Protect Enron Documents
2002-01-24 13:21 (New York)

     Houston, Jan. 24 (Bloomberg) -- Arthur Andersen LLP officials must answer questions about what Enron Corp. auditing records have been destroyed and protect remaining documents, a federal judge ruled.
     U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon gave Andersen officials 20 days to investigate the destruction of Enron documents and report to the court how many can be reconstructed.
     Enron Corp. shareholders sought the order after officials of Andersen acknowledged earlier this month that they shredded or deleted ``a significant number'' of Enron documents. The Justice Department, Securities and Exchange Commission, congressional committees and shareholders' lawyers want the documents to help determine how Enron collapsed.
      ``I expect we'll learn through this questioning that the document destruction was a deliberate, calculated effort to protect Andersen from liability,'' said William Lerach, a San Diego-based lawyer representing Enron investors in lawsuits over the energy trader's collapse.
``We've got full protection for the documents now.''
     Officials of Chicago-based Andersen weren't immediately available for comment on the ruling. Shares of Houston-based Enron, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December, rose 4 cents to 38 cents in mid afternoon trading.
     Lawyers for Enron investors, bondholders and former employees began pushing for a court order to safeguard Enron-related records after reports surfaced that document-shredding continued following internal orders to halt it.
     A fired Enron project manager said in court filings that documents were being destroyed at Enron's Houston headquarters as late as Jan. 14. Company officials sent out e-mails in November ordering workers to set aside any records that may be involved in Enron-related probes.
     Earlier this week, Enron officials said they found a trash can full of shredded documents on the 19th floor of the company's downtown Houston skyscraper. That led investors' lawyers to allege record destruction was continuing.

Questioning Slated

     Under Harmon's four-page order, Andersen officials must set aside documents, letters, e-mails and other records related to Enron audits. They also must try to reconstruct any destroyed documents or recreate deleted electronic files from backup tapes.
     Andersen also must make a group of employees available to be questioned by shareholders' lawyers on what documents were destroyed, when they were destroyed and who ordered their
destruction, under Harmon's order.
     The Andersen employees to be questioned include Thomas H. Bauer, Michael M. Lowther, Michael C. Odom and Stephen Goddard Jr., all partners in Andersen's Houston office.
      Goddard, the office's former managing partner, has been placed on administrative leave along with Bauer, Lowther and Odom following the shredding disclosures, according to Harmon's order.
     Nancy Temple, an Andersen in-house lawyer in Chicago, also has been ordered to submit to questioning by shareholders' lawyers. Temple answered questions about Enron's collapse and the document destruction on Capitol Hill today.
     David B. Duncan, the fired former lead partner in charge of Andersen's Enron group, also must submit to questions by plaintiffs' lawyers about the document destruction, Harmon ruled.

Fifth Amendment

     Andersen lawyers told the judge yesterday that they can't force Duncan to show up for the questioning because he's no longer an employee.
     Duncan, who invoked the Fifth Amendment to avoid a congressional committee's questions today, is likely to do the same thing at any deposition in the shareholder suits, said Rusty Hardin, a Houston lawyer representing the U.S.'s fifth-largest accounting firm.
     Investors' lawyers also can inspect the four secure sites that Andersen's lawyers are using to store documents and computers containing Enron-related material, the judge said.
     Finally, she ordered the accounting firm to hand out a copy of the order to all its partners.
     Hardin said plaintiffs' lawyers unfairly fanned public outrage about the shredding.
     ``There needs to be some modicum of decency in the way this company is treated,'' Hardin said.

Andersen Workers Told to Work Overtime on Shredding, Rep. Says
2002-01-24 15:00 (New York)

     Washington, Jan. 24 (Bloomberg) -- Arthur Andersen LLP employees were ordered to work overtime to destroy documents related to Enron Corp., U.S. Representative James Greenwood said, citing an Andersen memo.
     Greenwood, a Pennsylvania Republican, made the comments at an impromptu press conference after congressional hearings into the Enron case.
     A federal judge ruled today that Andersen officials must answer questions about what Enron auditing records have been destroyed and must protect remaining documents.

Wide Effort Seen in Shredding Data on Enron's Audits
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.
January 24, 2002
WASHINGTON, Jan. 24 - Scores of people who worked at Arthur Andersen's Houston office were involved in the destruction of documents related to the Enron Corporation according to the chairman of one of the Congressional subcommittees that began hearings today on Enron's collapse. 
The chairman, Representative James C. Greenwood, Republican of Pennsylvania, head of the House Energy and Commerce oversight subcommittee, said investigators for the subcommittee had determined that document shredding was widespread and that up to 80 people had received orders to destroy papers. He said it called into question Andersen's attempts to blame rogue employees for the episode.
The hearings today are Congress's first public exploration into the Enron collapse, the largest corporate Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in American history. 
Enron's chairman and chief executive, Kenneth L. Lay, announced his resignation late Wednesday, saying the many investigations into the company's collapse would require too much of his attention.
Last week, Andersen, one of the Big Five accounting firms, fired the lead partner on the Enron account, David B. Duncan, saying he orchestrated widespread document destruction shortly after learning of a government investigation into Enron's finances.
But Mr. Greenwood expressed skepticism on Wednesday about that account. "Do you believe that 80 Andersen employees were directed by Mr. Duncan to violate an express provision of policy by Andersen in the face of yet another investigation, and none of them picked up the phone and called their superiors and said, `This doesn't seem right'?" he asked. "The question we need to get to is, Were there instructions from above."
Other people close to the investigation said they doubted that the number of Andersen employees was as high as Mr. Greenwood's estimate, but they said it was a much larger group than the company had suggested. Mr. Duncan appeared today under subpoena at the energy and commerce subcommittee hearing, but as expected, he invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. His lawyer, Robert Giuffra, told the committee in a letter on Wednesday, that Mr. Duncan would "rely on his Constitutional right not to testify" unless he is given immunity.
Congressional investigators made public on Wednesday a memo Mr. Duncan wrote last October saying he expressed concerns about the way in which Enron was about to disclose huge losses from controversial dealings that investigators believed played a significant role in the company's collapse. The disclosure, he said, was misleading to investors and possibly illegal.
On Oct. 16, Enron disclosed that it lost $618 million during the third quarter and that it would have to reduce its net worth by $1.2 billion, partly because of dealings with investment partnerships that had been headed by Andrew S. Fastow, who was then the company's chief financial officer. At the time, the company said the losses were the result of one-time losses, leaving the impression that the company could weather the bad quarterly results.
But two days earlier, Mr. Duncan warned the company's chief accounting officer, Rick Causey, that the way the company planned to disclose the information might be "misconstrued or misunderstood by investors," according to a memo Mr. Duncan wrote to his files on Oct. 15 that was made available to Congressional investigators. However, the press release Enron issued the next day was "essentially the original presentation," Mr. Duncan wrote.
Mr. Duncan said in his memo that he had warned Mr. Causey that the Securities and Exchange Commission initiates enforcement actions against companies that issue financial information that is "materially misleading." He said the company should rewrite its earnings report and bring in lawyers to assure that its statements were not false.
One week later, officials in Andersen's Houston office began to shred Enron-related documents on a massive scale, even though Enron had just disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission had begun an investigation into its finances. Andersen fired Mr. Duncan last week, saying he had ordered the destruction of the Enron papers.
An Andersen spokesman, Charlie Leonard, characterized Mr. Duncan's memo as routine and said it reflected internal debates about accounting issues that occur between auditors and corporate executives. He added: "It looks like that with the exception of some inappropriate phrasing, Mr. Duncan was doing what he was supposed to."
An Andersen official on Wednesday evening repeated the firm's assertion that Mr. Duncan's actions, aided by other partners in the Houston office who were demoted or placed on leave last week, had not been sanctioned. 
"The one glaring fact here is that David Duncan, with full knowledge of an S.E.C. investigation, initiated a massive document destruction campaign," official said.
The hearings that began today, which will eventually involve 10 different committees, could lead to changes in pension, tax, securities and accounting laws, though many experts are skeptical how far lawmakers will go. Past efforts to tighten laws in these areas, particularly auditing standards, have been beaten back by industry lobbying.
The fall of Enron has touched off a scramble in the capital to assign blame and avoid the taint of the company's prodigious political donations.
Some Democrats in Congress see the Enron case as a windfall that could dent President Bush's lofty public approval ratings. But many Democrats are also vulnerable because the company spread its largess so widely and the accounting and regulatory practices that led to Enron's collapse took place under Democratic and Republican administrations.
In the House, the Energy and Commerce subcommittee cross-examined senior Arthur Andersen officials about why the firm destroyed Enron documents after learning about an S.E.C. investigation into the company's finances.
Also, the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee was examining whether government policies failed and what new legislation is needed. The first witness was Arthur Levitt, the former S.E.C. chairman whose efforts to tighten auditing standards two years ago were derailed by opposition from Congress. 
Separately, Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, formally asked the Justice Department to appoint a special counsel to investigate Enron, arguing the case "represents one of the largest corporate frauds in the nation's history" and citing the large campaign donations Enron has provided to President Bush over the years and the large number of senior administration officials who worked for or invested in the company.
A Justice Department official said that he had not seen Mr. Conyers's letter and that officials were still proceeding with their criminal investigation.
The Senate Finance Committee asked Enron on Wednesday to turn over tax returns for the past 16 years, in a letter sent by the committee chairman, Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, and the ranking Republican, Charles E. Grassley of Iowa. Their request follows the disclosure in The New York Times last week that Enron used almost 900 subsidiaries in tax-haven countries and other techniques to pay no income taxes in four of the last five years.
In an interview, Mr. Greenwood said Mr. Duncan had sought immunity for his testimony but had been rebuffed. Justice Department officials are worried that grants of immunity made by Congress might hamper their criminal investigation of Enron and Andersen.
Investigators had asked Andersen's chief executive, Joseph F. Berardino, to appear, but Mr. Berardino said he would be willing to attend on a later date. Instead, Dorsey Baskin, a senior technical expert at Andersen, testified, as did Nancy Temple, an in-house lawyer for Andersen in Chicago.
While the House subcommittee hearing is focusing on Andersen's document destruction, attention will turn later to the reasons for Enron's flawed accounting. In Mr. Duncan's memo, the auditor says Andersen had expressed serious reservations about Enron's accounting, particularly the company's description of large losses as "nonrecurring," or one-time, charges.
Andersen had advised Enron that its use of the term "could potentially be misunderstood by investors," Mr. Duncan's memo states. "We pointed out that such items are, more often than not, included in normal operating earnings in" financial statements that are put together using generally accepted accounting practices.
The next day - the same day Enron disclosed the earnings press release that Mr. Duncan objected to - Ms. Temple, who had been involved in discussing the matter with Mr. Duncan, sent an e-mail message to Mr. Duncan and others at the firm suggesting that language be deleted from the memo "that might suggest we have concluded the release is misleading."
A copy of the message showed that Ms. Temple appeared to be worried about potential litigation on Enron's finances and she sought to remove her name from the list of people who received the document: "If my name is mentioned it increases the chances that I might be a witness, which I prefer to avoid."
Ms. Temple's lawyer did not return a telephone call for comment. Mr. Leonard, the Andersen spokesman, said Ms. Temple was simply worried about waiving attorney-client privilege. Her reference to not concluding that the press release is misleading reflects her understanding that auditors "don't have a right or responsibility to pass judgment on press releases," only formal financial statements, he added.
Mr. Duncan, 42, has told investigators that he was only destroying documents in keeping with an Oct. 12 e-mail message from Ms. Temple that emphasized that they follow a policy requiring some documents be destroyed. Mr. Duncan has told investigators he stopped shredding after Ms. Temple ordered it halted Nov. 9.
While Andersen officials have sought to blame Mr. Duncan and other employees in Houston office for the destruction of the documents, investigators are skeptical and want to probe why the firm waited more than two weeks after Enron disclosed the S.E.C. investigation to order the shredding stopped.
Mr. Greenwood said that in interviews with committee investigators, Mr. Duncan stated that on at least two occasions before Oct. 12, Ms. Temple asked him, "How are you on compliance with the document-retention on Enron?" 
"Did she really mean that," Mr. Greenwood asked, "or did she mean, `How are you doing on getting rid of the documents?"'

Enron's chief auditor refuses to testify
Lawmakers describe widespread destruction of Enron documents at Andersen
January 24, 2002 Posted: 1:17 PM EST (1817 GMT)
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The former Andersen LLP auditor who handled Enron's books refused to testify at Thursday's opening hearing of a congressional panel investigating the shredding of documents related to the Enron collapse. 
Top auditor David Duncan, since fired by Anderson -- which did Enron's accounts -- invoked his Fifth Amendment rights against self incrimination and declined to speak further. 
Lawmakers on the investigative subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee described on Thursday what they called widespread and systematic effort to shred Enron-related documents at the company's accounting firm and charged that the practice, which was later suspended, has impeded investigations and could lead to criminal charges. 
Duncan, who was the first to be called to testify, had earlier said through his lawyer that he would refuse to testify before the congressional panel unless he was granted immunity. Lawmakers left open the possibility that he will return before the committee at a later date. 
"Mr. Duncan, Enron robbed a bank. Arthur Andersen provided the getaway car and they say you were at the wheel," Rep. James Greenwood, R-Pennsylvania, the subcommittee chairman, told Duncan shortly after he was sworn in to testify. 
But when Greenwood asked whether he ordered the destruction of Enron documents in an attempt to subvert investigators, Duncan declined to answer. 
"Mr. Chairman, I would like to answer the committee's questions but on the advice of my counsel I respectfully decline to answer the question based on the protection afforded to me under the Constitution of the United States," Duncan said, repeating it when asked to clarify. 
Greenwood dismissed him from the hearing room, but said Duncan might return to testify at a later date. 
Other Andersen executives were also scheduled to testify at the hearing on Enron, the energy giant that filed the biggest bankruptcy case in U.S. history 
Panel members were highly critical of Andersen executives. 
"It is clear that scores of professionals and support staff were involved in the shredding of paper and deletion of computer files relating to the Enron audit. Yet to date, committee investigators have been unable to locate or learn about a single Andersen employee who raised any concerns or objections about destroying Enron-related documents even after the [Securities and Exchange Commission] inquiry became public," Greenwood said. 
Rep. John Dingell, D-Michigan, the ranking member on the panel, said the accounting firm's shredding of documents "was either criminally stupid or stupidly criminal, or both." 
Lawmakers vowed to get to the bottom of Enron's bankruptcy. 
"Let me make it clear, this committee will cut no one any slack as we go forward," said Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-Louisiana, the chairman of the full Energy and Commerce Committee. "If there has been corporate wrongdoing, we'll unroot it. If there's personal or corporate attempts to hide the facts, we'll uncover them and people will answer for them." 
Tauzin said before the hearing that it is likely criminal charges will be filed because of indications that both Enron and Anderson shredded financial documents after Enron filed for bankruptcy and as it faced numerous investigations and lawsuits. 
"I would not be surprised if some criminal indictments come out of this," Tauzin told CNN in an interview before the hearing started. 
One congressional aide said the shredding at Andersen was more widespread than the company has acknowledged, involving as many as 80 employees. 
The hearing came a day after Kenneth Lay resigned from his role as chairman and chief executive of the collapsed energy giant. 
"I want to see Enron survive, and for that to happen, we need someone at the helm who can focus 100 percent of his efforts on reorganizing the company and preserving value for our creditors and hard-working employees," Lay said in a written statement. 
"Unfortunately, with the multiple inquiries and investigations that currently require much of my time, it is becoming increasingly difficult to concentrate fully on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders." 
Lay will remain on Enron's board, but he will step down as the company's leadership post, the company announced. The move came after talks with the creditor's committee at Enron, Lay said. 
Enron filed for bankruptcy in December. Before its sudden collapse, it was ranked the seventh-largest U.S. company in terms of revenue. 
In October, Enron was forced to disclose that it had concealed more than $500 million in debt from related partnerships led by company executives. Its stock, which once traded at nearly $90 a share, sank to less than $1 a share. 
The company's collapse has sparked a Justice Department probe and numerous congressional investigations. The company and its executives have been the single biggest group of contributors to President Bush and other Republican campaigns, and they have donated to many Democratic lawmakers as well. 
Enron's executives and directors sold about $1.3 billion worth of stock in the last three years, with Lay making $119 million, according to a Thomson Financial study that CNN commissioned. One particularly controversial aspect of the company's collapse is that employees were barred from selling stock held in their 401 (k) plans even as executives were unloading their plummeting shares. The prohibition decimated the retirement accounts of many employees. 
The Andersen accounting firm admitted its employees shredded documents relating to Enron audits in the days after the company's problems became public. 
Andersen CEO Joseph Berardino conceded Sunday that his company made errors but said that Enron's demise ultimately was the result of a failed business model, not shady accounting. 
A former Enron executive said Monday that employees at the company's headquarters in Houston, Texas, were shredding documents as late as January 14 in spite of the company's bankruptcy filing that costs thousands of investors and employees their life savings. Security guards were posted in the building Wednesday to prevent further shredding.

The discussion Thursday between fired Enron auditor David Duncan and Rep. Jim Greenwood, R-Pa., chairman of a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee investigating the Enron collapse: 
GREENWOOD: Good morning, Mr. Duncan.
Mr. Duncan is here with us today under subpoena. To date, Mr. Duncan has cooperated with this committee in our search for the facts by submitting to an interview last week with our committee investigator that lasted more than four hours. 
Yet we received a letter from his counsel yesterday stating that Mr. Duncan authorized his counsel to advise the committee that he will, quote, rely on his constitutional right not to testify, close quote. 
I believe that this privilege should be personally exercised by, before the members, and that's why we have requested Mr. Duncan's appearance here today and request that he reconsider. 
Mr. Duncan, you're aware that the committee is holding an investigative hearing and that in doing so we have the practice of taking testimony under oath. Do you have objection to testifying under oath? 
DUNCAN: No sir. 
GREENWOOD: Thank you. The chair also advises you that under the rules of the House and the rules of the committee, you are entitled to be advised by counsel. Do you desire to be advised by counsel during your testimony today? 
DUNCAN: Yes sir. 
GREENWOOD: In that case, would you please rise and raise your right hand, and I will swear you in. Mr. Duncan, do you swear that you will tell, the testimony you will give this committee is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth? 
DUNCAN: Yes, Mr. Chairman. 
GREENWOOD: Thank you, Mr. Duncan. You are now under oath and you may give a 5-minute summary of your written testimony if you choose to. 
DUNCAN: I have no summary, sir. 
GREENWOOD: OK. The chair will recognize himself for questioning. Mr. Duncan, Enron robbed the bank. Arthur Anderson provided the getaway car, and they say you were at the wheel. 
I have a specific question for you, Mr. Duncan. You were fired by Anderson last week for orchestrating an expedited effort among the Anderson-Enron engagement team to destroy thousands of paper documents and electronic files relating to the Enron matter after learning of an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission into Enron's complex financial transactions. Did you give an order to destroy documents in an attempt to subvert governmental investigations into Enron's financial collapse, and if so, did you do so at the direction or suggestion of anyone at Anderson or at Enron? 
DUNCAN: Mr. Chairman, I would like to answer the committee's questions, but on the advice of my counsel I respectfully decline to answer the question based on the protection afforded me under the Constitution of the United States. 
GREENWOOD: Let me be clear, Mr. Duncan. Are you refusing to answer the question on the basis of the protections afforded to you under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution? 
DUNCAN: Again, on the advice of my counsel, respectfully I respectfully decline to answer the question based on the protection afforded me under the United States Constitution. 
GREENWOOD: Will you invoke your Fifth Amendment rights in response to all of our questions here today? 
DUNCAN: Respectfully that will be my response to all of your questions. 
GREENWOOD: I am disappointed to hear that, but it is therefore the chair's intention to dismiss the witness. Mr. Duncan, we thank you for your attendance today and your respect for this committee's process. You are dismissed.

USA: Lawyers see settlement of massive Andersen suits.
By Gail Appleson, Law Correspondent

01/24/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

NEW YORK, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Andersen, which handled Enron Corp.'s audits, will have to pay what could be hundreds of millions of dollars to settle massive civil litigation if it hopes to survive the scandal over the energy trader's collapse, legal experts say. 
"This is one that will never get to trial," said Robert McTamaney, partner at the New York law firm of Carter, Ledyard & Milburn.
Some experts said Andersen will have to move quickly to reach a deal that will limit civil liabilities and restore confidence in the firm. But they said it will take an enormous sum to do so, raising questions as to just how much Andersen and its insurers can handle. 
While the insurance amount is confidential, insurance sources have told Reuters they think Andersen has a maximum of $500 million in professional liability coverage in the commercial market plus funds held in several self-owned Bermuda insurance entities. 
Even if Andersen can withstand a huge settlement and other costs growing out of potential legal woes, lawyers said it faces an even tougher issue. 
"It's not a question of money, but of the credibility of the firm," said Stephen Younger, a partner at New York's Patterson, Belknap, Webb & Tyler, adding that Andersen's future will be affected by the departures of clients and its own employees. 
Dozens of class-action suits filed by Enron employee benefit plans and outside investors who bought artificially inflated Enron stock are piling up against Andersen mostly in Houston federal court. 
The Chicago-based Andersen has come under fire for approving accounting practices that enabled Enron to use hundreds of partnerships to hide debt or generate questionable profits. 
RACKETEERING LAWS 
As recently as Wednesday a suit was filed by Enron employees alleging Andersen and Enron officials broke federal racketeering laws. The suit alleges the defendants conspired to hide Enron's true financial condition by withholding critical information, causing employees to lose more than $1.3 billion from their retirement funds. 
Lawyers expect the cases will be certified as class actions and consolidated in one court. 
The accounting firm's exposure has grown significantly because Enron's Dec. 2 bankruptcy filing has stayed all litigation against the fallen energy company. 
"Clearly Arthur Andersen is a nice deep pocket," said Marc Galanter, University of Wisconsin law professor, who pointed out that class-action suits rarely go to trial. 
Defendants in class-action litigation often choose to settle cases for a lump sum even if they feel they have done nothing wrong. Such pacts can end the uncertainty over the length and cost of litigation. Therefore, settlements are often seen as less risky and cheaper than fighting individual cases particularly if there are many plaintiffs. 
Although plaintiffs can opt out of a settlement, the majority of them usually participate. 
As the civil cases over Enron's accounting measures are multiplying, Congress, the Justice Department, and state and federal regulators are investigating whether Andersen acted improperly. 
On Thursday, for example, a House subcommittee held a hearing on Andersen's shredding of documents relating to Enron. 
While it is unclear whether these probes will result in charges or other actions against Andersen, the pending civil cases are an existing threat. 
SIX MONTHS? THREE YEARS? 
"The million dollar question is when will they be settled," said Younger. 
Expert's predictions ranged from six months to three years. Some doubted that a judge or jury would ever even have the chance to decide the key allegations of the suits. 
"The train wreck has already happened and this is not about whether the conductor did or didn't switch tracks," said David White, a principal of Washington D.C.-based Mission Strategies, a public affairs consulting firm that specializes in crisis communication and litigation matters. 
"Now it's a matter of picking up the pieces," he said, adding that he thought the settlement would be reached in a matter of months, not years. 
Younger said he would expect it would take at least six months for the different parties to begin building their cases. He said other matters will probably affect the timing including how long it takes to determine the size of the class and whether civil litigation will be stayed by proceedings in Enron's bankruptcy or by possible criminal cases. 
However, he thought Andersen's management would act "sooner rather than later because if they don't, the firm won't survive." 
McTamaney thought it would take two to three years to settle the civil cases, but that Andersen would remain a viable company. 
"I think it's highly unlikely that Arthur Andersen will end up in bankruptcy," he said, adding that he felt the firm's accountants are excellent professionals. 
"I think the claims against them reflect the difficulties inherent in auditing a massively complex financial enterprise which itself seemed determined to possibly misdirect financial attention to arguably more attractive aspects of its business and away from the problem areas," he said.

State Board Confirms Investigation into Arthur Andersen LLP/Enron Audit

01/24/2002
PR Newswire
(Copyright (c) 2002, PR Newswire)

AUSTIN, Texas, Jan. 24 /PRNewswire/ -- Attorneys for Arthur Andersen LLP have given the Texas State Board of Public Accountancy permission to disclose that in November 2001 the Board opened an official investigation into Andersen's audit of Enron. 
The Texas Board is prohibited by law from disclosing any specific details of this matter. The Public Accountancy Act, the Board's enabling statute, expressly states that information gathered or received regarding a disciplinary action against a license holder is confidential and not subject to public disclosure until: 
* the Board receives the respondent's written permission to disclose 
that an investigation is underway; 
* the Board has issued a final order in a disciplinary action resulting 
from an informal proceeding; or 
* the Board has held a formal public hearing in the matter.
The Texas Board is statutorily mandated to protect the public by ensuring that persons issued CPA certificates possess the necessary education, skills, and capabilities and that they perform competently when serving the public. 
Each state board of public accountancy issues its own CPA certificate and license, and therefore is the only entity that can carry out disciplinary actions involving the forfeiture of a certificate or license. Individual state boards of accountancy regulate not only CPAs who provide services to SEC registrants, but also those who work with smaller companies. 
The Texas Board's efforts include ensuring that appropriate action is taken and that due process is carried out in all enforcement cases. The staff annually investigates and prosecutes approximately 300 alleged violations of the rules of professional conduct and the statute. 
The Texas Board's disciplinary process begins with a complaint, filed either by a member of the public, another government entity, or on the Board's own initiative. A staff investigation follows, sometimes with the assistance of an outside technical consultant. 
The Texas Board designates certain investigations as "major cases." These involve CPA firms implicated in the audits of failed or troubled savings and loan organizations, financial institutions, insurance companies, and other cases of a major nature. Such cases are more complex and require substantial resources for pre-hearing preparations and prosecution. The Texas Board engages the Texas Attorney General's office to assist in the prosecutorial process. 
"I am proud of the Board's long record of vigorously investigating all complaints against CPAs," said K. Michael Conway, CPA from Midland and the Texas Board's presiding officer. "The Board administers a wide range of sanctions against individual CPAs and/or CPA firms that are found to have violated the Public Accountancy Act or Board rules. The publishing of sanctions against CPAs and/or CPA firms is an integral part of protecting the public."

Fed's Greenspan Comments on `Egregious' Accounting at Enron
2002-01-24 12:40 (New York)

     Washington, Jan. 24 (Bloomberg) -- The following are comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on accounting practices at Enron Corp. Greenspan's remarks came during the question-and-answer part of testimony to the Senate Budget Committee.
     ``I think that the extraordinary response to Enron is something I think is very helpful and indeed an indication that the people in this society have required that we maintain a very high standard of trustworthiness in our business operations,'' Greenspan said.
     ``If everybody did what is alleged in the Enron accounting system, our system could not work,'' he said. ``That is, if you have a system, a market system, it works off information. If you don't have a way to evaluate a particular asset you cannot price it and if you cannot price it you cannot get the appropriate allocation of capital in a market society.''
     As to Enron's accounting practices, Greenspan said: ``I think that was an egregious act. I tried as hard as I could to find an economic reason why those affiliates were constructed the way they were. The simplest explanation was the obvious explanation: that they did not want to indicate what their true earnings position was.''
     Greenspan said he would be concerned about Enron's practices harming the economy ``if there wasn't a reaction to it.''
     ``But the reaction, I think, is going to create a really major rethinking by a lot of people about whether there is a spin game going on with respect to the information coming out of business into the investment community,'' he said.
     While ``there's been an element of that'' in the past, ``I think there's going to be a good deal less of that. The old issue of competing for reputation is going to re-emerge. And I think you're going to find at some point that there are going to be people out there who are going to say `our accounts you can rely on' and that probably will increase their price-earnings ratios.''

Greenspan Says Enron 'Abrogated' Good Will Of US Public

01/24/2002
Dow Jones Capital Markets Report
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on Thursday joined President George W. Bush in denouncing the business conduct of Enron Corp. (ENRNQ), accusing the company of abrogating the "good will" that it enjoyed from the public and its own employees. 
Testifying before the Senate Budget Committee, Greenspan said the public outrage over Enron's conduct before its collapse was justified. "I think it is a very good sign," he said. "I think it tells us that because the whole structure of American business is so fundamentally based on trust, any abrogation of that trust creates a real furor, which it should.
"There are other places in the world in which an episode like this would be shrugged off as normal business," Greenspan said. "This is not the case here. It essentially tells us that we are not an economy that takes an erosion of reputation as a minor question." 
Enron is the largest U.S. corporation in history to seek bankruptcy-court protection. It announced last November that it had overstated its earnings by $586 million in the past four years. Its stock lost nearly all its value, depleting the 401(k) retirement accounts of thousands of Enron employees and retirees. 
Bush said this week he was "outraged" that Enron had misled its employees and investors, and said the government should require corporations to disclose more financial information. Greenspan, for his part, said Enron's behavior has been properly condemned. 
"An abrogation of that good will, that clearly has happened - has been taken very seriously by the American public," he said.

USA: Derivatives at root of Enron collapse, expert says.
By Andrew Clark

01/24/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

WASHINGTON, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Enron Corp.'s extensive use of derivatives, not just its accounting practices, lie at the root of the fallen energy giant's slide into the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history, an expert in the complex financial instruments told Congress on Thursday. 
University of San Diego law professor Frank Partnoy said Enron had used profits from its derivatives trading operation - the full scale of which was little appreciated by investors - to mask losses in its more visible businesses even as some of its employees were fraudulently manipulating those profits.
"It will surprise many investors to learn that Enron was, at its core, a derivatives trading firm," he said in testimony delivered at a Senate Governmental Affairs Committee hearing. 
A former Wall Street derivatives trader and white-collar crime specialist, Partnoy has been researching Enron's business practices for a book he is writing about its collapse. Enron officials had no immediate comment on his allegations. 
"It made billions trading derivatives, but it lost billions on virtually everything else it did, including projects in fiber-optic bandwidth, retail gas and power, water systems and even technology stocks," he said. "Enron used its expertise in derivatives to hide these losses." 
Derivatives are complex financial contracts whose values are linked to underlying variables such as the prices of commodities, stocks or bonds. They are typically used by sophisticated investors to manage risk. 
Partnoy said Enron's use of derivatives both outside and inside the company could be directly linked to its collapse. 
On the outside, he said, they were used to create the company's web of off-balance sheet deals with complex financial partnerships known as special-purpose vehicles. After some of those deals went sour, Enron in October took a $1 billion charge against earnings and a $1.2 billion write-down in shareholder equity, triggering its nosedive into bankruptcy. 
"Specifically, Enron used derivatives and special purpose vehicles in three ways," Partnoy said. 
"First, it hid speculator losses it suffered on technology stocks," he said. "Second, it hid huge debts incurred to finance unprofitable new businesses, including retail energy service. Third, it inflated the value of other troubled businesses, including new ventures in fiber-optic bandwidth." 
MANIPULATION ALLEGED 
But Enron's derivatives problems ran far deeper than the outside special purpose vehicles, Partnoy said, adding he had also gathered information indicating widespread manipulation of the company's derivatives trading revenues. 
"In a nutshell, it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit and loss entries for the derivatives Enron traded," he said. "Simply put, Enron's reported earnings from derivatives seem to be more imagined than real." 
Enron reported more than $16 billion in gains from derivatives over the three years to 2000, Partnoy said. He said the alleged false entries "were systematic and occurred over several years, beginning as early as 1997." 
Partnoy said some Enron traders had misused so-called "prudency reserves," meant to reflect the inherent uncertainty about future profits from derivatives deals, as rainy-day funds to smooth out their profits and losses over time. 
Some had also apparently deliberately misvalued the forward rate curves used to determine the current value of their derivatives portfolios in order to hide losses, he said. 
"I cannot offer fact testimony as to any of these matters," Partnoy told the committee. "Nonetheless, I strongly believe the information I have gathered is credible. It is from many sources, including written information, e-mail correspondence and telephone interviews." 
At least eight congressional committees, as well as the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice, are probing Enron's fall from grace and Partnoy said the episode should raise major questions about the regulation of derivatives as well as capital markets in general. 
"The collapse of Enron makes it plain that the key gatekeeper institutions that support our system of market capitalism have failed," he said. "The institutions sharing the blame include auditors, law firms, banks, securities analysts, independent directors and credit rating agencies."

Campaign Finance Bill to Get a Vote, Thanks to Enron
2002-01-24 14:24 (New York)

     Washington, Jan. 24 (Bloomberg) -- Advocates of a campaign finance overhaul have obtained the 218 signatures they need to bring their legislation to a vote in the U.S. House, over the
objection of Republican leaders who oppose it.
     The bill's backers said multiple investigations into Enron Corp., which gave almost $6 million to federal candidates since 1989, helped win support from a majority of the 435 lawmakers.
     ``It's a classic reminder of how money buys access and undermines confidence in our democracy,'' said Representative Martin Meehan, a Massachusetts Democrat. ``If anything positive comes out of the Enron scandal, it will be passage of campaign finance reform.''
     The drive to gain signatures on a ``discharge petition'' to enable the debate began last year, after the Senate passed a bill to ban the unlimited and largely unregulated campaign donations known as ``soft money'' and the bill stalled in the House.
     The last four signatures were obtained today, as Enron's December bankruptcy was debated in committees all over Capitol Hill, according to the House Clerk's Office. Representatives
Corrine Brown of Florida, Richard Neal of Massachusetts, Thomas Petri of Wisconsin and Charles Bass of New Hampshire all signed. The first two are Democrats, the last two are Republicans.
     Bass and Petri said they signed after discussing the matter with House Speaker Dennis Hastert, an opponent of the bill.
     ``Unfortunately, we were unable to reach agreement,'' Bass said. ``Today I helped provide the necessary signatures to force a vote.''

Not Scheduled Yet

     Hastert told reporters this week that he anticipated the success of the petition drive. ``We're going to have a leadership discussion on it this weekend,'' he said.
     Representative Christopher Shays, the Republican sponsor from Connecticut, said he expects Hastert to schedule the legislation for floor debate without posing obstacles.
     The petition brings a campaign finance overhaul one step closer to passage, which would change the way U.S. elections are financed. Soft money is one of the few ways that corporations and labor unions can contribute in large amounts.
     Almost $452 million in soft money was given in the last election, including about $30 million from unions and more than $232 million from companies and their trade associations, according to FECInfo, which tracks campaign finance.

No Veto Likely

     The bill before the House is designed to gain approval in the Senate. An administration spokesman said that President George W. Bush is not looking to wield his veto pen.
     ``It depends on what it says, but the president has made it clear he can't be counted on to veto it,'' said White House spokesman Ari Fleischer. ``The president very much wants something
he can sign.''
     In addition to a soft money ban, the bill would limit political advertising close to election time.
     The legislation comes as both parties head toward November's elections, with Democrats controlling the Senate by a single seat out of 100 and Republicans running the House by 11 of the 435 seats.
     The 2000 elections set records for federal spending at about $2.9 billion. This year, both parties are clamoring for cash because fundraising fell off after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
The Republican National Committee, for example, raised $49.4 million in the first six months of 2001 and saw that shrink to $32.6 million in the last half of the year.
     Opponents can still try to change the bill on the House floor with provisions designed to weaken it. Ohio Republican Representative Bob Ney has the support of party leaders with his proposal to limit soft money without banning it.

Enron Boosts Supporters

     Enron and its chairman, Ken Lay, were a major backer of the Republican Party in general and Bush in particular. The company gave almost $6 million in federal contributions since 1989,
including more than $3.6 million in soft money, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign finance.
     Enron's access to the Bush administration, such as Lay's private meeting with Cheney on energy policy last year, has been a target of editorial-writers. Republicans who defend the
administration use strong language in denouncing the current system.
     ``Here we are again, looking squarely in the face of injustice and abuse of power and privilege,'' said Zach Wamp, a Tennessee Republican. ``People should have had enough and they
should demand change.''
     News of the petition's success traveled quickly through the halls of the Capitol after Brown and Neal appeared on the House floor to deliver the last two signatures. Senator Joe Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat, interrupted a Governmental Affairs Committee hearing on Enron to announce the ``good news.''

Lobbying Has Begun

     The largest contributor was the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), a labor union that almost $6 million, all to Democrats. The largest corporate contributor was AT&T Corp. at $3.8 million, about 63 percent to Republicans.
     Common Cause, a public interest organization, has dispatched lobbyists to states including Florida and South Dakota to push the bill on radio talk shows and before newspaper editorial boards.
     Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican credited with getting the bill passed in the Senate, may go out on the stump.
     Opponents of the bill include AFSCME, which sent letters to the entire Congress urging them not to support the bill or sign the petition. A soft money ban will hamper voter participation,
the letter said.
     ``This limitation would significantly interfere with the ability of state and local candidates to communicate with the electorate,'' it said.
     Matthew Keller, a Common Cause lobbyist, said he doesn't mind the opposition.
     ``This means it's real again,'' he said.

SEC Chairman Pitt's Plan `Needs More Teeth,' Levitt Says
2002-01-24 12:42 (New York)

     Washington, Jan. 24 (Bloomberg) -- Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt's plan for accountant oversight ``needs more teeth,'' and Congress should step in with legislation in the wake of Enron Corp.'s collapse, former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt told Congress.
     ``We need a truly independent oversight body,'' Levitt told the Senate Government Affairs Committee, which opened hearings today on Enron's bankruptcy and the role played by its auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP.
     Levitt, a Democrat who headed the SEC from July 1993 to February 2001, also called for a ban on accounting firms' auditing and consulting for the same company. He said companies should be required to change auditors every five to seven years.
     Pitt, a Republican, has proposed a private accountants oversight group that would supervise audit reviews and discipline accountants for incompetence and ethics violations. His plan, which is still being worked out, calls for a majority of the board to be made up of public members, and for the group to be funded by the private sector outside the accounting industry.
     ``The initial Pitt proposal needs more teeth,'' Levitt said. All the board members of the new group should be drawn from the public sector, he said.
     Levitt is now a director of Bloomberg LP, parent of Bloomberg News.

Enron Asks Ct For Quick OK Of India Unit Sale To BG Grp
2002-01-24 16:33 (New York)

   By Kathy Chu 
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Bankrupt Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) is asking a federal
bankruptcy court for speedy approval of its  Enron Oil & Gas India unit sale to
BG Group PLC (BRG) for $350 million cash. 

  The transaction must be completed by Feb. 15, according to court documents,
or BG Group, a U.K. oil and gas company,  can walk away. 

  An "overwhelming need" exists to promptly close the sale, the distressed
company said in a filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern
District of New York. Failure to "expeditiously authorize the approval of the
sale of EOGIL will adversely affect the ability to close on this valuable
transaction," according to Enron. 

  The operation, or management rights, of Enron's upstream  oil and gas assets
in India is not a condition of the re-negotiated deal. 

  The energy-trading company - which originally signed a deal to sell the
assets to BG for $388 million - is asking the bankruptcy court for an early
February hearing to consider approval of the transaction.

SEC Considers Post-Enron Changes To Financial Reports
By Judith Burns

01/24/2002
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

SAN DIEGO -(Dow Jones)- Securities regulators are looking at ways to improve corporate financial reports in light of the collapse of Enron Corp. (ENRNQ), senior Securities and Exchange Commission officials said Thursday.
Changes such as greater scrutiny of Fortune 500 companies already have been announced. Others are in the works, including a proposal to permit companies to provide streamlined financial reports and include information on trends and other nonfinancial topics, SEC officials said. They gave the customary disclaimer that their remarks reflect their own views, not those of the SEC. 
"Enron has been very harmful, in devastating ways, to a lot of people, and the regulatory system did not prevent that," SEC general counsel David Becker said at Northwestern University law conference here. He said that has prompted regulators to consider changes to prevent similar accounting blowups in the future. 
For starters, the SEC will begin screening annual reports filed by Fortune 500 companies, beginning this month when 2001 reports are filed with the agency. 
If screening indicates a need for further scrutiny, "we will undertake a review," promised Alan Beller, director of the SEC's corporation finance division, speaking to the same group. "There will be no communication with the company" in the process, he added. 
The SEC hasn't said what might trigger concerns, but officials noted the agency has highlighted the need for better management discussion and analysis in corporate annual reports, including of off-balance sheet items and related party transactions, two areas that tripped up Enron. 
Enron, formerly ranked No. 7 on the Fortune 500, went bankrupt last year after announcing it had overstated four-and-a-half years' worth of earnings. The Houston energy company and its auditor, Arthur Andersen, are under investigation by the SEC, the Justice Department and various congressional committees. 
In response, SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt proposed creating a new private organization to oversee U.S. accountants and auditors. Becker said he hopes that will lead to reform, "rather than recrimination." 
Pitt's past ties to accountants - he represented Big Five firms in his private legal practice - isn't fair game for critics, Becker suggested. He said critics should focus "on the substance" of Pitt's proposal and not attribute a "darker motive" to him based on his "former clients." 
"All that counts, everything that counts, is what works" to protect investors, Becker said. 
Even before Enron's collapse, critics complained its financial reports obscured the company's real condition and have called for more disclosure of off-balance sheet items and deals. 
To that end, SEC chief accountant Robert Herdman said the SEC is likely to propose new rules to require better disclosure of corporate accounting policies, building on already issued guidance. 
"I guarantee there's going to be something out well before the end of this year," Herdman said Wednesday. 
Corporate decisions such as choosing an aggressive or conservative approach can have a huge impact on reported earnings, a fact Herdman said may be lost on investors. 
The SEC may require companies to identify critical accounting policies that affect reported earnings, making that "a required component of management discussion and analysis," Herdman said. 
"Accounting doesn't all come down to one number," Herdman stressed. While companies report precise earnings per share, he said a range of estimates may be "closer to the truth" than a single number. 
Another change being considered by the SEC, which Herdman outlined Thursday, would allow companies to provide shortened summary financial reports showing key results. 
"We think this has a lot of potential," said Herdman. "We're building a prototype now." 
The SEC floated a similar plan in the past, but withdrew it in the face of strong objections from investors who feared summary reports would omit important details. Corporations also blasted the idea, citing concerns that condensed reports could trigger more lawsuits from aggrieved investors. 
However, Internet technology could make the idea more appealing now and resolve those concerns, said Herdman. 
Herdman said he'd like the SEC to post a sample on the Internet, allowing investors to test how they could use a streamlined financial report with hypertext links to see as much or as little information as they want. 
Whether companies would still need to provide printed copies of complete financial reports to investors if the SEC approves streamlined reports is still being debated, along with technical matters such as whether the SEC's computers would be able to handle such reports. 
In addition to mulling condensed financial reports, Herdman said the SEC is considering other changes that would allow corporations to report nonfinancial information such as industry or corporate trends. Whether the SEC should require companies to disclose this information, or simply permit them to do so if they wish, has yet to be decided, he added.

Eyeless in Houston
The Real Values Crisis Behind the Enron Collapse

Commentary By Michael S. Malone
Editor-at-Large, Forbes ASAP
Special to ABCNEWS.com

Jan. 24 - The Enron scandal is really about a crisis of values - including one nobody seems to have noticed. 


Some of the values in disarray in this case are visible to everyone. There is, for example the most obvious one: How did a company with assets of only a few hundred million dollars, or at most a couple billion, have a market value of $100 billion? 
This, of course, isn't Enron's fault, but ours. We're the ones who drove the stock price up over $100 at the height of the boom. We're the ones who actually believed that companies like Enron could, in our lifetimes, actually grow their earnings to justify such stratospheric, and historically unprecedented, multiples. Why did we believe it, despite all reason? Because we were greedy. 
Then there is the value crisis of the industry analysts, those morons who were still putting out "buy" notices on Enron even after it was apparent to even the most dimwitted observer that the companies was a dangerous house of cards. Either these people were perfect fools and dupes (which is precisely what they were hired not to be), or shills for Enron, or were covering their own investments. Whatever, they placed their own interests over the needs of their clients and the public at large. 
Next comes the cravenness of our elected representatives. So far, Enron's well-placed sacks of money seemed to have bought more largesse from the Clinton Adminstration than the Bush (big surprise), but that is hardly any consolation. The bottom line is that everybody Congress to the White House, GOP and Dem, took the money and then they took the calls. Do you think you could call the Treasury Secretary and get a prompt reply? 
Drinking the Kool-Aid 
Then, of course, there is the management of Enron. In certain areas I'm a little more sympathetic than most people to Kenneth Lay and his gang of idiots. I've spent my life around entrepreneurial teams, and I know well how important it is to believe the plan, to drink the Kool-Aid. You have to act like a billion dollar company even as the office equipment company is repossessing the furniture. 
I even understand why the company put such a large percentage of its own stock in the employee 401(k) plan: it thought it was doing the employees a huge favor. The employees thought so too - I don't remember any of them complaining about it when the stock was hovering around $100. 
But one thing was reprehensible: That was when Lay, after he knew the company was going down, still promoted the purchase of company stock to his own employees and to the world at large. That was an unforgivable moral lapse. 
If he was a man of honor he would personally buy back every share bought by employees and private investors in the days after that announcement. If he is financially destroyed in the process, too bad, that's what standing by your values is all about. 
Keeping Up with the Hyperspeed Economy 
That brings us to Arthur Andersen - and the crisis no one is talking about. The obvious scandal is that Arthur Andersen's audit team once again failed miserably. Was it incompetence or conflict of interest? 
If there is any part of this story that demands an investigation - by Congress, by Justice, by the accounting industry itself - it is the moral failure of a leading firm in the profession to fulfill its moral duty to unflinchingly, and without bias, uncover the truth and present to the weak, the vulnerable and those without influence or voice. 
But we can't stop at Arthur Andersen. The real "values" crisis represented by the Enron mess is far deeper, and stretches across our economy. We are all being victimized by it, and the situation is growing ever worse. It is the great unreported business story of our time: the growing failure of the accounting system to accurately capture what is going in the new hyperspeed economy. 
Simply put, we have no idea what any company is worth today. The accounting industry is mired in a system that was devised 600 years ago and has only been fine-tuned ever since. It doesn't work any more. Accountants know it, corporate executives know it, and the stock market knows it. 
The general recognition of this fact has led to a widespread ethical sloppiness made manifest in such things as Arthur Andersen's apparent conflict. The reality is that the only time anybody really checks an audit anymore is after a financial disaster like Enron, when scapegoats must be found. 
Rear-View Mirror Accounting 
I once likened traditional accounting to driving a car by only looking in the rear view mirror. It can tell you where a company has recently been, but it is unable to tell you where that company is now. And in a world in which change occurs in nanoseconds, such obsolete data is worthless. 
Today, events arrive so swiftly, and change so constant, that it is no longer even enough to operate in the present. Modern business now runs in the future. The result is a growing gap between traditional "book" value and actual market value - and through that gap drives not only companies like Enron, but truly valuable firms like General Electric and Intel. 
Traditional accounting has long dealt with that gap through a line entry entitled "goodwill." But it was typically only added when a company sold for more than the total value of its inventory, buildings, etc. At most, this goodwill only represented a few percent of the total value. 
That was then. In the modern economy, for great, fast moving, innovative young companies this so-called "goodwill" can represent 90 percent of their value. When a corporate audit can only tell us about ten percent of a company, what the hell is the point? 
There have been a number of efforts in recent years to come up with innovative new ways to determine corporate value, many of them under the all-encompassing terms "intellectual capital" or "intangible assets". But they are still in their earliest stages, and most slam up against the formidable wall of the traditional accounting industry. 
Perhaps the Enron scandal will finally open our eyes. Maybe even a few company executives and Arthur Andersen accountants will go to jail. Maybe even, wish upon wish, the SEC will demand more timely and encompassing financial reporting. 
But have no illusions. There will be many more Enrons in the years ahead. And until we fix this problem, we are thrashing about without direction. We are blind.

More Enrons to come?
By Wolf Blitzer
CNN Wolf Blitzer Reports
January 24, 2002
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- By now, we have all heard the Enron horror stories about how employees there lost virtually their entire life savings when the once-huge energy giant became the largest bankruptcy in American history. Lest we forget -- it wasn't very long ago when Enron was the seventh largest company in the United States. 
I spoke with two former Enron employees the other day and heard their very sad stories. Roger Boyce worked in the field of safety and security for Enron in Minneapolis. Just months ago his retirement plan was worth more than $2 million. He's now retired, and his plan is worth "probably about $3,000." He's taken a nearly $2 million hit. 
He may have worked in the field of safety and security, but he personally wound up with neither. 
Janice Farmer was an Enron administrator in Orlando. She told me her retirement plan was once worth $700,000. "I was able to sell my stock before it actually hit the rock bottom," she said. "I sold at $4 and a penny [per share], and I received a check for $20,418." That's about a $680,000 hit. 
These are not isolated horror stories. Unfortunately, there are thousands of them. And what makes the matter even sadder is the fact that some of the top Enron executives sold their stock earlier and were able to make tens and even hundreds of millions of dollars. 
"I think it is becoming increasingly clear that employees and retirees were more than victimized by the Enron executives," Farmer said bitterly. "We were sacrificed for their own personal gain." 
Boyce agreed. "It should never have happened. There were risks that companies should never take, and they took it, and we're the victims." 
The Enron collapse has now been followed by the bankruptcy of another U.S. business giant -- Kmart. Indeed, most of us probably had never heard of Enron only a few months ago; all of us know the retail giant Kmart. 
I asked Steve Forbes, the President and CEO of Forbes, Inc, and former Republican presidential candidate, to tell me the difference between Enron and Kmart. As usual, he was blunt. 
Enron, he said, collapsed not only because of bad management, but because that management "went over the edge on fraud." Kmart, on the other hand, is today in dire straits because of bad management. He noted that ten years ago, Kmart had the same sales as Wal-Mart. Today, Wal-Mart has six times the sales of Kmart. "They didn't relocate into more profitable areas," Forbes told me. "They didn't keep up in terms of having good inventory systems, which Wal-Mart did. So that was a case of purely bad management." 
Forbes also pointed out that there are other huge companies out there already in deep financial trouble though he refused to name names. "But you look at areas, and the telecoms, there are still some disasters to come," he said. "They are overloaded with debt. And as a matter of fact, in terms of Enron, where the focus is right now, we have had huge busts in telecommunications and dot-coms. Hundreds of billions of dollars have been lost." 
So get ready for more roller-coaster rides as the economy shakes itself out. Remember -- don't make the mistake in trusting your retirement plans to only one or two investments. Diversify.

Ex-Enron exec who questioned company's finances dies in suicide 
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle staff and wire reports 
Jan. 25, 2002, 12:16PM
A former Enron Corp. executive who challenged the company's questionable financial practices and resigned last May was found shot to death in a car in Sugar Land today in what was ruled a suicide, authorities said. 
Enron officials confirmed the death this morning of J. Clifford Baxter, 43, former vice chairman of the embattled Houston company. 
His body and a note were found at 2:23 a.m. today between two medians in the 5200 block of Palm Royal, near his home in an upscale residential area in Sugar Land. He was in the driver's seat of the vehicle and a police officer stopped to check on him after noticing the parked car. 
The officer discovered what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound in Baxter's head. Police did not reveal the contents or nature of the note. 
Precinct 4 Justice of the Peace Jim Richard of Fort Bend County ruled Baxter's death a suicide mid-morning today. Richard said the car was locked and Sugar Land police had to break a window to get in. He said Baxter's body was in the driver's seat with a pistol in his hand. 
Richard initially decided the death was an obvious suicide and there was no need for an autopsy and the body was taken to a nearby funeral home. About noon, however, he indicated that an autopsy might be warranted. 
"We don't have any other indication other than it being suicide," said Sugar Land police Capt. David Marcaurele. 
Baxter was vice chairman of Enron when he resigned in May 2001, several months before the energy company's collapse. 
"We are deeply saddened by the tragic loss of our friend and colleague, Cliff Baxter," said an official company statement today. "Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and friends." 
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer had no additional comment. 
Baxter was identified by name in the explosive warning that Enron executive Sherron Watkins wrote last August to company chairman Ken Lay. 
"Cliff Baxter complained mightily to (then-CEO Jeff) Skilling and all who would listen about the inappropriateness of our transactions with LJM," one of the partnerships that kept hundreds of millions of dollars in debt off Enron's books. 
Watkins identified Baxter in a section of her letter stating there is "a veil of secrecy around LJM and Raptor," another entity involved in the partnerships. 
Watkins' letter to Lay stated that "we will implode in a wave of accounting scandals" unless the company halted practices that eventually sent it into bankruptcy. 
Baxter was the lead negotiator on Enron's purchase of Portland General Electric in 1997. 
He was one of 29 former and current Enron executives and board members named as defendants in a federal lawsuit. Plaintiffs' lawyers said the executives made $1.1 billion by selling Enron stock between October 1998 and November 2001. 
It said Baxter had sold 577,436 shares for $35.2 million. 
According to the May 2001 press release, Baxter was to have continued working for the company as a consultant. 
Baxter was born Sept. 27, 1958 in Amityville, N.Y., received a bachelor's of science from New York University in 1980 and an MBA from Columbia University seven years later. He was a captain in the U.S. Air Force, 1980-85. 
Baxter had joined Enron in 1991 and was chairman and CEO of Enron North America prior to being named chief strategy officer for Enron Corp. in June 2000 and vice chairman in October 2000, the company said. 
Baxter resigned from Enron months before the company imploded amid revelations of questionable financing and overstated earnings. 
Enron's downfall began in mid-October with the release of a $618 million third-quarter loss and a $1.2 billion writedown of shareholder equity. Subsequent revelations of partnerships that allowed Enron to keep half a billion dollars in debt off its books and elimination of millions in profits with restated earnings since 1997 fueled the company's descent into the largest bankruptcy in history on Dec. 2. 
In the May 2001 resignation announcement, Skilling said, "Over the past 10 years, Cliff has made a tremendous contribution to Enron's evolution, particularly as a member of the team that built Enron's wholesale business. 
"His creativity, intelligence, sense of humor and straightforward manner have been assets to the company throughout his career. While we will miss him, we are happy that his primary reason for resigning is to spend additional time with his family, and we wish him the very best." 


Former Enron exec Baxter dead
Vice chairman who left in May apparently killed himself

By Lisa Sanders, CBS.MarketWatch.com
Last Update: 1:13 PM ET Jan. 25, 2002
HOUSTON (CBS.MW) - The Enron saga took a tragic turn after former Vice-Chairman J. Clifford Baxter, who resigned his post in May 2001, died of an apparent suicide, police said Friday. He was 43.
"We are deeply saddened by the tragic loss of our friend and colleague, Cliff Baxter," Enron said in a statement. "Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and friends."
According to police in Sugar Land, Texas, outside Houston, Baxter was found dead in his car Friday with a gunshot wound to his head. Police said they found a suicide note and no sign of foul play.
"From our investigation everything points toward (suicide)," said Captain David Marcaurele of the Sugar Land Police Department. "He was found in his vehicle in Sugar Land with an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. He was dead at the scene and the sole occupant in the vehicle."
A Sugar Land police officer stopped to check on the driver of the car because it was parked in residential area between two medians, Marcaurele said.
Details of the suicide note were not being released Friday. Marcaurele declined to comment on the contents.
Baxter was most recently working for Enron as a consultant. In a letter Enron employee Sherron Watkins wrote to former Chairman Ken Lay in August, she mentioned Baxter as she questioned the company's accounting practices. 
"Cliff Baxter complained mightily to Skilling and all who would listen about the inappropriateness of our transactions with LJM," Watkins wrote. Jeffrey Skilling, Enron's former chief executive, abruptly resigned his post in mid-August.
Former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow created and managed the two LJM partnerships. Related-party transactions conducted within the partnerships cost Enron and caused the company to take a $1.2 billion equity reduction in the third quarter of 2001.
The transactions led to a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. The revelation of the equity reduction along with a $1 billion third-quarter charge the company began the process that led to Enron's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing on Dec. 2.
Baxter joined Enron in 1991 and was chairman of Enron North America -- the crown jewel of the now bankrupt company -- until he got the job of chief strategy officer of the corporation in June 2000. Enron named Baxter vice-chairman in October 2000.

Former Enron Executive Baxter Kills Self, Police Say
2002-01-25 13:28 (New York)

     Sugar Land, Texas, Jan. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Former Enron Corp. Vice Chairman John Clifford Baxter, who criticized secret partnership agreements that bankrupted the energy trader and spawned federal investigations, committed suicide, said police in Sugar Land, Texas. He was 43.

     Baxter's body was found in his car at 2:23 a.m. with ``an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head,'' according to a statement e-mailed by police to Bloomberg News. "Baxter was dead at the scene and the sole occupant of the vehicle. A suicide note was found at the scene.''

     Baxter, who helped build Enron's wholesale energy trading business, resigned in May after a decade with the company. He had clashed with former Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Skilling and "complained mightily'' about the ``inappropriateness'' of partnerships used to keep debt off Enron's books, Vice President Sherron Watkins said in a letter released by U.S. investigators.

     Baxter was one of six Enron directors named as defendants in at least 40 investor lawsuits claiming the company concealed losses that led to Enron's bankruptcy filing on Dec. 2.

     "We are deeply saddened by the tragic loss of our friend and colleague, Cliff Baxter,'' Enron said in a faxed statement. "Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and friends.''

Sold Shares

     Baxter made $42.4 million from selling nearly 654,000 shares of Enron stock over the past four years, according to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings. He was responsible for strategy, including acquisitions and divestitures, spokeswoman Karen Denne said at the time of Baxter's resignation.

     Baxter was named Enron's chief strategy officer in June 2000. Before that, he was chairman and chief executive of Enron North America.

     Baxter and his wife gave $10,000 to the Republican National Committee in the last election cycle, according to FECInfo, which tracks campaign finance.

     Baxter served five years in the U.S. Air Force, retiring as a captain in 1985. He attended New York University and Columbia University business school. He was born in Amityville, New York.

     Mark Frevert, Baxter's successor, left the company at the end of December.

     The House Energy and Commerce Committee had planned to subpoena Baxter, Representative Jim Greenwood said. He declined to say why or what the committee would ask Baxter.

     Sugar Land is a small community southwest of Houston.

Former Enron Executive Found Dead

By KRISTEN HAYS, Associated Press Writer
9:42 AM PST, January 25, 2002 

HOUSTON -- A former Enron Corp. executive who challenged the company's questionable financial practices and resigned last May was found shot to death in a car today, an apparent suicide, authorities said. 

Police in the suburb, Sugar Land, confirmed the death of 43-year-old J. Clifford Baxter, a former Enron vice chairman. He was shot in the head. 

"We are deeply saddened by the tragic loss of our friend and colleague, Cliff Baxter. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and friends," the company said in a statement. 

Spokesman Mark Palmer had no additional comment.

Enron's Baxter 'Complained Mightily' About Transactions

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- J. Clifford Baxter, the Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) executive who committed suicide Friday, resigned from the company last May after he "complained mightily" about the inappropriateness of certain financial transactions that sent the Houston energy-trading giant into bankruptcy by year-end.
Baxter, a former vice chairman at Enron, "complained mightily to Skilling and all who would listen about the inappropriateness of our transactions with LJM," Enron executive Sherron Watkins said in an August memo to Kenneth Lay, who resigned this week as the company's chairman and chief executive. 
Watkins sent the memo anonymously, concerned that increasing investor scrutiny in the wake of the surprise August resignation of Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling would uncover the facts about the transactions and Enron would "implode in a wave of accounting scandals." 
LJM was one of the special-purpose entities Enron established to take its debt off the books, inflating earnings and the company's stock value. Losses incurred through the partnership led to the company's historic financial collapse last year. 
Baxter was among seven top Enron executives reported to have earned millions from insider stock sales last year.

WSJ Says Enron Officials Knew About Chewco Partnership=20

Top Enron executives, including Chairman Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skillin=
g, knew about the controversial partnerships, according to the Wall Street =
Journal, citing minutes from a November 5, 1997 meeting. Former CFO Andrew =
Fastow and several board members including external director Herbert Winoku=
r Jr were also at the meeting that discussed Enron's partnership Chewco, na=
med for the Star Wars character Chewbacca. Chewco, which was supposed to be=
 completely independent, but was run and partly owned by Enron executive Mi=
chael Kopper, who also attended the meeting. Federal investigators and priv=
ate litigants are trying to find out who knew what about Chewco and when. A=
n attorney for Winokur says the executive committee was told that Chewco wa=
s a special-purpose vehicle not affiliated with the company. The board neve=
r waived the conflict-of-interest policy for Kopper nor was the board told =
that Kopper was involved with Chewco.=20

Lay Breaks Date with Congress After Report Issued

Enron attempted to systematically manipulate its financial results and dece=
ive shareholders as top executives made personal gains of millions of dolla=
rs, according to William Powers, dean of the University of Texas Law School=
 in testimony to be delivered before Congress yesterday. There was also fai=
lures in the performance of Enron's outside advisors. And there was a funda=
mental default of leadership and management, starting with former CEO Ken L=
ay and reaching to the board and senior managers. As Congress begins a week=
 of hearings, the House Financial Services capital markets subcommittee als=
o heard from SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt. Powers joined the Enron board to inv=
estigate events leading up to the company filing for bankruptcy on December=
 2nd. He has issued a 218-page report that found Enron fattened its profits=
 by almost $1 billion through a web of financial partnerships used to hide =
losses, while top managers made millions of dollars they should never have =
received. ! He laid some of the blame for on Lay and of Jeffrey Skilling. P=
owers said former ex-Enron CFO Andrew Fastow made at least $30 million, whi=
le former senior executive Michael Kopper made at least $10 million through=
 their involvement in off-the-books partnerships. Enrons board of directors=
 failed in its duty to provide leadership and oversight and in the end, the=
 tragedy could and should have been avoided, Powers said. After the report =
was released, Lay canceled plans to testify before a Senate committee and b=
efore the capital markets subcommittee.=20

Williams May Sell Midwest Oil Products Pipeline

Williams may sell its 8,000-mile Midwest oil products pipeline and storage =
depots for between $500 million and $1.5 billion, to help defray costs from=
 possible exposure to $2.4 billion from Williams Communications. Last week,=
 Williams postponed the release of 4th quarter results to review costs asso=
ciated with Williams Communications Group, which was spun off in April. Wil=
liams said that those costs will be included in the 4th quarter earnings re=
port. Williams Energy Partners which is 60% owned by Williams has been ment=
ioned as a likely buyer for the pipeline. Williams has sold securities and =
cut capital spending to shore up its balance sheet amid heavier scrutiny by=
 credit rating agencies following Enrons bankruptcy. Williams 7.5% coupon b=
onds maturing in 2031 were down about $44 to $879 per $1,000 face value fro=
m $923 last week, with the spread above US Treasuries climbing to 330 basis=
 points from 285. None of the rating agencies has downgraded Williams debt =
yet, but S! ?has says it may lower Williams ratings because of concern abou=
t the company's finances. S?rates Williams BBB+, Moody's rates it Baa2 and =
Fitch rates it as BBB, all investment grade. Williams is aiming complete th=
e Midwest pipeline sale by the end of the 2nd quarter. Net income for Willi=
ams Energy Partners more climbed to $21.7 million from $3 million a year ag=
o. It also  raised quarterly payment to unit holders by 12% to $0.59. The p=
ossible purchase of the Midwest pipeline could be financed through a combin=
ation of debt and equity, Williams Energy Partners said. The partnership ha=
s $140 million in private debt. Williams said its 4th quarter loss had wide=
ned and its banks have warned that the it may be in default of their credit=
 agreements. Williams stock dropped 13.9% yesterday, down 2.64 to 16.36.=20

TRADERS DEBATE SHORT SIDE OF MARKET

Although Monday's price action on the New York Mercantile Exchange is perha=
ps best described as lackadaisical, some traders see inspiration to take th=
e short side of the market where others are focusing on a longer term trend=
 higher.  "When the March contract expired (January 29), it got as low as $=
1.97 and developed a modest countertrend higher. As long as the market was =
able to continue trading above the previous day's low, that advance worked =
well," noted Dean Hazelcorn, trader with Coquest, Dallas.  "Today looks lik=
e a sell signal. The high of the March contract did not exceed Friday's hig=
h and today's low was lower. That sets up a trade down to $1.97. I look for=
 a slow deteriorating front end of the board," he noted.  "I'm back in a be=
arish mode, and I think we're headed below $2.00. I believe that there is a=
 99% probability the market will work lower, but it may take 3 months to do=
 it," he cautioned.  Other traders are more optimistic.  "Longer ter! m I'm=
 bullish," says John Beaver, President Private Futures Group, Oklahoma City=
.  "It's more difficult to be bullish on the front of the board, but lookin=
g at the charts it suggests that prices may be set to rise.  There's a gap =
on the weekly chart between $2.17 and $2.20 on the weekly chart (week endin=
g January 18, and January 25). and if prices could fill that gap, it would =
be a positive sign that prices were set to move higher," he said.  A gap is=
 a pattern on the price charts followed by market technicians. The idea is =
that the gap may act as a barrier to (in this case) further price advances.=
 Once the gap is "filled", however, a potential limitation to price advance=
s has been removed and prices would be empowered to move higher.  "I don't =
have any interest in being short the market at the $2.00 level. I don't wan=
t to be in a trade that may only make 10 or 15 cents and have to worry abou=
t it," he said.  "If you are a commercial trader are you going to get short=
 at $1.85! ? What is your board of directors going to say?"=20

Ousted Enron Chief Executive Kenneth L. Lay could get a severance package w=
orth at least $25 million--and perhaps exceeding $51 million--although his =
ability to collect that payday is clouded by the company's Chapter 11 bankr=
uptcy filing.=20
Lay, who resigned Wednesday under fire, also could get parting gifts that i=
nclude a lifetime annual pension of nearly $475,000, a $12-million life ins=
urance policy and payment of taxes on any severance pay.
But Lay may never see a dime because, with most of Enron Corp.'s operations=
 tangled in U.S. Bankruptcy Court, he slipped overnight from corporate comm=
ander to yet another among the thousands of Enron creditors.=20
"I would be incredulous if he got any money, and if he did take any money h=
e'd be spending the entire amount on bodyguards," compensation expert Graef=
 Crystal said.=20
Lay, who received more than $200 million in compensation from Enron since 1=
999, has been accused of misleading shareholders about Enron's finances as =
it plunged toward ruin last year.=20
In his 15 years building Enron from a small pipeline company to the world's=
 largest energy trader, Lay was paid handsomely, and his severance agreemen=
t and other benefits reflect that, according to documents on file with the =
Securities and Exchange Commission.=20
Exactly how much Lay might receive in severance is only vaguely spelled out=
 in Enron's most recent proxy statement, filed with the SEC in March. Enron=
 representatives declined to clarify the matter and hinted that the payout =
might not be a sure thing.=20
"The terms of Mr. Lay's separation are still being determined," Enron spoke=
sman Vance Meyer said.=20
Three Times His Salary and Bonus, Plus=20
Lay's severance is based on payments he received in 2000, multiplied by the=
 three full calendar years left on his contract. That means Lay would be en=
titled to a lump sum of about $25 million, or three times his 2000 salary o=
f $1.3 million and bonus of $7 million.=20
That $25-million tab would be further swelled by an unspecified "long-term =
grant value" received in 2000, according to the proxy statement. Compensati=
on experts said that could include the $7.5 million of restricted stock and=
 a $1.2-million cash payment that Lay also received in 2000, which Enron ca=
lled "long-term compensation."=20
If that assessment is correct, the total payout would be $51 million.=20
The SEC filing also said that Lay is entitled to a lifetime pension that wo=
uld have been valued at $475,042 if Lay, 59, had stayed until 65. In additi=
on, the company said it would pay all taxes on Lay's severance if the IRS r=
ules that the severance package is an "excess parachute payment."=20
What is more, Lay, as of the end of 2001, owns a $12-million life insurance=
 policy that Enron helped him buy, according to Lay's 1996 employment agree=
ment, also filed with the SEC.=20
Lay also remains as an Enron director, and they are paid at least $50,000 a=
 year.=20
Compensation experts said it is unlikely Lay will get his severance package=
 and most of his pension because all preexisting contracts are invalidated =
by the bankruptcy filing and the fact that Lay technically resigned, rather=
 than being terminated. But the refusal of the company to rule out a severa=
nce is "troublesome," Crystal said.=20
In any event, even as Enron was hiding losses in a murky series of off-the-=
books partnerships and using questionable accounting on its way to the nati=
on's largest bankruptcy filing, the company served another purpose that nea=
rly was hidden from public view: It effectively was a personal bank for Ken=
 Lay.=20
The company last year provided Lay with an unusual line of credit of as muc=
h as $7.5 million that he used repeatedly, often to help cover soured inves=
tments he made elsewhere, his lawyer has said. This despite the fact that L=
ay has received more than $200 million in compensation from Enron since 199=
9.=20
And the collateral securing the line of credit apparently was Lay's own Enr=
on stock, shares of which were showered on him by the thousands either dire=
ctly or through stock options that were part of his compensation package du=
ring Enron's explosive growth in the late 1990s.=20
Lay typically repaid the credit line with his Enron shares, then would draw=
 down the loan again and repeat the process, Earl Silbert, Lay's lawyer, sa=
id. Lay did this on 15 occasions between February and October, just as Enro=
n's collapse was accelerating.=20
Lay Expected to Face Huge Legal Bills=20
Lay's apparent financial problems, signaled by his repeated tapping of the =
credit line, are compounded by the specter of huge personal legal bills fac=
ing him. Lay is the subject of more than 50 lawsuits resulting from Enron's=
 financial meltdown, as well as numerous federal investigations.=20
His credit line is a perk that has surprised several experts in executive c=
ompensation, a field already chock-full of various stock options, bonuses a=
nd other benefits paid to Corporate America's leaders.=20
To have a standing credit line for an executive who can pay back the loan w=
ith stock the company has awarded him is "very unusual," said Alan Johnson,=
 managing director of Johnson Associates, a compensation consultant in New =
York. The arrangement, approved by Enron's board, allowed Lay "to treat the=
 company as a personal piggy bank," he said.=20
Bill Coleman, senior vice president of compensation at Salary.com, an Inter=
net compensation site, said that "there is something fundamentally odd abou=
t a company loaning money to an executive and collateralizing it with the c=
ompany's own stock."=20
"Why is Enron in the business of loaning money?" he asked.=20
Company Loans to Top Management=20
It is common for a company to make one-time loans to senior managers--say t=
o help them relocate or to buy the company's shares. Sometimes corporations=
 will even waive the interest, or total repayment, as part of the executive=
's future compensation. Indeed, Enron in 1997 made a $4-million loan to Jef=
frey K. Skilling, its chief executive who abruptly quit in August.=20
Also, the dollar amount of Lay's credit line isn't sizable relative to the =
billions of dollars of debt that sank Enron. After a series of financial se=
tbacks that sent its stock plunging and eroded investors' confidence, Enron=
 filed for Bankruptcy Court protection Dec. 2, citing more than $31 billion=
 in debt and $50 billion in assets.=20
The stock, which traded around $80 a share a year ago, now trades for just =
pennies, and the options that Lay and others still have are virtually worth=
less.=20
Silbert did not return calls requesting elaboration on Lay's arrangement, a=
nd Enron spokesman Meyer said he could provide no further details.=20
No one has suggested that Lay's arrangement involved any wrongdoing, and En=
ron's proxy statement last year disclosed--in two sentences--that the credi=
t line existed. About the same time that the proxy appeared, in March, was =
when Lay was starting to use the credit line repeatedly.=20
He typically repaid it by returning shares of his Enron stock to the compan=
y, said Silbert, who said he made the public disclosure to offset speculati=
on that Lay was aggressively dumping shares because the executive knew the =
company was headed toward disaster.=20
But that disclosure--coming on top of so many other revelations, including =
that some top Enron executives had financial interests in partnerships that=
 helped finance Enron's operations--adds to the appearance that "there is a=
n awful lot of self-dealing going on in this case, and this is symptomatic =
of that," said Rajesh Aggarwal, an assistant business professor at Dartmout=
h College.=20
In September, at the same time Lay was using his Enron stock to support his=
 line of credit, he urged company employees to buy more shares only weeks b=
efore Enron disclosed the worst financial results in its history.=20
The stock then was selling for about $25 a share, and two months later for =
$4 a share. The stock's collapse wiped out billions of dollars of investor =
holdings and the retirement savings of Enron employees who owned the stock.=
=20
In general, Lay's credit-line arrangement "is not one that's shareholder fr=
iendly," said Salary.com's Coleman. The whole point of executive compensati=
on is to give top managers incentives to build the company and boost its st=
ock price for all shareholders, he said, yet Lay's credit line gave him pro=
tection from having to reach into his own wallet even when Enron's stock no=
se-dived.=20
"He doesn't get hurt," Coleman said.=20
The credit line served another purpose not afforded the average Enron stock=
holder, said Kevin Murphy, a finance professor at USC. Letting Lay repay hi=
s credit line with Enron stock "allowed him to get liquidity out of his sto=
ck that was easier than going to the open market," he said. In other words,=
 Lay didn't have to first sell $4 million or so of Enron shares on the stoc=
k exchange--an event that likely would have depressed Enron's price on the =
market--each time to pay back his Enron loans.=20
"That gives him an advantage that most stockholders don't have," Murphy sai=
d.=20
The credit line also raises questions about the amount of risk Lay was pers=
onally accepting at the same time he was leading Enron's fight for survival=
.=20
It's unclear why, in light of his enormous compensation at Enron, he was ha=
ving to repeatedly tap his credit line.=20
Besides his salary and bonuses, Lay realized $43.8 million from stock optio=
ns that he cashed in during 1999, and $123.4 million from exercising option=
s in 2000, according to Enron's government filings.=20
Lay sometimes borrowed from his Enron line of credit last year when he expe=
cted to face margin calls from other lenders, Silbert has said. That meant =
he had bought other investments partly with borrowed funds--or on "margin"-=
-and now had to repay some or all of those amounts because their underlying=
 investments had tumbled in value.=20
Lay recently put several properties up for sale, including vacation homes i=
n Aspen, Colo.=20
Now that Lay is gone, Enron is searching for a restructuring specialist to =
run the company. Sources close to the company said an interim chief executi=
ve will be announced in the next few days.=20
Enron reportedly has narrowed the candidates for its interim chief executiv=
e, and the front-runners are three New York companies that specialize in co=
rporate turnarounds, according to Bloomberg News. Those companies--Alvarez =
& Marsal, Glass & Associates and Zolfo Cooper--all declined to comment.=20

Accounting for Enron: Enron's Top Choice For Acting CEO Is Stephen Cooper
By Rebecca Smith and Joann S. Lublin
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

01/25/2002
The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Reorganization specialist Stephen F. Cooper is the front-runner to be named=
 acting chief executive of Enron Corp., following the resignation earlier t=
his week of Kenneth Lay as chairman and CEO, people close to the matter sai=
d.=20
Mr. Cooper, a managing principal of Zolfo Cooper, a 20-year-old consulting =
firm that specializes in bankruptcy reorganization, is set to fly to Housto=
n from New York today along with Tom Roberts, Enron's counsel at Weil Gotsc=
hal & Manges, these people said.
Mr. Cooper, who couldn't be reached, is scheduled to meet with senior manag=
ement during the next few days. Enron's board could confirm his appointment=
 as soon as today, but more likely will act during the weekend. Mr. Cooper,=
 who has worked with Federated Department Stores Inc., Morrison Knudsen Cor=
p. and a host of other companies, "is one of those guys who's done bankrupt=
cies his whole life," said one person familiar with the situation. "You don=
't want somebody learning on the job with a bankruptcy this big."=20
If Mr. Cooper is named, the board next will turn its attention to finding a=
 chairman.=20
While Enron wants a chief executive who will manage its complicated day-to-=
day operations and shepherd the firm through bankruptcy, which it entered o=
n Dec. 2, the board is seeking a chairman who can play a different role. On=
e person said the chairman's post -- for which there is no clear front-runn=
er yet -- will be offered to someone who can act as the company's ambassado=
r to Washington, where Enron is being investigated by nine congressional co=
mmittees, the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission=
.=20
Mr. Lay stepped down at the request of Enron's bankruptcy creditors' commit=
tee after it said it had lost faith in the energy company's management. Who=
ever is named as CEO is expected to work closely with Chief Financial Offic=
er Jeffrey McMahon, who has been the firm's public face in recent weeks aft=
er the departure of Enron's former finance chief, Andrew Fastow.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE COMPANY'S FUTURE
Trying to Salvage What Can Be Salvaged While the Creditors Line Up
By NEELA BANERJEE

01/25/2002
The New York Times
Page 7, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

When he resigned as chairman and chief executive of Enron on Wednesday unde=
r pressure from outside creditors, Kenneth L. Lay said he was stepping asid=
e to ensure the survival of the company. But as Enron tries to sort through=
 creditors' claims and to tally the billions of dollars in debt parked off =
its balance sheet, its chances of surviving, even in a greatly diminished f=
orm, remain far from certain.=20
The creditors' committee, which represents the big banks and other companie=
s Enron owes, wants to extract the greatest value from the assets remaining=
. So do the company's own lawyers. But to do so probably will require selli=
ng off most, if not all, of what the company still owns, industry analysts =
and energy executives said.
''There's a high likelihood that it just gets liquidated and never gets out=
 of Chapter 11,'' said Andre Meade, a senior energy analyst with Commerzban=
k. ''Enron doesn't have a business with a critical mass that it could be re=
organized around.''=20
The company is moving quickly to hire an outside executive who specializes =
in restructuring bankrupt companies, said Martin J. Bienenstock of Weil Got=
shal & Manges, the law firm that is representing Enron in the bankruptcy pr=
oceedings. Mr. Bienenstock declined to identify the candidates for the job.=
 But he said the list had been narrowed to three executives, at most, and t=
hat Enron would probably announce its decision in less than a week.=20
Right now, Enron is being run day to day by Jeffrey McMahon, who was elevat=
ed to chief financial officer to replace Andrew S. Fastow, who was forced o=
ut last fall after his role in managing the off-the-books partnerships that=
 contributed to Enron's fall came to light.=20
Mr. McMahon is working alongside Raymond M. Bowen Jr., the treasurer, and S=
tan Horton, who is in charge of gas pipeline operations.=20
''The creditors' committee thinks this is a step in the right direction to =
maximize value for all creditors,'' said Luc Despins of Milbank Tweed Hadle=
y & McCloy, which represents the committee.=20
Exactly how Enron's value will be maximized at the hands of its lawyers and=
 creditors will determine the future shape of the company. When it filed fo=
r bankruptcy protection on Dec. 2, Enron reported that it had $50 billion i=
n assets and $31 billion in debt. But many industry experts are skeptical o=
f the claims that its assets are fairly valued, given how misleading Enron'=
s accounting has turned out to be.=20
Moreover, the reported debt does not include transactions that were kept of=
f the books by the company to inflate its profits, Mr. Bienenstock said. Th=
e $50 billion in assets includes contracts in its trading and power marketi=
ng businesses, industry analysts said. But with its trading operation paral=
yzed ever since the bankruptcy, no one knows what those deals are really wo=
rth.=20
The sell-off at Enron has already begun. The company recently turned over i=
ts energy trading business to UBS Warburg. In return for assuming the contr=
acts of about 600 employees and acquiring things like computers and proprie=
tary software, UBS Warburg will give Enron a third of its profits over the =
next 10 years, although it has an option to buy out Enron's claim early. It=
 made no upfront payments.=20
Enron still owns the network of natural gas pipelines that it began with in=
 the mid-1980's. But that business, while profitable, is far smaller than t=
he other units at the company. It also has a utility in Portland, Ore., tha=
t is being sold. Enron's overseas holdings, widely considered money-losers,=
 include a troubled power plant in Dabhol, India, and a utility in Argentin=
a.=20
''The main business, the one anyone would really care about -- their tradin=
g business -- they sold to UBS,'' said Gordon Howald, an energy analyst wit=
h Credit Lyonnais. ''Their international portfolio is horrible. Their broad=
band business has been disbanded. There is very, very little of value left.=
''=20
But Mr. Bienenstock contended that through a mix of asset sales and consoli=
dation of remaining business, some version of Enron can still survive. Enro=
n's lawyers are discussing with the creditors' committee the best way to se=
ll those businesses that they think are worth the most intact while trying =
to rebuild others that might bring profits and revenue in the future. Those=
 remaining businesses would form the core of a new company in which credito=
rs would receive equity positions.=20
At the same time, Enron faces a sea of shareholder and employee losses. Mr.=
 Bienenstock said those suing for mismanagement of 401(k) retirement accoun=
ts would have the same rights as creditors with unsecured debt. But those c=
harging stock fraud would be at the back of the creditors' line, along with=
 Enron shareholders. Still, such plaintiffs retain the right to pursue laws=
uits against Arthur Andersen and individual officers and board members of E=
nron.=20
''The creditors' committee is economically rational,'' Mr. Bienenstock said=
, explaining why he does not think that Enron will melt away in a fire sale=
. ''If the shares in a reorganized company are more valuable than selling t=
he assets immediately, the creditors will take the shares.''

newly released document shows.=20
That determination came from a test on the Houston energy company's financi=
al statements described in an Oct. 9 e-mail sent by Mark Zajac, a risk-mana=
gement employee in Chicago, to Andersen auditors on the Enron account. Mich=
igan Rep. John Dingell, the senior Democrat on the House Energy and Commerc=
e Committee, released the e-mail as the panel's investigations subcommittee=
 opened hearings on Enron's collapse.
At the hearing, which focused on document destruction at Andersen, firm exe=
cutives acknowledged that they retained a law firm in early October in part=
 because they feared being sued over Enron -- but waited another month befo=
re telling the Houston office to preserve Enron-related documents.=20
Andersen's lead Enron auditor, David Duncan, was fired this month for alleg=
edly overseeing a massive document-destruction effort after the Securities =
and Exchange Commission opened an inquiry into Enron's accounting practices=
 in late October. Yesterday, Andersen acknowledged that personnel outside H=
ouston also destroyed documents.=20
The Zajac e-mail provides another indication that Mr. Duncan and other Ande=
rsen auditors were increasingly uncomfortable with Enron's practices as it =
spiraled toward collapse. The e-mail also offers a clue to Mr. Duncan's sta=
te of mind as he and his subordinates were shredding documents. The e-mail =
was dated a week before a previously disclosed Oct. 15 memo that recounted =
Mr. Duncan warning Enron that its upcoming third-quarter earnings announcem=
ent might be misleading. The Oct. 16 earnings news release characterized $1=
.01 billion of losses as "nonrecurring charges," a characterization Mr. Dun=
can opposed.=20
Mr. Zajac's analysis was based on a "financial statement fraud risk identif=
ication" test. Such tests are routine in auditing, but the Enron results we=
ren't. Mr. Zajac wrote that a complete test was impossible because sufficie=
nt data about administrative expenses were lacking. But a test of the rest =
of Enron's financial statements triggered a "red alert: a heightened risk o=
f financial fraud." Mr. Zajac's e-mail explained that such red alerts somet=
imes are false alarms, but must be taken seriously because the risk of frau=
d is "significantly heightened."=20
The results were relayed to Mr. Duncan a month before Enron announced on No=
v. 19 that it would restate its financial statements going back to 1997, cu=
mulatively reducing earnings by nearly $600 million. "In the context of the=
 Enron debacle, this is tantamount to yelling that the barn door is open lo=
ng after the horses have fled the scene and shown up in the next county," R=
ep. Dingell wrote in a letter to Andersen Chief Executive Joseph Berardino =
inquiring about the matter.=20
Andersen spokesman Charlie Leonard said he didn't know what actions its aud=
itors took to address the "red alert." But he emphasized that Andersen had =
been conducting the particular test referred to in the e-mail only "on an e=
xperimental basis" since 2000 and that past runs "have shown that it needs =
further refinement," especially when applied to companies such as Enron.=20
At the hearing, Andersen officials continued to pin responsibility for the =
shredding on Mr. Duncan and his Houston team, but committee members peppere=
d them with questions and evidence aimed at shifting the blame toward Chica=
go headquarters.=20
Andersen's internal "investigation indicated that [Mr. Duncan] directed the=
 purposeful destruction of a very substantial volume of documents," said C.=
E. Andrews, Andersen's global managing partner. "This is the kind of conduc=
t that Andersen cannot tolerate."=20
Subcommittee Chairman James Greenwood, a Pennsylvania Republican, remained =
skeptical as the hearing closed: "What I got after four hours here is a lar=
ger question of whether Mr. Duncan is a fall guy for others at Arthur Ander=
sen."=20
The hearing provided the most detailed chronology yet of the circumstances =
surrounding the document destruction.=20
Members focused much of their questioning on the decision to hire the New Y=
ork law firm of Davis Polk & Wardwell, which was retained Oct. 9 -- the sam=
e day as Mr. Zajac's e-mail about financial fraud -- and now represents And=
ersen in Enron litigation. Mr. Andrews said the firm was retained to help d=
eal with Enron financial-reporting issues as well as "possible litigation."=
 By then, headquarters officials already were aware of a whistleblower's al=
legations of possible fraud at Enron.=20
On Oct. 12, Andersen attorney Nancy Temple sent an e-mail from Chicago to r=
emind the Houston office of the firm's document-retention policy, which cal=
ls for preserving final audit papers but destroying nearly all other record=
s unless litigation is "threatened." By about that time, Ms. Temple testifi=
ed she had learned of the whistleblower's allegations, too, but she rejecte=
d suggestions that the reminder amounted to a document-destruction order. S=
he insisted she was merely responding to questions in prior conference call=
s "about how to appropriately document several different matters."=20
Three days after sending that e-mail, Ms. Temple had her first discussions =
with lawyers from Davis Polk about the Enron matter, which included documen=
t-retention issues. That same day, Ms. Temple asked the Houston office in a=
n e-mail to remove her name from a draft memo, in part because she didn't w=
ant to be called as a "witness." Ms. Temple explained that she was afraid t=
hat, because the memo discussed advice she offered, the inclusion of a refe=
rence to her might breach attorney-client privilege.=20
On Oct. 22, the SEC announced an informal inquiry into Enron. The next day,=
 Ms. Temple testified, she and Mr. Duncan talked by telephone. Ms. Temple s=
aid her notes indicate that Mr. Duncan said Andersen personnel were "trying=
 to gather all docs re transactions from around the world."=20
"Do your notes indicate that the documents were gathered and preserved or s=
imply gathered?" Colorado Democratic Rep. Diane DeGette asked, prompting la=
ughter. Ms. Temple responded that she understood Mr. Duncan to mean gathere=
d "in one place to have it available."=20
In fact, that was the day that, according to Andersen's account, Mr. Duncan=
 called an urgent meeting of the Enron team that led to widespread destruct=
ion of documents. Before declining to testify, he told committee investigat=
ors that he provided his team with copies of Andersen's document policy but=
 didn't directly order document destruction, according to an account releas=
ed by the panel. A follow-up memo from another Houston manager the next day=
 advised "everyone to do what is necessary to adhere to the guidelines" and=
 to work overtime if necessary to do so.=20
Buried in the Andersen officials' written testimony -- but not read aloud a=
t the hearing -- was an acknowledgment that "Enron-related documents were d=
estroyed by others" outside Mr. Duncan's team. Mr. Leonard, the Andersen sp=
okesman, confirmed that personnel outside Houston also disposed of Enron-re=
lated items -- mostly e-mails that the firm expect to recover -- but he dec=
lined to say which other offices were involved or if Chicago was one of the=
m.=20
It was only after Andersen received an SEC subpoena Nov. 8 that Ms. Temple =
sent Houston a memo advising all employees to preserve all Enron-related do=
cuments.=20
Asked why she waited so long, Ms. Temple said it was company policy to send=
 out such advisories whenever a subpoena was received. Otherwise, Ms. Templ=
e and Mr. Andrews testified, account executives -- in this case, Mr. Duncan=
 -- are expected to make reasonable judgments. "The responsibility for that=
 rests with the engagement partner," Mr. Andrews said.=20
"I never counseled any destruction or shredding of documents," Ms. Temple t=
estified. "And I only wish that someone had raised the question so that we =
could have consulted and addressed the situation."=20
Rep. Billy Tauzin, chairman of the full committee, urged Andersen to recons=
ider its policy of leaving such matters to auditors. "If all your policies =
are to let accountants decide when it is legal to destroy documents in a pe=
nding investigation, an awful lot of people are going to be in trouble down=
 the road," he said. "If you don't change it, I promise you, we will."

October memo warned of 'heightened risk' of fraud=20
Firm draws fire for delay before halt of shredding=20
Compiled from staff and wire reports=20
Jan. 25, 2002, 9:10AM
WASHINGTON (Houston Chronicle) -- Some officials at Arthur Andersen were wo=
rried about a "heightened risk" of fraud in Enron's books a week before the=
 energy company shocked stockholders with huge losses, an auditor's memo fr=
om last October shows.=20
The e-mail by Andersen auditor Mark Zajac warned that a computer analysis o=
f Enron's financial activities in the third quarter of last year indicated =
"a red alert: a heightened risk of financial statement fraud," according to=
 investigators.=20
The document, released by Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., added to mounting evi=
dence that Enron's outside accounting firm had strong misgivings about Enro=
n business practices.=20
"We have considerable rascality," Dingell, ranking Democrat on the House Co=
mmerce Committee, summed up today on CBS's The Early Show. "We have to find=
 out who is at fault for what."=20
But a House hearing Thursday into the Enron Corp. collapse left lawmakers s=
till certain of only one thing: Thousands of documents were destroyed by En=
ron's blue-ribbon accounting firm.=20
Questions about who ordered the shredding, and whether it was intended to s=
tifle government investigations, were left unresolved after a Commerce subc=
ommittee concluded its first public hearing into the largest and perhaps mo=
st devastating bankruptcy in history.=20
A week after the "red alert" memo, Enron reported a $638 million third-quar=
ter loss and disclosed a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity, part=
ly because of hidden debt built up by a complex web of partnerships.=20
On the same day that Zajac wrote his memo to the head of the Enron auditing=
 team, Andersen also hired a law firm in anticipation of possible lawsuits =
involving Enron, the Houston-based energy giant that spiraled into bankrupt=
cy Dec. 2.=20
Andersen played down the significance of the computer analysis. And Zajac i=
n the memo acknowledged the system produces "false alarms."=20
Lawmakers on Thursday ferociously criticized Arthur Andersen for waiting we=
eks after a federal investigation was under way before halting in-house des=
truction of Enron documents. Andersen executives in turn tried to blame fir=
ed auditor David Duncan for sole responsibility in the shredding -- a claim=
 met with skepticism by House inquisitors.=20
Duncan, denied immunity by the House Energy and Commerce Committee, appeare=
d briefly before the subcommittee on oversight and investigations, where he=
 twice invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.=20
"Mr. Duncan, Enron robbed the bank, Arthur Andersen provided the getaway ca=
r, and they say you were at the wheel," said Rep. Jim Greenwood, R-Pa., aft=
er Duncan took his seat at the witness table.=20
A tense-looking Duncan, flanked by his lawyers, informed the committee he w=
ouldn't be answering any questions.=20
"I would like to answer the committee's questions, but on the advice of my =
counsel I respectfully decline to answer the question based on the protecti=
on afforded me under the Constitution of the United States," Duncan said.=
=20
The exchange kicked off a new round of congressional hearings into the coll=
apse of Enron and the involvement of its former auditors at Andersen.=20
On the other side of Capitol Hill, the Senate Governmental Affairs Committe=
e was hearing from former SEC officials and academic experts on whether Enr=
on's troubles should have been spotted earlier and how to strengthen curren=
t safeguards.=20
The two panels are among at least nine looking into various aspects of what=
 lawmakers are calling the Enron debacle.=20
The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Labor Department also are in=
vestigating, and the Justice Department has opened a criminal probe.=20
At the House subcommittee hearing, lawmakers repeatedly grilled Andersen at=
torney Nancy Temple about why she waited until Nov. 10 to instruct employee=
s to start saving Enron documents.=20
As early as Oct. 9, Andersen had hired an outside law firm in anticipation =
of possible litigation in the Enron matter, lawmakers said.=20
Enron's highly public financial free fall began Oct. 15, when the company r=
eported more than $600 million in quarterly losses and a $1.2 billion reduc=
tion in shareholder equity.=20
Enron also had disclosed as early as Oct. 22 that the SEC was probing its b=
ooks.=20
Gesturing dramatically and thumping his desk in the hearing room, Rep. W. J=
. "Billy" Tauzin, R-La., chair of the committee, asked Temple why she was s=
ilent for so long about the need to preserve documents.=20
"I never counseled any shredding or destruction of documents. I only wish s=
omeone had raised the question," Temple said.=20
Tauzin fired back, "Does anybody have to raise it, or is it somebody's resp=
onsibility in the company to raise it themselves? Whose responsibility is i=
t but yours?"=20
Andersen fired Duncan last week, saying he had organized a massive destruct=
ion of Enron documents beginning Oct. 23.=20
C.E. Andrews, an Andersen global managing partner who also appeared before =
the committee, said it was Duncan's responsibility to protect the documents=
.=20
"I cannot say it more strongly, Mr. Duncan was not following company policy=
. Mr. Duncan was violating company policy," Andrews said.=20
The claim, echoed by other Andersen witnesses, drew fresh scorn from Tauzin=
, who questioned why such a sensitive legal issue was left to an accountant=
.=20
"I hope you're all OK, I don't know," Tauzin warned, referring to the legal=
 ramifications the testimony raised. "I don't know what's going to come out=
 of all this."=20
Several lawmakers said they suspect Andersen is making a scapegoat of Dunca=
n, when it appears many employees may have been involved in destroying Enro=
n documents.=20
In an internal, Oct. 24 Andersen document the committee released Thursday, =
a manager instructs staff to use overtime if necessary in complying with th=
e company's policy, which at the time called for destruction of all but the=
 final auditing documents.=20
Noting that retaining documents is largely a passive act, Greenwood asked w=
hy complying with the Andersen policy would require staff to use overtime.=
=20
"If the emphasis is on retaining documents, it doesn't seem to us that a wh=
ole lot of overtime is required," Greenwood said.=20
Tauzin added that investigators believe documents may have been destroyed b=
y Andersen in both the Houston and Chicago offices.=20
Andersen, which is rewriting its policy on document retention, called a hal=
t to the destruction of Enron materials on Nov. 10, the day after the SEC s=
ubpoenaed the auditing firm.=20
"My mother would say your policy was dumb like a fox," Greenwood told the A=
ndersen executives.=20
Dorsey Baskin, managing director for Andersen, said the firm took decisive =
steps to remedy the issues surrounding the document shredding.=20
"We certainly are not proud of the document destruction, but we are proud o=
f our decision to step forward and accept responsibility," Baskin told the =
committee.=20
Although the committee had originally subpoenaed Andersen CEO Joseph Berard=
ino, they accepted Baskin as a substitute to answer questions about company=
wide policy and the firm's response to the Enron crisis.=20
Subpoenas also were issued to Temple and Andersen manager Michael Odom, whi=
ch investigators said would give them legal cover in the event of future li=
tigation involving Enron.=20
Odom, an Andersen employee since 1969, was moved out of management duties i=
n Houston the day Duncan was fired. Odom told lawmakers Andersen officials =
didn't specify why he, Odom, was being disciplined.=20
"I asked what the reason was and I was told the firm felt it had to make so=
me bold moves to restore confidence in the Houston community," Odom said.=
=20
Rep. Gene Green, D-Houston, a member of the committee, told lawmakers that =
Enron's collapse had devastated the city.=20
Hearing the stories of former employees, "literally, the tears would come t=
o your eyes," Green said. "Clearly the insiders knew what was going on."=20
Lawmakers in the coming weeks will be expanding the probe of document destr=
uction, and also looking at the financial and other problems that brought a=
bout Enron's historic collapse.=20
Several said that changes in the law or federal regulations may result from=
 various issues illuminated through testimony.=20
It was unclear whether any of the four who testified Thursday would return =
for more questioning when hearings resume in the House committee next month=
.=20
Duncan's request for immunity from prosecution is not likely to be granted =
by the committee, since it could later impair the Justice Department's ongo=
ing criminal probe.=20
Duncan, who also was subpoenaed by the committee, began cooperating with Ho=
use investigators the day after he was fired from Andersen. Since then, his=
 immunity request has cast a chill on his relationship with investigators.=
=20
Greenwood complained that Duncan's ongoing silence could impede the committ=
ee's work -- including unraveling the mysteries surrounding the fired audit=
or.=20
"I still haven't made up my mind on whether Mr. Duncan was a rogue employee=

Enron Hid Losses, Ex-Worker Says Energy: Manager warned executives $500-mil=
lion deficit was attributed to another unit to create illusion of profit.
LEE ROMNEY and WALTER HAMILTON
TIMES STAFF WRITERS

A former Enron Corp. manager warned top company brass in August that more t=
han $500 million in losses from the firm's energy services unit were being =
hidden in another division so the unit could misleadingly report profit to =
Wall Street, a copy of her e-mail reveals.=20
The allegations by former employee Margaret Ceconi were made in an Aug. 29 =
e-mail to Chairman Kenneth L. Lay, who Wednesday resigned from the empire h=
e built.
Ceconi's e-mail apparently wasn't connected to another whistle-blower memo =
sent by Vice President Sherron S. Watkins to Lay in mid-August.=20
Although Watkins warned that losses hidden in off-balance-sheet partnership=
s could cause Enron to "implode in a wave of accounting scandals," Ceconi's=
 concerns focused on the juggling of losses within Enron units. A copy of h=
er e-mail was obtained by The Times.=20
According to Ceconi, whose allegations were reported Thursday in the Housto=
n Chronicle, losses of more than $500 million were transferred from Enron E=
nergy Services to Enron Wholesale Services--the firm's lucrative trading un=
it--in a financial sleight of hand to deceive investors and analysts.=20
Until last spring, the energy services unit was co-headed by Thomas E. Whit=
e Jr., who now is Army Secretary. He could not be reached for comment Thurs=
day.=20
"EES has knowingly misrepresented EES' earnings," Ceconi wrote. "This is co=
mmon knowledge among all the EES employees, and is actually joked about. Bu=
t it should be taken seriously."=20
Ceconi wrote the e-mail--a rambling memo in which she lashes out at Enron m=
anagement--after she was fired from EES. She complains in the memo that she=
 was "fraudulently" recruited with misleading information about EES and the=
n unfairly let go.=20
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer could not be reached Thursday. In the Chronicle=
 he characterized Ceconi as a "disgruntled" employee, but would not comment=
 on the specifics of her memo.=20
Ceconi could not be reached for comment. But her attorney, Demetrios Anaipa=
kos, said her concerns about the accounting practices outweighed her person=
al beefs with Enron. "She felt that EES was being portrayed as a money-maki=
ng operation when it was exactly the opposite," he said.=20
EES provided energy services to commercial and industrial firms, promising =
them predictable long-term energy supplies and improved energy efficiency. =
Enron touted the unit as having huge growth potential.=20
According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Enron re=
vamped the EES unit last year, moving some commodity "risk-management activ=
ities" to the Wholesale unit.=20
As part of the restructuring, Enron restated its second-quarter 2000 result=
s for EES. Originally, the unit had revenue of $840 million and operating i=
ncome of $24 million. After the restatement, revenue was cut in half to $42=
0 million, but profit almost doubled to $46 million.=20
The restructuring could have been "an attempt to move a money-losing operat=
ion into a segment that was more profitable," said Randy Beatty, dean of th=
e accounting school at USC, who reviewed the SEC document for The Times.=20
Some analysts said Enron repeatedly restructured operations to boost the fi=
nancial results of individual units. "They kept restructuring the business =
segments so they could shift earnings from one section to another," said Pr=
udential Securities analyst Carol Coale.=20
Accounting experts said companies can freely restructure their operations, =
thus altering the reporting of profits and losses. But, said William Kinney=
, an accounting professor at the University of Texas in Austin, such reorga=
nizations should be done for valid business purposes, not just to "move thi=
ngs around."=20
"It's subject to abuse if you're trying to hide bad performance," Kinney sa=
id. But proving intent is difficult, he said.=20
Anaipakos said Ceconi, who left a senior job at GE Capital to join Enron in=
 late 2000, received a call from someone in human resources after she sent =
the e-mail. "She was told her allegations were being taken seriously, [but]=
 I can say she never heard from them again," he said.=20
Ceconi, now employed by a Houston consulting firm, also contacted the SEC b=
y phone twice in August and September to voice her concerns, Anaipakos said=
.=20
"Some would say the house of cards [is] falling," Ceconi wrote in the e-mai=
l to Lay, which also complained of favoritism and discrimination at the com=
pany.=20
"You have to decide the moral or ethical things to do, to right the wrongs =
of your various management teams. I wish you luck."

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: SELLING ENERGY
Ex-Workers Say Unit's Earnings Were 'Illusory'
By ALEX BERENSON

01/25/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 5
c. 2002 New York Times Company

A major division of the Enron Corporation overstated its profits by hundred=
s of millions of dollars over the last three years, and senior Enron execut=
ives were warned almost a year ago that the division's profits were illusor=
y, according to several former employees.=20
The division, Enron Energy Services, competed with utilities to sell electr=
icity and natural gas to commercial and industrial customers. It was run by=
 Lou L. Pai, who sold $353 million in Enron stock over the last three years=
, more than any other Enron executive, and Thomas E. White, who left Enron =
to become secretary of the Army last June.
Energy Services accounted for a small part of Enron's revenue but was promo=
ted by the company as a big growth opportunity. Unlike the complex partners=
hips and other entities that Enron used to move debt and losses on outside =
investments off its books, this unit was a real business with more than 1,0=
00 employees and customers like J. C. Penney.=20
But former employees, including three who were willing to be identified, su=
ggest that Energy Services used shoddy accounting practices to create ''ill=
usory earnings,'' in the words of Jeff Gray, who joined Enron in 2000 and w=
orked at the division for most of 2001.=20
For example, by estimating that the price of electricity would fall in the =
future, Enron could book an immediate profit on a contract.=20
The employees' allegations raise fresh questions about Mr. White's role at =
Enron, where he was an executive for 11 years. In a disclosure last May, ju=
st before he became Army secretary, Mr. White reported that he owned more t=
han $25 million of Enron stock and would be paid $1 million in severance fr=
om Enron.=20
Because he went from the Army to Enron and back to the Army, Public Citizen=
 and others have voiced concerns about potential conflicts. While he was at=
 Energy Services, it sold a $25 million contract to the Army. As secretary,=
 he said that he would move energy services at bases to private companies, =
like Enron.=20
A spokesman for Mr. White did not return repeated calls for comment. Mr. Pa=
i, the former chairman, and a spokesman for Enron also did not return calls=
. Peggy Mahoney, a spokeswoman for Energy Services, said the division's fin=
ancial results had accurately reflected its business. ''It was no pie in th=
e sky,'' she said.=20
Enron created Energy Services in 1997 to take advantage of the deregulation=
 of electricity markets nationally. It promised to cut its clients' energy =
costs by installing energy-saving equipment and finding cheaper natural gas=
 and electricity.=20
Energy Services operated as essentially a freestanding company, but its res=
ults were included in Enron's financial statements, which were audited by A=
rthur Andersen. Energy Services organized itself so that it could use a fin=
ancial reporting technique called mark-to-market accounting, which Mr. Gray=
 and other former employees said the division had abused to inflate its pro=
fits.=20
Under traditional accounting, companies book profits only as they deliver t=
he services they have promised to customers. But Energy Services calculated=
 its profit very differently. As soon as it signed a contract, it estimated=
 what its profits would be over the entire term, based on assumptions about=
 future energy prices, energy use and even the speed at which different sta=
tes would deregulate their electric markets.=20
Then Energy Services would immediately pay its sales representatives cash b=
onuses on those projections and report the results to investors as profits.=
 By making its assumptions more optimistic, the division could report highe=
r profits.=20
As a result, the sales representatives and senior managers pressed the mana=
gers who made the central assumptions about deregulation and energy prices,=
 said Glenn Dickson, a manager at Energy Services who was fired in December=
.=20
''The whole culture was much more sales driven than anything else,'' Mr. Di=
ckson said. ''The people that were having to sign off on the deals with a g=
un to their head knew that it wasn't a good deal.''=20
Mr. Dickson and other former employees said senior executives at Energy Ser=
vices knew that their assumptions were unreliable. At the same time, expens=
es ballooned as Energy Services found that the costs of managing its contra=
cts were higher than it had projected.=20
''They knew how to get a product out there, but they didn't know how to run=
 a business,'' said Tony Dorazio, a former product development manager at E=
nergy Services.=20
In 1999 and 2000, under the leadership of Mr. Pai and Mr. White, Energy Ser=
vices would sign almost any deal, a former employee said. But by the end of=
 2000, the executives were no longer paying much attention to daily operati=
ons, Mr. Dickson said.=20
None of the former employees said they knew whether Mr. Pai or Mr. White we=
re aware of any accounting lapses at Energy Services. With Energy Services =
hemorrhaging cash in 2000, even as it began to report profits to investors,=
 the unit began reviewing some of the contacts to determine whether it had =
overstated its profits. But publicly, Enron continued to promote Energy Ser=
vices' prospects. A year ago, Jeffrey K. Skilling, Enron's president at the=
 time, told Wall Street that the division was worth about $20 billion.=20
''They said at one point they expected it to be as large as wholesale,'' sa=
id Jeff Dietert, an analyst at Simmons & Company in Houston. Enron's wholes=
ale trading division, which bought and sold electricity and natural gas wor=
ldwide, was the source of most of its profits.=20
The division generated $165 million in operating profit on $4.6 billion in =
sales in 2000, in contrast to a loss of $68 million on sales of $1.8 billio=
n in 1999, according to Enron's 2000 annual report.=20
Even as Enron promoted the division's potential, it accelerated its review =
of the contracts and brought in new management. By February 2001, Enron had=
 transferred Mr. Pai out of the division and named David Delaney, who came =
from the wholesale business, as its top executive. A former brigadier gener=
al, Mr. White remained until he became secretary of the Army.=20
A former employee said that in February or March 2001, senior managers with=
in Energy Services spoke to Richard A. Causey, Enron's chief accounting off=
icer, to discuss potential losses associated with a handful of large contra=
cts. The potential losses on those deals topped $200 million, the employee =
said.=20
About the same time, Mr. Delaney discussed the potential losses with Mr. Sk=
illing and other top corporate executives, this employee said.=20
Sales slowed last year as Mr. Delaney forced the division to use more conse=
rvative and accurate projections when deciding on a contract, Mr. Dickson s=
aid. The move frustrated some sales representatives, but stemmed losses, he=
 said.=20
Although Energy Services publicly reported profits until Enron collapsed, i=
t continued to lose money last year because of the unprofitable contracts, =
employees said.=20
Margaret Ceconi, a former sales manager, sent a letter in August to Kenneth=
 L. Lay, then Enron's chairman, saying that Enron had hidden losses on its =
contracts by putting them in the wholesale division.=20
''It will add up to over $500 million that E.E.S. is losing and trying to h=
ide in wholesale,'' Ms. Ceconi wrote in her letter, which was previously re=
ported in The Houston Chronicle.=20
Today, Energy Services is essentially a shell. After filing for bankruptcy =
Dec. 2, Enron walked away from many contracts, an action allowed under bank=
ruptcy rules.=20
Energy Services' decision to exit so many contracts, including its largest,=
 a $2.2 billion contract signed only last year with Owens-Illinois, the gia=
nt glass and plastic maker, is proof of the problems at the division, forme=
r employees said.=20
''They kept telling me, and I heard it many a time, that it was a sound bus=
iness plan,'' Mr. Dorazio said. ''After being in this business for 21 years=
, it didn't seem sound to me.''

House members probing the sudden demise of Enron Corp. pressed executives a=
t the company's auditor, Arthur Andersen, yesterday on why they didn't do m=
ore to preserve Enron audit documents last fall, after they learned that fe=
deral regulators were investigating the energy trader's finances.=20
Lawmakers cited an e-mail showing that an Andersen official in October had =
urged auditors on the Enron account in Houston to work "overtime" to follow=
 the company's rules on document retention and destruction. The e-mail did =
not specifically say to retain documents. One committee member said he inte=
rpreted the memo as a veiled suggestion to destroy documents.
Another Andersen document said a computer analysis of Enron financial activ=
ity showed that the company warranted a "red alert" of possible fraud. It w=
as dated Oct. 9, a week before Enron announced a large loss.=20
Andersen officials played down the significance of the fraud warning, sayin=
g later that the software was unreliable.=20
The Andersen witnesses staunchly defended the firm's actions, saying they s=
ent out a detailed reminder to preserve documents as soon as the big accoun=
ting firm received a subpoena in November. They blamed the shredding on Dav=
id B. Duncan, the lead Enron auditor, who was fired last week.=20
Duncan, citing the advice of his attorney, declined three times to answer q=
uestions in a brief appearance before the committee. He invoked his Fifth A=
mendment privilege against self incrimination.=20
"Mr. Duncan, Enron robbed the bank," said Rep. James C. Greenwood (R-Pa.), =
chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's subcommittee on overs=
ight and investigations. "Arthur Andersen provided the getaway car. And the=
y say you were at the wheel."=20
Greenwood questioned after the hearing whether Duncan was "a villain or a s=
capegoat."=20
C.E. Andrews, a global managing partner at Andersen, tried to deflect respo=
nsibility from others at the accounting firm. "Destruction of documents dur=
ing that period was wrong, and we admitted that," he said. "I cannot say mo=
re strongly Mr. Duncan was not following company policy."=20
Andrews acknowledged that others at Andersen also destroyed Enron-related d=
ocuments, although he said the volume and circumstances were different.=20
Andrews said the document policy was later suspended because it was not cle=
ar enough. It was dropped Jan. 10 when Andersen first announced that some o=
f its employees had destroyed Enron-related documents.=20
As House lawmakers sought to determine exactly what Andersen knew about the=
 shredding -- and when the firm knew it -- Federal Reserve Board Chairman A=
lan Greenspan made pointed statements about the potential impact of Enron's=
 accounting practices in an appearance before the Senate Budget Committee.=
=20
A visibly passionate Greenspan said that if "everybody did what is alleged =
in the Enron accounting system, our [economic] system could not work" becau=
se investors have to be able to rely on the information they receive. He re=
ferred to Enron's use of off-balance-sheet partnerships to conceal a large =
amount of corporate debt as "an egregious act."=20
While saying that he is not worried that Enron's collapse will hinder inves=
tment in U.S. companies or cause interest rates to rise, he said the case "=
is going to create a really major rethinking in a lot of people about wheth=
er there is a spin game going on with respect to information coming out of =
business into the investment community."=20
An Enron hearing before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee also took=
 a broader view of the issues raised by the nation's largest bankruptcy. Se=
n. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), chairman of the committee, said his panel=
's examination will include questions about whether industry regulators and=
 agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission tracked Enron's ac=
tivity closely enough. "And if not, why not?" Lieberman added.=20
One Senate witness, former SEC chairman Arthur Levitt Jr., chided an array =
of people, including analysts, rating agencies and government regulators, f=
or failing to do enough to prevent the Enron debacle.=20
"Enron's collapse did not occur in a vacuum," Levitt said, adding that it w=
as partly a result of a "culture of gamesmanship" among go-go businesses th=
at believe "it's okay to bend the rules."=20
Yesterday's hearings were part of nearly a dozen congressional investigatio=
ns into Enron's collapse and allegations that it misled investors and, alon=
g with Andersen, tried to hide questionable business practices.=20
The Justice Department is investigating Andersen's document destruction as =
part of its criminal probe of Enron's collapse. In Houston yesterday, FBI a=
gents were inside Enron's headquarters investigating the shredding of docum=
ents there, which was disclosed earlier this week.=20
In remarks after the four-hour House hearing, Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-L=
a.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said more people =
than previously disclosed knew about document destruction by Andersen, "per=
haps in Chicago," at the company's headquarters.=20
Greenwood scoffed at the idea of Andersen employees working overtime to uph=
old the document-retention policy. "It doesn't seem to us it takes a lot of=
 overtime to retain documents," he said.=20
The testy House session demonstrated the complexity, disagreement and postu=
ring that are quickly coming to characterize the widening investigations of=
 Enron's fall.=20
Lawmakers from both parties have pledged to examine how the energy trader c=
ollapsed, the allegations of corporate fraud and coverups, and the impact o=
n thousands of investors who lost billions of dollars when Enron's share pr=
ice dropped to less than a dollar in recent months.=20
Greenwood opened the House subcommittee hearing by calling it "just the fir=
st step in a thorough and rigorous investigation." He and other panel membe=
rs were aggressive in their questioning -- and openly skeptical of the resp=
onses of Andersen executives.=20
A focus of much of the questioning was the role of Nancy Temple, an Anderse=
n lawyer who wrote an Oct. 12 memo that she said was meant to remind Duncan=
 and others about the company's policy, which calls for the retention of so=
me documents and the destruction of others. Temple told lawmakers her memo =
was not intended as a directive to shred documents.=20
The 35-page policy statement said that under normal circumstances, employee=
s were to retain only final work papers supporting client audits, and to th=
row out drafts, but that if litigation was anticipated, all documents were =
to be retained. In her testimony, Temple said she meant employees to unders=
tand that they were to retain documents.=20
"Your memo was interpreted, as you know, as a shredding order," said Rep. E=
dward J. Markey (D-Mass.). Duncan's attorneys say he interpreted it to mean=
 he should destory Enron-related documents.=20
Temple's testimony also revealed that she contacted Andersen's outside lega=
l advisers, Davis Polk & Wardwell, before sending an Oct. 16 e-mail to Dunc=
an asking that he delete her name and other references to legal advice from=
 a memo he had written about potentially misleading statements in an Enron =
news release about its earnings.=20
She said the outside lawyers recommended she do that so that if Andersen wa=
s sued or investigated over its Enron auditing, discussions between Duncan,=
 Temple and other lawyers would be protected by attorney-client privilege.=
=20
Andrews said Davis Polk had been retained by Arthur Andersen on Oct. 9 beca=
use of "potential litigation" stemming from Enron's troublesome financial s=
tatements.=20
Tauzin and other lawmakers yesterday questioned why Andersen's general coun=
sel or compliance officer didn't issue clear instructions that day about pr=
eserving documents.=20
Temple said she e-mailed an explicit directive to preserve Enron audit docu=
ments on Nov. 10, in response to a subpoena the company had received two da=
ys earlier from the SEC. Temple said she called Duncan directly the day bef=
ore to underscore the message. After that call, Duncan's assistant sent out=
 an e-mail to other secretaries in the Houston office saying "no more shred=
ding."=20
Among the questions Duncan would not answer yesterday was why, if he though=
t the Oct. 12 memo was a directive to destroy documents, he waited 11 days =
to accelerate the process.=20
Temple also told lawmakers about a Sept. 28 telephone conversation among An=
dersen partners to discuss Enron and the possibility of problems and errors=
 in the company's past financial statements. She said one partner brought u=
p the idea of deleting a sentence acknowledging that the firm had given inc=
orrect accounting advice. She testified that she told the partners they sho=
uldn't do that.=20
Tauzin said he is troubled that an accounting partner at Andersen would eve=
n suggest such a thing, and that Temple didn't seem surprised by it, even t=
hough "she did the right thing" by forbidding it.=20
Tauzin said "the clear picture we're getting at this hearing is that somebo=
dy felt it was a good idea to get rid of an awful lot of documents . . . an=
d it's not a pretty one."=20

Judge OKs depositions on shredding=20
Order for 6 includes fired Andersen auditor=20
By ROSANNA RUIZ=20
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle=20
Jan. 24, 2002, 8:59PM
A federal judge has approved an order allowing attorneys for Enron stockhol=
ders to take depositions from one former and five current employees of the =
company's auditing firm concerning document destruction.=20
This settles a dispute raised by defense attorneys who asked to delay the p=
rocess, mainly because their clients are facing inquiries from so many inve=
stigations.=20
U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon's order, issued late Wednesday, states t=
hat depositions may begin after Arthur Andersen completes its internal repo=
rt about the shredding of Enron-related documents. The report is due within=
 three weeks.=20
"We're glad we persisted. We're glad we prevailed," said Bill Lerach, a San=
 Diego attorney representing Amalgamated Bank. "We look forward to taking t=
he testimony under oath of the officials at Andersen who destroyed document=
s."=20
The New York-based bank is one of several plaintiffs suing Andersen and 29 =
former and current Enron executives and board members. The suit alleges the=
 insiders were aware of accounting problems that led to Enron's inflated ea=
rnings and higher stock prices.=20
Rusty Hardin, attorney for the accounting firm, opposed allowing deposition=
s of David Duncan, the lead auditor fired by Andersen last week; four Ander=
sen employees on administrative leave, and Andersen's in-house attorney, Na=
ncy Temple. Hardin argued that the depositions might interfere with investi=
gations by Congress, the departments of Labor and Justice and the Securitie=
s and Exchange Commission.=20
The four Andersen employees placed on administrative leave -- Thomas H. Bau=
er, Michael Lowther, Michael Odom and Stephen Goddard Jr. -- must also answ=
er plaintiffs attorneys' questions about the shredding or deletion of Enron=
 documents.=20
"We hoped those depositions would be put off because those people are being=
 pulled in so many directions. But we don't have any problems with the orde=
r," Hardin said.=20
Duncan, identified by Andersen as the organizer of the unauthorized destruc=
tion of Enron documents when the SEC began its investigation, invoked his F=
ifth Amendment privilege Thursday before the House Energy and Commerce Comm=
ittee. He may do the same when he is deposed.=20
Temple, based in Chicago, will be deposed about an ambiguous Oct. 12 e-mail=
 she wrote regarding the company's document-retention policy.=20
During her appearance before the House panel Thursday, Temple denied that t=
he e-mail advised Andersen employees to destroy any documents.=20
Hardin said he could not predict whether Duncan or the others would provide=
 answers during the depositions. That decision, he said, rests with them an=
d their attorneys.=20
"I thought the plaintiffs would have a better chance of getting detailed in=
formation if they waited a while, but they didn't want to," Hardin said.=20
Lerach argued this week that the depositions ought to be taken now while me=
mories are fresh.=20
Harmon's order states that each deposition will last up to eight hours and =
cover only the "document and data retention, storage, removal, deletion and=
 attempts to restore or recover deleted or destroyed materials. No document=
s need be produced in connection with these depositions."=20
The six may also be deposed at a later date about the document destruction.=
=20
Andersen must allow experts hired by the plaintiffs' attorneys an opportuni=
ty to evaluate the company's efforts to recover or reconstruct Enron-relate=
d documents that were destroyed or deleted.=20
The plaintiffs' attorneys will also be given access to Andersen's document-=
storage facilities to ensure appropriate security measures are in place.=20

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE CHAIRMAN
An Optimist Sees the Chaos Become Surreal Spectacle
By JIM YARDLEY

The New York Times

c. 2002 New York Times Company

HOUSTON, Jan. 24 -- In the last days before his resignation, Kenneth L. Lay=
 was up there on the 50th floor, above the city that once lionized him, a f=
allen king barricaded atop his silver tower. Mr. Lay, a friend said, had hi=
red a security guard to protect himself against death threats. Employees go=
ssiped that he arrived by private car in the loading dock and was whisked t=
o his office on a freight elevator, all to avoid attention.=20
He must have struggled to recognize the new, chaotic world below. His compa=
ny, Enron, had collapsed. His days, according to another friend, were fille=
d with lawyers. His pal, the president of the United States, who had once r=
eferred to him affectionately as Kenny Boy, complained that his mother-in-l=
aw had taken a bath on Enron stock.
The Rev. Al Sharpton showed up calling for justice. The Rev. Jesse Jackson,=
 who in November shared a private prayer with Mr. Lay, returned this evenin=
g in the midst of the crisis. That Mr. Lay merited the ministrations of Mr.=
 Jackson, who is known to gravitate toward catastrophe, was only one indica=
tion of the surreal spectacle that his precipitous fall had become.=20
''I do not think he's ever had a failure,'' said Bonnie Bourne, his older s=
ister, who lives in Columbia, Mo. ''My father was eternally optimistic. I s=
ee that in Ken: things are going to work out. And it has."=20
Until now. By stepping down Wednesday evening, Mr. Lay ends his tenure as E=
nron's chairman and chief executive and begins his new career -- that of a =
defendant in lawsuits, a witness before Congressional committees and a pote=
ntial target of criminal investigations. The questions now facing Mr. Lay a=
bout Enron's partnerships and accounting practices represent the ultimate W=
ashington endgame: what did he know, when did he know it and did he betray =
the trust of his employees and shareholders?=20
Mr. Lay, 59, gathered top Enron executives and employees in a conference ro=
om on Wednesday to deliver the news that he was leaving the company, just a=
s he had earlier told Enron's board via a conference call. He had been aske=
d to resign by the court-appointed creditors committee, but he had floated =
the idea himself as far back as November when the company was negotiating i=
ts failed merger with its energy rival, Dynegy.=20
''When the Dynegy deal was taking place,'' said Thomas A. Roberts, a lawyer=
 for Enron in New York who is serving as a liaison to the creditor's commit=
tee, ''he at that point thought if his presence as an officer of the compan=
y was going to cause a problem, he would consider resigning.''=20
Mr. Lay had been thinking about resigning, on his own terms, even before En=
ron's troubles emerged.=20
In August, when his hand-picked successor, Jeffrey K. Skilling, unexpectedl=
y resigned as chief executive, Mr. Lay, then only the chairman, had told fr=
iends and family that he was easing toward retirement. But Mr. Skilling's a=
brupt departure, coupled with the steady decline in the company's stock pri=
ce, prompted Mr. Lay to reassume the chief executive position.=20
''He came home for a family reunion in August,'' Ms. Bourne said. ''Skillin=
g had just resigned. I said, 'I thought you were ready to get a boat and ta=
ke to the sea.' And he said, 'Well, not yet.' "=20
Mr. Lay called a meeting of employees on Aug. 16, two days after Mr. Skilli=
ng's departure, and was greeted with a standing ovation. For many Enron emp=
loyees, the unpretentious, folksy Mr. Lay represented the moral ballast of =
a company that they felt had spiraled out of control. He was a former chair=
man of the local United Way; a branch of the Y.M.C.A. was named after him.=
=20
Even today, some workers who have lost their jobs refuse to blame Mr. Lay.=
=20
''He had an almost cultish following,'' said one Enron executive who was am=
ong the more than 4,000 workers laid off on Dec. 3, the day after the compa=
ny filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.=20
But Mr. Lay could not work miracles, and a string of recent disclosures hav=
e raised questions. He said in August that questions about the partnerships=
 used to inflate profits were ''way over my head,'' yet that same month he =
met with a vice president who detailed her concerns.=20
At the same time that Mr. Lay was learning about these potential problems, =
he was encouraging employees to buy more Enron stock and reassuring them th=
at the company would rebound. He continued to sell shares himself in Septem=
ber and October, a decision his lawyer has attributed not to a lack of conf=
idence in his company but to pressure to pay off millions of dollars in loa=
ns.=20
Either way, Mr. Lay's legacy is more than tarnished for many employees. Fir=
ed employees have printed T-shirts that read ''Layd Off,'' and howled after=
 the company paid $55 million in retention bonuses while giving a $4,500 se=
verance to those who were let go. The retirement funds of many employees ha=
ve been wiped out.=20
''It's clear to people with Enron that the paternal figure he represented -=
- that died a long time ago,'' said the executive who was among those laid =
off. ''He should have left last year.''=20
Those who have spent time with Mr. Lay say he has expressed frustration but=
 not anger. Mr. Jackson said that when he met with Mr. Lay in November: ''W=
hen I did talk with him, and did have prayer with him, he seemed to be daze=
d by all these revelations. He seemed unaware of what all had happened.''=
=20
Robert Mosbacher, the former secretary of commerce who served on Enron's bo=
ard during the 1980's, said he spoke briefly with Mr. Lay before Christmas.=
 ''It was sort of a little telephone hug to say, 'I'm sorry,' '' said Mr. M=
osbacher, who initiated the call. ''He didn't sound great, but I don't thin=
k you or I would be any better.''=20
Others checked in, too. Mr. Lay's friend and fund-raiser, Sue Walden, said =
she spoke with him on Tuesday about his frustrations with the press coverag=
e of Enron's collapse. He felt it was one-sided, she said, and ''he seemed =
very upset that any of his political ties and his friendship with the presi=
dent could be used to hurt the president.''=20
But few people talked with Mr. Lay as much as Mr. Roberts, the Enron lawyer=
 who is liaison to the creditor's committee. He said they often talked five=
 times a day.=20
He said Mr. Lay was usually upbeat and surprisingly optimistic, mentioning =
that he and his wife ''pray over this regularly.'' On Wednesday, Mr. Robert=
s listened to the conference call as Mr. Lay told the board of his resignat=
ion. He said Mr. Lay then broke the news to top executives and staff member=
s.=20
Later, after the news was out publicly, Mr. Roberts said he called one fina=
l time, at 10:30 p.m. Eastern time. Mr. Lay, he said, told him, ''This has =
not been a good day.''=20
He is certain to face more of them.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE OVERVIEW
Enron Hearings Open, Focusing on Destroyed Papers
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. and STEPHEN LABATON

01/25/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 6
c. 2002 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON, Jan. 24 -- Lawmakers investigating the Enron Corporation said t=
oday that new evidence showed that the company's auditors, Arthur Andersen,=
 destroyed documents knowing that they might be relevant to criminal and ci=
vil investigations.=20
At a hearing this morning before a House subcommittee examining the collaps=
e of Enron, lawmakers heard evidence that two weeks before Andersen executi=
ves in Houston began destroying documents the accounting firm retained a la=
w firm to prepare to defend itself in cases that could arise from Enron's p=
roblems.
A document released by lawmakers also shows that on the same day the law fi=
rm was hired, Oct. 9, some Andersen officials were worried that there was a=
 ''heightened risk of financial statement fraud'' with Enron's books.=20
In addition, the subcommittee released copies of an e-mail message received=
 by Andersen employees a day after government regulators announced their in=
vestigation of Enron. Lawmakers said employees construed the message as a d=
irective to begin destroying records.=20
David B. Duncan, an Andersen partner until he was fired after acknowledging=
 that he took part in destruction of records, declined to respond to questi=
ons from House lawmakers, invoking his Fifth Amendment right against forced=
 self-incrimination. [Excerpts from Congressional hearings, Pages C8-9.]=20
The hearings brought together many elements of American political and econo=
mic life: the partisan battle over the proper role of government regulation=
, the bursting of the financial bubble of the 1990's and the quarrel over t=
he influence of money in politics.=20
And the sessions were yet another indication of the mounting impact on Wash=
ington of Enron's collapse, the largest corporate bankruptcy in history. Ev=
en as the White House spokesman, Ari Fleischer, argued that the company's c=
ollapse was a corporate scandal, not a political one, its political effects=
 were visible in Congress and at the White House.=20
Controversy over large political contributions from Enron helped House memb=
ers fighting to overhaul the nation's campaign finance laws to move their l=
egislation closer to a floor vote, with Mr. Fleischer saying a Bush veto wa=
s unlikely. All the attention focused on the millions donated by Enron to m=
embers of the two parties has intensified the pressure on Mr. Bush and othe=
r political leaders to back change.=20
There were other signs of how Enron's fortunes had intersected with politic=
s. Associates of Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's top political adviser, said he had r=
ecommended a lucrative consulting contract with Enron for Ralph Reed, the R=
epublican strategist, as Mr. Bush was weighing whether to run for president=
. The associates said the arrangement helped keep Mr. Reed's allegiance to =
the Bush campaign without putting him on any payroll.=20
A new computer analysis of campaign finance records showed that of the 248 =
senators and House members on the 11 Congressional committees that are inve=
stigating the Enron affair, 212 had received contributions from Enron or Ar=
thur Andersen. The donations from the two companies have been so pervasive =
that all the Senate's top 20 recipients of Enron donations are serving on a=
t least one panel investigating Enron. Because many lawmakers who accepted =
Enron donations were Democrats, the burgeoning scandal has created bipartis=
an discomfort.=20
Among those testifying today was Arthur Levitt, the former chairman of the =
Securities and Exchange Commission, who had tried with limited success to i=
mpose tough conflict-of-interest restraints on the accounting industry.=20
''Too many elements of the system are not trustworthy today,'' Mr. Levitt t=
old the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. ''They have failed us becaus=
e of self-dealing and self-interest.''=20
The House and Senate committees conducting today's hearings include members=
 who had beaten back earlier proposals for tougher conflict-of-interest rul=
es for auditors and who had supported legislation in the 1990's that made i=
t harder for investors to sue unethical accountants and easier for corporat=
ions to put out misleading financial projections.=20
Mr. Levitt proposed a number of changes to eliminate the possible conflicts=
 of interests of Wall Street analysts and accountants and make corporate bo=
ards more independent-minded. He also suggested the adoption of a new rule =
that required companies to change auditors every five to seven years ''to e=
nsure that fresh and skeptical eyes are always looking at the numbers.''=20
He also suggested that the recent proposals by his successor at the agency,=
 Harvey L. Pitt, were weak. Mr. Pitt, whose proposals have come under heavy=
 criticism since they were announced last week, has proposed that a group d=
ominated by outside experts should discipline the accounting industry.=20
Some lawmakers, including members who had received donations from Enron and=
 the accounting industry, said the collapse demonstrated the need for chang=
ing campaign finance laws.=20
''Because Enron has made substantial political contributions to members of =
Congress and the executive branch, some will question the independence in l=
aunching such an investigation,'' said Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the Con=
necticut Democrat who heads the Governmental Affairs Committee. ''There are=
 two things we in Congress can do to overcome that skepticism and rebuild p=
ublic trust: conduct completely independent investigations of Enron and pas=
s campaign finance reform.''=20
The committee's ranking Republican, Senator Fred Thompson of Tennessee, agr=
eed.=20
''We have an opportunity to do some good here on a bipartisan basis,'' Mr. =
Thompson said as he outlined issues raised by the scandal. ''In the process=
, we may even finally decide that allowing huge amounts of soft money contr=
ibutions to public officials is not such a good idea.''''=20
In the House hearing, Representative Billy Tauzin, the Louisiana Republican=
 who heads the the Energy and Commerce Committee, which will hold a hearing=
 on Feb. 6 focusing on Enron, said ''scores and scores'' of Andersen employ=
ees were engaged in document destruction.=20
''It's clear to us that our investigation, and other investigations, have b=
een impeded by this policy,'' he said.=20
The ranking Democrat on the committee, Representative John D. Dingell of Mi=
chigan, said Andersen's actions were ''either criminally stupid, or stupidl=
y criminal or both.''=20
Lawmakers said it appeared plain that senior Andersen officials were aware =
by early October, when the firm hired the law firm of Davis Polk & Wardwell=
, that lawsuits were possible, yet they did nothing to ensure that crucial =
documents were preserved, waiting until receiving a subpoena on Nov. 8 to i=
nstruct employees to ''stop the shredding.''=20
This was a major mistake, lawmakers said, and it contradicted recent commen=
ts by Andersen's chief executive, Joseph F. Berardino, who said Sunday on '=
'Meet the Press'' on NBC that Andersen's policy was ''not to shred document=
s, not to eliminate documents if you have a reasonable basis to anticipate =
an investigation.''=20
This morning, the first witness, Mr. Duncan, strode to the hearing table fl=
anked by his two lawyers, Robert Giuffra and Vince DiBlasi. Wearing a dark =
blue suit, Mr. Duncan, 42, rose and was sworn under oath, but he invoked hi=
s Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, and he was dismissed by=
 the subcommittee chairman, Representative James C. Greenwood, Republican o=
f Pennsylvania.=20
Mr. Greenwood said he was frustrated by Mr. Duncan's refusal to testify and=
 told him: ''Enron robbed the bank. Arthur Andersen provided the getaway ca=
r, and they say you were at the wheel.'' But speaking with reporters later,=
 Mr. Greenwood said he remained concerned that ''Mr. Duncan and others were=
 the fall guys'' for a firm that sanctioned document destruction when they =
knew litigation was likely.=20
Andersen officials at the hearing said Mr. Duncan orchestrated the shreddin=
g without direction from superiors, and a firm spokesman, Patrick Dorton, p=
layed down the timing of the hiring of the outside law firm. ''It would not=
 be unusual for this firm or any company to seek the advice of outside coun=
sel in a situation like this,'' Mr. Dorton said.=20
An Andersen spokesman dismissed the document that discussed the risk of ''f=
inancial statement fraud,'' saying it stemmed from an experimental computer=
 model Andersen was using that often registered false results.=20
In a statement after the hearing, Andersen said that it had ''deep regret f=
or the disturbing actions of several of its employees on the Enron engageme=
nt'' but that the testimony ''further demonstrates the firm's complete reso=
lve to learn the facts, make them known to the government and the public, a=
nd take every appropriate action against the individuals involved.''=20
Four Andersen officials testified today, but the committee saved its sharpe=
st questioning for Nancy Temple, a lawyer in the firm's Chicago office who =
by early October was working closely with Andersen partners in Houston who =

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE IMPACT
Bipartisan Outrage but Few Mea Culpas in Capital
By DON VAN NATTA Jr.

01/25/2002
The New York Times

c. 2002 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON, Jan. 25 -- The Enron scandal has grown so large that it took no=
t one but two hearings on Capitol Hill today for the politicians to begin s=
orting through the mess, while also carefully sidestepping their own role i=
n it.=20
Anyone who tried to watch or listen to both proceedings simultaneously hear=
d a bipartisan chorus of outrage about shredded documents and empty retirem=
ent accounts.
''Enron robbed the bank. Arthur Andersen provided the getaway car, and they=
 say you were at the wheel,'' Representative James C. Greenwood of Pennsylv=
ania, the Republican chairman of the House Energy Committee's subcommittee,=
 told David B. Duncan, the dismissed Arthur Andersen partner who led the ac=
counting firm's audit of Enron and who invoked his Fifth Amendment right to=
day against self-incrimination.=20
Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, said: ''When the corporate=
 insiders at Enron realized the ship was sinking, they grabbed the lifeboat=
s and left the women and children, their workers and investors, to drown.''=
=20
While politicians were quick to blame Enron's accountants for allowing the =
giant energy trading company to collapse, few on either panel were prepared=
 today to accept any blame for the role Congress played.=20
The White House, meanwhile, once again insisted today that the company's fa=
ilure was a business scandal -- not a political one.=20
White House officials adopted the stance of outraged victim and vengeful co=
p. ''Nothing is going to stop the president and this administration from pu=
rsuing justice,'' said Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman.=20
Vice President Dick Cheney continues to refuse to release a list of people =
who met with his energy task force last year, even though more senators hav=
e called for its release. Mary Matalin, a counselor to Mr. Cheney, said tod=
ay that the administration felt the list should be withheld to protect the =
participants' privacy.=20
On Capitol Hill, some of the members posing the toughest questions today ha=
d in earlier years voted for legislation that deregulated commodities marke=
ts. They also blocked several attempts to toughen accounting standards. Tho=
se decisions helped make it easier for Enron to escape the scrutiny of gove=
rnment regulators.=20
Several senators sitting on the Governmental Affairs Committee, like Senato=
r Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey, pressured the Securities an=
d Exchange Commission in 2000 to abandon a proposed rule that would have ba=
rred accounting firms from performing auditing and consulting work for the =
same client, as Andersen did for Enron. He was one of 13 senators who inter=
vened to quash the plan.=20
Yet Mr. Torricelli offered one of the day's only mea culpas. Addressing Art=
hur Levitt Jr., the former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commissi=
on who had pushed for the rule and testified today, Mr. Torricelli said: ''=
We were wrong. You were right.''=20
Both at the White House and in Congress, the message is simple: Punish thos=
e responsible for the Enron debacle, and do everything possible to make sur=
e another Enron does not happen. There is not much appetite on either end o=
f Pennsylvania Avenue for the news media or the public to dwell on any role=
 the legislative or executive branches may have played in creating an envir=
onment to allow Enron to flourish.=20
''After all of the sound and fury of these investigations, the bottom line =
questions are: Is Congress willing to amend the law to rein in the greed of=
 the next Enron?'' Mr. Durbin asked. ''Are we willing to concede that the g=
enius of capitalism can result in ruthless behavior without our oversight a=
nd the protection of law?''=20
Just as the White House has tried to avoid any political fallout from the E=
nron debacle, members of Congress have tried to escape any collateral damag=
e from the scandal. So the House Energy Committee resembled a bipartisan co=
rporate tribunal. Members acted as both prosecutors and judges and the accu=
sed, Arthur Andersen L.L.P., was left with almost no defense.=20
But many of the 11 House and Senate investigations into the scandal plan no=
t only on looking back, as was today's chore, but also on trying to draft l=
egislation that will prevent another Enron. Whether that includes the campa=
ign financing laws that have helped give the public the impression that man=
y legislators have been tainted by contributions from Enron or the accounti=
ng firms remains to be seen.=20
''They are going to hit the easy targets first and hit the easiest bad guys=
 first,'' said Larry Noble of the Center for Responsive Politics. ''But the=
y are going to have to deal with the tougher questions, too, about their ow=
n role in this.''=20
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, one Democrat who has come under=
 scrutiny for his role in accounting legislation, has vowed his committee w=
ill recommend changes in the law and regulations.=20
The inquiries are reminiscent of the role played by Congress during the sav=
ings and loan crisis of the 1980's. Some lawmakers touched by the scandal, =
most notably Senator John McCain of Arizona -- who took contributions from =
Charles Keating, the operator of a failed thrift, and spoke on his behalf -=
- were deeply affected by that experience and made campaign finance overhau=
l a signature issue. Mr. McCain said of the Enron scandal, ''It's clear the=
re is a taint out there on all of us.''=20
As Mr. McCain's campaign finance bill regains momentum on Capitol Hill, it =
is unclear whether the Enron debacle will have a similar effect on House me=
mbers and senators who once sided with Enron and the accounting industry.=
=20
One candidate is Representative Billy Tauzin, the Republican chairman of th=
e House Committee on Energy and Commerce. On July 20, 2000, in a letter co-=
signed by 20 House members, Mr. Tauzin opposed any toughening of accounting=
 rules. In the previous five years, Mr. Tauzin had received nearly $150,000=
 from accounting firms.=20
As chairman of Congress's most aggressive committee investigating Enron, Mr=
. Tauzin has hammered away at the accounting profession.=20
His spokesman, Ken Johnson, said the case had changed Mr. Tauzin's view of =
auditor independence. Two years ago, Mr. Tauzin was convinced Mr. Levitt's =
plan was ''a solution to a problem that didn't exist,'' Mr. Johnson said. '=
'Now we know there's a problem. It's time to fix it.''

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE PARTNERSHIPS
Investors Lured To Enron Deals By Inside Data
By KURT EICHENWALD

01/25/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 4
c. 2002 New York Times Company

Enron executives enticed wealthy individuals and institutions to invest in =
one of the partnerships that helped wreck the company by dangling the prosp=
ect that inside knowledge could potentially help them double their money in=
 a matter of months, according to partnership records and prospective inves=
tors.=20
In dozens of pages, the confidential records of a partnership called LJM2 d=
escribe the inner workings of an entity at the heart of the Enron debacle. =
The records show company executives wearing two hats, offering banks, insur=
ance companies, Wall Street firms and wealthy investors inside knowledge ab=
out Enron and its off-the-books holdings -- information that they denied co=
mpany shareholders.
The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether Enron's acc=
ounting for its partnerships violated the law, though details of its inquir=
y have not been disclosed.=20
Under pressure from the S.E.C. investigation, Enron began disclosing detail=
s of its partnerships last fall and started down what turned out to be the =
road to collapse.=20
The records show that Enron disclosed to potential investors the conflicts =
of interest posed by Enron executives' playing a dual role, but sought to a=
llay concern over them.=20
The LJM2 partnership was run by Andrew S. Fastow, who at the same time was =
Enron's chief financial officer. It was set up, in part, to invest in entit=
ies that Enron controlled and to purchase investments that Enron did not wa=
nt on its books.=20
Mr. Fastow and other Enron executives who managed the partnership had a dut=
y to maximize returns for Enron shareholders, the documents note, even as t=
hey were offering a separate set of lucrative deals to banks, Wall Street f=
irms and wealthy individuals who owned stakes in the partnerships.=20
According to the documents, the spectacular returns were possible because t=
he partnerships would be investing in deals originated by Enron, then in it=
s heyday as a swashbuckling global pioneer of energy deregulation. The inve=
stments would draw on confidential, nonpublic information developed by the =
energy company, the documents explained.=20
''Enron frequently has access to investment opportunities that are not avai=
lable to other investors,'' the private placement memorandum for LJM2 said.=
=20
Securities experts say that knowledge of the investment plans and strategie=
s of hot companies, like Enron was at the time, is a coveted commodity on W=
all Street because it can provide investors a leg up.=20
The records show that investors in LJM2, which set out to raise $200 millio=
n and ultimately took in $349 million, were given more information about En=
ron's financial situation than the company's shareholders.=20
For example, documents sent to potential investors in 2000 revealed that En=
ron controlled about 50 percent more assets than disclosed in Enron's secur=
ities filings. The difference -- $34 billion versus $51 billion, as of June=
 30, 1999 -- was the value of assets moved off Enron's books through variou=
s partnership deals.=20
The disclosures created conflicts for Wall Street firms, as well. For examp=
le, the investment banking arm of Merrill Lynch & Company, which underwrote=
 the LJM2 offering, was aware of the off-balance-sheet figures for Enron; i=
ndeed, Merrill's name is on the cover page of the offering containing the d=
ata.=20
But because the numbers were confidential, that information could not be sh=
ared with Merrill brokerage clients who were investing in Enron stock. Joe =
Cohen, a Merrill spokesman, declined to comment.=20
Merrill was not alone. Dozens of other banks, brokerage firms, pension fund=
s and other institutional investors were approached to invest in LJM2 just =
over two years ago, and all were provided with the confidential data about =
the extent of Enron's off-balance-sheet dealings.=20
Enron's shareholders learned little of these deals until the company restat=
ed its financial results last fall, erasing nearly $600 million in profits =
over five years, and provided additional, but still fragmentary, details.=
=20
Wall Street firms are supposed to maintain a so-called Chinese wall to ensu=
re that customers of their brokerage operations are not made privy to insid=
e information gleaned by their investment bankers. In this case, securities=
 experts said, the intent of those laws was undermined.=20
The transactions ''followed the legal norms to produce a perverse result,''=
 said John C. Coffee Jr., a securities law expert at Columbia University. '=
'It's a case where the Chinese wall is working to injure public investors, =
rather than benefit them.''=20
At the same time, analysts of the Enron stock were provided little informat=
ion about the partnerships.=20
John Olson, an analyst with Sanders Morris Harris in Houston who was long a=
 skeptic on Enron stock, recalled that he once questioned company executive=
s about their partnerships.=20
''They told us, 'We can't discuss it, it's confidential, and we are enjoine=
d from disclosing anything about it,' '' Mr. Olson said.=20
Among the investors in LJM2, according to court records, are Citicorp, the =
American Home Assurance Company, the Travelers Insurance Company, and an in=
vestment partnership affiliated with Morgan Stanley.=20
The partnership documents made clear to potential investors the magnitude o=
f the conflicts of interest created by the dual roles of the executives. ''=
One of the most challenging due diligence issues for the partnership is the=
 potential for conflict as a result of the principals' dual positions as En=
ron employees and principals of the partnership,'' the offering memorandum =
said.=20
A separate document disclosed last week by Congressional investigators said=
 that Enron's board waived the company's code of ethics to allow Mr. Fastow=
 to serve as LJM2's general partner. Investors were told that Richard A. Ca=
usey, who is still Enron's chief accounting officer, was assigned responsib=
ility for monitoring the partnership and mediating conflicts of interest.=
=20
The partnership documents -- including sales presentations made by Mr. Fast=
ow to potential institutional investors in LJM2 -- describe in detail the w=
orkings and performance of several partnerships that have gotten the most a=
ttention since the Enron scandal began to unfold.=20
Among them are limited partnerships known as JEDI I and JEDI II, an acronym=
 with a ''Star Wars'' glint that stood for Joint Energy Development Investm=
ents.=20
The records said that investors in those partnerships initially were promis=
ed returns of 15 percent and 20 percent, respectively. By the time LJM2 was=
 being marketed, JEDI I had returned 23 percent annually for its life, and =
JEDI II -- which was still in operation -- was expected to return 194 perce=
nt annually.=20
For the LJM2 partnership, according to internal records and marketing mater=
ials, the Enron executives were expecting a minimum annualized return of 30=
 percent. But sales agents also emphasized the earlier partnerships' result=
s.=20
''The implication of their pitch was very clear,'' said one person who hear=
d it. ''At least 30 percent could mean well over 100 percent or more.''=20
As of last March 31, according to confidential partnership records, three o=
f the four largest investments in LJM2 brought in returns of more than 100 =
percent. The lowest return, from an investment in another Enron entity call=
ed Raptor I, was 58 percent over four months; the highest, in Raptor II, wa=
s 212 percent in just over three months.=20
In the first quarter of last year, the partnership distributed $75 million =
to investors -- or about 44 percent of the total of $171 million that was i=
nvested in the partnership by the end of 2000.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE
How LJM2 Tripped Up Enron
By Dylan Loeb McClain

c. 2002 New York Times Company

When Enron restated its earnings last year, reducing its profits from 1997-=
2001 by almost $600 million and shrinking its shareholder equity by more th=
an $1.2 billion, it said that the reason was partly its deals with a partne=
rship named LJM2. According to Enron, the partnership was independent of th=
e company, but the top executives of LJM2 were also top executives at Enron=
 -- a connection highlighted in the partnership offering papers as one reas=
on LJM2 would be a desirable investment. Here is one way that the partnersh=
ip became a problem. Dylan Loeb McClain

Chart SENIOR EXECUTIVES INCLUDED Andrew S. Fastow Chief financial officer M=
ichael J. Kooper Managing director Enron Global Equity Markets Group Ben Gl=

ARTNERS Mr. Fastow, Mr. Kooper, Mr. Glisan Raptor Subsidiary partnerships c=
reated to invest in Enron holdings. 1. Enron lent $1.2 billion of its stock=
 to the Raptor partnerships. Enron also promised to issue more stock if the=
 value of the Raptor investments fell, thus ensuring the solvency of the pa=
rtnerships. 2. LJM2 invested millions of dollars in the Raptor partnerships=

 4. The interests of LJM2 and Enron were at odds. At one point, in Septembe=
r 2000, LJM2 entered into an agreement that obligated it to buy Enron stock=
 at a fixed price anytime Enron wanted to sell over the next six months. Th=
is was a way for Enron to protect itself against a decline in its stock pri=
ce. But LJM2 asked to settle the contract early when it could pay less for =
the stock than its current price, thereby making $10 million. 5. Selling so=
me of its stockholdings and assets to the Raptor partnerships insulated Enr=
on against a decline in their value. But, when the value of those assets de=
clined precipitously, Enron was obligated to provide more of its own stock =

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: MUTUAL FUNDS
Many May Be Surprised To Be Enron Investors
By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

01/25/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 3
c. 2002 New York Times Company

In the last year, more than 50 mutual funds and insurance companies, includ=
ing some of the largest and best known in America, invested in a trust crea=
ted by Enron in 1997 to finance the operations of several of the energy com=
pany's shadowy partnerships. As a result, many individual investors -- thro=
ugh these funds -- unwittingly owned a piece of an entity that was used to =
finance some of the partnerships that contributed to Enron's failure.=20
In September 2000 the trust, called the Osprey Trust, raised $2.4 billion f=
rom institutional investors in a so-called private placement of notes due i=
n January 2003. Within the last year, mutual fund and financial services co=
mpanies like Putnam Investments, the Vanguard Group, Travelers and Prudenti=
al have bought Osprey debt.
By last fall, when Enron's troubles started to surface, prices on the Ospre=
y debt began to drop. Since they were ultimately backed by Enron shares, th=
e securities appear to have lost 60 percent of their value for any fund or =
investor still holding them.=20
Osprey seems to have been a central fund-raising entity for several of Enro=
n's partnerships, including LJM and Whitewing L.P., a partnership created b=
y Enron that invested in energy-related projects in Europe and South Americ=
a, including an electric distribution company in Brazil. Whitewing allowed =
Enron to realize cash from the partnership's investments, while keeping the=
 partnership's debt obligations -- including the $2.4 billion it raised fro=
m large investors -- off Enron's balance sheet.=20
Enron had included Whitewing in its consolidated financial statements in 19=
98 but removed it in March 1999, arguing that since it was owned jointly by=
 Enron and Osprey it no longer belonged in Enron's reports. But when Enron'=
s fortunes started to decline last autumn, it became clear that Enron's sha=
reholders were ultimately responsible for the debt raised by Osprey. In a c=
onference call with analysts and investors on Nov. 14, Jeffrey McMahon, who=
 had only recently been appointed Enron's chief financial officer, disclose=
d that Osprey's assets, which had carried a book value of $4.7 billion, had=
 declined in value by $600 million.=20
Mr. McMahon also disclosed for the first time that the Osprey debt was back=
ed by 50 million shares of Enron common stock and that the company had an a=
dditional obligation to issue more shares if the assets held in Osprey and =
the common shares were insufficient to repay the debtholders in 2003.=20
Robert McCullough, a consultant to the electric utility industry at McCullo=
ugh Research in Portland, Ore., calculated that the value of Osprey today i=
s roughly 60 percent lower than its $4.7 billion book value stated last fal=
l. His calculation takes into account the $600 million write-down disclosed=
 by Mr. McMahon last November as well as the fact that the Enron stock back=
ing the assets is now practically worthless.=20
''That means exposing the Osprey owners to a large discount from book value=
 as well,'' Mr. McCullough said.=20
But it is not clear whether those left holding Osprey notes have written th=
eir values down appropriately. In documents dated as recently as this month=
, Mr. McCullough found several funds still valuing their Osprey holdings at=
 levels that do not appear to reflect the diminished value of those positio=
ns.=20
Owning a piece of Osprey may come as a surprise to some holders of bond mut=
ual funds. Investors who buy bond funds are typically more conservative tha=
n those who buy stock funds. Bond investors usually seek income and preserv=
ation of their capital; some buy funds which limit their holdings to securi=
ties issued by the United States government or high-grade corporations, whi=
le others take on more risk by purchasing lower-grade bonds that carry high=
er yields.=20
Private placements, like the one Osprey used to raise money from investors,=
 are offered only to large institutional investors with more than $100 mill=
ion under management. As such, they are initially exempt from registration =
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Although Osprey's securities s=
hould have become registered automatically with the commission six months a=
fter they were offered, no Osprey filings could be found in the course of s=
everal searches of S.E.C. documents.=20
Among the largest buyers of the debt was the AXP Bond Fund, an American Exp=
ress Financial Advisers fund, which held $10 million worth in 2001. Several=
 Prudential funds were big holders of Osprey; the Prudential Series Fund he=
ld more than $17 million of the debt. The Putnam Income Fund held $6.6 mill=
ion in Osprey. To be sure, such holdings are minuscule when compared with t=
he assets under management at these funds.=20
The Osprey notes carried high yields even before Enron began its decline. O=
ne investor who owned the debt last year said that the holdings yielded aro=
und 13 percent before trouble struck. As Enron's fortunes sank last fall, b=
ut before the company filed for bankruptcy, the notes' yields climbed to 24=
 percent.=20
Alan Papier, an analyst at Morningstar in Chicago, said that private placem=
ent debt, like the Osprey notes, are common holdings in mutual funds, espec=
ially those seeking high levels of income. ''These securities might have a =
little bit higher yield because by design there cannot be as wide an audien=
ce for them,'' he said.=20
Delaware Investments, a money management concern in Philadelphia with $84 b=
illion under management, bought and sold a small amount of Osprey debt seve=
ral times the last 18 months. The firm, a subsidiary of the Lincoln Financi=
al Group, owned roughly $6 million of Osprey notes in several of its mutual=
 funds, which had assets totaling $2.4 billion.=20
Matt Stephens, an analyst at Delaware, explained that he bought the Osprey =
notes because they were backed by assets owned by Enron but which the compa=
ny had decided were not a part of its core business and had moved into the =
Osprey trust. That trust, Mr. Stephens explained, was set up to operate the=
 assets and liquidate them over time.=20
''We looked at it as a secured way to play the Enron credit story, and we u=
sed it as a trading vehicle,'' he said. Mr. Stephens added that the Osprey =
notes carried a higher yield than Enron's corporate debt and that made the =
investment attractive as well.=20
Delaware lost money on its Osprey holdings, but not nearly as much as it wo=
uld have if it had held on through Enron's bankruptcy filing. During the co=
urse of the last 18 months, the firm bought Osprey notes at $950 to $1,000 =
(or face value). It sold them at roughly $835 in November, after Enron exec=
utives had a conference call with investors and analysts outlining some of =
the company's problems. Mr. Stephens said the conference call created doubt=
s at his firm about Enron's credibility. ''When we lose faith in management=
, it is a clear sell signal to us,'' he said.=20
Other Osprey investors declined to comment on whether they still held the d=
ebt or whether they had written down its value in their funds. Spokeswomen =
for Prudential, Vanguard and Putnam all said their firms' policies were not=
 to comment on individual holdings.

Ruling Accelerates Key Depositions

HOUSTON, Jan. 24 -- A federal judge overseeing lawsuits against Enron and i=
ts executives lifted certain trial rules today, allowing lawyers to interro=
gate quickly some partners from the company's accounting firm, Arthur Ander=
sen, about the destruction of documents.=20
Under the order, handed down by Judge Melinda Harmon of the Federal Distric=
t Court in Houston, the lawyers could schedule depositions in as little as =
three weeks from David B. Duncan, who was the lead partner in charge of the=
 Enron account, as well as four other partners and an in-house lawyer. Ande=
rsen fired Mr. Duncan on Jan. 15.
Mr. Duncan could invoke his Fifth Amendment right to decline to testify in =
a civil trial, as he did before a Congressional panel, but civil lawyers sa=
id they could use such a decision to insinuate that he had something to hid=
e.=20

Why Bush Stiffed Enron
By Virginia Postrel

Enron Corp. gave the Bush campaign lots of money. When Enron got in trouble=
, cabinet secretaries took its calls. But they did nothing to save it.=20
What are we to make of this peculiar chain of events? What, after all, is t=
he point of handing out corporate money to politicians if the company can't=
 get favors when its life is on the line? Was there a secret bailout deal t=
hat hasn't made the papers? Or were administration officials just doing wha=
t was good for the country?
It would be nice to conclude that the Bush administration turned down Enron=
's entreaties because of its deeply held free-market principles. But the mo=
st likely explanation is more complex and cynical. In any Republican admini=
stration, there are three forces (sometimes organized in factions, sometime=
s operating within the same individuals) determining economic policy: pro-b=
usiness instincts, pro-market principles, and political considerations. Get=
 two of the three on one side, and chances are that side will win.=20
Enron's problem, then, was exactly what Bush opponents tend to think of as =
its greatest strength. It was a Houston-based oil company. Enron, in other =
words, represented just the sort of voters President Bush can take for gran=
ted. In a reelection campaign, there's no way he would lose Texas. Indeed, =
many observers believe he lost the 2000 popular vote because he didn't work=
 hard enough to get a large turnout in his home state.=20
So Enron had no electoral clout, giving the Bush administration no politica=
l reason to sacrifice its economic principles to help save the company. By =
helping Enron, the administration could only lose, angering free market sup=
porters and embroiling itself in a business mess. A bankrupt Enron couldn't=
 even promise future campaign funds. If only Enron had been based in Pennsy=
lvania or West Virginia. Then things would have been different.=20
Just ask the steel industry. There, the Bush administration has pursued a d=
angerously protectionist policy, jettisoning not only its own stated princi=
ples but American leadership in breaking down barriers to free trade.=20
To help ailing steel companies, the administration initiated what is known =
as a section 201 action. This allows the government to establish import quo=
tas or tariffs for five years, limiting competition while the domestic indu=
stry tries to get its act together. Under this law, the protected industry =
doesn't have to show that foreign producers get any unfair advantages from =
their own governments or even that imports are the main source of its probl=
ems. The industry merely has to demonstrate that it's hurt by foreign compe=
tition. Since any competition makes business tougher, that's an easy case f=
or a struggling industry to make.=20
So the free-trade president has adopted a blatantly protectionist position,=
 raising prices for everyone who buys or makes anything that uses steel. Bi=
g Steel is now demanding 40% tariffs and a bailout of $12 billion to cover =
lavish retirement benefits, particularly health costs. Steel retirees, who =
are, of course, already covered by Medicare, outnumber steel employees abou=
t 5 to 1.=20
Why is the administration that wouldn't try to save Enron entertaining such=
 pro-business, anti-market ideas? It's a simple political calculation. Pres=
ident Bush won steel-producing West Virginia (and, arguably, the presidency=
) by a mere 40,000 votes. He lost steel-producing Pennsylvania by only 200,=
000 votes. He doesn't have to worry about carrying Texas. He does have to w=
orry about the swing states of the steel belt.=20
That sort of calculation is nothing new in American politics. The first Pre=
sident Bush also denied the oil industry federal help while extending steel=
 quotas.=20
Nor is the split a purely Republican phenomenon. Back in the early 1970s, e=
conomic historian Gavin Wright took a careful statistical look at New Deal =
largess. He found that the Roosevelt administration directed money not at t=
he poorest states, which were in the solidly Democratic South, but at the s=
wing states of the West. After controlling for how rural states were, Mr. W=
right found that 80% of the variation in spending could be explained by fac=
tors that defined political swing states.=20
In a democracy of concentrated interests, some votes clearly count more tha=
n others. But, to look at the bright side, at least sometimes predictable v=
otes lead to principled policies. The Bush administration dodged a bigger E=
nron scandal because it could take Texas for granted.=20

Trading Charges: Lawsuit Spotlights J.P. Morgan's Ties To the Enron Debacle=
 --- Insurers Balk at Paying Bank Up to $1 Billion in Claims On Complex Tra=
nsactions --- Update in a Glass Room
By Jathon Sapsford and Anita Raghavan

When J.P. Morgan & Co. set up an energy-trading business in the British Cha=
nnel Islands a decade ago, the tiny venture barely caused a ripple at the g=
iant bank.=20
The operation, called Mahonia Ltd., consisted of just a small office with l=
ots of phone lines. But the Jersey-based business grew over the years to tr=
ansact billions of dollars of natural-gas contracts with other energy compa=
nies. Mahonia's trading followed a simple pattern: Many of its transactions=
 took place just before year-end. Often, the deliveries of natural gas and =
oil were sold right back to those who delivered them through complex deriva=
tive transactions. And about 60% of Mahonia's trades were with just one com=
pany: Enron Corp.
The point of the choreographed trading? People familiar with Mahonia say En=
ron used the transactions to manage tax liabilities by transferring losses =
in one financial reporting period to another. As Enron's troubles mounted, =
the Houston company eventually turned to Mahonia as a sort of surrogate ban=
k, these people say, using it to raise at least $2 billion in financing ove=
r the years.=20
For J.P. Morgan, the arrangement was lucrative -- at least at first. The ba=
nk received as much as $100 million in revenues. It also thought it had ins=
urance in place to cover any default by Enron.=20
But in the wake of Enron's collapse and bankruptcy-court filing, Mahonia co=
uld cost the nation's second-largest bank as much as $1 billion. Several in=
surers have alleged in a lawsuit in New York federal court that the trading=
 transactions were shams, thereby negating the insurance contracts. The ban=
k, now known as J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., disputes the court allegation. Cre=
dit-rating concern Standard & Poor's cited J.P. Morgan's overall exposure t=
o Enron as one reason it is reviewing the bank's credit rating for a possib=
le downgrade. J.P. Morgan, which acted as a lender, underwriter and merger =
adviser to Enron, says the energy concern owes it a total of $2.6 billion.=
=20
The Mahonia arrangement -- which J.P. Morgan hadn't disclosed to investors =
until last month's suit -- represents just a sliver of the many complicated=
 ventures Enron participated in. But unlike the hundreds of partnerships En=
ron constructed on its own to keep debt off its books, this venture was con=
ceived, launched and operated by J.P. Morgan. Though many Wall Street firms=
 helped finance Enron -- acting as traditional lenders, underwriters and ad=
visers -- the fact that J.P. Morgan set up the partnership suggests that Wa=
ll Street may have played a more active role in the Enron scandal.=20
J.P. Morgan won't comment on some key aspects of the dispute, citing pendin=
g litigation. A spokesman says that "many companies routinely raise funds u=
sing pre-paid commodity forward contracts. The benefits vary from client to=
 client, including pricing advantages and diversity of credit sources."=20
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer says the trades were "perfectly legitimate and =
proper transactions" made as part of the normal course of trading commoditi=
es.=20
Many things about the operation remain mysterious. It is unclear, for insta=
nce, who owns Mahonia. According to records from the Jersey Financial Servi=
ces Commission, the company was incorporated on Dec. 16, 1992. It has two n=
ominee shareholders, Lively Ltd. and Juris Ltd., who represent undisclosed =
owners.=20
"The question is: Was Mahonia a conduit on behalf of Enron or a conduit on =
behalf of J.P. Morgan?" says Manfred Knoll, a managing director for Germany=
's Westdeutsche Landesbank, which issued a $165 million letter of credit to=
 J.P. Morgan to guarantee against losses. He says Mahonia legally was a con=
duit of J.P. Morgan. But in practice, "it was a conduit that was set up to =
transact a variety of financial transactions for Enron."=20
On Tuesday, a New York bankruptcy-court judge ruled that Enron will have to=
 make available documents relating to Mahonia to the German bank, people fa=
miliar with the matter say.=20
As part of its broad investigation into Enron, the Securities and Exchange =
Commission is reviewing J.P. Morgan's multifaceted relationship with Enron,=
 people familiar with the matter say. Among other things, investigators are=
 examining whether the bank, through vehicles such as Mahonia, helped Enron=
 draw a misleading financial picture for investors.=20
People close to the matter say Enron told J.P. Morgan the trades were for t=
ax purposes. Tax experts say it is common for companies to manage tax liabi=
lities by, for instance, deferring certain losses from a bad year, when the=
 tax bill might be low, to a future period when they can be used to offset =
high earnings. There's nothing inherently illegal about trying to minimize =
corporate tax bills. Enron hasn't paid corporate income tax in four of the =
past five years, a spokesman says.=20
The Mahonia maneuvers may draw additional scrutiny now, however, in light o=
f admissions by Enron that it used a series of outside partnerships to hide=
 losses.=20
Whatever the ultimate goal, the transactions worked like this: J.P. Morgan =
would pay Enron between $150 million and $250 million for the future delive=
ry of natural gas or crude oil. This was constructed as a "trade," not a lo=
an. So Enron would report this as earnings that would cancel out, temporari=
ly, losses on Enron books.=20
But Enron had to eventually deliver the oil or gas, usually in regular inst=
allments with the value of $10 million to $20 million, the people familiar =
with Mahonia say. With each delivery, the losses began again to appear on E=
nron's ledger. These deliveries would begin the following year, so the loss=
es were carried from one year to the next, without showing up clearly on En=
ron's books.=20
The result: Enron kept those losses in reserve in case Enron had any profit=
 windfall on which it might pay tax, the people familiar with the matter sa=
y. If it did, it would use those losses to cancel out profits, and thus low=
er its tax burden. Or if Enron didn't have big profits to hide, it would ju=
st roll the losses over again to the next fiscal year -- by going back to J=
.P. Morgan and selling it another gas contract. Two tax experts contacted f=
or this article described the technique as unusual but potentially very eff=
ective. "It certainly makes sense as a tax strategy," says Doug Carmichael,=
 a professor of accounting at New York's Baruch College.=20
The whole process fed on itself. As one Wall Street banker put it, the arra=
ngements "practically guaranteed" Enron would come back to J.P. Morgan for =
more.=20
What was in it for Morgan? The deals generated, over the decade, fees and i=
nterest measuring as much as $100 million. In paying for future delivery of=
 gas to Mahonia, J.P. Morgan got the gas at a discount -- reflecting the in=
terest rate Enron would have paid were it getting a straightforward loan. I=
n the summer of 1999, this amounted to somewhere between 7% and 8%, or roug=
hly $7 million to $8 million for every $100 million J.P. Morgan channeled t=
o Enron under the Mahonia arrangement. (That revenue, of course, was offset=
 in part by the bank's funding costs.) The bank often got a small fee for a=
rranging the financing.=20
The arrangements were for years a source of pride within the bank's small c=
ommodities division, which directed the trades. Dinsa Mehta, one of J.P. Mo=
rgan's senior commodity traders, praised the deals to colleagues, saying th=
at while Enron put out its other commodity financing needs for all of Wall =
Street to bid on, Enron kept coming back to J.P. Morgan for trades that wou=
ld carry its losses forward. Mr. Mehta, contacted through a spokeswoman, de=
clined to comment.=20
In a basic way, the trading pact is a throwback. Prepaying for future deliv=
ery of a commodity is known as a "gold trade," because it is the way gold b=
ullion has been trading for centuries. In recent years, trading companies, =
whether from Houston or Wall Street, have been making more use of this stru=
cture to buy and sell oil, natural gas and other commodities. Some commerci=
al banks, including Chase Manhattan, a predecessor of J.P. Morgan, had to s=
et up part of these trades overseas because their banking charters wouldn't=
 allow them to take delivery of commodities.=20
J.P. Morgan also bought commodities contracts from a number of other energy=
 companies. Yet by far Mahonia's biggest customer was Enron, accounting for=
 roughly 60% of its business, people familiar with the matter say.=20
Over the years, the size of the transactions grew and the repayment periods=
 stretched out further and further into the future.=20
Mahonia's business with Enron jumped sharply in 1999. Oil prices were weak,=
 causing concerns over the future profitability of the energy industry. The=
 stock and bond capital markets had become reluctant to finance energy comp=
anies, leaving J.P. Morgan's offshore arrangements one of the few places th=
is industry could raise money.=20
In the summer of 1999, Enron officials contacted Morgan with requests to do=
 bigger and bigger trades, including a large arrangement of $650 million in=
 one trade. It was a far cry from earlier trades in the range of $150 milli=
on, and suggested to some people within the bank that Enron was no longer m=
erely interested in tax avoidance, but was actively using the arrangement t=
o meet its financing needs.=20
J.P. Morgan officials couldn't do the business without hedges. The firm wou=
ld be on the hook for a large chunk of cash if Enron defaulted before it de=
livered the natural gas. These arrangements, after all, presented the same =
default risk as any loan to Enron. J.P. Morgan effectively had been paying =
a portion of its earnings to other banks in exchange for their guaranteeing=
 portions of the arrangement. This move shifted some of the risk to other b=
anks like ABN Amro Holding NV or West LB.=20
It wasn't enough. By this time, companies including Enron wanted to raise m=
ore through Mahonia than the banking syndicate was willing to handle amid t=
he oil-price slump. So Enron, if it wanted more money, needed to find new p=
layers to share the risk of financing the gas payments.=20
Enron turned to 11 insurance companies -- including National Fire Insurance=
 Co., Safeco Insurance Co., St. Paul Fire & Marine Insurance Co. and Citigr=
oup Inc.'s Travelers unit -- to issue "surety bonds." These are financial g=
uarantees insurance companies commonly issue to ensure a project is complet=
ed, whether it's a bridge or Hollywood movie. Enron arranged these contract=
s for J.P. Morgan -- and paid the insurance companies for it -- so that the=
 bank would feel more comfortable making increasingly large trades with the=
 energy company, according to a person familiar with the arrangement.=20
As Enron's trades grew bigger and bigger, the bank was also financing other=
 energy companies, and the accounting on these trades became a source of co=
ncern within the bank. On Aug. 5, 1999, Vice Chairman Marc Shapiro and seni=
or credit officer David Pflug convened a meeting in a glass room off the ba=
nk's commodity trading floor.=20
As part of that briefing, the group went through a lengthy history of the b=
ank's trading with energy companies. The managers were told one reason comp=
anies like Enron were entering the complex trades was to carry forward loss=
es and lower tax burdens, a person familiar with the briefing said. This pe=
rson said Mr. Shapiro reviewed the trades and said they were fine. Mr. Shap=
iro declines to comment. Mr. Pflug, confirming the meeting, said it was cal=
led to discuss another client and commodity derivative contracts in general=
.=20
Two years later, the arrangement was still functioning as Enron's troubles =
deepened. Both Enron and J.P. Morgan kept looking for other institutions to=
 share the risk as Enron kept running new trades through Mahonia.=20
That's when Enron and Morgan turned to the German bank for more comfort. On=
 Sept. 10, 2001, Enron and Morgan arranged to obtain a $165 million letter =
of credit from West LB to guarantee derivatives trades between Mahonia and =
Enron North America, according to Mr. Knoll, the bank managing director.=20
In an unusual move underscoring Morgan's keen interest in the letter of cre=
dit, the legal documents were reviewed by Philip Levy, Morgan's associate g=
eneral counsel. Mr. Levy didn't return a call seeking comment.=20
Enron's woes deepened further. After a planned merger with rival Dynegy Inc=
. fell through, Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Dec. 2.=
 After the filing, Morgan requested to be paid under the letter of credit, =
Mr. Knoll says. So far, West LB has refused to pay, depositing the $165 mil=
lion in an escrow account which it says it will make available when the Mah=
onia transactions underlying the lending facility are proved proper.=20
It was only after the bankruptcy filing that investors first got a whiff of=
 Mahonia. Morgan's insurers, due to make a payment on the surety bonds by a=
 Dec. 21 deadline, refused to pay. Morgan sued in New York federal court. T=
he insurers filed a counterclaim, alleging that Mahonia was a fabrication m=
eant to disguise loans in the forms of commodity trades.=20
In court papers, the insurers say they were led to believe the arrangements=
 were meant to "actually supply natural gas and crude oil by Enron to Mahon=
ia." But the insurers refuse to pay the guarantees because the arrangements=
 "were not intended to be fulfilled," the insurers' complaint alleges. It a=
dds that Mahonia was a "mechanism to obtain surety bonds to secure loans to=
 be made to Enron in the guise" of trades.=20
J.P. Morgan says the insurers' claims are without merit, noting that the su=
rety contracts say the insurance liability is "absolute and unconditional."=
=20
The case is pending. But the spat already has dented Morgan's credibility. =
Morgan Chief Executive Officer William Harrison called his board shortly af=
ter the Enron bankruptcy filing and told them the bank had some $500 millio=
n in unsecured exposure and some other secured exposures, including loans o=
f $400 million backed by pipeline assets.=20
But after the insurers refused to honor their commitments on the surety bon=
ds, Mr. Harrison had to hit the phones again to directors, and raise the nu=
mber to $2.6 billion -- with roughly $1 billion of the additional exposure =
directly related to Mahonia.=20
Morgan has been defending its position ever since. Last week, the bank repo=
rted a fourth-quarter loss of $332 million, partly because of its exposure =
to Enron.=20
Meanwhile, Mr. Shapiro, the vice chairman, asserts that Morgan has known al=
l along the extent of its Enron vulnerability. "It's not an issue of what w=
e knew," he said late last month "but what was appropriate to disclose."=20

Accounting for Enron: Former SEC Chief Levitt Reverses Stand, Calls for New=
 Laws on Accounting Rules
By Michael Schroeder
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

WASHINGTON -- Former Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Lev=
itt, reversing an earlier stand, told Congress that the collapse of Enron C=
orp. uncovered systemic accounting problems that can be fixed only through =
legislation.=20
"The environment today calls for very different remedies, very different ac=
tion," Mr. Levitt told the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. "If you w=
ould have asked me a year ago whether a legislative solution was desirable,=
 I would have said `no.' "
With Enron, "the smoking gun has exploded," he said, adding. "That's often =
what it takes for a wake-up call."=20
Congress needs to authorize a new, independent oversight board for the acco=
unting industry, he said. He also told lawmakers that the SEC needs to adop=
t new accounting standards to better track the effect of executive stock op=
tions and to require full disclosure of off-balance-sheet "special purpose =
entities," which Enron formed to conceal losses.=20
Mr. Levitt was joined by Lynn Turner, former SEC chief accountant, who call=
ed for an overhaul of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the industr=
y's independent rule-making body, as well as an overhaul of accounting rule=
s as well.=20
"What is reflected here is a shared sense of outrage," said Committee Chair=
man Joseph Lieberman (D., Conn.). He said the committee would do a thorough=
 investigation and hold more hearings, with "a shared desire to end this in=
vestigation with serious proposals for reform."=20
In the aftermath of the Enron bankruptcy filing, Mr. Levitt has been upstag=
ing his SEC successor, Harvey Pitt, in promoting needed reforms. He applaud=
ed Mr. Pitt's recently announced proposal for a new private-sector oversigh=
t board, but questioned whether it went far enough. Mr. Levitt proposed tha=
t Congress approve and fund a new board that is completely independent of t=
he accounting industry.=20
Messrs. Levitt and Turner said that FASB, which is responsible for creating=
 accounting standards, fails to approve needed changes because they are blo=
cked by board members appointed by the securities and accounting industries=
.=20
For instance, the SEC first asked the FASB to improve the standards for rep=
orting special purpose entities in 1985. The end result was a "weak set of =
rules," Mr. Turner said. Because of growing problems, the SEC called for ne=
w stiffer rules in its 2000 report to Congress. "We cannot afford to wait a=
nother 15 years," Mr. Turner said. "If the FASB were unable to resolve this=
 by the end of 2002, then I would urge the SEC to act promptly."=20
Also in testimony yesterday, University of San Diego law professor Frank Pa=
rtnoy said he has independently gathered information that Enron manipulated=
 its derivatives trading revenue. "In a nutshell, it appears that some Enro=
n employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to creat=
e false profit and loss entries for the derivatives Enron traded," Mr. Part=
noy said.=20
Mr. Partnoy, who formerly worked as a derivatives salesman at J.P. Morgan, =
said Enron's extensive use of derivatives was a major cause of the company'=
s financial downfall. Enron reported more than $16 billion in gains from de=
rivatives over the three years to 2000.=20
Vance Meyer, an Enron spokesman, said he hadn't seen the testimony and as a=
 general rule Enron wouldn't offer a counterpoint to testimony from Washing=
ton hearings.

A Renewed Call to Redo Accounting Reform: Two years after initially urging =

WASHINGTON -- Two years ago, Arthur Levitt couldn't muster much support for=
 a proposal to make accounting firms more independent by limiting their abi=
lity to sell consulting services to their audit clients.=20
Amid strong opposition from the accounting industry, corporations and membe=
rs of Congress, the then-chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission=
 backed down.
On Thursday, however, the same proposal held the rapt attention of a roomfu=
l of fawning senators and caused Levitt to be mobbed by reporters after his=
 testimony.=20
"So do you feel completely--or just absolutely, totally--vindicated?" quipp=
ed Sen. Mark Dayton (D-Minn.).=20
In another sign that government priorities have changed as a result of the =
Enron Corp. bankruptcy, the Senate on Thursday held its first full committe=
e hearing to examine why the energy giant collapsed and what the government=
 could have done to prevent the loss of billions of dollars by employees an=
d investors.=20
The hearing set the stage for what is certain to be a vigorous debate in th=
e coming months over sweeping regulatory proposals to rein in financial mar=
kets, retirement funds, campaign fund-raising and the energy industry.=20
Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), who chairs the Senate Governmental Affa=
irs Committee, promised Thursday to lead an aggressive nonpartisan investig=
ation into the Enron debacle, seeking answers from government agencies incl=
uding the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the White House.=20
"We will follow the facts wherever they lead us," Lieberman said.=20
Among the questions Lieberman hopes to answer are: How did Enron hide its d=
ebts and losses from SEC oversight? Could the Labor Department have interve=
ned to prevent Enron employees from losing their retirement savings? Are Wa=
ll Street analysts providing objective analysis of stocks? Did regulatory g=
aps allow Enron's problems to slip through the cracks?=20
But Republicans warned against rushing to new regulations. Only a year ago,=
 the Bush administration and the Republican Party were vowing to slash gove=
rnment rules in many of the same areas currently under a microscope.=20
The blame for Enron's bankruptcy filing Dec. 2--less than a month after it =
restated earnings to account for $586 million in previously unreported loss=
es--may ultimately rest with illegal activity of individuals, not a breakdo=
wn in regulation, said Sen. Fred Thompson (R-Tenn.), the ranking Republican=
 on the committee.=20
"No system known to man can prevent unscrupulous and clever individuals fro=
m manipulating the system and even getting away with it for a period of tim=
e," Thompson said.=20
He also warned Democrats not to try to take political advantage of the inve=
stigation by focusing on "titillating" issues, such as the contacts between=
 Enron officials and the Bush administration.=20
Levitt called upon Congress to pass new laws to tighten regulation of finan=
cial markets, which he said have been eroded by a "culture of gamesmanship =
that says it's OK to bend the rules, tweak the numbers and let obvious and =
important discrepancies slide."=20
In addition to renewing his call for limits on the types of consulting work=
 accounting firms can perform for an audit client, Levitt said companies sh=
ould be required to change audit firms every five to seven years; stock exc=
hanges should require that a majority of directors on company boards be ind=
ependent; and analysts should be forced to disclose how their compensation =
is affected by their firms' investment relationship with companies they cov=
er.=20
Levitt and Lynn E. Turner, the SEC's former chief accountant, said a new ac=
counting oversight board is needed with independent members, reliable fundi=
ng and a mandate to move quickly and aggressively to eliminate accounting l=
oopholes and gimmicks.=20
Turner said it has taken the Financial Accounting Standards Board longer to=
 approve new rules for special-purpose entities--the kind of off-the-books =
partnerships used by Enron to mask its problems--than "it's taken my childr=
en to get through high school."=20
Derivatives trading is another area ripe for government regulation, said Un=
iversity of San Diego law professor Frank Partnoy, who told the committee T=
hursday that Enron's heavy reliance on the high-risk market rivaled that of=
 the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund, which failed in 1998.=20
In fact, Partnoy said, Enron reported earning more money from trading deriv=
atives in 2000 than Long-Term Capital Management made in its history.=20
"Enron makes Long-Term Capital Management look like a lemonade stand," said=
 Partnoy, a former derivatives trader who is writing a book about Enron's c=
ollapse.=20
Derivatives, used by sophisticated investors as a risk-management tool, are=
 complex financial instruments whose value is based upon a future variable,=
 such as interest rates or gas prices.=20
Though some derivative trading occurs on regulated exchanges, the vast majo=
rity--more than $95 trillion a year--take place on over-the-counter markets=
 that were exempted from regulation in 2000 under the Commodity Futures Mod=
ernization Act.=20
Enron used derivatives in two ways. First, they were key to structuring Enr=
on's controversial partnerships, which allowed it to hide debt, mask invest=
ment losses and inflate earnings. Enron used them as a kind of financial "p=
lastic surgery to make itself look better than it really was," Partnoy said=
.=20
Second, they were key to Enron's profit. The company used its Enron Online =
division to act as a go-between for other parties wishing to trade not only=
 energy-related derivatives, but also contracts for such commodities as fib=
er-optic bandwidth. By the time Enron filed for bankruptcy, the soaring rev=
enue from the derivatives trading business was masking problems in Enron's =
core energy business.=20
The lack of government oversight may have enabled Enron to smooth out profi=
ts from derivatives trading to make the business appear less volatile. He s=
aid that was accomplished by creating accounts that enabled Enron to carry =
over trading profits from year to year.=20
An Enron spokesman could not be reached for comment on Partnoy's allegation=
s.

A noted plaintiffs' law firm, which is taking a highly visible role in a sh=
areholder suit against Enron Corp., is being investigated by federal author=
ities in connection with allegations that it improperly solicited investors=
 to file class-action suits, people familiar with the probe said.=20
The U.S. Attorney in Los Angeles has convened a grand jury to investigate M=
ilberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach LLP, these people said. Officials are t=
rying to determine whether the firm paid money to people to act as plaintif=
fs in lawsuits, the people familiar with the probe said.
Milberg Weiss, which has offices in New York and San Diego, didn't return p=
hone calls seeking comment. The grand-jury investigation was reported yeste=
rday by the Los Angeles Daily Journal, a legal-industry newspaper.=20
Disclosure of the probe comes as Milberg Weiss is in a pitched battle with =
other plaintiffs' firms vying for the role of lead counsel in securities-fr=
aud suits filed against Enron in federal court in Houston. The firm made he=
adlines earlier this week marching into court with a box of shredded docume=
nts carted out of Enron headquarters by an ex-employee.=20
Until recently, law firms that filed securities-fraud actions first often w=
ere given control of cases -- and the chance to make the largest fees. Firm=
s such as Milberg Weiss often maintained a stable of clients to help launch=
 the suits. The probe is looking at how Milberg Weiss identified those clie=
nts, and whether they were paid.=20
Since 1995, larger, institutional investors have been taking a greater role=
 in securities-fraud suits, because of a change in federal law. In the Enro=
n case, Milberg Weiss is representing the Regents of the University of Cali=
fornia. Lloyd Lee, a university lawyer, said the regents have consulted wit=
h Milberg Weiss, and "they assured us that they were cooperating fully with=
 the inquiry."=20
Separately, the federal judge in Houston presiding over the shareholder law=
suits related to Enron's collapse, ordered Arthur Andersen LLP to make six =
of its current and former officials available for depositions by next month=
 and provide a detailed account of document shredding that took place in it=
s Houston office.=20
The order is unusual because it comes so early in the litigation. Typically=
, under federal securities laws, plaintiffs' attorneys must wait until all =
pending motions for dismissal have been resolved before they are allowed to=
 proceed with the discovery phase of a case.=20
"It is a very sensible order under these extraordinary circumstances," said=
 Jeff Kaiser, an attorney at Kaiser & May LLP in Houston, one of the law fi=
rms representing shareholders in the Houston case. His firm also is pursuin=
g a separate lawsuit against Andersen in a Galveston County, Texas, state d=
istrict court.=20
The order by U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon requires Andersen to submit=
 a report within 20 days cataloging the documents it destroyed, describing =
any documents it has been able to recover and explaining the efforts it has=
 made to do so. Additionally, Andersen's report must include a description =
of Enron-related materials currently in the firm's possession.

After Enron, a Push to Limit Accountants to...Accounting
By Deborah Solomon
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

When it was flying high, energy-trading company Enron Corp. was famous for =
pioneering new markets. Here is something else it is helping to develop: a =
relatively new breed of shareholder proposal.=20
A number of institutional investors -- with Enron's rapid collapse in mind =
-- are calling for companies to adopt "conflict of interest policies" that =
would prevent their accounting firm from providing anything beyond auditing=
 services. Shareholder proposals seeking to limit the accounting firms' rol=
es have surfaced at a wide range of companies following Enron's meltdown. A=
t the heart of such proposals: concerns that accounting firms have a financ=
ial incentive to sign off on overly aggressive accounting practices at comp=
anies that simultaneously pay them large sums for nonaudit work.
In Enron's case, the Houston company paid Arthur Andersen LLP $25 million f=
or its audit and $27 million for nonauditing work, including tax-related an=
d consulting services, in 2000, the last year for which figures are publicl=
y available. In November, Enron restated its results for the previous four =
years, wiping out $586 million, or 20%, of its previously reported earnings=
. In recent testimony before Congress, Andersen officials have said they do=
n't believe their independence as an auditor was compromised by the nonaudi=
ting fees.=20
"It took Enron to get shareholders interested in addressing this issue, but=
 many investors want auditor independence," says Patrick McGurn, vice presi=
dent of Institutional Shareholder Services, a proxy adviser that makes reco=
mmendations for how institutions should vote.=20
Shareholders are proposing these policies for about 30 companies, including=
 Apple Computer Corp., Johnson & Johnson, Motorola Inc., PG&E Corp. and Wal=
t Disney Co. Most of the companies are fighting the initiatives and have as=
ked the Securities and Exchange Commission to rule that they don't have to =
put the proposals to a vote. Corporate-governance specialists expect the SE=
C to rule in favor of shareholders, putting the initiatives on the ballots =
for annual meetings later this year.=20
Whether any of the proposals become policy at the individual companies is a=
nother matter; rarely do shareholder proposals pass. But some who track cor=
porate-governance developments say support for these new ones could be stro=
ng enough to prompt companies to agree to limit the use of their auditing f=
irms for other activities. "It can embarrass management," says John C. Coff=
ee Jr., law professor at Columbia University. "The real success of these ki=
nds of proposals is that they will lead to negotiations . . . that might pu=
t restrictions on the amount of consulting that these companies can do."=20
The no-conflict-of-interest initiatives are being proposed by labor unions,=
 which hold shares in companies as part of pension plans and other investme=
nts. The United Brotherhood of Carpenters, which controls $35 billion in pe=
nsion assets, proposed the policy at several companies after reviewing the =
ratio of audit to nonaudit fees. The SEC began requiring that companies dis=
close that information as of the year 2000.=20
Many of the companies were paying 10 to 15 times more for nonaudit-related =
services than for auditing fees. Ed Durkin, director of special programs fo=
r the United Brotherhood of Carpenters, says: "The impression somebody coul=
d get from looking at these numbers is that there might be issues of indepe=
ndence and of the integrity of the financial-reporting system."=20
But some say a blanket policy restricting the accounting relationship isn't=
 necessarily going to prevent an Enron-like blow-up. "It's probably more a =
matter of disclosure than limitations," says David Bowers, an analyst with =
Evergreen Investment Management Co., which owns shares of PG&E. While inves=
tors need to pay attention to what the accountants are doing, there is some=
 benefit to having a firm perform multiple duties, he says. "It's hard to p=
aint it over with a broad brush and say you can't have both relationships."=
=20
Companies also note that some of the fees labeled as "nonaudit" under the n=
ew SEC rules are for services traditionally provided by auditors, such as w=
ork done on registration statements or on taxes. Renee Parnell, a spokeswom=
an for PG&E, says the company often has to use its accounting firm, Deloitt=
e & Touche LLP "for things like regulatory filings," adding that PG&E is "s=
eeking SEC recommendation on whether to include the proposal" in its proxy.=
 A spokeswoman for Disney declined to comment beyond what is written in the=
 proxy, which recommends that shareholders vote against the proposal. Repre=
sentatives from Apple, Motorola and Johnson & Johnson declined to comment.=
=20
The shareholders' proposals aren't original in this sense: Two years ago, f=
ormer SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. sought to limit dual auditing/consulti=
ng roles for accounting firms. But his plan met fierce resistance from the =
accounting industry and its lobbyists, as well as from members of Congress,=
 and he backed down, settling for less-stringent limits on certain types of=
 nonauditing work. Mr. Levitt has said several congressmen threatened to cu=
t the SEC's appropriations if he didn't back away from the tough conflict-o=
f-interest rules he originally promoted. Current SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt h=
as said he doesn't support the limitations sought by his predecessor, belie=
ving other reforms are more relevant.=20
James D. Cox, a professor of law at Duke University who has written extensi=
vely on accounting and legal issues, says shareholder proposals may be the =
best way to change the rules. "There are a lot of investors out there, incl=
uding financial institutions, who believe this is a good idea," he says. Be=
fore the Enron debacle, "we lulled ourselves into a complacent state thinki=
ng that accountants who know their client from performing nonaudit services=
 can better perform the audit function. I think that's a mantra that after =
Enron is going to fall on deaf ears."=20
Backers of the proposals say restricting the types of services accounting f=
irms perform for clients won't eliminate the potential for fraud, but can h=
elp bolster confidence in public companies. "I don't think there's any bene=
fit for a company if its accounting firm has a consulting relationship," sa=
ys Ted O'Connor, portfolio manager at Cambiar Investors Inc., which owns sh=
ares of Motorola. He expects to vote for the proposal at Motorola.

NSC Aided Enron's Efforts; Agency Sought Lay Meeting With Indians on Plant

The White House's National Security Council is the president's nerve center=
 for international crises and strategy. For a moment last year, it also act=
ed as a sort of concierge service for Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay and Ind=
ia's national security adviser, Brajesh Mishra.=20
A June e-mail sent from the NSC said Mishra would "be willing to meet with =
Mr. Lay and the bankers . . . but only at the residence. Pls. let me know y=
our decision on this soonest." A second e-mail, also originating in the NSC=
, added, "We are not involved in arranging any meetings for Mr. Lay. . . . =
I will ask the Indians if he is invited to the dinner. Also, the Indians di=
d not agree to see the lenders. I will go at them again, but if they come a=
round it might be for a Friday meeting and not the dinner."
The efforts to get an audience with Indian officials for Lay and the banker=
s over the company's Dabhol power plant were detailed in documents released=
 last week by the government-funded Overseas Private Investment Corp. under=
 a Freedom of Information Act request. They provide a glimpse of a governme=
nt function normally conducted in secret to avoid political embarrassment f=
or foreign governments that face U.S. pressure on behalf of American corpor=
ations.=20
Susan Schwab, a Commerce Department official from the first Bush administra=
tion and now dean of the University of Maryland's School of Public Affairs,=
 said she was surprised that the commercial advocacy has become "one where =
it's not the State Department or Commerce Department but the NSC leading th=
e working group."=20
Daniel Tarullo, a Georgetown University law professor who oversaw internati=
onal economics issues for President Bill Clinton's National Economic Counci=
l, concurred that "the norm would have been NSC participation in a discussi=
on rather than NSC chairing it."=20
That change is symbolic of the heightened government priority on aiding com=
mercial interests overseas. The effort, which expanded in the first Bush ad=
ministration and in the Clinton administration, is evolving to a more expli=
cit link to national security as the Bush administration elevates ties betw=
een the NSC and economic and commercial considerations.=20
"It's a new definition of national interest that embodies the national econ=
omic interest," Schwab said. "It's not as blatant as 'what's good for Gener=
al Motors is good for America,' but it's the globalized version of that."=
=20
The trend grew after the end of the Cold War, when it appeared American com=
panies were not competitive with the Japanese and others. "It was a sense t=
hat our strategic position was at stake," said Leon Fuerth, who was securit=
y adviser to Vice President Al Gore. U.S. multinationals came to be seen as=
 "agents of American national power."=20
Under the Clinton administration, U.S. diplomats were evaluated on their pe=
rformance in cooperating with American business, according to Stuart E. Eiz=
enstat, who held a senior post in the State Department. "This was a major a=
ctivity and something they were expected to engage in," he said.=20
Even back then, Enron received a disproportionate share of government help =
-- not necessarily because of the company's political connections but becau=
se of its bold expansion into emerging markets. "With the possibility of Bo=
eing, there is no U.S. company I had more interaction with, involved in mor=
e projects abroad [and] had more of a call on our time than Enron," Eizenst=
at said.=20
The effort, which decelerated after Sept. 11, may have peaked last year wit=
h U.S. support for Enron in its dispute with India. At times it was difficu=
lt to separate Enron interests from national interests. In late August, Lay=
, frustrated with progress in India, told the Financial Times: "There are U=
.S. laws that could prevent the U.S. government from providing any aid or a=
ssistance to India going forward if, in fact, they expropriate property of =
U.S. companies."=20
At the time, Enron was seeking $2.3 billion for itself and its lenders to s=
ell its 65 percent interest in the Dabhol plant, which had been mired for y=
ears in a dispute with its main customer, an Indian state government. "If t=
hey try to squeeze us down to something less than cost, then it basically b=
ecomes an expropriation by the Indian government," Lay told the newspaper.=
=20
The chief minister of Maharashtra state in India decried "the strong-arm ta=
ctics of Enron" he interpreted in Lay's words. Just two weeks before, the U=
nited States had indicated that it might lift sanctions imposed on India fo=
r earlier nuclear tests.=20
Enron issued a statement the next day saying Lay "was merely referring to U=
.S. laws" and was not issuing a threat. Lay sent a letter to Indian Prime M=
inister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to say "I have not asked anyone in the U.S. go=
vernment to consider sanctions. I did not say that the Dabhol power issue h=
ad been expropriated."=20
The administration correspondence released last week suggested various over=
laps between Enron and U.S. efforts in India. A July 30 memo to the "Dabhol=
 Working Group" in the administration listed among the actions taken in Jul=
y that "Enron Chairman Ken Lay visited India" and met various government of=
ficials. The Dabhol working group's plans in August included an "Enron trip=
" to a location that was blacked out on the document before the government =
released the information.=20
September's actions by the Dabhol group were to include a visit by U.S. Tra=
de Representative Robert B. Zoellick to India; Zoellick had been a paid con=
sultant to Enron before joining the administration. Zoellick has since said=
 he did not raise the issue. The group also planned to make use of a visit =
to the United Nations in September by Vajpayee.=20
The NSC working group coordinated a push at the highest levels of governmen=
t. Vice President Cheney, as reported, brought up the matter with Sonia Gan=
dhi, leader of India's Congress Party. The e-mail exchanges indicate Cheney=
 planned to raise the matter again on Oct. 3 with India's foreign minister.=
 A list of "Dabhol talking points" for Cheney's meeting with the minister w=
ere "passed to Veep's staff for inclusion" by the NSC. The minister, Jaswan=
t Singh, heard again from the administration in October, when Undersecretar=
y of State Alan P. Larson raised Dabhol.=20
Last weekend, the State Department disclosed that Secretary of State Colin =
L. Powell had discussed the Dabhol project on April 6 in a meeting with Sin=
gh. According to an account provided by State, Powell told his Indian count=
erpart that "failure to resolve the matter could have a serious deterrent e=
ffect on other investors."=20
Before the November meeting between Vajpayee and Bush, at which Bush was to=
 raise the subject of Dabhol, an e-mail apparently from the NSC to the Over=
seas Private Investment Corp. suggested a resolution was close. It asked: "=
Do you still want to sign an MOU [memorandum of understanding] with the Ind=
ians or announce one during Vajpayee's visit?" Plans for Bush to raise the =
subject were scratched as Enron's problems became public.=20
The administration continues to talk about Dabhol, even after Enron's bankr=
uptcy filing. Larson mentioned it with the Indians during a visit to New De=
lhi last week with Powell.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE SECRETARY
Army Chief Being Challenged on Ties to Company
By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS

The New York Times
Page 6, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON, Jan. 24 -- When Thomas E. White was chosen last spring to becom=
e secretary of the Army, administration officials portrayed his nomination =
as part of an effort to bring corporate discipline to the Pentagon.=20
Mr. White, who had been vice chairman of Enron Energy Services, arrived wit=
h a boardroom boast that he and his private-sector colleagues were the new =
''C.E.O.'s of wholly owned subsidiaries of the Department of Defense.''
But now an advocacy group founded by Ralph Nader contends that Mr. White's =
business dealings present a conflict of interest. The group, Public Citizen=
, is raising questions while Congress investigates the collapse of the Enro=
n Corporation, which has filed for bankruptcy protection.=20
Mr. White, through a spokesman, denied any wrongdoing.=20
Public Citizen this week accused Mr. White of taking action to benefit Enro=
n within weeks of becoming Army secretary. In remarks to the media in June,=
 Mr. White vowed to accelerate efforts to privatize energy utilities servin=
g the military.=20
The privatization effort had slowed while California's energy crisis unfold=
ed, but Enron continued to promote the program. Mr. White himself had lobbi=
ed on its behalf while at Enron, and in 1999 the energy division had been a=
warded a contract worth $25 million over 10 years to provide energy to Fort=
 Hamilton in Brooklyn, Public Citizen said.=20
''It's a huge conflict of interest,'' said Tyson Slocum, the group's resear=
ch director. At the time of Mr. White's confirmation as Army secretary, Mr.=
 Slocum said, Enron had seven bids pending at the Pentagon.=20
A spokesman for Mr. White denied today that Mr. White had behaved inappropr=
iately. The secretary had explicitly excused himself from decisions affecti=
ng Enron, but he was determined to advance efforts to privatize Defense Dep=
artment services and save taxpayers money, said the spokesman, Lt. Col. Rya=
n Yantis.=20
As part of a government ethics agreement, Mr. White was compelled to sell h=
is shares in Enron. He was given 90 days to do so, then received an extensi=
on that gave him until Nov. 20 to complete the sale. He sold the last of hi=
s shares for $13 each in mid-October, just before the company disclosed the=
 problems that led to its bankruptcy filing.=20
Mr. White acknowledged having contacts with Enron employees since last June=
, including a call with Kenneth L. Lay, the chairman and chief executive, i=
n September, but he called them personal in nature.=20
Administration officials voiced confidence in Mr. White, and Congress membe=
rs investigating the Enron collapse say they have no evidence that he acted=
 in bad faith during his 11 years as an Enron executive or subsequently.=20
Mr. White, in a letter to one investigator, Representative Henry A. Waxman,=
 Democrat of California, noted this week that he had incurred ''significant=
 personal losses'' in the Enron bankruptcy.=20
In the letter, which responded to questions by Mr. Waxman, Mr. White said h=
e had briefly discussed Enron with Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld in Nov=
ember and with Secretary of State Colin L. Powell last month.=20
''The nature of both conversations was a concern on their part for the impa=
ct that the bankruptcy of Enron may have had on my personal well-being,'' M=
r. White wrote. ''My response in both cases was that I had suffered signifi=
cant personal losses, but that I would persevere.''=20
Mr. White also detailed the 30 contacts he had with Enron employees since l=
ast June, involving both phone calls and personal meetings. The contacts in=
cluded a telephone conversation on Sept. 10 with Mr. Lay.=20
Mr. White initiated the call to Mr. Lay ''to wish him luck as he assumed hi=
s new duties as C.E.O. of Enron,'' Mr. White's letter said. The contacts wi=
th other Enron officials, he said, were all ''personal in nature, with thei=
r inquiring about my progress as Secretary of the Army and my inquiring abo=
ut their personal challenges as they dealt with Enron's deteriorating finan=
cial conditions.''=20
Mr. White added that ''at no time'' did Mr. Lay or any other Enron employee=
 ask him to intercede with federal officials on Enron's behalf.=20
Mr. Waxman, the ranking Democrat on the Government Reform and Oversight Com=
mittee, is still studying Mr. White's letter, aides said, and was not avail=
able for comment.=20
A review of Mr. White's financial disclosure information shows that he amas=
sed a considerable fortune while working for Enron.=20
According to his filings in May, Mr. White last received a salary of $5.5 m=
illion at Enron and owned homes in Naples, Fla., and Aspen, Colo., valued a=
t more than $5 million each. He bought a $5.5 million penthouse in Washingt=
on last June.=20
Mr. White held more Enron stock than any other senior official joining the =
Bush administration. According to the disclosure forms, he held $25 million=
 to $50 million in Enron shares, $25 million to $50 million in stock option=
s and $5 million to $25 million in a phantom stock award, which is a promis=
e to pay a future bonus in appreciated stock or its cash equivalent.=20
To comply with the ethics agreement, Mr. White was compelled to sell 405,71=
0 shares of Enron. He made the sales, from June 13 to Oct. 14, 2001, as the=
 value of Enron stock steadily diminished. For example, he sold 92,000 shar=
es at $50 in mid-June and 86,709 shares at $13 in October.=20
In his letter, Mr. White said he had sold all of his Enron stock and had re=
nounced his stock options.

THE NATION With the Theater or PACs, Texans Saw Kenneth Lay as 'On Top of t=

HOUSTON -- For all his clout in Washington, Kenneth L. Lay's greatest influ=
ence was back home in Texas where the mirror-sheathed Enron headquarters bu=
ilding glimmers above the Houston skyline.=20
Operating here in his home base, Lay--who resigned Wednesday night as chair=
man of the once high-flying energy trading company he founded--was a kingma=
ker who could create or crush political careers, spearhead professional spo=
rts stadium drives, finance youth clubs and endow theater troupes.
"This was a man on top of the world. It was well known that if you needed s=
omething done you went to Ken Lay," recalled Felix Fraga, a former Houston =
city councilman who has known Lay more than 30 years. "He could have run fo=
r mayor, governor, or done anything he wanted."=20
As part of President Bush's celebrated "pioneers" club, Lay and his wife, L=
inda, donated more than $145,000 to the national Republican Party and the B=
ush campaign. The Lays also contributed $100,000 to the Bush inaugural gala=
 and $10,000 to the election recount fund.=20
But in Texas, where his money was less diluted, state Ethics Commission rec=
ords show Lay gave $55,000 to one state Senate campaign alone. Other large =
contributions graced the coffers of Gov. Rick Perry, Atty. Gen. John Cornyn=
 and Houston Mayor Lee P. Brown, for whom Lay sponsored a $50,000 fund-rais=
er Oct. 8.=20
However, in a sign that Enron fortunes were already on a slide, Brown campa=
ign finance director Sue Walden said Lay failed to show up for the fund-rai=
ser and never sent a check.=20
Always the Go-To Guy=20
Over the years, Texas officeholders ranging from Houston City Council membe=
rs to state railroad commissioners benefited from Lay's political largess.=
=20
"Ken Lay was a guy with swagger and loot who bought his way into whatever n=
eeded buying," said Texas populist politician and commentator Jim Hightower=
. "He had this aura of being bulletproof, a corporate superstar who was rea=
l connected to the Bushes."=20
After Lay's spectacular fall from power and grace, the extent of Lay's and =
Enron's insertion into Texas government only now is surfacing.=20
The first casualty was Texas Public Utilities Commission chairman Max Yzagu=
irre, a former Enron executive Lay helped get appointed as the state's chie=
f utility regulator. Yzaguirre, tainted by his Enron connections, resigned =
his post Jan. 17.=20
Others caught in the backwash of the Enron collapse are Perry, who received=
 a $25,000 contribution from Lay the day after he appointed Yzaguirre to di=
rect the PUC; Cornyn, a U.S. Senate candidate who reversed an earlier posit=
ion and recused himself from the state Enron investigation because of donat=
ions he received from Lay and Enron; and Texas elected Supreme Court Justic=
e Priscilla Owens, whose appointment by Bush to the U.S. 5th Circuit Court =
of Appeals now is in jeopardy because of Enron contributions she received b=
eginning in 1995 and decisions she made favoring the company.=20
According to Rice University political scientist Bob Stein, Lay displayed a=
 particular genius for picking out politicians on the rise.=20
"These were investments about where these guys were going, not necessarily =
where they were at the time," Stein said. "Ken Lay was a big supporter of B=
ush probably before Bush himself knew he was running for president."=20
According to the Austin-based watchdog group Texans for Public Justice, the=
 Lays personally donated $122,000 to Bush's two gubernatorial campaigns. Si=
milarly, Lay was an early backer of Cornyn, even before the Republican atto=
rney general announced his candidacy for the seat to be vacated by Republic=
an Sen. Phil Gramm, who is retiring after this year's elections.=20
Payroll Deductions to the Company PAC=20
Gramm, whose economist wife served as a paid member of the Enron board of d=
irectors, is caught up in the vortex because of the tens of thousands of do=
llars he received in contributions from Enron and Lay.=20
Enron's system for political contributions operated on two fronts. Employee=
s were encouraged to give money to candidates believed to be supportive of =
company issues, particularly those involving market deregulation central to=
 the energy trading business.=20
Additionally, top executives were tapped for what amounted to a tithe to th=
e Enron Political Action Committee, one of the country's biggest corporate =
political PACs. A percentage of each executive's paycheck was withheld from=
 every biweekly pay period. For example, Joe Allen, Enron vice president fo=
r state government affairs, gave $83.34 every two weeks to the Enron PAC, f=
or an annual total of $2,166. Other executives gave much more.=20
The money primarily was used to fund campaigns of candidates for Congress, =
particularly those with key energy-related positions. According to document=
s on file with the Texas Ethics Commission, the Enron PAC collected $336,00=
0 from executives in 2001.=20
But not all of Lay's and Enron's munificence was reserved for major politic=
al offices, nor was it limited to politics.=20
Spreading Wealth Among Nonprofits=20
One of the largest political contributions Lay made in 2001 was for a state=
 Senate race in the Piney Woods of rural East Texas. In that race, one of t=
he most expensive legislative races ever undertaken in Texas, Democratic tr=
ial lawyer David Marsh was pitted against Republican businessman/rancher To=
dd Staples.=20
The race became a key contest for the Houston-based Texans for Lawsuit Refo=
rm, a conservative movement Lay supports that seeks to limit lawsuits. Stap=
les won, backed by $55,000 in contributions from Lay.=20
Even in the grandest Texas tradition of alms giving and support for the art=
s, few have surpassed Lay and his company.=20
The Lays and Enron were prominent givers to virtually every important Houst=
on charity ranging from a new cancer ward at the city's famous M.D. Anderso=
n Hospital to support for the Houston Ballet.=20
Lay encouraged giving by offering matching funds for as much as $15,000 for=
 each employee. The results often were spectacular. Enron's 7,500 employees=
 alone, led by Lay with a $100,000 pledge, accounted for $5.5 million of th=
e $75 million raised by the Houston United Way campaign.=20
"Enron was a visible leader in the charity world," said Houston Ballet mana=
ging director Cecil C. Conner, whose troupe received a $10,000 gift from th=
e Lays. "It helped make this city a vibrant, important city, not just an oi=
l town. We have lost a leading voice."=20
Occasionally, Lay's influence went beyond money.=20
When former City Councilman Fraga, 72, a longtime social worker and promine=
nt leader in the Latino community, found himself snared in a 1997 FBI bribe=
ry sting operation that sent another councilman to jail, Lay was one of the=
 prominent Houstonians who wrote a letter in Fraga's support.=20
After returning the $2,000 offered by two undercover agents, Fraga never wa=
s charged.=20
But Lay may be missed most as a civic leader. He served a term as president=
 of the Greater Houston Partnership, the city's influential super-chamber o=
f commerce. Before that he served as head of the Board of Regents at the Un=
iversity of Houston, where he received his graduate education.=20
According to political scientist Stein, Lay was instrumental in the revival=
 of Houston's historically moribund downtown, including the successful refe=
rendums to build stadiums for baseball and basketball/hockey, the building =
of a light rail line connecting Houston's renowned medical center complex t=
o downtown and development of the theater district.=20
"Ken Lay was a great promoter of the city," Stein said. "His business was b=
ased on attracting productive capital and labor, and when it worked, it wor=
ked to make the city a more attractive place to live."=20
Scrambling for a New Look=20
But even this legacy already is fading, as Lay's and Enron's woes continue =
to deepen. On a recent afternoon in Houston's gritty 2nd Ward District, the=
 Enron Boys and Girls Club, renovated with $500,000 in Enron donations, was=
 busy changing its name. The Enron logo on the center of the newly resurfac=
ed basketball court was being sanded off and replaced with the new sponsor'=
s name: Holt House.=20
"We've already got us a new sponsor," said club director Glen Sherrod, show=
ing a reporter a roomful of new computers donated by Enron.=20
In a statement issued Thursday, Mayor Brown made no mention of Lay's role i=
n rebuilding the city.=20
"My fervent hope," Brown said, "is that Enron is able to hire a CEO who can=
 put the company back in a position to rehire its employees and remain a vi=
able part of the business community."

Spreading It Around

c. 2002 New York Times Company

A bizarre thing happened to me over the past week: Conservative newspapers =
and columnists made a concerted effort to portray me as a guilty party in t=
he Enron scandal. Why? Because in 1999, before coming to The New York Times=
, I was briefly paid to serve on an Enron advisory board.=20
Never mind that, scrupulously following the Times conflict of interest rule=
s, I resigned from that board as soon as I agreed to write for this newspap=
er -- making me much more fastidious than, say, William Kristol, who served=
 on that same board while editing The Weekly Standard. Never mind that I di=
sclosed that past connection a year ago, the first time I wrote about Enron=
 in this column -- and also disclosed it the one time I mentioned Enron bef=
ore, in a Fortune column. Never mind that the compensation I received per d=
ay was actually somewhat less than other companies were paying me at the ti=
me for speeches on world economic issues.
And never mind that when I started writing in this column about issues of c=
oncern to Enron -- in particular, criticizing the role that market manipula=
tion by energy companies played in the California power crisis -- my positi=
on was not at all what the company wanted to hear. (Compare this with the b=
oard member Lawrence Kudlow, a commentator for National Review and CNBC. He=
 wrote vehemently in favor of the Cheney energy plan -- and has called this=
 the ''Clinton-Levitt recession,'' blaming Arthur Levitt, the former Securi=
ties and Exchange Commission chairman, who tried to fight the accounting la=
xity that made Enron possible.)=20
Yet reading those attacks, you would think that I was a major-league white-=
collar criminal.=20
It's tempting to take this vendetta as a personal compliment: Some people a=
re so worried about the effect of my writing that they will try anything to=
 get me off this page. But actually it was part of a broader effort by cons=
ervatives to sling Enron muck toward their left, hoping that some of it wou=
ld stick.=20
A few days ago Tim Noah published a very funny piece in Slate about this ef=
fort, titled ''Blaming liberalism for Enron.'' (Full disclosure: I used to =
write a column for Slate -- and Slate is owned by Microsoft. So I guess tha=
t makes me a Bill Gates crony. I even shook his hand once.) It describes th=
e strategies conservative pundits have used to shift the blame for the Enro=
n scandal onto the other side of the political spectrum.=20
Among the ploys: Enron was in favor of the Kyoto treaty, because it thought=
 it could make money trading emission permits; see, environmentalism is the=
 villain. Or how about this: Enron made money by exploiting the quirks of e=
lectricity markets that had been only partly deregulated; see, regulation i=
s the villain.=20
And, of course -- you knew this was coming -- it's all a reflection of Clin=
ton-era moral decline. Traditionally, as we all know, Texas businessmen and=
 politicians were models of probity; they never cooked their books or engag=
ed in mutual back-scratching.=20
One doubts that the people putting out this stuff really expect to convince=
 anyone. But they do hope to muddy the waters. If they can get a little bit=
 of Enron dirt on everyone -- the Clinton administration, environmentalists=
, liberal columnists -- the stain on people and ideas they support will be =
less noticeable.=20
Why is Enron a problem for conservatives? Even if the Bush administration t=
urns out to be squeaky clean, which we'll never know unless it starts to be=
 more forthcoming, the scandal threatens perceptions that the right has spe=
nt decades creating. After all that effort to discredit concerns about the =
gap between haves and have-nots as obsolete ''class warfare,'' along comes =
a real-life story that reads like a leftist morality play: wealthy executiv=
es make off with millions while ordinary workers lose their jobs and their =
life savings. After all that effort to convince people that the private sec=
tor can police itself, the most admired company in America turns out to hav=
e been a giant Ponzi scheme -- and the most respected accounting firm turns=
 out to have been an accomplice.=20
You might think that the shock of the Enron scandal -- and it is shocking, =
even to us hardened cynics -- would make some conservatives reconsider thei=
r beliefs. But the die-hards prefer to sling muck at liberals, hoping it wi=
ll stick.=20
Sorry, guys; I'm clean. The muck stops here.

Enron Fraud: Appoint a Special Prosecutor

Copyright 2002 / The Times Mirror Company

Re Enron: Let's get this straight. Fraud is fraud.=20
Enron executives have conspired with their auditors to cook the books to wi=
ldly inflate profits and stock prices, failed to report illegal transaction=
s, broken multiple rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and then=
 instituted a cover-up by a massive destruction of files and evidence. The =
result has been literally billions of dollars of losses to investors and th=
e virtual destruction of employee 401(k)s, while they manipulated their per=
sonal stock options and walked away with millions in illegal profits.
Our attorney general, the overly pious John Ashcroft, has excused himself f=
or conflicts of interest, as has the entire federal prosecutor's office in =
Houston. The administration is staffed by multiple "graduates" of Enron and=
 is tainted by massive campaign contributions, as are large numbers of repr=
esentatives and senators of both parties. Isn't it time for a special prose=
cutor?=20

Regarding all the calls I see for a special prosecutor in the Enron case, w=
ith its ties to the Bush administration, I can only say this: a special pro=
secutor for what?=20
Until someone can make some sort of illegal connection between the two ther=
e is nothing but guilt by association.=20
When a special prosecutor was assigned to the Whitewater matter, at least t=
here was evidence of a shady land deal and inappropriate pressure being put=
 on people by then-Gov. Clinton to make improper loans, for example.=20
No linkage of this sort has been made between Enron and President Bush.=20
And until a linkage is made, all these shouts and murmurs for a prosecutor =
are nothing but shameless partisanship.=20
Richard Vaczy=20
Los Angeles=20
*=20
I came away from "Why Insiders Get Rich and the Little Guy Pays" (Opinion, =
Jan. 20) ashamed to be a little guy. While we're busy vilifying the fat cat=
s at Enron and other larcenous corporations for sticking it to us, it might=
 be wise for us "littles" to examine our own culpability in the sticking.=
=20
Union membership is at historical lows; we allow our representatives to gre=
en-light monopolistic mergers, and we continue to elect politicians who ign=
ore or undermine real campaign finance reform.=20
Until we start protecting ourselves from corporate avarice, we will continu=
e to be perfect "little" victims.=20
Russell Buchanan=20
Woodland Hills=20
*=20
I fail to understand why President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney are =
trying to distance themselves from former Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay.=20
Lay is without question an exemplar of Republican values. Having taken adva=

r the consequences, this role model of Republican values is at least due a =
presidential commendation.=20
Chris Hopkins=20
Los Angeles=20
*=20
Is it a coincidence that both Enron and its auditing firm Andersen started =
massive document shredding operations about the same time? It may be a conc=
erted effort to make sure that all the documents no longer exist. The inves=
tigation will be greatly hindered without documents to support the allegati=
ons, especially of criminal wrongdoing.=20
Welcome to the new economy highly touted by this administration.=20

Business Spin; It's just like political spin, only not quite as dishonest.
Michael Kinsley

FINAL

How could the chairman of Enron have been telling his employees that they s=
hould buy the company's stock at the same time he was selling it? How could=
 Ken Lay have been saying that the company was in great shape when he had a=
 report from one of his vice presidents saying it most definitely wasn't?=
=20
Well, it might have been an innocent mistake. You don't need to believe eve=
ry report that crosses your desk. If some of your own actions had slipped y=
our mind, you might find them as hard to believe as anyone else would. And =
you might be selling your stock for reasons other than concern that it migh=
t be about to tank.
So now that we've gotten the presumption of innocence out of the way, let's=
 consider two other possibilities. One is that he was lying. The other is t=
hat he was spinning. What's the difference? It's often said that there is n=
one. (Come to think of it, I've said this myself.) But there is: Lying mean=
s flouting the truth. Spinning means indifference to the truth. The culture=
 of spin is one in which the relation between what you're saying and what h=
appens to be true is a question that doesn't even arise. This doesn't make =
spin less objectionable. In fact, it's more objectionable precisely because=
 it's culturally ingrained. We all know that it's wrong to lie. The signals=
 we send and receive about spin are very different.=20
The political equivalent of Ken Lay would be a politician who insisted he w=
as going to win the election even though all the polls showed him heading f=
or near-certain defeat. In the political world, though, spin is not merely =
tolerated: It is required. It is regarded as a basic test of competence.=20
Tim Russert: Senator, you're down by 40 points in every poll. Your opponent=
 is openly consulting real-estate agents in Washington. Your own dog called=
 a news conference yesterday to demand that you withdraw from the race. Are=
 you going to lose?=20
Politician: No, Tim, it'll be a tough fight -- make no mistake about that -=
- but I'm confident that . . . blah blah blah. And my cat is behind me 100 =
percent.=20
The purpose of such exchanges is not to elicit the truth, but to see how we=
ll the politician can spin. If he admits that he's probably going to lose, =
he flunks. If he survives the barrage with his preposterous optimism and po=
ker face unbroken, he wins.=20
But this example is entry-level spin. It shows a basic willingness to ignor=
e reality, but no special effort or talent in creating an alternative reali=
ty. The other difference between lying and spinning is that while lying is =
often spontaneous, spinning usually involves advanced planning. There are a=
 few naturally gifted improvisational spinners, such as the brilliant White=
 House spokesman, Ari Fleischer. Characteristically, though, spin does not =
wing it. Often spin production is an industrial process involving many peop=
le, maybe or maybe not including the person who ultimately delivers it.=20
In recent years the Washington spin industry has invaded the corporate worl=
d, as professional spinmeisters who learned their craft from politicians (o=
r who actually used to be politicians) have come to realize that big compan=
ies are just as spinologically needy as politicians and have more money. Of=
 course, the corporate world is where PR and advertising were invented -- t=
wo activities that also strain the relationship between assertion and truth=
. But in some ways spin, or at least untruthful spin, remains less acceptab=
le in the corporate world than in politics.=20
One reason for this is that in spinning a commercial product -- which goes =
by the polite name of "marketing" -- the mountain can come to Mohammed. Tha=
t is, you can design the product around the spin rather than design the spi=
n around the product. John Kenneth Galbraith argued 35 years ago in "The Ne=
w Industrial State" that corporations often create the demand for their pro=
ducts rather than satisfy hungers that already exist. Controversial at the =
time, this now seems obvious. And when marketing is paramount, the product =
itself is secondary. Oddly, this makes it easier for corporate spin to be t=
ruthful: You can decide what you want to say and build reality around it. B=
usinesspeople used to marketing sometimes trip up when they forget that rea=
lity is less malleable in non-marketing situations.=20
Spin is also illegal in many corporate circumstances where it would be lega=
l, acceptable and even expected in politics. If a corporate insider knows s=
omething important about the company's future, he or she not only may not s=
ay something that directly contradicts the truth -- in most circumstances t=
hey may not even spin by silence. Imagine if politicians were under that ki=
nd of legal requirement! And why aren't they? Well, obviously because money=
 is at stake with the business executive whereas nothing depends on the pol=
itician's truthfulness except democracy.=20
In the pervasive culture of spin, it's possible that Ken Lay was describing=
 a reality he wanted without even considering the relation of what he was s=
aying to reality as we actually experience it. If so, his mistake was forge=
tting that he's not a politician.=20

ENRON'S COLLAPSE
Excerpts From a House Hearing on Destruction of Enron Documents

01/25/2002
The New York Times
Page 8, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

Following are excerpts from remarks at a hearing yesterday before the House=
 Energy and Commerce Committee on the destruction of documents related to t=
he Enron Corporation, as recorded by the Federal Document Clearing House, a=
 private transcription service. The speakers included Representatives James=
 C. Greenwood, Peter Deutsch, Billy Tauzin and Diana DeGette; the Arthur An=
dersen officials C. E. Andrews, Dorsey L. Baskin and Nancy Temple; and Davi=
d B. Duncan, a former partner at Arthur Andersen.=20
REPRESENTATIVE GREENWOOD -- The chair will now call the first panel.=20
Mr. Duncan, will you please come forward? Please be seated right there. Tha=
nk you, sir.=20
Good morning, Mr. Duncan.
DAVID DUNCAN -- Morning.=20
MR. GREENWOOD -- Mr. Duncan is here with us today under subpoena. To date, =
Mr. Duncan has cooperated with this committee in our search for the facts b=
y submitting to an interview last week with our committee investigator that=
 lasted more than four hours.=20
Yet, we received a letter from his counsel yesterday stating that Mr. Dunca=
n authorized his counsel to advise the committee that he will, quote, ''rel=
y on his constitutional right not to testify,'' close quote.=20
I believe that this privilege should be personally exercised by, before the=
 members, and that's why we have requested Mr. Duncan's appearance here tod=
ay and request that he reconsider.=20
Mr. Duncan, you are aware that the committee is holding an investigative he=
aring and that, when doing so, we have the practice of taking testimony und=
er oath. Do you have objection to testifying under oath?=20
MR. DUNCAN -- No, sir.=20
MR. GREENWOOD -- Thank you.=20
The chair also advises you that, under the rules of the House and the rules=
 of the committee, you are entitled to be advised by counsel.=20
Do you desire to be advised by counsel during your testimony today?=20
MR. DUNCAN -- Yes, sir.=20
MR. GREENWOOD -- O.K. In that case, would you please rise and raise your ri=
ght hand, and I will swear you in.=20
Mr. Duncan, do you swear that you will tell -- the testimony you will give =
this committee is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?=20
MR. DUNCAN -- Yes, I do.=20
MR. GREENWOOD -- Thank you, Mr. Duncan. You are now under oath, and you may=
 give a five-minute summary of your written testimony if you choose to.=20
MR. DUNCAN -- I have no summary, sir.=20
MR. GREENWOOD -- O.K. The chair will recognize himself for questioning.=20
Mr. Duncan, Enron robbed the bank. Arthur Andersen provided the getaway car=
, and they say you were at the wheel.=20
I have a specific question for you, Mr. Duncan. You were fired by Andersen =
last week for orchestrating an expedited effort among the Andersen-Enron en=
gagement team to destroy thousands of paper documents and electronic files =
relating to the Enron matter after learning of an inquiry by the Securities=
 and Exchange Commission into Enron's complex financial transactions.=20
Did you give an order to destroy documents in an attempt to subvert governm=
ental investigations into Enron's financial collapse? And if so, did you do=
 so at the direction or suggestion of anyone at Andersen or at Enron?=20
MR. DUNCAN -- Mr. Chairman, I would like to answer the committee's question=
s, but on the advice of my counsel I respectfully decline to answer the que=
stion based on the protection afforded me under the Constitution of the Uni=
ted States.=20
MR. GREENWOOD -- Let me be clear, Mr. Duncan. Are you refusing to answer th=
e question on the basis of the protections afforded to you under the Fifth =
Amendment to the United States Constitution?=20
MR. DUNCAN -- Again, on the advice of my counsel, I respectfully decline to=
 answer the question based on the protection afforded me under the United S=
tates Constitution.=20
MR. GREENWOOD -- Will you invoke your Fifth Amendment rights in response to=
 all of our questions here today?=20
MR. DUNCAN -- Respectfully, that will be my response to all your questions.=
=20
MR. GREENWOOD -- I'm disappointed to hear that, but it is therefore the cha=
ir's intention to dismiss the witness.=20
Mr. Duncan, we thank you for your attendance today and your respect for thi=
s committee's process. You are dismissed, and perhaps we will see you on an=
other occasion.=20
MR. DUNCAN -- Yes, sir. . . .=20
MR. GREENWOOD -- I think it is very important to lay out for the subcommitt=
ee, our panel and our audience our current understanding of Mr. Duncan's re=
collection of relevant events based on the committee counsel's interview of=
 Mr. Duncan last week.=20
It is my understanding that Mr. Duncan said that, in the September and Octo=
ber time period, he participated in frequent meetings and teleconferences w=
ith a group of senior-level Andersen partners in Houston and Chicago to dis=
cuss matters relating to the Enron account.=20
That group included Ms. Nancy Temple from the legal group and Mr. Michael O=
dom, the audit practice director, both of whom are testifying today.=20
The consultation group, which was created in late August or early September=
, was fluid in membership and was formed in response to growing concerns ov=
er the accounting for Enron's special-purpose entities.=20
Specifically, Mr. Duncan said that the group was formed at the suggestion o=
f Mr. Odom and himself in response to, one, Sherron Watkins' allegations of=
 accounting improprieties on the Enron Raptor and LJM transactions; two, th=
e $1 billion accounting error discovered in August by Enron and Andersen wi=
th respect to the accounting for the Raptor entities; and, three, the rapid=
ly declining stock price of the Enron merchant assets transferred to the Ra=
ptor partnerships, which made it look like there would be a significant wri=
te-down by Enron.=20
During these conference calls prior to Oct. 12, 2001, Mr. Duncan recalls re=
ceiving advice from Ms. Temple with respect to the proper documentation of =
Andersen's evolving position with respect to the correct accounting for the=
 Raptor transactions.=20
Also, prior to receiving Ms. Temple's Oct. 12 e-mail regarding compliance w=
ith Andersen's documentation retention policy, Mr. Duncan recalls Ms. Templ=
e, on one or two of these three group conference calls, asking him, quote, =
''How are you on compliance with the document retention policy on Enron?'' =
He said that his response to her was, ''At best, irregular.''=20
Mr. Duncan then received Ms. Temple's Oct. 12 e-mail, forwarding from Mr. O=
dom with a note, quote, ''More help,'' close quote. He did not know what Mr=
. Odom meant by that phrase, but he viewed Ms. Temple's e-mail as a follow-=
up to the question she had posed to him orally about compliance with the re=
tention policy and as a device from his attorney to ensure that the entire =
Enron audit engagement team was in compliance with that policy.=20
He added that he had never before, during his lengthy tenure at Andersen, b=
een asked about compliance with the retention policy, nor had he ever recei=
ved such an e-mail about ensuring compliance with that policy from anyone i=
n Andersen's legal group.=20
Mr. Duncan does not recall the precise date, but sometime after Oct. 12, 20=
01, Mr. Duncan met with his top Enron audit partners, Mr. Tom Bauer, Ms. De=
bra Cash and Mr. Roger Willard, to discuss the advice he had received from =
Ms. Temple.=20
According to Mr. Duncan, the meeting participants concluded that they shoul=
d call a meeting of all the Enron audit managers to discuss timely complian=
ce with the retention policy.=20
Mr. Duncan does not recall when this meeting occurred but does not dispute =
that his secretary sent out an e-mail on Oct. 23, 2001, calling an urgent m=
eeting of the Enron managers for later that same day.=20
Just days earlier, on either Friday, Oct. 19, or Saturday, Oct. 20, Mr. Dun=
can had first learned of the S.E.C. informal inquiry of Enron. He recalled =
that he had discussions with the Andersen consultation group about the S.E.=
C. development over the weekend, including Ms. Temple.=20
He also recalled that on Oct. 22 he and other Andersen engagement team memb=
ers met with Enron chief accounting officer Rick Causey to discuss the S.E.=
C. inquiry. Duncan said that Causey requested Andersen's assistance in crea=
ting documents to explain the related party transactions to the S.E.C.=20
Mr. Duncan said that at the meeting he called with all the Andersen audit m=
anagers on the Enron account, whenever it may have occurred, he advised the=
m of the importance of compliance with the document retention policy and ha=
nded out copies of the policy to participants.=20
Mr. Duncan said that he observed individuals on the engagement team activel=
y complying with the firm's document policies by shredding documents, and t=
hat the activity continued up until the 9th of November, when he received a=
 voice mail from Ms. Temple ordering the preservation of all Enron-related =
documents.=20
Mr. Duncan also said that he destroyed some of his own Enron-related docume=
nts in an effort to comply with Andersen's document retention and destructi=
on policies.=20
Again, that is my understanding of Mr. Duncan's interview with committee st=
aff.=20
Mr. Deutsch, would you agree that I have characterized our current understa=
nding of Mr. Duncan's recollection of relevant events accurately? . . .=20
MR. DEUTSCH -- I would.=20
MR. GREENWOOD -- Thank you.=20
MR. BASKIN -- My name is Dorsey Lee Baskin Jr.=20
Since 1999, I have been managing director of Andersen's assurance professio=
nal standards group, which has firm-wide responsibility for providing guida=
nce on auditing standards, including professional standards relating to the=
 preservation of audit work papers and client files. I've been at Andersen =
for almost 25 years, since receiving my M.B.A. from Texas A&M University in=
 1977.=20
I'm here with my partner, C. E. Andrews, who is managing partner for Anders=
en's global audit practice. He and I will both answer the committee's quest=
ions.=20
I would like to make three essential points at the outset of our testimony.=
 First, as our C.E.O. has said, this is indeed a tragedy on many levels.=20
Second, the committee and the broader public should know that Andersen came=
 forward voluntarily and disclosed the destruction of documents by Andersen=
 personnel. However improper that destruction was, Andersen did not hide fr=
om its obligation to do what it could to take corrective action. We promptl=
y alerted all investigative authorities, including this committee.=20
Although the firm was well aware of the potentially devastating impact this=
 disclosure could have on our reputation, we did the right thing. We certai=
nly are not proud of the document destruction, but we are proud of our deci=
sion to step forward and accept responsibility.=20
Third, it bears emphasis that Andersen has cooperated fully and unreservedl=
y with all of the ongoing investigations into the destruction of Enron-rela=
ted documents. We are determined to get to the bottom of what happened.=20
We have publicly acknowledged, and will continue to acknowledge, mistakes t=
hat we have made. We have tried, and will continue to try, to answer every =
question that is put to us. And we will take whatever decisive action is ne=
cessary to restore public confidence in the firm.=20
I have to tell you, in all candor, that we are limited in what we can say t=
oday about the destruction of documents by Andersen personnel working on th=
e Enron engagement.=20
Our investigation into that destruction is far from complete. We have not y=
et had the opportunity to review all of the many relevant documents or to h=
ear from all of the people who have relevant information.=20
But having said that, this is what I can tell you about Andersen's retentio=
n and destruction of documents.=20
To begin with, it is the usual, routine and wholly legitimate practice of a=
uditors to preserve their final working papers while disposing of drafts, p=
ersonal notes and other materials that are not necessary to support the aud=
it report. So far as I'm aware, this is the policy of all the large account=
ing firms.=20
This policy toward document disposal reflects longstanding and sound audit =
practice. It is designed to assure that the audit work papers, which are th=
e principal materials reflecting and documenting the conclusions of the aud=
it, unambiguously reflect the judgments that actually were reached.=20
This understanding of proper audit practice was reflected in the Andersen d=
ocument retention policy in effect last fall, which provided that documents=
 other than work papers ordinarily should be disposed of when no longer nee=
ded but that such documents should be retained when litigation has commence=
d or is threatened.=20
Of course, precisely when that occurs, often we'll require the application =
of informed judgment to the particular circumstances of a given case. And t=
hat may well be a point on which reasonable people can differ.=20
As for the destruction of Enron-related documents, we know that on Oct. 23,=
 just six days after the S.E.C. requested information from Enron, David Dun=
can, Andersen's lead partner on the Enron engagement, called an urgent meet=
ing of the Enron engagement team, at which he organized an expedited effort=
 to shred or otherwise dispose of Enron-related documents.=20
This effort was undertaken without any consultation with others in the firm=
 or, so far as we are aware, with legal counsel.=20
Over the course of the next several days, a very substantial volume of docu=
ments and e-mails were disposed of by the Enron engagement team. This activ=
ity appears to have stopped shortly after Mr. Duncan's assistant sent an e-=
mail to other secretaries on Nov. 9, the day after Andersen received a subp=
oena from the S.E.C. telling them, ''No more shredding.''=20
Once this activity came to light, Andersen's response was immediate. Anders=
en notified the Department of Justice, the S.E.C. and all relevant congress=
ional committees. At the same time, the firm suspended its records manageme=
nt policy and asked former Senator Danforth to conduct an immediate and com=
prehensive review.=20
On Jan. 15, approximately two weeks after our C.E.O. learned about the docu=
ment destruction, Andersen dismissed Mr. Duncan. The firm also placed three=
 other partners from the Enron engagement on administrative leave, pending =
completion of the investigation into their responsibility for these events.=
=20
The firm relieved four partners in its Houston office of their management r=
esponsibilities, and the firm indicated that it will take disciplinary acti=
on against any Andersen personnel who are found to have acted improperly.=
=20
I should address the question, why Andersen took the forceful action it did=
 regarding Mr. Duncan. In our view, Mr. Duncan's actions reflected a failur=
e of judgment that is simply unacceptable in a person who has major respons=
ibilities at our firm.=20
He was the lead engagement partner for a significant client, exercising ver=
y substantial responsibility within the firm. Yet our investigation indicat=
ed that he directed the purposeful destruction of a very substantial volume=
 of documents just as the government investigation was beginning. This is t=
he kind of conduct that Andersen cannot tolerate.=20
When Andersen's C.E.O., Joe Berardino, testified before Congress almost six=
 weeks ago, he observed that all of us here today, and many others who are =
not here, have a responsibility to seek out and evaluate the facts and take=
 needed action.=20
We have tried to fulfill that responsibility. We uncovered the document des=
truction. Our firm's management brought it to the attention of the governme=
ntal authorities.=20
We already have started to implement decisive disciplinary and remedial act=
ion, and we're continuing our investigation resolved to take all steps that=
 are necessary to restore public confidence in the integrity of our firm. .=
 . .=20
MR. GREENWOOD -- Let me turn it to Ms. Temple, and since I don't have any o=
ther members here right now, I'll continue with the questioning.=20
We have a memo from you, Ms. Temple, that's dated, I believe, Nov. 10. . . =
.=20
And that memo is very explicit and it's very clear that you took action on =
that date in the form of that memo to make it crystal clear that no one was=
 to destroy documents.=20
Can you explain to us why it took you until Nov. 10 to issue a statement wi=
th that clarity, when, a month ago, you knew that the question of retention=
 and destruction of documents was going to be critical to investigations an=
d to litigation?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- Yes, Mr. Chairman, I'll tell you the circumstances of sending=
 the Nov. 10 memo and the facts, as I understood them, in the previous time=
 period.=20
On Nov. 10, the memo we sent, it was drafted by our outside counsel, a law =
firm, Davis Polk & Wardwell.=20
MR. GREENWOOD -- When was that firm retained for this purpose?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- I did not personally retain that law firm. I know I spoke to =
a partner at that law firm on Oct. 16.=20
MR. GREENWOOD -- Is your testimony that you do not know when they were reta=
ined?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- I don't recall the exact date of the retention. I know I spok=
e to a partner at that law firm on Oct. 16.=20
MR. GREENWOOD -- O.K., you may proceed.=20
MS. TEMPLE -- It is the legal group's practice and protocol, when Arthur An=
dersen receives a subpoena or a request for documents, to send a written no=
tification ----=20
MS. TEMPLE -- My recollection, the firm received a subpoena from the Securi=
ties and Exchange Commission at the end of the business day on Nov. 8. And =
a voice mail was distributed to the audit engagement team, notifying them o=
f that the following business day. And once this e-mail was drafted, it was=
 circulated to the engagement team.=20
Now, moving back in time frame to the previous period that you talked about=
, the firm does have a written policy that provides guidance. It is self-en=
forcing, and we trust our partners to exercise their good judgment and to c=
onsult with either the legal group or the practice directors as appropriate=
.=20
MR. GREENWOOD -- Let me interrupt you for a second. I asked Ms. Temple when=
 Davis Polk was retained for this purpose, and she indicated that she, her =
response was that she didn't know.=20
Mr. Baskin, Mr. Andrews, do you know when this firm was retained?=20
And I will remind you that I asked you last night to be prepared to answer =
that question this morning.=20
MR. ANDREWS -- Mr. Chairman, the firm was retained on Oct. 9 and commenced =
work with us on Oct. 16.=20
MR. GREENWOOD -- O.K. And what was the purpose for retaining that firm on O=
ct. 9?=20
MR. ANDREWS -- Well, as if we -- just for a moment -- what was going on dur=
ing that particular period of time, around that Oct. 9 time ----=20
MR. GREENWOOD -- Are they handling the potential litigation for the firm no=
w?=20
MR. ANDREWS -- But what they were, are they handling it now? Yes, they are.=
=20
What was going on at that particular time was that we were involved, the co=
mpany was closing its third quarter. They were about to reach conclusions o=
n the third quarter. There were a lot of financial reporting issues occurri=
ng during that period that were obviously unusual and were concerning. So w=
e engaged them to help us with the financial reporting issues and with poss=
ible litigation.=20
MR. GREENWOOD -- Mr. Baskin or Mr. Andrews, or even Ms. Temple, you may wan=
t to answer this question.=20
The document in Tab 29 in your binder is a copy of an Enron announcement to=
 its employees and others on the Enron worldwide e-mail list, which I belie=
ve includes Andersen, on Oct. 25, 2001, telling them to preserve records re=
lating to the related party transactions including the accounting of those =
transactions.=20
Did Andersen learn about this action by Enron, which by the way also seems =
rather late given that it is eight days after Enron learned of the S.E.C. i=
nquiry? And if so, why didn't Andersen act right then to order its employee=
s to do the same?=20
MR. BASKIN -- Well, as it pertains to --this is the first time I've read th=
is memo -- but as it pertains to our actions, again, we believe that it was=
 the engagement partners' responsibility in this situation, given what was =
occurring in that late-October period, which is the date of this memo, that=
 there was enough information available that, in that partner's judgment, t=
he instruction and oversight of that partner would in fact cause us not to =
destroy documents. And certainly, you would not convene a meeting and give =
instructions, if you will -- apparently that's what happened -- to destroy =
documents.=20
So we would agree that during this period it would be appropriate to, at a =
minimum, seek counsel before doing such an exercise.=20
And destruction of documents in that period is wrong, and we have admitted =
that. It is wrong. And once we learned of that in our investigation, we too=
k firm actions. That is not Andersen, that is not what we encourage our emp=
loyees to do, and it is inappropriate. . . .=20
REPRESENTATIVE TAUZIN -- The gentleman's time has expired. The chair recogn=
izes himself for a round of questions.=20
First of all, I want to turn to the week of Oct. 9. Now, you've testified O=
ct. 9 was the date that Arthur Andersen hired counsel, outside counsel, rig=
ht? And the outside counsel firm was Davis Polk & Wardwell of New York, rig=
ht? Is that correct, sir? Mr. Andrews?=20
MR. ANDREWS -- Yes, that's correct.=20
MR. TAUZIN -- My understanding is that's a litigation team, right?=20
MR. ANDREWS -- Davis Polk is a reputable firm. I'm sure they do litigation =
in other things, but we hired them for purposes to help us with the financi=
al reporting and possible litigation.=20
MR. TAUZIN -- And possible litigation, right?=20
MR. ANDREWS -- Yes, sir.=20
MR. TAUZIN -- This Oct. 9 -- I want to turn to you, Ms. Temple, real quickl=
y. Sometime before the week of Oct. 12, in your interviews with us, you inf=
ormed us that there was a conference call about the Enron engagement team's=
 compliance with the document retention policy.=20
Mr. Duncan says that it was you who raised the question about the retention=
 policy. You had some other recollections of that conversation.=20
Give us your recollections of what happened in that conference call. And wh=
at date was that?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- Sure. Let me give you the context of my role in this matter.=
=20
I was asked, beginning on Sept. 28, 2001, to participate in a conference ca=
ll. I understood that the firm was addressing one accounting issue that had=
 arisen at that point in time.=20
And between that time and Oct. 12, I provided legal advice, including, afte=
r consultation with my supervisor and others, about specific documentation =
and retention issues.=20
MR. TAUZIN -- Ms. Temple, in that conversation, though, that occurred right=
 about the time that the firm was hiring other litigation counsel -- you're=
 the litigation attorney for the firm, isn't that correct?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- My background is in litigation, yes.=20
MR. TAUZIN -- But they just hired an outside litigation firm to advise them=
 on possible litigation. About the same time, there's a conference call and=
 there's a discussion about the retention policy. And obviously, the memo i=
s sent out following it regarding that policy that includes information abo=
ut destruction of documents as well.=20
You said something to our investigators about conversations in that confere=
nce call, referencing changing memos and deleting information from past mem=
os, substituting a memo to the file for an old memo with a new memo. Is tha=
t accurate? Was that discussion held in that conference call?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- The advice I gave was different from that, Mr. Chairman. The =
advice I gave was ----=20
MR. TAUZIN -- What were the questions being asked that you had to give advi=
ce?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- The team was discussing a draft of a memo about a particular =
accounting issue on asset impairment. The advice that my supervisor and I g=
ave initially was that that memo, which was being currently drafted, needed=
 to be dated currently ----=20
MR. TAUZIN -- But what did they want to do that you told them they couldn't=
 do? What did they ask you to do?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- I don't recall with respect to that particular legal advice t=
hat there was a question raised, but we pointed out to the team ----=20
MR. TAUZIN -- Was there not a request or discussion of substituting a new m=
emo for an old memo and, in effect, backdating a memo to the file?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- No, there was not a question about backdating that particular=
 memo, but the date ----=20
MR. TAUZIN -- Was there a question about substituting it and deleting infor=
mation from the memo?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- There was a question in that current memo that was raised, ca=
n we delete a sentence, acknowledging that the firm had given incorrect acc=
ounting advice in the first quarter of 2001 ----=20
MR. TAUZIN -- What I want to know is ----=20
MS. TEMPLE -- ---- and I said absolutely not.=20
MR. TAUZIN -- What I want to know is, essentially, you said don't do that.=
=20
MS. TEMPLE -- Right.=20
MR. TAUZIN -- Is it customary that in those kind of discussions, when the f=
irm finds itself in error, that anyone would suggest substituting memos or =
deleting information that was in memos already in the file? Was that unusua=
l conversation?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- I expect the engagement partners to raise questions about doc=
umentation and seek advice, which they were doing.=20
The other legal advice that I gave on documentation was, the memos for any =
prior periods, first quarter of 2001, year-end 2000, could not be changed o=
r deleted.=20
MR. TAUZIN -- You're telling them no changes. I understand that. I'm asking=
 you, was it customary? Was this unusual for members of the firm to be talk=
ing to you about changing documents, altering documents, substituting docum=
ents that were on file already regards to Enron operations?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- At the time, based on my recollection, I understood that ther=
e were good-faith questions that were being asked about how to properly doc=
ument the firm's ----=20
MR. TAUZIN -- Was it a good-faith question to change a memo that's already =
in the file with a new memo?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- I received the question and consulted with my supervisor and =
others -- --=20
MR. TAUZIN -- You said, don't do it.=20
MS. TEMPLE -- ---- and gave the advice. And to the best of my knowledge, th=
e advice was followed.=20
MR. TAUZIN -- Were you shocked that they would raise such a question? Were =
you alarmed? Were you disturbed? Did it bother you, as litigation counsel f=
or the firm, that any member would even suggest altering the record, alteri=
ng documents, substituting memos to the file?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- I don't recall everything going on in my mind. I recall makin=
g sure, giving advice to make sure that the written record was complete and=
 accurate and truthful. And I do recall seeing that my advice was followed.=
=20
MR. TAUZIN -- And my time is up, but you do recall also that Oct. 16 memo, =
that you did discuss with them changing that memo so that your name was not=
 included because you might be a potential witness. Is that correct?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- I do recall giving legal advice after consultation with other=
s, including outside legal counsel, Davis Polk, that the audit partners sho=
uld document the recommendations and communications he had with the client =
about the client's, Enron's, draft press release.=20
And I did, after consulting with outside legal counsel, and it's our standa=
rd practice in the legal group to advise the engagement team not to write d=
own and discuss in their memos legal advice that the legal group might give=
, because it might be a waiver down the road of attorney-client privilege.=
=20
MR. TAUZIN -- Thank you, gentlelady.=20
The chair recognizes the gentlelady, Ms. DeGette, for a round of questions.=
=20
REPRESENTATIVE DEGETTE -- Thank you, Mr. Chairman. . . .=20
If you can tell me very briefly, under what circumstances you believe docum=
ents should be retained? When is it, what is the trigger under which docume=
nts need to be retained?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- There are several provisions in the policy that address reten=
tion.=20
MS. DEGETTE -- And, in fact, there's an exhibit to document No. 27 here, Ex=
hibit 1, that says examples of situations to be reported, and that's a list=
 of examples of situations where, if you see that coming, then you treat th=
at as threatened legal action under Section 2.5 of the litigation procedure=
s and you retain them. Is that right?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- Yes, there is a list of examples to be reported to the legal =
group that calls for notification. I don't believe ----=20
MS. DEGETTE -- And that would trigger, then, a notification such as the one=
 that you made, I think, on Oct. 12 in your e-mail, right?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- My understanding ----=20
MS. DEGETTE -- I mean, it's not just threatened litigation, is it? There's =
other things that would trigger Arthur Andersen to recommend retention of d=
ocuments.=20
MS. TEMPLE --The policy does require retention of all related material if t=
here's threatened litigation.=20
MS. DEGETTE -- Or other situations, right? And one of those situations woul=
d be oral indications from management or owners that the firm was somehow r=
esponsible for the failure of operations or the failure to detect fraud, ri=
ght? That's the third one on the list of examples of situations to be repor=
ted, right?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- Right. And this list of examples is from the policy statement=
 No. 780, which ----=20
MS. DEGETTE -- Right.=20
MS. TEMPLE -- ---- requires notification to the legal group of those exampl=
es.=20
MS. DEGETTE -- -- O.K. So now, there was a memo that was written on Aug. 15=
, 2001, from Sherron Watkins, an Enron vice president, alleging improper ac=
counting and all kinds of other problems. Was the legal department aware of=
 that?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- I don't recall if I was aware of that particular document. I =
was aware of circumstances about allegations by an employee of Enron, and t=
he fact that Vinson & Elkins had conducted an investigation and concluded a=
nd reported positively to the board the week of Oct. 8.=20
MS. DEGETTE -- So you were aware that in August an employee had made these =
allegations, and then Vinson & Elkins had done an investigation also in Aug=
ust. Is that right?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- Not exactly.=20
MS. DEGETTE -- No?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- Before Oct. 12 I was aware that Vinson & Elkins had been enga=
ged and completed and reported orally to the board that the results of thei=
r investigation were positive.=20
And the engagement team also assured the practice directors who were being =
consulted at that time and myself that they had reviewed the information ab=
out the allegations, and that the allegations were, to the extent that they=
 had any information in them in reference to transactions, involved transac=
tions that the audit team had carefully reviewed in its prior work.=20
MS. DEGETTE -- O.K. So you thought that, because Vinson & Elkins had said t=
here's no problem, that that did not trigger any kind of requirement. Is th=
at correct? Yes or no, please.=20
MS. TEMPLE -- No, that's not ----=20
MS. DEGETTE -- O.K, thank you.=20
MS. TEMPLE -- ---- what I was thinking at the time.=20
MS. DEGETTE -- Now, what caused you to send that memo on Oct. 12? Did you d=
o that on a regular basis?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- There were several factors that caused me to send the memo on=
 Oct. 12.=20
MS. DEGETTE -- O.K, let me back up for a minute. How many times in your two=
 years, roughly, at Andersen did you send memos like this, reminding people=
 of the document retention and destruction policy?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- I don't recall the number of times. I have referred ----=20
MS. DEGETTE -- Had you done it before?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- I believe I had referred people to the firm's policies on doc=
ument retention and destruction, as well as ----=20
MS. DEGETTE -- How many times before?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- I don't recall the number of times.=20
MS. DEGETTE -- One time? Five times? Ten times?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- To the best of my recollection, at least one other occasion, =
and I ----=20
MS. DEGETTE -- And was that in relation to Enron, or was that in relation t=
o another client?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- No, that was not in relation to Enron. . . .=20
MR. TAUZIN -- I just want to clarify your testimony to the gentlelady's que=
stions. You indicated that Vinson & Elkins issued a positive report. I want=
 a quote from that report.=20
''There is a serious risk of adverse publicity and litigation. It also appe=
ars, because of the inquiries and issues raised by Ms. Watkins, Arthur Ande=
rsen will want additional assurances that Enron had no agreement with LJM t=
hat LJM would not lose money,'' et cetera.=20
Is that a positive report?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- As I recall, the outcome of the report, as reported to me, th=
e ----=20
MR. TAUZIN -- You have a copy of this, I believe we've submitted, you have =
a copy of this letter, don't you, from Vinson & Elkins? You saw it yourself=
, didn't you?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- After the week of Oct. 12, I did receive a copy ----=20
MR. TAUZIN -- But here's the point, Ms. Temple. I mean, we're trying to get=
 the facts here. But if you will characterize a report that indicates a dec=
line in the value of Enron's stock and the serious risk of adverse publicit=
y and litigation as a positive report from the attorneys, we're going to ha=
ve trouble with your testimony today.=20
MS. TEMPLE -- Later on, when I did receive a copy of the report and sent a =
copy to outside counsel, I did note the comments that you referenced. But I=
 also noted that the law firm reported that there was nothing further to fo=
llow up on at that point in time.=20
And the law firm was representing Enron Corporation, not Arthur Andersen. A=
nd I understood and recall at the time thinking that there might be a chall=
enge to the business judgment decisions of Enron to enter into certain tran=
sactions.=20
MR. TAUZIN -- Did you know at the time that Vinson & Elkins had signed off =
on these agreements as a counsel for the firm? There may have been a confli=
ct of interest in them commenting on them now?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- I don't recall the circumstances ----=20
MR. TAUZIN -- You're not aware of that?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- I don't recall at this time.=20
MR. TAUZIN -- Thank you, gentlelady.=20
MS. DEGETTE -- Do you recall a conversation with Mr. Duncan in which he ass=
ured you he was gathering the documents to preserve them? Do you recall spe=
cifically having that conversation?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- I don't recall ----=20
MS. DEGETTE -- According to your notes?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- ---- his specific words, but I do recall that we had a group =
conference call on Oct. 23. And I have these notes from that call.=20
MS. DEGETTE -- And the notes don't say anything about preservation, do they=
?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- The notes. . . .=20
MS. DEGETTE -- Yes or no?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- The notes do not have the word ''preservation'' in them.=20
MS. DEGETTE -- And on Oct. 12, you had just sent a memo to Mr. Duncan and h=
is group, advising them of the Arthur Andersen document retention and destr=
uction policy, which involved destroying of all of the notes and backup doc=
uments and so on. Correct?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- No. Actually, I sent a reference to the policy to the practic=
e director in Houston.=20
MS. DEGETTE -- So you never sent that to Mr. Duncan?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- I did not send it personally to Mr. Duncan.=20
MS. DEGETTE -- Mr. Odom had that, correct? Mr. Odom, did you have that?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- Yes, I sent it to the Houston practice director, based on sev=
eral factors ----=20
MS. DEGETTE -- Just cutting through, in this Oct. 23 phone call, you don't =
recall specifically -- and your notes do not reflect -- you telling Mr. Dun=
can to retain records, do they? Yes or no.=20
MS. TEMPLE -- I don't see that in my ----=20
MS. DEGETTE -- Yes or no, ma'am?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- No, it's not. . . .=20
MS. DEGETTE -- Thank you. I yield back.=20
MR. TAUZIN -- Ms. Temple, if you received this e-mail from Mr. Duncan indic=
ating he was collecting all these documents, and assumed that he was preser=
ving them, why did you feel it necessary on November the 9th to leave a voi=
ce mail with Mr. Duncan, directing him to preserve those documents because =
of the receipt of the S.E.C. subpoena? If he was preserving them already, w=
hy on earth did you feel it necessary to advise him to preserve them on Nov=
. 9?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- It is our firm's practice to notify the engagement team when =
the legal group receives a subpoena. I believe it had been received in the =
general counsel's office, and I promptly notified the engagement partner an=
d reminded about the need to, at this point in time, we'll have to collect =
the documents for production.=20
MR. TAUZIN -- Well -- but you understand why common sense gets a little los=
t here. If you're in a position where you know that the retention policy al=
so means destruction -- you know that, didn't you?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- There are aspects of instruction guidelines ----=20
MR. TAUZIN: -- Yes.=20
MS. TEMPLE -- ---- in that policy. Yes.=20
MR. TAUZIN -- So you know that the retention policy, as long as it's operat=
ing, permits Mr. Duncan and however many people he has working for him to d=
estroy documents.=20
You hear, you get a memo from him saying, ''I'm gathering them all up.'' An=
d you tell us today that you assumed that meant he was gathering up to pres=
erve them for litigation, not to destroy them.=20
Why would you even bother to say, ''By the way,'' on Nov. 9, ''quit destroy=
ing documents. We've just got an S.E.C. subpoena?'' Why would you do that?=
=20
MS. TEMPLE -- The legal group notifies the engagement partner and engagemen=
t team when subpoenas are served. It was received by the legal group, and I=
 felt it was appropriate to follow the firm protocol to notify the engageme=
nt partner.=20
MR. TAUZIN -- Yes. But, you see, we also have your memo on November the 10t=
h, and I'm going to read you from it. It says, ''One of the first things we=
 must do in preparing to respond to these subpoenas and lawsuits is to take=
 all necessary steps to preserve all of the documents and other materials t=
hat we may have relating to claims that are being filed.''=20
Now, if that was already being done, if you had received a notice from Mr. =
Duncan that he's gathering them all up to preserve them, if that was your c=
onclusion, why would you say, ''the first thing we have to do now, now that=
 the subpoena has arrived is start preserving these things?''=20
You see, common sense, Ms. Temple, common sense tells me that destruction w=
as going on up until this time when the subpoena arrived and that until you=
 said, ''preserve them'' they may well have been gathered up for destructio=
n, and that somebody should have known that. And was that somebody you?=20
MS. TEMPLE -- I never counseled any destruction or shredding of documents. =
And I only wish that someone had raised the question so that we could have =
consulted and addressed the situation.

Enron Leaves Void In Commodity Trades

After the collapse of Enron, people wondered who would pick up the slack in the commodity trading of broadband communications capacity. The answer: nobody. 
Aside from a handful of bit players that specialize in brokering tailor-made deals, the bandwidth market collapsed before it was even able to attain the liquidity necessary to thrive.
The disappearance of bandwidth trading altogether is now being discussed, to the dismay of Enron-inspired operations at big companies like El Paso, Williams and Dynegy that bet heavily on the market's potential. Yet such a development should be no small surprise, given bandwidth trading's early handicaps. 
After the feverish expansion of fiber optic networks in the late 1990's, an overwhelming glut of capacity on these systems sent bandwidth prices plunging. Faced with cheap contracts and slower-than-expected growth in Internet usage, telecommunications companies found little need to participate in a secondary market for capacity because they were almost drowning in it. 
The collapse of the dot-coms and speculation that trades among big bandwidth-trading players were often little more than fancy financial maneuvering engineered to suggest growing volumes did little to help. Even before Enron's fall, the austere market claimed its victims, with players like Asia Capacity Exchange and GTX.com falling by the wayside, Ovum, a consulting firm, noted in a recent report. 
A recovery in bandwidth prices appears a distant dream. Moreover, it was never easy for rough-and-tumble energy traders to convince large telecommunications concerns why they should agree to make a commodity of their core offering. 
The fanciful business of trading bandwidth was more a symptom than a cause of the fin de siecle telecommunications debacle. SIMON ROMERO

Manager's Journal: Dare to Keep Your Stock Price Low

Egged on by a buoyant economy and the pace of value creation set by the market's best performers, over the past two decades securities analysts challenged the companies they covered to reach for unprecedented earnings growth. Too often managers collaborated in this fiction, either because they had unrealistic expectations for their companies or, worse yet, because they used analysts' expectations to set internal corporate goals. When the fiction finally became obvious the results were massive adjustments in growth projections and equity valuations, and in some cases bankruptcy and liquidation. 
Enron is perhaps the most dramatic example. Wisely taking advantage of a rapidly deregulating market and capitalizing on its deep knowledge of the industry, Enron had seized a powerful, but probably once-in-a-lifetime, opportunity to remake itself as a market maker in natural gas and energy.
Wall Street responded to this and other genuine innovations with a series of positive reports and ever-higher valuations, eventually labeling Enron one of the best companies in the economy and comparing it to Microsoft and General Electric. However, the aggressive targets that Wall Street set for Enron's shares made the company a captive of its own success. 
Enron's peak valuation of $68 billion in August 2001 required the company to grow its free cash flow at 91% annually for the next six years, and then to grow at the average rate for the economy. One analyst blithely predicted that Enron would come to dominate the wholesale energy market for electricity, natural gas, coal, energy derivatives, bandwidth and energy services on three continents. 
Enron, to its own detriment, decided to take up the challenge. In seeking to meet expectations it expanded into markets in which it had no specific assets, expertise or experience, like broadband and even weather hedging -- and when this failed to deliver enough growth, it manipulated the information it gave to Wall Street. 
The story of Nortel is similar. In 1997 Nortel CEO John Roth launched a strategy to transform the company from one dependent on voice switching into one focused on data networking. Nortel acquired 19 companies between 1997 and early 2001. As its stock price soared, reaching a total capital value of $277 billion in July 2000, it came under pressure to do deals to satisfy the analysts' growth expectations. The more it did, the more it was expected to do. Ultimately, it paid over $32 billion -- using its own overvalued stock as currency -- for these companies, most of which eventually had to be sold off. Its stock has fallen by more than 99% from its peak. Some question whether the company will survive. 
It didn't have to be this way for either company. A few CEOs have wisely and bravely decided to put an end to the expectations game by simply saying no to what has euphemistically been termed earnings "guidance." In a recent filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Barry Diller, chairman of USA Networks, balked at the sophisticated art form known as managing expectations, comparing it to a Kabuki dance and saying publicly what many others have said privately: The process has little to do with running a business and the numbers can become distractingly and dangerously detached from fundamentals. 
Indeed, an overvalued stock can be as damaging to the long-run health of a company as an undervalued stock. The words of Warren Buffett in his 1988 letter to shareholders are instructive on this point: "We do not want to maximize the price at which Berkshire shares trade. . . . We wish for them to trade in a narrow range centered at intrinsic business value." 
But in order for a stock to trade close to its intrinsic value managers must work to make their organizations far more transparent to investors. Mr. Diller has chosen to provide for analysts actual business budgets broken down by business segments. While it is still too early to tell how that will work, at the very least companies should state their strategies clearly, identify associated value drivers, and report auditable metrics on both. That must include addressing the "unexplained" part of their firm's share price -- that part not directly linked to observable cash flows -- through a coherent description of the growth opportunities they foresee. They must tell the markets frankly when they see their stock price as overvalued. 
Stock prices are not simply abstract numbers. The price that Wall Street puts on a company's securities increasingly affects the nature of the strategies that firm adopts and, hence, its prospects for success. Stock prices also drive a company's cost of capital, its borrowing ability, and its ability to make acquisitions. A valuation that becomes unhinged from the underlying realities of the business can rob investors of savings, cost people far more innocent than senior management their jobs, and undermine the viability of suppliers and communities. 
In the long run, conforming to market pressures for impossible growth leads to shortened careers, humiliation and damaged companies. Just ask the folks at Enron, whose once-valuable company and pension fund are now in ruins.

Missed Signals: Stock Gurus Write Off Most Big Write-Offs, But They Shouldn't --- `Special' or `Unusual' Charges Often Hold Vital Clues To Companies' Prospects --- At Home's Future Foretold
By Jonathan Weil and Steve Liesman

Conventional wisdom among Wall Street stock analysts holds that investors should ignore large write-offs because they provide little insight about future performance. Now, amid the biggest wave of write-offs in history and mounting bankruptcies, it may be time to revisit that wisdom. 
Consider recent events at Bethlehem Steel Corp. In July, it reported a $1.13 billion second-quarter loss, the bulk of it a $1 billion "unusual noncash" charge against earnings to write off the value of a deferred tax asset.
The charge didn't bother Salomon Smith Barney analyst Michelle Galanter Applebaum. It "masked what was essentially an improved quarter," she wrote on July 25, retaining her buy recommendation on the stock and predicting it would more than triple. 
Three months later, Bethlehem filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. 
Far from being something investors could safely ignore, Bethlehem's write-off of deferred tax assets -- mainly deductible losses carried forward from prior years -- held a clue to its future. Such assets can be used to offset future income-tax bills. But, of course, they can be used only by companies that are profitable and paying income taxes. By taking the charge, Bethlehem was signaling that it wasn't likely to use the assets, because it probably wouldn't have taxable profits anytime soon. 
Almost any kind of write-off can send a message about the soundness of a business, the competence of its management or its prospects for growth. Although Wall Street stock analysts and financial executives routinely tell investors to disregard these entries, others say they're among the things investors should most closely heed. 
"When you see these large write-downs, the antenna should go up immediately, and you should start digging for the underlying business reasons for these losses," says Lynn Turner, an accounting professor at Colorado State University and a former chief accountant for the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
The sheer size of recent write-offs has made understanding their nature more urgent. Companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index have reported more than $165 billion of so-called unusual charges so far this year, says research firm Multex.com Inc., more than in the prior five years combined. Meanwhile, Chapter 11 and Chapter 7 bankruptcy filings by publicly traded companies through mid-December hit a record 241, compared with 176 all of last year, according to New Generation Research Inc. in Boston. 
Even if bankruptcy seems like a remote prospect, an "unusual" charge against earnings -- often called a "special," "one-time" or "nonrecurring" charge -- can provide an exit signal to investors. While stocks sometimes rally on news of such a charge, as a company announces a bold housecleaning move, the rally often doesn't last. A study by Multex.com and The Wall Street Journal found that companies taking the largest unusual charges as a percentage of sales have substantially poorer stock returns in the three months following the announcement of the charge than companies with minimal or no such charges. 
The study, covering the past six years, looked at stocks of all public companies with market capitalizations of $1 billion or more. It divided those that took unusual charges into 10 groups, from the smallest to the largest such charges as a percentage of revenue. Stocks of companies with the largest charges relative to sales had a median decline of 9.4% in the 90 days after the charge was taken. Stocks of companies with the smallest charges relative to sales had a median gain of 1.48%. 
While it could be argued that the shares might have fared worse without the charges, Marc Gerstein, director of investment research at Multex.com, says the study shows that "if you want to weed out stocks to look at for investment purposes, companies with unusually large write-offs are a good place to start." 
Sometimes the significance of special charges isn't immediately clear. But some investors grow suspicious anyway, on the "cockroach theory": Where there's one problem, there probably are more. "From seemingly minor or immaterial charges, sometimes investors can glean insight into how a company either correctly or incorrectly accounts for its business and whether a company is pushing the envelope," says James Chanos, president of Kynikos Associates, a firm that specializes in short-selling, or betting on stock declines. 
Many short-sellers raised their bearish bets on Enron Corp. in mid-October after it took a $1.01 billion charge largely to write down the value of soured investments. Inside the charge was a $35 million write-off of investment losses at a partnership controlled by the company's chief financial officer. Later revelations about that and other partnerships, which weren't consolidated into the Houston-based energy concern's financial statements, led the market to lose faith in the company's finances. Its stock now trades for under a dollar a share as the company seeks to restructure under bankruptcy law. 
The significance of special charges -- whether they represent old baggage from the past or illuminate the future -- is at the center of a lively debate under way in the accounting world. One side holds that generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, provide the best available snapshot of a company's financial position. GAAP, which companies must use in their official financial statements, requires that nearly all charges be treated as ordinary expenses. 
Others, including many stock analysts, contend the best view comes from "pro forma" financial results -- calculated "as if" many expenses didn't really exist. The idea is that these expenses aren't relevant to future performance. 
Companies increasingly highlight the pro forma view in news releases they generally put out before their official filings with regulators. But pro forma calculations adhere to no particular standard. Companies essentially do what they want. Now, accountants and economists say the practice of excluding blemishes is so widespread that companies and analysts often guide investors to dismiss charges that contain prescient warnings -- like the one at Bethlehem Steel. 
Ms. Applebaum, the Salomon Smith Barney analyst who played down Bethlehem's big write-off, explains that she has covered other steel companies that returned to profitability shortly after writing off deferred tax assets. She thought Bethlehem would do the same. She notes that GAAP rules on such assets obliged Bethlehem to follow strict criteria in assessing its chances of future profitability -- stricter criteria than stock analysts typically use. 
As for Bethlehem, Chief Financial Officer Leonard M. Anthony says the charge the company took was to some extent "predictive of the future." 
GAAP also has well-established standards for writing down other kinds of assets. Companies must reduce the value on their books of anything from a customer loan to a manufacturing plant when its worth has diminished. Again, Wall Street stock analysts tend to dismiss the resulting charges as one-time events. 
Sometimes that makes sense. During the 1981-82 recession, restructuring was a part of many corporations' strategies. They took charges for streamlining, outsourcing and otherwise shedding costs to position themselves for recovery. Because the resulting earnings volatility made it hard to compare companies' growth rates or price-earnings ratios, and because the charges weren't expected to recur, there was logic to excluding them to come up with "smoothed" earnings trends. 
"Investors came to look upon the charges, correctly in many cases, as evidence that those firms had recognized past mistakes and had made tough decisions to become more efficient," said a September 2001 study by the Jerome Levy Economics Institute at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y. 
But the practice soon got out of hand. Some companies became habitual restructurers. The Levy study estimates that "operating earnings" -- another term for pro forma earnings -- at companies in the S&P 500 index have outstripped net income by more than 10% annually on average over the past two decades, and by as much as 20% annually in recent years. One reason: While companies readily exclude all sorts of special losses from their operating earnings, they are far less likely to exclude one-time gains, such as profits from asset sales. 
Investors ignore write-offs at their peril, says economist David Levy at the institute. The reason is that when a company writes down an asset, it usually has concluded the asset won't generate as much cash as once assumed. That suggests the company as a whole won't, either. "The write-down of an asset is a recognition . . . that the future is not going to be as profitable as expected," Mr. Levy says. 
And if the company borrowed to buy the assets it is writing down, it could find itself squeezed by debt, as At Home Corp. was. At the start of 2001, the provider of high-speed Internet access, which did business as Excite@Home, announced a $5.43 billion net loss for the 2000 fourth quarter, on just $169.1 million in revenue. Much of the loss -- $4.63 billion -- reflected write-downs of "goodwill," the intangible asset created when one company pays a premium to buy another. 
One such write-down concerned At Home's purchase of Bluemountain.com, an online greeting-card service. At Home paid $1 billion in stock and cash for the company in late 1999, taking on $350 million of debt to do so. But Bluemountain had little revenue. A year later, At Home took a $684.2 million charge for the goodwill it created by buying Bluemountain at a price far above its net worth. 
Rather than its $5.43 billion net loss, At Home highlighted its self-defined "net operating loss" for the 2000 fourth quarter -- a mere $36 million. At Home Chairman George Bell said in a conference call that the charges had "no direct impact" on the company's operating performance. 
Most stock analysts following the stock seemed to agree. Bank of America Securities' Douglas Shapiro, in a report following At Home's news release, didn't even mention the gigantic charge or net loss. "With the worst case already largely discounted into the stock, we retain our Buy rating and year-end 2001 $20 price target," Mr. Shapiro wrote on Jan. 26, 2001, when At Home stock stood at $6.47. 
At Dain Rauscher Wessels, senior analyst David Lee Smith also ignored the net loss in his commentary after At Home's earnings news release. He retained his buy rating, although he lowered his price target to $15 from $38. The company "has a long-term asset base and is appropriately valued for long-term investors," Mr. Smith wrote when the charge was announced. 
But some investors voted with their feet. At Home's stock sank about 32% in the following two weeks. Even though At Home was writing down Bluemountain, it still had to pay for it. Faced with growing cash needs for interest payments and service upgrades, At Home filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in September. Its stock was last quoted at a penny. 
Looking back, Mr. Smith says At Home's huge write-off was a "perfect example" of a charge overlooked by himself and other stock analysts that would have helped predict the company's future performance. "Probably too frequently we have given companies the benefit of the doubt without burrowing in and asking, `What does it say about the financial condition of the company?' " says Mr. Smith, whose firm is now called RBC Dain Rauscher Inc. 
At Bank of America, Mr. Shapiro says he felt At Home's stock price already reflected how little value there was in its media businesses such as Bluemountain and the Excite Web portal. He felt cash flow from At Home's stronger business, a network for cable companies to deliver Internet access, would be sufficient -- and if it wasn't, he figured the cable companies would put up the cash to save At Home. "I was wrong about my assumptions about the fundamentals of At Home's business. But I don't think the implications of the charge itself were that significant," Mr. Shapiro says. At Home says that the actions it took "were in accordance with general accounting principles." 
Companies frequently portray charges as part of a broader restructuring effort to restore profitability. But at Lucent Technologies Inc., they signaled a business plan that had failed and a management team that was struggling to find a remedy. 
The telecom-equipment maker told investors in late 2000 it would drive out $1 billion of costs and take other unspecified charges over the coming months. On Jan. 24, 2001, with the stock at about $19, Lucent forecast that the charge would range from $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion. But in April, Lucent announced $2.7 billion in "one-time" charges for the just-ended quarter. 
Its news release -- excluding the charges and adjusting for the spin-off of some businesses -- highlighted pro forma results, which showed the loss narrowing to $1.26 billion from $1.31 billion in the immediately preceding quarter. "Lucent delivered much improved performance in the quarter, despite continued softness in several key markets world-wide," said Chairman Henry Schacht. 
Results as tabulated according to GAAP pointed to a different trend. Lucent's loss from continuing operations widened to $3.38 billion from $1.58 billion in the preceding quarter. 
And the write-offs kept coming. In all, Lucent recorded $11.42 billion of "restructuring and one-time charges" in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30. Its stock, which was in the 80s two years ago and in the high teens when Lucent announced the first one-time charges, closed Friday at $6.18. 
Were there clues in Lucent's early charges that might have foretold this future? Lucent's April announcement detailed an amalgam of write-offs and other expenses that showed weakness in many parts of the company's business. 
A charge for layoffs, for instance, showed the company had deployed large numbers of employees in key divisions where it no longer expected profits. 
A write-off for accounts receivable from a significant customer -- Winstar Communications Inc., which filed for Chapter 11 in April -- showed that some past sales had failed to bring in cash and that future sales growth could be hurt because the customer base had shrunk. 
A write-off of goodwill revealed that some acquired assets wouldn't generate the expected profits. Inventory write-downs showed that previous sales projections were too high and future revenue was likely to slip. 
"When you're making cuts that deep, it means the company has fundamental problems," says Mr. Turner of Colorado State. That should prompt investors to ask whether "this is the management team that's going to be able to get you back where you need to be," Mr. Turner says, and it also signals "that there's probably more to come." Indeed, had investors focused on explanations of the charges contained on page 16 of the quarterly report Lucent filed with regulators in May, they would have learned that the company anticipated taking additional restructuring charges during the year. 
So why the news release's emphasis on the pro forma figure? "We highlighted it because it's the way many of our competitors provide their earnings," says Michelle Davidson, a Lucent spokeswoman, who notes that the GAAP earnings numbers were included in the release. 
Asked whether the charges amounted to a warning of a deteriorating financial position, the company declines to comment. Investors, says Ms. Davidson, should focus on Lucent's progress in delivering on its pledges of reduced capital spending and employment and increased working capital. The current management team has "dealt with the tough issues head-on, restructured in a tough market and built a solid track record in creating a plan and delivering on a plan," she says. 
Sometimes, even what seems clearly to be a one-time charge can flag fundamental problems. Providian Financial Corp., a San Francisco-based credit-card issuer, reported profits soaring at a 37% compounded annual rate from the end of 1995 through 2000. Its stock more than quadrupled to $57.50. 
But Providian's sales tactics came under attack. In mid-2000, Providian said it planned to settle with state and federal regulators over allegations of consumer fraud. Without admitting wrongdoing, it agreed to soften its practices by, among other things, extending late-payment grace periods and toning down telemarketing scripts. Providian recorded a $272.6 million "one-time" charge for the 2000 second quarter as a result of the settlement. It posted net income of $62.8 million. 
Many stock analysts treated the charge as positive news. At CIBC World Markets, analyst Steven Eisman wrote on June 20, 2000, that "for the past year, legal issues concerning the company's sales tactics and back-office processes clouded the stock. By taking a provision for all potential future legal inquiries, we believe the financial risk associated with such legal inquiries is now behind them." Mr. Eisman has since left CIBC and says his new employer doesn't permit him to comment. 
In contrast to stock analysts' optimism, bond analyst Kathleen Shanley at Gimme Credit, a New York research firm, saw a red flag. Her concern: "the potential impact of a change in marketing practices on previously sizzling revenue-growth rates." 
Although Providian said it had already implemented its sales reforms by the time of the settlement, Ms. Shanley doubted their full impact was reflected in the earnings outlook. Besides worrying that Providian wouldn't have the same marketing tools to deploy in its push for customers, she thought the settlements exposed the degree to which growth had been based on loans to people with shaky credit. 
Then, for the first quarter of 2001, Providian reported declining noninterest income and growing credit losses, due to rising bankruptcies and the slowing economy. Alan Elias, vice president of corporate communications, acknowledges that the settlement affected future revenue a little, by applying "some additional pressure in regards to marketing certain membership products." 
Mr. Elias says there was nothing about the settlement that spoke to credit quality, even though Providian eventually had "higher-than-expected loss rates in our low-end portfolio." He adds: "To make a direct correlation that this is what is going to happen two years down the road [as a result of the settlement charge] is preposterous." 
In any case, beset by rising consumer defaults and declining revenue, Providian issued a series of further profit warnings. On Oct. 18, it reported a 71% fall in third-quarter earnings, knocking the stock down 58% in a day. The stock closed Friday at $3.55, down 94% for the year.

Enron Debacle Will Test Leadership of SEC's New Chief --- Harvey Pitt's Handling of Energy-Trading Firm's Collapse to Be Watched Closely
By Michael Schroeder
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

WASHINGTON -- Harvey Pitt's mission since becoming Securities and Exchange Commission chairman in August has been to ease the tough-enforcement policies of predecessor Arthur Levitt. Now comes the notorious case of the Enron Corp. debacle. 
More than ever, leaders of industry, labor and politics will be watching -- many skeptically -- how the new Pitt SEC will perform. Mr. Levitt specialized in rooting out accounting fraud; Mr. Pitt, a former securities lawyer whose clients included all "Big Five" accounting companies and major corporations, has said he wants the regulatory agency to be less adversarial.
The rhetoric played well enough -- until Enron's implosion punched big holes in investors' portfolios, and leveled many employees' retirement savings. The scrutiny the SEC will come under for its own scrutiny of Enron was evident Friday: Aides to Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, said he will soon hold hearings on Enron. 
Democrats have been itching for Mr. Lieberman to do so, believing the revelations could embarrass Republicans who have benefited from Enron's past political largesse -- and in particular President Bush, whose political ties to Enron and Chairman Kenneth Lay date to his first election as Texas governor. 
But Mr. Bush, who named Mr. Pitt to the SEC, also on Friday indicated he wants no slack cut for the giant Houston energy-trading concern. 
"I think it's very important to understand what took place," he told reporters at his Texas ranch. "The SEC will be looking into matters, Congress appears to be looking into matters. There will be a lot of government inquiry into Enron and what took place there," he added. "I'm deeply concerned about the citizens of Houston who worked for Enron who lost life savings." 
Broadly speaking, Mr. Pitt is resolute about his regulatory approach. Rep. John Dingell, the Michigan Democrat who has made a career of riding herd on regulators he deems soft, recently wrote Mr. Pitt to blast him for "repudiating" the Levitt legacy, and to demand a tough investigation of Enron, which filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code earlier this month. Mr. Pitt replied that he was "perplexed" by Mr. Dingell's assertions; as he sees it, in fact, the Levitt commission's "adversarial attitude toward industry and professions in almost all respects" sowed the seeds of the Enron mess. 
Although Mr. Levitt earned a fortune as a Wall Street executive and chairman of the American Stock Exchange, in eight years as SEC chief he pushed a number of small-investor initiatives that rankled the financial-services industry. 
Mr. Pitt comes to the job after more than two decades as a securities lawyer representing, among others, infamous inside-trader Ivan Boesky. Mr. Pitt had worked for the SEC early in his career in the 1970s, serving as its general counsel before joining the Washington office of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson. 
What has raised red flags is Mr. Pitt's policy that the SEC will consider a company's cooperation and self-policing efforts in deciding penalties -- or whether to bring an enforcement case at all. In some unusual public criticism, Lynn Turner, former chief accountant under Mr. Levitt, said in an interview in late October that a company's senior management could in effect shift blame for securities violations to lower-level employees. 
Through a spokesman, Mr. Pitt declined an interview, but referred to recent speeches in which he complimented Mr. Levitt and disputed his critics. "Those who are counting on a lack of aggressiveness on our part to police improper market activities will be sorely disappointed," he told the Consumer Federation of America last month. 
Former SEC officials say that, as a practical matter, SEC enforcement attorneys are independent and wouldn't buckle to a commissioner's pressure to back off a probe of possible wrongdoing. Meantime, in answer to his skeptics, Mr. Pitt is expected to showcase two coming enforcement cases, against as-yet-unnamed companies. 
He said one case involves the use of "pro forma earnings" in a way that misled investors and broke accounting rules, while the other case alleges a violation of "Regulation FD." That Regulation Fair Disclosure is a Levitt SEC rule, strongly opposed on Wall Street, intended to ensure that important corporate information is available to individuals at the same time as it is to professional investors. 
Mr. Pitt also has endorsed some Levitt initiatives, and he has tried to go beyond Regulation FD in making corporate information available in a more broadly and timely way, by proposing a new system for companies' disclosure of market-moving news as events occur, rather than quarterly. 
But the Enron case offers the most visible opportunity for defining Mr. Pitt as an enforcer. He has made it a high priority, assigning a team of about six attorneys and accountants to unravel the company's complicated books, according to a person familiar with the probe. He pesters probers for regular progress reports, and even questions investigation strategy at times, according to this person. 
Mr. Pitt has said he intends to make Enron an example of his push for "real time" enforcement, to speed up the slow pace of some SEC investigations. But Gregory Bruch, a former SEC enforcement attorney, says Enron's involvement with partnerships and extensive energy-derivatives trading probably would take a year for the SEC to unravel. The SEC would have to "cut corners" to bring a case more quickly, perhaps naming fewer defendants than it otherwise might. 
Mr. Pitt declines to comment on specifics of the Enron case, except to say "the public can be confident . . . that we will deal with any wrongdoing and wrongdoers swiftly and completely." 
Yet even as Mr. Pitt stands to be judged for the SEC's handling of the Enron matter, the case holds particular complications for him that will restrict the chairman's own role. If the commission staff ultimately does recommend filing an enforcement action against Enron, Mr. Pitt must recuse himself at that point because a former client, Arthur Andersen LLP, also is under SEC investigation for its role as Enron's auditor. 
Mr. Pitt is required by SEC rules to recuse himself for at least a year from matters involving his former law firm or clients. He has already done so on several involving Big Five accounting firms, including an enforcement case involving a foreign affiliate of KPMG International in September. 
The possibility of his recusal in an Enron case adds to the pressure on the White House to fill four openings on the five-member commission. On Dec. 20, the administration announced plans to nominate two Republican accounting-firm executives: Paul Atkins, a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, and Cynthia Glassman, a principle at Ernst & Young LLP. But the Senate isn't likely to confirm them until Mr. Bush has nominees for the two other seats designated for Democrats. Without new commissioners, a decision on an Enron enforcement action would be left to the lone current commissioner besides Mr. Pitt -- Republican Laura Unger, who is serving under an expired term. 
Meantime, Mr. Pitt has been trying to mend fences with critics. At Mr. Pitt's request, he went to Capitol Hill to meet with Mr. Dingell on Dec. 12. Mr. Pitt "wants to be judged on what he does rather than what he's said in the past," recalls Mr. Dingell about that meeting, adding: "I think that's a wise choice."

How to Spot Signs of Companies' Distress

On Friday, Nov. 30, two days before Enron filed for bankruptcy-court protection, its shares were trading at 26 cents -- down from a high of $90 and a little late for investors to decide to ditch the stock. Ditto for investors in any number of other big corporate casualties this fall, including Bethlehem Steel, Federal-Mogul and Polaroid. 
But astute investors realize there are some early-warning signals that work better than plunging stock prices to tell them to head for the exits. And as more companies seek protection from U.S. Bankruptcy Court, predicting whether a company may file becomes an ever-more-relevant skill.
The stakes are higher than they used to be in reading the market equivalent of tea leaves. First, the number of bankruptcy filings is up sharply this year, and many experts believe more are to come in the current unsettled economic climate. Chapter-11 bankruptcy filings by publicly traded companies hit a record 143 this year, affecting $76 billion of debt, compared with 119 the previous year on $30 billion of debt, according to David Hamilton, a specialist on defaults for Moody's Investors Service in New York. 
Moreover, many companies that file for bankruptcy protection nowadays are more likely to end up in liquidation than in the past, analysts say, making the stock of a distressed company less likely to be worth much. It isn't only New Age telecommunications companies -- becoming famous for the plummeting values of their fiber-optic networks and other assets -- that may be valued less in bankruptcy court than their shareholders hoped. The same may prove true for retailers now in Chapter 11 proceedings, restructuring advisers warn. 
Here is a guide to a half-dozen barometers of financial health watched by sophisticated investors for signs of potential bankruptcy, some are easier than others for average investors to follow on their own: 

SWAPS THAT SWEAT IT OUT: The derivatives markets can be especially valuable as an early-warning signal -- particularly the credit-default swap market, where institutional investors seek financial protection against corporate bankruptcies. The default swap market is probably the most sensitive measure of how market participants view corporate prospects. 
For example, the credit-derivatives market was far ahead of the rating agencies in suggesting that once-mighty energy trader Enron was a weak credit. Weeks before the Houston company sought bankruptcy-court protection, pricing on Enron protection was far more expensive than it should have been, given Enron's then investment-grade rating. Essentially, these credit swaps are a form of insurance on Enron debt; if Enron defaults, the buyer of such a swap goes to the seller of the swap and receives 100 cents on the dollar, regardless of how worthless the debt may have become. 
In September, shortly after Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling stepped down, there was a drastic increase in Enron credit-default swap volumes, and spreads doubled on Enron risk to a steep 2.75 percentage points over the London Interbank Offered Rate, the short-term rate off which banks price some loans. 
By October, with the announcement that the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating Enron's financial statements for accounting irregularities, spreads doubled again, to more than five percentage points. Then, after Enron lost access to the commercial-paper market, spreads rose to an almost prohibitively expensive 15 percentage points, according to data from KMV LLC, a credit-risk-management service in San Francisco. Meanwhile, the shares edged down to $13 from $37 during the course of the month, levels that didn't hint at the fate that would overtake Enron just a few weeks later. Indeed, the shares didn't drop below $1 until Nov. 28, from above $4 on Nov. 27. 
(Unfortunately, there isn't a market for many corporate names below investment grade, unless, like Enron, they plunge rapidly into junk territory.) 

DEBT THAT DIVES IN VALUE: Often the secondary bond market can provide valuable clues about a troubled company's fate, as bond analysts are much more focused on a company's ability to repay its debts. They scour information pertinent to the sort of distress that leads to a filing. 
Henry Miller, vice chairman of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, an investment-banking and advisory boutique, has worked out a formula as follows. "When the bonds start trading between 90 cents and 80 cents on the dollar, a light bulb goes on," he says. "When the bonds then fall to between 60 cents and 80 cents, that tells you that somebody is nervous. And when they start trading between 40 cents and 60 cents, it is a question of when, not whether. And when they go below 40 cents, a filing is -- to varying degrees -- imminent." 

BANKING ON TROUBLE: Another indication that a company may be about to seek bankruptcy-court protection is when it draws down all its credit or standby credit lines from its bankers, according to Brad Eric Scheler, head of the restructuring practice for law firm Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson in New York. Such drawdowns are also an early-warning symptom that a company anticipates a turn for the worse in its fortunes. 

CONSCIOUSNESS OF RATIOS: Financial distress quickly translates into a company violating its lending agreements with its bankers. Such violations allow the banks to pull their lending lines or even declare a company in default. While information about the relationship between bank and client usually isn't public, there are certain relevant financial ratios that can provide clues. For example, lending agreements oblige most companies across a wide range of industries to keep the debt level at no more than about seven or eight times earnings before interest payments, taxes and depreciation. If the amount of the debt is far greater, investors can assume the banks aren't happy. Unhappy bankers can even petition the courts to push their client into involuntary bankruptcy. 

A DATE WITH DEBTHOLDERS: Figuring out the timing of a filing can be tricky, of course. One indicator watched by many hedge funds: whether a potential Chapter 11 candidate has an onerous interest payment coming up. Managers of these sophisticated investment pools assume that a troubled company would prefer to file before, rather than after, paying out large sums of precious cash. 
But that may not be a sure thing. For example, in advance of a scheduled payment on Global Crossing bonds in November, many hedge funds made bearish bets on the telecommunications company, which already had drawn down bank lines, anticipating it soon would be in violation of its bank covenants and would seek bankruptcy protection. The company, though, met the cash call, and the hedge funds closed out their losing positions. On Friday, Global Crossing announced it had come to agreement with its bankers on loan covenants. 

FLASHING RED LIGHT: Some signals couldn't be more glaring. If a company retains bankruptcy counsel or calls in restructuring-advisory boutiques, such as Greenhill & Co. or Blackstone Group or Lazard Freres & Co., it is reasonably certain a company is at least considering bankruptcy. (Another reason for some hedge funds' bearishness on Global Crossing: It has hired a restructuring adviser, according to people familiar with the matter; it won't comment on the matter, saying its relationships with any advisers are confidential.) 
One of the messages that restructuring advisers tell their clients is to file early. That means investors can be caught off guard more easily since some recent bankruptcy-court filers, such as Covad Communications Group, have had significant amounts of cash on their balance sheets.

Investors Forecast Unreal 401(k) Gains Savings: Study finds near-term expectations subdued, but long-term projections of returns overly optimistic.

Two straight years of stock market losses have left America's 401(k) retirement savers with muted expectations for 2002, but in many cases their longer-term forecasts remain wildly optimistic, according to a new survey. 
The November poll of 500 participants in 401(k) plans, to be released this week by No. 2 mutual fund provider Vanguard Group, found that respondents expect an average 7% annual return on stocks over the next year or two. It's the first time a national survey has found 401(k) investors expecting less than double-digit returns on their accounts, according to Vanguard.
But many savers still have a rosy long-term view of the market, the poll found. Nearly one-fourth of respondents expect stock prices to rise 30% to 100% a year over the next two decades--in line with the results of public-opinion surveys from the height of the late-1990s bull market. Even the respondents' median forecast of 15% annual gains is well above historical stock market returns, which have averaged 10.7% a year since 1926. (Median means half the forecasts were higher and half were lower.) 
Experts say the optimistic responses indicate that, for some investors, the euphoria of the bull market that crashed in the spring of 2000 still lingers. 
"There's some recognition of how tough the current market environment has been," said Barbara Fallon-Walsh, a Vanguard principal who oversees the firm's 401(k) education programs. "But longer term, it might be that hope springs eternal." 
Still, she said she was encouraged by investors' "reasonable" near-term expectations, by the fact that most savers have stayed the course in a rough environment for stocks and that many recognize the need to save more money to meet their goals. 
Only 15% of respondents reported making a 401(k) portfolio change in the last six months. Twenty-two percent said they intend to contribute a higher portion of pay in the next six months, compared with 12% who raised their savings rate in the previous six months. 
When it comes to long-term expectations for stock prices, several prominent professional investors have issued far tamer forecasts than those recorded by Vanguard's pollsters. 
Billionaire Warren Buffett, for example, said investors should be happy with 7% to 8% annual returns over the next decade. New York-based Standard & Poor's Corp. predicts returns of 6% to 7% a year over the next five to 10 years, and Roger Ibbotson, head of Chicago investment research firm Ibbotson Associates, expects gains averaging 9.4% over the next 20 years. 
That's a far cry from the 20%-plus annual gains investors came to expect during the 1990s. The pros cite several reasons for their conservative expectations, including the fact that stocks are still pricey by historical standards. 
Vanguard's survey also found that investors' expectations for bonds and money market funds are modest for the near term, but unrealistically buoyant over the long haul. Respondents expect annual returns of 7% for bonds and 4% for ultra-safe money markets over the next year or two--close to historical averages. But over the next decade or two, the median forecast is for 10% annual gains for both asset classes, while the average forecast, skewed by the extreme optimists, calls for 15% returns for bonds and 16% for money markets. 
So-called defined contribution retirement plans, including 401(k)s, allow workers to save for retirement by investing tax-deferred income through a menu of investment options that typically includes stock and bond mutual funds, their employer's company stock and a money market fund. More than 40 million Americans take part in the plans. 
The hazards of owning company stock in a 401(k) account is poorly understood, according to Vanguard's analysis. Respondents rated company stock as less risky than stock mutual funds, which experts consider much safer because of their diversified holdings. But respondents correctly identified individual stock in general as riskier than stock funds. 
"There are analogies in other areas, such as people's [often negative] perceptions of stock brokers and politicians," Fallon-Walsh said. "It's the attitude that 'mine is different.' It's the comfort of the known." 
Thousands of 401(k) savers at companies such as Enron Corp. and Lucent Technologies Inc. have seen their retirement savings crumble in the last two years because they invested too much in company stock. Many financial planners say workers shouldn't put more than 5% of their 401(k) holdings in their employer's stock, especially since their paycheck is also tied to the company's fortunes. 
The unrealistic long-term expectations of many, and the misperceptions of relative risk, point to the importance of 401(k) education programs, Fallon-Walsh said. 
"Between all the Web sites, company meetings with employees and the printed materials available, the table is set. It's just a question of getting people to sit down and eat the dinner."

Executives' Bonuses Stir Anger as Polaroid Sinks
JUSTIN POPE
ASSOCIATED PRESS

BOSTON -- In 1996, when Gary DiCamillo joined Polaroid Corp. as chief executive, the company had 10,000 employees and its stock was trading at more than $40 a share. Five years later, Polaroid is in bankruptcy proceedings, thousands have been laid off, and its shares trade for pennies each. 
But even as former workers scrounge for medical coverage, DiCamillo, who was paid nearly $850,000 last year, stands to earn up to twice that in bonus pay under a plan Polaroid has asked a U.S. Bankruptcy Court to approve.
The justification? Polaroid said it must pay millions to 45 top executives to make sure they don't jump the sinking ship before they can use their expertise to disassemble the company and pay off creditors. Some of the payments would be tied to how well the sales go, but others would be guaranteed. 
The plan has angered some former Polaroid workers, many of whom never got severance pay and lost thousands of dollars in an employee stock plan. 
"[DiCamillo is] looking after his cronies at the top and he forgot about the people that have been there for years," said Noel Barry of Bellingham, Mass., a former employee who is on long-term disability and recently received word that Polaroid no longer will contribute to his insurance. 
These payments to executives, known as retention bonuses, are common in bankruptcy cases, and often creditors say it is money well spent--smart employees are as essential in bad times as in good. 
"It's not a crazy idea," said Alan Johnson, managing director of the executive compensation firm Johnson & Associates, who has testified for companies seeking approval for retention bonuses. "It's almost a necessity. The question is to whom and how much." 
Others say the ensuing bad publicity can outweigh the benefits. 
"From just a perceptual point of view, it certainly seems not to pass the ethical stink test," said W. Michael Hoffman, executive director for the Center for Business Ethics at Bentley College in Waltham, Mass. 
Generally, such arrangements mix guaranteed payments with incentives based on how long employees stay and how successful they are in selling assets. 
At Houston-based Enron Corp., nearly 600 employees received more than $100 million in bonuses last month as the company faced a merger that unraveled and then filed for Chapter 11. 
Boston bankruptcy lawyer Paul Daley said such payment proposals are increasingly common. 
"When I started 30 years ago, when someone filed a Chapter 11, one of the things you recommended was they take a cut in salary," Daley said. "Now the fear is always that executives without the bonuses would leave and would spend their time looking for their next job rather than concentrating on the needs of the company." 
Polaroid retirees ridicule such arguments. With a weak economy and Polaroid's reputation in tatters, they doubt recruiters are actively wooing the company's top executives. 
"Maybe they're right, these 45 people are essential to the reconstruction of the company, and if so, obviously shareholders ought to applaud such a move," Hoffman said. "I guess it's possible, but it does raise not only factual eyebrows but ethical eyebrows." 
Company spokesman Skip Colcord said: "This is an incentive to get key people with key skill sets to remain with the company through the Chapter 11 process." 
In considering retention bonuses, bankruptcy judges must determine whether the plans show proper business judgment. Among the factors considered are whether the employees are to blame for the bankruptcy and how likely they are to leave. 
Bill Coleman, vice president of compensation at Salary.com, a Wellesley, Mass.-based executive compensation firm, said the bonus plans are feeding on one another: Each time a plan is approved, it serves as justification for others. 
But scrutiny also is on the rise, because so many more Americans are invested in the markets than during the last recession. 
"When you have employees losing their pensions or locked out of selling stock when executives weren't, or kept out of their severance while the CEO is getting one," Coleman said, "those kinds of patterns create huge negative feelings toward the company."

Fewer Power Plants Slated; Worries Rise Energy: Electricity producers' spending cuts lead to a slowdown in construction, which may mean tight supplies as the U.S. recovers from recession.

HOUSTON -- Electricity producers' plans to curtail expansion, aimed at reassuring investors rattled by Enron Corp.'s collapse, are raising concerns that the U.S. may face power shortages in the next few years. 
Mirant Corp., NRG Energy Inc. and some rival generators shelved or postponed billions of dollars in projects this month to bolster their credit ratings after downgrades helped push Enron into Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
A decline in electricity prices has further reduced the incentive to build plants. The slowdown in construction may lead to tight power supplies as the U.S. economy recovers from recession, possibly next year, and energy demand picks up, investors and analysts say. 
"When the economy snaps back, we're going to have howls again asking, 'Why didn't we build more power plants?'" said Donald Coxe, manager of the $352-million Harris Insight Equity Fund. "In 12 months people will once again be predicting an energy crisis and asking why we were so stupid not to build more." 
Enron filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors Dec. 2 after investors grew concerned that the company, formerly the largest energy trader, was hiding debt at affiliated partnerships. Customers defected as the company's credit rating was cut to junk status and it couldn't raise cash needed to back trades. 
To avert similar downgrades, Atlanta-based Mirant is slashing capital spending by 40% and Minneapolis-based NRG is delaying $900million in spending on generators. Dynegy Inc., based in Houston, will spend less than $1.5 billion on projects, down from a budgeted $1.7 billion. 
"The last thing the market wants to see is a huge expansion program that requires huge cash flow," said Jeffrey Gildersleeve, an Argus Research analyst. "Management is going ahead with what's on the table now. The later stuff is being delayed." 
Shares of power traders and producers have fallen as investors fearful of an Enron-like meltdown shy away from debt-laden companies. In the last two months, Mirant shares have slid 43%, Calpine 36%, Dynegy 34% and NRG 14%. 
Gildersleeve projected about six months ago that about 320,000 megawatts of generating capacity would be built in the U.S. in the next five years. He now expects 150,000 to 200,000 megawatts. 
At least 185,000 megawatts must be added by 2010 to meet U.S. demand, the Department of Energy forecasts. A megawatt is enough power for about 1,000 typical U.S. homes. 
The deregulation of electricity markets in the U.S., first in New England and later in the Middle Atlantic states, California and parts of the Midwest, spurred developers such as Calpine and utilities such as Dominion Resources Inc. to break ground on new power plants in the last few years. 
Calpine, based in San Jose, added eight plants in the third quarter, quadrupling revenue in the period to $2.92 billion. Duke Energy Corp., the biggest U.S. utility owner, boosted third-quarter net income by 50% to $796 million as power sales rose. 
Profit from electricity sales is falling as the U.S. economy slows, in part because of caps imposed by federal regulators in the West to stem soaring prices that drove California's two biggest utilities to the brink of insolvency. 
This quarter, electricity prices at the California and Oregon border dropped to an average of $26.91 a megawatt, down 89% from $244.80 a year earlier. 
Calpine said it is now reviewing the company's plan to increase generating capacity to 70,000 megawatts by the end of 2005, a level that would make it the nation's biggest electricity producer. 
Even with the cutbacks, many energy company executives and analysts say they aren't worried about shortages. The industry will build plants where needs arise, they say. The western U.S. has added about 5,000 megawatts of capacity this year, an increase of 3%, with almost half coming in California. 
"If the players still see a need for power, the plants will get built," said Thomas Capps, chief executive of Dominion, owner of Virginia's largest utility. 
A lack of transmission lines is more likely to lead to shortages than would a dearth of power plants, said David Schanzer, a utility analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott. In some cities, such as New York and Boston, power lines can get overloaded, leading to blackouts during a heat wave.

Commentary UC Fund Managers Were Asleep at the Enron Wheel
PETER NAVARRO

The University of California is suing Enron to recover the $145 million it lost investing in the company's fallen stock. Methinks the lawyers got it wrong. Instead, folks like me--a UC professor and one of thousands of future pensioners--should be suing the university's portfolio managers. 
These "motley fools" apparently spent over a year riding a $90 stock all the way down toward 90 cents. This is a clear violation of the first three rules of modern investing: (1) cut your losses, (2) cut your losses and (3) cut your losses.
Maybe, with more than $50 billion of assets to track, UC's portfolio managers simply weren't paying attention when Enron began to circle around the Wall Street drain. More likely, these market un-wizards succumbed to the antiquated mind-set of traditional "buy and hold" investing. 
In the buy-and-hold investor's passive little world, the stock market is a "random walk" where stocks go up and down, but no one can predict the movements. So managers should buy stocks that broadly diversify one's portfolio and hang on for the ride. The problem with this theory is that Enron's meltdown was anything but random. 
Any prudent portfolio manager watching the stock could have seen the early-warning signs months ago. Fully one-third of Enron's business was in telecommunications--not energy. Like other telecom companies, Enron over- invested and wound up with a crushing debt when the sector collapsed. 
Add huge cost overruns on some projects in India and you have a certain recipe for the stock's long decline. 
The coup de grace came when word leaked of alleged accounting improprieties--the focus of UC's class-action suit. Yet this fraud came to light long after Enron had completed most of its collapse. 
Which leads me back to the original point. The stock took more than a year to fall because, while UC's portfolio managers were sleeping, most other large institutional investors were unloading Enron and cutting their losses. 
There are some lessons here. 
For individual investors, the stock market is very risky. To safely invest, buy broad-based index funds. If you pick stocks, have the discipline to sell any dog in your portfolio like Enron--or any one of a number of once high-flying tech stocks--that loses more than 8% to 10% of its value. 
For President Bush, who will soon press Congress to privatize Social Security, there is this troubling question: If supposedly sophisticated portfolio managers like those at the University of California can lose so much money, is it really prudent to allow individuals to gamble their Social Security on individual stocks? 
As for the courts, a jury will probably find Enron executives and some errant auditors from the Arthur Andersen accounting firm liable for actions worthy of a multibillion-dollar judgment. 
Personally, I would rather see any judgment used to make whole all of the Enron employees--below the executive ranks--who lost their retirement savings. 
Unlike the incompetent UC portfolio managers who could have sold their stock at any time and kept their losses small, these employees were forbidden to cash out. 
At least they have an excuse.

COLUMBUS, Ohio -(Dow Jones)- American Electric Power Co. (AEP) acquired the 160-megawatt Indian Mesa Wind Power Project in Iraan, Texas from Enron Wind Corp. of California. 
In a press release Monday, American Electric said it funded the $175 million acquisition internally, but it intends to seek project financing at a later time.
The energy company also agreed to assume responsibility for the fulfillment of previously announced long-term power supply arrangements with City Public Service, the municipal electric utility of San Antonio. Enron Wind will provide operations and maintenance services. 
The Indian Mesa Wind Project, which uses 107 Enron Wind 1.5-megawatt turbines, was completed in December. 
American Electric expects the acquisition to add to earnings. 
The company had 2000 earnings, before extraordinary items, of $631 million, or $1.96 a share, on revenue of $13.7 billion.

IN THE MONEY: CSFB Resigns From Enron Creditors Committee
By Carol S. Remond

A Dow Jones Newswires Column 
(This column was originally published Friday.) 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- "Either you're in or you're out."
But Credit Suisse First Boston apparently missed this memorable line from the movie "Ocean's Eleven." 
In fact, the Swiss banking giant can't seem to make up its mind when it comes to Enron Corp. (ENE). Just days after going through the trouble of getting a much coveted seat on Enron's unsecured creditors committee, CSFB had a change of heart and abruptly resigned. 
According to court documents filed with the U.S. bankruptcy court for the Southern District of New York, CSFB has now been replaced by Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale. 
CSFB stepped down from its position on the 15-member creditors committee shortly after it was formed on Dec. 12. 
Large banks and other creditors normally vie for membership in various creditor committees formed after a company files for bankruptcy in order to gain access to otherwise difficult-to-obtain information. Creditors also see membership as a way to guide a company's restructuring process in their favor. 
A spokesman for CSFB said the bank resigned after only one meeting of the creditors committee. "We decided that membership would take up too much time and bring relatively small benefits given our limited exposure" to Enron, he said. 
Enron filed for Chapter 11 protection earlier this month. The energy trader listed a trade debt to CSFB of $70.66 million in its bankruptcy filing. 
Even given CSFB's relatively modest Enron liabilities, some restructuring specialists were puzzled by the bank's decision to step down from the creditors committee. 
"When you're on the committee you get a birdseye view of the company's financials. It's quite intriguing that they chose to resign," a lawyer said. 
CSFB's move could have been prompted by the banks' decision to sell its exposure, another lawyer suggested. 
"They may just have wanted to take a look and then decided that they wanted to get out of their position," the second lawyer said. 
In addition to Westdeutsche, Enron's unsecured creditors committee includes: Enron's two lead banks, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup; ABN Amro Bank; Credit Lyonnais; National City Bank; Silvercreek Management Inc.; Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota N.A.; Oaktree Capital Management LLC; Bank of New York; St. Paul Fire & Marine Insurance Co.; Duke Energy Trading & Marketing LLC; National Energy Group Inc., Williams Cos. and Michael P. Moran. 
Separately, the creditors committee took steps late Thursday to set up procedures that would allow members to continue trading Enron's bonds and stock without violating their fiduciary duties. 
Such trading would be allowed "provided that any committee member executing such trades must establish and effectively implement the policies and procedures set forth herein, such as fire walls to prevent the misuse of non-public information obtained through its activities as a committee member," according to an application filed with the court by the creditors committee. 
Fire walls, also known as Chinese Walls, are a Wall Street staple, supposedly separating financial services groups' operations for ethical, fiduciary and legal reasons.

California Utility Regulator Lynch Comments on the Power Crisis
2001-12-31 03:03 (New York)


     San Francisco, Dec. 31 (Bloomberg) -- California Public
Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch talks about the power
crisis that hit California this year. Millions of Californians
lost their power during six days of blackouts in January, March
and May, and the state's two largest utilities, units of PG&E
Corp. and Edison International, are insolvent.

On the state's electricity deregulation plan, approved unanimously
by the California Legislature in 1996:

     ``One thing that's clear to me when I talk to people who were
around in 1996 is that no one anticipated the complete meltdown of
our power market. There weren't any safeguards or triggers built
into the plan to either evaluate or stop it if things went awry.''

On investigations by the Public Utilities Commission and the
California attorney general into alleged market manipulation by
power generators and traders:

     ``For the first six months of our investigation, which
started last December, we were in huge document fights with the
sellers, which went to the California Supreme Court. We won those
fights eventually, but that put us behind by about six months.''

     The legal fights delayed the investigation, and thus the
filing of criminal charges or lawsuits, Lynch said.

     ``It's a huge job to be able to determine trends and
concerns. So I don't think it's a surprise. And I think it's well
within the range of these investigations to take the time both the
PUC and the AG have been taking.''

On the bankruptcy of Enron Corp., once the world's largest energy
trader:

     ``Enron's business plan depended on a Wild, Wild West with no
cop in the market. And they got it. They got it for a while. One
thing that hurt Enron was the feds coming in and bounding
California's market. What's volatile and good for Enron is
burdensome and bad for California. Enron could squeeze every penny
out of this market and hold it over a barrel. And they did that
this year.''

Enron, Providian, Others Win the `Stocky' Awards: David Wilson
2001-12-31 00:43 (New York)


     (Commentary. David Wilson is a columnist for Bloomberg News.
The opinions expressed are his own.)

     Princeton, New Jersey, Dec. 31 (Bloomberg) -- Last year, this
column introduced the Stocky Awards, designed to commemorate some
of the year's standout performances in the U.S. stock market.

     It's time to bring them back for a second appearance. There
aren't any standing categories; each award is uniquely suited to
its recipient. The envelopes, please ...

     Rhymes with Dot-Com Award: Enron, naturally. The collapse of
Enron Corp., once the largest energy trader, produced the kind of
losses that investors in numerous ``dot-com'' companies sustained
during the past couple of years.

     Enron's shares plummeted 99 percent. Partnerships led by
Andrew Fastow, fired as chief financial officer in October, cost
the Houston-based company $1.2 billion of shareholder equity. The
company also restated 4 1/2 years of results, lost Dynegy Inc. as
a suitor, and made the largest Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing ever.

     Serves Them Right for All That Junk Mail Award: Providian
Financial Corp., the fifth-largest U.S. issuer of MasterCard and
Visa credit cards, was the year's worst performer among companies
still in the Standard & Poor's 500 index.

     Shares of the San Francisco-based company tumbled 94 percent
as loan losses mounted. The bank wrote off 10 percent of average
loans in the second and third quarters, and estimated that the
fourth-quarter figure would be 12 percent.

     Shailesh Mehta, chief executive officer since 1998, resigned
in October. In November, Providian said federal banking regulators
had prevented the company from issuing cards to less-creditworthy
consumers -- targeted in recent years -- and limited loan growth.

     It's a Family Affair Award: Ford Motor Co., the second-
largest automaker, and Hewlett-Packard Co., the No. 2 maker of
computers, share the honor.

     Ford named William Clay Ford Jr., great-grandson of founder
Henry Ford, as CEO. He replaced Jacques Nasser in October after
the Dearborn, Michigan-based company lost more than $1 billion
during the second and third quarters.

     The sons of Hewlett-Packard's co-founders, William Hewlett
and David Packard, decided to oppose CEO Carly Fiorina's plan for
the Palo Alto, California-based company to acquire Compaq Computer
Corp. for $23 billion.

     What's in a Name Award: Philip Morris Cos., the largest
cigarette maker, said in November that it wants to become Altria
Group Inc. and will ask shareholders to approve the name change in
April. Some similarly named companies weren't happy about that.

     Altira Group, a venture-capital firm in Denver, filed a
lawsuit seeking to block Philip Morris from making the change.
Altria Healthcare Corp., a Birmingham, Alabama-based provider of
health-care billing, consulting and training services, asked the
New York-based company to ``do the right thing'' and reconsider.

     Welcome to the S&P 500 Award: Real estate investment trusts,
omitted from the benchmark index since the 1970s, became eligible
again this year.

     Equity Office Properties Trust, the most valuable REIT,
joined the S&P 500 on Oct. 10. Equity Residential Properties
Trust, the second most valuable, followed on Dec. 3. Both are
based in Chicago, and billionaire Sam Zell is their chairman.

     Domino Theory Award: Companies targeted in asbestos-related
cases kept going into bankruptcy. Federal-Mogul Corp., W.R. Grace
& Co. and USG Corp., the owner of U.S. Gypsum, sought Chapter 11
protection as the number of claims increased. So did G-I Holdings
Inc., owner of GAF Corp., and U.S. Mineral Products Co. They are
among more than 40 companies to file since the 1980s.

     Claims tied to asbestos, which can cause cancer and lung
disease, also weighed on companies such as Halliburton Co., an oil-
services and construction company based in Dallas. Its stock
tumbled 42 percent on Dec. 7 after a Maryland jury ordered a unit
to pay $30 million in one case.

     Recession? What Recession? Award: The lineup of the S&P 500's
best-performing stocks hardly suggests that the U.S. economy ended
a decade-long expansion this year, or that the just-ended holiday
shopping season may have been the worst in 15 years.

     Retailers -- namely AutoZone Inc., Best Buy Co., Circuit City
Group, Office Depot Inc. and J.C. Penney Co. -- accounted for five
of the year's six largest percentage gains. Nvidia Corp., a maker
of computer-graphics chips, was the exception.

     Lowe's Cos., the second-largest chain of home-improvement
stores, also was a top-10 performer. The company's stock price
more than doubled, far surpassing the 13 percent gain for Home
Depot Inc., its bigger rival.

     Better Than Cipro Award: Providers of security software,
which safeguards computers against damaging programs such as
viruses, had a stellar year.

     Network Associates Inc., the maker of McAfee software, rose
more than sixfold. The Santa Clara, California-based company had
far and away the biggest gain in the S&P MidCap 400, an index of
smaller companies than those in the S&P 500. Its McAfee.com Corp.
unit, which sells software online, jumped more than sevenfold.

     Symantec Corp., which sells software such as Norton Anti-
Virus, more than doubled. The Cupertino, California-based company
finished the year by joining the Nasdaq-100 index, a gauge of the
Nasdaq Stock Market's biggest companies.

     I Remember California Award: Edison International and PG&E
Corp., the owners of California's two largest utilities, had an up-
and-down -- make that down-and-up -- year in 2001.

     Shares of both companies dropped in January to their lowest
price in more than two decades amid blackouts and a state takeover
of power purchases. PG&E, based in San Francisco, fell further in
April as its Pacific Gas & Electric unit filed for bankruptcy.

     Edison, the Rosemead, California-based parent of Southern
California Edison, and PG&E later rebounded as the state's power
crisis subsided. Their losses narrowed by the end of last week to
2.5 percent and 2.3 percent, respectively.

     The King Is Dead, Long Live the King Award: Video-rental
chains haven't disappeared, even as cable-television and Internet
companies pursue ``video on demand.'' Instead, their share prices
jumped amid growing demand for DVDs, which are more profitable to
rent than videocassettes.

     The largest U.S. chain -- Blockbuster Inc., owned by Viacom
Inc. -- more than tripled. Hollywood Entertainment Corp., the No.
2 chain, and Movie Gallery Inc., ranked No. 3, soared more than 10-
fold and were among the year's best-performing U.S. stocks.

     It's tempting to give an honorable mention to any stock
investor with an overall gain for the year, because the Dow Jones
Industrial Average, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite Index all
dropped. But there aren't any more awards around. Maybe next year.

As you are aware, legal is coordinating with the trading/origination groups in handling consensual termination transactions of our in-the-money positions with counterparties that are willing to do so.   Could you please spread the word that these transactions should NOT be done by entering into offsetting trades, but rather by entering into a Termination Agreement with our counterparty and the counterparty paying to Enron the agreed upon value.  Thanks.

Enron Says It Won't Issue Release on 4th-Qtr Results
2002-01-02 16:10 (New York)
Bloomberg

     Houston, Jan. 2 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the energy trader which filed for bankruptcy last month, won't announce its fourth-quarter results until March, spokeswoman Karen Denne said.
     The company, once the top energy trader, will include the results in a mandatory quarterly filing with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission, known as a 10-Q.
     ``That's what's required,'' Denne said. ``Earnings and the balance sheet will be out at the same time this year.''
     Shares of Houston-based Enron rose 3 cents to 63 cents. They fell 99 percent last year. Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Dec. 2.

Senate Democrats Launch Probe of Enron Collapse With Subpoenas
2002-01-02 15:09 (New York)
Bloomberg

     Washington, Jan. 2 (Bloomberg) -- The Senate Government Affairs Committee launched a probe of Enron Corp.'s collapse by issuing subpoenas for documents from the company's officers, directors and accountants.
     Senator Joe Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat who chairs the committee, said the subpoenas kick off ``a search for the truth, not a witch hunt,'' into questions such as whether analysts misled investors by touting Enron after they should have known it was in trouble.
     ``The suddenness with which this company fell is shocking,'' Lieberman said at news conference. ``Even the savviest investors on Wall Street were blindsided'' by an event that Lieberman said shook ``public confidence in the stock market.''
     The first hearing is scheduled for Jan. 24, the second day the Senate will be in session. The hearing will focus on Enron's use of energy derivatives and the lack of regulatory authority over its trading operations, Lieberman said.
     The subpoenas for documents are being sent to the officers and directors of the company since 1999, as well as Enron's auditors, Arthur Andersen LLP.
     Several other congressional committees are investigating Enron's bankruptcy, the largest in U.S. history, which sent its shares from $84.06 a year ago to 64 cents in afternoon trading. The Senate probe has political implications because it will be run by Democrats, and Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay is a friend of and fundraiser for Republican President George W. Bush.

                         Lay to Be Called

     Lay and former Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Skilling will eventually be called to testify, Lieberman said. Lay thus far has declined to appear before other committees.
     ``I will not consider the investigation complete without hearing from Mr. Lay and Mr. Skilling,'' Lieberman said.
     Lieberman, who ran for vice president in the 2000 election as Al Gore's running mate, said he would look into Lay's connections to the Bush administration and the formulation of its energy policy.
     ``Some executives of Enron had close relationships with people in the Bush administration,'' Lieberman said.
     Senator Fred Thompson of Tennessee, the top Republican on the committee, has been consulted about how to run the investigation in a nonpartisan fashion, Lieberman said.

                         SEC Investigating

     The Securities and Exchange is investigating whether Enron Corp. illegally hid the size of its debt from shareholders before collapsing in November. Also conducting probes are the House and Senate energy panels; two subcommittees of the House Financial Services Committee; and the Senate Commerce Committee's consumer
affairs subcommittee.
     Representative Henry Waxman, a California Democrat, has asked Vice President Dick Cheney to provide information ``about secret contacts'' that Cheney's energy task force had with Enron officials.
     The Government Affairs Committee is the top investigative panel in the Senate and was used by Republicans to probe former President Bill Clinton's Whitewater involvement and 1996 presidential campaign fundraising.

USA: UPDATE 1-Congressional panel turns up heat under Enron.
By Kevin Drawbaugh

(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

WASHINGTON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Fallen energy giant Enron Corp. faced further scrutiny on Capitol Hill on Wednesday with another committee announcing a probe of the company's collapse, possibly looking at connections between Enron and the White House. 
The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee's permanent subcommittee on investigations said it will subpoena documents next week and scheduled a hearing into the matter for Jan. 24.
"Enron's unexpected collapse raises some troubling questions that the governmental affairs committee will be asking," said Sen. Joseph Lieberman, the Connecticut Democrat who chairs the full committee. 
A Wall Street darling just a few months ago, Enron on Dec. 2 made the largest bankruptcy court filing in U.S. history after a rescue takeover by rival Dynegy Inc. fell apart amid investor concerns about Enron's murky finances. 
Houston, Texas-based Enron is now under investigation in Washington by the market-regulating Securities and Exchange Commission, the departments of Justice and Labor and at least five congressional committees. 
In response to questioning at a briefing, Lieberman said he would not rule out the committee looking into ties between Enron and the administration of President George W. Bush. 
"It's a matter of public record that executives of Enron had close relationships with people who are now in the Bush administration. They also had close relations with some Democrats," Lieberman said. 
Several of Enron's top executives were major backers of Bush's election campaign, as well as those of other Washington politicians. 
Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay "and others played an active role in the formulation of energy policy by the Bush administration," Lieberman said. 
"We've got to ask whether the advice rendered was at all self-serving," he said. "There are some interconnections here with the Bush administration but that is not the focus of this investigation." 
Sen. Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who chairs the permanent subcommittee, said the investigation would focus on the role of Enron's directors in the collapse, the accounting firm Andersen in its audit of Enron's financial statements, and the company's use of complex financial partnerships. 
Once ranked No. 7 on the Fortune 500 list of top companies, Enron's stock was trading up 4 cents, or 6.7 percent, at 64 cents a share on the New York Stock Exchange in early afternoon trading on Wednesday, off from an August 2000 high of $90.56. 
Thousands of Enron employees lost their jobs and much of their savings. A 401(k) retirement plan that made many of them heavily dependent on company stock came under fire at a congressional hearing last month when employees said they were unable to sell their holdings when the stock price plunged. 
"I'm particularly concerned with reports that top executives at Enron were selling their shares of company stock at very high profits while lower-level employees were forbidden from selling theirs," said Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican and ranking minority member of the permanent subcommittee. 
The Wall Street Journal, citing internal company documents, reported on Wednesday that top Enron officials knew about financial partnerships involved in the company's downfall and were aware of possible conflicts of interest. 
"Something was very rotten in the state of Enron," Levin said, adding that his subcommittee would look into what appeared to be "layer upon layer of conflicts of interest." 
Lieberman said no decision had been made on whether to subpoena Lay or other Enron executives. Asked whether SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt would be called before the committee, he said, "We will be calling Mr. Pitt."

Enron's Lay to testify to Congress in Feb after backing out of prior hearings

01/02/2002
AFX News
(c) 2002 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

WASHINGTON (AFX) - Enron Corp chairman and chief executive officer Kenneth Lay has informed Senate lawmakers that he will appear before Congress in February to testify on the energy group's collapse after he failed to attend two similar hearings in December, Congressional aides told AFX News. 
Lay has been invited to Congress to answer lawmakers questions on the events surrounding Enron's collapse -- the largest corporate bankruptcy in US history -- before the Senate Commerce Committee which is due to hold a hearing into the affair on Feb 4.
"Enron's chairman has indicated that he will be testifying," said a spokesman for Democratic Senator Byron Dorgan, who is scheduled to chair the hearing after Congress returns from its winter break in late January. 
At two previous hearings in December, Lay declined to appear before Congress to testify at the last minute, prompting several lawmakers to caution him in his absence that Congress has the power to subpoena witnesses if it desires. 
Congress is trying to discover if Enron withheld any material information from its auditors. 
Lawmakers also want Enron to answer questions about the freezing of its employees' pension funds, and they are also seeking to find out why Lay divested millions of dollars of Enron stock earlier this year prior to investors losing billions of dollars in the failed company.

Enron: CFO Shouldn't Testify At Change-Of Venue Hearing

01/02/2002
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK (AP)--A lawyer for Enron Corp. (ENE) argued in bankruptcy court Wednesday that the Houston-based energy company's chief financial officer, Jeffrey McMahon, shouldn't have to answer questions at a hearing next week to decide whether to move the trial from New York to Houston. 
"It's not a subject on which he's competent to testify," said Howard Comet of the law firm Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP.
Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez delayed any ruling until Friday, giving Comet time to try and convince lawyers representing Dynegy Inc. (DYN), as well as others seeking to move the trial, that no Enron executives should have to testify at the hearing scheduled Monday. 
Dynegy, an Enron rival, backed out of a deal to buy the company after once-mighty Enron said it was in worse financial straits than it had originally disclosed. 
A lawyer for Dynegy, H. Rey Stroube, said he wants at least one Enron executive to explain why the company believed it was important for the case to be heard in New York instead of Houston and whether money could be saved if the case were administered in Texas. 
Comet told the judge that he would try to answer that question, and others, by Friday afternoon, when the parties reconvene in a conference call to discuss the matter, although he said it would be a "practical impossibility" to do so. 
Analysts say that Dynegy and other parties suing Enron believe they would get a more favorable hearing in Houston, whose economy has suffered greatly as a result of Enron's demise. 
If Stroube were still unsatisfied Friday and the judge sided with him, Comet said he would be willing on Monday to call into court the chief counsel of Enron North America, Mark Haedicke, to explain why the parent company filed for bankruptcy in New York.

IN THE MONEY: Enron DIP Financing Likely To Shrink
By Carol S. Remond

01/02/2002
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE)'s $1.5 billion rescue package may be scaled back amid lingering apathy among bankers recruited to take part in the loan.
Enron's better-than-anticipated cash position, now that the company has stopped servicing its debt, coupled with the lack of appetite of banks tapped to help syndicate Enron's debtor-in-possession, or DIP, financing is likely to result in a smaller loan, people familiar with the matter said. 
The interim financing was first negotiated by Enron's two lead lenders, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and Citigroup (C) in early December shortly after the energy trader filed by Chapter 11 protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. 
Final approval of the DIP was first scheduled for Jan. 7, but has since been postponed to the end of the month. 
DIP financing is crucial to allow bankrupt companies to continue operating. Enron's original loan package was approved by judge Arthur J. Gonzalez on Dec. 3. A first $250 million installment was made available to Enron but has yet to be tapped by the company. 
People familiar with the matter said Enron provided its two lead lenders with a business plan this past weekend. That should, upon review and approval by J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup, open the door for the release of another $250 million. 
But it's now unclear whether all or any of the remaining $1 billion will be made available to Enron. 
Under the original DIP package, the $1 billion is contingent on a number of conditions, including full syndication of the loan and the filing for bankruptcy of Enron's Transwestern Pipeline to secure the return of $550 million to J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup. (The $550 million is part of a separate $1 billion financing deal put together by the two banks in mid-November as they rushed to try to keep Enron out of bankruptcy.) 
J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup floated a syndication term sheet to other large banks in mid-December but found that most were reluctant to take on more exposure to Enron. The DIP loan carries a 350 basis points (3.5 percentage points) over the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), interest rate. 
Banks traditionally agree to provide DIP financing as a way to assure they'll be able to recoup some of their existing exposure to a company that has filed for bankruptcy. Those loans are seen as safe because, under bankruptcy law, they're most senior and are repaid ahead of anything. 
In the case of Enron, however, worries about how much of the company's outstanding loans can be recouped and the relatively large exposure of some financial firms, have many rethinking more Enron financing. 
It's unclear whether the Transwestern Pipeline, one of Enron's prized assets, will file for bankruptcy if the DIP is cut back. 
If not, J.P. Morgan and Citigroup will likely have to keep the $550 million revolver loan they made to Enron in November on their books, instead of getting that cash back. That means the banks will likely end up owning at least part, if not all, of the TransWestern Pipeline which is used to collateralize the loan.

=DJ US Govt Affairs/Enron-2:Enron, Andersen To Get Subpoenas
2002-01-02 15:26 (New York)
Bloomberg
 
  At a Capitol Hill press conference Wednesday, Lieberman and Levin promised a
sweeping probe of the company's internal decision making and potential
conflicts of interest, and why auditors and Wall Street analysts failed to warn
investors of the company's problems. 
  Ultimately, the committee aims to determine what changes in federal
regulations and oversight are needed to prevent a recurrence of Enron's
financial implosion. 
  "The suddenness of this company's fall was shocking. Even the savviest
experts on Wall Street were blindsided," Lieberman said. 
  After emerging in the 1990s as a Wall Street darling, the company's stock
price was trading at more than $80 a share a year ago. 
  But Enron's equity value collapsed after it became known how the company
overstated its earnings by nearly a half billion dollars since 1997. The
company reduced its equity value by $1.2 billion in the fall, and Enron filed
for bankruptcy protection Dec. 2 with shares selling for less than a dollar. 
  The collapse cost investors billions of dollars and wiped out the retirement
savings of thousands of Enron employees while top executives collectively sold
stock worth about $1 billion. 
  The committee will hold its first hearing Jan. 24, one day after Congress
convenes, Lieberman said. The investigation will seek to uncover "the flaws in
our system that allowed so many people to be victimized by Enron's collapse,"
he said. 
  Lieberman said the committee's probe is intended to identify what steps
government agencies should take to prevent another financial collapse like
Enron's. 
  The investigation will be "a search for the truth, not a witch hunt," he
pledged. 
  Nevertheless, Lieberman acknowledged concerns about Enron's political
influence with the Bush administration, particularly Enron Chairman Ken Lay's
role in helping frame the White House's energy-policy blueprint issued last
May. 
  The committee is engaged in "a search for the truth" that "will go where the
investigation takes us," he said. 
  Still, Lieberman noted Enron's "close relations with some Democrats" and
emphasized that political influence wielded by Enron won't be a focus of the
probe. 
  Levin said his subcommittee would issue subpoenas Wednesday to Enron's board
of directors and top company executives seeking documents related to decisions
involving the establishment of offshore partnerships the company formed, with
the involvement of key company executives. 
  Those special-purpose entities engaged in stock and energy derivatives
trading at the core of Enron's financial problems. 
  Next week, the subcommittee will issue subpoenas to Arthur Andersen, Enron's
outside auditor, Levin said. 
  The subcommittee will delve into "what appears to be layer upon layer of
conflicts of interest" involving the transfer of Enron debt to the
partnerships, Levin said. 
  "Something was very rotten in the state of Enron," Levin said. Either laws
and regulations were violated, or those laws and regulations were inadequate to
prevent Enron's problems from occurring in the first place, he said. 
  "A lot of people were either duped or didn't care," Levin said of the
involvement of company officials, Wall Street analysts and auditors. 
  "Something this massive should never happen again and it shouldn't have
happened in the first place," the subcommittee chairman said. 
  While implicitly critical of the failure of government agencies to prevent
Enron's debacle, Lieberman noted that government "can't protect from every
angle, particularly with a company that was prepared to violate the law, as
this company appeared willing to do." 
  The Governmental Affairs Committee investigation marks the fourth
congressional panel to initiate a probe of Enron's collapse. The Senate
Commerce Committee is delving into the matter, as are the Energy and Commerce
and Financial Services committees in the House. 
  Lieberman defended his committee's interest in the matter and pledged to
cooperate with other congressional committees in its investigation. The
Governmental Affairs Committee was "uniquely created to investigate something
like this," Lieberman said. 
  Levin called Enron's financial collapse "a multifaceted problem." With so
many aspects to explore, there is "more than enough" room for another panel to
weigh in, he said. 
  An Enron spokeswoman Wednesday declined to comment regarding the committee's
probe. The company deferred to its outside legal counsel, Robert Bennett, for a
response to Lieberman's assertion that Enron was willing to break the law.
Bennett, who represented former President William Clinton in the Paula Jones
case, was not immediately available.

Andersen Announces Results of Audit Quality Peer Review

01/02/2002
PR Newswire
(Copyright (c) 2002, PR Newswire)

CHICAGO, Jan. 2 /PRNewswire/ -- Andersen today announced that its system of accounting and auditing quality has been deemed to provide reasonable assurance of compliance with professional standards, following the most extensive peer review in the firm's history. Deloitte & Touche's report, which includes an unmodified opinion for the review year ended August 31, 2001, has been accepted by the Peer Review Committee of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' (AICPA) SEC Practice and is available at the AICPA, http://www.aicpa.org/members/div/secps/index.htm . 
Every three years since 1978, major accounting firms, under the oversight of the Public Oversight Board (POB), have been engaged to conduct reviews of the accounting and auditing practices of member firms in the AICPA SEC Practice Section (SECPS). The scope of this year's peer review of Andersen was expanded after financial reporting issues emerged at Enron Corp. Andersen requested, and Deloitte & Touche had separately concluded, that expanded procedures were appropriate. Deloitte & Touche independently determined the scope of the expanded peer review procedures.
In total, the peer and Andersen's internal practice review covered 240 Andersen audit engagements in over 30 Andersen offices and the Andersen national office. The engagements reviewed by Deloitte & Touche reviewers and Andersen practice review teams involved some 45 percent of Andersen's U.S. audit partners. The engagements selected for review represented a cross-section of Andersen's accounting and auditing practice with emphasis on higher-risk engagements. It included examining working paper files and reports and interviewing engagement personnel. 
Deloitte & Touche's opinion was "unmodified," without qualification. However, three issues not deemed significant enough to affect the opinion were raised in an attached comment letter. Such comments are not unusual in peer review reports. The comments related to: documentation of certain auditing procedures on some engagements; communications with audit committees in some instances; and management representation letters that needed more tailoring in some instances. 
In its response to Deloitte & Touche's comments, Andersen said it had taken, or would take, the steps recommended to improve its accounting and auditing practices.

Enron, Economy, Market Woes Weigh On Banks' 4Q >C BK JPM
By Tara Siegel Bernard

01/02/2002
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- There are a handful of words that will consistently dot the fourth-quarter earnings statements of the nation's largest banks - the economy, Enron and Argentina.
Those are the culprits behind the quarter's feeble profits, reflecting the continued drag of the soft economy on financial firms, exacerbated after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center that shuttered financial markets for four days. 
A string of banks - including J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM), Bank of New York Co. (BK), FleetBoston Financial Corp. (FBF) and some smaller institutions - have already prepped investors with announcements that their quarterly results would be light. The banks cited the rising number of loan defaults, weak capital markets, poor returns on venture capital investments and costs tied to restructuring operations. 
"This outlook incorporates the weak economic backdrop together with the natural tendency for fourth-quarter earnings to include 'clean-up' items," analyst George Bicher of Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown. wrote in a research note. 
Some of the cleanup involves sweeping bad loans off their books. Enron Corp. (ENE), the beleaguered Houston energy concern, filed for bankruptcy protection on Dec. 2, in a move that shields the company from creditors as it seeks to reorganize. Enron's problems have branched out across Wall Street and the banking industry like tentacles, and some of its largest lenders - including J.P. Morgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) - will feel the sting. 
Adding to the credit quality pressure is Argentina's financial and political crisis, not to mention rising loan losses across the board. 
"With the consumer continuing to hold up relatively well thus far, the focus is clearly on commercial credit," said analyst Mike Mayo of Prudential Securities Inc. 
While market-sensitive revenue is likely to rise from the third quarter, it's still weak overall. Merger-and- acquisition activity was still meager, and losses are expected from venture capital portfolios as managers write down investments, analysts noted. 
Equity underwriting improved and debt underwriting should log healthy results, although it's not expected to hit the record levels of earlier in the year.

Citigroup Consumer Unit Helps Results 

Citigroup, the nation's largest bank, is expected to earn 73 cents a share, up from 63 cents in the third quarter (including a merger charge, it earned 61 cents), and 65 cents in the comparable quarter a year earlier, according to a Thomson Financial/First Call survey. The consumer business, which includes Citigroup's credit-card and consumer finance operations, is expected to post strong results. Though costs to cover bad loans will likely rise modestly, they will be offset by higher fees and improved net interest margin yields - or the difference between the bank's cost of funds and what it charges on loans - as funding costs dropped with falling interest rates. 
The Enron factor will likely dent results a bit: The unsecured portion - or the amount of the loan not backed by collateral - of Citi's estimated $900 million exposure to Enron is estimated at between $300 million and $400 million, analysts said. On the Argentine front, where Citigroup is one of the two largest foreign banks along with FleetBoston, the company could incur a loss of one to two cents a share, analysts said. 
J.P. Morgan Chase said that as a result of Enron's failure, it would take a charge of $220 million in the fourth quarter on top of a $235 million reduction in trading revenue. In December, the New York financial services company released more specifics on its exposure to Enron which totals $2.6 billion, up from the $900 million figure J.P. Morgan initially disclosed. About $2 billion of the total is secured. Argentine loan losses may also chip into results. Venture capital is another likely sore spot, as the firm will probably have to write down the value on some investments. Other market-related businesses, including trading, are expected to be weak. 
J.P. Morgan, the nation's second-largest bank with $712 billion in assets, is expected to earn 36 cents a share, compared with 51 cents in the third quarter (including merger and restructuring costs, it earned 22 cents), and flat with the fourth quarter a year earlier. 
Bank of America, the nation's third-largest bank with $625 billion in assets, said in November it would meet analysts' fourth-quarter expectations of $1.25 a share. That's slightly below third-quarter earnings of $1.28 (including costs tied to sales of two businesses it earned 51 cents), but ahead of the 85 cents a share in the comparable quarter a year ago. 
Credit quality will also take center stage at Bank of New York. The company said earlier this month that it would take a $275 million charge, largely to cover costs to dispose of its exposure to 24 emerging telecommunications companies and an energy-trading company (Enron). The bank has a total of $758 million in loan commitments to the companies and $488 million in loans outstanding. However, the bank said it will record an initial insurance recovery of $175 million from the terrorist attacks - it had several buildings within blocks of the WTC, including its headquarters. The recovery payments will partially offset those credit costs, and so the bank said it expects the items to reduce fourth-quarter earnings by six cents a share. 
At the time of the announcement, analysts' expected fourth-quarter earnings of 50 cents. The bank expects to meet that number, excluding the charge of 6 cents a share. That compares with 52 cents in the third quarter (including charges of 19 cents a share tied to the Sept. 11 attacks, it earned 33 cents) and 50 cents in the comparable quarter last year. The consensus earnings estimate for the latest quarter is now 47 cents a share.

Two state pension funds plan to sue over Enron loses

01/02/2002
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

INDIANAPOLIS (AP) - Indiana's two largest public pension funds plan to join a federal class-action lawsuit against Enron over millions of dollars the funds lost when the energy giant's stock collapsed. 
The Public Employees Retirement Fund and the Teachers Retirement Fund report they collectively lost about $24.2 million from the drop in Enron's stock value. Managers hope to recover that money for the pension funds that have a value of about $18 billion.
"We will certainly be involved as a plaintiff in this action," William Butler, executive director of the employee fund, told The Indianapolis Star. "As long as there is any prospect for recovery, I think it is incumbent on us to protect our members' money." 
Several states - including Ohio, Georgia, Washington and Florida - have sought to direct the nationwide lawsuit, which claims that Enron illegally misstated its financial health. 
Compared with other states, Indiana's funds were not hit hard. The teacher fund lost about $2.25 million of its $6 billion, and the employee fund lost roughly $22 million of its $12 billion. 
Fund managers said the losses would have no effect on present or future payouts. 
"Twenty-two million dollars is not insignificant by anyone's measure," Butler said. "But when you look at it in the context of the whole fund, it's thankfully not a very big number." 
About 150,000 workers, mostly state and local government employees, pay into the employee fund, with about 49,000 retirees or their families are drawing from the fund. 
The teacher fund includes about 80,000 working teachers and 35,000 retirees. 
William Christopher, director of the teacher fund, said he expected his board would move to sue the company. 
"It's our responsibility to do that," he said. "Even though we just weren't exposed (to Enron) a great deal." 
Indiana's constitution prohibited the government employees fund from investing in stocks until an amendment was approved in 1997. 
Proponents maintained that investing in the market would increase fund growth over time. 
Most of Indiana's investment in Houston-based Enron was in stock groupings that mimicked the S&P 500, managers said. 
Enron, which until recently was the country's seventh biggest company in revenue, filed the largest ever U.S. bankruptcy case Dec. 2 after rival Dynegy Inc. backed out of an $8.4 billion takeover offer. 
Enron's stock price fell from more than $85 a share a year ago to about 26 cents. 
New York state, which also is suing Enron, said it lost $58 million of its $112 billion pension fund in the plunge. Ohio's two largest funds, one for public employees and another for teachers, lost a combined $114.5 million.

Azurix Extends Waterworks Concession 3mths.

Azurix Corp.AZX 
Azurix BA, the waterworks concessionaire for Argentina's Buenos Aires province, will continue to provide services for the next three months rather than stepping down this month as announced in October, a provincial official told BNamericas.
The Enron-controlled company and the province will use the three-month period to work on a smooth transition and iron out financial differences, said the official, from Buenos Aires' works and public services ministry. 
Authorities are mulling two possible courses to take when Azurix finally leaves: launching an auction to select a new private operator or turning waterworks services over to the province. 
Azurix, which has been plagued with quality and service related problems, began its 30-year concession to serve 2.5 million residents of 49 districts in 1999, but called short its tenure due to the province's alleged "serious breaches" of concession terms.

NEW YORK -- Volatility and premiums on Enron's near-month options remain ex=
tremely high. It is a sign that investors are willing to pay a rich price f=
or option protection and expect the stock to be unsettled as the Houston co=
mpany sorts through its credit and debt problems and seeks to calm frazzled=
 investors.=20
Enron near-month defensive puts traded heavily in an otherwise quiet sessio=
n Wednesday, as investors bought them to hedge. The December 5 puts traded =
more than 10,000 contracts and jumped 45 cents to $1.10 at the Chicago Boar=
d Options Exchange. The stock closed down $1.98, or 28%, to $5.01, as of 4 =
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
Enron's calls traded actively as some investors sold them to generate incom=
e. Traders noted some call buying -- especially after Enron procured a thre=
e-week extension on a $690 million note -- as some hopeful investors bet on=
 Enron pulling through its troubles and proceeding with its merger with Dyn=
egy Inc. Enron's December 5 calls traded more than 14,500 contracts, compar=
ed with open interest of 710, as they fell $1.45 to $1.15 at the CBOE.=20
For investors who want to book a tax loss on beaten-down stocks, the "wash =
sale" rule can be a hurdle, because it essentially prevents taxpayers from =
selling stock or securities at a loss and then reacquiring "substantially i=
dentical" securities within a 30-day period before or after that loss. This=
 poses a problem for those who want to book a loss yet own stocks whose pri=
ces now make them attractive "buy" candidates.=20
In addition, the Internal Revenue Service has taken the position that the w=
ash-sale rule will disallow a loss if the investor sells an in-the-money pu=
t, because there is a strong likelihood that stock will be put to or acquir=
ed by the investor.=20
So investors typically get around the wash-sale rule by "doubling up": buyi=
ng additional stock or options, waiting at least 31 days, and then selling =
the original stock to book the loss. Investors double up by buying calls, w=
hich locks a price to buy stock and achieves the same effect as buying addi=
tional stock.

Dynegy Deal To Buy Enron Hits Crossroads
By Rebecca Smith and John R. Emshwiller
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

The Wall Street Journal

Even as it reiterated its intention to purchase Enron Corp., Dynegy Inc. is=
 coming under increasing pressure to renegotiate or walk away from the mult=
ibillion-dollar deal.=20
The pressure is stemming from the continuing slide in the price of Enron sh=
ares and the mounting financial problems at the Houston energy-trading comp=
any, the nation's biggest marketer of electricity and natural gas. During t=
he past month, Enron has taken a $1 billion write-off of assets, revised do=
wnward the earnings of the past several years and taken a $1.2 billion redu=
ction in shareholder equity.
The problems have been due largely to dealings Enron had with private partn=
erships, run by some of its own executives, under investigation by the Secu=
rities and Exchange Commission. In an SEC filing Monday, Enron disclosed hu=
ndreds of millions of potential additional write-offs as well as the possib=
ility that its weakening financial condition could force it to repay more t=
han $2 billion in loans by the end of the year.=20
As of 4 p.m. Wednesday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron =
shares fell $1.98, or 28%, to $5.01 each after having dropped 23% Tuesday. =
In excess of 115 million shares traded Wednesday, more than four times the =
volume of any other Big Board stock. Enron's bonds also again traded sharpl=
y lower, market observers said.=20
The turmoil spilled over to Dynegy's stock, which also was among the most a=
ctively traded on the New York Stock Exchange. As of 4 p.m. Wednesday, Dyne=
gy shares fell $1.94 to $39.76 each.=20
On Wednesday, Dynegy issued a statement in which Chairman and Chief Executi=
ve Chuck Watson said his company was working "to accelerate the regulatory =
approvals required to complete the merger in accordance with the previously=
 announced agreement" though it continued to perform "due diligence" on Enr=
on.=20
Under the merger agreement, Dynegy has opportunities to renegotiate or walk=
 away from the deal if Enron's financial and legal problems become severe e=
nough. However, some observers said it can be difficult to invoke these so-=
called material adverse change clauses. They point to a decision earlier th=
is year by a Delaware Chancery Court judge who forced Tyson Foods Inc. to c=
omplete a planned purchase of IBP Inc. even though Tyson, a Springdale, Ark=
., food-products company, had wanted to cancel the transaction because of a=
 drop in IBP's earnings and accounting problems at an IBP unit.=20
Dynegy officials didn't return calls seeking comment. To complete the deal,=
 two-thirds of Dynegy shareholders and a majority of Enron shareholders wou=
ld have to give their approval. No dates for those votes have been set.=20
One person familiar with the merger plans said the SEC filing Monday by Enr=
on contained information Dynegy hadn't known about. Dynegy representatives =
planned to work through the weekend evaluating the importance of this new i=
nformation as part of the company's due diligence, this person said. It cou=
ldn't be determined what the new information was.=20
The merger agreement, announced Nov. 9, calls for Dynegy to exchange 0.2685=
 share for each of Enron's roughly 850 million fully diluted shares, giving=
 the purchase a value of about $9 billion at Dynegy's current stock price. =
However, from a price standpoint, the deal is appearing less attractive to =
Dynegy.=20
On the day of the merger announcement, Enron shares were trading at about $=
8.63 each, or about 83% of the purchase price under the exchange ratio. As =
of Wednesday, Enron's market price was only about 47% of the merger-formula=
 price. Such a sharp deterioration is unusual following a merger announceme=
nt, when the stock price of the company being acquired generally begins tra=
ding relatively close to the offering price.=20
Sentiment among Wall Street analysts also is turning against the merger. In=
itially, many analysts lauded the merger as a move that would rescue Enron =
and provide a major boost to Houston-based Dynegy. Dynegy and Enron officia=
ls have predicted that the merger, supposed to be completed late next year,=
 would significantly and immediately increase Dynegy's earnings.=20
Now analysts are challenging that assumption. Ron Barone, managing director=
 at UBS Warburg LLC, said he believes that because of Enron's financial pro=
blems, a combined company would actually have lower earnings next year than=
 Dynegy would have by itself. Mr. Barone said he thinks a "likely scenario"=
 is that the merger formula will be renegotiated sharply down to about 0.15=
 Dynegy share for each Enron share.=20
Such a ratcheting down wouldn't be without precedent in the deal. According=
 to one person familiar with the merger negotiations, Dynegy reduced the ex=
change formula at least once prior to the Nov. 9 announcement because of En=
ron's rapidly sinking stock price, which at the beginning of this year was =
above $80 a share.=20
In perhaps the most significant sign of the turning tide on Wall Street, Go=
ldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer lowered his ratings on Enron and Dynegy=
. A longtime Enron fan, Mr. Fleischer issued a report expressing doubts tha=
t the merger would help Dynegy's earnings and whether Enron could "recover =
the significant business that has been lost" in its giant energy-trading op=
erations. "The Enron machine continues to sputter," Mr. Fleischer wrote.=20
Some observers say that if Dynegy walked away from the deal or tried to ren=
egotiate the terms significantly, Enron might be pushed into a bankruptcy-l=
aw filing. Without the Dynegy acquisition and continued support from its ba=
nkers and customers, an Enron bankruptcy-court filing "is highly possible,"=
 said Ralph Pellecchia, a senior director at Fitch, a credit-ratings agency=
. On Wednesday, Fitch maintained its credit rating on Enron at just one not=
ch above noninvestment-grade, or "junk," status. But Fitch also said it bel=
ieved Enron's trading partners had made "significant cash collateral calls"=
 in recent days that are "well in excess of previous expectations," contrib=
uting to "liquidity pressures."=20
Among the advisers Enron has hired during its current crisis is the law fir=
m of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, which specializes in bankruptcy and corporate-=
workout situations. Asked about a possible bankruptcy filing, an Enron spok=
eswoman said the company expects the Dynegy deal to go through and therefor=
e doesn't expect to have to look at alternatives to the merger. Since the m=
erger announcement, Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay has said his company had alt=
ernatives to the Dynegy deal but he has declined to identify them. Enron sa=
id it made some progress improving its financial position. The company said=
 it reached a final agreement with units of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Cit=
igroup Inc. on the remaining $450 million of a previously announced $1 bill=
ion in secured credit lines. Enron said lenders had agreed to extend repaym=
ent of an existing $690 million note to mid-December from next week. The sp=
okeswoman said a restructuring of that obligation is expected to be complet=
ed next month so that repayment wouldn't be required this year.=20

Enron Faces Suits by 401(k) Plan Participants
By Theo Francis and Ellen Schultz
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

11/23/2001
The Wall Street Journal
C1
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Enron Corp., the embattled Houston energy and trading company, has been sue=
d by members of its employee-retirement plan, which has suffered losses bec=
ause of Enron's plummeting stock price.=20
Two separate lawsuits, filed in federal court in Houston, allege Enron misl=
ed participants in its 401(k) retirement plan about the risks of investing =
in the company's shares and note that the company forced the employees to r=
emain invested in its stock even as the shares fell. Amid growing disclosur=
es of financial problems in recent weeks, the company "locked down" the ret=
irement plan from Oct. 17 to Nov. 19 to make administrative changes, which =
prevented employees from selling Enron shares as the share price collapsed.
Enron, which recently agreed to be acquired by Dynegy Inc., Houston, becaus=
e of mounting financial problems, has seen its stock price fall to $5.01 on=
 Wednesday from a peak of nearly $90 a share last year. The decline has bee=
n costly to participants in Enron's retirement plan because more than 60% o=
f the 401(k) assets were invested in Enron shares at the end of last year, =
according to one of the suits.=20
The first suit was filed Nov. 13 on behalf of plan participants by Campbell=
 Harrison & Wright LLP, a Houston law firm, and the second was filed Tuesda=
y by Seattle-based Hagens Berman LLP. Both seek class-action certification.=
=20
Enron said its corporate policy is not to comment on pending lawsuits. A sp=
okeswoman also said the company's 401(k) plan offers participants 18 invest=
ment choices, one of which is company stock.=20
The company's stock has fallen amid mounting losses and disclosures that it=
 had extensive off-balance-sheet dealings with a web of partnerships headed=
 by former company officials. The Securities and Exchange Commission has la=
unched a formal investigation into the company's accounting, and Enron has =
said it will restate years of financial information.=20
The suits against Enron are the latest of a series of suits filed against c=
ompanies over losses in the company-stock portion of their 401(k) plans. Th=
e suits allege the plan trustees breached their fiduciary duties by continu=
ing to offer company stock, even after they became aware of serious busines=
s problems that would hurt the stock price. All the suits are pending.=20
As with most of these companies, Enron matches employee contributions to th=
e 401(k) with shares of Enron stock, and also offers Enron stock as an inve=
stment choice, in addition to a variety of mutual funds. About $1.3 billion=
 of the plan's $2.1 billion in assets was invested in Enron shares at the e=
nd of 2000, according to the suit filed by Campbell Harrison.=20
Pamela Tittle, a participant in the 401(k) plan who worked in the finance d=
epartment and a named plaintiff in the Enron suit filed by Campbell Harriso=
n & Wright, had roughly 2,000 shares of Enron stock in her retirement accou=
nt and has suffered losses of about $140,000 as a result of the stock's dec=
line. The suit alleges that the trustees of the Enron 401(k) plan violated =
their fiduciary duties by not informing plan participants that the company =
stock was in peril.=20
The suit filed by Hagens Berman, also alleges that the company failed to wa=
rn participants about risks of remaining invested in Enron stock. In additi=
on, it accuses Enron of systematically misrepresenting its financial result=
s since 1998 in connection with the partnerships under investigation by the=
 SEC.=20
Roy E. Rinard, a lineman for Enron in Oregon who is a named plaintiff in th=
e suit filed by Hagens Berman, has seen the value of his retirement plan fa=
ll to $70,000 from $470,000, largely as a result of the decline in Enron's =
stock. "I feel like I have been betrayed," Mr. Rinard said in press release=
 issued by his lawyers. "I lost my savings, my plans for the future, everyt=
hing."=20
Under federal pension law, companies are allowed to offer their own stock i=
n retirement plans, and are allowed to force employees to hold onto the sto=
ck. Enron doesn't let employees diversify out of shares they receive as mat=
ching contributions to the 401(k) plan until age 50.=20
However, plan trustees are supposed to operate the plan in the best interes=
ts of the participants, which includes choosing prudent investments. Genera=
lly, to prove that the plan's administrators breached their fiduciary dutie=
s, employees must show that the trustees knew the stock was a bad investmen=
t. This presents a high hurdle, so it is not surprising that prior lawsuits=
 over losses in company stock in 401(k) plans have generally come in the wa=
ke of allegations of accounting irregularities.=20
Lynn Sarko, one of Ms. Tittle's attorneys with Seattle's Keller Rohrback LL=
P, is also co-lead counsel in a similar lawsuit against Lucent Technologies=
 Inc., Murray Hill, N.J. Another firm representing Ms. Tittle is Dalton Got=
to Samson & Kilgard PLC, which is lead counsel in a similar suit against Ik=
on Office Solutions Inc., Malvern, Pa. The two law firms are representing M=
s. Tittle with Campbell Harrison & Wright.=20
The suits against Lucent and Ikon, like the suit against Enron, allege that=
 then-current plan trustees kept offering company stock in the plan despite=
 knowing of serious business problems that would hurt the stock price. Repr=
esentatives for Ikon and Lucent say their companies didn't require employee=
s to invest in the company stock, and educated employees about the need for=
 diversification.=20
The suit in which Mr. Rinard is plaintiff notes that on Oct. 17, a day afte=
r Enron announced the company was taking a nonrecurring charge totaling $1.=
01 billion in the third quarter, Enron "locked down" the 401(k) plan's asse=
ts, preventing participants from selling Enron shares. (A "lock-down" occur=
s when a retirement plan is transferred from one administrator to another, =
and generally lasts several weeks, during which time participants can't mak=
e changes in their investment choices).=20
The lock-down was lifted on Nov. 19. In the interim, on Nov. 8, Enron annou=
nced it would be forced to restate downward its reported financial results =
from 1997 through 2000. By the time the lock-down was lifted, as a result o=
f all the negative news the shares had fallen to below $9 a share from $32.=
20 on Oct. 17, when the lockup started, Hagens Berman attorney Karl Barth s=
aid.=20
"They were locked into it right when Enron knew it was going to be announci=
ng some really bad news," Mr. Barth said. "Mr. Rinard's looking at having n=
o retirement savings now. It's a horrible thing to have to start over in yo=
ur 50s."

>From Sunbeam to Enron, Andersen's Reputation Suffers
By FLOYD NORRIS

11/23/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company

THIS has been the worst year ever for Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm =
that once deserved the title of conscience of the industry. The Securities =
and Exchange Commission filed civil fraud complaints against the Andersen p=
artner who audited Sunbeam and against the firm itself in the Waste Managem=
ent case.=20
Now Enron has repudiated the financial statements that were certified by Ar=
thur Andersen, in the process shaving more than half a billion dollars from=
 the company's reported profits in recent years.
All of which raises the question: Has Arthur Andersen become the black shee=
p of the accounting industry?=20
It is not an easy question to answer, and not everyone is willing to rush t=
o judgment. ''If you want to attack Andersen for Enron, you need to know mo=
re than we know,'' Arthur Levitt, the former chairman of the Securities and=
 Exchange Commission, said this week.=20
But if there is a thread connecting what is known about the three cases, it=
 is materiality. In all three cases, Andersen auditors spotted bad accounti=
ng but were persuaded it was immaterial and therefore allowed it to go ahea=
d.=20
Materiality is one of those flexible concepts that can get accountants into=
 trouble. The idea is that it doesn't much matter if a few little things we=
re gotten wrong. But they can add up.=20
At Enron, however, they did not add up to that much -- a total of $93 milli=
on over four years. The biggest restatement of Enron profits concerns a rel=
ated party that Enron now says should have been consolidated. It is not cle=
ar if Andersen had the facts needed to make that decision at the time.=20
To those who treasure the role of auditors, the humiliation of Andersen is =
painful. Back in the 1950's, it was Leonard Spacek, Andersen's managing par=
tner, who warned that ''the profession's existence is in peril'' because it=
 was not showing enough independence. His public prodding was crucial in ma=
king the industry do a better job. Two decades ago, when the issue on the t=
able was pension accounting, Andersen was the only major accounting firm to=
 break with clients and push for good rules.=20
Now Andersen's backbone is open to question. It was evidence that senior pe=
ople at Andersen repeatedly gave in to pressure from Waste Management that =
led the S.E.C. to bring that suit, which the firm chose to settle without a=
dmitting it had done anything wrong. The partner that the S.E.C. says looke=
d the other way at Sunbeam is fighting the accusations, and Andersen says h=
e acted properly.=20
Lynn Turner, who was chief accountant of the S.E.C. at the time and is now =
director of the Center for Quality Financial Reporting at Colorado State Un=
iversity, says what is happening to Andersen now is reminiscent of what hap=
pened to Coopers & Lybrand when he was a partner there and the firm had a s=
eries of highly publicized blown audits.=20
''We got bludgeoned to death in the press,'' he said. ''People did not even=
 want to see us at their doorsteps. It was brutal, but we deserved it. We h=
ad gotten into this mentality in the firm of making business judgment calls=
.'' By that he meant that the firm paid too much attention to not offending=
 clients and not enough to good accounting.=20
For Andersen to avoid that fate, its relatively new chief executive, Joseph=
 Berardino, who declined to be interviewed for this column, will need to se=
t a tone inside the firm making clear that he expects auditors to show the =
backbone that Mr. Spacek epitomized. And then he will have to convince the =
public of that.

Chase and J. P. Morgan's Paper Anniversary
A Year After the Merger, Rosy Plans Meet Reality
By RIVA D. ATLAS

11/23/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 5
c. 2001 New York Times Company

When William B. Harrison Jr. speaks of last year's $31 billion merger of J.=
 P. Morgan and the Chase Manhattan Corporation, he speaks proudly of a deal=
 that he considers to be a capstone to his 34-year career of helping build =
a giant of the banking business.=20
''This is the first merger I've been part of,'' said Mr. Harrison, the chie=
f executive of the combined bank, ''where I feel our core business is compl=
ete.''
The Chase-J. P. Morgan combination helped advance the bank into the investm=
ent banking elite, just as Mr. Harrison intended. But with Wall Street and =
the economy in far different places today than they were when the deal was =
put together, the many mergers, stock sales and other money-making opportun=
ities that were supposed to justify the high-priced acquisition have largel=
y dried up for now.=20
Consequently, deal makers and analysts who follow the bank are already spec=
ulating that Mr. Harrison, 58, may ultimately be compelled to do yet anothe=
r large deal, this time to diversify his business away from its heavy empha=
sis on Wall Street.=20
J. P. Morgan Chase has won some prominent assignments, like handling the re=
vampings of troubled giants like Lucent and, more recently, Enron, the bele=
aguered energy trading company.=20
But while J. P. Morgan Chase is proud of serving alongside Citigroup as bot=
h lead lender and adviser to Enron on its acquisition by Dynegy, the dual r=
ole it has worked to achieve sometimes proves complicated for the bank. Wit=
h Enron's shares in free fall as more information comes out about its hidde=
n debts, J. P. Morgan Chase has been scrambling to maintain the support of =
other banks while simultaneously keeping the merger with Dynegy on track.=
=20
Thanks largely to the slump on Wall Street, J. P. Morgan Chase's profits fe=
ll by two-thirds in the third quarter, to $449 million from $1.4 billion in=
 the period a year ago. Its stock has dropped 15 percent this year, more th=
an other banks' shares. The bank's stock is ahead of investment banks like =
Goldman Sachs, with which J. P. Morgan Chase increasingly competes.=20
''The jury is still out in many respects on this merger,'' said Judah Kraus=
haar, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. Nevertheless, he likes J. P. Morgan Chas=
e's stock, he said, because ''expectations are very low.''=20
All J. P. Morgan Chase's competitors are suffering from the slowdown on Wal=
l Street. But some, like Citigroup, are better diversified and have greater=
 involvement in old-fashioned consumer banking, which is proving to be a st=
rong moneymaker this year.=20
Nearly a third of J. P. Morgan Chase's revenues are consumer-oriented. By c=
ontrast, its chief New York rival, Citigroup, gets half its revenues from c=
onsumer businesses.=20
''The timing of the merger was bad,'' said Steven Wharton, a banking analys=
t at Loomis, Sayles & Company, which owns about a million J. P. Morgan Chas=
e shares. ''There's no disputing that.''=20
Actually, Mr. Harrison disputes it. ''I can't tell you how happy I am about=
 having done this merger,'' he said in a recent interview. ''While there ar=
e pluses and minuses to operating in a weak economic environment, we have a=
 much stronger platform to manage with during this difficult time.''=20
In Mr. Harrison's favor is his battle-tested team of top executives who hav=
e worked together for a decade or more. Few executives remain in the top sp=
ots from the old J. P. Morgan. Instead, most major posts are filled by mana=
gers who have worked with Mr. Harrison since his days at Chemical Bank, whe=
re he spent most of his career. Mr. Harrison's team successfully gobbled up=
 Manufacturers Hanover Bank in 1991, then followed that with Chemical's mer=
ger with Chase Manhattan in 1996 before incorporating Morgan into the fold =
last year.=20
The group of Chemical veterans includes Marc J. Shapiro, who oversees finan=
ce and risk management at J. P. Morgan Chase; Donald H. Layton, one of two =
leaders of investment banking; and James B. Lee Jr., the bank's senior deal=
 maker. The team also includes Dina Dublon, the bank's chief financial offi=
cer.=20
Two other senior executives have also lived through big deals. Geoffrey T. =
Boisi, the other investment banking leader, was the one-time investment ban=
king chief at Goldman, Sachs. David A. Coulter, in charge of Chase's retail=
 bank, had been chief executive of Bank of America before it was bought by =
NationsBank.=20
''There aren't many teams that have gone through as many mergers as Bill Ha=
rrison and his team,'' said Mark G. Solow, managing principal at GarMark Ad=
visors, an investment firm, and a former senior executive at Chemical.=20
Still, Ms. Dublon acknowledged that the tough economy was making the J. P. =
Morgan takeover more difficult than the earlier combinations.=20
''In general, mergers are very hard on morale,'' she said. ''There is no qu=
estion that this one has a tougher emotional toll.''=20
The bank's executives are making the best of a bad situation. They have tak=
en advantage of the slowdown to cut around 8 percent of the combined banks'=
 staff, or about 2,500 more employees than anticipated at the time the merg=
er was announced.=20
Many of these job cuts were aimed at high-cost investment bankers: J. P. Mo=
rgan Chase expects that 6,000 jobs in its investment banking division will =
have been eliminated by the end of the year.=20
''We have focused on the tougher jobs to cut,'' Ms. Dublon said.=20
In some ways the overall market turmoil has made it easier for J. P. Morgan=
 Chase to overhaul its staff. With fewer jobs available on Wall Street, Mr.=
 Shapiro said, the employees who are left behind are less apt to complain a=
bout changes in their jobs. ''People have fewer options,'' he said, ''so yo=
u have a little more control over the process.''=20
Thanks partly to these cuts, the bank estimates the saving from cost cuttin=
g will be $3.6 billion annually, compared with an original projection of $2=
 billion at the time of the merger.=20
The cost cutting has helped compensate somewhat for a sharp drop in profits=
 in the bank's core businesses. ''What we can control and are managing very=
 aggressively is the expenses of the company,'' Ms. Dublon said in a confer=
ence call with reporters on Oct. 17, the day earnings were announced.=20
Aside from cost cuts, the weakness on Wall Street makes it hard for the ban=
k's executives to point to tangible gains in investment banking, where fees=
 were down 24 percent in the third quarter. But Mr. Harrison points to mark=
et-share gains the bank has achieved at the expense of competitors on Wall =
Street. He hopes that when the investment banking business revives, J. P. M=
organ Chase will hold on to these gains.=20
The bank is particularly proud of its standing in two areas: mergers and ac=
quisitions, and the underwriting of large investment-grade bond deals.=20
The bank ranked 5th worldwide in the highly profitable category of advising=
 on mergers during the first nine months of 2001, up from Chase's 12th-plac=
e finish and J. P. Morgan's 10th-place standing during the same period last=
 year, according to Thomson Financial Securities data.=20
The merger and acquisitions business, which Chase had been slowly building =
for years, is stronger following the merger with J. P. Morgan, said Mr. Lee=
, a vice chairman at the bank. As a result, the bank is able to win assignm=
ents providing advice to customers who dealt with the old Chase only for lo=
ans.=20
Mr. Lee remains proud of the bank's work with Enron, the energy company, de=
spite its troubles. J. P. Morgan Chase, along with Citigroup, raised $1 bil=
lion in bank financing for Enron earlier this month. It was also hired to a=
dvise the company, which hopes to be saved from collapse by being taken ove=
r by Dynegy.=20
The old Chase, long a lending powerhouse, would have had a good shot at lea=
ding the bank financing, but an advisory role would have been less certain.=
 Mr. Lee said the investment banker advising Enron came from the old J. P. =
Morgan. But with merger activity slow, there are few such deals to go aroun=
d.=20
The bank is also proud of its strength in long-term investment-grade bonds,=
 another area that business executives say has been enhanced by the merger.=
 It moved up to second place in that area so far this year, compared with s=
ixth place a year ago.=20
The bank has taken advantage of a boom in large corporate bond offerings, a=
 surge driven by today's low interest rates. In May J. P. Morgan Chase rais=
ed $12 billion in bonds for WorldCom, the telecommunications company, in th=
e largest corporate debt deal in the United States on record.=20
Unfortunately for J. P. Morgan Chase, the fees for underwriting investment-=
grade debt are small compared with the money to be earned coordinating offe=
rings of stock, where J. P. Morgan Chase remains a second-tier competitor.=
=20
The bank actually lost market share in the rankings for underwriters of sto=
ck, falling to 9th place this year, compared with the old J. P. Morgan's 6t=
h-place finish a year ago. (Chase was 11th.)=20
Mr. Harrison said the bank was taking advantage of the slowdown in stock of=
ferings to build momentum slowly in that business. ''We think we have a cha=
nce in the second half of this year to be in the top five,'' he said.=20
Given the slowdown, some bankers predict that Mr. Harrison will ultimately =
do another deal, either to expand his consumer banking business or to bolst=
er weak areas in investment banking, like the equity division.=20
''The general view is that the combination with J. P. Morgan didn't do enou=
gh,'' one investment banker said.=20
Mr. Harrison disagrees: ''I don't feel,'' he said, ''we need to do another =
large deal to be successful.''

COMPANIES & FINANCE THE AMERICAS - Enron 'awaiting' capital injections, say=
 officials.
By ROBERT CLOW.

Officials working to shore up Enron's balance sheet yesterday said the stru=
ggling energy trader hoped to receive capital injections of more than $1.5b=
n as early as next week.=20
Enron is in talks about $250m investments with JP Morgan Chase and Citigrou=
p and is also hoping to raise at least $1bn from private equity investors.
People close to Enron declined to comment on which buyout firms might wish =
to invest in Enron. However, the Blackstone Group, which was reported to be=
 talking to the company before Dynegy made its $9bn rescue bid, is understo=
od no longer to be doing so.=20
Members of the 20-strong bank lending group, led by JP Morgan Chase and Cit=
igroup, are being asked to defer the maturities of their upcoming debt unti=
l after the completion of the merger.=20
The moves comes as reports from Goldman Sachs and Fitch, the credit rating =
agency, raised questions about the company's cash flow and its medium-term =
viability.=20
David Fleischer, a Goldman Sachs analyst, argued that cash balances were in=
adequate to meet $2.8bn of debt obligations falling due before the end of t=
he year.=20
People close to Enron say that nearly $1bn of that debt has already been re=
structured.=20
The Fitch report said that if the Dynegy deal was not completed, Enron woul=
d struggle to meet $9bn of obligations due before the end of next year.=20
People close to Enron insisted that Dynegy remained committed to the merger=
 and played down talk of renegotiation.=20
Dynegy would shortly issue a statement reasserting its commitment to the de=

USA: UPDATE 2-Enron bleeds again as Dynegy deal doubts grow.

By C. Bryson Hull
HOUSTON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - A long weekend of work faced Dynegy Inc. and pr=
oposed acquisition Enron Corp.,, whose worsening stock woes on Friday whipp=
ed up fear that the deal could be renegotiated or collapse entirely.=20
Houston-based Dynegy and its advisers were expected to spend the long holid=
ay weekend reviewing larger cross-town rival Enron's complex books, as both=
 parties race against the decline in Enron's stock to complete the thorough=
 financial examinations a merger requires.=20
Enron shares ended down more than 5 percent, or 27 cents, to $4.74 at the c=
lose of abbreviated Friday trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Dynegy s=
hares closed up 64 cents, or 1.61 percent, to $40.40.=20
Dynegy on Nov. 9 agreed to pay about $9 billion in stock for Enron. But, af=
ter falling 45 percent by Friday's close amid fears it could run out of cas=
h before the deal closes, Enron's market capitalization is only about $4.03=
 billion.=20
At Dynegy's current stock price, its offer for Enron is worth about $10.85 =
a share - more than twice Enron's current share price.=20
Executives and advisers from both companies are in the final stages of the =
review, known as due diligence, sources familiar with the matter told Reute=
rs. The sources said renegotiations had not been discussed as of Friday aft=
ernoon, and that such discussions could not occur until the due diligence r=
eview is finished.=20
But should it turn up any more unpleasant surprises that qualify as a "mate=
rial adverse change" in Enron's business, the likelihood increases of Dyneg=
y invoking escape clauses or renegotiating, analysts and observers say.=20
"You've got to believe there is that possibility. There is a 90 percent spr=
ead on the deal," said one analyst. "There's unquestionably continued malai=
se in Enron's core business and Dynegy has left itself open to renegotiate =
with Enron."=20
UBS Warburg analyst Ron Barone on Wednesday wrote in a research report that=
 the likelihood was "soaring" that Dynegy might discover a material adverse=
 change.=20
Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said that, to her knowledge, Dynegy was not r=
enegotiating the terms of the acquisition.=20
She repeated that Enron was working on obtaining an additional $500 million=
 to $1 billion in private equity funding to help shore up the balance sheet=
.=20
Dynegy spokesman John Sousa said due diligence was continuing and said the =
company remains optimistic about the merger.=20
TRADERS FEARING RENEGOTIATION=20
Enron's recent admission that lower volumes at its trading business - the c=
rown jewel of Enron that Dynegy most covets - could cause low fourth-quarte=
r earnings raises the possibility that the trading business is losing its p=
rofitability. Continued losses there would remove a key attraction for Dyne=
gy.=20
Electricity traders said the latest developments are making it seem more li=
kely that Dynegy will renegotiate the deal or back out entirely, a move the=
y said would leave Enron vulnerable to creditors and a possible bankruptcy.=
=20
This week rating agency Fitch Investors said that if Dynegy stepped away fr=
om the merger, Enron's credit situation seemed untenable and a bankruptcy f=
iling was highly possible.=20
Traders, speaking on condition on anonymity, said they expected Dynegy to s=
cramble over the weekend to narrow the growing share price gap. Enron's dep=
leted market value and the shrinking volume in its EnronOnline trading syst=
em makes it more likely Dynegy could pull out, traders said.=20
Meanwhile, energy traders reiterated that they would shy away from long-ter=
m deals with Enron unless they received substantial assurances the company'=
s credit rating would soon improve.=20
Enron's bonds on Friday were again talked at junk-bond levels, but even low=
er than before.=20
Enron's 6.4 percent notes maturing in 2006 and its 6.75 percent notes were =
bid Friday at 57 cents on the dollar, down from a respective 62 and 60 cent=
s on Wednesday, according to a trader. The notes yield to maturity a respec=
tive 21.5 percent and 17 percent. Its 20-year zero-coupon convertible bonds=
 fell about 1 cent on the dollar to just over 33 cents.=20
Enron is hovering at the edge of investment-grade as the three main credit =
trading agencies consider whether to cut them again, and some observers won=

USA: Enron avoids junk status, but observers wonder how.
By Jonathan Stempel

11/23/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Nov 23 (Reuters) - It is rare that holding onto investment-grade =
credit ratings means as much to a company as it does now to beleaguered ene=
rgy trader Enron Corp. , and some observers are wondering why a cut to junk=
 status is taking so long.=20
"The sum of all knowledge is in the valuation of the stock and the bonds," =
said Scott Smith, a principal at Wells Capital Management in San Francisco,=
 where he invests $6 billion in debt, and does not own Enron. "A bond tradi=
ng in the 50s has nothing to do with an investment-grade security."
Enron's 6.4 percent notes maturing in 2006 and 6.75 percent notes were bid =
Friday at 57 cents on the dollar, down from a respective 62 and 60 cents on=
 Wednesday, a trader said. The notes yield to maturity 21.5 percent and 17 =
percent.=20
Meanwhile, Enron's shares have sunk 94 percent this year. Since October 16,=
 when it released third-quarter results, which it has since revised downwar=
d, its shares have fallen 86 percent, and its bonds by nearly half.=20
Houston-based Enron, which is trying to merge with smaller cross-town rival=
 Dynegy Inc. , has been rocked this year by accounting problems, earnings r=
estatements, a federal investigation and a top management shuffle.=20
Its advisers were expected this weekend to pore over the company's books, w=
hich could lead to a renegotiation of the merger, sources familiar with the=
 matter said.=20
Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's have cut its senior unsecur=
ed debt ratings twice in the last month to their current "Baa3" and "BBB-mi=
nus," their lowest investment grades. Fitch has cut its equivalent rating t=
o "BBB-minus," and all three agencies have warned of more possible cuts.=20
The stakes could hardly be higher.=20
CASH CRUNCH=20
A downgrade to "junk" status could imperil Enron's trading business, force =
it to pay off as much as $3.9 billion of debt issued mostly by two trusts, =
and possibly force it to seek bankruptcy protection, analysts said.=20
Enron said in a securities filing it recently had less than $2 billion of a=
vailable cash and credit lines.=20
S&P said on Tuesday that Enron faces "liquidity issues," but enjoys an "ali=
gnment of interests" with its banks and a near-term financial position that=
 "is expected to be sufficient" to allow the Dynegy merger.=20
Fitch, meanwhile, said on Wednesday that "our present 'BBB-minus' rating re=
sts on the merger possibility and continued support of the lending banks."=
=20
If Dynegy walks away, it said, "Enron's credit situation seems untenable wi=
th a bankruptcy filing highly possible."=20
Enron said on Monday it had $9.15 billion of obligations due through next y=
ear, and a $690 million note that could come due next Tuesday. It later sai=
d it got a three-week reprieve.=20
INVESTMENT BANKS=20
Sean Egan, managing director of Egan-Jones Ratings Co. in Philadelphia, lik=
ened Enron's ratings situation to those of California's two largest utiliti=
es, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison .=20
Despite investor unease, those utilities kept their investment-grade rating=
s only until they defaulted on debt in January, as California's power crisi=
s worsened.=20
On November 8, a day before the Dynegy merger was announced, senior officia=
ls from Enron's lead banks - William Harrison, chief executive of J.P. Morg=
an Chase & Co. , and Michael Carpenter, who runs Citigroup Inc.'s investmen=
t banking arm - met with Moody's to help allay that agency's concerns, a pe=
rson familiar with the meeting said.=20
A day later, Moody's, which issued no statement on Enron this week, downgra=
ded the company's senior unsecured debt rating, but only to its current "Ba=
a3."=20
"Pressure is coming from the investment banks, which have a vested interest=
 in seeing the Dynegy deal go through," said Egan, whose agency rates Enron=
's debt "BB," its second-highest junk grade. "Investment banking fees will =
be substantial."=20
Companies pay for Moody's and S&P ratings, which they need to obtain financ=
ing. Egan said his agency receives no such payments.=20
Citigroup and J.P. Morgan declined to comment. Moody's and S&P did not imme=
diately return phone calls. Fitch was not immediately available for comment=
. Dynegy and Enron on Wednesday, however, reaffirmed their commitment to th=
e merger.=20
Wells Capital's Smith isn't sure what to expect.=20
"Enron will remain definitively investment grade if the merger as billed go=
es through, ... but there are half a dozen things that could go wrong," he =
said. "Obviously, the equity markets are telling you it's very skeptical th=
e merger will go through, and the bond market is following its lead."=20

USA: Enron shares seesaw on concerns over Dynegy deal.

11/23/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Shares of Enron Corp. fluctuated wildly on Fri=
day morning, as concerns grew over rival Dynegy Inc.'s $9 billion acquisiti=
on of the beleaguered energy trader.=20
Enron shares were down 8 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $4.93 in Friday morning =
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, after diving more than 8 percent ea=
rlier.
The shares are down because of talk that the terms of Dynegy's deal with En=
ron could be changed or that the deal could collapse.=20
Dynegy originally agreed to pay about $9 billion in stock for Enron. But, a=
fter falling 42 percent since then by Wednesday's close, Enron now sports a=
 market capitalization of only about $4.26 billion.=20
In a report on Wednesday, Ronald Barone, an analyst at UBS Warburg, suggest=
ed that the deal's current exchange ratio of 0.2685 share of Dynegy for eac=
h share of Enron could well be readjusted.=20
He suggested that a much lower exchange ratio of 0.15 was more realistic.=
=20
"You've got to believe there is that possibility. There is a 90 percent spr=
ead on the deal," said one analyst, referring to a potential renegotiation.=
=20
"There's unquestionably continued malaise in Enron's core business and Dyne=
gy has left itself open to renegotiate with Enron," he continued.=20
Some of Enron's trading partners have scaled back their activity, causing t=
hat "malaise." Lower volumes at its trading business, which is the largest =
and most coveted portion of its operation, could cause fourth-quarter earni=
ngs to come in below expectations, Enron has said.

TALES OF THE TAPE: Energy Traders' Perfect Storm Stalls
By Christina Cheddar
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/23/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Here's one 2001 outlook that couldn't have been more=
 wrong.=20
Around this time last year, pundits and fund managers were touting "the per=
fect storm" of market forces that were coming together to make the energy t=
rading business one to watch in 2001.
Then came the California power crisis, and allegations of price-gouging and=
 fears of credit defaults began to cloud the outlook for the group. That wa=
s followed by renewed volatility in power prices, and this time the prices =
were headed down, not up.=20
And then came a crushing blow against trading firms - the unraveling of the=
 industry's largest player, Enron Corp. (ENE).=20
Simply put, the perfect storm stalled, and a business once buoyed by high g=
as prices, strong demand and tight supply now lies in tatters.=20
The stocks of companies whom some say should be valued more like growth sto=
cks than utilities are instead mired at around nine-times earnings - about =
where traditional utilities trade.=20
And the chance for recovery in 2002?=20
Basu Mullick, portfolio manager of the Neuberger Berman Partners fund, is w=
illing to bet there is. He thinks energy traders deserve at least the same =
price-to-earnings multiple as the broader market's median, which is current=
ly between 16- to 17-times future earnings, he said. It's just a matter of =
time before the stocks get there.=20
"They were just recovering from Gray Davis," Mullick said, referring to the=
 governor of California, who had accused "out-of-state" energy traders of a=
rtificially inflating the price of power in the state, and triggering the s=
tate's energy crisis. "Now, they are recovering from Enron."=20
The fund manager also blames lower commodity prices, warm weather and poor =
demand for the recent weak performance in the group.=20
"Energy convergence companies are putting up terrific growth rates," he sai=
d. "I don't think they should get the same valuation as a garden-variety ut=
ility."=20
Still, others think the stock market is continuing to make distinctions bet=
ween the energy traders by taking a harder look at the companies' strategie=
s and financial disclosures.=20
Enron's precarious financial situation underscores the importance of accoun=
ting issues. Although many of Enron's financial problems aren't solely the =
fault of mark-to-market accounting issues, there has been growing attention=
 paid to this form of financial reporting because of the earnings volatilit=
y it can create.=20
Answers Elude Investors=20

Investors are asking hard questions, and not always getting the answers the=
y want.=20
Using mark-to-market methods, a company calculates the fair market value of=
 a commodity position - whether it's a contract, an option, a swap, etc. - =
at the time, even if the value of the position is realized over a longer pe=
riod. The problem with this method is the actual cash a company realizes fr=
om the position might not be the same value the company calculated in its o=
riginal assessment. Also, sometimes it isn't easy to calculate the fair val=
ue of the commodity position. This is particularly true in instances where =
the market for the commodity isn't liquid.=20
Over time, companies with the highest level of disclosure regarding their m=
ark-to-market gains will most likely trade at higher multiples to counterpa=
rts that provide little or no disclosure, said ABN AMRO Inc. analyst Paul P=
atterson.=20
Encouragingly, it appears companies may already be responding to the call f=
or added disclosure. According to a survey Patterson conducted, more compan=
ies with energy trading units were willing to disclose the details of their=
 mark-to-market accounting practices during third-quarter conference calls =
compared with those in the second quarter.=20
Patterson said he prefers earnings that are cash-based.=20
"All things being equal, we believe reported earnings that more closely ref=
lect the timely realization of cash have a higher quality associated with t=
hem than earnings that do not," he said.=20
He expects investors to become smarter and learn to distinguish between ear=
nings growth through accrual accounting and growth fueled by mark-to-market=
 accounting.=20
At the end of the day, it is not a matter of simply producing profits, but =
being able to say where those earnings came from, said one investor, who ma=
nages a pension fund.=20
Some investors also may be placing a greater emphasis on the cash flow the =
energy merchants produce.=20
Tim O'Brien, portfolio manager of the Gabelli Utilities Fund, said energy m=
erchants that own the physical power assets to back up their trading positi=
ons should trade at a premium to an independent power producers and traditi=
onal utility companies. Still, the stocks should be valued at less than the=
 growth rate of the company because of their heavy exposures to commodity p=
rices.=20
Energy merchants include companies such as Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Duke Energy C=
orp. (DUK) and Dominion Resources Inc. (D).=20
According to O'Brien, the group never deserved to have the price-to-earning=
s multiples above 20- to 30-times earnings, which were once paid for the st=
ocks.=20
"We all got sucked up by the up-leg of the cycle and forgot just how cyclic=
al these companies are," O'Brien said, adding that the average multiple sho=
uld be in the high single-digits to the high-teens.=20
As for independent power producers - which are companies without regulated =
operations that own power plants to generate electricity to sell and trade =
in the wholesale market - the group may wind up being valued on the basis o=
f the replacement costs of the assets in their portfolio, according to O'Br=
ien.=20
"One analogy is that they are basically like commercial real-estate plays,"=
 O'Brien said.=20
That could mean stocks such as Calpine Corp. (CPN), which is already in the=
 lower-half of its trading range, may have further to fall.=20

U.S. Energy Exhange May Scrap Online Platform Plans
By Stephen Parker
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/23/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The world's largest energy futures exchange is takin=
g a second look at plans to launch a major new electronic trading platform =
known as eNymex, and may decide to scrap them.=20
Management changes at the New York Mercantile Exchange, along with the succ=
ess of Access, an online platform the exchange expanded in September, have =
prompted the move.
Nymex may decide to combine parts of eNymex with Access, according to sourc=
es close to the matter. It is also exploring the idea of alliances with oth=
er exchanges, and considering developing "e-mini" contracts - smaller energ=
y contracts for Internet-based trade by retail investors.=20
"There's new management in place at the exchange," said Nymex spokeswoman N=
achamah Jacobovits. "They're rethinking all of our business strategies, and=
 one very massive strategy was the idea of this major eNymex B2B (business-=
to-business) system launch with a whole new slate of products."=20
Nymex and GlobalView Software Inc., a company that initially worked on buil=
ding the eNymex trading system, have sued each other in a dispute over work=
 on the project.=20
Kiodex, an electronic-trading technology firm that has developed the back e=
nd of the eNymex system, took on added development work for the project aft=
er GlobalView departed. The trade engine Kiodex was asked to build is "subs=
tantially complete, but the company can't speak to Nymex's overall electron=
ic-trading strategy," a Kiodex source said.=20
The eNymex platform was conceived as a forum for trading over-the-counter e=
nergy products, but Nymex has already moved ahead with plans for trading so=
me of them on Access, initially an overnight trading system that was expand=
ed in September. It hopes, for example, to launch gas swaps based on delive=
ry at the Henry Hub within the next six weeks on Access, Jacobovits said.=
=20
"We've expedited plans for a Henry Hub natural gas swap contract," Jacobovi=
ts said. "Traders could be looking for OTC clearing on a neutral-based plat=
form, which is a factor in that decision."=20
Before Sept. 14, Access was used only to trade energy futures at night, aft=
er the day's Nymex session had ended. Use was limited to Nymex members with=
 dedicated phone systems.=20
The exchange had been planning to expand use of Access, but ended up doing =
so sooner than it had expected. On Sept. 14, it started offering Access tra=
ding over the Internet, a move that will eventually allow Nymex to open up =
trade to more users.=20
The move was intended to help keep futures markets liquid after the Sept. 1=
1 attack on the World Trade Center. Nymex's building, located near where th=
e trade towers stood, was shut down for several days after the attacks. Exp=
anding its already existent Access system to the Internet helped ease poten=
tial liquidity problems that could have arisen from shortened floor trading=
 hours after Nymex reopened.=20
Development of the eNymex system began last year under the direction of for=
mer Nymex Chairman Daniel Rappaport. In August, Nymex said it would launch =
the eNymex platform within four to eight months. New Nymex President J. Rob=
ert "Bo" Collins Jr. said then that vendor problems had slowed development =
of the system's front-end technology and caused the delays. But he still ex=
pected eNymex to launch without any meaningful changes to its original prod=
uct line.=20
If Nymex combines parts or all of the platform originally intended as eNyme=
x with Access, the new system may end up being known as eNymex.=20
"eNymex right now is looking for a new mission," said an industry source cl=
ose to Nymex. "You know how politics works. We don't scrap it, we just rena=
me it. Anything we do electronically is now going to be called eNymex. But =
the original deal and concept that Rappaport initiated is done."=20
Nymex's reconsideration comes as the energy-trading world undergoes rapid c=
hange. The two most successful online energy trading platforms -- Enron Cor=
p.'s (ENE) EnronOnline, and IntercontinentalExchange, or ICE -- have seen t=
heir luck turn - in opposite directions.=20
Enron Corp. (ENE), which accounts for about 25% of the trade in U.S. power =
and gas markets, faces questions about its creditworthiness as the Securiti=
es and Exchange Commission investigates complicated financial dealings. Enr=
on's possible merger with Dynegy Inc. (DYN), now appears to be in doubt, an=
d energy trading companies are pulling back their exposure to the company.=
=20
Enron executes about 60% of its power and gas trades on EnronOnline. When E=
nron's troubles surfaced last month, Nymex quickly moved to extend its clea=
ring services to over-the-counter natural gas derivatives, a move the tradi=
ng community saw as an attempt to grab market share.=20
ICE, on the other hand, is moving ahead with plans to capture more energy t=
rade on its electronic format. ICE closed a deal this summer to acquire the=
 London-based International Petroleum Exchange - Nymex's chief competitor a=
nd Europe's largest traditional energy exchange. It plans to move all IPE e=
nergy contracts to its Internet-based system and offer clearing services fo=
r some over-the-counter contracts.=20
Nymex is exploring alliances that could give it a better footing in the new=
 competitive landscape. One idea under review is a joint venture with the C=
hicago Mercantile Exchange to offer e-mini contracts for Nymex products on =
CME's Globex electronic-trading system, the person close to Nymex said.=20
Nymex officials wouldn't confirm whether they're talking with the CME, but =
they said the relationship between the exchanges is a warm one.=20
"Nymex is always open to strategic alliances," Jacobovits said. "There's no=
thing we've agreed to at this point, but we have open dialogue with a numbe=
r of exchanges concerning strategic alliances. We have a good relationship =
with the Chicago Merc, and we certainly would be open to working with them.=
"=20
Shortly after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New York shut down the Nyme=
x trading floor, the CME said it would be willing to offer Nymex products o=
n its Globex system until Nymex resumed operations, Jacobovits said.=20

NEW YORK (AFX) - Enron Corp shares were lower, while Dynegy Inc was slightl=

At 11.15 am, Enron shares were trading down 17 cents at 4.84, a decline of =
3.3 pct. Dynegy was up 44 cents at 40.20.
The DJIA was up 57.70 points at 9,892.86. The S&P 500 was up 6.24 points at=

Dynegy representatives are planning to work through the weekend evaluating =
the significance of this information as part of their due diligence on Enro=

In the filing, Enron revealed a number of new financial problems including =
a possible obligation to repay a 690 mln usd note due Nov 27.=20
On Wednesday, the company said it had received an extension on the repaymen=

The company also said it was in active talks with its creditors and expecte=

Dynegy welcomed the news and said it will push ahead in seeking regulatory =
approval for the merger. But investors are concerned that the constant surp=
rises in restated earnings and revelations of liquidity problems at Enron m=
ay cause Dynegy to walk away from the deal.=20
UBS Warburg analyst Ronald Barone lowered Enron's fourth-quarter earnings p=
er share estimate to a loss of 25 cents from earnings of 25 cents, arguing =
that its business will suffer until its liquidity problems are resolved.=20
The analyst cut his full year estimate to 1.10 usd from 1.60 usd and 2002 e=

USA: Houston economy seen weathering major layoffs.
By Ellen Chang

11/23/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

HOUSTON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Houston's economy, buffered by a broad and dive=
rse tax base, should be able to weather thousands of layoffs from some of t=
he city's major corporations, including energy powerhouse Enron Corp., econ=
omists and analysts said.=20
Financially ailing Enron Corp. , which has 21,000 employees worldwide and i=
s in talks to be bought by Houston-based rival Dynegy Inc. , is the third m=
ajor employer in the city to announce severe financial problems in recent m=
onths. Analysts expect layoffs if the merger occurs.
Continental announced a layoff of 3,000 employees after the Sept. 11 attack=
s and Hewlett-Packard Co.'s plan to buy Compaq Computer Corp. will, if fina=
lized, result in 15,000 layoffs at the two companies. Compaq also announced=
 8,000 layoffs worldwide in July.=20
"It's fair to say that the potential layoffs at Enron and the layoffs at Co=
ntinental, taken alone, are negative factors, although probably small in th=
e grand scope of the Houston economy," said Phil Scheps, director of Housto=
n's finance and administration department.=20
Since last month when Enron became a target of a Securities and Exchange Co=
mmission investigation into financial dealings with partnerships, the energ=
y giant's market share has steadily eroded.=20
While neither Enron nor Dynegy have given any indication of the number of l=
ayoffs that could hit Houston, Barton Smith, director of the Institute for =
Regional Forecasting at the University of Houston, said the layoffs "will b=
e spread out over a long period of time and will not be excessive."=20
Robin Kapiloff, an analyst at Moody's Investors Service, said the city's ef=
forts to diversify its economy over the past decade will protect its revenu=
e collections, even as some of the city's biggest employers suffer. "We're =
watching to see where things go now," she said.=20
Alex Fraser, a director at Standard & Poor's, said the ratings agency isn't=
 concerned about Houston's credit position at this point. "While Enron is c=
ertainly a large player and prominent corporation, we're unclear on what th=
e impact would be."=20
While the fourth largest city in the country experienced a bit of a slowdow=
n since the Sept. 11 attacks, Houston has outperformed the rest of the nati=
on.=20
With a tax base of $87.3 billion in 2001, Houston is also buffered by the T=
exas Medical Center, the city's largest employer. Next year the city's tax =
base is estimated to grow to $95 billion.=20
Still, the national recession, energy price weakness in general, and the in=
itial loss of consumer confidence related to the attacks has caused the cit=
y to reduce its estimate of sales tax growth to 1.5 percent from 5 percent.=
 That revised estimate equals a $13 million reduction in the city's $1.4 bi=
llion budget.=20
But the city's property tax revenue has not been affected. Only a small cha=
nge in property tax collections is expected in 2002 because valuations are =
based on Jan. 1 data and for most of 2001, real estate growth was very larg=
e, Scheps said.=20
While recent economic indicators appear positive, and consumer confidence h=
as quickly rebounded, a better read on the strength of Houston's tax revenu=
e collections will be available in February when the city receives data for=
 the December holiday season, Scheps said.

Dynegy's Decision to Buy Enron Hits Crossroads Amid Rising Financial Woes

11/23/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Even as it reiterated its intention to purchase Enron Corp., Dynegy Inc. is=
 coming under increasing pressure to renegotiate or walk away from the mult=
ibillion-dollar deal, Friday's Wall Street Journal reported.=20
The pressure is stemming from the continuing slide in the price of Enron (E=
NE) shares and the mounting financial problems at the Houston energy-tradin=
g company, the nation's biggest marketer of electricity and natural gas. Du=
ring the past month, Enron has taken a $1 billion write-off of assets, revi=
sed downward the earnings of the past several years and taken a $1.2 billio=
n reduction in shareholder equity.
The problems have been due largely to dealings Enron had with private partn=
erships, run by some of its own executives, under investigation by the Secu=
rities and Exchange Commission. In an SEC filing Monday, Enron disclosed hu=
ndreds of millions of potential additional write-offs as well as the possib=
ility that its weakening financial condition could force it to repay more t=
han $2 billion in loans by the end of the year.=20
As of 4 p.m. Wednesday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron =
shares fell $1.98, or 28%, to $5.01 each after having dropped 23% Tuesday. =
In excess of 115 million shares traded Wednesday, more than four times the =
volume of any other Big Board stock. Enron's bonds also again traded sharpl=
y lower, market observers said.=20
The turmoil spilled over to Dynegy's stock, which also was among the most a=
ctively traded on the New York Stock Exchange. As of 4 p.m. Wednesday, Dyne=
gy (DYN) shares fell $1.94 to $39.76 each.=20
On Wednesday, Dynegy issued a statement in which Chairman and Chief Executi=
ve Chuck Watson said his company was working "to accelerate the regulatory =
approvals required to complete the merger in accordance with the previously=
 announced agreement" though it continued to perform "due diligence" on Enr=
on.=20
Under the merger agreement, Dynegy has opportunities to renegotiate or walk=
 away from the deal if Enron's financial and legal problems become severe e=
nough. However, some observers said it can be difficult to invoke these so-=
called material adverse change clauses. They point to a decision earlier th=
is year by a Delaware Chancery Court judge who forced Tyson Foods Inc. to c=
omplete a planned purchase of IBP Inc. even though Tyson, a Springdale, Ark=
., food-products company, had wanted to cancel the transaction because of a=
 drop in IBP's earnings and accounting problems at an IBP unit.=20
Dynegy officials didn't return calls seeking comment. To complete the deal,=
 two-thirds of Dynegy shareholders and a majority of Enron shareholders wou=
ld have to give their approval. No dates for those votes have been set.=20
One person familiar with the merger plans said the SEC filing Monday by Enr=
on contained information Dynegy hadn't known about. Dynegy representatives =
planned to work through the weekend evaluating the importance of this new i=
nformation as part of the company's due diligence, this person said. It cou=
ldn't be determined what the new information was.=20
The merger agreement, announced Nov. 9, calls for Dynegy to exchange 0.2685=
 share for each of Enron's roughly 850 million fully diluted shares, giving=
 the purchase a value of about $9 billion at Dynegy's current stock price. =
However, from a price standpoint, the deal is appearing less attractive to =
Dynegy.=20
On the day of the merger announcement, Enron shares were trading at about $=
8.63 each, or about 83% of the purchase price under the exchange ratio. As =
of Wednesday, Enron's market price was only about 47% of the merger-formula=
 price. Such a sharp deterioration is unusual following a merger announceme=
nt, when the stock price of the company being acquired generally begins tra=
ding relatively close to the offering price.=20
Sentiment among Wall Street analysts also is turning against the merger. In=
itially, many analysts lauded the merger as a move that would rescue Enron =
and provide a major boost to Houston-based Dynegy. Dynegy and Enron officia=
ls have predicted that the merger, supposed to be completed late next year,=
 would significantly and immediately increase Dynegy's earnings.=20
Now analysts are challenging that assumption. Ron Barone, managing director=
 at UBS Warburg LLC, said he believes that because of Enron's financial pro=
blems, a combined company would actually have lower earnings next year than=

 is that the merger formula will be renegotiated sharply down to about 0.15=
 Dynegy share for each Enron share.=20

HOUSTON -- Two Enron Corp. workers are suing the company, claiming it endan=
gered their retirement funds.=20
The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Houston under the Employee Retiremen=
t Income Security Act, asserts that Enron encouraged the employees to inves=
t more heavily in company stock just before the stock tanked. The lawsuit w=
as filed by Portland, Ore., utility lineman Roy Rinard and co-worker Steve =
Lacey.
Enron shares have plunged more than 90% over the last several months since =
the departure of the company's chief executive and an accounting controvers=
y that prompted the firm to restate its earnings since 1997, eliminating mo=
re than $580 million of reported income.=20
Steve Berman, managing partner for the law firm of Hagens Berman in Seattle=
, said Enron touted the value of its shares and encouraged employees to put=
 their entire portfolio into Enron stock.=20
Enron officials didn't emphasize the risk and instead painted the situation=
 as positive, especially when the company's stock began to slide, said Berm=
an, who is hoping to get the suit certified as a class action.=20
Berman wants to prove that the company's 401(k) plan executives failed to a=
ct responsibly when they knew about serious business problems. He's also ho=
ping to break new legal ground with his case.=20
The lawsuit is patterned after a case against Lucent Technologies in which =
Lucent employees sued their employer this summer for matching their 401(k) =
contributions with company stock that tanked. That case is still in litigat=
ion.=20
Earlier this year, Rinard, 54, had $472,000 in his Enron 401(k) plan, which=
 had been growing for 21 years.=20
Today, his plan is worth about $40,000. Enron gives its employees their 401=
(k) match in company stock.=20
In January, Enron was trading for $84.87. Wednesday it closed at $5.01 a sh=
are on the New York Stock Exchange.=20
The problem was compounded when many employees, including Rinard, saw Enron=
's stock doing so well that they decided to put their entire account into E=
nron stock.=20
Enron executives had talked about how the stock price was poised to climb a=
bove $100 a share, Rinard told the Houston Chronicle.=20
In addition, Enron employees were not allowed to make trades in the 401(k) =
plan for about a month, starting Oct. 17. That was the day after Enron surp=
rised the market with the news it was taking a $1.01-billion after-tax thir=
d-quarter charge to get out of bad investments.=20
Enron officials, who could not be reached, have said they had planned the l=
ockdown for several months because the company was changing plan administra=
tors.

Portland utility's fate tied to Enron's future

LOS ANGELES -- Oregon's largest utility, Portland General Electric, faces a=
n uncertain future as its parent Enron fights for its life amid a deepening=
 financial crisis, industry experts said Wednesday.=20
Another Oregon utility, Northwest Natural Gas, is due to file next week wit=
h state regulators for approval to take over Portland General. Those same r=
egulators could soon be faced with a similar application from Dynegy as par=
t of a still-pending deal to acquire cash-strapped Enron.
If Enron were to file for bankruptcy before Portland General has been sold,=
 its future could be thrown into the hands of a Texas bankruptcy court, exp=
erts said.=20
Northwest Natural Gas agreed Oct. 8 to acquire Portland General for around =
$1.8 billion, plus about $1.1 billion in assumed debt and preferred stock. =
A month later, Enron announced it had agreed to be acquired by Houston-base=
d Dynegy.=20
"We've been watching this from afar to see how it could impact that sale (P=
ortland General's acquisition by Northwest Natural Gas)," said Roy Hemmingw=
ay, chairman of the Oregon Public Utility Commission.=20
"We have authority if that sale doesn't go through to rule on whether Dyneg=
y can take over Enron," he said.=20
Ratings agency Fitch last week cut Portland General's debt ratings due to "=
uncertainty at its parent Enron." Wednesday, the same agency said a bankrup=
tcy filing by Enron was "highly possible" if the proposed rescue by Dynegy =
collapses.=20
"We haven't seen any credit problems so far, and Portland General isn't in =
the market (buying power for its customers) right now in a big way," Hemmin=
gway said.=20
However, he noted that, "If they really were unable to conduct their busine=
ss because they were not creditworthy we would have to use whatever instrum=
ents are available" to make sure service to customers is maintained. Earlie=
r this year, California was forced to take over buying power for the PG&E u=
nit of Pacific Gas & Electric and Edison International subsidiary Southern =
California Edison after the two utilities saw their credit ratings cut to j=
unk status.=20
Federal regulators have insisted the sellers of wholesale power have the ri=
ght to sell to a creditworthy buyer.=20
California's largest utility, Pacific Gas & Electric, chose to file for ban=
kruptcy because of its mounting debt. In a parallel, consumer advocates fea=
r the fate of the biggest utility in neighboring Oregon could end up in the=
 hands of a bankruptcy judge.=20
Hemmingway said the Oregon Public Utility Commission recently had granted P=
ortland General a rate increase and the utility has "plenty of cash flow cu=
rrently to handle its obligations."=20
"This is nothing like California where that was not the case," he said.=20
Northwest Natural Gas, which is also based in Portland, has set a target of=
 filing next Wednesday with the Oregon commission to take over the utility,=
 spokesman Steve Sechrist said.=20
"We have no concerns whatsoever at this point. The deal is moving forward a=
nd there is no reason we can see why it should not" he said, noting the del=
ay to the filing was the result of the complexities of the acquisition.=20
Jason Eisdorfer, a lawyer for the Citizens' Utility Board of Oregon, said m=
ajor questions would be raised if Enron went under before the deal were com=
pleted.=20
"Would the (bankruptcy) judge let the terms of the agreement go forward. I =

Enron Shares and Bonds Fall on Concern About Takeover (Update5)
2001-11-23 15:55 (New York)

Enron Shares and Bonds Fall on Concern About Takeover (Update5)

     (Updates with Dynegy comment in fifth paragraph.)

     Houston, Nov. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. shares and bonds
fell for a third day on concern the company's weakened financial
condition and plunging stock price may lead Dynegy Inc. to try to
cancel or rework a takeover of the biggest energy trader.

     Shares of Enron, the most-active U.S. stock, dropped
30 cents, or 6 percent, to $4.71. They fell 45 percent Tuesday and
Wednesday after Enron said it may have to pay more than $9 billion
in debt due by 2003. Enron 6.4 percent bonds due in July 2006 were
bid at 55 cents on the dollar, down from 62 cents on Wednesday,
traders said.

     Enron shares are trading at less than half the value of
Dynegy's offer, which shows investors are questioning whether the
buyout will be completed on the terms agreed to two weeks ago.
Enron's financial woes may prove to be a drag on Dynegy's earnings
next year if the transaction is completed, analysts said.

     ``There are continued doubts about the deal,'' said UBS
Warburg analyst Ronald Barone, who rates Dynegy a ``strong buy''
and doesn't own shares in either company. ``Enron's earnings
aren't what they used to be because they've lost trading business.
Given that, Dynegy has an opportunity to renegotiate the price.''

     Dynegy spokesman John Sousa said the company ``remains
optimistic for the potential of the merger.'' Enron agreed Nov. 9
to the takeover, now valued at about $23 billion in stock and
assumed debt, after a financial crisis threatened it with
bankruptcy.

     On Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve from lenders on
a $690 million note due next week, giving the company more time to
restructure its finances. Dynegy Chief Executive Officer Chuck
Watson said he was ``encouraged'' by the commitment to extend the
note payment, as well as the closing of a $450 million credit
facility, and that Dynegy remained committed to the purchase.

     More than 40 million Enron shares changed hands today, almost
twice their three-month daily average, in a session shortened
because of the Thanksgiving holiday. Enron was the most-active
U.S. stock on Wednesday, with 116 million shares traded. Dynegy
shares rose 64 cents to $40.40 today.

                       Less Than $2 Billion

     In a Securities & Exchange Commission filing Monday, Enron
said it has less than $2 billion in cash and credit lines left. If
the company's cash reserves run too low, Enron is in danger of
seeing its credit rating cut below investment grade. That would
trigger $3.9 billion in debt repayments for two affiliated
partnerships.

     Enron's bankers have met with unidentified investors,
including leveraged buyout firms and two industrial companies, in
a bid to shore up the energy trader's finances with an injection
of as much as $2 billion, the New York Times reported yesterday,
citing unidentified executives close to the companies.

     Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said the company is seeking
$500 million to $1 billion. Enron needs to raise $1 billion to
$1.5 billion in cash within the next 45 days, said Sean Egan,
managing director of Egan-Jones Rating Co.

     ``Their trading operation has burned through cash faster than
the market had expected,'' Egan said.

                         Trading Business

     Traders including Mirant Corp. and Aquila Inc. have said they
shifted transactions away from Enron after its plunging stock
price prompted concerns about creditworthiness. Enron has said
fourth-quarter earnings would be reduced partly by a drop in its
energy-trading business.

     Watson said after the Enron buyout was announced he expected
it to increase 2002 earnings by 35 percent. Analysts said that
can't happen unless Enron recovers lost trading business. Several
have cut their 2002 estimates for Enron. The average estimate of
analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call for next year is
now $1.68 a share, down from $2.14 a month ago.

     Dynegy can cancel or renegotiate if Enron can't meet debt
payments, its trading market collapses, banks demand more
collateral or raise the interest rate for loans, Enron's credit
rating is cut to junk, the SEC cites Enron for securities fraud,
or if Enron's legal liabilities including shareholder suits exceed
$3.5 billion, Egan said.


                     Will Dynegy Renegotiate?

     Dynegy officials were considering whether to try and
renegotiate terms of its agreement with Enron, according to the
New York Times report. Dynegy and Enron are both based in Houston.

     ``Dynegy investors would like to see the company negotiate a
lower price for Enron,'' said Credit Lyonnais securities analyst
Gordon Howald, who rates Dynegy ``buy'' and owns no shares.

     Under the Nov. 9 terms, Enron investors would receive 0.2685
Dynegy share for each share held. At today's closing price, that
values Enron stock at $10.85. A year ago, Enron traded at almost
$80.

     Investors worry that a cancellation of the merger would push
Enron into bankruptcy.

     ``The market is saying there seems to be no obvious Plan B
for Enron and that is what has investors concerned,'' said Eric
Bergson, who helps manage $9 billion of fixed-income assets at
Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. ``The lower bond prices go, what
the market is saying is that there's less chance of this deal
going through.''

KKR, Blackstone Are Among Likely Enron Investors, Analyst Says
2001-11-23 16:20 (New York)

KKR, Blackstone Are Among Likely Enron Investors, Analyst Says

     Houston, Nov. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts &
Co., the Blackstone Group and the Carlyle Group are among the
likely candidates to be approached by Enron Corp. for a private
equity investment to shore up the company's balance sheet, said
industry analyst David Snow of PrivateEquityCentral.Net.

     The firms have cash on hand and have invested in energy
companies in the past. An investment in Enron may look attractive
now that its shares have plunged by 94 percent this year.

     ``Many of the larger, more traditional buyout firms would
find this deal attractive,'' said Snow. ``This is a company that
has real assets that is down in the dumps and has need of capital
when capital is scarce.''

     Enron's bankers met recently with leveraged buyout firms and
two industrial companies to seek an investment, the New York Times
reported, citing executives close to the companies. Enron's stock
fell for a fifth day in six on concern the company's weakened
financial condition may lead Dynegy Inc. to try to cancel or
rework its planned purchase of the rival Houston company.

     Investors may inject as much as $2 billion under arrangements
that would protect them from further declines in Enron's stock,
the Times said. The new investments would be in Enron's
Transwestern Pipeline, which connects natural-gas fields in Texas
to the California market, the newspaper said.

     J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. agreed to terms
that give each of them a $250 million equity stake as part of a
transaction to be completed Monday, officials told the newspaper.

     Buyout firms sometimes make collective bids, pooling their
money and distributing the risk. The firms also like to invest in
industries that are out of favor with public investors and to do
so in partnership with corporate investors, like Dynegy, said
Snow.

     ``You need to know enough about the (energy) business to know
whether it's a good deal, and then you need to be confident in the
Dynegy team,'' he said.

                                KKR

     KKR, the second-biggest private equity firm with $24 billion
in assets, declined comment on Enron through spokeswoman Molly
Morse of Kekst & Co.

     The New York-based firm invested more than $1.3 billion in
DPL Inc., a utility in Dayton, Ohio, and will receive $550 million
of that back from the company after DPL sold $700 million of bonds
in August.

     ``KKR very much gets involved in deals where there's a
corporate partner and they don't have a majority stake,'' Snow
said. ``They would possibly hold it for years, because they like
slow exits.'' KKR is also a possible candidate because it recently
raised a new $5 billion buyout fund.

     Any LBO firm would need assurance about how it will get its
money back on an Enron investment, said Snow.

     ``The thing they have to be cautious about is the exit,'' he
said. ``If there's a chance Dynegy would agree to buy out (the LBO
firms') stake over time, that would give some confidence. But if
the only exit is the public market, that's a little bit dicier.''

     Any private investment also must be large enough to make a
meaningful difference: Enron's market value is $3.7 billion and
Dynegy has proposed paying $23 billion in stock and assumption of
debt. That means the private equity portion would have to approach
$1 billion or more.

     The 20 largest private equity firms have assets of more than
$5 billion under management each, according to Asset Alternatives,
a Wellesley, Massachusetts industry research firm. Still, many of
those firms don't have enough free capital to undertake an
investment of $500 million or more.

     An announcement of an investment may come soon, analysts say.
Energy trading firms such as Mirant Corp. and Aquila Inc. are
doing fewer trades with Enron because of concern that the company
won't be able to finance its business. Enron shares have fallen by
almost half in the past three sessions.

     ``They're going to need this investment within 30 to 45
days,'' said Sean Egan of Egan-Jones Ratings Co. ``They're
spiraling downward and they're going to need some more beyond the
$1.5 billion contributed by'' ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns 26
percent of Dynegy.

                            Other LBOs

     Here's a rundown of the other most likely private equity
partners for Enron:

     --The Carlyle Group could invest through a $1 billion energy
fund it's raising, as well as its general U.S. buyout fund, said
Snow. Carlyle's vice president for corporate communications, Chris
Ullman, declined to comment.

     --Blackstone, which has a history of investing alongside
other corporate partners, recently closed on a $4 billion buyout
fund. Blackstone spokesman John Ford declined to comment on
whether Enron had approached the firm.

     --Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst, which is based in Texas like
Dynegy and Enron. Hicks Muse counts Triton Energy Ltd., an energy
exploration company, among its best investments. The firm recently
raised about $1.5 billion for new investments, about one-third of
what it had hoped to raise, and has said it will focus on ``back-
to-basics'' investments in food, manufacturing and media. Mark
Semer, a spokesman for Hicks Muse who also works for Kekst,
declined comment on Enron.

     Spokesmen for two other firms, Warburg Pincus & Co. and
Credit Suisse First Boston's private equity arm, didn't return
calls seeking comment.

Microsoft MSN Fast Web Access Expansion Slowed by Enron Suit
2001-11-23 11:59 (New York)

Microsoft MSN Fast Web Access Expansion Slowed by Enron Suit

     Redmond, Washington Nov. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp.'s
plans to expand its MSN high-speed Internet service have been
delayed by a lawsuit from Enron Corp., which could cost the
company customers during the holiday season, analysts said.

     MSN had planned to have fast Internet access over telephone
lines available, with help from energy trader Enron, in 45 markets
starting Oct. 25. Instead, the service is now on sale in about 30
markets, said MSN Product Manager Lisa Gurry.

     The latest delay follows a string of apparent bad luck that
has delayed the rollout of Microsoft's fast Internet access
service over the last year. The holidays are typically a popular
time for customers to buy so-called broadband access, often along
with new personal computers purchased or received as gifts.

     ``They have a track record of picking broadband partners that
don't quite work out,'' said Joe Laszlo, senior analyst at market
researcher Jupiter Media Metrix Inc. ``It definitely hurts them
with customers who want broadband right now.''

     Subscribers to fast Internet access services are expected to
grow fourfold by 2006, according to estimates by Jupiter Media
Metrix, while sales of slower Internet access plans decline. Fast
Internet service over phone lines uses digital subscriber line, or
DSL, technology.

                         On Track

     Gurry said Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft is still on
track to have fast access for sale by the end of March to 90
percent of the 45 million to 50 million households that have DSL
available in their neighborhoods.

     ``There is very little growth left in the dial-up access
space for Microsoft or anybody, which leaves them with broadband
as the only potential growth area for the MSN access business,''
said Youssef Squali, an analyst at FAC/Equities, who rates
Microsoft Internet competitor AOL Time Warner Inc. a ``buy.''

     Microsoft also wants to deliver consumer services like music
and video and software updates, which require fast Internet access
for smooth downloads.

     The company originally began a service with NorthPoint
Communications Group Inc., a now-bankrupt provider of fast Web
access. Microsoft has also had difficulty finding partners among
cable companies who use their networks for high-speed service.

     Now Houston-based Enron, which agreed in June to provide the
backbone for a nationwide expansion of MSN's service, is suing.
Enron claimed in its lawsuit that it isn't required to deliver
broadband services if Microsoft hasn't first provided a billing
and ordering system that the biggest software company agreed to
build.

     Enron, which is being acquired by rival Dynegy Inc., recently
disclosed debts of $9.15 billion due by 2003 and restated earnings
for four years.

                        Slower Expansion

     MSN has been selling high-speed access in 14 states under
partnership with Qwest Communications International Inc. for the
last few months. MSN has begun the planned service expansion
outside of those states by working with Enron competitors that MSN
Marketing Director Bob Visse declined to name. The company is also
talking to Enron, he said. Enron didn't return calls for comment.

     Because of the Enron suit the expansion is moving slower than
expected, Visse said. Since Oct. 25, MSN has added service in Los
Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego and Sacramento, California, and
Houston, Dallas, San Antonio and Austin, Texas, giving Microsoft a
total of about 30 markets rather than 45. Plans to expand
marketing are also on hold, Visse said.

     ``It is very unfortunate that we are in the position we are
in,'' said Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer.

     Top U.S. Internet service provider America Online, owned by
AOL Time Warner Inc., has also been slow to get into the high-
speed market, analysts said.

     That doesn't mean Microsoft is in the clear. Laszlo said both
MSN and AOL might pay for their sluggishness with tougher
competition from third-place EarthLink Inc. and from cable and
telephone companies that have more experience selling high-speed
Internet access.

     America Online has more than 31 million subscribers to MSN's
7 million. EarthLink Inc. has 4.77 million subscribers. Laszlo
doesn't think MSN or America Online can build the kind of lead in
the high-speed market that America Online has in the slower dial-
up access market.

                       `Not a Permanent Blow'

     Not that anyone need worry about Microsoft. MSN will be able
to expand its fast Internet access business even with the delays,
Laszlo said.

     ``They are already late in the broadband market so this means
they get a little later,'' he said. ``But broadband will continue
to grow over the next few years and this is definitely not a
permanent blow.''

     Analysts also say Microsoft still needs to find a cable
partner that will let MSN use its network to sell fast access over
cable lines. Cable is more popular than DSL with customers looking
for fast Web service. The five largest cable providers control 51
percent of the U.S. high-speed Internet market. The five largest
sellers of access via phone lines and DSL technology account for
about 33 percent, according to market researcher ARS Inc.

     Microsoft MSN Vice President Yusuf Mehdi said last month the
company may be interested in an investment in AT&T Corp.'s cable-
television unit, which AT&T is considering selling. Ballmer
declined to comment on Microsoft's plans.

Documents Track Enron's Partnerships --- Top Officers Viewed Deals As Integ=

As some current and former Enron Corp. officials try to distance themselves=
 from controversial partnerships that played a role in the company's demise=
, internal Enron documents show top management and directors viewed the par=
tnerships as integral to maintaining the energy-trading giant's rapid growt=
h in recent years.=20
The documents also reinforce the notion that top Enron officials, including=
 Chairman Kenneth Lay and former President Jeffrey Skilling, were directly =
involved in the creation and oversight of the partnerships, which were run =
by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. Questions about the partne=
rships in recent months contributed to a collapse in investor confidence in=
 the Houston-based company, which just a year ago had a market capitalizati=
on of over $60 billion. Enron filed last month for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-co=
urt protection, which shields the company from creditors while it seeks to =
reorganize.
An Enron spokeswoman said the company didn't have any comment on the docume=
nts. Among these are an internal memorandum from an Enron attorney to Mr. S=
killing regarding procedures for monitoring transactions with the partnersh=
ips. The documents also include excerpts of minutes from meetings of Enron'=
s board and the board's finance committee.=20
Enron and Mr. Lay have consistently said that the company's dealings with t=
he partnerships, which involved joint investments as well as asset sales, w=
ere aimed at helping the company, were carefully reviewed to prevent confli=
cts of interest and were adequately disclosed. The partnership dealings are=
 the subject of a Securities and Exchange Commission probe and are being lo=
oked into by Congress.=20
The Enron documents indicate that in mid-1999 the company began using the p=
artnerships to confront changing business conditions.=20
A document excerpting a June 1999 board meeting cited Mr. Skilling as sayin=
g that because of changing accounting rules affecting off-balance-sheet tra=
nsactions, Enron had been analyzing new types of financing vehicles. Though=
 the document doesn't provide further explanation, the statement would appe=
ar to be a reference to a concern at Enron about trying to keep as much deb=
t as possible off the company's balance sheet. Too much debt lowers a compa=
ny's credit rating, which was a particular worry for Enron, whose vast ener=
gy-trading operations relied heavily on its credit standing.=20
In the June 1999 document, Messrs. Lay and Skilling were identified as bein=
g designated by Enron's board to help ensure that the company received fair=
 consideration in one of the early partnership deals.=20
A draft version of minutes from an October 2000 meeting of the Enron board =
finance committee cites Mr. Fastow speaking of the need for outside private=
 partnerships to help manage the company's finances so that Enron could "co=
ntinue to grow." Enron planned to continue making "significant capital inve=
stments. . . . some of which would not generate cash flow or earnings for a=
 number of years," the document said.=20
Out of such needs were born in 1999 the so-called LJM partnerships, which w=
ere run by Mr. Fastow. The Enron documents show that an early transaction i=
nvolved the hedging of the value of an Enron investment in Rhythms NetConne=
ctions Inc., a data-communications company. According to one document, Mr. =
Fastow discussed how Enron could protect the value of that holding through =
a complicated swap arrangement that also involved Enron stock and a $50 mil=
lion LJM payment.=20
In a filing last November with the SEC, Enron said that it had incorrectly =
accounted for the Rhythms/LJM transaction. As a result, Enron retroactively=
 reduced its reported net income for 1999 and 2000 by about $100 million, o=
r around 5%.=20
The internal documents show that the board and top management were aware of=
 the possible conflicts of interests in having Enron's chief financial offi=
cer running partnerships that eventually did hundreds of millions of dollar=
s of business with the company. One document, labeled as part of a June 199=
9 presentation to Enron's board, also laid out the huge profit potential in=
 Mr. Fastow's partnership compensation formula, under which he stood to rea=
p as much as half of partnership profits in addition to management fees. En=
ron has estimated that Mr. Fastow made over $30 million from his partnershi=
p activities.=20
To avoid potential conflicts of interests on Mr. Fastow's part, Enron set u=
p a review procedure for any Enron deals with the partnerships. Among other=
 things, all transactions had to be approved by Mr. Skilling and two other =
senior Enron officials, according to one of the company documents.=20
In interviews with several media organizations last month, Mr. Skilling, wh=
o resigned as Enron's president and chief executive officer in August, indi=
cated that he wasn't fully aware of all the LJM-related dealings and was al=
so surprised by the size of Mr. Fastow's partnership remuneration. Yesterda=
y, a spokeswoman for Mr. Skilling said that while he was familiar with the =
structure of the LJM partnerships, "he wasn't aware of or intimately involv=
ed with details" of particular transactions. Those matters were "handled at=
 a lower level" of the company, she added.=20
Mr. Fastow couldn't be reached for comment. But a Fastow attorney has previ=
ously pointed to Enron statements that all the LJM transactions were proper=
 and approved by the board and top management.

Humbled Enron tries to save core business --- Accounting practices thrust i=
nto spotlight
Kristen Hays, Associated Press
01/02/2002

A humbled Enron Corp. will enter 2002 with hopes of emerging from bankruptc=
y with a viable trading business, once the source of 90 per cent of its rev=
enues.=20
The once-mighty energy titan came crashing down with dizzying speed in 2001=
 after investors lost confidence in the accounting behind its core operatio=
ns.
The company is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n, the House or Representatives energy and commerce committee and the justi=
ce department.=20
On Jan. 10, an auction will be held of 51 per cent of Enron's wholesale ene=
rgy trading operation. Some Wall Street insiders say bids could be as high =
as $1 billion (U.S.) for the joint venture Enron has been trying to put tog=
ether, enabling it to revive its oil, natural gas and electricity trading b=
usiness.=20
Enron was born in 1985 when Houston Natural Gas merged with InterNorth, a n=
atural gas company based in Omaha, Neb. In 1989, Enron started trading natu=
ral gas commodities and eventually became the world's largest buyer and sel=
ler of natural gas.=20
Later it gained fame by pioneering trading markets in such commodities as w=
eather derivatives, telecommunications transmission capacity, pulp, paper a=
nd plastics. But some of these units and overseas investments consistently =
lost money.=20
The company buried those losses in its profitable trading business and turn=
ed to off-balance-sheet financing vehicles to keep burgeoning debt off its =
books.=20
But eventually, the debt and bad investments couldn't be hidden.=20
On Oct. 16, Enron acknowledged $618 million (U.S.) in third-quarter losses,=
 took a $1 billion charge for losses on bad investments and cut $1.2 billio=
n in shareholders' equity.=20
Enron filed for bankruptcy in New York Dec. 2 to keep creditors and lawsuit=
s at bay so the company could try to preserve its trading operation. Money-=
losing assets went up for sale.=20
Credit rating agencies have promised closer scrutiny of off-balance-sheet f=
inancing.=20
"Enron is an animal all its own," said Credit Lyonnais analyst Gordon Howal=
d. "A lot of companies have not handled their finances as aggressively as E=
nron has. But one of the fallouts of Enron is that companies are going to h=
ave to disclose a lot more than they have in the past."

How Enron concealed losses, inflated earnings--and hid secret deals from th=
e authorities. Are criminal charges next?=20
Enron Corp.'s spectacular collapse may have shocked employees and investors=
, who lost tens of billions of dollars. Could it have been a surprise to it=
s top executives or its auditors, Arthur Andersen? The complex side bets an=
d partnerships Enron used left it extremely vulnerable to a drop in its sto=
ck price, its bond rating or the value of fiber-optic lines. The plunge of =
all three doomed the company.
This much is apparent from some internal company documents leaked to FORBES=
: As early as March 2001 the elaborate network of external partnerships Enr=
on used to hedge against declining values of its assets was starting to mel=
t down. Even as former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling and Chairman Kennet=
h Lay were selling millions of dollars' worth of shares last spring, an arm=
y of lawyers and accountants was shuttling money among partnerships to fore=
stall disaster. They couldn't. Finally, in November, Lay admitted Enron had=
 taken $710 million in losses to unwind the partnerships.=20
Enron refuses to discuss the workings of these partnerships, beyond the sca=
nty disclosures in the recent 10-Q filed with the Securities & Exchange Com=
mission. But documents laying out how some of the partnerships worked show =
an ingenious structure designed by Enron's former chief financial officer, =
Andrew Fastow. The idea was to use the value of Enron's rising stock price =
to finance a welter of corporations that magically turned balance-sheet los=
ses into gains on Enron's income statement. One round of partnerships forme=
d last year hedged nearly $2 billion in Enron assets.=20
The partnerships were originally designed to comply with regulation 140 of =
the Financial Accounting Standards Board. The rule lets companies move fina=
ncial assets off their balance sheets if they are put into entities that ar=
e completely out of the control of the parent company. But Enron skirted th=
e law by having the partnerships issue put options--obligations to buy some=
thing in the future at a specified price--on assets that were still on Enro=
n's books.=20
"It's like somebody sat down with the rules and said, 'How can we get aroun=
d them?'" says Douglas Carmichael, an accounting professor at Baruch Colleg=
e in Manhattan. "They structured these things to comply with the letter of =
the law but totally violated the spirit."=20
Only Enron knows how many such partnerships exist. Carol Coale, an analyst =
with Prudential Securities in Houston, has identified over 3,000 subsidiari=
es and partnerships, many of them off-balance-sheet entities. Several were =
designed to "monetize" assets--sell them to a party unlikely to question th=
e value Enron put on them. Some deals require a complete suspension of disb=
elief.=20
In June 2000, for example, Enron sold $100 million worth of "dark fiber," o=
r fiber-optic cables without the electronic gear necessary to transmit digi=
tized information. The "buyer" was a partnership run by Fastow called LJM2 =
(the acronym reportedly comes from the initials of his wife and children), =
set up in 1999 to trade assets with Enron. On that deal, Enron booked a $67=
 million profit, a significant piece of the $318 million gross profit the c=
ompany reported for the broadband business in 2000. LJM2 later sold $40 mil=
lion of the dark fiber to what Enron refers to as "industry participants," =
and the remainder to another Enron-related partnership for $113 million in =
December. What's curious is that the value of the fiber ostensibly increase=
d 53% between June and December--during the same time that, in open markets=
 at least, the value of dark fiber plunged by 67%. LJM2 reaped a $2.4 milli=
on profit from the fiber trade, contributing to the $30 million of undisclo=
sed gains the LJM partnerships delivered to Fastow, according to Enron.=20

Shouldn't Enron's top management or its auditors have sought the identity o=
f the buyers who so overpaid for the fiber asset? One wonders. And where, b=
y the way, was all this fiber? That $100 million, say a fiber broker and an=
 industry analyst, would have bought at least 33,000 miles of single-strand=
 dark fiber in June 2000--enough to string up three nationwide networks--an=
d considerably more by December. Enron's entire network, presumably consist=
ing of multiple strands, was 18,000 miles at the time, with much of that fi=
ber leased.=20
The deal went undisclosed at a time when Skilling and Lay were talking up t=
he great prospects for Enron's broadband business. There's something else t=
hey neglected to mention. Enron provided what its current 10-Q calls "credi=
t support" to the ultimate buyer, guaranteeing the debt. But if the partner=
ship defaulted, Enron was on the hook for $61 million of the $67 million it=
 booked as profits. Former employees say Enron's broadband business consist=
ed largely of such questionable deals. To win a $20 million broadband servi=
ces contract from Rice University in Houston, for example, Enron donated $5=
 million to the school, and Ken Lay's personal foundation kicked in another=
 $3 million. Unreported was the fact that Rice dropped the contract soon af=
ter.=20
The fiber deal finally came to light more than a year after it closed--in E=
nron's 10-Q for the third quarter of 2001. Some of the most exotic deals re=
main hidden in the files at Enron and its co-investors, files that disclose=
 a welter of Delaware partnerships that Fastow formed in 2000 among Enron, =
LJM2 and the so-called Raptor partnerships, which included trusts, limited =
liability corporations and other entities through which cash, stock and der=
ivatives cascaded.=20
Code-named after Southwestern animals, these "special-purpose entities" wer=
e curious beasts indeed. One of them, Bobcat, was capitalized with 6.3 mill=
ion shares of Enron stock whose value was protected by a six-month put opti=
on, expiring in mid-March of 2001, which Bobcat bought from Enron. The put =
obligated Enron to buy its shares back at $68 each. Bobcat in turn sold put=
s back to Enron, protecting it from declines in the value of various assets=
.=20
One of the weirdest aspects of these fancy derivatives: When an asset decli=
ned in value, Enron was sometimes able to avoid booking the paper loss on t=
he asset at the same time that it immediately counted the payout on the pro=
tective put as income. Pure alchemy: Bad investments become profits on the =
income statement.=20
When Enron was trading at $80, Bobcat and its cubmates worked like magic. A=
ny losses on derivatives sold to Enron were offset by an increase in the va=
lue of their Enron stock. But as Enron shares fell below $68 in mid-March 2=
001, Raptor deals started to fall apart. While Enron declines to comment on=
 what happened next, present and former employees describe a mad scramble a=
s the company tried to keep the elaborate structure Fastow created. Solvent=
 partnerships had to prop up failing ones, while Enron executives continued=
 to bail out of their employer's stock. Enron ultimately was forced to admi=
t that Fastow's safety net had failed. The $532 million in hedging gains ge=
nerated by the Raptors was wiped out by $710 million in losses created by t=
heir collapse.=20
At what point did Enron's top executives realize Fastow's edifice was crumb=
ling? SEC attorneys are surely trying to find out.=20
Pleading ignorance, as Andersen did before Congress, may not work. Market d=
ata about falling values for international power plants and dark fiber was =
readily available throughout the period Enron executives were reporting inf=
lated values and selling some $1 billion in stock. That type of information=
 can be used to establish that insiders sold stock knowing it was overvalue=
d, says Jacob Frenkel, a defense lawyer with Smith, Gambrell & Russell in W=
ashington, D.C. and a former SEC enforcement attorney. "If you intentionall=
y choose to be ignorant," he says, "that can satisfy the question of crimin=
al intent."=20

This isn't how it was supposed to work. After Enron declared bankruptcy in =
early December, the other "energy merchants"--Wall Street's name for compan=
ies like Dynegy, Calpine, and Mirant that are engaged in new businesses suc=
h as trading power and building unregulated plants--disclaimed any sort of =
Enronesque behavior. They also downplayed the aftershocks, reiterating prom=
ises of big earnings growth and at times discussing how Enron's downfall wo=
uld actually benefit them.=20
Benefit? Not quite. Some of the "not-Enrons" have suffered huge stock price=
 declines, with Mirant, the worst performer, losing 43% since late November=
. And many have had to revamp their balance sheets. First came El Paso, whi=
ch on Dec. 12 announced plans to sell more than $2 billion of assets, raise=
 money in the equity market, and cut capital expenditures. A few days later=
 Dynegy followed suit. Then came Williams, and finally, on Dec. 19, Mirant =
joined the better- balance-sheet movement. Unfortunately this newfound reli=
gion hasn't always satisfied the suddenly suspicious credit rating agencies=
. Most notably, Moody's downgraded Mirant's debt to junk status.
Though none have proven themselves to be Enrons yet, the energy merchants d=
o deserve some of this bad rap. They all have huge piles of debt, and like =
Enron (and the dot-coms before that), they need the continued cooperation o=
f the capital markets to fund their business plans. Last year widespread fe=
ars of an energy shortage caused people to throw money at new power plants.=
 And the spiking prices and massive volatility caused in large part by the =
California crisis created big profit opportunities for traders. Now people =
are concerned about an energy glut, and prices have fallen sharply. The eff=
ects of all that (plus perhaps tougher accounting rules) on profits remain =
unclear.=20
Believers in the energy merchants insist that a healthier--albeit slower-gr=
owth--industry will emerge from this. "Long-term prospects appear excellent=
," wrote Goldman analyst David Fleischer in a recent note about Dynegy and =
Williams. "Disarming the shorts!" said UBS Warburg's Ron Barone about El Pa=
so's restructuring plans. (Note that Fleischer and Barone remained big Enro=
n supporters until almost the last gasp.)=20
This Wall Street babble won't amount to much; in the end these companies' p=
rospects depend on the enthusiasm of the markets and flawless execution of =
the restructuring plans. And since those plans rely in large part on asset =
sales, it's worth asking: If everyone is selling, who's buying?

Marie Thibaut spent 15 years as an administrative assistant at Enron in Hou=
ston. During that time, she dutifully put 15% of her salary into a 401(k) p=
lan, investing the entire amount in the company's rapidly climbing stock. E=
nron then matched that investment with yet more shares. By the winter of 20=
00, she had amassed close to $500,000 in stock and options, enough for the =
61-year-old divorcee to begin contemplating early retirement. "My children =
told me I should diversify," Thibaut says. "But all the mutual funds were g=
oing down, and I just kept going up." She's not going up any longer. Today,=
 Enron is bankrupt and Thibaut is out of work, a victim of one of the worst=
 corporate collapses in history. Her 401(k) is worth just $22,000.=20
That sorry tale has been repeated thousands of times at Enron, Lucent, Nort=
el, and other companies whose stocks have cratered. But despite the punishi=
ng market and calls for diversification, workers continue to pour a huge po=
rtion of their retirement money into their employer's shares. Benefits cons=
ulting firm Hewitt Associates estimates that as of Oct. 31, almost 30% of t=
he $71 billion in assets in some 1.5 million 401(k) plans were invested in =
the stock of the sponsoring company. At some places the proportion is even =
higher. Microsoft employees keep 46% of their 401(k) funds in company stock=
. At Enron, the figure was 62%. To make matters worse, many of these plans,=
 like Enron's, restrict the sale of stock purchased with matching contribut=
ions until employees are close to retirement.
Now legislators and pension-reform advocates are saying enough is enough. S=
enators Barbara Boxer (D-California) and Jon Corzine (D-New Jersey) are spo=
nsoring a bill that would force diversification by prohibiting any one stoc=
k from making up more than 20% of a 401(k), reducing the tax breaks for com=
panies that match 401(k) contributions with stock, and limiting to 90 days =
the period a company can force employees to hold matching stock. Senator Je=
ff Bingaman (D-New Mexico) also wants to allow companies to provide employe=
es with investment advice without penalty. (Current law makes a company lia=
ble for employees' investment decisions if it offers advice, and as a resul=
t, few do.)=20
The legislation won't necessarily pass without a fight. When Senator Boxer =
attempted to pass a similar bill in 1996, lobbyists-- particularly those fr=
om option-reliant Silicon Valley--succeeded in watering her proposal down t=
o the point where it simply barred companies from forcing employees to inve=
st more than 10% of their own contributions in company stock. There's also =
the issue of companies matching 401(k) contributions with stock. Andrew Lia=
zos, an attorney with McDermott Will & Emery, says if this practice is rest=
ricted, many companies may simply provide no match at all. Plus, he asks, i=
sn't telling employees what to do with their retirement funds a bit paterna=
listic?=20
Pension-reform advocates say a little paternalism is just what is needed. "=
It's unrealistic to think that without a new law employees will limit the a=
mount of company stock they buy," says Eli Gottesdiener, a lawyer who is su=
ing Enron and its accountants on behalf of its 401(k) participants. Given w=
hat's happened at Enron, it'll be hard to counter that argument this time a=
round.=20

The corporate disaster count seems to be going up, and it's worth asking wh=
y. Not that we can tally these things precisely, but think of just the past=
 few months: Enron, the biggest bankruptcy in history, with over $50 billio=
n of shareholder wealth vaporized; Warnaco, another former highflier, with =
shares that now cost less than a Snickers bar; the U.S. steel industry, whi=
ch has finally thrown in the towel and admitted it can't survive on its own=
. Among slightly longer-running disasters, Lucent and Nortel have actually =
destroyed far more shareholder wealth than Enron, and Xerox isn't far behin=
d--but they've been pushed out of the headlines.=20
What went wrong? These are all man-made disasters, and when you search for =
the people to blame, you end up quickly at the board of directors. Somewher=
e around the last recession (1990-91) it dawned on America's shareholders t=
hat when something goes hugely wrong at a company, the buck stops at the bo=
ard. Thus began a great campaign, still going strong, to improve corporate =
governance. Its cause is noble, and it has won a lot of victories.
And yet the corporate-governance follies carry on with a surprising amount =
of vim. To see just how much, stop by a terrific Website at www.thecorporat=
elibrary.com. For our purposes you'll have to bypass the section that gives=
 you the full text of the employment contracts of hundreds of major CEOs, t=
hough I recommend that you check that out later. Right now we're concerned =
with the state of America's boards, and so we arrive at the site's director=
 screening tool, which answers all kinds of interesting questions about the=
 directors of 1,500 companies.=20
One of the major problems with directors of public companies is that they s=
ometimes don't own much of the company's stock. Odds are strong they'd try =
a lot harder if a significant amount of their own money were at stake. So I=
 asked how many directors owned no stock at all in the companies they direc=
ted. Answer: 963--and the director screening tool gives you all their names=
. For example, did you know that Apple Computer CEO Steve Jobs owns no shar=
es of Gap, though he's on the board?=20
Another problem: too many inside directors. Virtually every board will incl=
ude the CEO, which makes sense, and maybe the COO if that person is in line=
 to run the show. More insiders than that can give the CEO too much power o=
ver a group that is supposedly the shareholders' independent guardian. So I=
 asked how many inside directors are on those 1,500 boards. Answer: 4,218, =
or about three per board. Not bad, but what's interesting is the details. T=
he major company with the most inside directors seems to be American Intern=
ational Group, the world's most valuable insurance conglomerate, with nine.=
 You can find plenty of others with seven or eight.=20
Directors who don't go to board meetings aren't worth much, so I asked how =
many directors missed at least 25% of the meetings in the past year. The an=
swer is 271, including many big-deal CEOs who gave short shrift to their ou=
tside boards, such as American Express' Ken Chenault, PepsiCo's Roger Enric=
o, Oracle's Larry Ellison, and News Corp.'s Rupert Murdoch.=20
Just for fun, I asked if there were any triple-threat directors: insiders w=
ho owned no shares and had attendance problems, even though the board meeti=
ngs were presumably just down the hall. There were three. You've never hear=
d of them, believe me.=20
I couldn't resist asking one other question: How many directors are over 90=
? Answer: nine. America's oldest director appears to be George E. Kane, 96,=
 who was just reelected to a three-year term at Panera Bread, which operate=
s bakery cafes around the U.S. This Strom Thurmond of corporate America ser=
ves on the board's audit and nominating committees, and was on the compensa=
tion committee until this year. Unlike Strom, he has not promised he won't =
run again.=20
I'd love to tell you things were getting better in the boardroom. By certai=
n gross measures they clearly are. Investors are far more interested in dir=
ectors than they used to be. Many companies are adopting excellent new poli=
cies on important matters such as mandatory levels of stock ownership and m=
andatory retirement ages for directors. Fed-up investors are flexing their =
muscles far more effectively than before, forcing companies to abandon clas=
sified boards--on which only a fraction of the directors are up for electio=
n in any given year--and other devices that entrench management at the expe=
nse of shareholders.That's all terrific news.=20
But the more important question is, Are boards getting better as fast as th=
e world is getting tougher? Just barely. We should all support the good-gov=
ernance campaign of the past decade. What matters most about corporate gove=
rnance, though, is not whether it's good, but whether it's good enough. Unt=
il the disaster count starts coming down, it isn't.

Features/Accounting In Crisis

Where were the auditors? People ask that question after every corporate col=
lapse, and lately they've been asking it with disturbing frequency. At Wast=
e Management, Sunbeam, Rite Aid, Xerox, and Lucent, major accounting firms =
either missed or ignored serious problems. The number of public companies t=
hat have corrected or restated earnings since 1998 has doubled to 233, acco=
rding to a study by Big Five accounting firm Arthur Andersen. Now, followin=
g the stunning bankruptcy of Andersen's own client Enron, that question--wh=
ere were the auditors?--has become a deafening refrain. "I believe that the=
re is a crisis of confidence in my profession," Andersen CEO Joseph Berardi=
no told a congressional committee investigating Enron's collapse in mid-Dec=
ember. "Real change will be required to regain the public trust."=20
The full story of the Enron debacle--and what Andersen did or did not do in=
 its audit--will take months to emerge. In the meantime, no one disagrees w=
ith Berardino's diagnosis that there's a crisis in accounting--even if his =
sudden emphasis on industrywide reform springs from a desire to deflect att=
ention from Andersen's own culpability. But the kind of "real change" requi=
red is a matter of substantial debate. The government gave the franchise of=
 auditing public companies' financial statements to the accounting industry=
 after the 1929 stock market crash. In the decades since, the accountants h=
ave adroitly avoided significant government regulation by arguing that they=
 can police themselves. Now, post-Enron, they're doing it again. The Big Fi=
ve CEOs issued a rare joint statement outlining how they intend to strength=
en financial reporting and auditing standards. "Self-regulation is right fo=
r investors, the profession, and the financial markets," the release conclu=
des.
But is it? Accounting's main self-regulatory body, the Public Oversight Boa=
rd, is a monument to the profession's failures. The POB was created in the =
late 1970s, when Congress held hearings on a string of audit failures at pu=
blic companies that had--much like the recent rash--shaken confidence in th=
e major auditing firms. The POB, which has no enforcement power, investigat=
es alleged audit failures and oversees a triennial review process in which =
the major accounting firms examine one another's procedures. And yet proble=
ms persist; arguably, they have grown more acute. "Is accounting self-regul=
ation working? On the face of it, it is not," says Representative John Ding=
ell, the powerful Michigan Democrat who has long sparred with the accountin=
g profession.=20
In their defense, the auditors note that current accounting methods, many o=
f which were designed 70 years ago, are difficult to apply to today's compl=
ex financial transactions. And there is no way, they insist, to prevent sop=
histicated fraud. The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (A=
ICPA), the industry's professional association, points out that accountants=
 examine the books of more than 15,000 public companies every year; they ar=
e accused of errors in just 0.1% of those audits. But oh, the price of thos=
e few failures. Lynn Turner, former chief accountant of the Securities and =
Exchange Commission, estimates that investors have lost more than $100 bill=
ion because of financial fraud and the accompanying earnings restatements s=
ince 1995.=20
Perhaps the most glaring example of self-regulation's deficiency has been a=
ccountants' unwillingness to deal with conflicts of interest. Over the year=
s, the major auditing firms have transformed themselves into "professional =
services" companies that derive an increasing portion of revenues and profi=
ts from consulting: selling computer systems, advising clients on tax shelt=
ers, and evaluating their business strategies (see chart). In 1999, accordi=
ng to the SEC, half of the Big Five's revenues came from consulting fees, v=
s. 13% in 1981.=20
Auditing, meanwhile, has become a commodity. Firms have even been accused o=
f using it as a loss leader, a way of getting in the door at a company to s=
ell more-profitable consulting contracts. "Audit work is a marvelous market=
ing tool," says Lou Lowenstein, a professor emeritus of finance and law at =
Columbia University. "You are already there doing the audit. You say their =
internal controls are no good. Well, who are they going to call to fix it?"=
 But this requires a firm to work for the public (auditing) and management =
(consulting). "You cannot serve them both," says former SEC commissioner Be=
vis Longstreth.=20
This conflict may have played a role at Enron. Andersen received $25 millio=
n in auditing fees from Enron last year. That's money Andersen was paid bot=
h as Enron's outside auditor, certifying its financial statements, and as i=
ts internal auditor, making sure Enron had the right systems to keep its bo=
oks and working to detect fraud and irregularities. This double duty alone =
raised a serious potential for conflict. Besides $25 million in accounting =
fees, Andersen was paid $23 million for consulting services. "If you are au=
diting your own creations, it is very difficult to criticize them," says Ro=
bert Willens, a Lehman Brothers tax expert who disapproves of the accountin=
g profession's recent move into selling aggressive tax shelters. Andersen h=
as not revealed the details of its work on Enron's highly controversial off=
-balance-sheet transactions, but the accounting firms have never believed c=
onsulting fees compromise their objectivity. "They have militantly refused =
to ever acknowledge the possibility of a problem," Longstreth says.=20
The major accounting firms say they would not risk their reputations by loo=
king the other way on an audit. And they emphasize that no one has ever pro=
ved that consulting caused a bad audit. Then again, the Big Five are very g=
ood at getting court records sealed and settling lawsuits before trial with=
out admitting wrongdoing. And what has been established during several high=
-profile cases against the Big Five is that auditors' compensation is direc=
tly linked to their ability to sell consulting services. "I think we had lo=
ts of smoking guns," says former SEC chairman Arthur Levitt. Two years ago =
the accounting industry waged a bitter battle with Levitt over the issue of=
 auditor independence. He had considered asking firms to curtail consulting=
, but backed off after encountering stiff resistance from the accountants a=
nd their friends in Congress. In the end, he settled for a rule forcing pub=
lic companies to disclose how much they pay their accountants for auditing =
and consulting. Levitt regrets not doing more. "If I could do it over again=
, I would insist that corporate audit committees approve in advance any con=
sulting contract," he says.=20
One might assume that Enron's collapse would finally give the SEC the polit=
ical cover it needs to impose strict rules segregating auditing and consult=
ing. One might even go so far as to think the accounting profession was in =
jeopardy of losing its right to self- regulation, and that the SEC should s=
tep into the breach. After all, how many chances should one industry get? B=
ut there are no signs that either of those things is about to happen. Harve=
y Pitt, the new SEC chairman, was Andersen's lawyer until taking office in =
August and, big surprise, he's sympathetic to the accountants' arguments. H=
e has given no indication that he plans to relaunch Levitt's anticonsulting=
 crusade, and he has voiced support for self-regulation.=20
Pitt does want some reform. He has called for clearer language in financial=
 statements and prompt disclosure of material information. He has instructe=
d auditors to identify the three to five subjective accounting decisions th=
at are most important to a company's financial status. The accountants shou=
ld then "clearly and concisely" explain those decisions to investors and de=
tail what the effect would be if they used a different accounting treatment=
. And he would like to speed up the process by which the private-sector Fin=
ancial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) creates new accounting rules. Worr=
ied that Levitt's SEC was too adversarial, Pitt is encouraging companies an=
d auditors to consult with the SEC staff if they have accounting questions.=
 "I'm exceedingly tough on improper behavior," he says. "But I am intereste=
d in finding solutions to problems, not just pointing fingers." Pitt says h=
e supports an "effective and transparent" self-regulatory system for accoun=
tants that is subject to "rigorous" SEC oversight. But whether that means a=
nother incremental increase in the POB's power or the creation of a new sel=
f- regulatory organization, he hasn't said.=20
At the POB, Chairman Charles Bowsher is eager to prove his organization is =
up to the job of policing the industry. A former U.S. Comptroller General a=
nd head of the General Accounting Office, Bowsher is armed with a new chart=
er that gives the POB authority over auditing standards, as well as uncondi=
tional funding from the AICPA. (The professional association previously thr=
eatened to withhold money when the POB began studying auditor independence =
violations. The AICPA now says that was a misunderstanding.) Bowsher has ex=
panded Deloitte & Touche's triennial peer review of Andersen to specificall=
y look at issues raised by Enron. But the POB still doesn't have power to e=
nforce recommendations or to discipline firms when they violate guidelines.=
=20
None of these changes will make any difference if accountants continue to d=
ownplay their job as guardians of the public trust. Many seem embarrassed b=
y their watchdog role and have treated their public responsibility as thoug=
h it were a burden. Auditing isn't sexy, the accountants whine; it doesn't =
make them rich. So they've focused on consulting and tried to branch out in=
to corporate finance and even law (heaven help us!). "The industry, from my=
 point of view, has rarely focused on the public interest, only its own par=
ochial business concerns," Levitt says.=20
It wasn't always so. Once, the industry was led by professionals like Leona=
rd Spacek. Spacek, who died in 2000 at 92, was Arthur Andersen's CEO from 1=
947 to 1963 and the profession's elder statesman for long after that. He wa=
sn't afraid to rankle the big accounting firms or Big Business. Throughout =
his career, he pushed to standardize accounting rules so that different com=
panies' financial statements could be fairly compared. He worked to strengt=
hen audit procedures. And although Andersen's forays into consulting began =
on his watch, he spoke often and eloquently about the auditor's role as a p=
rotector of the public interest. "There aren't any Leonard Spaceks in the i=
ndustry anymore," Levitt laments.=20
Perhaps Enron's collapse will chasten the profession enough for it to retur=
n to bedrock principles. And perhaps another Spacek will emerge to lead it.=
 Maybe then that anguished question--where were the auditors?--will reverbe=
rate less often.=20

Enron's woes

If the executive shenanigans that brought Enron to its knees are not crimin=
al acts, they should be.=20
On Nov. 8, Enron was forced to restate its earnings for the past 4 1/2 year=
s, admitting to a near $600 million reduction due to suspect financial repo=
rting. A major factor involves so-called off-balance- sheet deals run by co=
mpany executives. Enron stock has plunged from $80 to less than a dollar, a=
nd the company has since filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
Investors, trusting and awed by the company's posted earnings, learned too =
late of Enron's departure from "generally accepted accounting principles." =
Many have suffered significant losses. A civil suit charges that employees =
were encouraged to invest more heavily in Enron stock just before it tanked=
.=20
In spite of numerous civil suits and an impending congressional investigati=
on, some experts say that a much higher standard of proof may preclude crim=
inal charges. If so, justice will once again be thwarted. Clearly, somebody=
--maybe several somebodies--deserves to spend some time in jail. But don't =
count on it. An old adage says: "If you're going to steal, steal big."

It scarcely seems possible, but two of the staple items on the conversation=
al menu of the left these past years might well be on the edge of disappear=
ance, or at least a change in content. Mumia Abu-Jamal is no longer on deat=
h row. Pacifica's wars are amid final settlement. In both instances, it's a=
 good advertisement for pertinacity. Had it not been for those tireless and=
 oft-ridiculed Mumiacs, I doubt US District Judge William Yohn Jr. would ha=
ve detected those improper jury instructions. Two years ago the Pacifica Na=
tional Board thought it had the situation under control, and it was only a =
matter of time before the ultras were cleaned out of their caves in the mou=
ntains of Berkeley. But the much-derided left kept at it.=20
One good feature of Judge Yohn's ruling is that it takes the emphasis off i=
nnocence or guilt, which surrenders the basic moral axiom of the anti-death=
 penalty cause, namely, that capital punishment is wrong.=20
As for Pacifica, the heat is now on those who fought the national board to =
exhaustion and defeat. Can they produce decent programming and hike Pacific=
a's dismally low audience figures?=20
Enron and the Green Seal=20
The fall of Enron sounds the death knell for one of the great rackets of th=
e past decade: green seals of approval, whereby some outfit like the Natura=
l Resources Defense Council or the Environmental Defense Fund would issue t=
estimonials to the enviro-conscience and selfless devotion to the public we=
al of corporations like Enron. These green seals of approval were part of t=
he neoliberal pitch, that fuddy-duddy regulation should yield to modern, "m=
arket-oriented solutions" to environmental problems. Indeed, NRDC and EDF w=
ere always the prime salesfolk of neoliberal remedies for environmental pro=
blems. NRDC was socked into the Enron lobby machine so deep you couldn't se=
e the soles of its feet. Here's what happened.=20
In 1997 high-flying Enron found itself in a pitched battle in Oregon, where=
 it planned to acquire Portland General Electric, Oregon's largest public u=
tility. Warning that Enron's motives were of a highly predatory nature, the=
 staff of the state's Public Utility Commission (PUC) opposed the merger. T=
hey warned that an Enron takeover would mean less ability to protect the en=
vironment, increased insecurity for PGE's workers and, in all likelihood, s=
oaring prices.=20
Other critics argued that Enron's actual plan was to cannibalize PGE, in pa=
rticular its hydropower, which Enron would sell into California's energy ma=
rket.=20
But at the very moment when such protests threatened to balk Enron of its p=
rize, into town rode NRDC's top energy commissar, Ralph Cavanagh, Heinz env=
ironmental genius award pinned to his armor and flaunting ties to the Energ=
y Foundation, a San Francisco-based outfit providing financial wattage for =
many citizen and environmental groups that work on utility and enviro issue=
s.=20
Cavanagh lost no time whipping the refractory Oregon greens into line. In c=
oncert with Enron, the NRDC man put together a memo of understanding, pledg=
ing that the company would lend financial support to some of these groups' =
pet projects. But Cavanagh still had some arduous politicking ahead. An OK =
for the merger had to come from the PUC, whose staff was adamantly opposed.=
 So, on Valentine's Day, 1997, Cavanagh showed up at a hearing in Salem, Or=
egon, to plead Enron's case.=20
Addressing the three PUC commissioners, he averred that this was "the first=
 time I've ever spoken in support of a utility merger." If so, it was the q=
uickest transition from virginity to seasoned service in the history of int=
ellectual prostitution. Cavanagh reveled in the delights of an Enron embrac=
e: "What we've put before you with this company is, we believe, a robust as=
sortment of public benefits for the citizens of Oregon which would not emer=
ge, Mr. Chairman, without the merger." With a warble in his throat, Cavanag=
h moved into rhetorical high gear: "The Oregonian asks the question, 'Can y=
ou trust Enron?' On stewardship issues and public benefit issues I've dealt=
 with this company for a decade, often in the most contentious circumstance=
s, and the answer is, yes."=20
Cavanagh won the day for the Houston-based energy giant. The PUC approved t=
he merger, and it wasn't long before the darkest suspicions of Enron's plan=
s were vindicated. The company raised rates, tried to soak the ratepayers w=
ith the cost of its failed Trojan nuclear reactor and moved to put some of =
PGE's most valuable assets on the block. Enron's motive had indeed been to =
get access to the hydropower of the Northwest, the cheapest in the country,=
 and sell it into the California market, the priciest and--in part because =
of Cavanagh's campaigning for deregulation--a ripe energy prize awaiting ex=
ploitation.=20
Then, after two years, the company Cavanagh had hailed as being "engaged an=
d motivated" put PGE up on the auction block. Pending sale of PGE, Enron ha=
s been using it as collateral for loans approved by a federal bankruptcy ju=
dge.=20
Enron is best known as George W. Bush's prime financial backer in his presi=
dential quest. But it was a bipartisan purveyor of patronage: to its right,=
 conservative Texas Senator Phil Gramm; to its left, liberal Texas Democrat=
 Sheila Jackson-Lee (who had Enron's CEO Ken Lay as her finance chairman in=
 a Democratic primary fight preluding her first successful Congressional bi=
d; her Democratic opponent was Craig Washington, an anti-NAFTA maverick Dem=
ocrat the Houston establishment didn't care for). Today some House Republic=
ans want to treat the Enron collapse as a criminal matter, while Democrats =
have been talking in vaguer terms about cleaning up accounting rules and pl=
ugging holes in the regulatory system. The inability of Enron's employees t=
o sell company stock from their 401(k)s while high-ups absconded with milli=
ons may doom Bush's promised onslaught on Social Security. There are many m=
orals in Enron's collapse, and the role of that green seal of approval shou=
ld not be forgotten.

TXU CEO Ready As New Year Rings In Retail Deregulation
By Christina Cheddar

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES=20
(This story was originally published Monday.)=20

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- As the clock strikes midnight in the Lone Star State=
, ringing in the New Year, it is unlikely many will gather to toast their n=
ewly-gained right to pick a supplier of electricity.
However, 2002 kicks off an important chapter in history of Texas electricit=
y deregulation, and TXU Corp. (TXU), the state's largest electricity suppli=
er, appears excited about the opportunities retail competition will bring i=
t.=20
With the transition in Texas, about 75% of TXU's earnings will come from pr=
oviding energy to customers in a deregulated environment, TXU Chairman and =
Chief Executive Erle Nye said in an interview with Dow Jones Newswires. The=
 Dallas company has 11 million customers worldwide, with about 2.7 million =
of those in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and in northern Texas.=20
Nye said he has been a proponent of retail competition for many years becau=
se he feels a deregulated market drives innovation, allocates capital most =
effectively, and punishes poor performance. Most importantly, costs drop, h=
e said.=20
According to Nye, on average, TXU customers will see a 14% reduction in the=
ir electricity bills compared with last year. Although part of the decrease=
 is due to the effect of lower natural gas prices in the state, the company=
 had promised a minimum of a 6% price reduction, he said.=20
Under the state's 1999 restructuring law, customers of the incumbent utilit=
ies who don't switch energy providers will be assigned to the retail electr=
ic provider operated by the utility company. Those customers will pay a set=
 rate for at least three years, or until at least 40% of the utility's cust=
omers switch to another electricity provider. Meanwhile, the new electricit=
y providers, may change the prices they charge up to twice year if there ar=
e changes in natural gas or power costs.=20
"Outside our area, we are trying to pick up some customers," Nye said. "We =
know we will lose some of our current customers. We are hoping there is at =
least a balance." He declined to more specific about the company's expectat=
ions.=20
As for its earnings outlook, TXU expects it will be able to maintain its 9%=
 to 11% growth rate in the competitive market, Nye said.=20
For the fourth quarter, Nye said he would be "shocked" if the company was u=
nable to meet the current Wall Street consensus of 67 cents a share reporte=
d by Thomson Financial/First Call.=20
A year ago, TXU earned 61 cents a share.=20
"We are very comfortable with the consensus," he said.=20
Despite the imminent start of retail competition in Texas, efforts to persu=
ade consumers to switch electricity providers have been muted so far.=20
TXU's Nye admits his company hasn't spent much on advertising to consumers,=
 but expects the company to step up its marketing efforts as the year progr=
esses.=20
TXU is in the process of establishing offices in parts of Texas outside its=
 traditional operating area, and is making an effort to establish "personal=
 contact" in those communities.=20
TXU also is directly contacting medium-to-small industrial customers that m=
ight consider switching electricity providers.=20
According to Nye, early efforts to get the internal data processing and cle=
arance systems that would allow for a smooth transition to competition oper=
ating properly had preoccupied the company during the six-month pilot progr=
am.=20
During the pilot, 5% of Texas residential customers were allowed to try new=
 providers. Despite a slowed start brought on by computer glitches at the s=
tate's power grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or E=
RCOT, the system is said to be ready to begin as planned.=20
Tony Spare, portfolio manager of Spare Value First and a TXU investor, said=
 the company has been "chomping on the bit for the new business opportuniti=
es" presented by deregulation. According to Spare, TXU is an "effective mar=
keter" and its nuclear assets will help the company's price competitiveness=
.=20
Spare's view of TXU hasn't changed despite a recent bumpy ride in the utili=
ty sector brought on by Enron Corp.'s (ENE) stunning and rapid financial co=
llapse.=20
In the aftermath of Enron's collapse, TXU's comparatively conservative stra=
tegy may be coming into back into vogue.=20
According to Nye, TXU has always used energy trading as a way to obtain mar=
ket information.=20
"We trade around resources," he said, adding that the company's trading act=
ivities are limited to its core areas: electricity, gas and telecommunicati=
ons.=20
That behavior distinguishes TXU from Enron, Nye said. He cited Enron's aggr=
essive trading practices, its accounting practices, and in inability to tak=
e the proper reserves as factors that contributed to Enron's need to file f=
or Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in early December.=20
Still, there is no doubt that Enron's troubles have caused credit rating ag=
encies to take a tougher stance toward companies in the sector, and TXU is =
among those companies receiving more closer scrutiny.=20
Recently, the two largest credit rating agencies, Moody's Investors Service=
 and Standard & Poor's, affirmed TXU's investment grade status. However, in=
 its review, S&P said TXU must continue its current efforts to reduce its h=
igh leverage in the coming year.=20
Nye declined to say what the company's ideal debt-to-capital ratio is, but =
he said the company would continue to reduce its debt level. He added, it i=
s essential to have a "strong credit rating ... one to two levels above the=
 investment grade level."=20
Despite the need to reduce debt, Nye doesn't dismiss the possibility for fu=
ture acquisitions at the right price.=20
"We're excited about our prospects for the company," Nye said. As several r=
ival energy merchants begin to shed assets to raise money to reduce debt, T=
XU will be watching closely to see which assets come up for sale.=20
"I had said a long time ago that there will be a secondary market (for ener=
gy assets). That expectation has come to pass," Nye said. "We're interested=
 in the fact that so many are looking to sell assets."=20
In addition to Texas, TXU has been active in the Northeast and the Midwest.=
=20
In Europe, the company has a presence in the Nordic region, and has been bu=
ilding positions in Germany and the Iberian peninsula.=20

USA: Finance - Small steps seen improving financial health.
By Linda Stern

01/02/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

WASHINGTON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - After a bad year, the financial markets are s=
ignaling "Recovery, ho!" But many people don't feel so "recovered" personal=
ly.=20
They may be looking at diminished stock portfolios, flat 401(k)s and stacks=
 of holiday bills. They may be lacking the enthusiasm for yet another New Y=
ear's "get-my-finances-fixed" resolution after last year's list turned out =
so badly.
No matter! It's not the sweeping pronouncements or big market moves that ma=
ke or break a financial life. It's the little actions that add up to financ=
ial stability.=20
So skip the resolutions and get straight to a simple to-do list that will m=
ake you richer by this time next year.=20
Here it is:=20
- Get a better credit card. If you pay off your balances every month, you c=
an't do any better than a straight-up cash rebate card. There aren't many o=
ut there, but three that have no annual fees and offer cash back on every p=
urchase are the Fleet Titanium Cash Rebate Card (http://www.fleet.com); the=
 National City Cash Builder Platinum Visa (http://www.nationalcity.com) and=
 the American Express Platinum Cash Rebate Card (http://www.americanexpress=
.com). All three credit various amounts of cash (up to 2 percent of purchas=
es) to your account once a year. If you're a big convenience user, you can =
accumulate enough cash back on any of these plans to buy your own airline t=
icket once a year.=20
- Dump some company stock. If your retirement plan has more than 10 percent=
 of its assets invested in shares of the company you work for, sell the ext=
ra and buy something else. You don't want to be overly dependent on one fir=
m for your livelihood and your savings, and if you're confused about this a=
dvice, just remember one word: Enron.=20
- Buy some other stocks, or stock funds. Sure, most investors took a whippi=
ng in 2001. But over the long term, stocks still rule and in 10 years you'l=
l be glad you bought now.=20
- Start a no-brainer IRA. If you make under $53,000 a year joint ($33,000 s=
ingle), or you work for a company that doesn't offer a retirement plan, you=
're eligible for a deductible IRA. If you make more than that, you can open=
 a Roth IRA. Either one will allow you to take tax breaks for building mone=
y on your own. Establish this account in a low-fee index fund, such as Vang=
uard's Total Market Index Fund (http://www.vanguard.com) or the Fidelity Sp=
artan Total Market Index (http://www.fidelity.com). For 2002, you're allowe=
d to contribute $3,000, as long as you earn that much in salary. Divide tha=
t by 12 for a monthly contribution of $250. When you set up your account, a=
uthorize the fund company to deduct that $250 every month from your checkin=
g account. That's it, you're done. Readjust again in 2005, when the limits =
go up to $4,000. Look forward to accumulating $20,518 in five years, $63,34=
4 in ten years and more and more as you continue.=20
- Refinance and shorten your mortgage. You've already missed the bottom in =
home loan rates but there are deals to be had. You can get a 15 year fixed =
rate loan for under 7 percent. If you're currently carrying an 8.5 percent =
30 year loan, it will raise your monthly payment by about $80 to downsize t=
o a 15 year loan at today's rates. But you'll be burning that paper 15 year=
s early and you'll save close to $120,000 in interest over the life of the =
loan.=20
- Restructure your debt, like a corporation. The rates on second mortgages =
are way better than the rates on credit cards and most car loans, and the i=
nterest on them is typically tax deductible. If you're carrying credit card=
 and car debt, consider getting a home loan that will consolidate it and le=
t you pay it off in a hurry. Ignore this advice if you don't trust yourself=
 to really pay it off in a hurry and keep those other balances at zero. If =
you don't have that kind of discipline (or cash), at least pay extra amount=
s toward your credit card with the highest rate until you knock that down t=
o zero.=20
- Rebalance your portfolio. Chances are that over the last year, the bond p=
ortion of your portfolio grew relative to the stock portion. With interest =
rates near their lows, and probably headed higher (assuming that 2002 recov=
ery), it's a good time to sell off some of those bonds before they head in =
the opposite direction. Put the money back in stocks until the asset alloca=
tion you get back to your original asset allocation.=20
- Build a bond or CD ladder.zz~ the bond portion of your money on autopilot=
. Divide the amount of money you have invested in bonds into five chunks. P=
ut the first chunk into a one-year bond, the second into a two-year bond, t=
he third into three-year maturities and so on. Then every year, as your bon=
d comes due, roll it over into a five year bond or certificate of deposit. =
In five years, you'll have everything invested in five year maturities, ear=
ning higher rates than you would with shorter maturities. But you'll get so=
me money back to reinvest every year, reducing the likelihood that all of y=
our money will be tied up long term when rates rise. Once you've built this=
 ladder, you can practically go to sleep.=20
- Buy some inflation-indexed bonds before there's inflation. The Treasury s=
ells inflation protected securities (TIPS) and I-bonds. They both guarantee=
 a real rate of return above inflation of about 3 percent. Currently, the T=
IPS (available through www.treasurydirect.gov) are paying 3.5 percent. "Tha=
t is an extraordinary rate of return," says William Tedford, director of fi=
xed income strategy for Stephens Capital Management in Little Rock. "That's=
 probably as good as they are going to get."=20
These bonds do hit investors with a heavier than usual tax bill, though, si=
nce a portion of the income is taxed annually but not paid out until the bo=
nd matures. To avoid that problem consider buying a TIP fund, such as PIMCO=
 Real Return Bond fund or Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities fund with=
in a tax-deferred account.=20

US energy cos hoping to sell assets to reduce debts - report

01/02/2002
AFX News
(c) 2002 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

NEW YORK (AFX) - US energy companies are now looking to sell off assets to =
lighten their debt-heavy balance sheets, the Wall Street Journal reported.=
=20
Prices for electricity and natural gas in the US have plummeted, while inve=
stors are fleeing and debt holders are worried about credit exposure caused=
 by Enron Corp's collapse, the WSJ added.
Houston-based Enron, until recently the biggest electricity and natural gas=
 trader, filed last month for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Ba=
nkruptcy Code while it seeks to reorganize.=20
El Paso Energy Corp said it will sell natural gas fields in the shallow wat=
ers in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as gas assets in Oklahoma, Arkansas and =
Kansas.=20
It is also putting a 150,000-barrel-per-day New Jersey oil refinery and som=
e coal mines up for sale, according to the WSJ. The company says it wants 5=
00 mln usd for both the refinery and the coal mines.=20
Valero Energy Corp, an independent refining and marketing company based in =
San Antonio, said it "would take a look" at the plant. Meanwhile, Valero is=
 closing a 4 bln usd acquisition of Ultramar Diamond Shamrock Corp.=20
In addition, Atlanta-based Mirant said it intends to sell electricity plant=
s in Massachusetts acquired a few years ago. But "almost anything would be =
considered for sale, for the right price," says spokesman Chuck Griffin.=20
TXU Corp is also divesting itself of plants in its home state, to stay belo=
w market-concentration limits that are part of a state electricity deregula=
tion plan. TXU is using proceeds to retire debt and pick up assets elsewher=
e, the WSJ said.=20
The WSJ added that European companies will be looking to buy individual ele=
ctricity plants that can make good profits in the deregulated markets of Ne=
w York, New England, the Mid-Atlantic and California.=20
Among the likely European buyers are E.ON AG and RWE AG, which recently acq=
uired American Water Works, which owns regulated water utilities throughout=
 the US; Tractebel North America Inc, the energy arm of Paris-based Suez th=
at already is building power plants in Washington and Texas; and the UK's P=
owergen PLC, which bought LG&E Energy Corp last year.=20
Among the US companies that could pick up assets are two Houston-based comp=
anies -- Anadarko Petroleum Corp and Apache Corp, as well as others includi=
ng American Electric Power, TXU, Duke Energy Corp, Dominion Resources Inc a=
nd Entergy Corp.=20

Master short seller raised flag on Enron: Roberts tags Kodak, Safeway as st=
ocks to avoid

FP10 / Front

With the righteous anger of hindsight, U.S. senators and journalists have d=
emanded why no one foresaw the failure of Enron Corp. In fact, someone did.=
 And it's in writing. Last May, when Enron shares traded at US$59, Off Wall=
 Street Consulting Group issued a 27-page report debunking the profits clai=
med by Enron, the Houston energy-trading firm now notorious in any living r=
oom that has a TV set.=20
"We pretty much put our finger on all the problems Enron had," says Mark Ro=
berts, who runs Off Wall Street's research team in an office on a side stre=
et of Cambridge, Mass. Enron awarded itself profits, noted Off Wall Street'=
s researchers, by marking its trading positions to "market" prices when no =
real market existed for the stuff that Enron traded. Related-party dealings=
 with private partnerships also seemed designed by Enron to boost its publi=
cly reported earnings.
Mr. Roberts' prescience wasn't perfect. He never expected Enron to collapse=
 into bankruptcy. When Enron shares slid below Mr. Roberts' downside price =
target of US$30 -- to US$26 in September -- Off Wall Street recommended tha=
t clients close short positions. And when the shares rallied briefly to US$=
36, Roberts wiped his brow in relief. The shares have since collapsed to ju=
st pennies, but clients who followed Off Wall Street's recommendations made=
 handsome profits.=20
In addition to Enron, Roberts' research boutique supplied 20 other short-sa=
le ideas in 2001 to a clientele of money managers. Over the 12 months ended=
 September, Off Wall Street's recommendations gained 94%.=20
(Gains on short sales are computed by using the current price as the purcha=
se price; as such, a stock that falls 50% would produce a 100% gain.) In co=
ntrast, shorting the Standard & Poor's 500, which fell 22% over the same pe=
riod, would have produced a 44% return.=20
The market has since rebounded. But Off Wall Street still seems poised to c=
lose the year with a 50%-plus paper return on its research, which Mr. Rober=
ts, who doesn't manage money, sells to clients for a hefty price.=20
Since 1995, Mr. Roberts' recommendations have outpaced an S&P index short b=
y an average of 31% a year. That's why clients pay heed to his warnings abo=
ut Eastman Kodak and Safeway Inc.=20
The Off Wall Street process starts with computer screens, looking for an in=
tersection of a high stock price with a business whose operating numbers bo=
de ill. Such a path often leads right into Wall Street's latest fad.=20
At the height of the Internet bubble, Off Wall Street's portfolio of short =
ideas consisted of about two-thirds tech stocks. In the past year, tech nam=
es yielded to medical stocks and alternative energy.=20
Since September, Mr. Roberts has been encouraging investors to steer clear =
of Kodak. The shares (EK/NYSE) had been holding steady around US$45, as inv=
estors took solace that the photography giant could maintain its 4% dividen=
d yield by wringing more cash flow from operations.=20
But the U.S. consumer market for film, which underlies half of Kodak's sale=
s and operating profits, has been declining at an 11% annual rate as digita=
l photography grows. Kodak is faring even worse, with 19% declines in film =
volume as it scraps for a shrinking market against Fuji and the private-lab=
el offerings of Wal-Mart Stores.=20
Kodak spokesman Paul Allen told Barron's the company does not comment on an=
alyst research.=20
In October, Kodak guided down December quarter earnings expectations from a=
bout US46 cents a share, to US15 cents. Its shares have fallen to around US=
$31, but Mr. Roberts believes Kodak could fall to US$22. "We expect the [US=
$1.80] dividend to get cut," he says, "and the dividend is one of the main =
props of the stock."=20
Another of Mr. Roberts' current short recommendations is Safeway (SWY/NYSE)=
, the 1,750- store supermarket chain based in Pleasanton, Calif. He first r=
ecommended sale of the stock in April, when it was trading at US$53. Curren=
t price: US$45.=20
In recent years Safeway has justly earned investors' admiration, with sales=
 growth and profit margins that exceeded those of such rivals as Kroger and=
 Albertson's. But Wall Street has been valuing Safeway at 86% of its US$32-=
billion in year 2000 sales, while valuing Kroger at just 38% of sales.=20
Looking at Safeway's year 2000 earnings of US$1-billion, or US$2.13 a share=
, Mr. Roberts noted that 10% came from sales of real estate and investment =
gains in the supermarket's pension fund. Back out those non-grocery profits=
, and Safeway's earnings grew just 13% in 2000. In prior years, earnings gr=
owth had averaged better than 25%.=20
Sales have slowed in 2001, based on identical-store sales growth. The likel=
y cause, says Mr. Roberts, has been the arrival of deep discounters Wal-Mar=
t and Costco on Safeway's turf.=20
Ultimately, Mr. Roberts believes Safeway could fall as low as US$35.=20
"We strongly disagree with what he [Mr. Roberts] has written," says Safeway=
 spokesperson Melissa Plaisance.=20
She acknowledges that earnings gains from investing and real estate in 2000=
 led to tough comparisons in the current year. But those comparisons are no=
w behind Safeway, and it will give investors updated guidance in a conferen=
ce call Jan. 24.

MUMBAI - Gas Authority of India Ltd., the country's biggest gas supplier, s=
aid it plans to bid for the US$3-billion Indian power plant of U.S.-based E=
nron Corp., which last month made the largest-ever filing for bankruptcy.=
=20
Gas Authority will bid for Dabhol Power Co., Enron's local unit, with a so-=
called "strategic partner," the state-run company said in a statement. It d=
idn't name the partner.
Dabhol was Enron's biggest investment outside the U.S. as the company sough=
t to expand overseas. Enron put the plant up for sale before it filed for b=
ankruptcy because of a payment dispute with a state electricity board, its =
sole customer.=20
Enron wants US$1-billion for its 65% stake. Tata Power Ltd. and BSES Ltd., =
the two bidders for the stake, have said the price is too high and are nego=
tiating with local lenders who have loaned the project US$1.4-billion.=20
Gas Authority needs Dabhol's liquefied natural gas facility to feed more ga=
s through its 4,594-km network of pipelines across the country. It gets its=
 supplies from Oil & Natural Gas Ltd., a state-run oil explorer that hasn't=
 made any big discoveries since 1975.=20
That's forced Gas Authority to look for other sources of gas. It has partne=
red Indian Oil Corp. and Oil & Natural Gas Corp. to build a five-million-to=
n-a-year gas plant in India's western province of Gujarat.=20
Dabhol Power's 5.5-million-ton gas facility was part of a US$2-billion plan=
 to boost the utility's capacity to 2,184 megawatts from 740. Contractors h=
alted work on the plant, saying they hadn't been paid since April last year=
, leaving the expansion 97% complete. The power plant burned naphtha, a che=
mical refined from crude oil, and was to switch to gas once the expansion w=
as complete.=20
The plant was shut in May after Enron gave notice it would cancel a supply =
contract with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board because it was owed U=
S$64-million in overdue bills. The board stopped paying for Dabhol's power,=
 saying it was too expensive.=20
Enron last month fired 300 workers in India because of the overdue bills. D=
abhol isn't listed among Enron's 17 units that have sought court protection=
 from creditors owed US$31-billion.

GAS AUTHORITY OF INDIA TO BID FOR ENRON'S DABHOL POWER PROJECT

GAIL is understood to be keen on DPC's LNG line and may shortly start talks=
 with other power companies for joining its bid to manage the power project=
.=20
GAIL communicated its decision to join the race for acquiring stake in DPC =
only after securing clearance from the Ministry of Petroleum, a GAIL statem=

sector as part of its proposed integration into energy related areas.=20
GAIL will shortly sign confidentiality agreements with the concerned partie=

GAIL intends to adopt a broad-based approach while undertaking the due dili=
gence as it has already made an entry into the power sector through equity =
participation in a gas-based power project in Gujarat.=20

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was expected to bring its first=
 enforcement actions soon in two areas - "pro forma" financial results repo=
rting and Regulation FD, or fair disclosure, sources say.=20
The pro forma case was to have been brought before the holidays, but was de=
layed. Sources said Monday it will now likely be brought in January. The co=
mpany being targeted was unknown.
"The SEC absolutely needs to clamp down on pro forma earnings .... There ha=
ve been some real abuses out there," Lynn Turner, former SEC chief accounta=
nt and now a professor at Colorado State University, said in an interview w=
ith Reuters.=20
If the commission were to act soon and forcefully on pro forma reporting an=
d Regulation FD, it would help to answer critics suggesting that SEC chairm=
an Harvey Pitt is "going soft" on enforcement, which securities lawyers sai=
d is a "bum rap."=20
Pressure for the SEC to get tough on corporate reporting has increased in r=
ecent weeks since the stunning collapse of former energy trading giant Enro=
n Corp., which cost thousands of people their jobs and much of their saving=
s.=20
Pitt said earlier this month that pro forma numbers making a loss look like=
 a profit, without explaining clearly how, were likely to be viewed as frau=
dulent.=20
In mid-November, he said the SEC was sizing up possible pro forma enforceme=
nt actions.=20
Pro forma results skate around accounting conventions - codified in the Gen=
erally Accepted Accounting Principles - either to highlight good results ob=
scured by outmoded conventions or, more often, to hide poor results.=20
They are sometimes labelled as "core," "normalized" or "adjusted" results. =
Often they exclude costs related to mergers, stock options, unusual events =
or other items.=20
The most frequent users of the pro forma style are technology companies. Am=
ong recent issuers of such reports are Computer Associates International In=
c., Amazon.com Inc. and Cisco Systems Inc. Reuters research showed 62 compa=
nies on the Merrill Lynch technology 100 index reported pro forma results i=
n press releases for the third quarter of 2001.=20
Pro forma numbers are most often found in reports and press releases intend=
ed for consumption by the media and the general public.=20
Sources said the SEC's New York regional office had been probing four pro f=
orma cases, but records were lost in the Sept. 11 attacks that destroyed so=
me SEC offices. As a result, the case soon to be brought may be new, source=
s said.=20
A technology company is widely thought to be the target, although sources s=
aid Walt Disney Co. and other major non-tech companies have recently issued=
 pro forma results.=20
The Regulation FD case expected to be brought soon was not moving as rapidl=
y as the pro forma case, sources said.=20
Regulation FD - was adopted a year ago. It requires corporations to disclos=
e key information to the public and the financial community at the same tim=
e.=20
It was drafted in response to widespread complaints from small investors th=
at Wall Street insiders were being tipped off on big news hours or sometime=
s days before everyone else. The law is a regular target of scorn in the fi=
nancial community.=20
Pitt has called "unassailable" the law's underlying principle - "that nobod=
y should have an unfair advantage."=20
No enforcement action has yet been brought by the SEC on the disclosure rul=
e.=20
"There's been talk that they're going to bring an FD case .... There were s=
ome violations," Chuck Hill, director of research at First Call, a market r=
esearch unit of financial services group Thomson Financial, said in an inte=

NEW YORK -- One would think that J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., as one of Enron C=
orp.'s largest creditors, would want to find as much information as possibl=
e about the finances of the now-bankrupt energy trader.=20
Not so. In fact, as a sure sign that the interests of various Enron credito=
rs have begun to collide, J.P. Morgan Chase filed a motion over the weekend=
 to quash demands for information related to some $2 billion (2.24 billion =
euros) in Enron-related surety bonds made by nine insurance companies.
J.P. Morgan filed the suit against the insurers after they said that they w=
ouldn't honor about $1.1 billion of the bonds, including $965 million owed =
to J.P. Morgan earlier this month. J.P. Morgan is now seeking to prevent th=
e insurers from using the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District o=
f New York to gather information about whether Enron and J.P. Morgan Chase =
misrepresented the facts to secure the surety bonds.=20
Enron filed a similar motion opposing the insurers' demands for further inf=
ormation, claiming like J.P. Morgan Chase that the court should turn down t=
he insurers because they are going on a "fishing expedition."=20
The insurers are questioning whether forward-sales contracts that they bond=
ed for Enron ever existed. According to court documents, Citigroup Inc.'s T=
ravelers insurance unit and eight other insurers wrote to J.P. Morgan Chase=
 in early December, essentially telling the investment bank that they neede=
d more proof of the forward-sales contracts' legitimacy before they would h=
onor their surety-bond payments.=20
The other insurers include: Kemper Insurance Co.'s Lumbermens Mutual Casual=
ty Co.; Allianz AG's Fireman's Fund Insurance Co.; Chubb Corp.'s Federal In=
surance Co.; St. Paul Cos.'s Fire and Marine Insurance; CNA Surety Corp.'s =
Continental Casualty Co.; Safeco Corp's Safeco Insurance Co.; Hartford Fina=
ncial Services Group Inc.; and Liberty Mutual Insurance Co.=20
All the insurers, with the exception of Citigroup's Travelers, have since f=
iled answers and counterclaims in court, essentially demanding that Judge A=
rthur J. Gonzalez declares the surety bonds void because Enron and Chase mi=
srepresented the facts surrounding their issuance.=20
Citigroup's reluctance to stand against J.P. Morgan Chase may be at least p=
artly explained by the fact that both institutions are lead bankers for Enr=
on. Together, they are seeking to set up a $1.5 billion financing package t=
o help Enron back on its feet.=20
In their separate motions, J.P. Morgan Chase and Enron claim that the insur=
ers' demands for information would impede the court's bankruptcy proceeding=
s. The insurance companies "unabashingly seek to invoke Rule 2004 to furthe=
r their own interests," J.P. Morgan Chase said in its motion. J.P. Morgan a=
lso claimed that the insurers' moves are designed to use the bankruptcy pro=
ceedings to further information-gathering efforts in a pending civil litiga=
tion.=20
The J.P. Morgan Chase suit was first filed in New York State Court and then=
 moved to U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.=20
The forward-sales contracts in dispute were made between Enron and two offs=
hore companies, Mahonia Ltd. and Mahonia Natural Gas Ltd., both based in th=
e Channel Islands. Under the contracts, Mahonia was supposed to prepay for =
the delivery of oil and natural gas from Enron, which would then procure th=
e fuel from an array of producers for delivery to various end-users. The en=
d-users, in turn, were supposed to pay Mahonia for the oil and gas.=20
The nine insurers bonded Enron's obligation to deliver the oil and gas, but=
 balked when J.P. Morgan Chase asked them on Dec. 7 to honor that commitmen=
t, five days after Enron had filed for bankruptcy. The insurers told J.P. M=
organ in a letter that day that they have "received credible information th=
at, in fact, there may never have been any producer contracts or end-user c=
ontracts. In addition, Enron may never have delivered any oil or natural ga=
s under the forward sales contracts to Mahonia or any other party," accordi=
ng to the letters to J.P. Morgan Chase.=20
In addition to requesting documentation for the forward-sales contracts, th=
e insurers also asked for an explanation of the corporate relationship betw=
een J.P. Morgan Chase and Mahonia.

FAITH POPCORN has seen the future, and it's a real mouthful.=20
Take a deep breath and listen in for a moment.
There you are, surfing Cyberia, when some karaoke manager from the bachelor=
 herd barges in (no supreme C.E.O. he, no master of Genghis capitalism). Th=
is guy needs an ego audit, you mutter, but you hit the boss key anyway. You=
're no flexecutive, after all, just a lowly permalance. Your prebuttals fal=
l flat, and he orders you on to a data fast, tosses a message slip on your =
inflatable, and leaves.=20
You look at the slip. The woman you had the fight chat with. Definitely cos=
metic underclass. Not remotely Pilotable. You toss a lunch lob, and call ho=
me to check on your baboon wife and the free-range children.=20
Whew! Had enough?=20
And now, in a just world, you'd get a translation. Forget it. (Basically, i=
t would take much too long.) No, you'll just have to read ''Dictionary of t=
he Future,'' by Ms. Popcorn and Adam Hanft (Hyperion, $22.95), for yourself=
.=20
(Oh, all right, here are a couple, since they are sort of fun: Bachelor her=
ds are the young men left mateless when older ones grab trophy wives, and b=
aboons are baby boomers with no savings.)=20
What, exactly, is a dictionary of the future? Apparently, the old model jus=
t can't keep up -- with those stuffy, tweedy souls content ''to track the e=
bb and flow of language'' and open the ivied dictionary gates only to words=
 that have stood the test of time.=20
Too slow! the authors cry. This is a split-second, rat-a-tat world. We can'=
t wait around to see what words stick. We'll tell you where the language is=
 headed. We're ''linguistic prospectors,'' ''anticipators.''=20
For this dictionary, dawdlers need not apply. To enter here, words must be =
white-hot, mere moments from the authors' fiery imaginations. ''Downsizing'=
'? Doesn't make the cut. ''Not new enough.''=20
This ''joyride through the culture'' does make a nod to what could be serio=
us, lasting phenomena -- like hybrid cars and wind farms. But for the most =
part it's a breathless effort to be up-to-the-nanosecond fresh.=20
Between cup and lip, though -- between idea and bound book -- the world eco=
nomy slipped, making the boom-time ''employer of choice'' and ''pleading ec=
onomy'' entries decidedly dated.=20
Then again, ''stock therapy'' and getting ''401-K'd'' are frighteningly tim=
ely; think of Enron shareholders. But ''language extinction'' -- that one's=
 too painfully close to home to contemplate.=20
But wait. Are the authors just kidding around? You might think so, with all=
 those wordplays -- hyber-nation and scarevoyants.=20
But there's an undeniable earnestness here, a solemnity. (There is a sugges=
tion to read the book ''in a nonlinear sort of fashion.'') And they do put =
themselves in some heady company, at one point even invoking Shakespeare --=
 that ''unrepentant serial coiner'' -- to bless their mission of invention.=

What fools these mortals be.

Finally, a reporter had the temerity to question Bush on Friday regarding t=
he ignominious collapse of Enron Corp. run by Kenneth L. Lay, a Bush family=
 intimate and top campaign contributor. Bush expressed concern "for the cit=
izens of Houston who worked for Enron who lost life savings" and added: "It=
's very important for us to fully understand the 'whys' of Enron."=20
Sure is, but did Bush never ask "Kenny Boy"--his nickname for Enron's chair=
man--what was going on?
After all, not only was Kenny Boy one of Bush's major contributors, but it =
was Lay and Enron that Bush turned to for critical advice on how to further=
 exploit U.S. natural resources.=20
The media, which had hounded Bill Clinton on his Whitewater connections, ha=
ve allowed Bush to maintain the fiction that his--and his father's--adminis=
tration had nothing to do with the debacle that is Enron.=20
Given the intense interest in the list of those who slept over in the Clint=
on White House, it's odd that no attention has been paid to Kenny Boy's sle=
epover in the early years of the senior Bush's White House.=20
Those early Bush years were crucial for Enron, beginning with the passage o=
f the 1992 Energy Policy Act, which forced the established utility companie=
s to carry Enron's electricity sales on their wires.=20
At the same time, Wendy Gramm, who served under the elder Bush as chair of =
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, allowed for an exemption in the t=
rading of energy derivatives, which, as the Washington Post reported, "late=
r became Enron's most lucrative business."=20
Once that was accomplished, Gramm, wife of Texas GOP Sen. Phil Gramm, resig=
ned from her government post to take a position on the Enron board. As one =
of the members of the board's audit committee, she now is expected to be a =
key figure in the lawsuits and federal investigation revolving around Enron=
's collapse. Recently, the chief executive of Arthur Andersen, Enron's outs=
ide auditor, told a congressional committee that the accounting firm had wa=
rned the Enron audit committee of what he termed "possible illegal acts wit=
hin the company."=20
Wendy Gramm is also mentioned in a bank lawsuit alleging insider trading as=
 having sold $276,912 in Enron stock in November 1998. Her response is that=
 she sold the stock to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest, give=
n that her husband was chairman of the Senate Banking Committee.=20
Yet she was still very much on the Enron board and being rewarded with futu=
re stock options when her husband last year pushed through legislation that=
 exempted key elements of Enron's energy business from oversight by the fed=
eral government. Phil Gramm had obtained $97,350 in political contributions=
 from Enron over the years, so perhaps he was acting on his own instincts a=
nd not his wife's urgings. The exemption was passed over the objection of t=
he Clinton administration.=20
Wendy Gramm also directs the regulatory studies program at George Mason Uni=
versity, which has received $50,000 from Enron since 1996. Her academic ins=
titute is highly influential in arguing for deregulation, conveniently join=
ing her corporate and academic interests.=20
Unfortunately for true-believer deregulators, the Enron collapse shreds the=
ir panacea. Surely no one, least of all Wendy Gramm, who has said she was k=
ept unaware of the company's chicanery in hiding debt and conducting secret=
 private deals to the detriment of stockholders, could argue today with a s=
traight face that Enron was in need of less government oversight.=20
The fact is that there would be no Enron as we know it were it not for Repu=
blican-engineered changes in government regulation that permitted Enron its=
 meteoric growth.=20
It's true that the corporation had its allies among the Democrats; campaign=
 finance corruption and influence peddling are generally a cover-all-your-b=
ets bipartisan activity. But in this case, the amounts given to Democrats w=
ere puny and late, and there's no doubt that Enron rode to power primarily =
on the strength of Lay's influence with the Bush family. This fact is not m=
itigated by Enron now hiring Clinton's former lawyer and various top Democr=
atic lobbying groups, except to note that these hired guns have no shame.=
=20
The Bush family ties to Kenny Boy Lay are just too intimate and lucrative t=
o ignore.=20
There also are at least four Enron consultants and executives who hold high=
 positions within the Bush White House, and some of them may be drawn into =
the investigations that cannot be avoided, despite the distractions of the =
war on terror.=20
As John Dean once famously said of the Nixon administration, there is a can=
cer growing on the presidency, but in this case it's name is Enron, and it =
won't go away by being ignored.

Tough Sell?
Is it tough for struggling companies to recruit new board members?=20
Lucent Technologies Inc. didn't bother to fill Paul O'Neill's seat when he =
became U.S. Treasury secretary last year. The Murray Hill, N.J., telecom-ge=
ar maker figured it would be a challenge to recruit someone during the heig=
ht of its troubles, according to an individual close to the situation. Luce=
nt has been hit hard by the continuing slowdown throughout the telecommunic=
ations industry.=20
The company is just trying to keep the board intact until it names a chief =
executive, a Lucent spokesman says.=20
But Enron Corp., the collapsed Houston energy giant, named two new outside =
directors after its travails became public. "I don't know if I could assign=
 any degree of difficulty," says Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman. "We were =
just looking for people who have had experience with these matters and we f=
ound two perfect candidates."=20
Though Enron subsequently filed for bankruptcy protection, its new board me=
mbers don't have to worry about liability for shareholder suits, says Melan=
ie Cohen, a bankruptcy attorney at Altheimer Gray, a Chicago law firm. "The=
y can't be liable for something that occurred before they got there."=20
One new Enron director, University of Texas Law School Dean William Powers,=
 says it took him only "two or three days" to decide to join its board. The=
 delay was "more of an issue of time and making sure it was compatible with=
 my duties here" rather than doubts about serving on the company's board, h=
e adds.=20
Raymond Troubh, a New York financial consultant and Enron's other board new=
comer, says he is looking forward to his directorship because "board servic=
e of troubled companies is quite fascinating."=20

Deeper Connection=20

One woman wants to take networking to a whole new level.=20
Melissa Giovagnoli, president of Networlding, a Chicago consulting firm, ha=
s developed an unusual concept called "networlding." She helps people make =
"targeted connections" with others who have similar personal values so they=
 can build a safety net that will last longer than a job-transition period.=
=20
"Traditional networking becomes ineffective because you keep running throug=
h people," she says. "But if you form a connection with someone based on co=
mplimentary values, the exchange can be much more dynamic."=20
Since March, Ms. Giovagnoli has started 25 networlding "circles" in Chicago=
, with 10 people in each circle. She plans to start others soon in Washingt=
on, Indianapolis and California's Silicon Valley. Circle members pay $125 a=
piece for a year of participation. The fee enables participants to connect =
with members of other circles both in person and through e-mail.=20
Ms. Giovagnoli also intends to create formal networlding circles within com=
panies, including Motorola Inc. The Schaumburg, Ill., technology-and-equipm=
ent giant has hired her to teach staffers how to network. She intends to im=
plement a circle there this month. An informal Motorola circle already has =
brought together employees who wouldn't otherwise know each other, says Ves=
na Arsic, a corporate-marketing-strategy director.=20
Ms. Arsic says this circle has helped her. "Motorola is in a precarious fin=
ancial state, but I have less anxiety because I know there are lots of peop=
le I can call if I have to," she says.=20

Fewer Options=20

The average number of stock options awarded to chief executives plummeted 7=
6% in 2001. So concludes a new study of 50 Fortune 1000 companies whose fis=
cal years ended during the second or third quarter of 2001. The study was c=
onducted by Executive Compensation Advisory Services, a research firm in Al=
exandria, Va.=20
CEOs' options awards dropped from an average of 1,396,006 in 2000 to 335,01=
3 options a year later, the study found. This plunge occurred despite the f=
act that 25 companies increased the number of options granted their leader =
compared with the prior year.=20
On average, the 50 companies awarded their CEOs 8.4% of all options given t=

Case Summary
Dynegy's Reasons for Terminating Merger Were "Mere Pretexts," Says Enron

01/02/2002
Securities Litigation & Regulation Reporter
Copyright (c) 2002 Andrews Publications. All rights reserved.

In adversary proceedings filed with the bankruptcy court, Enron Corp. accus=
es Dynegy of pulling out of the merger between the energy trading giants so=
 it could ensure Enron's fall and slash competition in the industry. Enron =
also says the alleged material adverse effects used to break the agreement =
were "mere pretexts" used by Dynegy to gain control of a valuable pipeline.=
 In re Enron Corp. et al., No. 01-3626, complaint filed (S.D.N.Y., 02-DEC-0=
1).=20
According to the complaint, Dynegy agreed to the merger with its "eyes wide=
 open" and "with full knowledge of Enron's well-publicized financial crises=
 after conducting two weeks of extensive due diligence."
Enron's ability to preserve its energy trading business and avoid bankruptc=
y protection was dependent on the deal going through, it adds, and Dynegy a=
llegedly understood that credit rating agencies - such as Moody's, Standard=
 & Poor's, and Fitch - only agreed to keep the ratings at above investment-=
grade level based on Dynegy's assurances that the merger would be completed=
.=20
Dynegy is claiming that Enron failed to disclose the acceleration of a debt=
 with respect to a $691 million note that was triggered by a ratings downgr=
ade. Enron counters that the repayment obligation occurred after the merger=
 agreement was executed, and that the downgrade was specifically excluded a=
s a material adverse event under the contract.=20
Due to Enron's liquidity problems, Dynegy invested $1.5 billion in equity w=
hen the agreement was signed in the form of preferred stock in the Enron su=
bsidiary that owns Northern Natural Gas Pipeline.=20
The preferred stock carries the right to acquire all of the ownership inter=
ests under certain circumstances including if Dynegy rightfully terminated =
the merger agreement. However, Enron says Dynegy had no right to pull out o=
f the deal and that it is not entitled to purchase more stock in the compan=
y that holds Northern Natural. Dynegy has also filed its own breach of cont=
ract suit in Texas state court seeking to secure control over the entity.=
=20
Enron's problems started when it released its financial results for the thi=
rd quarter in October and announced a non-recurring charge totally $1.01 bi=
llion (after taxes). In connection with the early termination of certain fi=
nancial arrangement, the energy giant also told its shareholders that their=
 equity had been reduced by about $1.2 billion.=20
Shortly thereafter, the board formed a special audit committee to investiga=
te the company's accounting and the Securities and Exchange Commission bega=
n its investigation.=20
In early November, Enron announced that its financial statements for 1997 t=
hrough 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001 would have to be =
restated with an aggregate total reduction in net income of about $600 mill=
ion.=20
The merger agreement was signed on Nov. 9, 2001, and valued Enron stock at =
$10.41 per share. However, the share price continued to decline because Dyn=
egy repeatedly told the press that it had a "due diligence out," says Enron=
, contrary to the agreement and in bad faith, as Dynegy knew that the bad p=
ublicity would only hurt Enron's already precarious financial state.=20
Dynegy undermined the safety net that the merger was supposed to provide fo=
r Enron and should pay for the damages it caused, the plaintiff said. Enron=
 lost an enormous amount of credibility with the credit rating agencies due=
 to Dynegy's refusal to support that agreement and contributed to the downg=
rade that caused the acceleration on the note, the now-bankrupt company say=
s.=20
Enron is seeking no less than $10 billion in damages from Dynegy as well as=
 a declaration that it breached the merger agreement and has no right to ex=
ercise an option to purchase interests in Northern Natural Gas Pipeline.=20
Enron is represented by Martin Bienenstock, Greg Danilow and Brian Rosen of=
 Weil, Gotshal & Manges in New York.

Case Summary
Shareholders Claim Enron Directors Made $434 Million in Insider Trading

01/02/2002
Securities Litigation & Regulation Reporter
Copyright (c) 2002 Andrews Publications. All rights reserved.

Enron Corp.'s 10 most senior officers and directors conspired to inflate th=
e energy and communications conglomerate's net worth and then took advantag=
e of the false valuation to sell 7.3 million shares of their Enron stock fo=
r proceeds of $434 million, according to a shareholders' suit filed in mid-=
November, just weeks before the company filed for bankruptcy. Abrams et al.=
 v. Enron Corp. et al., No. H-01-3630 (S.D. Tex., 13-NOV-01).=20
Shareholders Seth Abrams and Steven Frank filed a class action suit in U.S.=
 District Court for the Southern District of Texas against the corporation,=
 the 10 officers and directors, and the Arthur Andersen international accou=
nting and consulting firm. Arthur Andersen's Houston office received $25 mi=
llion in auditing fees and $27 million in consulting work to cover up Enron=
's financial improprieties between 1997 and 2001, according to the to suit.
The individual defendants, who are each accused of insider trading, are:=20
Kenneth L. Lay, chairman of Enron's board of directors and chief executive =
officer from 1986 until February 2001, who allegedly sold 1.8 million share=
s of his Enron stock for proceeds of $99.9 million and who also received $1=
4 million in bonuses for 1998, 1999 and 2000;=20
Jeffrey K. Skilling, the company's president and chief operating officer un=
til February 2001 when he became chief executive officer, who sold 1.1 mill=
ion shares of his Enron stock for proceeds of $68.2 million and who also re=
ceived more than $10 million in bonuses for 1998 to 2000;=20
Andrew S. Fastow, chief financial officer of the company from 1998 until he=
 was fired in October 2001, who sold 561,000 shares of Enron stock for proc=
eeds of $30.4 million;=20
Richard A. Causey, executive vice president and chief accounting officer of=
 the company, who sold 197,000 shares of Enron stock for proceeds of $13.3 =
million;=20
James E. Derrick Jr., executive vice president and general counsel of the c=
ompany since July 1999, who sold 230,000 shares of company stock for procee=
ds of $12.6 million;=20
J. Clifford Baxter, vice chairman of the company since October 2000 and chi=
ef strategy officer since June 2000, who sold 577,000 shares of Enron stock=
 for proceeds of $35.2 million;=20
Mark A. Frevert, chairman and chief executive officer of Enron Wholesale Se=
rvices since June 2000 and chairman and chief executive officer of Enron Eu=
rope from March 1997 to June 2000, who sold 830,000 shares of Enron stock f=
or proceeds of $50.2 million and who also received bonus payments of $4.3 m=
illion from 1998 to 2000;=20
Stanley C. Horton, chairman and chief executive officer of Enron Transporta=
tion Services, who sold 738,000 shares of Enron stock for proceeds of $45.5=
 million and who also received $2.9 million in bonuses for 1998 to 2000;=20
Kenneth D. Rice, chairman and chief executive officer of Enron Broadband Se=
rvices since June 2000, who sold 1.2 million shares of Enron stock for proc=
eeds of $74.37 million and who also received bonus payments of $3.9 million=
 for 1998 to 2000; and=20
Richard G. Buy, executive vice president and chief risk officer of the comp=
any since July 1999, who sold 54,874 shares of company stock for $4.32 mill=
ion.=20
The complaint alleges that Causey, Lay, Skilling and Fastow signed false Fo=
rm 10-Ks and Form 10-Qs required by the Securities and Exchange Commission =
at various times during the class period of Oct. 19, 1998, to Nov. 7, 2001,=
 but that all 10 individual defendants conspired with guilty knowledge to c=
onvey false and misleading information through public filings, press releas=
es and other publications to inflate the company stock.=20
They all directly participated in the management of company, were directly =
involved in its day-to-day operations at the highest levels and were privy =
to confidential proprietary information concerning the company and its busi=
ness operations, the complaint said. As a result of their actions, Enron's =
stock price rose from $43.43 per share on Jan. 3, 2000, to $83.12 per share=
 by Dec. 29, 2000.=20
Financial analysts attributed the price rise to the growth and expectations=
 for Enron's Broadband Services Division but unbeknownst to investors, the =
division was experiencing declining demand and financial losses.=20
The defendants knowingly falsified Enron's financial statements by eliminat=
ing unprofitable and debt-ridden subsidiaries from the statements and they =
also lied about the success of the broadband efforts, causing Enron's asset=
s to be overstated in 2000 and 2001 by as much as $1 billion, the plaintiff=
s assert.=20
In particular, the plaintiffs allege that the individual defendants, with t=
he help of Arthur Andersen's accountants, kept the losses of its subsidiary=
 Joint Energy Development Investments off the books and improperly lent $13=
2 million to a second company, Chewco Investments, so it could purchase JED=
I stock for $383 million. (The acronym JEDI is a play on the name of the kn=
ights in the Star Wars movies while the name Chewco is a play on Chewbacca,=
 the name of one of the characters in those movies.)=20
Arthur Andersen falsely represented that Enron's financial statements for 1=
997, 1998, 1999 and 2000 were prepared and presented in accordance with gen=
erally accepted auditing practices and that the accounting company also con=
sented to the incorporation of its false statements in Enron's Form 10-Ks f=
or those years and in Enron's prospectuses for several securities offerings=
.=20
The financial house of cards came apart on Nov. 8, 2001, when the company a=
nnounced that it was restating its revenues for 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000 and =
the first two quarters of 2001 to correct for errors that inflated the comp=
any's net income by $591 million. Following that announcement, the price of=
 Enron's common stock fell from a high of $90.75 during the class period to=
 a low of $8.20 before closing on Nov. 8 at $8.41.=20
The plaintiffs allege violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchang=

Enron hid behind smoke and mirrors

Four years ago, Asia was lectured by the West on the deficiencies of its co=
rporate disclosure and accounting regimes.=20
Witnessing the US$60 billion bankruptcy of Enron last month, the region cou=
ld be forgiven a moment of schadenfreude.
Dubious accounting and disclosure practices were at the heart of Enron's de=
mise. Evidently, Asia does not have a monopoly in this area.=20
Texas-based Enron used to be a power firm, pumping gas and electricity to c=
ustomers in the United States and around the world. Then it transmogrified =
into a wholly more stylish animal, befitting the spirit of the trendy dotco=
m in the 1990s.=20
Real assets were no longer in vogue: the smartest companies, as the Interne=
t revolution demonstrated, made money out of thin air, through the power of=
 their intellect and creativity.=20
Enron became a purveyor of "energy services", making markets in everything =
from coal and lumber to bandwidth. The pipelines became incidental. The sto=
ck market applauded, and Enron's shares surged from US$20 to US$90 between =
1997 and 2000.=20
As its stock rose, Enron's financial statements became more complex until, =
it seemed, no one could work out how the company made money anymore.=20
Those seeking enlightenment were given short shrift by Enron's senior execu=
tives. Anyone with the temerity to ask just didn't "get it".=20
Analysts may have been similarly in the dark, but were not about to stand i=
n the way of a Wall Street darling that delivered the holy grail of smoothl=
y increasing earnings.=20
Meanwhile, auditors Arthur Andersen continued to sign off on financial stat=
ements that showed Enron to be a robust and fast-growing company - until it=
s collapse.=20
There are lessons in the Enron debacle that reach beyond the US.=20
Asian investors swept up in the early 1990s by the story of the region's in=
evitable ascendancy will recognise the mixture of hype and hubris that kept=
 observers from asking the difficult questions and Enron from answering the=
m.=20
The Asian financial crisis exposed structural weaknesses that caused system=
ic collapses. By contrast, the fallout from Enron's bankruptcy, while painf=
ul to some (particularly employees who had their pensions invested in the c=
ompany's stock), will be far more limited.=20
The most far-reaching impact is likely to be felt by the auditing professio=
n. Faith in the integrity of financial statements has been shaken, as admit=
ted by Andersen chief executive Joseph Berardino.=20
That phenomenon is global. Showing up the deficiencies of balance sheets in=
 Indonesia or Thailand is one thing. But when a giant multinational in supp=
osedly the world's best-regulated market produces financial statements that=
 patently were not worth the paper they were written on, users are entitled=
 to ask: who can we trust?=20
Still, if the morals of the Enron case are heeded, it will have served a us=
eful purpose.=20
First, if a company's accounts are too complex to understand, maybe that is=
 because the company has something to hide, rather than reflecting a defici=
ency of intelligence on the part of investors.=20
Second, if senior executives treat requests for clarification with disdainf=
ul arrogance, perhaps that is because they have something to hide, rather t=
han the questions being foolish.=20
Third, no rules are perfect. While Andersen's role in Enron is the subject =
of debate, a company determined to bend accounting rules in its favour will=
 always find a way to do so. But, as the collapse shows, the truth will out=
 eventually, which leads to Moral No 4: if something looks too good to be t=
rue, it is. Investors believed in Enron's magic dust because they wanted to=
.=20
Scepticism is invariably the first casualty of bull markets. Investors disc=
ard it at their peril.=20

The POWER of CHOICE / It is the dawning of deregulation in Texas, allowing =
consumers to choose their electricity provider - and get a rate reduction a=
s well.
NELSON ANTOSH

Starting today, deregulation of electricity officially arrives in Texas.=20
For the first time, consumers in much of the state can chose their electric=
ity provider. And regardless of whether the customers switch or not, they w=
ill get a rate reduction as of today.
The combination of a 6 percent cut in the base rate for power - as required=
 by state law - plus the impact of lower fuel costs for generating will bri=
ng the total reduction for residential customers in the Houston area to abo=
ut 17 percent.=20
Deregulation of electricity is ready to move onto a mass scale after seven =
years in the planning and seven months of testing, said Terri Waggoner, spo=
keswoman for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, also known as Ercot=
.=20
"All systems are go," adds Brett Perlman, a commissioner on the Public Util=
ity Commission of Texas.=20
But don't expect the promotion floodgates to open today, said Janee Briesem=
eister, senior policy analyst for Consumers Union in Austin.=20
The telephone calls, mailers and television ads will build up gradually. Th=
at's the way it happened in other states. Switching on a broad scale could =
take as long as three years.=20
No customer is forced to do anything. "If all goes well, they shouldn't not=
ice anything different with their service," Briesemeister said.=20
For instance, a customer of Reliant Energy HL&P who decides to do nothing w=
ill automatically become a customer of a competitive supplier known as Reli=
ant Energy Residential Services.=20
Since midsummer, a limited number of residential customers, about 115,000 i=
n the state, have been part of a pilot program to shake out the bugs in the=
 system.=20
Now that deregulation is officially here, an estimated 4.7 million househol=
ds in the state are eligible to participate. As of Dec. 17, nearly 20,000 h=
ad signed up and were waiting for deregulation to arrive before they switch=
 over, according to officials.=20
A sizable chunk of Texas is outside the program. Municipal power sysems, su=
ch as those in Austin and San Antonio, and rural electric cooperatives are =
taking a wait-and-see attitude before deciding if they wll opt in to compet=
ition.=20
The nearest parallel is deregulation of long-distance telephone service.=20
However there is one important difference - the rules are designed to avoid=
 one of the big annoyances of telephone competion, unauthorized switches, b=
etter known as slamming, said Terry Hadley, public information officer for =
the PUC.=20
You will get a postcard in the mail asking if you did, indeed, decide to sw=
itch before anything is done.=20
In Houston, at least 10 companies will be making their sales pitches to res=
idential customers. The number is even larger when you include companies ta=
rgeting commercial and industrial users who use more power.=20
Although there will be a rate decrease for all customers involved in deregu=
lation, it might not show up until the second bill of this year because of =
meter reading cycles, Briesemeister said.=20
Similarly, the time it takes to switch from one company to another could be=
 as long as 45 days because of meter reading cycles.=20
One of the things to watch out for is late payment fees, of up to 5 percent=
. Until now these charges were not permitted for investor- owned power comp=
anies involving residential accounts.=20
Customers also need to be aware of cancellation fees that may be a part of =
contracts, she said.=20
The state's job in this process is to inform electricity customers about su=
ch things as electricity facts labels, which like the label on a can of bea=
ns, allows an apples-to-apples comparison of costs between companies.=20
People already know quite a lot about deregulation, said the PUC's Perlman.=
 He routinely asks people in the grocery store, who say they are aware of d=
eregulation and have placed it "on their list of things to do."=20
There were some glitches in the pilot program, but it was intended as a lea=
rning experience, Perlman said.=20
The measure of success is lower costs, which means that deregulation is alr=
eady working, said Ercot President and Chief Executive Tom Noel.=20
Cities ranging in size from Houston and Dallas to Corpus Christi will parti=
cipate in electric deregulation.=20
There already have been some disappointments.=20
Shell, for instance, was an early player and one of the most aggressive but=
 decided it didn't want to be in the electric retail business. The number o=
f customers involved in the pilot could have been larger by another 100,000=
 or so if Shell hadn't pulled out, Noel said.=20
Any fears about reliability of service are laid to rest by the state's deci=
ding to keep the distribution system - the lines and poles - regulated, acc=
ording to Hadley.=20
Texas planners say they will avoid the fiasco of California where the whole=
sale electric sales was deregulated but retail prices were capped. When the=
 cost of power surged because there weren't enough electric plants to keep =
up with demand, electric companies were not allowed to pass on all those co=
st increases to consumers.=20

Investing/Word On The Street
Enron: The Lessons For Investors; Hindsight, shmindsight. There's much to l=
earn when a stock loses $67 billion in value.
Lisa Gibbs, Jeff Nash and Nick Pachetti

(Copyright 2002)

It seems hard to believe now, but Enron (ENE) used to be the envy of corpor=
ate America. In less than a decade, the Houston company transformed itself =
from stodgy gas-pipeline operation to natural gas and electricity trading p=
owerhouse. Dazzled by sizzling earnings growth, giddy investors bid up Enro=
n's shares 312% in two years to a high of $90.75 in 2000. Then someone turn=
ed out the lights. Beset by marketplace woes and management mishaps, the st=
ock already had tumbled 53% when chief executive Jeffrey Skilling stunned i=
nvestors by resigning last August. After that, the bad news came at hypersp=
eed: $1.2 billion in shareholder equity zapped by risky hedging deals, a Se=
curities and Exchange Commission probe, a last- chance merger with rival Dy=
negy called off and, finally, a bankruptcy filing. By the end of November, =
the stock had plummeted to 26[cents], obliterating $67 billion in market ca=
p--a shocking fall for a company that just last year occupied the No. 7 spo=
t on the Fortune 500.=20
Perhaps most incredible, however, about the Enron debacle is how long inves=
tors hung on to the belief that everything would turn out fine. As recently=
 as MONEY's October issue, our Ultimate Investment Club's Abby Joseph Cohen=
 of Goldman Sachs was calling Enron a "good value." If pros like Cohen got =
it wrong, how could the average investor have discerned the disaster in tim=
e? Sure, hindsight is marvelous. But along Enron's fast track to penny stoc=
k, there were red flags for informed shareholders that all was not as it se=
emed.
Out-of-control valuation. In 2000, investors levitated Enron's stock to a l=
ofty price/earnings ratio of 69 times that year's earnings on the belief th=
at forays into sexy-sounding online energy trading and broadband businesses=
 could sustain supercharged earnings growth. Skilling was telling Wall Stre=
et that Enron's broadband biz alone deserved $37 a share, and investors see=
med to buy it, despite the fact that the unit was unproved and unprofitable=
. His outlandish valuation of broadband drew an early "hold" rating from an=
alyst Andre Meade of Commerzbank Securities in March 2000. "An energy compa=
ny trading at the multiple Enron was," Meade explains today, "should have b=
een cause for eyebrows to be raised."=20
The lesson? Pay attention to the P/E even after you buy a stock. Whenever t=
he valuation starts to climb, you should stop and question whether the comp=
any can sustain the sales and earnings growth expected of it.=20
Insider selling. In 2000, then CEO Kenneth Lay netted $66.3 million from ex=
ercising stock options and selling the shares, while Skilling scored $60.7 =
million, roughly double the amounts the year before. By the end of June 200=
1, 16 members of Enron's top management had sold $164 million in shares, re=
ports Thomson Financial Network. While insider sales don't automatically sp=
ell trouble for a company-- executives often have valid reasons for raising=
 cash--the selling at Enron was prolific. And the fact that selling persist=
ed even as the stock fell throughout 2001 was a "screaming red flag," says =
Thomson analyst Paul Elliott. If Skilling and Lay believed the stock was un=
dervalued--as they repeatedly told investors--then why were they cashing in=
? Executive stock trades are easy for ordinary investors to follow: The Wal=
l Street Journal regularly publishes insider trading tables, and websites s=
uch as Yahoo Finance (finance.yahoo.com) list insider trades for each stock=
.=20
Obfuscations. Enron's trading business is extremely complex, and analysts a=
dmit they didn't always understand what Enron was doing. That said, the com=
pany seemed to go out of its way to obfuscate. "I've never seen such compli=
cated disclosures," says Michael Heim, an A.G. Edwards energy analyst. "It =
was hard to follow the movement of money."=20
When pushed to reveal more, management was often tight-lipped and unprofess=
ional. During one famous conference call last April, Skilling called an ana=
lyst an "asshole" for complaining about the company's failure to provide a =
balance sheet with its earnings announcement. Prudential Securities' Carol =
Coale points to rumors in late September of an SEC investigation. "When I a=
sked Enron about an investigation, they said there was no investigation," s=
ays Coale. Once it was revealed that the SEC was conducting an inquiry, she=
 says Enron returned to her with a feeble excuse: "They said, 'Well, you di=
dn't ask about an inquiry.'"=20
The typical investor isn't privy to such conversations, although more and m=
ore company conference calls are in fact being opened to the general public=
. But the larger point (famously stated by Warren Buffett) is this: If you =
don't understand what a company does, don't invest in it. There's a corolla=
ry to that too: If management refuses to fill in holes and keeps investors =
in the dark, run.=20
Fishy filings. Investors who read Enron's quarterly SEC filing in the summe=
r of 1999 would have noticed a new entry under the heading "Related Party T=
ransactions." The item noted that Enron was doing business with a private p=
artnership whose general partner was led by a "senior officer of Enron." A =
proxy filed in May 2000 revealed that the senior officer was Enron CFO Andr=
ew Fastow, and that not one but two partnerships existed.=20
Possible conflicts of interest--is the CFO looking out for Enron or himself=
?--should have turned heads. But even professional money managers like thos=
e at Janus, enthralled by Enron's opportunities, overlooked the partnership=
s as the funds built up their stakes. As late as Sept. 28, with Enron at $2=
7.25, Janus owned 41.3 million shares, which it has since dumped.=20
To be fair, Enron revealed little about the partnerships and their function=
--to divert from Enron's balance sheet the debt from new acquisitions--as w=
ell as the extent to which the companies were in bed together. Besides, bac=
k then the stock was going gangbusters and earnings looked great; the partn=
erships seemed like small potatoes. Even the stock's few critics weren't pa=
ying much attention. Recalls Meade of Commerzbank: "It was difficult to see=
 that there were significant liabilities associated with this."=20
Attitudes began changing after Enron filed its first quarterly report of 20=
01, which said it was entering into complicated and risky derivatives trans=
actions that involved an $827 million loan to one of the partnerships. Whoa=
, some analysts said. "You started to see in the footnotes some pretty larg=
e sums of money," says Tara Gately, energy analyst for Loomis Sayles funds.=
 "It raised questions, and there were really no good answers."=20
Yes, this is complicated stuff and, yes, there wasn't enough information, b=
ut you don't have to be a big-deal financial analyst to know that the CFO i=
n a side business is smelly stuff.=20
Executive departures. When the chief executive--someone who spent a decade =
moving up the ladder and building the company's core energy- trading busine=
ss--flees after just six months at the helm, you've got a problem. Skilling=
, 47 at the time, called it a "purely personal" decision. "That was the wor=
st excuse I've ever heard," scoffs John Hammerschmidt, a fund manager at Tu=
rner Investments. If top management resigns for unclear reasons, consider s=
elling. Hammerschmidt didn't even hesitate in this case: "As soon as I hear=
d that, I dumped my shares."=20
One red flag does not necessarily a disaster make. More often it's a succes=
sion of little somethings that ultimately tells you: It could get real ugly=
 here. The trick is to put aside your enthusiasm for a stock. That's probab=
ly the hardest thing for any investor to do. But as Enron's meltdown shows,=
 the homework isn't over once you buy the stock.=20

Sure sounds to me that Ken is in the same shoes as the rest of us regarding the downfall of ENE.  
What do you think????????????????????????
Wouldn't you think the honorable thing would be to refuse any compensation knowing your terrible performance? 
I'm sorry! I forgot honorable is not an Enron admirable trait!

The wording of "If he terminates his employment within 60 days of a change of control" sure sounds to me like someone knew what was going on to me?
I guess we should have kept in mind the 2nd definition of LAY in the dictionary is "To put to rest"

 DJ Enron CEO -2: Also To Get Reimbursed For Tax Penalties --

  WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--Enron Corp. (ENE) Chief Executive Kenneth Lay could
receive a lump sum payment as much as $80 million as a result of Dynegy Inc.'s
(DYN) plan to acquire Enron, according to a regulatory filing released Tuesday
by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
  Under Lay's employment agreement, which originally extended through Dec. 31,
2003, Lay was entitled to a lump sum payment equal to the number of full
calendar years remaining under his contract multiplied by $20.2 million if he
terminated his employment within 60 days of a change of control. 
  In August, Lay, chairman of Enron, resumed his position as CEO following the
resignation of Jeffrey K. Skilling, Enron's then-president and CEO. At that
time, his contract was extended to Dec. 31, 2005. 
  In addition to the lump sum payment, Lay is entitled to an amount for any
related tax penalties if the payment were held to constitute an "excess
parachute payment," according to the filing. 
  Dynegy plans to acquire Enron in a stock swap valued around $10.12 billion. 
  The deal is expected to close sometime next year, in which case Lay is
entitled to $60.6 million under his contract if he terminates his employment
within the 60 days. 
  Houston-based Enron is a utilities and communications company. -Dan Lowrey;

Good Morning! 
Bottom line: No Changes - Overall US conditions will return to a more normal late fall/early winter pattern (no Arctic air) over the next 2 days. This pattern will persist through the end of the month. 
For the near term (1-5): Bottom Line - Cooler weather will bring temperatures below normal from the beginning through the middle of the week in the Midwest and from the middle through the end of the week in the East and South. The below normal event will last 3 to 4 days before normal temperatures return. The Rockies and West will be normal to above normal with cooling by the end of the week.
Details: We see some cool anomalies arriving into the Midwest tomorrow, with temperatures in Chicago reaching highs late tonight and the mercury falling through the day tomorrow. By Tuesday, the South and Texas will be in the below normal category, with Dallas overnights in the mid-30s (normal low 43), Houston's low 40s (normal upper-40s) and Chicago will freeze, with a mid-20 overnight. Progressing into the Northeast by wednesday, Philly and New York will get into the below normal category, but 5 or 6 degree anomalies are most likely. Looks like a three day event as it moves easterly and then is followed by moderation.
6-10 Day Bottom Line: Variable conditions continue with a stormy pattern entrenched over much of the nation. Overall temperatures will be normal to cool with very wet conditions. NO strong Arctic air is expected.
Details: A strong storm will push into the West late next week and next weekend bringing heavy rain and snow and temperatures near to below normal. At the same time - the Midwest will warm toward normal with wet conditions developing. By early in the last week of November the strong western storm will push into the central U.S. bringing widespread rain and snow. Behind the system another surge of below normal temperatures will track from the Midwest to the South to the East.
11-15 Day a generally cool and wet weather pattern will persist over much of the nation. While NO Arctic air is clear on the horizon - temperatures on a national average will be cooler than normal and there will be an increased threat for rain and snow. 
So, with normals dropping across the nation, this first cool air anomaly event arriving in the Midwest by Tuesday will elevate the nation's gas demand requirements into the 60 Bcf/d plus regime from here on through the winter. Here's the strip beginning with today:

Accounting for Enron: Obstruction Charges Likely to Be First Step in Enron =
Criminal Case

01/28/2002
The Wall Street Journal

WASHINGTON -- Federal prosecutors likely would file obstruction-of-justice =
charges first in any criminal case arising from the collapse of Enron Corp.=
, as they look to build a broader indictment based on possible securities f=
raud, insider trading and tax fraud, lawyers close to the case said.=20
Obstruction charges, including any allegations of deliberate destruction of=
 evidence, could come as soon as this summer and likely would be filed in f=
ederal court in Houston, these lawyers said. Such initial criminal charges =
could provide prosecutors with powerful leverage against defendants whose c=
ooperation might then be sought to pursue any inquiry into any underlying c=
rimes, these people said.
Enron's spectacular collapse last month triggered more than a dozen civil, =
criminal and congressional investigations and already has had significant p=
olitical repercussions. But for officers and executives of the Houston-base=
d energy-trading company and its former auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, the s=
takes are highest in the Justice Department's wide-ranging criminal investi=
gation.=20
One crucial factor for these men and women could be the dates that any alle=
ged obstruction and fraud occurred. Penalties for most federal white-collar=
 crimes were stiffened Nov. 1, in some cases nearly doubling prison sentenc=
es and fines.=20
A senior Justice Department official refused Friday to discuss possible cha=
rges or other details of the case, except to confirm that it could unfold r=
elatively quickly. Others close to the case cautioned, though, that with in=
vestigators still grappling to determine just what happened, few firm decis=
ions have been made about legal tactics or where initial charges should be =
filed.=20
An attorney for Enron said discussion of criminal charges against the compa=
ny is premature. The company has been cooperating with federal investigator=
s looking into document shredding by its employees, and a report by a speci=
al committee of Enron's board looking into the debacle is expected out soon=
, possibly this week.=20
"I think it is grossly unfair to draw any conclusions at this early stage. =
There is no evidence at all, at least on the part of Enron, that any shredd=
ing of documents was criminal in any way. I think before anybody rushes to =
judgment, they should see what the FBI concludes," said Robert Bennett, an =
Enron attorney here.=20
"This board of directors is trying very hard to reorganize this company, an=
d bring it out of bankruptcy so stakeholders can get paid back and so 20,00=
0 employees can keep their jobs," he added.=20
In any event, prosecutors face enormous hurdles. Complex white-collar crime=
 cases can take months, if not years, to untangle, and figuring out what oc=
curred at Enron -- with its hundreds of offshore companies and affiliates a=
llegedly set up to sweep debt from Enron's books and juggle tax liabilities=
 -- could prove especially difficult. At the same time, proving criminal in=
tent in such cases can be tough, and often must be established with circums=
tantial evidence; what's more, defendants in such cases sometimes argue tha=
t they reasonably relied on the advice of lawyers in their actions and deci=
sions, which can make it difficult to establish criminal intent.=20
Auditors and lawyers in such cases rarely face prosecution. But Arthur Ande=
rsen and Vinson & Elkins, Enron's longtime legal counsel, have been sharply=
 criticized for failing to probe more deeply into concerns about possible f=
raud. Arthur Andersen or its employees, in particular, could be liable if t=
hey knowingly destroyed evidence. A Vinson & Elkins spokesman said the firm=
's work for Enron met "the highest professional and ethical standards." An =
Arthur Andersen spokesman said the firm is cooperating in the probe, and no=
ted that it had volunteered information to investigators about the destruct=
ion of documents. "We are not speculating on outcomes," the spokesman said.=
 "We are focused on helping them to do their jobs."=20
While the investigations are still in their infancy, with new and startling=
 facts emerging almost daily, some defense lawyers and former prosecutors s=
ay they wouldn't be surprised if the Justice Department brought initial cri=
minal charges as soon as the summer.=20
The government's roadmap in such cases often includes early charges of obst=
ruction for making false statements or destroying evidence. Obstruction cha=
rges are relatively straightforward; prosecutors don't have to prove a defe=
ndant was involved in any underlying crime, only that he or she lied, destr=
oyed evidence or otherwise hindered prosecutors. And such defendants -- who=
 can face prison time -- often end up being valuable witnesses in guiding i=
nvestigators through the morass as they attempt to build a broader case.=20
"The government loves the obstruction angle," said James Volling, head of t=
he business-litigation group at Minneapolis's Faegre & Benson law firm. "It=
 doesn't come with all the baggage that securities claims often do. It is p=
retty easy to establish the facts. That is something they clearly will purs=
ue."=20
Beyond initial obstruction charges in the Enron matter, "there is a smorgas=
bord of potential criminal charges," said Henry Hockeimer, a Philadelphia d=
efense lawyer and former federal prosecutor. Already, shareholders have fil=
ed civil suits alleging that Enron officers violated securities laws by not=
 disclosing material information about circuitous, off-balance-sheet partne=
rship arrangements. They also have alleged that company officers sold more =
than $1 billion of Enron stock using inside information that should have be=
en disclosed to the public.=20
The same allegations could form the basis of criminal securities-fraud and =
insider-trading charges if the government thinks it can prove the officers =
acted while knowing what they were doing was wrong, or were warned and went=
 ahead anyway. Other possible claims include mail and wire fraud, and even =
violations of the federal bank-fraud statute, if Enron or its officers kept=
 material information from its lenders.=20
The timing of specific acts could be an issue if charges are proven in cour=
t because sentencing guidelines on hundreds of white-collar crimes got more=
 severe Nov. 1. For example, the maximum penalty for the basic crime of ins=
ider trading or fraud in excess of $1 million has nearly doubled, from 37 m=
onths in prison to 63 months. Enron is the first major white-collar crime i=
nvestigation since the new guidelines became effective.=20
According to federal sentencing commission statistics, about 10,000 people =
were sentenced to federal prison for financial crimes in 2000. If the new g=
uidelines had been in place, a third of them would have received more priso=
n time and those sentences would have been an average of 40% longer.=20

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: EARLY SCRUTINY
10 Months Ago, Questions on Enron Came and Went With Little Notice
By FELICITY BARRINGER

01/28/2002
The New York Times
Page 11, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

A paramount virtue in journalism is being the first to reveal startling fac=
ts. Editors notice. Colleagues notice. Competitors notice.=20
Except when they do not.
Ten months ago, Bethany McLean of Fortune magazine became the first journal=
ist to highlight hard questions about Enron's balance sheet. The most start=
ling fact she revealed was the absence of crucial information in the compan=
y's financial reports. ''How exactly does Enron make its money?'' she wrote=
.=20
Her questions were so pointed that Enron's chief executive, Jeffrey K. Skil=
ling, called her unethical for failing to do more research. Three Enron exe=
cutives flew to New York in an unsuccessful effort to convince her editors =
that she was wrongheaded. Enron's chairman, Kenneth L. Lay, called Fortune'=
s managing editor, Rik Kirkland, to complain that Fortune was relying on a =
source who stood to profit if the share price fell.=20
The lobbying by Enron had no effect on what Fortune published, highlighted =
on its cover with the headline, ''Is Enron Overpriced?'' Then inertia did w=
hat corporate pressure could not do -- it buried the article. Only TheStree=
t.com picked it up and peppered Enron with critical reporting.=20
Even Ms. McLean left leads that were not pursued. She knew, she said, that =
Enron's chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, was a principal in two p=
artnerships alluded to in the financial statements. But she left it out of =
her article.=20
''I knew it was weird, but the accountants had signed off on it,'' she said=
. If the accountants, Arthur Andersen, and Enron's board had not questioned=
 it, she reasoned, why should she? Not until October did The Wall Street Jo=
urnal link Mr. Fastow's partnerships to Enron's write-off of $1.2 billion i=
n shareholder equity.=20
As Mr. Kirkland said, Ms. McLean's report ''was prescient, but it kind of w=
ent out and sank.''=20
''We didn't have the goods, as it were,'' Mr. Kirkland said. Only last fall=
, when Enron began to collapse, did more reporters pay attention to the art=
icle and to its author. Ms. McLean herself has returned to reporting on Enr=
on.=20
Ms. McLean, who is 31, is now the financial reporter everyone loves to lion=
ize. Her photogenic smile and the analytical ability honed at Goldman, Sach=
s have won her appearances on PBS's ''NewsHour With Jim Lehrer,'' CNN's ''G=
reenfield at Large'' with Jeff Greenfield, and two NBC News shows. NBC, For=
tune executives said, has offered her a consulting contract.=20
The arc of Ms. McLean's experience with Enron illustrates the dynamics of f=
inancial journalism, which tends to be sucked into the gravitational pull o=
f the stock markets. Companies with highflying stocks tend to get positive =
coverage; those whose stocks slide tend to provoke critical assessments.=20
Other magazines like Business Week and even Fortune had written glowing acc=
ounts of Enron's transformative effect on energy markets, and the trajector=
y of its stock price, which rose about 50 percent in 1999 and about 90 perc=
ent in 2000. As Ms. McLean was working on her article, in the midst of the =
California power crisis, Business Week published a cover article entitled: =
''Enron, the nation's largest energy merchant, won't let California stand i=
n its way.''=20
But as the share price rose, Enron's financial reports stayed opaque. One w=
ould almost have to have written them to understand them. And few financial=
 reporters have written corporate financial reports.=20
Ms. McLean is part of that small group. For three years after she graduated=
 from Williams College with a double major in math and English, she worked =
for investment banking division of Goldman, Sachs. ''You work literally 100=
 hours a week, sitting at your computer doing a lot of calculating, a lot o=
f spread sheets,'' she said on Friday.=20
She would review the books of companies being offered for sale and write me=
morandums describing their virtues and faults. ''I learned,'' she said, ''t=
hat numbers can lie.''=20
She also had an epiphany about accounting and its potential for abuse. ''Wh=
en you come out of a liberal arts background,'' she said, ''you want to kno=
w why something is the way it is.'' In accounting, ''there is no reason why=
. There is no fundamental truth underlying it. It's just based on rules.''=
=20
''These rules create an incentive to get around rules,'' she said. ''This m=
eans getting away from any accounting portraying the fundamental economic r=
eality of a company.''=20
Ms. McLean had never practiced journalism. But after three years at Goldman=
, in a culture where she was never comfortable, she decided to send her res=
ume to several newspapers. She had no takers. Then a friend sent her resume=
 to Fortune. There, she joined its corps of fact-checkers, soon becoming fa=
mous for giving no quarter.=20
The fame stemmed from her tug of war with Andrew S. Grove, then the chief e=
xecutive of Intel. He had written an article about how he had decided among=
 possible treatments for his prostate cancer. Ms. McLean, then 25, challeng=
ed him on his data. And she was right. Both agree on this, though neither r=
emembers the exact details. ''She did a super job,'' Mr. Grove wrote in an =
e-mail message last week. ''She was a royal pain but not one person subsequ=
ently challenged any facts in my article.'' Later he sought her out to than=
k her.=20
The incident brought her to the attention of John Huey, then the magazine's=
 managing editor. Ms. McLean was promoted and slowly mastered the writing s=
ide of the business (paying her editors back for their labors by regularly =
beating them at pool).=20
Five years later, she was tackling Enron, nervously. She had felt indirectl=
y rebuked when her earlier critical financial analysis of I.B.M.'s earnings=
 had no effect on investors or I.B.M.'s share price. Remembering how her ju=
dgment had not been validated, she was afraid Mr. Skilling, the Enron chief=
 executive, was right when he implied she had failed to do the work require=
d to understand Enron's financials.=20
But events proved him to be wrong. He was not wrong, however, when he told =
her that similar questions were being asked ''by people who want to throw r=
ocks at the company.'' The first person to flag Ms. McLean to the odd finan=
cial statements had been someone who had bet against Enron stock.=20
Almost all the reporting on the company at that point was favorable. As Jam=
es S. Chanos, a short seller who is president of Kynikos Associates, a hedg=
e fund in New York, said in a recent interview, ''The stock price conveys l=
egitimacy.''=20
Short sellers like Mr. Chanos, who pointed Ms. McLean toward Enron, are amo=
ng the few skeptics in a business where most interest groups -- analysts, i=
nvestment bankers, shareholders and executives -- profit from a bull market=
.=20
Ms. McLean went on to report about soy milk and Prozac, not Enron. ''The ne=
xt line of reporting wasn't clear,'' she said.=20
But Peter Eavis of TheStreet.com continued to question the valuation of Enr=
on's investment portfolio. Last summer, he reported investor uncertainty ab=
out ''how much Enron's earnings have been aided by deals'' by entities like=
 ''LJM Capital Management, whose general partner is Enron's chief finance o=
fficer, Andrew Fastow.'' Even the revelation of Mr. Fastow's dual loyalties=
 provoked little attention.=20
Maybe, as Mark Roberts, the research director of Off Wall Street Consulting=
 in Cambridge, Mass., said, ''The whole thing was so opaque and so difficul=
t to conceive and so well hidden that it was just beyond the tools of journ=
alists.''=20
Certainly, after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, journalists were distracte=
d. But, in the following weeks, investors were not. As Enron's stock price =
kept declining, they asked more questions like Ms. McLean's, and they did n=
ot like the answers. ''What led to all the revelations and the beginning of=
 the end,'' Mr. Roberts said, ''was a crisis of confidence.=20
Ms. McLean is unsure what lessons journalists will learn from covering Enro=
n. ''If we all are more cynical about companies and know that accountants c=
an't be trusted and boards can't be trusted, is that a good thing?'' she as=
ked.

A Fog Over Enron, And the Legal Landscape
By DIANA B. HENRIQUES with KURT EICHENWALD

01/27/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 3
c. 2002 New York Times Company

''ROTTEN.'' ''Horrible.'' ''Indefensible.'' ''Shocking.''=20
With those words, securities law experts around the country condemned the w=
ay Enron had structured and sold a partnership called LJM2, which offered i=
nvestors a chance to profit from confidential information about Enron's inv=
estment plans -- and gave the partnership investors more information about =
the company's finances than Enron's shareholders received.
''This is potentially the most serious revelation about Enron to date,'' sa=
id Joel Seligman, a securities law historian and dean of the Washington Uni=
versity Law School. ''You can't overstate how shocking it is.''=20
But did the arrangement, however unfair it seems to stockholders, actually =
violate the nation's securities laws and regulations? That is far more diff=
icult to answer, legal scholars say -- and far more important. For them, th=
e fundamental question about the sprawling Enron scandal is whether it is a=
 case of strong laws being violated by bad people, or of weak laws renderin=
g such violations unnecessary.=20
''If a company of this size, advised by top-tier accountants and law firms,=
 could conclude that our laws permit some of what happened here, then our l=
aws are inadequate,'' said Richard C. Breeden, a former chairman of the Sec=
urities and Exchange Commission. ''Clearly it violates the spirit and inten=
t of securities laws and the whole concept of full and fair disclosure.''=
=20
The quandary is particularly acute in the case of this partnership, because=
 it seemed to thrive on arrangements -- procedural barriers known as ''Chin=
ese walls'' -- that were actually intended to protect investors. These lega=
l barriers prevented investment bankers who were privy to information about=
 the partnership from legally sharing that information with shareholders. I=
nstead, investors remained in the dark about Enron's actual financial condi=
tion.=20
But the partnership, lawyers and finance experts say, raises novel question=
s about the effectiveness of other parts of the securities laws, as well. T=
hese include prohibitions against trading on inside information; rules agai=
nst selectively disclosing information to some shareholders and not others;=
 efforts to police corporate conflicts of interest and the wisdom of removi=
ng restrictions on the roles that investment banks can play.=20
''No matter how good you make the laws, there will always be a small group =
of people who will push them,'' said John Pound, a former finance professor=
 at Harvard and the president of Integrity Partners, an investment manageme=
nt firm in Boston. ''But the Enron case has raised a lot of useful and impo=
rtant policy questions that will need to be addressed. And the Chinese-wall=
 issue is a perfect example of that.''=20
ENRON'S swift fall, culminating in its bankruptcy filing in early December,=
 came after the company revised its past financial statements to more accur=
ately reflect partnership deals like the LJM2 arrangement. The company and =
its auditor, Arthur Andersen, are the subjects of both criminal and regulat=
ory investigations, and are being examined by nearly a dozen Congressional =
committees.=20
One important focus of those investigations is the way that partnerships li=
ke LJM2 contributed to the company's collapse. Confidential records of that=
 specific partnership, disclosed in The New York Times on Friday, show that=
 Enron tried to attract investors by dangling the prospect of potentially r=
emarkable returns, driven by access to inside information about Enron's fin=
ancial dealings.=20
Potential investors were told, in detail, about the company's off-the-books=
 transactions and assets, information that Enron had not disclosed to its p=
ublic shareholders. Indeed, partnership investors knew that Enron controlle=
d at least 50 percent more assets than the company had disclosed in its aud=
ited financial statements, filed with the S.E.C. and provided to public sha=
reholders.=20
That lopsided flow of information strikes many legal experts as a direct ch=
allenge to traditional thinking about Chinese walls, the common nickname fo=
r the procedures that assure that the confidential information Wall Street =
firms obtain from their corporate investment banking clients remains confid=
ential, even within the firm itself.=20
Chinese walls came into being in the late 1960's, as a regulatory response =
to the increased complexity of Wall Street firms and a more vigorous S.E.C.=
 response to insider trading, said Michael A. Perino, a securities law prof=
essor at St. John's University.=20
Their purpose, quite simply, was to prevent an investment banker from using=
 confidential information about a corporate client to make trades in that c=
lient's stock -- trades in which the banker would have an advantage over ot=
her investors.=20
In 1988, at the end of a decade punctuated by insider trading scandals, Con=
gress made such ''informational partitions'' mandatory, citing the need to =
prevent Wall Street insiders from taking advantage of Main Street investors=
.=20
But in this case, it appears that the protection backfired, legal experts s=
aid. Investment bankers who worked on the Enron partnerships were privy to =
information that may have raised doubts about the information Enron had pro=
vided to public investors -- but they were forbidden by law from raising an=
y red flags.=20
''The purpose of the Chinese wall is to help public investors, but this wor=
ked backwards,'' said Mr. Pound, the former Harvard professor. ''What amaze=
s me is that the people who knew they had information adverse to the public=
 investors would not feel a need to find a way, within the institution, to =
address that issue -- to go up in the institution high enough to say, 'We h=
ave a policy problem here.' ''=20
The LJM2 partnership points up Chinese-wall problems that courts and regula=
tors have been struggling to resolve for years, said John C. Coffee Jr., a =
securities law expert at Columbia University Law School.=20
If the investment banking divisions of a brokerage firm had information tha=
t raised questions about the value of a public company's stock, there is no=
thing under the current law that the bankers could do to help the firm's re=
tail investors. But there are more limited actions the firm could take, Mr.=
 Coffee said.=20
''They can't go out and privately tell their clients the full information t=
hey have received without being part of an insider trading scheme,'' Mr. Co=
ffee said. ''But they could arguably use the information to withdraw their =
recommendation on the stock.'' That, he added, ''will cause some consternat=
ion and adverse publicity that would alert the market to a problem.''=20
OTHER legal experts worry that the investment banks dealing with Enron were=
 constrained by conflicts between their role as lenders and their work as u=
nderwriters.=20
This conflict, too, has roots deep in American financial history. In the de=
cade before the 1929 crash, banks would sometimes help a failing company se=
ll stock to the bank's customers to raise money to repay the bank's loans. =
As part of the New Deal, Congress passed the Glass-Steagall Act, which prev=
ented banks from providing both underwriting and traditional banking servic=
es.=20
But long before Congress officially repealed Glass-Steagall in 1999, both b=
anks and Wall Street firms found legal detours around the prohibition. Now,=
 some securities law experts said, Congress may need to take a fresh look a=
t whether these dual roles in any way affected the flow of significant info=
rmation to public investors in Enron.=20
One specialist in corporate law, who spoke on condition of anonymity becaus=
e his firm is an Enron creditor, said, ''In a case like this, this perverse=
 effect should be discussed at the very highest levels in the firm.''=20
Mr. Breeden, the former S.E.C. chairman, said no direct parallels to the cl=
assic pre-1929 conflicts have appeared. But Enron's evolution ''was a very =
subtle situation, and very complex,'' he said.=20
''In any case,'' he added, ''the public should be able to conclude where th=
e investment banks' greatest interests lie.''=20
That investors in the LJM2 partnership apparently got information that publ=
ic investors could not get -- because Enron had moved certain operations of=
f its balance sheet -- also underscores the importance of preventing select=
ive disclosure by corporations, one former S.E.C. commissioner said.=20
Until last January, corporate executives would routinely hold private brief=
ings for analysts, slipping them details that were not available to public =
investors. To ''level the playing field,'' the S.E.C. enacted Regulation FD=
, which forbids such selective disclosure.=20
It is not clear from available documents whether partnership investors cont=
inued to learn about Enron's finances after the new rule went into effect. =
''But if they did, that raises blazing questions of selective disclosure,''=
 the former commissioner said. More broadly, he said, regulators should det=
ermine whether other corporations that use off-balance-sheet entities are g=
iving investors in those entities more information than public stockholders=
 receive.=20
SHELDON ELSEN, a securities lawyer at Orans Elsen & Lupert in New York, sai=
d the structure of the LJM2 partnership ''really presents some very troubli=
ng problems.''=20
''I don't know that there is anything illegal here,'' Mr. Elsen said, ''but=
 there is a terrible odor about it.''=20
James Moriarty, a Houston lawyer who has represented plaintiffs in a number=
 of securities fraud cases, said: ''That they would tell the truth to the r=
ich investors, and lie to their stockholders, is outside the realm of the c=
omprehensible.''=20
Enron might argue that the information potential partnership investors got =
was not important enough to require disclosure. But lawyers said the fact t=
hat Enron disclosed the information to them at all would be evidence in its=
elf that such details were material.=20
''Given that they give the information to somebody else as part of their ba=
rgain to raise money for another deal, there is a strong likelihood that it=
 would reach the materiality level,'' said Stanley Arkin, a corporate and s=
ecurities lawyer in New York.=20
But the information gap between partnership investors and public stockholde=
rs is just one of the conflicts that litter the Enron battlefield, legal ex=
perts say.=20
Congress is already wrestling with the potential conflicts that confront ou=
tside accounting firms, like Arthur Andersen. The firms act both as indepen=
dent auditors -- which companies must have, by federal law -- and consultan=
ts on tax and technology issues.=20
But that, too, just scratches the surface. The LJM2 partnership, like sever=
al others set up by Enron, was run by a general partnership, LJM2 Capital P=
artners, and managed by a second partnership, LJM2 Capital Management. The =
people behind both partnerships -- the ''principals'' -- were all Enron exe=
cutives, including Andrew S. Fastow, Enron's chief financial officer, and M=
ichael J. Kopper, managing director at Enron's global equity markets group.=
=20
''Investors should be aware that there will be occasions where the general =
partner and its affiliates may encounter potential conflicts of interest in=
 connection with the partnership's activities,'' the partnership sales docu=
ments said. It explained that the principals ''are employees at Enron and o=
we fiduciary duties to Enron and its subsidiaries; such fiduciary duties ma=
y from time to time conflict with fiduciary duties owed to the partnership =
and its partners.''=20
Enron's board specifically approved Mr. Fastow's role by exempting him from=
 the corporate conflict-of-interest policy -- a step that Mr. Breeden found=
 inexplicable.=20
''The very notion that the chief financial officer of a major corporation c=
ould have divided loyalties to this degree of magnitude is something I woul=
dn't have believed any board of directors would allow -- or that any C.F.O.=
 would accept,'' Mr. Breeden said. ''The C.F.O. is the financial conscience=
 of the company, the guardian of the numbers. If he has a conflict, how can=
 the system work?''=20
HE proposed requiring that when any corporate board or chief financial offi=
cer approves a conflict exemption, that action must be reported immediately=
 to the S.E.C., and thus to the public.=20
What is known about Enron's partnership arrangements so far, he said, revea=
ls an even more profound conflict between management and shareholders. Beca=
use Enron had guaranteed the solvency of certain partnerships, obligations =
that were not disclosed on its balance sheet were secretly but steadily ero=
ding its financial health.=20
''It is as if Enron and its top officers had set up a loaded machine gun an=
d aimed it at the company -- and the shareholders didn't know it,'' Mr. Bre=
eden said.=20
With so much turmoil still surrounding the investigation -- and with so muc=
h uncertainty about exactly what went wrong -- few legal scholars are willi=
ng to predict exactly what steps lawmakers and regulators may take to preve=
nt the next Enron.=20
But two things seem certain, they said.=20
The first is that these fresh disclosures about how Enron's partnerships we=
re structured and sold will expand the number of defendants named in the sh=
areholder lawsuits aimed at trying to recover some of investors' market los=
ses, which have been estimated at more than $60 billion.=20
Every large institution -- whether an underwriter or partnership investor -=
- that was aware of material information withheld from Enron investors coul=
d find itself in court, securities lawyers said. Already, they said, lawyer=
s who specialize in suing corporations are discussing which investors, inst=
itutions and advisers are potential defendants.=20
''The image I have in my mind is a long, long line of the wealthy and the p=
owerful who made money out of these deals, all set up to hand it over to th=
e people who lost everything in their Enron investments,'' said Mr. Moriart=
y, the Houston lawyer. ''This is what the Marines like to call a target-ric=
h environment.''=20
The second consequence is likely to be systematic Congressional action to a=
mend the nation's securities laws, said Mr. Seligman, the law school dean a=
nd regulatory historian.=20
The securities laws enacted in the New Deal were ''a response to the genera=
l public belief, after the 1929 crash, that there were two securities marke=
ts -- one for privileged insiders and one for everyone else,'' Mr. Seligman=
 said. Enron's LJM2 partnership ''smacks of that world,'' he added. And whe=
n the American public believes two such markets exist, he said, ''Congress =
-- every time, regardless of party or president -- has acted to address tha=
t concern.''

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE PROSECUTOR
Noted Brooklyn Prosecutor Joins U.S. Inquiry Into Enron Collapse
By PHILIP SHENON

01/28/2002
The New York Times
Page 10, Column 3
c. 2002 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON, Jan. 27 -- The Justice Department has named a leading organized=
-crime prosecutor from New York to its investigation of the collapse of the=
 Enron Corporation, department officials said.=20
The prosecutor, Andrew Weissmann, chief of the criminal division of the Uni=
ted States attorney's office in Brooklyn and the lead prosecutor in the 199=
7 trial that ended with the imprisonment of the reputed head of the Genoves=
e crime family, is described by colleagues as a tenacious investigator and =
litigator.
Department officials said they hoped the appointment of Mr. Weissmann would=
 be seen as additional evidence that the Justice Department's Enron inquiry=
 would be aggressive, despite the many ties between the Bush administration=
 and senior Enron executives who were among the largest contributors to Pre=
sident Bush's 2000 campaign.=20
Attorney General John Ashcroft has recused himself from the case because he=
 accepted contributions from Enron in a failed campaign for re-election to =
the Senate.=20
Mr. Weissmann will report to Leslie R. Caldwell, a career federal prosecuto=
r in the United States attorney's office in San Francisco who has been name=
d to head the Enron investigation. Ms. Caldwell, chief of the securities fr=
aud division in the prosecutor's office in San Francisco, has a reputation =
for toughness and for helping juries make sense of complicated criminal cas=
es.=20
Mr. Weissmann, 42, has handled a variety of cases in Brooklyn but is best r=
emembered for his prosecution of organized-crime figures, most notably Vinc=
ent Gigante, the reputed head of the Genovese crime family.=20
Mr. Weissmann won a 1997 conviction of Mr. Gigante on charges of murder-con=
spiracy and racketeering, overcoming defense claims that Mr. Gigante was in=
competent to stand trial. Mr. Gigante was known for walking around Greenwic=
h Village in a bathrobe and pajamas, which resulted in his being dubbed the=
 Oddfather.=20
Mr. Weissmann, a graduate of Princeton University and Columbia Law School, =
was born and raised in New York. He has worked in the United States attorne=
y's office in Brooklyn for 10 years, the last two as chief of the criminal =
division.

THE FALLOF ENRON Convictions for Enron Execs Would Be Hard Won
ERIC LICHTBLAU; DAVID G. SAVAGE
TIMES STAFF WRITERS

01/28/2002
Los Angeles Times
Home Edition
A-1
Copyright 2002 / The Times Mirror Company

WASHINGTON -- Although Enron Corp. may have destroyed thousands of document=
s, misled shareholders and left the retirement accounts of many of its empl=
oyees nearly worthless, legal experts say the prospect of serious criminal =
convictions of corporate executives is far from certain.=20
Despite some recent success in corporate fraud cases, prosecutors must over=
come daunting hurdles, including changes in federal regulation of insider t=
rading, the vagaries of securities law and the sometimes conflicting agenda=
 of congressional investigators, according to law professors, attorneys who=
 specialize in white-collar crime and law enforcement officials.
Evidence that Enron destroyed documents related to the company's meteoric c=
ollapse offers the most compelling prospect for a criminal case, suggesting=
 possible obstruction of justice charges, legal experts and law enforcement=
 officials agree.=20
But it could take years for authorities to build more serious charges of co=
nspiracy, insider trading or securities fraud against Enron's higher-ups, a=
nd even then it may prove tough to return convictions, experts predicted.=
=20
"Financial fraud cases are very hard to prove. [Executives] can say they ma=
de bad business judgments, but you have to prove unanimously and beyond a r=
easonable doubt that they deliberately intended to deceive" the public and =
their shareholders about the company's finances, said Columbia University l=
aw professor Jeffrey N. Gordon.=20
Even as FBI investigators began descending on Enron's Houston headquarters =
last week to probe possible crimes, they probably will confront several leg=
al and political realities that could work to Enron's advantage. Among the =
potential roadblocks:=20
* The entire U.S. attorney's office in Houston has pulled out of the invest=
igation because too many prosecutors are related to Enron employees, forcin=
g the Justice Department to create a special task force that must start fro=
m scratch in probing the energy company's labyrinth of partnerships.=20
* Democrats already have called for an independent counsel to probe Enron's=
 well-documented political connections to the Bush administration, but the =
demise of the outside counsel law in 1999 has muddied the process for deter=
mining how and when to appoint an outside counsel.=20
* A recent rule change at the Securities and Exchange Commission, authorizi=
ng prearranged sell-offs of executives' stock, gives added insulation to al=
legations of insider trading and could provide former Enron Chairman and Ch=
ief Executive Kenneth L. Lay and other executives with a built-in defense.=
=20
* And Congress' zeal to conduct high-profile hearings on Enron could compli=
cate the use of testimony from witnesses who become part of the criminal pr=
obe, as happened in the Iran-Contra scandal. In that case, charges against =
Oliver L. North and John M. Poindexter were thrown out in 1990 because thei=
r prosecutions were deemed tainted by immunized congressional testimony.=20
Coordinating Immunity Offers=20
Justice Department officials have begun discussions with Congress on how to=
 coordinate immunity offers that Congress might make to witnesses, such as =
David B. Duncan, the partner at accounting firm Andersen who oversaw the En=
ron account. Duncan, who since has been fired, invoked the 5th Amendment la=
st week before a congressional committee rather than answer questions about=
 the destruction of Enron documents.=20
The department hopes to blunt the effect that any congressional immunity de=
als would have on future criminal cases.=20
"We never like to see potential witnesses paraded before Congress, but that=
's always a danger in a case like this," acknowledged a law enforcement off=
icial who asked not to be identified.=20
Enron spokesman Eric Thode said it would be premature to discuss any crimin=
al allegations, noting: "We'll just let the investigations take their cours=
e, and, of course, we're cooperating fully."=20
Despite the obstacles that prosecutors face, authorities are buoyed by the =
recent progress they have made in several other high-profile financial frau=
d cases.=20
In Pennsylvania, the former chief financial officer of apparel maker Leslie=
 Fay Cos. was sentenced last week to nine years in prison for inflating the=
 company's earnings by $81 million. The scheme forced the company into Chap=
ter 11 bankruptcy protection for four years.=20
In San Francisco, former executives at health services giant McKesson Corp.=
, are facing civil and criminal charges for allegedly concocting bogus reve=
nue figures. The losses for the company's shareholders: $9 billion.=20
And in New Jersey, in a case with even more telltale similarities to Enron,=
 the former chairman and vice chairman of Cendant Corp.--a franchiser whose=
 brands include Howard Johnson, Avis and Century 21--are awaiting trial on =
charges of conspiracy and securities fraud.=20
Authorities allege that Cendant, in perhaps the longest-running scheme of i=
ts kind, was "cooking the books" for more than a decade, with former Chairm=
an Walter A. Forbes reaping $30 million as the company's stock soared amid =
misleading financial reports.=20
Once irregularities in the company's accounting were exposed in 1998, the v=
alue of Cendant's stock plunged $14 billion in a single day.=20
Cendant and accounting giant Ernst & Young, accused of whitewashing the irr=
egularities, agreed last year to pay a near-record total of $3.2 billion to=
 shareholders who claimed they were defrauded by the scheme.=20
But Forbes and former Vice Chairman E. Kirk Shelton, who have declared thei=
r innocence in the affair, are not expected to go to trial until late this =
year, about 4 1/2 years after the scandal first broke. That arduous legal p=
ath is testament to the difficulty of bringing such complex financial fraud=
 cases, law enforcement officials say.=20
"It's a brutally hard case," said one official close to the Cendant prosecu=
tion. "It takes a special accounting knowledge, it's an incredible paper tr=
ail, and you have to have cooperators. We had [three] people pleading guilt=
y, all the ones just below the top. . . . Without them, it would be a much =
more formidable task" to prosecute the company's top executives.=20
Reports of widespread shredding of Enron documents give authorities substan=
tial leverage to try to persuade witnesses to cooperate, experts said.=20
"As a prosecutor, you are looking for evidence that the senior people had k=
nowledge of the scheme," said San Francisco attorney Stephen Meagher, a for=
mer prosecutor of white-collar crime cases.=20
"And typically, when you find documents were being destroyed, that answers =
the question. That means certain people were aware of problems and they wer=
e determined to destroy the evidence. It's the prosecutor's dream come true=
 because it shifts the burden to the other side. They have to explain what =
they were trying to hide."=20
Duncan, the Andersen auditor, has spoken with federal investigators at leas=
t twice, a sign that he may be willing to cooperate in exchange for a plea =
deal.=20
It remains to be seen whether Duncan or someone at Enron turns out to be th=
e star witness prosecutors are seeking. But Columbia Law School professor J=
ohn C. Coffee, a securities specialist, noted that "historically in white-c=
ollar crime cases, you have a trail of falling dominoes, and you start low =
and offer leniency to cooperate and get evidence against the higher-ups. I =
think you're going to get a whole succession of people cutting deals here."=
=20
The danger, however, is that such witnesses have a potential credibility pr=
oblem: If they admit to destroying documents, will a jury believe their tes=
timony fingering higher executives?=20
"Those aren't necessarily the most credible witnesses on the stand," said P=
aul Fishman, a former Justice Department official who specializes in white-=
collar defense.=20
Sending a Strong Message=20
Beyond the obstruction issue, law enforcement officials say possible charge=
s against executives at Enron and Andersen could include securities fraud, =
insider trading, wire and mail fraud, conspiracy and even racketeering.=20
The case, if it can be proved, would hinge on a simple premise: that execut=
ives fooled the public and its shareholders into thinking the company was m=
ore profitable than it was--and enriched themselves in the process as the c=
ompany's stock went up in value.=20
The corporation itself faces possible indictment and criminal penalties, bu=
t legal observers said anything short of indicting top Enron executives cou=
ld be seen as a failure in the eyes of the public.=20
"Indicting a bankrupt company achieves next to nothing," Coffee said.=20
Indeed, Duke University law professor James D. Cox said indicting Enron exe=
cutives would send a strong message.=20
"If they are serious about eliminating financial fraud, this is the battle =
the government needs to take on," he said. "This looks to be a case of purp=
oseful manipulation of earnings and purposeful concealment of debt. They cr=
eated a truly false facade."=20
Class-action lawsuits against Enron maintain that Lay made more than $100 m=
illion from stock sales before the company's value plummeted. But Lay's law=
yers have maintained that many sales were from prearranged sell-offs, which=
 could give him insulation under a rule adopted by the SEC in 2000 regardin=
g what constitutes insider trading.=20
The so-called 10b5-1 rule holds that even if insiders possess sensitive cor=
porate information, they can legally buy and sell company stock so long as =
it is part of a prearranged trading plan. The SEC and various courts have w=
rangled over how the new rule should be interpreted, and allegations of ins=
ider trading against Lay and other Enron executives could prove "a key test=
," said Jill Fisch, a corporate and securities law expert at Fordham Law Sc=
hool.=20
Fisch compared the Enron probe to the financial scandal that led to the con=
viction of former junk bond kingpin Michael Milken and other Wall Street tr=
aders in the 1980s.=20
As in the Milken case, Fisch said, she believes Enron is "an impure case on=
 a lot of legal questions." But, she added, the public backlash--fueled by =
headlines about document shredding--may be enough to drive the investigatio=
n in the absence of clear law.

Building the House of Enron: As Enron's Derivatives Trading Comes Into Focu=
s, Gap in Oversight Is Spotlighted
By Michael Schroeder
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

WASHINGTON -- As the significant role that derivatives played in Enron Corp=
.'s downfall comes into focus, lawmakers and regulators are lining up in fa=
vor of more oversight of these risky investments.=20
While the Houston-based company's core energy operations involved natural-g=
as and electricity transmission, its largest and most-profitable business w=
as trading derivatives -- unregulated financial instruments that derive the=
ir value from an underlying commodity or wager on the future. Now, informat=
ion is surfacing that Enron's derivatives trading may have been used to mas=
k weakness in the company's other businesses such as fiber-optic bandwidth,=
 retail gas and power, and water systems.
"Enron was more of a hedge fund than an energy company," said Rep. Richard =
Baker (R., La.), chairman of a Financial Services Committee panel that is l=
ooking into the derivatives issue, in an interview.=20
After listening to testimony at his committee's Enron hearing last week, Se=
nate Governmental Affairs Chairman Joseph Lieberman said he would hold a he=
aring specifically on the need for derivatives regulation. The Connecticut =
Democrat was responding in part to the testimony of San Diego University la=
w professor Frank Partnoy, who outlined a series of methods that he said En=
ron used "to create false profit and loss entries for the derivatives Enron=
 traded."=20
To ensure that Enron met Wall Street quarterly earnings estimates, it used =
derivatives and off-balance-sheet partnerships, or so-called special-purpos=
e vehicles, to hide losses on technology stocks and debts incurred to finan=
ce unprofitable businesses, Mr. Partnoy said. In addition, he said, "it app=
ears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation met=
hodologies." The entries, he said, "were systematic and occurred over sever=
al years, beginning as early as 1997."=20
Based on independent research and conversations with Enron traders, Mr. Par=
tnoy said he learned that some traders apparently hid losses and understate=
d profits, which had the effect of making derivatives trading appear less v=
olatile than it was. Randall Dodd, director of the Derivatives Study Center=
, an independent, nonpartisan Washington group, said in an interview that h=
e has reached similar conclusions. Mr. Dodd is advising three government ag=
encies and three congressional committees investigating Enron.=20
Declining to address specific allegations, Enron spokesman Vance Meyer said=
 in a statement, "Derivatives were not our business. They complemented our =
core business of buying and selling natural gas and power." Mr. Meyer also =
said: "I think it's safe to say that we are not going to agree with every v=
iew about Enron presented in the congressional hearings, but we do respect =
the process and hope, when all is said and done, that something positive wi=
ll come out of it."=20
In 1989, the energy company, originally a utility that produced and transpo=
rted natural gas and electricity, had begun shifting its focus to energy tr=
ading. The derivatives included not only Enron's very profitable trading op=
erations in natural-gas derivatives, but also the more-esoteric financial i=
nstruments it began trading recently -- such as fiber-optic bandwidth and w=
eather derivatives.=20
During 2000 alone, Enron's derivatives-related assets increased from $2.2 b=
illion to $12 billion, with most of the growth coming from increased tradin=
g through its EnronOnline, an Internet trading system, according to Enron's=
 financial reports. Mr. Dodd figures that if Enron were a bank, it would ra=
nk as the 10th largest derivatives dealer.=20
Innovations in technology and finance have helped obliterate clear distinct=
ions between banks, brokerage firms and newer hybrids, such as Enron. But f=
inancial regulators hew to decades-old divisions of authority, continuing t=
o keep a close watch on banks, brokerage firms and conventional exchanges, =
while leaving new entrants such as Enron to police themselves.=20
In late 2000, Congress passed legislation that exempted from regulation ove=
r-the-counter derivatives, which are contracts arranged among sophisticated=
 buyers and sellers such as banks, Wall Street firms and public companies. =
The measure had support from both parties, as well as the Federal Reserve a=
nd the Clinton administration.=20
Advocates of derivatives say the instruments give companies, investors and =
lenders a way to reduce their exposure to many kinds of financial risks. Mo=
st regulators and financial-industry executives insist that the country's f=
inancial system remains sound.=20
But the Enron scandal spotlights an enormous void in the nation's system of=
 financial regulation, and it is rekindling a thorny debate over just how t=
hat gap should be filled.=20
As a publicly traded company, Enron routinely provided the SEC with general=
 information about its finances but wasn't obliged to divulge to any agency=
 detailed information about its over-the-counter trading activities.=20
In the wake of Enron's bankruptcy, federal energy regulators say they plan =
rules for energy-derivatives accounting. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill sa=
id derivatives regulations may need modernizing.=20
"In this case, I think it's fair to say it may be that our rules and regula=
tions have gotten behind practices," Mr. O'Neill said in a recent interview=
 on the "Charlie Rose Show."=20
---=20
Enron assembled a complex structure of partnership deals. In the end, it ca=
me tumbling down. See an interactive graphic at WSJ.com

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: SEEKING EVIDENCE
Hard-to-Miss Box of Scraps Catches F.B.I. Agent's Eye
By MICHAEL BRICK

01/28/2002
The New York Times
Page 10, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

HOUSTON, Jan. 27 -- Agents of both the F.B.I. and the Securities and Exchan=
ge Commission have expressed interest in reviewing the remains of documents=
 that a former Enron executive said were recently shredded at the company's=
 headquarters.=20
An F.B.I. agent here approached lawyers for shareholders who are suing Enro=
n to discuss the documents, the lawyers said. The shareholders' lawyers had=
 displayed a box of shredded documents last Tuesday. The agent also talked =
to lawyers representing Enron. The S.E.C. also has pursued the matter by is=
suing a subpoena to the former executive, Maureen Castaneda, people familia=
r with that investigation said.
The S.E.C. had already issued subpoenas to more than 30 Enron employees in =
a variety of departments, according to several people, including an Enron e=
mployee who received one in December. The subpoena to Ms. Castaneda was iss=
ued last week, when she discussed the documents in interviews with ABC News=
 and The New York Times.=20
It is not clear what the documents said or why they were shredded. The fede=
ral judge in the shareholder lawsuits, Melinda Harmon, ordered an accelerat=
ed schedule of information gathering last week. Shareholders' lawyers had a=
rgued for haste, and they said they had reason to believe destruction of do=
cuments was continuing.=20
An Enron spokesman said the company is cooperating with investigations abou=
t the shredded documents. ''It's a good time to let the facts come from the=
 proper authorities investigating this,'' Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Enro=
n, said. ''We are the ones that called the Justice Department.''=20
The documents were generally shredded horizontally rather than vertically, =
so it is possible to make out words and even sentence fragments. The shreds=
 include accounting records, and some bear the names of the off-the-balance=
-sheet partnerships that have been linked to transactions allowing Enron to=
 keep some of its problems hidden.=20
Shareholders' lawyers have said they might eventually try to reassemble the=
 documents, but it is unclear whether government investigators will make a =
similar effort.=20
Mr. Palmer said he did not know whether Enron usually shredded documents ho=
rizontally. The company has said it repeatedly ordered employees not to des=
troy documents that could be relevant to investigations. It announced on Oc=
t. 31 that the S.E.C. had upgraded its inquiry to a formal investigation.=
=20
Knowingly destroying records that have the potential to be of interest to g=
overnment investigators would be a crime. Investigators did not signal that=
 the documents discussed by Ms. Castaneda were definitely of interest until=
 after the shredding took place and became public.=20
Ms. Castaneda made her comments last Monday. The next day, the S.E.C. notif=
ied shareholders' lawyers, who have been working with her, that a subpoena =
had been issued for Ms. Castaneda's appointment books, all documents concer=
ning entities that have had dealings with Enron and all documents related t=
o Enron other than her pay stubs.=20
The F.B.I. agent approached the lawyers for Enron and those for its shareho=
lders in the courthouse last Tuesday to discuss the box of shredded paper t=
hat the shareholders' lawyers had put on a table in the courtroom. A lawyer=
 for Arthur Andersen, Enron's accounting firm, suggested in court that the =
shredded documents should be turned over to the Justice Department.=20
The F.B.I. agent did not take the documents, so they remained in the posses=
sion of Milberg Weiss, one of the law firms suing Enron. A spokesman for th=
e firm said it would work with Ms. Castaneda's lawyer to comply with the su=
bpoena.=20
One possible reason the agent may have left the documents alone is that if =
they were taken for a criminal investigation, they might be subject to gran=
d jury secrecy rules. Such rules would not apply in a civil investigation. =
Thus, investigators in a civil inquiry, such as S.E.C representatives, can =
share the information with F.B.I. and other criminal investigators. But cri=
minal investigators might be prevented by grand jury secrecy from sharing t=
he documents with S.E.C. investigators.=20
A lawyer for Ms. Castaneda declined to comment.

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: LEGAL STRATEGY
SHREDDED PAPERS KEY IN ENRON CASE
By KURT EICHENWALD

01/28/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

For all its eye-popping revelations, the Enron case presents an enormous ch=
allenge to government investigators, one that could require years of diggin=
g to unravel. At this point, no one knows for sure whether the actions that=
 led to the collapse of the company constituted financial crimes, and, if t=
hey did, which should be the focus of the investigation.=20
For that reason, legal experts said, the best things that happened for the =
criminal investigators in the case were the decisions by employees at Enron=
 and its auditor, Arthur Andersen & Company, to begin shredding documents.
Unlike the financial investigations, which will require forensic accountant=
s to unwind complex transactions, the document shredding gives investigator=
s comparatively simple cases of possible obstruction of justice. In such ca=
ses, witnesses are confronted, evidence is collected, the law is checked, a=
nd the decision whether to seek an indictment is made.=20
As a result, these experts said, the focus in the earliest days will be on =
pursuing possible criminal cases from those events.=20
The government's intent will be to use the leverage of potential indictment=
s to push possible defendants into the role of witnesses to get evidence fo=
r the broader financial investigation. ''The potential obstruction of justi=
ce is critical to the progress of this investigation,'' said Efrem M. Grail=
, a former prosecutor who is a partner with the Pittsburgh law firm of Reed=
 Smith. ''It is easier for the government to make an obstruction of justice=
 case than it is to make a case that people violated criminal securities la=
w or criminal fraud statutes.''=20
It is critical to start with such limits, legal experts said, to make sure =
that the case does not go off track, especially in its earliest days.=20
''It's essential that the government disciplines itself during the investig=
ation and reins in the scope of the inquiry,'' said Chris Bebel, a former f=
ederal prosecutor and former lawyer with the Securities and Exchange Commis=
sion. ''Otherwise, it is going to get bogged down in a sea of documents and=
 conflicting statements about complex transactions.''=20
According to people who have spoken with government officials involved in t=
he case, there is strong pressure from senior Justice Department officials =
to show some quick results from the investigation. That pressure will incre=
ase the attention focused on matters like document destruction, where the f=
acts are relatively easy to establish.=20
Until now, the most public investigations have been those conducted by a se=
ries of Congressional committees. But none of them have the power to bring =
charges in the case. That responsibility falls instead to prosecutors worki=
ng on a special Justice Department task force and to a group of agents with=
 the Federal Bureau of Investigation.=20
On the regulatory side, one investigation is being handled by the enforceme=
nt division at the S.E.C. The Labor Department is also reviewing whether En=
ron violated any rules while the stock price was plunging when it told empl=
oyees that they could not sell company shares from their retirement account=
s.=20
For government investigators, the scandal presents a difficult challenge. I=
n contrast with other well-known white-collar investigations, this inquiry =
begins with the government's having little guidance on where it should be l=
ooking.=20
Unlike the insider trading scandals on Wall Street in the 80's -- which beg=
an with revelations from Ivan F. Boesky, a stock trader -- the Enron inquir=
y has no central witness to provide a map of criminal activity. Unlike the =
Treasury market scandals that enveloped Salomon Brothers in the early 90's,=
 the Enron investigation begins with no admission from the company that it =
did anything improper. Unlike the price-fixing cases at the Archer Daniels =
Midland Company, later in the 90's, the Enron case does not have years of i=
ncriminating tape recordings provided by a cooperating witness.=20
''In this case, unlike in those in the past,'' said Stephen Meagher, a form=
er federal prosecutor who handled white-collar cases in San Francisco, ''th=
ere are many dimensions, and you just don't have a clear trail to a central=
 theory of the prosecution.''=20
As a result, the government begins the first major corporate scandal of the=
 new millennium with no strong handle on whether the trouble was brought ab=
out by criminal activity or folly. The distinction is critical. Experts say=
 any criminal case stemming from the Enron collapse would be related to som=
e sort of fraud: tax fraud, wire or mail fraud, securities fraud.=20
But to get such an indictment, prosecutors would have to prove that the peo=
ple charged had criminal intent -- that they knew they were engaging in fra=
ud when they were committing the acts in question.=20
In other words, if Enron executives or advisers filed or disseminated infor=
mation about the company that has since proved to be false, the government =
must be able to demonstrate that they knew about the falsehoods at the time=
. In this case, establishing such proof could be challenging.=20
According to internal Enron documents, every major transaction between the =
company and the series of partnerships that played a role in the collapse w=
ere supposed to have been reviewed by senior company managers and by Arthur=
 Andersen, the company's auditor.=20
If information about such deals was presented to Andersen truthfully, and t=
he accountant rendering the opinion was clear of any undisclosed personal o=
r financial conflicts, those rulings by the accountants will be some of the=
 most important weapons in any defense lawyer's argument against indictment=
.=20
Enron officials would effectively be left saying that they had relied on th=
e professionals, and the professionals would maintain that they had offered=
 unbiased judgments -- even if those judgments subsequently proved to be wr=
ong. But here again, legal experts said, the document destruction will prob=
ably prove to be critical in giving investigators a means of combating that=
 challenge.=20
''Without document destruction, the auditors would have been explaining tha=
t they made judgment calls,'' said Franklin B. Velie, a former federal pros=
ecutor now with the law firm of Salans Hertzfeld & Heilbronn in New York, '=
'and the company would have been saying that they relied on the auditors.=
=20
''It would be hard to know whether this was a horrible mistake or a crime. =
With document destruction, the path for the investigators seems a lot clear=
er.''

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE VICE PRESIDENT
Cheney Is Set to Battle Congress To Keep His Enron Talks Secret
By ELISABETH BUMILLER

01/28/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON, Jan. 27 -- Vice President Dick Cheney said today that the White=
 House was prepared to go to court to fight the release of documents demand=
ed by Congress as part of the investigation into any influence the Enron Co=
rporation had in formulating the Bush administration's energy policy.=20
Mr. Cheney said that the General Accounting Office, the agency demanding th=
e documents, was overstepping its authority and that he had a right to keep=
 the documents secret to preserve his ability to get ''unvarnished'' advice=
 from outside consultants.
David M. Walker, the head of the General Accounting Office, responded this =
evening in an interview that it was now ''highly likely'' that he would fil=
e a lawsuit against the Bush administration if Mr. Cheney did not turn over=
 the documents by the end of this week. Of the vice president's assertion t=
hat the agency was overstepping its bounds, Mr. Walker, the comptroller gen=
eral of the United States, replied, ''Talk is cheap.''=20
It would be the first time that the accounting office, the investigative ar=
m of Congress, sued another government department for not cooperating with =
an inquiry.=20
In interviews on the ABC program ''This Week'' and ''Fox News Sunday,'' Mr.=
 Cheney said that it was the right of the president and vice president to k=
eep secret meetings like those that Mr. Cheney and his energy task force ha=
d over the last year with Enron executives as the administration devised it=
s energy policy.=20
''What I object to,'' Mr. Cheney said on ''Fox News Sunday,'' ''and what th=
e president's objected to, and what we've told G.A.O. we won't do, is make =
it impossible for me or future vice presidents to ever have a conversation =
in confidence with anybody without having, ultimately, to tell a member of =
Congress what we talked about and what was said.''=20
At issue is how much Enron, a major contributor to the Republican Party, in=
fluenced the Bush energy plan, which eases environmental rules, opens publi=
c land to drilling and provides tax incentives to energy companies for expl=
oration. Enron and the White House have acknowledged that Enron executives =
met five times with Mr. Cheney or members of his staff about energy last ye=
ar, and documents from the meetings could show whether the administration p=
olicy mirrored any specific recommendations of Enron's.=20
A lawsuit would increase pressure on Mr. Cheney, who is under criticism fro=
m Democrats for his relationship with Enron, the giant energy trading compa=
ny that filed for bankruptcy protection and that has ties to officials in t=
he Bush administration.=20
''Now, the fact is, Enron didn't get any special deals,'' Mr. Cheney said o=
n ABC. ''Enron's been treated appropriately by this administration.''=20
Mr. Cheney also said that turning over the documents would be detrimental t=
o the presidency.=20
''We've seen it in cases like this before, where it's demanded that preside=
nts cough up and compromise on important principles,'' Mr. Cheney said. As =
a result, he said, ''we are weaker today as an institution because of the u=
nwise compromises that have been made over the last 30 to 35 years.''=20
Some Republican strategists have begun to worry that Mr. Cheney's stance is=
 contributing to perceptions that the White House has something to hide on =
the issue. The New York Times/CBS News Poll published today showed that a m=
ajority of Republicans believed that the administration had not been forthc=
oming about its dealings with Enron.=20
Mr. Walker, a member of the Reagan and first Bush administrations, who was =
appointed by President Bill Clinton in 1998 to a 15-year term as comptrolle=
r general, said that he did not agree with Mr. Cheney's position that he wa=
s allowed to keep the meetings secret because of his position as vice presi=
dent.=20
''This is not about the vice president's constitutional position,'' Mr. Wal=
ker said. ''It's about his capacity as chairman of the national energy poli=
cy development group. From Day 1, this has not had anything to do with the =
constitutional position of the vice president. I know they want to present =
it that way because they think people will be more sympathetic, but that's =
not factually accurate.''=20
Mr. Walker said that it was his view that the White House had put Mr. Chene=
y in charge of energy policy for that very reason -- to claim executive pri=
vilege and avoid oversight of the group by Congress. ''But that's a loophol=
e big enough to drive a truck through,'' Mr. Walker said.=20
Mr. Walker also took issue with an assertion by Mr. Cheney that the account=
ing office was pursuing the information only because of the political heat =
generated by the Enron scandal. In the ABC interview, Mr. Cheney said that =
the accounting office first pursued the documents last summer but then rele=
nted under the administration's stance that the information was privileged.=
=20
''The G.A.O. sort of backed off,'' Mr. Cheney said. ''They in effect said, =
'Well, maybe we aren't going to pursue it at this point.' What's re-energiz=
ed it now is the question of Enron, and some efforts by my Democratic frien=
ds on the Hill to try to create a political issue out of what's really a co=
rporate issue.''=20
At least 10 Congressional committees are investigating the Enron debacle.=
=20
Mr. Walker responded that Mr. Cheney's statement was ''absolutely false'' a=
nd said that the accounting office had been prepared to go to court in Sept=
ember, before the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon occurr=
ed. He decided, he said, to wait until the crisis had abated before pursuin=
g the matter.=20
An administration official said today that it was likely that any court fig=
ht over the documents would take years, and that the White House was convin=
ced it had a strong case.=20
White House officials continue to say that the Enron debacle is a financial=
 scandal, not a political one, and point out that the president's approval =
ratings remain high, above 80 percent. White House officials also say that =
even if Mr. Cheney turns over the documents, this will only whet the Democr=
ats' appetite.

Enron and the Lawyers

01/28/2002
The New York Times
Page 14, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

In the Enron scandal, the accounting industry has been the profession takin=
g the most heat. Before the dust settles, however, it seems inevitable that=
 more questions will be raised about the role that lawyers played in Enron'=
s alleged misdeeds.=20
Some of those concerns are already being raised about Vinson & Elkins, Enro=
n's law firm. When the time came for a review of some of the company's ques=
tionable partnerships, Enron's internal whistleblower, Sherron Watkins, a v=
ice president, urged the company's chairman, Kenneth Lay, not to assign the=
 task to Vinson & Elkins, since it had approved some of the very partnershi=
ps that needed to be investigated. Even so, the assignment was given to tha=
t very law firm, which concluded that problems with the partnerships were j=
ust cosmetic. It is likely that investigators will want to examine the lega=
l work of Vinson & Elkins, and whether it told Enron about the law firm's p=
ossible conflict in the matter.
Other law firms and lawyers will no doubt also be caught up in the investig=
ation. Much of the Enron scandal involves complex financial arrangements th=
at teams of lawyers helped to cobble together, and to which law firms gave =
their professional imprimatur. If any of these arrangements were in fact il=
legal, the lawyers may have been in the best position to know.=20
The Enron scandal is already producing cries for reform in the accounting i=
ndustry. Senator Barbara Boxer wants to prohibit accountants from consultin=
g for companies they audit, as Anderson did for Enron. The accounting indus=
try is reportedly in talks with the Securities and Exchange Commission abou=
t ways accountants can better regulate themselves.=20
It would be gratifying to report that the legal profession had been similar=
ly moved. Despite the recent revelations, the organized bar appears to be r=
egressing on the subject of financial fraud. Last August, an ethics commiss=
ion presented the American Bar Association with proposals for easing the or=
ganization's model rules on lawyer-client confidentiality so that lawyers n=
eed not remain silent while their clients engage in illegal activity. The A=
.B.A. adopted one proposal permitting lawyers to speak out to prevent clien=
ts from committing crimes reasonably certain to result in death or serious =
bodily harm. But it defeated a second proposal that would have let lawyers =
break confidentiality to prevent their clients from committing fraud reason=
ably certain to substantially injure the financial interests of another.=20
The A.B.A. is meeting again this week in Philadelphia. Despite the interven=
ing Enron scandal, there is apparently little chance it will reconsider its=
 financial fraud vote and some chance it will reverse last August's reform.=
 Even though the association's model rules are largely advisory, this would=
 be precisely the wrong message right now.=20
As scrutiny turns from accountants to lawyers in this scandal, the legal pr=
ofession should be looking for ways to assure Americans that when fraudulen=
t activities are under way that threaten their livelihoods, their investmen=
ts and their pensions, lawyers will be on their side, not on the side of th=
e criminals.

Here we go again. Another parade of lawyers. A gaggle of attorneys. A flock=
 of law firms. This is a lawyer full-employment act. A "Who's Who" of litig=
ators. A full-court press. The lawyers are hiring lawyers. Hang on, sports =
fans. Buckle your seat belts. It's going to be a bumpy column.=20
If we're pulling out all the cliche{acute}s, we must be talking a Washingto=
n scandal.
If it's the scandal du jour, it must be Enron Corp.=20
Thank goodness. This column will write itself. Even the cliche{acute}s will=
 write themselves. Where do we begin? We begin at the eye of storm, with En=
ron. Of course, we need a massive legal personality to fill the role of chi=
ef defender of the alleged corporate plunderer. Robert S. Bennett of Skadde=
n, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom fits the bill. We just love our blustery Bob=
 Bennett. We've missed his work defending President Clinton during sex scan=
dals. So it was a delight to see him ride out of the corral with both guns =
blaring, firing at the media and the Congress as Enron's lawyer.=20
But you could just hear a sigh of sadness in the media, though, when report=
ers realized that David Boies would not represent Andrew Fastow, the chief =
financial officer who is the supposed mastermind of the partnerships under =
the microscope. No, it is just a member of Boies's firm, Boies, Schiller & =
Flexner, who is representing Fastow.=20
No slouch himself, Richard Drubel of the firm's New Hampshire office will h=
andle Fastow's civil defense. Who is Drubel and how did he get the call? Tu=
rns out that he worked at Susman Godfrey, one of Enron's Houston firms, and=
 Drubel was friends with Fastow there. While known for plaintiff suits, Sus=
man Godfrey also has defended Enron.=20
Fastow's case apparently is so complex that he has two other lawyers and la=
w firms -- David Gerger of Foreman, DeGeurin, Nugent & Gerger, who is worki=
ng the Justice Department angle, and Lawrence Iason of Morvillo, Abramowitz=
, Grand, Iason & Silberberg, who is handling the Securities and Exchange Co=
mmission aspect of the investigation.=20
Arthur Andersen has Daniel Kolb and Michael Carroll of Davis Polk & Wardwel=
l. David Duncan, lead partner of Andersen's Enron auditing team until he wa=
s fired, has retained Robert J. Giuffra Jr. and Gandolfo V. "Vince" DiBlasi=
 of Sullivan & Cromwell.=20
Vinson & Elkins, Enron's primary outside law firm with which Enron has many=
 close ties, has turned to a big-gun litigator for its defense: John Villa =
of the District's Williams & Connolly, the lawyer and firm that lawyers and=
 law firms turn to when they're in trouble.=20
I think we've run out of space. Somehow we'll get to the rest of the Enron =
lawyers. Let's stretch this out over several columns. There's plenty of tim=
e. This isn't going away. We could devote a couple of columns to the plaint=
iffs' attorneys. More to come. Stay tuned. To be continued.=20
Antitrust Follies=20
Looking for a little something different? Something not as untoward as the =
Enron debacle? A little bit lighter fare? Then I suggest you turn to the an=
titrust division of the U.S. Justice Department, and the Federal Trade Comm=
ission. Can we find better vaudeville in town than the antics of antitrust =
chief Charles James and FTC Chairman Timothy Muris?=20
You missed the show? It was Jan. 17 when James and Muris called in the news=
 media at the FTC to announce a deal between the Justice Department and the=
 FTC on how to divvy up antitrust review of industry mergers. Now, this sho=
uld have been a no-brainer. The old system is so convoluted and confusing t=
hat Hearsay does not understand how it works.=20
But we'll try to explain it anyway.=20
There are a handful of industries in which both the FTC and Justice Departm=
ent have expertise. So when a hot merger comes up, and the staff of each ag=
ency wants a piece of it, the assistant attorney general for antitrust and =
the FTC chairman have to sort it out. This had been done in an ancient ritu=
al that included a series of athletic events such as arm wrestling, mud wre=
stling, greased-pig wrestling and a bull-riding competition, and an essay c=
ontest.=20
Okay, we're making that up. Well, most of it. The agencies really do write =
essays explaining why they are best to review the mergers. And there really=
 has been a lot of wrangling over who would get to review a merger. The "di=
scussions" would last more than two weeks sometimes, and that's almost half=
 the 30 days in which investigators must decide whether to launch a more de=
tailed review, called a "second request" for documents. Delays of more than=
 15 days occurred 32 times in 2000.=20
The system needed to be fixed.=20
So, what did James and Muris do?=20
First, they came up with what on its face seems like a sensible plan: The J=
ustice Department would get oversight for media, telecommunications and ent=
ertainment industry mergers, while the FTC would get health care, energy an=
d electricity cases.=20
So, they have that good idea. But there's a problem. They devise it in secr=
et. They don't tell many people about it, to keep it a big surprise, or in =
hope that opponents won't be able to stop it. They don't even share the pla=
n with all the other members of the Federal Trade Commission. They keep man=
y of the stakeholders out of the process. And finally -- and this is the fu=
nniest part -- they keep members of Congress out of the loop.=20
This happened once before at the antitrust division. Last time, it was when=
 the Justice Department abandoned the plan to break up Microsoft Corp. Hell=
o? Is anybody home? Did you forget that this is a democracy, with three bra=
nches of government and all?=20
At this point, we reveal that Hearsay is biased: We prefer things be done i=
n the open, in public, where there is a vigorous debate and hashing out of =
all of the ramifications. In the marketplace of ideas, the strong ones prev=
ail. If this truly were a good idea, it would have prevailed. This did not =
have to be controversial.=20
One member of our democracy is Sen. Ernest F. "Fritz" Hollings (D-S.C.). He=
 is chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee. That's a pretty important co=
mmittee. Lots of bills important to the Bush administration go through that=
 committee. James and Muris didn't tell Sen. Hollings about their big plan.=
 That did not please the senator. And, as the senator might say, he squeale=
d like a pig stuck in a gate.=20
His hootin' and hollerin' were enough to halt a signing ceremony scheduled =
for 1 p.m. Jan. 17 as the media waited in a room nearby. In fact, Muris sig=
ned it anyway. James did not. Reporters had press packets, complete with st=
atements hailing the deal. Now it had to be called off.=20
Someone pass the popcorn. This is getting good. Who would have thought that=
 the Bush administration antitrust team would be so entertaining?=20
The news conference was abruptly canceled without explanation. Later, spoke=
swoman Gina Talamona offered a statement saying the plan was a good one, bu=
t Justice Department staff would meet and confer with Congress.=20
So how is the conferring going? Here is a report from a meeting on Thursday=
, as provided by Hollings's press man, Andy Davis. "DOJ staff admitted that=
 they had not consulted with consumer groups in any way before formulating =
their proposal," Davis said in an e-mail. "Additionally, they had no statis=
tical data to demonstrate each agency's expertise. Instead, they relied sol=
ely on anecdotal evidence."=20
Hmmm. Doesn't sound like a very good first meeting.=20
In the meantime, perhaps James and Muris could read up on the U.S. Constitu=
tion. There's a very sobering line in there about appropriations coming fro=
m Congress.=20
What were they thinking? Well, this is a pattern that seems to be developin=
g with our antitrust enforcers. Unlike Robert Pitofsky, the previous FTC ch=
airman, who made an effort to develop consensus on policy questions, James =
and Muris seem to like to keep their best ideas hidden from the public, pol=
iticians and the media. Pitofsky spent more than a year in public developin=
g his plan to require spinoffs of companies and divisions before mergers ar=
e approved.=20
One person involved with the process, however, offers this commentary about=
 Hearsay's thesis: "That's absurd." Rather than a marketplace of ideas, thi=
s is a power play, according to the source. This person says that Pitofsky =
and James's predecessor, Joel Klein, attempted to craft such a deal but fai=
led. The mistake, this person suggests, was to go public with the plan.=20
The idea that secrecy is better than openness is very sad.=20
In some ways, the handling of this resembles James's failure to get nine st=
ates to sign the Microsoft agreement. Most of those attorneys general, with=
 the exception of California's and Massachusetts's, were eager to settle th=
e case. But James failed to build a consensus and moved forward without the=
m. In swinging toward Microsoft's position, James appeared to do little to =
try to address problems that several key attorneys general had with his dea=
l. As a result, damage has been done to the years of work to build amicable=
 relations between federal and state antitrust enforcers.=20
Too simplistic? Maybe. After all, Hearsay doesn't pretend to be as smart as=
 Muris and James.=20
Look at this way: From a spectator's standpoint, it has been quite a show.=
=20
Big Billings=20
So, you think Sen. Robert G. Torricelli (D-N.J.) got off scot-free? Hardly.=
 The penalty is steep when you're under investigation, even when charges ar=
en't filed.=20
Torricelli's latest congressional filing shows that his legal bills totaled=
 more than $1.37 million in 13 months.=20
The bills will continue to accumulate as the Senate Ethics Committee consid=
ers U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White's three-year investigation into his politic=
al fundraising. The case closed this month without charges against the sena=
tor, but seven people were convicted of making illegal contributions to his=
 1996 campaign.=20
So far, Torricelli has the bills covered: He's raised about $1.54 million.=
=20
Who wins? The lawyers, of course. In the fourth-quarter filing, the first-p=
lace finisher is Ted Wells Jr. of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison,=
 whose firm billed $195,750. Second place goes to Abbe David Lowell of Mana=
tt, Phelps & Phillips, which billed $20,000.=20
Other billers for the final three months of 2001 include Sidley Austin Brow=
n & Wood ($10,000), Zuckerman Spaeder ($10,000), Pierce Atwood ($10,000), a=
nd Winston & Strawn ($10,000). Torricelli's ex-wife, Susan Torricelli, also=
 got a piece of the legal defense fund: $5,000.=20
Hearsay tries to build consensus every other Monday in Washington Business.=

Accounting for Enron: White House Resists Detailing Cheney, Enron Discussio=
ns
By Jeanne Cummings
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

01/28/2002
The Wall Street Journal
A4
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration, struggling to manage the political f=
allout of the collapse of Enron Corp., is walking a tightrope between aggre=
ssive disclosure of government ties to the firm and adamant opposition to r=
eleasing the details of Vice President Dick Cheney's private meetings with =
Enron officials.=20
In an appearance on Fox News yesterday, Mr. Cheney said the White House wil=
l go to court to block the General Accounting Office, Congress's investigat=
ive arm, from learning what was discussed in six meetings he and his staff =
held this past year with executives of the Houston energy-trading concern, =
which filed for U.S. bankruptcy-court protection this past month. Three of =
those meetings occurred while the vice president's office was drafting the =
administration's national energy policy.
Meanwhile, on Friday, the Office of Management and Budget asked the General=
 Services Administration to re-evaluate all government contracts with Enron=
 and its auditors, Arthur Andersen LLP. An OMB senior aide said the work co=
uld include as many as 100 contracts with a total value of about $70 millio=
n.=20
Both actions come as public polls suggest Enron could become a political is=
sue for President Bush and his party going into the midterm elections this =
fall. A New York Times poll released yesterday found 58% of respondents sai=
d they think the White House is mostly telling the truth but probably is hi=
ding something. Republican veterans in Washington worry that the White Hous=
e showdown over the meetings between Mr. Cheney and his staff with Enron of=
ficials could nurture those suspicions.=20
Chief of Staff Andrew Card said on NBC's "Meet the Press" that a compromise=
 is still possible with the GAO. But Mr. Cheney said the White House decide=
d in August that it would fight the disclosures in court rather than yield =
on the principle that the vice president should be able to receive private =
advice from outside experts while formulating policy. The Enron saga, he sa=
id, shouldn't be allowed to "undermine" the White House's position.=20
"The president's bound and determined to defend those principles and to pas=
s on this office, his and mine, to future generations in better shape than =
when we found it," the vice president said. "For us to compromise on this b=
asic, fundamental principle would, in effect, do that. It would further wea=
ken the presidency, and we don't want to do that."=20
Further, Mr. Cheney characterized the GAO as a pawn of Rep. Henry A. Waxman=
 (D., Calif.), who has taken the lead on Capitol Hill in scrutinizing Enron=
's sway on the administration's energy policy, which was released this past=
 spring.=20
On Friday, Mr. Waxman's office released records that suggest a State Depart=
ment energy plan was amended by the White House to add a provision urging t=
he U.S. government to use its influence with India to maximize development =
of natural gas in that country, where Enron has a natural-gas-fired power p=
lant. The draft was changed after a meeting between the vice president's of=
fice and Enron officials, according to Mr. Waxman's staff.=20
OMB Director Mitch Daniels's call for a review of all Enron and Arthur Ande=
rsen government contracts was prompted by disclosures of shredded documents=
, even after an investigation into Enron's financial accounting was launche=
d by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Daniels said both firms no=
w may be ineligible for government work based on a Federal Acquisition Regu=
lation provision that says a business contracting with the government must =
have a "satisfactory record of business ethics and integrity."=20
Mr. Daniels said the GSA should analyze whether Arthur Andersen and Enron a=
re qualified for future contracts, and "consideration should be given to th=
e initiation of suspensions or disbarment proceedings for all, or a part, o=
f Arthur Andersen and Enron as appropriate."=20
Arthur Andersen spokesman Patrick Dorton said, "We have a demonstrated trac=
k record of excellent performance for government clients. We will certainly=
 address any questions and would welcome the opportunity to discuss our str=
ong history in government consulting."=20
An Enron spokesman said he was unaware of any formal investigation but woul=
d respond to any request for information.=20
The two firms' government work doesn't appear to constitute a large part of=
 their businesses. Enron, once the largest energy trading business in the w=
orld, has a $25 million contract to run the utilities at Fort Hamilton in B=
rooklyn, N.Y., which army officials said is already under review.=20
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy (D., Vt.) in the past =
week questioned the appropriateness of an Arthur Andersen contract with the=
 Federal Bureau of Investigation since the auditing firm is now part of a J=
ustice Department criminal probe of the Enron collapse. The $700,000 manage=
ment-consulting contract is for work Andersen is doing to help reorganize t=
he FBI and could provide them with access to confidential and sensitive doc=
uments, Mr. Leahy said.

Ideas & Trends: Power House
Greed, Pain, Excesses. Oh, What a Lovely Issue.
By RICHARD L. BERKE

01/27/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON -- ONCE they express their requisite sympathy for stockholders a=
nd investors in Enron, many Democrats are downright giddy over the company'=
s implosion. Not since Watergate and Richard M. Nixon's cozying up to corpo=
rate bigwigs wielding bags of money, they say, has their party had such an =
ideal vehicle to arouse the citizenry and skewer a Republican president as =
favoring monied interests.=20
''It's Teapot Dome,'' said Jim Hightower, the former Texas agriculture comm=
issioner who has built a career on speaking for the disenfranchised. ''It's=
 a perfect populist crusade.'' Though, unlike the Harding administration sc=
andal, no one in this administration is known to have acted illegally regar=
ding Enron.
Stanley B. Greenberg, who helped devise a populist theme for Al Gore in the=
 2000 presidential campaign, said the Democrats' rallying cry in the Novemb=
er elections should be: ''The greed is real. The pain is real. The excesses=
 are real.''=20
And the reality is that the issue could be potent for the Democrats, though=
 some are wary of rushing headlong into making Enron a political issue and =
caution that the company spread its bounty to both parties. Yet Enron was f=
ar more generous to Republicans and has closer ties with Republican officia=
ls in government.=20
Republicans are especially vulnerable because Enron reinforces the long-hel=
d perception that their's is the party of big business and the rich. The Wh=
ite House is already a target because the administration is stocked with of=
ficials formerly involved with the oil industry in Texas. Even religious co=
nservatives, a powerful constituency for the Republican Party, are grousing=
 that their president is showing more fealty to corporate titans than Chris=
tian leaders.=20
Adding to the image of a party more attuned to corporate interests than ord=
inary Americans was the recent election of Marc Racicot as Republican Party=
 chairman. He refused to sever his ties to a law firm that has lobbied exte=
nsively for Enron and other companies. The latest New York Times/CBS News P=
oll, published today, underscores the image of a White House run by the upp=
er crust. It reports that 61 percent of Americans say big business has too =
much influence in the administration. And 50 percent said the administratio=
n's policies favor the rich; only 14 percent said they favor the middle cla=
ss.=20
Democrats may have the best opportunity to capitalize on Enron if they do n=
ot retreat to the simplistic anti-big business slogans of decades past. Nea=
rly a century ago, President Theodore Roosevelt scored by demonizing the St=
andard Oil Company as representing the evils of the newly sprouting corpora=
te giants -- and shattering it into 34 pieces.=20
While the age of trustbusting is long gone, Democrats could portray Enron a=
s symbolizing the evils of a new corporate economy fostered by giant stock =
purchases and multinational companies. They can expand their argument and p=
oint to other disastrous business collapses, like Kmart, as evidence that c=
orporations are running roughshod over working people. ''If they're smart, =
the Democrats' strategy should be to make Bush into another shifty-eyed J. =
R. Ewing,'' said Kevin Phillips, the political analyst who wrote ''The Poli=
tics of Rich and Poor.'' ''If they dig deep enough, they can strike gold: t=
hat this guy has been up to his neck in every facet of the oil business in =
Texas, and it often hasn't reflected well in his judgment.''=20
But turning Enron into a big-business-versus-the-little-people bonanza for =
the Democrats could be more knotty than it seems -- and not just because En=
ron spread its largess to Democrats as well.=20
For one thing, Democrats can no longer fully disassociate themselves from i=
ndustry. President Clinton courted big business -- and it was his White Hou=
se that presided over an era of prosperity for corporate America.=20
There is also a history of populist crusades falling flat. Most recently, v=
oters were not altogether convinced in the 2000 campaign when Mr. Gore ridi=
culed the Bush tax cut proposal as ''a form of class warfare on behalf of b=
illionaires.''=20
In the 1980's, the Democrats' drive to make villains of junk bond trading f=
irms backfired, as did President Harry S. Truman's brazen seizure of big st=
eel companies in 1952. ''Standing up for the little guy will always be part=
 of Democratic Party politics,'' said Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana, chairma=
n of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council. ''But we suffer from the s=
tereotype of resenting people who have been successful even if they have do=
ne nothing wrong. We don't want to play into that stereotype.''=20
There is no question that Enron can help Democrats stir up the party faithf=
ul, just like Whitewater galvanized hard-core conservatives. The question i=
s whether the Democrats can broaden the appeal of the issue.=20
To do so, they cannot merely repeat the party's mantra that Republicans fav=
or the rich, but would have to take the argument to the next step: not only=
 that Republicans are responding to corporate interests, but that they are =
doing so at the expense of ordinary citizens. Even some religious conservat=
ives have accused the administration of overlooking their interests in favo=
r of big business. Many were furious when, at the Republican Party's winter=
 meeting in Austin, Tex., this month, the party installed Lewis Eisenberg, =
an abortion rights activist who has contributed to Democrats, to head the p=
arty's drive to raise money. Mr. Eisenberg's appeal: he's close to business=
 and knows how to get big donations.=20
''It was a terrible appointment,'' said Gary Bauer, a conservative who ran =
for the Republican presidential nomination in 2000. ''Couldn't they find a =
chief fund-raiser who actually agreed with the party's platform?''=20
On the other side of the political spectrum, Mr. Hightower said it would no=
t be sufficient for Democrats to assure voters that ''we're on your side.''=
 He said the party needed to take its argument several steps forward. ''We =
need to wrap up not just the corruption of money in politics but the actual=
 damage to people and pensions and the disrespect for workers and the flim-=
flam of the new economy,'' he said.=20
Recognizing that such populist appeals could succeed, Mr. Bush, in a striki=
ng change of tone, said last week he was outraged by the conduct of Enron, =
and noted that his own mother-in-law had lost more than $8,000 in Enron sha=
res.=20
AS part of their offensive, Republicans are seeking to shift the spotlight =
to Democrats who took Enron donations, and they portray the Enron debacle a=
s a business scandal with no partisan bounds. In fact, White House official=
s are questioning why regulators in the Clinton administration did not pick=
 up on the transgressions at Enron.=20
Dismissing the Democrats as trying to politicize the Enron collapse, Dan Ba=
rtlett, the White House communications director, said, ''The American peopl=
e are savvy enough to understand the difference between political rhetoric =
and fact -- and the fact is that the administration did not make any attemp=
ts to help Enron.''=20
James Carville, the Democratic consultant, countered that the question is n=
ot whether the administration acted to save Enron. ''It's not what they did=
 when they went belly up,'' he said. ''It's what they did when Enron had mo=
ney.''=20
But, like many other Democrats, Mr. Carville is not free of Enron entanglem=
ents. He said he agreed to deliver a speech last October for the corporatio=
n for his usual big fee. The company went belly up, so he never could offer=
 his words of wisdom. But chances are, his remarks would not have been abou=
t corporate greed.

How a Top Medical Researcher Became Entangled With Enron
By JO THOMAS with REED ABELSON

01/28/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 3
c. 2002 New York Times Company

HOUSTON, Jan. 26 -- Travelers at the airports here notice the children, fra=
il and bald, on their way to the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer =
Center, but thousands more arrive unseen, by car. There were 20,000 new pat=
ients last year, including 500 children. Most were from Texas, but others c=
ame from across the nation and the world, hoping for a cure.=20
In the five years since Dr. John Mendelsohn, a respected cancer researcher,=
 became president of M. D. Anderson and began courting wealthy donors, poli=
ticians and volunteers, the cancer center's research budget has grown 71 pe=
rcent and the number of patients has increased by 49 percent. Prominent in =
both Houston and the medical community, he is well spoken, and persuasive, =
about the needs of M. D. Anderson and the promise of his own research. Last=
 fall, when former President George Bush, a longtime supporter, became chai=
rman of the board of visitors, the center raised $10.3 million in a single =
gala at Enron Field.
Now, at what should be the pinnacle of his career, Dr. Mendelsohn finds him=
self in the middle of accusations surrounding two controversial companies: =
Enron, whose collapse is the subject of intense scrutiny by Congress and re=
gulators, and ImClone Systems, a biotechnology company that is being accuse=
d of misleading investors about the possible approval of a drug that Dr. Me=
ndelsohn was instrumental in developing. Dr. Mendelsohn serves on the board=
s of both companies.=20
In an interview this week, Dr. Mendelsohn spoke of his involvement with bot=
h companies. Despite criticism about his ability to serve as a director, re=
presenting shareholders' interests, Dr. Mendelsohn defended his independenc=
e and integrity in his involvement with both companies.=20
While Dr. Mendelsohn's role at ImClone has received less scrutiny, his dire=
ctorship at Enron has been attacked as symbolic of the lack of independence=
 on the board.=20
Joining Enron's board in May 1999 and serving on the audit committee, Dr. M=
endelsohn had a pivotal role in overseeing the company's relationship with =
its auditor, Arthur Andersen, and the integrity of the company's financial =
statements.=20
In addition to questions about whether he had the expertise to serve on the=
 committee, there are concerns that, as a fellow member of the Houston elit=
e with Enron's chairman at the time, Kenneth L. Lay, he was reluctant to qu=
estion management and someone who appeared to be a fellow visionary. Mr. La=
y and his company were also generous contributors to M. D. Anderson.=20
''It's beyond clubiness,'' said Richard H. Koppes, a former shareholder act=
ivist who is now a lawyer at Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue, noting that people=
 who see one another at social events are frequently unable to criticize ea=
ch other. ''These people are human,'' he said.=20
Dr. Mendelsohn brushed aside criticism that he was not independent because =
the cancer center had received donations from Enron. Officials at the cente=
r said it had received $92,508 from the Enron Foundation and the company si=
nce Dr. Mendelsohn joined Enron's board. Mr. Lay, who resigned on Wednesday=
 as Enron's chairman and chief executive, and the Linda and Ken Lay Family =
Foundation also gave M. D. Anderson $240,250 since Dr. Mendelsohn became pr=
esident.=20
''Some of the articles have made it sound like M. D. Anderson was very depe=
ndent on Enron philanthropy to do its work,'' Dr. Mendelsohn said. ''That's=
 far from the case. We've gotten more than that from other companies and pr=
ivate donors.''=20
He added: ''During that same period we've gotten pledges and gifts of more =
than $233 million. Every gift is important, but our operating budget is $1.=
4 billion.''=20
As the president of M. D. Anderson, Dr. Mendelsohn is the public face of th=
e institution and serves as its primary fund-raiser. This week, Dr. Mendels=
ohn said he spent a third of his time raising money to increase the cancer =
center's quality and size.=20
In his role, Dr. Mendelsohn developed close ties to former President George=
 Bush and his wife, Barbara, who lost a child to leukemia. They used their =
joint 75th birthday party in 1999 to raise $10.1 million for the cancer cen=
ter.=20
The Bushes also attended last November's benefit gala, joining 1,900 guests=
. A few weeks before that, George Mitchell, a Texas real estate and natural=
 gas magnate, and his wife, Cynthia, gave M. D. Anderson $20 million to hel=
p build a $174 million basic science research building.=20
And Dr. Mendelsohn has also played a prominent role in Washington, where he=
 has advised President Bush on issues like stem-cell research and the appoi=
ntment of Dr. Andrew C. von Eschenbach, the director of prostate cancer res=
earch at M. D. Anderson, as head of the National Cancer Institute.=20
At the time Mr. Lay named Dr. Mendelsohn to the Enron board, he praised him=
 as ''a visionary in the Houston medical community.'' Both men served on th=
e board of the Greater Houston Partnership. Last year, Dr. Mendelsohn appea=
red with Jeffrey K. Skilling, then chief executive of Enron, at a Houston p=
anel on the future of technology.=20
It seemed like a natural alliance, Dr. Mendelsohn said, because M. D. Ander=
son was ''an important contributor to the well-being of Houston'' and Enron=
 was one of the city's major companies. ''They invited me on the board to t=
ake advantage of certain experience I've had, and I was pleased to accept,'=
' he said.=20
He was soon active in many of the board's most controversial decisions -- t=
he approval in June and October 1999 of the partnerships with the company's=
 chief financial officer at the time, Andrew S. Fastow, and the decision to=
 suspend the company's own code of ethics so Mr. Fastow could serve as the =
general partner of the partnerships. As a member of the audit committee, Dr=
. Mendelsohn was also responsible for reviewing the transactions between th=
e partnerships and Enron in February 2000 and February 2001.=20
''I can't get into details about Enron, because there are a lot of matters =
under investigation,'' he said.=20
But Dr. Mendelsohn has been criticized for not having the appropriate finan=
cial background to serve on Enron's board, especially its audit committee. =
Patrick McGurn, a vice president at Institutional Shareholder Services, whi=
ch advises large investors on corporate governance, said that, when it come=
s to business, there were limits on the capabilities of even the smartest d=
octor. ''At a certain point in time, you are a doctor, and that's your trai=
ning,'' he said. ''You're probably a businessman secondarily.''=20
As head of M. D. Anderson, Dr. Mendelsohn said he was well qualified to be =
an Enron director: ''I am the head of a large organization with a large bud=
get and have had to deal with budget and growth issues. I've relied on supe=
rb business people to work with me. I haven't arranged complicated derivati=
ve deals, but I have been involved in management and growth.''=20
Dr. Mendelsohn has not been the only beneficiary of Enron at M. D. Anderson=
, but he is the most visible. His predecessor, Dr. Charles A. LeMaistre, 77=
, who was president of the cancer center for 18 years, is also an Enron dir=
ector. In 1993, the Enron Foundation pledged $1.5 million to a building cam=
paign, and the Enron Corporation Cancer Screening/Early Detection Clinic wa=
s named in honor of Dr. LeMaistre. So far, officials said, the Enron Founda=
tion has paid $900,000 of what it promised.=20
At ImClone, where he has been a director since 1998, Dr. Mendelsohn's prese=
nce has added to the company's credibility. Within medical circles, he is h=
eld in high regard. ''He is an eminent researcher and has a reputation of b=
eing an excellent leader and administrator,'' said Diana Petitti, vice chai=
rwoman of the National Cancer Policy Board, where Dr. Mendelsohn is also a =
member.=20
Much of the company's promise has to do with the potential of what could be=
 a revolutionary cancer treatment, C-225, the experimental drug whose devel=
opment Dr. Mendelsohn pioneered. ImClone's stock price took off when the dr=
ug seemed to work in clinical trials. The decision, in September, by Bristo=
l-Myers Squibb to pay as much as $2 billion for a 20 percent stake in ImClo=
ne and rights to the drug, named Erbitux, seemed to confirm that optimism.=
=20
In late December, the stock, which had peaked earlier in the month at $75.4=
5, plunged after ImClone announced that the Food and Drug Administration ha=
d refused to even consider the company's application for permission to mark=
et the drug. Although company executives contended that the agency's only r=
eal concern was a lack of certain documentation, The Cancer Letter, a newsl=
etter in Washington, obtained a copy of the F.D.A.'s letter to ImClone and =
reported that the agency's concerns had been more extensive, even as ImClon=
e continued to assure people it was in sync with the agency. On Jan. 18, Co=
ngress announced an investigation.=20
The shares, which had recovered somewhat, fell 16 percent on Friday, to $16=
.49, after the company said it had received inquiries from both the Justice=
 Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission.=20
Dr. Mendelsohn was among the shareholders who had cashed out a portion of t=
heir stock when Bristol bought its stake. Dr. Mendelsohn said he was told a=
t a board meeting to sell 20 percent of his stock, the percentage Bristol w=
as buying. He exercised options on 90,226 shares and received $6.3 million =
of the $149.7 million the original stockholders received from Bristol, all =
of whom had the option to sell some of their stock at $70 a share. His busi=
ness partners, who had borrowed to invest even more heavily in ImClone, rec=
eived the lion's share.=20
As a scientific adviser to ImClone, Dr. Mendelsohn's role in promoting ImCl=
one and the drug is unclear. Although his involvement added credibility in =
the early years, according to Jason Kantor, an analyst with J. P. Morgan, t=
he participation of Dr. Leonard B. Saltz in the clinical trials at the Memo=
rial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan had more weight in persuadi=
ng people the drug might be effective.=20
Dr. Mendelsohn denied he was overly enthusiastic about the drug's promise. =
''Personally, I've never done anything but describe the merits of the antib=
ody and its results,'' he said. ''I've given lots of lectures. I stressed, =
and it's in print, that this is an experiment.''=20
''I get a lot of calls from people asking me, 'Should I invest? Should I in=
vest?' '' he continued. ''I always say it's an experiment. It's well along,=
 but until we prove to the F.D.A. that this is a satisfactory anticancer ag=
ent, it's an experiment.''=20
Dr. Mendelsohn said he had been careful to avoid any conflict of interest w=
ith ImClone. ''I give a lot of speeches,'' he said, ''and I always state th=
at I am on the board of ImClone and I own stock in the company. I always sa=
y this.'' He said he always took note of these connections in his publicati=
ons about the drug. He takes no money from the corporation for his own rese=
arch, and he does not prescribe C-225 to his own patients.=20
But Dr. Mendelsohn is a paid consultant to ImClone, creating what corporate=
 governance experts view as another threat to his ability to serve as an in=
dependent director. Last year, he was paid $12,000 for his work as a scient=
ific adviser, he said, more than the $10,000 he received as a director. He =
also received 30,000 stock options, which are not vested.=20
And Dr. Mendelsohn serves as an adviser to other companies, including Brist=
ol-Myers and assorted biotechnology concerns.=20
Although Dr. Mendelsohn does not serve on the boards of any other companies=
, he is on the board of a new venture capital fund, the Scientia Health Gro=
up, which plans to invest in health-related ideas and involves ImClone's ma=
nagement. ''I have only a modest knowledge'' of the fund, he said, noting i=
t had only one meeting.''=20
Dr. Mendelsohn acknowledged that the role of a director is much less appeal=
ing these days. His directorships at Enron and ImClone are taking so much o=
f his time, he said, ''I'm probably not going to be on any other board.''

Patents
While Enron's future is uncertain, its trademarked name could live on for a=
 decade.
By Sabra Chartrand

c. 2002 New York Times Company

ENRON'S future as a business enterprise is uncertain, but its name could li=
ve on for 10 years -- as a trademark, at least.=20
Enron moved a step closer to winning a trademark for its tilted ''E'' logo =
last week when the United States Office of Patents and Trademarks published=
 the company's application in the office's Official Gazette. Such publicati=
on is a routine part of the process, providing notification of pending trad=
emarks and giving the public a chance to oppose them if a case can be made.
Trademarks are valid for 10 years, and can be renewed for 10-year periods t=
hereafter. Five years after a trademark is granted, however, the owner must=
 file an affidavit stating that the trademark is in use. So if Enron dissol=
ved completely, it would be difficult for the company to maintain its trade=
marks or win renewals.=20
In the application published last week the company requested a trademark on=
 the stylized ''E'' in June, specifying that ''the word 'Enron' and the low=
er element of the letter 'E' are blue, the middle element of the letter 'E'=
 is green, and the top element of the letter 'E' is red.''=20
Despite the company's having filed for bankruptcy in early December, Enron =
has so many pending trademark applications that the trademark office contin=
ued throughout December and January to churn out requests for further infor=
mation, amendments and publication notices. On Jan. 15, the agency awarded =
a trademark to Enron for ''E Enron, Enron Field,'' a logo that refers to th=
e Houston sports stadium and is intended to cover ''information relating to=
 sporting events and related activities by means of a global computer netwo=
rk.''=20
Some of Enron's trademarks and pending trademarks appear to be better candi=
dates for selling or transferring to another company than others. Ten days =
after Enron declared bankruptcy, its application for a trademark on the ter=
m ''Espeak'' was approved and another for ''Ethink'' passed a final review.=
 A third, for ''Emeet'' was being opposed. All the trademarks were intended=
 to cover ''an employee communication program via transmission of messages =
among computer users, namely, an online electronic forum for knowledge shar=
ing, idea generation, creative problem solving and collaboration.'' Theoret=
ically, any number of companies might be interested in taking them off Enro=
n's hands.=20
But for the moment, Enron has no plans to abandon its trademarks or pending=
 applications.=20
''I know that for now, such rights are being maintained,'' said Scott Brown=
, a Houston lawyer who handles Enron's trademark applications. ''One thing =
we're doing on the trademark side is making sure we don't lose any marks du=
ring the bankruptcy period,'' Mr. Brown said. ''I think the bankruptcy cour=
t would govern any continuing work on behalf of Enron.''=20
That might include processing applications for a number of advertising slog=
ans, like ''One Stop Energy Shop'' and ''Puts the Energy into E-Commerce.''=
 Enron has also asked for trademarks on catch phrases like ''Investing Our =
Energy in Your Business'' and ''Click on Your Power'' for its energy manage=
ment services. Some slogans -- like ''Enron Earth Smart Wind,'' for electri=
cal power distribution -- might seem to make sense only to the people who d=
reamed them up.=20
Other pending trademarks include ''Enron Etelligence,'' ''Enron Envest'' an=
d ''Enron Enpower'' -- all intended to promote Enron's ''financial risk man=
agement for energy related facilities.''=20
Investors hoping to recoup money from any of Enron's remaining assets proba=
bly should not look to the company's patent portfolio.=20
When Enron declared bankruptcy, it held 20 patents that had been assigned t=
o it by various inventors. Much of the value is tied to the shelf life of t=
hose patents, and most were issued in the 1980's -- meaning they are due to=
 expire in the next few years. The first to lapse will be patent 4,629,657 =
for a ''biaxially oriented polypropylene film construction for special lami=
nation,'' which was granted in 1986 and will expire in 2004.=20
Seventeen of the patents were issued between 1986 and 1990, and several of =
those were assigned to the Enron Chemical Company and the Enron LNG Develop=
ment Corporation. The Enron Corporation was formed in 1985 with the merger =
of Houston Natural Gas and an Omaha company called InterNorth. The two earl=
ier companies won 26 patents between 1976 and 1985, and Enron may have inhe=
rited some or all of those. But since they were granted 17-year terms, the =
last will expire this year.=20
Many companies count patents as intangible assets, which generate income th=
rough licensing fees and royalties. The value, of course, derives from the =
fact that a patent grants exclusive rights to the holder for 17 to 20 years=
, depending on when it was issued. Most of Enron's patents are unlikely to =
have much appeal to competitors or clients because they are already too old=
 to offer long-term exclusivity. And it is possible that many of them will =
expire before all the legal proceedings around Enron come to an end.=20
The value of the Enron patents is also limited by the fact that they do not=
 cover universal technologies. The two dozen inventors working on behalf of=
 Enron conducted research in very specific areas. Only certain investors or=
 licensees would probably be interested in a ''ship-based system for compre=
ssed natural gas transport'' (patent 5,803,005), a ''direct fuel-fired furn=
ace arrangement for the recovery of gallium and germanium from coal fly ash=
'' (patent 4,643,110) or a ''method of forming a press-fitted pipe joint'' =
(patent 4,769,897).

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE WEEK THAT WAS
A Suicide and a Resignation as the Formal Inquiries Get Under Way
By TOM REDBURN

01/27/2002
The New York Times
Page 32, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

Until Friday, the Enron affair seemed to be a scandal focused on lost money=
, tainted politics and misleading accounting. But then it turned tragic.=20
At the end of a week of high drama in Houston and Washington, J. Clifford B=
axter, a former Enron vice chairman, was found dead in his locked car not f=
ar from his home in a Houston suburb. It was ruled a suicide.
Friends and associates said that Mr. Baxter, who left the company in May, h=
ad clashed last spring with Jeffrey K. Skilling, who was Enron's chief exec=
utive at the time.=20
Mr. Baxter had ''complained mightily'' about the ''inappropriateness'' of E=
nron's financial practices, according to Sherron S. Watkins, the whistleblo=
wer whose August letter to Kenneth L. Lay, the Enron chairman, outlining th=
e accounting practices that ultimately brought down the company surfaced ea=
rlier this month.=20
Mr. Baxter was said by friends to be distraught in recent days over his ina=
bility to end the abuses that led to the collapse of the company.=20
''It makes it real,'' a neighbor of Mr. Baxter said -- ''it'' being the Enr=
on scandal, no longer esoteric.=20
THE CHAIRMAN QUITS -- Under pressure from creditors, Mr. Lay ended his long=
 tenure as leader of the company he created and began his new career as a d=
efendant in lawsuits, a witness before Congressional committees and a poten=
tial target of criminal investigations.=20
The questions about Enron's partnerships and accounting practices confronti=
ng Mr. Lay, who is scheduled to testify before Congress on Feb. 4, hark bac=
k to the classic Watergate query: What did he know, and when did he know it=
? In Houston, the further question on the minds of Enron workers, and forme=
r workers, is: Why did he continue to encourage employees to buy Enron stoc=
k after he knew that doubts had been raised about the company's books?=20
Mr. Lay, who used to trade birthday cards with President Bush, won't be vis=
iting his old friend at the White House. The president, traveling in West V=
irginia, told reporters that he was outraged that Enron executives misled t=
heir employees and investors -- including his mother-in-law, who lost $8,09=
6, the White House said.=20
Just before Mr. Lay resigned, a former Enron employee, Maureen Castaneda, r=
evealed that people working in the accounting unit had been shredding Enron=
 documents for weeks.=20
CONGRESSIONAL INQUIRIES BEGIN -- Two panels of lawmakers held the first of =
what are expected to be many hearings by the 11 subcommittees looking into =
Enron's failure and its implications.=20
A House subcommittee released evidence suggesting that scores of people wer=
e involved in the destruction of documents at the Houston office of Enron's=
 auditor, Arthur Andersen. Andersen officials continued to say the primary =
blame for the shredding belonged to David B. Duncan, the partner responsibl=
e for the Enron account. Lawmakers were skeptical of that account, but Mr. =
Duncan declined to testify, invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self=
-incrimination. Lawmakers are expected to ask questions about document dest=
ruction at Enron during hearings in early February.=20
CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM ADVANCES -- The quest to ban the unlimited contribu=
tions to the political parties known as soft money was revived last week by=
 Enron's collapse and the tales of how it spread nearly $6 million in campa=
ign donations across Washington since 1989. More than half of the contribut=
ions were soft money.=20
Advocates of overhauling the nation's campaign finance laws gained enough s=
upport to force a House vote on legislation that would make the most wide-r=
anging change in the law since the Watergate era. The insurgents made their=
 move, a defeat for the House Republican leadership, on the second day of t=
he new Congressional session, collecting the final signatures needed on a p=
etition to send the bill to the floor.=20
For all the expressions of outrage on Capitol Hill at last week's hearings,=
 critics argued that Congress shared responsibility for Enron's demise. Of =
the 248 senators and members of Congress serving on the investigating commi=
ttees, 212 have received campaign contributions from Enron or Arthur Anders=
en. In recent weeks, many politicians have scrambled to erase any financial=
 connections to Enron. They have donated the company's contributions to cha=
ritable causes or to a fund established to assist former Enron employees.=
=20
CONNECTIONS TO BUSH OFFICIALS -- Former Enron employees said that they had =
warned senior executives of evidence that a major division of the company h=
ad overstated its profits by hundreds of millions of dollars. For three yea=
rs, the division's No. 2 executive was Thomas E. White, who left Enron last=
 June to become Secretary of the Army.=20
Mr. White, who owned more Enron stock than any other senior official joinin=
g the Bush administration, disclosed that he held between $25 million and $=
50 million in Enron stock and a like amount in stock options when he joined=
 the administration. Mr. White, who also said he had had 30 ''personal'' co=
ntacts with Enron employees since last June, sold the shares over an extend=
ed period of time under a government ethics agreement.=20
Associates of Karl Rove, President Bush's top political adviser, revealed t=
hat Mr. Rove had recommended the Republican strategist Ralph Reed to Enron =
for a lucrative consulting contract as Mr. Bush was weighing whether to run=
 for president. The move was intended to keep Mr. Reed loyal to the Bush ca=
mpaign, they said, without putting him on the Bush payroll. Both Mr. Reed a=
nd Mr. Rove said the Enron contract had nothing to do with the Bush campaig=
n.=20
WALL STREET'S SKINNY -- Confidential partnership records showed that Enron =
executives wore two hats, offering Wall Street deal makers, banks, insuranc=
e companies, and wealthy investors detailed information about Enron's inner=
 workings and off-the-books holdings that was denied to company shareholder=
s. With the information, Enron enticed the investors to pour cash into one =
of the partnerships that helped wreck the company by dangling the prospect =
that they could double their money in less than a year.=20
Finance experts called the deal shocking, but probably legal, and said it d=
emonstrated the unintended consequences of securities laws meant to level t=
he market playing field, rather than tilt it toward privileged investors. T=

Police Probe Ex-Enron Executive's Death --- Baxter, an Apparent Suicide, Wo=
rked to Sell Assets Of Energy-Trading Firm
By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Rebecca Smith, Alexei Barrionuevo an=
d Tom Hamburger

01/28/2002

(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

The former Enron Corp. executive who was found dead Friday had been engaged=
 in the difficult task of trying to sell off assets as the company's financ=
es started to take a turn for the worse.=20
Police investigators in Sugar Land, Texas, said they are continuing their i=
nvestigation into the death of former Enron Vice Chairman J. Clifford Baxte=
r, who quit the company in May before a string of negative events became pu=
blic and propelled the Houston energy company into U.S. bankruptcy court la=
st month.
Mr. Baxter was found at 2:23 a.m. Friday morning in his 2002 black Mercedes=
 Benz with a gunshot wound to the head. The car, which police said containe=
d a handgun, was parked in a median about a mile from Mr. Baxter's newly bu=
ilt home that he shared with his wife and two children in the affluent plan=
ned community of Sugar Land, about 30 miles southwest of Houston.=20
Police quickly put out a press release with the headline "Suicide," only la=
ter in the day changing it to read "Death Investigation." Following an auto=
psy, the Harris County Medical Examiner's office said Mr. Baxter's death wa=
s consistent with a suicide. But police spokeswoman Pat Whitty said yesterd=
ay that "in spite of the fact the medical examiner believes it's a suicide,=
 we're still processing the car, gun, hair and fibers . . . to ensure it wa=
s a suicide." Authorities haven't released the note.=20
Those who knew Mr. Baxter, who was 43 years old, expressed shock and disbel=
ief that he should have taken his own life. A former U.S. Air Force captain=
 and investment banker, Mr. Baxter joined Enron in 1991 and quickly became =
a leading dealmaker for the company, according to one person who worked clo=
sely with him. When Enron later became burdened with poorly performing asse=
ts, he was charged with helping dispose of assets, particularly ones overse=
as.=20
In that latter role, Mr. Baxter would have been privy to a wealth of inform=
ation on Enron's hundreds of partnerships and special entities, through whi=
ch the company pumped up profits and kept debt off its balance sheet. Peopl=
e close to the matter say Mr. Baxter found it difficult to sell many of the=
se assets and was bothered by the fact so many were worth less than their b=
ook value.=20
Some of the partnerships that apparently came to his attention were ones in=
 which other senior officers may have had an ownership interest. Federal in=
vestigators are looking into arrangements that involved Enron's former chie=
f financial officer, Andrew Fastow, and possibly others, including the form=
er corporate treasurer, Ben Glisan.=20
Those who knew Mr. Baxter say he regarded himself as the "integrity guy" at=
 Enron. His name appears in a memo written to former Enron Chairman Kenneth=
 Lay in August by whistle-blower Sherron Watkins warning about a potential =
conflict-of-interest disaster that could be awaiting the company because of=
 the partnerships. Ms. Watkins said Mr. Baxter complained "to all who would=
 listen."=20
Like others at Enron, Mr. Baxter was being sought by federal investigators =
who are trying to unravel Enron's complex financial arrangements. Mr. Baxte=
r had been given legal representation, paid for by Enron, through the law f=
irm of Swidler Berlin Shereff Friedman.=20
Mr. Baxter's attorney, Michael Levy, also is representing Enron's chief acc=
ounting officer, Rick Causey. Mr. Levy declined to discuss the case but ins=
tead criticized reporters and politicians for sullying Enron's name. He sai=
d the case "can only truly be understood after months of careful and delibe=
rative investigation. Putting this kind of media spotlight on the topic doe=
sn't help answer those questions any faster."=20
On Wednesday, Mr. Levy was contacted by investigators from the House Energy=
 and Commerce Committee who requested an interview with Mr. Baxter. However=
, no interview date had been set. Earlier this month, Mr. Baxter also recei=
ved a subpoena for Enron-related documents from a Senate Government Affairs=
 subcommittee. It is unclear which, if any, documents he may have turned ov=
er to the panel.=20
Just what Mr. Baxter's mental state was prior to his death is uncertain. Pe=
ople who knew him said he continued to work out and spent time on his 72-fo=
ot Viking yacht, the Tranquility. He continued to do community work, notabl=
y for Junior Achievement.=20
Yet one friend said Mr. Baxter obviously was shaken by what happened at Enr=
on, a company he felt he had helped build. "It wasn't unusual for Cliff to =
be dramatically affected by things," this person said. "That was just his w=
ay. He would obsess over details. That's why he was such a good investment =
banker.=20
"He was trying to get some distance from the situation," this person added,=
 "but his personality wouldn't let him."=20
Mr. Baxter was seen as particularly close with former Enron Chief Executive=
 Jeffrey Skilling, who plucked the one-time PaineWebber dealmaker out of En=
ron's Washington, D.C., office where he worked for the natural-gas side of =
the company. Mr. Skilling, impressed by Mr. Baxter's talent as a negotiator=
, brought him to Enron's Capital and Trade Resources unit -- the engine of =
the company's go-go growth during the 1990s.=20
Mr. Baxter left Enron to work at Koch Industries, a conglomerate with a hea=
vy interest in energy, in 1995 for less than three months in the company's =
equities group, which was based in Wichita, Kan. But he returned to Enron a=
nd in 1998 was instrumental in the purchase of Portland General Electric, a=
n Oregon utility. This was supposed to have been Enron's springboard into t=
he Western power market, especially California, which had just been deregul=
ated. But the plan never panned out, and Mr. Baxter soon found himself look=
ing for a buyer for Portland General.=20
On Friday, four policemen stood guard on the steps of Mr. Baxter's red bric=
k house in Sugar Land, a town named for the cane fields it once contained. =
They turned away reporters seeking comment from Mrs. Baxter and family frie=
nds on hand.=20
Neighbors said the Baxters kept pretty much to themselves and often were aw=
ay.=20
Mr. Baxter spent most weekends on his motorboat and one neighbor said the f=
amily spent most of last summer cruising the Caribbean, arriving back home =
just a few days before school started for Mr. Baxter's fifth-grade daughter=
 and high-school-aged son. "When he retired, we figured we would see a lot =
more of him," said Tom Swonke, a next-door neighbor. "But we didn't."=20
After the scandal broke, one Enron official pointed out, Mr. Baxter would s=
ometimes chat with Mr. Skilling and others he had worked with, and they buo=
yed each other's spirits. But those conversations evidently became less fre=
quent when attorneys advised senior Enron executives facing potential class=
-action lawsuits and criminal inquiries that they shouldn't be in contact a=
ny longer.=20
One person who was close with Mr. Baxter at Enron noted he had seemed "in p=
retty good shape the last time I talked to him," a few days before his deat=
h. Still, this person said, Mr. Baxter had lamented of late: "This is all g=
oing to have a really bad ending."=20

HOUSTON, Jan. 26 -- Cliff Baxter was supposed to be on a boat right now, fl=
oating on some endless expanse of blue water beneath endless blue skies. Th=
at was the party line when he left Enron last May as vice chairman, and if =
former colleagues now say it was never that simple, they nonetheless expect=
ed him to be living the good life.=20
The son of a police sergeant, Mr. Baxter was getting out of Enron as a rich=
 man at a time when his vision for the company apparently clashed with thos=
e of many of its top executives. He had helped create the company's centerp=
iece business, its energy trading operations, and had risen to vice chairma=
n, a grand title for a man from ordinary beginnings.
He had a loving wife and two children and a big new house in an exclusive s=
uburb. He could afford to do anything, or nothing at all.=20
But if Mr. Baxter left Enron months before trouble engulfed the company, th=
ose troubles seemed to be engulfing him when he was found dead early Friday=
 morning, shot once in the head. An autopsy was completed on Friday, and th=
e death has been ruled a suicide, a representative of the Harris County Med=
ical Examiner's Office said today.=20
Mr. Baxter had been subpoenaed by Congress to testify about Enron, and inve=
stigators hoped he would be a helpful witness against his former peers sinc=
e his name had surfaced as someone who had complained ''mightily'' about th=
e financial partnerships now at the center of the company's collapse. He ha=
d also been named as a defendant in a shareholder lawsuit.=20
His anguish became evident to those who bumped into him in recent weeks. Pe=
ople who saw him at the Houston Yacht Club, where until recently Mr. Baxter=
 kept a boat, Tranquility Base, noticed that his salt-and-pepper hair had t=
urned mostly white between December and January, said the club's president,=
 Chuck Buckner.=20
''Cliff was a guy who clearly seemed to be very concerned that people would=
 think ill of him whether he'd done anything wrong or not,'' said Mr. Buckn=
er, a partner with Ernst & Young. At the club's Christmas party in December=
, Mr. Buckner said, he and Mr. Baxter spoke only in general terms about Enr=
on.=20
''I thought he was a man who'd got out on time, but a man who'd be concerne=
d about what happened to the company,'' Mr. Buckner said. ''He worked reall=
y hard. This was the son of a policeman. This wasn't a rich kid.''=20
The mail carrier in the neighborhood, Veronica DeLaCruz, said that Mr. Baxt=
er's mail had been full of certified letters from law firms in Houston and =
elsewhere in recent months, and that his wife regularly signed for them. Bu=
t in recent weeks, as the certified letters kept coming, no one came to the=
 door to sign.=20
''They were very, very to themselves,'' said a next-door neighbor who spoke=
 on the condition of anonymity. ''They spent most of their time on their ya=
cht.''=20
Police investigators in Sugar Land, the affluent Houston suburb where Mr. B=
axter's body was discovered inside his parked Mercedes-Benz, have refused t=
o reveal the contents of a suicide note he left behind, but CNBC has report=
ed that Mr. Baxter wrote that he was distraught over Enron's disintegration=
 and the prospect of having to testify against friends there.=20
His reputation among friends and colleagues was of a man of high integrity =
who could be an intimidating negotiator, sometimes arrogant and brash in a =
typically Enron mold. He liked expensive cars and motorcycles, and one form=
er colleague, Michael P. Moran, recalled seeing a Ferrari, a Lexus, an S.U.=
V. and more in his parking spot.=20
''He was really pretty typical of what the Enron culture was, although he w=
as a very principled individual,'' said Mr. Moran, a retired general counse=
l of Enron's natural gas pipeline group who is now serving on the creditors=
' committee overseeing the bankruptcy.=20
Mr. Moran said he was shocked by Mr. Baxter's death because he had had neit=
her financial problems nor a major hand in the company's decline. But, he s=
aid, Mr. Baxter had always been concerned about the fate of workers when he=
 was buying or selling companies.=20
''The thought has crossed my mind,'' Mr. Moran said, that the suicide came =
because ''he was so disturbed by all the things that were going on.''=20
Before he left Enron, Mr. Baxter, like many of the company's executives, wa=
s active in charity work, particularly for Junior Achievement of Southeast =
Texas. Jerry V. Mutchler, the group's president, described him as ''very gr=
egarious, a very big thinker and one of those people who thought you should=
 give back.''=20
Mr. Mutchler said Mr. Baxter had raised hundreds of thousands of dollars fo=
r the group because he wanted to help make certain young people ''understoo=
d the values of the free enterprise system.''=20
Doug Leach, a vice president of Enron Global Markets, said one of Mr. Baxte=
r's fund-raisers for Junior Achievement was called Birdies for Charity. A p=
utting green was set up in the Enron lobby for employees who passed by. ''T=
hey would pay to make a putt, and Enron would match the funds,'' Mr. Leach =
said. ''He held his own as a putter. He had fun, he got into it.=20
''That's the part of Cliff I got to know, and that's why this is so sad.''=
=20
Mr. Baxter grew up in working-class Amityville, N.Y., on the south shore of=
 Long Island, one of six children of a father who was a local police sergea=
nt and a mother who worked for the Town of Babylon. He graduated with honor=
s from New York University, became a captain in the Air Force and earned a =
master's degree in business at Columbia University.=20
Arriving at Columbia Business School as a married father recently discharge=
d from the Air Force, Mr. Baxter did not fit the typical profile of an inco=
ming student.=20
Dan Nagao recalled that Mr. Baxter had approached him in an accounting clas=
s after noticing in the student directory that Mr. Nagao, too, had served i=
n the military. They became friends, Mr. Nagao said, and he recalled that M=
r. Baxter had joined a rock band as a guitarist, hustled fellow students in=
 pool and joined investment and entrepreneurial clubs on campus.=20
For years, Mr. Baxter and Mr. Nagao stayed in touch, talking, exchanging e-=
mail messages, swapping Christmas cards. Mr. Baxter talked about his two ch=
ildren and his wife, Carol, whom he had met while in the Air Force, but rar=
ely about his job. Only last year, after Mr. Nagao asked Mr. Baxter what he=
 did for Enron, did Mr. Baxter state, almost sheepishly, that he was the co=
mpany's vice chairman.=20
This year, though, Mr. Nagao said the usual Christmas card with the long, h=
andwritten note and the photo of his family did not arrive from Mr. Baxter.=
 ''It was something simple, but I remember mentioning to my wife that it wa=
s odd,'' said Mr. Nagao, who runs a human resources consulting company in P=
alo Alto, Calif.=20
''I thought, maybe he's busy, maybe he's traveling. I was thinking of calli=
ng him, and just asking him, 'Hey, is everything O.K.?' I regret not doing =
that now.''=20
When Mr. Nagao learned of his friend's death on Friday, he was shocked. ''I=
 don't know what happened, and I would hate to even guess,'' he said. ''We =
thought that Cliff would survive anything.''

The Astros Should Give Some of the Money Back
By GEORGE VECSEY

01/27/2002
The New York Times
Page 6, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

ANY day now, the geniuses who run baseball are going to accept the court ru=
ling that they cannot whack the Minnesota Twins this year.=20
''Never mind our whining about bad teams, shaky finances, unstable future,'=
' they will instruct their staffs. ''Go out and hustle those season tickets=
.''
Selling baseball is going to be a trifle hard in Houston, since folks do no=
t have as much money as they thought they did. Thousands of people have los=
t salaries, stock value and pensions because of the friendly folks from Enr=
on.=20
And anybody who can scrape together a few dollars for a ticket to an Astros=
 game must contemplate walking into Enron Field, named for a company synony=
mous with pumped-up stocks and the shredding of documents.=20
Who wants to go to a ballpark with a name that stinks?=20
Baseball, ostensibly the American pastime, the last bastion of the cheap se=
at, the place where people can go and boo, is now stuck with a name that re=
presents the dangerous friendship between rapacious business and complaisan=
t government.=20
Give it back. That was my first thought when I realized Enron had paid $100=
 million for 30 years to flash its name in lights across the new downtown b=
aseball palace.=20
Most emphatically, the Astros should not cut a check directly to Kenneth L.=
 Lay, Enron's resigned chairman and chief executive. Instead, the club shou=
ld put the money into an account for all the people whose life savings went=
 down the drain after the big people sold their stock and got out, leaving =
the little people once again to hold the bag.=20
The account might provide only quarters per family, but it would be a gestu=
re. At the least, the Astros would not be keeping money that had been spent=
 to glorify Kenneth L. Lay and his house of cards.=20
It's blood money, really.=20
Unfortunately, when I raised the question of giving back the money and the =
name, the Astros said they could not.=20
''We don't have any options,'' said Pam Gardner, the team's president of bu=
siness operations. ''We honor contracts. When you deal with bankruptcy cour=
ts, it's difficult.''=20
According to Gardner, Enron is ''current on payments'' to the club, but she=
 said, ''We're watching the situation carefully.''=20
Apparently, the naming rights to the ballpark can be considered an asset in=
 bankruptcy procedures. Anybody foolish enough to take over the hollow shel=
l of an energy company, even on a penny-for-dollars basis, might be able to=
 stick its own corporate logo on the ball park.=20
Repo Stadium, sponsored by your friendly local repossession agents. That ha=
s a certain ring to it.=20
In the meantime, families and charities, and hospitals and the arts are hur=
ting because they trusted this company that blustered about its smarts and =
hinted broadly at close ties to power.=20
''This is a very sad time in Houston,'' Gardner said. ''This has been devas=
tating to the community.''=20
What stops the management of the Astros from deciding it does not want to b=
e linked to this Enron fiasco? Lawyers, Gardner said.=20
There is no clause in the contract allowing the team to lop off the name in=
 case of adverse publicity and failure to say nothing of the blatant possib=
ility of bad faith.=20
''We do not have that unilateral ability,'' Gardner said.=20
How smart could the Astros' lawyers be? Enron is hardly the first company t=
o go down after making a grandiose commitment to naming rights. There is a =
long list of airlines, 90-day dot-com wonders, banks and other companies th=
at put their names in lights and then tapped out, leaving behind irrelevant=
 logos on downtown skylines. It's an epidemic.=20
These failures ought to be a warning about the risks of increasing synergy =
among major companies. Take money from an energy company and take the chanc=
e of becoming a joke. Buy into a baseball team and suddenly you're a lodge =
brother to Carl Pohlad and Bud Selig and other owners who perform favors fo=
r each other and do not seem to comprehend the meaning of the phrase confli=
ct of interest.=20
Come to think of it, having a naming-rights nightmare in Houston just might=
 fit into the grand poor-mouth strategy of Commissioner Selig and his merry=
 band: ''See, we told you so. Baseball really is in a terrible way.''=20
Maybe the Astros' owners are legally stuck with the name while Congress and=
 the courts and maybe even the feds look into the scandal. But I propose a =
course of passive resistance.=20
The Astros should eliminate the copious use of that disgraced name all over=
 its promotions and brochures. Order new cocktail napkins with no Enron Fie=
ld on them. Tell the public-address announcer to never utter that name agai=
n. Play hardball. Do the bare minimum. Don't insult people who were impover=
ished by flim-flam executives and their docile accountants.=20
Come to think of it: if an energy company can fail, so can electricity itse=
lf. The Enron signs should develop a serious short circuit. What's Enron go=
ing to do, sue? Any lawyers they can afford are surely busy on more importa=
nt fronts.=20
The Astros may not be able to dismantle the sign just yet, but at least the=
 club should cut the power on a shameful name. And when the time comes, the=
 club should donate some money to people who were harmed by Enron.

Planet Of the Privileged
By MAUREEN DOWD

01/27/2002
The New York Times
Page 13, Column 5
c. 2002 New York Times Company

Oh, the pull of Planet Enron.=20
The atmosphere there was so rarefied that its inhabitants were blissfully o=
blivious to how privileged they were.
It was a lovely place, sort of like Aspen with oil rigs. The skiing was gre=
at because there was always a pristine powder of newly shredded financial r=
ecords on the slopes.=20
There was offshore drilling off every shore and offshore subsidiaries on ev=
ery corner.=20
A red flag fluttered on Planet Enron, but nobody paid attention.=20
Journalists in Washington were hunting for Dick Cheney for months, even as =
he was completely visible and accessible on Planet Enron, where he lumbered=
 down golden boulevards.=20
Phil and Wendy Gramm, the king and queen of the Enron prom, cruised around =
in their white stretch limo, rewarded for years of service, exempting and d=
eregulating.=20
Paul O'Neill was also ubiquitous there, his face emblazoned and his words e=
nshrined on the currency, which begins with $1,000 bills. The motto: ''Comp=
anies come and go. It's part of the genius of capitalism.''=20
Mr. O'Neill was not Treasury secretary up there, though, merely a private c=
itizen. Kenneth Lay, still smarting that the president decided not to name =
him Treasury secretary on Earth, anointed himself with the title on Enron.=
=20
The Bushes summered there, and W. and Jeb dropped by when they needed campa=
ign cash. But lately, they began putting brown paper bags over their heads =
when they visited so no one would notice them hobnobbing with Kenny Boy.=20
Everyone was upwardly mobile on Planet Enron, a world more consumed with ha=
vens than have-not's.=20
There were, blessedly, no lower classes or riffraff. Denizens were blue blo=
od or blue chip but never blue. There were the born rich, and there were th=
e new rich the born rich made rich. The congenitally rich create the crony =
rich by ushering them onto the boards and payrolls of oil and energy compan=
ies and defense contractors.=20
There was no conflict of interest on Planet Enron, only confluence of inter=
est. No income tax, only insider tips. No S.E.C. or G.A.O., just C.E.O.'s, =
S.U.V.'s and N.O.B.D.'s (not our bankruptcy, dear). Q.E.D.=20
All meetings on Planet Enron were held in secret, and everyone liked it tha=
t way. Auditing was considered rude. It was a very empathetic place.=20
On Planet Enron, it seemed only fair that chairman-for-life Kenneth Lay sho=
uld reward himself with $51 trillion in a severance package, as opposed to =
the $51 million he was seeking on Planet Earth.=20
On Planet Enron, Secretary of the Army Thomas White could whine that he cam=
e out with only $12 million from sales of the company's stock. He bravely s=
aid he ''would persevere.''=20
On Planet Enron, Karl Rove could expect people to mist up at the poignant t=
ale of how he made mere millions instead of more millions when government e=
thics rules forced him to sell all of his stocks. And he could ingratiate h=
imself with the conservative leader Ralph Reed by offering him a piece of t=
he Enron rock.=20
On Planet Enron, the president, his words muffled by the brown paper bag on=
 his head, could strike a chord complaining that his mother-in-law had lost=
 $8,000 on Enron stock when less connected mortals lost their entire retire=
ments.=20
It was a beautifully sheltered place (and not just in the Caymans sense). A=
 place where inhabitants deluded themselves that their accomplishments and =
windfalls -- Ivy League degrees, energy company sinecures, lucrative consul=
ting contracts, advisory board booty -- were the result of merit and hard w=
ork.=20
But then turmoil struck. The planet has been overrun by the Wrong Kind: gov=
ernment lawyers bearing subpoenas and grand juries poking around. The thin =
and tony air has become noxious with the threat of litigation and incarcera=
tion.=20
Dick Cheney is still there, but he's hiding in a secure location. Now he ha=
s caves on two planets.=20
President Bush, distancing himself by light-years, has ordered the U.S. gov=
ernment to look into cutting off all business with the planet.=20
On Friday, the once-serene orb imploded with the news of the sad death of a=
 leading citizen, who shot himself in his Mercedes after telling friends he=
 did not want to have to turn against his own.=20
But Planet Enron is bigger than one company or one tragedy. It's a state of=
 mind, a subculture, a platinum card aristocracy. Its gravitational pull ha=
s long proven irresistible.

I Am Woman, Hear Me Roar in the Enron Scandal
By JILL ABRAMSON

01/27/2002
The New York Times
Page 3, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON -- AS the klieg lights went up on the Enron hearings, many of th=
e familiar elements of Washington scandal were on display -- charges of inf=
luence peddling, expressions of shock from outraged lawmakers and wall-to-w=
all lawyers in dark suits.=20
But there was one novelty. Enron, unlike so many other Capitol messes, feat=
ures powerful women in starring roles in a scandal that, at least so far, h=
as nothing to do with sex.
Nancy Temple, the Arthur Andersen lawyer and a leadoff witness, could even =
emerge as a fall gal. She was raked over the coals by her House inquisitors=
 for sending directives that they believe Andersen employees construed as a=
n invitation to shred thousands of Enron financial documents. Ms. Temple, w=
ho sent her memos at a time when she knew the company could be sued for Enr=
on's mounting accounting problems, denied wrongdoing.=20
Two women are vying for the part of the heroic whistle-blower. There is She=
rron S. Watkins, the Enron executive whose memo warning the chairman, Kenne=
th L. Lay, that their company might ''implode in a wave of accounting scand=
als'' helped rocket the ruckus.=20
Maureen Castaneda, a former Enron executive, last week went public with all=
egations of large-scale document shredding at Enron and provided actual pro=
of. She had taken some of the shreds home to use as packing material, only =
to discover that they were marked with the names Chewco and Jedi, two of En=
ron's legally questionable partnerships.=20
Both women held fancy titles. Ms. Watkins was Enron's vice president for co=
rporate development. Ms. Castaneda was director of foreign exchange and sov=
ereign risk management.=20
In recent days, investigators from the Securities and Exchange Commission h=
ave been talking with Martha P. Stuart about the role played by her law fir=
m, Kirkland & Ellis, in helping to set up some of the partnerships at the c=
enter of the inquiries.=20
The highest-profile women to figure in past Washington scandals, the White =
House intern Monica Lewinsky and the law professor Anita Hill, became famou=
s because they were in the middle of controversies involving charges of sex=
ual misconduct. Both women were in relatively low-level government jobs at =
the time of their fateful tangles with much more powerful men, President Bi=
ll Clinton and Clarence Thomas, then a Supreme Court nominee.=20
Other women have been featured players in nonsexual scandals, but they didn=
't occupy positions near or in the executive suite. Iran-contra's Fawn Hall=
 was a White House secretary. So too, was Watergate's Rose Mary Woods, Pres=
ident Richard Nixon's loyal employee, who was responsible for the famous 18=
.5-minute gap on a crucial White House tape. (She said her foot accidentall=
y hit the delete pedal as she was busily transcribing.)=20
Watergate did feature a professional woman, an ITT lobbyist named Dita Bear=
d, in a bit part, but she missed a bigger role when she went to the hospita=
l in order to avoid testifying before Congress about a memo she wrote.=20
Other supporting female scandal players have included the wives of official=
s under fire, like Martha Mitchell, or subordinate aides, like Deborah Gore=
 Dean, a lieutenant to Housing and Urban Development Secretary Samuel Pierc=
e, who was prosecuted for her role in an influence peddling scandal in the =
1980's.=20
''The scandal glass ceiling seems to have been broken,'' declared Ellen Mil=
ler, a senior fellow at The American Prospect, a liberal magazine, who was =
an outspoken critic of campaign finance abuses during various fund-raising =
scandals in the Clinton years. Is this progress? ''The story has changed. I=
t's not about sex. It's about women as major players in powerful positions.=
''=20
In the Clinton years, a few cracks appeared in that glass ceiling. Three hi=
gh-powered lawyers found themselves on the hot seat: Hillary Rodham Clinton=
 for her Rose Law Firm connections in Whitewater, and Zoe Baird and Kimba W=
ood, whose nominations for attorney general fell apart in what became known=
 as Nannygate.=20
But Mrs. Clinton fell under scrutiny because of whom she was married to, an=
d the problem that beset Ms. Baird and caused the White House to drop suppo=
rt for Ms. Wood flowed from their domestic lives, not their professional wo=
rk.=20
SUZANNE GARMENT, the author of ''Scandal: The Culture of Mistrust in Americ=
an Politics'' (Random House, 1991) is not sure the development is a healthy=
 one.=20
''It is very interesting that women have reached the point when they can be=
 at the center of scandal because of financial reasons instead of sexual re=
asons,'' she observed.=20
''But insofar as you think women have historically had a superior morality =
to that of men, then it isn't a cause for celebration.''=20
Whether cause for celebration or worry, the change does reflect the rising =
status of women in the legal and corporate worlds. They are now high enough=
 on the ladder to drive the action, as Ms. Temple may have done when she in=
structed Andersen employees on the company's policy concerning the retentio=
n (or destruction) of documents.=20
They are close enough to the corridors of power to hear secrets and technic=
ally proficient enough to figure out what is going on, as Ms. Watkins did a=
s she decoded Enron's impenetrable accounting (she had been an executive at=
 Andersen before joining Enron).=20
They may not consider themselves bona fide members of the club of top corpo=
rate officials, however.=20
For example, while Ms. Temple did testify before a House subcommittee on ov=
ersight and investigations, David Duncan, who was the lead Andersen partner=
 on the Enron audit team, refused to answer questions and invoked the Fifth=
 Amendment.=20
Ms. Temple may have less to hide -- or she may have felt less bound by the =
corporate world's brotherhood of silence.

I was shocked and disgusted but somehow not surprised by a detail of Kennet=
h Lay's compensation structure nearly buried at the end of the story of his=
 resignation (Jan. 24). You reported that Lay had a credit line of $7.5 mil=
lion from Enron, meaning he could borrow that much from the firm at any giv=
en time for his personal use. He took advantage of this arrangement multipl=
e times last summer, and then would repay the loan with his Enron stock, on=
ly to take advantage of the credit line once again.=20
All this was happening in the months just prior to his famous September spe=

Enron Considers Postponing Announcement Of New CEO

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENRNQ), said to be close to choosing a successor for former Chief Executive Kenneth Lay, may decide to postpone a formal announcement of its decision until after the weekend out of respect for the death of former Vice Chairman J. Clifford Baxter, a person familiar with the matter said.
An announcement of Lay's successor had been anticipated as soon as late Friday. 
Baxter, who resigned from Enron last May, was found dead from a gunshot wound to the head early Friday morning in Sugar Land, Texas - the affluent Houston suburb where he lived. Although officials have ruled the death a suicide, an autopsy is being performed as a precaution. 
The contents of a suicide note left at the scene haven't yet been disclosed. 
Baxter's death comes just one day after the start of congressional hearings on Enron's collapse and the role of its auditor Arthur Andersen. 
Amid pressure from the bankrupt company's creditors committee, Lay resigned late Wednesday night. 
The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Stephen Cooper is the front-runner to be named acting chief executive. 
Cooper, managing principal of consulting firm Zolfo Cooper, is an expert in corporate restructuring. He is known for his turnaround efforts at Federated Department Stores Inc. (FD) and Morrison Knudsen Corp. 
According to a source familiar with the matter, Enron would like the future chief executive to oversee the day-to-day operations and restructuring of the company, while a second person will be named chairman. The source said the chairman would be responsible for handling the more political aspects of the job.

Enron Documents
2002-01-25 13:56 (New York)

By Kathy Chu 
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 
NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--A federal judge plans to issue an order Friday afternoon demanding that Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) employees hold on to company documents. 

Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez, at a Friday hearing at the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York, said that the court order will echo recent written directives by Enron executives to employees. 

Since the company became aware of possible investigations into its downfall, it has sent six e-mails regarding document retention to its workers, according to an  Enron lawyer. 

One of the e-mails stated that "no company records, either in electronic or paper form, should be destroyed." The court order comes amid allegations by three Enron workers that others in the company may have shredded documents. Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's former auditor, has admitted to destroying Enron-related paperwork. 

The Federal Bureau of Investigations has taken over the 19th and 20th floors of Enron's Houston headquarters, where some of the alleged shredding occurred, an Enron lawyer said. The agency may complete its investigation on Wednesday, according to Enron. 

Enron has removed all document-shredding machines from  the building and is separating its paper and perishable waste. 

Under the bankruptcy code, those who "knowingly and fraudulently" dispose of documents in a Chapter 11 case can be sentenced to a five-year prison term and can be fined. 

Friday's proceedings were part of a status conference related to 11 insurers' requests to open Enron's books to determine if forward contracts guaranteed by $2 billion in  surety bonds ever existed. 

The insurers - including Safeco Insurance Co., Hartford Financial Services Group Inc. (HIG) and Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., among others - contend that their obligations under these bonds depend upon whether energy was actually delivered in contracts made among Enron, Mahonia Ltd. and Mahonia Natural Gas Ltd. - offshore entities set up by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM). 

J.P. Morgan served on Enron's official creditors' committee and is a lead lender in the company's debtor-in-possession financing.

Judge Gonzalez, at a hearing earlier this week, had asked Enron to provide the insurers with witnesses' names and the location of documents relevant to the surety-bond contracts by Feb. 1. 

He also scheduled Friday's status conference to assess Enron's document-preservation policies. The judge has postponed until late May a decision on whether Enron must open its books, saying that pending litigation in a New York  district court would likely address this request. 

J.P. Morgan on Dec. 11 filed a lawsuit against the insurers, seeking payment of $1.1 billion - including $965 million owed to the bank - under the surety bonds. 
  The lawsuit, which was first recorded in a New York state court, was later moved to a U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.

Lay not likely to get severance pay
Turnaround expert could be named Friday as Enron CEO
By Lisa Sanders, CBS.MarketWatch.com
Last Update: 1:29 PM ET Jan. 25, 2002
HOUSTON (CBS.MW) -- Former Enron CEO Ken Lay isn't likely to see much if any of his hefty severance pay in the face of opposition from creditors, shareholders and employees, bankruptcy experts said Friday.
Lay, who resigned as CEO and chairman under fire late Wednesday, could be replaced with a turnaround specialist as early as Friday, a person familiar with the matter said. The Wall Street Journal reported that Stephen Cooper of the consulting firm Zolfo Cooper is the frontrunner. Cooper wasn't immediately available for comment.
Enron spokesmen weren't available for comment Friday. On Thursday, a spokesman said that Lay's compensation was still being determined.
David Bennett, an attorney representing a group of about 20 energy companies with claims against Enron, said that if anyone sought payment for an employment agreement from the bankruptcy court it would be subject to "court scrutiny." What's more, Lay would have to request the payment.
"There will be lots of parties lining up to question the appropriateness of paying out those kinds of funds given the circumstances," said Bennett, a partner with the law firm Thompson & Knight.
"For the most part, setting aside any claims the estate may have against Mr. Lay, he shouldn't be paid ahead of unsecured creditors for sure," Bennett added.
Rick Tilton, a bankruptcy specialist in New York, said that the creditors' committee, or a trustee if one is appointed, could assert there was cause for his dismissal. Though Lay resigned, he was asked to do so by the creditors' committee. His employment contract voids his severance if he was "terminated with cause."
According to an SEC proxy statement filed on March 27, 2001, Lay's contract calls for him to receive a "lump sum payment for each full calendar year of the remaining term of the agreement equal to base salary, performance bonus, and long-term grant value received in calendar year 2000, offset against amounts payable under the severance plan maintained by Enron." 
Lay's employment agreement, which commenced in December 1996 and runs through Dec. 31, 2003, provides for a minimum salary of $1.3 million a year. 
According to the proxy statement, Lay in 2000 was paid a $1.3 million salary and a bonus of $7 million. Taking both figures into account and doubling them translates into $16.6 million, not counting the long-term grant value. 
Also in 2000, Enron paid Lay restricted stock awards worth $7.5 million; other annual compensation, including personal benefits, worth $381,000; a $1.2 million cash payment under the Enron performance plan; and $782,830 in stock options. 
He also exercised stock options to the tune of $123.4 million in 2000. Exercisable options, which he chose not to enact, amounted to $257.5 million, while unexercisable options totaled $104.1 million. Enron also paid a $4 million, interest-bearing line of credit in full in 2000, which yielded $110,174 in interest. 
The proxy statement notes that if his severance package "is held to constitute an 'excess parachute payment,' and Mr. Lay becomes liable for any tax penalties ... Enron will make a cash payment to him in an amount equal to the tax penalties plus an amount equal to any additional tax for which he will be liable as a result of the receipt of the payment." 
Lay, who will remain on the company's board, will assist the board and Enron's creditors committee in selecting a "restructuring specialist" to help turn around the company and serve as chief executive on an interim basis. 
"What the company is looking for is a chief reorganization specialist," Bennett said. "But various creditor groups are seeking the appointment of a Chapter 11 trustee -- an outright bankruptcy trustee who supersedes current management. Whoever comes in, even if they're technically hired by the board, will have to quickly establish credibility with the creditors' committee."
Enron's board plans to name a new chairman as soon as possible. Until then, the chief financial and operating officers will handle the chairmanship duties. 
Shares of Enron lost 1 cents to 44 cents in over-the-counter trading Friday.

House Enron Probe Seeks Info On Lay's Loan Transactions
By Bryan Lee

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- A House panel investigating the financial collapse of Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) expanded its probe Friday to include stock-related loan transactions by Kenneth Lay, who resigned this week as the company's chairman and chief executive.
Ranking members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee issued a formal request for the information in the wake of published reports that Lay had a $4 million revolving line of credit from Enron, which was raised to $7.5 million last year. 
According to the reports, Lay borrowed from the credit line 15 times between February and October of last year, and repaid the amounts in Enron stock. 
"We are concerned about the unreported nature of these transactions and their effect upon Enron shareholders and employees, particularly during the stock's steep decline in 2001," the lawmakers said in a letter to Lay. 
It was signed by Reps. Billy Tauzin, R-La., John Dingell, D-Mich., James Greenwood, R-Pa., and Peter Deutsch, D-Fla. 
Lay isn't required to report the details of the transactions until Feb. 14, the letter noted. The lawmakers asked for the information by Jan. 28 to assist the committee's "intensive investigation of the demise of the company." 
Lay is slated to testify Feb. 4 before two congressional panels, the House Financial Services Committee and the Senate Commerce Committee. 
The letter also asked for details of similar transactions involving: Jeffrey Skilling, Enron's former chief executive; Andrew Fastow, the former chief financial officer, and other senior Enron executives.

Source: New York reorganization expert may replace Lay

NEW YORK (AP) - The front-runner to replace Kenneth Lay as chief executive of embattled Enron Corp. is a New York bankruptcy reorganization expert whose past clients include Bradlees, Cumberland Farms and Pegasus Gold Corp., a person familiar with the situation said. 
Stephen Cooper, managing principal of the reorganization adviser Zolfo Cooper, could be named to run Enron within several days and planned to fly to Houston Friday to meet with company executives, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity and confirmed earlier published reports.
Enron spokesman Eric Thode declined to comment on Cooper or the company's progress in selecting a successor to Lay, who resigned as chairman and chief executive Wednesday night. 
Zolfo Cooper officials did not immediately return a phone message seeking comment. 
On its Web site, Zolfo Cooper says its executives "have hands-on leadership experience under adverse conditions." 
"Working as senior management or as part of a crisis team, we stabilize the business," the site says. "Thus, we gain the necessary time to assess the situation, design, and implement programs to restore business' vitality and profitability. We maximize value by rebuilding the management process and reorganizing the business or prepare it for sale." 
Enron's collapse began in mid-October after the company announced a $618 million third-quarter loss and a $1.2 billion reduction in the company's equity. Subsequent revelations showed that the company masked debt in questionable partnerships that benefited some company executives. 
The company - once No. 7 on the Fortune magazine list of the 500 largest companies - filed for bankruptcy protection to reorganize on Dec. 2. Last week, a judge approved a plan that allows investment bank UBS Warburg to take over the company's energy trading operation, which accounted for 90 percent of Enron's $101 billion in revenue in 2000.

If You Could Pick Someone To Run Enron, It Would Be...
By Kaja Whitehouse

01/25/2002
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) has quickly become the Rodney Dangerfield of corporate America.
It gets no respect. 
Afterall, everyone hates the firm that collapsed in a wave of accounting scandals last November. Investors hate it because they lost a ton of money. Employees of the company hate it, because they lost their jobs and a ton of money from their pension plan. Houston hates it, because its become an embarrassment to the city Enron called home. Washington hates it so much that it decided to hold multiple Congressional hearings. 
Come to think of it, even you probably hate it. 
But apparently some Enron insiders seem to think Enron will continue to press on as long as it cleans up its act. As a first step, Kenneth Lay, center of many of probes, stepped down as Enron CEO Wednesday, saying that he wants the company to "survive." 
Talk has it that the Enron execs are seeking out hardcore restructuring expert Stephen F. Cooper to repair what's broke. According to the Wall Street Journal, Enron wants a leader who can manage complex daily operations and work through this troubles of bankruptcy. 
But in order to truly revive to the downtrodden company, Enron requires more than a technical fix-it man. It needs a well-known leader who can restore respectability to the Enron name - if that's possible. 
That person would have to win back the confidence of investors and Wall Street and would need to negotiate successfully with regulators and lawmakers. 
If you had the power to select anyone for this seemingly Herculian task, who would that person be? 
That's the question Dow Jones Newswires posed to people from Wall Street to Congress and the answers were an interesting mix. 
"Enron needs to have a trustworthy person that is well-known to the public," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Jefferies & Co. "Right now everyone feels adversely affected" by Enron, and people want someone who will make them feel confident again, added Hogan, who voted for former television newscaster Walter Cronkite to run the downtrodden company. "He's a sort of elder statesman, the perfect candidate," Hogan said. 

Mayor, Diplomat or TV Journalist? 

Some predict Enron is too rife with foul-play to regain any credibility. "You could put Mother Teresa in there and I don't think it's ever going to bring it back," said Tom Salerno, partner of Squire, Sanders & Dempsey. 
But reviving companies smeared with scandal through a popular and respectable leader has worked in the past. Just look at Salomon Brothers, the debt trader that was on the brink of extinction in the early 1990s after it was discovered that the firm tried to skirt federal regulations. Instead, investment guru Warren Buffet took control and kept the company from folding under. 
Similar tactics might be necessary for Enron. If not in the CEO position, then at least in Lay's remaining role as chairman. 
No one wants to invest in that company again unless someone honest is placed at the wheel, said Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones, a Cleveland Democrat, who voted for Fannie Mae CEO Franklin Raines. "It's like people telling us to get back on the plane" after Sept. 11, she said. 
It should come as little surprise then, that former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani was a popular candidate among interviewees. The popular mayor gained America's favor after pulling NYC through the Sept. 11 crisis. 
Giuliani can "turn around a bad situation and make us all feel good about it," said Peter Flaherty, president of the National Legal and Policy Center in Washington, DC. Many cited Giuliani's ability to handle crisis, while others touted him as a hard-working, honest individual. 
It isn't known if Giuliani is up for the post. After leaving public office this fall, the former mayor said he was setting up a consulting firm with New York accountants Ernst & Young. 
Other names that resounded with people as honest, hardworking leaders included U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell, former General Electric CEO Jack Welch and Ben Cohen, co-founder of Ben & Jerry's ice cream. 
John Challenger, CEO of outsourcing firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, in Chicago, who voted for Powell, saying that Enron requires someone with "extraordinary diplomacy." There are so many people who were burned by the company's fall that it will take a very diplomatic person to make everyone happy, he said. With Powell, people might walk away afterwards and say "it wasn't what I wanted, but they will think it was fair."

O'Neill: Not Clear Enron Tax Havens Linked To Illicit Acts

01/25/2002
Dow Jones Capital Markets Report
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- It isn't clear if Enron Corp.'s use of Caribbean tax havens is linked to the illicit financial activities that the U.S. is seeking to crack down on through tax treaties with offshore financial havens, U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill said Friday. 
"It's not clear that it's related in any way to the issue of illicit financial activities," O'Neill told reporters when asked whether he was worried about the use of offshore subsidiaries by bankrupt energy-trading giant Enron (ENRNQ).
The New York Times, citing company papers filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, reported last week that Enron paid no income taxes in four of the last five years by using hundreds of subsidiaries in tax-haven nations. 
The Senate Finance Committee has asked Enron to disclose its corporate income tax returns. 
O'Neill's remarks came after he signed a new tax-information exchange agreement with the Bahamas, a Caribbean nation that is one of 35 nations the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development cited in a June 2000 report as tax havens with harmful tax practices. 
The Bahamas is still on the OECD list, Treasury said. 
"The importance of these treaties is that they close off loopholes and windows of opportunities for illicit activities, and we are dedicated to interdicting and confiscating money that's related to terrorist financing and drug trade and other types of illicit activities," O'Neill said. 
O'Neill hailed the signing of the tax agreement as "another important step forward" in the relationship between the U.S. and the Bahamas. 
"By signing this agreement, the Bahamas leaves no doubt that it should be counted among the financial centers of the world that are committed to upholding international standards and simply will not tolerate the abuse of their financial institutions for illicit purposes," O'Neill said. 
Bahamian Finance Minister William Allen said the Bahamas is firmly opposed to the use of its financial system for illicit purposes and is determined that the same financial standards apply in the Bahamas as in other financial centers. 
"We are gratified by the U.S. government's recognition of the integrity of the Bahamas as a financial center," Allen said. 
The tax agreement with the Bahamas follows similar accords the Bush administration struck with Antigua and Barbuda and the Cayman Islands last year. 
O'Neill testified before Congress last July that the U.S. is going to seek to negotiate tax treaties with foreign jurisdictions that would require information be shared on suspected tax evaders.

U.S. signs agreement with Bahamas to crack down on tax evaders
By JEANNINE AVERSA
Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON (AP) - Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill signed an information-sharing agreement with the Bahamas Friday designed to help U.S. authorities crack down on the use of offshore tax havens to hide illegal money. 
The agreement with the Caribbean nation, long considered a haven for tax evaders, marks the Bush administration's latest effort to open up financial institutions to greater scrutiny to prevent tax evasion.
The Senate Finance Committee is investigating whether Enron Corp. used hundreds of partnerships and affiliates in tax-haven countries to mask its true financial condition. The company filed for bankruptcy in December. 
Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal tax research organization, has estimated that Enron paid no corporate income taxes in four of the past five years. Enron paid $17 million in taxes in 1997 and got refunds totaling $381 million in all other years between 1996 to 2000, according to the group's analysis. 
Asked whether he was concerned about Enron's use of offshore tax havens, O'Neill responded: "It's not clear that it's related in any way to the issue of illicit financial activities." 
The administration has signed information-sharing agreements with Antigua and Barbuda, and the Cayman Islands, countries also long considered tax havens. 
"The importance of these treaties is that they close off loopholes and windows of opportunity for illicit activities," O'Neill said. 
Friday's agreement is designed to allow the Internal Revenue Service to pierce the secrecy of accounts at financial institutions in the Bahamas, paving the way for audits that could uncover tax evasion or money-laundering activities. 
William Allen, the Bahamas finance minister, said he was pleased that the United States and his country were able to reach a "balanced" information-sharing agreement 
"The Bahamas is firmly against the use of its financial system for illicit purposes," he said. 
Senators last year heard testimony that the United States loses an estimated $70 billion in tax revenue each year because assets are concealed in offshore tax havens. 
Led by O'Neill, the Bush administration has shifted the U.S. focus in dealing with tax haven countries away from international efforts to overhaul tax structures toward negotiated agreements that allow easier U.S. pursuit of suspected cheaters. 
The Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has identified various nations, including the Bahamas, as tax havens and O'Neill has pledged to negotiate within a year agreements with nations covering at least half of the offshore bank accounts. 
Previous administrations had strongly supported the OECD's efforts to curb the use of offshore accounts to evade taxes, but O'Neill and congressional Republicans have complained that the OECD approach was an attempt to punish countries with low taxes.

Enron Judge Says He Will Bar Destruction of Documents, E-Mails
2002-01-25 13:31 (New York)

     New York, Jan. 25 (Bloomberg) -- A federal bankruptcy judge said he will issue an order today barring Enron Corp. from destroying any more documents. The order also will cover e-mails and other records.
     The order by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Arthur Gonzalez was sought by property insurers and backed by Enron creditors. Enron filed for bankruptcy protection last month, in the largest Chapter 11 filing ever. Allegations of document destruction have been raised this week at congressional hearings.
     Enron shares fell less than a cent to 44.5 cents in afternoon trading.

US To Review Enron, Arthur Anderson Federal Contracts

01/25/2002
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

WASHINGTON (AP)--The White House on Friday ordered a review of $70 million worth of federal contracts with Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) and the Arthur Andersen (X.AND) accounting firm to determine whether the embattled companies are worthy of government business. 
In a letter to the General Services Administration, which oversees government contracts, budget director Mitchell E. Daniels said charges of document shredding, manipulative accounting practices and other activities "could reflect poorly" on the companies and their ability to meet government ethics standards.
"These agencies should ensure that existing contracts with Arthur Andersen and Enron are being performed in accordance with contract terms and proper business practices," Daniels wrote. 
Enron, a Texas-based company with deep ties to President George W. Bush, filed for bankruptcy late last year after investors and workers lost fortunes in company stocks. Bush, a friend of former Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay, ordered a review of the nation's pension laws and approved a Justice Department criminal investigation into the company's actions. 
Arthur Andersen, which kept the company's books, is also under investigation. Congress is holding hearings on the Enron collapse. 
Daniels' letter does not say how many federal agencies have contracts with the firms, but an aide said Enron and Arthur Andersen hold $70 million worth of federal contracts. 
"Recent reports have highlighted potential irregularities in work done by the accounting firm of Arthur Andersen LLP and the Enron Corp. Some of these allegations are serious in nature," Daniels wrote. 
He said federal rules require firms seeking or doing business with the government to have "a satisfactory record of business ethics and integrity." The federal agencies were asked to determine whether Enron and Arthur Andersen still met that standard. 
The agencies were given a summary of contracts awarded to the firms. 
Enron and Arthur Andersen, both of which were given copies of Daniels' letter, had no immediate comment. 
In a somber development elsewhere on Friday, a former Enron executive was found shot to death in a car in a suburb of Houston - an apparent suicide, police said. 
The executive, 43-year-old J. Clifford Baxter, had challenged the company's questionable financial practices and resigned last May. He was mentioned by name in a warning about hidden losses that Enron executive Sherron Watkins wrote last August to company Chairman Kenneth Lay. 
Meanwhile, a separate auditor's memo from last October shows that some officials at Arthur Andersen were worried about a "heightened risk" of fraud in Enron's books a week before the energy company shocked stockholders with huge losses. 
The e-mail by Andersen auditor Mark Zajac warned that a computer analysis of Enron's financial activities in the third quarter of last year indicated "a red alert: a heightened risk of financial statement fraud," according to investigators. 
The Andersen auditor's October e-mail warning of possible fraud, released by Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., added to mounting evidence that Enron's outside accounting firm had strong misgivings about Enron business practices. 
"We have considerable rascality," Dingell, ranking Democrat on the House Commerce Committee, summed up Friday on CBS' "The Early Show." "We have to find out who is at fault for what." 
A House hearing Thursday into the Enron collapse left lawmakers certain of only one thing: Thousands of documents were destroyed by Enron's blue-ribbon accounting firm. 
Questions about who ordered the shredding, and whether it was intended to stifle government investigations, were left unresolved after a House panel concluded its first public hearing into the largest and perhaps most devastating bankruptcy in history. 
A week after the "red alert" memo, Enron reported a $638 million third-quarter loss and disclosed a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity, partly because of hidden debt built up by a complex web of partnerships. 
On the same day that Zajac wrote his memo to the head of the Enron auditing team, Andersen also hired a law firm in anticipation of possible lawsuits involving Enron, the Houston-based energy giant that spiraled into bankruptcy Dec. 2. 
Andersen played down the significance of the computer analysis. And Zajac in the memo acknowledged the system produces "false alarms." 
Enron and its employees contributed more than $500,000 to the Bush campaign last year. Kenneth Lay, who this week resigned as Enron chairman, has been one of Bush's strongest supporters over the years. Andersen gave Bush $146,000 during the past three years, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.

Enron Partnership Investors Sought in House Probe
2002-01-25 15:03 (New York)

     Washington, Jan. 25 (Bloomberg) - Congressional investigators examining the collapse of Enron Corp., armed with subpoenas, are looking for investors who put money into partnerships that the bankrupt energy trader used to inflate earnings and hide debt.
     The partners, many of whom have never been named, may include Wall Street firms, institutional investors and pension funds, securities lawyers and investors said. Enron lured them with promised returns of 100 percent or more, one pension fund manager said. Enron needed partners to satisfy accounting rules that allowed the company to shift assets and liabilities from its balance sheet.
     ``It sounds like they were renting the (investors') names so they could keep this off their books,'' said Larry Soderquist, director of Vanderbilt Law School's Corporate Securities Law Institute.
     Through court documents or their own spokespeople, institutions identified as investors in the partnerships include General Electric Co.'s GE Capital; Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce; and state retirement systems in Arkansas and California.
     Citigroup Inc. units Citicorp and Travelers Insurance Co. made total equity investment of more than $10 million in one of the investment partnerships, LJM2, a person familiar with the matter said.
     Court documents also identified the Citigroup investment as well as an investment partnership affiliated with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. and American International Group Inc.'s American Home Assurance Co. as investors, the New York Times reported.

Records Requested

      Senator Joseph Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, said the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee's Permanent Investigations Subcommittee has subpoenaed documents related to the financing of Enron's partnerships.
     ``One of its focuses is going to be on the use of insider trading of separate entities that were dealing with one another without any understanding by the public that it was happening,'' he said.
     Representative Billy Tauzin, a Louisiana Republican who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said yesterday investigators have requested partnership records from Enron in an effort to identify investors. He spoke at a hearing at which executives of Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, testified about the firm's destruction of Enron audit documents.
     ``There obviously are many members of Congress who would like to know who these secret partners were,'' said committee member Henry Waxman, a California Democrat.
     Wall Street firms could be a target of a congressional inquiry, said Republican Representative Jim Greenwood of Pennsylvania.
     ``Well if that's where our investigation leads us we certainly will,'' Greenwood said. ``We will leave no stone unturned.''

Enron Assets

     An Andersen internal memo released by the committee refers to CIBC, Canada's third-largest bank, as an investor in LJM2, a partnership set up and run by Enron's former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. LJM2, which eventually raised $349 million, was used to hold or sell a number of Houston-based Enron's assets, including fiber-optic cable that it bought at a premium from Enron in June 2000 and resold six months later to another Fastow-controlled partnership.
     LJM1 and LJM2 were incorporated in the Cayman Islands.
     The investment banking arm of Merrill Lynch & Co. underwrote the LJM2 offering and was made aware of information concerning Enron's off-balance sheet partnerships, according to the New York Times. In 2000, potential investors were told that Enron, through its partnerships, controlled 50 percent more assets than it disclosed in Securities and Exchange Commission filings, the paper reported.
     The Arkansas Teacher Retirement System invested $5 million in LJM2 starting in 1999, Chief Financial Officer George Snyder said. The pension fund hasn't been contacted by congressional investigators, he said.

`Good Investment'

     ``The board at the time felt it was a good investment,'' said Snyder, who didn't work for the fund at the time.
     LJM2 was sold as a vehicle for purchasing and building companies, Bill Shirer, a fund manager for the Arkansas system, said in October.
     ``We had a limited investment of less than $5 million in LJM2,'' said GE Capital spokesman Peter Stack. ``It was some type of drawdown and I don't think we got up to the $5 million cap.''
     AIG spokesman Ned Burke, CIBC spokesman Rob McLeod and Morgan Stanley spokesman Bret Gallaway all declined to comment. Citigroup spokesman Richard Howe had no immediate comment.

Dozens of Partnerships

     Enron used dozens of partnerships to hold assets such as power plants. Accounting rules allowed the company to keep partnership debt off its books if an independent investor provided at least 3 percent of partnership funding. The hidden debt grew to billions of dollars, helping Enron meet 20 percent annual earnings growth forecasts.
     ``They had to do more off-balance-sheet financings, to get the debt off the books, to present the right balance sheet that Wall Street wanted to see,'' said Danny Bowers, chief investment officer for the Houston Firefighters Relief and Retirement Fund, which manages about $1.7 billion and represents 5,000 firefighters and retirees in Houston.
     In September 2000, an Enron trust called Osprey Trust raised $2.4 billion from institutional investors such as Putnam Investments, American Express Co., the Vanguard Group, Travelers and Prudential in a private placement of notes due in 2003 to help finance some of its partnerships, according to the New York Times.
     Because the notes were backed by Enron shares, they probably have lost 60 percent of their value, the newspaper said, citing estimates by McCullough Research, a Portland, Oregon-based utility consultant.
     Bowers said Fastow approached him about investing in LJM2 in January 2000. At the time, Fastow wanted to raise $400 million to buy and sell Enron assets, Bowers said. Bowers declined because of Fastow's dual role as Enron's CFO and LJM2's general partner.

`Blatant Conflict'

     ``There was a pretty blatant conflict of interest,'' he said. ``It was kind of a stinky deal.''
     Fastow, through a spokesman, has declined to comment since being ousted from Enron in October.
     In exchange for the investment, Fastow promised ``in the neighborhood of 100 percent, 150 percent returns,'' Bowers said.
``He didn't present it as no risk, he just presented it as a very high return opportunity.''
     Enron executives tried unsuccessfully to get the University of Texas endowment to invest in about a dozen partnerships and other entities over a three-year period in the late 1990s, coming by to pitch transactions as often as every other month, said Austin Long, who was in charge of private equity investments at the university at the time.

`Incredibly Favorable'

     ``These deals had one thing in common: they were incredibly favorable to Enron and they were incredibly overreaching,'' he said. In one case, Enron was trying to raise $200 million for a retail energy startup, valuing it at $2 billion even though it had no revenue and wasn't legally registered in any state.
     Many banks and investors who dealt with Enron have declined to comment on whether they invested in partnerships. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., the second-biggest U.S. bank, wrote off $456 million in trading losses and loans to Enron in the fourth quarter. It still has exposure to potential losses of $2.06 billion. J.P. Morgan spokeswoman Kristin Lemkau declined to comment on whether any of those losses were related to partnership investments.
     Bank of America Corp., the third-largest U.S. bank, Wachovia Corp., and SunTrust Banks Inc. have written off Enron-related loans. None would comment on whether they invested in Enron partnerships.

Calpers

     The California Public Employees' Retirement System, the nation's largest public pension fund, invested in Enron partnerships dating to 1993, when the company was trying to finance an expansion into energy trading. Calpers invested $250.5 million in Joint Energy Development Investments, or JEDI, which bought stakes in independent natural gas producers.
     In 1998, Enron approached Calpers about buying into a second JEDI partnership. Calpers agreed on the condition that Enron repurchase its interest in the first JEDI partnership. To do that, Enron set up Chewco Investments LP to buy Calpers' stake for $383 million. The transaction resulted in a $133 million profit for Calpers, spokesman Brad Pacheco said. The fund has received $171 million from JEDI II, he said.
     Because Enron controlled both Chewco and JEDI II, it lacked the independent funding needed to keep the partnerships and their debt off the company's balance sheet.

Restated Earnings

     In November, Enron restated earnings to 1997, lowering profit by $586 million and adding $2.6 billion in Chewco debt to the company's books, according to filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
     Calpers spokeswoman Patricia Macht said the fund was unaware of Enron's Chewco arrangement.
     ``When Calpers cashed out of JEDI I, the investment managers believed that the cash was coming from Enron,'' she said. ``The first we heard about Chewco was in the newspaper. To this day, we have no evidence that shows there was anything improper about JEDI I and JEDI II.''
     The earnings restatement marked the beginning of Enron's demise. On Dec. 2, the company filed the largest Chapter 11 bankruptcy ever.
     ``Based on the investigation so far, it's clear to us that these off-the-balance sheet partnerships eventually contributed to the company's financial meltdown,'' said Ken Johnson, a spokesman for the House commerce committee.
     The committee is one of 10 in Congress investigating Enron's collapse. The SEC and the Justice Department have begun their own probes. Investigators said they want to determine who invested in the Enron partnerships and for what reason.
     ``I think we have to understand who were the investors, why, who sold the investments in the partnerships, what were the gains to understand, was there activity here you could call bilking?'' said Senator Byron Dorgan, a North Dakota Democrat who leads the Senate Consumer Affairs Subcommittee, which also is investigating Enron.

Fedl Judge Gives Enron 60 Days To Decide On Commodities
By Kathy Chu

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- A federal judge will give bankrupt Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) 60 days, or until April 2, to decide whether it wants to commit to five commodities contracts.
"Forcing an early decision to accept or reject could result in a loss of value to the estate," said Judge Arthur Gonzalez, during a Friday hearing at the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York. 
With this ruling, the judge rejected motions by Enron's creditors - Natural Gas Pipeline of America, Trailblazer Pipeline Co., Southern California Gas Co., San Diego Gas & Electric Co. and Superior Industries International Inc. (SUP) - aimed at forcing the company to immediately decide upon the agreements. 
The creditors claim that since Enron's bankruptcy, the company hasn't fully honored its commitments. This has required third parties to step in to supply natural gas and electricity. 
But Judge Gonzalez told creditors Friday that their businesses haven't been significantly impaired by Enron's bankruptcy, as sufficient supplies of gas and electricity continue to be available. 
Also, Enron has said that its supply of the commodities to two California public utilities - Southern California Gas Co. and San Diego Gas & Electric Co. - as well as other creditors are nearing 100% of levels prior to the Dec. 2 bankruptcy filing.

Ill. Regulators Likely To Strip Enron Energy-Sale Rights
By Jon Kamp

01/25/2002
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

(This article was originally published Thursday.)
CHICAGO (Dow Jones)--The Illinois Commerce Commission will likely vote next week to revoke an Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) unit's permission to sell energy to end users in the state, a spokeswoman for the commission said Thursday. 
The unit, Enron Energy Services, continues to operate and is still managing the energy needs of hundreds of industrial and commercial customers around the country despite having joined its parent in bankruptcy court. But the Dec. 2 Chapter 11 filing sets the unit at odds with Illinois law, which requires providers like Enron to have solid financial standing before serving customers. 
"It's being revoked primarily because their financial rating has been downgraded," commission spokeswoman Beth Bosch said of Enron Energy Service's license to do business in Illinois. "They lost one of the legs of their stool." 
The commission punted the expected ruling Thursday, but is likely to follow a staff recommendation to cancel Enron Energy Services' retail-provider certificate when it picks up the issue again next Tuesday, Bosch said. 
If the commission issues the order to revoke Enron Energy Services' certificate, the company will have an undefined period of time to show why it believes its certificate should remain intact, Bosch said. The company could also voluntarily back out of the certificate and could reapply for a new certificate at a later date. 
It wasn't immediately clear what effect revocation of the certificate would have on Enron Energy Services' Illinois operations. In some cases, the unit supplies energy; in others, it acts as a billing agent. While the former activity requires the certificate, the latter falls into a gray area. 
Most Enron contracts in Chicago were for energy management or billing agent services, Bosch said. But some of those contracts might have evolved into electricity provider deals. In its eight-year contract signed with the City of Chicago last summer, for example, Enron was to provide management services for the first few years and then actual electricity for the remainder of the deal. 
Representatives of Enron Energy Services couldn't be reached for comment. 
Enron Energy Services in recent years signed many high-profile contracts in the Chicago area, with customers ranging from the City of Chicago itself to PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) unit Quaker Oats Co. Under the contracts, which often run for several years, Enron Energy Services usually serves as an energy manager for its Illinois customers by helping them arrange power deals with their local utility, Bosch said. 
But the Enron unit's scope of operations has shrunk, notably in the Chicago area, where it once had aggressive growth plans. A New York bankruptcy court judge approved in early January Enron's request to terminate 600 to 700 energy supply contracts. Enron was granted a request to terminate more than 50 Chicago-area deals, Crain's Chicago Business has reported. 
The University of Chicago decided to cancel its seven-year Enron deal last week and is now receiving service directly from Exelon Corp. (EXC) unit Commonwealth Edison Co., spokesman Larry Arbeiter said. The university has no immediate plants to seek another provider. 
"At the moment the price we're paying is lower with ComEd," Arbeiter said. 
Quaker spokesman Mark Dollins said the company backed out of its 10-year energy management contract with Enron Energy Services, signed in February last year, after the bankruptcy judge ruled they could leave earlier this month. 
"We have already secured other providers," Dollins said. 
The City of Chicago used a clause in its Enron contract to cancel the deal in early December.

Lay, Other Enron Directors' Seats On Boards Face Scrutiny

01/25/2002
Dow Jones Corporate Filings Alert
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

ISSUER: NEWPOWER HOLDINGS INC. 
SYMBOL: NPW 


WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) Chairman and Chief 
Executive Ken Lay's career as a corporate board member could end this spring, 
corporate governance experts said. 

Pressure is starting to build on companies to remove Lay and other 
Enron board members from their boards, said Patrick McGurn, director of 
corporate programs at Institutional Shareholder Services Inc., which advises 
large institutional investors on voting matters. 

Earlier Friday, the AFL-CIO announced it sent letters to 21 public 
companies encouraging them not to renominate any Enron board members to their 
own boards when they send out proxies this year. 

"Typically, you want directors to bring praise, not scrutiny," McGurn 
said, "it would be surprising to see (Lay) serve on any board after annual 
meeting season," McGurn said. 

Lay, who resigned as head of Enron on Wednesday, once served on the 
boards of a number of high-profile public companies. Over the past 12 
months, he has resigned from the all the corporate boards on which he served 
except for NewPower Holdings Inc. (NPW) and Enron. 

Richard Koppes, an attorney with Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue who 
advises companies on corporate governance issues, said Enron board members 
will have a much harder time now keeping and obtaining corporate board seats. 

"If I'm on a board and somebody said we wanted to bring on a former 
Enron board member, I'd start looking for another nominee," Koppes said. 

Lay resigned from the board of I2 Technologies Inc. (ITWO) in October 
2001 and stepped down as a director at Compaq Computer Corp. (CPQ) and Eli 
Lilly & Co. (LLY) in December. He also had served on the board of EOTT 
Energy Corp. (EOT), but resigned in May. 

NewPower hasn't decided whether it will renominate Lay as a director 
for the coming year, according to spokeswoman Terri Cohen. The energy 
company plans to mail proxies to shareholders in mid-April for an annual 
meeting tentatively scheduled for sometime in May. 

"I can't speculate whether Mr. Lay will or will not be on the proxy" 
for the upcoming annual meeting," Cohen told Dow Jones Newswires. 

Cohen said that "if someone wanted to resign that's one thing, but 
that hasn't been discussed with Mr. Lay."

AFL-CIO takes aim at Enron directors
Urges that they be kicked off other corporate boards

By Lisa Sanders <mailto:lsanders@marketwatch.com>, CBS.MarketWatch.com
Last Update: 12:04 PM ET Jan. 25, 2002
WASHINGTON (CBS.MW) - The AFL-CIO on Friday called on companies with Enron directors on their boards to refuse to re-nominate the 10 people, citing the group's failure to properly oversee the bankrupt energy merchant's accounting practices.
Enron directors serve on boards ranging from Motorola to Lockheed Martin.
"Directors who permitted the accounting deception that led to the collapse of a company worth over $70 billion are not suited to serve on other boards," the AFL-CIO's Richard Trumka said in a statement.
Enron directors, among other things, failed to question the company's use of off-balance sheet financings to cover up debt and losses. The directors also waived conflict-of-interest rules to allow Enron executives to create limited partnerships that led to a $1.2 billion equity reduction, and they approved the annual report without confirming it was "straightforward and comprehensible," the AFL-CIO said.
The AFL-CIO pointed out that shareholders could retaliate against board members they feel are unsuitable by withholding votes.
"Barring Enron's directors from future service at other companies will hopefully prevent this type of catastrophic loss for workers from happening again," Trumka said.
Enron director Robert Belfer also sits on the board of Westport Resources Corp.; Norman Blakes serves on Comdisco and Owens Corning boards; Ronnie Chan is a member of the boards of Hang Lung Group, Standard Chartered PLC, and Motorola; John Duncan sits on the board of Group 1 Automotive; Wendy Gramm, serves as a director for AMVESCAP PLC/Invesco Funds Group; Robert Jaedicke is a member of the board of the California Water Service Group; Ken Lay, who has resigned from Eli Lilly and Compaq's boards, sits on the NewPower Holdings board; John Mendelsohn is a member of the ImClone Systems board; Frank Savage serves as a director for Lockheed Martin, Qualcomm, and Alliance Capital Management; John Wakeham is a board member to Bristol & West PLC, Vosper Thornycroft Holding PLC, Michael Page International PLC, and Rothchilds Continuation Holdings; and Herbert Winokur is a board member at NATCO Group, CCC Information Services Group and DynCorp.

AFL-CIO To Cos: Purge Enron Directors From Your Boards
By Phyllis Plitch

Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Faulting Enron Corp.'s (ENRNQ) board of directors for its role in the energy company's collapse, the AFL-CIO is calling on other companies to refrain from renominating the directors to their own boards.
In letters sent to 21 companies, the labor federation's secretary-treasurer, Richard Trumka, cited the Enron directors' decision to waive conflict-of-interest rules to let Enron executives participate in related-party transactions, among other things. 
"The future retirement security of practically every American worker was hurt by the collapse of Enron," Trumka said in a press release. "In our opinion, directors who permitted the accounting deception that led to the collapse of a company worth over $70 billion dollars are not suited to serve on other boards." 
Trumka noted Enron's bankruptcy filing, multiple investigations into its accounting practices and the "evaporation" of $70 billion in market capitalization. 
He criticized board members for their failure to raise questions about "Enron's extensive use of off-balance-sheet entities to remove debt and losses" from financial statements and "for the company's overall lack of transparency." 
AFL-CIO affiliate union sponsored benefit funds have more than $400 billion in assets and the organization estimates the funds lost more than $1 billion. 
An Enron spokesman said it was premature to make comments about issues under investigation. Individual board members either didn't immediately return a call for comment or couldn't immediately be reached.

Auditors for U.S. Contractors Restricted in Consulting Work
2002-01-25 16:59 (New York)

     Washington, Jan. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Accounting firms auditing federal payments to Lockheed Martin Corp., General Dynamics Corp. and other contractors will be barred from many kinds of consulting work for those clients.
     U.S. Comptroller General David M. Walker, who oversees U.S. government auditing standards, announced the restrictions as Congress considers similar limits on accounting firms working in the private sector, following Enron Corp.'s collapse.
     The new consulting restrictions apply to all federal agencies, nearly all state and local agencies, and defense contractors, health maintenance organizations, hospitals or other organizations that get federal money. For private-sector companies, the restrictions apply to the parts of their businesses funded by the federal government.
     ``This standard represents an important step to enhance the independence of external auditors and better protect the public,'' said Walker, who heads the U.S. General Accounting Office. The consulting limits will take effect on Oct. 1.
     Congressional investigations are examining the issue of auditor independence as part of the investigation of Arthur Andersen LLP, which made $27 million from non-audit work for Enron in 2000, more than the $25 million it was paid as auditor.

Restrictions on Audits

     The comptroller general's standards would prohibit auditors from reviewing their firm's own consulting work or performing management functions or decisions. Accounting firm employees who work as consultants won't be permitted to assist with audits.
     Accounting firms opposed the new rule on grounds it would be inconsistent with the standards in the private sector, the comptroller general said. The firms also contended that the new standards ``could cause a hardship'' on clients who pay the same firm for audit and consulting services, the announcement said.
     The Securities and Exchange Commission, Congress and accountants have debated for years whether consulting fees may make auditors reluctant to challenge questionable accounting by clients. In 2000, accounting firms blocked a proposed SEC ban similar to the new federal rule.
     Spokesman for the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants declined immediate comment. Spokesmen at Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics, both of which have headquarters in Washington suburbs, couldn't be reached.
     Walker's plan had been opposed by the AICPA, the trade group that blocked the SEC's attempt two years ago to prevent possible conflicts of interest at firms that do other work for audit clients.

Congressional Demands

     The GAO standards were announced a day after members from both parties in Congress urged tougher standards during hearings yesterday on Enron's collapse and its implications for auditors.
Former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt, who led the fight for a consulting ban two years ago, asked Congress to consider a legislative response.
     Among the most common consulting services provided by accounting firms are to set up and manage computer networks for clients and establish financial management systems that provide data used in their financial reports.
     In 2000, Lockheed Martin paid Ernst & Young LLP $6 million for its audit and $16 million for other services, and General Dynamics paid Andersen $4.2 million in audit fees and $9.5 million for other work, according to filings with the SEC.
     Spokesmen at Andersen, Ernst & Young, and the Deloitte & Touche firm couldn't be reached.
     Walker urged the large accounting firms to tighten their own conflict-of-interest standards for the private sector. The firms are in talks with SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt about forming a private sector group to oversee accountant discipline and audit review.

IN THE MONEY: Enron Loan Shrinks; Is Liquidation Next?
By Carol S. Remond

A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The financing is disappearing fast. Will the company follow?
Enron Corp.'s (ENRNQ) much trumpeted $1.5 billion interim financing, designed to help the distressed energy company get back on its feet as it restructures under bankruptcy protection, has quickly and quietly been shrinking. 
The loan was preliminarily approved by Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez on Dec. 3, just a day after the company filed for bankruptcy. But Enron's lead bankers J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and Citigroup (C) soon found out that other banks, worried about their own exposure to Enron, weren't willing to take on any new Enron financing, and the loan was halved. 
The original loan agreement, referred to as debtor-in-possession financing, or DIP, was conditional on a full syndication of the financing and the return of $550 million in credit that J.P. Morgan and Citigroup had extended to Enron in November. 
Court documents show that meetings to approve Enron's interim financing have been postponed three times already. A meeting is now scheduled for Feb. 13. 
The final size of Enron's financing is yet to be decided, but the credit facility could "shrink down south of $500 million," a banker familiar with the financing said. 
Meantime, now that Enron has unloaded its most valuable asset, its energy trading operations, to UBS AG in exchange for a share of future revenues, it's unclear just how much, if anything, remains to be salvaged. 
This might mean that Enron's bankruptcy could turn into a liquidation rather than the earlier-described rescue operation, some observers suggest. 
"It's possible that they won't need a DIP after all," a bankruptcy lawyer said. "They're going to focus on asset sales, and it's possible that very little will be left at the end." 
Indeed, J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup made the first $250 million DIP installment available to Enron in early December, but Enron has yet to tap the credit facility. 
"We don't need the money right now," said Martin Bienenstock, an attorney for lawfirm Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP which represents Enron. He said Enron currently has around $1 billion in cash. 
Regardless, additional financing from the DIP lenders is contingent upon J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup approving Enron's new business plan. The two banks turned back a plan submitted by the company in early January, asking Enron to provide more details about asset sales and receivables, people familiar with the matter said. 
A banker said Enron is now in the process of doing "a more thorough 'bottom up' analysis of its actual cash needs." 
Creditors of a bankrupt company often fight to minimize the interim financing because of the high cost of such loans. Enron's DIP loan carries an interest of 350 basis points, or 3.5 percentage points, over the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR. 
Given that under bankruptcy law, DIP financing is senior to all other loans, Enron creditors are also likely to resist letting assets already used to securitize some of Enron's numerous liabilities be subrogated to the collaterization of Enron's interim financing. 
Enron lawyer Bienenstock said the company and its banks will agree on the new DIP amount before the meeting scheduled for Feb 13.

POWER POINTS: Not So Fast On Enron Liquidation Theory
By Mark Golden

A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) story of the week is that it's really headed toward a liquidation, not reorganization.
Don't buy the idea too quickly, but don't buy Enron stock, either. 
While it seems clear that Enron's debts will greatly outweigh its assets, there are several profitable parts of Enron that could easily continue to operate under a reorganized company, though almost certainly after changing its name. 
"In most large cases, if there's a reasonable expectation that a profitable company will emerge, the creditors' committee will support reorganization," said bankruptcy attorney Bruce Borrus of Riddell Williams in Seattle, a member of the American Bar Association's bankruptcy committee. "The company as a going concern will often be more valuable than the value of the liquidated assets." 
Enron's natural gas pipelines, except for the one that it must sell to Dynegy Inc. (DYN), could form the basis for a profitable future Enron that is worth more to creditors than total liquidation. To that foundation, Enron's coming reorganization proposal likely will add its share of the UBS/Enron future trading profits and its Enron Energy Services division. Even if recent reports of hidden losses are true, EES is almost certainly profitable now as a result of the bankruptcy process, which allowed the unit to shed hundreds of contracts. 
That's not the "Big E" of old, but it's not a small company, either. Enron Jr. could have several billion in assets. 
In addition, creditors will get a tax benefit from an ongoing Enron which could carry forward operational losses for years, said Lynn LoPucki, bankruptcy professor at UCLA law school. Congress has been trying to crack down on the trafficking of such tax benefits for decades, LoPucki said. A company that has real assets and a real operational business is much more likely to carry forward the losses and tax benefits successfully. 

First, The Shedding 

Enron is already selling its noncore assets as well as its oft-described "crown jewel" - its U.S. wholesale energy trading unit, including traders, back-office systems and EnronOnline technology. The sale to UBS AG (UBS) unit UBS Warburg doesn't include Enron's trading book, the value of which has deteriorated substantially due to contract terminations. 
To be sure, Enron's traders had built up a lot of value. Energy traders have said for months that Enron wisely shorted the market while U.S. natural gas and western power prices plunged from peaks reached in the first half of 2001. When Enron filed Chapter 11, it estimated the value of the portfolio at between $5 billion and $7 billion. 
Last week, when the sale was approved in bankruptcy court, Enron Chief Financial Officer Jeff McMahon said the energy book is now worth $1.3 billion. Enron's failure to deliver contracted gas and power killed many deals and much of the book's value. 
Enron spokesman Eric Thode clarified McMahon's statement this week, saying that $1.3 billion is the value primarily of the physical contracts that Enron hasn't defaulted on. 
Terminating financial contracts is more difficult for Enron's counterparties. The majority of gas and power deals done by Enron in the past couple of years haven't been for actual physical delivery of gas or power, but instead simply guaranteed energy prices and are settled monthly in cash. Depending on the terms of the contracts, some customers can't just walk away from their high-priced financial deals the way they can from physical deals when delivery is in question. 
"There may be value in those contracts," Thode said. "We have tens of thousands of contracts to work through." 
Calpine Corp. (CPN), for example, will have to pay Enron perhaps as much as $160 million under the liquidation terms of its contract with Enron. 
Some companies that have decided they can walk away from mark-to-market losses to Enron may find themselves sued by Enron or its estate, several industry sources said. Those defendants could argue that bankrupt Enron had no ability to protect them from a market upswing, so why should they be forced to cover their losses. It's like someone being forced to pay a premium to an insurance company that can't possibly pay a claim. 
This could take years of litigation and negotiation, but eventually result in significant cash for Enron - another reason for creditors to see Enron emerge from reorganization. 
Enron's sale of its trading operation - without portfolio - to UBS Warburg (UBS) is structured to result in the continued existence of Enron. Enron got nothing up front for creditors, but gets a third of profits for 10 years. UBS looks to be serious about doing big volumes of business and it isn't afraid to take risks. Maybe Enron executives kept in mind their own career opportunities outside of Enron when they negotiated the UBS deal. 
Add Enron Energy Services to the future business. Though EES' past profits now are in question, it's unquestionably a profitable business going forward because the bankruptcy court allowed Enron to drop hundreds of contracts that were money losers. EES has been doing everything possible to maintain deliveries under the remaining, profitable contracts, apparently with a lot of success. 
The likely continuation of an Enron, however, means little to current Enron shareholders, attorney Borrus said. Unless Enron can pay its creditors in full, the creditors will be issued equity in the new Enron, and current Enron stock will be worthless.

USA: Grand jury investigating Milberg Weiss - source.

01/25/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

LOS ANGELES, Jan 25 (Reuters) - A federal grand jury is investigating Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach, a shareholder class action lawsuits specialist, over allegations the firm improperly gave money to plaintiffs to appear in its lawsuits, a source familiar with the matter said on Friday. 
The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, would not provide further details. But according to the Los Angeles Times, Steven Cooperman, a Beverly Hills eye surgeon convicted of faking the theft of two famous paintings, is assisting in the investigation.
A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office had no comment on the matter. 
A spokeswoman for Milberg Weiss said it was "fully cooperating" with all inquiries, but would not confirm or deny whether the firm was under investigation. 
Milberg Weiss is famed for filing class action lawsuits on behalf of shareholders of publicly traded companies. The law firm has filed numerous recent lawsuits on behalf of shareholders of bankrupt energy trading firm Enron Corp. . 
Cooperman, who was convicted in 1999 of conspiracy, wire fraud and money laundering for the case, has been a plaintiff in more than 36 shareholder lawsuits, some of them filed by Milberg Weiss, according to the Times. 
He was sentenced to 37 months in prison last July. 
Investigators are looking into whether Cooperman and others may have received improper payments to appear in the lawsuits. The case is being investigated by a federal grand jury in Los Angeles.

Enron's conscientious objector tried to challenge from inside
By JEFF DONN
Associated Press Writer

Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

HOUSTON (AP) - She was Texas' best: homegrown, church-schooled, smart, the next hope of an influential family in a small town outside Houston. But she wanted to be somebody beyond the oil wells and scrubby plains. 
Today, she is. Sherron Smith Watkins has emerged as the most prescient and principled voice yet in the financing morass that swamped energy dealer Enron Corp.
If a rebel, though, Watkins is no Eastern-style whistle-blower or protester. By the accounts so far, she did not threaten to go public. She did not quit. Call her the public face of Enron's loyal opposition, which tried to save it from the biggest business bankruptcy in U.S. history. 
"She just felt duty-bound to do it, for the company's sake," said her mother, Shirley Klein Harrington. 
Of course, doing your duty isn't always easy - and it wasn't for Watkins. She wasn't just worried about Enron when she told former chairman Ken Lay that good ethics could be good business. She fretted about losing her job in retaliation for her blunt words. 
"It was not easy for her to come forward because the environment was such and the culture was such that ... everything seemed to be accepted," said her Houston lawyer, Philip Hilder, who specializes in white-collar crime cases. "It took a person with a lot of moxie and fortitude." 
Apparently sorting out her own liabilities and waiting to testify for investigators, she is refusing interview requests. 
Ordinarily, though, she "speaks her mind, and she's a competitor," said her mother. "I think she was born with it." 
Even now, fewer than 10,000 people live in Tomball, Watkins' hometown about 20 miles northwest of Houston. But her roots grew not so much from prairie sod as from the professional and commercial worlds. 
Her father is a Houston lawyer; her stepfather, a former school superintendent and now mayor of Tomball. Her mother taught accounting in high schools. One uncle owns a local supermarket and another, a funeral parlor. A nonconformist, cousin Lyle Lovett took up country singing. 
The family had just two girls, and they were treated pretty much as equals to boys, said her mother. Watkins used to hunt duck and deer. It was good training for Enron, where she would joust with traders and accountants on corporate terrain long dominated by men. 
"She's a pretty aggressive person," said a colleague who is still working at Enron and so asked that her name not be used. "She expects a lot of people. If they're not pulling their weight ... she just zeros in on them, and she just rips them apart." 
"She was working in a very rough-and-tumble ... company, and if she didn't have those qualities, she wouldn't be able to survive," her lawyer said. 
With English and German blood, she went to Lutheran parochial school. At home and school, she learned that some things were OK - and some weren't. "Because this is a conservative community, there are very definite lines," said Sommy L. Ham, managing editor of the weekly Tomball Magnolia Tribune. 
Still, by eighth grade, Watkins was challenging authority. It was enough to make her mother pity her teacher. By high school, she was showing her mother's ease with numbers. 
She snared both bachelor's and master's degrees in a five-year accelerated accounting program, finishing in 1982 at the University of Texas, one of the country's best schools for the field. In a class taught by Phillip Langefeld, she studied cases where businesses misled investors. 
"She had an extremely good ability to analyze situations and to make comments and recommend based on what she thought was right," recalls Langefeld, now an Austin accountant. 
Degrees in hand, she landed work near home in Houston at Arthur Andersen, one of the profession's elite companies - well before its Enron embarrassments. She later transferred to New York City where she lived for several years. She leased a house with friends in the Hamptons on Long Island, developed a fancy for global finance and left Andersen for Metallgesellschaft. The German trading conglomerate lost so much money in oil trading in the early 1990s that it eventually needed a bank bailout to skirt bankruptcy. 
Watkins got out. Eight years ago, she came back to Houston to work for Enron. Like her, it was young, fast, and self-confident. It swelled in those years, at least by its calculations, into the seventh biggest American corporation. 
Over the next several years, Watkins worked its mergers and acquisitions and its fiber-optic cable division. For a time, she was jetting back and forth to South Korea. 
Her discomfort, though, began to surface several years ago. Uneasy with accounting methods in one Enron partnership, she was allowed to transfer to another branch of the company in 1996. 
But she could find comfort in her own family now. Married to an executive in a Canadian oil company, she gave birth to a girl over two years ago and took on the additional job of mother. She took it seriously, like her other work. She went to programs on child discipline and put her daughter in Sunday school at her Presbyterian church. 
She no longer scuba dives as she once did. But she has kept her taste for the good life and the world beyond southeast Texas. She lives with her husband and daughter in a big, renovated two-story house in a just-so district of Houston near Rice University. Homes shaded by live oaks favor brick or stucco, you can buy used books and eat hummus, and joggers puff through quiet streets in the pre-dawn humidity before heading off to work. Watkins, now 42, works out at her church gym and a university track. 
At Enron, things turned much worse last year, as recession thickened and Enron stock values crashed. Some executives began cashing out their stock. Watkins' lawyer won't say what she did with hers. Her mother isn't sure how her daughter handled her own stock, but Watkins never advised her mom to sell. She didn't and said she lost a small sum. 
At midyear, Watkins began working for chief financial officer Andrew Fastow. Increasingly, she fretted about partnerships he set up. To her understanding, they were backed by shaky financing, open to conflicts of interest, and endorsed by accounting sleights of hand. She quietly asked for advice from colleagues she trusted. Some were asking similar questions in private. 
The abrupt departure of chief executive Jeff Skilling in August made Watkins even more nervous. She feared the burst of public attention would force the hidden deals into the light and make the company "implode in a wave of accounting scandals," according to the seven-page memo she wrote to Lay, then chairman. 
At first submitting the memo anonymously, she later expanded it and added her name. Lay met with her, ordered an internal inquiry, and in a move designed to get her out of Fastow's supervision, made her vice president for corporate development. 
In October, Enron was forced to acknowledge losses it had long buried in the partnerships. Investor confidence quickly crumbled, Enron requested bankruptcy protection, and shareholders and workers sued. On Wednesday, Lay, who was chief architect and overseer of Enron almost since its founding in 1985, resigned his post. 
Meanwhile, Watkins' lawyer said she is overwhelmed by hundreds of requests for interviews. Neighbor Chris Cagley, also an accountant who contracted with Enron, has watched from close up. 
"It's a lot of stress ... in terms of the legal risk and just the attention. I don't think she's the sort of person to seek attention," 
Given that, she appears to be holding up well. "I would be falling apart," said friend and next-door neighbor, Charlotte Ten Brink. "She maintains her sense of humor. We joked about who will play her in the movie: She usually laughs and takes it all in stride." 
"She's praying to keep her job and that the company survives," adds her mother. 
She still goes to work at Enron, where she has taken on a different title: vice president of communication. She expects to be doing plenty of communicating in coming months with lawyers, investigators, and reporters. She's somebody beyond her dreams, beyond her wishes.

Enron spread its net far and wide in bid to protect its business interests

The dollar trail snaked from Enron Corp.'s hometown of Houston to the Texas capital of Austin to Washington, D.C. Along the way, politicians who could help the energy trader got money for their campaign chests. 
>From there, the largesse of the company and its employees extended well beyond George W. Bush, Texas' top elected officials and nearly half of Congress. Their charity donations built a web of goodwill nationwide while benefitting individuals and causes from cat shelters to art museums, from Christian missionaries to Planned Parenthood.
Former Enron chief executive Kenneth Lay, who resigned from his job this week but remains on Enron's board of directors, was known in Houston as the man to woo for favors and contributions to charitable causes and civic improvement projects. 
"Enron operated in a way that was reminiscent of the way tobacco companies historically operated before they came under so much fire," said Bill Miller, a political consultant based in Austin who has worked for both Democrats and Republicans. "If you asked for $5,000, they might say, 'Well wouldn't $10,000 be better?"' 
Some Enron observers insist the company was simply doing an effective job protecting its interests at various political levels while being a good corporate citizen in Houston and beyond. But critics say the strategy was carefully planned to buy influence and improve the company's bottom line. 
"The ways they did it weren't unique, but they did it more aggressively than anyone else," said Andrew Wheat, research director for Texans for Public Justice, a group critical of Enron's contributions to state politicians in Texas and national politicians around the country. 
The donations are facing more scrutiny after the company's rapid collapse into bankruptcy late last year, following revelations that it hid billions of dollars of debt in a series of partnerships that benefited some company executives. It has raised questions of whether Enron managed to avoid scrutiny of its often secretive operations that might have revealed the company's problems earlier. 
"Maybe they trimmed the edges off of policies that would have been quite objectionable," said Daron Shaw, a government professor at the University of Texas in Austin. "Since they were working both sides of the aisle, they wanted to minimize the chances of maximum regret." 
An Enron spokesman said the company, once listed No. 7 on the Fortune 500 list, and its top executives acted no differently than any other top businesses and their leaders. 
The political contributions were "something every company does to support like-minded individuals that support the efforts of a particular company," said the spokesman, Eric Thode. 
And he said it was a "travesty" that people might criticize Enron's charitable donations, saying "it's a figment of the imagination that there is anything sinister about being a good corporate citizen." 
Of the $5.77 million in contributions to candidates the company has made since 1989, nearly three-fourths went to Republicans. In the 2000 election, it gave $2.4 million to individual candidates, political action committees and soft money contributions to political parties, said the Center for Responsive Politics, a campaign finance watchdog group. 
Over those 12 years, according to the center, 71 current senators and 188 House members have benefited from Enron's donations. Topping the list were Texas' two Republican senators, Kay Bailey Hutchison and Phil Gramm, each receiving almost $100,000, and seven Texan representatives led by Democrat Ken Bentsen with $42,750. 
Enron was a major contributor to the Bush presidential campaign and donated $100,000 for the Bush-Cheney inaugural gala last a year ago, a sum matched by Lay and his wife. 
Gramm's wife Wendy is on Enron's board and also served on its audit committee, which is supposed to keep a close watch on the company's financial practices. By their own accounting, the Gramms lost nearly $700,000 in stock options when the company went under. Wendy Gramm collected between $915,000 and $1.85 million from Enron in salary, attendance fees, stock options and dividends between 1993 and 2001, according to Public Citizen, a Washington watchdog group. 
Wendy Gramm took a seat on Enron's board in 1993, just five weeks after resigning as chairwoman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, where she pushed through a key regulatory exemption that benefited Enron. 
She heads the regulatory studies program at George Mason University's Mercatus Center, which received $50,000 from Enron since 1996, less than 1 percent of total corporate gifts to Mercatus. 
Gramm said he had no warning of the company's bankruptcy or its dire financial situation. And he said his wife had done nothing wrong from her vantage point on Enron's board and audit committee. 
Another board member on the audit committee, Lord John Wakeham, a former leader of the British House of Commons, received a $72,000 yearly consulting contract for "services rendered" to Enron's European arm, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And Enron board member Herbert S. Winokur Jr. is a managing partner of the company that owns the National Tank Co., which had $370,294 in sales to Enron subsidiaries. 
The side deals with board members raise serious questions about their ability to perform their duty of making sure top managers were doing their jobs, said Harold Star, a management professor and corporate governance expert at the State University of New York at Buffalo. 
"You've got a board that's passive, co-opted and basically corrupted in terms of its role," Star said. 
Enron board members also had ties around the country through their charitable contributions. For example, Robert Belfer, the company's largest shareholder, and his wife gave $7.5 million for the Robert and Renee Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. He graduated from the school. 
Lay and his wife Linda gave generously to causes primarily based in Houston through the Linda and Ken Lay Family foundation, which donated $2,546,771 in 2000, according to Internal Revenue Service records. 
The foundation also contributed to out-of-state groups, including $10,000 to the American Dance Festival in New York; $28,900 to the Washington, D.C.-based Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy; $125,000 to the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago; $6,700 to Knox Theological Seminary in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; $60,000 to Louisiana State University's Manship School of Mass Communications; and $6,627 to Ozarks Public TV in Springfield, Mo. 
Lay's influence alone was profound in Houston, where he had a sterling reputation as one of the city's most prominent movers and shakers. 
Miller, the political consultant, said he and other lobbyists asked for Lay's help several years ago when a problem finding financing for a parking garage threatened a plan to bring a basketball arena to Houston. 
"He sent a memo to some CEOs for a meeting in Houston, and it meant forking over a lot of money, millions of dollars," Miller said. "When the meeting was over, the deal was done. You can only do that if you are giving a lot of money or helping a lot of other people make money." 
It was Lay's connection to influential black groups in Houston that helped get out the vote in favor of a successful 1996 referendum to build a new baseball stadium that would be named Enron Field, said David Walden, chief of staff to Houston Mayor Bob Lanier from 1992 to 1998. 
Walden said he believes Lay worked to improve Houston out of a sense of civic duty. 
"He thought it was important for the image of the city to have the stadium downtown," Walden said. "Having pro sports franchises and the ballet was a great recruiting tool and the folks he wanted to attract (as Enron employees) paid attention to those things," Walden said. 
But Enron's generosity was also aimed at impressing influential people with the power to help or hurt the company, said Ralph Estes, accounting professor emeritus at American University and the author of "Tyranny of the Bottom Line: Why Corporations Make Good People Do Bad Things." 
"Most of the rationale is that somehow it will pay off on the bottom line," he said. "It's calculated to pay a dividend, and these actions can keep the wolves from the door."

CAPITAL VIEWS: Enron, Stimulus & More On 'Phraseology'
By John Connor

01/25/2002
Dow Jones Capital Markets Report
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan sees a silver lining in the Enron debacle.
"I'm surprised, as I suspect most of us are, at the extraordinary interest that has been devoted to this particular episode," Greenspan told the Senate Budget Committee Thursday. "And I think it's a very good sign. 
"I think that it tells us that because the whole structure of American business is so fundamentally based on trust, that any abrogation of that trust creates a real furor, which it should," the Fed chairman added. 
"Think of the worst outcome, namely, that we went through this particular episode and nobody cared," he said. 
"We are increasingly getting firms which are conceptual, and Enron being a classic case, whose value depends increasingly on reputation and trust," Greenspan continued. "And if you breach that, that value goes away very rapidly." 
He said an abrogation of goodwill clearly has happened in the Enron case and that this has been taken very seriously by peoplein the U.S. "And I think that's very good," he said of the reaction. 
Sen. Jon Corzine, D-N.J., the onetime major-domo of Goldman Sachs, wondered if the Enron mess can so call into question the efficacy of accounting standards and investments as to have an impact broadly applicable to the economy, leading perhaps to an increase in the cost of capital and to serious concerns by foreigners who have been investing in the U.S. 
"It just strikes me that this runs the risk of truly undermining businss and consumer confidence in a way that is not given the centerpiece," Sen. Corzine said. 
Greenspan wasn't buying it. "I actually don't have that concern," he told the senator. He said the extraordinary response to Enron is "an indication that people in this society have - require that we maintain a very high standard of trustworthiness in our business operations." 
Greenspan said that "the reaction, I think, is going to create a really major rethinking in a lot of people about whether there is a spin game going on with respect to information coming of business and into the investment community." He said, "I think we're going to find there's going to be a good deal less of that and that the old issue of competing for reputation is going to reemerge." 
On fiscal policy, Greenspan let considerable air out of the ongoing stimulus debate on Capitol Hill, telling the Senate panel that "I myself am conflicted on the issue" and that "it's not clear that we might need that insurance." 
Republicans and Democrats have been duking it out since last autumn on stimulus. The pace quickened in recent days, with Senate Republican Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., depicting Senate Majority Thomas Daschle, D-S.D., as a poster boy for obstructionism and Daschle calling the Republican hand by putting a slimmed-down stimulus plan on the Senate floor as the second session of the 107th Congress got underway. 
Greenspan said he hasn't come to a conclusion on the need for a stimulus package. He said there are pluses and minuses. And then he said, "I do not think it is a critically important issue to do. 
"I think the economy will recover in any event," he added. 
Elsewhere, as has been widely noted, Greenspan also spiked his Jan. 11 San Francisco commentary about "significant risks" and put a happier glow on his economic outlook. 
Greenspan explained that he was talking Jan. 11 to markets (that "have been assuming a far more rapid snapback than I frankly think is likely to happen") and that he used "a phraseology which, in retrospect, I should have done differently, which sort of has implied that I didn't think that the economy was in the process of turning. And I tried to rectify that in today's remarks." 
Extraordinary, as the man himself might put it. 
Included in Greenspan's explanation was what might be called a central banker's lament: "It's very difficult, in giving any speech of, say, 20 minutes, 25 minutes, to capture a particular view at a complex time such as this."

Enron Asks Ct For Quick OK Of India Unit Sale To BG Grp
By Kathy Chu

Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
(This report was first published late Thursday.) 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Bankrupt Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) is asking a federal bankruptcy court for speedy approval of its Enron Oil & Gas India unit sale to BG Group PLC (BRG) for $350 million cash.
The transaction must be completed by Feb. 15, according to court documents, or BG Group, a U.K. oil and gas company, can walk away. 
An "overwhelming need" exists to promptly close the sale, the distressed company said in a filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York. Failure to "expeditiously authorize the approval of the sale of EOGIL will adversely affect the ability to close on this valuable transaction," according to Enron. 
The operation, or management rights, of Enron's upstream oil and gas assets in India is not a condition of the re-negotiated deal. 
The energy-trading company - which originally signed a deal to sell the assets to BG for $388 million - is asking the bankruptcy court for an early February hearing to consider approval of the transaction. 
Enron's deal with BG Group represents its "highest and best offer," the bankrupt company said, and comes after about 18 months of talks with more than 70 different parties. 
BG Group couldn't immediately be reached for comment. 
The purchase price is subject to working-capital adjustments of $66 million, as well as a $10 million fee-and-service payment to Enron subsidiaries. 
Enron has agreed to transfer certain computer equipment and provide operational support for 60 days to BG Group. With the deal, Enron believes that it will be "burdened" with the continuing costs of maintaining the unit, which conducts upstream oil and gas activities and owns interests in three production-sharing contracts with the Government of India. 
Enron Oil and Gas India has more than 200 employees. 
Enron Asset Holdings LLC - the parent of Enron Oil and Gas India - will escrow net proceeds of the sale transaction. The funds could be subject to any claims by Enron's post-petition lenders, according to court documents. 
Jeffrey B. Sherrick, president of the unit, will resign his position upon completion of the deal. He will remain a director of the company until BG Group appoints its own board members. 
The sale of the unit, incorporated in the Cayman Islands, is part of Enron's attempt to focus on its core operations. 
Since filing for bankruptcy Dec. 2, the company's efforts to shed away some of its 3,500 subsidiaries - expected to give it a better shot at successfully reorganizing - have intensified. Enron has fielded offers for its turbines, generators, power-plant projects, and oil and gas interests, among other assets, according to the filing. 
Late Thursday, Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez - who is overseeing Enron's Chapter 11 case - scheduled a hearing to consider the sale of the Enron unit for Feb. 13 at 2 p.m. EST. 
The court, on that day, is also expected to address the bankrupt company's final debtor-in-possession financing proposal.

Enron LNG Shipping Co Files For Chapter 11 Protection

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Another Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) subsidiary has filed for Chapter 11 court protection, bringing the distressed company's bankrupt units to 38.
Enron LNG Shipping Co., in a late Thursday filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York, listed total assets of $952,099 and total debts of $935,331, excluding off-balance sheet transactions and contingent obligations. 
The unit, which charters liquefied natural gas tankers for company affiliates, is entirely owned by Enron Global LNG - also under bankruptcy court protection. 
Enron LNG Shipping has no secured creditors and doesn't list its 20 largest unsecured creditors, stating instead that this portion of the application is "not applicable." 
The unit, incorporated in Grand Cayman of the Cayman Islands, is being pledged as collateral under Enron Corp.'s credit agreements, including a debtor-in-possession financing led by J.P. Morgan Chase (JPM) and Citigroup Inc. (C). 
The bankruptcy court has assigned Enron LNG case number 02-10346. 
The beleaguered company and its units began filing for Chapter 11 Dec. 2. It's the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history.

nother trough digging into the East (temperatures normal to below normal) w=
ith the primary ridge remaining in the Southwest (above to much above).

2) 1-5 Day forecast also looks similar still quite cool for the East and Mi=
dwest - though not quite as hot for the immediate West Coast.  Above to muc=
h above normal temperatures will be common across interior California for m=
ost of the week with a 1 to 2 day spike of warm temperatures near the coast=
 mid-week.  No prolonged period of heat will affect the Northwest. =20

NEW YORK, Jan. 13 /PRNewswire/ -- Last fall, Commerce Secretary Donald Evan=
s, who was halfway around the world in Moscow on a trade mission, reached o=
ut to Enron CEO Kenneth Lay in Houston to discuss with him Enron's disastro=
usly controversial, financially-draining electricity plant in India. Specif=
ically, Evans suggested that Lay consult with Sig Rogich, a veteran Republi=
can PR man (and another friend of the Bush family), who was on his way to N=
ew Delhi to pitch his services to the government. Perhaps Rogich could soot=
he the locals, who had been loudly accusing Enron of price-gouging, report =
Chief Political Correspondent Howard Fineman and Investigative Corresponden=
t Michael Isikoff. While such calls are typical, what makes this one notewo=
rthy is the date on which it took place, October 15. On that day, Lay knew =
that his world was about to fall apart.
(Photo: http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20020113/NYSU004 )=20
In a conference call with Wall Street analysts the next day, Lay would have=
 to disclose that Enron, the largest energy trading company in the world, h=
ad lost an astounding $618 million in the third quarter. More important, he=
 would be forced to admit that Enron had lost $1.2 billion in a labyrinth o=
f partnerships that hadn't been -- but should have been -- counted on the c=
ompany's books. The company was near collapse. In the January 21 issue of N=
ewsweek (on newsstands Monday, January 14). Fineman and Isikoff write that =
while Evans was an old friend in the Texas energy business, he and Lay say =
they did not discuss the impending crisis.=20
The company, which imploded last December 2, produced the largest bankruptc=
y in American history and now the shockwaves have moved from Enron headquar=
ters in Houston and Wall Street to Washington. The Lay-Evans call, it turns=
 out, was the prelude to a flurry of others (all initiated by Lay) in which=
 the Enron chief executive emitted increasingly urgent distress signals to =
Evans, Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Gr=
eenspan. But Lay apparently got no help, Fineman and Isikoff write. White H=
ouse officials insist that he never contacted them and they never contacted=
 him, even though he was running (into the ground) the seventh largest corp=
oration in the country and the second largest in Texas. They flatly deny th=
at President George W. Bush or Vice President Dick Cheney (or any aides) ha=
d direct knowledge of Enron's predicament. No evidence surfaced last week t=
o contradict their story and the Bushies point out with relief that someone=
 else had called O'Neill on Enron's behalf: Robert Rubin, the highly-regard=
ed (Democratic) Treasury Secretary under Bill Clinton and now a leader of C=
itigroup, one of Enron's largest creditors. And though Lay and Enron papere=
d the Congress with campaign donations to Republicans and Democrats alike, =
six committees were planning to investigate.=20
Lay built his business by getting regulatory relief from Congress - from Re=
publicans, to be sure, but from the Democrats as well. There were silent pa=
rtners in the myriad Enron off-the-books secret partnerships. They might in=
clude, inconveniently, a fair number of the Democrat's top donors. Numerous=
 officials in and around the White House have or had extensive financial ti=
es to Lay and Enron. They include political adviser Karl Rove, economic adv=
iser Larry Lindsay and GOP Chairman Marc Racicot, who last week declared th=
at he would cease lobbying work. Lay is also the biggest individual contrib=
utor to President Bush's presidential and Texas gubernatorial campaigns. In=
vestigators will also have numerous contacts to examine. On October 29, Lay=
 called Evans and discussed with him the impending lowering of Enron's cred=
it rating. Lay talked with O'Neill twice, and Enron's president Greg Whalle=
y, had several conversations with Under Secretary Peter R. Fisher. Lay's at=
torney, Robert Bennett, tells Newsweek that his client was merely "doing th=
e responsible thing" by informing officials of "the possibility of bankrupt=
cy" at Enron.=20
Enron, writes Wall Street Editor Allan Sloan, turned out to be another bubb=
le. However, unlike a Pets.com or a Webvan, whose implosions did little dam=
age outside of costing dice-rolling speculators some money and techies some=
 jobs, the Enron bubble exploded like a grenade: stockholders and lenders a=
re out tens of billions of dollars; at least 20,000 Enron employees have lo=
st their jobs and many of them have lost their retirement savings too. And =
the collateral damage keeps spreading. Prominent among the wounded is Arthu=
r Anderson, Enron's outside auditor, which admitted last week that some emp=
loyees destroyed documents, has been tarnished to the point that the Big Fi=
ve accounting firms might shrink to the Big Four. Wall Street's credibility=
 has been shattered. Utilities deregulation, for which Enron was the poster=
 boy, is now on the back burner. The spectacle of impoverished, unemployed =
Enronites has thrown a harsh spotlight on the risks of 401(k) accounts stuf=
fed with company stock. And confidence in financial markets has been shaken=
 too.=20
Sloan reports that Enron's end is emblematic of a wholesale systemic failur=
e. The multi-layered system of checks and balances that is supposed to keep=
 a company from running amok completely broke down. Executives of public co=
mpanies have legal and moral requirements to produce honest books and recor=
ds, but at Enron, they didn't do that. Outside auditors are supposed to mak=
e sure that a company's financial reports not only meet the letter of accou=
nting rules but also give investors and lenders a fair and accurate picture=
 of what's going on, but Enron's auditor, Arthur Anderson, failed that test=
. Regulators didn't regulate and Enron's board of directors didn't direct. =
In reconstructing Enron's fall, Sloan, who first reported on Enron's demise=
 in the December 10, 2001 issue of Newsweek and again on December 17, 2001,=
 identifies the "too-clever-by-half" financial structures that Enron plante=
d that led to its undoing and how and why those off-the-books partnerships =
worked for so long without detection.=20
(Articles attached. Read Newsweek's news releases at=20
http://www.Newsweek.MSNBC.com. Click "Pressroom.") To George W. Bush, the h=
ead of Enron was 'Kenny Boy' - until now. As the shock waves from the large=
st bankruptcy in U.S. history shake Washington, the scandal machine is cran=
king up in search of a White House connection. Let the Enron Wars begin.=20
Lights Out: Enron's Failed Power Play=20

Commerce Secretary Donald Evans was busy, halfway around the world in Mosco=
w, but not too busy to reach out to Ken Lay in Houston last fall. "Kenny Bo=
y," as President George W. Bush had nicknamed him, was not just any CEO. He=
 was the Big Enchilada of Texas business, head of Enron, the largest energy=
-trading company in the world -- and the biggest sugar daddy in Bush's poli=
tical career. So although Evans was conducting a trade mission to Russia (t=
he first trip abroad by a cabinet member after September 11), he took time =
to call Lay to discuss Enron's money-losing power plant in India. Specifica=
lly, Evans suggested that Lay consult with Sig Rogich, a veteran Republican=
 PR man (and another Bush family friend), who was on his way to New Delhi t=
o pitch his services to the government. Perhaps Rogich could soothe the loc=
als, who had been loudly accusing Enron of price gouging.=20
Ever since there have been Commerce secretaries (nearly a century), they've=
 made such phone calls: strands in a global web of American dealmaking. But=
 what makes this one noteworthy -- and worthy of suspicion to Bush's enemie=
s -- is the date on which it took place, Oct. 15, for Lay knew that his wor=
ld was about to fall apart. In a conference call with Wall Street analysts =
the next day, he would have to disclose that Enron had lost an astounding $=
618 million in the third quarter. More important, it would soon become clea=
r that Enron had lost $1.2 billion in a labyrinth of partnerships that prob=
ably should have been -- but weren't -- counted on the company's books. Enr=
on, one of the most innovative and admired companies in the world, was near=
 collapse. Didn't Lay and Evans, an old friend in the Texas energy bidness,=
 discuss the impending crisis? They both say no. But investigators -- at le=
ast on Capitol Hill -- will want to ask, preferably in a hearing on TV.=20
As Enron's beleaguered employees and investors know all too well, the compa=
ny imploded last Dec. 2, producing the largest bankruptcy in American histo=
ry. But now the shock waves have moved from Houston and Wall Street to Wash=
ington, rattling a White House that had been focused on the popular enterpr=
ise of fighting the war on terrorism. The Lay-Evans call, it turns out, was=
 the prelude to a flurry of others (all initiated by Lay) in which the Enro=
n chief executive emitted increasingly urgent distress signals -- and barel=
y disguised pleas for help -- to Evans, Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and=
 Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan.=20
Despite his munificence as a contributor -- perhaps, ironically, because of=
 it -- Lay apparently got no help. White House officials insist that he nev=
er contacted them, and they never contacted him, though he was running (int=
o the ground) the seventh largest corporation in the country and the second=
 largest (after Exxon-Mobil) in Texas. They flatly deny that Bush or Vice P=
resident Dick Cheney (or any aides) had had direct knowledge of Enron's pre=
dicament. No evidence surfaced last week to contradict their story and, as =
they say in the law, the thing speaks for itself: Enron did collapse. Bushi=
es pointed out with relief that someone else had called O'Neill on Enron's =
behalf: Robert Rubin, respected Treasury chief under Bill Clinton and now a=
 leader of Citigroup, one of Enron's largest creditors. Lay, who, with Enro=
n, gave $500,000 to Bush in 2000, had become a mere acquaintance. At a pres=
s "avail," Bush referred to him stiffly as "Mr. Lay." Over at Commerce, a t=
op aide laughingly called him "Ken Who?"=20
Still, the collapse of Enron was no laughing matter. In Houston there was g=
rowing and justifiable outrage. Earlier in 2001, Enron's brass had feverish=
ly unloaded company stock. But at the very time Lay was sounding his alarms=
, the rank and file were barred from touching their modest, but Enron-heavy=
, 401(k) portfolios. Inside the Beltway, the scandal-making machinery -- id=
led since stripping a gear on the Gary Condit saga last year -- sputtered t=
o life. Though Lay and Enron had papered Congress with donations to Republi=
cans and Democrats alike, six committees were planning to investigate. (The=
 first hearing, later this month, will be led in the Senate by presidential=
 hopeful Joe Lieberman, who got a paltry $2,000.)=20
The Democrats were aware of the risks. Bush remains genuinely popular. Lay =
built his business by getting regulatory relief from Congress -- from Repub=
licans, to be sure, but from the Democrats as well. There were silent partn=
ers in the myriad Enron off-the-books secret partnerships. They might inclu=
de, inconveniently, a fair number of the Democrats' top donors. The public,=
 the handlers know, is likely to be disgusted by another partisan auto-da-f=
e.=20
Even so, the Dems couldn't resist plunging in. Average workers had been scr=
ewed. Wasn't there something the administration should have done to prevent=
 it? The Enron issue seemed aimed straight at the GOP's -- and Bush's -- ch=
ief vulnerability: their profile as the party of Texas-based Big Energy and=
 the moneyed class in general. And, arithmetic favored the Democrats: Enron=
/Lay had given nearly three quarters of its largesse to Republicans over th=
e years. "We don't have to say much," said one top Democratic strategist. "=
This story will carry itself for quite a while."=20
At the White House, aides projected an attitude of studied calm. Bush's fir=
st mention of the Enron inferno was after Nov. 30, according to counselor K=
aren Hughes, when he allowed that the seeming callousness toward company em=
ployees "really stinks." Aides claimed that neither Bush nor Cheney knew of=
 Lay's distress calls until Evans and O'Neill mentioned them to the preside=
nt last Thursday morning. "I know you think it strains credulity, but it's =
the truth," said White House aide Mary Matalin. "Every tentacle of this lea=
ds away from the White House."=20
That will be for investigators -- not spin doctors -- to decide. Numerous o=
fficials in and around the White House have or had extensive financial ties=
 to Lay and Enron. They include political adviser Karl Rove, economic advis=
er Larry Lindsey and GOP Chairman Marc Racicot, who last week declared that=
 he would stop all lobbying work. Investigators will have numerous contacts=
 to examine. Lay called Evans last Oct. 29 and discussed the impending drop=
 in Enron's credit rating with him. Lay talked with O'Neill twice, and Enro=
n's president, Greg Whalley, had several chats with Under Secretary Peter R=
. Fisher. Enron's attorney, Robert Bennett, told Newsweek his client was me=
rely "doing the responsible thing" by informing officials of "the possibili=
ty of bankruptcy" at Enron.=20
As Bennett knows (he represented Bill Clinton), a Washington scandal is hal=
f circus, half court of law. The powerful presence in the latter is the Jus=
tice Department where, as usual, there were Enron ties to untangle. Last we=
ek the department made the rare decision to run its probe from Washington h=
eadquarters. Why? Because the U.S. Attorney's Office in Houston had too man=
y personal ties to Enron employees. Attorney General John Ashcroft had to r=
ecuse himself, having taken $58,000 in Enron-related cash for his own faile=
d 2000 presidential campaign. That left the probe to Deputy A.G. Larry Thom=
pson, formerly a partner in an Atlanta law firm that has done extensive wor=
k for -- you guessed it -- Enron. (Since he didn't personally represent the=
 company, officials said, he didn't need to bow out.)=20
The pivotal question is not likely to be about administration actions in th=
e first instance, but its candor about them now. Bush's aides say they have=
 nothing to hide. But they and their boss strained nevertheless to distance=
 themselves from Lay. Just last spring he met privately with Cheney to disc=
uss energy policy and influenced nominations to the Federal Energy Regulato=
ry Commission.=20
Now, in the White House telling, he was some guy they hardly knew until 199=
5. In the Texas gubernatorial race of 1994, the president told the press, L=
ay "was a supporter" of his Democratic foe, Ann Richards. True, but only in=
 the Clintonian sense. In fact, Lay supported Bush the First in 1988 and 19=
92, organized the GOP Houston convention for him and raised money for the B=
ush library. Lay gave money to Richards in 1994, but he and Enron gave much=
 more to Bush: $146,000. Much of that money came in after Election Day, a B=
ush ally recalled contemptuously. So "Ken Who" was never really a friend of=
 George's -- and certainly isn't considered one now.=20
With Tamara Lipper in Washington=20
It's the scariest type of scandal: a total system failure. Executives, lend=
ers, auditors and regulators all managed to look the other way while the co=
mpany ran amok.=20
Who Killed Enron=20

Enron was supposed to be the next new thing, a New Economy company with sub=
stance to it. Unlike flaky Internet start-ups that substituted ethereal yar=
dsticks like "eyeballs" and "stickiness" for revenues and profits, Enron ha=
d real businesses, real assets, real revenues and what seemed to be real pr=
ofits. It owned natural-gas pipelines and electricity-generating plants and=
 water companies. Not only would it do well, it would improve the planet by=
 substituting the efficient hand of the market for the clumsy hand of gover=
nment regulation.=20
And it seemed to work. From humble beginnings as a natural-gas company, Enr=
on rose in a mere 15 years to No. 7 on the Fortune 500, doing $100 billion =
of business in 2000. Along the way, Enron became one of America's most admi=
red companies, and a perennial favorite on "best places to work" lists. The=
 guys running the show were hailed as magicians with newfound secrets that =
would change the future of business.=20
But Enron turned out to be another bubble. Unlike a Pets.com or a Webvan, w=
hose implosions did little damage outside of costing dice-rolling speculato=
rs some money and techies some jobs, the Enron bubble exploded like a grena=
de. Today Enron is a smoking ruin, the biggest corporate bankruptcy in Amer=
ican history. A year ago the stock market valued Enron at more than $60 bil=
lion. Its stock has since lost 99 percent of its value -- and still seems o=
verpriced. Stockholders and lenders are out tens of billions of dollars. Ma=
ny of Enron's 20,000 employees lost their retirement savings when the compa=
ny collapsed. About 5,000 of them, from computer jocks in Houston to newspr=
int recyclers in New Jersey, lost their jobs, too. By contrast, chairman Ke=
n Lay made $205 million in stock-option profits in the past four years alon=
e, and other big hitters and board members made out, too. What's especially=
 galling is that a handful of executives and outsiders made millions by inv=
esting in off-balance-sheet deals with Enron that played a large role in de=
stroying the company.=20
The collateral damage keeps spreading. Prominent among the wounded is Arthu=
r Andersen, Enron's outside auditor, which admitted last week that some emp=
loyees destroyed documents. Andersen's reputation has been tarnished to the=
 point that the Big Five accounting firms might shrink to the Big Four. Wal=
l Street's credibility has been shattered. Utilities deregulation, for whic=
h Enron was the poster boy, is now on the back burner. The spectacle of imp=
overished, unemployed Enronites has thrown a harsh spotlight on the risks o=
f 401(k) accounts stuffed with company stock. Confidence in financial marke=
ts has been shaken -- and rightly so. With the action in Afghanistan slowin=
g down, Enron shock waves have finally reached Washington, raising the spec=
ter of another 'Gate. L'affaire Enron is becoming a classic Washington scan=
dal: criminal probes, investigations of destroyed documents, pols being ask=
ed what they knew about Enron and when they knew it. There's no sex, alas -=
- but there sure is lots of money.=20
Life would be simple if we could blame the whole thing on Enron chairman La=
y. Or on George W. Bush, who goes way back with Lay, among the biggest indi=
vidual contributors to Bush's presidential and Texas gubernatorial campaign=
s. But Enron isn't that simple. It's something far more scary: a wholesale =
systemic failure. The multilayered system of checks and balances that is su=
pposed to keep a company from running amok completely broke down. Executive=
s of public companies have legal and moral responsibilities to produce hone=
st books and records -- but at Enron, they didn't do that. Outside auditors=
 are supposed to make sure that a company's financial reports not only meet=
 the letter of accounting rules but also give investors and lenders a fair =
and accurate picture of what's going on -- but Arthur Andersen failed that =
test. To protect themselves, lenders are supposed to make sure borrowers ar=
e creditworthy -- but Enron's lenders were as clueless as everyone else. Wa=
ll Street analysts are supposed to dig through company numbers to divine wh=
at's really happening -- but almost none of them managed to do that. Regula=
tors didn't regulate. Enron's board of directors didn't direct.=20
Why did all these people look the other way for so long? Money talks. Or, w=
ith Enron, shouts. The company put lots of money in pockets of the people a=
nd institutions that were supposed to police it. Enron's incessant dealmaki=
ng generated huge fees for Wall Street investment banking houses. And guess=
 what? Wall Street loved Enron, with most analysts rating its stock and bon=
ds as the greatest thing since money was invented, at least until they fina=
lly heard Enron's death rattle. Even when it became clear last fall that En=
ron was engaging in creative bookkeeping, almost no analysts recommended se=
lling the stock, says Chuck Hill, who tracks analyst recommendations for Fi=
rst Call/Thompson Financial. "They should have thrown in the towel a lot ea=
rlier," he said. Enron paid huge fees -- $52 million in 2000 -- to Arthur A=
ndersen for auditing and consulting services. Andersen allowed it to get aw=
ay with accounting that was, at best, aggressive and, at worst, criminal. I=
f Andersen had stood on principle, Enron would doubtless have changed accou=
ntants. Enron famously made heavy political contributions. Pols got peanuts=
 compared with what Wall Street and Andersen got, but it was enough to help=
 Enron run roughshod over regulators at the national and state levels.=20
With so many dollar signs floating around and the company's stock soaring, =
no one was interested in bad news -- a problem that's hardly limited to Enr=
on. "A lot of people don't want to hear the straight truth," says Thomas Do=
naldson, a business-ethics professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wh=
arton School. "Investors don't want the CEO to say something negative that =
will drop the stock, even for the short term. There's a culture of puffery,=
 a culture of winking." The winking stopped last year when regulators and t=
he financial markets finally reined in Enron -- at least five years after i=
ts big-time financial shenanigans had begun.=20
Enron started out innocently enough, born of a mildly innovative 1985 deal =
to combine two boring businesses: an Omaha-based natural-gas-pipeline compa=
ny called InterNorth and a Texas pipeline company called Houston Natural Ga=
s. Ken Lay, a soft-spoken statesman kind of guy with a Ph.D. in economics, =
found a hyperaggressive financial whiz named Jeff Skilling working in McKin=
sey & Co.'s energy practice in Houston. They had a brilliant insight. Inste=
ad of just delivering gas to customers at a modest profit, Enron could use =
newly deregulated pipelines to match buyers and sellers. In other words, En=
ron became a gas trader, as well as a gas company. Because trading was much=
 more fun and much more lucrative than building pipes and drilling wells an=
d selling gas at regulated, low-profit prices, Enron morphed into a trading=
 company with a utility attached to it.=20
And make no mistake, these guys were deregulation's True Believers. At a di=
nner I had with Skilling in the late 1990s, he was like a religious zealot =
who couldn't stop repeating his favorite mantra as the solution to all the =
world's problems. There are rolling blackouts in the Midwest? Deregulate. S=
ome energy companies look like they're price gouging? Deregulate more. And =
if salad dressing had dripped onto my tie? ... You get the picture.=20
With Lay and Skilling in charge, Enron's revenues and profits climbed sharp=
ly. People from all over the country clamored to join Enron and its crusade=
. TV monitors in the Enron Building in downtown Houston displayed the stock=
 price. Employees could get pumped up by inspirational elevator messages on=
 the way to work. In the best dot-com tradition, employees were treated to =
subsidized Starbucks, an on-site gym and lavish company outings. Enron wasn=
't just a business, it was a lifestyle that rewarded foam-mouthed aggressio=
n. "There's nothing wrong with ambition, but there was simply a warped cult=
ure at the top," says John Allario, 38, who worked six years in Enron's bus=
iness-development department before losing his job in the collapse. "They w=
anted to climb to the top of the mountain and pound their chest and crush a=
nyone or anything that got in the way."=20
The most important measure of Enron's growth was its rising stock price. It=
 was the oil that made the Enron machine run smoothly. After faltering in 1=
997, Enron shares went on a run in late 1998, doubling, then doubling again=
. Enron stock options were making employees rich and helped the company att=
ract the best and brightest. Not wanting to miss out on a sure thing, Enron=
ites stuffed company shares into their 401(k) plans. The company required m=
ost employees to have a chunk of their 401(k)s in Enron stock -- but many e=
mployees had far more stock than Enron required, and far less in diversifie=
d investments, such as mutual funds.=20
But what made Enron successful -- innovation and daring -- got the company =
into trouble when it decided in its arrogance that it could "financialize" =
almost anything. Rather than sticking to natural gas and electricity, which=
 it understood, Enron in the mid- and late-'90s branched into whatever stru=
ck its fancy: water, coal, fiber-optic capacity, weather derivatives (whate=
ver those are) and newsprint. It bought and sold properties, and traded up =
a storm. But many of its businesses tied up lots of capital while earning v=
ery little or running in the red. In the late 1990s, by my count, Enron los=
t about $2 billion on telecom capacity, $2 billion in water investments, $2=
 billion in a Brazilian utility and $1 billion on a controversial electrici=
ty plant in India. Enron's debt was soaring. If these harsh truths became o=
bvious to outsiders, Enron's stock price would get clobbered -- and a risin=
g stock price was the company's be-all and end-all. Worse, what few people =
knew was that Enron had engaged in billions of dollars of off-balance-sheet=
 deals that would come back to haunt the company if its stock price fell.=
=20
And it was in those too-clever-by-half financial structures that Enron sowe=
d the seeds of its undoing. Before we proceed to the story of Enron's final=
 days, let's get out our trusty lightsabers and take an accounting trip, on=
e made more lively by some Enron financial techie's fondness for "Star Wars=
."=20
Our case involves something called JEDI, as in Jedi knight. JEDI stands for=
 Joint Energy Development Investments, which was an investment partnership =
between Enron and the California Public Employees Retirement System, known =
as Calpers. Enron and Calpers invested $250 million each into the partnersh=
ip in 1993. JEDI prospered -- the Force must have been with it -- as Enron =
deftly bought and sold energy stocks, power plants and other investments, e=
arning a 23 percent annual return for Calpers. Very nice. So Calpers welcom=
ed Enron's offer in late 1997 to do a sequel. They ramped up JEDI II, with =
each side putting up $500 million. But first, Calpers wanted to cash in its=
 JEDI I stake, worth $383 million. Enron obliged. Instead of liquidating th=
e partnership, Enron went looking for someone to ante up $383 million to ta=
ke Calpers's place. That would keep JEDI I off Enron's balance sheet and it=
s profit-and-loss statement. Making JEDI I part of Enron would have cut the=
 company's reported profits sharply, and increased its reported debt by mor=
e than $500 million.=20
To solve this problem, Enron ginned up Chewco Investments - as in Chewbacca=
 the Wookiee. Chewco was a partnership of Enron executives and some undiscl=
osed outsiders. Chewco didn't have $383 million sitting around. So Enron le=
nt it $132 million and guaranteed a $240 million loan. This left about $11.=
5 million for Chewco to come up with. Not a whole lot, given the size of th=
e deal. But $11.5 million was an important number. Why? Because it was more=
 than 3 percent of Chewco's capital. And what's magical about that number? =
Clearly you're not an accountant. If outsiders put up at least 3 percent of=
 the capital, accountants are allowed to keep the deal off the parent compa=
ny's books. But Enron couldn't even get this right. It turns out that Enron=
 had provided collateral for about half of Chewco's $11.5 million investmen=
t. This meant Chewco had only about 1.5 percent at risk, not 3 percent. So =
JEDI and Chewco should have been treated as part of Enron by Arthur Anderse=
n from late 1997 on. But they weren't. In congressional testimony last mont=
h, Andersen chief executive Joseph Berardino admitted the accounting was wr=
ong, but said it wasn't Andersen's fault because no one told his firm about=
 the collateral Enron had provided. What Berardino didn't say then (and he =
wouldn't talk to us) is that even if Chewco had met the 3 percent rule, the=
 result would still be outrageously misleading. Keeping JEDI and Chewco off=
 the books inflated Enron's 1997 profits by 75 percent. And the move inflat=
ed profits for three more years, for a total of $396 million. Did keeping J=
EDI and Chewco off Enron's books when their impact was so great "present fa=
irly" Enron's financial situation, as Andersen certified? Not to me. But I'=
m only an English major.=20
Now, to the death spiral. Enron had started 2001 in great shape. Its stock =
was $83, close to its previous high of $90. CEO Jeff Skilling said in Janua=
ry that the stock was really worth $126. But rather than heading north, Enr=
on stock started falling as the year wore on. The continuous decline in Int=
ernet and telecom issues helped drag it down, as did falling natural-gas pr=
ices. What some Enron insiders knew -- but outsiders didn't -- is that the =
falling stock price was going to cause trouble, big time. That's because En=
ron was going to have to fork over lots of money, or give ruinous amounts o=
f stock, to institutions that had lent billions to Enron's off-balance-shee=
t entities. The commitment to provide that stock made the off-balance-sheet=
 entities creditworthy, because it reassured lenders about getting their mo=
ney back.=20
Skilling quit unexpectedly in August, triggering speculation that something=
 was amiss (he said he wanted to spend more time with his family). Skilling=
 wouldn't talk to Newsweek, but his spokesman said that Skilling "left beli=
eving the company was in very good shape." Asked if Skilling felt any respo=
nsibility for Enron's failure, his spokesman said he believes that "what ha=
ppened to Enron is a tragedy. He does not understand the reasons for it."=
=20
The reasons, actually, are sort of obvious. The end began on Oct. 16, when =
Enron held a conference call to discuss its third-quarter profits. Or, more=
 accurately, losses. Buried in its release was the fact that Enron's net wo=
rth had mysteriously shrunk by $1.2 billion. That was because of a complex =
off-balance-sheet deal involving four partnerships called Raptor, but Enron=
 didn't explain that.=20
For the first time, Enron found itself fielding lots of hostile questions f=
rom its formerly docile constituency on Wall Street. Meanwhile, The Wall St=
reet Journal had been picking away at the Enron facade, revealing, among ot=
her things, that Enron's chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, had made m=
ore than $30 million in fees for running some of the supposedly independent=
 partnerships. That, plus the losses and the vanished $1.2 billion of net w=
orth, started a Wall Street uproar. This went virtually unnoticed in Washin=
gton, where all eyes were on Afghanistan. But a few days later the Securiti=
es and Exchange Commission informed Enron that it had begun an informal inv=
estigation. Enron did what comes naturally to any large company in trouble =
-- it ran for a lawyer: University of Texas Law School Dean William Powers =
Jr. It put Powers on its board and named him to chair a special board commi=
ttee to deal with the SEC, and to investigate. Powers hired William McLucas=
, a former head of the SEC's enforcement division and a partner at the Wash=
ington law firm of Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering. McLucas assembled a legal ta=
sk force and hired accountants from Deloitte & Touche to dig into the books=
.=20
Guess what? Inside a month, McLucas & Co. found unpleasant truths that Enro=
n's board (and presumably Andersen) had ignored or overlooked for years. Th=
en again, McLucas didn't have a vested interest in ignoring them. McLucas's=
 conclusion: Enron's profits had been grossly overstated and its debts unde=
rstated for five years.=20
On Nov. 8, Enron issued a report, clearly crafted by McLucas, saying that i=
ts numbers dating back to 1997 could no longer be relied on. About 10 days =
later, it issued its third-quarter report, containing additional damaging i=
nformation. The end was nearing. As a trading company, Enron needed huge am=
ounts of credit to carry inventory (and, as we've seen, to cover losses) an=
d also needed the confidence of trading partners. With Enron's numbers hink=
y, its credit failing, a cash crisis clearly on the horizon, Enron's belove=
d free market did it in. Creditors fled, trading partners fled, money gushe=
d out the door. After an aborted attempt to sell out to crosstown rival Dyn=
egy Inc., which walked away from the deal at the last moment, Enron was out=
 of cash, out of credit, out of luck and out of time. It filed for bankrupt=
cy on Dec. 2. And it may well never emerge from it. Its energy-trading busi=
ness is still very valuable, but the bankruptcy is looking messy, even by b=
ankruptcy standards.=20
Former Enron employees can't stop shaking their heads over the sorry saga. =
"There was a time not so long ago when we all thought Ken Lay was just the =
most wonderful person in the world," says Shane Yelverton, who had worked a=
s a senior administrative assistant in Enron's engineering department. "But=
 now we're hearing all this stuff: that he was selling off stock, even whil=
e he was telling us not to sell our stock. It's disgusting."=20
Charles Prestwood is more than disgusted. A pipeline operator who had been =
with Enron since day one, he retired in October 2000 with $1.3 million of E=
nron stock in his 401(k). Now, he's watching pennies. "All those dreams are=
 gone now," he says. "I've lost everything I had. I'm just barely surviving=
."=20
Remember John Allario, the former Enron employee who so elegantly described=
 the corporate culture in Enron's heyday? He's getting a measure of revenge=
. Invoking his former CEO's last name, he started a Web site, laydoff.com, =
that peddles I GOT LAY'D BY ENRON T shirts. "We've sold about 450 so far," =
Allario said last week. "It's my way of showing the company that its former=
 employees whom they left in the lurch are still creative, and that we have=
 something to offer."=20
The Enron fallout promises to be severe and far-reaching. With a criminal i=
nvestigation underway, some of the Enron players face the prospect of spend=
ing time in the big house. The only question about Arthur Andersen is how m=
uch the partners will have to pay to settle this mess, and whether the comp=
any can survive as an independent entity. The accounting profession is wish=
ing it were once again faceless and colorless, instead of being in the hars=
h spotlight. Financial conglomerates like JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup are=
 going to be scrutinized over their multiple and often conflicting roles at=
 Enron: lenders, trading partners, investors, advisers, investment bankers.=
=20
Small investors, understandably, are frightened when a giant, well-regarded=
 company collapses overnight. The obvious lesson: don't keep too many eggs =
in one investment basket, especially in the company you work for. Utilities=
 deregulation has suffered a severe blow: if a huge company like Enron can =
disappear overnight, how can you trust new market players to provide you wi=
th essentials like electricity, gas and water? And maybe it's time to chang=
e the name of the Houston Astros' home park, Enron Field, to House of Cards=
.=20
The bottom line: Enron wanted to change the world. It did. But not quite th=
e way that it had in mind.=20

THE NATION Enron Chief Misled Employees, Waxman Says Inquiry: Kenneth Lay's=
 e-mails painted a bright future for the firm, even as its stock was falter=
ing.

WASHINGTON -- Key congressional investigators charged Saturday that Enron C=
orp. Chairman Kenneth L. Lay misled his 21,000 employees late last summer w=
hen he gave them a rosy picture of the company's financial health, even as =
the giant energy conglomerate was sliding toward financial ruin.=20
Rep. Henry A. Waxman of Los Angeles, the ranking Democrat on the House Comm=
ittee on Government Reform, released copies of e-mails sent by Lay to emplo=
yees in August that suggested all was well with the company and that its st=
ock would rebound.
But Waxman said Lay must have known then that Enron was falling into deep f=
inancial trouble.=20
The e-mails were sent as Enron shares tumbled in the wake of Jeffrey Skilli=
ng's abrupt Aug. 14 resignation as company president.=20
"It appears that you misled your employees into believing that Enron was pr=
ospering and that its stock price would rise," Waxman said in a letter to L=
ay, asking him to respond by Friday.=20
Repeated calls seeking comment from officials at Enron's headquarters in Ho=
uston went unanswered Saturday. But Enron spokesman Mark Palmer told Associ=
ated Press that the company was on solid footing when Lay sent the e-mails =
and that its financial problems did not become clear until later.=20
"Ken Lay was telling the truth," Palmer said. "We had had 21 consecutive qu=
arters of earnings growth, the same number of consecutive quarters of volum=
e growth. Our core business at Enron had never been in better shape."=20
In an Aug. 14 e-mail, Lay told employees "that I have never felt better abo=
ut the prospects for the company."=20
Two weeks later, on Aug. 27, an e-mail advised employees that his work to s=
hore up investor confidence in the company likely would "result in a signif=
icantly higher stock price."=20
In other developments Saturday, two Republican House leaders, Reps. W.J. "B=
illy" Tauzin of Louisiana and James C. Greenwood of Pennsylvania, called on=
 Enron accounting firm Andersen to turn over additional records to congress=
ional investigators.=20
Late last week, the Chicago-based company disclosed that from September to =
November it had destroyed thousands of documents involving Enron Corp.=20
Tauzin and Greenwood asserted in a letter to Andersen that the documents we=
re "knowingly destroyed" and said they did not want to risk the loss of any=
 other paperwork. They gave the company until Monday to produce some docume=
nts and until Friday for others.=20
Andersen spokesman Patrick Dorton said, "We are committed to being forthrig=
ht and doing the right thing in this matter."=20
Also, the Center for Public Integrity, a Washington-based watchdog group th=
at studies political fund-raising, said a review of federal disclosure form=
s shows that 14 of the Bush administration's top 100 officials owned Enron =
stock. Based on the disclosure forms, in which officials provide an estimat=
ed range of their assets' values, the Enron holdings by the administration =
officials were worth between $284,000 and $886,000.=20
Bush Officials Were Shareholders=20
Senior officials who owned stock included Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsf=
eld; Karl Rove, President Bush's chief political advisor; and Peter Fisher,=
 an assistant Treasury secretary. It was disclosed Friday that a top Enron =
executive called Fisher several times in the fall asking him to help the co=
mpany secure a bank loan. White House officials say Fisher did not interven=
e in the matter.=20
Lay has been a friend of Bush, and he and other Enron executives have contr=
ibuted about $550,000 to the president's political endeavors.=20
But Enron officials have been generous to Democrats as well, contributing t=
o Al Gore, Bush's opponent in the 2000 presidential campaign, and to more t=
han half the 50 Democrats in the Senate.=20
Enron officials have acknowledged that, during the latter part of last year=
, they were desperately trying to save the company from the bankruptcy fili=
ng that occurred in December. As a result of the company's collapse, thousa=
nds of families who owned Enron stock lost money.=20
Last week, new details emerged about company executives, including Lay, see=
king help from Bush administration officials to stave off the company's dem=
ise. Those contacted included Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and Commer=
ce Secretary Don Evans; both have said they took no action to help Enron.=
=20
The e-mails offer a glimpse into the inside world of Enron at a time when i=
ts financial problems were growing but before company executives turned to =
O'Neill and Evans for help.=20
Though he cited personal reasons for leaving the company, Skilling's depart=
ure Aug. 14 triggered a battering of Enron stock.=20
"I want to assure you that I have never felt better about the prospects for=
 the company," Lay's e-mail read that day.=20
"All of you know that our stock price has suffered substantially over the l=
ast few months. One of my top priorities will be to restore a significant a=
mount of the stock value we have lost as soon as possible."=20
He added that "our performance has never been stronger; our business model =
has never been more robust; our growth has never been more certain.=20
"We have the finest organization in American business today."=20
On Aug. 27, Lay sent another e-mail to employees, who received a grant of s=
tock options, and told them that "one of my highest priorities is to restor=
e investor confidence in Enron."=20
He added that his efforts "should result in a significantly higher stock pr=
ice."=20
Waxman, in his letter to Lay about the e-mails, noted that, by the time of =
the second computer message, the stock price was at $37 a share, down from =
a high the previous August of $90.56.=20
"You had already sold $40 million of Enron stock during 2001 and over $100 =
million since October 1998," Waxman told Lay.=20
Enron stock hit a low of 26 cents a share Nov. 30.=20
As Stock Fell, So Did Severance=20
Waxman further noted that, while the company stock was plummeting, Lay soug=
ht a $60-million severance package for himself. When employees objected, Wa=
xman said, "you proposed reducing your package to $40 million."=20
And when Enron employees again objected, Lay decided in mid-November not to=
 accept the severance package compensation.=20
Waxman said he was bothered that Lay told his employees everything was fine=
, but less than two months later he was telling Bush officials in Washingto=
n that the company urgently needed help to prevent a bankruptcy filing.=20
"At a minimum," Waxman said, the statements by Lay "create the appearance t=
hat you misled Enron employees about the value of their investments in Enro=
n and the security of their jobs.=20
"If this were accurate, it would be a gross betrayal of your employees' tru=
st, as well as possibly illegal conduct."

The World: School for Scandal
Trying To Pass Damage Control 101
By DON VAN NATTA Jr.

01/13/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON -- WILL they ever learn?=20
The rules in the damage-control playbook are deceptively simple: be the fir=
st to release the bad news (all at once, if possible). Do not misrepresent =
information. And the cover-up is always worse than the crime.
Yet, last week, Washington once again watched as a new administration seeme=
d to ignore the old rules when it scrambled to deal with what may be its fi=
rst full-blown political scandal -- its close ties to the Enron Corporation=
, one of the largest contributors to President Bush's 2000 presidential cam=
paign.=20
Almost every day, the White House disclosed new contacts between administra=
tion officials and executives at Enron, the once-powerful, now-bankrupt Hou=
ston energy trading conglomerate that first sought favorable regulatory pol=
icies from the Bush administration before literally pleading for its help t=
o survive. The White House is insisting it has done nothing for the company=
. But by the end of the week, some strategists said the White House's trick=
ling out of information helped the Enron story gather enough momentum that =
it pushed terrorism off the front page.=20
Perhaps it is the political survival instincts of a new administration. Or =
perhaps it is nothing more than a White House's stubborn refusal to give th=
e press what it wants. Whatever the reason, every new scandal seems to doom=
 a president to repeat his predecessors' mistakes.=20
''They are learning, very slowly, the way to do this, the fact that you hav=
e to get out in front of these stories, but they haven't learned entirely y=
et how to do it,'' said Lanny J. Davis, the Clinton administration spin doc=
tor who made an art form out of the Friday night damage-control leak to a w=
ire service reporter so news would hit the Saturday papers, thought to have=
 the least readership. ''Some things, you have to learn the hard way.''=20
Even the most experienced Washington hands said there might be nothing ille=
gal in the late fall conversations between Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman=
, and two cabinet officers. Mr. Lay sought help for Enron's dire financial =
condition from Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans.=20
''They were hesitant and not on top of things in the first hours of this cr=
isis,'' said David R. Gergen, a longtime political strategist who worked in=
 the Nixon, Ford, Reagan and Clinton administrations. ''This is an administ=
ration that is sometimes hesitant in the first moments of a crisis or chall=
enge, but it recovers very well. I think they made a strong effort to get m=
uch more out at the end of the week. The problem is, we just don't know if =
there is any more, if there are things being held back.''=20
There are many moments in the modern presidency when the temptation to hold=
 back the truth prevailed, but always to the everlasting regret of the Oval=
 Office occupants. No one did more holding back than Richard M. Nixon, and =
the Watergate cover-up sank his presidency.=20
In the first days of the Iran-contra scandal, Ronald Reagan appeared to be =
following the damage-control scenario by releasing what the administration =
said was virtually everything about the arms-for-hostages deal. Of course, =
many more details emerged later, and it was again the cover-up that proved =
far more politically toxic than the original allegation.=20
Bill Clinton insisted he ''did not have sexual relations with that woman.''=
 But his denial, maintained by his aides for eight months, dragged the coun=
try through a scandal that lasted more than a year before it ended with Mr.=
 Clinton's impeachment by the House and acquittal by the Senate.=20
How long the Enron inquiry will last, some strategists say, depends on what=
 else may be waiting out there about the company's relationship with the Wh=
ite House. ''I just worry that some other shoe is going to drop,'' said a R=
epublican strategist with ties to the White House.=20
The Enron inquiry is unlike the scandals that bedeviled the Clintons, inclu=
ding the Monica S. Lewinsky affair and the Whitewater land deal. Most of th=
e information related to those scandals was located in the White House -- e=
ven, literally, inside the Oval Office.=20
But Enron is a wide-ranging private sector debacle, being investigated by t=
he Justice Department, the Labor Department, the Securities and Exchange Co=
mmission and five separate Congressional committees. Documents have been de=
stroyed by employees of Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen.=20
''It's somewhat more complicated because the information sits in various pl=
aces, not all of which are under the control of the White House,'' said Suz=
anne R. Garment, author of ''Scandal: The Culture of Mistrust in American P=
olitics.'' ''The opportunities are multiplied for screw-ups.''=20
The allegations of influence-peddling are almost impossible to prove. The c=
ampaign finance quid pro quo is always elusive. The White House attempted t=
o chase away the allegations by arguing -- so far without being contradicte=
d -- that Enron got nothing for its many years of generosity. Other than a =
few meetings, the administration did not give it the energy policy it wante=
d, or the bail-out assistance requested as Enron hurtled toward bankruptcy =
last fall.=20
''What you have here is a case where a contributor called up and asked for =
something but did not get it,'' said Ari Fleischer, the White House press s=
ecretary. Moreover, no evidence has emerged that President Bush is in any w=
ay involved.=20
Mrs. Garment said the ''contributor calls could turn out to be nothing, but=
 they are precisely the kind of tendrils by which scandal classically creep=
s up the brick wall.''=20
FORMER Clinton administration officials watched with incredulity as their c=
ounterparts attempted to put out the Enron fire. ''Since Sept. 11, they hav=
e all performed well under ridiculous pressure,'' said Jennifer Palmieri, t=
he press secretary of the Democratic National Committee, ''but they have ne=
ver been through anything like this.'' Yet some Democrats might also be ent=
angled.=20
Some Republican administration officials were furious at some of the press =
coverage. ''They act like there's some billing records or some cattle scam =
or some fired travel aides or some blue dress,'' Mary Matalin, an aide to V=
ice President Dick Cheney, said, referring to many points she used when att=
acking the Clinton administration.=20
It took several days of disclosures from the Bush White House to jump start=
 the political scandal machine, hibernating since Sept. 11. Political resea=
rchers and Democratic operatives sent out blast-faxes of past favors done f=
or the Bush family by Mr. Lay and Enron. And reporters began asking: what d=
id the president know, and when did he know it?=20
''Even if no more damaging information comes out,'' Ms. Palmieri said, ''th=
is is a major problem for this administration. It is going to damage the pr=
esident's credibility and it is going to hurt their ability to get their me=
ssage out.''=20
Mr. Gergen said, ''Washington journalists believe there is blood in the wat=
er,'' but he said most of the public views Enron as a failed corporation wh=
ose employees watched helplessly as their retirement savings evaporated. Th=
e blame does not touch the White House.=20
To ensure the budding scandal does not ''have legs,'' Mrs. Garment said the=
 White House should immediately investigate whether anyone else in the admi=
nistration had any contact with Enron. ''I assume the White House is making=
 a complete sweep of the upper levels of government for any information on =
contacts between members of the administration and Enron,'' she said. ''And=
 if they find anything that they think is relevant, they should say what it=
 is immediately. Surely, they have learned from the past. Right?''

Bush, Enron chief rose out of the same circles of achievement
By DEB RIECHMANN
Associated Press Writer

01/12/2002
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

WASHINGTON (AP) - President Bush bestowed the nickname "Kenny Boy" on embat=
tled Enron executive Kenneth Lay back when the two were up-and-comers in Te=
xas.=20
That doesn't mean they are best buddies; Bush dispenses nicknames freely an=
d not just on intimates. Yet as their careers soared, their interests becam=
e more intertwined, whether in business, politics or baseball.
Bush's largest financial benefactor, Lay found him to be a friend of the en=
ergy industry when Bush was Texas governor. And Bush made a special trip to=
 Houston during his presidential campaign to attend the Astros' first game =
at Enron Field, as Lay threw out the first pitch.=20
They've enjoyed "quality time," Lay has said.=20
How close their friendship grew has come under scrutiny since Enron, the Ho=
uston-based energy giant, filed the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history last=
 month.=20
It has since been disclosed that Lay contacted officials in the Bush admini=
stration, which has at least 15 high-ranking members who owned stock in the=
 company last year. Several Cabinet members acknowledged contacts from Enro=
n but said they did not tell Bush or take any action.=20
The president calls Lay a "supporter," in recognition of the money poured i=
nto his campaigns over the years by Lay, his company and its employees.=20
But he denies speaking with Lay about the company's financial problems and =
says his administration will aggressively investigate the failure of the co=
mpany. Enron's fall cost thousands of jobs and vaporized the retirement sav=
ings of many employees.=20
"My sense is that Bush cares about him," said Bill Miller, a political cons=
ultant in Austin, Texas, who witnessed Lay's ascent in the corporate world =
and Bush's rise to governor, then president.=20
"It was a friendship-friendship, not just a business friendship."=20
White House and Enron officials insist the two were never all that close. A=
ny idea that Lay is a "close intimate" of Bush is ludicrous, said Bush advi=
ser Karl Rove=20
"It would be a stretch to call them personal friends," said Enron spokesman=
 Mark Palmer, adding he recalled hearing Lay say that Bush had called him "=
Kenny Boy" once or twice.=20
Parsing his words carefully, Bush said last week that it was when he became=
 governor after the 1994 election that "I first got to know Ken." But their=
 relationship apparently goes farther back.=20
Lay, as chairman of the University of Houston board of regents in the late =
1980s, tried to bring the senior Bush's presidential library to his school.=
 George W. Bush was involved in setting up the library, which eventually we=
nt to College Station, Texas, instead.=20
Lay says he spent "a little more quality time with George W." during that t=
ime.=20
Criminal, civil and congressional investigations are looming into whether E=
nron defrauded investors, including 401(k) plan investors, by concealing in=
formation about its financial problems.=20
Bush, sitting on high approval ratings, is hoping his connections to Lay wo=
n't become a political liability.=20
Bush has received more than $550,000 from Enron, its employees and their re=
latives during his political career - the most from any source. Altogether,=
 more than 250 members of Congress from both parties have received Enron co=
ntributions.=20
Lay's relationship with the Bush family dates back to when the president's =
father was the only Bush in national politics.=20
Lay was co-chairman of former President Bush's 1990 economic summit for ind=
ustrialized nations, which was held in Houston.=20
Lay and his wife, Linda, dined on hickory grilled veal medallions and Texas=
 peaches and cream with summit attendees who included British Prime Ministe=
r Margaret Thatcher and French President Francois Mitterrand.=20
Lay also was co-chairman of the host committee for the Republican National =
Convention when it was held in Houston in 1992. George W. Bush played an ac=
tive role in his father's unsuccessful campaign for a second term that year=
.=20
The businessman had Democratic connections as well, serving Democratic Gov.=
 Ann Richards as leader of her business council. He gave money to her campa=
ign and Bush's in 1994, and when Bush defeated her that year, the new gover=
nor kept Lay on the business council.=20
As Lay was donating money to Bush's 1994 and 1998 governor's campaigns, he =
also was lobbying legislators to deregulate the electric industry, an area =
into which Enron was expanding.=20
Bush signed a deregulation law in 1999 clearing Enron's path into new marke=
ts.=20
"Bush has always delivered on Kenneth Lay's political pitches," said Craig =
McDonald, director of Texans for Public Justice, a campaign-finance advocac=
y group.=20
Even if Bush's dad hadn't been in the White House, the two men would have b=
een on similar trajectories.=20
"They're both from the energy business; they both like baseball," said W.J.=
 "Jack" Bowen, a retired gas executive who hired Lay twice, at a Florida en=
ergy company and then at Transco Energy Co. in Houston.=20
They have similar personal traits, said Miller, who has watched Texas polit=
ics for years. Both are bright and down-to-earth. Each tends to delegate au=
thority.=20
"Neither one of them pretends to be an intellectual," Miller said. "Lay is =
reserved, but not shy. Bush has got more ham bone in him."

ENRON'S COLLAPSE
Complex Web of Relationships in Boom and Bust
By JOHN SCHWARTZ

01/13/2002
The New York Times
Page 26, Column 2
c. 2002 New York Times Company

The cast of characters in the Enron drama is lengthy, and their relationshi=
ps are complex.=20
THE EXECUTIVES=20
Kenneth L. Lay gained national fame as the chairman and chief executive of =
Enron, a company that reshaped the nation's energy markets -- and notoriety=
 as the company flamed out spectacularly.
A man with a doctorate in economics and an evangelical belief in free marke=
ts, Mr. Lay turned an old-fashioned gas pipeline operator into the world's =
biggest energy trader. But when Enron faltered, he could not explain the co=
mpany's finances to the satisfaction of Wall Street or of Dynegy Inc., a ri=
val that offered to rescue Enron but ultimately walked away from a proposed=
 merger.=20
Mr. Lay's longtime No. 2, Jeffrey K. Skilling, fostered a culture at Enron =
described as creative and cutthroat. He led the company into new markets, s=
etting up trading desks for paper, chemicals, water rights and high-speed I=
nternet service.=20
Mr. Skilling was chief executive for six months, resigning last August. He =
said last month that he was stunned by the company's rapid decline.=20
Enron replaced its chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, in October, s=
eeking to placate investors and regulators who had begun questioning a set =
of unusual partnerships he arranged to shift debt off the company's books. =
Two weeks later, the company revised its accounting for the partnerships, w=
iping away about $600 million in profits it had reported over the previous =
five years. Mr. Fastow earned $30 million from his investments in the deals=
.=20
THE BOARD=20
Enron recruited prominent people to its board of directors, but given the c=
ompany's collapse, analysts give them low marks. The directors include Wend=
y L. Gramm, the former chairwoman of the Commodities Futures Trading Commis=
sion and the wife of Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas.=20
Ms. Gramm serves on the board's audit committee, which is responsible for t=
he company's accounting and financial reporting. Until 1998, she owned Enro=
n shares; when the Gramms decided that the stock presented conflict of inte=
rest issues, she sold her shares for $300,000. Since then, the company has =
placed her board pay in a ''deferred account'' that can be tapped later.=20
Also on the board is Dr. John Mendelsohn, president of the M. D. Anderson C=
ancer Center, one of Houston's most prestigious institutions. Enron has don=
ated more than $600,000 to the center in the last five years. Another audit=
 committee member, Lord John Wakeham, was in Margaret Thatcher's inner circ=
le when she was Britain's prime minister.=20
THE LAWYERS=20
No corporate crisis would be complete without celebrity lawyers, and the En=
ron debacle has enlisted some of the biggest. David Boies, who took on Micr=
osoft in the federal antitrust suit, is representing Mr. Fastow. Robert S. =
Bennett, who represented President Bill Clinton in the Paula Jones scandal,=
 is representing Enron in Washington.=20
THE POLITICIANS=20
Mr. Lay -- ''Kenny Boy'' to his friend George W. Bush -- is a major contrib=
utor to both political parties. Mr. Lay and other Enron executives have giv=
en more than $550,000 to Mr. Bush in his political career.=20
Enron's executives met with Vice President Dick Cheney four times last year=
 to discuss energy matters. When Mr. Cheney was chief executive of Hallibur=
ton, a unit of the company built Houston's new baseball stadium, Enron Fiel=
d. Before he became the president's top economic counselor, Lawrence B. Lin=
dsey was a paid adviser to Enron. Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's chief political str=
ategist, and I. Lewis Libby, Mr. Cheney's chief of staff, were investors in=
 the company.=20
The ties reach far beyond the White House. The Republican national chairman=
, Marc Racicot, the former governor of Montana, was a lobbyist for the comp=
any until last week. In Texas, Mr. Bush's successor, Rick Perry, has been c=
riticized for appointing a top Enron executive to the state's Public Utilit=
y Commission.=20
THE ACCOUNTANTS=20
Joseph F. Berardino, chief executive of the accounting firm Arthur Andersen=
, Enron's longtime auditor, is caught in the Enron net. In December, he tol=
d Congress that Enron might have illegally hidden information from its audi=
tors. Last week, Andersen disclosed that its employees had destroyed docume=
nts related to its auditing of Enron -- even after the government began inv=
estigating Enron's fall.=20
If the story seems to take on the breadth of a Cecil B. DeMille epic, that =
may only be appropriate. For there is a cast of thousands: the company's in=
vestors, including Enron employees who saw their retirement savings disappe=
ar virtually overnight. Their loss -- and their anger -- guarantee that the=
 investigations of Enron are only beginning.

ENRON'S COLLAPSE
Before Debacle, Enron Insiders Cashed In $1.1 Billion in Shares
By LESLIE WAYNE

01/13/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

While investigators are focusing on how much money investors and employees =
lost in the Enron Corporation's collapse, some shareholders and lawmakers a=
re now setting their sights on another target: the millions that Enron insi=
ders received by selling their shares while the price was still high.=20
As Enron stock climbed and Wall Street was still promoting it, a group of 2=
9 Enron executives and directors began to sell their shares. These insiders=
 received $1.1 billion by selling 17.3 million shares from 1999 through mid=
-2001, according to court filings based on public records. They continued s=
elling just before Enron's stock started to tumble early last year and the =
company began its slide into bankruptcy protection.
One of the biggest sellers was Kenneth L. Lay, who became prominent as the =
company's chairman and a leading contributor to President Bush. He was amon=
g more than a dozen Enron executives who received $30 million or more, incl=
uding one who sold shares valued at $353.7 million.=20
Lawyers and spokesmen for the executives, board members and the company sai=
d that the sales were proper, and that the insiders had no special informat=
ion or advantages over other investors.=20
''This issue is being investigated,'' said Robert S. Bennett, a lawyer for =
Enron. ''But at this point in time, I am unaware of any evidence that suppo=
rts the allegation there was improper selling by members of the board or se=
nior management.''=20
Many of these Enron executives retain large holdings in the company, sellin=
g shares regularly, as executives at other companies do. ''In many instance=
s, the sale of the stock was preplanned according to a strict timetable,'' =
Mr. Bennett said.=20
Mr. Lay himself sold Enron stock 350 times, trading almost daily, receiving=
 $101.3 million. In all, Mr. Lay sold 1.8 million Enron shares between earl=
y 1999 and July 2001, five months before Enron filed for bankruptcy. As of =
last February, he still owned more than 7.7 million shares.=20
Mr. Lay sold his stock for $31 to $86 a share; this week, Enron was selling=
 for under 70 cents a share. Often, Mr. Lay sold in amounts as small as 500=
 shares, while at other times he sold as many as 100,000 shares.=20
It has not been determined how much Mr. Lay or the others paid for their sh=
ares, or how much they gained. Much of Mr. Lay's holdings, and those of oth=
er executives, were in the form of stock options, which allowed them to buy=
 shares at a discount.=20
Other top sellers were Lou L. Pai, the former chairman of an Enron subsidia=
ry, who received $353.7 million for his 5 million shares; Rebecca P. Mark-J=
usbasche, a director and former Enron executive who received $79.5 million =
for 1.4 million shares; and Ken L. Harrison, a director who sold 1 million =
shares for $75.2 million.=20
Jeffrey K. Skilling, the company's former chief executive, received $66.9 m=
illion for 1.1 million shares. Beginning in December 2000, Mr. Skilling beg=
an to sell his holdings at a pace of 10,000 shares about every seven days. =
He still owns about 600,000 shares and options, according to public filings=
.=20
Andrew S. Fastow, the company's ousted chief financial officer, who set up =
many of the financial partnerships that have been criticized for concealing=
 Enron's large debts, received $30 million for his holdings.=20
A detailed accounting of these trades is contained in a lawsuit brought by =
Amalgamated Bank, of New York, which invested the pension money of union me=
mbers in Enron shares. Representing the bank in this case, which is now in =
the Federal District Court in Houston, is the same law firm that brought sh=
areholder suits against Charles H. Keating Jr. in the savings and loan scan=
dal and against Michael R. Milken, the junk bond financier, for securities =
fraud.=20
While the suit has received little attention so far, it highlights one of t=
he main points in the political debate now taking place in Washington -- wh=
ether small shareholders were left out of a flow of information about Enron=
's deteriorating financial condition.=20
The differences in the trading strategies of the two groups -- those outsid=
e the company who were buying Enron's shares and those inside the company w=
ho were selling them -- reflect the different information that each group h=
ad, according to the suit.=20
''The defendants employed devices, schemes and artifices to defraud,'' the =
lawsuit states. It accuses the 29 defendants of ''unlawful insider trading'=
' and says the group ''materially misled the investing public'' by issuing =
false statements.=20
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut and chairman of the Se=
nate government affairs committee, has already announced hearings that will=
, in part, look at how Enron shareholders might have been deceived by the c=
ompany's financial statements. Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of Californi=
a, has also expressed concern for Enron's small shareholders, especially em=
ployees who put its shares in their 401(k) retirement plans only to lose th=
eir savings.=20
Representative Henry A. Waxman of California, the ranking Democrat on the H=
ouse Commerce Committee, released a letter yesterday asking Mr. Lay to answ=
er questions about optimistic statements Mr. Waxman said that Mr. Lay had m=
ade in e-mail messages to employees last August. In the e-mail, gathered by=
 staff investigators, Mr. Lay said that Enron remained strong.=20
At Enron, more than half of the employees' 401(k) assets, or about $1.2 bil=
lion, was invested in company stock, which is now nearly worthless. Billion=
s more were lost by other investors, from individuals to large institutions=
 that bought Enron shares for the pension plans of unions and corporations.=
=20
The lawsuit claims the insiders withheld information, allowing Enron's shar=
es to remain at an artificially high level while they were selling their sh=
ares. ''This is the most massive insider bailout that we've ever seen and w=
e've been prosecuting these cases for 30 years,'' said William S. Lerach, o=
ne of the bank's lead attorneys. ''The overall size of this case is unprece=
dented.''=20
Spokesmen for some of the defendants say that this group had done nothing w=
rong. An Enron spokesman, Mark Palmer, dismissed the suit as ''completely w=
ithout merit'' and a ''weak argument.''=20
Gordon G. Andrew, a spokesman for Mr. Fastow, the former chief financial of=
ficer, declined to comment, but said that Mr. Fastow still had about 50 per=
cent of his original holdings. Mr. Andrew said that Mr. Fastow's last stock=
 sale took place in November 2000 and that Mr. Fastow had purchased shares =
in early 2001.=20
A spokeswoman for Mr. Skilling, the former chief executive, said that ''the=
re is absolutely no basis to the allegation that Mr. Skilling did anything =
improper with regard to the sale of Enron stock.'' The defendants have not =
yet filed answers to the complaint. Arthur Andersen & Company, also named, =
declined to comment.=20
At the top end of the selling was Mr. Pai, who headed an Enron subsidiary c=
alled NewPower Holdings, an online retailer of electricity and natural gas.=
 Before leaving Enron last spring, Mr. Pai sold five million shares of Enro=
n between January 1999 and July 2001 for $353.7 million.=20
In January 2000, just 60 days after the formation of NewPower, Mr. Pai rece=
ived more than two million Enron shares. He began to sell them almost immed=
iately, mostly while they were trading above $70.=20
Enron directors, also named in the case, sold stock too. All Enron director=
s receive stock options as part of their $380,619 annual fees. Of that, 15 =
percent was paid in cash, the remainder in stock.=20
One director, Wendy L. Gramm, the wife of Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of=
 Texas, sold all her 10,256 shares for $276,912. She sold the stock on one =
day -- Nov. 3, 1998 -- for $27 a share. Ms. Gramm said earlier that she and=
 her husband decided to sell their Enron shares to avoid the appearance of =
a conflict. She was then paid in cash.=20
The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department are both =
investigating Enron. A Senate committee issued 51 subpoenas Friday as part =
of an investigation into the insiders' stock sales.=20

Enron chairman and CEO Ken Lay spoke to Commerce Secretary Evans on October=

But Evans says he told the White House chief of staff a few weeks after the=
 call because Enron's troubles were making headlines.=20
EVANS: I thought the White House ought to know. I was over there one day, a=

USA: US senator - Enron accountant could face charges.

01/13/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

WASHINGTON, Jan 13 (Reuters) - If Arthur Andersen ordered workers to destro=
y audit material related to Enron Corp., the Big Five accounting firm could=
 face criminal indictment, a leading Democratic senator said on Sunday.=20
Sen. Joseph Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat, was referring to a report by=
 Time magazine that Arthur Andersen, Enron's auditor, ordered employees in =
an Oct. 12 memo to destroy all audit material on Enron Corp. except the mos=
t basic "work papers."
The magazine reported on Sunday that just four days before Enron disclosed =
a stunning $618 million loss for the third quarter - its first public discl=
osure of its financial woes - the workers who audited the company's books w=
ere ordered to destroy the records, and reminded to do so in the weeks lead=
ing up to the first Security and Exchange Commission subpoenas issued on No=
v. 8.=20
"We know that Arthur Andersen, the supposedly independent auditor, covered =
up facts very relevant to the condition of Enron," Lieberman told CBS's "Fa=
ce the Nation."=20
"It may well be" criminal, he said. "Arthur Andersen is a great company wit=
h a great name. That name is being sullied and ultimately this Enron episod=
e may end this company's history."=20
"From what I've seen of the Time magazine story, the memo about destroying =
the documents of Enron was not just a routine 'clear your files' memo. It w=
as specifically about Enron and it came at a time when people inside, inclu=
ding the executives of Arthur Andersen and Enron, knew that Enron was in re=
al trouble and that the roof was about to collapse on them," said Lieberman=
, chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee.=20
Lieberman's panel has begun an investigation.=20
"This kind of memo to destroy documents raises very serious questions about=
 whether obstruction of justice occurred here. That's not for me to make a =
judgment on now. Obviously I don't know enough about it," he added. "But yo=
u've got lawsuits being filed ... you've got criminal investigations going =
on.=20
"If this memo was what it looks like, I'm afraid that the folks at Arthur A=
ndersen could be on the other end of an indictment before this is over."=20
Arthur Andersen admitted last Thursday its employees had deleted documents =
related to its review of the bankrupt energy trader's finances, and congres=
sional sources said thousands were destroyed.=20
A spokesman told Time it would be inappropriate to discuss the situation un=
til the company completes its own review.=20
The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations also has issued 51 docu=
ment subpoenas to Andersen, Enron and 49 unnamed Enron executives, employee=
s and directors.=20
Sen. John McCain told CBS the accounting firm was receiving $50 million dol=
lars a year for "consulting" as well as $50 million for auditing.=20
"That's hard to understand how you can audit objectively while you are gett=
ing huge sums of money for consulting to an energy firm," McCain said.=20
Arthur Andersen did accounting for the global energy trading giant before i=
t declared bankruptcy on Dec. 2, wiping out the jobs and pensions savings o=
f thousands of workers and inflicting losses of millions of individual inve=
stors. In addition to the regulatory and congressional investigations, the =
Justice Department has opened a criminal probe.

Enron Gave $21,933 to Schumer / Donations largest to any Senate Democrat
Ellen Yan. WASHINGTON BUREAU

(Copyright Newsday Inc., 2002)

Washington - Sen. Charles Schumer, who sits on two committees planning hear=
ings on the Enron bankruptcy, received more donations than any other Senate=
 Democrat from the failed energy trading giant.=20
The $21,933 the senator received came during his 1998 race and was the four=
th largest in the Senate, even topping donations to some House lawmakers fr=
om Enron's home state of Texas, according to a study by the Center for Resp=
onsive Politics, which monitors campaign donations. The money came from com=
pany employees, including chairman Kenneth Lay, and its political action co=
mmittee.
Although Enron overwhelmingly favored Republicans, Schumer collected more f=
rom the company than any non-Texan, except for Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.),=
 who got $23,200 and sits on the powerful Appropriations Committee, which d=
oles out the nation's spending money. Enron's top recipient in Congress was=
 Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchinson (R-Texas), an appropriations member who got $99=
,500 from 1989 to November of last year.=20
Schumer is on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the Banking, H=
ousing and Urban Affairs Committee. Both panels expect to investigate how a=
nd why Enron imploded, sinking employees' pension funds, and to learn how m=
uch the Bush administration knew of the company's troubles before the publi=
c fall. Other committee members also received contributions from Enron.=20
Schumer received the donations during his battle with incumbent Alfonse D'A=
mato, one of the most watched and expensive races in the nation. In a posit=
ion favored by Enron, Schumer made power deregulation one of the keystone c=
ampaign issues upstate because the high energy prices there were damaging t=
he economy. Since he got into the Senate, there have not been many key ener=
gy votes.=20
Schumer spokesman Bradley Tusk said nothing untoward happened: "Did Enron g=
ive us contributions? Yes. Have they asked us to do anything? No."=20
Once Schumer arrived in the Senate, Tusk said, he led and won the fight aga=
inst the company's main priority in 1999 when it came to reauthorizing the =
Commodities Exchange Act. "The bill would have allowed electronic trading c=
ompanies like Enron to be exempt from federal oversight," Tusk said. "We th=
ought it would put consumers at risk."=20
The money may be explained by a common denominator between Enron and Schume=
r. One was a prolific giver, the other a prolific fund- raiser.=20
Schumer is "going to get a lot of money from a lot of donors . . . and his =
fund-raisers don't stop at the border" of New York, said Steven Weiss, a sp=
okesman for the Center for Responsive Politics.=20
The company's employees and PAC also contributed to several other New Yorke=
rs, according to campaign records. Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton got $950 dur=
ing her race, and former Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan $1,000 in 1992. In th=
e House from 1989 to 2001, Reps. Gary Ackerman (D-Jamaica Estates) and Char=
les Rangel (D-Manhattan) each got $3,500; Vito Fossella (R-Staten Island) $=
3,000; Edolphus Towns (D- Brooklyn) $500; Anthony Weiner (D-Brooklyn) $500;=
 and Peter King (R- Seaford) $300. Former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuli=
ani got $3,000; D'Amato $13,000 from 1996 to 1998; and Rick Lazio $9,400, m=
ostly during his failed Senate bid in 2000.=20
On the state level, Enron employees gave $1,000 to Gov. George Pataki last =
year and the same this year to Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Cu=
omo. They spent $60,000 to $70,000 in lobbying at the state capital each ye=
ar from 1998 to 2000, but substantially less in 2001.=20

Enron echoes past scandals

(Copyright 2002 by the Chicago Tribune)

Here's a modest proposal to major news media: Accompany every news story ab=
out Enron Corp. with a profile of an Enron victim so we don't forget who th=
is scandal is really about.=20
It's easy to forget the little people as we sort through the big people who=
 let the little people down in what is growing into Washington's latest big=
 scandal.
Chandra Levy's ex-boyfriend, Rep. Gary Condit, is not the only Washington s=
candal target to be relieved of pesky press attention by the war on terrori=
sm. Were it not for the Sept. 11 terror attacks, it would not have taken un=
til last week, when the Justice Department opened an investigation, to put =
this story on the front burner of media attention.=20
Houston-based Enron has been Bush's most generous corporate contributor thr=
oughout his political career. Thousands of investors and Enron employees wh=
o presumably worked hard and played by the rules suddenly lost their saving=
s and pensions, because there was less to Enron's finances than they had be=
en led to believe.=20
While their stock crashed, top Enron executives may have been able to bail =
out quickly without telling the public or Enron's employees, who were not a=
llowed at that point to move their pension funds from Enron stock to an inv=
estment that was making money.=20
Investors like to think they can trust the information they receive about a=
 company's stability and finances, especially when it is a company for whic=
h they work. If Americans cannot look to Washington to help them to protect=
 their hard-earned life savings from rip-offs like the Enron bankruptcy, yo=
u have to wonder what Washington is for.=20
Yet when you look at Enron's cozy Washington connections, particularly with=
 the Bush administration, you begin to wonder, as they say out in the rural=
 areas, whether the fox was guarding the henhouse.=20
It is premature to put this developing blowup in the same league with major=
 White House scandals of the past, but there are numerous unfortunate echoe=
s:=20
Bush's declaration that his good pal Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay never hinte=
d at the company's precarious financial position echoes Bush's father decla=
ring that he was "out of the loop" of the Iran- Contra affair in the 1980s.=
=20
Disclosures that Enron's Chicago-based auditor, Arthur Anderson LLP, destro=
yed thousands of Enron files sounded like the 18 1/2 minute gap in Presiden=
t Nixon's White House tapes.=20
We even have--Hello, again!--a familiar face: savvy attorney Robert Bennett=
, who defended Clinton against Paula Jones' accusations of sexual harassmen=
t. Now Bennett is defending and spinning for Enron to reporters.=20
That's Washington. The same faces keep coming back. So do a lot of the same=
 questions, to which the White House has its damage-control machinery worki=
ng. The strategy includes:=20
(1.) Look proactive. Get Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, who received a now-embar=
rassing $25,000 contribution from Enron for his Senate campaign, to recuse =
himself.=20
(2.) Have President Bush announce the criminal investigation, express sympa=
thy for investors who got the shaft in "this awful bankruptcy" and announce=
 new pension disclosure rules to protect workers in other companies.=20
Among Enron's ripped-off workers, that reform is called, "closing the barn =
door after your horses, your mule and all of your dairy cattle have walked =
away."=20
(3.) Deny, deny, deny. "I have never discussed the financial problems of th=
e company," Bush told reporters at a photo-op. "The last time I saw Mr. Lay=
 was at my mother's fundraising event for literacy. That was in Houston las=
t spring . . ."=20
Jocular George usually refers to his pals by first names or nicknames. But =
Enron's chief, one of his biggest benefactors, suddenly was just "Mr. Lay."=
=20
No, this scandal probably is not going away soon. Bush will have to learn t=
o live with his losses, just like Enron's investors, although Bush's losses=
 probably won't cost him as much.=20

Editorial
Learning From Enron

01/13/2002
The Washington Post
FINAL

Copyright 2002, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved

LAST WEEK the scandal around Enron deepened. The Justice Department announc=
ed a criminal investigation into the firm's collapse, and the Bush administ=
ration belatedly came clean about a number of high-level contacts it had wi=
th Enron and its creditors as the firm headed toward bankruptcy. More may y=
et come out. But for the moment there is no evidence that the Bush team was=
 improperly embroiled in the firm's deceptive schemes. Enron appears to hav=
e sought help from the administration in securing fresh credit from its ban=
kers and in staving off a downgrade by a credit-rating firm. But no help se=
ems to have been given.=20
The real scandal about Enron is different. It is that a public company, wit=
h a legal obligation to report accurately on its finances, concealed the tr=
ue state of those finances from its owners. Those owners included many smal=
l investors who either held Enron stock directly or through their retiremen=
t funds, and who have been cheated. Many Enron employees, who were encourag=
ed by the company to fill their retirement plans with company stock, have b=
een left with little or nothing. Meanwhile Enron's senior managers, who eit=
her perpetrated the fraud or at a minimum failed to prevent it, have extrac=
ted millions in pay and bonuses from the company.
The task now is to identify those responsible for this disaster and to devi=
se regulations that might prevent its recurrence. As well as senior officia=
ls within Enron, the spotlight must fall on Arthur Andersen, the auditing f=
irm that was supposed to certify the accuracy of Enron's accounts. Auditors=
 often defend themselves in such cases by blaming the firm, claiming that m=
anagers gave them false numbers to work with. But in Enron's case, Andersen=
 has already admitted that it spotted accounting mistakes and suggested tha=
t they be put right, but then certified the accounts as accurate without an=
y corrections. What's more, Andersen now confesses to have destroyed docume=
nts related to Enron, not the usual behavior of an innocent party.=20
Three kinds of reform might make corporate accounts more accurate in future=
. The first is to make corporate board members take their responsibilities =
more seriously. Boards are supposed to ensure that managers act in sharehol=
ders' interests, and a key part of their job is to appoint tough auditors t=
o verify financial statements. But board members often do managers' bidding=
, either because they are drawn from management ranks or because their inde=
pendence is compromised by consulting contracts with the company. Enron boa=
rd members received thousands of dollars from the managers they oversaw. Th=
is practice should be strictly limited.=20
Second, and most important, the rules by which auditors work should be made=
 tougher. At present, the Financial Accounting Standards Board is reluctant=
 to take a hard line on accounting tricks used to deceive shareholders, in =
part because the board depends on auditing firms and public companies for i=
ts budget. As a result, Enron's practice of concealing its risky financial =
instruments in partner firms may actually have been legal under the board's=
 standards, even though it rendered its published accounts meaningless. Thi=
s is scandalous; no investor, no matter how sophisticated, could have known=
 the full extent of Enron's obligations (which sank the firm). Until firms =
are required to disclose completely their obligations, how can stockholders=
 know which firms are burdened by debts that don't appear on their balance =
sheets? And if stockholders can't reliably know the extent of corporate obl=
igations, how can it be safe to buy stocks?=20
Finally, auditors' independence should be ensured. At present, auditors pro=
vide consulting services to the firms they oversee, harming their independe=
nce in the same way that board members compromise themselves. Setting a cap=
 on such services, or requiring more detailed disclosure of them, is worth =
considering.=20
None of these changes will be easy, to be sure. But Enron threatens "a mass=
ive loss of public confidence in the numbers that are the bedrock of Americ=
an markets," in the words of Arthur Levitt, the former head of the Securiti=
es and Exchange Commission. He is right, and it is time to do something abo=
ut it.

THE NATION NEWS ANALYSIS White House's Failure to Sound Alarm Faulted That =
no warnings were issued as Enron collapsed raises the specter of special tr=
eatment, critics charge.

Even though they mounted no formal effort to bail out Enron Corp., Bush adm=
inistration officials are coming under fire for not publicly disclosing the=
 extent of the company's troubles when they became aware of them.=20
Some legal experts contend the administration was in a position to sound a =
warning to the public or the Securities and Exchange Commission after a ser=
ies of phone calls from Enron executives to Treasury Department officials l=
ast fall. The fact that they didn't, while Enron's financial situation grew=
 darker and its stock price declined steadily, raises the specter of specia=
l treatment for a powerful corporation, congressional critics say.
But the Bush administration, despite close ties to Enron, did not help the =
firm stave off bankruptcy as the federal government had done for failing en=
terprises such as Long-Term Capital Management, Chrysler Corp. and Lockheed=
 Corp.=20
Enron was different. Many experts on government-business relations say the =
company's relationship with the Bush administration made aiding it a potent=
ial political embarrassment. But others say the administration decided not =
to help the company because its failure did not threaten widespread damage =
to financial or energy markets and the economy as a whole.=20
Yet the fact that Enron's failing condition went on without public disclosu=
re for so long--even as high government officials were apprised of it--puzz=
led legal experts.=20
"I'd be surprised if they [Treasury officials] didn't call the SEC," said a=
ttorney John Hanson, a specialist in bankruptcy cases for the law firm Noss=
aman Guthner Knox Elliot LLP, which has offices in four California cities, =
including Irvine and Los Angeles, and in Washington.=20
In October and early November, Enron President Lawrence "Greg" Whalley made=
 a series of six to eight calls in which he asked Peter Fisher, Treasury un=
dersecretary for domestic finance, to help secure loans from the company's =
bankers. Fisher refused, and on Nov. 8 Enron Chairman and Chief Executive K=
enneth L. Lay telephoned Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill to tell him of =
Enron's dire financial situation.=20
That same day, Enron filed documents with the SEC revising its financial st=
atements back to 1997, evaporating $600 million in nonexistent profits and =
accelerating its stock plunge.=20
Although the administration's accounts of what happened are incomplete, it =
appears that neither Fisher nor O'Neill asked the SEC to demand that Lay te=
ll stakeholders and investors about the firm's deteriorating condition, obs=
ervers note. "I cannot comprehend why they did not inform [SEC Chairman Har=
vey] Pitt," said a onetime lawyer for the federal government who asked for =
anonymity because he still does business with the government.=20
"My counsel would have been to call Lay back and request him to do full dis=
closure," said Lynn Turner, a former chief accountant at the SEC.=20
In the 1998 case of Long-Term Capital Management, a foundering investment f=
irm kept out of bankruptcy by a government-assisted infusion of capital, Fe=
deral Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan communicated constantly with then-SEC=
 Chairman Arthur Levitt and with the Treasury Department and the Commodity =
Futures Trading Commission, Turner said.=20
Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) charged last week that Bush administra=
tion officials had "done nothing to mitigate the harm of the Enron bankrupt=
cy to thousands of its employees and shareholders." In response, White Hous=
e Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said Enron officials had not provided the T=
reasury officials with any information that was not already in the general =
news.=20
Stock Rose After Earnings Revision Filed=20
But the record of SEC filings and public statements by Enron officials show=
s that Lay and other company officials maintained publicly that the company=
's energy trading business was strong and that it had the financial wherewi=
thal to survive the crisis even as some of the firm's difficulties became e=
vident in October and November.=20
The company reported a $618-million loss and a reduction in its shareholder=
s' equity Oct. 16, and Nov. 8 it revised its earnings for the previous four=
 years, although without public reference to its overwhelming debts or the =
financial peril it was telling Treasury officials about. In fact, Enron sto=
ck rose almost 20% in the four days after the Nov. 8 disclosures as investm=
ent analysts anticipated its proposed merger with Dynegy Inc.--later cancel=
ed--and said most of Enron's troubles were behind it.=20
Because the precise dates of Whalley's phone calls to Fisher were not relea=
sed, it cannot be determined how much shareholder value was lost between th=
e time Fisher was first contacted and Enron stock plummeted (it dropped fro=
m $33.84 a share on Oct. 16 to $8.41 on Nov. 8). But company shareholders a=
nd employees lost more than $18 billion of market value in that decline.=20
>From that point, Enron stock fluctuated until the end of November, when its=
 bonds were reduced to junk status, and the firm filed Dec. 2 for protectio=
n from creditors under Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Enron stock closed Friday at =
67.5 cents a share.=20
Legal experts are not certain whether officials have a responsibility to di=
sclose information received in communications from private industry. "It's =
a tough question," said Turner, the former SEC accountant. "Officials can h=
ave confidential communications."=20
In the case of Enron "the courts will decide" whether government officials =
should have pushed for public disclosure, said William Bagley, a lawyer in =
private practice who in 1974 served as the first commissioner of the Commod=
ity Futures Trading Commission.=20
Matters of disclosure are only one part of the mounting debate concerning E=
nron's collapse. Some say the Enron-Treasury discussions alone raise seriou=
s questions.=20
"It's a terrible precedent for the rest of the economy if major companies f=
eel like they have access to the highest levels of government and feel comf=
ortable asking the government to intervene in their private negotiations," =
said Austan Goolsbee, an economics professor at the University of Chicago G=
raduate School of Business. Goolsbee termed the Enron phone calls "borderli=
ne unethical."=20
But Alice Rivlin, a former vice chairwoman of the Federal Reserve and a Cli=
nton administration budget director, saw a responsibility for officials to =
communicate.=20
"When a really big company is in really big trouble, having the CEO call to=
 say 'You ought to know what's going on' is a good thing," Rivlin said. "If=
 they had gone down and not said anything, that wouldn't have been responsi=
ble. I think the reaction of the Treasury secretary, if that had happened, =
would have been, 'Why didn't somebody tell me?' "=20
Some See Secrecy as Part of Problem=20
Others see Enron's secrecy in all things as part of the firm's difficulties=
. "There's a front door in government and a back door, and most of these co=
ntacts were through the back door, hidden from public scrutiny," said Paul =
C. Light, director of government studies at the Brookings Institution, a no=
npartisan Washington think tank.=20
More appropriate, Light said, would have been public appeals by Enron for b=
ailout legislation, filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission "or=
 other above-board, in-the-sunshine approaches for help."=20
But many experts see Enron's political influence as a reason for its failur=
e to get a bailout. Politically, the Bush administration already had been o=
n the defensive for taking massive contributions from Enron, which in Calif=
ornia had been pilloried for allegedly trying to gouge the public during th=
e energy crisis.=20
But Edward Muller, an investor in energy projects and former president of E=
dison Mission Energy, said Bush administration energy officials did not rel=
y on political considerations in their decisions to withhold help. "They si=
mply decided that a bankruptcy of Enron would not disrupt energy or financi=
al markets or the economy," said Muller, who was in touch with officials la=
st fall in connection with his own business interests.=20
Enron, despite generating massive revenues, did not employ hundreds of thou=
sands of workers, as did Chrysler in the 1980s or Lockheed in the 1970s. An=
d unlike Long-Term Capital Management in the 1990s, its collapse did not th=
reaten banks across the country and the world.=20
Indeed, Enron's bankruptcy did not greatly affect prices for electricity an=
d natural gas, nor did it disrupt markets that trade in those commodities. =
One effect of Enron's bankruptcy, energy analysts said, has been to make ba=
nkers and financial institutions more cautious about lending and investing =
in power companies. But such caution typically follows any publicized bankr=
uptcy.=20
In any case, lawyer Bagley explained, federal bailouts are not easy to do. =
"There is no institutional structure, so it takes extraordinary action by C=
ongress--as in Chrysler or Lockheed." (In 1971, Congress narrowly voted spe=
cial financing to save the aerospace firm from bankruptcy after an unwise i=
nvestment in building a commercial airliner.)=20
Long-Term Capital was saved by emergency bank financing, but that was organ=
ized by the Federal Reserve. Enron could have been "rescued" by a similar i=
nfusion of capital, Bagley noted. "But where would the capital come from? T=
he Bush administration would have had to seek congressional action for Enro=
n." And given Enron's closeness to the White House, such an effort may well=
 have raised political difficulties too great to surmount.=20

Interview With John Dingell, Tom Davis
Tony Snow, Brit Hume

01/13/2002
Fox News: Fox News Sunday
(c) Copyright Federal Document Clearing House. All Rights Reserved.

SNOW: Continuing our discussion of the Enron collapse, we welcome two key p=
layers from the House of Representatives: Democrat John Dingell, ranking me=
mber of the House Energy and Commerce Committee; and Republican Tom Davis, =
chairman of his party's National Congressional Committee.=20
Also here with questions, Brit Hume, Washington managing editor of Fox News=
.
Representative Dingell, based on what you've seen so far, is there any case=
 for political hanky panky so far in Enron?=20
REP. JOHN DINGELL (D), MICHIGAN: I think it's too early to say. I think wha=
t we have to do is have a thorough investigation, get all the facts, and th=
en make the necessary judgment.=20
Certainly Enron's behavior, Andersen's behavior, have raised questions. And=
 certainly the fact that the administration would not reveal the matters th=
at went on with regard to the vice president's panel on energy and Enron's =
part in it raises some questions.=20
BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS: Well, let me just ask a follow up on that if I can, Co=
ngressman. What link do you see between the discussions the administration =
had on energy policy and the financial collapse of this company? Is there a=
ny connection?=20
DINGELL: Well, there's no connection there, but there is a connection which=
 is even more important, and that is what energy policy was put.=20
Remember, Enron was pushing very, very hard to have total deregulation of e=
nergy, particularly electrical utility energy sales that had a particular e=
ffect upon California and which caused huge disasters to the people of Cali=
fornia with regard to energy. Plus...=20
HUME: Well, how many investigations are you talking about here, Congressman=
? Are you talking about one about the financial collapse of Enron, or are y=
ou talking about two, including a separate investigation of energy policy, =
California's predicament, Enron's discussion with the vice president on tha=
t matter?=20
DINGELL: All this ties together.=20
HUME: How?=20
DINGELL: Enron was busy doing many things including stripping its employees=
 of their 401(k) benefits, including possible insider trading, including fi=
ling false reports with the SEC, the 10-Ks, the 10-Qs and annual reports, a=
nd they were also tied up in a peculiar relationship with Andersen, their a=
uditor.=20
SNOW: OK, Representative Davis, what do you think? I want to get your respo=
nse to what Representative Dingell said.=20
REP. TOM DAVIS (R), VIRGINIA: First of all, I think a lot of what Represent=
ative Dingell says goes to what the Post says this morning.=20
SNOW: That's The Washington Post.=20
DAVIS: The Washington Post, it's: "Poll finds bad news for Democrats lookin=
g for a traditional mid-term election edge."=20
Of course we ought to investigate the collapse of Enron and what happened t=
o the employees and how some of the largest owners of this and the CEO were=
 able to cash out while forbidding their own employees to do that. We ought=
 to take a look at the financial accounting standards on this. We ought to =
see if new rules and regulations ought to come forward.=20
But taking a look at these overall policies, just this politics, there's ab=
solutely no evidence to date that the administration did anything improperl=
y. And we know that Enron gave a lot of money to a lot of players in Washin=
gton on both sides.=20
SNOW: Carl Levin, who is going to be running an investigation on the Senate=
 side, has said on another broadcast that he thinks that Ken Lay, in fact, =
was asking over the phone for inappropriate favors from the administration.=
 Do you see any evidence of that?=20
DAVIS: Well, we know he was on the phone. We know that they had Bob Rubin, =
who was President Clinton's Cabinet secretary, call up on their behalf. And=
 we don't know all those answers yet.=20
What we do know so far is we found no indication that the administration, i=
n any way, did anything improper or answered any calls that might have come=
 forward.=20
HUME: But you are, as the head of the National Republican Congressional Com=
mittee, in the process of returning campaign contributions.=20
DAVIS: Absolutely.=20
HUME: Well, if there's nothing improper here, why return the money?=20
DAVIS: Well, I'll tell you why, because they gave $100,000 in corporate dol=
lars, it could go back and help those employees, help fund their pension pl=
ans. And, frankly, I think that is a better use of $100,000 at this point.=
=20
SNOW: Representative Dingell, you also got some money over the years from E=
nron. Did anybody at Enron try to contact you?=20
DINGELL: Well, Enron talks to everybody. And I've told them no at almost ev=
erything they've said...=20
(LAUGHTER)=20
... and that includes deregulation of electrical utility sales and things o=
f that kind.=20
SNOW: But during this period when Enron officials were contacting the treas=
ury secretary, the commerce secretary and the undersecretary of treasury, d=
id anybody call you and say, we want you to take a look into rating service=
s or we want you to give us some help?=20
DINGELL: No, they did not, and I would not have done so.=20
And by the way, Tony, they gave me $10,500, and we're going to give that mo=
ney -- I've already instructed my campaign treasurer -- to the funds that h=
ave been set up to help the employees, and I urge everybody to do the same =
thing.=20
HUME: Well, just to follow that up for a second, Tony's questions, when did=
 they contact you, how often and about what?=20
DINGELL: Well, they were usually contacting me about deregulating electrica=
l utility sales, and we always told them no.=20
HUME: When was the last time? When did that happen last?=20
DINGELL: Oh, over a period of some time, and we told them no.=20
HUME: What? Last year, last six months, last month, when?=20
DINGELL: Oh, over a long period of time. They contacted us about that. We t=
old them no. I opposed the proposal. I think it was the right thing to do.=
=20
HUME: Sounds like the $10,500 was a bad investment.=20
DINGELL: Well, if they regard it as an investment, they lost their shirt. B=
ut what we're going to do with that money is give that to the employees' fu=
nds to try and help make whole from the fact that so many of their employee=
s lost everything in the process of the collapse because Enron would not le=
t them cash out their 401(k)s.=20
HUME: Congressman Dingell, when the hearings get under way, will you be wan=
ting to have Bob Rubin among those testify about attempts to gain influence=
 or bailout for Enron?=20
DINGELL: If you watched me when I ran investigations, and I ran a lot of th=
em, and they were very, very effective, we had everybody in. And we saw to =
it that we got all the facts.=20
HUME: That would be a yes?=20
DINGELL: And that's what I want of these investigations in the Senate and t=
he House.=20
HUME: Would that be a yes then?=20
DINGELL: That means absolutely yes.=20
SNOW: Representative Davis, I've heard you talk about returning contributio=
ns, Representative Dingell talk about returning contributions. If you retur=
ned everybody's contributions, you probably would be able to save one or tw=
o of the people who worked. You've got thousands at Enron.=20
This is token help.=20
Now, is there going to be some move on Capitol Hill to make these people wh=
ole? And if so, shouldn't other people who have been the victim of bad busi=
ness practices and had their portfolios hampered, shouldn't they also expec=
t help from Capitol Hill?=20
DAVIS: Well, I don't know that they can expect a government bailout at this=
 point.=20
But, look, I agree with Congressman Dingell. We need to get to the bottom o=
f this matter. We have a criminal probe going on from the Justice Departmen=
t. I think that's appropriate.=20
But I think on Capitol Hill, we need to look at why the seventh- largest co=
rporation in America fell so quickly, why their corporate executives were c=
ashing out and their ordinary employees that had grown the company were not=
 able to do that and lost their pension funds.=20
SNOW: Is it your suspicion that corporate executives deliberately misled em=
ployees and told them everything was going to be fine, meanwhile, they cash=
ed out while the employees were left holding the bag?=20
DAVIS: That's the appearance is. I think we need to nail that down, but tha=
t is the appearance.=20
And the question then is, were they acting illegally, improperly, and do we=
 need to put in new rules and regulations to stop this in the future?=20
SNOW: Representative Dingell, getting back to the investigations, Attorney =
General John Ashcroft, who received money just last year from Enron in a fa=
iled Senate bid in Missouri, said he's going to recuse himself from the cas=
e.=20
Do you think anybody who's received money from Enron over the years should =
recuse themselves from the investigations? And that would include you.=20
DINGELL: I think there's a judgment that should be made.=20
Well, Tony, I'm just going to tell you, I've opposed Enron at every turn. A=
nd I intend to -- with regard to deregulation and questions that they regar=
d important and contacted me on, and I intend to continue that practice.=20
No, I'll give Enron an honest investigation. We'll look and see what kind o=
f rascality went on.=20
Remember, there's plenty here to look into. There's the fact that Enron, ap=
parently, made false representations in connection with their annual report=
s, their 10-Ks and their 10-Qs. They, either alone or together with their a=
ccountant, misrepresented facts. Their accountant also destroyed large volu=
mes of papers.=20
I don't think you can find anybody in the country who doesn't want to get t=
o the bottom of this. That includes me and every other member of Congress.=
=20
SNOW: Representative Davis, do you think either political party is going to=
 be able to gain political advantage out of this Enron scandal?=20
DAVIS: Well, right now there is absolutely no evidence that anyone in elect=
ed office or in the administration acted improperly. So at this point, I do=
n't see any advantage. I see people -- they're jockeying for it, when you l=
ook at the polls and how these have been used in the past. But I can assure=
 you, we'll have a fair hearing on the House side.=20
SNOW: All right, Representative Dingell, very quickly, either side getting =
an advantage? We'll get 10 seconds.=20
DINGELL: Well, Tony, I want to see a fair, thorough and complete investigat=
ion.=20
SNOW: All right.=20
DINGELL: I don't think we ought to make a partisan issue out of this. I thi=
nk we ought to get to the facts.=20
SNOW: All right. Representative Dingell, Representative Davis, thank you bo=
th.=20
Now for some viewers on the West Coast, Fox Sports and the NFL playoffs are=
 coming up. For everyone else, our panel is next. Either way, stay tuned to=

Tony Snow

(c) Copyright Federal Document Clearing House. All Rights Reserved.

TONY SNOW, HOST: In one year Enron went from the toast of Houston to just p=
lain toast. Executives walked off with millions of dollars, employees lost =
their life savings, and accountants shredded critical papers.=20
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
GEORGE W. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The administration is deepl=
y concerned about its effects on the economy. We're also deeply concerned a=
bout its effects on the lives of our citizenry.=20
(END VIDEO CLIP)=20
SNOW: Did Enron executives break the law, bend the law or fall victim to ba=
d luck? Will any politicians take a fall? We'll ask Treasury Secretary Paul=
 O'Neill and two key congressional investigators, Representatives John Ding=
ell and Tom Davis.=20
Plus, the latest on the hunt for bin Laden and a round-up on the war agains=
t terror. And our quadra-pundit panel: Brit Hume, Mara Liasson, Fred Barnes=
 and Juan Williams.=20
This is the January 13 edition of FOX NEWS SUNDAY.=20
Good morning. We'll talk with our guests after an update on America at war.=
=20
(NEWSBREAK)=20
SNOW: The top domestic story this morning: the collapse of Enron. Not long =
ago the company was the world's largest energy trader, worth $70 billion. B=
ut last fall the company acknowledged several hundred million dollars' wort=
h of previously unreported liabilities, and its stock, already hit by a wea=
kening economy, went into free-fall from a high of more than $80 a share to=
 less than 50 cents today.=20
A company that once boasted of never having had a bad quarter now has filed=
 for the biggest bankruptcy in our nation's history. In the process, thousa=
nds of employees have seen their retirement savings vanish, while some comp=
any executives managed to sell stock then worth millions.=20
Adding to the intrigue, Arthur Andersen, the firm auditing Enron's books, c=
laimed it didn't get some important records from the company and destroyed =
thousands of other pages of documents. The administration and at least four=
 congressional committees have launched investigations, but the complex cas=
e may take years to resolve.=20
So is this a corporate scandal, a political scandal, both, neither? For ans=
wers we turn to the treasury secretary, Paul O'Neill.=20
Good morning.=20
PAUL O'NEILL, SECRETARY OF TREASURY: Good morning.=20
SNOW: Now, in October you received the first of three phone calls from Ken =
Lay, the chairman of Enron. In his first phone call to you, what did he say=
?=20
O'NEILL: He called to tell me that he thought it would be useful for our te=
chnical people to talk with his technical people to understand the complex =
derivative contracts they had, to assure ourselves that their problems were=
 not going to get translated into larger problems for the U.S. and the worl=
d capital markets.=20
SNOW: So he did not seek direct help? He didn't ask for, at least at that j=
uncture, any intervention with rating services or anything?=20
O'NEILL: Absolutely not. No, he just called me to alert me that he thought =
we ought to pay attention to the technical details.=20
SNOW: All right. And when you got that request from him, did any alarm bell=
s go off? Did you say, this is an unusual request?=20
O'NEILL: No, I didn't think it was unusual at all. I get dozens of calls fr=
om people every day, and his call wasn't unusual.=20
SNOW: So you mean corporate executives will often call and ask for your adv=
ice about technical details of their derivatives trades?=20
O'NEILL: Well, they -- well, you know, this is a very unusual case in the s=
ense that Enron's the biggest energy -- or was the biggest energy trader in=
 the world. And so, in that sense, I didn't think it was unusual.=20
You know, I think one thing that's been missing through a lot of the conver=
sation about this is a lack of understanding of what goes on in the world.=
=20
As the treasury secretary at the time that I had this call, I was working o=
n the economic stimulus bill with the leadership of Congress. I was trying =
to get the Congress to pay attention to and pass a terrorist risk insurance=
 proposal, which, unfortunately, they failed to do. I was working on pursui=
ng terrorist financing all over the world.=20
So, you know, this is three, four-minute conversation in the midst of a sea=
 of things going on in the world, and I didn't think it was unusual at all.=
=20
SNOW: So it wasn't a big deal. The following day he calls. What did he ask =
for then?=20
O'NEILL: You know, I guess I don't remember two conversations back to back.=
 You're telling me something new.=20
I think what our records show is that I had two conversations with Ken, and=
 I think the dates are the 28th of October and another one on the 8th or 9t=
h of November.=20
And, you know, the second call that I had from Ken was to tell me that they=
 were being looked at by the rating agencies. It was just a heads-up, and t=
hat was it.=20
SNOW: So, at this point, one of the questions a lot of people want to know =
is, why didn't you tell the president, why didn't anybody tell the presiden=
t at this point?=20
O'NEILL: Well, again, you know, if you put this in the context of what's go=
ing on, the president's prosecuting the war against the terrorists -- you k=
now, I have been involved in big-league events for, I don't know, most of t=
he last 40 years. I didn't think this was worthy of me running across the s=
treet and telling the president. I don't go across the street and tell the =
president every time somebody calls me.=20
SNOW: This is the seventh-largest corporation in America. When you got thos=
e phone calls, did it occur to you that Enron might very soon be bankrupt?=
=20
O'NEILL: I had no idea. You know, I had -- I frankly think what Ken told me=
 over the phone was not new news. You all had been reporting for weeks that=
 Enron had problems, that they were in trouble and the rest of that. And, y=
ou know, it's part of the reason I didn't think there was any reason for me=
 to talk to anybody else, because I thought what Ken said to me was public =
property. It was not new news.=20
SNOW: So were you surprised by the collapse of Enron's stock value?=20
O'NEILL: Well, not really. I guess, you know, I've watched lots of corporat=
ions come and go. It's an interesting fact that there are very few companie=
s that have been around for 40 or 50 years or 100 years.=20
So, you know, in the broader scheme of things, not really. Companies come a=
nd go. It's -- part of the genius of capitalism is, people get to make good=
 decisions or bad decisions, and they get to pay the consequence or to enjo=
y the fruits of their decisions. That's the way the system works.=20
SNOW: Now, a few years ago, a company called Long-Term Capital got a bailou=
t from the federal government as it was facing bankruptcy. At least one --=
=20
O'NEILL: I don't think that's...=20
SNOW: I'm sorry. Go ahead.=20
O'NEILL: I don't think that's a correct characterization. My recollection i=
s that Long-Term Capital had a problem, and the New York Fed, I think it's =
true, played a role in convening the banks that were at risk, but I don't t=
hink the federal government provided anything at all, Tony.=20
SNOW: OK. In that case...=20
O'NEILL: There was no bailout. There was no bailout.=20
SNOW: OK. Well -- and there was no requested bailout here. There was a requ=
est for perhaps some aid in intervening with Moody's, which was doing corpo=
rate ratings.=20
O'NEILL: Not to me.=20
SNOW: OK. But to people under your jurisdiction, correct?=20
O'NEILL: According to accounts that I've read in the newspapers, that's rig=
ht.=20
You know, this thing has become a subject of lots of conversation. We have =
taken what I think are prudent steps, so that I've not spent any time talki=
ng to the undersecretary about the conversations he had with other people, =
to make sure that we do this correctly.=20
You know, I think we have done the right thing. We're going to continue to =
do the right thing.=20
The president has asked me to lead a couple of different groups, to see if =
there are lessons that we should learn, and possibly change law, rules or r=
egulations to better protect individuals who have a stake in a 401(k) plan =
or a pension plan, to make sure that the people that are involved out there=
 in companies are not disadvantaged by decisions that their leaders make.=
=20
SNOW: Now, is the philosophy of this administration that, when a company ge=
ts into a bind like this, it's on its own?=20
O'NEILL: Absolutely. You know, unless there's an issue related to the compa=
ny that reaches to public responsibility, you know, in the American capital=
ist system, companies are responsible for their actions.=20
And there is a broad scheme of laws and rules and regulations that instruct=
 and tell companies what they're supposed to do. And so, of course, you kno=
w, we don't have an interest in individual companies, and that's it.=20
SNOW: So you're not talking to Peter Fisher, who's your undersecretary work=
ing on this. There seems to be almost a see-no- evil, speak-no-evil kind of=
 atmosphere. You're not talking to a guy who's working for you. You and Don=
 Evans don't talk to the president until a meeting just very recently.=20
Surely there had to be some sense in your mind that these calls were inappr=
opriate, or that there was something about them that you did not want to pa=
ss along to the president. Is that correct?=20
O'NEILL: No, it's not. I didn't think there was anything inappropriate abou=
t someone calling me to give me a heads-up that there were some technical t=
hings that we ought to pay attention to. I don't find that inappropriate. I=
t seems to me it's exactly the right discharge of my duties to make sure th=
at the public's not going to be hurt by some individual company action.=20
SNOW: Now, Henry Waxman is saying that this administration -- well, let me =
read a quote from Congressman Waxman. He's going to be conducting an invest=
igation; a lot of people are. He's making allegation about the way the Whit=
e House has handled this. We're going to get it up on the screen here prese=
ntly.=20
He said, "It is now clear that the White House had knowledge that Enron was=
 likely to collapse but did nothing to protect innocent employees and share=
holders who ultimately lost their life savings. I'm deeply troubled that th=
e White House stood by and let this happen to thousands of families."=20
Your reaction?=20
O'NEILL: My reaction is, you know, it's just amazing to me to have this kin=
d of comment. What we knew, what I knew, I think what those of us in the ad=
ministration knew was public property. Everyone knew from Enron's disclosur=
es that they were struggling. We didn't know more than that.=20
The company had a duty to inform its shareholders and its employees about t=
hings that were going on inside the company. That's not a federal governmen=
t responsibility.=20
And again, we didn't have any knowledge that wasn't general public property=
. You all in the television world and in print media were reporting on kind=
 of a day-to-day basis what was going on in Enron. I didn't know anything m=
ore than you did.=20
SNOW: So when Ken Lay e-mailed employees in August saying he thinks the bes=
t times are ahead, do you think he was being straight with his employees?=
=20
O'NEILL: Well, I don't know. You know, that's something you need to ask Ken=
 Lay. I don't know. I didn't have inside knowledge of what the company's pr=
ospects were. You know, having been a CEO, I often -- I always communicated=
 with my people what I thought was going on. And you need to ask Ken Lay wh=
at he had in his mind when he sent that e-mail.=20
SNOW: Do you think the federal government or Congress ought to do anything =
to try to make whole some of the shareholders, especially people who worked=
 for Enron who've lost their life savings, or is that just the breaks?=20
O'NEILL: Well, again the second group the president asked me to lead is to =
look and see whether the laws and rules and regulations about disclosure ar=
e appropriate and whether something's been missing in the requirements for =
disclosure, especially in these areas that are so complicated.=20
I don't know whether you've ever spent any time trying to understand the de=
rivatives business. I did, because when I was at Alcoa we ran a billion-dol=
lar, multi-billion-dollar derivatives process in the 36 countries we were i=
nvolved in around the world. And it's an enormously complicated subject.=20
The president's asked me to look at the rules and regulations and see wheth=
er we need to modify them in some way to assure that shareholders and emplo=
yees are not disadvantaged because the disclosure rules are not strong enou=
gh.=20
SNOW: Mr. Secretary, final question. I'm going to read a Fox News Opinion D=
ynamics Poll question. We asked people about their optimism about the econo=
my, whether they think things are going to get better or worse in the next =
year. And 74 percent said better; only 14 percent said worse.=20
Are they realistic or guilty of irrational exuberance?=20
O'NEILL: No, I think they're on the right track. I think -- you know, I thi=
nk the information we have so far in the data on economic performance is a =
mix but I think it's mixed toward the positive side, and I'm optimistic we'=
re going to return to a good rates of real growth.=20
SNOW: With or without a stimulus package?=20
O'NEILL: Well, the stimulus package, I still believe, would hasten the move=
ment out of a slow economic period. It would help people who were directly =
affected by the events of September 11.=20
The president said over and over again, every person who has a prospect of =
losing their job or who has lost their job, we should care about them and t=
herefore, yes, we should do the stimulus package.=20
I'm hoping the Congress will come back informed by their constituents that =
they, the constituents, want a stimulus package and that we'll finally get =
a vote in the Senate. We already passed two bills in the House. Hopefully t=
he Senate's going to be responsive, and we're going to do something in the =
next few weeks.=20
SNOW: All right. Secretary O'Neill, thanks for joining us.=20
O'NEILL: My pleasure.=20
SNOW: Up next, Congress takes a look at the Enron mess.=20

White House Says it Offered Enron No Assistance

The Enron investigation is dominating Sunday's news talk shows. The big que=
stion is: What is the likely political fallout from the Enron bankruptcy?=
=20
KYRA PHILLIPS, CNN ANCHOR: The Enron investigation is dominating today's Su=
nday's news talk shows, along with the war in Afghanistan. The big question=
, though, what is likely economic -- what is the likely economic and politi=
cal fallout from the Enron bankruptcy. Well CNN's John King has more now fr=
om the White House. A lot of people are asking that question John.
JOHN KING, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: A lot of people asking Kyr=
a, and the political side of these investigations will go hand in hand with=
 the exploration, not only by the Justice Department and other government a=
gencies, but by the Congress as well, is into just how Enron filed for bank=
ruptcy and did it mislead its shareholders and its employees. That is the b=
usiness side of it, if you will.=20
On the political side, members of Congress want to know about contacts betw=
een senior Enron officials and senior Bush administration officials. There =
are political connections, the company is a prolific donor for political ca=
mpaigns, not only the Republicans, the Democrats as well. Also some persona=
l relationships between the president and the CEO of Enron, and as well as =
other senior Bush administration officials who have long-standing relations=
hips with the company and its senior officials.=20
Two Cabinet secretaries, Don Evans at Commerce, Paul O'Neill at Treasury, o=
ut making the round of the talk shows again today. They did receive a phone=
 call from the Enron CEO, Ken Lay, late last year before the company filed =
for bankruptcy, in which at least in the Evans conversation, Secretary Evan=
s says Ken Lay asked for help. Now two ways to get into trouble in a contro=
versy like this -- one is to do something hard and the Bush administration =
officials insist when Enron asked for help, the answer was no, and they say=
 any investigation will show that, that they did not help them at all.=20
But another way you can get in trouble and at least extend the political co=
ntroversy is if the answers don't match up. Here at the White House on Thur=
sday, the White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer was asked if Secretary =
Evans or Secretary O'Neill passed on word to anyone here at the White House=
 -- the president or any other senior officials that Ken Lay had called the=
m and asked for help. Ari Fleischer said not that he was aware of, that it =
was not passed on to the best of his knowledge. Today discussing this on "M=
eet The Press", Secretary Evans said he did indeed pass word on to the Whit=
e House.=20
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)=20
DON EVANS, COMMERCE SECRETARY: I was in the White House, a lot more started=
 to happen with respect to Enron. They announced the Dynegy merger. Shortly=
 after that, there was some question whether or not the Dynegy merger would=
 make or not. And so with all the ongoing and continuing activity at Enron =
and Dynegy, I thought the White House ought to know. I was over there one d=
ay, and I stepped into Andy Card's office and told him I received his call,=
 he simply listened to me and said thank you very much.=20
(END VIDEO CLIP)=20
KING: Evans said that Andy Card told him he did not pass that information o=
nto President Bush. Again, though, members of Congress, especially the Demo=
crats want more details of any and all contacts between the administration =
and Enron. Any regulatory decisions or other decisions made by the administ=
ration that might have benefited Enron and so you have not a conflicting an=
swer, but certainly new information today from Secretary Evans that he did =
pass some information onto the White House.=20
You can be sure that will be another request as Democrats in Congress as th=
e investigations of the political side of all of this go hand in hand with =
the criminal investigations and other regulatory investigations into just w=
hat happened at Enron -- Kyra.=20
PHILLIPS: John King, live at the White House. Thanks so much.=20

Enron-White House Relationship Continues Causing Controversy

More questions and few answers this morning as the investigation of fallen =
energy giant, Enron, shifts into high gear. A high-ranking Democrat has ask=
ed some tough questions from Enron CEO.=20
KYRA PHILLIPS, CNN ANCHOR: More questions and few answers this morning as t=
he investigation of fallen energy giant, Enron, shifts into high gear. A hi=
gh-ranking Democrat has asked some tough questions from Enron CEO.
Congressman Henry Waxman has asked Kenneth Lay to explain two upbeat e-mail=
s sent to employees that talked up the company's future, even though it was=
 sliding toward bankruptcy. Waxman also wants to know why Enron barred work=
ers from selling their Enron stock after the company acknowledged its finan=
cial problems. Enron also had some links to the Bush administration.=20
And CNN's John King is at the White House with more on this. John, how worr=
ied is the Bush administration about this investigation?=20
JOHN KING, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Kyra, Bush administration o=
fficials say they have absolutely nothing to hide, but they also acknowledg=
e that this is likely to become a political question -- some would say cont=
roversy -- for weeks, if not months.=20
The administration initially reacted a bit defensively to all these questio=
ns about contacts between senior Enron officials and senior Bush administra=
tion officials. Ken Lay, the CEO, is a long-time Bush family friend, not on=
ly of the president, but also of his father. He's close to the vice preside=
nt. Many officials in the administration actually have worked as consultant=
s for Enron. So there are a great deal of questions about contacts.=20
But you will see today, the Sunday news shows, you'll see the Commerce secr=
etary, the secretary of the Treasury out talking publicly. They've been on =
CNN over the weekend, and as early as Friday and Thursday as well. The admi=
nistration saying that the bottom line will be at the end of all these inve=
stigations, that a major political contributor of the president called and =
asked for help and the answer was no.=20
That won't satisfy people in Congress initially. You mentioned Henry Waxman=
, a key Democrat on the House Government Reform Committee. He wants to know=
 everything about the administration's contacts with Enron. He wants to kno=
w if in any way once they became aware in the administration of Enron's fin=
ancial difficulties, did they do anything to try to help.=20
There's a provision in what the president wanted in a stimulus package that=
 you could say would have helped Enron. It would have helped a lot of compa=
nies, but would have helped Enron specifically as well. So Congress will as=
k a lot of questions about this, but the Bush administration says in the en=
d though the answer will be, and they insist the answer will be, that a fri=
end of the president asked for help and the answer was no.=20
PHILLIPS: So the focus will be on whether the company deliberately lied abo=
ut its financial position?=20
KING: That is one of the questions, and then there's a subplot to that. One=
 of the things Congressman Waxman wants to know is, if the secretary of the=
 Treasury and if the secretary of Commerce knew that Enron was in trouble a=
nd that Enron was saying different things in public, did they have a respon=
sibility to put other government agencies on alert. Did they have a respons=
ibility to pressure the company to be more candid and honest.=20
Bush administration officials say when those conversations took place betwe=
en cabinet members and senior Enron officials, that there was public knowle=
dge of the company's troubles, perhaps not detailed public knowledge, but t=
hat Enron was already on record.=20
But one of the things you mentioned in the lead-in, Henry Waxman wants to k=
now, why was Ken Lay writing optimistic e-mails to company employees at aro=
und the time he was calling Bush administration officials, there's a month =
or so difference, around the time he was calling them and saying the compan=
y was in trouble.=20
In one of those e-mails he said he wants to know if --- Henry Waxman says t=
o Ken Lay, if you sent those e-mails, then "they create the appearance that=
 you misled Enron employees about the value of their investments." And of c=
ourse, it was critical because many Enron employees were putting their savi=
ngs into the company's 401(k) plan and buying Enron stock in doing so.=20
PHILLIPS: Well, John, since we've been talking about the subject matter, I =
continue to get bombarded with e-mail. I just want to sneak one in here, if=
 you don't mind.=20
KING: Not at all.=20
PHILLIPS: This one comes from John. He says, "if these same set of circumst=
ances had occurred during the Clinton Administration, the outcry from the R=
epublicans and the various news media would have been so deafening that imp=
eachment proceedings would be the talk of D.C. by now. Why is the reaction =
to George W. Bush administration indiscretion so muted, compared with Clint=
on-era political scandals?"=20
KING: Well, I'd have to say I would, I guess disagree somewhat with the pre=
mise of the question. The inquiries are just beginning in the past few days=
. The Bush administration has launched investigations of its own. Congress =
will launch its investigations.=20
There are many committees looking into this in Congress, and as Congressman=
 Waxman is asking questions, he serves on the same committee as Congressman=
 Dan Burton, who is the chairman of that committee, who is the Republican t=
hat many Clinton Administration officials came to, I'll use the word dislik=
e. They might use a stronger term. There will be some to and fro here. Ther=
e's a great deal of media inquiry into this, media inquiry into the contact=
s between Bush administration officials.=20
As of this moment, Sunday morning here in Washington, there is no evidence =
that anyone in the Bush administration did anything to help this company, b=
ut there are a lot of questions. We're asking them at CNN. Others are askin=
g them in the news media. Congress is asking them as well.=20
And you can be sure in the weeks and months ahead, Congress will be asking =
for any and all documentation of contacts between the company and the admin=
istration.=20
And if any evidence surfaces that the administration did help the company, =
did reach out to help the company or in any way help hide information that =
should have been put in the public domain, then you can be certain those in=
vestigations will intensify.=20
PHILLIPS: John King, great to see you on this Sunday. Thanks so much.=20

Interview: Bennett Roth and David Ivanovich discuss the Enron debacle and h=
ow it might affect the Bush administration

01/13/2002
NPR: Weekend Edition - Sunday
Copyright 2002 National Public Radio, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

LIANE HANSEN, host: From NPR News in Washington, this is WEEKEND EDITION. I=
'm Liane Hansen.=20
Executives and directors of the Enron Corporation sold more than $1 billion=
 worth of the company's stock just before the energy trading company fell i=
nto bankruptcy last year, according to a report in today's editions of The =
New York Times. The Times reports that company chairman Ken Lay sold 1.8 mi=
llion shares of Enron stock between early 1999 and July 2001. But last Augu=
st in two e-mail messages to Enron employees, Lay boasted that Enron's perf=
ormance was robust and called the company the, quote, "finest organization =
in American business today."
In our studio this morning are two Washington-based reporters for the Houst=
on Chronicle who have been covering the Enron story. David Ivanovich report=
s on business and Bennett Roth covers the White House.=20
Good morning and welcome to you both. Thanks for coming in.=20
Mr. BENNETT ROTH (Houston Chronicle): Good morning.=20
HANSEN: David, let's start with you and these reports of possible insider t=
rading and potentially misleading e-mails from Ken Lay to Enron employees. =
What do you make of these reports?=20
Mr. DAVID IVANOVICH (Houston Chronicle): Well, it's certainly interesting t=
o see the extent of the insider trades in light of the company's collapse. =
I'm not surprised that the executives would have been talking up the compan=
y. Executives tend to do that. But what's so controversial about this, of c=
ourse, is that so many of the rank-and-file employees at Enron had Enron sh=
ares locked in their 401(k) plan, and were unable to sell their shares at t=
he crucial point when the stock was nose-diving.=20
HANSEN: So the executives were able to get--sell their stocks and the emplo=
yees were unable to get into their retirement accounts. What about the acco=
unting firm of Arthur Andersen? It disclosed this past week that it had des=
troyed documents relating to Enron's finances. Is that going to have an eff=
ect--what effect would it have on any investigation?=20
Mr. IVANOVICH: Oh, sure, I think that it really puts the limelight on Ander=
sen. On Friday, the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which has been inv=
estigating the Enron debacle vigorously, told the accounting firm that they=
 want to see the personal files of six partners who were looking in the Enr=
on case, and they want those documents by Monday.=20
HANSEN: Bennett Roth, Enron, and particularly Ken Lay, have long connection=
s, close connections with President Bush and members of his administration.=
 The president seemed to be distancing himself from Enron's troubles this p=
ast week. How close can you tell us are those ties?=20
Mr. ROTH: Well, they certainly go way back to Bush's father, who appointed =
Ken Lay to help run the economic summit in 1990 and the Republican conventi=
on in 1992 in Houston. Ken Lay and Enron have been Bush's most generous ben=
efactor over the year, giving him somewhat over a $1/2 million. And, you kn=
ow, when Bush was governor, there's this correspondence between the two men=
 in which Governor Bush wished Ken Lay happy 55th birthday, and Ken Lay wro=
te a letter, you know, talking about Bush's knee surgery. So I mean, there =
certainly has been a long relationship between them.=20
But certainly, Bush has done his best this week to distance himself, someho=
w suggesting that he inherited Ken Lay from Ann Richards, the former govern=
or, who appointed Bush to a business board. However, it appears to be a lit=
tle bit of a stretch there. Yes, indeed, Richards did appoint him to the bo=
ard, but Lay has said himself that he supported Bush in the 1994 gubernator=
ial race against Richards, and Enron and Bush actually gave Bush more money=
 than Richards.=20
HANSEN: Hmm. But Enron executives put out some feelers to the Bush administ=
ration. They wanted to help get some loans to forestall the bankruptcy, but=
 there's no indication the administration actually followed through. So wha=
t do you think we're seeing here? Is it just a potentially embarrassing foo=
tnote, or is a bigger problem looming for the administration?=20
Mr. ROTH: Well, we really don't know yet. I mean, this information has been=
 dribbling out. A month ago, it appeared that--I mean, from the Bush admini=
stration, there'd been no contacts, and all of a sudden this week we find t=
here's all these contacts, and much of it really depends on the congression=
al investigations, the Justice Department investigation, and this could go =
on. Now right now it's a distraction, and Bush would like to talk about the=
 economy, the war and other things, and this week ended up talking about En=
ron, and that's certainly a political minus. But it really remains to be se=
en. But there's certainly a lot more questions out there.=20
HANSEN: David, a lot more questions out there, I'm sure.=20
Mr. IVANOVICH: There certainly are. We have questions that--the congression=
al panels are all looking into this. We have so many members of Congress th=
at are now calling for investigations, it's hard to keep track of how many =
hearings and how many subpoenas have been sent out.=20
HANSEN: But there have also been members of the Bush administration that ha=
ve had to recuse themselves from involvement in this investigation, and Enr=
on has also made contributions to Democrats over the years. So how might th=
is affect the congressional investigation?=20
Mr. IVANOVICH: Well, you have so many members who don't know what to say ab=
out Enron right now. They--some want to speak up; some are afraid to. Most =
of the Enron money did go to Republicans, but there are a large number of D=
emocrats on the Hill that received money, as well.=20
HANSEN: Do you really think it's just going to be a distraction for the Bus=
h administration?=20
Mr. IVANOVICH: Oh, I don't know. I think that they're panicking right now. =
It's interesting to see their reaction. I don't think that they're reacting=
 in a calm manner about this at this time.=20
HANSEN: And, briefly, Bennett, what do you think, just a distraction or som=
ething more?=20
Mr. ROTH: Oh, I--it could be more than that. And I agree with David. The wa=
y they're reacting makes you somehow think that maybe there's more there. I=
 mean, why would they be so eager to distance themselves from Enron and so =
eager to point to the Democrats right now. I mean, they certainly are worri=
ed about this.=20
HANSEN: Houston Chronicle correspondents Bennett Roth and David Ivanovich. =
Thank you both for coming in this morning.=20
Mr. ROTH: Thank you.

Interview With Michael Weisskozpf
Kyra Phillips

01/13/2002
CNN: Sunday Morning
(c) Copyright eMediaMillWorks, Inc. (f/k/a Federal Document Clearing House,=
 Inc.). All Rights Reserved.

Michael Weisskozpf of "TIME" magazine discusses the Enron collapse.=20
KYRA PHILLIPS, CNN ANCHOR: Right now four Congressional committees are look=
ing into what went on at Enron before the company filed for the largest ban=
kruptcy in history. And, too, we wanted to point out that more than 250 law=
makers on Capitol Hill received campaign contributions from Enron.
"TIME" magazine's Senior Correspondent Michael Weisskozpf joins us now from=
 Washington to further discuss the political fallout from this bankruptcy a=
nd the investigations.=20
Good to see you, Michael.=20
MICHAEL WEISSKOZPF, "TIME" MAGAZINE: Good to be here.=20
PHILLIPS: Well, we received a number of e-mails from viewers on this subjec=
t matter. Remember yesterday, actually, we did a reporter's notebook talkin=
g about the subject matter. And if you don't mind, can I just read some of =
these e-mails to you and have you respond to them?=20
WEISSKOZPF: Please.=20
PHILLIPS: OK. This one comes from Jean. It's one of the first ones -- we go=
t a couple hundred of these actually. "I'm a stock investor that still owns=
 my Enron shares. What will happen to the stockholder's shares in the Enron=
 debacle?"=20
WEISSKOZPF: There are shareholder suits ongoing now, and most of their argu=
ments is directed against the insider trading by 29 top Enron executives wh=
o unloaded about $1 billion worth of shares before they dropped.=20
PHILLIPS: Now, a lot of people have been talking about this situation as th=
e next -- next White Water. Do you think that's going a little too far?=20
WEISSKOZPF: Well, certainly, the administration has a perception problem al=
ready because of its long-standing political connections with Enron and Ken=
 Lay, its Chairman. However, any scandal needs more than that. And unless w=
e find any type of official action in this administration which favored Enr=
on, I would guess that this would have short life.=20
PHILLIPS: This question comes from Dale -- this e-mail -- the question is, =
"What kind of tax advantages did Enron reap as a result of its political ca=
mpaign contributions?"=20
WEISSKOZPF: None. Taxes are -- campaign contributions are not tax deductibl=
e.=20
PHILLIPS: Now, Enron executives gave hundreds of thousands of dollars in po=
litical contributions. From your perspective, as a correspondent covering t=
his story, does it appear that this was a company that gave money to get wh=
at they wanted from the government? Do you think there was a favor exchange=
 here?=20
WEISSKOZPF: Corporations are not charitable when it comes to political care=
ers. They all have some motivation. However, even the wiliest of corporate =
executives realize those contributions only take you so far. It probably on=
ly gets you an audience, which is a great deal more than the ordinary Ameri=
can gets. But an opportunity to put your argument to decision-makers, that'=
s what they got.=20
PHILLIPS: Michael, another e-mail. This one comes from Kevin. "As a laymen =
to the inner workings of the legal system, I don't quite understand the del=
ay in bringing Enron executives to justice. They clearly violated the law a=
nd misrepresented the company's financial standings to their workers and th=
e world. What kind of outcome can the American people expect in this case, =
and when?"=20
WEISSKOZPF: That's really the job of these investigating committees in Cong=
ress; also, the Justice Department and the SEC. It must be proven that comp=
any executives were aware of misleading the public while they were hiding l=
osses. You need to show more than action, you have to show a kind of conspi=
racy behind it.=20
PHILLIPS: Michael Weisskozpf, "TIME" magazine. I enjoy your articles. We'll=
 definitely be following these hearings. No doubt, this is not going to go =
away for a while. Michael, thanks for being with us early on this Sunday.=

Enron Collapse Brings Bush Administration Under Scrutiny
Carol Lin, John King

The Enron collapse continues to reverberate in Washington. Top Bush adminis=

 on their contacts with the energy giant.=20
CAROL LIN, CNN ANCHOR: The Enron collapse continues to reverberate in Washi=
ngton. Top Bush administration officials today appeared on Sunday news prog=
rams to shed more light on their contacts with the energy giant.
CNN senior White House correspondent John King joins us now with more -- Jo=
hn.=20
JOHN KING, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Good evening to you Carol.=
=20
We learned more about those contact today. We also saw a shift, if you will=
, in the Democratic focus in its criticism of the Bush administration for i=
ts dealing with Enron before Enron filed for bankruptcy.=20
One Democratic criticism is two secretaries in the Bush Cabinet -- Don Evan=
s in Commerce, Paul O'Neill at Treasury -- had phone calls from the top off=
icial at Enron, the CEO and the Chairman Ken Lay in the weeks prior to Enro=
n's filing bankruptcy. Many Democrats say Secretary Evans and O'Neill had a=
 responsibility to give a public warning so that shareholders and employees=
 at the company who were continuing to buy the stock had some indication th=
e company's finances were headed south.=20
Secretaries O'Neill and Evans dismissing that today, saying they were told =
nothing by Ken Lay that wasn't available in the public domain. Treasury Sec=
retary Paul O'Neill says yes, he had two conversation with Ken Lay, but he =
considered them routine; and he says there was no reason at all to tell the=
 president.=20
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)=20
PAUL O'NEILL, TREASURY SECRETARY: Well again, you know, if you put this in =
the context of what's going on -- the president's prosecuting a war against=
 the terrorists. You know, I have been involved in big league events for, I=
 don't know, most of the last 40 years. I didn't think this was worthy of m=
e running across the street and telling the president. I don't go across th=
e street and tell the president every time somebody calls me.=20
(END VIDEO CLIP)=20
KING: Secretary Evans said today that Ken Lay did ask for his help, but tha=
t he refused and decline to intervene. Secretary Evans also disclosed that =
several weeks after that phone call he did tell the White House Chief of St=
aff Andy Card. He says Andy Card did not tell the president; that, in fact,=
 that the president learned about all these phone calls from Ken Lay to the=
 members of his Cabinet just last Thursday, a full two months after the fac=
t.=20
As all this plays out, four committees in Congress looking into it. Senator=
 Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, the Democratic vice presidential candidat=

 questions of the administration, but that so far he sees no evidence of an=
y wrongdoing.=20
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)=20
SEN. JOSEPH LIEBERMAN (D), CONNECTICUT: I have not seen any evidence up to =
this time that officials of the Bush administration acted improperly with r=
egard to Enron. In fact, based on the stories that are being told, I'd say =
that the Cabinet members in the Bush administration who were called by Enro=
n executives for help as the company was about to go into bankruptcy acted =
properly by not giving any help.=20
(END VIDEO CLIP)=20
KING: Still, other Democrats say they want men many more details of any and=
 all administration dealings with Enron -- not just in the weeks before its=
 bankruptcy. Democrats want to know if the administration made any regulato=

Bush officials saying they will cooperate with those congressional investig=

Cabinet members say they didn't inform Bush about Enron calls for help
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
Associated Press Writer

Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

WASHINGTON (AP) - Two Bush cabinet members said Sunday they never considere=
d intervening in Enron's spiral toward bankruptcy, nor informed President B=
ush of requests for help from the fallen energy giant.=20
"Companies come and go. It's ... part of the genius of capitalism," said Tr=
easury Secretary Paul O'Neill, when asked if he was surprised at the sudden=
 collapse of Enron. The company's failure has left the one-time energy trad=
ing behemoth's stock virtually worthless and thousands of workers' pension =
funds in disarray.
Last fall, a month before Enron declared bankruptcy, O'Neill received two t=
elephone calls from Enron's chief executive, Kenneth Lay. Lay also called C=
ommerce Secretary Don Evans at the time, reaching out for help to harness t=
he energy company's financial slide.=20
O'Neill's view of Enron's collapse was characterized as "cold-blooded" and =
reflective of "the 18th century, but not the 21st century" by Sen. Joseph L=
ieberman, D-Conn., whose Committee on Governmental Affairs is leading Senat=
e investigations into the Enron debacle.=20
Separately, Lieberman said that an internal Arthur Andersen LLP memo on Oct=
. 12 directing that all but basic Enron working papers be destroyed "raises=
 very serious questions about whether obstruction of justice occurred."=20
Andersen this past week revealed that Enron documents had been destroyed. B=
ut Lieberman said most troubling was that the memo, disclosed in a report i=
n Time magazine, "was specifically about Enron" and not a general directive=
 to clean out files. Congressional investigators want to find out why Ander=
sen did not raise flags about Enron's business practices.=20
Andersen, in a statement Sunday, acknowledged "there were internal communic=
ations that raise questions" about the handling of Enron documents and that=
 the company "is committed to getting the facts and taking appropriate acti=
ons in the Enron matter." The statement said it would be inappropriate to c=
omment further on the Time magazine report.=20
Lieberman and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said on CBS' "Face the Nation" the=
 administration may have been right in not intervening to try to save Enron=
. But they said the government's response - as well as earlier federal moni=
toring of its business practices - may have been hampered by the energy com=
pany's freewheeling flow of campaign contributions.=20
"We're all tainted by the millions and millions of dollars that were contri=
buted by Enron executives, which ... creates the appearance of impropriety,=
" said McCain, a longtime voice for campaign finance reform. McCain acknowl=
edged getting $9,500 in Enron contributions in two Senate campaigns.=20
Lieberman, who said he received $1,000 from Enron in his 1994 Senate campai=
gn, said one focus of his committee's investigation will be "whether any of=
 the influence" from Enron money affected the administration's handling of =
the Enron collapse, or oversight by federal agencies.=20
"I don't feel at all compromised," added Lieberman, referring to his commit=
tee's investigation.=20
Since 1990, Enron and its employees contributed $5.77 million to political =
campaigns, about three-fourths of it to GOP candidates. About half of the m=
oney was spent in the 2000 election, with President Bush a major beneficiar=
y.=20
O'Neill and Evans said Sunday that while they received calls from Lay in la=
te October and early November, they dismissed any suggestion of intervening=
 to help the company.=20
Evans said that Lay was looking "for all the possible ways that he could st=
abilize his company" and asked that Evans consider contacting credit rating=
 agencies. "I considered it and said, 'Thank you for the call,"' Evans said=
 on NBC's "Meet the Press."=20
O'Neill said that Lay, in a call of three or four minutes, "asked me for no=
thing." But O'Neill acknowledged that during one conversation Lay said Enro=
n's ability to sustain its credit rating "was a critical aspect" of keeping=
 a merger with rival Dynegy on track. The merger later fell apart.=20
The Treasury Department has acknowledged that, around the same time in late=
 October and early November, another Enron executive repeatedly contacted P=
eter Fisher, a Treasury undersecretary, trying to get the government to enc=
ourage banks to extend credit to the struggling company.=20
Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., whose Senate Governmental Affairs subcommittee ha=
s issued 51 subpoenas in connection with its Enron investigation, said Sund=
ay on ABC, "I have no doubt that they were asking for the government to tak=
e action."=20
But an Enron spokesman, Mark Palmer, said the calls "were informational" an=
d "not about trying to improve our credit rating."=20
Neither O'Neill nor Evans said they informed President Bush of the telephon=
e calls. But Evans said he frequently discussed Enron's situation during ge=
neral meetings with the president in November and December.=20
The tone of those conversations was "how sad it was to see what was happeni=
ng to that once great company," Evans said on NBC.=20
Enron filed for bankruptcy on Dec. 2.=20
O'Neill said his concerns involving Enron were over the possible impact on =
U.S. and global capital markets, but he was assured by Fisher that there we=
ren't going to be problems in that area. O'Neill said that at the time of t=
he calls he was deeply involved in pushing the president's stimulus package=
 in Congress, pursuing the financial trail of terrorists and dealing with o=
ther issues of greater concern.=20
"I didn't think this was worthy of me running across the street (to the Whi=
te House) and telling the president," O'Neill said on "Fox News Sunday." "I=
 don't ... tell the president every time somebody calls me."=20
As to the sudden collapse of Enron and the nosedive of the company's stock,=
 O'Neill said he was not surprised.=20
"I've watched lots of corporations come and go. ... There are very few comp=
anies that have been around for 40 or 50 years. ... Companies come and go. =
It's part of the genius of capitalism.=20
"People get to make good decisions or bad decisions, and they get to pay th=
e consequences or to enjoy the fruits of their decisions. That's the way th=
e system works."

O'Neill - I did not discuss Enron case with subordinates.

EFE News Service
(c) 2002 Distributed via COMTEX News

Washington, Jan 13, 2002 (EFE via COMTEX) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O'=
Neill said Sunday he never spoke to his subordinates about the Enron case a=
nd did not consider his conversations with executives of the now-bankrupt e=
nergy trader to be unusual.=20
During an appearance on the "Fox News Sunday" television program, O'Neill s=
aid he did not mention telephone calls from Enron president and executive d=
irector Kenneth Lay to his subordinates in the Treasury Department to ensur=
e that he acted appropriately.
Likewise, O'Neill said he did not consider it unusual that Lay called him o=
n a couple of occasions before Enron declared bankruptcy.=20
O'Neill said Lay did not ask for help and that the conversations on Oct. 28=
 and Nov. 8 or 9 "didn't last more than three or four minutes."=20
"I didn't think this was worthy of me running across the street and telling=
 the president ... I frankly think what Ken told me over the phone was not =
new news. You all had been reporting for weeks that Enron had problems, tha=
t they were in trouble," O'Neill said.=20
The Justice Department and four congressional committees are investigating =
the bankruptcy of Houston-based Enron, a company whose executives were larg=
e contributors to Republican candidates and President Bush, as well as many=
 Democratic candidates.=20
O'Neill said Lay told him that, at that time, Enron was worth $70 billion a=
nd he wanted to talk to "a technical person" in the department to explain t=
he company's problems and assure them it would have no consequences for the=
 economy or for the stock market.=20
Enron filed for bankruptcy in December, causing thousands of employees to l=
ose their jobs and the value of its stock to plummet from $80 per share to =
less than a dollar.=20
This situation meant that most of its workers not only lost their job but a=
lso their retirement funds, but some Enron top executives maneuvered to sel=
l their shares, which were worth billions of dollars, in advance of the pri=
ce crash.=20

Enron `gift' to Democrats for Dabhol project?
By Sridhar Krishnaswami.

(c) 2002 Katsuri & Sons Ltd

WASHINGTON, JAN. 12. Enron Corporation, which is becoming a major embarrass=
ment for and liability to the Republican Party and the administration in an=
 election year, is said to have given $100,000 to the Democratic Party when=
 the $3-billion deal with India was being clinched.=20
According to a media report, the Enron Corporation had discussed the power =
plant proposal with the then President, Bill Clinton's Chief of Staff, Thom=
as "Mack" McLarty in 1995 and 1996; and the White House continually monitor=
ed the India Dabhol Project through the American Embassy. And in 1996, four=
 days before New Delhi approved the project, the Houston Firm contributed $=
100,000 to the Democratic Party. However, Enron, according to the report, h=
as denied that its "gift" to the party was any kind of repayment for the Cl=
inton administration's attention to the project.
The controversy over the failed corporation has come to embarrass the Bush =
administration with many saying that it is now becoming the Republican vers=
ion of the Whitewater scandal that dogged the Clinton Presidency from almos=
t start to finish. The U.S. President, George W. Bush, and his senior aides=
 are maintaining that nothing improper has taken place.=20
The Houston-based firm is now the focus of a Justice Department enquiry, go=
ing into whether top Enron executives improperly shielded investors from lo=
sses and prevented the employees from selling billions of dollars of stocks=
 which were plummeting. Many Republican and Democratic law-makers also want=
 to know if Enron, with ties to the Grand old Party, sought any favours fro=
m the Bush administration.

 a sizeable section of the people rendered jobless by the closure of the 2,=

Significantly, with a major shift in the people's attitude, more and more v=

r Iqbal Mastan, many villagers left their jobs in Mumbai and settled down h=
ere accepting work for lower wages. Over 3,000 people from surrounding vill=
ages were also employed in the project work and the plant. "They are now jo=
bless and it's a matter of grave concern that crime rate in the villages is=
 picking up," he observed. The 68 year-old man claimed he hadn't seen not a=
 single case of crime in Anjanwel. But the closure of the plant made youths=
 engage in pilfering and stealing. Recently, eight youths of a village were=
 arrested for stealing copper rods from the DPC premises.=20

AUSTRALIA: Enron Australia book wind-up moves slowly.

01/13/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

MELBOURNE, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Enron Australia administrators said on Monday=
 that a wind-up up the group's electricity and weather derivatives book wou=
ld be a slow process following the rejection of bids for its sale.=20
"It is going to take quite some time for the book to be worked out just in =
terms of how all the counterparties are terminated and securing valuations =
on the books as well," administrator consultant Alan Topp told Reuters.
The Australian unit of Enron Corp appointed voluntary administrators Sims L=
ockwood in early December after its U.S. parent filed for Chapter 11 bankru=
ptcy.=20
The electricity book at the start of the sales process was estimated to be =
worth about A$5 million based on the mid-point between bids and offers on t=
he forward price curve, although valuations on outstanding contracts are st=
ill to be agreed.=20
The administrators last month provided data room access for nine potential =
bidders in the electricity and weather derivatives book, but the sale did n=
ot go ahead.=20
"The offers we received were in a form that could not be accepted, and seco=
ndly we had not received a number of confirmations from counterparties that=
 they would agree to the assignment of their book in any event," Topp said.=
=20
Topp said a creditors meeting was likely to be held on January 29.=20
"There are still a number of counterparties which haven't closed out," he s=
aid.=20
Enron has been a major provider of Australian power market liquidity, holdi=
ng a 15-20 percent share of the over-the-counter market which allows genera=
tors and retailers to hedge their exposure to the volatile spot market.=20
The company was once the world's biggest trader of gas and electricity and =
other commodities. The operations, dormant since early December 2, generate=
d most of Enron's US$101 billion in revenue in 2000.=20
Topp said the sale in the U.S. of Enron Corp's trading operation to Swiss b=
ank UBS AG , announced on Friday, was not likely to affect the Australian p=
rocess.

o the Sunday Times.=20
America's Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Institute of Cha=

New York next month, the paper said.
Rule changes to be considered at the meeting could cost the big players bil=

Top of the agenda at the New York summit will be whether the SEC should rev=

The Bush administration faces the possibility of a full-scale scandal in th=
e Enron bankruptcy. It can be dealt with quickly or drawn out painfully. Wh=
at will decide this is how fast and how thoroughly the administration comes=
 clean on all of its ties to Enron, and whether Democrats can avoid the tem=
ptation to pay back the Republicans for their long campaign against Bill Cl=
inton. White House forthrightness and Democratic restraint are the winning =
combination here.=20
It is now clear that Bush administration contacts with Enron were not confi=
ned to Vice President Dick Cheney's task force; they went deep into the Cab=
inet. White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer and other officials are try=
ing to spin their way out by dismissing all questions as partisan politics,=
 but the only way for the administration to clear itself is to open up its =
records, starting with the secretive energy task force.
That means minutes of meetings, phone logs, notes, e-mails, everything. Oth=
erwise, the White House will feed the perception that it is trying to cover=
 up involvement in a scandal that led to the collapse of one of the biggest=
 corporate donors to the Bush campaign--the largest corporate bankruptcy in=
 the nation's history.=20
Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, who received $25,000 from Enron CEO Kenneth L. La=
y a week before being defeated in the 2000 U.S. Senate race in Missouri, ha=
s acted appropriately in recusing himself from the Justice Department's cri=
minal investigation. But contacts between Enron and Treasury Secretary Paul=
 H. O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Don Evans also need to be explored fully=
.=20
The Treasury Department added Friday that Enron President Lawrence "Greg" W=
halley asked Undersecretary Peter R. Fisher for help in getting banks to ex=
tend more credit and that the two men spoke six or eight times in October. =
If the administration did have extensive contacts with Enron and knew that =
the company was about to collapse, why did it do nothing to protect the emp=
loyees who eventually lost their retirement savings, locked up in Enron sto=
ck? Exactly how many officials met with or had e-mail communications with E=
nron employees? Was the president aware of what his officials were doing?=
=20
Until recently, Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) was almost alone in de=
manding that the administration produce records of its contacts with Enron.=
 He shrewdly avoided stepping from demands for information to allegations o=
f wrongdoing. Now that five congressional committees have issued subpoenas =
concerning Enron, other Democrats should find strength to resist the innuen=
do and partisanship that marked Republican investigations of the Clinton Wh=
ite House.=20
Rumblings are also starting, though not yet on the record, among congressio=
nal Republicans who seem as alarmed as Democrats about Enron's ties to the =
White House. When Congress reconvenes, perhaps supporters of campaign finan=
ce reform will whisper "Enron" in the ears of members who refuse to petitio=
n for a vote on the languishing reform bill.=20
Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), who heads the Senate Governmental Affai=
rs Committee, will need to walk a line between tough questioning and needle=
ssly heated rhetoric when he chairs the first hearing Jan. 24. The administ=
ration will do itself a favor by cooperating fully. It may well turn out th=
at there is nothing to hide. But first the administration has to open its b=
ooks on its dealings with Enron.

Change the system that gave us Enron

As one congressional aide put it last week, the Enron debacle is the "perfe=
ct storm" - a catastrophic mix of all the worst in business, government and=
 politics.=20
After the biggest bankruptcy in history, the revelations kept coming last w=
eek:
The company's auditor, Arthur Andersen, confessed to destroying Enron docum=
ents during the very period last fall when it was becoming clear they'd be =
needed to explain why Andersen had not raised the alarm over the huge energ=
y-trading firm's high-risk practices.=20
The White House acknowledged that Enron Corp.'s chairman, one of President =
Bush's biggest political contributors, had contacted two cabinet officials =
as the company was collapsing. Enron denied it was seeking favors, but one =
of those contacted, Commerce Secretary Donald Evans, said Enron chairman Ke=
nneth Lay had indicated he could use government help shoring up the company=
's bond ratings. Ratings reductions are what pushed the firm into its final=
 downward spiral. Administration officials said they had given no help.=20
The Justice Department launched a criminal investigation while Attorney Gen=
eral John Ashcroft said he would not take part because he, too, had receive=
d generous Enron contributions during his Senate campaign in Missouri in 20=
00.=20
A string of congressional committees prepared for hearings, while Democrats=
 positioned themselves to exploit the Enron catastrophe in next fall's camp=
aigns.=20
It's far too soon to know all the implications of the Enron story. But what=
 is known so far is enough to point clearly to the need for change in the w=
ay business and politics are conducted in this country.=20
If it wasn't obvious before, the Enron case underscores the need for campai=
gn finance reform. President Bush may spend months trying to convince Ameri=
cans that Enron hadn't bought access and influence in his administration. T=
hat's going to be difficult, given the contacts disclosed last week and ear=
lier disclosures that Enron executives had met six times with Vice Presiden=
t Cheney during energy policy discussions last year. Enron has long been kn=
own as one of the most aggressive lobbyists in Washington.=20
Even without evidence of a quid pro quo between contributor and recipient, =
common sense tells you many contributors must believe they will get special=
 treatment, else they wouldn't spend the money. People who think they've bo=
ught protection are more likely to fudge the rules. Hence, the perceived co=
rruption in politics encourages corruption in business.=20
While much is still to be learned about the relationship between Enron and =
Arthur Andersen, it's already clear the case demonstrates the need for acco=
unting reform. Accountants are supposed to be watchdogs for shareholders an=
d the public. Too many have become lawyerlike advocates for the corporate e=
xecutives who hire them.=20
Part of the problem is the conflict of interest that has developed as accou=
nting firms have moved more heavily into corporate consulting. Many are sim=
ply afraid to jeopardize lucrative consulting deals by issuing critical aud=
its. Washington should tackle this conflict of interest by forcing these fi=
rms to divest their consulting operations.=20
Accounting rules also need to be strengthened so that reports to shareholde=
rs and regulators accurately portray earnings and risks. For years, Enron w=
as able to inflate its profits by concealing debts in a string of "off-bala=
nce-sheet" transactions. While some of this may have been done improperly, =
current rules do allow companies to hide debts and other obligations. Even =
Wall Street analysts were unable to figure out Enron's statements.=20
No one knows how many Enron-type time bombs are ticking at other companies.=
 But if the accounting rules permit deception, it's sure to take place. And=
 if the public concludes that corporate financial statements are not to be =
trusted, confidence in the stock and bond markets is sure to be undermined.=
 That's not what we need as we try to recover from a two-year stock market =
slump.=20
Finally, it's already clear that 401(k) retirement plans need major reform.=
 Thousands of Enron employees' retirement accounts were devastated when the=
 company's share price fell from $90 to less than $1. Company rules had pre=
vented most employees from selling Enron shares held in 401(k)s, even thoug=
h Enron executives were locking in fortunes by unloading shares as the comp=
any's troubles mounted.=20
Bills recently introduced in Congress would limit employees' risk by placin=
g a cap on the amount of the employer's stock that could be held in 401(k)s=
, or by giving employees the right to sell those shares.=20
While that would be an improvement, it wouldn't resolve the broader problem=
 - that investment choices in most 401(k) plans are just too limited. Parti=
cipants are left with too many eggs in too few baskets, an especially serio=
us problem if the boss offers poor investment choices.=20
There's a simple solution: 401(k)s should be changed to work like individua=
l retirement accounts, allowing participants unlimited investment choices.=
=20
Because Enron was so big - the seventh-largest U.S. corporation at its heig=
ht - it's tempting to see this mess as unique. In fact, political influence=
 peddling, accounting shenanigans, and abuse of employees and shareholders =
are widespread. Perhaps the Enron case is big enough to produce some sorely=
 needed systemic change.

National/Foreign
POLITICS EMERGE IN ENRON FALLOUT
Glen Johnson, Globe Staff

(Copyright 2002)

WASHINGTON - It was a curious bit of scheduling in the midst of a president=
ial campaign, but George W. Bush broke away from a trip to California on Ap=
ril 7, 2000, because of a pressing bit of business back home.=20
The Texas governor had to get to Houston to attend the opening of Enron Fie=
ld, a baseball park named after the energy-trading firm headed by his frien=
d and biggest individual donor, Kenneth Lay.
The $248 million stadium had been built by Halliburton Co., the Dallas oil-=
services and construction company that was run by Dick Cheney, whom Bush la=
ter picked as his vice presidential running mate.=20
Such connections between Bush and the Houston energy company that last mont=
h became the largest US company to file for bankruptcy protection - devasta=
ting many of its retirees' pension plans in the process - have given Democr=
ats the first whiff of scandal from an administration that has pledged to r=
estore honor and integrity to the White House.=20
To date there have been no allegations that anyone in the White House acted=
 illegally, or that Lay was able to exploit friendships within the administ=
ration.=20
But the investigation into how Enron handled its financial problems, and ho=
w the administration responded upon learning about them, could provide the =
Democrats with grist for the campaign trail as the party seeks to regain co=
ntrol of the House and to tighten its tenuous grip on the Senate in the 200=
2 elections.=20
Republicans are especially vulnerable because Enron and Lay gave a majority=
 of their campaign donations to the GOP, raising the specter of influence p=
eddling.=20
"This is the largest alleged stock fraud in American history," said Paul Be=
gala, a Democratic political consultant who had been a longtime adviser to =
Bill Clinton. "This is not about anybody's personal life, not about anybody=
's private failings. It's about allegations of insider access in a corporat=
e rip-off."=20
However, the company also donated to Democrats, prompting some Republicans =
to argue that they are inoculated from across-the-aisle criticism. The Demo=
cratic connections were highlighted on Friday, when the Treasury Department=
 disclosed that Robert E. Rubin, the Treasury secretary in the Clinton admi=
nistration and now chairman of the executive committee of Citigroup, called=
 a top Treasury Department official last November to discuss help for Enron=
.=20
Moreover, Democrats risk a backlash if their investigation is perceived as =
payback for the GOP's Whitewater inquiry during the Clinton administration.=
=20
Bush has been riding a popularity crest following his response to the Sept.=
 11 attacks.=20
"I think there's a great danger for Democrats if they seem opportunistic ab=
out trying to create a political scandal out of a business scandal," said S=
tuart Stevens, a Republican media consultant who was one of Bush's top advi=
sers, and who has worked on campaigns with William F. Weld, the former Mass=
achusetts governor.=20
"I don't think, just because Chuck Schumer received contributions from Enro=
n, he did anything wrong," Stevens said of the Democratic senator from New =
York. "And this is a case where there's every reason to believe the Bush ad=
ministration has handled itself exactly the way the public would want an ad=
ministration to act."=20
The comment hinted at the balancing act both parties face as Enron moves fr=
om the name of an energy company to a synonym for corporate failure - and p=
erhaps much more.=20
At least eight government investigations are under way.=20
What is not in dispute is that Lay and Enron were deep-pocketed political d=
onors. In the 2000 election cycle, the company gave money to 71 current sen=
ators and 188 current members of the House. It donated $1.77 million to Rep=
ublicans and $681,000 to Democrats, according to the Center for Responsive =
Politics, a campaign-finance watchdog group. Through his political career, =
Bush has received about $650,000 from Lay.=20
What is also not in dispute is that Enron suffered a spectacular decline. W=
hen Bush was inaugurated as president last year, Enron's stock was trading =
at around $80 per share. When he marks his first anniversary a week from to=
day, the share price will be less than $1.=20
In between, the company announced on Oct. 16 that it was posting a third-qu=
arter loss of $618 million. As the stock price began to spiral downward, En=
ron blocked its employees from selling Enron shares from their 401(k) accou=
nts, ostensibly because the company was changing administrators for the pen=
sion plan. In the meantime, however, 29 senior executives cashed in more th=
an $1 billion of stock. On Dec. 2, the company filed for bankruptcy protect=
ion, as thousands of employees said they had lost their life's savings.=20
Prosecutors are believed to be looking at how Enron used complex partnershi=
ps to keep about $500 million in debt off its books. The administration and=
 Congress agree that it is proper to investigate whether any laws were brok=
en during the collapse. Bush himself has called for an inquiry into the rul=
es restricting employee stock sales. He has also established a committee to=
 determine how to protect pension plans from similar corporate failures.=20
The fuel for a political debate centers on contacts between Lay and Bush ad=
ministration officials, as Enron's worth plummeted.=20
Lay was one of 474 people to serve on Bush's presidential transition team l=
ast year. He also was a member of a panel advising the administration on it=
s energy policy.=20
Vice President Dick Cheney, who headed the panel, has refused to give names=
 of committee members, or dates of their meetings. But last week, the admin=
istration said that Lay and Enron officials met with Cheney and his staff s=
ix times last year; the most recent meeting was six days before the third-q=
uarter loss was reported.=20
On Thursday, the White House said that three times shortly before the bankr=
uptcy filing Lay phoned Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and Commerce Sec=
retary Don Evans. In those calls, Lay warned the officials of his company's=
 financial problems.=20
Evans says he was asked if there was anything he could do as Enron faced a =
downgrading of its debt. In the conversation with O'Neill, Lay suggested th=
e possibility of a federally arranged bailout with private money, the White=
 House said.=20
Then, on Friday, the administration said that a top Treasury Department off=
icial was contacted separately by Enron's president and Rubin, the former s=
ecretary, and that they discussed the possibility of a credit extension for=
 Enron.=20
In all these instances, the administration officials said they did not take=
 action. Evans and O'Neill have said they determined that the fallout from =
Enron's problems was not wide enough to warrant special help from the gover=
nment.=20
O'Neill also said that as overseer of the capital markets, he hears from ma=
jor companies every day. "I was not surprised at all that I would get a cal=
l saying, `Hey, we've got a problem over here and you should know about it,=
' " O'Neill said Thursday on CNN.=20
But it is the lack of action that bothers one Democrat.=20
"It is now clear the White House had knowledge that Enron was likely to col=
lapse, but did nothing to try to protect innocent employees and shareholder=
s who ultimately lost their life savings," said Representative Henry A. Wax=
man of California, the top Democrat on the House Government Reform Committe=
e.=20
A Republican National Committee spokeswoman, Mindy Tucker, noted that Lay h=
ad ties to the Clinton administration - he slept at the White House and pla=
yed golf with the president once - and significant links to the Democrats w=
ho are now trying to sit in judgment.=20
"If people are going to grouse about contributions, everybody is in trouble=
. Joe Lieberman took contributions from them and he's holding hearings. Joh=
n Ashcroft took donations and he's recusing himself," Tucker said of Lieber=
man, the Connecticut senator, and Ashcroft, the attorney general.=20
Begala, who answered questions about a stream of political and sexual scand=
als while advising former President Clinton, said the Bush administration w=
ould be wise to release all information about its dealings with Lay and Enr=
on, and to return the focus to the company's operations - and not its deali=
ng with the White House.=20
"I have a Ph.D. in scandal management," Begala said. "These are hard and pa=
inful lessons, but I would offer my friends - and many are my friends - the=
 tip to just put it out there and stop pretending this is a not a scandal."=

CEO'S LONG PATH FROM FARM TO RIG

(Copyright 2002)

WASHINGTON - Kenneth Lay came from humble roots that, his friends and assoc=
iates say, he never forgot. He became one of the premier community philanth=
ropists and political donors in the country.=20
He also built and presided over a company whose failure, amid allegations o=
f financial improprieties, has ruined the retirement prospects of thousands=
 of its employees.
The portrait of Kenneth Lay, who will turn 60 this year, is disjointed: The=
re is both a folksy man of the people and a tough corporate operator, a man=
 whose contradictions have been brought into view as his economic and polit=
ical power has disintegrated into economic and political scandal.=20
"For a lot of us it's causing a conundrum that we're in, because it's kind =
of hard to put all these pieces together," said Bob Eury, president of Cent=
ral Houston Inc., a nonprofit civic group, and a friend of Lay's for 15 yea=
rs. "At this point everybody's kind of like, it's very hard to understand a=
ll this stuff."=20
Kenneth Lee Lay was a minister's son, born to Omer and Ruth E. Rees Lay, on=
 a Missouri farm. The family lived in tiny Rush Hill, a wisp of a community=
 outside Columbia, close enough that the three Lay children could live at h=
ome when they attended the University of Missouri.=20
"I spent a lot of time on a tractor and had a lot of time to think," Lay to=
ld the Houston Chronicle in 1991. "I must confess I was enamored with busin=
ess and industry. It was so different from the world in which I was living.=
"=20
Nevertheless, he thought his path might take him into the law, until he too=
k his first economics class at the University of Missouri.=20
"It was something that clicked with me," Lay told the Portland Oregonian in=
 1997. "I just found the power and effectiveness of the market system to be=
 incredible, which I pretty much believed anyway."=20
After finishing his undergraduate work in 1964, Lay moved among private-sec=
tor, government and academic work, making stops at the Department of the In=
terior (as deputy secretary for energy, from 1972 to 1974), the University =
of Houston (as a doctoral candidate; degree awarded in 1970), and Humble Oi=
l, later known as Exxon (from 1965 to 1968).=20
In 1985, Lay helped two struggling natural gas pipeline companies combine, =
and quickly emerged as the chief of the new company: Enron.=20
Over the years, Lay moved to orient Enron away from the staid business of n=
atural gas pipelines to the riskier - and more profitable - world of energy=
 markets. These were markets, through lobbying and crusading, that Lay help=
ed to create.=20
Lay also quickly made himself, and Enron, central figures in the Houston co=
mmunity. As the company grew, he pointed out that a company of its scope co=
uld have picked headquarters anywhere, and that Houston was a conscious cho=
ice.=20
"He was the go-to man for Houston, the individual in the corporate communit=
y who would get it done, the corporation in the corporate community who wou=
ld take the lead on those major issues," said Jim Kollaer, president and ch=
ief executive officer of the Greater Houston Partnership.=20
Lay's friends pointed to Enron's philanthropy and the lead role Lay took in=
 the creation of Enron Field, the home of baseball's Houston Astros, as exa=
mples of his leadership.=20
But Lay's generosity was not limited to community causes: He became one of =
the state's and nation's most prolific donors and political activists. Whil=
e a Republican by instinct, Lay and Enron gave money to both parties, not l=
east because Texas was dominated by Democrats until the early 1990s.=20
Lay drew close to the Bush family, supporting the father's two presidential=
 runs and helping the son's gubernatorial and presidential campaigns.=20
Lay served as one of George W. Bush's "pioneers," a group of fund- raisers =
who promised to each raise $100,000 for the presidential effort. Lay and En=
ron were among the biggest donors to Bush's presidential campaign.=20
His connections were clear: When Governor Bush addressed Texas's antipollut=
ion laws, Enron was one of a few energy-producing companies invited to help=
 redraft the law.=20
When Enron Field opened in 2000, Lay celebrated with Governor Bush and his =
father, the former president, in the owner's box.=20
Lay's early years in Washington had given him an understanding of the impor=
tance of establishment connections. He moved with relative ease between the=
 parties, whether staying overnight in the White House of former President =
Bush or playing golf with President Bill Clinton in 1993.=20
But in the end, his connections failed him: As his company careened toward =
bankruptcy, he reached out to some of those contacts, apparently to no avai=
l.=20
Enron's collapse has triggered a curious round of Washington confessions as=
 various administration officials have stepped forward to disclose their co=
ntacts with the corporation and the CEO.=20
At the same time, Karl Rove, Bush's top political operative, played down th=
e relationship between the two.=20
"The president knows him. He is a friend. But the idea that he is a friend =
in the sense that this is a guy who's a close intimate is just ridiculous,"=
 the Associated Press quoted Rove as saying on Friday.=20

CORRECTION: ATTENTION - ADDS details
WASHINGTON, Jan 13 (AFP) - US Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill was savaged b=
y leading members of Congress on Sunday for describing the biggest corporat=
e collapse in US history as "part of the genius of capitalism."=20
O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Donald Evans, appearing on the Sunday talk s=
hows, distanced the Bush administration from the collapse of the company, w=
hich left thousands of workers holding worthless pension fund securities wh=
ile top executives reportedly cashed out for hefty profits.
O'Neill, speaking on "Fox News Sunday," said the president knew nothing of =
appeals for help from the company prior to its collapse, which he described=
 as a textbook illustration of capitalism at work.=20
"Companies come and go," said O'Neill. "It's -- part of the genius of capit=
alism is, people get to make good decisions or bad decisions, and they get =
to pay the consequence or to enjoy the fruits of their decisions. That's th=
e way the system works."=20
The Justice Department has launched a criminal investigation and members of=
 Congress have announced a series of probes into the affair.=20
Speaking on the CBS show "Face the Nation," Senator Joseph Lieberman, a for=
mer Democratic vice-presidential candidate, described O'Neill's comments as=
 "outrageous."=20
"Those are statements that might have been made by the secretary of the tre=
asury in the 18th century, but not in the 21st century."=20
"The death that Enron experienced was not a natural death. We know enough t=
o know that now," he added. "This was not capitalism as we want it to be."=
=20
While Enron sped toward a corporate train wreck and executives pulled some =
one billion dollars out of the firm, chairman Kenneth Lay was telling worke=
rs that prospects for the energy giant had never looked better, according t=
o information released by congressional investigators to US media.=20
Republican Senator John McCain, also speaking on CBS, said the collapse of =
Enron was "tainted" by the firm's massive contributions to politicians.=20
McCain and Lieberman said they agreed with a federal judge in Houston, Texa=
s, who was considering freezing the assets of top company executives, so th=
at ordinary shareholders could be compensated if the case went to the court=
s.=20
O'Neill and Evans both said they had received phone calls from Lay, a big f=
inancial supporter of Bush, prior to the company's collapse, but said that =
no demand from the company for help had been passed on to Bush.=20
"I didn't think this was worthy of me running across the street (to the Whi=
te House) to tell the president," he said.=20
For over a decade Enron has been a major contributor to US politicians both=
 Democrat and Republican, and among those benefitting most was Bush, who re=
ceived 623,000 dollars from Enron since launching his political career in 1=
993, according to news reports in Washington.=20
But Evans, speaking on NBC's "Meet the Press" talk show, said there was no =
payback.=20
He also rejected criticism from Henry Waxman, the senior Democrat of the Ho=
use Committee on Government Reform, who said the White House could have int=
ervened to prevent tens of thousands of ordinary people from losing their s=
avings.=20
"If I had stepped in I think it would have been an egregious abuse of the o=
ffice of secretary of commerce of the United States of America," he said.=
=20
Enron hid its losses and overstated its profits prior to the collapse while=
 the firm's auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, has admitted shredding documents =
related to its audit of the firm.=20
Lieberman, who is leading one of the congressional investigations, said the=
 fallout from the scandal could destroy the internationally acclaimed accou=
nting firm.=20

Firms offering severance, but only if workers agree not to file unemploymen=

MOST of us figure that state unemployment insurance is a safety net. If we =
get laid off, we can always rely on up to $319 a week we can collect in une=
mployment benefits from the Texas Workforce Commission.=20
But you can't be so sure these days.
If you're receiving severance payments from your old employer, take a close=
 look. You may have waived your rights to unemployment benefits without rea=
lizing it.=20
Four former employees from Mitchell Energy & Development Corp. found out th=
e hard way. They not only lost their unemployment benefits, but they also w=
ere hit with a $41,479 judgment after Mitchell Energy successfully argued i=
n federal court that they relinquished their rights when they accepted an e=
arly retirement package.=20
In an attempt to reduce their state unemployment insurance tax, some employ=
ers like Mitchell are forcing their employees to make a choice: Either take=
 a company-sponsored buyout package or state unemployment compensation - bu=
t not both.=20
The lure is attractive to employers because companies pay unemployment taxe=
s based on the number of ex-employees who receive benefits. The fewer filin=
gs for unemployment benefits, the lower an employer's tax. The amount of we=
ekly benefits received by former employees is based on salary levels.=20
While it's unclear how many companies have adopted this practice, several e=
mployment law experts believe it will become far more common now that a fed=
eral judge has ruled they can do it.=20
And it is a significant expense. Employers can pay as much as 6.54 percent =
of the first $9,000 in wages per employee, or $588.60 each year, when they =
have a lot of claims filed against them.=20
Employment taxes may be costly. But there's a problem when employers force =
employees to waive their rights to unemployment benefits: Texas law prohibi=
ts it. In fact, the penalty is a six- month jail term for an employer who e=
ven accepts a waiver.=20
Mitchell Energy, however, argued that such waivers do not break the law bec=
ause its early retirement plan is covered under the federal Employee Retire=
ment Income and Security Act and therefore supercedes state law.=20
Under ERISA, companies that provide benefits such as health insurance and p=
ensions have a wide berth in structuring their plans, giving them freedom t=
o override related state regulations.=20
Until now, no one questioned whether ERISA would pre-empt state law concern=
ing unemployment compensation.=20
In mid-November, U.S. District Judge David Hittner ruled that because Mitch=
ell's early retirement plan doesn't allow employees to file claims against =
the company, they're not entitled to unemployment benefits. Hittner's rulin=
g, according to W. Fulton Broemer, the attorney representing the four Mitch=
ell workers, is the first time a federal judge in the United States has rul=
ed ERISA overrides a state law that carries criminal penalties.=20
It's like saying that if a severance plan that's covered under ERISA requir=
es you to kill a mockingbird before you can get your money, you must kill t=
he bird, even though it's against state law in Texas, Broemer said.=20
Hittner also ruled that the waiver the employees signed to receive their ea=
rly retirement benefits - which said they wouldn't file any claims against =
Mitchell Energy, but did not specifically mention unemployment benefits - w=
as not vague and was fully enforceable.=20
A spokesman for Mitchell Energy said the company did not want to comment on=
 the case.=20
...=20
Legislation planned=20
Concern over the Mitchell case has U.S. Rep. Gene Green, D- Houston, vowing=
 to introduce legislation that would prevent employers from using ERISA as =
a shield against unemployment taxes.=20
Unemployment insurance was designed as a bridge, he said.=20
"It's not like someone is getting rich on it," said Green. "They're just tr=
ying to keep their homes and insurance."=20
The Mitchell case has unnerved many ex-Enron employees who also agreed not =
to apply for unemployment benefits in exchange for hefty severance checks. =
Enron's severance agreement specifically states that if an ex-employee file=
s for unemployment benefits, severance benefits will stop.=20
Johnnie Williams knew that when she agreed to forfeit unemployment benefits=
 in exchange for about $52,400 in severance when she lost her job in mid-No=
vember. But that was before Enron filed for bankruptcy. Now Williams is sta=
nding in line with thousands of other creditors questioning whether they'll=
 get paid.=20
And like those thousands of other ex-Enron employees, Williams has bills to=
 pay. Those unemployment checks would come in handy.=20
Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said Enron officials decided they didn't want=
 employees to collect both unemployment insurance and severance.=20
It's not illegal to put that condition into the severance plan, she said.=
=20
Denne said Enron's internal rule doesn't affect the employees who lost thei=
r jobs after the bankruptcy filing and received $4,500 in severance pay, wh=
ich isn't subject to ERISA rules. They can apply for unemployment benefits,=
 she said.=20
...=20
Clash at Mitchell Energy=20
As for the Mitchell Energy case, it all started in December 1998 when emplo=
yees were told they would lose their jobs if they didn't agree to take a vo=
luntary early retirement package, according to court documents.=20
The employees, who worked for Mitchell in Mineral Wells, agreed to take the=
 package and were told by representatives of the Texas Workforce Commission=
 that they could file for unemployment insurance for the 90-day period befo=
re their retirement benefits kicked in. The commission representatives had =
been asked by Mitchell Energy to speak to the employees who worked in the t=
own of 14,000 west of Fort Worth.=20
The employees filed for unemployment benefits and initially began receiving=
 checks. But when Mitchell Energy found out, company officials reminded the=
 employees that they had agreed not to file any claims against the company.=
=20
All but four of the employees dropped their claims for unemployment benefit=
s. Mitchell Energy sued the four for damages.=20
Initially, the Texas Workforce Commission sided with the employees, saying =
that they were entitled to unemployment benefits. But after Mitchell appeal=
ed, the commission reversed itself. In a 2- to-1 vote, commissioners sided =
with Mitchell, agreeing the four employees left the company voluntarily.=20
...=20
Dissenting voice=20
In his dissent, T.P. O'Mahoney, the commissioner appointed to represent wor=
kers, said he believed the employees were clearly facing a layoff.=20
"The employer's refusal to tell the employees when the work was ending or m=
ake it clear which particular positions were targeted for layoff appears to=
 have been nothing more than an attempt to leave the employees in the dark =
and prevent the receipt of unemployment benefits," O'Mahoney wrote.=20
The four employees sued the Texas Workforce Commission over its decision in=
 state district court in Austin. That case is pending.=20
Meanwhile, Judge Hittner ruled that the four employees - Vada L. Fain, Lest=
er G. Trollinger, John F. Wilkins and Greer H. Yoes - violated their agreem=
ent not to file any claims against Mitchell and must pay $41,479 in attorne=
y fees and other expenses to Mitchell to litigate the case.=20
But when an employee files for unemployment benefits, it's not a claim agai=
nst a company, argued Rick McHugh, staff attorney with the New York City-ba=
sed National Employment Law Project, a public policy group that examines wo=
rkplace issues.=20
Unemployment benefits are a statutory benefit given by the Legislature, McH=
ugh said.=20
"It's not a matter for employers to bargain about," said McHugh, who works =
in Ann Arbor, Mich.=20
Using that logic, McHugh asked, would the Texas Workforce Commission pay un=
employment benefits to striking employees if an employer agreed to those pa=
yments in an ERISA severance plan? Under current law, strikers aren't eligi=
ble for unemployment benefits.=20
While McHugh said he doubts the Texas Workforce Commission would adhere to =
such an ERISA plan, it's hard to know for sure.=20
Texas Workforce Commission spokesman Larry Jones said his agency isn't awar=
e of the Mitchell Energy case in federal court and can't comment. And since=
 the four employees have sued the commission, Jones said it isn't appropria=
te to comment.=20
And there's another issue, McHugh said. How can ERISA supersede state unemp=
loyment laws when state unemployment compensation was created by federal la=
w in the first place? The federal unemployment system was created by the So=
cial Security Act and the Federal Unemployment Tax Act.=20
...=20
A precedent?=20
McHugh is worried about the precedent the Mitchell case may set for other s=
tates that have laws similar to Texas prohibiting employee waivers.=20
If the Mitchell case gets upheld on appeal, McHugh worries there'd be nothi=
ng to stop employers from doing the same thing with other benefit plans, su=
ch as workers' compensation, said McHugh. An employer could easily offer ea=
rly retirement or severance to an injured worker in exchange for dropping a=
 workers' compensation claim.=20
Broemer has appealed Hittner's ruling to the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appe=
als in New Orleans. McHugh said his group would like to pitch in and help w=
ith the appeal.=20
Joe Ahmad, a Houston employment lawyer with Ahmad, Zavitsanos & Anaipakos, =
doesn't think the ERISA pre-emption argument will hold up.=20
The courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court and the 5th Circuit, have been=
 showing a bias against ERISA pre-emption in other issues. Instead, they've=
 been focusing more and more on states' rights.=20
But Tony Rosenstein, an employment lawyer at Baker & Botts, believes Hittne=
r was right on target.=20
There was clearly an ERISA pre-emption, said Rosenstein. And the unemployme=
nt statute isn't like embezzlement or bank robbery, which are part of state=
 criminal law.=20
Meanwhile, Rep. Green has directed his staff to look into the case, and if =
the appeal of the four ex-Mitchell employees fails, he plans to introduce l=
egislation to prohibit an ERISA pre-emption on unemployment benefits.=20
This kind of pre-emption was never intended by Congress, Green said, especi=
ally since unemployment insurance was created by federal law.=20
...=20
Push for action in Texas=20
The issue needs to come up in the next session of the Texas Legislature, sa=
id Richard Shaw, secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO, who has vowed to lead =
the fight.=20
It's an "atrocity" that the Texas Workforce Commission allows employers to =
get out of paying benefits even though the Legislature said employees who l=
ose their jobs are clearly entitled to them, Shaw said.=20
Texas already disqualifies many more employees than other states, so many o=
ut-of-work Texans don't receive unemployment benefits, said Rick Levy, lega=
l director for the Texas AFL-CIO.=20
Levy said that's because the Texas Workforce Commission has a broader defin=
ition of misconduct than most states and it doesn't count the last quarter =
of wages when computing eligibility.=20
Meanwhile, Williams decided to file for unemployment benefits while she wai=
ts for the bankruptcy court to act.

When a newly minted President Bush strode into the White House nearly a yea=
r ago, the influence and interests of Kenneth Lay, and his massive Enron en=
ergy trading company, were only a few steps behind.=20
Lay, an old Bush family acquaintance and the chairman of Houston- based Enr=
on, was already a member of the new president's transition team on energy i=
ssues. Within a few months, he consulted with White House personnel directo=
r Clay Johnson on possible presidential appointees to the Federal Energy Re=
gulatory Commission, which oversees some of Enron's markets. Bush made an E=
nron vice chairman secretary of the Army. Vice President Dick Cheney's ener=
gy task force turned to Lay for his expertise six times.
The repetitive presence of Lay and his energy monolith during the opening y=
ear of Bush's presidency is extraordinary for its frequency and for its sor=
ry conclusion.=20
When Enron's wobbly house of trading cards began to tumble in late October,=
 Lay and his assistants did not hesitate to make hot-line- style calls to B=
ush's treasury and commerce secretaries to drop their bombshell about the c=
ompany's precarious state and to hint at a government-led bailout, which ne=
ver happened.=20
Bush, former governor of Texas, has said he never discussed the company's t=
roubles with Lay, whom he has known for years. Other White House aides dism=
issed any suggestion that the administration took steps to save Enron from =
its impending collapse and the bankruptcy proceeding that followed.=20
But while Democrats were quick to point out the chummy Bush-Lay relationshi=
p of days gone by, they have lately taken a more cautious tone.=20
"There's smoke here, but there's no proof of fire," said Sen. Joseph Lieber=
man (D-Conn.), chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, which=
 will examine Enron's collapse at a Jan. 24 hearing.=20
Another Democratic lawmaker, Rep. Henry Waxman of California, on Saturday r=
eleased copies of two e-mail messages Lay sent employees in August. In one,=
 the Enron chairman said: "Our performance has never been stronger; our bus=
iness model has never been more robust." In the other, he detailed an emplo=
yee stock option program that spoke of "a significantly higher price" for E=
nron stock in the future.=20
"It appears that you misled your employees into believing that Enron was pr=
ospering," Waxman, the ranking Democrat on the House Government Reform Comm=
ittee, said in a letter to Lay that the lawmaker also made public.=20
Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, said Saturday that "Ken Lay was telling th=
e truth" in August. He added that only later did the company's financial pr=
oblems become clear.=20
As for Bush-Lay chumminess, Lieberman's tone is as practical as it is diplo=
matic. The fact is, Lay and Enron were working Washington long before Georg=
e W. Bush came to town, and there was plenty of money and influence being s=
pread around both political parties.=20
"One mistake is to think that this all started with the Bush administration=
," said Chuck Lewis, executive director of the Center for Public Integrity,=
 a Washington watchdog group. "They extracted favors from the Clinton admin=
istration and from Congress prior to Bush arriving. These guys are players.=
"=20
Clinton connection=20
Lay was no stranger to the Clinton White House, playing golf with the presi=
dent and staying overnight in the Lincoln Bedroom. Enron hired away Linda R=
obertson, a senior Treasury official in the Clinton administration, to head=
 the firm's Washington office.=20
Enron made a $100,000 contribution in 1997 to the Democratic National Commi=
ttee just days before its representatives accompanied Commerce Secretary Mi=
ckey Kantor on a trade mission to the former Yugoslavia, where Enron hoped =
to win a large contract.=20
Lay contributed $11,000 to former President Bill Clinton during his two cam=
paigns; Vice President Al Gore got $13,750 from Enron in the 2000 election.=
 During Clinton's eight years in office, the company and Lay contributed ab=
out $900,000 to the Democratic Party.=20
That sort of generosity was well-known in fundraising circles in Washington=
 and across the country. In the past 10 years, Enron contributed $5.8 milli=
on to political candidates of all stripes, from former New York Mayor Rudol=
ph Giuliani to Clinton to House Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.).=20
"The name of the game for both Democrats and Republicans is raise as much d=
amn money as possible with no holds barred," said Leon Panetta, Clinton's f=
ormer chief of staff. "And so both sides are going after huge contributors =
that will give largely soft money contributions that are unlimited.=20
"That just means it's an open invitation to companies that want to exert in=
fluence to play that game. And until there are some limits that are placed =
on soft money campaign contributions, what you see happening with Enron is =
going to continue to happen in the future."=20
But no candidate benefited more from Enron than President Bush. First as a =
candidate for governor of Texas and later as a presidential contender, Bush=
 has received $623,000 from Enron since launching his political career in 1=
993.=20
The Center for Responsive Politics, a non-partisan group that tracks money =
and politics, said 73 percent of Enron's contributions in the last decade h=
ave gone to Republicans and 27 percent to Democrats.=20
"It definitely buys access," said Larry Noble, executive director of the gr=
oup and former counsel of the Federal Election Commission. "It gets their p=
hone calls returned. When you make that many contributions and Kenneth Lay =
is a friend of President Bush's, you have to ask very serious questions abo=
ut what that access bought."=20
Enron officials contributed $10,500 to the Bush campaign for legal expenses=
 in the Florida recount. When Bush became president, they donated $300,000 =
for the inaugural celebration.=20
Contributions to lawmakers=20
Though in far smaller amounts, political contributions were given to the ma=
jority of congressional lawmakers.=20
Nearly half of the representatives in the House and three-fourths of the se=
nators received money from Enron executives, according to campaign finance =
reports filed in Washington. Texas lawmakers received the most, with Republ=
ican Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison topping the list with $99,000 in contributio=
ns since 1989.=20
Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft received about $25,000 in Enron contributions duri=
ng his unsuccessful Senate re-election campaign in Missouri. Ashcroft last =
week recused himself from an Enron criminal investigation launched by a Jus=
tice Department task force. The department later disclosed that Ashcroft, w=
hile serving as attorney general, was invited by Lay to speak to a group of=
 chief executive officers about law-enforcement issues.=20
Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) received $21,933 in contributions during the =
same period. He sits on the Senate energy committee. Senate Majority Leader=
 Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) received $6,000.=20
The Enron governmental affairs office in Washington has nearly a dozen empl=
oyees, in addition to contract lobbyists. Telephone calls to that office we=
re not returned late last week.=20
But money was only part of the game. Lay and Enron are clearly more comfort=
able with the Republicans who are now in office, and, until early December,=
 those officials appeared content with Enron.=20
Wendy Gramm, who headed the Commodity Futures Trading Commission under form=
er President George Bush, is a good example. Not only did she once head the=
 agency that regulated some of Enron's trading activities, but she was marr=
ied to Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas), a member of the Senate Banking Committee.=
=20
While at the agency, Wendy Gramm shepherded a commission ruling that exempt=
ed a significant amount of Enron's energy trading from federal oversight. S=
everal weeks later, she left government and was elected to Enron's board.=
=20
In December 2000, with his wife still on Enron's board, Sen. Gramm sponsore=
d the Commodity Futures Modernization Act, which made the exemption law. A =
Gramm spokesman said the senator did not work on that part of the legislati=
on.=20
As an Enron board member, Wendy Gramm sold $277,000 worth of Enron stock in=
 1998, according to the Center for Public Integrity.=20
Senior Bush adviser Karl Rove also held Enron stock worth $100,000 to $250,=
000, but he was required to sell it under government ethics rules.=20
In at least one high-profile instance, an Enron official joined the federal=
 government. Bush's secretary of the Army, Thomas White, had been vice chai=
rman of Enron Energy Services. Bush's nomination of the former brigadier ge=
neral had raised congressional concerns because White had headed Enron's ef=
forts to win federal contracts to run the utilities on military bases.=20
Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), among others, asked White to recuse himself fro=
m the contract-letting process, to which White agreed, though he still favo=
rs the trend toward privatizing such services. White sold about $50 million=
 in Enron shares before the price of the company's stock plummeted.=20
Slew of investigations=20
Three congressional panels, the Justice Department, the General Accounting =
Office, the Department of Labor, and the Securities and Exchange Commission=
 have opened inquiries into Enron's failure and the firm's activities befor=
e its bankruptcy filing. Though the first Senate hearing is less than two w=
eeks away, it will take months, if not several years, to sort through the w=
eb of commodities trading schemes and off-the-books deals that regulators a=
nd congressional leaders say brought on Enron's collapse.=20
A thorough investigation of Enron's market influence likely will reveal a g=
ood bit of the dealmaking that occurred not on trading floors, but in Washi=
ngton offices.=20
"There are so many tentacles to Enron, and so many different elements that =
it could have impacted, that it may take some time to dig out and discover,=
" said Lewis of the Center for Public Integrity. "When they go back and loo=
k at . . . the actual influence over personalities and policies that played=
 out over the last two months, that's when we're going to see exactly what =
Enron got, and what they didn't get."

Enron's oily aftermath

01/13/2002
Chicago Tribune
Chicagoland Final ; C

(Copyright 2002 by the Chicago Tribune)

Enron's corpse is providing evidence of a major financial scandal that will=
 take years to unravel. It took only moments, though, for official Washingt=
on to sniff out the potential for a political scandal.=20
The comparisons to Watergate and Whitewater already are flying: What did Pr=
esident Bush know, and when did he know it?
The answers from the administration are: nothing and never.=20
The White House has revealed that the chairman of Enron, Kenneth Lay, calle=
d two Cabinet members late last year, apparently seeking government help wi=
th the failing company's desperate situation. The administration says that =
no offer of help was given, and that President Bush learned of the calls on=
ly last Thursday.=20
If that's the case, it speaks well of the Bush administration. Lay has been=
 a major contributor to Bush's state and federal campaigns. To hear the adm=
inistration tell it, the big-bucks donor got turned away at the door.=20
That, of course, won't stop the press and members of Congress from sniffing=
 around this, to see if there's more to the story. And well they should. Th=
at's not a slap at Bush's integrity. It's a comment on the fact that in U.S=
. politics, firm denials have a funny history of going soft when exposed to=
 scrutiny.=20
With the facts at hand this is, for now, a financial scandal, not a politic=
al scandal. It involves the stunning collapse of the nation's 7th largest c=
ompany, possible criminal fraud, destroyed documents, and executives cashin=
g in company stock at big profits while the retirement portfolios of Enron =
workers were wiped out.=20
The Justice Department is probing possible crimes leading up to Enron's Dec=
. 2 bankruptcy filing. The Securities and Exchange Commission and Labor Dep=
artment are investigating, as are numerous congressional committees. A floo=
d of shareholder litigation has begun.=20
Last week's stunning revelations provided more fodder for the investigators=
:=20
- Lay called Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Donald =
Evans last fall, as Enron was collapsing. Some reports indicate that Lay, a=
nd Enron President Lawrence Whalley, in a series of phone calls to Treasury=
 officials, sought assistance to stave off bankruptcy. Lay also called Fede=
ral Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan to alert him the company was in a=
 free fall that could impact financial and energy markets.=20
- Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, who also received campaign contributions from E=
nron and Lay, has recused himself from any involvement in the investigation=
. Ashcroft's chief of staff and the entire U.S. Attorney's staff in Houston=
 have also recused themselves because of potential conflicts.=20
- Arthur Andersen revealed that its employees had destroyed a "significant =
but undetermined number" of Enron documents. Employees apparently began del=
eting and shredding in September, before the full extent of Enron's trouble=
s became known, and may have continued even after the SEC began investigati=
ng.=20
- Vice President Dick Cheney or his aides met with Enron executives half a =
dozen times last year when the administration was developing an energy poli=
cy.=20
None of this indicates the administration improperly intervened as Enron he=
aded for bankruptcy. But precisely because the ties that bind this company =
to this administration are so strong, the Bush government must be honest an=
d forthcoming. It is essential that these criminal and civil investigations=
 be thorough, conducted fairly and free from any political influence.=20
Scandals at accounting houses just don't have as much sizzle as scandals at=
 the White House. But that's where this one is focused, and it may well lea=
d to welcome changes that have nothing to do with politics and everything t=
o do with the integrity of the information that investors rely on when judg=
ing a company's stock.=20
The true state of Enron's finances were hidden from its investors because t=
he company and its auditors permitted a series of senior level partnerships=
 that kept hundreds of millions in debt off the books. When the extent of t=
hat deception became clear, Enron's downfall was assured.=20
Did Enron criminally misrepresent its condition by hiding the full extent o=
f these partnerships? Was Arthur Andersen compromised because it received n=
early as much last year from Enron for consulting services ($23 million) as=
 it did in accounting fees ($25 million)?=20
The questions of politics will sort themselves out. The most pressing conce=
rn is that thousands of people lost their retirement savings --and may have=
 been victims of a crime.

Clinton link with Enron lowers the heat on Bush

FINAL

(Copyright 2002 Independent Newspapers (UK) Limited)

The Democrats were dragged into the growing Enron scandal yesterday as it e=
merged that Robert Rubin, Bill Clinton's Treasury Secretary, contacted a to=
p official at his old department to find out if the Bush administration cou=
ld step in to help the energy group.=20
Mr Rubin made his call last November to Peter Fisher, head of the Treasury'=
s domestic finance section, in his current capacity as chairman of Citigrou=
p, one of the main creditors of Enron. A month later the company went bankr=
upt in the biggest financial collapse in modern US history.
Mr Rubin was one of the most admired members of the Clinton team, and his i=
nvolvement will dent Democratic efforts to turn the affair into a new White=
water. "This could be a flu shot for Bush," one observer said. "This could =
inoculate him from the worst of the scandal."=20
The debacle of what was once the seventh largest US corporation has caused =
great embarrassment for the White House because of the close ties of Enron'=
s chief, Kenneth Lay, with President George Bush.=20
Since 1994, the company donated almost $600,000 (pounds 430,000) to the pre=
sident's various campaigns, and helped to cover the costs of both the recou=
nt battle and his inauguration gala. In return the company has had a major =
influence on the Bush energy strategy, successfully pressing for greater de=
regulation.=20
But though three quarters of Enron's $5.8m of political donations since 199=
0 went to Republicans, Democrats too were beneficiaries. The investment pai=
d off when Congress exempted Enron's key energy trading activities from a b=
ill overhauling federal oversight of commodity markets.=20
In his call to the Treasury, Mr Rubin asked Mr Fisher about the possibility=
 of pressing the bond-rating agencies not to lower their estimate of Enron =
bonds - and thus provoke a crisis of confidence in the group. According to =
the Treasury Department yesterday, Mr Fisher opposed the idea. Subsequently=
, agencies did indeed slash their assessment of Enron's creditworthiness, t=
riggering its demise.=20
The latest disclosure capped three days of turmoil. First, details emerged =
of numerous calls by Mr Lay to senior Bush officials last autumn, telling t=
hem of Enron's growing problems. Hours later John Ashcroft, Attorney Genera=
l and thus head of the Justice Department, which is now conducting a crimin=
al probe of Enron, formally took himself out of the case, admitting he had =
taken $60,000 of Enron donations in his failed 2000 campaign to retain his =
Senate seat.=20
But the biggest bombshell was the confession by the Arthur Andersen account=
ing firm, which audits Enron, that it had destroyed many documents relating=
 to the audit. Andersen was already under fierce criticism for failing to d=
etect the private partnerships into which Enron executives had shunted mill=
ions of dollars of debt to keep them off the main balance sheet.

Features - Sunday Comment - They can't pin this on Bush It was Clinton who =
lavished over $4 billion on Enron.
By Mark Steyn.

01/13/2002
The Sunday Telegraph
P24
(c) Telegraph Group Limited, London, 2002

The first time I gave any thought to Enron, the world's biggest energy trad=
er, was during last summer's California blackouts, when the state had a go =
at blaming their woes on the company's chief executive, Ken Lay. "I would l=
ove," said Bill Lockyer, California's Attorney-General, "to personally esco=
rt Lay to an 8 x 10 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says,=
 `Hi, my name is Spike, honey.' "=20
Fortunately for Mr Lay, he lived not in California but in Texas, beyond the=
 reach of Mr Lockyer's summary cell-share programme. And, as Enron itself h=
as now short-circuited, in the largest bankruptcy in US history, Lockyer an=
d his fellow Democrats have moved on. These days, they and their media chum=
s are positively salivating at the prospect of using Enron to do to the Bus=
h Administration what the State of California wanted Spike to do to Mr Lay.=
 On Friday on CNN, in the corner of the screen where of late "AMERICA FIGHT=
S BACK" has been emblazoned, there loomed instead the dread suffix: "ENRONG=
ATE". The New York Times has lapsed into its lethal passive voice: "Questio=
ns were being raised."
The only "question" really being "raised" is: How can we pin this on Bush? =
Short answer: You can't.=20
For those who want to turn a bona fide business scandal into a political on=
e, Ken Lay is supposedly the unacceptable face of Bush capitalism - of a pa=
rticular Texan energy-industry backslapping business culture. The argument =
is that Lay has been writing cheques to Dubya's political campaigns since h=
e first ran for dogcatcher, and that in return he's been rewarded with "acc=
ess". Thus the headline in Friday's Washington Post: "Enron Asked For Help =
>From Cabinet Officials. CEO Sought Intervention Before Bankruptcy."=20
Hmm. I must fish out The Washington Post of November 23, 1963: "President M=
akes Visit To Dallas. JFK Well-Received By Most Texans." The real news in t=
he story is not Lay's phone calls but the officials' response: when Dubya's=
 buddy tried to call in his chits, the Bush guys were unmoved. The headline=
 should have read: "Cabinet Officials Declined To Help Enron. CEO Told, `Aw=
fully Sorry To Hear About All These Problems, Ken. Look, I Gotta Run, But L=
et's Get Together And Do Lunch Sometime Next Year.' "=20
Meanwhile, the Attorney-General, John Ashcroft, has recused himself from th=
e Justice Department investigation on the grounds that he too has been the =
beneficiary of Enron's largesse. At a stroke, Ashcroft sets the bar at a he=
ight the Democrats can't rise to. After all, in terms of their political in=
vestments, Enron had a widely diversified portfolio: 71 of America's 100 Se=
nators got cheques from the company, among them half the Democratic caucus,=
 including Ted Kennedy and Hillary Clinton. If Senators and Representatives=
 are as punctilious about conflict of interest as the Attorney-General, the=
re'll barely be enough of them to man the Congressional hearings.=20
In other words, if this is "another Whitewater", it's a bipartisan one: in =
Monica terms, it's as if, in between oral sex with the President, she was s=
queezing in bondage sessions with Newt Gingrich and rounding out the day la=
pdancing with Strom Thurmond.=20
In so far as anybody did "special favours" for Enron, it wasn't Bush but th=
e Clinton Administration, which lavished over $4 billion in Federal funds o=
n the company.=20
But Bush? Ken Lay must be utterly bewildered: he gives half a mil to his Te=
xas buddy and what does he have to show for it? Nothing, except investigati=
ons by the Justice Department, Commerce Department, Securities and Exchange=
 Commission and eight Congressional committees. Right now, 30 days with Spi=
ke would be a pretty good plea bargain.

The Enron mess continues to grow messier with each passing day. Enron's aud=
itor, Andersen, says its employees destroyed many Enron records. Who is wat=
ching the watch dogs? It's revealed that Ken Lay called Commerce Secretary =
Don Evans and Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, not for help, according to L=
ay, but to alert them to the energy company's problems. O'Neill and Evans s=
ay they never told President Bush about Lay's calls.=20
Enron President Lawrence "Greg" Walley reportedly asked Peter Fisher, the T=
reasury Department's undersecretary for domestic finance, to try to influen=
ce bankers to extend credit to Enron. Fisher never called the bankers, Trea=
sury officials said.
And so it goes, one day after another with new revelations about the energy=

A number of investigations are under way, and a number of politicians, no d=

All of this, plus concerns about the future of remaining and former Enron e=

Announcer: From ABC News, THIS WEEK with Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts. S=
AM DONALDSON, co-host:=20
It burst into the headlines, the collapse of Enron. How the biggest corpora=
te disaster in American history lost billions of dollars, bankrupted thousa=
nds of investors, and forced President Bush to answer questions about his l=
argest contributor, Enron chief Kenneth Lay.
President GEORGE W. BUSH: I have never discussed with Mr. Lay the financial=
 problems of the company.=20
Senator JOSEPH LIEBERMAN (Democrat, Connecticut): The relationship between =
Enron, its executives and the Bush administration is a part of the story.=
=20
DONALDSON: Who made it happen? Who let it happen? And how can the governmen=
t keep it from happening again?=20
Unidentified Man: This hearing will come to order.=20
COKIE ROBERTS, co-host:=20
Our guests from the White House: Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, the Senat=
e's top investigator, Democrat Carl Levin, shareholder advocate William Ler=
ach and former Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt.=
=20
Announcer: That's THIS WEEK featuring George Will and George Stephanopoulos=
. Now Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts.=20
ROBERTS: Welcome to the program. Today we've decided to devote the entire b=
roadcast to a single subject: the collapse of Enron. With criminal, Congres=
sional and regulatory investigations all under a political overlay, Enron's=
 troubles have taken center stage here in Washington. Sam:=20
DONALDSON: Absolutely, Cokie. Just a year ago, Enron, the giant Houston-bas=
ed energy company that traded natural gas contracts, marketed electricity a=
nd other commodities, was riding high. The seventh-largest corporation in t=
he country, its stock hitting $83 a share, its revenues $100 billion a year=
. But as the months went by, things began to fall apart. A huge debt was mo=
unting out of public view. The stock price fell, and in desperation, top En=
ron officials reached out to the Bush administration last fall for help. Af=
ter all, Enron and its officers had been the single biggest contributor to =
Bush political campaigns. Administration officials say they did nothing to =
help, and on December 2nd, Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection=
, wiping out an estimated $60 billion of stockholder investment and approxi=
mately $1.3 billion of employee retirement savings.=20
In the wake of this debacle, investigations are planned by the Justice Depa=
rtment, the Labor Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and fi=
ve different Congressional committees, all spurred on by last week's bombsh=
ell admission by the accounting firm of Arthur Andersen that its Houston em=
ployees have shredded documents relating to its audits of Enron. For its pa=
rt, Enron says it will cooperate with investigations and warns the public a=
gainst allowing the scandal machine to take over spreading unsupported spec=
ulation. Enron's embattled chief executive, Kenneth Lay, blames what happen=
ed on the recession.=20
Mr. KENNETH LAY (Chief Executive Officer, Enron): Many companies in 2002 ar=
e undergoing the difficult but cleansing effects of the current economic do=
wnturn. Enron itself has been a casualty of these events and many other eve=
nts. For this consequence, I am deeply saddened.=20
DONALDSON: Inevitably, Enron's collapse has resulted, as Cokie says, in pol=
itical battle lines being drawn here in Washington. Our chief White House c=
orrespondent Terry Moran has the latest on that. Terry:=20
TERRY MORAN reporting:=20
Well, Sam, those investigations you mentioned are certainly heating up. The=
 latest development: this six-page letter from Representative Henry Waxman.=
 He's the ranking Democrat on the House Government Reform Committee. It's a=
 letter to Treasury Secretary O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Evans, and it =
can fairly be categorized as a blanket request for information and document=
ation by the two men's contacts with Enron. All this comes as the shock wav=
es from Enron's collapse continue to reverberate in both political parties =
this weekend.=20
(VO) On Friday, the Bush administration disclosed that Energy Secretary Spe=
ncer Abraham called Enron chairman Ken Lay last November 2nd to ask about t=
he company's situation. And former Clinton administration secretary, Robert=
 Rubin, spoke yesterday for the first time about this November 8th phone ca=
ll to Treasury Undersecretary Peter Fisher, seeking help in propping up Enr=
on's credit rating.=20
Yesterday Rubin told ABC News: "I called Peter and said, `I think it is pro=
bably not a good idea. On the other hand, this is a national economic issue=
.'=20
Pres. BUSH: In light of the most recent bankruptcy, Enron, there needs to b=
e a full review.=20
MORAN: (VO) The political storm broke Thursday morning at an Oval Office me=
eting with his economic team to announce administration action on the Enron=
 collapse. President Bush was asked about his relationship with Ken Lay.=20
Pres. BUSH: Ken Lay is a supporter, and I got to know Ken Lay when he was t=
he head of the--what they call, the Governor's Business Council in Texas. H=
e was a supporter of Anne Richards in my run in 1994.=20
MORAN: (VO) Democrats say that answer understates how close Mr. Bush has be=
en over the years with Enron's founder.=20
Democrats are also looking at phone calls from Lay to Commerce Secretary Do=
n Evans and to Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill last fall as Enron neared co=
llapse. Lay was looking for help.=20
Mr. ARI FLEISCHER (White House Press Secretary): Secretary Evans talked to =
Secretary O'Neill and they agreed that no action should be taken.=20
MORAN: (VO) At the same time, Enron President Lawrence Greg Whalley called =
Treasury Undersecretary Fisher six or eight times, asking Fisher to interve=
ne with Enron's bankers. As he did with Rubin's request, Fisher declined.=
=20
The flurry of calls and years of political contributions have some Democrat=
s in the mood for a major investigation.=20
Sen. LIEBERMAN: This series of contacts between the highest official of Enr=
on and the Bush administration is a source of concern.=20
MORAN: The main investigation so far is the nationwide criminal probe launc=
hed by the Justice Department. But in a sign of just how complicated this s=
ituation is for the administration, the attorney general, John Ashcroft, wi=
ll not be leading that probe. He has recused himself because his campaign c=
ommittees in his 2002 Senate rate--race took more than $50,000 from Enron. =
And finally, Newsweek has added some details to an October 15th call betwee=
n Ken Lay and Commerce Secretary Evans. Evans was in Moscow at the time. Th=
e key information there is the date, October 15th. The next day, Enron anno=
unced a stunning, more than $500 million loss that led to its collapse. Sam=
:=20
DONALDSON: Thank you, Terry.=20
Joining us now from Pittsburgh is the secretary of the treasury, Paul O'Nei=
ll.=20
Welcome, Mr. Secretary.=20
Mr. PAUL O'NEILL (Treasury Secretary): Good morning.=20
DONALDSON: Well, on October 28th, which was a Sunday--I presume you were at=
 home--Kenneth Lay...=20
Mr. O'NEILL: I was.=20
DONALDSON: ...Enron's CEO called you. What did he want?=20
Mr. O'NEILL: He called to tell me that he thought it would be useful for hi=
s technical people to talk to our technical people so that we could assure =
ourselves that the problems they were having were not going to cause disloc=
ations in the US and world capital markets.=20
DONALDSON: Did he specifically bring up Long-Term Capital Management, which=
 was a company that had a--help from government in a financial bailout?=20
Mr. O'NEILL: Well, first, let--let me correct what you just said. As I reca=
ll, Long-Term Capital didn't get any assistance from the government at all.=
 The New York Fed, I believe, called together the major banks that were inv=
olved with Long-Term Capital, and the major banks decided to take some acti=
on to avert a problem in the US capital market. So I think Long-Term Cap--h=
e mit--he mit--I think he may...=20
DONALDSON: It did--excuse me, Mr. Secretary. It did not get any direct gove=
rnment subsidy, but government officials...=20
Mr. O'NEILL: Right.=20
DONALDSON: ...helped organize a bailout. And did he not bring that up?=20
Mr. O'NEILL: I--as I recall, he mentioned that we should pay attention to t=
he technical details because the technical problems could well be of the na=
ture of Long-Term Capital.=20
DONALDSON: All right. Now, you then subsequently--according to what you've =
already said--called Peter Fisher, the undersecretary, and asked him to loo=
k into it. Is that correct?=20
Mr. O'NEILL: I did, yes.=20
DONALDSON: And did he do so?=20
Mr. O'NEILL: Yes, he did. And he came back to me and said he didn't think t=
here were parallels, that he was talking with people in the capital markets=
, and it didn't look like it would cause problems at other places.=20
DONALDSON: Well, now, the president of Enron, Peter--rather, Lawrence Greg =
Whalley, called Fisher six or eight times. Which is it?=20
Mr. O'NEILL: Well, I honestly don't know. You know, as I've been watching t=
his the last few days, I've been surprised to see--I didn't know there were=
 six or eight calls. I knew that Peter was in touch with the president of E=
nron, and I didn't know unti--frankly, until I saw it on the news that Bob =
Rubin had called Peter as well. So, you know..=20
DONALDSON: What do you--what do you think of former Secretary Rubin's call?=
 Was that proper?=20
Mr. O'NEILL: Well, you know, when I left Washington the last time, I--I wen=
t to New York and I made a deliberate decision that I was not going to trad=
e on what I knew about the government and people that I knew in the governm=
ent. And--and so, for me, I never would have made such a call. But Secretar=
y Rubin, I think, did a great job when he was in the government. He'd gone =
on to be a very high-level official at Citigroup. And--and, you know, I--I-=
-I think, at face value, Secretary Rubin's involvement, that he felt it was=
 appropriate for him to make that call. And, you know, I'll let other peopl=
e decide that. But I--you know, the whole idea of finding fault and--and--a=
nd--and other things in--in what I would consider to be kind of normal busi=
ness of people calling when there are problems like this, you know, making =
a big deal out of it, I--I--I just don't understand it.=20
DONALDSON: But--but you would not have made that call? That's what you told=
 me.=20
Mr. O'NEILL: Well, you know, because I decided when I left Washington, I wa=
s done with Washington.=20
DONALDSON: All right. Now, the spokesman--the spokesperson for the Treasury=
 Department, Michelle Davis, said--and let me just take a look at what she =
said--that Treasury Undersecretary Peter Fisher inferred he, meaning Kennet=
h--meaning Whalley, was being asked to encourage the banks to extend credit=
 to Enron lenders. Do you agree with that?=20
Mr. O'NEILL: I don't know. You--you have to rely on what Peter and Michelle=
 have said about this.=20
DONALDSON: Well, didn't he discuss it with you, Mr. Secretary? Do you mean.=
..=20
Mr. O'NEILL: He didn't. Never, no.=20
DONALDSON: All during this time, you asked him to look into it, and he--he =
didn't discuss it with you?=20
Mr. O'NEILL: Well, he just came back to me and said that he couldn't find a=
ny evidence that it was going to be a problem. You know, Sam, I think it he=
lps to put these things in context. You know, the call I had from Ken Lay w=
as three or four minutes. At the same time, I'm working on prosecuting the =
financial war on terrorism and putting together World Wide Web to--to inter=
dict and confiscate the money the terrorists have used to do things like Se=
ptember the 11th. At that time, I was working very hard trying to get the C=
ongress to pass a stimulus bill to help people who were affected by Septemb=
er 11th, slow down the economy, trying to get the Congress to pass a terror=
ist risk insurance bill, working on the problems of Argentina and Turkey an=
d other places around the world that have got problems. You know, this is a=
 three or four-minute telephone call...=20
DONALDSON: All right.=20
Mr. O'NEILL: ...and--and what I got from Ken Lay was no more than what I al=
ready read and--in the newspaper and seen on--on your and other television =
shows saying Enron was having problems.=20
DONALDSON: All right. Granted, lots on your plate, Mr. Secretary. But on No=
vember 8th, he called again. Did you make that call or did you place the ca=
ll?=20
Mr. O'NEILL: No, he called me.=20
DONALDSON: What did he want?=20
Mr. O'NEILL: He called me to tell me that they were deep into conversations=
 with Dynergy, another energy company, and that sustaining their credit rat=
ing was--was a critical aspect of their deal. It was an information call. H=
e asked me for nothing.=20
DONALDSON: He asked you for nothing. You know, Bob Bennett, who is now Enro=
n's attorney here in Washington, says, and I quote, that Whalley told Fishe=
r, "It would be nice if you could get these banks to lend us some money, bu=
t I should tell you our credit is not good." Bennett said that Whalley then=
 laughed, meaning that that was a joke. It doesn't sound like a joke to a l=
ot of people.=20
Mr. O'NEILL: Well, what would you have me make of that, Sam?=20
DONALDSON: Well, I'm asking you. I mean, you...=20
Mr. O'NEILL: I'm--what--what are you asking me?=20
DONALDSON: Well, I'm asking you, if it does not appear from these separate =
little pieces that I've just read, that your own spokesperson says that Fis=
her inferred that he was being asked to do something. Then it says...=20
Mr. O'NEILL: OK, well, perhaps--perhaps so, but nothing was done.=20
DONALDSON: All right, nothing was done.=20
Mr. O'NEILL: What does--what does that tell you? I think it tells you we we=
re doing the diligent thing to make sure that the world and US capital mark=
ets didn't get damaged, and we had no responsibility to help an individual,=
 private firm and we didn't.=20
DONALDSON: Well, I want to show you what Enron spokesperson Mark Palmer has=
 said about all of these calls, and not only to you but to Don Evans. He sa=
id, "At no time did Lay ask for any assistance from the government, nor did=
 he intend to leave any impression that he was ask--asking for assistance."=
 We've had what you've had to say, but, of course, Don Evans says flatly th=
at he was asked to help out on the Moody's Investment Service. So that stat=
ement isn't correct, is it?=20
Mr. O'NEILL: You know, you can draw your own conclusions. Ken Lay didn't as=
k me to do anything, and, you know, there--we did nothing. I think we did t=
he right thing. We made sure that in our area of responsibility, which is t=
he US and the world capital markets, that the problems that were occurring =
at Enron had no spillover effect for the rest of the economy.=20
DONALDSON: Mr. Secretary...=20
Mr. O'NEILL: But, you know what the president has charged me to do now is t=
o look at these events and see if there are necessary changes in the rules =
to protect individual employees and to protect investors, to see if there a=
re weaknesses in the rules that we should correct, because the president's =
really concerned as he sees these stories about people losing their 401k pl=
ans, savings, and--and--and--and as a special concern, he wants to make sur=
e that disclosures are appropriate so that investors are not misled or...=
=20
DONALDSON: Mr. Secretary, I think a lot of people think that's a good idea,=
 of what the president has asked you to do. But coming back to what has hap=
pened, when you knew, no matter how long the phone calls were, that this bi=
g company was in deep, deep trouble, didn't you feel an obligation to tell =
the public so that the stockholders...=20
Mr. O'NEILL: Sam--Sam, you and your other friends in the print media were t=
elling the people every day, I didn't learn anything from Ken Lay that wasn=
't public property.=20
DONALDSON: So you don't think that the secretary of the treasury and the se=
cretary of the commerce, if they had spoken out, wouldn't admit more to inv=
estors and employees than a newspaper story?=20
Mr. O'NEILL: Well, I--you know, I don't think so. Would you have had me say=
 something as I watched LTV Steel going down? Should I have gotten on top o=
f the building and said, `LTV is going down.' I don't think--that's not the=
 role of government officials to call attention to the things that are al--=
already being recorded in the media in--in a very--in a very strong way. I =
didn't know anything that you didn't know.=20
DONALDSON: All right, Mr. Secretary. Finally, I'm told that you didn't info=
rm the president until last Thursday.=20
Mr. O'NEILL: Right. That's true.=20
DONALDSON: Wouldn't it have been better to give him a head's up...=20
Mr. O'NEILL: I didn't--I...=20
DONALDSON: ...because of this political problem that's coming, was one that=
 could have been foreseen.=20
Mr. O'NEILL: I--well, frankly, I don't think so. You know, I get lots of ca=
lls from lots of people in big and small companies, and governments around =
the world. You know, do I run across the street every time I've had a telep=
hone call with, say, the finance minister in Argentina and tell the preside=
nt? Absolutely not. Why would I do that? I'm a big boy. I've got responsibi=
lity. I swore to uphold the laws and--and--and--and constitutional duties o=
f the United States, and I'm going to keep doing that. And--and--and I'm no=
t going to spend, you know, endless hours running across the street telling=
 the president about telephone calls.=20
DONALDSON: Secretary O'Neill, thank you very much for joining us this morni=
ng.=20
Mr. O'NEILL: You're welcome.=20
DONALDSON: It's always good to see you.=20
Mr. O'NEILL: Nice to see you, too.=20
DONALDSON: Cokie:=20
ROBERTS: Joining us now from New York is Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Mi=
chigan. He's chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations which=
 will be holding hearings into the whole Enron situation.=20
Thanks for being with us, Senator Levin.=20
Senator CARL LEVIN (Democrat, Michigan): Good being with you, Cokie.=20
ROBERTS: Now, starting with these phone calls that Sam and--and the secreta=
ry were talking about, were those calls proper? Should Ken Lay have been ca=
lling these Cabinet secretaries?=20
Sen. LEVIN: Well, it depends on what he said. I have no doubt they were ask=
ing for the government to take action. I think when Ken Lay denies it and o=
ther representatives of Enron deny that they were asking for things, I thin=
k that is a--just false. It's as false as some of their financial statement=
s. As a matter of fact, I don't believe that for one minute. But I do accep=
t when Secretary O'Neill says that nothing was done in response to those re=
quests, and I have no doubt, again, that there were requests made. And I ju=
st don't believe Enron on that, but I do believe Secretary O'Neill when he =
says that no action was taken.=20
ROBERTS: Should the secretaries have informed the regulators? Forget about =
the public, as he said, there were newspaper stories out there, but should =
they have informed the SEC of these conversations?=20
Sen. LEVIN: Well, I don't know what the requirements are there. The SEC, of=
 course, had already been involved in this matter, as they should have been=
. But what we're focusing on at the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigation=
s, is--are the deceptive practices of Enron, and the failure of the auditor=
s, Arthur Andersen, to try to block those deceptive practices, to say no--t=
he failure of the board of Enron--to say no to the deceptive practices whic=
h cost the employees their jobs, their future retirements, which cost thous=
ands--tens of thousands of stockholders to go under with this stock. And--a=
nd that's what we're focusing on. And there's a lot there to be investigate=
d. Let me tell you, what Enron did here was to use outside entities in orde=
r to deceive the public and to increase the value of their stock.=20
ROBERTS: All right.=20
Sen. LEVIN: These were not accounting errors, by the way, these just weren'=
t errors...=20
ROBERTS: These partnerships you're talking about...=20
Sen. LEVIN: ...these were outside partnerships.=20
ROBERTS: But Senator, you--you heard earlier in the broadcast, your colleag=
ue Senator Lieberman saying that the relationship between Enron and the adm=
inistration, the fact that Ken Lay has been the biggest contributor to the =
administration, is an area of concern. Is that something that you will be l=
ooking into?=20
Sen. LEVIN: Yeah, campaign contributions are a major concern, but it's not =
the concern of our investigation. It's the concern of what we're trying to =
do in Congress, to pass campaign finance reform to put a ban on these big c=
ontributions by corporations. Corporations are not supposed to give any mon=
ey at all to campaigns, and yet because of that loophole, as you well know,=
 tens of thousand, hundreds of thousands of dollars went from Enron to the =
political parties, both political parties, and that's what we've got to put=
 an end to to stop these kind of appearances of impropriety that are create=
d, and the sale of access. I have no doubt that Enron had greater access be=
cause of huge campaign contributions.=20
ROBERTS: Greater access to Cabinet secretaries and to White--White House st=
aff and secretar--and Vice President Cheney?=20
Sen. LEVIN: I have no doubt that they had greater access, not just to the a=
dministration, but to members of Congress because of huge campaign contribu=
tions, and that's what we've got to end.=20
ROBERTS: Now...=20
Sen. LEVIN: But it's the actions of Enron, the improprieties, the false sta=
tements. They were selling glass as real diamonds, and that is false. We've=
 got to put an end to it. That is the major concern of my subcommittee. And=
 that is what, it seems to me, the American people want us to focus on.=20
ROBERTS: Now, Congressman Waxman from California has sent letters to the se=
cretaries asking for all of the documents, all of the meetings, any--any co=
ntacts at all between the administration and--and Enron. And implying that =
maybe--that even though Enron didn't seem to get energy policy changed to s=
uit it, but maybe the administration was advocating a tax policy that would=
 be helpful to Enron at the time that all these contacts were taking place.=
 What's your reaction to that?=20
Sen. LEVIN: Well, I think it's appropriate to ask for all that material. Ou=
r 51 subpoenas, which we requested this--which we issued this week and have=
 now been served, are the subpoenas to Enron, its board, its managers, to A=
rthur Andersen for all the documents involved in the creation of these enti=
ties and in terms of any stocks sales and option sales. That's what we're f=
ocusing on are the failures of this corporation, the deceptive practices of=
 this corporation and the failures of its auditors and board that are suppo=
sed to be a check on manager--managers to be a check on managers. That's wh=
at our focus is on.=20
ROBERTS: Do you see a change in the laws coming as a result of this? Re-reg=
ulation of energy, for instance?=20
Sen. LEVIN: Well, I'm not sure about the re-regulation of energy, but I am =
confident that in terms of the practices of boards and auditors that we hav=
e got to tighten up the law significantly. We have to be able to rely on bo=
ard members and on auditors to carry out their fiduciary duties. And that--=
those duties mean that a corporation is supposed to be in business for its =
stockholders and not for its managers.=20
ROBERTS: Of course...=20
Sen. LEVIN: Managers here line their pockets with--with hundreds of million=
s of dollars of stock sales at the same time a corporation was going under,=
 and the stockholders and employees were left holding the bag.=20
ROBERTS: Now...=20
Sen. LEVIN: I think we've got to tighten the laws.=20
ROBERTS: One of those..=20
Sen. LEVIN: I'm sure the tightening will come as a result of these hearings=
.=20
ROBERTS: One of those board members was Wendy Gramm, the wife of Senator Ph=
il Gramm of Texas. And--and Senator Gramm appears to have, in one of those =
late-night end-of-session moves, been the person who was successful in gett=
ing the--the Commodities Futures Trading Commission to exempt Enron from it=
s oversight. I know it's uncomfortable for senators to look at other senato=
r's actions, but is this part of the scope of your investigation?=20
Sen. LEVIN: The scope of the board is surely part of our investigation, the=
 activities of the board, all members, including Wendy Gramm. I don't know =
whether or not--I think that Senator Gramm has denied, as a matter of fact,=
 that that amendment that was added was added by him. So I don't even know =
that it's accurate that he was the one that added that amendment. But in an=
y event, as I understand the background for that now--and again, as you poi=
nt out, it was not a subject of the vote of the Senate--but as I understand=
 now, that had broader application than just Enron. But I--I'm not sure of =
the details of that, because that's not the focus of my investigation. Othe=
rs will be looking into other activities and other pieces of this puzzle.=
=20
ROBERTS: Senator, I--we're out of time, but I know that you are looking at =
the company. But there are a lot of Democrats licking their lips over this =
at the moment, and seeing an--an opportunity to get at the Bush administrat=
ion. Do you think there's a danger for Democrats here?=20
Sen. LEVIN: Well, I think if anyone is doing that, they're making a mistake=
. I think the public has been burnt here. Democrats, Republicans and indepe=
ndents have been hurt. And it's our obligation, on a nonpartisan basis, to =
go after Enron, to go after its auditors, to go after board members, to loo=
k for improprieties here, to tighten the law. That is our responsibility. W=
e're going to do it on a bipartisan basis. We have the support in our inves=
tigation of my ranking Republican, Senator Collins. I know that Senator Lie=
berman has the support of Senator Thompson in the broader investigation of =
the full committee. So this is going to be a bipartisan investigation, as i=
t should be.=20
ROBERTS: Thank you very much, Senator Carl Levin.=20
Sen. LEVIN: Thank you, Cokie.=20
ROBERTS: Still ahead, who was to blame for the fall of Enron? But first, wh=
en we come back, those hurt most by its demise: the employees and other inv=
estors who lost hundreds of millions of dollars. Stay with us.=20
Announcer: THIS WEEK with Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts brought to you by=
...=20
(Commercial break)=20
DONALDSON: As we heard earlier, Enron chief Kenneth Lay blames his company'=
s collapse on the recession. Well, a lot of people think other factors, inc=
luding some that may result in criminal charges, are to blame. Our chief Ca=
pitol Hill correspondent Linda Douglass takes a closer look. Linda:=20
LINDA DOUGLASS reporting:=20
And Sam, one of the big questions is: Was there insider trading when the to=
p officials sold their stock when the stock was up? The people who were har=
dest hit by this, of course, were the employees. They were stripped of thei=
r jobs and they were robbed of their retirement savings.=20
Offscreen Voice: We're going to investigate that.=20
DOUGLASS: (VO) Sixty-four-year-old Janice Farmer had begun living off her r=
etirement fund when suddenly it vanished.=20
Ms. JANICE FARMER (Former Enron Employee): I trusted the management of Enro=
n with my life savings. Senators, I won't mince words here, they betrayed t=
hat trust.=20
DOUGLASS: (VO) Enron's employees had put their money into company-run 401ks=
, made up mostly of Enron's stock. When employees begun suspecting trouble =
in the company last summer, they worried about their stock. CEO Ken Lay rea=
ssured them in a e-mail, saying: "Our performance has never been stronger. =
Our business model has never been more robust. Our growth has never been mo=
re certain."=20
In mid-October, Enron finally revealed it was losing money. But panicked em=
ployees were told that because the company was in a transition period, they=
 would not be allowed to sell their stock. Many Enron officials had made a =
billion dollars selling their own stock months before.=20
Senator RON WYDEN (Democrat, Oregon): Enron was just sinking like the Titan=
ic, and you've got the top officers up on the deck selling the shares and a=
ll of you are locked in the boiler room, not able to get rid of the stock.=
=20
DOUGLASS: (VO) There were other victims: big pension funds which held Enron=
's stock. Florida's lost $325 million, Ohio's lost $59 million, California'=
s lost $45 million, New York's lost $58 million. And small investors whose =
brokers kept telling them Enron was hot. Widow Mary Bain Pearson lost $175,=
000.=20
Ms. MARY BAIN PEARSON (Enron Shareholder): I'm just a pebble in the stream.=
 A little bitty shareholder. I didn't lose millions, I didn't even lose a b=
illion. But what I did lose seems like a billion to me.=20
DOUGLASS: The employees and the shareholders have filed separate lawsuits t=
rying to recover some of what they've lost. But it is not clear at all wher=
e Enron would get the money to pay those claims if they should win in court=
, Sam.=20
DONALDSON: Thank you, Linda.=20
Yes, more than 60 lawsuits have already been filed in an attempt to recover=
 money lost by investors and Enron employees. But most of these suits have =
been put on hold by Enron's bankruptcy filing. One of them, however, a clas=
s action suit titled Amalgamated Bank vs. Kenneth Lay, is ongoing since it =
is directed at Enron officials and board members rather than the company it=
self. And joining us now is the lead attorney in this suit, Bill Lerach.=20
Welcome, Mr. Lerach.=20
Mr. WILLIAM LERACH (Shareholder Advocate): Good morning. Thank you.=20
DONALDSON: Company's go belly-up in capitalism all the time. What did Enron=
 do wrong?=20
Mr. LERACH: Well, Enron did a great many things wrong. But most importantly=
, Enron falsified its financial statements, reporting over $600 million in =
phony profits and over a billion dollars of phony stockholder equity over a=
 four-year period while the top insiders in that company were selling off $=
1.1 billion of their stock. We think this is one of the most massive securi=
ty frauds we have ever encountered.=20
DONALDSON: Well, now, a federal judge has now agreed that she the authority=
 to freeze these assets of the officials that you are suing, but she says y=
ou have yet to make your case that she should do that.=20
Mr. LERACH: We haven't had an opportunity yet to trace where the money is, =
whether it's offshore in the Cayman Islands or it's been used to buy yachts=
 or whatever. We're going to be doing that, we hope, with the judge's permi=
ssion in the next few weeks. And I think if we find any significant amount =
of that money is in danger of being secreted or dissipated, I think the fed=
eral court will take appropriate action to freeze it.=20
DONALDSON: Well, let's look at just three of these 29 Enron officials, or f=
ormer officials, and some of their sales. And I want to ask you about it.=
=20
TEXT:=20
ENRON EXECUTIVE STOCK SALES=20
Stock sales from 10/19/98 to 11/27/01=20
Total shares Value sold Kenneth Lay 1.8 mil $101 mil Jeff Skilling 1.1 mil =
$66.9 mil Wendy Gramm 10,256 $276,912=20
Source: Amalgamated Bank v. Kenneth L Lay=20
DONALDSON: Kenneth Lay, the chief executive, from 1998 to last year, during=
 the period that you are suing for, sold stock worth $101 million. Jeff Ski=
lling, the former CEO sold stock worth $66.9 million. And Wendy Gramm, a bo=
ard member, sold stock worth $276,912. But Mr. Lay says he only sold 24 per=
cent of his holdings. He has lost most of his holdings along with anyone--e=
verything else. And Wendy Gramm says she sold hers in 1998, long before any=
 suggestion of this funny wrongdoing came to light. Why is it fair to go af=
ter them?=20
Mr. LERACH: Well, first of all, Mr. Lay only paid pennies a share for his s=
tock. His stock was stock option stock. So it's wrong to say that he lost m=
oney when the stock collapsed because he didn't pay the inflated price for =
his stock that ordinary investors did. And you have to look past the playin=
g with the percentages. A hundred and one million dollars of stock by a CEO=
 or chairman of a company is a huge bailout, especially when it's compared =
to what's happening to the workers inside the company who are losing everyt=
hing and who aren't on the inside knowing the profits have been falsified a=
nd the company is failing.=20
DONALDSON: You're suing for $25 billion, and I know that Arthur Andersen is=
 also part of the suit. Where do you think you can get that money?=20
Mr. LERACH: Well, Arthur Andersen is a large company. They have the wherewi=
thal to respond. In addition, there's directors' and officers' liability in=
surance running to the hundreds of millions. And, I must tell you, Sam, not=
 all the defendants have been named yet. This case is going to continue to =
evolve and expand. There are other professionals, lawyers, investment banke=
rs and the like who appear to be deeply implicated. A fraud of this scope a=
nd size simply cannot be perpetrated without the assistance of sophisticate=
d professionals to get stuff ba--past the regulators.=20
DONALDSON: Are you going to name any politicians?=20
Mr. LERACH: No, I didn't think we're naming politicians as such as defendan=
ts. We're not concerned with the politics of the case, we're concerned with=
 the economics of the case.=20
DONALDSON: Knowing what you know now, do you think people will eventually g=
o to jail here?=20
Mr. LERACH: It's dangerous to speculate, but the fraud here appears to be v=
ery substantial. It must have been deliberate. I don't like to see anyone g=
o to jail, but there has to be accountability in the system so that this ki=
nd of thing won't continue to happen. If there's not accountability for tho=
se who perpetrate it, then it will happen again and again.=20
DONALDSON: Mr. Lerach, thanks very much for joining us today.=20
Mr. LERACH: Thank you, Sam.=20
DONALDSON: When we come back, how did this happen? We'll examine the role o=
f Enron's management, its accountants and government regulators. And then G=
eorge Stephanopoulos will speak with the former Securities and Exchange Com=
mission chairman, Arthur Levitt, right after this.=20
(Commercial break)=20
GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS reporting:=20
We've seen that both Enron and Arthur Andersen will be playing defense in t=
he courts, but Congress will also be asking who else is to blame. Here's Li=
nda Douglass again with more on the blame game.=20
DOUGLASS: George, everyone is trying to figure out who is to blame for the =
collapse of Enron. Was it the government regulators? Was it the accountants=
? Was it the stock analysts? Was it the Enron officials cutting too many co=
rners as they tried to get rich?=20
(VO) Enron reeked of success. Its revenues had tripled in three years, maki=
ng it the seventh largest company on the Fortune 500. Brokers urged investo=
rs to, `Buy! Buy!' even though most did not really understand how the compl=
ex energy trading company made its money.=20
Mr. PATRICK McGURN (Institutional Shareholder Services): The company was su=
ch a good performer that people really weren't willing to say that the empe=
ror potentially didn't have any clothes on.=20
DOUGLASS: (VO) Turns out Enron was built on a house of cards. It hid its de=
bt by shifting it to mysterious partnerships, some of which were run by top=
 Enron officials, such as Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow who made $3=
0 million in the process.=20
In November, Enron was forced to admit it that it had overstated its profit=
s by half a billion dollars. Did Enron's accountant, Arthur Andersen, help =
the company cover up a lie?=20
Sen. LIEBERMAN: Why did the Enron's auditors allow the company to overstate=
 its profits for four years using what appear now to be very questionable a=
ccounting practices?=20
DOUGLASS: (VO) Enron was paying Andersen a million dollars a week to be a c=
onsultant and to audit its books. The SEC permits such arrangements, which =
some call a conflict of interest. Andersen now admits that some of its empl=
oyees destroyed Enron documents which could be crucial to the investigation=
.=20
(OC) Now, the Enron employees are also, again, the victims. Their 401ks wen=
t up in smoke, and many people say that's because 60 percent of those retir=
ement funds were made up of Enron stock. Some in Congress are now saying th=
at the percentage of company stock that should allowed in a 401k should onl=
y be 20 percent. George:=20
STEPHANOPOULOS: Thanks, Linda.=20
And now we're going to turn to someone who's an expert on all these issues.=
 Arthur Levitt was chairman of Securities Exchange Commission from 1993 to =
early 2001, and he joins us now from Santa Monica, California.=20
Good morning, Mr. Levitt.=20
Mr. ARTHUR LEVITT (Former Chairman, Securities & Exchange Commission): Good=
 morning, George.=20
STEPHANOPOULOS: Mr. Levitt, I think a lot of people are wondering if the SE=
C should bear some of the blame. When--when 29 top officials of a corporati=
on sell off $1.1 billion in stock--nearly half their holdings--shouldn't al=
arm bells go off at the SEC?=20
Mr. LEVITT: The SEC bases its security regulation not on merit regulation b=
ut on full disclosure. It's interesting, the issues that brought about the =
Enron debacle could have occurred in almost any other corporation, and some=
 of the people now who are calling for reforms were the very same people wh=
o frustrated the SEC in our efforts to get full disclosure, in our efforts =
to get the accounting industry to have some semblance of auditor independen=
ce.=20
STEPHANOPOULOS: But--but these sales were disclosed, were they not?=20
Mr. LEVITT: The sales were disclosed, but the blame here falls on a whole h=
ost of factors. It's not just the auditors, it's the security analysts, it'=
s the rating agencies that dropped the ball, it's the investment bankers wh=
o cooked up the scheme to hide matters from the general public. And I think=
 this is a time we've got to take a look at how standards are set. This has=
 been a long-standing battle that the Commission has had to fight, and we'v=
e been frustrated by the business community and their impact on the Congres=
s to dissuade these standards-setters from doing the job they should be doi=
ng.=20
STEPHANOPOULOS: Mr. Levitt, Secretary O'Neill was on this phone--was on thi=
s program earlier. When he got those phone calls from Ken Lay, do you belie=
ve he had an obligation to call the SEC chairman?=20
Mr. LEVITT: I'm not sure whether it's an obligation, but historically when =
there have been economic problems of this kind--Long-Term Capital, for inst=
ance--or any of the other events that occurred while I was there--Alan Gree=
nspan and Lloyd Benson and Bob Rubin always communicated with--with me so t=
hat we were aware of the problem at the same time and could do something ab=
out it.=20
STEPHANOPOULOS: So it would have been a good idea?=20
Mr. LEVITT: It just happened during--during my years.=20
STEPHANOPOULOS: This--this whole episode is over real serious problems in t=
he accounting industry. Arthur Andersen just this weekend revealed that the=
y shredded documents related to the Enron case, maybe even after the SEC in=
vestigation began. That's a crime, isn't it?=20
Mr. LEVITT: I think it is. I think it is a violation of our securities laws=
, and it's highly unusual, at best. Arthur Andersen was one of three firms =
that fought the commission on this issue of auditor independence about a ye=
ar ago.=20
STEPHANOPOULOS: Now, this is the latest in a series of problems for Arthur =
Andersen. They paid millions of dollars in fines for the Waste Management c=
ase, the Sunbeam case. Do you think they can survive this third strike?=20
Mr. LEVITT: Well, that's very difficult to tell. I--I'm simply not sure. I =
think it's easy to look at this in a vacuum and say this will kill the firm=
. But I think it's premature to say that. They've got a real problem. But a=
s I've said before, this could happen in other American corporations. And I=
 think we've got to take a new look at the way standards are set, in the wa=
y the accounting industry is overseen, in the way rules are formulated in t=
he business community.=20
STEPHANOPOULOS: Does that mean independent boards and banning accounting fi=
rms from being both consultants and auditors?=20
Mr. LEVITT: Not necessarily a blanket ban but it does mean the appointment,=
 in my judgment, of an independent group to oversee the accountants. But mo=
re than that, I think it calls for a new look at the way America's boards a=
re constructed. I think that we should have a majority of members of a boar=
d come from the public, rather than from within the corporations. And the a=
udit committee should be empowered to prevent this kind of occurrence from =
happening by having to approve any consulting contract that is given to the=
 auditor before it is awarded to the auditor.=20
STEPHANOPOULOS: OK, Mr. Levitt, thank you very much.=20
Mr. LEVITT: OK, George.=20
STEPHANOPOULOS: When we come back, the ROUNDTABLE weighs in on Enron. Georg=
e Will joins us after this.=20
(Commercial break)=20
Announcer: THIS WEEK with Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts will continue in =
a moment after this from our ABC stations.=20
(Commercial break)=20
DONALDSON: Now our ROUNDTABLE and Enron, where we give our opinions. And as=
 always, joining us, George Will.=20
Good to see you, George.=20
GEORGE WILL reporting:=20
Sir.=20
DONALDSON: And, of course, George Stephanopoulos back.=20
Does George W. Bush have anything to worry about here, George Will?=20
WILL: He has lots to worry about. Look, the Democratic Party is always an i=
nherently vulnerable to the suspicion that it is associated with the wilder=
 shores of the cultural left. The Republican's inherent vulnerability is bi=
g business in the sense that big business is corrupt. Furthermore, there's =
the whole stereotype of Texas culture. Furthermore, the president, in his s=
tatement in the Oval Office when he said, `Mr. Lay supported Anne Richards =
in 1994,' was being Clintonian. That is, slippery. That is, he was technica=
lly right, but on the real matter, wrong.=20
DONALDSON: Well, George Stephanopoulos...=20
STEPHANOPOULOS: Slapped on the wrist by George Will, that's not the...=20
DONALDSON: Well, Mr. Lay said in a television interview before that electio=
n that while it was difficult, he was actually going to support George Bush=
.=20
STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, yeah, he was, and he gave, like you say, three times =
as much to George Bush than Anne Richards in `94. It was an odd moment for =
the president. I think it was to distinguish between the kinds of trouble h=
e is in. You know, you hear all week long this is like Whitewater. It's exa=
ctly like Whitewater in this respect: No matter how much you investigate, y=
ou're not going to find any abuse of power in the White House or by top gov=
ernment or Cabinet officials. You're not going to find that. Where--where B=
ush could be vulnerable is just this whole web of influence and contacts th=
at he had with Enron. And these ties, as George says, to big business, part=
icularly big oil.=20
ROBERTS: But, you know, the Democrats are in danger of overreaching, as the=
y always are, or as either party is when it comes to something like this. A=
nd they--they understand that. And there some people urging caution and par=
ticularly since many Democrats also took large sums of money from Enron.=20
DONALDSON: But Senator Levin said to you, Cokie, that he was not going to..=
.=20
ROBERTS: Right.=20
DONALDSON: He--he accepted all this that O'Neill and others were saying; th=
ey didn't do anything.=20
ROBERTS: But, you know, I do think that the president could do a couple of =
things that would make you crazy (looking towards George Will). The first w=
ould be to come after campaign finance reform. He doesn't care about it. He=
's made it clear he doesn't really care much about it, so why not support i=
t, and then--and then he gets rid of that whole issue. The other thing that=
 the White House could do that would make a big difference would be to stop=
 all of the bandying about with the House members--Republicans and Democrat=
s and the general accounting office--about the energy task force. Just thro=
w them mounds of paper from the energy task force.=20
STEPHANOPOULOS: And if they don't--if they don't, they're going to get sued=
...=20
ROBERTS: Sued by the GAO.=20
STEPHANOPOULOS: ...by the GAO. But, you know, I spoke with a White House of=
ficial late Friday and yesterday, and they are still insisting that they ar=
e going to go right down the line on this. And what they're doing is making=
 these documents more valuable.=20
DONALDSON: Well, the stone wall seldom works.=20
WILL: Cokie's right. Look, there are four things. You've mentioned two of t=
hem. Campaign finance may get passed. It shouldn't, but it will because of =
this. He may lose--Cheney may lose his argument with the GAO. He shouldn't,=
 but he may because of this. Gray Davis will be helped in his election in C=
alifornia because he can turn his mismanagement of their energy crisis back=
 on evil Texans. And furthermore, the whole drive to privatize--partially p=
rivatize Social Security will be hurt by this. Shouldn't be, but...=20
STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, it wasn't going anywhere, anyway.=20
WILL: I understand.=20
STEPHANOPOULOS: Absolutely. But what else will be hurt, though? There's ano=
ther part of Bush's agenda which will hurt him substantively but help him p=
olitically: this whole effort to deregulate, particularly in the environmen=
tal area. It's going to be much harder for him to do that. If he doesn't do=
 it, though, it takes away one of the Democrat's best issues.=20
ROBERTS: But you know what, on the longer term, one of the things that--tha=
t both parties--but particularly Democrats because they have been the party=
 of government--is going to have to worry about is that we have seen in the=
 last few months since September 11th this tremendous surge and trust in go=
vernment and a trust in the Congress, of all things, and the--and the presi=
dent and the leadership. I think this is going to send that sinking.=20
STEPHANOPOULOS: But--no, but right now there might be more calls now for th=
e use of government, for the tools of government, calls for the re-regulati=
on...=20
WILL: I agree--I agree entirely with George. War is the health of the state=
. We've said often this fall scandal can be the health of the state. Becaus=
e now attention will be turned back to the 1995 bill...=20
ROBERTS: But don't you think it all gets to...=20
WILL: ...where by one vote...=20
DONALDSON: They chose it...=20
WILL: ...they overrode Clinton's veto of a deregulate--of a weakening of th=
e securities bill.=20
STEPHANOPOULOS: Make Congress cease...(unintelligible).=20
DONALDSON: Another aspect. I mean, let's assume that the administration doe=
sn't have any culpability in this directly. Who did? Who is to blame? What =
happened here?=20
ROBERTS: It--it looks like a good many people are out there to blame.=20
STEPHANOPOULOS: I mean, there's two people are going down for sure. I mean,=
 Jeffrey Fastow (sic), the--the man who set up the partnerships is in big t=
rouble. Arthur Andersen looks like it it's going straight down the tubes. T=
hey've tried to blame it on--on Enron, but they're not going to get away wi=
th. The other day I spoke with a man who made a fortune short-selling Enron=
. His name is James Chanos. And he said all the clues were there. You had t=
he insider selling, you had indecipherable footnotes on these--on these par=
tnerships...=20
ROBERTS: And he was sending up warnings a year ago.=20
STEPHANOPOULOS: ...and you had front loading of profits. Those clues were a=
ll there. Arthur Andersen is to blame for a lot of it.=20
DONALDSON: Well, clear--clearly, employees of Arthur Andersen in Houston ma=
de the calculation it was better to take the rap, which could be criminal, =
for shredding these documents than actually letting the documents be made p=
ublic.=20
WILL: I argued last Sunday, Sam, that this is not a Washington story. Prima=
rily, it's a New York Arthur Andersen and Houston/Enron story. But, you kno=
w, in--in California and other states that have `three strikes and you're o=
ut,' you got to jail forever. Sunbeam, Waste Management and Enron, how many=
 strikes does Arthur Andersen get?=20
DONALDSON: And what about the other accounting companies? How do we know th=
at some of them haven't also been playing fast and loose?=20
STEPHANOPOULOS: We don't. In fact, that bill that George was talking about =
just a--just a minute ago, since then there have been four to 500 restateme=
nts by accounting firms of all of their different reports. And this is goin=
g to go across the board.=20
ROBERTS: But, you know, it's also true that Enron is not the only company t=
o have done what its done in terms of the executives getting big bucks out =
and the employees being left holding the bag. And I do think that that's wh=
at most--most people care about. Most people want to make sure their 401ks =
are OK, most people want to make sure they're not getting stiffed. And--and=
 really, Enron is just one example of that in recent years.=20
STEPHANOPOULOS: And--and that's why you can bet that the first Bush task fo=
rce to report back is going to be the one for 401k reform. They're going to=
 try to move something through very quickly on that. Harder to get reform o=
f corporate governance. even though people will want it, all the lobbyists =
are going to come in and try to slow that down.=20
ROBERTS: And that's going to be a real test of the ideology of this adminis=
tration as well. Does the ideology take over and--and the whole idea of reg=
ulation of corporations become forbidden?=20
WILL: Well, 120 large US corporations have 401ks for their employees in whi=
ch at least a third of the stock held by them are those corporation's stock=
. That ought to change. But there's a larger point here that you point to. =
And conservatives have to understand that capitalism and free markets don't=
 just spring up like crab grass. They're the product of a very complicated =
set of laws and enforcement and provisions.=20
ROBERTS: That's right.=20
WILL: Capitalism's a government program.=20
DONALDSON: And also you--I must understand and I think people do--in capita=
lism there are winners and there are losers. And not everyone can be protec=
ted against loss. But you would think that if there is a fraud involved..=
=20
STEPHANOPOULOS: That's right.=20
DONALDSON: ...the kind of mismanagement that we see here, there ought to be=
 some protection.=20
ROBERTS: And the rule of law has to prevail.=20
STEPHANOPOULOS: Yeah, and the rule of--if it looks too good to be--if it lo=
oks too good to be true, it probably is. Don't even ask.=20
DONALDSON: You got the last word, George. Thank you.=20
And when we come back, there are more questionable transactions causing con=
troversy in THIS WEEK's edition of the George Will commentary. George expla=
ins it right after this.=20
(Commercial break)=20
ROBERTS: George Will, Enron and football?=20
WILL: Cokie, Enron's accounting books should be filed under fiction. And af=
ter last Sunday, so should the NFL's record book. Going into the last regul=
ar season game, New York Giant Michael Strahan needed just one sack of the =
quarterback to set a record. Late in the fourth quarter, he still needed it=
. So quarterback Brett Favre, whose Packers had the game won, gave it to hi=
m. Watch this. Favre kept the ball and ran towards Strahan. Your Aunt Minn =
(ph) could have sacked Favre. Then Strahan's teammates gave Favre's friendl=
y pats. Everyone was so nice.=20
In 1998, a Connecticut basketball player suffered a career-ending injury ju=
st one basket shy of the school scoring record. So, her coach and the visit=
ing team agreed to exchange uncontested lay-ups. The player got the record.=
 Everyone was nice.=20
Some say Joe DiMaggio got help with his 50-game hitting record. Official sc=
orers may have turned what should have been errors into Dimaggio hits. The =
scorers were being nice.=20
In 1910, Ty Cobb was detested and Napoleon LaJoie was nice. On the last day=
 of the season, one team tried to help LaJoie beat Cobb for the batting tit=
le. The team's third baseman played far back, LaJoie got eight hits, six of=
 them bunts towards third. The team was being nice.=20
Last Sunday, many people said, `Michael Strahan is nice, and Brett Favre wa=
s nice, so what's the harm?' Well, here's the harm: The moral seriousness o=
f sport derives from the integrity of the competition. Absent that, you hav=
e a sham like professional wrestling. Records are worth keeping and celebra=
ting and striving to break because they certify excellence, excellence achi=
eved under the pressure of competition. Rig the competition in order to be =
nice, and records will certify nothing. Sport is morally serious because at=
hletic excellence cannot be faked. Niceness isn't nice when it produces fak=
ery on the playing field.=20
ROBERTS: So much for nice.=20
Sam and I will be right back.=20
(Commercial break)=20
ROBERTS: Well, Sam, it's neither Enron nor football on dot-com.=20
DONALDSON: That's right. Some news organizations, including ours, want the =
trial of Zacarias Moussaoui, who is charged with complicity in the Septembe=
r 11th attack on America, to be televised. And prosecutors say that's too d=
angerous. You can see the arguments if you logon to sam.abcnews.com.=20
ROBERTS: And until next week, that's THIS WEEK.

Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

WILL wonders never cease? Last week a couple of heavy hitters left money on=
 the table.=20
Mark McGwire, the home-run-hitting baseball player for St. Louis, retired. =
And he let it be known that he never signed a two-year, $30 million contrac=
t his agent negotiated last spring. Why? Because he wanted to find out if h=
is injured right knee would allow him to play as well as he had before. It =
didn't, and he decided he wasn't worth that kind of money.
Then Ken Lay, chairman of Enron Corp., said he won't take the $60.6 million=
 he had coming to him in a severance agreement that comes into play when En=
ron is sold to Dynegy Corp.=20
Of course, neither McGwire nor Lay will ever have to consider my fallback r=
etirement plan - sacking groceries at the supermarket, carrying them to the=
 car and hoping for a big tip. Still, it was a class act on both their part=
s. McGwire only hit .187 last season, well below his lifetime average. And =
Lay? Well, let's say that rarely in the history of American capitalism has =
a company sunk as fast as Enron.=20
Remember that earlier this year its stock hit a top of $82 a share. Now it'=
s hovering in the single-digit level, and Enron is being forced to sell its=
elf to a smaller rival.=20
The stock price incentive=20
How did Enron get into this position? Put the blame on the company's relent=
less drive to push up its stock price. And a big reason for that push comes=
 from the way American companies compensate top executives.=20
In the last couple of decades, executive compensation has soared. The avera=
ge chief executive officer today makes 531 times as much in salary, bonuses=
 and stock options as the average factory worker.=20
Apologists for executive pay say these kinds of figures really aren't relev=
ant. Most of the money top executives receive doesn't come from base pay or=
 bonuses but from stock options.=20
Such options usually work this way. Executives are given hundreds or thousa=
nds of shares of stock that they can only buy from the company at a future =
date. The sales price can be anything from 10 cents to the price of the sto=
ck on the date the options were granted. If the stock increases past the ex=
ercise price in the option, the executive can buy the stock and then sell i=
t, making big bucks. It the stock has dropped below the option price - it's=
 underwater, in the jargon - then those options are worthless.=20
Granting options aligns the interests of the top executives with the shareh=
olders, those who favor this sort of incentive say. And that's true, if you=
 talking about in-and-out traders. But it's not true if we're looking out f=
or the interests of the majority who hold stocks for the long term.=20
Keeping the debt hidden=20
Keeping its stock price soaring was what brought down Enron.=20
To hype the stock, Enron's execs were hiding the debt it took on to fuel it=
s amazing growth and some of its dicier investments, in partnerships. Enron=
 was supposedly only a minority partner in these deals. That way it could m=
ove a large portion of its debt off its books in that partnership. That, in=
 turn, made the company's earnings look better.=20
When Enron's executives finally fessed up, they had to write down their pro=
fits over the past few years by 20 percent. But the real irony here is that=
 80 percent is still a heck of a lot of money. But by that time, the majori=
ty of shareholders simply had no faith in Enron's bookkeeping.=20
Now look at Lay's compensation. In 1999 he exercised stock options and made=
 $44 million on them. In 2000, sales of options brought him $123 million, a=
nd this year about $26 million, according to a study published by Bloomberg=
 News.=20
Was Lay deliberating deceiving investors to keep his stock options profitab=
le? I don't think so. He was simply following the latest fad in corporate g=
overnance. He was aligning himself with the interests of the shareholders.=
=20
The shareholders were happy with that high stock price. Nobody - besides so=
me stock analysts - complained about Enron's often- impenetrable bookkeepin=
g until that stock price started to fall.=20
Would Enron's bookkeeping have been different if top executives received fe=
wer stock options? Maybe.=20
Fewer stock options would mean lower pay for the top guys. And no one would=
 want that job if he were only going to make $10 million a year instead of =
$100 million.=20
Just kidding.

Economic News Helps Stocks, Not Bonds

Stocks rallied and bonds plunged last week as investors digested some posit=
ive reports about the economy. Inflation at the consumer level declined las=

 unemployment claims slowed.=20
All this news led some investors to conclude that the economy might not be =
as troubled as it appeared to be in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks.=
 That was good for the stock market, but very bad for the many bond investo=
rs who had been assuming the worst.
For the week, the Nasdaq composite index rose 70.10 points, or 3.8 percent,=
 to 1,898.58, while the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 258.99 points,=
 or 2.7 percent, to 9,866.99. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained =
18.33 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,138.65.=20
But bond prices tumbled while yields, which move in the opposite direction,=
 soared. The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note rose to 4.85 percent, fro=
m 4.31 percent a week ago, the biggest weekly move in percentage terms sinc=
e the note was first regularly issued 25 years ago. The jump in rates also =
showed that many investors no longer expect Federal Reserve policy makers t=
o cut short-term interest rates when they meet next month. JONATHAN FUERBRI=

Investing
Bullish, and Patient, on Energy Stocks
By JAN M. ROSEN

11/18/2001
The New York Times
Page 8, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company

DESPITE last week's plunge in the price of crude oil and in shares of big o=
il companies, some Wall Street analysts remain upbeat about the long-term p=
rospects for energy stocks.=20
''These very dramatic downturns are great buying opportunities,'' said Tina=
 Vital, an oil and gas analyst at Standard & Poor's, who recommends a broad=
 group of integrated oil companies, including Exxon Mobil, ChevronTexaco, R=
oyal Dutch/Shell, BP and TotalFinaElf. ''They have excellent management, a =
top dividend yield and are a safe haven for investors,'' she said, provided=
 that investors are patient and can bear short-term swings.
Last week's price declines were set off by Russian oil companies' refusal t=
o accept demands by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries f=
or big production cuts. They were a reminder that the sector is extremely v=
olatile. ''Oil could go to $10 a barrel short term,'' she said, but there i=
s no certainty of that. The oil producers could reach an agreement by Janua=
ry, sending prices upward. Over the long term, she expects to see productio=
n cuts.=20
Demand for energy has grown only 0.5 percent this year, and prices have bee=
n declining for some time for both crude oil and gasoline -- as drivers hav=
e seen at the gas pump. West Texas intermediate crude closed Friday at $18.=
03 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, up 58 cents from its Thursday close=
, the lowest since June 1999. But an economic recovery, expected by late 20=
02, could cause demand to pick up, analysts say.=20
As oil prices have dropped, so have the prices of most oil stocks, but not =
as much as the overall market since the beginning of 2000. Over that period=
, the S.& P. energy index has lost 8 percent, while the S.& P. 500-stock in=
dex is down 23 percent.=20
A report issued last week by the Energy Department said that while the Sept=
. 11 terrorist attacks had intensified the country's economic slowdown, ''t=
hey are not expected to result in any long-term volatility in energy market=
s.'' The report estimated that commercial energy demand would rise 1.7 perc=
ent a year through 2020, instead of the 1.2 percent predicted only a year a=
go. Its predictions assume increased use of computers and office equipment,=
 and slower increases in fuel efficiency for cars and trucks.=20
WHILE they warn of the possibility of wild price shifts in the months ahead=
, other analysts are similarly bullish for the long term. L. Bruce Lanni, s=
enior oil analyst at A. G. Edwards & Sons in New York, said that any potent=
ial price war was likely to be fairly short-lived, because neither OPEC nor=
 non-OPEC countries could ''withstand low oil prices for a prolonged period=
 of time,'' and prices should rebound sharply as a result, ''back up in the=
 lower to mid-$20 range.''=20
Low prices could be painful for most of the oil companies in the short term=
, but Mr. Lanni, too, sees value in the stocks.=20
His top pick is Conoco, now trading at $24.30; his 12-month target is $34. =
''We remain confident,'' he said, ''that the company's annual oil and gas p=
roduction should grow by about 4 percent, on average, over the next several=
 years.''=20
Conoco's debt, at 55 percent of capital, is relatively high, but he expects=
 the company's strong cash flow -- it equaled $5.33 a share last year -- to=
 reduce the debt level to 46 percent next year and to 38 percent in 2003. T=
he company's after-tax interest cost is only 3.5 percent, he said.=20
Mr. Lanni also favors Kerr-McGee, a natural gas exploration and production =
company, and BP, calling both undervalued. He regards Exxon Mobil, Royal Du=
tch/Shell and ChevronTexaco as fully priced, so he is not recommending buyi=
ng them now. ''If you own them, hold them,'' he said.=20
William Featherston, executive director and an oil and gas exploration anal=
yst at UBS Warburg, said he felt ''near-term caution but medium-term optimi=
sm for sustainably higher'' natural gas prices. He said he would encourage =
investors to consider buying shares of exploration and production companies=
 over the next two months. His top picks are Apache, Kerr-McGee and EOG Res=
ources.=20
Such stocks are highly volatile, he said. They are ''trading-oriented vehic=
les, and short-term volatility in commodity prices generally provides the m=
ost attractive entry and exit points,'' he said. ''While natural gas prices=
 declined throughout most of this year, prices rose at a startling pace, fr=
om $1.75 per million cubic feet at the end of September to over $3 per mill=
ion cubic feet within weeks.''=20
He cited three reasons for the price rally: a decline in gas surpluses, pre=
dictions of a colder-than-normal winter and what he has called ''pathetic t=
hird-quarter natural gas production,'' despite record drilling activity.=20
The tangled finances of the Enron Corporation were also a factor in the rec=
ent price increase for natural gas futures, he said. Enron, which marketed =
25 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas, or more than 40 percent of the =
nation's demand, is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Comm=
ission and announced a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity from de=
als with partnerships involving its former chief financial officer. It also=
 reported a third-quarter loss and restated earlier earnings. Enron has agr=
eed to be taken over by Dynegy, a smaller rival, for about $9 billion in st=
ock. Dynegy is also assuming about $13 billion in debt.=20
Anxiety over whether the Enron investigation would disrupt deliveries or ha=
ve other market repercussions led to an increase in prices. While it is ''d=
ifficult to quantify the Enron factor,'' Mr. Featherston said, the short-te=
rm effects on natural gas prices seem to be over.=20
OTHER factors, of course, could also mean a bumpy ride for energy investors=
 over the next several months. The status of the war against terrorism, Pre=
sident Bush's decision to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, thus helpin=
g OPEC in reducing excess global capacity, and a United Nations review of t=
he food-for-oil deal with Iraq expected in December could each have a signi=
ficant impact on battered oil prices.=20
Nevertheless, Ms. Vital said, for the long term, energy will probably be in=
 short supply, and new sources must be developed. So she also likes the pro=
spects of two drilling companies, Noble Drilling and Nabors Industries. Bot=
h took a beating last week, along with the oil companies, so again she sees=
 buying opportunities.=20
Bern Fleming, portfolio manager of the AXP Utilities Income fund in Minneap=
olis, who has stakes in Dynegy, Duke Energy and Dominion Resources, said al=
l three had good prospects for growth, thanks to a mix of assets, ''managem=
ent I respect and solid business plans.''

Aquila Energy Makes Provision for Dynegy Withdrawal, FT Says
2001-11-18 19:52 (New York)

     Houston, Nov. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Aquila Energy Corp. is one of
several energy traders limiting its trading with Enron Corp. in
case Dynegy Inc. pulls out of its bid for the company, the
Financial Times said, citing Aquila.

     Aquila said it began making contingency plans in case Dynegy
withdrew from its $24 billion takeover of Enron, the paper
reported.

     Enron, the largest energy trader, decided to sell after its
shares plunged this year and a federal investigation of accounting
irregularities limited its ability to finance operations. Enron's
collapse would have caused upheaval in energy markets, where the
company does one-quarter of all gas and power trades.

     Dynegy's agreement to buy Enron allows it to withdraw from
the transaction under certain circumstances, the FT said.



PERSPECTIVES
A tale of greed and hubris
Waldo Proffitt

All
F2
(Copyright 2001)

For anyone not already disenchanted with the idea of total deregulation of =
public utilities, the most recent installment of the miserable Enron story =
as it unfolded last week should serve as a convincing example of the folly =
of relying on unregulated profit- driven enterprises to supply our energy.=
=20
A year ago Enron was the darling of Wall Street, the poster boy for the uti=
lity industry, its stock selling for about $85 a share. Last week its stock=
 was worth about 10 percent of that and the company had agreed to be bought=
 by a competitor. There was fear the company's bond rating might fall to th=
e "junk" level.
What happened? It will take months, if not years, to untangle the details, =
but it is clear that the main culprit was greed, closely followed by hubris=
.=20
Not too many years ago Enron was a small, struggling, gas pipeline company =
in Houston. As deregulation spread to more and more states, Enron began acq=
uiring pipelines, gas producers and utilities.=20
It also acquired friends in high places, especially the Bush family and the=
ir key political advisers. And, it discovered it could make money faster by=
 selling and trading energy than by producing it. Enron sold many of its ge=
nerating plants and became the biggest "power broker" in the nation.=20
Though it was by no means the largest winner in the con game that bilked Ca=
lifornia consumers of tens of billions of dollars, Enron was one of the fir=
st power barons to take advantage of California's flawed deregulation law -=
- virtually written by in-state and out-of- state utility companies.=20
The California fiasco soured (probably) most Americans on utility deregulat=
ion, but Enron was not singled out for calumny, and management saw no reaso=
n to examine its business ethics.=20
Contrarywise. management had visions of even greater profits, which it felt=
 no obligation to share with ordinary stockholders. The chief financial off=
icer and other high-ranking executives set up affiliated or subsidiary part=
nerships which made deals with Enron. I do not understand the details of th=
ese arrangements, but neither do independent accountants, the Securities an=
d Exchange Commission or congressional investigators. It does seem clear th=
at the Enron insiders made millions for themselves.=20
Enron acknowledges, without explaining, that stockholder equity dropped $1.=
2 billion in the last quarter and that it had for the last five years overs=
tated profits by some $600 million. Whether this was by design or by mistak=
e is in dispute, but it is the sort of thing which tends to undermine the c=
onfidence of investors.=20
So much for greed. Back to hubris. It seems not unlikely that Enron's leade=
rs felt they might not be punished for a modest amount of corner-cutting be=
cause they had friends in high places.=20
The chief executive, Kenneth L. Lay, was and is a personal friend of George=
 W. Bush and has easy access to the White House. For many months after the =
new administration took office, Karl Rove, Bush's top political strategist,=
 owned Enron stock valued at $100,000 to $250,000, and sold it only after h=
e had been able to secure a ruling that he did not have to pay capital gain=
s tax immediately because he sold to avoid a conflict of interest. Lawrence=
 Lindsey, the president's chief economic coordinator, and I. Lewis Libby, V=
ice President Cheney's chief of staff, owned stock in Enron, and Lindsey wa=
s paid $50,000 last year as a consultant for Enron.=20
Enron and its employees gave more than anyone else to Bush's four political=
 campaigns -- one (unsuccessful) for Congress, two for governor and one for=
 president. In 2000, Enron and its employees gave $113,000 to Bush's campai=
gn, $250,000 to the Republican National Committee, and $300,000 to the Pres=
idential Inauguration Committee.=20
Cabinet appointments affecting energy policy, key sub-Cabinet appointments,=
 administration action or inaction in the California energy mess, and the o=
verall energy policy of the administration could hardly have been more favo=
rable to the interests of Enron.=20
And now a couple of questions: Is it possible the unusual financial maneuve=
rs by Enron went unnoticed or even unsuspected by all the savvy Texas oilme=
n in the Bush administration? Were those of them with heavy investments in =
Enron unconcerned about the conduct of the company? Was Enron right in thin=
king its friends in government would not be in a hurry to investigate or to=
 reprimand?=20
Or, in light of our preoccupation with terrorism, will the Enron case get m=
uch attention from the federal government? Or from voters?=20

Try finishing this sentence: "The best thing about my experience as an inve=
stor in 2001 was ... "=20
Many Americans, contemplating the losses they've suffered this year in the =
stock market, might say there was nothing "best" about what happened to the=
m--in fact, nothing good at all, perhaps other than that it might have been=
 worse.
With share prices on the rise again, the damage to portfolios has been less=
ened. Even so, stocks will have to post strong gains in the next six weeks =
to keep this from being the market's worst calendar year since 1977.=20
The blue-chip Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 1.6% last week, but it's sti=
ll down 13.8% year to date.=20
Yet those losses, while certainly not trivial (especially when they're your=
s), can obscure what arguably are some very positive aspects of this year's=
 experiences.=20
With investing, adversity can be a more important teacher than success. If =
you're having trouble this Thanksgiving week finding reasons to be thankful=
 about anything investment-related, try these on for size:=20
* "Asset allocation" is no longer just a quaint theory. The paramount inves=
ting rule has always been to spread your money around to reduce risk. But i=
t took the worst stock bear market in 25 years to bring this lesson home fo=
r many people who thought equities only rose in value.=20
Now, millions of investors have a far better appreciation for just how much=
 they can lose in stocks--and how bonds and short-term cash savings can off=
set market losses and preserve capital.=20
It has been a hard lesson, to be sure. But investors who take asset allocat=
ion to heart will be laying a much more solid foundation for their money in=
 the long run. And don't underestimate what that can mean for your peace of=
 mind long term.=20
* The wisdom of saving money on a regular basis has been relearned. In the =
late 1990s, many economists lamented how the U.S. savings rate continued to=
 shrink. Some people felt there was little need to put significant new sums=
 into savings when the stocks or stock mutual funds they owned seemed to be=
 rising nonstop.=20
In other words, many Americans were letting the stock market do their savin=
g for them when share prices were rising 20% or more each year.=20
Now, with shares down and with the likelihood of much more moderate returns=
 on stocks in this decade, it's clear that many people will have to find a =
way to save regularly if they're going to meet their long-term financial go=
als, especially retirement.=20
This may not be a pleasant reality, but it's better for most people to have=
 faced this fact sooner rather than later, while there may be time to make =
up lost ground.=20
* A healthy skepticism has replaced mindless euphoria about stocks and thos=
e who tout them. The market's slide has discredited a legion of Wall Street=
 analysts, money managers and others whose knowledge, understanding and jud=
gment were clearly lacking, in retrospect.=20
Investors have come to see that having blind faith in those who present the=
mselves as "experts" is a highly dangerous strategy, if it can be called a =
strategy at all.=20
Sure, it may have been more fun when technology stocks were shooting the mo=
on and nobody had much use for reviewing a company's fundamentals. But that=
 wasn't investing--it was speculating, and on a massive, and ultimately rui=
nous, scale.=20
People have learned to be less trusting about what others say about the mar=
ket, and that is more likely to be beneficial than detrimental to their por=
tfolios in the long run.=20
Just ask anyone who shifted their entire 401(k) retirement savings sum into=
 aggressive-growth mutual funds in the first quarter of 2000--right before =
the market peaked--because of the bullish comments of some 25-year-old tech=
 stock analyst. Those investors aren't likely to make a move like that agai=
n.=20
* Free-market forces are weeding out the weak players and the phonies. Capi=
talism may be harsh, but it's efficient when the good times end and it's ti=
me to find out which companies truly have talent and staying power--and des=
erve more capital.=20
Hundreds of dot-coms have failed, but who really misses them? Is it any har=
der to find what you want on the Internet? It probably would have been much=
 worse for all concerned if those companies had sucked up investors' funds =
for another year instead of failing when they did.=20
But the market isn't just eliminating small companies that never had much o=
f a future. The financial near-collapse of energy giant Enron Corp. exposed=
 a business that twisted accounting rules to its own benefit--to the point =
that the company now concedes that financial statements all the way back to=
 1997 "should not be relied upon."=20
Also to be weeded out, though over a longer time period, will be mutual fun=
d managers whose performance running other peoples' money has been a nightm=
are for those investors--meaning, the returns produced have been far worse =
than what the investors would have achieved in the average fund in that par=
ticular sector.=20
These managers know who they are--and, hopefully, their shareholders know b=
y now as well, and will vote with their feet.=20
The free market also is reminding cartels just how tough it is to control p=
rices.=20
Once again, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has lost its =
ability to prop up crude oil prices, which have sunk to two-year lows amid =
the weak global economy. That's lousy for OPEC, but it's great for every en=
ergy consumer.=20
* The market's woes have altered many investors' priorities for the better.=
 The wild bull market of the late 1990s demanded peoples' attention, and go=
t it.=20
For some, stocks became an obsession. Their portfolios dominated their live=
s, especially if they were actively trading shares. They believed they were=
 going to be rich, or richer, and that it was all because of how smart they=
 were.=20
Now, most people have been humbled by the market. In the process, some have=
 realized that they don't want their mood determined by their portfolio's d=
ay-to-date price changes.=20
The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, of course, also changed many peoples' view =
of what truly matters to them.=20
Money is important, but you aren't your stocks, and they aren't you. Life i=

INVESTING James K. Glassman
Don't Be A Pudd'n'head, Diversify
James K. Glassman

Warren Buffett, who was probably the greatest investor of the 20th century,=
 is fond of quoting the salacious actress Mae West as saying, "Too much of =
a good thing can be wonderful." In the market, such a motto would lead you =
to avoid diversification and instead concentrate your portfolio in stocks y=
ou really, really like.=20
Peter Lynch, who was probably the best mutual fund manager of the 20th cent=
ury, calls spreading yourself too thin "diworseification."
Smart, witty and brilliant at picking stocks, Buffett and Lynch may not nee=
d diversification, but the rest of us do. When you own one stock, you're ou=
t on a limb. For example, very few analysts -- with or without a conflict o=
f interest -- predicted that shares of Enron, the energy and trading compan=
y, would tumble by 90 percent in a year. Put all your eggs in a basket like=
 that and you end up with a gooey mess. The more stocks you own -- as long =
as they are in different industries -- the more the overall riskiness of yo=
ur portfolio is modulated.=20
The reason you don't want a super-risky portfolio is simple: While Warren B=
uffett may be calm and prescient enough to ride out severe dips in the valu=
e of his holdings, most investors are not. A portfolio that increases in pr=
ice by 10 percent each and every year is worth exactly the same at the end =
of three years as a portfolio that falls by half the first year, rises by t=
hree-quarters the second and rises by 52 percent the third. But reasonable =
investors prefer the consistent ride. It prevents them from doing something=
 stupid, such as selling all their stocks after losing half their money dur=
ing that first disastrous year.=20
Consider the sad case of James D. McCall, who earlier this month resigned a=
s manager of the Merrill Lynch Focus Twenty mutual fund. Two years ago, Mer=
rill wanted McCall's services so desperately that the firm went to court to=
 pry McCall away from his previous employer, Pilgrim Baxter, where he rang =
up impressive gains in the late 1990s. (His big success was called PBHG Lar=
ge Cap 20.) And when they got McCall, Merrill's brokers raised more than $1=
.5 billion from their clients for him to invest. While the average growth-s=
tock mutual fund owns about 100 stocks, with the top 10 holdings representi=
ng about one-fourth of the portfolio's total value, McCall specialized in w=
hat are called "concentrated portfolios." In the case of Merrill Lynch Focu=
s Twenty, he owned, as the name implies, just 20 stocks. At last report, hi=
s top 10 holdings accounted for a whopping two-thirds of the fund's assets.=
=20
If McCall had spread his 20 stocks among, say, a dozen different industries=
, he might have smoothed his ride. Instead, 69 percent of his assets went t=
o technology firms. The Focus fund and a smaller one that McCall ran called=
 Premier Growth were launched in March 2000. Within just 17 months, all but=
 $650 million of the clients' original $1.5 billion had vanished.=20
It is hard to imagine losing as much as Focus Twenty did even if you tried.=
 As of Nov. 9, the week McCall resigned, the fund was down 72 percent for t=
he year, compared with a loss of 14 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-s=
tock index, the benchmark for fund managers. According to the latest report=
 from Morningstar Mutual Funds, 19 of McCall's 20 stocks had declined durin=
g 2001, the only exception being Harley-Davidson. More amazing, 16 of the 1=
9 losers had fallen by at least half. (By the way, Enron was McCall's seven=
th-largest holding.)=20
"This fund has had a wretched existence," wrote Morningstar analyst Kunal K=
apoor, who did admit a grudging admiration for McCall's perseverance. McCal=
l's "faith may turn out to be well placed over time," Kapoor said. Unfortun=
ately, time ran out.=20
My point here is not to pick on McCall but to reveal the perils of concentr=
ation. Buying Focus Twenty as a technology fund, and consigning it to no mo=
re than one-fifth of your holdings (with the rest of your assets in diversi=
fied, conventional stocks or funds) might have made sense, but Focus Twenty=
 was touted as a "long-term capital appreciation" fund, not a sector fund. =
Here, it failed, but maybe it didn't have to.=20
The manager who made the concentrated fund popular, Tom Marsico, who ran Ja=
nus Twenty, took care to spread his holdings around. His successor, Scott S=
choelzel, has suffered losses lately (he is down 28 percent year-to-date, b=
ut that's after a total gain of 546 percent in the preceding five years), b=
ut they have not been nearly so catastrophic -- and for good reason. Schoel=
zel's last report lists among his top 10 holdings three tech stocks, two fi=
nancials, one drug company, one energy firm (whoops, Enron again), one indu=
strial, one consumer-durables company and one services firm.=20
For investors in individual stocks, the important question is this: How muc=
h diversification is enough? Some risk is inherent in even the broadest por=
tfolio. This is called market, or "systematic," risk. Over the past 75 year=
s, market risk, as measured in standard deviation, has been about 20 percen=
t. In other words, in two-thirds of the years the annual return of the S&P =
has fallen into a band ranging from 20 points lower to 20 points higher tha=
n its average return of 11 percent; that is, between a loss of 9 percent an=
d a gain of 31 percent. That's still volatile, but if you invest in stocks =
you have to live with it.=20
What you don't have to live with is anything more volatile. So your objecti=
ve in building a portfolio is to try to approximate systematic risk and avo=
id what is called "idiosyncratic," or extra, risk. A portfolio with just a =
few stocks, or one like McCall's, that is overloaded in a single sector, ha=
s lots of idiosyncratic risk. In 1977, an influential study found that inve=
stors could nearly eliminate that extra risk by owning just 20 stocks in a =
wide variety of sectors; in fact, owning eight or 10 stocks depressed risk =
sharply.=20
Recently, however, the market has appeared to be far more volatile, and a n=
ew study by a group of economists headed by John Campbell of Harvard found =
that many more stocks were needed -- around 50 -- to bring a portfolio down=
 to the same level of riskiness as the broad market. What Campbell's group =
found was that neither the market itself nor individual sectors had become =
more volatile in the 1990s, but that stocks within those sectors had, so yo=
u need to own more of them.=20
But owning 50 stocks is a pain in the neck -- and it brings up the Buffett-=
Lynch admonitions about too much diversification. It is hard just to take t=
he time to make the selections, but even buy-and-hold investors need to kee=
p track of the companies they own to spot adverse changes in management, pr=
oduct failures or new competition (not to mention Enron-style accounting sh=
enanigans) -- signs that it's time to sell.=20
One good answer is to achieve balance by owning a combination of mutual fun=
ds and stocks. For example, you might want to put 50 percent of the money y=
ou have allotted for stocks into a fund that mimics the S&P itself, like Va=
nguard Index 500, which charges rock-bottom expenses and guarantees that ri=
sk won't exceed systematic levels. You could also consider a broad fund tha=
t's managed by human beings, such as Meridian Value or Baron Growth, which =
are recommended by Sheldon Jacobs, editor of the No-Load Fund Investor news=
letter. Then another 25 percent of your holdings can go into a few sector f=
unds that specialize in technology, real estate, energy and small-caps, and=
 the final 25 percent into a portfolio of 10 to 20 individual stocks. (I ow=
n 16, at last count.)=20
There are many valid variations. Just don't emulate Mark Twain.=20
In a letter to clients recently, Anthony M. Maramarco of David L. Babson & =
Co., the Cambridge, Mass., investment firm, recalled the aphorism of Twain'=
s Pudd'n'head Wilson: "Put all your eggs in the one basket -- and watch tha=
t basket!" Unfortunately, such a philosophy emphatically does not work in s=
tock investing -- as Twain himself learned when he sank nearly all his fort=
une into the Paige Linotype, a machine that flopped.=20
We all make mistakes. (It was Twain, after all, who pointed out that "human=
 beings are the only animals that blush -- or need to.") But smart diversif=
ication helps investors avoid some of the worst of them.=20

Wessex Water `to be sold'

(Copyright 2001 Independent Newspapers (UK) Limited)

Wessex Water, the water and sewage company, is understood to be up for sale=
 following an offer to take over its owner, Enron, by Dynegy, the US energy=
 group.=20
Three years ago, Enron spent pounds 1.4bn on Wessex Water. But Dynegy is un=
derstood to want to concentrate on US and European energy assets and is not=
 interested in non-core assets.
Any hope to regain the same amount of money could be derailed as the indust=
ry is put off by regulatory problems, and the company's results have worsen=
ed due to imposed price cuts over the past year.=20
"It is not that there is going to be a fire sale but most of [the internati=
onal assets] are not core to the businesses we will continue to pursue," sa=
id an Enron spokesperson. "At the right price we will sell."=20
Scottish & Southern Energy and United Utilities have been touted as potenti=
al buyers, yet industry insiders believe that the UK regulator, Ofwat, will=
 take a dim view of bids by UK water companies, as they are too large to bu=

Quanta steels itself against takeover bid

(Copyright 2001)

Quanta Services, which builds and maintains power and communications lines,=
 said Friday it is fighting a "creeping takeover" by UtiliCorp United, one =
of the nation's largest utility holding companies.=20
On Thursday Quanta board members changed the Houston company's shareholder =
rights agreement - called a "poison pill" defense against takeovers - to de=
ter UtiliCorp from acquiring a controlling stake.
The action was taken after negotiations with UtiliCorp fell apart and the K=
ansas City, Mo.-based company announced its intention to resume purchases o=
f Quanta stock.=20
A spokesman told Bloomberg News on Oct. 4 that UtiliCorp wanted to increase=
 its stake to the mid-40s percentage range, which would give it effective c=
ontrol, with a vote on management.=20
UtiliCorp invested $320 million in Quanta from September of 1999 through Fe=
bruary of 2000, said UtiliCorp spokesman Ethan Hirsh, bringing its ownershi=
p up to 28 percent, and has been adding stock since then. It owned about 38=
 percent when a standstill agreement stopped further purchases in early Oct=
ober.=20
Part of the shareholder rights amendment limits further purchases by Quanta=
 by reducing the trigger point for the poison pill to 39 percent of Quanta'=

AT ENRON, THE BIG DOGS ATE FIRST

Summary: Workers' ire over 401(k) plans is understandable=20
Watching Enron's bigwigs lose their jobs after inflating profits may offer =
some satisfaction to retirees and employees at the troubled energy marketer=
. But don't bank on it.
When corporate insiders can sell the company and stroll away with millions =
while workers and other stockholders are left with peanuts, it would be har=
d not to be bitter.=20
As Oregonian business writer Jeff Manning reported Friday, local employees =
of Portland General Electric, an Enron subsidiary, watched their retirement=
 savings sink after Enron announced on Oct. 16 that it would lose $618 mill=
ion in the fourth quarter. This came after Enron officers made more than $1=
36 million selling stocks earlier in the year.=20
Then on Nov. 8, Enron dropped the other shoe: It admitted it had overstated=
 earnings for four years by $586 million, or 20 percent. Over those few wee=
ks, Enron shares plunged from $33.84 to its $9 close on Friday.=20
The four-year overstatement developed through some novel accounting methods=
. Enron and its auditor, Arthur Anderson, insist that its financial reports=
 were all within proper standards, but the mechanics in this case included =
obscuring debt by placing it on the ledgers of other entities so that the p=
arent company's profit picture appeared rosier than it actually was.=20
The weeks from mid-October to early November were wrenching for employees. =
Because the company was changing its fund manager, they were powerless to m=
ake any changes in their 401(k) plans. PGE chief executive Peggy Fowler poi=
nts out that the change in 401(k) plan managers was announced last summer. =
And although employees could have gotten out of Enron stocks over the histo=
ry of the plan, Enron seemed to be an attractive investment.=20
Company executives, though, were selling. Jeffrey Skilling, who was promote=
d to Enron chief executive early in the year but resigned in August, sold m=
ore than $5 million in company shares according to transaction records cove=
ring the first half of the year.=20
Former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, who was fired last month in =
an action related to the financial mess, made $14 million in stock sales be=
tweeen March and November of last year. Kenneth Lay, Enron's chief executiv=
e, who returned after his protege Skilling left, made at least $20 million =
in stock sales from late last year. He has announced that he would decline =
his severance package.=20
Dynegy, another Texas energy marketing company, has made a bid to buy Enron=
. That probably means the best Enron and PGE employees can hope for now is =
that Dynegy will be a better corporate owner, or they can try their luck wi=
th one of the many shareholder lawsuits being filed.=20
The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Enron's activities.=
 If its behavior was illegal, there will be consequences for company office=
rs.=20
That's still not much to offer to workers who have seen their retirement sa=
vings dissolve. But for now it's all there is.

FINANCE WEEK - From dealing to reeling.
By BARRY RILEY.

FINANCE WEEK - From dealing to reeling - The legacy of the late 1990s stock=
 market bubble remains with us, as does irrationality THE LONG VIEW - BARRY=
 RILEY.=20
Optimism is back. Stock markets around the globe have typically rallied by =
20 per cent since rock bottom was reached on September 21. Only 9 per cent =
of global fund managers believe equities will be lower in 12 months, accord=
ing to a Merrill Lynch survey published this week.
But the legacy of the late 1990s stock market bubble remains with us. The c=
hallenge is how to minimise the level of irrationality. Two of the UK's big=
gest losers from crazy prices reported on Tuesday. Vodafone suffered #11.45=
bn of write-downs - but curiously, made no provisions against the sky-high =
#13.1bn it paid for third-generation mobile phone licences in 2000.=20
Such payments, argued Sir Christopher Gent, Voda-fone's chief executive, we=
re merely what the market demanded at the time. It is interesting to note, =
too, that Paul Klemperer, the Oxford professor who is an expert in "auction=
 theory" and advised the British government, has defended the disastrous ou=
tcome by arguing that the prices reflected the capital market's view of 3G'=
s prospects. The common theme here is that it is nobody's fault if crazy pr=
ices are paid, because they are legitimised by the stock market.=20
Marconi, which is financially in a much worse state than the mobile phone g=
iant, has written off most of the #4.1bn paid for US internet hardware comp=
anies in 1999. There has also been a great deal of controversy in the US du=
ring the past few weeks over the near-collapse of Enron, the power group be=
ing rescued by a takeover bid from its smaller rival Dynegy. There was an o=
bvious failure by investors - and by stock market analysts - to assess the =
true risks at Enron.=20
Smart businessmen will sellat mad prices, but why on earth should they buy?=
 The trouble is, too many academics have developed theories of value based =
on rational expectations. The real world is unfortunately very different.=
=20
Some of the distortions had obvious technical origins. The Vodafone bubble =
of 1999 reflected the cross-border takeover of Mannesmann and the artificia=
l weighting shortages that developed from that transaction as Vodafone ball=
ooned in market capitalisation to reach, at one stage, 16 per cent of the F=
TSE 100 Index. The market price was driven not by normal corporate fundamen=
tals, but by the desire of most fund managers to reach a market weighting, =
at which point they were "safe" in terms of risk against the index benchmar=
k.=20
That was the period when investment banks exploited the idea of low free-fl=
oat new issues: internet companies, especially, were floated off with only =
15 per cent of the stock made available, although anything up to 100 per ce=
nt went into the indices, creating serious shortages and bubble valuations.=
 Changes now being made to the main stock market indices have reduced the p=
roblem, but there remains a basic irrationality in the concept that investm=
ent risk resides in an index rather than in the underlying stocks.=20
Takeovers have always been plagued by irrationality, and indeed this is an =
area where academics recognise the problem; over many years they have point=
ed out that all the benefits of deals, and often more than all, accrue to t=
he shareholders of the companies taken over, while investors in the bidding=
 companies suffer dilution. Investors know this, and in normal market condi=
tions news of a takeover will depress the bidder's share price. But in a bu=
bble market these prudent attitudes can be overwhelmed by euphoria, as well=
 as technical factors relating to demand by fund managers so that they can =
maintain their weightings when a bidder is spraying around large quantities=
 of new equity.=20
Also, it is irrational that many more deals are done when the stock market =
is high than when it is low. Two years ago, companies such as Marconi were =
engaged in buying sprees at daft prices. Now, when prices are much lower, h=
ardly any acquisitions are being made (and investment banks are dismissing =
thousands of employees). An exception to the deal famine is gold mining, wh=
ich just happens to have been one of the stock market's strongest sectors t=
his year.=20
Another important source of irrationality has been the domination of stock =
market analysis by the stockbroking offshoots of the investment banks. Over=
 recent years their earnings-per-share forecasts for the next calendar year=
 have been on average 8 per cent too high. This has not just been a mistake=
; they have been paid to be over-optimistic. Admittedly, attempts are being=
 made to restructure the incentives here, as the embarrassed investment ban=
ks come under pressure from the regulators and the courts for their errors =
of judgment during the bull market, but it remains to be seen whether much =
will really change.=20
The mystery is why anybody would take notice of these forecasts, and indeed=
 many professional investors do not. That Merrill survey, incidentally, sho=
ws that fund managers on average expect no more than 4 per cent earnings pe=
r share growth over the next year, while the stockbrokers' analysts are sti=
ll clinging to the hope that it will be 15 per cent.=20
A final source of distortion is the tendency of companies to offer their ex=
ecutives the wrong sort of incentives. The ruin of Marconi may appear irrat=
ional, when multi-billion-pound acquisitions are being declared worthless a=
fter only two years. But executives with lucrative stock option plans, whic=
h pay off if their gambles go right, combined with golden goodbye and pensi=
on packages that are triggered if things go wrong, may well consider it per=
fectly rational, from their viewpoint, to take much bigger risks than other=
 shareholders, or employees, would consider acceptable.=20
Moreover, Sir Christopher Gent, shareholders of Vodafone will remember, rec=
eived a controversial #10m personal bonus last year for clinching the Manne=
smann takeover, a deal that requires #10bn of write-offs.=20
In normal market conditions the valuation of equities may be tolerably rati=
onal, but in a bubble market the rules are thrown out of the window. Many i=
nvestors certainly like the idea of getting rich quickly. That is why many =
people subscribe so keenly to national lotteries in which the chance of win=
ning is so small as to be not worth rational consideration.=20

Enron Investors Hope Filing Will Shed More Light on Finances
2001-11-17 11:06 (New York)

Enron Investors Hope Filing Will Shed More Light on Finances

     Houston, Nov. 17 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. investors hope
the energy trader's third-quarter report to the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission will answer some of the questions that
sent its shares tumbling and led to a proposed sale to rival
Dynegy Inc.

     Enron, which has been criticized for failing to clearly
explain how it makes money, may disclose in Monday's filing more
on how much is owed by the company and affiliated partnerships, as
well as any planned job cuts and other cost-saving moves related
to Dynegy's $24 billion buyout.

     ``Investors will be looking for anything that affects the
likelihood of the (Dynegy) deal going through and the timing of
such a deal,'' said Edward Paik, who helps manage the Liberty
Utilities Fund, which owns 1.6 million in Enron shares.

     Enron agreed to sell after its stock plunged 67 percent in
three weeks amid an SEC investigation into partnerships run by
Enron executives. Investors worry that new disclosures, such as
previously unreported debt, might threaten Enron's credit rating
and scuttle the merger, possibly pushing Enron into bankruptcy.

     ``There's been so much skepticism about what Enron's
liabilities are with these partnerships, I'm looking to quantify
this,'' said Glen Hilton, a fund manager at Montgomery Asset
Management LP, which holds Dynegy shares.

     Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay admitted last week that failed
investments and a loss of investor confidence forced the sale to
Dynegy, and he and other executives pledged to be more open with
investors. Lay, 59, said last week he won't accept a severance
package of more than $60 million that he could have collected
following the takeover.

     Enron shares fell 48 cents yesterday to $9. Dynegy fell
$1.53, or 3.5 percent, to $42.47.

                           Balance Sheet

     Enron's third-quarter report, which had been expected last
week, was delayed by the Dynegy talks and a restatement of
earnings, Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon said. Enron
reduced net income for four years by a combined $586 million to
include losses from affiliated partnerships.

     Monday's filing, called a 10-Q, will include a balance sheet
summarizing assets and debts. Enron for years has omitted balance
sheets, which the SEC requires as part of the 10-Q, from its press
releases announcing earnings.

     Investors renewed their criticisms of the practice after Lay
mentioned during a conference call last month that dealings with
two partnerships had reduced Enron's shareholder equity, or its
assets minus liabilities, by $1.2 billion. The disclosure led to
the ouster of Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow.

     ``Everyone is trying to make their own assessment of what
(Enron's) ultimate liability will need to be,'' said Commerzbank
Securities analyst Andre Meade, who rates the shares ``hold'' and
doesn't own them.

     Monday's report probably won't give a complete answer, said
Louis Gagliardi, an analyst at John S. Herold Inc. While the
balance sheet will list liabilities for the partnerships, which
were set up to buy Enron assets and get debt off the company's
books, it won't spell out Enron's share, he said.

     ``What is the net liability off the balance sheet?''
Gagliardi said. ``We really don't know what that number is.''

                           Credit Rating

     Dynegy has said it can back out of the acquisition if Enron's
legal liabilities exceed $3.5 billion. The balance sheet ``will
help us see how good a deal this is for Dynegy,'' said Kathleen
Vuchetich, co-manager of the $1.4 billion Strong American
Utilities Fund, which owns 284,000 Dynegy shares.

     Both companies are based in Houston.

     The filing also might offer details on the SEC probe. ``It
may say what the SEC is looking for, and what the rating agencies
have told them,'' said Christopher Ellinghaus, an analyst at
Williams Capital Group. He added, though, ``I don't expect much.''

     Enron's stock drop led Moody's Investors Service to cut the
company's debt rating to the lowest investment grade. Dynegy held
off on a purchase agreement out of concern that the rating would
be cut to junk, jeopardizing Enron's ability to raise cash needed
to settle its daily power and natural-gas trades.

     Enron may reveal where it expects to cut jobs and how much it
will pay to departing employees, Paik said. Chief Operating
Officer Greg Whalley said last week that fourth-quarter profit
will be hurt by severance payments and reorganization costs. He
didn't give details.

     Jobs likely will be eliminated in businesses the company
plans to sell, including its money-losing telecommunications unit
and operations in Europe, analysts said.

     Enron has about 21,000 employees, two-thirds in the U.S. and
about a fifth in the U.K. Its 600 traders are divided between
London and Houston, where Enron employs about 7,500.

     Many Enron workers are already preparing for layoffs, said
Lyndon Taylor, a Houston-based recruiter for Heidrick & Struggles
International Inc., an executive placement firm.

     ``I got 56 resumes last week from Enron,'' Taylor said.
``That's equal to the number I got in the past year.''

U.S. oil companies are setting up shop all over downtown, usually picking h=
igh-quality office space with lots of open space. Anadarko Petroleum Corp. =
is located at Fifth Avenue Place, Burlington Resources Inc. is in Bow Valle=
y Square and Devon Energy Corp. is in Canterra Tower. Some end up in the of=
fices of the companies they acquire. Conoco Inc. has moved into Gulf Canada=
 Square.=20
The big takeover wave has led to a reshuffling of downtown space. Today, th=
ere is a shortage of large spaces and an increase in small ones available f=
or sublease.
Some would like to get the towers they occupy named after them but landlord=
s resist this because naming a building after one tenant can be a disincent=
ive for others.=20
Oilmen's favourite hangout is the Calgary Petroleum Club, founded by U.S. a=
nd Canadian oilmen in 1948 in the Palliser Hotel. Members have reciprocal m=
embership at the Petroleum Club of Houston. But Calgary's Pete Club is a ba=
rgain compared to its Texas counterpart. The initiation fee in Calgary is $=
2,000, monthly dues are $65 and the minimum amount members must spend in a =
year is $600. The initiation fee for full membership at the Petroleum Club =
of Houston is US$3,500, monthly dues are US$110 and the minimum house accou=
nt is US$75 per quarter.=20
U.S. executives running Canadian oil and gas operations earn substantially =
more than their Canadian counterparts because their compensation is competi=
tive with the U.S. market.=20
When U.S. oil companies purchase Canadian operations, they like to keep as =
much of the Canadian staff as possible, since they are even more aware than=
 their Canadian rivals of the "war for talent."=20
When recruiting locally, U.S. firms pay competitively but of course will pa=
y what they must to get the best candidate. They also offer competitive ben=
efits and stock-option plans. U.S. employers gulp at the generous holidays =
enjoyed by Canadian oilpatch employees.=20
There's no American neighbourhood in Calgary, although many recent arrivals=
 are buying homes close to the city's core, particularly in such high-end n=
eighbourhoods as Mount Royal, Elbow Park and Britannia, where homes sell fo=
r $500,000 to $2-million.=20
Some U.S. companies purchase condominiums in such areas as Eau Claire on th=
e Bow River to house U.S. executives in transit.=20
Ted Zaharko, a broker-owner with Royal LePage, says Americans are driven by=
 lifestyle choices and the fact that they can afford to buy expensive homes=
. Living near other Americans isn't important.=20
The cost of living is lower in Calgary than in many comparable U.S. cities.=
 However, U.S. cities become more competitive for high-income earners becau=
se personal income taxes in Canada are higher than in the U.S. at the highe=
r income levels. Offsetting factors include access to health care, clean ai=
r, a short commute to work and the nearby mountain playground, which tend t=
o be important to affluent people.=20
U.S. oil types may have strange accents -- many come from the southern stat=
es -- but oilpatch jargon is pretty much the same. Calgarians and Americans=
 understand one another when they talk of dry holes (no discovery), wildcat=

WestLB Offers to Buy Enron's U.K. Water Unit, Newspaper Says
2001-11-17 20:01 (New York)


     London, Nov. 18 (Bloomberg) -- Westdeutsche Landesbank
Girozentrale, Germany's largest state-owned bank, is one of
several suitors talking to Enron Corp. about its Wessex Water
unit, which is valued at more than 1 billion pounds ($1.4
billion), the Sunday Telegraph said without citing sources.

     Dynegy Inc. of the U.S. is looking to buy Enron for $24
billion, and will sell some of its assets, including Wessex.
WestLB made a formal offer to Enron in the past few days in hopes
of striking a quick deal because Dynegy may want to avoid the
regulatory risk in such a sale; any bid for a water company in the
U.K. worth at least 30 million pounds must be referred to the
Competition Commission, the newspaper said.

     Enron bought Wessex for 1.4 billion pounds in 1998. RWE AG of
Germany, Europe's fourth-biggest power company, is also interested
in Wessex, but Enron thinks U.K. regulators won't approve an RWE
bid because the company already owns Thames Water, a large U.K.
water company.

     WestLB has also been reported to be preparing a buyout for
Railtrack Group Plc, the insolvent owner of the U.K.'s train
tracks and stations, the paper said.


Enron Closes on $550 Million Loan From J.P. Morgan, Salomon

Enron Closes on $550 Million Loan From J.P. Morgan, Salomon

     Houston, Nov. 16 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. closed Wednesday
on a $550 million loan from J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Salomon
Smith Barney Inc. that was secured with assets of its Transwestern
Pipeline Co., spokesman Vance Meyer said.

     Enron, the largest energy trader, said Nov. 1 that it had
received a commitment for $1 billion in loans from the investment
banks that would be used for debt payments and to supplement cash
reserves.

     Enron secured the loans with the assets of Transwestern and
the Northern Natural Gas Co. The two pipeline systems combined are
about 19,000 miles long and can deliver as much as 6 billion cubic
feet of gas a day. The remaining $450 million loan, secured with
the Northern Natural Gas assets, is in the documentation stage and
is expected to close next week, Meyer said.

     Enron agreed a week ago to be acquired by Dynegy Inc. in a
transaction now valued at $24.7 billion in stock and assumed debt.
The move followed a loss in investor confidence -- the company's
shares had fallen 90 percent this year -- and amid a federal
investigation of accounting irregularities that limited its
ability to finance operations.

     ChevronTexaco Corp., the second-biggest U.S. oil company and
Dynegy's largest shareholder with 26 percent, provided Enron,
through Dynegy, with a $1.5 billion cash infusion on Tuesday as
part of the buyout agreement.

     In return, Dynegy acquired preferred stock and other rights
in the Enron unit that owns Northern Natural Gas. If the merger
isn't completed, Dynegy will have the right to acquire Northern
Natural Gas, Enron said in regulatory filing Wednesday.
ChevronTexaco will provide Dynegy with another $1 billion after
the merger closes to maintain its equity stake.

     The shares of Enron fell 48 cents to $9, while shares of
Dynegy fell $1.53 to $42.47. Both companies are based in Houston.
Shares of San Francisco-based ChevronTexaco fell 35 cents to
$83.45.

USA: Enron disclosed insider data to some investors-NYT.

01/25/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

NEW YORK, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. executives enticed wealthy investors in one of the partnerships that helped wreck the company with the prospect that inside knowledge could help double their money in months, the online edition of the New York Times reported on Friday. 
Confidential records of an Enron partnership called LJM2 show company executives offering potential investors inside knowledge about Enron and its off-the-books holdings, information that they denied company shareholders, the Times said.
Neither Enron nor Merrill Lynch and Co. Inc. , which underwrote the LJM2 offering, were immediately available to comment on the story. 
Dozens of banks, brokerage firms, pension funds and institutional investors were approached to invest in LJM2 just over two years ago, and all were provided with the confidential data about the extent of Enron's off-balance-sheet dealings, but could not share the information with their brokerage clients, according to the Times. 
The LJM2 partnership was set up, in part, to invest in entities that Enron controlled and to purchase investments that Enron did not want on its books, the Times said. 
"Enron frequently has access to investment opportunities that are not available to other investors," the Times quotes the private placement memorandum for LJM2.

Enron may get new boss 
Candidate talking with directors, creditors 
By DAVID IVANOVICH 
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle 
Jan. 25, 2002, 1:43AM
WASHINGTON -- A candidate tapped by Enron's board of directors and largest creditors to assume the company's helm will meet with Enron managers as early as today. 
Moving quickly to fill the void left after the departure of Chairman Ken Lay, the board and creditors committee were known to be talking with Stephen Cooper, managing principal at Zolfo Cooper, a New York-based corporate-recovery and crisis-management firm. 
Cooper served as chief restructuring officer at Ontario-based Laidlaw Inc., the largest ground transportation company in North America and owner of Greyhound Lines. 
Previously, Cooper was a partner in the accounting firm Touche Ross & Co. 
Cooper could not be reached for immediate comment Thursday night. And Martin Bienenstock, an attorney with Weil, Gotshal & Manges representing Enron in its bankruptcy case, declined to say whether Cooper is indeed the front-runner for the job. 
Whether he actually gets the job will depend on how the meetings with Enron's remaining executives go today, Bienenstock said. 
Corporate turnaround experts say Enron will need an executive with enough credibility to stem the scandals swirling around the company and stave off an effort to persuade U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Arthur Gonzalez to order the appointment of a trustee to run the company. 
"A Rudy Guiliani, that's what's called for, somebody of that stature," said one corporate restructuring expert who asked not to be named. "Or a George Mitchell." 
Guiliani, the former mayor of New York, drew high marks for his leadership in the wake of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. Mitchell, a former senator from Maine, helped negotiate a peace accord in Northern Ireland. 
While not identifying the individual, Bienenstock called the board and creditor committee's candidate "a very, very solid citizen." 
Cooper is not well-known in Houston's energy sector. 
"Understanding Greyhound is a lot different from understanding Enron," said one energy industry observer. "The energy industry is many times more complex, and the Enron version of that is even more complex." 
Carol Coale, a Houston-based natural gas analyst at Prudential Securities, doesn't think the search for a new boss at Enron should range outside the energy industry. 
"The energy industry is diverse enough where you could find the right person that has knowledge of energy," Coale said. "I don't see what the advantages are of going outside." 
John Olson, an energy analyst with Sanders Morris Harris in Houston, was not surprised Enron's board and creditors were shopping outside the sector. 
"What you need is somebody who has been totally removed," Olson said. The company's new turnaround expert needs to be a "debt management guy who can restructure the debt and who also knows all about the derivatives books, which clearly requires some expertise in voodoo." 
Lay, whose name for years has been synonymous with the staid natural gas pipeline company he transformed into an energy and trading powerhouse, stepped down late Wednesday at the creditors' urging. 
"I want to see Enron survive, and for that to happen we need someone at the helm who can focus 100 percent of his efforts on reorganizing the company," Lay said. "Unfortunately, with the multiple inquiries and investigations that currently require much of my time, it is becoming increasingly difficult to concentrate fully on what is most important to Enron stakeholders." 
The creditors' committee, in a prepared statement, said it was pleased by Lay's exit. "This is a step in the right direction, to maximize value for all creditors," it said. "The committee is also encouraged that Enron is proceeding with the retention of a chief restructuring officer." 
By naming a chief restructuring officer, Enron's board and creditors clearly are hoping to head off the appointment of a trustee. 
Trustees traditionally are known for breaking up rather than resuscitating debt-laden companies. A trustee also would call all the shots at the company, superseding the role of the board and the company management. 
A group of Enron creditors, led by Dallas-based Wiser Oil Co., are pushing for just such an appointment. 
To persuade a bankruptcy court to name a trustee, Wiser and its allies would have to find enough evidence to demonstrate fraud, mismanagement or incompetence. 


Enron's new CEO could could be savior or victim
By KRISTEN HAYS

HOUSTON (AP) - Kenneth Lay's successor as Enron Corp.'s chief executive could be the hero who saves the bankrupt energy giant or a well-intentioned outsider blindsided by yet-unseen punches. 
"In a sense, it provides a big showcase for your talents," said Henry T.C. Hu, a corporate law professor at the University of Texas. "Presumably you could think the bulk of the bad has come out. But one is not entirely sure."
But anyone willing to take the chance - or seize the opportunity - likely has a thick skin, he said. 
'Any time you're dealing with bankruptcy proceedings and distress situations, you've already developed a lot of callouses," Hu said. "You don't feel it anymore." 
Lay resigned as chairman and chief executive Wednesday, saying the multitude of lawsuits and investigations into Enron's spectacular collapse in an accounting scandal is preventing him from properly running the company. 
Enron said it will search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim chief executive and help the company survive the biggest bankruptcy in history. 
"They're going to need someone with a specialization in these situations that can devote 100 percent of his time to business matters of the company," said Mike Greenberger, a law professor at the University of Maryland. "It's impossible to deal with Congress and the Justice Department and try to resuscitate a company at the same time." 
Lay, 59, will remain on Enron's board. Enron spokesman Vance Meyer said he will not receive a severance package. 
Lay was chairman and CEO for almost all of the 16 years since the company was created from a 1985 merger of two natural gas pipeline companies. In that time Enron grew from a mildly profitable business into the world's largest energy marketer. It diversified its trading to include pulp, paper and bandwidth, among other commodities. 
Enron reached No. 7 on the Fortune 500 and earned hundreds millions in reported profits while concocting financial partnerships that allowed the company to keep half a billion dollars in debt off its books. 
Last year, the accounting practice was exposed, and Enron's stock slid to less than a dollar from about $80. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and thousands of Enron employees lost their jobs, as well as much of their life savings, since their 401(k) accounts were loaded with company stock. 
Congress, the Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and others are investigating. Lay and the company face numerous lawsuits and increasing criticism from employees, shareholders and politicians demanding answers as to how Enron could implode so savagely. 
William Brandt Jr., president and chief executive of Development Specialists, a Chicago-based firm that helps distressed businesses rebound, said Enron's next CEO could be a trustee appointed by the judge overseeing the bankruptcy in New York. 
A trustee would answer to the judge rather than Enron's board or its creditors, Brandt said. A showing of fraud, mismanagement or incompetence of previous management traditionally supports the appointment of a trustee. 
Hu said that if Enron ends up appointing a CEO, it must be someone who inspires confidence without expecting the typical perks of top executives, such as stock options. 
The lure would be the reputation boost that would come from saving a company from such a huge, controversial downfall, he said. 
"There's a lot more laughter and mirth when you're an obstetrician rather than when you're a coroner," Hu said. "And here, you're a coroner. It's an enormously difficult task. And everybody's looking over your shoulder."

Lay's exit prompts mixed reactions 
Amid praise for ex-CEO, many say his departure is overdue 
By MARY VUONG

Jan. 25, 2002, 12:03AM
Overdue. Appropriate. Best for the company. 
Those were the thoughts of some former Enron employees on Ken Lay's resignation as chairman and chief executive officer of Enron. 
Respected. Upstanding. Personable. 
Those were the words they used to describe the man, as they waited Thursday for relief from a fund set up for former employees. 
"Everybody saw him as sort of a grandfatherly figure," said Steve Crumley, a former manager with the broadband unit. A man you looked up to and trusted, Lay "had a good head on his shoulders," added Crumley, 43, of The Woodlands. 
"Very caring, very giving, very personable -- maybe just like the guy next door," said Nathan Childs, 36, of Kempner, who was a technician for the information technology hardware department. 
"All of us thought very highly of Ken Lay," said Helena G. Payne, a senior accounting clerk before retiring last March after 24 years. She lost her 401(k) funds following Enron's collapse. 
Payne, 61, said she occasionally met Lay when he strolled through departments or at special breakfasts on the 50th floor in which about a dozen employees discussed grievances with him. 
"He had an open-door-type atmosphere," and made sure his managers and directors did the same, she said. 
Juantongia Calvin, who worked in global management, held Lay in the "highest regards" before Enron's collapse. She still does, she said. 
He took care of employees, and his community activism pushed her to get involved as well, said Calvin, 30, of Houston. "He was one of the most respected persons I had ever met or worked for." 
Lay was not a mysterious figure nor did he ride in his own private elevator, recalled former accounting specialist Sue Nix, yet he was hardly someone you bumped into in the cafeteria. 
Nix, 57, a Huffman resident, said she encountered Lay on the elevator regularly. "He would talk to you just as if you were as important as anybody else." 
In one elevator ride, Nix said, Lay showed her two grandsons -- who had accompanied her to work -- how to piece together a puzzle. 
"It proved he was human," she said. "I always was very proud when (people) spoke of Ken Lay." 
Nix said her view of Lay "hasn't really changed. So much blame has been put on his shoulders." 
Several of those interviewed said their perceptions of Lay have shifted, albeit not very dramatically. He is to blame for some of Enron's failure, although how much is not yet clear to them, they said. 
They believe other executives and senior managers are responsible, too, such as former CEO Jeffrey Skilling and former Chief Financial Officer Andy Fastow. 
"I feel like maybe (Lay) was influenced by the wrong type of people," Payne said. 
"I thought (Lay) was a really wonderful man," said Kimberly Niekamp, a former accounting specialist. "I thought it was all (Skilling's fault)." 
Now, Niekamp, 38, of Humble said, she doesn't know what to say or think of Lay. "A terrible person," she offered in a questioning tone. 
There is a sense that maybe he was greedy, disconnected and too focused on the political process, said Crumley, adding, "He should've focused more on the realities of running the business." 
Calvin said Lay could have prevented Enron's failure, but that others could have as well. 
"I blame the people responsible for taking the millions," Childs said. 
Whether Enron can return to its previous glory is questionable or unlikely, some said. 
"I'm not sure that it (Lay's resignation) is going to help Enron get back on its feet," Crumley said, but restoring the company "would be tough with him at the helm." 
Payne said it was necessary Lay resign to handle all the lawsuits and it was best for the company to move forward. 
"I don't look for Enron to come back as Enron," Nix said.

Ex-staffers say Enron division inflated profits

A division of Enron Corp. overstated its profits by hundreds of millions of dollars over the past three years, and senior Enron executives were warned almost a year ago that the division's profits were illusory, according to several former employees. 
The division, Enron Energy Services, created in 1997, competed with utilities to sell electricity and natural gas to commercial and industrial customers. It was run by Lou Pai, who sold $353 million in Enron stock in the past three years, more than any other Enron executive, and Thomas White, who left Enron to become secretary of the Army last June.
Energy Services accounted for a small part of Enron's revenues but was promoted by the company as a big growth opportunity. 
But former employees suggest that Energy Services used shoddy accounting practices to create "illusory earnings," in the words of Jeff Gray, who joined Enron in 2000 and worked at the division for most of 2001. 
For example, by estimating that the price of electricity would fall in the future, Enron could book an immediate profit on a contract. By contrast, companies using traditional accounting book profits only as they deliver the services. 
A spokesman for White did not return calls for comment. Pai and a spokesman for Enron also did not return calls. 
Peggy Mahoney, a spokeswoman for Energy Services, said the division's financial results had accurately reflected its business. "It was no pie in the sky," she said. 
As a result of its practice of projecting profits, Energy Services salespeople and senior managers pressured the managers who made the key assumptions about deregulation and energy prices, said Glenn Dickson, a manager at Energy Services who was dismissed in December. 
"The whole culture was much more sales driven than anything else," Dickson said. "The people that were having to sign off on the deals with a gun to their head knew that it wasn't a good deal." 
Dickson and other former employees said senior executives at Energy Services knew that their assumptions were unreliable. 
At the same time, expenses ballooned as Energy Services found that the costs of managing its contracts were higher than it had projected. 
"They knew how to get a product out there, but they didn't know how to run a business," said Tony Dorazio, a former product development manager at Energy Services. 
None of the ex-employees said they knew whether Pai or White was aware of any accounting lapses at Energy Services.

HOUSTON -- The Enron Corp.'s ex-workers will take center stage Friday as the Rev. Jesse Jackson holds a rally in their honor. 
The rally will be held at noon Friday at the Antioch Missionary Baptist Church, which is across the street from Enron's headquarters in downtown. 
Jackson said that Houston-area ministers and members of his Rainbow Coalition will unite in prayer as a sign of support to help rally for financial assistance for the Enron employees left jobless and with shriveled 401(k) accounts, which were mostly invested in the now bankrupt company. 
"(The laid-off workers) hands were tied behind their backs as their life's savings went down the river," Jackson said. 
Jackson tried to meet with former Enron Chief Financial Officer Kenneth Lay Thursday night, but was turned away. 
Lay's secretary said that he didn't have time to meet with Jackson. 
But Lay told Jackson that he had a family emergency. 
"It's not personal," Jackson said. 
Before the rally, Jackson met with business and community leaders to see what more could be done for the fired workers.

Enron's fall piques Congress' interest in 401(k) rules
Michael Tackett, Tribune senior correspondent

01/25/2002
Chicago Tribune
North Sports Final ; N

(Copyright 2002 by the Chicago Tribune)

On Dec. 21, 1999, in Enron's chest-puffing days, the company churned out a press release to tout its status as one of Fortune magazine's "100 best companies to work for in America." 
"Our corporate culture and our world-class employees make Enron a great place to work," said Kenneth Lay, the company's chairman and chief executive officer. "We are proud to receive recognition as a top workplace; it's a reflection of our commitment to our employees and their key role in our company's success."
Now Lay has resigned, and Enron Corp.'s commitment to employees, especially its retirement savings plans, is under high-profile congressional scrutiny. And the story of how many Enron workers watched their 401(k) plans, the savings programs designed to ensure a comfortable retirement, become nearly worthless is sparking a broader debate on the potent political issue of retirement security. 
Some lawmakers and pension specialists are wondering if the Enron case will be for the 401(k) plan what the Studebaker case of nearly 40 years ago was to more traditional company pension plans. In the Studebaker case, workers were shocked to find their pension benefits were not guaranteed when the company terminated the plan in 1963. 
That case prompted Congress to eventually pass the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, establishing among other things a government guarantee of defined-benefit pension plans. But those protections do not apply to 401(k) plans, which have dramatically overtaken traditional pensions in number in the last 15 years. 
"I've watched this go from a backwater technical issue no one paid attention to, to now being one of the core issues people think of," said Rep. Earl Pomeroy (D-N.D.), a leading pension authority in Congress. "As a result, the politics behind it have grown hotly charged as well. 
"This is a mixed blessing. The good news is Congress is now interested," Pomeroy said. "The bad news is Congress is now interested. This is an area where ill-advised, well-intentioned legislation can do some serious damage." 
Even before the hearings started, several legislative proposals have been introduced. One, by Sens. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and Jon Corzine (D-N.J.), would limit employee contributions in company stock to 20 percent of the total and employees could convert any matching company stock to another financial instrument within 90 days. To reduce the appeal of granting a match in stock, the legislation also would cut tax breaks for matching company stock in half. 
Another proposal, offered by Rep. Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.), calls for a federal tax penalty on sales of stock by company insiders if other lower-ranking employees are restricted. 
The federal government can only loosely regulate most employee benefits because companies provide them on a voluntary basis. And, as workers often come to find, companies almost universally reserve the right to change, amend or terminate any or all of those benefits. 
Buffet of benefits 
Businesses are far more likely, however, to emphasize benefits as an inducement to sign on and stay with a company. Enron's employee handbook, for instance, lays out a rich buffet of benefits in addition to the 401(k) plan: a stock options plan that awarded up to 25 percent of salary in Enron stock options; subsidized membership at The Body Shop fitness center, complete with tai chi and Pilates classes; and an on-site doctor's office. 
Like many companies, Enron also offered a 401(k) savings plan, listing its stock as the first option of many investment funds available. The company matched each $1 an employee contributed with 50 cents worth of Enron stock. 
Those who chose the Enron option were rewarded famously as the stock value soared. But as Enron's stock plummeted, they learned the crushing reality of the risk inherent in 401(k) plans. The plaintive stories of families whose retirement savings were wiped out will no doubt be told during the hearings. 
Congress is likely to respond in some fashion, and Pomeroy and others are concerned that lawmakers could actually set back the cause of retirement security. For instance, if Congress were to regulate 401(k) plans too heavily, companies might choose to not offer them, putting workers' retirement finances in even greater peril. 
Companies also could choose to provide no match. Indeed, as salaried workers at Ford Motor Co. found recently, that company match is voluntary and Ford suspended its contribution to 401(k) plans for 2002. What's more, the government can guarantee a pension plan because it is not based on an employee making an investment decision. Similar protection for a 401(k) plan would be tantamount to the government guaranteeing an ever-rising rate of return. 
Defined-benefit plans, promising a certain amount of money for life upon retirement, are far more easily regulated than 401(k) plans, whose results depend on market forces and individual choices. In the last 10 years, most 401(k) plans clearly increased in value that would have far exceeded defined-benefit plans. 
Shifting of risk 
But it is also true that most companies, desirous of having employees control large blocks of stock, encourage investment in company stock. When that stock goes down in value, the risk of the investment becomes harshly clear. 
The number of American workers covered by some form of pension plan has remained nearly constant for 25 years, at about 50 percent of the private sector labor force. But over that time, the number covered by 401(k), or defined-contribution, plans has far exceeded those covered by the more traditional defined-benefit plans. With that move has also come a shifting of risk, from the employer to the employee. 
"The shift from the defined-benefit plan to the defined- contribution plan has left employees with a great deal more exposure than they had under traditional pension plans," Pomeroy said. "And, to my knowledge, Congress has never had a hearing on this great shift." 
That may well be about to change. And there are those who are pushing for Congress to take a more aggressive stance. For one, Karen Friedman, director of policy strategies of the Pension Rights Center in Washington, said Congress should "enact protections to see that Enron doesn't happen again." 
"One big question that this raises is: Are we, in this society, overreliant on the 401(k) plan and other non-insured savings plans?" Friedman said. "We think this is the perfect time to have that debate. We've been warning of the perils of 401(k) plans for years and years. Maybe 401s were great in a bull market. The question is, are they the right plan in today's market?" 
For now, how that question will be answered falls to Congress. 
"You know Congress is going to be looking for one," Pomeroy said, "or if not one, a darned good press release."

Enron: The Fallout
The history of a head-spinning conglomerate: Wall Street darling: Enron trader was an unregulated commodities exchange

WASHINGTON - Enron may have got its start in the lunch-bucket industry of natural gas pipelines, but in its glory days as the seventh-largest company in the United States it claimed it had rewritten the laws of economics by using the power of the Internet. 
But like the high-flying dot.coms it emulated, the company came crashing down to earth, felled by a suspect business model and crooked accounting on an eye-popping scale.
While employees in Houston lament their vanished retirement savings and Washington goes into scandal mode, law enforcement officials, politicians and financial regulators are trying to piece together what went wrong and why. 
It all began so simply. 
In 1986, Kenneth Lay was appointed chief executive officer of Houston-based Enron, the result of a merger between two steady but unspectacular pipeline companies, Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth. 
The business was uncomplicated and profitable at the start: It would sell a specific supply of natural gas to a utility or business on a certain day. 
Dissatisfied with remaining an energy small fry in the capital of big oil Texas, Mr. Lay dreamed big. 
The only way his company could grow was to speed along energy deregulation then being contemplated by Washington. Enron quickly got into the lobbying game, pressing the case for less government control of the energy business. 
It and other energy companies got their way in 1992, when the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, headed by Wendy Gramm, the wife of the powerful Texas Senator Phil Gramm, exempted Enron and other power marketers from its oversight. 
She was rewarded with a place on the company's board of directors and Enron got into the complicated business of being an energy broker. 
Instead of simply selling natural gas it was carrying in its own pipelines, it began to use its trading and negotiating skills to sell electricity. 
Quickly, Enron diversified and began trading anything that could be made into a commodity, a head-spinning conglomeration of businesses that included everything from high-speed Internet capacity to interest rates fluctuations to weather changes. 
The company took its cut from both the buyer and the seller, essentially acting as an unregulated commodities exchange. 
Meanwhile, it bought up utilities around the world, such as Britain's Wessex Water, for which it paid US$2.2-billion, a power plant in India and another in Oregon. It also dabbled in unrelated areas, like a plan to build a high-speed broadband telecommunications network and signing a 20-year deal with Blockbuster Video to sell video on demand. 
Wall Street quickly took notice. In 1997, Enron shares were trading for less than $20. In August, 2000, they reached their all-time high of $84. 
Everyone jumped aboard the bandwagon. Financial journalists extolled Enron as the new exemplar, stockholders got rich, as did the company's growing corps of workers, many of whom ploughed their pension savings into Enron shares. 
Politicians also got their cut. Enron became one of the United States' largest political donors, lavishing $1.7-million during the 2000 elections alone (75% of that went to Republicans). 
Enron is the biggest lifetime contributor to George W. Bush, spending almost $600,000 on the U.S. President and former Texas governor. Mr. Lay made it into the inner circles of power -- to the point of being called "Kenny-boy" by the nickname-loving commander-in-chief and becoming the only energy executive allowed to meet Dick Cheney, the U.S. Vice-President, when he was crafting the administration's energy policy last year. 
A big billboard in Enron's gleaming 50-storey headquarters in downtown Houston displayed the ever-climbing share price. 
The company splashed around its money, spending $100-million on the must-have for dot.coms, an eponymous sports stadium. 
When many high-tech companies flamed out, Enron continued to soar -- investors were reassured by the tangible assets like pipelines and power plants backing its earnings rise. 
The only problem was it wasn't making nearly enough money to justify its valuation and was being swamped by debt. 
Seeking to stave off a share price collapse, its executives began creating shell partnerships, many of them named after Star Wars and Jurassic Park characters, to keep the debt off its books. 
One such partnership, Chewco, fronted by chief financial officer Andrew Fastow, took more than $600-million in debt. The privileged secret investors who were allowed to take part in the partnerships were promised any losses would be made up in cash or Enron stock. 
Those kinds of fudges made Enron appear highly profitable. 
Arthur Andersen, the accountants who were supposed to make sure Enron's records followed the law, became increasingly uncomfortable. Last February, the accounting firm even considered dropping Enron as a client. 
But any squeamishness was overcome by the more than $50-million it was making from its accounting and consulting work for the company. 
The departure in August of Jeff Skilling, Enron's president and chief executive officer, for personal reasons signalled that something was very wrong. 
Sherron Watkins, an Enron vice-president, wrote a one-page memo to Mr. Lay that month, warning him the company could "implode in a wave of accounting scandals." 
On Oct. 16, Enron announced a $618-million loss for the third quarter and disclosed a $1.2-billion reduction in shareholders' equity because of the partnerships run by Mr. Fastow. 
The share price began to plunge but Enron prevented its employees from cashing out their shares because of a change in pension system administrators. 
An increasingly desperate Mr. Lay tried calling in his political chits, ringing up Cabinet officials, and even Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve. No one came to his aid, fearing they would be tarred in a money-for-influence scandal. 
On Nov. 8, Enron announced it had overstated its earnings by $586-million over the last five years and had $3-billion in obligations to various partnerships. 
The news made rival Dynergy drop a $23-billion merger offer. Enron declared bankruptcy on Dec. 2. 
As federal authorities began to look into the collapse, Arthur Andersen accountants in Houston began to shred thousands of documents. 
Now Washington's scandal machinery has creaked into action, with 11 congressional committees investigating the collapse, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice. Federal Bureau of Investigation agents are in Houston guarding Enron files and some congressional Democrats are calling for an independent investigator to look into links between the Bush administration and Enron. 
And all that money that Kenny-boy lavished on the White House? His reward was a frosty mention from Mr. Bush calling him "Mr. Lay," then lamenting the $8,000 his mother-in-law lost by holding Enron shares.

Following The Paper Trail In The Enron-Andersen Scandal
By Bryan Lee

01/25/2002
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The following is a chronology of events uncovered by the House Energy and Commerce Committee's investigation of the financial collapse of Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) and the role of its outside auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP.
The paper-trail timeline was revealed in various documents released to the public by the committee in recent weeks: 

Feb. 5, 2001 - Andersen's auditing team meets to discuss whether or not to retain Enron's business due to concerns about the propriety of the off-the-balance-sheet transactions. 
The auditors weigh their concerns about "conflicts of interest" regarding former Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow's involvement in overseeing the partnerships involved in the transactions versus forgoing the more than $100 million in fees Andersen expected to earn from its Enron business in 2001. 
According to an e-mail to David Duncan, Andersen's lead auditor for the Enron account, the "significant discussions" also address concerns about "intelligent gambling" related to Enron's mark-to-market earnings, but the group ultimately concludes the risks of maintaining Enron's business can be managed. 
The account also noted that Andersen had communications with Enron's board about the directors' views of the transactions. The committee is seeking further details about those communications. 

August 2001 - After the surprise announcement that Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling was resigning for personal reasons, Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay receives an anonymous memorandum warning the company could "implode in a wave of accounting scandals" due to increasing scrutiny from investors skeptical about the true reason for Skilling's resignation. 
According to the memo, several Enron officials raised similar concerns directly with Skilling. 
Aug. 20, the author of the memo, Enron Vice President Sherron Watkins, telephones an Andersen auditor and relays her concerns. 
Watkins subsequently meets with Lay to discuss her concerns. At some point Lay directs Enron's law firm, Vinson & Elkins, to investigate the allegations raised by Watkins. In her memo, Watkins specifically advises that a firm other than Vinson & Elkins be used because it provided "true sale opinions" on some of the questionable transactions. 

September 2001 - Andersen "consultation group" formed in response to growing alarm about Enron's plight and the auditing firm's admitted $1 billion accounting error uncovered in August that will require a significant writedown by Enron. 
During these conference calls in September or early October, Duncan, the lead auditor, tells committee investigators that Andersen attorney Nancy Temple asks: "How are you on compliance with the document-retention policy on Enron?" 
Duncan tells the committee staff his response was, "At best, irregular." 

October 2001 - Andersen's concerns mushroom about how Enron will report its third-quarter results, and whether the report will pass muster legally and reflect generally accepted accounting practices. 
Oct. 9, Andersen hires an outside law firm to advise the firm amid its growing concern about the Enron account, indicating Andersen was becoming concerned about its legal liability. 
Oct. 12, Temple sends an e-mail to an Andersen executive, who forwarded it to Duncan, in which the Andersen attorney says: "It might be useful to consider reminding the (Enron) engagement team of our documentation and retention policy. It will be helpful to make sure we have complied with the policy." 
The policy addresses "organization, retention and destruction" of client information. 
Also Oct. 12, Duncan receives a draft press release from Enron in which the company plans to describe its $1 billion charge against income as a nonrecurring item. 
Three days later, Duncan sends a memo to "the files" outlining his Oct. 14 discussion with Enron Chief Accounting Officer Rick Causey. Duncan voiced "strong concerns" that describing the charge as nonrecurring "could be misconstrued or misunderstood by investors." 
Duncan also noted that he informed Causey that Andersen was aware of enforcement actions undertaken by the Securities and Exchange Commission "in cases where they believe such a presentation was materially misleading." 
Oct. 15, Enron issued a press release describing the charge as nonrecurring. 
Oct. 16, Temple sends an e-mail to Duncan advising him to delete her name from the memo about Andersen's concerns about Enron's handling of the third-quarter press release. "Reference to the legal group consultation arguably is a waiver of attorney-client privileged advice and if my name is mentioned it increases the chances that I might be a witness, which I prefer to avoid." 
Around Oct. 19-20, Duncan learns the SEC has launched a formal inquiry of Enron's financial records and reporting. He informs the Andersen consultation group, which includes Temple. Oct. 22, Duncan and the Andersen auditing team meet with Causey, Enron's chief accounting officer, to discuss the SEC probe. 
Oct. 23, Duncan convenes an "urgent meeting" of the Enron auditing team, at which he organizes a concerted effort to destroy a "significant" number of documents of interest to SEC and congressional investigators, Andersen executives testify. 
Oct. 24, Enron fires Fastow, its chief financial officer. 
Oct. 25, Enron issues a notice advising that preservation of documents is required by law, given that the company was being sued by investors. 
The Duncan-led document destruction would continue through the first 10 days of November. 

Nov. 8 - Enron reveals questionable partnership transactions helped it overstate its earnings since 1997 by nearly $600 million. 
Temple, the Andersen attorney, issues a memorandum dated Nov. 10 ordering the preservation of documents related to the Enron account. The memo is sent after Andersen receives a subpoena from the SEC. 
Duncan later tells committee investigators that he complied with Temple's instructions in a Nov. 9 voice mail and stopped document destruction, which Duncan said he had undertaken in compliance with the firm's policy on retention and destruction of documents. 
Enron's stock has been steadily plunging, and enters free fall after Dynegy Inc. (DYN) announces it will abandon a proposed merger-rescue transaction. 

Dec. 2 - Enron files the largest corporate bankruptcy proceeding in U.S. history. Its stock is worth cents a share. A year earlier, the company's stock peaked at nearly $90 a share. 
Later in the month, two congressional committees hold hearings on the Enron debacle. Andersen Chief Executive Joseph Berardino testifies before the House Financial Services Committee that the company made mistakes but acted in good faith. 
Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Fritz Hollings, D-S.C., calls for legislation to bar the use of special-purpose entities, such as the partnership transactions Enron used to take its debt off its books and overstate its earnings. 
The House Energy and Commerce Committee announces it will formally investigate Enron's financial collapse. Documents gathered and interviews conducted provided since then form the basis of this timeline. 

January - After more than a half dozen congressional committees have taken up the Enron matter, Andersen announces its employees destroyed a "significant" amount of paper and electronic records related to the Enron account. 
Jan. 15, the company fires Duncan, who soon after meets with House Energy and Commerce Committee investigators. 
Jan. 22, Enron announces Lay has resigned. The announcement comes after the Justice Department and the FBI begin a probe on reports Enron employees had engaged in document destruction. Lay is scheduled to testify Feb. 4 before two congressional panels, the House Financial Services Committee and the Senate Commerce Committee. 
The House Energy and Commerce committee subpoenas Duncan to testify at a hearing Jan. 23. Duncan invokes his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Andersen officials lay full culpability for the document destruction at Duncan's feet and disavow knowledge of his actions at the time.

-The first hard look by Congress at what's behind the Enron Corp. collapse left lawmakers Thursday certain of only one thing: Thousands of documents were destroyed by the energy company's blue-ribbon accounting firm. 
-A federal judge barred Arthur Andersen LLP from shredding any more documents related to Enron Corp. audits and ruled employees who admitted to destroying documents must give depositions as soon as next month.
-Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., whose Senate Governmental Affairs Committee also began hearings into Enron on Thursday, said the panel would issue subpoenas for Enron and Andersen's documents related to contacts with the White House or federal agencies and departments. 
-Lawmakers in both the House and Senate said they were rethinking the need to consider legislation that would bar accounting firms from having lucrative consulting contracts with companies whose books they also audit. 
-The Enron case already has produced several book deals, with publishers hoping to replicate the success of "Barbarians at the Gate," the best seller about the fall of RJR Nabisco. 
-A Houston Boys and Girls Clubs center that was funded in part by bankrupt Enron Corp. will remain open after a businessman agreed to donate $1 million for its operation.

Turning now to the latest on the Enron collapse, a House panel has launched hearings into document shredding, one of several Enron related probes. 
CAROL COSTELLO, CNN ANCHOR: Turning now to the latest on the Enron collapse, a House panel has launched hearings into document shredding, one of several Enron related probes.
CNN Congressional Correspondent Kate Snow reports initial testimony was marked by dramatic exchanges and silence. 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
KATE SNOW, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): The panel's first witness, the man who seemed likely to have the most information, David Duncan, was Andersen's top partner on the Enron account in Houston. 
REP. JIM GREENWOOD (R), PENNSYLVANIA: Did you give an order to destroy documents in an attempt to subvert governmental investigations into Enron's financial collapse? 
DAVID DUNCAN, FORMER ANDERSEN AUDITOR: On the advice of my counsel, I respectfully decline to answer the question based on the protection afforded me under the Constitution of the United States. 
SNOW: Duncan refused to testify, leaving current Andersen officials to do all the talking. They pinned the blame on Duncan, saying he had called a meeting last October and told others to use the shredder. 
C.E. ANDREWS, ANDERSEN PARTNER: I agree that the action that took place on October 23rd and the subsequent elimination of e-mails and destruction of documents is an action that is totally inappropriate. 
SNOW: Lawmakers wondered about the finger pointing. 
REPRESENTATIVE CLIFF STEARNS (R) FLORIDA: Is Mr. Duncan being made a scapegoat here? 
SNOW: But he wasn't the only one under fire. Attorney Nancy Temple wrote an October 12 e-mail about the company's policy on retaining documents. Duncan has told investigators he was following her advice. Temple was grilled on why she wrote that memo. Did she know Enron was being investigated? Did she know a whistle-blower had raised questions about the company's practices? 
NANCY TEMPLE, ENRON ATTORNEY: To my recollection, I don't... UNIDENTIFIED REPRESENTATIVE: Just yes or no. 
TEMPLE: ... recall seeing a letter from Ms. Watkins. 
UNIDENTIFIED REPRESENTATIVE: Is that a no? So you're saying no, you did not know about Sharon Watkins' letter on October 23rd? You knew nothing about it? Is that your answer, that, no? 
TEMPLE: I was aware that she had made allegations. 
SNOW (on camera): After the hearing, investigators released another memo they said showed Andersen employees were encouraged to work overtime to destroy documents. Committee leaders believe up to 80 Andersen employees got the word to start shredding. 
Kate Snow, CNN, Capitol Hill. 
(END VIDEOTAPE) 
COSTELLO: Did you watch any of the Congressional hearings yesterday afternoon? 
CHAD MYERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I did. 
COSTELLO: It was brutal, wasn't it? 
MYERS: It was. I mean those guys really have their work cut out for them. And I hope someone really comes down and says this is really what happened and -- you can't say you're sorry because, right? But -- and this is why and we really get to the truth. Because those investors and those people that worked there really need to know the truth. 
COSTELLO: Well, with some people not talking or refusing to talk, maybe we'll never get the answers. 
MYERS: I'm afraid not. 
COSTELLO: But at least they're making fools of them in public. 
MYERS: Oh, well... 
COSTELLO: I mean did you hear the questions? They were brutal. 
MYERS: Sir, on the advice of my counsel and by the Constitution of the United States I'm not going to answer that question. 
COSTELLO: Oh, well. 
MYERS: Well, what else are you going to say?

Enron's Australian Unit Faces Being Placed in Liquidation
By Andrew Trounson

Dow Jones Newswires 
MELBOURNE -- Enron Australia, a unit of collapsed U.S. energy trader Enron Corp., should be placed into liquidation, voluntary administrator Sims Lockwood said Friday.
Their recommendation, that will be made at a creditors meeting on Jan. 29, coincides with a dramatic decrease in the estimated value of Enron Australia's electricity trading derivatives book. 
While the value of the book is "fluid," with some counterparties still yet to close out their positions amid a dispute over value, the administrator now forecasts that given the uncertainty the book value will at this stage only be enough to return around 37 cents in the dollar to creditors. 
In Australia, going into administration gives an insolvent or near-insolvent company breathing space to deal with its financial difficulties. The administrator investigates the company's affairs and gives creditors information to decide whether the company should be allowed to keep trading or wind up. 
Previously, the administrator had estimated the book value at 5.38 million million Australian dollars (US$2.8 million), which would have been enough to supply creditors with about 100 cents in the dollar. 
In a statement Friday, Sims Lockwood's Tony Sims said he was "still working toward a dividend approaching 100 cents in the dollar and that this was still achievable if the book was valued on a consistent and commercially reasonable basis by all the counterparties." 
But so far, the administrator has only been able to reach agreement on valuations with 12 of Enron Australia's 37 counterparties. 
Mr. Sims said that "the administrators would recommend that the company be placed in liquidation at the meeting of creditors on 29 January." 
At least three of Enron's largest debtors haven't closed out their transactions. 
"Legal advice suggests that in the event of liquidation, the liquidator may upon application to the court, force the counterparties to close out," Enron Australia said in the same statement. 
"The administrators will issue legal proceedings if necessary to ensure that a consistent and rigid framework applies to achieve a consistent and equitable outcome for both counterparties and Enron Australia stakeholders," Enron Australia said. 
Enron Australia appointed administrators after its U.S. parent filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection

Enron case already leads to several book deals

01/25/2002

Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

NEW YORK (AP) - The Enron case already has produced several book deals, with publishers hoping to replicate the success of "Barbarians at the Gate," the best seller about the fall of RJR Nabisco. 
Doubleday's Currency imprint has agreed on a six-figure deal with Houston-based journalist Mimi Swartz to write about it. The book, tentatively titled "Power Failure," is scheduled for the fall.
"We hope this will resonate with people who liked `Barbarians at the Gate,"' Doubleday spokesman David Drake said Thursday. 
He promised "a lively narrative" about the Houston-based energy corporation that collapsed amid allegations of shady accounting and executive greed. The energy giant filed for bankruptcy protection last month, becoming the biggest corporate failure in U.S. history. 
One book Doubleday is unlikely to promote is "Creative Destruction," a 2001 publication that praises Enron and others for "overcoming cultural 'lock-in"' by, among other things, "abandoning outdated, ingrown structures and rules and adopting new decision-making processes." 
Meanwhile, a Texas-based journalist who has written about the energy industry, Robert Bryce, is working on "Pipe Dreams," to be published by PublicAffairs in the fall. 
Bryce's editor, Lisa Kaufman, said the deal was worth as much "as we have paid for any book" and also cited "Barbarians at the Gate" as a model. 
"We all want to come out with `Barbarians at the Gate,"' she said with a laugh. 
A third book, "Power Shock," is scheduled for a fall release by John Wiley & Sons. On its Internet site, Wiley also is pitching "The Financial Numbers Game," a new advice book the publisher says will help readers "avoid an Enron scenario."

Charities planning to carry on without the benefit of Enron's philanthropic giving
By KRISTEN HAYS
Associated Press Writer

HOUSTON (AP) - The United Way of the Texas Gulf Coast expected a $6 million donation from Enron Corp. by March, but the group isn't counting on it now. 
As Enron grapples with bankruptcy and a sweeping reorganization, museums, arts organizations and charities like the United Way are making plans that no longer hinge on donations from the former energy giant.
The company regularly shared its wealth when it held the No. 7 spot on the Fortune 500 list and reported billions of dollars in annual revenue. But now Enron has laid off thousands of employees and seen the value of its stock virtually disappear, throwing future giving in doubt. 
"It's not been given at this point," said United Way spokesman Mario Gomez said of the $6 million. Last year, Enron gave $5.5 million to the group, which won't be able to assess the effect of losing this year's contribution until its current campaign to raise $78 million is over. 
Enron typically gave about 1 percent of its pretax earnings to various causes under the leadership of Kenneth Lay, who resigned Wednesday as chairman and chief executive. He will remain on Enron's board, and the company is searching for a new leader. 
Lay also gives privately through the Linda and Ken Lay Foundation. Internal Revenue Service records show the foundation took in $14 million in 2000 and donated $2.5 million to charities, museums and other organizations in Texas and across the country. 
Lay's company had an average philanthropic record for a corporation, said Tom Billitteri, an editor at the Chronicle of Philanthropy. 
In 2000, the most recent year for which figures are available, Enron came in 62nd out of 96 corporations across the country who responded to a Chronicle survey of charitable giving. 
That year, Pfizer Inc. topped the list, having given $340 million in cash and assets. Merck & Co. was second with $249 million, and Microsoft Corp. was third with $231 million. 
Enron donated $10.8 million that year. 
"There was nothing extraordinary about their philanthropic giving," Billitteri said. "It was decent, but not unusual." 
Enron hasn't formally suspended writing checks to charities, but the bankruptcy hinders its ability to give, company spokesman Mark Palmer said. 
"The creditors' committee does have to work with us to make sure everything we do is preserving the value of the estate, and that there's an equitable way to reorganize the company so we can pay back our creditors," Palmer said. 
The Houston Ballet became one of those creditors when a $15,000 check from Enron bounced two days before the Dec. 2 bankruptcy filing in New York. 
"It happened so quickly there was not anything to do at that point," said C.C. Conner, managing director of the ballet. 
She said Enron adds as much as $50,000 each year to the ballet's $12.5 million budget. Contributions are crucial, she said, because ticket sales don't cover the costs of putting on ballet performances. Ballet officials plan to seek other sources of funding. 
Still, Conner didn't think that the loss of Enron contributions amounted to a crisis. 
"If we had dozens of Enrons, we would have a real problem," she said. "But one is not enough to cause a drastic problem." 
Other beneficiaries are also adjusting to the loss of a major local source of philanthropy. The M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, one of the world's top cancer hospitals, no longer expects a donation of about $600,000 once promised by Enron. And the 6-year-old Holocaust Museum Houston, which depends on Enron for up to 10 percent of its annual budget, is planning to find that $235,000 elsewhere. 
M.D. Anderson named a cancer screening clinic after Enron when the company gave $1.5 million in a capital campaign. The hospital's current president, Dr. John Mendelsohn, and a former president, Dr. Charles LeMaistre, are members of Enron's 14-member board of directors. 
For other organizations, the expected loss of Enron donations has nearly been disastrous. 
The company pledged $2.4 million over the next decade for the Enron Boys & Girls Club, which opened Nov. 1 as the company entered its downward spiral. When Enron filed for bankruptcy, the club was left penniless and nearly had to shut down. 
On Thursday, club officials announced that the crisis had been averted. A Houston businessman had come to the rescue, offering to donate $1 million.

Friday Forum This week's topic: The Enron debacle How could it have happened? What should be done? What lessons should be learned? What you're saying READER'S SOUND OFF Take stock of Enron's fall
SMOKE AND MIRRORS

Enron became a smoke-and-mirror operation run by stogie-smoking, high-stakes gamblers. The name of the game was greed and they used the savings of trusting people, employees and investors, to stake their play. Many employees and investors lost a lot when Enron crumbled, and they deserve some remedy for their losses. But they should have seen, even through the fog of investors' greed, that things were amiss. 
Take, for example, the businesses and families across the country who were gouged last winter under the guise of a shortage of natural gas. Many paid monthly gas bills that equaled their mortgage payments, and Enron earned huge profits on the backs of those who used gas to keep from freezing. Did any Enron employee or investor question that corporate gain?
Shame on all of us that we have come to embrace greed as a way of life and believe that greed results in honest gain. Last summer, as Enron executives began cashing in their chips, it seemed they knew that they probably couldn't sustain similar profits through another winter and that a wave of gamblers' debt was coming due. At the same time, they were staring at the specter of a proposed merger with Dynegy and the reality that required financial disclosure would reveal Enron's hidden debt and misstated profit. 
Shame on a government that would allow an Enron to operate in a vacuum on its own terms and without regulation. The saddest and most shameful result of this fiasco is the damage done to our country, which represents itself as God-honoring. It probably wouldn't take too much more of this kind of corporate misbehavior to bring our capitalistic system down. That, in itself, is the best reason for the exercise of swift and sound judgment on the people who squandered our trust.

Everyone has an angle on the Enron debacle. But I haven't heard anyone point out the real scare on this topic yet: In short, nobody knew! I don't care if you read every business journal and article covering Enron and the industry during the past five years. Nobody knew the real story. 
And what should terrify the average American investor is if the seventh-largest corporation in the country can hide such a morass, what about the companies you are invested in?
Do you know who handles their accounting practices? Do you know how they structure their debt? How many offshore (potentially debt- hiding) accounts are represented by the companies in your 401(k) or standard-stock portfolio?

A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- If you needed any further proof that investors no longer trust Enron Corp. (ENE), here's another piece of evidence - one that goes to the heart of the recent plunge in the company's stock.
Enron doesn't simply trade for less than its book value; it fell below that milestone weeks ago. No, now it trades for less than ONE-THIRD of its book value. 
That's a rare level for a company of Enron's size and prominence. And it may mean, among other things, that investors have decided that they simply can't place any further faith in the veracity of Enron's earnings and balance-sheet figures, much-revised as they've been - something that has unnerving implications for any attempt to value the company fairly. 
First, let's be clear about what this means. Enron stock is currently about $4 a share; the company's reported book value is about $12.90 a share. In other words, Enron stock sells for less than one-third of what shareholders would get if the company were to liquidate - were to turn all its assets into cash, pay off all its liabilities on its balance sheet and give what's left over to shareholders. 
This is an uncommonly dismal level for any company, even a troubled one. For comparison's sake, Dynegy Inc. (DYN), which has agreed to buy Enron, trades at about three times book value, as does El Paso Corp. (EPG), a competitor of both companies. In fact, Enron has the second-lowest price-to-book ratio of any company in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index - only Conseco Inc. (CNC), another troubled company, is lower, by an eyelash. 
Part of the problem is undoubtedly the continuing fear among investors that Dynegy's agreement to buy Enron will fall apart, and the belief that Enron will have to file for bankruptcy if it does, in which case Enron shareholders would be hard-pressed to realize any value. The Dynegy deal now amounts to about $10.60 per Enron share, itself well under Enron's book value; the huge premium that level offers over Enron's current stock price is an indication of the big risk investors see that the deal won't be consummated in its current form. 
But given Enron's current woes, it's certainly also possible that Enron is trading at such a big discount to book value because investors don't feel they can trust the earnings and balance-sheet numbers coming out of Enron. Those numbers, after all, are the raw material that form the basis for valuing Enron, or any other company, by computing figures like price-to-book and price-to-earnings ratios. 
And the Enron debacle has been all about the quality of those numbers, with Enron shifting assets off its balance sheet to outside limited partnerships from which some of its executives benefitted. In terms of those numbers, the ground has shifted underneath investors three separate times now - when the company slashed its reported shareholder equity by $1.2 billion to unwind its transactions with one of those partnerships, when it restated nearly five years' worth of earnings downward by a total of $586 million, and when it revealed that it could take further charges and was facing an imminent deadline to post collateral on a $690 million note. (That deadline has now been extended until Dec. 14.) 
When you've gotten punched in the face three times, it's not unreasonable to fear there'll be a fourth blow, no matter how much the puncher assures you there won't be. Given Enron's insanely complicated structure, and the way bad financial news has dribbled out of the company over the past several weeks, who can guarantee there aren't more such shocks yet to come? 
That's what investors appear to be fearing, and that may be part of the reason Enron stock has fallen so precipitously. Thanks to Enron's repeated demonstrations that its numbers can't be relied on, investors no longer have a firm, trustworthy basis on which to value the stock. And so, not surprisingly, the value is getting ratcheted down to the most conservative, bare-minimum level. 
An Enron spokesman couldn't be reached for comment. 
It's ironic, in a way. For a long time, it was hard to properly value Enron because its structure and finances were so complex and hard to decipher. Now it's hard to properly value Enron because the company's attempts to clarify its finances have made it clear that it's hard to expect investors to trust in their accuracy.

Dynegy Board Silent On Status Of Enron Takeover >ENE DYN
By Christina Cheddar
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- As the market continues to speculate about the status of Dynegy Inc.'s (DYN) takeover of Enron Corp. (ENE), Dynegy's board isn't offering its opinion. 
"Any comments coming out of Dynegy are coming from the company's executives," said Jerry Johnson, a Dynegy board member who also is an executive vice president at Safeguard Scientifics Inc. (SFE).
Johnson declined to comment on any matters related the pending acquisition of its larger rival, and wouldn't say whether the board has been meeting to discuss the transaction. 
Three other board members, through their representatives, declined to comment as well. Other non-executive directors on the 14-member board either weren't immediately available to comment or couldn't be reached. 
As for Dynegy's management, spokesman John Sousa said the company's opinion on the deal remains the same since its last comments on Wednesday. 
At that time, Dynegy Chairman and Chief Executive Chuck Watson said Dynegy was continuing its due diligence and was looking to accelerate regulatory approval of the deal. 
According to Sousa, Dynegy worked through the holiday weekend gathering information as part of its due diligence efforts. 
Meanwhile, Enron continued its discussions to raise between $500 million to $1 billion of additional financing, said Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne. The company also is working to restructure its debt by mid-December, she said. 
But investors appear to be voting with their feet. Enron shares were recently down 18.3%, or 86 cents, to $3.85, while Dynegy shares slipped 2.7%, or $1.06, to $39.34. As a result, the already huge discount to the deal's offer price has grown even bigger as the market continues to signal the deal won't get completed on its original terms. 
Under the terms of the transaction, Enron shareholders are to receive 0.2685 of a Dynegy share for each share outstanding, or about $8.98 billion, based on Dynegy's recent stock price. 
At Enron's recent level, the stock is trading at a 64% discount to the Dynegy offer. 
Neither Sousa or Denne would comment on the stock movement. 
Dynegy has already provided Enron with a $1.5 billion cash infusion that is secured by Enron's pipeline assets. While that investment has helped Enron's near-term liquidity position, it remains unclear how long the company can remain solvent without any added investments.

Enron, Banks Formalize $690M Debt Extension To Dec. 14
By Carol S. Remond and Christina Cheddar

Of Dow Jones Newswires 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) and a group of banks last week formalized an agreement to extend the due date on a $690 million syndicated loan by three weeks to Dec. 14.
The loan relates to one of Enron's consolidated limited partnerships that owns minority interests in power and energy projects around the world. Enron said last week that Standard & Poor's downgrade of its credit rating to "BBB-" had triggered an obligation to repay the loan by Nov. 27. 
People familiar with the matter said last week that lead banks J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. and Enron will use the extension to negotiate a further postponement of the debt to the middle of 2002 when other Enron bank loans come due. About $1.75 billion of Enron's $3.5 billion in syndicated bank loans come due in May 2002 and will likely need to be restructured. 
About $250 million of the assets securing the $690 million loan are in the process of being sold and will be used to pay down the loan, reducing the outstanding portion of the loan that will need to be restructured, those people familiar with the matter said. 
Enron's shares and bonds continue to suffer from mounting uncertainties about the company's finances and whether those could force one-time rival Dynegy Inc. (DYN) to reconsider its offer to buy Enron, an offer that many see as Enron's only chance to avoid bankruptcy. Enron stock was recently down 18% to $3.84. Meanwhile, Enron bonds are also lower, with the 6.4% bonds due 2004 recently trading at a distressed level of 48 cents on the dollar.

Citigroup Has $2.38B Less To Lose On Enron Due To Swaps
By Christine Richard
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/26/2001
Dow Jones Capital Markets Report
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Citigroup Inc. (C) is expected to extend a hand to Enron Corp. (ENE) by renegotiating a $690 million payment due Nov. 27. 
But investors shouldn't be concerned that the financial services giant is too exposed to the embattled energy trading company. Citigroup already may have laid off the loan and other exposure via a series of credit default swap transactions. That means more institutional investors left holding the bag if Enron isn't ultimately rescued from financial collapse by a takeover proposed by Dynegy Inc. (DYN).
Over the last few years, Citigroup has entered into at least six transactions that effectively would allow the bank to lay off the equivalent of $2.384 billion in Enron exposure. 
Citigroup was instrumental in setting up Enron Credit Linked Notes Trust, Enron Credit Linked Notes Trust II and Yosemite Securities Trust I, which together raised $1.750 billion; Enron Sterling Credit Linked Notes Trust and Yosemite Securities Co., which raised a combined GBP325 million; and Enron Euro Credit Linked Notes Trust, which issued EUR200 million. 
Citigroup, which acts as the default swap counterparty to the trusts, receives the return on the portfolio of single-A-plus-or-better-rated securities, purchased with the proceeds of the offerings, in exchange for providing the payout on the Enron exposure, according to Mary Ryan, director of synthetic securities ratings at Standard & Poor's. 
As long as Enron remains out of bankruptcy, Citigroup continues to make payments on the notes, Ryan said. 
If Enron defaults, Citigroup would cease making payments to the trust. The single-A-plus-or-higher-rated securities in the trusts would go to Citigroup in exchange for the same nominal amount of now in-default Enron debt obligations. And with speculation mounting that Dynegy will reduce, or maybe even scrap, its offer to buy Enron, the chances of a such a default-driven transfer would appear to be rising. 
These notes essentially are synthetic Enron debts, meaning they act like Enron bonds in many respects, but lack key components that make holders true creditors of Enron. 
For instance, the holders of these notes, because they don't possess actual Enron obligations - and won't unless the company defaults - are not involved in negotiations to restructure or rollover debt. It has been reported that Enron is engaged in active negotiations over the terms of its debts with creditors. 
The synthetic notes all carry a rating equivalent to Enron's rating of triple-B-minus from Standard & Poor's and Baa3 from Moody's Investors Service. 
The rating on the securities has been downgraded in recent weeks to reflect the downgrades in Enron's ratings. 
Citigroup officials did not respond to requests for further details on the transactions. -By Christine Richard, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2189;

Enron Is Sued Over 401(k) Plan; Plaintiffs Seek $850M

11/26/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) was sued Monday in the latest of at least three purported employee class action suits the company faces over lost 401(k) retirement savings due to the recent collapse of the price of Enron stock. 
In a press release Monday, Eli Gottesdiener, a Washington, D.C. attorney who filed the latest suit on behalf of employees, said it seeks $850 million in plan losses, in part because the company sold Enron stock to its employees knowing the price was artificially inflated.
An Enron spokeswoman declined to comment. 
Unlike two similar, recently filed suits against Enron, the latest also contends that Enron offered the stock without the required prospectus. 
If proven, the sale without a prospectus "give workers the automatic right to rescind their purchases and receive their money back with interest," Gottesdiener said in a statement. 
Enron "locked down" the retirement plan from Oct. 17 to Nov. 19, to make administrative changes, which prevented employees from selling Enron shares as the share price collapsed amid growing disclosures of financial problems. 
Earlier this month, Houston-based Dynegy Inc. (DYN) offered to buy its far larger competitor in an all-stock deal that values Enron shares at $10.85 a piece, or about $9.2 billion. 
Enron later disclosed that its future earnings would be substantially less than expected and shares fell sharply. 
Enron currently trades at $4.05 a share, down from their 52-week high of $84.88 a share in December 2000. 
The first suit was filed Nov. 13 on behalf of plaintiffs by Campbell Harrison & Wright LLP in Houston. A second was filed last week by Seattle-based Hagens Berman LLP.

STOCKWATCH Enron falls 14 pct on mounting concerns over Dynegy deal

11/26/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd
NEW YORK (AFX) - Shares of Enron Corp were down 14 pct in midsession trading as concerns continued to mount over the energy giant's acquisition by Dynegy Inc, with investors focusing more and more on the deal's breaking clause, dealers said. 
At 12.45 pm, Enron shares were trading down 65 cents at 4.06 usd, a decline of 14.0 pct. Dynegy was down 1.60 usd at 38.80, amid broad declines in energy shares as crude prices sank.
The DJIA was up 57.70 points at 9,892.86. The S&P 500 was up 6.24 points at 1,143.27. The Nasdaq composite was up 11.94 points at 1,886.99. 
Dealers said that with Enron shares having slid well below the Dynegy offer price of 9.85 usd a share, the ChevronTexaco affiliate may well reconsider its offer, or walk away from the deal all together. 
"People are making the bet that perhaps Dynegy may cancel the deal, and that's there a lot more risk in playing the arbitrage," said Jefferies & Co market strategist Art Hogan. 
The deal with Dynegy contains a "material adverse change" clause, which could be invoked to call the deal off, he said. 
As part of its due diligence, Dynegy is examining details of Enron's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week, which reportedly contained information it had not received previously. 
Enron shares have plunged further since the filing, in which Enron revealed a number of new financial problems including a possible obligation to repay a 690 mln usd note due Nov 27. 
Enron subsequently received an extension on the repayment until mid-December. 
Since the beginning of the year, Enron shares have lost over 90 pct of their value after it was revealed that the company would post hefty third-quarter charges linked to risky investments by the firm's former chief financial officer. 
"At this point, with so much smoke around the fire, I think the shares are rightly valued," said Jefferies' Hogan.

USA: UPDATE 1-Enron shares slide lower as merger doubts intensify.
By Janet McGurty

11/26/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
NEW YORK, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Shares of troubled energy giant Enron Corp. continued to lose ground on Monday amid fears that the proposed acquisition of the company by smaller rival Dynegy Inc. will fall through. 
Enron stock was down 61 cents, or 12.9 percent, at $4.13 in active midmorning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Dynegy has agreed to pay $10.55 per share for Enron.
"The market is acting like the deal is not going through or not going through at the original terms," said Michael Heim, an industry analyst at A.G. Edwards & Sons. 
Heim said that among three possible scenarios - the deal goes through as planned, it is canceled, or it is restructured - the first is the least likely. 
"Escape clauses" built into the Dynegy-Enron deal give the buyer the option to back out if there is serious deterioration in Enron's business or assets. 
"Dynegy has a good claim that the 'material adverse condition' clause has already been triggered, either by the $690 million loan being accelerated, earnings (being) down or the ongoing trading business weakness," he said. 
Last week Enron said it could be forced to pay a $690 million debt this week because of a credit downgrade, but the payment deadline has been delayed until mid-December. 
Enron's recent admission that lower volumes at its trading business - the crown jewel that Dynegy most covets - could cause low fourth-quarter earnings raises the possibility that the trading business is losing its profitability. Continued lower volumes there would remove a key attraction for Dynegy. 
"Every day that goes by where Enron trading volumes become less, it decreases the value of the assets Dynegy was trying to buy in the first place," Heim said. "Besides trading and marketing, what value does Enron have?" 
The majority of Enron's physical assets are spoken for, with partnerships and creditors getting first dibs and Dynegy getting the first right to exercise its option to acquire Enron's Northern Natural Gas pipeline. 
Dynegy, which is 26.5 percent-owned by energy giant ChevronTexaco , is to swap 0.2685 share of its own stock for each share of Enron. Shares of Dynegy were down $1.27, or 3.1 percent, at $39.13 in midmorning NYSE trade. 
Enron agreed to a Dynegy buyout after it was overwhelmed by a series of problems, including a U.S. regulatory probe of off-balance-sheet dealings by its officers, a $1.2 billion cut in shareholder equity, and cuts in its credit ratings. 
Enron subsequently restated its earnings, but investor unease snowballed and its share began tumbling. The shares were above $90 in August 2000. 
Heim said he was not sure that EnronOnline, Enron's online trading platform, is the premier property it once was. 
"Two years ago it had some value, but now others have been able to duplicate it. It's not the computer systems - it's the traders and network that Enron had. If those go away, the value lessens.

USA: Enron lawsuit seen as wake-up call for pensions.

11/26/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
HOUSTON, Nov 26 (Reuters) - A Washington, D.C., lawyer said Monday he hopes heavy losses suffered by Enron Corp. employees will spur Congress to limit employee investments in their employers' stock through 401 (k) retirement plans. 
"How many workers have to lose both their jobs and their retirement savings before Congress steps in and puts a stop to this by placing a cap on the amount of company stock that can be in a 401 (k) plan?" lawyer Eli Gottesdiener asked.
Gottesdiener released a statement Monday saying he had filed a lawsuit on behalf of employees of the beleaguered energy giant who have lost an estimated $850 million on Enron stock held in their 401 (k) retirement accounts. 
The suit is the third one filed against Enron that alleges the company breached its fiduciary duty to employees by encouraging them to invest in its stock at artificially inflated prices. All three suits seek class-action status. 
Enron's shares have fallen from a high of $90 in August 2000 to less than $5 today, their decline accelerating since Oct 16 amid a series of disclosures about its deteriorating finances. 
Like many other companies, Enron makes matching contributions to its employees' 401 (k) retirement accounts in its own stock. It also requires them to hold the stock they receive in matching contributions until they turn 50. 
Enron employees were also prevented from selling Enron stock held in retirement accounts for several weeks from mid-October due to a change in the retirement plan's administrator. 
Gottesdiener said investment advisors recommend investing no more than 15 percent of a portfolio in a single stock, but that participants in 401 (k) plans offering employer stock as a choice typically hold 33 percent of their portfolio in that stock. 
"Congress sensibly placed a 10 percent limit on company stock in traditional defined benefit plans back in 1974, but at the behest of the corporate lobby, it placed no such cap on defined contribution plans," he said. 
The absence of such a cap in defined-contribution 401 (k) plans was "completely indefensible," he said. 
Gottesdiener's suit alleges that Enron violated federal securities law by offering and selling Enron stock to employees without issuing a prospectus. If proven, this would give workers the right to reverse their purchases, he said. 
Gottesdiener is also involved in class action pensions litigation against New York Life Insurance Co. and SBC Communications Inc..

USA: US Corp Bonds-Bonds tighten, analysts fret on Enron.

By Jonathan Stempel 
NEW YORK, Nov 26 (Reuters) - U.S. corporate bonds outperformed
Treasuries on Monday as traders edged back to their desks 
following the Thanksgiving Day weekend, in the midst of a broad 
revival for corporate bonds of all stripes. 
In secondary trading, spreads, the yield difference between 
the bonds and comparable maturity U.S. Treasuries, tightened about 
0.01 percentage point. 
"I would expect a continuation of the tightening, especially 
with Treasury interest rates going up," said one trader. "Absolute 
corporate yields are starting to look pretty attractive." 
Corporate bonds, especially junk bonds, have outperformed 
Treasuries this month as investors developed a new tolerance for 
risk. Though absolute returns for investment-grade corporate bonds 
are negative, they are even worse in the Treasury market, where 
investors appear more convinced that the current U.S. economic 
downturn won't be deep or long. 
"The successes in Afghanistan and some milder-than-anticipated 
economic data have combined to increase investor appetite for 
risk," wrote fixed-income research service CreditSights Inc. in a 
report dated Monday. "While the severity and swiftness of the bond 
market's correction was a surprise, it hasn't changed our basic 
view of U.S. corporate bonds and we continue to recommend 
overweight positions." 
This week's forward calendar remains quiet. 
In early trading, 10-year Treasuries rose 10/32, as their 
yields fell to 4.971 percent. 
ENRON 
Market participants are closely watching Houston-based Enron 
Corp. as the largest U.S. energy trader tries to merge 
with smaller cross-town rival Dynegy Inc. , keep its 
investment-grade credit ratings, and manage a load of $9.15 
billion of debt and other obligations, much of which is unsecured 
and coming due within 13 months. 
Of this debt amount, $690 million could come due by 
mid-December, and $3.9 billion immediately if Enron falls to junk 
status. The key to resolution of this matter, some observers 
believe, is Enron's banks. 
"The goal of the banks now is to re-cut their exposure to gain 
as much structural seniority or asset liens as possible, take out 
fees, raise rates, take down total exposure, and generally improve 
their risk-profile under multiple scenarios," said CreditSights. 
"The very bankers who are supplying liquidity through new 
secured bank lines and who are rumored to be considering equity 
investments are the ones on the hook (and unsecured) for $3 
billion in bank loans," wrote Carol Levenson, an analyst for 
GimmeCredit, another fixed-income research service. "If Dynegy 
backs out (in the interest of self-preservation), these vital bank 
renegotiations might save Enron but leave unsecured bondholders as 
the patsies." 
Enron's existing 6.4 percent notes maturing in 2006 and 6.75 
percent notes maturing in 2009 were bid on Friday at 57 cents on 
the dollar, down from around par on October 12, before Enron first 
reported third quarter results, which it later revised downward. 
Enron shares have fallen 94 percent this year to their lowest 
level since early 1989. 
DATA 
Investment-grade and junk bond spreads narrowed 0.1 and 0.27 
percentage point last week, respectively, to 1.68 and 7.84 
percentage points, according to Merrill Lynch & Co. Junk bond 
spreads have narrowed 1.45 percentage points this month. 
For the month, junk bonds have returned 2.996 percent, while 
investment-grade corporate bonds have lost 2.355 percent and 
Treasuries 3.488 percent, Merrill Lynch said. For the year, the 
respective bonds are up 4.777, 9.634 and 6.565 percent.

TALES OF THE TAPE: Energy Traders' Perfect Storm Stalls
By Christina Cheddar

11/26/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES (This story was published originally Friday) 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Here's one 2001 outlook that couldn't have been more wrong.
Around this time last year, pundits and fund managers were touting "the perfect storm" of market forces that were coming together to make the energy trading business one to watch in 2001. 
Then came the California power crisis, and allegations of price-gouging and fears of credit defaults began to cloud the outlook for the group. That was followed by renewed volatility in power prices, and this time the prices were headed down, not up. 
And then came a crushing blow against trading firms - the unraveling of the industry's largest player, Enron Corp. (ENE). 
Simply put, the perfect storm stalled, and a business once buoyed by high gas prices, strong demand and tight supply now lies in tatters. 
The stocks of companies whom some say should be valued more like growth stocks than utilities are instead mired at around nine-times earnings - about where traditional utilities trade. 
And the chance for recovery in 2002? 
Basu Mullick, portfolio manager of the Neuberger Berman Partners fund, is willing to bet there is. He thinks energy traders deserve at least the same price-to-earnings multiple as the broader market's median, which is currently between 16- to 17-times future earnings, he said. It's just a matter of time before the stocks get there. 
"They were just recovering from Gray Davis," Mullick said, referring to the governor of California, who had accused "out-of-state" energy traders of artificially inflating the price of power in the state, and triggering the state's energy crisis. "Now, they are recovering from Enron." 
The fund manager also blames lower commodity prices, warm weather and poor demand for the recent weak performance in the group. 
"Energy convergence companies are putting up terrific growth rates," he said. "I don't think they should get the same valuation as a garden-variety utility." 
Still, others think the stock market is continuing to make distinctions between the energy traders by taking a harder look at the companies' strategies and financial disclosures. 
Enron's precarious financial situation underscores the importance of accounting issues. Although many of Enron's financial problems aren't solely the fault of mark-to-market accounting issues, there has been growing attention paid to this form of financial reporting because of the earnings volatility it can create. 
Answers Elude Investors 

Investors are asking hard questions, and not always getting the answers they want. 
Using mark-to-market methods, a company calculates the fair market value of a commodity position - whether it's a contract, an option, a swap, etc. - at the time, even if the value of the position is realized over a longer period. The problem with this method is the actual cash a company realizes from the position might not be the same value the company calculated in its original assessment. Also, sometimes it isn't easy to calculate the fair value of the commodity position. This is particularly true in instances where the market for the commodity isn't liquid. 
Over time, companies with the highest level of disclosure regarding their mark-to-market gains will most likely trade at higher multiples to counterparts that provide little or no disclosure, said ABN AMRO Inc. analyst Paul Patterson. 
Encouragingly, it appears companies may already be responding to the call for added disclosure. According to a survey Patterson conducted, more companies with energy trading units were willing to disclose the details of their mark-to-market accounting practices during third-quarter conference calls compared with those in the second quarter. 
Patterson said he prefers earnings that are cash-based. 
"All things being equal, we believe reported earnings that more closely reflect the timely realization of cash have a higher quality associated with them than earnings that do not," he said. 
He expects investors to become smarter and learn to distinguish between earnings growth through accrual accounting and growth fueled by mark-to-market accounting. 
At the end of the day, it is not a matter of simply producing profits, but being able to say where those earnings came from, said one investor, who manages a pension fund. 
Some investors also may be placing a greater emphasis on the cash flow the energy merchants produce. 
Tim O'Brien, portfolio manager of the Gabelli Utilities Fund, said energy merchants that own the physical power assets to back up their trading positions should trade at a premium to an independent power producers and traditional utility companies. Still, the stocks should be valued at less than the growth rate of the company because of their heavy exposures to commodity prices. 
Energy merchants include companies such as Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) and Dominion Resources Inc. (D). 
According to O'Brien, the group never deserved to have the price-to-earnings multiples above 20- to 30-times earnings, which were once paid for the stocks. 
"We all got sucked up by the up-leg of the cycle and forgot just how cyclical these companies are," O'Brien said, adding that the average multiple should be in the high single-digits to the high-teens. 
As for independent power producers - which are companies without regulated operations that own power plants to generate electricity to sell and trade in the wholesale market - the group may wind up being valued on the basis of the replacement costs of the assets in their portfolio, according to O'Brien. 
"One analogy is that they are basically like commercial real-estate plays," O'Brien said. 
That could mean stocks such as Calpine Corp. (CPN), which is already in the lower-half of its trading range, may have further to fall.

INDIA: UPDATE 1-India's AV Birla group denies bid for Enron unit.

11/26/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
(Recasts with denial, comments from financial institution in paragraphs 5-6) 
BOMBAY, Nov 26 (Reuters) - The Aditya Vikram Birla Group, a leading Indian conglomerate, on Monday denied newspaper reports it was looking to buy U.S. energy giant Enron Corp's 65-percent stake in the beleaguered Dabhol Power Company.
"There has been no expression of interest in Dabhol. We are not interested," a top AV Birla group official told Reuters. 
Two leading Indian business dailies earlier said the group, whose interests range from textiles to cement and carbon black, is eyeing Dabhol to expand its interests in the domestic power sector. 
The Economic Times and the Financial Express said the group was exploring the possibility of submitting an expression of interest to Indian financial institutions to buy Enron's stake in the company. 
An official of state-run Industrial Development Bank of India, the leading financier of the $2.9 billion project in the western state of Maharashtra, said he has not heard from the Birla group. 
"We have not received any official communication from them," the official, who did not wish to be identified, told Reuters. 
The spokesman for Dabhol was not available for comment. 
FIGHTING FOR SURVIVAL 
Enron Corp, which is fighting for survival in the United States amidst investor doubts over its corporate governance practices, owns 65 percent of Dabhol. General Electric Co and Bechtel own 10 percent each, while the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) owns 15 percent. 
Dabhol and MSEB have been fighting over payment defaults and high tariffs for over a year. The dispute has affected India's efforts to attract foreign investment in the power sector and caused Enron and its U.S. partners to announce plans to exit the project. 
Tata Power Company Ltd, India's largest private sector utility firm, and BSES Ltd, another utility company and a member of India's largest conglomerate, the Reliance Group, are already in talks to buy Enron's stake. 
The AV Birla Group has adopted the route of mergers and acquisitions in recent years to consolidate its position in key industries. 
Last week, one of its group companies, Grasim Industries Ltd, bought a 10-percent stake in India's largest cement maker, Larsen & Toubro Ltd 
Earlier this year, Indian Rayon & Industries Ltd, another group company, entered the information technology sector by buying out France's Groupe Bull SA's 50.35 percent stake in PSI Data Systems 
But the group's track record in the power sector has been less than impressive. 
Two joint ventures with Britain's Powergen Plc to produce over 1,000 megawatts of electricity in two Indian states have not made much headway since they were announced in the mid-1990s.

Enron's Stock, Bonds Drop on Concern for Dynegy Bid (Update8)
2001-11-26 16:45 (New York)

Enron's Stock, Bonds Drop on Concern for Dynegy Bid (Update8)

     (Adds analyst comment in 4th paragraph.)

     New York, Nov. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s stock price
declined to a 14-year low and its bonds plunged 10 points on
concern the company won't secure $1 billion in fresh capital,
threatening its plan to be acquired by Dynegy Inc.

     ``The clock is definitely ticking,'' said Jon Kyle
Cartwright, a debt analyst at Raymond James and Associates. ``The
question is the survivability of Enron.''

     J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. executives met
today to line up investors for as much as $2 billion of bonds
convertible into stock. The company needs the money to operate
until Dynegy completes its $23 billion purchase. Dynegy unveiled
its plan to make the acquisition on Nov. 9.

     Enron shares and bonds, which opened lower, tumbled after 1
p.m. when no announcement for fresh financing was made. Enron's
6.4 percent notes that mature in 2006 plunged to 48 cents on the
dollar, down from 55 cents on Friday. The bonds now yield 26
percent. Enron shares declined 15 percent, or 70 cents, to $4.01.

     Concern that rival Dynegy may change or cancel its bid for
Enron has pushed Enron's stock down 55 percent in the past week.
Enron's shares had plummeted 86 percent since mid-October after
the company reported a $618 million third-quarter loss and said
expansion into water, telecommunications and retail-energy sales
cost it $1.01 billion.

     ``You haven't heard anything from Dynegy today, and that is a
bit scary,'' said Andy Palmer, who doesn't hold Enron bonds in the
$2 billion he helps manage at ASB Capital Management Inc. in
Washington.

     Part of the third-quarter charge was connected with limited
partnerships run by the chief financial officer. He was ousted,
and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission started an
investigation into Enron's accounting. The company earlier this
month restated its earnings for the past four years.

                        Talks on $1 Billion

     Under the buyout, Enron investors would receive 0.2685 Dynegy
share for each share held. That valued Enron at $10.41 a share, 21
percent more than Enron's share price that day.

     On Friday, the buyout valued Enron at $10.85 a share, more
than double Enron's closing price of $4.71. The widening of the
difference between the value of the offer and Enron's stock price
indicates investors doubt the buyout will go through.

     Shares of Enron traded as low as $3.76 today, rebounding to
close at $4.01. The stock was the most active in U.S. trading
Wednesday and Friday. Dynegy dropped $1.15, or 2.85 percent, to
$39.25. The stock has fallen 30 percent this year. Both companies
are based in Houston.

     Egan-Jones Ratings Co. lowered its rating on Enron's credit
today to ``BB-'' from ``BB.'' ``Dynegy needs to show its support,
or Enron will slide,'' the firm said in a report.

     Moody's Investors Service hasn't issued a report on Enron
since the company filed its 10-Q quarterly report with the SEC a
week ago. The ratings agency's analysts haven't returned calls for
comment.

     Moody's cut Enron's long-term credit rating on Nov. 9, though
it maintained an investment grade.

                          `More Problems'

     ``Time is not Enron's friend,'' said Stewart Morel, co-head
of investment grade debt research at UBS Warburg LLC. ``There is
increased concern in the market that there may be more problems
that are yet to be disclosed.''

     On Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve from lenders on
a $690 million note due this week, giving the company more time to
restructure its finances. Dynegy Chief Executive Officer Chuck
Watson said he was ``encouraged'' by the commitment to extend the
note payment, as well as the closing of a $450 million credit
facility, and that Dynegy remained committed to the merger.

     Terms of the $690 million note were outlined for the first
time in the Enron filing a week ago. Enron also said that it has
less than $2 billion in cash and credit lines left. If the
company's cash reserves run too low, Enron's credit rating may be
cut below investment grade. That would trigger $3.9 billion in
debt repayments for two affiliated partnerships.

     Enron said in the filing that fourth-quarter profit might be
hurt by a drop in its trading business. Companies such as Aquila
Inc. and Mirant Corp. have reduced their activity with Enron
because of credit concerns.

     ``Should the Dynegy deal fall through, we don't view it
likely that Enron would be able to remain as a stand-alone
company,'' Youngberg of Edward Jones said. ``Without Dynegy, the
credit rating will fall, causing their trading business to dry up
further.''

     Enron, the biggest energy trader, once handled about a
quarter of U.S. gas and power transactions.

     Enron's bankers met with leveraged buyout firms and two
industrial companies to seek an investment, the New York Times
reported last week. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc.
agreed to terms that give each of them a $250 million equity stake
as part of a transaction to be completed today.



Dynegy Bonds Slip as Enron Purchase May Harm Credit Rating
2001-11-26 15:16 (New York)

Dynegy Bonds Slip as Enron Purchase May Harm Credit Rating

     New York, Nov. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Dynegy Inc. bonds have
fallen as much as 9 percent this month on investor concern the
energy trader's proposed $23 billion purchase of rival Enron Corp.
will erode its credit rating.

     Dynegy's 6.88 percent coupon notes due in 2011 are trading at
$932 per $1,000 face value, down from $1,024 last month, according
to Merrill Lynch & Co. data. Yield on the debt has risen to 7.9
percent from 6.5 percent as investors demand more return to
compensate for the increased risks of the securities.

     Dynegy's credit is rated ``Baa3'' at Moody's Investors
Service, the lowest rung of investment grade, and ``BBB+'' at
Standard & Poor's, two levels higher. Each ratings company said it
may cut Dynegy's credit rating if it buys Enron, which comes with
about $15 billion in debt and a regulatory inquiry into financial
partnerships set up to keep debt off its books.

     ``If you put Dynegy and Enron together it will have a
detrimental effect on Dynegy's credit rating,'' said Tim Nelson,
senior credit analyst at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray Cos. in
Minneapolis, which holds Dynegy bonds.

     Dynegy's 7.45 percent coupon notes due in 2006 are trading at
$1,019 per $1,000 face value, down from $1,085 last month,
according to Merrill. The notes yield almost 7 percent, up from
5.4 percent.

     Enron's credit is rated ``Baa3'' at Moody's and ``BBB-'' at
S&P, the lowest level of investment grade. Both ratings companies
are reviewing the credit for a possible downgrade and say Dynegy's
buyout plan is what's keeping the grades above junk.

     ``I don't think right now anybody knows exactly what Enron
is,'' said Mark Simenstad, who holds Dynegy bonds in the $5
billion he helps manage at Lutheran Brotherhood.

     ``Dynegy has proven to be pretty well-managed over the years
so you have to give them the benefit of the doubt here,''
Simenstad said. ``The hope is that if there's something they don't
understand they'll walk away.''

     Dynegy has $3.9 billion of bonds outstanding, most of which
come due between 2002 and 2011, according to Bloomberg data.

     Shares of Houston-based Dynegy, which topped $47 two weeks
ago after Chief Executive Chuck Watson said the Enron purchase
would boost earnings by at least 35 percent next year, fell $1.30
to $39.10 in mid-afternoon trading today. Enron's shares, down 92
percent this year, fell as much as 80 cents, or 17 percent, to
$3.91, a the lowest since 1987.



ENRON SHARES SLIDES TO ALL-TIME LOW

By CBS.MarketWatch.com

4:53 PM ET Nov 26, 2001

HOUSTON (CBS.MW) -- Enron shares fell as much as 20 percent Monday,
crashing through the $4 level for part to set an all-time low and cast
additional doubt on the energy merchant's plan to be acquired by rival
Dynegy.

Enron (ENE) set a new all-time low of $3.76 Monday afternoon before
closing at $4.01, off 70 cents. More than 60 million shares changed
hands, making it the most active issue on the New York Stock Exchange.

The stock has lost about half its value since Dynegy announced an
agreement to buy Enron on Nov. 9 and more than 85 percent of its value
in the past month.

Meanwhile, shares of Dynegy (DYN) lost $1.15, or 2.8 percent, to stand
at $39.25.

The collapse in Enron's share price has made it more likely that Dynegy
and Enron will have to renegotiate the terms of their original deal, in
which 0.2685 of a Dynegy share would be exchanged for each outstanding
Enron share.

However, the Financial Times reported that Dynegy remains confident of
its ability to complete a deal for Enron, which has been seeking $500
million in private equity capital to shore up its finances.

"We continue to hear reports the Enron's energy marketing and trading
business, once the crown jewel of the company, has eroded badly with
counterparties only willing to do shorter-term deals," A.G. Edwards
&amp; Sons analysts Charles Fishman and Douglas Fischer wrote in a
research note Friday.

Enron investors do not believe that the merger is likely to occur under
the current terms, the analysts said.



Chance of Dynegy backing out

_______________________________________________________________________

On Monday, Michael Heim, also of A.G. Edwards, attributed Enron's
latest stock drop to "growing belief that the likelihood of the (merger)
deal is not so likely."

He pointed out that the outlook for Enron is "not very favorable" but
in the meantime, it's doing everything it can to stay "afloat" while
working on closing the deal.


Last week, Enron said it got a bank extension on a $690 million note to
mid-December. The note was originally set to come due in 2003, but was
bumped up to Nov. 26 due to a rating downgrade at Standard &amp; Poor's.
<http://cbs.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B81418CA4%2D11A5%2D4C7C%2DA602%2DCF3DA4BCAA7B%7D>

The payment by itself is manageable because Enron has about $2 billion
in cash on its hands, Heim said, but "the event moves Enron's merger one
step closer to the point in which Dynegy is able to exercise the
merger's material adverse condition clauses and back out of, or
restructure, the merger deal."

Heim has a "sell" rating on the stock.

How do you know when a woman is about to say something smart? 
When she starts her sentence with "A man once told me..." 
---------------------------------------- 
How do you fix a woman's watch? 
You don't.  There is a clock on the oven. 
---------------------------------------- 
Why do men break wind more than women? 
Because women can't shut up long enough to build up the required pressure.

All-
Mom and Dad have fired Joycelyn.  I don't need to go into the details, her
personality is unbearable!  I have asked Homeinstead to provide another
caregiver from the hours of 2-6pm, M, W, F.  With Cena providing
transportation for all doctor appointments and Mom's standing hair
appointments on Fridays.  I have stressed to Homeinstead that they need to
take the time to find the right person for Mom and Dad because the hours
could expand if they would find the right person.
Love, Margaret

Subject:	**IMPORTANT** Stack Manager Users
Importance:	High


We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your "native" desktop.

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding "1" or a "2" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

Thank you,

Dan Diamond

Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Ken Lay

Cover Story: THE ENRON SCANDAL
CAN YOU TRUST ANYBODY ANYMORE? The scope of the Enron debacle undermines th=

There are business scandals that are so vast and so penetrating that they p=
rofoundly shock our most deeply held beliefs about the honesty and integrit=
y of our corporate culture. Enron Corp. is one of them. This financial disa=
ster goes far beyond the failure of one big company. This is corruption on =
a massive scale. Tremendous harm has befallen innocent employees who have s=
een their retirement savings disappear as a few at the top cashed out. Terr=
ible things have happened to the way business is conducted under the cloak =
of deregulation. Serious damage has been done to ethical codes of conduct h=
eld by once-trusted business professionals.=20
It is difficult not to contrast the professionalism of modestly paid firefi=
ghters and police doing their duty on September 11 with the secretive and s=
quirrely behavior of six- and seven-figure accountants, lawyers, CEOs, bank=
ers, and financial analysts who failed at their duty with Enron. The remark=
able letter by Enron whistle-blower Sherron Watkins to Chairman Kenneth L. =
Lay in August that presciently warns of accounting scandals reads like a ro=
ad map of corporate corruption, subterfuge, and manipulation. She worries a=
bout the world perceiving Enron's ``past successes as nothing more than an =
elaborate accounting hoax'' (page 34).
The Enron debacle calls into question a host of other aggressive accounting=
 techniques used across a wide spectrum of Corporate America--most of them =
quite legal. And that's precisely the point. It's getting harder and harder=
 to know what a company actually earns and what its stock is actually worth=
. An astonishing 723 companies have been forced to restate and lower their =
earnings since 1997. With enormous pressures to produce earnings growth, au=
ditors are being turned into enablers. They forsake their traditional role =
of outside skeptic for that of inside business partner and they reject thei=
r age-old function of discloser of information for that of master magician =
who hides the financial rabbit (page 44).=20
Investor confidence is crucial to the success of our economic system. This =
confidence is threatened by not only the Enron scandal but by the dramatic =
decline in accounting standards. People increasingly feel the game is rigge=
d. Unless Washington and business professionals seize the moment to clean u=
p the mess in the market economy, they risk a major populist backlash.=20
In the end, Enron was able to enlist precisely those referees who, in the p=
ast, would oversee and check its behavior--accountants, lawyers, bankers, l=
egislators, even regulators--in the pursuit of higher earnings. Many were t=
empted by a piece of the equity action and compromised their integrity. Enr=
on paid big fees to many of these professionals to help manufacture its ear=
nings, and together they created the mechanisms for evading the financial t=
ruth.=20
Watkins says as much. She talks of partnership deals that temporarily infla=
te the stock price, allowing execs to cash out options: ``It's a bit like r=
obbing the bank in one year and trying to pay it back two years later.'' Sh=
e adds, ``nice try but investors were hurt'' when they bought stock that la=
ter fell. In a free-market economy, companies are supposed to fail because =
of the business cycle or bad business decisions. Failure from loose and sle=
azy practices, if not outright fraud, is another matter.=20
We now know that something went seriously wrong in the march to deregulatio=
n. There is no question that deregulated markets are generating lower costs=
, higher growth, and lower unemployment for the U.S. economy. But dereg ide=
ologues, such as Enron's President Jeffrey K. Skilling and the company's po=
litical allies in Washington, convinced the nation deregulation meant no re=
gulation. A big mistake. Enron and other companies used the transition to d=
eregulation to gain access to Congress and regulators and write their own r=
ules. They persuaded the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to let Enron =
and a few other companies run largely unregulated energy-derivatives tradin=
g businesses. Wendy Gramm, who at the time was head of the CFTC, later join=
ed Enron's board of directors--on the audit committee.=20
Financial complexity made it easy to mask the truth and play financial game=
s. The financialization and securitization of the real economy into mathema=
tical bits and bytes allowed Enron and others to massage earnings results i=
n infinite ways. Off-balance-sheeting financial engineering became the requ=
isite way to boost earnings and stock prices. Hundreds of companies have do=
ne it (page 36). Common standards were replaced by idiosyncratic measures. =
Slowly but surely, the financial truth disappeared. No one, not the account=
ants or lawyers or bankers or Wall Street analysts, protested as the bottom=
 line became a fiction. On the road to deregulation, basic building blocks =
of capitalism--clarity, transparency, fairness, openness--were sacrificed. =
Everything the public needs to evaluate risk, value stocks, and participate=
 in an equity culture was undermined. Americans embraced the equity economy=
 in the '90s because they believed they could participate in it fairly. The=
y didn't expect to see their 401(k)s go up in smoke.=20
Who can come to the rescue? The reputations of many of the professionals wh=
o were counted on to safeguard the economic system lie in tatters. Corrupte=
d by the chase for an ever-greater piece of the action, accountants, lawyer=
s, analysts, and managers have shirked their duty on a scale not seen since=
 the 1920s. Conflicts of interest abound as accounting firms sell services =
to the companies they audit and accountants jump to the corporations whose =
books they examine. The accounting profession has successfully fought all a=
ttempts at reform, rebuffing efforts to end conflicts of interest, impose s=
tricter oversight, or increase liability for their actions. In short, most =
certified public accountants feel little duty to the public at large.=20
Nor do lawyers see themselves as officers of the court, which they are. Vin=
son & Elkins LLP was asked by Enron Chairman Lay to check out whether Watki=
ns' seven-page warning of financial deceit warranted action. It came back w=
ith a ``No.'' Wall Street analysts stopped being honest when their compensa=
tion became contingent on their firms getting investment-banking business f=
rom the companies they covered. And bankers are too busy selling fee-based =
services to carry out due diligence on loans and debt. They have enormous c=
onflicts of interest. The Glass-Steagall Act was passed in 1933 to stop tho=
se conflicts. Its repeal in 1999 has ushered in their return.=20
What's to be done? Restoring investor confidence in the system of equity ca=
pitalism is crucial to the economy's health. The continued deregulation of =
the economy and the privatization of services depends on the integrity of t=
he financial reporting system. If the investing public is going to particip=
ate, it must see a fair and transparent system.=20
The pendulum is swinging toward reform. The accounting changes required are=
 all too obvious. But change must go beyond the scope of the financial impl=
osion. The buying and selling of political access is not in the best intere=
sts of the country. It is unseemly to have the head of the Justice Dept., a=
s well as the entire Houston branch, recuse themselves because of conflicts=
 on the Enron case. A sense of outrage is growing. The lesson from the Enro=
n debacle should be to restore basic integrity to the bottom line, ethics t=
o business professionals, and clout to overseers that even a deregulated ec=
onomy need.

ight thing. Thanks to whistle-blower Sherron S. Watkins, a no-nonsense Enro=
n vice-president, the scope and audacity of the accounting mess is becoming=
 all too clear. Her blunt Aug. 15 letter to Enron CEO Kenneth L. Lay warns =
that the company might ``implode in a wave of accounting scandals.'' And no=
w that her worst fears have been realized, it is also clear that Watkins' l=
etter went far beyond highlighting a few accounting problems in a handful o=
f off-balance-sheet partnerships. Watkins' letter lays bare for all to see =
the underbelly of Enron's get-rich-quick culture.=20
Watkins, 42, a former Arthur Andersen accountant who remains Enron's vice-p=
resident for corporate development, put her finger on the rot: top execs wh=
o, at best, appeared to close their eyes to questionable accounting maneuve=
rs; a leadership that had lost sight of ordinary investors and the basic pr=
inciples of accounting; and watchdogs--the outside auditors and lawyers who=
se own involvement may have left them too conflicted to query the nature of=
 the deals. Perhaps the question shouldn't be how Enron collapsed so quickl=
y--but why it didn't implode sooner.
Lay's response to Watkins' complaints is nearly as damning as her letter it=
self. Yes, he talked to her for an hour. And, yes, he ordered an outside in=
vestigation. But contrary to Watkins' advice, he appointed the company's lo=
ngtime Houston law firm, Vinson & Elkins, despite the obvious conflict: V&E=
 had worked on some of the partnerships. And Enron and V&E agreed there wou=
ld be no ``second-guessing'' of Andersen's accounting and no ``detailed ana=
lysis'' of each and every transaction, according to V&E's Oct. 15 report. T=
he inquiry was to consider only if there was new factual information that w=
arranted a broader investigation. V&E declined comment.=20
Surprise: V&E concluded that a widespread investigation wasn't warranted. I=
t simply warned that there was a ``serious risk of adverse publicity and li=
tigation.'' And Watkins' letter reveals the inadequacy of Lay's response in=
 the months following CEO Jeffrey K. Skilling's sudden Aug. 14 resignation =
for ``personal reasons.'' His departure triggered the letter. Lay never ful=
ly disclosed the partnerships or explained their impact to investors, even =
as he vowed there were no accounting issues and ``no other shoe to fall.'' =
Even after Enron revealed on Oct. 16 a $1.2 billion hit to shareholder equi=
ty related to the partnerships, Lay continued to express ignorance about de=
tails of these deals and support for Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fast=
ow, who managed and had stakes in certain partnerships. But on Oct. 24, Fas=
tow was removed from his job and promptly left the company.=20
Watkins, an eight-year Enron veteran, is not some disgruntled naysayer who =
is easy to dismiss. Her lawyer, Philip H. Hilder, says she became familiar =
with some of the partnership dealings when she worked in June and July in F=
astow's finance group. Her position allowed her to review the valuation of =
certain assets being sold into the partnerships, and that's when she saw ``=
computations that just didn't jibe,'' says Hilder.=20
Former executives say the Tomball (Tex.) native was tenacious and competent=
. ``She wasn't really an alarmist,'' says one former Enron employee. Her mo=
ther, Shirley Klein Harrington, a former high school accounting teacher, ca=
lls her daughter ``a very independent, outspoken, good Christian girl, who'=
s going to stand up for principle whenever she can.'' Watkins had previousl=
y worked at Andersen in Houston and New York and then for Germany's Metallg=
esellschaft AG.=20
At those companies, she befriended Jeffrey McMahon, whom she helped recruit=
. Now the CFO at Enron, McMahon ``complained mightily'' about the Fastow pa=
rtnerships to Skilling, Watkins told Lay in the letter. ``Employees questio=
n our accounting propriety consistently and constantly,'' she claimed. McMa=
hon didn't return calls. Skilling has denied getting any warnings about acc=
ounting.=20
Watkins didn't stop there. Five days after she wrote to Lay, Watkins took h=
er concerns directly to an Andersen audit partner, according to congression=
al investigators. He in turn relayed her questions to senior Andersen manag=
ement on the Enron account. It's not known what, if any, action they took.=
=20
Of course, Skilling and Andersen execs shouldn't have needed a letter and a=
 phone call from Watkins to figure out something was seriously amiss. Red f=
lags abounded. And Watkins, for one, had no trouble putting her finger on q=
uestionable accounting practices. She wondered if Enron was hiding losses i=
n off-balance-sheet entities while booking large profits from the deals. At=
 the same time, the outside partnerships were backed with Enron stock--a ta=
ctic sure to backfire when it was falling--and no outsiders seemed to have =
any capital at risk. Was Enron creating income essentially by doing deals w=
ith itself? ``It sure looks to the layman on the street that we are hiding =
losses in a related company and will compensate that company with Enron sto=
ck in the future,'' she wrote.=20
In the end, Watkins grasped one thing that Enron's too-clever-by-half dealm=
akers didn't: Enron's maneuvering didn't pass the smell test. Even if Enron=
 and its high-priced auditors and lawyers can ultimately show that they fol=
lowed the letter of the law, it matters little. As Watkins herself wrote, i=
f Enron collapses, ``the business world will consider the past successes as=
 nothing but an elaborate accounting hoax.'' And that seems destined to bec=
ome Enron's epitaph.

Cover Story: THE ENRON SCANDAL
THE PERFECT SALES PITCH: NO DEBT, NO WORRIES

At Enron Corp., debt avoidance wasn't merely a strategy for managing its ow=
n balance sheet. It was a way of life that pervaded the company's dealmakin=
g culture. Consider Enron Energy Services, which managed energy needs and e=
quipment for big corporate customers. The company held regular seminars to =
teach EES employees how to use complex financial vehicles to woo customers,=
 manage earnings, and, naturally, keep debt off balance sheets at Enron and=
 its clients. Former Enron executive Michael R. Boutcher recalls a class on=
 structured finance that described the financings as ``accounting nirvana''=
--able to not only get debt off the books but even out of accounting footno=
tes.=20
No one is claiming that these structures were akin to the off-balance-sheet=
 partnerships at the heart of Enron's accounting scandal. These deals gave =
tax and other benefits to customers who outsourced their energy management =
to Enron. But they certainly highlight Enron's aggressive philosophy of lev=
eraging its financial acumen. Boutcher, manager of business development at =
EES until Enron's December collapse, says that creating complex financings =
with clients was standard practice. And, he says, Enron used them far more =
aggressively than its rivals. ``We could always sweeten the pot, and the ob=
jective was to beat out anybody that was competing against us,'' says Boutc=
her. An Enron spokeswoman says such equipment financing was common in the i=
ndustry. But several rivals disagree.
In a presentation on Nov. 9, 2000, to some 60 employees in Houston, Boutche=
r says, a company lawyer explained how structured-finance deals could manag=
e and accelerate earnings for Enron and take debt ``off credit'' for custom=
ers, so that it wouldn't be reflected in credit ratings. The objective laid=
 out in one page of the presentation couldn't have been clearer: ``Off cred=
it: Difficult to achieve. ...Must make it look like the company has no fina=
ncial obligation at all under any circumstances, including default by them.=
''=20
EES says it never actually did one of the ``off-credit'' deals. There were =
some things even Enron couldn't peddle.

WHO ELSE IS HIDING DEBT Moving financial obligations into off-book vehicles=
 is now a common ploy

When energy trader Enron Corp. admitted to hiding billions of dollars of li=
abilities in mysterious off-book entities, it trotted out the lame excuse o=
f scoundrels: Everyone does it. And this time, it was the gospel truth.=20
Hundreds of respected U.S. companies are ferreting away trillions of dollar=
s in debt in off-balance-sheet subsidiaries, partnerships, and assorted obl=
igations, including leases, pension plans, and take-or-pay contracts with s=
uppliers. Potentially bankrupting contracts are mentioned vaguely in footno=
tes to company accounts, at best. The goal is to skirt the rules of consoli=
dation, the bedrock of the American financial reporting system and the sour=
ce of much its credibility. These rules, set clear in 1959, aim to make pub=
lic companies give a full and fair picture of their business--including all=
 the assets and liabilities of any subsidiaries. But accountants, lawyers, =
and bankers have learned to drive a coach and horses through them.
Because of a gaping loophole in accounting practice, companies create arcan=
e legal structures, often called special-purpose entities (SPEs). Then, the=
 parent can bankroll up to 97% of the initial investment in an SPE without =
having to consolidate it into its own accounts. Normally, once a company ow=
ns 50% or more of another, it must consolidate it under the 1959 rules. The=
 controversial exception that outsiders need invest only 3% of an SPE's cap=
ital for it to be independent and off the balance sheet came about through =
fumbles by the Securities & Exchange Commission and the Financial Accountin=
g Standards Board. In 1990, accounting firms asked the SEC to endorse the 3=
% rule that had become a common, though unofficial, practice in the '80s. T=
he SEC didn't like the idea, but it didn't stomp on it, either. It asked th=
e FASB to set tighter rules to force consolidation of entities that were ef=
fectively controlled by companies. FASB drafted two overhauls of the rules =
but never finished the job, and the SEC is still waiting.=20
It's not just the energy industry that exploits the loophole and stashes ma=
jor liabilities in the never-never land of SPEs. Increasingly, companies of=
 all stripes routinely use them to offload potential balance-sheet bombshel=
ls such as loan guarantees or the financing of sales of their own products.=
 For example, the accounts of data processor Electronic Data Systems Corp. =
don't show $500 million--half of last year's earnings--that it would owe if=
 its customers were to cancel their contracts and leave it holding the bag =
for loans on their computer equipment. The arrangement is acknowledged only=
 in a footnote. An EDS spokesman says the tactic is common in the industry =
and does not put the company at undue risk.=20
Airlines keep appearances aloft by shunting billions worth of airplane fina=
ncing into off-balance-sheet vehicles, says credit analyst Philip Baggaley =
of Standard & Poor's Corp. United Airlines Inc. parent UAL Corp.'s publishe=
d balance sheet for 2000 shows $5 billion of long-term debt. But only a foo=
tnote describes the bulk of its lease payments, which Baggaley estimates ha=
ve a present value of $12.7 billion, due over 26 years on 233 airplanes. AM=
R Corp., parent of American Airlines Inc., is on the hook for $7.9 billion =
in lease payments not on its balance sheet. ``Everyone who's involved in th=
e industry knows that the true leverage is higher'' than what's shown on th=
e balance sheet, says Baggaley. UAL and AMR declined to comment.=20
Banks arrange many of the devices and are big users themselves. J.P. Morgan=
 Chase & Co., for example, has revealed in the Enron bankruptcy that it has=
 nearly $1 billion in potential liabilities stemming from a single 49%-owne=
d Channel Islands entity called Mahonia that traded with Enron. The liabili=
ties bring the bank's total Enron exposure to $2.6 billion. And J.P. Morgan=
 is not alone. A suit filed earlier this month shows that many U.S. finance=
 companies are among 52 partners in LJM2, an Enron off-balance-sheet entity=
 with over $300 million in assets. The partners, including Citigroup, Wacho=
via, and American International Group, may all have to takes losses on it.=
=20
The banks' participation in SPEs is attracting scrutiny of federal regulato=
rs. A Federal Reserve spokesman said it is ``concerned about'' off-balance-=
sheet exposures and hopes new accounting rules will be put in place. How ma=
ny more Mahonia or LJM2-like entities are there? The Channel Islands tax ha=
ven boasts more than 350 SPEs and similar entities, though it is impossible=
 to know how many should really be consolidated on balance sheets of U.S. c=
ompanies. Assets in the entities total more than $635 billion, according to=
 Fitzrovia International PLC, a London-based research firm. The Cayman Isla=
nds, which has been competing for the business since the 1980s, claims anot=
her 600 trusts and banks, most of which have SPE expertise.=20
With some of the vehicles, it is impossible for investors to know from fina=
ncial reports who could be responsible for what. For example, Dell Computer=
 Corp. has a joint venture with Tyco International Ltd. called Dell Financi=
al Services that last year originated $2.5 billion in customer financing, a=
ccording to a footnote to Dell's accounts. According to the note, Dell owns=
 70% of DFS, but does not control it and therefore keeps DFS debts off its =
own balance sheet. What if DFS has trouble from customers not paying? Dell =
spokesman T.R. Reid says any obligations of DFS are Tyco's responsibility a=
nd Tyco agrees. Jeffrey D. Simon, president of the global vendor financing =
business at Tyco Capital, says Tyco would look to Dell's customers to pay a=
nd not to Dell. Tyco's balance sheet reflects borrowing to finance Dell's c=
ustomers.=20
Companies argue that off-balance-sheet vehicles benefit investors because t=
hey enable management to tap extra sources of financing and hedge trading r=
isks that could roil earnings. Maybe so, but they sure make the companies, =
and their executives, look good: Return on capital looks better than it is =
because balance sheets understate the amount employed. And investors and re=
gulators don't freak out as corporate debt balloons. But critics charge tha=
t the widespread use of off-balance-sheet schemes encourages contempt for a=
ccounting rules in the executive suite and spreads confusion among investor=
s. ``The nonprofessional has no idea of the extent of the real liabilities,=
'' says J. Edward Ketz, accounting professor at Pennsylvania State Universi=
ty. ``Professionals can be easily fooled, too.''=20
Worse yet, many SPEs have provisions that can throw their users into a full=
-blown financial crisis. To get assets off its books, a company typically s=
ells them to an SPE, funding the purchase by borrowing cash from institutio=
nal investors. As a sweetener to protect investors, many SPEs incorporate t=
riggers that require the parent to repay loans or give them new securities =
if its stock falls below a certain price or credit-rating agencies downgrad=
e its debt. It was just such triggers in its notorious off-balance-sheet pa=
rtnerships that sent Enron into a death spiral. And triggers fueled the cri=
ses last year at Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison, and Xe=
rox, according to Moody's Investors Service. ``All of this hidden debt and =
these triggers could make the next economic downturn a lot worse than it wo=
uld otherwise be,'' says Lynn Turner, who was chief accountant at the Secur=
ities & Exchange Commission until July.=20
Despite the risks, SPEs remain very appealing to companies. And any attempt=
 to curb them or abolish the 3% rule will run into furious opposition. Sinc=
e the early '90s, an army of accountants, lawyers, and bankers built a huge=
 industry to concoct ever more creative ways to evade consolidated reportin=
g. So reform won't come easily. ``It will be a phenomenal fight,'' says Tur=
ner.=20
Maybe so, but Enron's demise shows how quickly a tiny loophole can tear the=
 country's economic fabric. And there may never be a better time to close i=
t.

Out of Sight
Many companies keep debts and other obligations out of investors' view in
partnerships and other entities. Often, financial liabilities are secured
by physical assets such as planes or computers. A sample:

Special-purpose vehicles used to control market, credit rating=20
By DAN FELDSTEIN=20
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle=20
Jan. 28, 2002, 6:31AM
As accountants, stockbrokers and others study Enron's collapse, they focus =
on the company's now-infamous "special-purpose vehicles" -- independent com=
panies that propped up Enron's income and hid its debt.=20
They want to know whether the vehicles' goosing of Enron's financial statem=
ents was a side effect or their sole purpose.=20
One good clue is the list.=20
In the last year at Enron Global Finance group, managers were sometimes han=
ded a list of Enron assets and instructed to go out and sell some to the ve=
hicles, said an employee with direct knowledge of the procedure.=20
"Knowing what I do now, I know that was used directly to manipulate the (st=
ock) market," the employee said.=20
A manager would pick something, from a plant to stock to a piece of a start=
-up company. Then he would walk the deal through a team of internal lawyers=
 and auditors.=20
The bigger the "sale," the bigger his bonus.=20
What actually happened was that a bank or other investor lent money to the =
newly created company to finance the purchase. The new company, in turn, pa=
id the money to Enron.=20
Why didn't Enron just get a loan itself without going through a middleman? =
Because the loan now belonged to the new company, not Enron, and thus didn'=
t count as a debt on Enron's financial statement.=20
Instead, it counted as income to Enron when the new company passed on the p=
roceeds.=20
Less debt and more income do wonders for a quarterly report. The procedure =
assured Enron would keep its high credit rating, saving big bucks, and woul=
d keep the stock price up.=20
After a while, the employee said, employees joked that there would be no as=
sets left to deal.=20
"Every associate on up knew. We used to joke about, `I want this thing to s=
tand up until I get my money and go,' " he said.=20
Two former Enron employees who worked on the special-purpose vehicles spoke=
 at length to the Chronicle about what they did for a living. One met with =
a reporter in the offices of a Rice University accounting professor.=20
The employees, graduates of top schools, spoke on the condition that they n=
ot be identified.=20
Both said there were many uses for the vehicles that they considered legiti=
mate, such as bringing in outside partners to share the risks of a particul=
ar venture. But there was little question, especially toward the end in the=
 finance group, that many had no real "business purpose" other than improvi=
ng financial appearances.=20
"They are created merely to make the income statement look better. An avera=
ge person would say there's something wrong," said Michael Granof, a Univer=
sity of Texas accounting professor.=20
The employee with direct knowledge of the process didn't disagree. It's jus=
t sort of what they did, he said, and he never realized the extent of the c=
ompany's debt.=20
The anatomy of the deal was simple, he said.=20
Say the asset was 100 shares of IBM stock. Enron would divide each share in=
to two parts, one called a "control interest" and one called an "economic i=
nterest." Then it would sell the economic interest to a newly created speci=
al-purpose vehicle.=20
The asset was rarely as simple as 100 shares of another company's stock. So=
 Enron had to put a value on it. Because there wasn't really an outside buy=
er, it decided the price itself and had that number blessed by its auditor,=
 Arthur Andersen.=20
The deal was placed with a bank, insurance company or other major lender, w=
hich put up 97 percent of the money. Sometimes the promise of Enron stock w=
ould be put up to guarantee the loan, as a sort of collateral, although Enr=
on stockholders were never told of the risk that their shares could be dilu=
ted if such new shares had to be issued, the employee said.=20
To qualify as "independent" from Enron for accounting purposes, an SPV had =
to be owned by someone else. So an outside entity would be brought in to ma=
ke the required investment, which was just 3 percent of the SPV's total sta=
rt-up cash.=20
In some cases, Enron is alleged to have lent that money to the outside equi=
ty partners, though the employee said he had no direct knowledge of that.=
=20
Enron no longer owned the economic interest in the asset, but it did own co=
ntrol over it. In the sales contract with the vehicle, Enron promised alway=
s to act in the interest of the SPV. Lawyers and auditors said all this was=
 OK.=20
As the asset made money for the SPV -- if it did, and many didn't -- it mad=
e principal and interest payments to the lender and issued dividends to the=
 outside equity partners, just like in a normal company.=20
So what was left for Enron? Unlike a normal company, the yield to the equit=
y partners was capped. If the partner's yield cap was 15 percent and the as=
set made 20 percent, Enron got 5 percent.=20
Most important, Enron got to report the proceeds of the sale of the asset a=
s earnings. It had to repay the loan, of course, but the debt didn't show u=
p on Enron's financial statements.=20
A basic question is why Enron didn't just sell the assets normally to raise=
 money. The answer is control, the employee said. If the asset were a plant=
, perhaps Enron would give itself the operating and maintenance contract. I=
f it were private shares of another company, maybe Enron was technically fo=
rbidden to sell, or it could make another deal later.=20
By keeping its visible debt low, Enron retained a higher credit rating and =
thus paid a lower interest rate on money it borrowed and money borrowed by =
the SPVs, the employee said.=20
When Enron was forced to restate its earnings last year to include some of =
that debt, and as debt from other sources also surfaced, Moody's Investor S=
ervices downgraded Enron's bond rating. With a trading company such as Enro=
n, where the ability to borrow vast sums at favorable interest rates is key=
, that was fatal. Bankruptcy quickly followed.=20
Such accounting practices were a factor in the company's fall, but the real=
 problem was that many of Enron's recent major investments -- broadband and=
 water divisions, New Power and an Indian power plant -- did not work out, =
said the employee and Rice University accounting professor Bala Dharan, who=
 also questioned the employee.=20
"Investors don't like to hear you say, `Oh, I was wrong.' So you start havi=
ng a yard sale to boost CFO (cash flow from operations) and net income," th=
e employee said.=20
The second employee said many SPVs were easier to justify. Sometimes they w=
ere created to bring two other parties together, with Enron merely providin=
g the expertise. Both said investors were happy to get involved in the deal=
s.=20
But in recent years, the first employee said, their use became more questio=
nable.=20
"Is any of that illegal? No, but it's shady. The investor couldn't truly kn=
ow what Enron owned or what Enron owed. People don't pay attention to the f=
ootnotes," he said.=20
And the footnotes in Enron's required financial statements also weren't muc=
h help. Granof, an author of accounting textbooks with an MBA and doctorate=
, said he found them "unintelligible."=20
"That was conscious. No two ways about it," the employee responded.=20
Granof said he still couldn't quite understand why SPVs are considered legi=
timate. While expressing disappointment with Andersen for "deceiving" inves=
tors while meeting the letter of the law, he said, "there but for the grace=
 of God go four other major accounting firms" of the Big Five that could ha=
ve been similarly ensnared in the Enron fiasco.=20
"Something is wrong with the rules," he said.=20

Financial Post: World
Enron's hazy legal landscape: Were strong laws violated by bad people, or d=
id weak laws render such violation unnecessary?
Diane Henriques with Kurt Eichenwald
The New York Times

It was called "rotten, horrible, indefensible" and "shocking." With those w=
ords, securities law experts around the country condemned the way Enron had=
 structured and sold a partnership called LJM2, which offered investors a c=
hance to profit from confidential information about Enron's investment plan=
s -- and gave the partnership investors more information about the company'=
s finances than Enron's shareholders received. "This is potentially the mos=
t serious revelation about Enron to date," said Joel Seligman, a securities=
 law historian and dean of the Washington University Law School. "You can't=
 overstate how shocking it is."=20
But did the arrangement, however unfair it seems to stockholders, actually =
violate the nation's securities laws and regulations?
That is far more difficult to answer, legal scholars say -- and far more im=
portant. For them, the fundamental question about the sprawling Enron scand=
al is whether it is a case of strong laws being violated by bad people, or =
of weak laws rendering such violations unnecessary. "If a company of this s=
ize, advised by top-tier accountants and law firms, could conclude that our=
 laws permit some of what happened here, then our laws are inadequate," sai=
d Richard C. Breeden, a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Comm=
ission. "Clearly it violates the spirit and intent of securities laws and t=
he whole concept of full and fair disclosure."=20
The quandary is particularly acute in the case of this partnership, because=
 it seemed to thrive on arrangements -- procedural barriers known as "Chine=
se walls" -- that were actually intended to protect investors. These legal =
barriers prevented investment bankers who were privy to information about t=
he partnership from legally sharing that information with shareholders. Ins=
tead, investors remained in the dark about Enron's actual financial conditi=
on.=20
But the partnership, lawyers and finance experts say, raises novel question=
s about the effectiveness of other parts of the securities laws, as well. T=
hese include prohibitions against trading on inside information; rules agai=
nst selectively disclosing information to some shareholders and not others;=
 efforts to police corporate conflicts of interest and the wisdom of removi=
ng restrictions on the roles that investment banks can play. "No matter how=
 good you make the laws, there will always be a small group of people who w=
ill push them," said John Pound, a former finance professor at Harvard and =
the president of Integrity Partners, an investment management firm in Bosto=
n. "But the Enron case has raised a lot of useful and important policy ques=
tions that will need to be addressed. And the Chinese-wall issue is a perfe=
ct example of that."=20
Enron's swift fall, culminating in its bankruptcy filing in early December,=
 came after the company revised its past financial statements to more accur=
ately reflect partnership deals like the LJM2 arrangement. The company and =
its auditor, Arthur Andersen, are the subjects of both criminal and regulat=
ory investigations, and are being examined by nearly a dozen Congressional =
committees.=20
One important focus of those investigations is the way that partnerships li=
ke LJM2 contributed to the company's collapse.=20
Confidential records of that specific partnership, disclosed in The New Yor=
k Times, show that Enron tried to attract investors by dangling the prospec=
t of potentially remarkable returns, driven by access to inside information=
 about Enron's financial dealings.=20
Potential investors were told, in detail, about the company's off-the- book=
s transactions and assets, information that Enron had not disclosed to its =
public shareholders. Indeed, partnership investors knew that Enron controll=
ed at least 50% more assets than the company had disclosed in its audited f=
inancial statements, filed with the SEC and provided to public shareholders=
.=20
That lopsided flow of information strikes many legal experts as a direct ch=
allenge to traditional thinking about Chinese walls, the common nickname fo=
r the procedures that assure that the confidential information Wall Street =
firms obtain from their corporate investment banking clients remains confid=
ential, even within the firm itself.=20
Chinese walls came into being in the late 1960s, as a regulatory response t=
o the increased complexity of Wall Street firms and a more vigorous SEC res=
ponse to insider trading, said Michael Perino, a securities law professor a=
t St. John's University.=20
Their purpose, quite simply, was to prevent an investment banker from using=
 confidential information about a corporate client to make trades in that c=
lient's stock -- trades in which the banker would have an advantage over ot=
her investors.=20
In 1988, at the end of a decade punctuated by insider trading scandals, Con=
gress made such "informational partitions" mandatory, citing the need to pr=
event Wall Street insiders from taking advantage of Main Street investors.=
=20
But in this case, it appears that the protection backfired, legal experts s=
aid. Investment bankers who worked on the Enron partnerships were privy to =
information that may have raised doubts about the information Enron had pro=
vided to public investors -- but they were forbidden by law from raising an=
y red flags.=20
"The purpose of the Chinese wall is to help public investors, but this work=
ed backwards," said Mr. Pound, the former Harvard professor. "What amazes m=
e is that the people who knew they had information adverse to the public in=
vestors would not feel a need to find a way, within the institution, to add=
ress that issue -- to go up in the institution high enough to say, `We have=
 a policy problem here.' "=20
The LJM2 partnership points up Chinese-wall problems that courts and regula=
tors have been struggling to resolve for years, said John Coffee Jr., a sec=
urities law expert at Columbia University Law School.=20
If the investment banking divisions of a brokerage firm had information tha=
t raised questions about the value of a public company's stock, there is no=
thing under the current law that the bankers could do to help the firm's re=
tail investors. But there are more limited actions the firm could take, Mr.=
 Coffee said.=20
"They can't go out and privately tell their clients the full information th=
ey have received without being part of an insider trading scheme," he said.=
 "But they could arguably use the information to withdraw their recommendat=
ion on the stock." That, he added, "will cause some consternation and adver=
se publicity that would alert the market to a problem.=20
Other legal experts worry that the investment banks dealing with Enron were=
 constrained by conflicts between their role as lenders and their work as u=
nderwriters.=20
This conflict, too, has roots deep in U.S. financial history. In the decade=
 before the 1929 crash, banks would sometimes help a failing firm sell stoc=
k to the bank's customers to raise money to repay loans. As part of the New=
 Deal, Congress passed the Glass- Steagall Act, which prevented banks from =
providing both underwriting and traditional banking services.=20
But long before Congress officially repealed Glass-Steagall in 1999, Street=
 firms found legal detours around the prohibition. Now, some securities law=
 experts said, Congress may need to take a fresh look at whether these dual=
 roles in any way affected the flow of significant information to public in=
vestors in Enron.=20
Mr. Breeden, the former SEC chairman, said no direct parallels to the class=
ic pre-1929 conflicts have appeared. But Enron's evolution "was a very subt=
le situation, and very complex. In any case," he added, "the public should =
be able to conclude where the investment banks' greatest interests lie."=20
That investors in the LJM2 partnership apparently got information that publ=
ic investors could not get -- because Enron had moved certain operations of=
f its balance sheet -- also underscores the importance of preventing select=
ive disclosure by corporations, one former SEC commissioner said.=20
Until last January, corporate executives would routinely hold private brief=
ings for analysts, slipping them details that were not available to public =
investors. To "level the playing field," the SEC enacted Regulation FD, whi=
ch forbids such selective disclosure.=20
It is not clear from available documents whether partnership investors cont=
inued to learn about Enron's finances after the new rule went into effect. =
"But if they did, that raises blazing questions of selective disclosure," t=
he former commissioner said. More broadly, he said, regulators should deter=
mine whether other corporations that use off-balance- sheet entities are gi=
ving investors in those entities more information than public stockholders =
receive.=20
Sheldon Elsen, a securities lawyer at Orans Elsen & Lupert in New York, sai=
d the structure of the LJM2 partnership "really presents some very troublin=
g problems. I don't know that there is anything illegal here," Mr. Elsen sa=
id, "but there is a terrible odour about it."=20
James Moriarty, a Houston lawyer who has represented plaintiffs in a number=
 of securities fraud cases, said: "That they would tell the truth to the ri=
ch investors, and lie to their stockholders, is outside the realm of the co=
mprehensible."=20
Enron might argue that the information potential partnership investors got =
was not important enough to require disclosure.=20
But lawyers said the fact Enron disclosed the information to them would be =
evidence in itself that such details were material. "Given that they give t=
he information to somebody else as part of their bargain to raise money for=
 another deal, there is a strong likelihood that it would reach the materia=
lity level," said Stanley Arkin, a New York corporate and securities lawyer=
.=20
But the information gap between partnership investors and public stockholde=
rs is just one of the conflicts that litter the Enron battlefield, legal ex=
perts say.=20
Congress is already wrestling with the potential conflicts that confront ou=
tside accounting firms, like Arthur Andersen. The firms act both as indepen=
dent auditors -- which companies must have, by federal law -- and consultan=
ts on tax and technology issues.=20
But that, too, just scratches the surface. The LJM2 partnership, like sever=
al others set up by Enron, was run by a general partnership, LJM2 Capital P=
artners, and managed by a second partnership, LJM2 Capital Management. The =
people behind both partnerships -- the "principals" -- were all Enron execu=
tives, including Andrew S. Fastow, Enron's chief financial officer, and Mic=
hael J. Kopper, managing director at Enron's global equity markets group. "=
Investors should be aware that there will be occasions where the general pa=
rtner and its affiliates may encounter potential conflicts of interest in c=
onnection with the partnership's activities," the partnership sales documen=
ts said. It explained that the principals "are employees at Enron and owe f=
iduciary duties to Enron and its subsidiaries; such fiduciary duties may fr=
om time to time conflict with fiduciary duties owed to the partnership and =
its partners."=20
Enron's board specifically approved Mr. Fastow's role by exempting him from=
 the corporate conflict- of-interest policy -- a step that Mr. Breeden foun=
d inexplicable. "The very notion that the chief financial officer of a majo=
r corporation could have divided loyalties to this degree of magnitude is s=
omething I wouldn't have believed any board of directors would allow -- or =
that any CFO would accept," Mr. Breeden said. "The CFO is the financial con=
science of the company, the guardian of the numbers. If he has a conflict, =
how can the system work?"=20
What is known about Enron's partnership arrangements so far, he said, revea=
ls an even more profound conflict between management and shareholders. Beca=
use Enron had guaranteed the solvency of certain partnerships, obligations =
that were not disclosed on its balance sheet were secretly but steadily ero=
ding its financial health.=20
"It is as if Enron and its top officers had set up a loaded machine gun and=
 aimed it at the company -- and the shareholders didn't know it," Mr. Breed=
en said.=20
Two things, however, seem certain, legal experts said.=20
The first is that these fresh disclosures about how Enron's partnerships we=
re structured and sold will expand the number of defendants named in the sh=
areholder lawsuits aimed at trying to recover some of investors' market los=
ses, which have been estimated at more than US$60-billion.=20
Every large institution -- whether an underwriter or partnership investor -=
- that was aware of material information withheld from Enron investors coul=
d find itself in court, securities lawyers said.=20
Already, they said, lawyers are discussing which investors, institutions an=
d advisers are potential defendants. "The image I have in my mind is a long=
, long line of the wealthy and the powerful who made money out of these dea=
ls, all set up to hand it over to the people who lost everything in their E=
nron investments," said Mr. Moriarty.=20
The second consequence is likely to be systematic Congressional action to a=
mend the nation's securities laws, said Mr. Seligman.

USA: Kenneth Lay's wife says ex-Enron CEO is honest man.

(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

WASHINGTON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - The wife of former Enron CEO Kenneth Lay def=
ended her husband on Monday, saying he was an "honest, decent, moral" man w=
ho did nothing wrong in the devastating collapse of the energy trading gian=
t.=20
In an interview with NBC's "Today" show, Linda Lay said her husband, who qu=
it as chairman and chief executive officer of Enron Corp. last week, had be=
en grossly misunderstood and was victim of "mass hysteria" surrounding the =
biggest bankruptcy case in U.S. history.
"Nobody even knows what the truth is yet. The only thing I know, 100 percen=
t for sure, is that my husband is an honest, decent, moral human being who =
would do absolutely nothing wrong. That I know 100 percent," she said.=20
Linda Lay, whose five children also defended their father, said she could u=
nderstand the anger and loss felt by Enron employees when they recalled her=
 husband's publicly upbeat attitude toward the company before it dived.=20
Much of the criticism of Lay has centered on mounting evidence he knew of t=
he energy company's debt-ridden position even as he was advising his staff =
to buy Enron stock, which is now worthless.=20
"If I were back there listening to all the things that were being said I wo=
uld absolutely have to say, 'What is wrong here? How can all of this be hap=
pening without someone doing something terribly wrong?'" Linda Lay said.=20
But she said there were man things her husband had not been told that would=
 come out in the many investigations now under way.=20
"Those things will all come to light and that's what we're all praying for.=
"=20
Congressional hearings began in Washington last week into Enron's fall and =
the role of its auditor, Big Five accounting firm Andersen. Legislators are=
 very interested in the destruction of thousands of documents related to En=
ron audits.=20
REALITY SET IN IT WAS OVER=20
Linda Lay broke down as she recalled a couple of days before Enron collapse=
d when her husband came home from work and said he could not turn the compa=
ny around.=20
"He said he had tried everything he could think of and he could not stop it=
," she sobbed, adding: "(He was) devastated, devastated for his employees."=
=20
Asked how she felt toward those who said her husband betrayed them, she rep=
lied, "We've lost everything but I don't feel Ken has betrayed me. I'm sad,=
 I'm desperately sad but I don't know where to place the anger. I don't kno=
w who to get mad at. I just know my husband did not have an involvement."=
=20
Like many of those affected by Enron's woes, Linda Lay said her own family =
was fighting for survival and that everything except their home was for sal=
e.=20
"We are fighting for liquidity. We don't want to go bankrupt," she said, ad=
ding that nearly all of their fortune had been locked into Enron stock, whi=
ch is now worthless.=20
According to a lawsuit filed in federal court in Houston, Lay received $101=
 million in proceeds from the sale of Enron stock between October 1998 and =
November 2001.=20
The Enron saga took a tragic turn last Friday with the apparent suicide of =
J. Clifford Baxter, who had resigned as vice chairman of Enron Corp last ye=
ar and who was said to have opposed the accounting practices of the company=
.=20
Mrs. Lay said her family was devastated by Baxter's death, adding that her =
husband had spoken to him not too long ago.=20
"Cliff was a wonderful man. It's a perfect example of how the media can pla=
y such havoc and destruction in people's lives. This is the ultimate. This =
is a loss of life."=20
"It makes my heart, it makes Ken's heart ache," she added. "Had we known we=
 would have picked up the phone and called him. We would have gone and been=
 with him. We would have done anything we could to have helped him, helped =
his family but we had no idea he was in that kind of pain."=20
Lay came out of retirement last year to return to his old job as CEO. Asked=
 how she would change her life, if given the chance, his wife said: "Selfis=
hly, probably that my husband never went back to Enron."

Every day, the scandal at Enron brings a new shock, with no letup in sight.=
=20
The complex and jaw-dropping developments have even most jaded news consume=
rs shaking their heads.=20
Now, just imagine what it's like to still be working there.=20
In the morning, the papers are full of disturbing news about your employer'=
s business practices. At work, reporters are waiting outside the building. =
During the drive home, talk radio fills your ears with invective. At home, =
TV repeats the day's bad news and adds more.=20
On Friday, Enron workers learned of the suicide of former company Vice Chai=
rman Cliff Baxter, a member of upper management whom the employees admired.=
=20
"The stress has gotten so bad on me, so intense and so sustained, my brain =
could no longer take it," said one Enron employee.=20
He stopped watching and reading the news, because it had begun to affect hi=
m physically, though he knows he's missing out on information important to =
him.=20
"I feel like I'm flying blind," he said.=20
As might be expected, the mood at work is grim. Many wonder if Enron can so=
mehow survive. If not, will the employees be left out in the cold?=20
At this point, he said, "it's mostly about survival -- our own and the comp=
any's."=20
Understandably, all those who spoke to the Chronicle asked to remain anonym=
ous.=20
In mid-October, when Enron reported big third-quarter losses and the Securi=
ties and Exchange Commission began its inquiry, one trader began to see in =
his colleagues' eyes "a desolate, transparent, stare-out-in-space look."=20
"People were losing an enormous amount of money" in stock holdings and 401(=
k)s, the trader said.=20
By early November, when Dynegy announced its plan to buy Enron, employees w=
ere fearing for their jobs. Just before Thanksgiving, the apprehension inte=
nsified. The trader said he started getting 25 to 30 e-mails a day from peo=
ple saying, "If I'm not here tomorrow, here's my home phone number. In case=
 you hear of a new group starting up, here's how you can get ahold of me."=
=20
Then came Black Monday, when 4,200 people were laid off. Those who didn't l=
ose their jobs were nonetheless shocked and had a sense of mourning for the=
ir co-workers.=20
Recalling that day, a woman who works in the pipeline group said she, too, =
wanted to stay at her desk with her head buried.=20
"I felt guilt and hurt," she said. "Now, I'm more depressed. You definitely=
 don't want to be here anymore. Everyone I know has their r?sum?s out."=20
"There is probably a tremendous range of feelings," said Jonathan Kramer, a=
 consulting and business psychologist and director of businesspsychologist.=
com, based in La Jolla, Calif.=20
Some workers feel betrayed and angry, while others are depressed, scared ab=
out what's coming next, he said.=20
"Certainly, it's got to be stressful for almost everyone," he said.=20
Enron's downfall is hard on employees partly because they've been emotional=
ly tied to the company. "When it suffers, we suffer, too," Kramer said. "It=
's a very demoralizing experience."=20
Employees may feel lucky that they didn't get laid off, Kramer said, but th=
e overriding feeling is: Today, I have a job, but tomorrow I may not.=20
One trader described his situation as "a strange Catch-22: Hey, the only re=
ason I'm being kept around is because I have physical inventory. The faster=
 I move it, the faster I'm out of a job."=20
Traders don't have much to do, because there isn't much activity. In fact, =
said one employee, traders feel like they are part of the inventory, "like =
they're being retained for the sole purpose of being part of a buyout packa=
ge, like the software and hardware."=20
The people with "the most skill and drive have banded together," he said. "=
We're gonna take what's left of Enron and make something of it."=20
In the old days, there was immense pride, said one employee: "We were the H=
arvard of corporations. But management has managed to tarnish that image. E=
ach of us, instead of having a positive image on our r?sum?s from working h=
ere, now we may have something of a tarnished image ourselves."=20
They've gone from being envied to the butt of jokes.=20
"We've talked about how embarrassing it is to work here," said one woman wh=
o works in the pipeline division.=20
She said that whenever she has to fill out an application form somewhere, s=
he wants to lie about where she works now.=20
"We still have pride and still want to be with each other," she said. "It's=
 the executives we don't want to work for anymore."=20
She said Enron management was always secretive and is even more so now.=20
"The communication we get is from news reports," she said. "Enron only admi=
ts things when it comes out in the media. Wenever hear about what's going t=
o happen until after it's happened."=20
"The effect of secrecy is devastating," said Scott Sindelar, a business psy=
chologist based in Scottsdale, Ariz. "It increases anxiety and anger and th=
e likelihood of sabotage."=20
Sharing information is also the right thing to do ethically and from a busi=
ness standpoint, Sindelar said.=20
"You never know when you'll meet these same people along the road again," h=
e said.=20
It is best when you stay busy at work, one employee said, because then you =
don't think about everything.=20
"You kind of don't bring certain things up, like the names of people who us=
ed to work here," she said, "because it will kind of destroy the mood."=20
There are reminders, though. The names of laid-off workers are still on som=
e desks and chairs.=20
For the first time, the woman in the pipeline division sees divisions withi=
n the company.=20
"We used to all feel like one close-knitted company, but now it's like the =
traders are everything and everyone else is expendable," she said.=20
One employee said he felt no survivor's guilt about still having a job: "Pe=

Whenever there's news that a laid-off person got a job, "it kind of lifts e=

With half its people gone, Enron's building has vast empty spaces, though t=

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- A federal judge will give bankrupt Enron Corp. (ENRN=
Q) 60 days, or until April 2, to decide whether it wants to commit to five =
commodities contracts.
"Forcing an early decision to accept or reject could result in a loss of va=
lue to the estate," said Judge Arthur Gonzalez, during a Friday hearing at =
the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York.=20
With this ruling, the judge rejected motions by Enron's creditors - Natural=
 Gas Pipeline of America, Trailblazer Pipeline Co., Southern California Gas=
 Co., San Diego Gas & Electric Co. and Superior Industries International In=
c. (SUP) - aimed at forcing the company to immediately decide upon the agre=
ements.=20
The creditors claim that since Enron's bankruptcy, the company hasn't fully=
 honored its commitments. This has required third parties to step in to sup=
ply natural gas and electricity.=20
But Judge Gonzalez told creditors Friday that their businesses haven't been=
 significantly impaired by Enron's bankruptcy, as sufficient supplies of ga=
s and electricity continue to be available.=20
Also, Enron has said that its supply of the commodities to two California p=
ublic utilities - Southern California Gas Co. and San Diego Gas & Electric =
Co. - as well as other creditors are nearing 100% of levels prior to the De=
c. 2 bankruptcy filing.=20

Cheney refuses to release energy plan documents to Enron investigators=20
GAO may bring rare lawsuit over refusal=20
By KAREN MASTERSON=20
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle Washington Bureau=20
Jan. 28, 2002, 7:39AM
WASHINGTON -- In the face of political pressure to comply with congressiona=
l investigators, Vice President Dick Cheney said Sunday he will not release=
 internal documents connected to the development of President Bush's energy=
 plan.=20
That refusal is expected to fuel political outcries that the administration=
 is hiding information about its relationship with Enron Corp., and may pro=
mpt the General Accounting Office -- Congress' nonpartisan investigative ar=
m -- to file a rare lawsuit against the White House.=20
Cheney, who was asked on Sunday-morning news programs to defend his positio=
n, said White House attorneys looked into the matter and concluded that doc=
uments gathered by the task force he headed are protected by the rules of e=
xecutive privilege. The GAO contends that U.S. taxpayers paid for the task =
force and have a right to the information.=20
The GAO's jurisdiction "extends to agencies created by statute. That's not =
me," Cheney said on Fox News Sunday. "I'm a constitutional officer. The aut=
hority of the GAO does not extend in that case to my office."=20
Cheney showed no sign of compromising on the issue, and indicated he was un=
moved by recent polls that showed a majority of Americans distrust the admi=
nistration's relationship with Enron.=20
Bush's comprehensive energy plan, released in May and subsequently passed b=
y the Republican-controlled House, calls for more oil and gas drilling, par=
ticularly in the Alaskan wilderness, and a revival of the nuclear power ind=
ustry.=20
Democrats have since charged that the policies promoted in the plan were a =
payoff to industry executives, including Enron's, who had given generously =
to Bush's 2000 election campaign. For months, Democrats have demanded more =
details on who attended the meetings where the plan was forged and what was=
 said.=20
The collapse of Enron has complicated the administration's refusal to compl=
y, and given Democrats a second opportunity to draw attention to those meet=
ings.=20
"The General Accounting Office is on solid ground in demanding that these r=
ecords be turned over," Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said Su=
nday on CBS' Face the Nation. "The American people have a right to know wha=
t the facts are."=20
Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., speaking on CNN's Late Edition, said Cheney=
's most recent refusal to cooperate "raises more suspicions" and suggests t=
he White House may be hiding something. Lieberman chairs the Senate Governm=
ental Affairs Committee, which is investigating certain aspects of the Enro=
n debacle.=20
Cheney, who was put on the defensive on two nationally televised programs, =
said the White House has nothing to hide. Rather, he said that by rebuffing=
 the GAO's threat of legal action, the White House hopes to preserve the po=
wer of the presidency.=20
On ABC's This Week, Cheney said that giving in to the GAO would put "a chil=
l over the ability of the president and vice president to receive unvarnish=
ed advice. ... It would make it virtually impossible for me to have confide=
ntial conversations with anybody."=20
But one Republican said the appearance of impropriety would grow as a conse=
quence of not cooperating.=20
"Unfortunately, as a result of Richard Nixon years ago, when anybody hears =
the term `executive privilege,' they assume something bad was going on," sa=
id Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. "There's no evidence anything bad was going =
on here; there's not a scintilla of evidence that the administration was do=
ing Enron's bidding."=20
But polls suggest the public doesn't need a causal link between campaign co=
ntributions and pro-Enron policies to distrust the process. In a newly rele=
ased New York Times/CBS poll, a majority of those surveyed said they see Re=
publicans as far more enmeshed in Enron's problems than Democrats.=20
Only 17 percent of those polled said they thought the Bush administration w=
as telling the truth; 58 percent said the administration was mostly telling=
 the truth but hiding something, and 9 percent said officials were lying.=
=20
In December, Enron, once ranked No. 7 on the Fortune 500 big businesses lis=
t, filed for the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history. The company's collapse=
 devastated retirement accounts, eliminated thousands of jobs and raised qu=
estions about Bush's close ties to the company and its former head, Ken Lay=
.=20
And it gave Democrats an issue they hope to use against Republicans in the =
upcoming midterm elections.=20
"The issue is not what they took, but what did Enron get," Terry McAuliffe,=
 Democratic Party chairman, said on Late Edition. "It seems clear that what=
 they got is an energy policy, 17 different specific proposals that helped =
Enron."=20
McAuliffe was referring to a report issued by the head Democrat on the Hous=
e Governmental Reform Committee, Rep. Henry Waxman of California, that sugg=
ested Enron's influence was evident in 17 measures included in the Bush pol=
icies.=20
But Republicans have called the document a partisan attempt to create a sca=
ndal that does not exist. GOP leaders indicated Sunday that they will conti=
nue to deflect any hint of scandal by emphasizing that the criminal and con=
gressional investigations of Enron are not yet complete.=20
"The bottom line is, the president wants to understand all of the facts jus=
t as much as anyone else does," Montana Gov. Marc Racicot, Republican Party=
 chairman, said on Late Edition. "The administration does, and clearly Cong=
ress does. And I think that is what we ought to be focusing on."=20

Did Andersen Speed Up the Shredding? Documents just released by a House sub=
committee suggest the firm may have rushed its document destruction after l=
earning of the SEC probe
By Mike McNamee in Washington

01/28/2002
BusinessWeek Online
(Copyright 2002 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)

The Houston office of accountant Arthur Andersen may have accelerated its e=
fforts to destroy Enron's audit records -- requiring staffers to work overt=
ime -- after it learned the Securities & Exchange Commission was investigat=
ing Enron's accounting, documents released on Jan. 24 by a House Energy & C=
ommerce subcommittee suggest.=20
The documents -- e-mail messages obtained by BusinessWeek -- show that Davi=
d B. Duncan, Andersen's lead partner on the Enron account, called a "mandat=
ory" meeting on Oct. 23, 2001, "to discuss the current events of Enron." Th=
at was the day after Enron issued a press release disclosing the SEC had re=
quested information about the accounting treatment of the partnership deals=
 that ended up costing Enron $588 million in profit writedowns.
On Oct. 24, the day after the Andersen meeting, Kimberly H. Latham, an Ande=
rsen manager on the Enron account, instructed her staff to cooperate with e=
fforts "to insure that our team is in compliance with the Andersen document=
ation retention guidelines." The staffer who Latham delegated to follow thr=
ough was less politic: He referred to his task as a "cleanup" of computer f=
iles, and on Oct. 25 he gave his colleagues a list of computer directories =
"that I would like you to clean out," according to the e-mails.=20
REGARDING "RETENTION." While they're called "retention guidelines," Anderse=
n's rules regarding records actually call for disposing of documents on a r=
egular schedule. According to Andersen officials, the firm keeps only the p=
apers it deems to be essential to the audit. The guidelines contain excepti=
ons -- including instructions that routine document disposal should cease w=
hen the firm learns of "threatened or actual commencement of litigation, go=
vernmental, and/or professional investigations."=20
That makes the wording and timing of the e-mails significant. Congressional=
 probers investigating the Enron affair believe the memos suggest that the =
destruction of records may have been a deliberate attempt to sweep away the=
 history of the Enron audits. Andersen has acknowledged its Houston office =
destroyed thousands of documents relating to Enron, stopping only when the =
firm was subpoenaed by the SEC on Nov. 8.=20
The computer files referred to in the Oct. 24 and Oct. 25 e-mails weren't y=
et subject to subpoena, but they appear to fall under Andersen's policies r=
equiring a freeze when an audit is under investigation, the congressional p=
robers believe.=20
COVERING TRACKS? A House Energy & Commerce Committee subcommittee has subpo=
enaed Andersen officials, including Duncan and CEO Joseph Berardino, to tes=
tify about the shredding and discarding of documents. The panel has copies =
of the e-mails and is investigating them, says Ken Johnson, committee spoke=
sman. "This has all the outward appearance of people desperately trying to =
cover their tracks," Johnson says.=20
After reviewing copies of the e-mails, an Andersen official said they back =
up the firm's contention that Duncan directed the shredding campaign. Ander=
sen fired Duncan on Jan. 15 and put partner Thomas H. Bauer, who convened t=
he Oct. 23 meeting with Duncan, on administrative leave. "It's clear that D=
avid Duncan, a certified public accountant with full knowledge of an SEC in=
vestigation, ordered a full-scale document-destruction campaign," says the =
Andersen official, who spoke on the condition he not be named. "That's cons=
istent with what we found in our internal review."=20
Duncan's attorney could not be reached for comment.=20
But the e-mails put the cleanup in the context of Andersen's document reten=
tion policies, which could pose problems for the firm. On Oct. 12, an Ander=
sen attorney sent an e-mail to Houston reminding partners and managers of t=
he need to keep up with disposal of outdated documents. Andersen has insist=
ed the lawyer's reminder was routine and unrelated to Enron -- but that Dun=
can's directions to his staff were not.=20
"DO WHAT IS NECESSARY." Indeed, the e-mails present the cleanup as an urgen=
t matter. In her Oct. 24 note, Latham told her staff that her supervisor "e=
xpects everyone to do what is necessary to adhere to the guidelines. Obviou=
sly this should not interfere with client obligations...; however, we do ex=
pect that people will be able to do this on an overtime basis, if necessary=
, for the remainder of the week, or for however long it takes."=20
Contacted by BusinessWeek Online, Latham said she could not immediately com=
ment on questions about her e-mails.=20
The Andersen official says no action has been taken against Latham or her s=
upervisor, partner Michael P. Schultz.

ENRON'S TROUBLES ENSNARE LEADING TEXAS LAW FIRM
DAVID KOENIG, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

(Copyright 2002)

Vinson & Elkins' reputation took 80 years to polish and one client to smudg=
e.=20
The largest law firm in Houston and the most profitable in Texas, Vinson & =
Elkins has been stung by accusations it showed poor judgment -- or worse --=
 in work for Enron Corp.
An Enron insider claims Vinson & Elkins blessed partnership deals that hid =
the energy trading company's shaky financial situation until it collapsed i=
nto bankruptcy.=20
Outside lawyers say the firm violated ethical standards by reviewing the ac=
cusations itself instead of demanding an impartial, outside review.=20
V&E has worked for Enron since the energy company's founding in the mid-198=
0s and Enron is now its biggest client, accounting for $35 million of its $=
450 million in billings last year.=20
Vinson & Elkins' work for Enron might not have attracted much attention but=
 for an Enron executive's letter written in August to chairman Kenneth Lay.=
=20
The executive, Sherron Watkins, fretted that Enron could "implode in a wave=
 of accounting scandals," and urged the company to hire a law firm to inves=
tigate murky accounting and partnership deals that helped keep billions in =
debt off Enron's books.=20
"Can't use V&E due to conflict -- they provided some true sale opinions on =
some of the deals," Watkins wrote. Lawyers write true sale opinions on the =
legality of transactions.=20
Enron ignored Watkins' plea and turned back to Vinson & Elkins. In October,=
 V&E partner Max Hendrick III wrote to Enron's general counsel James Derric=
k Jr., a former V&E partner, that Watkins' charges could prove embarrassing=
 but merited no further investigation.=20
A spokesman for Vinson & Elkins, Joe Householder, said the firm couldn't di=
scuss its work for Enron because it still represents the company.=20
Founded in 1917, the firm specialized in working with banks to provide lega=
l advice and financing to Texas' then-young oil industry, and it grew rapid=
ly as the energy sector boomed.=20
Vinson & Elkins partners, who once included former Texas Gov. John Connally=
, grew rich. The law firm forged close ties with many Texas politicians, es=
pecially President Bush.=20
But the firm also developed a progressive reputation for doing pro bono wor=
k on civil-liberties cases and for hiring female, black and Jewish partners=
 in the 1970s, before many other Texas law firms did.

"Enron Is Just the Worst Example"; Billy Tauzin says his panel's probe has =
alerted him to "real problems...in the structure of Corporate America"
Cohn writes for BusinessWeek in Washington

01/28/2002
BusinessWeek Online
(Copyright 2002 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)

Billy Tauzin likes the spotlight. Last year, the Louisiana Republican, who =
chairs the House Energy & Commerce Committee, held high-profile hearings on=
 the failure of network TV to call the 2000 Presidential results correctly =
on election night. Later, he honed in on the Ford Explorer/Firestone tire f=
iasco. And remember California's blackouts? He held hearings on that issue,=
 too.=20
Known as the "Cagey Cajun" on Capitol Hill, Tauzin's latest mission will be=
 getting to the bottom of the rapid demise of Enron, the energy trader that=
 became the biggest corporate bankruptcy in the nation's history on Dec. 2.=
 And while his panel is one of several probing Enron, he has been first out=
 of the box with hearings (see "The Swamp Fox on Enron's Tail"). Tauzin has=
 15 of his staffers on the case, and so far they've collected 80 boxes of d=
ocuments, interviewed several key officials at Enron and its auditor, Arthu=
r Andersen, and traveled to Houston to dig up information on the company's =
home base.
On Jan. 18, Tauzin took time to talk with BusinessWeek Correspondent Laura =
Cohn about what he expects to emerge from his latest investigation and what=
 policy changes might be needed. Here are edited excerpts from their conver=
sation:=20
Q: What are your expectations here?=20
A: The first thing we have to do is, obviously, get the facts the best we c=
an. We want to get a sense of what Enron was doing, how they were doing it,=
 and what went wrong. Obviously, a lot of people got burned, and so we need=
 to know why. We need to know the good, the bad, and the ugly.=20
Q: Will people go to jail as a result of the Enron debacle?=20
A: There may well be. [The] Justice [Dept.] would not be launching an inves=
tigation if there were not at least some possibility of criminal wrongdoing=
. We know there has been some document destruction. It may have all been in=
nocent, it may have all been stupid, or it may have all been criminal. We j=
ust don't know yet.=20
Q: Will there be policy changes as a result of this?=20
A: Almost certainly. For a long time, I have defended the practice of accou=
nting firms doing both the audit function and the consulting function [for =
the same client]. We'd assumed those functions could be conducted without t=
he kind of conflicts of interest that may have been present here. We're lea=
rning differently.=20
We're learning that maybe there are some problems here, maybe those rules n=
eed to be changed. We're going to most likely see some changes in the way i=
n which the accounting rules are enforced and, in all probability, in the r=
ules themselves.=20
Q: In the past, you've been a big backer of the accounting industry, and yo=
u disagreed with former Securities & Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Le=
vitt Jr.'s push to clamp down on conflicts of interest in the industry. Hav=
e you changed your view?=20
A: Several years ago, when he was making the case, we didn't see evidence o=
f the problem. Today, it's kind of hard to say there isn't evidence of a pr=
oblem. Arthur Levitt was right. We need to make some changes.=20
Q: What sort of changes?=20
A: There's clearly a need for more disclosure. We're finding out that there=
 are real problems endemic in the structure of Corporate America that we ne=
ed to deal with. Enron is just the worst example that we're going to have t=
o take into the lab and completely dissect in order to find out what went w=
rong.=20
Q: I understand you're quite a hunter. What are you hunting these days?=20
A: I'm on a deer hunt right now. I'm an avid fisherman, hunter, and outdoor=
sman. Whenever I get a break, I try to do that.=20
Q: I understand you're quite a chef as well.=20
A: Yeah. I don't hunt anything I can't cook, let me put it that way. My rul=
e is if you take it, you cook it.

UK govt denies wrongdoing in connection with Enron, Arthur Andersen

01/28/2002
AFX News
(c) 2002 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

LONDON (AFX) - Prime Minister Tony Blair's spokesman denied the government =
had committed any wrongdoing in connection with failed US energy group Enro=
n Corp and its accountants Arthur Andersen.=20
"We would refute absolutely that there has been any impropriety," he told r=
eporters, after opposition Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Matthew Tayl=
or called for an inquiry into the Labour Party's "extremely close links" wi=
th both Enron and Arthur Andersen.
The Labour government spokesman said: "Yes, Enron representatives have met =
government ministers from the DTI (Department of Trade and Industry) over t=
he course of the years since the government came to power.=20
"They are not alone in that and at some meetings they were there with repre=
sentatives of other companies."=20
Taylor told BBC radio: "Labour have chosen to build very close links with b=
usiness on a pretty dubious basis where they have received money and help o=
n the one hand from businesses benefiting very much from government policy =
on the other."=20
He added: "We know that in the United States, Enron used extensive politica=
l contacts to seek to further its interests and there is good evidence of t=
he same happening here in the UK."=20
Taylor said former Labour employees were taken on by Enron to lobby for a c=
hange in gas policy -- changes which were subsequently pushed through. He a=
dded that Enron may have curried favour at the time of its takeover of Wess=
ex Water by paying for tables at the Labour Party conference.=20
Taylor also called for an investigation into Labour's links with Arthur And=
ersen, the accountancy firm which failed to spot the black hole in Enron's =
finances before its collapse late last year.=20
Taylor said Arthur Andersen, which had been barred from doing business with=
 previous UK governments for 12 years after being blacklisted for its work =
as auditor to failed carmaker De Lorean, had built very close links with th=
e Labour Party since then.=20
He said the accountants' "free work" for the Labour Party between 1992-1997=
 "appears to have paid off, because just after the general election they we=
re brought back into government business and have been absolutely at the ce=
ntre of what has been happening in government since and with some very ques=
tionable reports that have backed the Labour government."=20
The current trade minister, Patricia Hewitt, was Andersen's head of researc=
h until the current Labour government came to power in 1997.=20

SEC's Top Cop Says Enron 'Not Going To Distract Us'
By Judith Burns

Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES=20

SAN DIEGO -(Dow Jones)- Investigation into the collapse of Enron Corp. (ENR=
NQ) won't stop regulators from pursuing other cases, the top cop at the Sec=
urities and Exchange Commission said Friday.
"Enron's not going to distract us," SEC enforcement division director Steph=
en Cutler said at a Northwestern University legal conference here. He gave =
the usual disclaimer that his remarks reflect his own views, not those of t=
he SEC.=20
The SEC began investigating Enron last October, after the Houston energy co=
mpany announced it had overstated four-and-a-half years of earnings. The SE=
C later expanded the probe to include document destruction by Enron's outsi=
de auditor, Arthur Andersen. A criminal investigation by the Justice Depart=
ment also is under way, along with investigation by numerous congressional =
committees.=20
"People may have a sense that all we care about is Enron," said Cutler.=20
While he acknowledged the case is getting a lot of attention, he said it wo=
n't stop other SEC investigations in their tracks, and promised that in com=
ing months, "you'll be seeing lots of good cases from us."=20
Connections between SEC commissioners and accounting firms won't stop the a=
gency from cracking down on accounting fraud, Cutler indicated.=20
Some critics have questioned whether the SEC may adopt a softer touch on ac=
countants given that Chairman Harvey Pitt represented accounting firms in h=
is past law practice, and the newly named commissioner Cynthia Glassman wor=
ked for a Big Five accounting firm.=20
"I think there's a misperception out there about this new commission and it=
s willingness to be tough" in fighting financial fraud, Cutler said.=20
Accounting cases account for the bulk of the SEC's enforcement actions now.=
 Last year, the agency brought more than 100 cases alleging financial fraud=
 and in case, obtained a record $7 million settlement from Andersen for its=
 role in auditing Waste Management Inc., another big accounting blowup.=20
Cutler said the fine, the largest ever paid by a Big Five accounting firm, =
shows that in financial fraud cases, audit firms "will be held accountable"=
 along with audit partners.=20
Independence is another area getting close scrutiny from SEC attorneys, Cut=
ler indicated. The SEC recently settled a case against KPMG that alleged it=
 violated independence rules by investing in a mutual fund that was an audi=
t client.=20
"There will be other independence cases to come," Cutler added. He said the=
 agency is concerned when a "web of relationships" or business deals might =
cloud an auditor's judgment or undermine independence.=20

INDIA: Gaz de France to bid for Enron with Indian partner.
By Himangshu Watts

01/28/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

DAHEJ, India, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Gaz de France would find a partner to bid =
jointly for Enron Corp's $2.9 billion power project in India, as it is only=
 interested in the LNG portion of the project, an official of the French ut=
ility said on Monday.=20
"Probably we would participate in the bidding with an Indian parter," Jacqu=
es Gautier, project director of Gaz de France, told reporters at the founda=
tion stone laying ceremony of a LNG import terminal at the port of Dahej, G=
ujarat, on India's west coast.
So far six major companies - three foreign and three Indian - have expresse=
d interest in bidding for the massive 2,184 MW Dabhol plant and LNG facilit=
y located about 250 km (155 miles) south of Bombay.=20
The bidding process for the power plant and adjacent liquified natural gas =
(LNG) facility is expected to start later this week.=20
In addition to Gaz de France, the potential foreign bidders are Royal Dutch=
/Shell and European oil major TotalFinaElf . The possible Indian bidders ar=
e private power utilities BSES Ltd , Tata Power Company , and Gas Authority=
 of India .=20
Gautier said Gaz de France was interested only in Dabhol's LNG facility and=
 added the firm was discussing this with the Indian lenders to the power pr=
oject.=20
"We have no intention to enter the electricity market in India," Gautier sa=
id.=20
Lenders led by India's Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) have mad=
e it clear that they intend to sell the facility as a whole, instead of acc=
epting separate bids for the power plant and the LNG landing jetty and stor=
age depot.=20
But parties could form a consortium to bid jointly for the project and then=
 split it up, lenders say.=20
Gautier said if Gaz De France were successful in bidding for the LNG facili=
ty, it would find additional customers. Currently, Dabhol Power Co, the com=
pany set up to build and operate the plant, is the sole customer for the LN=
G facility.=20
ESSENTIAL BACKGROUND=20
The entire Dabhol facility has lain idle since June due to a dispute over t=
he cost of power provided to its sole customer, a nearly bankrupt Indian st=
ate utility.=20
The power plant was almost complete when construction on the 1,444 MW secon=
d phase was halted after the state electricity board fell $240 million behi=
nd in payments for power provided. The 740 MW first phase began operating i=
n May 1999.=20
Enron, the Houston-based energy trader which collapsed late last year, beco=
ming the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history, owns a 65 percent stake in Dab=
hol Power Co.=20
General Electric Co and U.S.-based contractor Bechtel Corp each own 10 perc=
ent, and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) the remaining 15 pe=
rcent.=20
Gaz de France owns 10 percent of Petronet LNG import terminal at Dahej. The=
 remainder is owned by four Indian state-run oil and gas companies and Qata=
r's Ras Laffan Liquified Natural Gas Co.=20

A year of good luck.
By SWAMINOMICS/SWAMINATHAN S ANKLESARIA AIYAR.

01/28/2002

Copyright (C) 2002 The Times of India

Republic Day is an occasion for ruminating on events of the past year. We c=
an hardly claim that it was a year of good political or economic management=
. Yet India ended the year a clear winner because good luck overcame the lo=
sses caused by poor management.=20
The two major strokes of luck both related to events in America. One was th=
e bombing of the World Trade Centre last September. President Bush declared=
 war on terrorism. He forced Pakistan to turn against the Taliban and ban t=
he Lashkar-e-Toiba and Jaish-e-Muhammad. This laid the ground for President=
 Musharraf to declare war on jehad and call for a new secular Pakistan. Thi=
s is an astonishingly favourable turn of events for India. We could never h=
ave achieved it through the most astute political or diplomatic stratagems.=
 It fell into our laps like manna from heaven. Osama bin Laden, thanks very=
 much.
On the economic side, the biggest mess continues to be non-reform of the po=
wer sector. This was exemplified in Maharashtra's refusal to buy power at t=
he contracted rate from the Dabhol plant of Enron. Many questions have been=
 raised about the Dabhol contract in the past, but all efforts to establish=
 corruption have failed, and the contract was anyway revised to rectify sup=
posed shortcomings.=20
>From the viewpoint of the global business, Maharashtra was guilty of wilful=
 default, and India's name became mud to global investors. All other foreig=
n power companies operating in India decided to quit because the mind-set o=
f other state governments was not materially different from Maharashtra's. =
The culture of non-payment in the sector is deeply entrenched: The state el=
ectricity boards have payment arrears of a whopping Rs 40,000 crore, as muc=
h as the GNP of many developing countries. And then manna fell from the hea=
vens again.=20
In the US, Enron collapsed with lightning speed in the last quarter of 2001=
, amid accusations of fudged accounts, collusion with auditors, and attempt=
s to fool investors and lenders. In the case of Dabhol, Americans saw Enron=
 as a victim and India as an oppressor. But after its collapse in December,=
 Enron's image became that of an oppressor. Indeed, the word Enron has now =
become part of the English language as a synonym for lying and swindling. A=
 US Senator said the other day that he would not allow the US president to =
do an Enron to the tax bill.=20
Now, the Enron scandal in the US had nothing to do with its Dabhol operatio=
n. At Dabhol, Maharashtra accused Enron of making exorbitant profits. But t=
he accusation in the US was the very opposite, that Enron lost huge sums in=
 foreign ventures like Dabhol and then cooked its books to keep its losses =
and debts off its books. The company collapsed when the truth came to light=
.=20
>From the US viewpoint, the scandal was not that Enron made too much profit =
from infrastructure investments abroad, but too heavy losses, and so had to=
 dress up its balance sheet. Yet Enron has got such a bad name in the proce=
ss that this has let Maharashtra (and India) off the hook. It is a classic =
case of India's gross mismanagement being offset by sheer good luck.=20
The story on the political side is much the same. Atal Behari Vajpayee star=
ted 2001 with strong talk about Pakistani perfidy at Kargil, saying it was =
pointless to start a dialogue with Pakistan unless it foreswore support to =
militants in Kashmir. Pakistan did not oblige.=20
Yet Vajpayee then did a U-turn and invited Musharraf for a summit at Agra. =
There was much excitement at the possibility of a breakthrough. But Vajpaye=
e bungled the negotiation, was outmanoeuvred by Musharraf in the drafting o=
f an Agra Declaration, and suffered the ignominy of having the draft shot d=
own by his own Cabinet colleagues. Agra ended with Musharraf in high spirit=
s, having got the better by far of the exchange.=20
Yet within months bin Laden struck at New York, and President Bush declared=
 war on international terrorism. Suddenly the Agra fiasco no longer mattere=
d. The US obliged Pakistan to disown first the Taliban and then all terrori=
st groups including those it had used as its storm troopers in Kashmir, lik=
e the Lashkar-e-Toiba and Jaish-e-Muhammad. Vajpayee's mismanagement at Agr=
a was more than offset by his good luck.=20
A famous story tells how Napoleon chose a leading general for the French Ar=
my. The credentials of one candidate were explained to him at great length.=
 That's all very well, said Napoleon, but is he lucky? Napoleon, it seems, =
would have regarded Vajpayee as a good candidate.=20
Yet history proves that good luck soon runs out. Pakistan is a case in poin=
t. Under General Ayub Khan in the 1960s it ran a successful economy, and it=
s GDP growth was much faster than India's. But after he fell, economic mism=
anagement and corruption grew. Yet Pakistan thrived for another two decades=
 because of luck.=20
The loss of its eastern wing in 1971 was a political disaster, but an econo=
mic boon: It got rid of most of its poor and raised average living standard=
s. Then came the oil crisis of 1973, which initially seemed bad luck. But i=
t created a huge demand for Pakistani labour, and soon remittances from Pak=
istanis in the Gulf became the country's biggest export, papering over its =
growing failure in other export sectors. Luck seemed to be running out when=
 General Zia turned Islamic, and the US cut off foreign aid. But good luck =
returned with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. This fetched Pakistan mas=
sive foreign aid.=20
But its run of good luck ended with the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan.=
 After that, Pakistan has gone from one financial crisis to another, a begg=
ar in thrall to the IMF. That holds a lesson for India. Good luck has saved=
 our bacon in 2001. But we need in the coming year to depend on good manage=
ment rather than good luck. Otherwise we too will go the Pakistan way.

News - International - Americans `do not believe the White House'.
By Toby Harnden.

MORE than two thirds of Americans believe that the Bush administration is h=
iding something or lying about its relationship with Enron, according to a =
CBS-New York Times poll.=20
Although no allegations of wrongdoing have been made against the White Hous=
e, the poll underlined the potential political damage to Mr Bush by the col=
lapse of Enron, a major contributor to his election campaign. Dick Cheney, =
the vice-president, yesterday refused to release a list of business leaders=
 he met while formulating energy policy, saying that it would be "unprecede=
nted".
Congressional investigators have insisted that he should be compelled to di=
sclose the information and his refusal may add to suspicions of a cover-up.

Energy Trading: Still Thriving: Enron could become what Drexel was to junk =
market that survived it
Christopher O'Leary (christopher.oleary@tfn.com)

01/28/2002
Investment Dealers Digest
Copyright (c) 2002 Thomson Financial, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Despite the ever-lengthening woes of Enron Corp., whose stock has been deli=
sted and whose chief executive has just resigned, the energy trading market=
 that Enron essentially put on the map surprisingly has been thriving.=20
Many market players initially had been wary that the Enron scandal, which h=
as been a regular fixture of newspapers and television for the last two mon=
ths, would sully the whole concept of energy deregulation and the trading o=
f such esoteric properties as energy and weather derivatives. Some feared E=
nron rivals would be sitting in bankruptcy courts if the market entirely fe=
ll apart.
Yet so far, despite all the angry editorials and ominous Congressional spee=
ches about the practice of energy trading, the market has performed without=
 a hitch. The scandal "has not destroyed the industry that Enron had a role=
 in establishing-the energy derivatives market is still in good shape and e=
ven credit derivatives seem to have come out well," said John McCormack, a =
senior vp and head of the energy practice at Stern, Stewart & Co. "It's a g=
reat tragedy for Enron shareholders, but it's not had tremendous impact on =
the overall industry."=20
For some energy players, Enron's collapse has been the chance of a lifetime=
 to build market share and win business. Sources estimate about six to a do=
zen players are now working like mad to win over former Enron clients and f=
ill in the vacuum left behind by the once-colossal company. Those players i=
nclude Dynegy Inc., which very nearly bought Enron late last year, El Paso =
Corp., Williams Cos., Koch Energy Trading, Reliant Resources Inc. and Sempr=
a Energy, the holding company of San Diego Gas & Electric.=20
In addition, the scandal hasn't apparently scared off the Street either. Wh=
ile Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase, the two banks most directly tied to En=
ron, have understandably been not visible in recent months, sources said, m=
any of their rivals have been busy. UBS Warburg, which now owns Enron's tra=
ding operations, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown and Goldman Sachs are among the =
banks looking for new opportunities. While there will likely be fewer big-t=
icket mergers this year, the companies that most benefit from Enron's absen=
ce could gain market share and be in an optimum position to pounce on rival=
s.=20
Nor has the day-to-day business of energy trading been greatly affected. Mu=
ch energy trading that had been conducted through such avenues as Enron's p=
roprietary online system has moved to such places as the New York Mercantil=
e Exchange or the Intercontinental Exchange.=20
Yet bankers noted that despite the apparent calm in the energy trading mark=
et, some fundamental changes are occurring. McCormack noted a "growing skep=
ticism that now greets any mention of special-purpose entities," the type o=
f off-balance-sheet devices that Enron officials used essentially to disgui=
se their company's bleeding. "The call for transparency is much higher. I t=
hink companies are now erring on the side of more and not less disclosure,"=
 he said.=20
At the end of the day, the ultimate fate of energy trading is still up in t=
he air, though at least for the short-term, the market has survived and eve=
n prospered. Rather than being the market's cause of death, Enron is instea=
d seen by some players as an equivalent to Drexel Burnham Lambert. Like Enr=
on, Drexel came to embody and master its particular niche, high-yield bond =
underwriting; like Enron, Drexel spectacularly fell from grace. Yet high yi=
eld went on to become an established wing of structured finance, and banker=
s believe energy trading is on its way to permanence as well.

Enron's Web site shows irony of a ruined regime --- In virtual world, every=

U.S. Senate staffers moving back into anthrax-decontaminated offices last w=
eek are passing around a grim joke: "We have to evacuate again. They found =
traces of Enron in the air vents."=20
For Enron, it's fair to say, things are going from awful to horrible. The v=
isionary company has become the butt of wisecracks, the prey of plaintiffs'=
 lawyers, the target of countless investigators.
The U.S. Congress and the FBI are doggedly pursuing document shredders. Enr=
on chairman (and friend of all elected Washington) Kenneth L. Lay has resig=
ned, explaining drolly that multiple investigations "currently require much=
 of my time." The company's dwindling workforce is job-hunting and suing to=
 recover vanished retirement funds.=20
Yet, in the virtual world of Enron's Web site, the outlook is far, far brig=
hter.=20
"It's difficult to define Enron in a sentence," says a welcome message that=
, like so much at enron.com, is intriguing in a way its authors never antic=
ipated. "It's difficult, too, to talk about Enron without using the word 'i=
nnovative.' Most of the things we do have never been done before. We believ=
e in the economic benefits of open, competitive wholesale markets, and we p=
lay a leading role in creating them. No wonder Fortune surveys have named E=
nron the most innovative company in America for six years in a row."=20
There's a winning streak that may be endangered.=20
Clicking through Enron's Web site today is like touring the half-ruined pal=
ace of some vanquished regime that imagined its reign would never end. Ever=
ywhere there are ironic reminders of the glory that was, or at least was cl=
aimed.=20
Like the hundreds of pairs of shoes the Philippines' first lady Imelda Marc=
os left behind when she fled the presidential mansion or the gaudy sculptur=
es left in Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu's gargantuan palace, they ar=
e a bracing reminder of the dangers of hubris and the fleeting nature of hu=
man triumph.=20
True, here and there on enron.com you can find indications that all is not =
well: Above the speeding bicyclist on the opening page is a link to "Inform=
ation for Former Enron Employees Affected by Chapter 11 Filing." But most o=
f the site - as of Thursday - remained cheerfully intact.=20
Everyone's still smiling as they bustle about the new economy. Shirt-sleeve=
d managers introduce Web slide shows to explain the intricacies of weather =
derivatives and bandwidth trading. The slightly blurred, bright colour phot=
os give the impression of a company going places.=20
In the "Most Requested" section, you can jump to "Corporate Responsibility,=
" where you will learn that the company is "dedicated to the highest profes=
sional and ethical standards."=20
Employees and shareholders who feel they were fleeced may be surprised to r=
ead the details: "We treat others as we would like to be treated ourselves.=
 We do not tolerate abusive or disrespectful treatment. Ruthlessness, callo=
usness and arrogance don't belong here. We work with customers and prospect=
s openly, honestly and sincerely. When we say we will do something, we will=
 do it; when we say we cannot or will not do something, then we won't do it=
."=20
The bottom line in Enron's "Vision and Values" statement: "The great fun he=
re will be for all of us to discover just how good we can really be."=20
Or check out the Letter to Shareholders from the 2000 Annual Report: "At a =
minimum, we see our market opportunities companywide tripling over the next=
 five years. Enron is laser-focused on earnings per share, and we expect to=
 continue strong earnings performance."=20
"If you're on irony watch, this is the place," says Steve Baldwin, a Yonker=
s, N.Y., Web writer, as he surfs the Enron site.=20
Brewster Kahle, a computer pioneer and director of the Internet Archive (ar=
chive.org), an online collection of old Web pages of all kinds, says the de=
ceptive nature of Web sites extends far beyond the corporate world.=20
"On the Web, everything always looks brand-spanking new," says Kahle, of Sa=
n Francisco. "The question is, can I trust it? If companies go under, their=
 Web sites can just live on and on."=20
You can ride the Wayback Machine at Kahle's archive, named for a time-trave=
l device in the old Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoons, back to Web sites that h=
ave long been off-line.=20
At taleban.com, you can study the public relations messages the ousted Afgh=
an regime put out to the world in 1999: "The case is often made that Osama =
bin Laden is living in Kandahar under the administration of the Islamic Emi=
rate of Afghanistan. However the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan has moved h=
im to Kandahar to keep him under strict limitations. He is no longer allowe=
d to use Afghan soil to cause harm to any country."=20
'Most of the things we do have never been done before. We believe in the ec=
onomic benefits of open, competitive wholesale markets, and we play a leadi=
ng role in creating them."Ruthlessness, callousness and arrogance don't bel=
ong here. We work with customers and prospects openly, honestly and sincere=

Enron: even the grammar is bankrupt

It was inevitable: Enron the verb, Enron the adjective.=20
The bankrupt energy company's past imperfect behaviour has given us licence=
 to use Enron as something other than a noun in our daily language.
It happens all the time: O.J. Simpson's flight from justice became "doing a=
n O.J,'' just as Monica Lewinsky's Oval Office hijinks begat "getting Lewin=
skyed.''=20
>From Watergate to Whitewater to Enron's dramatic collapse, words that are p=
op-culture milestones invariably enter the popular vernacular in various fo=
rms.=20
Enron, justifiably, is today's hottest co-opted word.=20
In a recent debate on the U.S. Senate floor, Senate Majority Leader Tom Das=
chle compared the financial scandals surrounding Enron to Bush's budget and=
 tax policies: "I think that we are slowly "Enronizing'' the economy, Enron=
izing the budget,'' he said.=20
In a New York Times story on the demise of Tina Brown's Talk magazine, medi=
a critic Michael Wolff said of Brown:=20
"This is no ordinary failure. She staked everything and was wiped out. She'=
s a little Enron ish.''=20
Get it? Now try it yourself: "The Enronization of our country.'' "My compan=
y Enroned me.'' "He handled our accounts Enronishly.''

It was an irresistible proposition: Borrow billions of dollars, pay no inte=
rest, reap millions in tax breaks, and then wait for the debt to simply dis=
appear. That was the promise of zero-coupon convertible bonds, and companie=
s from Enron to Merrill Lynch binged on what seemed like free money.=20
But, of course, there was a catch: For this scenario to play out, a company=
's stock price had to rise sharply--and quickly. That's because investors b=
ought the bonds in the hope of converting them into equity--if the stock ta=
nked, the bonds would no longer be worth converting. So to make them more a=
ttractive to buyers, companies had to build in an escape hatch: If the stoc=
k price failed to rise sufficiently, investors could "put" (that is, sell) =
the bonds back to the company--in many cases, after just one year.
And that's exactly what's about to happen--to the tune of some $65 billion =
over the next three years. Stock prices have fallen so far that for at leas=
t half of these special hybrids, the prospect of conversion is now absurd. =
It simply won't happen. So bondholders are looking to get their money back =
the first chance they can. And because of the put feature, that is possible=
. Suddenly companies like Tyco, Comcast, and dozens more are on the hook fo=
r billions of dollars in debt and interest they thought they'd never have t=
o pay.=20
That could be very bad news for shareholders of these companies. After all,=
 they're the ones who are going to be picking up the tab when all that debt=
 comes due. Huge chunks of cash will disappear from balance sheets to repay=
 bondholders. Companies without enough cash-- and the majority fall into th=
is camp--are likely to face skyrocketing interest charges when they borrow =
money anew. That means sharply reduced earnings. Especially at risk are inv=
estors in companies with poor credit ratings--prime candidates for killer r=
efinancing costs. Some companies may even be forced to issue stock to pay o=
ff the debt, creating significant shareholder dilution, especially at curre=
nt depressed prices. To make matters worse, this is happening at a time whe=
n the economy is barreling downhill and corporate profits are already shrin=
king. "This is a ticking time bomb," warns Margaret Patel, manager of the P=
ioneer High Yield Bond fund, a top-performing junk fund.=20
The seeds of this mess were sown in mid-2000, when the stock market started=
 to falter. Companies in search of capital balked at the thought of selling=
 stock while their share prices were struggling. Zero-coupon convertible bo=
nds presented an attractive alternative because companies didn't have to ma=
ke cash interest payments on the bonds (hence the name "zero"). Instead iss=
uers offered an up-front discount--for instance, investors would buy a bond=
 for $700 and collect $1,000 when it matured.=20
Companies also gave investors the right to convert the bonds into a fixed n=
umber of common shares. But the bonds were structured so that conversion wo=
uld make sense only if the stock price rose significantly--in many cases, b=
y more than 50%. With that protective feature (called the conversion premiu=
m), zeros took off. Corporate issuers would pay no interest, and once their=
 stock prices had climbed back to acceptable levels, the debt would be swep=
t away into equity. "If the bonds are converted, it's a home run for everyb=
ody," says Jonathan Cohen, vice president of convertible-bond analysis at D=
eutsche Bank.=20
That four-bagger, of course, depends entirely on the stock price rising. If=
 it doesn't, the bondholders, armed with that handy put feature, can simply=
 sell the bonds back to the company. Great for bondholders, but not so hot =
for the company or its shareholders. But, hey, what are the odds of that ha=
ppening? "CFOs and CEOs believe that their stock will just continue to go u=
p," says Cohen. "They don't worry about the bond getting put."=20
If all this seems a little complicated, that's because it is. A real-life e=
xample should help. California-based electric utility Calpine issued $1 bil=
lion in zeros in April to refinance existing debt. At the time, the company=
's stock was trading at about $55 a share--severely undervalued in the opin=
ion of company management. "We really didn't want to sell equity at that po=
int," says Bob Kelly, Calpine's senior vice president of finance. So the co=
mpany instead opted to sell zeros, setting the conversion premium at a heft=
y 37%.=20
Still, with no cash interest payments and a stock price that had to rise si=
gnificantly to make conversion worthwhile, the bonds weren't exactly a scre=
aming buy for investors. So Calpine added the put feature: Investors could =
sell the bonds back to the company after one year at the full purchase pric=
e, eliminating any downside risk.=20
Things haven't exactly worked out as management had hoped. The stock has si=
nce plummeted to $25, and it now has to triple before conversion makes sens=
e. So it's looking as though Calpine will be liable for the $1 billion in b=
orrowed money when investors get the chance to put the bonds this April. Th=
ere's also the refinancing cost. According to Kelly, Calpine's borrowing ra=
te could run in the neighborhood of 8.5%--an extra $85 million per year in =
cash. "Obviously, nobody plans for their stock to go down," Kelly says. "I =
don't think there was one person around who thought the bond would be put."=
=20
Calpine's potential costs are particularly high because its credit rating i=
s straddling junk. "If you are a borderline investment-grade company, a fin=
ancing of this nature is not necessarily the most appropriate thing in the =
world," notes Anand Iyer, head of global convertible research at Morgan Sta=
nley. The problem is, there are a slew of companies with far worse credit r=
atings out there: Jeff Seidel, Credit Suisse First Boston's head of convert=
ible-bond research, estimates that about half of all zeros outstanding fall=
 into the junk category. And others are at risk of having their ratings dow=
ngraded before the put date. Today, with junk yielding as much as 5 1/2 per=
centage points above bonds rated investment grade, refinancing can be a pri=
cey proposition.=20
Contract manufacturer Solectron is one that could well get hit by the high =
price of junk. It has $845 million in zeros that it will probably have to b=
uy back this January, and another $4.2 billion coming down the pike over th=
e next couple of years. Because of slower- than-expected sales, the company=
 was recently put on negative credit watch by three rating agencies. And if=
 Solectron's credit is downgraded, the zeros would slide into junk status, =
a situation that could cost the company--and its shareholders--tens of mill=
ions of dollars in refinancing charges.=20
Refinancing isn't the only worrisome cost associated with these zeros. Comp=
anies pay hefty investment banking fees to sell their bonds--up to 3% of th=
e amount raised. If the debt is sold back, many will have spent millions fo=
r what essentially amounted to a one-year loan. "They're getting bad advice=
," claims one banker who didn't want to be named. "Look at the fee the bank=
er earned and look at the kind of financing risk the company got into."=20
As if those potential consequences were not scary enough, shareholders can =
also get whacked when the bonds are first issued. That's because some 40% a=
re bought by hedge funds, which short the company's stock (sell borrowed sh=
ares with the intention of buying them back at a lower price) at the same t=
ime that they buy the bonds. If the stock goes down, the shorts make money =
from their position. If it goes up, they profit by converting the bond to s=
tock. This hedging strategy almost always causes the stock to plummet, at l=
east for a while. Grocery chain Supervalu, for example, recently lost 10% o=
f its market cap the day it announced it was issuing $185 million in zeros.=
=20
Despite all the pitfalls, the love affair with such Pollyanna bonds continu=
es, thanks in large part to the slick tax and accounting loopholes they pro=
vide. In fact, the hit on earnings per share can be the lowest of any form =
of financing. Even better, thanks to a wrinkle in the tax code, companies c=
an rake in huge tax savings by deducting far more interest than they're act=
ually paying. All they have to do is agree to pay small amounts of interest=
 if certain conditions prevail. Verizon Communications, for instance, would=
 pay 0.25% annual interest on its $3 billion in zero bonds if its stock pri=
ce falls below 60% of the issue's conversion price. In the eyes of the IRS,=
 oddly, that clause enables the company to take a yearly interest deduction=
, for tax purposes, of 7.5%--the same rate it pays on its regular debt. (Wh=
y? Trust us, you don't want to know.) That adds up to an annual deduction o=
f more than $200 million, even if Verizon never shells out a dime in intere=
st. Not surprisingly, more than half of the zeros issued in 2001 contain si=
milar clauses. "It's an incredible deal for them," says Vadim Iosilevich, w=
ho runs a hedge fund at Alexandra Investment Management. "Not only are they=
 raising cheap money, they're also doing tax arbitrage."=20
So despite the enormous risks to shareholders, companies continue to issue =
zeros at a steady clip: According to ConvertBond.com, seven new issues, tot=
aling $3.5 billion, have been sold since Oct. 1 alone. "I think the power o=
f the tax advantage is going to keep them around," says CSFB's Seidel. Call=
 it greed or just blind optimism that the markets will recover quickly--it =
doesn't really matter. Either way, it's the shareholders who'll be left pay=
ing the bill.=20

Manager's Journal: What Enron Did Right
By Samuel Bodily and Robert Bruner

11/19/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A20
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

This is a rough era for American business icons. Subject to the vagaries of=
 age (Jack Welch), product failure (Ford/Firestone tires), competition (Luc=
ent, AT&T), technology (Hewlett-Packard and Compaq), and dot-bomb bubbles (=
CMGI), managers and their firms remind us that being an icon is risky busin=
ess. The latest example is Enron, whose fall from grace has resulted in a p=
roposed fire sale to Dynegy.=20
Once considered one of the country's most innovative companies, Enron becam=
e a pariah due to lack of transparency about its deals and the odor of conf=
licts of interest. The journalistic accounts of Enron's struggles drip with=
 schadenfreude, hinting that its innovations and achievements were all a mi=
rage.
We hold no brief regarding the legal or ethical issues under investigation.=
 We agree that more transparency about potential conflicts of interest is n=
eeded. High profitability does not justify breaking the law or ethical norm=
s. But no matter how the current issues resolve themselves or what fresh re=
velations emerge, Enron has created an enormous legacy of good ideas that h=
ave enduring value.=20
-- Deregulation and market competition. Enron envisioned gas and electric p=
ower industries in the U.S. where prices are set in an open market of biddi=
ng by customers, and where suppliers can freely choose to enter or exit. En=
ron was the leader in pioneering this business.=20
Market competition in energy is now the dominant model in the U.S., and is =
spreading to Europe, Latin America, and Asia. The winners have been consume=
rs, who have paid lower prices, and investors, who have seen competition fo=
rce the power suppliers to become much more efficient. The contrary experie=
nce of California, the poster child of those who would re-regulate the powe=
r industry, is an example of not enough deregulation.=20
-- Innovation and the "de-integration" of power contracts. Under the old re=
gulated model of delivering gas and electricity, customers were offered a o=
ne-size-fits-all contract. For many customers, this system was inflexible a=
nd inefficient, like telling a small gardener that you can only buy manure =
by the truckload. Enron pioneered contracts that could be tailored to the e=
xact needs of the customer.=20
To do this, Enron unbundled the classic power contract into its constituent=
 parts, starting with price and volume, location, time, etc., and offered c=
ustomers choices on each one. Again, consumers won. Enron's investors did t=
oo, because Enron earned the surplus typically reaped by inventors. Arguabl=
y, Enron is the embodiment of what economist Joseph Schumpeter called the "=
process of Creative Destruction." But creative destroyers are not necessari=
ly likable, pleasant folks, which may be part of Enron's problem today.=20
-- Minimization of transaction costs and frictions. Enron extended the logi=
c of de-integration to other industries. An integrated paper company, for i=
nstance, owns forests, mills, pulp factories, and paper plants in what amou=
nts to a very big bet that the paper company can run all those disparate ac=
tivities better than smaller, specialized firms. Enron argued that integrat=
ed firms and industries are riddled with inefficiencies stemming from burea=
ucracy and the captive nature of "customers" and "suppliers." Enron envisio=
ned creating free markets for components within the integrated chain on the=
 bet that the free-market terms would be better than those of the internal =
operations. The development of free-market benchmarks for the terms by whic=
h divisions of integrated firms do business with each other is very healthy=
 for the economy.=20
-- Exploiting the optionality in networks. In the old regulated environment=
, natural gas would be supplied to a customer through a single dedicated pi=
peline. Enron envisioned a network by which gas could be supplied from a nu=
mber of possible sources, opening the customer to the benefits of competiti=
on, and the supplier to the flexibility of alternative sourcing strategies.=
 Enron benefited from controlling switches on the network, so that they cou=
ld nimbly route the molecules or electrons from the best source at any mome=
nt in time to the best use, and choose when and where to convert molecules =
to electrons. This policy, picked up by others in the industry, created tre=
mendous value for both customers and suppliers.=20
-- Rigorous risk assessment. The strategy of tailored contracts could easil=
y have broken the firm in the absence of a clear understanding of the tradi=
ng risks that the firm assumed, and of very strong internal controls. Enron=
 pioneered risk assessment and control systems that we judge to be among th=
e best anywhere. Particularly with the advent of Enron Online, where Enron =
made new positions valued at over $4 billion each day, it became essential =
to have up-to-the-second information on company-wide positions, prices and =
ability to deliver.=20
The unexpected bad news from Enron has little to do with trading losses by =
the firm, but with fears among trading partners about Enron's ability to fi=
nance its trading activity. In a world where contracts and trading portfoli=
os are too complex to explain in a sound bite, counterparties look to a thi=
ck equity base for assurance. It was the erosion in equity, rather than tra=
ding risk, that destroyed the firm.=20
-- A culture of urgency, innovation and high expectations. Enron's corporat=
e culture was the biggest surprise of all. The Hollywood stereotype of a ut=
ility company is bureaucratic, hierarchical, formal, slow, and full of excu=
ses. And the stodgy images of a gas pipeline company -- Enron only 15 years=
 ago -- is even duller and slower. Enron became bumptious, impatient, lean,=
 fast, innovative, and demanding. It bred speed and innovation by giving it=
s professionals unusual freedom to start new businesses, create markets, an=
d transfer within the firm.=20
Success was rewarded with ample compensation and fast promotion, and an ope=
n-office design fostered brainstorming. The firm's organization and culture=
 was by all accounts not a safe haven for those who believe the role of a l=
arge corporation is to fulfill entitlements for jobs. This was a lightning =
rod for the firm's detractors. And yet, it could serve as a model for more =
hide-bound enterprises to emulate.=20
Enron was a prolific source of compelling new ideas about the transformatio=
n of American business. It created a ruckus in once-quiet corners of the bu=
siness economy. It rewrote the rules of competition in almost every area in=
 which it did business. It thrived on volatility.=20
The proposed sale of Enron to Dynegy risks the loss of a major R&D establis=
hment, especially given Dynegy's track record as a second mover following E=
nron's lead. Beyond what is likely to be a difficult and time-consuming ant=
itrust review, Dynegy's greater challenge will be to find a way to make Enr=
on's spirit of innovation its own. Or so we all should hope, because prospe=
rity depends on the ability of firms to reinvent themselves and remake thei=
r industries.=20

J.P. Morgan Wins (by Not Losing as Much)
By Susanne Craig
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

11/19/2001
The Wall Street Journal
C1
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

You know things are bad on Wall Street when the winner of a stock-selection=
 contest can't come close to breaking even.=20
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.'s portfolio was the only one in The Wall Street Jou=
rnal's quarterly stock-picking survey to slide less than 10% during the thr=
ee months ended Sept. 30. The value of its stock basket fell 8.6% during th=
e third quarter.
Just six of the 15 financial firms managed to beat the benchmark Standard &=
 Poor's 500-stock index, which dropped 14.7% during the period. Among the s=
tar performers that came to J.P. Morgan's rescue: Northrop Grumman Corp., S=
BC Communications Inc. and Procter & Gamble Co.=20
"It has turned into a real stock-picker's market," says J.P. Morgan equity =
strategist Douglas Cliggott. "In the first half, the market bought cyclical=
 stocks, such as credit cards and brokers, in hopes of a recovery. We don't=
 think those stocks will get interesting until sometime in 2003." Instead, =
the firm's portfolio is weighted toward health care and consumer staples, a=
s well as cyclical stocks such as energy and farm equipment.=20
The quarter was among the roughest in years for Wall Street investors. The =
terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 helped contribute to the stock-market losses,=
 which drove down the value of all portfolios in the survey, though the mar=
kets have since recovered to their pre-Sept. 11 levels. The last time the g=
roup posted results this bad was during the third quarter of 1998, during t=
he Asian financial crisis.=20
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Credit Suisse Group's Credit Suisse First Bost=
on finished at the bottom of the pack, falling 23.2% and 30.1% respectively=
. The performance of last-place finisher CSFB was dragged down by losses at=
 companies such as Veritas Software Corp. (down 72.3% in the quarter), Prae=
cis Pharmaceuticals Inc. (down 64.8%) and software provider Amdocs Ltd. (do=
wn 51%).=20
For CSFB, "it was not a good stock-picking quarter, that's for sure," says =
Al Jackson, the firm's global head of equity research. "It was our tech and=
 telecom . . . and the events of Sept. 11 that hurt us."=20
Credit Suisse First Boston recently changed the approach to its model portf=
olio, opting against sector weightings, Mr. Jackson says. This strategy has=
 hurt CSFB in recent quarters, because of the steep slump in areas such as =
technology and telecom. The firm recently added a number of Old Economy sto=
cks to its portfolio, such as Citigroup Inc., Dow Chemical Co. and Gannett =
Co. Says Mr. Jackson: "We are going back to our roots and asking what our b=
est ideas are."=20
Like CSFB, Goldman was hit by a drop in the share price of technology compa=
nies, such as Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (down 56.5% in the qua=
rter). Its portfolio was also dragged down by shares of embattled Enron Cor=
p. (down 44.3%). Morgan Stanley and Royal Bank of Canada's RBC Dain Rausche=
r, which placed 6th and 12th respectively, also have the energy company on =
their lists.=20
In addition to Enron, stocks hard it by the terrorist attacks, such as lodg=
ing giant Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc., Walt Disney Co. and air=
lines such as Skywest Inc., also hurt the portfolio performance of many sec=
urities firms.=20
It is unlikely people will buy any company's entire recommended list at one=
 time. The Journal survey is intended to give investors an idea of how thei=
r portfolio would look if they let the professionals do all the picking. Ca=
lculations in the quarterly survey, done for the Journal by Zacks Investmen=
t Research in Chicago, take into account capital gains or losses, dividends=
 and theoretical commissions of 1% on each trade.=20
Overall, Edward D. Jones & Co., of St. Louis, emerged with the most consist=
ent results across the board, placing second in the quarter and for the yea=
r. Its 85% return over five years is the best of the group and ahead of the=
 total return for the S&P 500 of 62.7%. Perhaps more than any other firm, E=
dwards Jones takes a buy-and-hold approach to investing, making very few ch=
anges to its portfolio from quarter to quarter, or even year to year.=20
"It's the old story of the tortoise and the hare, and we believe slow and s=
teady wins the race," says David Otto, Edward Jones director of research. "=
We are really, really proud of the five-year number. We believe in getting =
rich, slowly."=20
On a quarterly basis, the portfolio of Prudential Securities Inc., a unit o=
f Prudential Financial, came in second only to J.P. Morgan, falling 11.8%. =
However, investors sitting with the stocks Prudential recommends haven't do=
ne as well in the long run. The value of its basket of stocks has fallen 45=
.9% in the past year, finishing ahead of only Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.=
, which posted a one-year loss of 54.9%.=20
Seven firms managed to beat the S&P 500 index during the past 12 months, wh=
ich fell 26.6% in the period.=20
Lehman, which finished last in the survey in the second quarter thanks to i=
ts heavy weighting in technology, managed to move up in the rankings this q=
uarter. This primarily stemmed from its annual shuffle of the 10 stocks in =
its portfolio, known as its "Ten Uncommon Values." This time around, the fi=
rm's portfolio slipped 18.4% in the quarter, for an 11th place finish. Just=
 one of its 10 stocks, Washington Mutual Inc., managed to eke out a positiv=
e return, of 3.1%. Its biggest quarterly loser: Energy company Mirant Corp.=
, which fell 36.3% in the period.=20
"It's a portfolio that has done decently since the market troughed," says J=
eff Applegate, Lehman's chief market strategist. He says he believes the ma=
rket hit bottom Sept. 21.=20

German Bank Is in Talks With Enron To Buy a Unit
By SUZANNE KAPNER

LONDON, Nov. 18 -- A large German bank is in talks to buy Wessex Water from=
 the Enron Corporation, people close to the discussions said today.=20
Enron is looking to sell Wessex Water, of Britain, as well as other noncore=
 assets in India and Brazil, after a financial crisis nearly brought its ma=
in energy trading business to a halt. That crisis led to Enron's decision e=
arlier this month to be acquired by Dynegy Inc., a much smaller rival.
The German Bank, Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale of Dusseldorf, or Wes=
tLB, is among several suitors for Wessex Water, people close to the discuss=
ions said. The sale has also attracted the attention of industry rivals lik=
e Thames Water, owned by RWE of Germany. But such a combination would most =
likely incur a long review by regulators, who might either block the merger=
 on antitrust grounds, or exact stiff concessions, industry experts said.=
=20
Wessex Water is likely to be sold for more than $:1 billion ($1.4 billion) =
but less than the $:1.4 billion that Enron paid for it in 1998, analysts sa=
id.=20
''In hindsight, we made some very bad investments in noncore businesses,'' =
Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, told analysts in a co=
nference call last week. Those investments ''have performed far worse than =
we ever could have imagined,'' he said, citing the Azurix water business, o=
f which Wessex Water is a part, and energy assets in Brazil and India.=20
Executives from Enron were not immediately available for comment today. Wes=
tLB executives declined to comment.=20
WestLB has been aggressively pursuing acquisitions in Britain, bidding for =
British Telecommunications' phone network and the nation's railway tracks c=
ontrolled by the troubled Railtrack, which is restructuring under governmen=
t supervision. Neither of those bids has progressed beyond the initial stag=
es.=20
Last summer, WestLB helped finance the management buyout of the Mid Kent Wa=
ter Company through Swan Capital, its private equity vehicle.

Credit Markets
Bond Boom Isn't Likely to Lift Economy As Corporations Swap Old Debt for Ne=

When AT&T last week completed the second-biggest bond sale in history -- ca=
pping one of the busiest bond periods in years -- it came as welcome news a=
mid fears of a credit crunch. Here was new money, meaning new spending on p=
lants, equipment and jobs that could help pull the economy out of its slump=
.=20
That $10.9 billion AT&T deal, and a slew of similar bond deals from big com=
panies ranging from Boeing and Anheuser-Busch to Kraft Foods and General Mo=
tors, may not provide as big of a boost as economists are banking on. That =
is because corporations, like homeowners, are in the midst of a refinancing=
 boom.
Corporations are hitting the market not just because rates are cheap, but b=
ecause they often can't get money in other crucial markets. In particular, =
they are sidestepping the commercial paper market -- short-term corporate I=
OUs used to finance day-to-day operations, where rates traditionally are lo=
west -- because investors are unwilling to finance many well-known corporat=
ions.=20
The result has been a huge jump in bond sales, the majority of which are us=
ed to reduce existing debt. Since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, about $13=
5 billion in investment-grade bonds have been sold, up from about $78 billi=
on in the year-earlier period. Overall issuance this year is likely to set =
a record, clearing $600 billion, compared with $411 billion in 2000.=20
"The driving force behind this surge in bond issuance is refinancing short-=
term commercial paper to long-term debt," says John Lonski, chief economist=
 at Moody's Investors Service, a credit-rating agency.=20
Usually, rising bond issuance presages economic growth. In 1991, corporatio=
ns sold a record number of bonds to exploit falling interest rates. But the=
n, companies poured much of the money they raised back into their operation=
s, a flurry of investment that foreshadowed the economic boom of the late 1=
990s.=20
This time around, the surge in bond deals won't pump in enough new money to=
 the economy to make a dramatic difference. Though, as in the case of the m=
illions of homeowners who are refinancing their mortgages to lower monthly =
payments, it could help ease some pressure on stretched corporate-balance s=
heets and help to fund some of the companies' day-to-day operations.=20
Not all of the money being raised is to refinance short-term debt, of cours=
e, and the string of bond deals shows that many of the nation's biggest bor=
rowers have ready access to funding if they need it.=20
But most companies are similar to AT&T, which last week provided the bigges=
t refinancing example yet.=20
Over the next three months, the telecom company was facing $6.5 billion in =
expiring commercial paper. Under normal conditions, corporations pay off ma=
turing commercial paper by "rolling over" that debt, or issuing new commerc=
ial paper to replace the old. But rolling over commercial paper became much=
 harder for AT&T after Moody's cut the company's short-term and long-term c=
redit ratings. Through the bond deal, AT&T raised money at relatively attra=
ctive rates while avoiding the difficulties of the commercial-paper market.=
=20
Other companies facing downgrades also are scrambling to find alternatives =
to the commercial-paper market through bonds, loans or revolving credit lin=
es. "The ripple effects of this are being felt throughout the capital marke=
ts," says Meredith Coffey, senior vice president at Loan Pricing Corp., a d=
ebt-market-analysis company.=20
For the most extreme cases, the bond markets don't offer refuge. Enron, ham=
mered by a third-quarter loss of $618 million that led to a string of downg=
rades, drew down $3.3 billion from its emergency bank credit line to repay =
investors in its commercial paper. It then turned to its banks for an addit=
ional $1 billion loan to pay off more commercial-paper investors, thus tidi=
ng it over until it could merge with rival Dynegy.=20
Most investment-grade companies aren't nearly so bad off, and thus have rea=
dy access to bond investors. General Motors, for instance, had little troub=
le selling $6 billion in debt last month, while Ford Motor easily sold bond=
s totalling $9.4 billion.=20
But the surge in bond sales masks signs that even investment-grade companie=
s are having trouble convincing investors that they are good for their mone=
y.=20
Take Ford. Standard & Poor's and Moody's downgraded Ford's debt ratings las=
t month to triple-B-plus and single-A-3, respectively. With that rating, Fo=
rd is far enough down the spectrum of investment-grade debt that many of th=
e ultraconservative investors in commercial paper won't touch it, meaning t=
hat it had to turn to corporate bonds to refinance its debt. Ford concedes =
that a big reason it is selling bonds was to avoid the trouble in the comme=
rcial-paper market.=20
Boyce Greer, the money-market group leader at Fidelity Investments, says he=
 often stops buying the commercial paper of a corporation at the first sign=
 of eroding profitability -- even before they get downgraded. "You can't wa=
it around for a rating agency [to downgrade a company]," he says.=20
Moody's has downgraded five times as many corporations as it has raised so =
far this year. Thus, the market for corporate commercial paper has shrunk t=
o $1.4 trillion at the end of October, down from $1.6 trillion at the end o=
f last year.=20
---=20
Friday's Credit Markets=20
Last week was a brutal time to own Treasurys. The market sold off so sharpl=
y as to push yields, which move inversely to prices, almost back up to wher=
e they stood before the terrorist attacks. It was the worst bond selloff si=
nce 1987, according to economists at Banc One Capital Markets.=20
Losses were heaviest in issues like the two-year note, the most sensitive t=
o expectations about Federal Reserve policy. Since hitting a record low of =
2.30% on Nov. 7, the two-year yield has risen 0.80 percentage point to 3.05=
%. In the same period, the 30-year bond yield has risen 0.50 percentage poi=
nt to 5.27%.=20
At 4 p.m. Friday, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was down 1 3/32 point=
s from late Thursday, or $10.94 per $1,000 face value, at 100 25/32. Its yi=
eld jumped to 4.897% from 4.756% Thursday.=20
The 30-year Treasury bond's price fell 1 19/32 to 100 25/32 to yield 5.317,=
 up from 5.211% Thursday.=20
Why the selloff? People in the market cite a shift toward the view that the=
 U.S. economy may finally be on the brink of recovery. That means the Fed m=
ay not need to employ many more rate cuts to get growth back on track.=20

Enron Corp. investors hope the energy trader's third-quarter report to the =
Securities and Exchange Commission will answer some of the questions that s=
ent its shares tumbling and led to a proposed sale to rival Dynegy Inc.=20
Enron, which has been criticized for failing to clearly explain how it make=

y the company and affiliated partnerships, as well as any planned job cuts =
and other cost-saving moves related to Dynegy's $24-billion buyout.
Enron agreed to sell after its stock plunged 67% in three weeks amid an SEC=
 investigation into partnerships run by Enron executives. Investors worry t=
hat new disclosures, such as previously unreported debt, might threaten Enr=
on's credit rating and scuttle the merger, possibly pushing Enron into bank=
ruptcy.=20
Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay acknowledged last week that failed investments a=

Enron shares fell 48 cents Friday to close at $9 on the New York Stock Exch=

Enron reduced net income for four years by a combined $586 million to inclu=

COMPANIES & FINANCE INTERNATIONAL - Dynegy bid faces long wait.
By NANCY DUNNE and ANDREW HILL.

11/19/2001

(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved

Dynegy's $9.8bn rescue bid for Enron, the larger rival energy group, poses =
complex and unprecedented regulatory challenges for the Federal Energy Regu=
latory Commission (Ferc), which is likely to lead the review of the bid.=20
Officials from the two Houston-based companies, which announced the deal 10=
 days ago, estimated the regulatory process would take six to nine months t=
o complete.
But the Ferc review could take longer, according to experts, and approval o=
f the deal is further complicated by such issues as the parallel Securities=
 and Exchange Commission investigation into Enron's finances.=20
"It's very complicated. It will be very time-consuming," said one person cl=
ose to the Ferc commissioners. As of Friday, the groups had not yet filed f=
or Ferc approval.=20
"(The deal) raises issues that have never been considered before by Ferc," =
said Edward Comer, general counsel to the Edison Electric Institute, the as=
sociation of US electric utilities.=20
"It has never considered the merger of two huge marketers, and in the past,=
 marketing wasn't considered as significant a portion of the energy sector =
as it has become."=20
A typical deal now takes about 200 days to win Ferc approval. But Mr Comer =
said approval of the Dynegy bid could take anywhere from six months to two =
years.=20
The agency's guidelines prohibit mergers if they give the new company the m=
arket power to push prices above competitive levels for "a significant peri=
od of time".=20
It analyses market power by identifying the products sold, the customers an=
d suppliers affected and market concentration.=20
"Mergers in the past have been considered on the basis of assets," said Pat=
ti Harper-Slaboszewicz of Frost & Sullivan, a market research and consultin=
g firm. "The rules were written when the industry was vertically integrated=
."=20
Now the question is how ownership of energy trading services will be calcul=
ated. It could be difficult to assess if the companies are exerting market =
power because information on the trading books of companies such as Enron a=
nd Dynegy is closely guarded, she said.=20
The two companies must also win consent from either the Justice Department =
or the Federal Trade Commission, and from states where the companies have p=
ipelines and provide retail services.=20

Fund Track
Russia Fund Surges Amid Global Woes
By Victoria Marcinkowski
Dow Jones Newswires

C17

Everything is relative in the investing world, so with U.S. investors nervo=
us about homeland stocks, European and Asian markets sagging and terrorism =
worries abounding, Russia's risky markets seem less so these days.=20
So far this year, Pilgrim Russia Fund, which was bought by ING Groep NV lat=
e last year, has been the top-performing regional mutual fund, gaining 53%,=
 according to fund tracker Morningstar Inc. By comparison, the Standard & P=
oor's 500-stock index has slumped nearly 14%.
Of course, the risks in Russia remain. Despite recent economic gains, the c=
ountry still is struggling with a weak banking system, inadequate state ins=
titutions to enforce contract laws and few businesses run by the "modern" r=
ules of corporate governance, according to Samuel Oubadia the 37-year-old m=
anager of the Russia fund.=20
"But they are getting more open," Mr. Oubadia said, though Russia's lax fin=
ancial reporting standards are still one of the main roadblocks for foreign=
 investors. With $49 million in assets, the Pilgrim Russia fund invests bet=
ween 90% and 95% in Russian stock, with the balance held in cash.=20
"While the global economy is slowing, Russia is still in an expansion mode,=
" Mr. Oubadia said. After years of economic reforms, consumer spending is u=
p 10% and the former Soviet Union's gross domestic product is expected to g=
row 3% to 5% next year, more than twice as much as that of the U.S. and Eur=
ope.=20
Two-thirds of the fund's stocks are oil and gas companies, which are still =
the most liquid stocks in Russia. Utilities, mining, telecommunications com=
panies and breweries make up the rest. "There's no escaping oil and gas if =
you want to manage a Russia fund," Mr. Oubadia said.=20
The spike in oil prices earlier this year made the investment in oil worthw=
hile, propelling earnings growth for Russia's oil and gas companies. Higher=
 oil prices also worked wonders for the Russian economy, which is largely d=
ependent on oil and gas. More recently, however, falling oil prices have th=
reatened the companies' profit growth.=20
But the fund manager, who is based in The Hague, said he doesn't think peop=
le should invest in Russian oil stocks because of their earnings prospects.=
 "You don't invest because of earnings growth -- there will be none for Rus=
sian oil companies this year. You invest because of the stocks' low valuati=
on," Mr. Oubadia said, adding that most of the Russian oil companies still =
trade well below the world-wide average for the sector.=20
Yukos Oil is one of the fund's largest investments, making up about 12% of =
the fund's holdings. Surgutneftegaz and Lukoil Holdings also make up more t=
han 5% each of Pilgrim Russia's assets. While Mr. Oubadia said the companie=
s should be able to handle falling oil prices, partly by cutting production=
, he worries that further price erosion could hamper a fragile Russian stoc=
k market that relies so heavily on oil and gas stocks.=20
"Can Russian markets do well with lower prices for oil?" he asked. "The sho=
rt answer is yes. But how low will prices drop?" Mr. Oubadia acknowledged t=
hat weak oil prices might cause him to shift some investments from oil and =
gas into other Russian sectors, including telecom stocks and consumer produ=
cts.=20
The Russia fund isn't for the timid. In 1998, when the Russian economy coll=
apsed, the fund -- then called Lexington Troika Dialog Russia, lost 83% of =
its value. A year later, the fund soared 160%. In 2000 the fund finished do=
wn almost 18%.=20
---=20
JANUS STOCK SHUFFLE: Janus Capital Corp. bulked up on lower-priced value st=
ocks and shed some shares of its long-held technology companies during the =
third quarter, a new Securities and Exchange Commission filing showed.=20
The Denver fund firm reported that during the third quarter, it lowered its=
 investments in 14 of the 20 largest holdings it had owned as of June 30. T=
he largest reduction was a 43.6 million-share sale of Nokia Corp. stock. Af=
ter the sale, Janus still owned a large 183.2 million-share position in the=
 wireless-phone company at the end of the third quarter.=20
During the quarter, Janus also sold more than half of its stakes in tech co=
mpanies EMC Corp. and Sun Microsystems Inc. In addition, the fund company, =
a unit of Stilwell Financial Inc., trimmed its exposure to energy company E=
nron Corp., selling 1.5 million shares to reduce its overall position to 41=
.4 million shares at the end of September.=20
On the buying side, Janus, one of the hottest fund firms of the late 1990s =
thanks to bets on leading technology stocks, about doubled its position in =
software company Microsoft Corp. It also boosted its holding in the investm=
ent company run by Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., while starting =
a small position in Philip Morris Cos., whose dividend-rich stock is usuall=
y more popular with price-sensitive "value" managers. Janus has introduced =
new value portfolios recently, but most of its investors' assets still foll=
ow faster-growing companies.=20

Enron, the energy trading group which bought Wessex in 1998 for AGBP1.4bn, =
is being bought by its much smaller US rival Dynegy after collapsing into f=

Three years ago, Enron spent AGBP1.4bn on Wessex Water.=20
But Dynegy is understood to want to concentrate on US and European energy a=

Any hope to regain the same amount of money could be derailed as the indust=

NEW YORK - Companies that trade with Enron Corp., the Houston, Texas-based =
energy group, are taking precautions in case Dynegy Inc., also of Houston, =
withdraws its $15.6-billion rescue bid for its rival, a decision that could=
 trigger a crisis in the energy trading market.=20
Counter-parties to Enron, which is one of the principal market-makers provi=
ding liquidity in the energy market, are seeking to limit their exposure to=
 the group, in spite of reassurances from both Enron and Dynegy that the ta=
keover will go through.
Experts also say the implications of the deal are so complex that the regul=
atory review could take much longer than the six to nine months company off=
icials have estimated.=20
Analysts say the 27% spread between the value of Dynegy's offer price and E=
nron's share price suggests a 65% to 75% chance the bid will succeed. But b=
ankers and energy executives are still worried about systemic risk, both in=
 the energy market and in financial markets, where companies such as Enron =
use derivatives to offset the risk of energy price fluctuations.=20
Enron was close to meltdown until Dynegy stepped in with a rescue bid 10 da=
ys ago, having persuaded credit rating agencies not to downgrade Enron's de=
bt to below investment grade.=20
Clauses built into the merger agreement signed with Enron give Dynegy the r=
ight to walk away under certain circumstances, although the two companies' =
officials and advisors differ on how easy it would be for Dynegy to pull ou=
t.=20
While the situation remains uncertain, companies that deal with Enron are r=

Blackout in the power sector
A V Rajwade

Business Standard

Copyright (c) Business Standard

Every foreign company in the Indian power sector wants to exit. Of these, t=
he most controversial has been Enron and its Dabhol Power Company Ltd (DPCL=
). This apart, the experience of investors in the "reformed" power sector i=
n Orissa is also unhappy. Five years ago, Orissa was the first state to ado=
pt the World Bank-recommended model of separating generation, transmission =
and distribution of power, and an independent regulator. The Godbole Commit=
tee has recently recommended the same for Maharashtra as well.=20
Clearly, separating the three functions is a complex restructuring. Maybe i=
t helps privatisation, the current fashion on the subject having been set i=
n Thatcherite Britain. While some privatisations in UK have succeeded, the =
experience has not been consistent all over.
Take UK's rail sector. While privatising, the government in its wisdom deci=
ded to separate the ownership of the rail network (Railtrack) and the owner=
ship and operation of trains. The contractual relationship between the vari=
ous operating companies and Railtrack were governed by a byzantine, bewilde=
ringly complex system of penalties and incentives, to be monitored by an in=
dependent regulator.=20
Such separation had no parallel. Besides, Railtrack suffered from poor mana=
gement, cost escalation in modernisation of tracks, etc. Several serious ac=
cidents occurred and fixing responsibility became difficult. The "reform" d=
id not work, and Railtrack was put back under public control last month.=20
What are the chances of trifurcation of the power sector in India succeedin=
g? Pretty poor, if the experience of Orissa is any guide. It faithfully sep=
arated the three functions, and privatised distribution and part of generat=
ion. AES, a foreign company, was 49 per cent investor in a generating compa=
ny, and 51 per cent in CESCO, a distribution company. As Gajendra Haldea an=
alysed in this paper on August 27, "The policy and regulatory framework was=
 inadequate and myopic."=20
Distribution losses, a euphemism for power theft, were much larger than the=
 companies had been led to believe at the time of privatisation. CESCO defa=
ulted in paying the dues of GRIDCO, the transmission company, which in turn=
 defaulted to the generating company. Indeed, all CESCO's cash inflows are =
now escrowed, leaving it no money even to pay salaries. For all practical p=
urposes, the distribution companies seem to be in a difficult situation, pe=
rhaps beyond redemption, and the "reform" is a total mess.=20
The crux of the problem in the power sector is not whether a unified SEB is=
 less efficient than trifurcated companies it is the political unwillingnes=
s to charge a price which covers the cost to all consumers. For a while, cr=
oss subsidisation worked with commercial consumers subsidising the househol=
d and the agricultural segments.=20
However, as the burden became too large, the commercial sector started movi=
ng to captive generation, further worsening SEB finances. An "independent" =
regulator for power tariffs may not solve the problem. He may fix economic =
prices but will the state come forward to protect the bill collectors, puni=
sh power thiefs, face social unrest if power to recalcitrant consumers is c=
ut off? So long as the answers to these questions are in the negative, as, =
sadly, they are, the institutional restructuring is no substitute for subst=
antive action. No wonder all foreign investors in the power sector want to =
get out!=20
Enron too wants out but it has many more problems in its home country, over=
 and above its dispute with MSEB. It had attracted a lot of adverse publici=
ty for gouging power consumers in California, a state in a power crisis (se=
e World Money, February 2, 2001). The Internet craze also had a hand in Enr=
on's misfortunes. It became an energy trader, established an electronic tra=
ding platform, had broadband ambitions, went into a disastrous diversificat=
ion in water supplies which, if I remember correctly, led to Rebecca Mark's=
 exit. Perhaps it went into too many areas too quickly under Jeffery Skilli=
ng, ex-McKinsey, and was notorious for opaque, complex accounts.=20
To top it all, last month it announced that it will take an extraordinary $=
1.2 billion charge in its third quarter results for losses in financial act=
ivities. Enron's chief financial officer, who was supposed to be in charge =
of these, has resigned amidst reports that a private equity fund associated=
 with him was involved in them. The SEC is investigating the affair and Enr=
on's share price is down 67 per cent since mid-October. There are some repo=
rts that Shell may make a bid for Enron.=20
After its ratings were downgraded, Enron is desperate for liquidity and anx=
ious to dispose its assets. DPCL was already on the platter; now a sale has=
 become even more urgent. Reportedly, Tatas and BSES are interested; so are=
 the lending institutions. Clearly, if a settlement is to be reached, this =
is the optimum time.=20
But one is not very optimistic. For one, Delhi and Mumbai will be involved,=
 and bureaucracies never understand opportunity costs. Our byzantine decisi=
on-making processes make timely decisions impossible. Further, if a deal do=
es take place, there will be the inevitable allegations of corruption. It i=
s much safer for the reputation of the concerned ministers in Mumbai and De=
lhi to allow the drift to continue, to "let the law take its own course", w=
hatever the costs! Sadly, as Jairam Ramesh said in this paper, Indian polit=
icians respond to developments only out of compulsion, not conviction.

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Tom, want me to start ordering lunches just for our group?  I could even take specific orders for what each person likes, and have them bill us or put it on someone's credit card.  I can do that for just the EOL guys, too.  I found out that the deliveries are going to ECN, and the clerks are picking them up from there.  Well, at lunchtime, I could take a dollie with me to carry it all, and/or have Michael Salinas help me.  I don't know ... whatever you'd like.  That's just a suggestion that I have, if you would still like to pull away from the daily lunches for the whole floor.  I've noticed a lot of our guys don't like the lunches, and they sometimes go get food from the Energizer.  We still get billed for their food, even if they don't eat.  

Let me know if you'd still like to do this, because it's definitely possible.

Laura

P.S. - I just thought of another suggestion ... I could make Peanut Butter & Jelly sandwiches for us!!!!  YEAH!

Deskheads:

After this week I was going to discontinue lunches other than bidweek for everyone except EOL traders.  There are too many people going downstairs to get their lunch and your cost center is being charged daily whether people eat or not.  I have had a couple of you approach me that you still would like for your groups to be included in daily lunches.  Please email me by tommorrow and let me know if you would like to continue.   For those that do not, I will notify your groups that this Wednesday will be the last day for their groups to eat.

Thank you,

to

Fraud

lots

> HERE'S HOW IT WORKS:
> You will  receive a message on your answering machine or your pager,
which

you're
> asked to call varies. It can be to receive  information about a family

to
> let you know you have won a  wonderful prize, etc. In each case, you
are
> told to call the 809  number right away. Since there are so many new
area
> codes these  days, people unknowingly return these calls. If you call
from
> the  US, you will apparently be charged $2425 per-minute. Or, you'll
get
> long recorded message. The point is, they will try to keep you on  the
> phone as long as possible to increase the charges. Unfortunately,  when
you
> get your phone bill, you'll often be charged more than  $24100.00.
> WHY IT WORKS:
> The 809 area code is located in the  British Virgin Islands (The
Bahamas).
> The 809 area code can be used  as a "pay-per-call" number, similar to
900
> numbers in the US. Since  809 is not in the US, it is not covered by
U.S.
> regulations of 900  numbers, which require that you be notified and
warned
> of charges  and rates involved when you call a pay-per-call" number.
There
> is  also no requirement that the company provide a time period  during
which
> you may terminate the call without being charged.  Further, whereas
many
> U.S.  homes that have 900 number  blocking to avoid these kinds of
charges,
> do not work in preventing  calls to the 809 area code. We recommend
that no
> matter how you get  The message, if you are asked to call a number with
an
> 809 area  code that you don't recognize just disregard the message. Be
wary
>  of email or calls asking you to call an 809 area code number. It's
>  important to prevent becoming a victim of this scam, since trying  to
fight

Lyne,
We will NOT be going to this one as we have a girl scout function at Camp
Misty Meadows-Hugs and Kisses, the girls work with the horses.  I haven't
told Krista about this conflict.
You can use our 3 tickets at the SEC Club price and order additional at the
guest price.  Please let me know, so I can turn it in ASAP for the better
seats.

USA: Enron worker warned execs on accounting - lawmakers.

WASHINGTON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - An Enron Corp. employee warned the energy giant's top executive in August 2001 about potential problems with how it accounted for certain transactions, Congressional investigators said on Monday. 
The unidentified employee wrote Enron Chief Executive Kenneth Lay raising several areas of concern, including ownership interests in certain partnerships, how accountant Andersen treated partnerships on Enron's books and the potential impact on Enron's financial statements, Reps. Billy Tauzin and James Greenwood said.
The employee described a "veil of secrecy" around some of the partnerships in question, the lawmakers said in letters to Enron and its auditor Andersen seeking more information. 
On Oct. 16, Enron reported its first quarterly loss in over four years, taking a $1.2 billion charge against shareholder equity relating to dealing with partnerships run by then Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow.

NEW YORK, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Attorneys for Enron Corp. , the bankrupt energy company, said on Monday they will delay the release of details about Enron's trading unit sale to UBS AG until 11 p.m. EST. 
Enron on Friday said it would sell a controlling stake in its key energy trading unit to UBS Warburg, the investment banking unit of Switzerland's largest bank. It said at the time it would release details of the sale at 2 p.m. EST on Monday.
Attorneys for Weil Gotshal and Manges didn't disclose reasons for the delay, which Enron said would be posted on its Web site, www.enron.com, and on the Web site of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, which is adjudicating Enron's bankruptcy case.

Enron Gets No Cash Upfront In Deal With UBS Warburg
By Kathy Chu and Carol S. Remond

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Although the deal between Enron Corp. (ENE) and UBS Warburg (U.UBS) has yet to be finalized, details are beginning to emerge.
Under a plan to revive Enron's energy-trading operations, UBS will acquire 100% ownership of the bankrupt company's core business. Meanwhile, Enron and its creditors will get 33% of the new business' pretax profits for at least two years, people familiar with the matter said. 
Enron will get no cash upfront. 
"We got the best that the best people could get," Enron lawyer Martin Bienenstock said Friday at a court hearing in which the deal was announced. 
Under the proposed 10-year plan, UBS will have the option to reduce and eventually to eliminate payouts to Enron after two years. 
UBS may get an option to reduce profit-royalty payments to Enron to 22% in the third year, 11% the year after that, and eventually down to nothing, according to people familiar with the deal. 
But if the Swiss financial institution doesn't exercise its options by the end of the fifth year, Enron may get an incremental increase in the energy-trading operation's profits - up to 45% by the end of the agreement. 
Also under the agreement, UBS is expected to pay rent on Enron's Houston office space and to hire most of the company's energy-trading employees. Jeffrey McMahon, Enron's chief financial officer, has said that the unit employs between 400 and 1,000 workers, including traders and marketing staff.

USA: Lawmaker sees insider trading "evidence" at Enron.

01/14/2002

(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

WASHINGTON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - The ranking Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee said on Monday there was "pretty strong evidence" of insider trading as well as false accounting in the fall of the energy-trading giant Enron Corp. 
Rep. John Dingell of Michigan, whose committee is one of those investigating Enron , spoke on CBS television's "The Early Show."
"There's pretty strong evidence of insider trading," at Enron, Dingell said, adding that there was "clear evidence of failure to file honest and correct annual reports" required by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
"There may be a number of other things here which were going on, including possible insider trading and possible misuse of insider accounts," the lawmaker continued. 
"False accounting appears to be a very major problem, and it appears that both Enron and the accounting firm were involved in this matter." 
Andersen, Enron's accounting firm, has admitted that it destroyed a number of Enron documents. 
Spokesmen for Enron and Andersen could not immediately be reached for comment. 
Thousands of employees lost their pensions and life savings in the downfall of Enron last year after the company acknowledged several hundred million dollars of previously undisclosed liabilities. The company filed for bankruptcy on Dec 2. 
Some Enron shareholders have filed a lawsuit accusing a group of 29 Enron executives and directors of "unlawful insider trading" and misleading the investing public. 
Several congressional committees are investigating Enron's demise, and some lawmakers on those committees have said they want to probe whether Enron employees and shareholders were deceived. The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission are also investigating. 
Rep. Henry Waxman, a California Democrat, wrote to Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay over the weekend to ask him to explain why he sent out optimistic e-mails to Enron employees in August about the company's prospects. 
Dingell is one of 188 House members who received campaign contributions from Enron. The donations to Dingell's campaign totaled $9,000 since 1989, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a watchdog group.

USA: Senate banking committee says sets hearing on Enron.

01/14/2002

(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

WASHINGTON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - The powerful Senate Banking Committee said on Monday it will hold a Feb. 12 hearing on Enron Corp., the energy trading giant whose bankruptcy filing last year threw thousands out of work, devastated investors and raised questions about its accounting practices. 
Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee Chairman Paul Sarbanes, a Maryland Democrat, said the hearing will focus on "accounting and investor protection issues surrounding the problems with Enron Corporation and other public companies."
The Houston, Texas-based company, once ranked No. 7 on the Fortune 500 list of large corporations, is being probed by five other congressional committees, the market-regulating Securities and Exchange Commission and the Labor Department. The Justice Department has launched a criminal probe of Enron. 
The committee said Sarbanes has invited five former chairmen of the Securities and Exchange Commission to testify. 
The following former chairmen of the SEC have been invited to testify: Roderick Hills (1975-77); Harold Williams (1977-81); David Ruder (1987-89); Richard Breeden (1989-93); and Arthur Levitt (1993-2000), the committee said. 
Once the world's largest energy trader, Enron slid in mere weeks late last year from Wall Street stardom to making the largest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history on Dec. 2. Its downfall threw thousands out of work and devastated investors. 
The episode sapped the life savings of many Enron employees whose 401(k) plans were heavily invested in Enron stock, while top executives allegedly pocketed fat profits by selling ahead of a dizzying plunge in the share price.

USA: Former Enron CEO Skilling shorted competitor's stock.

01/14/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

NEW YORK, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Jeffrey Skilling, the former chief executive of Enron Corp. , sold short AES Corp.'s stock last summer in a bet that the competing power company's share price would fall, his spokeswoman said on Monday. 
Skilling's spokeswoman said he decided to short the stock after reading a newspaper article that reported AES would be hurt by Brazil's weakening currency. AES, based in Arlington, Virginia, has a significant power business in Brazil.
"He was well aware of what a challenging environment Brazil was for companies at that time," said spokeswoman Judy Leon. 
Skilling, however, did not trade on any inside information he may have received during his job as CEO of Enron, his spokeswoman said. She declined to discuss specifics of the trade, including how much money was involved. 
"We're not commenting on his personal finances," Leon said. 
The trade was initiated on Aug. 24, or about 10 days after Skilling resigned as Enron's president and CEO, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the short sale. 
The Wall Street Journal said the trade could have made Skilling a profit of more than $15 million, depending when he closed out the trade, since shares of AES fell steadily in the weeks after he shorted the stock. Indeed, on Sept. 26 shares of AES dropped almost 50 percent after it warned it would fall well short of 2001 earnings estimates. 
Shares of other energy companies also fell during the period. 
Skilling - who along with other past and present Enron executives is facing shareholder lawsuits because of the company's collapse - has denied any wrongdoing in Enron's spiral into bankruptcy. 
Skilling joined Enron in 1990 after leaving McKinsey & Co.'s energy czz Co.'s energy czz.

Source: Buyer of Enron's power trading division to share profits with Enron and creditors
By ALAN CLENDENNING

NEW YORK (AP) - The Swiss investment bank that is buying Enron Corp.'s power trading business will share a third of its profits with Enron and its creditors, a source familiar with the situation said Monday. 
The plan, being presented in bankruptcy court, also calls for UBS Warburg to purchase the unit without paying any cash up front, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The terms were expected to be made public Monday afternoon in U.S. Bankruptcy Court. 
Representatives of UBS Warburg and Enron didn't immediately return telephone calls seeking comment Monday. 
Enron and its creditors will get 33 percent of the new business' pretax profits for at least two years, the source said. Stamford, Conn.-based UBS Warburg, a division of Switzerland's UBS AG, will have the option of buying one-third of Enron's stake after three years, and to buy the rest of its stake in subsequent years. 
Enron collapsed late last year amid revelations of complex partnerships used to keep billions of dollars in debt off its books and mask financial problems so it could continue to get cash and credit to run the trading business. 
UBS Warburg won the bidding Friday for the trading operation, beating out rival suitor Citigroup Inc., a large Enron creditor. The deal must be approved by Bankruptcy Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez; a hearing is set for Friday. 
Enron's energy trading business generated about 90 percent of the company's $101 billion in revenue in 2000. The deal does not include existing contracts Enron has to supply power, valued at between $6 billion and $7 billion. 
Trading of Enron shares, which sold for $83 a year ago but have changed hands at no higher than $1 since December, were halted Friday and Monday on the New York Stock Exchange for the sale announcement. UBS' U.S.-traded shares fell 44 cents to $49.51 Monday morning on the NYSE. 
Before its collapse late last year, Enron was the world's largest energy merchant and the nation's seventh-largest company by revenue. Enron differed from competitors in its penchant for complex bets on everything under the sun - advertising space, broadband, the weather, paper and more than 1,000 other products.

At Enron, Ignorance Was Bliss 
Dan Ackman, Forbes.com, 01.14.02, 8:50 AM ET 

NEW YORK - What did he know and when did he know it? 

This is the question famously asked about President Nixon and Watergate. It will now be asked about Enron. It is being asked about President George W. Bush. But it will also be asked more pointedly, for now, about Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay; its briefly serving chief executive, Jeffrey Skilling; and their top executives. 
Over the weekend, Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Donald Evans said they had not told the president about calls from Lay that alerted them to Enron's impending doom. They also said they had done nothing to bail out the ailing energy trader after its president, Greg Whalley, had asked a senior Treasury official to help arrange bank loans in late October and early November. 
O'Neill said took he two calls--one at his home on Sunday, Oct. 28, the other at his office on Nov. 8 or 9--from Lay. Mr. Lay offered "a heads-up" about the corporation's credit crisis but asked for nothing, O'Neill said. 

"I didn't think this was worthy of me running across the street and telling the president," Mr. O'Neill told Fox News on Sunday. "I frankly think what Ken told me over the phone was not new news." 

Not news? If Enron was too far gone for help at this point, Enron certainly wasn't admitting the fact. 

Indeed, at this point, Enron was in feverish negotiations with Dynegy, its smaller rival, about a buyout. Enron, to this day says a merger at that date would have been fruitful and is suing Houston-based Dynegy for backing out of it. 

In late October, Enron, also based in Houston, was still borrowing heavily. On Oct. 25, it said it had drawn $1 billion from banks against its existing unsecured credit lines. On Nov. 1, it announced that J.P. Morgan Chase and Solomon Smith Barney, a unit of Citigroup, had agreed to lend it another $1 billion in secured credit. 

On Oct. 29, Lay called Evans to ask about reviews of Enron's business by credit agencies, and Lay did ask for help. Evans said he did nothing to assist Lay or Enron, but also said Lay did not make him aware of the full story. 

"When I was talking to Ken I wasn't thinking about bankruptcy," Evans said in an interview with NBC's Meet the Press. "I was thinking maybe their credit rating would be dropped some ... but it wasn't the crisis yet that ensued some 30 days later." Evans said he was not told any information that had not already been made public. 

In other words, what O'Neill said was old news, Evans said was still an unfolding saga. Enron, for its part, was still, it appears, spinning a happier story to creditors and possible merger partners. 

Unlike O'Neill, Evans said he did inform the White House--not the president himself but Chief of Staff Andrew Card Jr. about the call. He also said he generally discussed Enron's problems with President Bush several times in November and December. Evans told Bush "how sad it was to see what was happening to that once great company," but he omitted mention of Lay's calls. 

Evans said he never considered doing a favor for Lay. "If I had stepped in, I think it would have been an egregious abuse of the office of secretary of commerce," he said on Meet the Press. 

It is not clear what kind of help Evans might have provided. He might have offered a subtle nudge to bankers or credit agencies. Evans could possibly have bought the company some time, if nothing else. 

But the irony here is that Enron was so politically connected, and its political connections so well known, that any effort to bail out the company in November or December of 2001 would have been politically impossible, even assuming it would have been sound policy. Enron was too hot to handle, at least in any public way. 

Enron's demise, however, does not seem to have caused a ripple in the economy or even the energy sector, beyond its devastating effect on Enron's employees and retirement plan members, whose savings were wiped out with the deflation of Enron's shares. Enron's demise has also affected Houston's cultural community, which Enron helped fund. But the fact that the company--the nation's seventh largest, according to its claimed revenue--could file for bankruptcy and cease its most lucrative operations without wider effect suggests how economically inconsequential Enron was all along. 

Enron did have an impact in the political sector. Nearly half of the current members of the House of Representatives and about three-quarters of all senators received contributions from the company. Enron has contributed a total of $5.7 million to both political parties since 1989, 73% to Republicans, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. 

Lay and other Enron employees were among the president's largest political benefactors. They doled out $623,000 over the course of his political career, according to another group that favors an overhaul of campaign finance, the Center for Public Integrity. 

While Enron got no help from the government on its death bed, its seeding of the nation's political system no doubt bore fruit along the way. Enron was tight with politicians and with Wall Street, whose analysts almost universally backed the company even after Lay was placing calls to Cabinet officers. As a result, in both the financial community and in the political community, few questions were asked during Enron's rise.



Dabhol Power on the verge of shutting operations

The cash-strapped Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) is on the verge of shutting its operations in India. 
Close on the heels of handing out pink slips to about 200 of its employees in the country last month, it may now have to lay off its support staff which had been retained as consultants. DPC has already shut its Delhi office and is now taking preliminary steps to close its Mumbai office.
"We had retained a core team after the last round of lay offs. For the last few months, we have not paid their salaries. But, it is very difficult to say if the core team will be asked to go at this point of time. We have also asked employees in the Mumbai office not to attend work as we are not in a position to pay even the electricity bills," a DPC spokesman said. 
DPC may even lay off the security personnel at the 2,184 mw project site at Ratnagiri district in Maharashtra. The project site has about 300 security personnel. 
"Since the security of the assets is essential, withdrawing the already insufficient security staff can only be the last resort. But, if immediate funding is not forthcoming, even that might happen," the spokesman added. 
DPC has squarely put the blame for the present state of affairs on the default on bill payments by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) and the refusal by the lenders to use the existing DPC funds or infuse fresh funds. 
DPC executives say that the lenders had at their last meeting in Singapore informally agreed to release funds in the trust and retention account, but have not done so till date. 
The trust and retention account, with around $8 to $10 million funds, is being operated by the Bank of America. DPC cannot touch this money without the consent of the lenders. 
Enron, General Electric and Bechtel, which hold a combined stake of 85 per cent in DPC, have decided to exit the project following a payments dispute with MSEB. Tata Power, BSES, Shell and the Gas Authority of India Ltd are in the fray for acquiring their stake.

BG Remains In Talks With Enron For Indian Upstream Assets
By Michael Wang
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

01/14/2002
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- U.K. oil and gas concern BG Group PLC (BRG) said Monday it remained in talks with Enron Corp. (ENE) to renegotiate a $388 million deal to acquire the financially-stricken U.S. company's upstream assets in India. 
"We are continuing to negotiate a new deal with Enron," said BG spokesman Robin O'Kelly.
Johan Zaayman, a spokesman at the Houston-based Enron which recently filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition, said "we are still trying to iron out the details." He declined to elaborate. 
The two sides have been forced to rework the original transaction, signed Oct. 3, when BG missed a Dec. 20 deadline to clinch a separate, but related, agreement with Indian partners on management rights to three offshore oil and gas fields. 
Since late December, BG has been in separate negotiations with Enron and state-owned Indian oil and gas company Oil and Natural Gas Corp., or ONGC, in a bid to salvage a major expansion program in the sub-continent. 
O'Kelly wouldn't say when BG last talked with Enron and wouldn't be drawn on a likely date when the transaction will be re-signed. 
BG has faced acute embarrassment having thrice failed to meet self-imposed deadlines on resolving the thorny issue of operatorship, or day-to-day management, of the Panna, Mukta and Tapti fields with ONGC. 
ONGC holds a 40% stake in the fields and BG is aiming to acquire Enron's 30% interest and inherit its operatorship of the assets. Indian petrochemicals company Reliance Industries Ltd. owns the remaining 30% of the three fields. 
A source close to the talks denied BG is trying to take advantage of Enron's financial problems and renegotiate a sweeter deal. 
"If we get this deal with Enron at a lower price, than that's a bonus," the source said. "We're still very happy with $388 million (as the price tag)." 
Nevertheless, O'Kelly expressed concern that with Enron in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, the process of renegotiation could become complicated as it will involve a bankruptcy judge. 
"It doesn't make it any easier," he said. 
BG's negotiations with ONGC appear at a standstill. 
According to ONGC officials, BG has twice offered cash payments to ONGC in exchange for operatorship rights. The first, in late November for $7.5 million, was rejected by ONGC as inadequate. 
A second offer, which analysts believe was around $8.5-$9.0 million, was also dismissed. Indian-based analysts reckon a cash offer close to $18 million would secure operatorship for BG. 
According to one London-based analyst, the British exploration and production company has also reportedly dangled, without luck, slices of some of its Brazilian offshore acreage. 
O'Kelly wouldn't comment on the state of discussions with ONGC. 
But, a two-day international oil and gas conference in New Delhi beginning Tuesday may offer the opportunity for both sides to rekindle talks. BG India Chief Executive Nigel Shaw is scheduled to make a presentation at the conference on Wednesday.

POINT OF VIEW: The Enron Saga Reaches A Whole New Level
By Michael Rapoport

01/14/2002
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- So the Enron Corp. (ENE) scandal has finally gone nuclear.
Not that this comes as a tremendous surprise. So far, Enron has sullied the reputation of just about everyone who's had anything much to do with it, from its auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, to one of its primary bankers, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM), to the rest of the energy-trading industry. Why should George W. Bush be any different? 
All along, the only thing this saga of financial hanky-panky has been missing - the element to give this story the critical mass to push it from the business pages to the front page - is a real whiff of political hanky-panky. A concrete indication that Enron had tried to use its status as a major benefactor of the president of the United States to its own advantage. That's what we got last week, when it was revealed that Enron executives had called Bush administration officials as the company spiraled toward bankruptcy, to try to coax them to take action to help save the company. 
Administration officials have said they took no such action, but that hardly matters at the moment. For purposes of determining the significance the public and press assign this story in the scheme of things, what matters is that Enron made the attempt at all. Outside the narrow confines of Wall Street, most people don't know from conflict-ridden off-balance-sheet partnerships or shady accounting practices ... but everyone understands influence-peddling and how wrong it is. A scandal-ridden company asks for special favors from an administration it helped pay to put in office? Oh, boy. Or, to use President Bush's now-well-publicized nickname for Enron's chief executive: Oh, Kenny Boy. 
Combine that with the near-simultaneous news that Arthur Andersen has shredded Enron-related documents - destruction of evidence being another bit of scandalous behavior that a layman can easily understand - and all of a sudden a complex financial story has been elevated to a thoroughly mainstream, they'll-talk-about-it-on-the-street-as-well-as-the-Street scandal. 
You want to know how mainstream this story is now? The three major network Sunday-morning talk shows, not usually renowned for their explorations of financial fraud, all spent copious amounts of time on the Enron story this Sunday. Dennis Miller cracked before Saturday night's NFL playoff game that the New York Jets, who had traveled between New York and California three times in a week, "have been flying back and forth across this country more frequently than a bagman for Enron." The topic of this week's Top Ten List contest on David Letterman's Web site: "Top Ten Excuses of Enron's Executives." That's how mainstream. 
The fact that there's no credible indication as yet that anyone in the Bush administration did anything improper about Enron isn't going to slow down the story one bit. The questions the Bushies face over Enron are at least as legitimate as the questions their predecessors the Clintonites faced for years over the Whitewater affair, and after congressional Republicans battered Bill Clinton for years with investigation after investigation, you'd better believe the Democrats are smelling payback. (Of course, the Democrats have to tread carefully; many of them got contributions from Enron too.) 
And it's an interesting quirk of timing, at the very least, that Bush's first in-depth public comments about the Enron fiasco came last week, just before the disclosures that may turn Enron into a major problem for his administration. 
It's kind of ironic: For weeks, the plight of thousands of Enron employees who've lost their retirement savings - Bush's fellow Texans, the bulk of them - couldn't make the broad public take much note of the Enron scandal, especially while the war in Afghanistan dominated the news. The prospect of a few highly placed people facing hard questions about what they did or didn't do on Enron's behalf has made people sit up and take notice virtually overnight. 
Where the investigation goes from here, no one can know. But for the first time, it appears President Bush, like others before him, may yet rue the day he first heard of Enron.

TALES OF THE TAPE: Energy Traders Hammer Out Debt Fix
By Christina Cheddar

01/14/2002
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Homeowners know it only takes one lousy neighbor to ruin it for everyone else on the block.
For the power sector, the spoiler was Enron Corp. (ENE). The one-time industry leader's questionable financial practices and rapid descent into bankruptcy sent jitters through the market, forcing investors to re-evaluate whether the sector was on the wrong side of the tracks. 
Ratings agencies - particularly Moody's Investors Service - acting like a zealous neighborhood watch, tightened standards and gave ultimatums. Both Calpine Corp. (CPN) and Mirant Corp. (MIR) were faced with a credit rating downgrade that placed the companies below investment grade, while the ratings of Dynegy Inc. (DYN) and NRG Energy Inc. (NRG) were put on watch for the same. 
Each energy merchant responded the best way it could. One by one, the companies began renovating balance sheets and launching recapitalization programs. 
Some threw out loans with triggers linked to credit ratings like bad shingles threatening to bring the roof down. Other firms moved off-balance sheet debt back onto financial statements, and announced ways to reduce debt and lower spending. Like so many corporate garage sales, assets - power plants, oil and gas properties, and even a refinery - went on the auction block, and new equity offerings were held. 
In other words, each company tried every way possible to show that despite the misdeeds of one neighbor, they were were all good corporate citizens. 
Investors and industry watchers may not agree on whether these balance sheet renovations were necessary improvements. But most will agree the changes are more than cosmetic, and will place the companies on the road to stronger performance. 
Susan Abbott, managing director at Moody's Investors Services, said the plans "aren't just window dressing." But she warned the magic will be in the execution. She is concerned that some companies may have difficulty raising additional funds through asset sales in what has quickly become a buyers' market. 
"From our perspective, the companies should sell assets that do not fit into the strategic plan," Abbott said. "What are they doing owning these assets anyway?" 
She expects oil and gas properties that have proven reserves will be among the first assets that will be divested, possibly in as little as 30 days. Other assets will take longer to sell. 
In some cases, equity offerings have bought firms some time to find the right buyer. (Unfortunately, at the expense of some value from current shareholders.) 
Equity Offerings Bought Time For Asset Sales 

"Mirant raised equity," Abbott said. "That's a good thing for them. Their ability to sell $1.5 billion of assets ... that will be the execution part we will be anxiously waiting to see." 
If Mirant achieves its goals, and Moody's restores Mirant's investment grade status, the upgrade will be a catalyst for the stock, said Richard Giesen, manager of the Munder Power Plus fund. Giesen said he took advantage of Mirant's equity offering to add shares to his portfolio. 
"I do think there's a good possibility Moody's could reverse (its downgrade) after the meeting with the company (this week)," Giesen said. 
The Power Plus fund has roughly 9% of its assets invested in companies with energy trading operations, he said. As an investor in the sector, Giesen said he wishes the companies weren't forced to issue additional equity because of the earnings dilution. 
"I wish they hadn't done it, but I realize it was a necessary evil given the circumstances," he said. 
To get a sense of the impact, Merrill Lynch analyst Steve Fleishman said his 2002 earnings estimates were reduced by an average of 15% for those companies who announced recapitalization programs. 
But earnings dilution wasn't the only reason why investors appeared to be universally critical of Moody's decision to raise the bar for sector. Many said it was wrong to change the rules overnight. 
Moody's Abbott said she is aware of the criticism. 
"These companies have a need to grow," Abbott said, "but the first step is to repair the balance sheets and establish a good relationship between cash flow and debt. ... Then the companies can focus on growth, but they can do it in a more balanced fashion, which means slower." 
Market Waiting To Hear More During Earnings Season 

Fourth-quarter conference calls, which will begin this week, will give some of the companies in the group another chance to outline goals for the year. According to several portfolio managers, the market isn't likely to view aggressive growth plans favorably. 
Still, the portfolio managers aren't writing off the growth potential for the sector. 
"California dodged a major bullet because of unseasonably mild weather," Giesen said. Mild weather and a weak economy are masking regional supply shortages and transmission grid problems that could again result in higher energy prices and improved earnings power in the sector, according to the portfolio manager. 
Plus, the potential for oversupplied markets has been reduced as some companies cancel plans for power plants, said Merrill's Fleishman. 
"We note, however," the analyst said, "that most of the 2002-2003 plants are already being built, so the benefit is mainly in 2004 and beyond." 
There also is the chance of stock appreciation, even if the sector doesn't win back its growth moniker and the associated price-to-earnings multiples. According to Basu Mullick, portfolio manager of the Neuberger Berman Partners fund, relative to expectations, some in the sector are not even trading at utility valuations, which means there is room to rise. 
Mullick favors El Paso Corp. (EP), which closed Friday at $41.77, and Williams Cos. (WMB), which ended the day at $25.50. Both stocks have come off the 52-week lows hit amid the heightened credit concerns last month, but the stocks remain sharply below their price ceilings. 
Investors said they were impressed by the ability of company managers to react to the new credit requirements. As a result, investors expect fourth-quarter conference calls to continue to stress debt reduction. 
The stocks could get a kick if the companies report they have been gaining market share in the wake of Enron's exit. This is most likely to come from market players such as Duke Energy Corp. (DUK), that had strong credit quality going into this period of uncertainty, some investors said. 
Going forward, Fleishman said he thinks it also is the companies with strong balance sheets that will be able to benefit from acquiring new assets on the cheap. He cited Duke, Entergy Corp. (ETR) and American Electric Power Corp. (AEP). 
The bottom line is most investors feel the short-term liquidity issues have been addressed, and now it is just a matter of waiting for energy prices to firm. 
"For the patient investor, the risk-reward looks pretty good," said Glen Hilton, portfolio manager at Montgomery Asset Management.

Rhonda`s Roundtable
Rhonda Schaffler, Allan Chernoff

01/14/2002
CNNfn: Market Coverage - Morning
(c) Copyright Federal Document Clearing House. All Rights Reserved.

RHONDA SCHAFFLER, CNNfn ANCHOR, MARKET CALL: Welcome back to MARKET CALL. One of the many angles of the Enron (URL: http://.www.enron.com/) mess is what is happening to the trading unit. 
Allan Chernoff has been following that story for us and he`s got an update.
Allan? 
ALLAN CHERNOFF, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT, MARKET CALL: Right. You know, Rhonda, the details of this were supposed to have been released at 8:30 this morning - they are now being pushed back to 3 p.m. But the "Houston Chronicle," this morning, does have a report. And we understand from sources that it is a reliable source - reliable report - and in fact, the "Chronicle" is quoting Chief Financial Officer Jeff McMahon. 
So here is what the "Houston Chronicle" is reporting this morning in terms of the UBS (URL: http://www.ubs.com/) deal to buy Enron`s energy trading businesses. First of all, there will be no cash paid right up front and Enron will not have an ownership stake in the trading business. What will happen apparently, is that UBS is likely to give Enron 1/3 of the pre-tax profits from the energy trading business. That would be for year one and year two. And according to the report, in year three that would be pushed down if an option is exercised to 22 percent, then down to 11 percent, and then finally, down to zero percent. 
So again, the headline there is that he would be receiving 33 percent at the beginning. There you have all the details. Now apparently, UBS would be hiring most of the 800 traders and marketers that work at the Houston headquarters, and UBS would also be paying rent for the office space that it is using. 
So, Rhonda, that`s the latest that we have on that front. 
RHONDA SCHAFFLER, CNNfn ANCHOR, MARKET CALL: All right, thanks so much, Allan. At least those people get it keep their jobs if we try to . 
CHERNOFF: We`ll see if it all happens. 
SCHAFFLER: Yes. Exactly. So 2 p.m. Eastern is when some more details . 
CHERNOFF: That`s when they`re releasing the details. Keep in mind, the judge still has to sign off on that. Originally, he was supposed to do that Tuesday. It was then pushed off to Thursday, and now it`s Friday. 
SCHAFFLER: OK. With that, we kick off the Roundtable. Andy Serwer of "Fortune" is here and our guest host, Todd Eberhard, joins me as well. 
Andy, what`s on your mind this morning? 
ANDY SERWER, EDITOR-AT-LARGE, "FORTUNE": Well, you know, here we go again with the negative sentiment own Wall Street, sort of a real bearish morning. Rich Bernstein at Merrill Lynch cutting that firm`s allocation of stocks and very important downgrades. Over at Lehman, one report, I think, is really having a negative effect comes out of S&P. It concerns corporate bankruptcies. 
Not a surprise, 2001 was a record for corporate bankruptcies; 211 companies worldwide declaring bankruptcy; $115 billion of debt. Here`s what struck me, though: It breaks the old record of 2,000, when 132 companies declared bankruptcy for $43 billion. So we went from $43 billion to $115 billion. And, you know, last year we had Enron (URL: http://.www.enron.com/) and PG&E (URL: http://www.pgecorp.com/) in California, you know, the utilities. So, are we going to go for a trifecta (ph) this year? Let`s hope now. That is a tremendous jump in two years in a row, records like that. So, not having a good effect on the Street. 
SCHAFFLER: And, of course, there are all these scattered, you know, rumors out there, whether it`s K-Mart (URL: http://www.kmart.com/) seems to be the one in focus as a possible company that could go next. But, those are clearly alarming figures. And if things don`t turn around . 
TODD EBERHARD, GUEST HOST, MARKET CALL: Well, that`s the question: Are we now through the worst for - into `02 or the first half of `02. It may continue to be bad, but is the second half going to turn around. And if you start to see a lessening in those bankruptcies and start to see a turnaround in some corporate profits, I mean, that becomes a statistics from the bygone era, to a degree, and maybe focus forward, not backward. 
SCHAFFLER: There`s a lot of maybes in there. 
EBERHARD: Well, yes. It`s true. 
SCHAFFLER: Did you catch that? 
CHERNOFF: And, the Street really is worried about what happens going forward. 
EBERHARD: Sure. 
CHERNOFF: I mean, we`re not - we know that we`ve had an awful year. We know that the recession is always under way. We know there are a lot of bankruptcies. The story is, do we turn around in terms of profits? 
SERWER: And the problem is, again - that we keep wrestling with here over the past couple days - is we`ve already come back so far from the Nader in late September. And now the feeling is we`ve gone too far, we`ve gotten ahead of ourselves. Holly Becker of Lehman Brothers downgrading eBay (URL: http://www.ebay.com/) this morning for just that kind of reason. She`s saying, take profits. This thing is back up. It`s up. It`s the only Internet stock that matters. It`s the only Internet stock that has held 
up. 
CHERNOFF: Well, it`s the best run Internet company bar none, by far. 
SERWER: Right, right, and the stock reflects that. 
CHERNOFF: And we`re not going to include AOL Time Warner (URL: http://www.aol.com/) as an Internet company. 
SCHAFFLER: Oh, Allan. That would be like unplugging this media company . 
SERWER: "CBS MarketWatch" had a report this morning on their Web site rating the AOL Time Warner, giving it a "D." 
SCHAFFLER: For what? 
SERWER: For just performance - and compared it to Disney (URL: http://www.disney.com/) . It compared it to the HHH, which is the Merrill Lynch Internet index, and said that it lagged all those. And so, the one-year anniversary, good folks at "CBS MarketWatch" gave AOL Time Warner a "D." 
SCHAFFLER: Even with all the great inflation out there these days. 
CHERNOFF: The good competitors . 
SERWER: Yes. 
SCHAFFLER: There you go. 
SERWER: There`s a connection with Viacom (URL: http://www.viacom.com/) there, too, if my understanding is correct. 
SCHAFFLER: You know, Todd, if we`re in this situation here where we`re raising these questions: hey, when is it going to get better? Have we gone up too far? The market can really stagnate for months. I hate to raise that point, but if it doesn`t go down it can also go nowhere. 
EBERHARD: That`s a perfect example of what I think we`ve seen over the last week or two, to some degree. I mean, we`ve seen pullback, but I have to argue the other side for a second. With all this bad news on Enron, with all the bad news coming out of Ford Motor (URL: http://www.ford.com/) with layoffs, with all the bad news of all the dot-coms and everything else that occurred over the last 18 months, let`s call it, and the market getting killed, we have seen it stagnate, which is not a bad thing, to find that bottom, theoretically. 
SCHAFFLER: That would be our base building? 
EBERHARD: In theory, yes. You find that base building and then it builds from there. And it may take three months, six months to get really going again or maybe even longer. But at least it`s not heading lower with all the bad news coming out at this point. 
SERWER: Well, that`s sort of like having . 
SCHAFFLER: A positive spin. 
SERWER: Yes. How do you analyze Greenspan`s speech on Friday? Was it a half-empty speech? 
EBERHARD: That`s right. 
SERWER: A glass half-empty or a glass half-full? You know, he said, well, I don`t see any real signs on recovery. On the other hand, things aren`t getting worse, basically. You know, It`s hard for me to really sit here and see the market doing a whole lot first half of the year. I mean, I hate to say it but . 
SCHAFFLER: Yes. See? That`s what I`m wondering, too, because it just seems in the last week we had a couple of brokerages coming out and just 
saying, you know, in this particular group, valuations looked like they got ahead of themselves. Wireless, for instance, there was another wireless downgrade today. So it looks like there`s pockets where people are saying, all right, 100 percent recovery since September is enough. 
CHERNOFF: Rhonda, I really don`t buy what these brokerage analysts write at all. The bottom line is . 
EBERHARD: Allan . 
CHERNOFF: If you get a few companies coming out with halfway decent news, people are going to back in there bidding them up. It`s as simple as that. 
EBERHARD: Do you mean these guys who said that the dot-coms were going to go on forever and ever? 
CHERNOFF: Yes. 
SERWER: No, no, the guys who said that Enron was a buy. Those guys. 
EBERHARD: Oh, those guys. 
CHERNOFF: Oh! 
SCHAFFLER: That would be all of them, I think. 
CHERNOFF: They worked across the hall from here. 
SERWER: Absolutely. 
EBERHARD: It`s true, though. What you`re saying is accurate. If one or two companies do start to show numbers, and look at Intel (URL: http://www.intel.com/) , going back a short time ago; they came out with an OK number or "we think we`re doing better," and all of a sudden we`re off to the races again. And there`s a lot of cash out there to be placed, eventually. It may not be tomorrow or the next day. But, eventually, we will enter . 
SCHAFFLER: Nobody will want to miss that rally. So basically, we need somebody, right, where even though there are no fundamentals here and technically the stock is in bad shape, buy it anyway? That would make you happy? 
CHERNOFF: If there`s some halfway decent news, I think you`ll get people just jumping in once again. The turn is here. The turn`s here. 
SCHAFFLER: Last call, Andy. You`re first. 
SERWER: More fallout from Enron. I mean, it just permeates. Northern Trust (URL: http://www.ntrs.com/) , the big Chicago bank, today saying its earnings are down 18 percent. Big exposure to Enron is the reason why there is a write-off there. Stock`s not doing too badly. It still has a pretty high multiple. But we`ll see things like this happen. 
SCHAFFLER: Allan? 
CHERNOFF: Well, Rhonda, we certainly want to pay attention to what happens here with the UBS deal, but also the House Energy and Commerce Committee is really the focus of where the action is right now. They`re the ones who uncovered this memo, apparently, that had been issued by an in-house lawyer at Andersen to tell people, you can get rid of some of those documents. More details are definitely going to be coming out very shortly. 
SCHAFFLER: And they will be interesting. That`s for sure. 
Todd? 
EBERHARD: I think we will see more details and more hiccups on this Enron, as well as other deals that go on, and other people who are connected with it. But I think the market has absorbed most of it. So I`m not too concerned about that affecting valuations at this level. 
SCHAFFLER: That is our roundtable. "MARKET CALL" continues. 
In the next hour, we head back to the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq to find out what stocks are moving at this hour. President Bush visits America`s heartland to talk about the economy. And Microsoft has 
plenty of cash on happened, but should that money go to paying out dividends? 
We`ll explore that on our "Tough Call" segment.

For an instant take on how 2001 treated investors, all you had to do was fl=
ick on your TV. Gone were the frenetic performance-touting spots of years p=
ast. In their place: dour Schwab ads in which founder Charles admonishes a =
mock town meeting of gray-clad investors, "You have to take the ups with th=
e downs."=20
Signs of new stock market sobriety were everywhere this year: CNBC viewersh=
ip tumbled, ten rate cuts by Greenspan & Co. still couldn't stave off a rec=
ession, and highly paid analysts were not only stripped of celebrity status=
 but also sued by investors (Mary Meeker) or humbled into accepting buyout =
packages (Henry Blodget). By early December the Nasdaq was down 17% for the=
 year, the Dow had fallen 6%, and the S&P was off by 12%.
Then again, "there are so many scenarios you could have written that would =
have been so much worse," points out Roy Weitz, editor of FundAlarm.com. In=
 fact, since the unprecedented four-day market shutdown and subsequent slid=
e after the Sept. 11 attacks, the Dow has rebounded 13%. Given the year we'=
ve had--what with events like the Enron implosion, the Bass brothers' massi=
ve margin call, and the uproar over a giant diaphragm in Denver (read on fo=
r an explanation)- -it's entirely possible that the last few weeks of 2001 =
will bring even more surprises. Let's hope at least some of them are happy =
ones.=20
S&P 500 standout: J.C. Penney led the pack for most of 2001 but late in the=
 year was eclipsed by Nvidia, which makes graphics chips for Microsoft's Xb=
ox, among other things. The company got an extra boost when it inherited En=
ron's spot on the S&P 500 and index fund managers raced to buy the stock. G=
ain for the year: 225%.=20
S&P 500 laggard: Lending can be a risky business, especially if your niche =
is hawking credit cards to people with spotty credit histories just as the =
economy heads into a tailspin. Such was the fate of Providian Financial, wh=
ich lost a full 95% of its value amid a spectacular run of credit card defa=
ults.=20
Best way to cash out: Selling your stake in a company you built is never ea=
sy, but if you're Tom Bailey, the company is Janus, and you have a "look ba=
ck" provision in your contract allowing you to unload your shares at the 20=
00 price, which reaps $603 million--well, it tugs at the heartstrings a lit=
tle less.=20
Worst way to cash out: Margin calls are always ugly, but rarely quite as bi=
g--or as publicized--as the late-September fiasco in which longtime Disney =
shareholders Sid and Lee Bass (and their dad, Perry) were forced to sell 13=
5 million shares for around $2 billion. It gets worse: Their shares fetched=
 only $15 each in a private deal; Disney stock now trades for $22.=20
Best fund: In a year marked by--at best--middling performances, the small-c=
ap Schroder Ultra gained a stellar 62% by keeping lots of cash on hand (aro=
und 40%), using put options, and shorting stocks (like a hedge fund). The o=
nly drawback? The fund is closed to new investors.=20
Best reason to manage your own money: Fund manager James McCall of the Merr=
ill Lynch Focus Twenty. Merrill waged a bitter legal battle to lure the the=
n-hot momentum manager from Pilgrim Baxter two years ago. It's no doubt reg=
retting that decision now: McCall got his walking papers in November after =
the Focus fund, which held tech, telecom, and Enron, lost 70%.=20
Worst reason to manage your own money: You may be a step ahead of McCall, b=
ut hanging on to your day job is probably a good idea, judging from the per=
formance of so-called market-participation funds. At the IPS iFund, where s=
hareholders nominate stock picks on a Website, collective wisdom precipitat=
ed a 37% decline for the year. The StockJungle.com Community Intelligence F=
und, for its part, was put out of its misery in August after losing about 3=
6%.=20
Most awkward PR flub: When Denver fund company Invesco agreed to pay $120 m=
illion over 20 years to slap its name on the Broncos stadium, it was no dou=
bt angling for good press. So when a Denver Post columnist wrote that Inves=
co's own employees had dubbed it the "Diaphragm," it had to hurt. Invesco t=
hreatened to sue but let up when it discovered that some staffers really di=
d think the stadium bore a striking likeness to a gigantic birth-control de=
vice.=20
Hottest IPO: Let's just say 2001 wasn't exactly an ideal year to take your =
company public. September, in fact, had the distinction of being the first =
month since 1975 in which there were no IPOs whatsoever. Yet there were a f=
ew success stories, including the best performer (from the date the company=
 went public to present): a Mountain View, Calif., company called Verisity,=
 which makes software to detect flaws in electronic systems. Since its Marc=
h IPO, the stock has doubled.=20
Should've stayed private: Bringing up the rear in the IPO brigade was Seatt=
le sandwich maker Briazz: Rattled working people shunned its pricey gourmet=
 sandwiches, and investors lost their appetite as well- -the stock is down =
88% since the IPO in May.=20
Nastiest boardroom battle: The acrimonious drama had more twists, turns, an=
d 1980s-style backbiting than an episode of Dallas, but in the end Computer=
 Associates founder and chairman Charles Wang triumphed over Texas investor=
 Sam Wyly (who proposed a rival slate of directors, charging that Computer =
Associates had floundered under Wang's stewardship).=20
Biggest boardroom upset: Lone shareholder Guy Adams got so fed up with Lone=
 Star Steakhouse management that he ran against CEO Jamie Coulter for his b=
oard seat. Unbelievably, he won--by a reported 2.3 million votes.=20
Most embarrassing Enron call: There was lots of competition here: bad calls=
, late calls, and gutless calls by analysts (not to mention the conference =
call in which CEO Jeffrey Skilling labeled one money manager an a--hole), b=
ut special distinction goes to Ron Barone of UBS Warburg, who lowered his r=
ating on the stock from a strong buy to a hold--on Nov. 28, just days befor=
e Enron declared bankruptcy. Uh, thanks.=20
Best makeover: The urge to merge raged this year as fund companies attempte=
d to save face by folding hideous specialty funds into slightly less hideou=
s tech funds. Strong Internet was merged into the Strong Technology 100 fun=
d, and Merrill Lynch Internet Strategies was bled into the Merrill Lynch Gl=
obal Technology fund. But proving yet again that it really is what's on the=
 inside that counts, the Strong fund has so far lost 39%, and the Merrill f=
und is down 42%.=20
Greatest career gamble: With a middling investing record on his resume, Jam=
es Oberweis, dairy magnate and founder of the eponymous asset-management fi=
rm, announced he would vie for a U.S. Senate seat in Illinois. Perhaps in l=
ight of the markets' turbulence, anything looks easier than facing the Nasd=
aq.=20
Best prediction for 2002: Finally, we wondered what investors could look fo=
rward to next year. Fund watchdog Weitz predicts that mutual fund marketing=
 gurus are already dreaming up a spate of "new reality" funds filled with d=
efense and biotech stocks. Not the most tasteful proposition, perhaps, but =
given this year's exploits, probably not far off the mark. Let's just hope =
it doesn't land them in the loser's circle next year.=20

1. 9.11 That the World Trade Center attacks could leave New York City $100 =
billion in the red seems oddly beside the point. They destroyed thousands o=
f lives and livelihoods, shattered our nation's sense of security, and plun=
ged us into war.=20
2. The Recession With the market melting down, consumer confidence evaporat=
ing, and joblessness rising, not even Alan Greenspan's ten rate cuts--and a=
nother expected this month--could stave off recession. At least you lived t=
o see the biggest boom ever. Now wave bye-bye.
3. The Enron Implosion Thanks to the energy trader's dubious bookkeeping, K=
en Lay went from running a $101 billion company to presiding over the bigge=
st bankruptcy in history.=20
4. California's Energy Crisis As energy became scarce, the state instituted=
 rolling blackouts and spent $11 billion to bail out PG&E and SoCal Edison.=
 While conservation stabilized soaring prices, the crisis--plus the Enron c=

5. Wall Street Analysts Henry Blodget and Mary Meeker were the poster child=
ren for Wall Street hype. But this was the year investors, burned by analys=
ts' stock picks, stopped believing and started suing and booing.=20
6. Team Bush No one expected much from the President and his advisors on fo=
reign policy. The focus was supposed to be domestic policy, like the tax cu=
t. Sept. 11 turned that around. Bush has emerged as a strong war leader, bu=
t his legacy could still depend upon reviving the economy.=20
7. Telecom Meltdown If you think this Lucent office looks empty, ask one of=
 the company's employees about his 401(k). The entire industry suffered stu=

10.Ford Chairman Bill Ford ousted bare-knuckled CEO Jacques Nasser after a =

Dear Santa,=20
I can't believe it's that time of year again. I hope this letter finds you =
in the best of health. I think I speak for everybody when I tell you that w=
e've been very, very good this time around, so this is going to be a rather=
 long list. Grab something wet, pull up a Barcalounger, and pay attention.
At the outset, let me say I consider it a miracle that this letter reached =
you at all. I figure you have security up the wazoo, what with all the wack=
os sending stuff through the snail mail. That whole drill has to make your =
job a lot tougher. Be patient, Santa, and don't cut corners. Don't get comp=
lacent. There's more than one evildoer who would love to take the blush out=
 of the cheeks of a symbol of Western hedonism like you. But don't worry ab=
out this letter, of course! If there's any white powder on the envelope, it=
 came from one of the freshly baked doughnuts I have waiting on the mantle =
for your upcoming visit!=20
Anyhow, this year it's clear that many, many people are a lot more needy th=
an I am, so in the spirit of the season I'm gonna ask for their presents fi=
rst.=20
I should start, I guess, with the poor folks at Andersen, the accounting an=
d consulting firm. Boy, Santa, do those guys need some new calculators! Ple=
ase get a whole bunch for them. They approved the books for the fellows ove=
r at Enron, whose earnings didn't turn out to really be what they said they=
 were at first. Then they had to restate them. Was their collective face re=
d! I'm sure if the Andersen people had better equipment, they wouldn't have=
 screwed up like that with Enron, or with all the other corporations they s=
eemingly permitted to wank around with their numbers in exchange for hefty =
consulting fees.=20
While we're at it, I suppose we can't ignore the senior management that use=
d to run Enron either. What a bunch of boneheads! But this is the holiday t=
ime of year, Santa, the season of forgiveness and giving, so why not make t=
heir executive homes your first stop? They need a lot, Santa. To start with=
, they're gonna want, like, thousands of hours of legal time from expensive=
 firms, so give them that. And why not throw in a couple of files they can =
bake into cakes for later on?=20
On your way out of town, forget about toys and games and stuff like that an=
d just please leave a ton of money under the tree of every Enron employee, =
particularly the fired ones, and of course the older ones who thought they =
were going to have something to retire on. And as for the financial planner=
s who allowed employees' 401(k)s to hold solely the company's stock, I supp=
ose you should bring very special presents for them too...I can't think of =
what, though...How about we let the Enron work force figure that one out?=
=20
There are so many business executives to think about this year too. Most of=
 them you could make happy with fractional growth in Ebitda for the quarter=
. That would be a huge surprise, and you know how much executives like plea=
sant surprises!=20
Bill Gates? You don't need to bring anything for him, Santa. He has just ab=
out everything, you know, and what he doesn't have, he can certainly take o=
ver and repackage as part of his operating system. But I guess you should t=
ry to make sure that there's an Xbox under every American child's tree this=
 year, and a couple of games too, particularly the one where those buff gir=
ls in tiny Spandex outfits throw each other around. Just knowing he was mak=
ing so many children happy would bring a seasonal smile to Bill's Microface=
.=20
Oh. Make a very special trip to Carly Fiorina too. She's the woman who runs=
 Hewlett-Packard, you know. She worked so hard this year and had so much ag=
gravation, Santa, so...could you please make Walter Hewlett go away? He's t=
he son of the founder, and he's being a real party pooper! He thinks that t=
he merger is bad for a lot of stupid reasons...like something about how it =
will draw the company away from its core competencies in printing and focus=
 it on the low-margin computer-manufacturing side of the business, but when=
 you get right down to it, he's simply being a bummer, that's all. Please, =
Santa. Bring Carly her merger. She's staked her whole reputation--and her b=
onus next year--on the outcome, and, you know, any CEO who is willing to ri=
sk compensation on something must want it really, really bad.=20
While you're at it, please bring John Chambers, the head of Cisco, a good s=
tock price right away. The poor fellow has six million options riding on it=
. Four million of them are underwater, but more recently the company gave h=
im two million more at a strike price of $18.50, and they should be worth s=
omething, don't you think? If you don't, Mr. Chambers will really feel that=
 $268,131 he gave up in salary to show he knows that corporations should pa=
y for performance and nothing less.=20
Gee, this is getting kind of long, and I haven't even gotten to myself yet!=
 So, just briefly, bring Alan Greenspan something nice but healthy, Santa--=
very, very healthy, no cigars or liquor. Vitamins! Yeah! And let's see...oh=
, yes, bring the Internet some genuine advertising revenue, will you? It co=
uld really use it. And don't forget to leave the folks over at the New York=
 Times business section some Prozac. Or Viagra, maybe. Anything to cheer th=
em up.=20
For myself, now...well, I guess I have just about everything a man could wa=
nt, so I'll just mention a few of the things I could do without. Bring me n=
o cutbacks in my stocking, Santa, for me or my friends, and no smallpox, an=
d no anthrax, and no particular reasons to travel anywhere by plane, at lea=
st for a while. And most of all please do not bring a suitcase with a nucle=
ar weapon in it for anybody I know, and even the people I don't. Other than=
 that, I could always use a new car. Anything will do, as long as the top g=
oes down. And a phone even tinier than the one I have, to show I'm getting =
more powerful. And hey, keep this global warming going on. It's great!=20
Now get busy, my man! You're gonna need plenty of time before takeoff this =
year, you know, to interview all the reindeer twice after conducting extens=
ive background checks on all of them, especially Rudolph, whose nose always=
 looked a little red to me, and to X-ray all those packages, no matter how =
small they might be, while making sure nothing has been placed in the bagga=
ge compartments underneath your sleigh by the grinches who want to steal a =
whole lot more than Christmas. Fly safe, Santa! We need you more than ever =
this year!=20
Oh--and while you're over Iraq, if you happen to spot a suspicious factory =
or laboratory of any sort, don't forget to pop a nice little present down i=
ts chimney, from--and for--all of us.=20
Feliz Navidad, baby!=20

o longer be able to support its trading operations by accessing the capital=
 markets, and they triggered the repayment of billions of dollars of debt.=
=20
But the one-two credit punches pointed not just to a TKO of Enron. They wer=
e also a reminder of the immense and seemingly ever- increasing power of th=
e agencies themselves. A much-coveted triple-A rating (the highest grade) i=
s the grease in an otherwise squeaky engine. It makes every aspect of doing=
 business easier, from raising money to convincing customers that operation=
s are solid. In contrast, an S&P or Moody's downgrade is a fearsome event t=
hat can dramatically increase a company's cost of capital, perhaps even des=
troy its ability to raise money. As one critic put it decades ago, they ret=
ain an "almost biblical authority."
That's because the rating agencies--private, for-profit companies that are =
privy to insider information--have come to play a quasi- regulatory role in=
 the market. Many big investors, from pension funds to insur-ance companies=
 to money market funds, are prohibited from owning more than a set amount o=
f lower-rated debt, for instance.=20
But while the Enron debacle is evidence of the agencies' power, it also bri=
ngs some long-simmering criticism--think back to 1975, when the agencies fa=
iled to downgrade New York City's debt until the city's fiscal crisis was o=
bvious--to a frothy boil. Critics say that the credit czars, for all their =
inside access, didn't identify this borrower's woes any earlier than the re=
st of us did--and they didn't downgrade the debt even after the severity of=
 the problems was well known. Indeed, prior to the downgrades, Enron's debt=
 was trading at around 50 cents on the dollar, a sign that the market had a=
lready dismissed the company's investment-grade status as farce. "The ratin=
g agencies are always late," grouses one portfolio manager.=20
Of course, neither John Rutherfurd, the CEO of Moody's, nor Leo O'Neill, S&=
P's president, see things that way. "We communicated our view [that Enron's=
 rating was dependent on its merger with Dynegy] clearly and frequently," s=
ays O'Neill. Adds Rutherford: "We do not want to rush to judgment nor do we=
 delay in informing investors when we believe fundamentals have changed."=
=20
How can the same entities be all-powerful and strangely after-the- fact at =
the same time? That is one of the more puzzling conundrums in today's capit=
al markets. The nearly regulatory function of the agencies and the weight t=
heir opinions carry make their judgments critical--but also complicated. Th=
e agencies can be not just observers but active participants in the course =
of events. That's because a downgrade can become a self-fulfilling prophecy=
: If the rating agencies act too rashly, they could be accused of causing a=
 bankruptcy. Yet if they deliberate too long, they'll simply be stating wha=
t everyone already knows--especially since today, unlike in the '70s, there=
 is an army of outside fixed-income analysts that both challenge the rating=
 agencies' judgments and profit from anticipating their actions.=20
True, this debate rarely reaches Enron-esque proportions. And it's worth em=
phasizing that corporate debt is just a small part of these agencies' purvi=
ews. They analyze almost every fixed-income instrument out there, from the =
debt of China to the complex bonds backed by cash flows from, say, the Miss=
issippi tobacco settlement. Their power, in fact, is very much entwined wit=
h that omnipresence. Moody's alone claims that it rates more than $30 trill=
ion of the world's debt from over 100 countries, 4,200 corporations, and 68=
,000 public finance obligations.=20
What's more, the agencies appear, in the wide lens of history, to be fairly=
 accurate in their judgments: As both O'Neill and Rutherfurd note, it's rar=
e that investment- grade credits go kaput. Both agencies have statistics sh=
owing that less than 1% of bonds rated A- or better default over a five-yea=
r period. In addition, around 85% of the credits in the domestic A class st=
ill hold the rating at year- end, implying stability in higher-rated bonds.=
=20
But by its sheer size the Enron implosion challenges that perception of sta=
bility. And it draws attention to the agencies at a particularly interestin=
g time--for Moody's especially. Until recently the actual businesses of Moo=
dy's and S&P were hidden away inside much larger companies. S&P is still bu=
ried within McGraw-Hill. But in October 2000, Dun & Bradstreet spun Moody's=
 out as a separate company. For the first time ever, outsiders can perform =
a credit check on a rating agency.=20
Combing through Moody's financials makes one thing perfectly clear: Credit =
rating is a fabulous business. Since its spinoff, Moody's stock has climbed=
--yes, climbed--some 40%, giving Moody's the same market value as Bear Stea=
rns. This year the rating agency is expected to generate about $770 million=
 in revenues (less than a tenth of Bear's revenues) and an astounding $382 =
million in operating income. And Moody's does this with just 1,600 employee=
s. Perhaps it's not surprising that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is =
the company's largest shareholder, owning just about 15% of the stock. Henr=
y Berghoef of Harris Associates, another large Moody's holder, says that th=
e biggest challenge facing CEO Rutherfurd is the proper management of the c=
ompany's immense free cash flow. Rutherfurd himself, a scholarly, white-hai=
red 62-year-old, has few complaints. "It's a big thrill," he says.=20
Indeed, what's not to like? For one thing, Moody's potential customers almo=
st can't say no. As Merrill analyst Joanne Park wrote in a recent report, "=
In many cases, a Moody's rating is practically a prerequisite for coming to=
 market with a new issue of fixed-income securities." Like an investment ba=
nk, Moody's is a big beneficiary of the long-term growth in the capital mar=
kets--without even having to risk its own capital. Kevin Gruneich, an analy=
st at Bear Stearns, calculates that over the past 20 years Moody's revenue =
and profits grew at compound annual rates of 16% and 15%, respectively--a g=
rowth trend he terms "incredible." (Rutherfurd adds that in the past 20 yea=
rs, profits have fallen only once, in 1994.) In recent years Moody's has st=
abilized its revenue still further, basically creating an annuity stream by=
 instituting what it calls "relationship pricing." Instead of hiring Moody'=
s on a transactional basis, some of its customers now pay an annual fee; in=
 return, Moody's rates every bond issue they do. "Relationship pricing" now=
 accounts for 36% of Moody's revenues.=20
Both Moody's and S&P have also done a remarkable job of keeping pace with i=
nnovations in the capital markets. Witness the explosion of a new type of d=
ebt known as "structured finance"--a bond, for instance, backed by the cash=
 flow from residential mortgages. Here the rating is everything: It measure=
s the level of risk in an extremely complicated security and determines the=
 yield that must be paid to attract investors. "The rating agencies play an=
 integral role in distributing paper into the marketplace," says Kevin Rigb=
y, head of Deutsche Bank's rating advisory business, which helps Deutsche's=
 clients argue their cases to the rating agencies. (In yet another indicati=
on of the agencies' power, many of the major investment banks have entire d=
epartments that do this.) Structured finance is now Moody's largest busines=
s, accounting for one-third of its revenues, up from almost nothing in the =
late 1980s.=20
As Moody's pushes aggressively into new markets, it has expanded its power =
base as well. Rutherfurd is especially excited about Europe, which currentl=
y accounts for about 20% of the company's sales. He notes happily that ther=
e are about 1,500 unrated companies with revenues greater than one billion =
euros. "Money coming out of banking and into the capital markets should pro=
pel growth in ratings for the next decade," he says, quickly adding, "But w=
e love banks too." Indeed. Recently the Basel Committee on Banking Supervis=
ion proposed that ratings be used globally to determine banks' capital adeq=
uacy. (The proposal seems to be on hold for now.)=20
This is certainly not a state of affairs that John Moody would have imagine=
d when he began providing statistics on railroad bonds back in 1909. In the=
 beginning it was all very simple: Investors paid for Moody's research, whi=
ch helped disseminate important information to the market. Some two decades=
 later the government was mandating that banks use ratings to determine the=
 values of their investment portfolios. Then, in the second half of the cen=
tury, the SEC began to rely on ratings to determine what sort of securities=
 insurance companies, pension plans, broker-dealers, and money market funds=
 could own. Both Moody's and S&P resisted those developments for a number o=
f reasons--but they didn't say no. "I don't think that ratings should be us=
ed to determine investment policy," O'Neill maintains today; Moody's has wr=
itten a number of letters protesting the use of ratings in regulatory polic=
y.=20
Another substantial change occurred around 1970. Prior to that time Moody's=
 and S&P had always earned their keep from investor subscriptions. Given th=
e growing volume of work, however, those economics no longer made sense. So=
 first Moody's and then S&P began to charge issuers instead. There's a cons=
tant worry that this poses a conflict of interest. But unlike equity analys=
ts, the credit analysts don't have to worry about buying business with favo=
rable ratings. Companies simply don't have a lot of choice.=20
The most controversial development came in 1975 when the SEC, worried that =
fly-by-night rating agencies could wreak havoc on the market, initiated a m=
outhful of a designation, the "nationally recognized statistical rating org=
anization," or NSRSO. To comply with various SEC regulations, a company's r=
ating had to come from an NSRSO- -essentially, Moody's, S&P, or Fitch, a sm=
aller competitor that is a subsidiary of French concern Fimalac. The design=
ation has become the subject of intense debate. "The SEC has enveloped [the=
 agencies] in a very protective webbing that keeps anyone else from challen=
ging them," says Lawrence White, an economics professor at NYU. "There they=
 are, a 2 1/2-firm industry, sitting pretty." But no one has a better idea.=
 Says Rick Roberts, a former SEC commissioner who is now an attorney at The=
len Reid & Priest: "It's a very uncomfortable situation, but it's impractic=
al to take out what is already there."=20
There have been other complaints about the clout the agencies have- -Moody'=
s in particular. In the early 1990s allegations began to swirl that Moody's=
 bullied municipalities into hiring it by issuing unsolicited (and negative=
) ratings to those that declined the offer. One Colorado school district su=
ed the rater after it made negative comments about a pending bond sale, cla=
iming that investors used the pan to demand a higher interest rate, resulti=
ng in a net loss of $769,000. The court ruled that Moody's ratings were opi=
nions, not facts--and therefore the company was protected under the First A=
mendment.=20
But that hardly settles the broader issue: In the capital markets the ratin=
gs can function as facts even if they aren't. That's because of the numerou=
s regulations that are built around them. The Continental Divide is between=
 investment-grade securities and non- investment-grade securities, because =
many investors, like pension funds and insurance companies, are permitted t=
o own only a certain quantity of lower-quality bonds. And many money market=
 funds are allowed to have just 5% of their assets in commercial paper that=
 doesn't carry a top rating. So when Moody's and S&P downgraded Ford Motor'=
s debt in October, Gary Zeltzer, head of investment-grade fixed income at J=
.W. Seligman, had no choice but to sell. (While Ford's debt sold off on the=
 downgrade, it now trades at a better price than it did before.)=20
And that brings us back to the Enron question: How much should credit ratin=
gs anticipate the verdict of the stock market? O'Neill insists that his fir=
m cannot afford to rush to judgment; it doesn't bother him at all, he says,=
 if a bond trades at a different level than its rating implies: "The market=
 tends to be much more near-term focused. We need to be diligent and make s=
ure we do our work." Richard Waugh, an analyst at the Principal Financial G=
roup, agrees. "What [the agencies] do moves markets and affects the flow of=
 capital. So they have to make very sure that they're right, and they lean =
over backward to accomplish that."=20
But Moody's Rutherfurd has a different point of view. "If a credit is deter=
iorating, we want to be the first to spot it," he says. He jumps up to an e=
asel, looking very professorial, to talk about the "Merton model"--basicall=
y, a way of incorporating the judgment of the equity market into ratings. I=
n his view, that's important, because the equity market is forward-looking,=
 whereas accounting data are reflective of the past. "We think we're way ah=
ead of S&P in doing this," he boasts. Nor does Rutherfurd seem to bristle a=
t the recent criticism. "I hate the word 'optimal,' " he says. "But we do t=
he best we can, and we think it's pretty good."=20
That "pretty good" is likely to be as good as it gets--barring a few more E=
nron-caliber events, the credit-rating system isn't likely to change. As Fi=
rst Union analyst Asa Graves says of Moody's, "They would have to really sh=
oot themselves in the foot to lose serious market position."=20

"Our business is not a black box. It's very simple to model. People who rai=
se questions are people who have not gone through it in detail. We have exp=
licit answers, but people want to throw rocks at us."=20
So said Enron's then-CEO, Jeff Skilling, in an interview I had with him las=
t February. At the time--less than ten months ago, let's recall--Enron's ma=
rket capitalization was around $60 billion, just a shade below its all-time=
 high, and its status as a Wall Street darling had not yet begun to crumble=
. I was working on a story that would ultimately raise questions about Enro=
n's valuation, and I'd called with what I considered fairly standard querie=
s in an effort to understand its nearly incomprehensible financial statemen=
ts. The response from Enron was anything but standard. Skilling quickly bec=
ame frustrated, said that the line of inquiry was "unethical," and hung up =
the phone. A short time later Enron spokesperson Mark Palmer called and off=
ered to come to FORTUNE's New York City office with then-CFO Andy Fastow an=
d investor-relations head Mark Koenig. "We want to make sure we've answered=
 your questions completely and accurately," he said.
Now, in the wake of Enron's stunning collapse, it looks as if the company's=
 critics didn't throw enough rocks. The world is clamoring for those "expli=
cit answers," but Skilling, long gone from Enron-- and avoiding the press o=
n the advice of his lawyers--is in no position to provide them. As for "com=
pletely and accurately," many would argue that the men running Enron never =
understood either concept. "One way to hide a log is to put it in the woods=
," says Michigan Democrat John Dingell, who is calling for a congressional =
investigation. "What we're looking at here is an example of superbly comple=
x financial reports. They didn't have to lie. All they had to do was to obf=
uscate it with sheer complexity--although they probably lied too."=20
Until recently Enron would kick and scream at the notion that its business =
or financial statements were complicated; its attitude, expressed with bare=
ly concealed disdain, was that anyone who couldn't understand its business =
just didn't "get it." Many Wall Street analysts who followed the company we=
re content to go along. Bulls, including David Fleischer of Goldman Sachs, =
admitted that they had to take the company's word on its numbers--but it wa=
sn't a problem, you see, because Enron delivered what the Street most cared=
 about: smoothly growing earnings. Of course, now that it's clear that thos=
e earnings weren't what they appeared, the new cliche is that Enron's busin=
ess was incredibly complicated--perhaps even too complicated for founder Ke=
n Lay to understand (something Lay has implied since retaking the CEO title=
 from Skilling last summer). Which leads to a basic question: Why were so m=
any people willing to believe in something that so few actually understood?=
=20
Of course, since the Enron collapse, there are other basic questions as wel=
l--questions for which there are still no adequate answers. Even today, wit=
h creditors wrangling over Enron's skeletal remains while the company tries=
 desperately to find a backer willing to keep its trading operations in bus=
iness, outsiders still don't know what went wrong. Neither do Enron's emplo=
yees, many of whom expressed complete shock as their world cratered. Was En=
ron's ultimate collapse caused by a crisis of confidence in an otherwise so=
lid company? Or were the sleazy financial dealings that precipitated that c=
risis--including mysterious off-balance-sheet partnerships run by Enron exe=
cutives--the company's method of covering up even deeper issues in an effor=
t to keep the stock price rising? And then there's the question that's been=
 swirling around the business community and in Enron's hometown of Houston:=
 Given the extent to which financial chicanery appears to have take place, =
is someone going to jail?=20
A CULTURE OF ARROGANCE=20
If you believe the old saying that "those whom the gods would destroy they =
first make proud," perhaps this saga isn't so surprising. "Arrogant" is the=
 word everyone uses to describe Enron. It was an attitude epitomized by the=
 banner in Enron's lobby: THE WORLD'S LEADING COMPANY. There was the compan=
y's powerful belief that older, stodgier competitors had no chance against =
the sleek, modern Enron juggernaut. "These big companies will topple over f=
rom their own weight," Skilling said last year, referring to old-economy be=
hemoths like Exxon Mobil. A few years ago at a conference of utility execut=
ives, "Skilling told all the folks he was going to eat their lunch," recall=
s Southern Co. executive Dwight Evans. ("People find that amusing today," a=
dds Evans.) Or how about Skilling's insistence last winter that the company=
's stock--then about $80 a share--should sell for $126 a share? Jim Alexand=
er, the former CFO of Enron Global Power & Pipelines, which was spun off in=
 1994, once worked at Drexel Burnham Lambert and sees similarities. "The co=
mmon theme is hubris, an overweening pride, which led people to believe the=
y can handle increasingly exotic risk without danger."=20
To be sure, for a long time it seemed as though Enron had much to be arroga=
nt about. The company, which Ken Lay helped create in 1985 from the merger =
of two gas pipelines, really was a pioneer in trading natural gas and elect=
ricity. It really did build new markets for the trading of, say, weather fu=
tures. For six years running, it was voted Most Innovative among FORTUNE's =
Most Admired Companies. Led by Skilling, who had joined the company in 1990=
 from consulting firm McKinsey (he succeeded Lay as CEO in February 2001), =
Enron operated under the belief that it could commoditize and monetize anyt=
hing, from electrons to advertising space. By the end of the decade, Enron,=
 which had once made its money from hard assets like pipelines, generated m=
ore than 80% of its earnings from a vaguer business known as "wholesale ene=
rgy operations and services." From 1998 to 2000, Enron's revenues shot from=
 $31 billion to more than $100 billion, making it the seventh-largest compa=
ny on the FORTUNE 500. And in early 2000, just as broadband was becoming a =
buzzword worth billions in market value, Enron announced plans to trade tha=
t too.=20
But that culture had a negative side beyond the inbred arrogance. Greed was=
 evident, even in the early days. "More than anywhere else, they talked abo=
ut how much money we would make," says someone who worked for Skilling. Com=
pensation plans often seemed oriented toward enriching executives rather th=
an generating profits for shareholders. For instance, in Enron's energy ser=
vices division, which managed the energy needs of large companies like Eli =
Lilly, executives were compensated based on a market valuation formula that=
 relied on internal estimates. As a result, says one former executive, ther=
e was pressure to, in effect, inflate the value of the contracts--even thou=
gh it had no impact on the actual cash that was generated.=20
Because Enron believed it was leading a revolution, it encouraged flouting =
the rules. There was constant gossip that this rule breaking extended to ex=
ecutives' personal lives--rumors of sexual high jinks in the executive rank=
s ran rampant. Enron also developed a reputation for ruthlessness, both ext=
ernal and internal. Skilling is usually credited with creating a system of =
forced rankings for employees, in which those rated in the bottom 20% would=
 leave the company. Thus, employees attempted to crush not just outsiders b=
ut each other. "Enron was built to maximize value by maximizing the individ=
ual parts," says an executive at a competing energy firm. Enron traders, he=
 adds, were afraid to go to the bathroom because the guy sitting next to th=
em might use information off their screen to trade against them. And becaus=
e delivering bad news had career-wrecking potential, problems got papered o=
ver--especially, says one former employee, in the trading operation. "Peopl=
e perpetuated this myth that there were never any mistakes. It was astoundi=
ng to me."=20
TRADING SECRETS=20
"We're not a trading company," said Fastow during that February visit. "We =
are not in the business of making money by speculating." He also pointed ou=
t that over the past five years, Enron had reported 20 straight quarters of=
 increasing income. "There's not a trading company in the world that has th=
at kind of consistency," he said. "That's the check at the end of the day."=
=20
In fact, it's next to impossible to find someone outside Enron who agrees w=
ith Fastow's contention. "They were not an energy company that used trading=
 as a part of their strategy, but a company that traded for trading's sake,=
" says Austin Ramzy, research director of Principal Capital Income Investor=
s. "Enron is dominated by pure trading," says one competitor. Indeed, Enron=
 had a reputation for taking more risk than other companies, especially in =
longer-term contracts, in which there is far less liquidity. "Enron swung f=
or the fences," says another trader. And it's no secret that among non- inv=
estment banks, Enron was an active and extremely aggressive player in compl=
ex financial instruments such as credit derivatives. Because Enron didn't h=
ave as strong a balance sheet as the investment banks that dominate that wo=
rld, it had to offer better prices to get business. "Funky" is a word that =
is used to describe its trades.=20
But there's an obvious explanation for why Enron didn't want to disclose th=
e extent to which it was a trading company. For Enron, it was all about the=
 price of the stock, and trading companies, with their inherently volatile =
earnings, simply aren't rewarded with rich valuations. Look at Goldman Sach=
s: One of the best trading outfits in the world, its stock rarely sells for=
 more than 20 times earnings, vs. the 70 or so multiple that Enron shares c=
ommanded at their peak. You'll never hear Goldman's management predicting t=
he precise amount it will earn next year--yet Enron's management predicted =
earnings practically to the penny. The odd mismatch between what Enron's ma=
nagement said and what others say isn't just an academic debate. The questi=
on goes to the heart of Enron's valuation, which was based on its ability t=
o generate predictable earnings.=20
Why didn't that disconnect seem to matter? Because like Enron's management,=
 investors cared only about the stock price too. And as long as Enron poste=
d the earnings it promised (and talked up big ideas like broadband), the st=
ock price was supposed to keep on rising- -as, indeed, it did for a while. =
Institutions like Janus, Fidelity, and Alliance Capital piled in. Of course=
, earnings growth isn't the entire explanation for Wall Street's attitude. =
There were also the enormous investment-banking fees Enron generated. Nor w=
as asking questions easy. Wall Streeters find it hard to admit that they do=
n't understand something. And Skilling was notoriously short with those who=
 didn't immediately concur with the Enron world-view. "If you didn't act li=
ke a light bulb came on pretty quick, Skilling would dismiss you," says one=
 portfolio manager. "They had Wall Street beaten into submission," he adds.=
=20
WHERE ARE THE PROFITS?=20
Although it's hard to pinpoint the exact moment the tide began to turn agai=
nst Enron, it's not hard to find the person who first said that the emperor=
 had no clothes. In early 2001, Jim Chanos, who runs Kynikos Associates, a =
highly regarded firm that specializes in short- selling, said publicly what=
 now seems obvious: No one could explain how Enron actually made money. Cha=
nos also pointed out that while Enron's business seemed to resemble nothing=
 so much as a hedge fund-- "a giant hedge fund sitting on top of a pipeline=
," in the memorable words of Doug Millett, Kynikos' chief operating officer=
--it simply didn't make very much money. Enron's operating margin had plung=
ed from around 5% in early 2000 to under 2% by early 2001, and its return o=
n invested capital hovered at 7%--a figure that does not include Enron's of=
f-balance-sheet debt, which, as we now know, was substantial. "I wouldn't p=
ut my money in a hedge fund earning a 7% return," scoffed Chanos, who also =
pointed out that Skilling was aggressively selling shares--hardly the behav=
ior of someone who believed his $80 stock was really worth $126.=20
Not only was Enron surprisingly unprofitable, but its cash flow from operat=
ions seemed to bear little relationship to reported earnings. Because much =
of Enron's business was booked on a "mark to market" basis, in which a comp=
any estimates the fair value of a contract and runs quarterly fluctuations =
through the income statement, reported earnings didn't correspond to the ac=
tual cash coming in the door. That isn't necessarily bad--as long as the ca=
sh shows up at some point. But over time Enron's operations seemed to consu=
me a lot of cash; on-balance-sheet debt climbed from $3.5 billion in 1996 t=
o $13 billion at last report.=20
Skilling and Fastow had a simple explanation for Enron's low returns. The "=
distorting factor," in Fastow's words, was Enron's huge investments in inte=
rnational pipelines and plants reaching from India to Brazil. Skilling told=
 analysts that Enron was shedding those underperforming old-line assets as =
quickly as it could and that the returns in Enron's newer businesses were m=
uch, much higher. It's undeniable that Enron did make a number of big, bad =
bets on overseas projects--in fact, India and Brazil are two good examples.=
 But in truth, no one on the outside (and few people inside Enron) can inde=
pendently measure how profitable--or more to the point, how consistently pr=
ofitable--Enron's trading operations really were. A former employee says th=
at Skilling and his circle refused to detail the return on capital that the=
 trading business generated, instead pointing to reported earnings, just as=
 Fastow did. By the late 1990s much of Enron's asset portfolio had been lum=
ped in with its trading operations for reporting purposes. Chanos noted tha=
t Enron was selling those assets and booking them as recurring revenue. In =
addition, Enron took equity stakes in all kinds of companies and included r=
esults from those investments in the figures it reported.=20
Chanos was also the first person to pay attention to the infamous partnersh=
ips. In poring over Enron documents, he took note of an odd and opaque ment=
ion of transactions that Enron and other "Entities" had done with a "Relate=
d Party" that was run by "a senior officer of Enron." Not only was it impos=
sible to understand what that meant, but it also raised a conflict-of-inter=
est issue, given that an Enron senior executive--CFO Fastow, as it turns ou=
t--ran the "Related Party" entities. These, we now know, refer to the LJM p=
artnerships.=20
When it came to the "Related Party" transactions, Enron didn't even pretend=
 to be willing to answer questions. Back in February, Fastow (who at the ti=
me didn't admit his involvement) said that the details were "confidential" =
because Enron "didn't want information to get into the market." Then he exp=
lained that the partnerships were used for "unbundling and reassembling" th=
e various components of a contract. "We strip out price risk, we strip out =
interest rate risk, we strip out all the risks," he said. "What's left may =
not be something that we want." The obvious question is, Why would anyone e=
lse want whatever was left either? But perhaps that didn't matter, because =
the partnerships were supported with Enron stock--which, you remember, wasn=
't supposed to decline in value.=20
SKILLING SENDS A SIGNAL=20
By mid-August enough questions had been raised about Enron's credibility th=
at the stock had begun falling; it had dropped from $80 at the beginning of=
 the year to the low 40s. And then came what should have been the clearest =
signal yet of serious problems: Jeff Skilling's shocking announcement that =
he was leaving the company. Though Skilling never gave a plausible reason f=
or his departure, Enron dismissed any suggestion that his departure was rel=
ated to possible problems with the company. Now, however, there are those w=
ho speculate that Skilling knew the falling stock price would wreak havoc o=
n the partnerships--and cause their exposure. "He saw what was coming, and =
he didn't have the emotional fortitude to deal with it," says a former empl=
oyee.=20
What's astonishing is that even in the face of this dramatic--and largely i=
nexplicable--event, people were still willing to take Enron at its word. Ke=
n Lay, who stepped back into his former role as CEO, retained immense credi=
bility on Wall Street and with Enron's older employees, who gave him a stan=
ding ovation at a meeting announcing his return. He said there were no "acc=
ounting issues, trading issues, or reserve issues" at Enron, and people bel=
ieved him. Lay promised to restore Enron's credibility by improving its dis=
closure practices, which he finally admitted had been less than adequate.=
=20
Did Lay have any idea of what he was talking about? Or was he as clueless a=
s Enron's shareholders? Most people believe the latter. But even when Lay c=
learly did know an important piece of information, he seemed to be more inc=
lined to bury it, Enron-style, than to divulge it. After all, Enron's now i=
nfamous Oct. 16 press release--the one that really marked the beginning of =
the end, in which it announced a $618 million loss but failed to mention th=
at it had written down shareholders' equity by a stunning $1.2 billion--wen=
t out under Lay's watch. And Lay failed to mention a critical fact on the s=
ubsequent conference call: that Moody's was considering a downgrade of Enro=
n's debt. (Although Skilling said last February that Enron's off-balance- s=
heet debt was "non-recourse" to Enron, it turns out that that wasn't quite =
true either. Under certain circumstances, including a downgrade of Enron's =
on-balance-sheet debt below investment grade, Enron could be forced to repa=
y it.)=20
Indeed, facing a now nearly constant barrage of criticism, Enron seemed to =
retreat further and further from Lay's promises of full disclosure. The rat=
her vague reason that Enron first gave for that huge reduction in sharehold=
ers' equity was the "early termination" of the LJM partnerships. That was f=
ar from enough to satisfy investors, especially as the Wall Street Journal =
began to ferret out pieces of information related to the partnerships, incl=
uding the fact that Fastow had been paid millions for his role at the LJMs.=
 As recently as Oct. 23, Lay insisted that Enron had access to cash, that t=
he business was "performing very well," and that Fastow was a standup guy w=
ho was being unnecessarily smeared. The very next day Enron announced that =
Fastow would take a leave of absence.=20
We now know, of course, that Enron's dealings with its various related part=
ies had a huge impact on the earnings it reported. On Nov. 8, an eye-poppin=
g document told investors that Enron was restating its earnings for the pas=
t 4 3/4 years because "three unconsolidated entities should have been conso=
lidated in the financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounti=
ng principles." The restatement reduced earnings by almost $600 million, or=
 about 15%, and contained a warning that Enron could still find "additional=
 or different information."=20
And sophisticated investors who have scrutinized the list of selected trans=
actions between Enron and its various partnerships are still left with more=
 questions than answers. The speculation is that the partnerships were used=
 to even out Enron's earnings. Which leads to another set of questions: If =
Enron had ceased its game playing and come completely clean, would the comp=
any have survived? Or did Enron fail to come clean precisely because the re=
al story would have been even more scandalous?=20
THE LAST GASP=20
On the surface, the facts that led to Enron's Dec. 2 bankruptcy filing are =
quite straightforward. For a few weeks it looked as if Dynegy (which had lo=
ng prided itself on being the anti-Enron) would bail out its flailing rival=
 by injecting it with an immediate $1.5 billion in cash, secured by an opti=
on on Enron's key pipeline, Northern Natural Gas, and then purchasing all o=
f Enron for roughly $10 billion (not including debt). But by Nov. 28 the de=
al had fallen apart. On that day Standard & Poor's downgraded Enron's debt =
below investment grade, triggering the immediate repayment of almost $4 bil=
lion in off-balance-sheet debt--which Enron couldn't pay.=20
But even this denouement comes with its own set of plot twists. Both compan=
ies are suing each other: Enron claims that Dynegy wrongfully terminated th=
e deal, "consistently took advantage of Enron's precarious state to further=
 its own business goals," and as a result has no right to Enron's Northern =
Natural pipeline. Dynegy calls Enron's suit "one more example of Enron's fa=
ilure to take responsibility for its demise." No one can predict how the su=
its will pan out, but one irony is clear: Enron, that new-economy superstar=
, is battling to hang on to its very old-economy pipeline.=20
To hear Dynegy tell it, a central rationale for abandoning the deal was wha=
t might be called the mystery of the missing cash. General counsel Ken Rand=
olph says that Dynegy expected Enron to have some $3 billion in cash--but a=
n Enron filing revealed just over $1 billion. "We went back to Enron and we=
 asked, 'Where did the cash go? Where did the cash go?' " says CEO Chuck Wa=
tson. "Perhaps their core business was not as strong as they had led us to =
believe," speculates Randolph. Dynegy also claims that Enron tried to keep =
secrets to the last. Enron's lack of cash was revealed to the world in a fi=
ling on the afternoon of Monday, Nov. 19. Watson says he got the document o=
nly a few hours earlier--but that Lay had a copy on Friday. "I was not happ=
y," says Watson. "It's not good form to surprise your partner."=20
Sagas like this one inevitably wind up in the courts--and Enron's is no exc=
eption. Given that credit-rating agency Fitch estimates that even senior un=
secured-debt holders will get only 20% to 40% of their money back, the batt=
les among Enron's various creditors are likely to be fierce. Nor has Enron =
itself conceded yet. The company's biggest lenders, J.P. Morgan Chase and C=
itigroup, have extended $1.5 billion of "debtor in possession" financing to=
 Enron, which will enable it to continue to operate at least for a while. A=
nd Enron is still searching for a bank that will back it in restarting its =
trading business.=20
In the meantime, the courts will also be trying to answer a key question: W=
ho should pay? Enron's Chapter 11 filing automatically freezes all suits ag=
ainst the company itself while the bankruptcy is resolved. But while Enron =
may seek the same protection for its executives, lawyers predict that the a=
ttempt will fail and that the individuals will have to fend off a raft of s=
uits. Some think that criminal charges are a possibility for former executi=
ves like Skilling and Fastow. But such cases require proof of "knowing, wil=
lful, intentional misconduct," says well-known defense attorney Ira Sorkin.=
 And a criminal case requires a much higher standard of proof than a civil =
case: proof beyond a reasonable doubt rather than a preponderance of the ev=
idence. That's a high bar, especially since Enron executives will probably =
claim that they had Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen, approving their every=
 move. With Enron in bankruptcy, Arthur Andersen is now the deepest availab=
le pocket, and the shareholder suits are already piling up.=20
In any conversation about Enron, the comparison with Long-Term Capital Mana=
gement invariably crops up. In some ways, it looks as if the cost of the En=
ron debacle is far less than that of LTCM--far less than anyone would have =
thought possible, in fact (see next story). But in other ways the cost is f=
ar greater. Enron was a public company with employees and shareholders who =
counted on management, the board, and the auditors to protect them. That's =
why one senior Wall Streeter says of the Enron saga, "It disgusts me, and i=
t frightens me." And that's why, regardless of how the litigation plays out=
, it feels as though a crime has been committed.=20

Features/The Recovery
Will The Economy Get Well Soon? ; The Fed has been slashing rates with a ve=
ngeance, but a credit squeeze could really hurt the recovery.

When it comes to recessions, economists believe in a simple rule of thumb: =
Pump money and credit into an ailing economy, and before long you have a re=
covery. The bigger the injection, the stronger the rebound. So between Alan=
 Greenspan's yearlong campaign to slash interest rates and the government's=
 latest stimulus package, totaling $75 billion, we should get one mind-blow=
ing recovery, right? After all, the last time we pumped so much money into =
the economy was in the early 1960s, and things turned out pretty groovy bac=
k then.=20
Unfortunately, it may not be so simple this time. Eight months into this re=
cession, consumers are still buying big-ticket items like cars and homes. W=
hile that has kept the economy from totally tanking, it leaves little pent-=
up consumer demand to drive a fast recovery. So it's all up to corporate Am=
erica--which, you'll recall, got us into this mess in the first place. As M=
ark Zandi, chief economist of Economy.com, puts it, "The difference between=
 a strong recovery and a disappointing one will depend on business investme=
nt."
And on that score, there's cause for concern, if not outright agita. Most w=
orrying are early signs of a credit squeeze as banks tighten up on corporat=
e lending. If that continues, the recovery may not be right around the corn=
er, as many economists are now predicting- -or if it is, it won't feel like=
 much of one. Here's what's going on.=20
Since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, many banks have turned hypercautio=
us. According to the Federal Reserve's survey of senior loan officers, the =
most comprehensive picture of banks' willingness to lend, 51% of domestic b=
anks restricted their lending in October, up from 40% in August. Foreign ba=
nks became just as wary, and the tougher credit conditions are affecting fi=
rms of all sizes across the country. "We've become more conservative in our=
 lending," admits George Andrews, president of Capitol City Bank & Trust in=
 Atlanta. "We're turning down customers we would have lent to a year ago."=
=20
Banks are making it tougher for business to borrow in other ways too. Accor=
ding to the same Fed survey, more than half of domestic banks in October ra=
ised the rate they charge on riskier corporate loans. At the same time, a g=
rowing number of banks have imposed more stringent loan covenants and colla=
teral requirements on large and medium-sized companies. All this took place=
 even as the Fed was slashing short-term interest rates to stimulate busine=
ss investment. Indeed, as we'll see later, what should be one of the best t=
imes ever to borrow money isn't turning out that way at all for most compan=
ies. There's one notable exception--large, well-known firms have taken adva=
ntage of a bonanza in the corporate bond market--yet here, too, that borrow=
ing window seems to be closing as the market for commercial paper, for exam=
ple, has dried up.=20
So what's making banks so jittery? Blame Osama. Jay Sidhu, CEO of Sovereign=
 Bank in Pennsylvania, says Sept. 11 introduced a lot more uncertainty for =
corporate earnings, leading banks to worry about the quality of loans. "Sud=
denly a firm that expected sales of X was not going to achieve that, and it=
 made us more cautious," he explains. "I think the majority of banks reacte=
d in the same way." Now Sidhu is looking for tangible improvement in the ec=
onomy before he's willing to lend freely. In particular, he's closely watch=
ing consumer confidence, employment, and investment in technology for signs=
 of a sustained rebound.=20
Once Sidhu becomes less squeamish, other bankers probably won't be far behi=
nd. "Bankers are herdlike in their behavior," says Zandi. "They've trained =
in the same way, go to the same conferences, and talk to one another, so wh=
en one bank makes a change, the others follow." The trouble is, even when b=
anks become more optimistic, there's a lag effect before easier credit bene=
fits the economy. Researchers at the New York Fed have found that it can ta=
ke at least three months from the time banks increase the availability of c=
redit to when firms spend the funds.=20
So how bad could it get? Think back to the last time banks lost their nerve=
--the early 1990s. Although it's hard to remember anything negative happeni=
ng at all during the 1990s nirvana, we did experience a full-blown credit c=
runch at the start of the decade. That's the reason the recovery from the 1=
990-91 recession felt so lackluster. In fact, the media dubbed it the "jobl=
ess recovery" because firms simply couldn't get the funds they needed from =
banks to expand operations and hire more staff. At the time, remember, bank=
s were saddled with bad loans following a commercial property bust. Happily=
, that's not the case today. "Right now we don't have anything like the rea=
l estate crisis of the late '80s," says Richard Berner, Morgan Stanley's ch=
ief U.S. economist. "It's not about a problem with capital but with confide=
nce." Still, another corporate collapse a la Enron, and banks might find th=
eir capital base isn't as strong as they thought. That's one of the things =
about economic slumps. Loan quality can deteriorate virtually overnight.=20
While we may well avoid a Grade A credit crunch this recession, it's clear =
we won't return to the days of easy money that financed the boom of the '90=
s anytime soon. The main reason is that the conditions for business investm=
ent aren't nearly as ideal as they were in the 1990s. As the recovery got u=
nder way back then, Washington was reducing the federal budget deficit, whi=
ch brought long-term interest rates down steadily. Today we face the opposi=
te situation. The surplus has vanished, and the prospect of mounting defici=
ts is fast becoming reality. That's one reason long-term interest rates hav=
e hardly budged this year although official short- term rates plunged from =
6.5% to 2%. Since Greenspan started cutting rates in January, 30-year bond =
yields have edged down from 5.5% to a mere 5.35%, and ten-year yields went =
from 5.31% to 5%.=20
While the talk on Wall Street is all about recovery, with markets staging a=
 dramatic rally since their post-Sept. 11 lows, the business environment re=
mains grim--profit margins are at 19-year lows, there's excess capacity at =
every turn, and aggressive price discounting is rampant. Not exactly the be=
st combination to encourage firms to invest now, is it? And that's reflecte=
d in the latest figures, which show that the steep decline in business inve=
stment that began a year ago is continuing today. Real business spending on=
 plant and equipment dropped 11.9% in the third quarter, and new orders for=
 capital goods in November suggest a further sharp drop for the fourth quar=
ter. "Both leading indicators and current conditions point to further decli=
nes in capital spending," says Prudential economist Richard Rippe. "We're e=
xpecting next year to be just as weak on an annual basis."=20
So are we looking at a replay of the jobless recovery? One discouraging sig=
n: The unemployment rate climbed to 5.7% in November, up from 5.4% the prev=
ious month. But that doesn't mean all is lost. After all, the anemic recove=
ry at the start of the 1990s was followed by some pretty good times.=20

Enron Fallout: Wide, But Not Deep ; Enron's collapse has hurt big American =
banks. But not as much as a default by Argentina would.

In a bland suburban office park 30 minutes north of Atlanta, life after Enr=
on is taking shape. It's a show of creative destruction that would make phi=
losopher Joseph Schumpeter proud. Only a few months ago, the Intercontinent=
al Exchange (ICE) was battling Enron for a slice of the online energy marke=
t. Now ICE and its CEO, Jeff Sprecher, are struggling to handle a flood of =
new business, as former Enron clients search for other ways to trade electr=
icity and natural gas. Sprecher has airlifted in servers from around the co=
untry; his tech team is working 24/7 to accommodate trading volume of $2.5 =
billion a day--a 100% increase in two weeks. ICE's volumes climbed steadily=
 all through November, as Enron's customers ebbed away. But now, says Sprec=
her, "by any measure, our business is going through the roof. Enron opened =
the door, and I walked through."=20
ICE's success at profiting from Enron's failure illustrates just how quickl=
y the market has moved to absorb the demise of America's seventh-largest co=
rporation. It's not that people aren't hurting: Thousands of Enron workers =
are unemployed, and investors face billions of dollars in losses. Still, no=
t a single light flickered after Enron's implosion, which had almost no imp=
act on volatile energy prices. "It's like a great ship going down--there's =
a big splash, but the sea quickly fills in," says John Rowe, co-CEO of Exel=
on, the nation's ninth-largest utility. "The short-term effect is really no=
t that substantial."
Among energy companies that traded with Enron, potential losses range from =
$100 million for Duke to $80 million for Mirant and $75 million for Dynegy.=
 Among banks, J.P. Morgan Chase recently announced that it had $500 million=
 in unsecured loan and derivative exposure to Enron; analysts say Citigroup=
 could face a similar loss. Those numbers sound large, but they're unlikely=
 to cause more than a crimp in earnings. "The fallout is a mile wide and an=
 inch deep," says Jim Hanbury, a bank analyst with Dresdner Kleinwort Wasse=
rstein. "One of the very good things about being a big company is that when=
 bad things happen, it doesn't kill you." Indeed, the potential default of =
Argentina--a story pushed off the front pages by Enron--could actually pose=
 a more serious threat to America's money-center banks.=20
Large banks are further cushioned from Enron's failure because of the way l=
oans are syndicated. "Literally thousands of institutions get a piece," say=
s Hanbury--from smaller banks and Wall Street firms to insurance companies =
and hedge funds. That dilutes the impact of any one failure. Goldman Sachs'=
 Richard Strauss says Enron's collapse could trim Citigroup's earnings by f=
ive cents a share, but he still expects Citi to earn $3.25 a share in 2002.=
 He predicts J.P. Morgan will take a slightly bigger hit--15 cents a share-=
-equivalent to a 4% reduction in earnings next year. Strauss is similarly s=
anguine about the impact on Wall Street. "Wall Street has had time to react=
, so I think the exposure of major firms is pretty minimal," he says. "Unli=
ke Long-Term Capital's collapse or Russia's failure in 1998, people had a c=
hance to unwind their trading positions this time."=20
The fallout is likely to be felt most keenly within the energy industry its=
elf, especially among companies that, like Enron, had moved aggressively to=
 profit from trading and marketing electricity and natural gas. On Wall Str=
eet and in the boardrooms of energy towns like Houston and Atlanta, there's=
 a fierce debate over whether Enron's flaws were unique. The major survivin=
g energy traders-- including American Electric Power, Duke, Dynegy, Mirant,=
 and Reliant- -argue that unlike Enron, they possess major physical assets =
like power plants and storage facilities that balance the risks inherent in=
 trading.=20
Ironically, just a year ago those companies emphasized their trading prowes=
s; today the spin is that trading is merely a way to maximize the value of =
hard assets. "Our business model is fundamentally different from Enron's," =
says Dynegy President Steve Bergstrom. "We don't do nearly the volume of tr=
ading Enron did, and we also produce power and control natural gas. Enron h=
ad gotten out of the energy business and was essentially a financial servic=
es company that happened to make markets in electricity and natural gas." E=
ven so, Dynegy faces more risk than its competitors. For starters, says CSF=
B analyst Curt Launer, Dynegy derives more of its earnings and cash flow fr=
om marketing and trading than do companies that are more akin to traditiona=
l utilities. In addition, Enron is suing Dynegy for $10 billion as a result=
 of the failed merger. Although the suit has little chance of succeeding, a=
ny adverse legal decisions would immediately push Dynegy's stock price down=
. On the other hand, says Launer, Dynegy's shares have more upside potentia=
l if and when the energy sector comes back into favor.=20
Mirant's CFO Ray Hill is especially eager to put some daylight between his =
company and Enron. "We have $22 billion in assets and 15,000 megawatts of g=
enerating power across the country," he says. "One wall of our trading floo=
r shows the status of every plant, and almost all our trading is driven by =
our own assets. So if I sell power forward six months or a year, I can prod=
uce it if I need to." In addition, says Hill, Mirant's internal controls ba=
r traders from putting more than $75 million of capital at risk each day. T=
hat's a small fraction of Mirant's shareholder equity, currently $4.7 billi=
on, or its annual profits, projected to be nearly $700 million in 2001. "At=
 the end of every day, the CEO and I both get a report showing exactly how =
much capital is at risk," Hill says.=20
Still, executives from Mirant and other companies are taking great pains to=
 tell investors just how their businesses work. Last month Mirant CEO Marce=
 Fuller spent an hour and a half taking analysts in Atlanta and New York th=
rough each line of Mirant's balance sheet. "This isn't a topic that would h=
ave been included in an analysts' meeting in the past, but there's going to=
 be a lot more pressure on companies like ourselves to help people understa=
nd how we make money," says Fuller. Duke Energy's group president of energy=
 services, Harvey Padewer, agrees: "We've been very open with the Street. N=
o one ever considered Duke a black box."=20
It will be a while before energy trading companies--even those with substan=
tial assets--regain the trust they had before the Enron debacle. Fuller say=
s that while Mirant has already signed several profitable deals to sell gas=
 for former Enron clients, getting fresh capital to build new power plants =
or make acquisitions is much harder than it was six months ago. That has ca=
used Mirant to slow capital expenditures and delay some new investments. "T=
here's still a lot of nervousness that something else is out there," admits=
 Fuller. "Larger, sophisticated players with real assets like Mirant, Dyneg=
y, and Reliant will do just fine. But the capital markets think if Enron ca=

On the Cover
Power Player; Chuck Watson built Dynegy at blinding speed but was overshado=
wed by Enron. Now he's got the spotlight to himself.
Neil Weinberg and Daniel Fisher

Forbes Magazine=20

Copyright 2001 Forbes Inc.=20

On a cool day in Houston early last month, Dynegy chief Charles Watson anno=
unced the boldest deal of his career. In 15 years he had built the natural-=
gas producer into a powerhouse, but he chafed in the shadow of his far bigg=
er hometown rival, Enron Corp., and its chairman, the silver-tongued Kennet=
h Lay. Lay's swagger personified the freewheeling energy-trading markets, a=
nd Enron dominated the action, but now the titan was reeling from allegatio=
ns of dirty self-dealing, a raft of sudden resignations and an SEC investig=
ation. Valued at $70 billion only months before, Enron was teetering on the=
 brink of collapse.=20
So Chuck Watson declared he would rescue his rival, at an especially sweet =
price: just $9 billion in Dynegy stock. Watson was sure the skeptics on Enr=
on were wrong and that with a few problems solved Enron was still a rock-so=
lid money machine. Its revenue grew 57% in the third quarter to $47 billion=
--more than one and a half times what Dynegy generated in all of 2000. For =
a fire-sale price, he boasted, Dynegy would suddenly expand sixfold into a =
$200 billion-a-year giant with $90 billion in assets. The supercharged firm=
 would handle as much as one-quarter of U.S. energy trading. After operatin=
g in obscurity for years, Dynegy suddenly would become the second-largest c=
orporation in America in sales--"a world-class energy merchant by anyone's =
definition," Watson proclaimed.
Two weeks later Watson's triumph ended in epic failure. He scuttled his dre=
am deal after getting surprised by a string of horrifying financial revelat=
ions at Enron. The big rival's market cap had continued to plunge, falling =
to a level so low--less than $270 million--as to make Watson look like a su=
cker for ever offering $9 billion. Enron clearly was headed for Chapter 11,=
 or even liquidation. The merger was off, and the recriminations and lawsui=
ts were just beginning.=20
"I was very disappointed," Watson says in characteristic, laconic understat=
ement. He also was furious: Enron had tumbled into turmoil by misleading in=
vestors, and now it was misrepresenting its finances yet again--so says Wat=
son--and laying the blame on Dynegy. "I just hope the other side doesn't th=
ink all this spinning, which got them into trouble to begin with, is going =
to get them out of it," he fumes.=20
In the fallout, Enron struggles to stay alive, and Watson can count his ble=
ssings. In retreating, he has dodged Enron's $12 billion in debt, the dark =
cloud of the investigation now under way by the Securities & Exchange Commi=
ssion, the devastated trading floor and a thicket of lawsuits and liabiliti=
es so massive and murky that they could end up burying everyone in sight. I=
nstead, Watson is setting up the next chapter at Dynegy. He took it over in=
 1985 with a $600 investment and a 10% stake for himself, building it into =
a firm with a $10 billion market value (as of Nov. 30). With 5% now he's wo=
rth half a billion.=20
Watson vows to make Dynegy even bigger, even better, and an undisputed lead=
er in a gun-shy industry that has lost the stability and swagger of its onc=
e-dominant progenitor, Enron. Dynegy says it can grow at least 20% next yea=
r, to $35 billion in revenue.=20
The death of Enron is a mixed blessing for Chuck Watson. Some of Enron's bu=
siness and some of its brightest people will wind up at his firm; if he get=
s his way in court Watson will also get Enron's valuable pipeline system, N=
orthern Natural Gas, in return for the $1.5 billion he poured into Enron in=
 the course of the merger plans. The negative: litigation. Enron is threate=
ning to sue Dynegy for backing out of the merger, and Enron's creditors are=
 sure to pile on at some point.=20
Even without swallowing the bigger Enron, Dynegy is a leading processor of =
natural gas and one of the top three transporters on every interstate pipel=
ine in North America. Its power plants generate 19,000 megawatts of electri=
city, enough for a city of 8 million. In the commodity derivatives markets,=
 where suppliers and utilities lock in future prices, Dynegy is a top trade=
r in natural gas, power, coal, emission credits and weather derivatives. Bu=
t these volatile trading businesses, which contributed 80% of Enron's alleg=
ed earnings but ultimately could not make up for its blunders elsewhere, ar=
e merely a healthy sideline at Dynegy, contributing only 20% of earnings.=
=20
And Watson may yet have a multibillion-dollar merger in his future. Big riv=
als such as American Electric Power, Duke Energy and Reliant outmuscle Dyne=
gy in some markets, making them attractive partners. He expresses keen inte=
rest in doing more deals, having made nine acquisitions since 1995, which h=
as kept Dynegy's top line growing a hefty 45% a year. Last year its stock j=
umped 218%, the second-best performance in the S&P 500. Even on the day Wat=
son bailed out of buying Enron, he inked a $600 million purchase of another=
 outfit, BG Storage. He's a gambler whose winning streak might not have end=
ed.=20
Enron and Dynegy were born the same year--1985--but took very different pat=
hs. Ken Lay started out with $10 billion in revenues from the merger of two=
 energy companies, Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth. Then he won fame and=
 accolades for transforming a stodgy old gas business into a sexy wheeler-d=
ealer, doing for energy what Nasdaq did for stocks: creating a highly liqui=
d, over-the-counter market for all kinds of contracts. In the process, he s=
lapped Enron's name on a new sports stadium and hobnobbed with the likes of=
 Dick Cheney and George W. Bush.=20
Chuck Watson started out with far less. Dynegy began life under the unpromi=
sing name of the U.S. Natural Gas Clearinghouse, a marketing arm jointly ow=
ned by six pipeline companies, Morgan Stanley and the law firm Akin Gump. N=
or was Watson some headhunter's superstar: He began his career as a lowly t=
rainee at Conoco. Even after Dynegy hit the big leagues, Watson's aw-shucks=
 manner kept him out of the public eye; he frequently says he'd rather let =
his customers talk up Dynegy than do it himself. Flashy, no, but competitiv=
e, hell yes: He is so fierce a warrior on the links that when he was recove=
ring from an Achilles tendon injury recently, he borrowed an oversize golf =
shoe to fit it over his sore, swollen foot rather than miss combat in 18 ho=
les.=20
Always scrappy and still athletic at 51, Watson was born in Great Lakes, Il=
l., one of four children of a salesman who hawked space in industrial parks=
. The family moved around a lot and Watson attended 22 schools in nine stat=
es. Sports let him fit in quickly. He was driving for a college basketball =
scholarship until he seriously injured his back in a car wreck as a high sc=
hool senior in Ft. Smith, Ark. On graduating from Oklahoma State in 1972, h=
e took a job with Conoco in Ponca City, Okla. so he could stay close to his=
 college sweetheart, Kim, who now has been married to him for 28 years. The=
 summer job turned full-time, and in the next 12 years Watson worked his wa=
y up at Conoco to the middling title of sales director.=20
It was 1984, natural gas was on the verge of revolution, and Watson wanted =
to be in the vanguard. "A lot of people in this business were scared by der=
egulation," he recalls. "I was excited by the opportunities." Opportunity a=
rrived in the form of the slapped-together U.S. Natural Gas Clearinghouse.=
=20
Watson first turned down the job. It looked unworkable. The pipeline compan=
ies might try to force the fledgling firm to do business only with their ow=
n pipelines; how would he push them aside? His suitors kept wooing him, off=
ering a sizable raise, and finally Watson relented, with one condition: "Do=
n't pay me a salary--give me 10% of the company." He got both, the equity i=
nitially taking the form of phantom stock--in effect, a long-term option.=
=20
On Watson's first day on the job, only 6 of the 60 employees borrowed from =
the parent firms showed up. He told the no-shows not to come back. Later th=
at year he bought out the 10% stakes from the pipelines for $100 each and t=
hen he got Akin Gump to sell, leaving Morgan as sole shareholder. His visio=
n was clear from day one. Hundreds of brokers were jumping in, many armed w=
ith just a phone and a Rolodex. Competing with them was a losing game. Supp=
liers and buyers would eventually get each other's phone numbers, and one d=
ay the fat middleman spreads that Watson's shop relied on would evaporate. =
Then what?=20
With the backing of Morgan Stanley and a surfeit of underground salt domes =
for gas storage, Watson figured he could buy gas at wellheads and deliver i=
t when and where customers wanted, holding it for them when they didn't nee=
d it and serving it up when demand surged. This meant Watson would assume t=
he risk of holding gas that might tumble in price; but any trader could han=
dle that risk with some artful hedges.=20
The startup was barely making payroll when Watson arrived, turning a sale a=
 week and celebrating each with a round of cigars. Watson nixed the cigars =
and started turning multiple sales a day. He worked his contacts and had st=
aff cold-calling corporate gas users to drum up business.=20
By 1989 Morgan Stanley wanted out and sold the company for $16 million. The=
 buyers were three energy companies (British Gas, Nova and Chevron) and emp=
loyees. Morgan was happy with its tidy profit. Had it held on, its stake wo=
uld be worth $10 billion.=20
Meanwhile Ken Lay at Enron was discovering the same potential in gas tradin=
g. Deregulation had left producers and utilities at the mercy of volatile s=
pot prices. Lay began writing long-term contracts to buy or sell gas at fix=
ed prices. Business grew more stable at both ends of the pipeline. Eventual=
ly the raw trading of these contracts--rather than delivering on them--beca=
me Enron's mainstay.=20
In the mid-1990s electricity joined gas on the deregulatory path. Watson wa=
nted in but needed currency. So in 1995 he bought Trident, a publicly held =
ethylene producer; the reverse merger gave him new access to money in the c=
apital markets. The following fall, Watson cut a deal with Chevron to sell =
the oil giant's entire North American gas output, the first such exclusive =
marketing deal. It was precisely what Watson had in mind all along. The gas=
 producer receives market prices at its wells. Watson takes ownership, tran=
sports, stores and delivers the energy at a markup. He compares the approac=
h to that of grain trader Cargill.=20
Business was booming, but Watson wanted to buy a lot more gas processing pl=
ants and electric power plants. The problem was in raising the cash. Dynegy=
 had a public currency, but 88% was now in the hands of employees and three=
 institutions. There wasn't enough of a float to attract institutional shar=
eholders. So Watson walked into a meeting of his owners in Scotland in 1997=
 with a blunt message: "We have a problem. It's in this room. Two of you ha=
ve to go. I don't care which." Then he walked out. Nova and British Gas exi=
ted. The company's float went to 60% overnight. The next year Watson change=
d Natural Gas Clearinghouse's name to Dynegy, excising an "r" to dodge a pr=
eexisting British claim. Then he used his stock to make his boldest push ye=
t into power. Illinova, an Illinois generating firm, was nearly insolvent. =
Watson bought it for a pittance.=20
Enron was having a field day with deregulation, too. Instead of buying elec=
tricity from a plant and selling it elsewhere for a tiny cut, it began carv=
ing output into pieces, much as Wall Street slices Treasurys into Treasury =
strips. Enron would guarantee a utility running a distribution grid all the=
 power it would need on a hot summer afternoon. An aluminum smelter would p=
ay half as much but suffer some interruptions.=20
As Enron's confidence grew, its trades got more exotic, involving derivativ=
es on pulp, metals, pollution and the weather. In late 1999 the firm shifte=
d much of its business to EnronOnline, basking in the dot-com craze. The si=
te soon was handling $3 billion in trades daily. Revenues in 2000 doubled t=
o $101 billion. Reported earnings before interest and taxes hit $2.3 billio=
n. At a January 2001 analyst meeting, company execs suggested Enron's price=
 of $80 a share was inadequate, notwithstanding that it was 46 times earnin=
gs. The shares should have been going for $126, said President Jeffrey Skil=
ling.=20
By then Enron and Dynegy had gone separate ways. Enron was selling assets, =
earning 80% of its profits from trading and 20% from energy. At Dynegy the =
ratios were reversed. In February Lay handed the top job to Skilling, chief=
 advocate of Enron's asset-lite strategy. Lay became elder statesman.=20
Skilling epitomized Enron's hubris. He had once said of a rival, "If Thomas=
 Alva Edison came back from the dead and called Southern Co. he'd find noth=
ing has changed." Of Enron: "We're on the side of angels. People want open,=
 competitive markets .... It's the American way." To goose earnings, Skilli=
ng set up outside partnerships. They, in turn, issued Enron-backed bonds an=
d used the proceeds to buy power plants, fiber optics and other assets from=
 Enron. Then Enron plowed the cash into its trading business while the debt=
--and losses--moved off its books.=20
The questions started getting prickly when Enron's stock price fell in the =
spring. Its business of trading fiber-optic capacity, with revenues of more=
 than $300 million in 2000, lost $137 million in the first half of 2001 as =
sales plunged. In mid-August Skilling abruptly quit. Speculation was that s=
omething was seriously amiss. Then on Oct. 16 Enron set a $1 billion third-=
quarter charge related to a partnership linked to Chief Financial Officer A=
ndrew Fastow, plus a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity due to "a=
ccounting errors." Rumors were rampant that trading partners were avoiding =
Enron and that it was on the brink of a credit downgrade that would force i=
t to immediately repay $3.9 billion in debt, pushing it into bankruptcy.=20
On Oct. 25, Dynegy President Stephen Bergstrom was invited to lunch by Stan=
ley Horton, chief of Enron's pipeline group. Horton--without first telling =
Ken Lay of his plans--told Bergstrom that Enron was in deep trouble and tha=
t a merger with Dynegy was the best way out. But it had to happen fast.=20
Enron's desperate plea in hand, Bergstrom called Watson, who was outside an=
 operating room in St. Louis where his mother was having heart surgery. "I =
was intrigued and honored they had come to us," Watson recalls. He set one =
demand: Ken Lay had to call him personally. Lay called him the next day, an=
d on Saturday morning Watson and Lay chewed over a deal in Lay's kitchen. W=
atson offered a deal with no premium over Enron's depressed price. Lay acce=
pted and said he would step aside.=20
Dynegy was an obvious mate. The firms are right across the street from each=
 other, and many employees have worked at both. Their traders live in the s=
ame neighborhoods--the Young Turks in West University and the superstars in=
 River Oaks. They send their kids to ritzy St. John's School. "The press lo=
ves the rivalry between Enron and Dynegy, but on a lot of issues, we're on =
the same page," Bergstrom says.=20
For Dynegy, Enron's crunch was sweet revenge. Dynegy execs chafed at the th=
e dowdy image they were accorded despite fast growth and a soaring stock. L=
ay put Enron's name on Houston's new baseball stadium. Watson bragged about=
 his small p.r. staff. A media search yields 91,000 mentions of Enron in fi=
ve years--six times as many as for Dynegy.=20
For all their folksiness, Dynegy execs were talking trash about Enron for y=
ears. Off the record, they questioned Enron's assertions it held "balanced =
books" of commitments to buy and sell commodities and suggested their rival=
 was laying risky bets on the direction of gas and electricity prices.=20
Investment bankers came in to do the paperwork. Dynegy merger chief Hugh Ta=
rpley, an alum of Notre Dame, coined the de rigeur code names: Dynegy was t=
he heroic Rockne; Enron, fittingly, was the Gipper--the dying football play=
er. Watson, meanwhile, was hosting a week-long pro-am golf tournament for 3=
00 clients, one of his first forays into big-time promotion. Some events he=
 couldn't miss, like a round of golf with Tiger Woods. When guests asked wh=
ere he was, underlings made excuses. On the last day of the tournament, som=
eone noticed Watson heading toward the course in a golf cart wearing busine=
ss shoes, a clue that he was headed for merger talks; he feigned forgetfuln=
ess.=20
Chief Financial Officer Robert Doty, meanwhile, was poring over Enron's fin=
ancials and feeling fine. "We got a lot of comfort that the core business w=
as operating well and capable of generating great cash flow," Doty recalls.=
 But ChevronTexaco, which owns 26% of Dynegy, scrutinized the deal and aske=
d--why not wait for Enron to fall into bankruptcy and buy it at a distress =
sale? In the end Chevron put $1.5 billion into Dynegy, which used it to buy=
 100% of the preferred stock in the Enron unit that owns its prized Norther=
n Natural Gas pipeline. That, along with $1 billion more at the merger's cl=
ose, was expected to give Enron the liquidity it needed.=20
Watson unveiled his daring rescue plan on Friday, Nov. 9, reserving the rig=
ht to call off the deal if Enron's liabilities rose, or profits fell, below=
 certain levels. His hole card: a clause stating Dynegy's $1.5 billion inve=
stment gave it the right to keep the big pipeline even if the deal was abor=
ted. "There was a lot we didn't know," he admits, "but we thought we'd adeq=
uately protected our shareholders." Dynegy's stock had a quick 28% run-up o=
n news of the bid.=20
If Skilling is to go down in history books for his hubris, Watson should ge=
t a mention, too. J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup offered to inject $500 mi=
llion or more in equity capital into Enron. Watson, confident that Enron's =
hemorrhaging was over, brushed aside the offer.=20
The euphoria faded fast. On Nov. 19 Enron filed quarterly financials that h=
eld two bombshells. Recent credit downgrades to a notch above junk had put =
Enron on the hook to repay $690 million to a partnership in just a week--so=
mething Enron had never warned Dynegy about. What's more, Enron had $1 bill=
ion less in cash on hand than it was supposed to have.=20
Watson was stunned. Enron had provided a peek at the numbers two weeks befo=
re, but none of this was disclosed (Enron has disputed this). Watson says t=
hat Dynegy got the full filing just three hours before it was made public a=
nd that only then did he know his deal was in trouble. What else had Enron =
failed to disclose? Negotiations went on even as Enron shares fell to $4 an=
d lower. On Nov. 28 three credit agencies downgraded Enron to junk status. =
That morning Watson called Lay and killed the deal. Lay was cordial.=20
The niceties ended there. Dynegy issued a press release staking its claim t=
o Northern Natural Gas and accusing Enron of misrepresentation. Enron's chi=
ef financial officer, Jeffrey McMahon, disputed that claim and said Dynegy =
saw the financials in advance, hinting Dynegy may owe Enron a $350 million =
breakup fee. Bunk, says Watson: "It's real cute for Jeff to say we got an a=
dvance copy when it was 110 pages we received just three hours in advance."=
=20
Even if Dynegy's biggest deal slipped through Watson's fingers there is a b=
ig world of opportunities in energy. In Europe, Dynegy has a growing presen=
ce and can play the same games it did in the U.S. as the energy industry th=
ere deregulates.=20
Back at home, Watson confronts months of legal wrangling and a long struggl=
e to reclaim legitimacy for the energy-trading business. The recent chaos i=
n California and the collapse of Enron will make further deregulation--and =
Dynegy's stock--a tough sale.=20

AFTERSHOCKS IN EUROPE Enron's collapse will hit many markets
By David Fairlamb in Paris

Enron Corp. may be based in Houston, but its spectacular collapse has had a=
lmost as big an impact in Europe as in the U.S. The energy trader's bankrup=
tcy has sent European banks, investors, electricity consumers, and champion=
s of Europewide energy deregulation reeling. And it's not just the energy m=
arkets that have been thrown into confusion. Enron was active in a number o=
f other European sectors, including metals and pulp and paper trading. It e=
ven owns a windmill manufacturer in Germany. ``This was a global company wh=
ose collapse will be felt right around the world,'' says Alessandro Profumo=
, CEO of UniCredito Italiano.=20
Profumo should know. Over the last year, the Milan bank loaned Enron an est=
imated $20 million. All told, European banks have admitted to lending Enron=
 and its subsidiaries more than $2 billion. In addition, analysts calculate=
, there is up to a billion dollars further exposure in the form of derivati=
ves and trading contracts.
The European bank reported to have the largest loan exposure to Enron--betw=
een $500 million and $800 million--is Royal Bank of Scotland. RBS executive=
s aren't talking, but their stock has taken a big hit. Other banks with siz=
able Enron loan exposure include Britain's Abbey National, France's Credit =
Lyonnais, and the Netherlands' ABN Amro (table). ``Enron isn't on the same =
scale as the Long-Term Credit Management collapse [in 1998],'' says Peter L=
uxton, global economic adviser to Standard & Poor's Corp., ``but it still h=
as a huge effect.''=20
In recent days, the scale of that financial damage has become clearer. The =
result could well be tighter credit for many companies just as Europe's eco=
nomy softens. Spreads in the corporate fixed income market widened by up to=
 40 basis points between Nov. 28 and Dec. 5. Adding to the pressure is the =
fear that there is more risk in the credit markets than was realized. ``We =
didn't know Enron, but lent on the back of its credit rating,'' says Profum=
o. As Enron sank, he adds, ``the first question I asked my colleagues was: =
`What is the value of a rating?''' Just a few months ago, the parent compan=
y had an AA rating from the main agencies. It's now rated as junk.=20
Banks aren't the only ones affected. Enron stock and bonds were widely held=
 by European mutual funds and insurers. The lucky ones offloaded their stak=
es as the extent of the company's problems started to come out. ``I knew I =
had to get out in August, when they canceled a meeting with me at the last =
minute--after I'd arrived in Houston,'' says a fund manager at a private Ge=
rman bank. He quickly dumped $50 million of Enron stock. Insurers that stil=
l held big blocks of Enron shares when it collapsed include Germany's Allia=
nz, France's AXA, and Holland's Aegon. Analysts estimate Aegon's exposure a=
t $200 million.=20
Meanwhile, Europe's spot and futures markets for electricity are in chaos. =
Enron was a big electricity supplier and trader in Europe, at the height of=
 its activity accounting for up to 20% of volume traded on the energy excha=
nges. Most energy and power companies already had wound down their exposure=
 to Enron by the time its collapse became imminent. But the scale of the co=
mpany's problems and the speed with which it collapsed have unsettled many =
traders. Not surprisingly, the price of energy futures is on the way up. Be=
cause Enron's aggressive pricing had helped bring down tariffs, businesses =
and domestic consumers will have to pay more for their energy this winter. =
Prices will probably rise fastest--up to 2.5%--in Britain's deregulated mar=
ket, say analysts. Enron was a particularly large player there, producing e=
lectricity and delivering it to 2.2 million retail consumers and thousands =
of companies.=20
Even more than in the U.S., Enron's woes are likely to increase resistance =
to energy deregulation. Although Germany and Britain have almost wholly lib=
eralized their markets, progress elsewhere, especially France, has been slo=
w. Opponents of reform will use the Enron debacle to hold up the process. `=
`They're going to make a real meal out of this in Paris,'' says a European =
Commission official in Brussels. This American bankruptcy is Europe's heada=
che.

THE FALL OF ENRON How ex-CEO Jeff Skilling's strategy grew so complex that =
even his boss couldn't get a handle on it

(Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)=20

To former Enron CEO Jeffrey K. Skilling, there were two kinds of people in =
the world: those who got it and those who didn't. ``It'' was Enron's comple=
x strategy for minting rich profits and returns from a trading and risk-man=
agement business built essentially on assets owned by others. Vertically in=
tegrated behemoths like ExxonMobil Corp., whose balance sheet was rich with=
 oil reserves, gas stations, and other assets, were dinosaurs to a contempt=
uous Skilling. ``In the old days, people worked for the assets,'' Skilling =
mused in an interview last January. ``We've turned it around--what we've sa=
id is the assets work for the people.''=20
But who looks like Tyrannosaurus Rex now? As Enron Corp. struggles to salva=
ge something from the nation's largest bankruptcy case, filed on Dec. 2, it=
's clear that the real Enron was a far cry from the nimble ``asset light'' =
market maker that Skilling proclaimed. And the financial maneuvering and of=
f-balance-sheet partnerships that he and ex-Chief Financial Officer Andrew =
S. Fastow perfected to remove everything from telecom fiber to water compan=
ies from Enron's debt-heavy balance sheet helped spark the company's implos=
ion. ``Jeff's theory was assets were bad, intellectual capital was good,'' =
says one former senior executive. Employees readily embraced the rhetoric, =
the executive says, but they ``didn't understand how it was funded.''
Neither did many others. Bankers, stock analysts, auditors, and Enron's own=
 board failed to comprehend the risks in this heavily leveraged trading gia=
nt. Enron's bankruptcy filings show $13.1 billion in debt for the parent co=
mpany and an additional $18.1 billion for affiliates. But that doesn't incl=
ude at least $20 billion more estimated to exist off the balance sheet. Ken=
neth L. Lay, 59, who had nurtured Skilling, 48, as his successor, sparked t=
he first wave of panic when he revealed in an Oct. 16 conference call with =
analysts that deals involving partnerships run by his CFO would knock $1.2 =
billion off shareholder equity. Lay, who had been out of day-to-day managem=
ent for years, was never able to clearly explain how the partnerships worke=
d or why anyone shouldn't assume the worst--that they were set up to hide E=
nron's problems, inflate earnings, and personally benefit the executives wh=
o managed some of them.=20
That uncertainty ultimately scuttled Enron's best hope for a rescue: its de=
al to be acquired by its smaller but healthier rival, Dynegy Inc. Now Enron=
 is frantically seeking a rock-solid banking partner to help maintain some =
shred of its once-mighty trading empire. Already, 4,000 Enron workers in Ho=
uston have lost their jobs. And hundreds of creditors, from banks to teleco=
ms to construction companies, are trying to recover part of the billions th=
ey're owed.=20
>From the beginning, Lay had a vision for Enron that went far beyond that of=
 a traditional energy company. When Lay formed Enron from the merger of two=
 pipeline companies in 1985, he understood that deregulation of the busines=
s would offer vast new opportunities. To exploit them, he turned to Skillin=
g, then a McKinsey & Co. consultant. Skilling was the chief nuts-and-bolts-=
operator from 1997 until his departure last summer, and the architect of an=
 increasingly byzantine financial structure. After he abruptly quit in Augu=
st, citing personal reasons, and his right-hand financier Fastow was ousted=
 Oct. 24, there was no one left to explain it.=20
Much of the blame for Enron's collapse has focused on the partnerships, but=
 the seeds of its destruction were planted well before the October surprise=
s. According to former insiders and other sources close to Enron, it was al=
ready on shaky financial ground from a slew of bad investments, including o=
verseas projects ranging from a water business in England to a power distri=
butor in Brazil. ``You make enough billion-dollar mistakes, and they add up=
,'' says one source close to Enron's top executives. In June, Standard & Po=
or's analysts put the company on notice that its underperforming internatio=
nal assets were of growing concern. But S&P, which like BusinessWeek is a u=
nit of The McGraw-Hill companies, ultimately reaffirmed the credit ratings,=
 based on Enron's apparent willingness to sell assets and take other steps.=
=20
Behind all the analyses of Enron was the assumption that the core energy bu=
siness was thriving. It was still growing rapidly, but margins were inevita=
bly coming down as the market matured. ``Once that growth slowed, any weakn=
ess would start becoming more apparent,'' says Standard & Poor's Corp. dire=
ctor Todd A. Shipman. ``They were not the best at watching their cost.'' In=
deed, the tight risk controls that seemed to work well in the trading busin=
ess apparently didn't apply to other parts of the company.=20
Skilling's answer to growing competition in energy trading was to push Enro=
n's innovative techniques into new arenas, everything from broadband to met=
als, steel, and even advertising time and space. Skilling knew he had to fi=
nd a way to finance his big growth plans and manage the international probl=
ems without killing the company's critical investment-grade credit rating. =
Without a clever solution, trading partners would flee, or the cost of doin=
g deals would become insurmountable. ``HE'S HEARTBROKEN.'' No one ever disp=
uted that Skilling was clever. The Pittsburgh-born son of a sales manager f=
or an Illinois valve company, he took over as production director at a star=
tup Aurora (Ill.) TV station at age 13 when an older staffer quit and he wa=
s the only one who knew how to operate the equipment. Skilling landed a ful=
l-tuition scholarship to Southern Methodist University in Dallas to study e=
ngineering, but quickly changed to business. After graduation, he went to w=
ork for a Houston bank. The bank later went bust while Skilling was at Harv=
ard Business School. Skilling said that fiasco made him determined to keep =
strict risk controls on Enron's trading business. He once told BusinessWeek=
 that ``I've never not been successful in business or work, ever.'' Skillin=
g now declines to comment, but his brother Tom, a Chicago TV weatherman, sa=
ys of him: ``He's heartbroken over what's going on there.... We were not ra=
ised to look on these kinds of things absent emotion.''=20
Enron's ``intellectual capital'' was Skilling's pride and joy. He recruited=
 more than 250 newly minted MBAs each year from the nation's top business s=
chools. Meteorologists and PhDs in math and economics helped analyze and mo=
del the vast amounts of data that Enron used in its trading operations. A f=
orced ranking system weeded out the poor performers. ``It was as competitiv=
e internally as it was externally,'' says one former executive.=20
It was no surprise then that Skilling would turn to a bright young finance =
wizard, Fastow, to help him find capital for his rapidly expanding empire. =
Boasting an MBA from Northwestern University, Fastow was recruited to Enron=
 in 1990 from Continental Bank, where he worked on leveraged buyouts. Artic=
ulate, handsome, and mature beyond his years, he became Enron's CFO at age =
36. In October, 1999, he earned CFO Magazine's CFO Excellence Award for Cap=
ital Structure Management. An effusive Skilling crowed to the magazine: ``W=
e didn't want someone stuck in the past, since the industry of yesterday is=
 no longer. Andy has the intelligence and the youthful exuberance to think =
in new ways.''=20
But Skilling's fondness for the buttoned-down Fastow was not widely shared.=
 Many colleagues considered him a prickly, even vindictive man, prone to at=
tacking those he didn't like in Enron's group performance reviews. Fastow, =
through his attorney, declined to comment for this story. When he formed an=
d took a personal stake in the LJM partnerships that blew up in October, th=
e conflict of interest inherent in those deals only added to his colleagues=
' distaste for him. Enron admits Fastow earned more than $30 million from t=
he partnerships. The Enron CFO wasn't any more popular on Wall Street, wher=
e investment bankers bristled at the finance group's ``we're smarter than y=
ou guys'' attitude. Indeed, that came back to haunt Enron when it needed ca=
pital commitments to stem the liquidity crisis. ``It's the sort of organiza=
tion about which people said, `Screw them. We don't really owe them anythin=
g,''' says one investment banker.=20
While LJM--and Fastow's direct personal involvement and enrichment--shocked=
 many, the deal was just the latest version of a financing strategy that Sk=
illing and Fastow had used to good effect many times since the mid-'90s to =
fund investments with private equity while keeping assets and debt off the =
balance sheet. Keeping the debt off Enron's books depended on a steady or r=
ising stock price and an investment- grade credit rating. ``They were put t=
ogether with good intentions to offset some risk,'' says S&P analyst Ron M.=
 Barone. ``It's conceivable that it got away from them.``=20
Did it ever. The off-balance-sheet structures grew increasingly complex and=
 risky, according to insiders and others who have studied the deals. Some, =
with names like Osprey, Whitewing, and Marlin, were revealed in Enron's fin=
ancial filings and even rated by the big credit-rating agencies. But almost=
 no one seemed to have a clear picture of Enron's total debt, what triggers=
 might hasten repayment, or how some of the deals could dilute shareholder =
equity. ``No one ever sat down and added up how many liabilities would come=
 due if this company got downgraded,'' says one lender involved with Enron.=
 Many investors were unaware of provisions in some deals that could essenti=
ally dump the debts back on Enron. In some cases, if Enron's stock fell bel=
ow a certain price and the credit rating dropped below investment grade--on=
ce unimaginable--nearly $4 billion in partnership debt would have to be cov=
ered by Enron. At the same time, the value of the assets in many of these p=
artnerships was dropping, making it even harder for Enron to cover the debt=
. HIGH HOPES. Skilling tried to accelerate the sale of international assets=
 after becoming chief operating officer in 1997, but the efforts were arduo=
us and time-consuming. Even as tech stocks melted down, Skilling was determ=
ined not to scale back his grandiose broadband trading dreams or the result=
ing price-to-earnings multiple of almost 60 that they helped create for Enr=
on's stock. At its peak in August, 2000, about a third of the stock's $90 p=
rice was attributable to expectations for growth of broadband trading, exec=
utives estimate.=20
That rapidly rising stock price--up 55% in '99 and 87% in 2000--gave Skilli=
ng and Fastow a hot currency for luring investors into their off-balance-sh=
eet deals. They quickly became dependent on such deals to finance their exp=
ansion efforts. ``It was like crack,'' says a company insider. Trouble is, =
Enron's stock came tumbling back to earth when market valuations fell this =
year. By April, its price had fallen to about 55. And its far-flung operati=
onal troubles were taking their own toll. In its much-hyped broadband busin=
ess, for instance, a capacity glut and financial meltdown made it hard to f=
ind creditworthy counterparties for trading. And after spending some $1.2 b=
illion to build and operate a fiber-optic network, Enron found itself with =
an asset whose value was rapidly deteriorating. Even last year, company exe=
cutives could see the need to cut back an operation that had 1,700 employee=
s and a cash burn rate of $700 million a year. ``SOMETHING TO PROVE.'' And =
the international problems weren't going away. Enron's 65% stake in the $3 =
billion Dabhol power plant in India was mired in a dispute with its largest=
 customer, which refused to pay for electricity. Some Indian politicians ha=
ve despised the deal for years, claiming that cunning and even corrupt Enro=
n executives cut a deal that charged India too much for its power.=20
Enron's ill-fated 1998 investment in the water-services business was anothe=
r drag on earnings. Many saw the purchase of Wessex Water in England as a `=
`consolation prize'' for Rebecca P. Mark, the hard-charging Enron executive=
 who had negotiated the Dabhol deal and other investments around the world.=
 With Skilling having won out as Lay's clear heir apparent, top executives =
wanted to move her out of the way, say former insiders. A narrowly split bo=
ard approved the Wessex deal, which formed the core of Azurix Corp., to be =
run by Mark. But Enron was blindsided by British regulators who slashed the=
 rates the utility could charge. Meanwhile, Mark piled on more high-priced =
water assets. ``Once [Skilling] put her there, he let her go wild,'' says a=
 former executive. ``And she's going to go wild because she has something t=
o prove.'' Mark spent too much on a water concession in Brazil and ran into=
 political obstacles. She declined to comment for this story.=20
But if Azurix was a prime example of Enron's sketchy investment strategy, i=
t also demonstrated how the company tried to disguise its problems with fin=
ancial alchemy. To set up the company, Enron formed a partnership called th=
e Atlantic Water Trust, in which it held a 50% stake. That kept Wessex off =
Enron's balance sheet. Enron's partner in the joint venture was Marlin Wate=
r Trust, which consisted of institutional investors. To help attract them, =
Enron promised to back up the debt with its own stock if necessary. But if =
Enron's credit rating fell below investment grade and the stock fell below =
a certain point, Enron could be on the hook for the partnership's $915 mill=
ion in debt.=20
The end for Enron came when its murky finances and less-than-forthright dis=
closures spooked investors and Dynegy. The clincher came when Dynegy's bank=
ers spent hours sifting through a supposedly final draft of Enron's about-t=
o-be-released 10Q--only to discover two pages of damning new numbers when t=
he quarterly statement was made publicly available. Debt coming due in the =
fourth quarter had leapt from under $1 billion to $2.8 billion. Even worse,=
 cash on hand--to which Dynegy had recently contributed $1.5 billion--shrun=
k from $3 billion to $1.2 billion. Dynegy ``had a two-hour meeting with the=
 new treasurer of Enron, who had been in that seat for two weeks,'' said a =
source close to the deal. ``He had no clue where the numbers came from.'' R=
ESPECT FOR ASSETS. Skilling and Fastow face most of the wrath of reeling em=
ployees. ``Someone told me yesterday if they see Jeff Skilling on the stree=
t, they would scratch out his eyes,'' says a former executive. One of Fasto=
w's lawyers, David B. Gerger, says his client has been the subject of death=
 threats and anti-Semitic tirades in Internet chat rooms. ``Naturally peopl=
e look for scapegoats, but it would be wrong to scapegoat Mr. Fastow,'' say=
s Gerger.=20
He confirms that Fastow has hired a big gun to handle his civil litigation:=
 David Boies's firm, which represented the Justice Dept. in its suit agains=
t Microsoft Corp. On Dec. 5, Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach filed a s=
uit against Fastow, Skilling, and 27 other Enron executives, saying they il=
legally made more than $1 billion off stock sales before Enron tanked. And =
a source at the Securities & Exchange Commission says four U.S. Attorney Of=
fices are considering whether to pursue criminal charges against Enron and =
its officers.=20
Would the cash squeeze have caught up to Enron, even without Skilling's and=
 Fastow's fancy financing? Credit analysts still argue that the debt would =
have been manageable, absent the crisis of confidence that dried up Enron's=
 trading business and access to the capital markets. But even they have a n=
ew respect for old-fashioned, high-quality assets. ``When things get really=
 tough, hard assets are the kind you can depend upon,'' says S&P's Shipman.=
 That's something Enron's whiz-kid financiers failed to appreciate.

Everyone Loved Enron
Here's what some management gurus said about Enron's rise, and what they th=
ink
now
JAMES J. O'TOOLE, Professor, Univ. of Southern Calif.
BEFORE
``Leadership is not a solo act...it is a shared responsibility, a chorus of
diverse and complimentary voices. To an unusual degree, [Enron] is chock-fu=
ll
o' leaders''
AFTER
``Egg all over the face is an understatement. As embarrassing as it is, we
basically took the word of Lay and his people. Was there a way to spot that
the emperor was wearing no clothes? I don't think so.''
CHRISTOPHER A. BARTLETT, Professor, Harvard Business School
BEFORE
``Skilling and Lay created `a hotbed of entrepreneurial activity and an eng=
ine
of growth.'''
AFTER
``There are absolutely some strong, helpful lessons to learn by what they d=
id
right. Unfortunately, all those are trumped by the mistakes they made.''
GARY HAMEL Chairman of consultant Strategos
BEFORE
``Enron isn't in the business of eking the last penny out of a dying busine=
ss
but of continuously creating radical new business concepts with huge upside=
.''
AFTER
``Do I feel like an idiot? No. If I misread the company in some way, I was =
one
of a hell of a lot of people who did that.''
SAMUEL E. BODILY, Professor, University of Virginia
BEFORE
``Skilling and others have led a transformation in Enron that is as
significant as any in business today. This is brand new thinking, and there
are broad implications for other companies.''
AFTER
``History can't be very kind to it. It's sad: The innovation and ideas and
what was good about what they did may be lost in the demise of the company.=

ENRON: LET US COUNT THE CULPRITS

12/17/2001
BusinessWeek=20
154
(Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)=20

Enron Corp.'s bankruptcy is a disaster of epic proportions by any measure--=
the height from which it fell, the speed with which it has unraveled, and t=
he pain it has inflicted on investors, employees, and creditors. Virtually =
all the checks and balances designed to prevent this kind of financial melt=
down failed. Unless remedied, this could undermine public trust, the capita=
l markets, and the nation's entire equity culture. Even now, no one really =
knows what liabilities are buried inside dozens of partnerships or the role=
 ex-CEO Jeffrey Skilling played in creating a byzantine system of off-balan=
ce-sheet operations. A culture of secrecy and a remarkable lack of transpar=
ency prevented any realistic assessment of the company's financial risk. No=
thing less than an overhaul of the auditing profession is now required to p=
olice accounting standards. Wall Street, mutual funds, and the business pre=
ss would also do well to rethink why each, in its own way, celebrated what =
is now revealed to be an arrogant, duplicitous company managed in a dangero=
us manner (page 30).=20
What is increasingly clear is that Skilling, a former McKinsey & Co. consul=
tant and Harvard Business School grad, tried to craft Enron as a new kind o=
f virtual trading giant, operating outside the scrutiny of investors and re=
gulators. Enron's numerous partnerships were shrouded in secrecy, tucked aw=
ay off the balance sheet. They were used to shift debt and assets off the b=
ooks while inflating earnings. The chief financial officer ran and partly o=
wned two partnerships, a clear conflict of interest. Enron leveraged itself=
 without a reality check by any outsider. ASLEEP. Hardly anyone inside the =
company was urging caution, certainly not chairman Ken Lay. The independent=
 auditing committee on the board of directors was clearly asleep. Given Enr=
on's arcane financial engineering, the committee probably relied on Arthur =
Andersen, the auditor, for information. But Andersen didn't blow any whistl=
es. No surprise there. It made more money selling consulting services to En=
ron last year than it did auditing the company. Criticizing Enron's books m=
ight have jeopardized consulting work. Similar conflicts of interest stoppe=
d Wall Street analysts from pulling the plug on Enron. Even as Enron slid t=
oward bankruptcy, ``buy'' recommendations were being issued by analysts who=
se firms were doing investment-banking business with the company, or were h=
oping to.
Did anyone really know what was going on inside Enron? The rating agencies,=
 Moody's Investor Service and Standard & Poor's, presumably had better acce=
ss than average investors, but neither downgraded Enron's credit rating to =
below investment grade until the bitter end. The rating agencies argue that=
 had they downgraded Enron sooner, they would have simply pushed the compan=
y into bankruptcy earlier. Here's a flash: So what? Moody's and S&P have on=
e basic job--assessing risk for investors. If they couldn't penetrate Enron=
's complex financial engineering, the rating agencies should have said so.=
=20
The business press, including BusinessWeek, did no better. It celebrated Sk=
illing's vision of Enron as a virtual company that could securitize anythin=
g and trade it anywhere. The press blithely accepted Enron as the epitome o=
f a new, post-deregulation corporate model when it should have been much mo=
re aggressive in probing the company's opaque partnerships, off balance she=
et maneuvers, and soaring leverage. TRAGIC. Enron's fall is made all the mo=
re tragic because of the pain inflicted on its thousands of employees. Not =
only are many losing their jobs, but some 12,000 are also losing most of th=
eir retirement savings. In perhaps its most egregious risk-management error=
, employees mostly held Enron stock in their 401(k)s, yet the company preve=
nted them from selling until they reached the age of 54. People could only =
watch as the stock plummeted from $89 to a dollar. Diversification, particu=
larly in retirement accounts, is the cardinal rule in managing risk. Enron =
broke that rule, as have other companies.=20
Enron's tale is a clarifying event. It reveals key weaknesses in the financ=
ial system that must be corrected as the U.S. moves forward in the 21st cen=
tury. If America is to have an equity culture in which individuals invest i=
n stocks and provide the capital for fast economic growth, the market must =
be able to correctly value companies. This requires making financial data r=
eadily available and easily comprehensible.=20
To restore public confidence, several steps should be taken. After accounti=
ng disasters at MicroStrategy, Cendant, Lucent, Cisco, and Waste Management=
, it is clear that self-regulation is not working. Conflicts of interest wi=
thin auditing firms remain widespread. Investors can ignore analysts on TV =
who work for investment firms. But someone has to play the role of the hone=
st watchdog. Unless the Big Five auditing firms clean up their act, they wi=
ll wind up with a federally chartered oversight body. It is equally clear t=
hat current standard accounting rules aren't sufficient. Loopholes allowed =
Enron to fool everyone, making a mockery of public disclosure.=20
Regulators should also insist that corporations give their employees choice=
 in their 401(k)s. Some 30% of assets held in 1.5 million 401(k) plans are =
in the stock of the company sponsoring the plan. This lack of diversificati=
on puts too many people at risk.=20
In the end, the Enron story is about a secretive corporate culture that fai=
led in its primary business mission: to manage risk. Had the Federal Reserv=
e and other central banks not flooded the global economy with liquidity in =
recent months, Enron's collapse could have posed a deep threat to the finan=
cial markets. It's past time to fix the system.

Digging Into the Deal That Broke Enron; Behind the web of mysterious partne=
rships that led to the world's biggest corporate collapse. Follow the Rapto=
rs
By Allan Sloan With Debra Rosenberg in Washington and Anne Belli Gesalman i=
n Houston. sloan is NEWSWEEK's Wall Street editor. His e-mail address is sl=
oan@panix.com.

Enron corp. used to talk about becoming the world's biggest company. Instea=
d, it became the world's biggest corporate failure, filing for bankruptcy l=
ast week. The company, which used complexity to its advantage on the way up=
, became a victim of its own complex dealmaking on the way down. A NEWSWEEK=
 examination of Enron's filings shows that the company's fatal mistake was =
an unintended byproduct of one such deal. The transaction first inflated En=
ron's reportednet worth, then deflated it. When the company cleaned up its =
books this fall, it triggered the $1.2 billion net-worth write-down that to=
uched off the downward spiral that led to bankruptcy.=20
Enron looked like a well-oiled machine, but a lot of it seems to have been =
jury-rigged. The company was housed in a spiffy 50-story building in downto=
wn Houston, a structure whose elevators flashed Enron's latest stock price =
and delivered upbeat messages to get employees pumped by the time they got =
to their offices. In the best New Economy tradition, Enron had an on-site h=
ealth club, casual dress and employees piling up paper wealth by investing =
in Enron stock.
But when things started going bad, Enron couldn't cope. It couldn't even fi=
re people properly. Information-technology specialist Diana Peters says her=
 entire department was told to clear out on half an hour's notice and to ca=
ll their office voice mail to see if they should return to work the next da=
y. Very classy. "I was crying, a lot of people were crying," says Peters, 5=
1. "It reminded me of a mass funeral."=20
The company even had trouble going broke. Normally, a company hoards cash i=
n preparation for bankruptcy by accelerating collections from its customers=
 and slowing down payments to vendors. Enron didn't start doing that until =
a few days before the filing, far too late. Enron almost became the Flying =
Dutchman of the bankruptcy world. It wanted to file in Wilmington, Dela., b=
ut the bankruptcy court there didn't want the case. So Enron ended up in Ne=
w York City. And it was so short of cash that it had to scurry around to li=
ne up $1.5 billion of so-called debtor-in-possession financing to keep the =
place operating. Normally, you make DIP arrangements before you file.=20
It would be lots of fun to give you Washington's take on all this, Enron be=
ing famous for close ties to the White House and the Republican Party. But =
we'll leave that for another day, because the juicy stuff probably won't sh=
ow up until the Democrats get in gear. Hearings in the Republican-controlle=
d House are set for this week, and will focus on accounting and stock analy=
sts and the Securities and Exchange Commission rather than on Enron's polit=
ical relationships and what, if anything, the White House did during Enron'=
s final days.=20
Although some details are still murky, one thing is clear: Arthur Andersen,=
 Enron's outside accountant, is in big trouble, and it (or its insurers) wi=
ll have to fork over big bucks. Andersen's big problem stems from a company=
 called JEDI--as in "Star Wars"--that Enron now says should have been on it=
s books since 1997. Andersen allowed JEDI to remain off the books for years=
. The other deal, involving a company called Raptor, caused the net-worth d=
isappearance that set Enron on the road to ruin.=20
JEDI stands for Joint Energy Development Investments. It was a partnership =
between Enron and the California state-employees' pension fund, known as Ca=
l-pers. The Force was with Enron, which invested the money--$250 million ea=
ch from itself and Calpers--in power plants, energy stocks and such, making=
 more than 20 percent a year. Pretty neat. In late 1997, Calpers was willin=
g to invest $500 million in a new partnership, JEDI 2. But it wanted to fir=
st cash in its JEDI 1 chips, worth $383 million. Instead of just liquidatin=
g JEDI, Enron got cute. (I'm not sure why. Enron declined to comment.) It w=
ent looking for an outsider to fork over $383 million and take Calpers's pl=
ace. Enter something called Chewco Investments--as in Chewbacca of "Star Wa=
rs" fame. Chewco was a partnership of Enron employees and some undisclosed =
outsiders. (Who they are and how much they made is a mystery, because Chewc=
o is a private entity.) Chewco's investors didn't have a spare $383 million=
. So Enron lent Chewco $132 million and guaranteed a $240 million loan that=
 Chewco took out elsewhere. Enron was thus at risk for its own JEDI stake a=
nd essentially all of Chewco's. That being the case, it's a mystery why And=
ersen let Enron keep JEDI off its books. Accounting experts who have looked=
 at this transaction, which Enron disclosed last month, just shake their he=
ads. Andersen has refused to comment, saying it's too early to reach conclu=
sions. Enron has restated its earnings dating back to 1997 because it says =
JEDI should have been on its books since then. Guess what? The restated pro=
fits are far lower than the original ones.=20
Now, to the deals that sank Enron. As in JEDI, Enron won't comment. These t=
ransactions involve four companies called Raptor. It looks like the Raptors=
 were set up to let Enron use financial gymnastics to get gains from stocks=
 it owned without actually selling them. The major holdings were Rhythms Ne=
t Connections, a now bankrupt start-up telecom company, and NewPower Holdin=
gs, which competes with established power companies for customers. At their=
 height, Enron's stake in these companies totaled about $2 billion. Friday'=
s value: about $40 million. Enron won't say why it didn't just sell the sto=
ck and take its profits. The most logical explanation is tax avoidance.=20
Now, the key to Enron's undoing. The company committed to put $1.2 billion =
of Enron stock into the Raptors to make them more creditworthy. It didn't p=
romise a fixed number of shares--it promised $1.2 billion worth, regardless=
 of the share price. A seriously dumb move for a company that talks about h=
edging risks. In return for that commitment, the Raptors gave Enron $1.2 bi=
llion of promissory notes. Enron put them on its balance sheet as an asset.=
 When a company adds to its assets and nothing else changes, its net worth =
rises. Hence, Enron marked up its net worth by $1.2 billion.=20
But as the stock prices of Rhythms, NewPower and Enron all sank, Enron face=
d having to fork over a ruinous number of new shares. So Enron paid $35 mil=
lion to the Raptors' outside investors--yet another mysterious partnership-=
-and liquidated the Raptors. That eliminated the notes, which eliminated th=
e aforementioned $1.2 billion from Enron's net worth. That set off the now =
famous October run on Enron's credit, which ultimately led to bankruptcy. N=
ow, far too late, Enron says it shouldn't have counted the notes as assets.=
=20
The bottom line: numbers matter. So does truth. Enron was too clever by hal=
f. And that's a good way to end up looking stupid.=20

As things begin to calm down somewhat after events of last week, we wanted to update all employees of certain organizational and personnel changes that have occurred recently.

Organizational Matters
The Creditors' Committee was formed last week by the United States Trustee.  This committee is comprised of 15 individuals representing various creditor groups including: banks, bondholders, insurance companies and employees.  The Creditors' Committee will be the key point of contact as we reorganize the company and emerge from Chapter 11.  Initially, they will send financial advisors to our offices to monitor any asset liquidations as well as review our cash flow projections.  Ultimately, they will be responsible for approving our reorganization plan as to which assets or businesses we sell and which ones we retain.

>From an Enron perspective, the plans for reorganization have already begun.  Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed.  We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future.  Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week.  This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company.

By now, you must have heard of "NETCO." This company was formed as a means to maximize the value of Enron's most valuable business, the wholesale energy business.  Certain Enron North America employees have been assigned to NETCO to re-build the North American gas and power business under different ownership.  We will be filing with the bankruptcy court this week proposed auction procedures to allow bidders to bid for NETCO.  It is our expectation that Enron would retain a 49 percent (or perhaps less) non-controlling interest in NETCO.  The NETCO employees would become employees of the winning bidder.  We anticipate this process to reach closure sometime in January.

As for the remaining businesses of Enron, they are all under review as to which ones will be proposed for sale and which ones will be proposed for retention.  This review process will take time as it will require approval of the Creditors' Committee.  We will update you periodically on our process.

Personnel Matters
As a result of our current situation, we have made many personnel changes over the past several months to maximize the value of the organization.

Office of the Chairman - Enron Corp
Jeff McMahon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has been added to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Corp along with Ken Lay and Greg Whalley.  Among other things, Jeff has been working on the business plan for reorganization in Chapter 11 and is the primary contact with the newly formed Creditor's Committee.

Treasurer - Enron Corp
Ray Bowen was elected to Executive Vice President, Finance and Treasurer of Enron Corp recently.  In this role, Ray is responsible for all finance activities of Enron Corp.  Ray also has the lead role in managing the cash activities of the company on a day to day basis.

Corporate Development
Mark Muller has been appointed Executive Vice President - Corporate Development.  In this role, Mark will work with Enron's various business units on all asset disposals, which will be a key element in Enron's reorganization plan and value preservation.

Wholesale Services
The Wholesale Services group has been reorganized under the leadership of Jim Fallon.  Included in this group are the following businesses, ENA, EBS, EIM and EGM.  As part of the Chapter 11 reorganization, efforts in these businesses will be directed at maximizing value for the creditors as well as determining which businesses or assets will be part of Enron's reorganization plan.

Management Committee Departures
Unfortunately, due to the current financial condition of the company, the following members of the management committee have left the company or will be leaving the company by the end of December:

Michael Brown
Mark Frevert
Steve Kean
Mike McConnell
Jeff Shankman

Additionally, John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen have resigned from the Management Committee to arrange for the joint venture energy activities of NETCO.

We know as employees the uncertainty surrounding the future of the company is unsettling.  Unfortunately, that aspect will not change in the near term.  We ask for everyone's patience and continued support as we move forward through the Chapter 11 process.  We are committed to reorganizing into a strong company once again and will need the help of all the employees to achieve that goal.

Enron's Lay Turns Down Severance Pay
By Rebecca Smith and John R. Emshwiller
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

11/14/2001
The Wall Street Journal

Enron Corp. said its chairman, Kenneth Lay, has decided to forgo a severance payment of $60.6 million that could be triggered by Dynegy Inc.'s planned acquisition of Enron. Mr. Lay's decision capped a day in which he appears to have changed his mind on the matter at least twice. 
Early in the day, an Enron filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission laid out Mr. Lay's severance package. By midday, Enron indicated that Mr. Lay would keep only one-third of the payout, which he would take in stock in the combined company, and that he intended to donate one-third to a foundation to help displaced Enron employees. The remaining third would cover income-tax liabilities.
But by the end of the day, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said that Mr. Lay, following a meeting of Enron energy traders, had decided against taking any of the severance pay. Though Mr. Lay didn't attend the traders' meeting, senior managers told him that "opinions were expressed that he shouldn't receive the payment," Mr. Palmer said. "He decided the cleanest thing to do was to waive the payment." The opinions of traders carry particular weight because they produce most of Enron's profits. Questions for Mr. Lay were directed to Mr. Palmer, who said he had spoken with Mr. Lay and other company officials during the day. 
The initial disclosure about Mr. Lay's hefty severance payment raised new questions about his willingness to sell Enron for a share price that was about a third of the market price of a month ago. Last Friday, Mr. Lay even said that Enron had other options to the Dynegy purchase, which might have allowed the energy company to remain independent, though he declined to elaborate. "Things weren't desperate . . . we had alternatives," Mr. Lay said. The 59-year-old Mr. Lay won't have an executive position at the combined company, though he might be a director. 
For the 12 months ended Aug. 31, Mr. Lay received about $70 million through the exercise of Enron options, according to disclosure reports compiled by Thomson Financial. Last year, Mr. Lay was paid $8.3 million in salary and bonus and more than $10 million in stock awards and other compensation. 
Enron, the nation's largest energy trader, saw its stock collapse in recent weeks following a series of disclosures about the company's extensive dealings with partnerships run by some of its own officers. Those dealings are under investigation by the SEC. Last Friday, Enron agreed to be acquired by the far smaller Houston-based Dynegy for stock, currently valued at about $10.7 billion. The merger agreement still must be approved by regulators and shareholders of the two companies. 
Separately, the California Public Employees' Retirement System, which owns about three million Enron and 500,000 Dynegy shares, said it would oppose the appointment of any current Enron board member to the board of a combined company. Michael Flaherman, chair of CalPERS investment committee said that it appeared that Enron's board "failed in its responsibility" to monitor the activities of Enron executives. 
Mr. Palmer, the Enron spokesman, said Mr. Lay had provisions in his employment contract to protect him against a sudden change in control from 1989 forward. In February 2000, when Enron stock was trading between $60 and $70 a share and Mr. Lay was being widely lauded for his performance, he negotiated a bigger severance package than he had previously. Last August, when Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling quit unexpectedly, Mr. Lay assumed Mr. Skilling's duties and his contract term was extended by two years to Dec. 31, 2005. 
Under the terms of his contract, Mr. Lay is entitled to payment of $20.2 million for every full calendar year left on his employment contract, in the event that his employment terminates within 60 days of a change in control. Thus, Mr. Lay is entitled to three full years of payments, or $60.6 million. 
Mr. Lay, who took charge of the then-Houston Natural Gas Co. in 1984 when it was a regional pipeline company, wasn't the only member of his family to benefit from Enron's heady rise to a global energy giant. SEC filings show that in recent years a sister of Mr. Lay, Sharon Lay, and a son, Mark Lay, received millions of dollars in salary, commissions and bonuses related to Ms. Lay's travel agency and a paper-products company connected to the younger Mr. Lay. 
Mr. Palmer said it is a "cheap shot" to criticize the Lay family because the pertinent transactions were reported in several annual proxy statements. "The contracts were bid out and fairly awarded," Mr. Palmer said. Ms. Lay said her travel agency, of which she is president and half-owner, had won its Enron business through competitive bidding and by providing "the very best service possible." Mark Lay couldn't be reached for comment. 
Coming on top of disclosures of Enron's dealings with partnerships run by its own executives, the relationships between Lay family members and the company again raise questions about Enron's willingness to keep separate corporate and personal interests. Former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and possibly other Enron executives made millions of dollars from these partnerships. 
Mark Lay's dealings with Enron date back to 1994, according to the available SEC filings. In May 1997, Mark Lay and "certain other individuals" who together had been officers, directors or shareholders of a company called Paper & Print Management Corp., or PPMC, entered into employment agreements with an Enron unit, Enron Capital & Trade Resources, according to Enron's 1998 proxy statement. The individuals helped set up "a clearinghouse for the purchase and sale of finished paper products," according to the SEC filing. Mr. Palmer said this effort formed the rudiments of Enron's profitable paper and pulp-trading business. 
As part of the deal, Enron agreed to reimburse PPMC $1 million for certain expenses. Mark Lay and his colleagues also agreed to "convey" to Enron "certain intangible property rights" from PPMC. 
Mark Lay also got a three-year employment contract from Enron as a vice president of Enron Capital & Trade. He got a signing bonus of $100,000, a minimum monthly salary of $12,500, a minimum annual bonus of $100,000 for 1997-1999 and an option to purchase 20,000 Enron shares. Mark Lay is no longer with Enron and is now attending a seminary, said Mr. Palmer. 
Since 1985, Sharon Lay's firm, Lay/Wittenberg Travel Agency in the Park Inc., has provided travel arrangements for employees of Enron and its predecessor company. For this work the agency received $6.8 million from 1996 through 2000. In an interview yesterday, Ms. Lay said Enron accounted for more than half of her firm's revenue in some years. She said her brother's position was "more a problem" than an asset since it led some to assume she hadn't worked hard enough to get Enron's business.

Inside Track
Enron CEO Cut Stakes in Firms Where He Sits in Director's Seat
By Cassell Bryan-Low
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

11/14/2001
The Wall Street Journal
C14
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Kenneth L. Lay, Enron Corp.'s embattled chairman and chief executive, in recent weeks has cashed in nearly $2 million of shares in companies at which he sits on the board. 
Mr. Lay, 59 years, sold $1.2 million of shares, or more than a quarter of his holdings, of Compaq Computer Corp., where he has been a director for 14 years. In his first sale of the Houston-based company's shares since 1999, he disposed of 124,596 shares Oct. 29 for $9.25 each, leaving him with a 340,724 share stake. Apart from two directors who resigned, he is the only Compaq insider to have sold shares this year.
The sale comes as the computer company awaits completion of its planned merger with Hewlett-Packard Co. -- a deal the board has repeatedly said it supports. In a Nov. 7 news release, the board, including Mr. Lay, said it "reaffirmed its strong support for the proposed merger." A day earlier, H-P's founding Hewlett family, which controls 5% of H-P stock, said it intended to oppose the merger, throwing the deal's future into uncertainty. Compaq shares traded at $8.80, up $1.14, as of 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. 
The sale, Mr. Lay said, wasn't related to his views on the merger. "It's no negative [reflection] on Compaq," he said. Mr. Lay, who also sold shares of drug maker Eli Lilly & Co., where he has been a director since 1993, said of both sales, "I needed to have a little more liquidity." 
On Oct. 31, he sold 10,000 shares of Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, representing roughly a 16% reduction of his holdings, at prices of $77.55 and $77.56 a share, or $775,550 total. That figure is $34,250 above what he paid for the same number of shares Feb. 20 at $74.13 each. After the sale, Mr. Lay owned 54,528 Eli Lilly shares. 
Eli Lilly shares traded at $78.97, up 75 cents, on the NYSE yesterday. Eli Lilly had no comment on the sales, and Compaq spokesman Arch Currid said, "We don't comment on the personal financial transactions of board members." 
Mr. Lay also noted that much of his net worth is tied up in Enron, shares of which tumbled by as much as 80% during the past several weeks alone. Enron shocked investors Oct. 16 when it announced a third-quarter loss of $618 million. The Houston energy company has since announced huge write-offs of assets, reductions of shareholder equity, major downward restatements of past earnings reports; and it has disclosed a regulatory probe into its complex transactions with off-balance-sheet partnerships. Shares have recovered some ground since Friday's announcement by Dynegy Inc., a rival Houston independent power producer, of plans to acquire Enron. Shares of Enron traded at $9.98, up 74 cents, or 8%, on the Big Board as of 4 p.m. 
As previously reported, Mr. Lay sold $25.7 million of his Enron shares this year, as the stock fell from about $78 to under $44, and his remaining stake is valued at about $28 million. For 2000, he earned a salary of $1.3 million, a bonus of $7 million, plus $7.5 million in Enron restricted stock and other benefits, including use of a personal plane, according to Enron's proxy statement. 
Mr. Lay, who was Enron's CEO from 1985 until February of this year, resumed the post after his successor, Jeffrey Skilling, stepped down in August after only six months on the job. At that time, Mr. Lay agreed to stay on through 2005, but his employment agreement provides for a lump-sum payment under a change of control, such as the proposed merger with Dynegy, according to a regulatory document filed yesterday. The deal is expected to close sometime next year, in which case Mr. Lay would be entitled to $60.6 million under his contract if he terminates his employment within 60 days of the merger. In addition, Mr. Lay is entitled to an amount for any related tax penalties if the payment was deemed to constitute an "excess parachute payment," the filing said. 
Mr. Lay also serves on the board of EOTT Energy Corp. -- the general partner of EOTT Energy Partners LP -- and NewPower Holdings Co. 
Mr. Lay also recently sold his stake in i2 Technologies Inc., according to his spokesman, following Mr. Lay's resignation from the board of that company Oct. 25 after serving for a year. As of March 2001, he owned 13,000 shares of the Dallas business-software company, a stake that would have been valued at about $64,000 at the time he resigned.

THE MARKETS: Market Place
Enron Chief Will Give Up Severance
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. and FLOYD NORRIS

Trying to quell a furious reaction from employees outraged that he stood to profit from a merger with Dynegy Inc., Kenneth L. Lay, the chairman and chief executive of the Enron Corporation, decided late yesterday to give up a severance package worth more than $60 million. 
The tumult at Enron's headquarters in Houston began after the company disclosed in a securities filing earlier in the day that Mr. Lay was in line to collect $60.6 million in pay after the deal closed next year, $20.2 million for every full calendar year left in his employment contract.
Mr. Lay had been a popular leader as Enron grew in the last 15 years from a pipeline operator into the nation's largest energy trader, a business largely of his invention. Employees shared in the gains, though none gained as much as Mr. Lay, who has collected more than $300 million since 1989, mostly through exercising stock options. 
But the value of employees' stock options and their 401(k) accounts evaporated this fall as Enron shares plummeted amid concerns over the company's accounting practices. And traders and other workers started the day yesterday gossiping angrily about Mr. Lay's severance package. 
Then, at an afternoon meeting of employees in the company's core natural gas and electricity trading operation, which provides by far the biggest part of Enron's profits, ''quite a bit of concern was raised about the news people had been seeing about this change-of-control payment,'' Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, said. 
At about 4 p.m. Central time, two senior executives who had attended the meeting, John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen, told Mr. Lay about the reaction of employees. ''Ken made a decision shortly thereafter that the best thing to do would be to waive the payment altogether,'' Mr. Palmer said. Even if Dynegy's directors later voted to award Mr. Lay a new severance agreement, he would turn it down, Mr. Palmer added. 
''What Ken said is that this is the absolute cleanest way to remove any doubts, that he was not going to profit as a result of this change of control,'' Mr. Palmer said. ''This issue was causing enough concern among employees that he wanted to deal with it.'' 
Severance pay had been an awkward matter for Mr. Lay in the last week. The only reason that Enron was being acquired -- putting the severance clauses in his employment contract into effect -- were the financial problems that have occurred on his watch. The company's shares have lost almost 90 percent of their value after peaking in the summer of 2000. 
During merger discussions last week, Mr. Lay told Dynegy's chairman, Charles L. Watson, that he wanted to rework the severance package, Mr. Palmer said. On Monday, Mr. Watson disclosed that Mr. Lay wanted much of the severance to be in the form of stock options. 
By yesterday afternoon, Enron officials were saying that Mr. Lay planned to take two-thirds of the severance in stock or other noncash compensation. And, they said, he wanted to give half of that amount, or one-third of his total package, to establish a charitable foundation to benefit Enron employees. 
It was about an hour later that Enron said Mr. Lay would give up the severance entirely. 
Mr. Lay has not decided whether to accept an invitation to be on the board of the combined company, which will be called Dynegy. 
The deal could still fall victim to antitrust objections or disclosures of further financial problems at Enron. 
Whether Mr. Lay's gesture will placate Enron's traders, who are now deluging other energy-trading companies with resumes, remains to be seen. Dynegy is known as a much more conservative firm than Enron, and analysts renewed their concerns yesterday about the cultural clash draining the talent, and value, from the combined company. 
''So much of their top talent is going out the door, I don't know what Dynegy gets,'' said a senior executive at another rival firm. 
The stunning near-collapse of Enron -- bankruptcy was only averted, some analysts say, by the Dynegy acquisition -- closes a chapter on one of the most influential careers in the history of the energy business. 
The ugly circumstances of Enron's downfall, including the revelation that partnerships were used to move debt off the company's balance sheet and that Enron overstated profits in the last five years by almost $600 million, have left Mr. Lay's reputation in tatters. 
Just months ago, Mr. Lay was widely hailed -- or decried, in some circles -- as the genius behind energy deregulation. His friend, George W. Bush, had been elected president, and policies favored by Enron were front and center in the administration's energy policy. Mr. Lay retired from day-to-day management, making plans to pursue new business interests. 
But he again assumed the chief executive's post at Enron in August, after the unexpected resignation of his handpicked successor, Jeffrey K. Skilling, and the accounting problems swiftly unfolded in the weeks that followed. On Monday, Mr. Lay said he might revive the business plans he set aside during the summer, but he declined to say what those plans were. 
Even without the severance package, Mr. Lay has become enormously wealthy running Enron. 
All told, from 1989 through this year, Mr. Lay collected about $13 million in salary (his exact salary for this year is not known) and $26.8 million in cash bonuses. But those sums were dwarfed by the $266.7 million in profits that he received in selling stock. 
The bulk of his income from exercising options came in the last four years: $13.1 million in 1998, $43.9 million in 1999, $123.4 million in 2000 and $20.7 million this year -- a year in which he sold stock by prearrangement on every trading day through July 31, and then stopped, not wanting to appear to be selling as the stock price was declining. 
The options he has cashed in recent years, as well as those he now owns, are badly out of the money at Enron's current stock price of $9.98, down from a peak reached in 2000 of $90.75. 
His bonus in 2000 was $7 million, an award that Enron's board said was based on the company's rising profits and high shareholder return. The company restated those profits last week, explaining that it had improperly applied accounting rules. It said that about 40 percent of its profit in 2000 came from transactions with partnerships that were controlled by Andrew S. Fastow, who was then Enron's chief financial officer. 
The company's stock price, which was in free fall after questions about the Fastow partnerships prompted an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, fell to $7 a share in the wake of the disclosures. That was the lowest price for the stock since 1991. It rebounded to nearly $10 after Dynegy agreed to acquire the company in a stock swap. 
In January, Enron's board awarded another bonus to Mr. Lay, of $3.6 million. That was based entirely on the company's shareholder return from 1997 through 2000, which came to 294 percent, the company said. All of that return has since been wiped out. 
Also in January, Mr. Lay was awarded 106,578 shares of restricted stock, to vest periodically through 2004. All the shares will now vest when the Dynegy deal is completed, and while their value has plunged, the award is still worth more than $1 million. 
Still, Mr. Lay suffered huge paper losses this year. 
At the end of 2000, he had 5.1 million options that could have been exercised for profits of $257.5 million, and another 1.5 million options that would have been worth another $104.1 million when enough time had passed that they could be exercised -- assuming the share price stayed level. He exercised 565,928 of those options this year, making a profit of $20.7 million, but the ones he did not exercise are now under water.

COMPANIES & FINANCE THE AMERICAS - Regulators face new boundaries in Enron deal.
By NANCY DUNNE and PETER SPIEGEL.

11/14/2001
Financial Times
(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved

Regulators wading into the competitive landscape following Dynegy's offer to buy Enron will be scrutinising a new industry where traditional yardsticks like market definition and barriers to entry have yet to be determined. This will make gaining approval of the $10bn deal an uncertain and complicated task, experts said. 
Dynegy and Enron have insisted the merger, which will combine the largest energy trading company in the world with one of its largest competitors, will be approved by federal regulators without significant conditions or divestitures.
But competition lawyers said this week that because the market for energy trading is so new - indeed, it was all but created by Enron in the 1990s - that federal agencies will have to spend months finding out how rivals compete in order to develop guidelines to measure the merger's impact. 
"We don't have any track record here," said Ernest Gellhorn, an antitrust expert at George Mason University. 
The deal will be reviewed by state and federal agencies, but the most critical approvals will come from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and US antitrust agencies. 
Central to the antitrust review will be how competition authorities define the market - how big it is, which companies are included as competitors, and how the market share is divided up. 
Former antitrust officials said Enron might be forced to resort to a "failing firm" defence, which is occasionally used by companies with large market shares when attempting to add to their dominant position. 
But Robert McTamaney, an antitrust partner at Carter Ledyard & Milburn, said the failing-firm route may be difficult for Dynegy and Enron to prove, since it requires a showing that without the merger, Enron's trading business would exit the market completely. 
Helping the companies, however, is the relative ease with which competitors can enter the trading market, experts said. 
An analysis of barriers will hinge on whether rivals can successfully argue that the level of expertise in the industry is so sophisticated - or that Enron's trading technologies are so specialised - that it would be impossible for new entrants to duplicate the company's operations. 
Dynegy executives said they expect more scrutiny from FERC, though it rarely rejects mergers, and its guidelines put an emphasis on speed of reviews.

FRONT PAGE - COMPANIES & MARKETS: Enron chief will turn down Dollars 60m takeover windfall 
Financial Times; Nov 14, 2001
By SHEILA MCNULTY and PETER THAL LARSEN

Ken Lay, the chairman and chief executive of Enron, is set to turn down a Dollars 60.6m pay-off to which he was entitled following the troubled power group's takeover by Dynegy.
Mr Lay, who oversaw Enron's rapid rise and its subsequent collapse and sale to Dynegy, was due the payment under an employment contract he extended when he resumed full control of the company in August 2001.
However Mr Lay decided yesterday after meeting with some Enron employees that he would turn down the payment.
"Ken Lay will not accept the Dollars 60m when he leaves," an Enron spokeswoman said. "He felt like it was not the right thing to do."
According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr Lay is entitled to Dollars 20.2m in cash for every remaining year in his employment contract if he leaves Enron within 60 days of the company being taken over.
Mr Lay's decision is in sharp contrast to other senior US executives who have negotiated - and accepted - "golden parachutes" which guarantee them large payments even if they oversaw large-scale destruction in shareholder value.
Mr Lay had previously come under fire from shareholders for selling some of his Enron shareholding before the collapse in the company's stock price. Between January and July this year, he sold Enron shares with an estimated value of more than Dollars 27.5m.
At the close of trading yesterday Enron was valued at Dollars 7.5bn, compared with a peak of Dollars 65.9bn in August last year.
The terms were part of Mr Lay's original employment contract, which had been due to expire in December 2003. But in August, following the sudden departure of chief executive Jeff Skilling, Enron's board extended Mr Lay's contract by two years.
At the time, the contract extension was seen as an attempt by Mr Lay to restore investor confidence in the company. But it also ensured he would receive an additional Dollars 40.4m if he left following a sale.
After the Dollars 10.8bn Dynegy takeover, Mr Lay is expected to give up his executive responsibilities. He may join the combined group's board of directors but this will not affect his eligibility for a pay-off. The deal, which requires the approval of US competition authorities, is expected to be completed next year.

Enron Chief Relinquishes Severance Pay

TIMES STAFF WRITER

Enron Corp. Chief Executive Kenneth L. Lay on Tuesday waived a severance payment of at least $60 million due him when Dynegy Inc. completes its expected acquisition of Enron next year, company officials said. 
The potential payment, disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission regulatory filing Tuesday, would undoubtedly have sparked additional controversy, given Lay's primary role in the sharp fall of Enron's stock and worsening financial condition, which led to the Dynegy deal.
The payment would have been one of the biggest rewards for failure in corporate history, said Graef Crystal, a leading compensation expert. 
The payment would have topped the nearly $40 million Mattel Inc. paid former Chief Executive Jill Barad after she was ousted in 2000 after spending $3.6 billion to purchase a money-losing software business the company eventually gave away to a technology group in return for a slice of future profit. 
It would have been almost double the $35 million in severance collected by former Xerox Corp. Chief Executive Richard Thoman when he was fired in May 2000 after a disastrous reorganization of the copier company's sales force. 
According to Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne, Lay spoke to a number of employees Tuesday and "decided that the best course of action would be for him to waive his right to payment." 
"Instead," Denne said, "the combined company would decide the best use of those funds." 
Lay and Enron have run into a storm of criticism in recent weeks after the disclosure of a series of partnerships and the dismissal of several top executives who invested in those ventures. 
News of the partnerships and their losses forced the Houston-based company to restate its earnings last week, reducing corporate profits over the last four years by $586 million, or about 20%, to $2.3billion. 
Shareholders have filed a series of lawsuits against Enron, charging the company with failing to disclose key information about its operations and financial structure. 
The negative disclosures sparked a cash crunch and threatened Enron with collapse until it was saved by an agreement Friday to be acquired by Houston-based Dynegy for $9 billion. 
Shareholders have watched the value of Enron shares decline almost 90% from a high of nearly $90 on Aug. 23, 2000. Its shares closed Tuesday at $9.98, up 74cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. 
CEO Already Reaped 
$150 Million in Options 
According to the regulatory filing, Lay stood to collect $20.2 million a year, plus certain extraordinary tax expenses, for each of the full years remaining on his contract once the company was acquired. 
If the Dynegy deal is completed as expected next year, Lay's payment would have totaled at least $60.6 million. His contract ends on Dec. 31, 2005. 
Lay already reaped about $150million in stock option gains the last two years alone. Those gains were in part made possible by rosy Enron profit statements, which the company restated downward last week, Crystal said. 
"It is a good move to waive the payment," Crystal said. "But that's just the down payment on what he should give back. There is probably another $100 million in option profits he should give back. Had they correctly stated the books, the stock would not have risen as high and he would not have made as much from exercising his stock options in the company." 
A stock option gives the holder the right to purchase a share of a company at a predetermined price. Options are a common executive pay incentive, allowing the individual to purchase and sell the shares, pocketing the gains in their appreciation. Lay made $123 million off such transactions last year and $26 million this year, Crystal said. 
Lay since 1989 has had a "change of control" clause that awards him a special payment if Enron changes hands. The company described the clause as a standard part of executive employment agreements common to many companies. 
Some Wall Street analysts said the liability for the payment would be Dynegy's problem at the point the merger is completed. Enron shareholders already have suffered all the damage they are going to see. 
"Enron has clearly lost the vast majority of its shareholders over the last six months with its piecemeal disclosure, destruction of shareholder value and loss of credibility," said Andre Meade of Commerzbank Securities in New York. 
John Sousa, a spokesman for Dynegy, said the company was aware of the severance clause and had factored the expense into its acquisition, which "we believe is a very strong financial transaction" regardless of the potential payment to Lay.

Enron CEO Says No to $60.6 Million

Kenneth Lay, chairman and chief executive of Enron Corp., decided yesterday to forgo an expected $60.6 million severance payment because of the impact of Enron's plunging stock price on the company's employees, a spokesman said. 
Until yesterday, Lay was preparing to accept the severance payout, which would be triggered at the completion of Enron's purchase by rival Houston energy company Dynegy Inc., a deal announced on Friday. Enron faced a cash crisis after disclosing it has overstated its earnings by $586 million over the past four years because of improper accounting treatment of its investments in outside partnerships that were managed by its chief financial officer.
The severance package was reported yesterday by Bloomberg News, which included a blistering comment by Andrew Whalley, manager of a trust that sold $5 million in Enron stock in April because of concerns with Enron's financial reports, Bloomberg said. 
Whalley called the settlement "a ridiculous amount of money" to pay the chairman of a company that suffered "a textbook financial collapse, where he obviously had some knowledge of what was going on." 
Enron spokesman Karen Denne said around midafternoon yesterday that Lay intended to donate one-third of the severance to Enron employees, keep one-third and use the remainder to pay taxes on the entire package. Lay, who built Enron into the world's largest energy trading company, was entitled to a payment of $20.2 million multiplied by each year remaining on his employment contract if it was terminated before it expires at the end of 2005. The purchase by Dynegy is expected to close in 2002, assuming regulatory approvals are forthcoming, giving Lay three years of payments. Lay said last week that he will retire once the deal is done. 
Denne checked again with Lay later in the afternoon and was told that he had decided not to accept any of the severance payment after a meeting yesterday with Enron employees. "He realized this was extremely sensitive given the financial condition of Enron employees," Denne said. 
Many Enron employees hold the company's stock in savings and retirement plans, and the stock price has fallen from a high of $90 a share in August 2000 to a low of $8.41 last Thursday. 
Enron's price has picked up since the purchase announcement, closing at $9.98 yesterday. Dynegy has agreed to pay $23 billion for Enron, about $10 billion of that in stock (about $10 a share, when the deal was announced), while assuming Enron debt for the rest. 
Lay's compensation was increased nearly threefold, to $18.3 million, last year, when the company's annual revenue reached $100 billion and its stock hit an all-time high. 
Lay realized a gain of $123.4 million from exercising stock options last year. He is entitled to purchase 782,830 shares of Enron stock over the next seven years through stock options, according to a company filing, but those grants currently are worthless because of the collapse of Enron's stock price.

Greenspan takes on energy at Rice award presentation 
By SHANNON BUGGS 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
The audience assembled at Rice University Tuesday evening may have wanted a briefing from the world's most influential economist about the U.S. strategy for combating a recession. 
What they got was Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's assessment of the market forces and technology shaping the oil and gas industries. 
Greenspan, chairman of the Fed since 1988, came to Houston to accept the Baker Institute's Enron Prize for Distinguished Public Service. Previous award recipients include Nelson Mandela, former president of South Africa; Mikhail Gorbachev, former president of the Soviet Union; and Colin Powell, U.S. secretary of state. 
However, Greenspan declined the cash and crystal sculpture that accompany the prize. 
It's logical that Greenspan talked about energy, considering the award is named for an energy trading company, the institute is researching energy supply and security issues, and the home of the institute is the world's energy capital. 
"As we, as economic policymakers, understandably focus on the impact of the tragedy of Sept. 11 and the further weakening of the economy that followed those events, it is essential that we do not lose sight of the policies needed to ensure long-term economic growth," Greenspan said. 
"One of the most important objectives of those policies should be an assured availability of energy. That imperative has, if anything, been elevated by the heightened tensions in the Middle East -- an area that harbors two-thirds of the world's proven oil reserves." 
Greenspan reviewed the nation's experiences with seesawing energy prices and episodes of imbalances in supply and demand. He also discussed technologies to augment energy supplies, including coal mining, nuclear power and fusion power. 
"Energy issues present policymakers and citizens with difficult decisions and trade-offs to make outside the market process; as always, national security and environmental concerns need to be addressed in setting policy," Greenspan said. 
At the end of the speech, Greenspan answered pre-selected written queries from the audience of students, faculty and invited guests. One questioner asked if the state of economy caused Greenspan to second-guess his monetary policies. 
Greenspan rephrased the question as to whether or not he had made a mistake. After much rhetoric, he in effect said no. 
"The notion that people have that monetary policy changes one little notch and the economy goes up, clearly has never been the case and is not the case today," Greenspan said. 
The evening ended with James Baker, former U.S. secretary of state and of the treasury, and Ken Lay, head of Enron, presenting Greenspan with the award. 
Rice University officials said it's premature to know whether the name of the Enron Prize will be changed if the sale of Enron to Dynegy is completed. 
Lay indicated the award would live on when he said, "I'm looking forward to our first woman recipient." 


USA: Enron's Lay says no to hefty pay package.
By Andrew Kelly

Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

HOUSTON, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Enron Corp chairman Ken Lay has turned down the chance to cash in on his company's financial troubles by refusing to accept a $60 million payment due him if a proposed buyout by power-trading rival Dynegy Inc goes through, a company spokeswoman said on Tuesday. 
He decided it was not right to take the money under the circumstances now confronting the company, Enron spokeswoman Anne Denne said.
Enron, the nation's top trader of gas and electricity, agreed on Friday to be bought by the much-smaller Dynegy in a stock swap worth about $9 billion after a controversy over questionable business deals had sapped its finances to the point of near-collapse. 
"After having discussions with employees today he decided that this is the right thing to do and he's going to leave it up to the combined company to determine the best use of that money," Denne told Reuters. 
Lay's contract, which runs through 2005, calls for him to get $20.2 million for each full year left in his contract if Enron is taken over by another company. Enron and Dynegy officials have said they expect to complete their merger by the third quarter of next year. 
Denne said the clause, which is known in corporate circles as a "golden parachute," has been in his contract since 1989 and is a "standard provision" for chief executives. 
Denne said Lay told Enron employees of his decision in a company-wide e-mail. 
Enron has been under the gun from Wall Street since mid-October when it said shareholder equity had been cut $1.2 billion because of off-the-balance sheet deals with partnerships run by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. 
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission launched an investigation into the transactions, which sent Enron's stock and credit ratings into a tailspin and drained its cash as trading partners refused to extend credit. 
On Friday, Enron and Dynegy said they had agreed to merge at what seemed a firesale price for Enron, which last year had $100 billion in revenues and $1 billion in earnings. 
Also, on Tuesday night, Lay presented the Enron Prize for Distinguished Public Service to Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan in an event at Rice University in Houston. Previous winners have included the likes of Nelson Mandela and Mikhail Gorbachev. 
Prior to accepting the award, Greenspan told students that the most important thing for anyone in the business world was to be ethical. 
"I don't deny that there is an extraordinary amount of activity in the business community which is less than exemplary...but the best chance you have of making a big success in this world is to decide from square one that you're going to do it ethically," he said.

Enron Chairman Lay Decides to Forgo $60.6 Million Severance Payment

11/14/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Enron Corp. said its chairman, Kenneth Lay, has decided to forgo a severance payment of $60.6 million that could be triggered by Dynegy Inc.'s planned acquisition of Enron, Wednesday's Wall Street Journal reported. 
Mr. Lay's decision capped a day in which he appears to have changed his mind on the matter at least twice.
Early in the day, an Enron filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission laid out Mr. Lay's severance package. By midday, Enron indicated that Mr. Lay would keep only one-third of the payout, which he would take in stock in the combined company, and that he intended to donate one-third to a foundation to help displaced Enron employees. The remaining third would cover income-tax liabilities. 
But by the end of the day, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said that Mr. Lay, following a meeting of Enron energy traders, had decided against taking any of the severance pay. Though Mr. Lay didn't attend the traders' meeting, senior managers told him that "opinions were expressed that he shouldn't receive the payment," Mr. Palmer said. "He decided the cleanest thing to do was to waive the payment." The opinions of traders carry particular weight because they produce most of Enron's profits. Questions for Mr. Lay were directed to Mr. Palmer, who said he had spoken with Mr. Lay and other company officials during the day. 
The initial disclosure about Mr. Lay's hefty severance payment raised new questions about his willingness to sell Enron for a share price that was about a third of the market price of a month ago. Last Friday, Mr. Lay even said that Enron had other options to the Dynegy purchase, which might have allowed the energy company to remain independent, though he declined to elaborate. "Things weren't desperate . . . we had alternatives," Mr. Lay said. The 59-year-old Mr. Lay won't have an executive position at the combined company, though he might be a director. 
For the 12 months ended Aug. 31, Mr. Lay received about $70 million through the exercise of Enron options, according to disclosure reports compiled by Thomson Financial. Last year, Mr. Lay was paid $8.3 million in salary and bonus and more than $10 million in stock awards and other compensation. 
Enron (ENE), the nation's largest energy trader, saw its stock collapse in recent weeks following a series of disclosures about the company's extensive dealings with partnerships run by some of its own officers. Those dealings are under investigation by the SEC. Friday, Enron agreed to be acquired by the far smaller Houston-based Dynegy (DYN) for stock, currently valued at about $10.7 billion. The merger agreement still must be approved by regulators and shareholders of the two companies. 
Separately, the California Public Employees' Retirement System, which owns about three million Enron and 500,000 Dynegy shares, said it would oppose the appointment of any current Enron board member to the board of a combined company. Michael Flaherman, chair of CalPERS investment committee said that it appeared that Enron's board "failed in its responsibility" to monitor the activities of Enron executives.

Enron chairman says he won't take dlrs 60 million compensation package if Dynegy deal closes
By KRISTEN HAYS

HOUSTON (AP) - Enron Corp. Chairman Ken Lay turned down up to dlrs 60.6 million that he stood to receive once the nation's top buyer and seller of natural gas is merged into its smaller, but stronger rival Dynegy Inc. 
"He has told the employees that he has given a lot of thought to this over the last few days and in light of the circumstances surrounding the company and after listening to the employees he has decided the best thing to do is waive his right to the payment," Enron spokesman Vance Meyer said.
Lay decided it best to forego the Enron compensation package after consulting with employees Tuesday. He let those who work for him know of his decision via voicemail. 
Meyer said the compensation package was the only merger-related payment Lay was eligible for from Enron. A Dynegy spokesman, John Sousa, said the company was unsure if Lay could receive a retirement package from them. 
Enron had a conference call scheduled for 1430 GMT. 
Dynegy's purchase of Enron, worth at least dlrs 9.8 billion in stock, would trigger a clause in Lay's contract that gives him a lump sum of dlrs 20.2 million for each full calendar year remaining in his contract if there is a change in control of Enron, according to documents filed Tuesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Lay's contract with Houston-based Enron runs through 2005. 
Dynegy executives have said they hope to complete their acquisition of Enron by next summer. The Houston-based energy marketer will assume dlrs 13 billion of Enron debt. The Enron name will vanish when the deal is completed. 
Investors continued to bid up both companies' shares Tuesday, in the second day of trading following announcement of the deal. Dynegy shares rose dlrs 2.63, or 6 percent, to close at dlrs 44.94 on the New York Stock Exchange, where Enron shares rose 74 cents, or 8 percent, to close at dlrs 9.98. 
Enron shares have gained 17 percent since Thursday, the day before the merger was announced, but the shares are still a fraction of their 52-week high of dlrs 84.87. 
Dynegy entered talks to buy Enron last month as the trading giant's stock price plunged about 80 percent in the weeks following Enron's posting of a dlrs 618 million third quarter loss. The company also disclosed a dlrs 1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity related to partnerships run by company officers, which allowed Enron to keep about half a billion dollars in debt off its books. 
Those partnerships are now under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Enron ousted chief financial officer Andrew Fastow, who ran some of the partnerships, and restated its earnings back to 1997. But those actions failed to restore investor confidence. 
Chuck Watson, Dynegy chairman and chief executive, will retain those roles for the combined company while Lay steps down when the deal is done. 
Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said Tuesday the compensation provision given a merger or other change of control has been in Lay's contract since 1989. Such protections are common for chief executive officers, she said. 
In February, Jeff Skilling replaced Lay as president and CEO of Enron and Lay retained his title as chairman. Lay stepped back into the other roles when Skilling unexpectedly resigned in August, citing personal reasons.

Enron's CEO to turn down $60.6 million severance pay 
By LAURA GOLDBERG 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
Ken Lay, Enron Corp.'s chairman and chief executive, won't take the $60.6 million in severance he would be due after Dynegy closes its deal to buy his troubled company. 
Lay made his decision Tuesday after employees' sentiments about the money were relayed to him, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said. 
At a floor meeting Tuesday for energy traders and marketers and back-office employees to discuss the merger, Lay's severance "was a very active topic apparently," Palmer said, adding that "quite a bit of concern" was expressed. 
Documents on a variety of Enron matters, including Lay's severance, were filed with federal securities regulators Tuesday morning. 
Under his employment contract, if Lay ends his employment within 60 days of a so-called "change of control," he gets a lump-sum payment equal to the number of full calendar years left in his employment contract times $20.2 million. 
The merger was announced Friday, but isn't expected to close for six to nine months. Lay's contract runs through Dec. 31, 2005. 
Palmer said a change-of-control clause had been in Lay's contract since 1989. 
Lay won't have a management role with the combined company to be called Dynegy. He's been offered a seat on the new board, but hasn't decided whether to take it. 
Lay's contract was set to expire on Dec. 31, 2003, but was extended in August after CEO Jeff Skilling unexpectedly resigned and Lay jumped back into his former job as chief executive. 
Declining the money, Palmer said, was the best way for Lay to assure employees that he wouldn't profit from the severance provision. 
Last year, Lay made $18.3 million from various forms of compensation, including a $7 million bonus, according to Enron's March proxy statement. 
He was also awarded options to buy 782,830 shares of Enron stock at specified prices over a number of years. The options, though, are worthless at current Enron stock prices. 
This year through Aug. 21, Lay made $25.5 million by exercising options and selling those shares, Graef Crystal, a compensation expert who writes a column for Bloomberg News, said. 
Lay made an average of $31.5 million a year from 1993 to 2000 in various forms of compensation, including exercising options and selling the shares, Crystal said. 
Dynegy on Friday announced a deal to buy its rival for almost $9 billion in stock plus the assumption of almost $13 billion in debt and $2 billion in preferred stock. 
The price came at bargain-basement rates for a company whose shares as recently as late January closed at $82. Tuesday, shares in Enron closed at $9.98. 
Among Enron's woes: a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation, questions on Wall Street about its financial reporting practices and shareholder lawsuits. 
Investors reacted negatively to word that Lay could get $60.6 million. 
"This is ridiculous after what has happened," said Donald Coxe, who manages the Harris Insight Equity Fund, which at the end of last month owned about 78,000 shares of Enron. "The idea that there would be a golden parachute for somebody who as a parachute captain sent his stockholders out of the plane without a parachute strikes me as pretty odd." 
Even before Tuesday, Lay had other ideas for the severance. 
Early last week, Palmer said Lay proposed to Chuck Watson, Dynegy's chairman and chief executive, that he get two-thirds of what he was due in a noncash payment, such as stock in the merged company. 
With half of the noncash payment, Lay wanted to set up a foundation to provide assistance to Enron employees in need. 
A significant portion of the rest, according to his plan, would have been cash to cover taxes. 
Dynegy declined immediate comment about Lay's Tuesday decision. 
But Carol Coale, an analyst with Prudential Securities in Houston, quipped: "That might stave off one shareholder lawsuit."

Enron offers reasons for selling to Dynegy 
Underperforming assets, heavy debt cited 
By LAURA GOLDBERG 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
Among Enron Corp.'s reasons for agreeing to be bought out by rival Dynegy: Underperforming assets were draining cash and earnings, and debt load was stretching the company. 
That Enron faced a loss of confidence from financial markets and departures of some senior executives also played into the decision, documents filed by Enron on Tuesday with federal securities regulators said. 
Before agreeing to a merger with Dynegy, Enron also considered staying independent, an infusion of private equity and an infusion from a strategic partner. 
Friday, the two companies announced Dynegy would buy Enron for almost $9 billion in stock plus the assumption of almost $13 billion in debt and $2 billion in preferred stock. 
Under the deal, Enron shareholders get 0.2685 share of Dynegy per Enron share. The ratio is subject to "downward revision" under certain circumstances, the documents said. 
Also, ChevronTexaco, a Dynegy shareholder, gave Dynegy $1.5 billion. Dynegy on Tuesday injected that money into Enron, aiming to shore up its core energy trading operation. 
In return for the money, Dynegy gets preferred stock and other rights in Enron's Northern Natural Gas pipeline system. If the deal doesn't close, Dynegy could buy all of Northern Natural Gas, which includes about 17,000 miles of natural gas pipeline. 
The filings say Dynegy's right to buy Northern Natural Gas is first subject to a right of Enron to repurchase Northern Natural Gas. If the merger should not close, Dynegy, under certain circumstances, has the option instead to convert its stake in Northern Natural Gas to Enron stock. 
Also of note in the documents: 
? Enron will finish its second downtown office tower, now under construction, and will keep moving employees into the new building "at this time." 
? The merged company will assume the "rights and obligations" under Enron's naming-rights deal for Enron Field. 
Enron also made filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission concerning agreements announced Nov. 1 to get $1 billion in credit lines from J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup. 
The filing detailed a provision in those agreements that, based on Enron's current credit rating, would have prevented it from tapping those lines. An Enron spokesman said Tuesday the banks have waived that provision. 
Also Tuesday, Enron said it named company executive Raymond Bowen Jr. as treasurer to replace Ben Glisan, who was fired last week. 
Dynegy stock continued its upward movement Tuesday, closing $2.63 higher at $46.94.

HOUSTON -- Enron Corp. chairman and chief executive officer Kenneth Lay stands to receive up to $60.6-million (U.S.) once the top buyer and seller of natural gas in the United States is merged into its smaller, but stronger rival Dynegy Inc. 
Dynegy's purchase of Enron, worth at least $9.8-billion in stock, would trigger a clause in Mr. Lay's contract that gives him a lump sum of $20.2-million for each full calendar year remaining in his contract if there is a change in control of Enron, according to documents filed yesterday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Mr. Lay's contract with Houston-based Enron runs through 2005. 
Dynegy executives have said they hope to complete their acquisition of Enron by next summer. The Houston-based energy marketer will assume $13-billion of Enron debt. The Enron name will vanish when the deal is completed. 
"That's a ridiculous amount of money for a man who's already made himself probably tens of millions of dollars," said Andrew Whalley, manager of the Legg Mason International Utilities Trust, which sold a $5-million stake in Enron in April because of concern about its bookkeeping. 
"It's a classic golden parachute," said Raymond James analyst Jon Kyle Cartwright, noting that it is comparable to financial safety nets in other top corporate contracts. 
But shareholders might not appreciate the parachute given the once-mighty company's recent troubles, Mr. Cartwright said. 
"That's a tough call," he said. "It certainly would have been fair if you had been looking at Enron up to a couple of months ago. Following that it gets dicey, and I'm not sure how shareholders are going to take it." 
Investors continued to bid up both companies' shares yesterday in the second day of trading following announcement of the deal. Dynegy shares rose $2.63, or 6 per cent, to close at $44.94 on the New York Stock Exchange, where Enron shares rose 74 cents, or 8 per cent, to close at $9.98. 
Enron shares have gained 17 per cent since Thursday, the day before the merger was announced, but the shares are still a fraction of their 52-week high of $84.87. 
Dynegy entered talks to buy Enron last month as the trading giant's stock price plunged about 80 per cent in the weeks following Enron's posting of a $618-million third-quarter loss. The company also disclosed a $1.2-billion reduction in shareholder equity related to partnerships run by company officers, which allowed Enron to keep about half a billion dollars in debt off its books. 
Those partnerships are now under investigation by the SEC. 
Enron ousted chief financial officer Andrew Fastow, who ran some of the partnerships, and restated its earnings back to 1997. But those actions failed to restore investor confidence. 
Chuck Watson, Dynegy chairman and CEO, will retain those roles for the combined company while Mr. Lay steps down. 
Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel declined comment yesterday on Mr. Lay's agreement with Enron, noting that the companies will operate independently until the merger is finished. 
Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said yesterday the compensation provision given a merger or other change of control has been in Mr. Lay's contract since 1989. 
In February, Jeff Skilling replaced Mr. Lay as president and CEO of Enron and Mr. Lay retained his title as chairman. Mr. Lay stepped back into the other roles when Mr. Skilling unexpectedly resigned in August, citing personal reasons.

City - Enron chief in line for $60m payout.
By Andrew Cave.

Associate City Editor 
KENNETH Lay, chairman and chief executive of Enron, is in line for compensation of more than $60m ( #42m) if he leaves the US company following its $8 billion rescue by its smaller rival Dynegy.
According to documents filed with America's Securities & Exchange Commission, Mr Lay is entitled to receive a lump sum payment equal to $20.2m for every year remaining on his contract. His contract expires at the end of 2005, while Dynegy's takeover of Enron, announced on Friday, is due to be completed in the third quarter of next year. 
The contract was extended by two years in August, when he resumed chief executive duties following the departure of Jeffrey Skilling. It provides that, in addition to his compensation, he will receive an extra amount to cover tax penalties if the sum he gets is considered to be an "excess parachute payment". 
Enron, once valued at $80 billion, has seen its shares lose 80pc in the past three weeks after announcing a $586m loss, an equity write-down and a regulatory inquiry into off balance sheet dealings.

MARK TO MARKET: Retail Sales To Surge On Free Money
By Jim Murphy

11/14/2001
Capital Markets Report
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Professionals and amateurs alike agree that at 8:30 a.m. EST the Commerce Department will report that U.S. retail sales rose in October.
Some observers believe that retail sales not only rose last month, but that they surged - 5.5% being the top of the forecast range. 
All again agree that the main stimulant was the zero-percent financing offered by the major automakers. 
In September, sadness and other negative emotions engendered by the events of 9/11 helped to fashion a 2.4% drop in overall retail sales and a 1.6% decline when auto sales were excluded. 
The Dow Jones Newswires median forecast of 21 economists has it that overall retail sales rose 2.5% in October, while they were ahead only 0.4% when auto sales were excluded. 
While it is difficult to believe that any market will move lower in response to a notable improvement in retail sales, the most compelling ways in which the report can be "spun" are all negative. 
A few examples. The October increase will be from a depressed September level. 
Yes, October retail sales were goosed by zero-percent financing, but November won't get such a lift even though the zero-percent sales campaign isn't over yet. 
That's because even if "free" money lured me out of my shell and into the showroom in October, it will have no effect on me in November or in December. I already bought a new car. Unless I'm a rich collector, that's it for at least year or two. 
The more metaphysical of commentators will also note that many October car sales spurred by zero-percent financing were "in a very real sense" stolen from subsequent months. Without "free" money, I might, for example, have waited until April of 2002 before buying a new car. 
Then, too, there is the cost to the automakers of the zero-interest loans. GM's General Motors Acceptance Corp., which finances the parent's cars, will remain a profit center, but it won't be from auto loans made in October. 
I'll leave the summing to a professional (because I agree with him). 
"Retail sales probably reversed the plunge in September, although mainly because of a spike in autos that is unlikely to be sustained for more than one month," said Jim O'Sullivan, economist at UBS Warburg. 

Vienna Meeting Overshadowed 

Oil ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Ministers began meeting today in Vienna. 
Most oil traders are looking for them to cut daily output by around 1.5 million barrels. But who ever really knows with OPEC, which I have cleverly punned, more than once, into opaque. 
Besides there's a war going on in Afghanistan and oil-rich Iraq may be next - and who knows but that the House of Saud won't be toppled by Islamic fundamentalists. To name but a few topics that are more compelling than a periodic quota buck-and-wing by OPEC. 

Would You Believe The Enron Award? 

I told you in Tuesday's mornings M2M that I failed after searching for an hour to find out what Fed Chairman Greenspan was doing at Rice University Tuesday evening. 
Wouldn't you just know it? I found out this morning what Mr. Greenspan was doing in a dispatch from the Associated Press. He went to Rice to receive the Enron Prize for Distinguished Public Service from the University's Baker Institute for Public Policy. Enron will be taken over by Dynegy Inc. So this will probably be the final Enron award, and no I'm not going to avail myself of a handy invitation to irony. 
Mr. Greenspan had some things of interest to say to the folks at Rice, but none that we haven't heard from him before. Such as, " ... there is no evidence that we have, in this process of events since March of the year 2000, significantly altered the long-term underlying structure of productivity growth." 
With all due respect, Al, productivity growth is not likely to be exponential as in a nuclear reaction, but appears tied to earth by the Law of Diminishing Returns. 
The big guy is on the stump again today. 
Mr. Greenspan gives the keynote address at an "economic forum" in Washington D.C. sponsored by the board of directors of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
Dow Jones Newswires says the speech begins at 3:00 p.m. EST. That's our story and we're sticking to it. 
Another major wire service says, depending on which calendar or story you look at, that the speech begins at both 3:00 p.m. and 3:15 p.m. In this business, mistakes are made. 
Anyhow, no big deal. If you might need to hear what the big guy might say just begin paying attention at 3:00 p.m.

Just stick it out or be a sucker
Abracadabra / Shubhrangshu Roy

11/14/2001
The Economic Times
Copyright (C) 2001 The Economic Times; Source: World Reporter (TM)

YOU move a step forward and you are a sucker, you move a step backward and you are a sucker still. That just about sums up Indias predicament in trying to get one-time US energy trading giant Enron off its back and off the 2,100 MW Dabhol power plant for some time now. 
For the past fortnight or so, the institutions have been bargaining hard to find a buyer for Enrons assets in Maharashtra, having committed over Rs 6,200 crore in loans. Last weekend, they even went into a huddle in Singapore to sew up the loose ends of a bail-out.
Little seems to have been thrashed out so far. Little possibly will. Unless, of course, the FIs tighten the screws with a take-it or leave-it offer. The time to make that choice is now. 
A gentleman in pin-stripes whos done a lot of running around these past few weeks to help sew up the deal, told me the other day that Enron had indeed agreed to part with its stake in DPC at a 30 per cent discount. 
That would have fetched it just about $800-odd million spread over a five-year period. So, why hasnt a deal been struck? 
Its probably not worked out because of what Enron considers a fair discount on what it has sunk into the project. Prospective buyers consider this too high an asking price. 
For the record, Enron claims to have sunk in $1.2 billion in the project together with its partners GE and Bechtel who have supplied equipment and helped construct the plant. 
But my gentleman friend in pin-stripes suggests that $1.2 billion isnt exactly their equity contribution in Dabhol. That amount works out to just about $800 million. 
Enron, actually splurged close to $200 million on development expenses, which in gentlemens lingo is another way of saying that the energy giant could have ended up bribing its way to see the once coveted project through besides fighting sundry court cases in India. 
And it wants part of that money back. Now which prospective buyer will compensate Enron for possible bribes or for making court appearances? 
Enron, it appears, has also claimed another $140 million as its share of Dabhols retained earnings, which should eventually go to all stake-holders in DPC (the MSEB included) once the companys board passes a resolution that the amount is shared proportionately among all those who have invested in Dabhols equity capital. Till then, leave the retained earnings aside. 
So, what Enron should work on is a fair discount on its equity contribution in the project, which is no more than $800 million. Now given its willingness to take a 30 per cent knock, Enron should not expect more than $560 million as the asking price for walking out of Dabhol. 
Add to that, if you will, another $140 million by way of retained earnings and Enron should not be getting more than $700 million at the most. Is Enron willing to take this knock? 
Given a choice, it could resist this offer. But Enron has no choice. And thats reason for cheer. Last week, Enron, close to the present American dispensation (chairman Ken Lay was the biggest fund-raiser for President George Bushs campaign effort last year) opted for a $7.8 billion rescue offer from smaller Houston rival Dynegy after narrowly escaping credit ratings cut to junk status. 
For the past several months Enron had been using its clout with Mr Bush to push through a bail-out package on Dabhol that suited its terms. That privilege now seems to be gone as the company grapples to stave off a Securities Exchange Commission inquiry into off-balancesheet transactions. 
And until Enron clears several questions back home about its finances, it will remain suspect in the eyes of US investors. 
In India, where Enrons made more news for its misses than its hits, the timing couldnt have been more opportune than now for prospective private bidders to strike a potentially lucrative deal. 
Two such bidders, Tata Power and BSES, are said to have offered no more than $400 million to buy out Enrons stake in DPC. Its time they stuck to that price. Or else, we could still end up being suckers. What?

Deal made; now Dynegy must make it work
David Greising

11/14/2001
Chicago Tribune
North Sports Final ; N
1
(Copyright 2001 by the Chicago Tribune)

When three top Enron Corp. executives proposed a merger to one of his lieutenants two weeks ago, no one needed to tell Chuck Watson that Enron was desperate. 
The founder and chairman of Dynegy Inc. is a wily old energy trader. He can smell desperate two oil fields away. Or three city blocks away, as was the case between these Houston rivals.
A liquidity crisis threatened to reduce Enron's credit rating to junk status. Wall Street analysts were hostile after disclosures about conflicts of interest and huge losses on outside trading partnerships. Investors had fled. 
When the approach came, Watson didn't jump. He sat. He sent word to have Enron Chief Executive Kenneth Lay call him if the offer was serious. 
A nice negotiating move, for sure. Watson put the seller at a minor tactical disadvantage. But Watson adds a kindlier spin: He didn't want to appear to be pouncing on Enron's troubles. 
Two weeks of negotiations and demi-due-diligence later, Watson and Lay had their deal. Dynegy would buy Enron, a company three times its size, in a $24 billion deal. 
Watson takes satisfaction that Dynegy, the company that was always smaller and stodgier than Enron, became the buyer. Most of his career, Watson has operated in Enron's shadow. 
The two companies were formed the same year, 1985. After 15 years at Conoco, Watson persuaded Morgan Stanley to give him a line of credit to form a small energy trading company. Lay, meanwhile, engineered the merger of Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth of Omaha. 
"Ken put two pipelines together to make that company. I had six people and a smile," Watson told me during the Chicago stop of an East Coast-to-Texas barnstorming to sell the deal to investors. 
Enron was always the bigger glamor play. Lay's move from a base of trading natural gas and electric power into the engineering of exotic financial deals in areas as diverse as communications bandwidth, paper, steel and media won a huge Wall Street following and doubled Enron's stock price last year, to above $80 a share. 
Dynegy by contrast seemed downright dull. Though it dabbled in broadband communications, Dynegy stuck mainly to the business of generating, trading and delivering gas and electricity. Though Dynegy's stock price nearly quadrupled last year to $59, Dynegy never turned heads the way Enron did. 
Today, Enron has no friends left. The messy breakdown of Enron's trades with outside partnerships has forced it into Dynegy's embrace. Watson thinks Wall Street went hard on Enron because of the company's high-handed manner when it was on top. "If you have that personality and things go wrong, I mean, everybody's going to take your legs off," Watson says. 
This would be a tidy tortoise-and-hare tale except for one thing: Enron's problems are such a mess, they could make for rough going at Dynegy, too. 
Watson thinks he has protected himself. He can walk from the deal if Enron's legal entanglements exceed $3.5 billion. If, on the other hand, Enron's problems don't get worse and other bidders emerge, he gets a healthy $350 million break-up fee and ownership of a key Enron pipeline. 
That's better than nothing. But it's hardly a failsafe. Some Enron trades with the outside partnerships don't unwind for years, so problems might not emerge until after Dynegy has closed its deal. 
There are more mainstream challenges, too. 
Roughly half of Enron's operating profits last year came from off- balance sheet transactions Watson wants to eliminate. Replacing that won't be easy. And Watson needs to handle at least $14 billion in Enron debt. 
Enron's high rollers might not fit into Dynegy's careful culture. Watson's team also must stretch to run a company that, even with divestitures, will jump to at least three times Dynegy's current size. 
Watson's personality can be aw-shucks disarming. Born at Great Lakes Naval Air Station in Illinois, the son of a Navy officer, he lived in 22 places before he graduated high school. Now, if he closes the deal, he'll be running one of the country's largest companies. 
No one would get a kick from taking Watson down a notch. But that hardly means investors won't knock him if he can't make the Enron deal work.

Dynegy defends merger partner ; CEO says Enron errors not illegal
Melita Marie Garza, Tribune staff reporter

Chicago Tribune
North Sports Final ; N

(Copyright 2001 by the Chicago Tribune)

The downfall of energy-trading titan Enron Corp. was the result of "bad business practices" rather than illegal activity, says Chuck Watson, chief executive of Dynegy Inc., the company acquiring Enron in a deal valued at $24 billion. 
"I'm not persuaded that you'll find anything illegal," Watson said Tuesday, commenting on the Securities and Exchange Commission's probe into Enron's off-balance sheet transactions in energy partnerships.
Watson's comments came as Enron, in a filing with the SEC, disclosed that Kenneth Lay, the company's chairman and chief executive, could walk away with a golden parachute worth more than $80 million if the merger succeeds. Under terms of a pre-existing employment contract, Lay would receive $20.2 million a year for each full year outstanding on his contract if control of Enron changes hands during his employment. 
At the same time, Enron issued a letter to employees warning that the deal with Dynegy was likely to result in workforce reductions at Enron. "As with any merger," the letter said, "some elimination of positions is almost inevitable." 
Enron, the nation's largest trader of natural gas and electricity, has seen its stock price collapse in recent weeks largely because of soured transactions with energy partnerships run by one of its former executives and additional revelations about questionable accounting practices at Enron. 
Power-trading rival Dynegy, owner of downstate utility Illinois Power, moved last week to acquire its hobbled competitor, agreeing to pay the equivalent of about $10 a share for a company that as recently as last January traded above $80 a share. 
In a wide-ranging interview, Watson criticized the practice at Dynegy of permitting Enron executives to sit on the partnership boards and profit from them. "You don't let that happen," Watson said. "It would never have gotten by me." 
Watson sees the distinction between illegal conduct and bad judgment at Enron as significant because the absence of illegality would minimize grounds for shareholder lawsuits. 
Dynegy has said the merger is contingent on litigation costs over Enron's problems staying under $3.5 billion. "I don't think it's going to be anywhere near that level," Watson said. 
Enron's misfortunes, Watson said, paved the way for Dynegy's opportunity. "This is all about brand," he said. "They lost credibility and investor confidence." 
Dynegy's takeover of its higher-profile rival is a coup for Dynegy, which has been viewed by some as an "Enron wannabe." But Watson brushed off the description. "That's actually not true," Watson said. "It's clearly not true now." 
Watson asserted that nothing had gone wrong with Enron's core businesses. That fact, he said, had been lost--by investors and potential Enron suitors--in the controversy surrounding the off- balance sheet transactions. 
"Maybe the tires fell off the car and the paint was chipped, but the engine was still strong," Watson said, referring to Enron's core businesses. 
In an apparent conundrum, Dynegy's bid for Enron at what is viewed as a bargain basement price has not brought any other companies to the bargaining table. Enron's problems reportedly scared off some prospective bidders, such as Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. 
Watson argued that Dynegy was uniquely positioned to pursue the Enron deal, in large part because the rivals had extensive business dealings together. 
"It took our guys days--not months--to do due diligence," Watson said. "We were right there in town. It was the time factor, the knowledge that we had of the industry and the business." 
For example, Watson said Shell Oil Co., another company thought to have an interest in acquiring Enron, would not have had the background to move as quickly as Dynegy had in putting together the merger. 
While saying that he had respect for the regulatory approval process, Watson reiterated his belief that the merger posed no antitrust concerns. "We don't have a pipeline business, they do," Watson said. "They don't have a generation business, we do."

PASADENA, Calif., Nov 13 (Reuters) - The largest U.S. pension fund said on Tuesday the board of energy trader Enron Corp should step aside if the company moves forward with its plans to be bought by Dynegy Inc 
The California Public Employees Retirement System (Calpers) said it would oppose any efforts by Enron to place its current board members on the new board of a company resulting from the proposed $9 billion stock-swap merger announced on Friday.
Calpers owns about 3 million Enron shares, or about 0.4 percent of all shares outstanding. However, the public pension fund is widely watched for its stances on corporate governance. 
The merger would value Houston-based Enron at a fraction of what it was worth a year ago. The shares have lost 89 percent of their value over the past 52 weeks. 
A spokesman from Calpers and a spokeswoman from Enron could not be reached for comment. 
In declaring its position on the merger, Calpers cited reports that Enron was seeking the right to appoint three of its current board members to the combined company's board. 
Enron in recent weeks has reshuffled its management in response to a U.S. regulatory probe into murky financial transactions. The company has said that former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, who abruptly left the company last month, had made $30 million managing limited partnerships that conducted outside transactions with Enron. 
"There have been serious allegations of self-dealing on the part of Enron's senior management," Michael Flaherman, chair of Calpers Investment Committee, said after a meeting of the pension's administrative board. "And it appears that Enron's board may have failed in its responsibility to monitor the activities of Enron's corporate officers." 
"Until all of these issues are sorted out," he continued, "the interests of shareholders are best served by retiring all of the current directors from involvement in Enron's successor entities." 
California state officials and Enron clashed last year over the state's power crisis, which triggered the bankruptcy of California's largest utility Pacific Gas & Electric, a unit of San Francisco-based PG&E Corp 
California Gov. Gray Davis and others blasted Enron and other state power companies, accusing them of manipulating the market and jacking up prices. 
Enron is by far the largest trader of electricity and natural gas in the United States, with analysts estimating it is involved in some 25 percent of the daily trades in those markets. 
Calpers said it also has a stake in Houston-based Dynegy but it did not provide details on that investment.

Enron CEO helps present Greenspan award

HOUSTON (AP) - Maybe they'll call it the Dynegy Prize next time. 
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was in Houston on Tuesday night to pick up the Enron Prize for Distinguished Public Service, an award named for the teetering energy company that is being bought by rival Dynegy Inc. for about $9 billion.
At one point Greenspan expounded on the values of ethicism to the Rice University crowd while Ken Lay, whose company has been blasted on Wall Street for concealing transactions with entities run by the company's chief financial officer, looked on. 
"My experience is that it really works to be as ethical as possible as one knows and to define one's values in a very succinct and important way," Greenspan said when asked by a pending college graduate about venturing into the work world. 
Lay, in his first major public appearance since the merger announcement, was met with warm applause and made some brief congratulatory remarks. 
No mention was made of Enron's current woes or Lay's decision earlier in the day to waive about $60 million he would be due as the merger closes. 
Past winners of the Enron Prize, awarded by the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice, include Colin Powell, Nelson Mandela and Mikhail Gorbachev.

CalPERS Opposes Enron Board Members' Appt To Dynegy Board

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The board of the California Public Employees' Retirement System Tuesday said it will oppose the appointment of any current Enron Corp (ENE) board member to a board created by the planned merger of Enron and Dynegy, Inc (DYN), a CalPERS spokesman said. 
"There have been serious allegations of self-dealing on the part of Enron's senior management," said Michael Flaherman, Chair of CalPERS Investment Committee, in a release. "And it appears Enron's board may have failed in its responsibility to monitor the activities of Enron's corporate officers. Until all of these issues are sorted out, the interests of shareholders are best served by retiring all of the current directors from involvement in Enron's successor entities."
Calpers holds 3 million shares in Enron and a $500 million stake in an Enron partnership called Joint Energy Development Investments II. 
Dynegy announced Friday its plans to buy Enron for $8.85 billion. As part of the deal, Enron would be able to appoint at least three members to the board of the combined company. Enron Chairman and CEO Kenneth Lay was offered a seat on the new board, but has not yet said if he will accept. 
Concerns about Enron's dealings with off-balance sheet partnerships like JEDI II drove the company's stock price down 80% in the three weeks before the merger was announced. Its credit ratings were also downgraded to one level above junk. 
On Oct. 30, California state Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, wrote CalPERS Chief Executive James Burton urging the pension fund to take steps to defend its investment in Enron. 
"CalPERS may play a significantly larger and more active role in the governance of Enron to ensure that Enron directors do not have conflicting interests, that Enron adheres to a policy of full financial disclosure and transparency and that Enron's board is comprised of a substantial majority of truly independent directors who understand their accountability to shareholders," Peace wrote. 
CalPERs, the nation's largest public pension fund with assets totaling $151 billion, has a strong history of shareholder activism. It was not immediately known if the board would take any additional action regarding Enron, a spokesman said.

Jesse Jackson Asks Energy Companies to Hire More Minorities

11/13/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Associated Press 
HOUSTON -- The energy industry has an untapped resource in minorities who traditionally have been overlooked by big business, including the energy sector, the Rev. Jesse Jackson said Tuesday.
Mr. Jackson has been in Houston -- dubbed the nation's energy capital -- for two days, bringing together more than 700 representatives of minority-owned businesses with those running some of the nation's largest energy companies at his inaugural Wall Street Project Energy Summit. 
"We do not have a talent shortage," Mr. Jackson told the minority business owners who sat in on a discussion with representatives from Enron Corp. (ENE), Dynegy Inc. (DYN) and Shell Oil Co. (RD). "We have an opportunity shortage." 
Mr. Jackson, speaking at a hotel just down the street from the headquarters of troubled Enron, said now was the time for minorities to make their presence known with the proposed Dynegy purchase of Enron, its larger rival. He said spinoff companies and other opportunities created by the proposed merger, as well as deregulation of the Texas energy market, offer possibilities for those who possess knowledge of the changing industry. 
"The question is not 'Can we produce?' The question is 'Can they see our capacity to produce,'" Mr. Jackson said. "We are a knowledgeable people. We have a low profile, but we have a place in the industry." 
Energy company representatives agreed. The question for them, however, was how to change what has become business as usual, they said. 
"Most CEOs who do business in corporate America are comfortable with who they do business with," said Milton Scott, Dynegy's chief administrative officer and senior vice president. "Many of them are not inherently racist." 
"I would call it racism 10 years ago," Mr. Jackson replied. "Today I would call it cultural blindness and part of our job is to take the patch off their eye." 
Gaurdie Bannister, Shell Oil's vice president of business development, said there are a number of individuals in large companies who are willing to "break eggs" with minority-owned businesses but often run into roadblocks because those companies are unable to cushion a large risk that would be taken, for example, in an offshore project. 
"If you are not big and you don't have the capital to take that risk with me, I can't use you," he said. 
Mr. Scott said a way for smaller minority-owned businesses to get around such obstacles and get the big contracts is to combine their strengths. 
"Join forces," he said. "Set your egos aside and you are going to have a lot more success because then you take away some of the risk." 
Reducing risk isn't the goal, Mr. Jackson said. Instead, it's a level playing field for everyone.

PASADENA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 13, 2001--The California Public Employees' Retirement System's Board of Administration was briefed today about Enron's financial condition and recent disclosures of potential management conflicts of interest. 
At the end of the meeting, the Board announced its intention to oppose the appointment of any current Enron Board member to the Board of any company with which Enron might be contemplating a merger.

Enron Names Raymond Bowen Treasurer

Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) named Raymond M. Bowen, Jr., treasurer and executive vice president-finance, replacing Ben Glisan, who was fired last week. 
In a press release Wednesday, the energy company said Bowen had been serving as chief operating officer of Enron Industrial Markets.
Last week, Enron, in the midst of heavy scrutiny over its finances and talks regarding a possible acquisition of Dynegy Inc. (DYN), announced plans to restate its financial statements for the past few years to account for losses related to a number of limited partnerships, including several under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
The company also said it had fired two executives - Glisan, managing director and treasurer, and Kristina Mordaunt, managing director and general counsel - for their supposed involvement with the limited partnerships formed by Enron's then chief financial officer Andrew Fastow. 
Fastow earned as much as $30 million through his role with the partnerships, while a number of other Enron employees also invested in them personally. 
The other employees involved, including executives Michael Kopper, Kathy Lynn and Anne Yeager, no longer worked for Enron.

USA: Enron names Raymond Bowen treasurer.

(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

HOUSTON, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. , which in recent weeks has reshuffled its management in response to a U.S. regulatory probe into murky transactions, said on Tuesday it named Raymond Bowen treasurer and vice-president of finance. 
The troubled energy trader said Bowen previously served as both chief operating officer of Enron Industrial Markets and treasurer of Enron Capital & Trade Resources.
Houston-based Enron has shed almost $20 billion in market value in the past month and has sufferend a series of credit rating downgrades as a result of the probe. On Friday, smaller rival Dynegy Inc. said it would buy out the beleaguered company for about $9 billion. 
Enron shares rose 75 cents to close at $9.99 Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.

USA: Enron earnings restatement a sign of deceit-suits.
By David Howard Sinkman

11/13/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Lawyers filing lawsuits against Enron Corp. on Tuesday said the restatement last week of more than four years of earnings is a clear sign the energy trader and its chief executives misled investors. 
At least 10 law firms are seeking class action status on behalf of plaintiffs they said were deceived by false and misleading statements or because adverse information was concealed, causing Enron's shares to be artificially inflated.
"Enron restating its earnings is certainly going to help our case. It demonstrates that in their opinion their earnings were false when initially published," said lawyer Arthur Stock of Berger & Montague PC in Philadelphia, one of the law firms seeking class-action status. 
Enron declined to comment. 
The lawsuits name the company, Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay, former CEO Jeffrey Skilling and Andrew Fastow, a former chief financial officer, as defendants. 
In another blow to its damaged reputation among investors, the Houston-based company last week admitted it erred in reporting past results. It reduced its earnings from 1997 to 2000 by $591 million, or 22 percent of the amount that had previously been released on its financial statements. Earnings for the first two quarters of 2001 also were restated. 
Enron has garnered investor ire since it unexpectedly reduced shareholder equity by $1.2 billion in mid-October, saying off-balance sheet transactions had contributed to that and to $1 billion in charges. 
The company's stock plunged as almost daily developments sullied investors. It lost almost 80 percent of value from the day the company reported its first quarterly loss in more than four years on Oct. 16, to the announcement last week that rival Dynegy Inc. would buy Enron for about $9 billion in stock and the assumption of about $13 billion in debt. 
Enron shares closed Tuesday 75 cents higher at $9.99 on the New York Stock Exchange, far off its August 2000 high of $90.56. 
INCREASED TIME FRAME 
In the latest lawsuit to be filed against Enron since it was rocked by a U.S. regulatory probe in October, the law firm of Cauley Geller Bowman & Coates said misrepresentations and omissions by the defendants violated their duty to release accurate and truthful information on the company's finances. 
"Each of the defendants is liable as a participant in a fraudulent scheme and course of business that operated as a fraud or deceit on purchasers of Enron common stock by disseminating materially false and misleading statements," said Cauley Geller in a lawsuit filed in Texarkana, Texas. 
The suit was filed Nov. 9, the day after the restated earnings were released, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. 
Prior to the restatement of results, prompted by concerns raised by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the lawsuits filed against Enron were on the behalf of shareholders who bought common stock between Jan. 18, 2000 and Oct. 17. 
However, since Enron restated its results, Cauley Geller increased the time frame, or "class period" on behalf of investors who bought Enron stock, from Jan. 18, 1999 to Nov. 8. 
"The effect of the restatement was dramatic," said Cauley Geller. "Enron insiders disposed of over $73 million of their personally held Enron common stock to unsuspecting investors." 
Cauley Geller said selling of Enron stock by key executives was "unusual and suspicious given its timing." Lay sold $11.2 million worth of shares during the period, and Skilling sold $6.41 million in stock, the law firm said. 
"People who have lost hundreds of thousands of dollars are naturally angry, Stock said. "It is expected in this type of situation." 
In a filing with the SEC on Tuesday, it was reported Lay could walk away with more than $80 million if the acquisiton by Dnyegy closes this year.

USA: S&P says Dynegy deal saves Enron from junk rating.
By Nancy Leinfuss

11/13/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. , teetering on the brink of junk status, got a reprieve late Friday when Standard & Poor's cut the troubled energy trading company's credit ratings but stopped a notch short of the speculative-grade category, after news of its potential acquisition by Dynegy Inc. 
"The way to look at the Dynegy transaction is it really in a sense maintains the investment-grade quality to Enron's credit rating," said Todd Shipman, analyst at S&P. "It's safe to say that absent a Dynegy deal, Enron was quite likely to end up non-investment-grade quality because of what had happened," Shipman said.
Enron, the nation's largest energy trader, has been struggling to overcome a plummeting stock price and falling credit ratings in the past month following disclosures of off-balance sheet deals now under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for possible conflict of interest. 
S&P lowered its long-term corporate credit rating on Enron to BBB-minus from BBB, its lowest investment-grade rating. A cut below that, to junk, would make it tougher for Enron to issue debt and run its day-to-day business. 
The rating agency also placed the ratings of Dynegy on creditwatch negative after the energy provider said it had agreed to acquire Enron for about $9.5 billion. 
Terms of the Dynegy transaction call for Dynegy to swap 0.2685 shares of its own stock for each Enron share, the companies said. That would value Houston-based Enron at $10.41 per share, including convertible stock, a premium of about 21 percent over Friday's closing price of $8.63. 
The takeover announcement halted a free-fall in Enron's stock, which has lost about 75 percent of its market capitalization in the past month. On Tuesday,, Enron shares closed at $9.99, up $0.75 cents, or 8.12 percent, on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Enron's debt, which has been trading at levels associated with higher-risk junk bonds, moved higher on the news. The company's 7.875 percent notes due 2003 were traded at 92 cents on the dollar, up from the mid-80's range last week, traders said. 
Industry experts said the most critical component of the deal was an immediate cash infusion by Dynegy shareholder ChevronTexaco into Enron. 
ChevronTexaco, which owns a 27 percent stake in Dynegy, has agreed to infuse $1.5 billion immediately into Enron to support it until the deal closes. It would inject another $1 billion into the merged company once the deal closes. 
"That was an important part of that whole deal, not just Dynegy coming in and offering money to buy Enron out, but also providing that up-front liquidity to protect the value of Enron's trading business, which is really the crown jewel, so to speak, that Dynegy is interested in," said Shipman. 
S&P said Dynegy's corporate credit rating is likely to remain within the BBB category, as a result of its purchase of Enron, "We saw an investment-grade company, within a range of BBB-plus to BBB." said Shipman. "If things go as planned, Dynegy would keep its credit rating." 
S&P said it will continue to monitor the planned acquisition by Dynegy of Enron and warned that a downgrade to junk status for Enron would be likely if the transaction is not completed. 
"The main thing we'll be monitoring at this point is Enron's liquidity and the value of its trading franchise, because that's really what Dynegy is interested in," said Shipman. 
"If there were to be an effect on Enron's trading business that would be significant enough to reduce Dynegy's interest in Enron, that would raise the possibility that the merger would not be completed, then the possibility of downgrade would be very strong for Enron," Shipman said. 
Moody's Investors Service, another major U.S. rating agency, could not immediately be reached for comment on any potential rating actions after news of Enron's buyout by Dynegy. Moody's rates Enron debt in line with S&P, at "Baa3," its lowest investment-grade rating. 
Enron, with $100 billion in revenues and $1 billion in profits last year, is fifth on Fortune 500's list of largest U.S. companies. Dynegy, 54th on the Fortune list, had $29 billion in revenues and $500 million in earnings.

Enron's Board Should Step Aside From New Company, Calpers Says
2001-11-14 00:22 (New York)

Enron's Board Should Step Aside From New Company, Calpers Says

     Pasadena, California, Nov. 13 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s
board should not be allowed to stay if Dynegy Inc. completes its
proposed purchase of the energy trader, the California Public
Employees' Retirement System said.

     Calpers, which owns about 3 million Enron shares, said it
intends to oppose any such appointments because the company's
board failed to properly monitor Enron's senior management. Fund
officials couldn't immediately be reached for comment on a press
release distributed by Business Wire.

     Enron partnerships run by the company's former chief
financial officer, Andrew Fastow, are being investigated by the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The entities bought and sold
Enron shares and assets. Enron ousted Fastow in October.

     ``Until all of these issues are sorted out, the interests of
shareholders are best served by retiring all of the current
directors from involvement in Enron's successor entities,''
Michael Flaherman, chair of Calpers Investment Committee, said in
the statement.

     Calpers is the country's largest public pension fund.

     Enron shares rose 74 cents to $9.98. Dynegy shares rose $2.63
to $46.94. Both companies are based in Houston.

Enron CEO Won't Accept $60.6 Mln in Severance, Spokesman Says
2001-11-13 18:04 (New York)

Enron CEO Won't Accept $60.6 Mln in Severance, Spokesman Says

     Houston, Nov. 13 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay will not accept severance pay
of more than $60 million that he would have received after Dynegy
Inc. took over the company.

     ``He decided the best thing was to waive it altogether after
speaking to employees at a meeting this afternoon,'' Enron
spokesman Mark Palmer said. Lay declined to comment.

     Lay is entitled to receive a lump sum payment equal to $20.2
million, multiplied by the number of full calendar years remaining
on his contract, if he terminates his employment under certain
circumstances, such as the acquisition by Dynegy, Enron said in a
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission today.

    ``That's a ridiculous amount of money for a man who's already
made himself probably tens of millions of dollars,'' said Andrew
Whalley, manager of the Legg Mason International Utilities Trust,
which sold a $5 million stake in Enron in April because of concern
about its bookkeeping.

     Lay had gains of $123.4 million from the exercise of options
in 2000, in addition to his regular salary.  Robert Doty, Dynegy's
chief financial officer, refused to discuss severance packages for
departing Enron executives at a meeting with investors in Boston
today.

                           Mind Changed

      Dynegy says its buyout of Enron, the biggest energy trader,
is expected to close in 2002's third quarter. Lay's contract runs
through the end of 2005.  If the Enron buyout were to close this
year, or if there were another form of ``change of control'' at
Enron, Lay would be entitled to receive $80.8 million, the Enron
filing indicates. If it closes next year as planned, he'll get at
least $60.6 million.

     Lay's contract provides that he also could receive an amount
to cover tax penalties if the payment he gets is deemed to be an
``excess parachute payment'' under tax rules, the filing said.

Palmer said Lay was unlikely to qualify for the additional money.

     Earlier today, Lay planned to propose to Dynegy that he take
two-thirds of his severance pay in ``non-cash form,'' presumably
Dynegy stock and use half of the stock to set up a fund to provide
``need-based assistance'' to former Enron employees, Palmer said.

     After the employee meeting this afternoon, Lay decided the
employees would prefer to have him waive it altogether. It will be
up to Dynegy to decide if a fund should be set up for former Enron
employees, Palmer said.

                        $23 Billion Buyout

     Enron agreed on Friday to be acquired by rival Dynegy for at
least $23 billion in stock and assumed debt, ending a financial
crisis that threatened to bankrupt Enron and disrupt U.S. power
and natural-gas markets.

     Lay, 59 years old, has said he won't be an active manager in
the new company, which will be led by Dynegy Chairman and CEO
Charles Watson. No decision has been made about whether he might
serve on Dynegy's board, the companies said.

     ``They need Ken Lay to close the deal because of his skill
with regulators,'' said Mark Maloney, who helps manage $1.1
billion in the John Hancock Patriot Funds, who attended a
presentation to investors by the two companies in Boston today.
``Lay is close to the Bush administration, and that couldn't
hurt.''  The Patriot Funds don't own shares of Enron or Dynegy.

      Lay has been chairman since February 1986. His contract was
extended by two years, to the end of 2005, when he resumed the
CEO's job following the departure of Jeffrey Skilling in August.
Skilling didn't get a severance package because he quit, Enron has
said.

     The company more than tripled Lay's pay package last year to
$18.3 million following its best share-price performance in 20
years, according to a proxy filed in March with the SEC. Enron
shares have plunged 90 percent this year. Lay made $5.97 million
in 1999, according to Enron's proxy.

     Lay also received options to buy 782,830 shares over seven
years, most at $47.31 each, the March filing said. Those options
are now worthless because Enron's stock price is below the price
at which they could be exercised.

     Shares of Enron rose 74 cents to $9.98. Dynegy rose $2.63 to
$46.94. Both companies are based in Houston.

SWITZERLAND: Swiss EWZ suspends planned power venture with Enron.

11/14/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

ZURICH, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Swiss utility Elektrizitaetswerk der Stadt Zuerich (EWZ) has suspended its planned power trading joint venture with Enron Corp that was supposed to start up in January, EWZ said on Wednesday. 
Enron, hit by financial problems, is on the verge of being taken over by smaller rival Dynergy Inc , which agreed last week to buy Enron in a stock swap worth about $9 billion.
"Given these circumstances, EWZ...has decided to suspend the prepared start of a joint trading company of EWZ and Enron and to review the strategy of future cooperation with Enron or Dynergy," it said in a statement. 
It said the review would determine which aspects of the cooperation accord could still be attractive and if the proposed venture could be revived at some future date.

In a report released Wednesday, Goldman Sachs & Co. analyst David Fleischer=

dications that Enron's banks may be willing to roll current maturities over=

Michelle Foss, director of the Energy Institute at the University of Housto=

Enron Gets Extension on $690 Mln Note Due Next Week (Update1)

Enron Gets Extension on $690 Mln Note Due Next Week (Update1)

     (Updates with amount of debt in fourth paragraph.)

     Houston, Nov. 21 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., whose shares had
dropped 92 percent this year amid a financial crisis, said lenders
extended to mid-December the payment date on a $690 million note
due next week.

     Enron, which agreed to be bought out by rival energy trader
Dynegy Inc. in a transaction now valued at more than $23 billion,
said earlier this week a drop in its credit rating may force it to
repay the $690 million note. The repayment would strain cash
reserves Enron needs to back its trading operations, investors and
analysts said.

     The Houston-based company didn't say in its release who holds
the note, which is owed by an affiliated partnership that owns
Brazilian natural-gas assets and was backed by Enron.
     The note is held by a group of banks led by the Citibank unit
of Citigroup Inc., Standard & Poor's said in a press release
yesterday.

      Enron also is in discussions with other lenders on a
restructuring of its debt, the company said in a statement
distributed by PR Newswire.

     ``We believe the interests of Chase and Enron's other primary
lenders are aligned in this restructuring effort,'' James Lee,
vice president of JP Morgan Chase & Co., said in the Enron
statement. ``We will work with Enron and its other primary lenders
to develop a plan to strengthen Enron's financial position up to
and through its merger with Dynegy.'' Morgan has been advising
Enron on its merger with Dynegy.

     Enron said yesterday it may have to pay $9.15 billion in debt
due by 2003, suggesting the company may run out of cash before the
merger closes. Dynegy has said the merger should close before the
end of the third quarter of 2002.

      Enron said in a regulatory filing that it has less than $2
billion in cash or credit lines.

     Shares of Enron, the most active stock in U.S. trading, fell
$1.79, or 23 percent, to $5.20 in midday trading. Before the
announcement that it had renegotiated the $690 million note, its
shares had fallen as much as 42.78 percent, the lowest level in
more than a decade.

     Dynegy fell $2.50, or 6 percent, to $39.20. Shares of
ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns 26 percent of Dynegy, rose 49
cents to  $87.02



Enron, Dynegy Shares Fall 2nd Day on Threat to Buyout (Update2)

Enron, Dynegy Shares Fall 2nd Day on Threat to Buyout (Update2)

     (Adds analyst comment in fourth paragraph.)

     Houston, Nov. 21, (Bloomberg) -- Shares of Enron Corp., the
biggest energy trader, and Dynegy Inc. fell for a second day on
concern Enron may run out of cash before its takeover by Dynegy
can be completed.

     Enron tumbled as much as 33 percent, and Dynegy dropped as
much as 6.7 percent. Enron's bonds also fell. The company's 6.4
percent notes maturing in July 2006 were bid at 62 cents and
offered at 66 cents, traders said. They sold at about 72 cents
yesterday.

     Institutional investors sold shares of both companies after
Goldman, Sachs & Co. analyst David Fleischer downgraded them to
``market perform'' from his ``recommend'' list, other analysts
said.

     The Dynegy bid ``did not eliminate customer concerns about
Enron's liquidity and long-term viability,'' Goldman Sachs said
in its report. ``We now believe that it will be difficult for
Enron shares to generate strong returns until it is clear that
Enron can operate on a normal basis without having to provide
cash or letters of credit to back routine transactions.''

     Fleischer also cut his 2002 profit estimate for Enron to 50
cents from $1.35. Enron had been expected to make $1.90 next
year, the average estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by Thomson
Financial/First Call.

     Enron said Monday it may have to pay $9.15 billion in debt
due by 2003, suggesting the Houston-based energy trader may run
out of cash. The company said in a regulatory filing it has less
than $2 billion in cash or credit lines.

     It also surprised some investors by saying a drop in its
credit rating may force it to repay a $690 million note next
week. Enron said yesterday the terms of the notes, which it
guaranteed for an affiliated partnership that owns Brazilian
natural-gas assets, are being renegotiated and that it had a
``verbal indications'' that the maturity of the notes will be
extended.

     The company's dealings with affiliated partnerships led to
earnings restatements, credit-rating cuts, a federal
investigation and a management shakeup. Dynegy plans to complete
its buyout by October, and Enron may have to ask lenders to
restructure payment schedules.

     Mirant Corp., Aquila Inc. and other big energy traders are
doing fewer transactions with Enron as concerns increase about
its credit rating and ability to finance daily business,
executives said yesterday.

     Enron's stock fell $2.28, or 32 percent, to $4.71 in
late-morning trading. Earlier, it touched $4.67, its lowest price
in more than a decade. The shares have plummeted 92 percent this
year. Dynegy fell $2.70, or 6.5 percent, to $39.00. The shares
had dropped 26 percent this year.

     Houston, Nov. 21 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. said its lenders
extended to mid-December the payment date on a $690 million note,

previously announced $1 billion credit line.

s, and it would cause big losses for the Houston company's creditors.=20
Just before noon EST, Enron announced in a press release that it had extend=
ed to mid-December a $690 million obligation that was due next week. It als=

Investors have been fleeing Enron since the company last month disclosed a =
$1.2 billion writedown to unwind some related-party hedging transactions. T=
he Securities and Exchange Commission is probing Enron deals with related p=
arties. The October disclosure made investors uneasy because it suggested t=
he company hadn't been forthcoming about the true state of its finances, an=
d it showed that Enron was facing serious liquidity problems.=20
Those fears were temporarily quieted earlier this month when Enron agreed t=
o be acquired by smaller rival Dynegy. But Enron's disclosure Monday that i=
t faces additional earnings and financing troubles renewed the rush to the =
exits. In the Wednesday release, Enron CEO Ken Lay said his company was sti=
ll committed to the merger: "We continue to believe that this merger is in =
the best interests of our shareholders, employees and lenders." Dynegy late=
r issued a press release indicating it is "continuing our confirmatory due =
diligence" regarding the merger. Neither Enron nor Dynegy returned calls se=

After plunging 23% Tuesday to $6.99, Enron was down a staggering 34% at one=
 point Wednesday. It moved slightly higher after the midday press release t=

 the company issued its third-quarter earnings release last month. Dynegy d=

At the heart of Enron's trouble is the sense that the company isn't letting=
 on the full extent of its troubles. The selloff in Enron shares began in e=

hat it would take a $1.2 billion writedown to unwind some related-party tra=

ethical and disclosure issues.=20
The Dynegy merger was taken as a vote of confidence for Enron, since as a b=
ig trading partner Dynegy would appear to have a solid grasp of Enron's sit=
uation. As a result, shares in both companies rallied after the deal's anno=
uncement. But Monday's disclosure that Enron faced $690 million in bond pay=
ments next week reignited worries that the company faced steeper challenges=
 than it has detailed. According to a Merrill Lynch report cited in The New=

Critics of the deal wondered whether Enron had told Dynegy about all its ob=
ligations. <http://www.thestreet.com/markets/detox/10003860.html>=20
Liquidity fears have also been rekindled by information contained in a fili=
ng of quarterly results that show the company consumed as much as $5 billio=

billion to pay back various obligations. It had $1.2 billion in cash on han=
d as of Nov. 16, according to the filing.=20
Tellingly, Dynegy shares haven't plunged along with Enron, suggesting that =
investors see a collapse of the merger as catastrophic for Enron but not fo=

J.P. Morgan has taken a leading role in helping Enron. It has lent funds an=

DYNEGY, ENRON SAY MERGER TO PROCEED

By Myra P. Saefong

1:52 PM ET Nov 21, 2001

WASHINGTON (CBS.MW) -- Merger partners Enron and Dynegy restated their
commitment Wednesday to completing a deal, on the heels of embattled
Enron's announcement that its lead lender granted it more time to pay
off a $690 million note set to come due next week.

"We are continuing our confirmatory due diligence and working to
accelerate the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger,"
said Chuck Watson, Dynegy's chairman and chief executive,  in a
statement.

Shares of Enron (ENE) recovered slightly in afternoon  trading but
remained under pressure.


On heavy volume, the stock -- which had touched $4 earlier in the
session -- was down $1.83 to trade at $5.16, a new 10-year low. Some 84
million shares had changed hands.

Enron declined 23 percent Tuesday after the company revealed the
upcoming debt deadline and restated its earnings.

Meanwhile, Dynegy shares lost $1.83 to stand at $39.87.

Enron said that the lead bank on the $690 million debt agreed to extend
the maturity date to mid-December, which will give the company time to
restructure the facility, and added it expects to further restructure
its debt.

"We ... believe we can identify a mutually beneficial restructuring to
enhance our cash position, strengthen our balance sheet, and address
upcoming maturities," said Jeff McMahon, chief financial officer, in a
statement.

J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. said it and other lenders are committed to
helping Enron improve its financial position.

Also, Enron reaffirmed its commitment to a merger with Dynegy and said
it closed on a previously announced $450 million line of credit from
J.P. Morgan, collateralized by the company's Northern Natural Gas Co.

Enron -- which is being acquired by its smaller rival Dynegy (DYN) at a
fire-sale price -- revealed in a Securities and Exchange Commission
filing Monday that it had to pay off or refinance $690 million in debt
obligations by next Monday or risk triggering nearly $4 billion in
additional payments.

If Enron had missed that deadline and didn't post collateral, investors
had the right to demand immediate liquidation of the assets of one of
Enron's limited partnerships, the unusual business entities at the
center of the company's murky transactions currently under
investigation.

The SEC filing of Monday also contained yet another restatement of
financial results on the heels of a similar filing that disclosed more
than four years of restated earnings figures.
<http://cbs.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=3D%7B35D690E0%2D13BE%2D43D9=
%2D9644%2D1B1CF4896115%7D>

Earlier Wednesday, Goldman Sachs lowered its rating on Enron's stock to
"market performer" from its "U.S. recommended list," citing "major"
liquidity issues and concerns over whether the company can recover the
business it has lost.

CIBC World Markets also cut Enron to a "hold" from a "buy."

Commerzbank weighed in Wednesday, saying Enron's viability is in doubt.

"We believe the filing clearly shows that Enron remains in a precarious
financial position and its status as a going concern is much in doubt,"
analysts Andre Meade and Andrew Smith wrote. "It appears that Enron's
situation could worsen in a number of ways."

Though Enron's most recent disclosures shed more light on the fiscal
situation, Meade and Smith characterized the information as "piecemeal."

"It appears that the full extent of Enron's problems is not currently
known," they said in a note, cautioning clients against investing in
Enron.

May		$400,000

June		$500,000

While the above numbers are in dollars, we are currently calculating the price for each of these months that will result in the volume to be delivered at a fixed price.

Cindy,
I believe the Bridgestone team rep is Mike Plunkett (mplunkett@dqe.com ).  
I'll copy this to Mike and maybe he can confirm.  
 
Chris, do you know Liz's (Cy Creek) email?
 
Also, I did contact Nicole, who is one of our coaches, and asked if she could use her KISD influence to help secure the Klein pool for divisionals.
 
Another advantage for using the Klein pool (vs Klein Oak) that we didn't talk about on Tues night is the 10 and under swimmers won't have to start from the bulkhead.  They can start from the blocks since ATEX has the covers for the warm up/down well.  At Oak this would be an issue.  Two years ago when these covers weren't around, parents, swimmers and coaches were upset that kids who were close to making invitational times would be hurt by having to start from the bulkhead. 
 
Thanks,
Jeff

Natural Gas Futures Drop on Technicals


    Natural gas futures for February delivery on the NYMEX tumbled
$0.14 yesterday to $2.254 per MMBtu after locals battled funds and
lost. The March contract lost $0.109 to $2.254 per MMBtu. There was a
technical strategy from large marketing firms to bid up the contract
in an attempt to chase funds out of their short positions, however,
it blew up in their face. The locals wound up long and had to sell-
off rapidly. The market opened strong, hitting a high of $2.405 per
MMBtu on the strength of an AGA report that lowered the year-on-year
surplus, but then quickly dropped below $2.25. Open interest
increased by 9,689 contracts Wednesday to 464,452 contracts, in what
by yesterday morning indicated a contrived effort to sell up the
market. Look for resistance at $2.36 and support at $2.20, $2.125 and
$2.02. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada
generally flat to up $0.05 per MMBtu yesterday. Without much cold
weather moving either market, the spread between futures and cash
stayed at $0.03  $0.05 without much movement. Natural gas for next
day delivery at the Henry hub gained $0.03 to $2.33 per MMBtu.

 PG&E Claims California Owes It Billions


    Pacific Gas & Electric has filed a $4.1 billion damage claim
against California for allegedly breaking a regulatory contract to
let it sell power at prices set by the FERC. The claim stems from the
1996 law that deregulated the state's power market and helped trigger
California's energy crisis. PG&E says that under the law, it agreed
to divest most of its in-state power plants to increase competition
in the local electricity market. In return, the state would allow
PG&E's remaining hydroelectric and nuclear plants to sell power at
market prices overseen by the FERC. That would end the California
PUCs authority to set prices, and shifting regulatory oversight to
FERC's less stringent system of managing prices. PG&E says the market
value of its power was not less than $4.1 billion. It also says that
under an emergency energy bill passed last January, the state broke
the agreement for FERC regulation. The state board has 45 days to
reply to the claim.

Westchester County, NY Battles Millennium Pipeline


    Westchester County, north of New York City, will petition the
FERC to reconsider its decision to permit Columbia Gas to build the
530-mile Millennium pipeline from Ontario to Mount Vernon, NY. The
pipeline would transport 700,000 Mcf per day to New York City and
southern parts of the state. The county alleges that the FERC
prematurely granted Columbias request to build the pipeline. They say
that Columbia does not have the needed state approvals to proceed
with construction and that the company did not provide crucial
information about using dynamite to blast in environmentally
sensitive areas in the Hudson River. A FERC study found that the
pipeline would have limited adverse environmental impact and was the
preferred alternative to deliver natural gas to New York. The
commission has 30 days to respond to the countys petition. If denied,
Westchester can then seek a court order to block construction. The
county has asked several state regulatory departments to deny future
approvals and cancel existing permits already granted. Westchester
will also refuse to grant Columbia permits for construction on county
land. Additionally, the county is questioning whether the pipeline
violates a state plan to protect coastal areas from environmental
damage. Federal law prohibits a federal agency from granting approval
for projects that affect the coastline if a state finds it violates
its own coastal plan. In addition, county officials have asked the
governor to intervene when he attends a FERC conference later this
month.

Enron Paid Very Few Taxes


    Enrons use of Caribbean tax havens to legally shelter profits
reflects the power Washington lobbyists have in creating tax havens
for the rich and powerful. Offshore tax havens among the small
islands of the Caribbean have been used for years by individual
investors, companies, drug traffickers and money launderers to hide
cash. But the disclosure that Enron paid no income taxes in 4 of the
last 5 years by using 900 subsidiaries in tax-haven countries and
other techniques kept its US tax bill a next to nothing. Enron used
881 subsidiaries abroad, including 692 in the Cayman Islands and 119
in the Turks and Caicos, and other legal tax-avoidance techniques
common to major companies to zero-out US tax bills. The Cayman
Islands, a tiny British colony of 35,000 residents just south of
Cuba, is one of the world's leading financial centers with some 600
banks and thousands of foreign corporations.

Andersen Memo Details Meeting on Enron


   A February 6, 2001 Andersen memo detailing a executive meeting
where the amount of debt kept off Enron's books was discussed has
surfaced. Andersen said the meeting was just a standard annual review
of Enron. The executives discussed whether Anderson should drop Enron
as a client, and also talked about how key the off balance sheet
transactions were to understanding the energy firms finances. It has
also been revealed that Andersen was warned of trouble at Enron last
summer by the same executive who sent Kenneth Lay a memo detailing 
her concerns over the companys financial practices. The Enron
executive then raised those same concerns in a conversation with an
unidentified Andersen partner. Andersen was assured by Enron that an
outside law firm had been hired to look into the allegations. The
memo is likely to lead to questions about the role of accountants and
the steps they take before signing sign off on a company's financial
statements. The chairman of the SEC is expected to announce a new
accounting oversight panel to include accountants and non-
accountants, possibly similar to the Public Oversight Board.

Recession and Mild Weather Lower Dukes Profits


    Duke says 4th quarter profits dropped 21% due to lower energy
prices, mild weather and the recession. Earnings fell to $225
million, or $0.28 per share, from $284 million, or $0.38 a year ago.
Revenue was off 30% to $10.7 billion from $15.4 billion the year
before. Duke's field services unit, which processes natural gas
liquids saw its earnings tumble 34% because of lower prices. The
companys electric utilities, which provided more than 30% of its
earnings, fell 41% as moderate temperatures and a drop in industrial
demand ate into power sales. Dukes power sales slid 7.6% in the
quarter for residential customers and 9.5% for industrial customers,
the company said. Natural gas prices plunged 59% from a year earlier
and wholesale power prices in Dukes service region fell by 50% to
about $25 per MWh. Duke also said that it took a charge for special
items totaling  $46 million, or $0.06 per share, to reflect
accounting adjustments at its utilities and exposure to losses from
dealings with Enron. Excluding the one-time charge, profit was $271
million, or $0.34 per share. The average of analysts estimates was
$0.45 per share. The company remains optimistic that it can achieve
10% - 15% growth this year. Duke's revenue last year was $59.5
billion compared to $49.3 billion in 2000. More than half of its
natural gas and power contracts hedged through 2004.

ISO Merger Talks Continue in Northeast and Midwest

   Merger talks are underway in the Northeast and Midwest to
consolidate control of large parts of those grids. The New York ISO
is in discussions with ISO New England to form a regional
transmission organization between the two grid operators. The talks
currently do not include the PJM Interconnection, which last week
announced that it reached a letter of intent to create a single
market with the Midwest ISO. The FERC has a pending decision on
Northeastern RTO formation, based on confidential mediation
discussions from last summer that were aimed at developing a business
plan to create a single Northeast RTO. It expects to release the
results of its own cost-benefit analysis of forming a single
Northeastern RTO next month, but has not decided on the size and
numbers of RTOs in the region. Also, former members of the Alliance
RTO are in negotiations to form an independent entity within the
existing Midwest ISO. The discussions concern a FERC rulemaking
session last month that declared the Midwest ISO to be the single RTO
for the region, saying that the Alliance did not meet its conditions.

Accenture Now Glad Andersen Name Lost

   About a year ago consulting firm Accenture was called Andersen
Consulting, but lost a bitter fight with its sister firm, Arthur
Andersen, to retain the brand name of Andersen. Now, the name loss
looks like manna from Heaven, as the once fabled Andersen name sinks
in the Enron quagmire. Once one of the pillars of accounting, the
Andersen name is now only associated with the Enron debacle. That is
very different from the scenario that prevailed during the bitter
battle between the accounting firm and its consulting arm. A Paris
mediator ruled in Andersen's favor in August 2000. That was a seen as
a huge victory for the accounting firm. The dispute began when
Andersen Consulting, which had seen its profits soar with the booming
economy, felt it was not being paid enough for its work. Ultimately,
Andersen Consulting won independence, but was forced it to relinquish
the Andersen brand name. Be careful what you ask for, you might not
really want it after all.

Canadian Drilling to Drop this Year

    The Petroleum Services Association of Canada says that Western
Canadian producers expect to cut drilling by 26% this year and
natural gas will continue to dominate exploration activity. It
predicts 13,386 wells will be drilled in western Canada, down from
last year's record 18,024. Natural gas will account for 8,189, or
61%, of its forecast well completions this year. PSAC expects 10,309
wells to be drilled in Alberta, down 26% from 2001; 2,323 wells in
Saskatchewan, a 25% drop; and 674 in northeastern British Columbia,
down 29%. There were 11,177 natural gas completions last year in the
Western Canada Sedimentary Basin, with another 26 natural gas wells
drilled in the East Coast offshore.

Trickier Times for Europe's Banks in 2002 --- Drop in Investor Confidence A=

FRANKFURT -- After a tricky 2001, European banks could find life getting to=
ugher still in 2002.=20
Banking analysts say a combination of economic stagnation, rising corporate=
 bankruptcies and low confidence among retail investors is likely to hurt m=
any banks' earnings in the coming year.
Since mid-2000, when the U.S. economic slowdown spread to Europe -- and in =
particular to its largest economy, Germany -- European banks have tried to =
reassure investors about their corporate clients' credit-worthiness. Althou=
gh banks in the United Kingdom, France and elsewhere have had to set aside =
only modest amounts to cover bad loans so far, loan-loss provisions were pa=
rtly responsible for quarterly operating losses among some of Germany's big=
gest banks. Now the fear is that the German syndrome will spread.=20
"The asset-quality downturn has only just started," says Mark Hoge, an anal=
yst at Bank of America in London. So far, he says, the global economic down=
turn has pushed only a small number of weak or heavily indebted companies i=
nto bankruptcy or financial crisis, such as energy trader Enron Corp. and S=
wissair Group. The next stage will be loan defaults by small and midsize co=
mpanies, which form the backbone of several European economies, including G=
ermany's. "You will get a broad deterioration of the bread-and-butter lendi=
ng business next year," he says.=20
European banks have as much as six trillion euros ($5.3 trillion) of loans =
outstanding, and next year they are likely to lose about 38 billion euros o=
f those assets, or 0.73%, according to Davide Serra, a Morgan Stanley analy=
st in London. That is three times as high as in the past three to four year=
s, but historically speaking, it is still a low figure. In the recession of=
 the late 1980s and early 1990s, banks wrote off over 1% of loans. Still, M=
r. Serra says the impact of bad loans is severe: Every 0.1% of loans writte=
n off reduces European banks' profit by 5% to 6%.=20
Banks could suffer if troubles at indebted large corporations multiply. In =
the past year, business fortunes collapsed rapidly at a small number of hig=
h-profile companies, including airlines Swissair and Sabena and telecommuni=
cations-equipment maker Marconi PLC. German bankers are growing nervous tha=
t the heavy debts of Bavarian media company Kirch Group could trigger the n=
ext emergency restructuring.=20
The number and impact of large corporate collapses are "a lumpy phenomenon =
that you can't forecast in a systematic way," Mr. Serra says. Corporate fai=
lures tend to lag behind economic slowdowns by 12 to 18 months -- which mea=
ns they are likely to rise in Europe next year, he says.=20
Many of Europe's banks have been trying to reduce their reliance on traditi=
onal corporate lending by expanding into asset management and retail broker=
age activities. Two years ago, it looked as though Europeans' newfound enth=
usiasm for buying stocks, including those in high-profile privatizations an=
d technology industries, would give the region's banks the new source of no=
nloan revenue they were seeking. But a generation of first-time retail inve=
stors learned a lesson in risk when the tech bubble burst earlier this year=
.=20
Europe is still expected to develop a U.S.-style equity investing culture o=
ver time, driven in particular by the growth of a long-term savings market =
as Europeans move to private pension funds. The Jan. 1 introduction of euro=
 notes and coins will create a pan-European financial-services market over =
time. But for the moment, Europeans have fallen out of love with stocks, as=
 shown by the depressed earnings of brokerage and funds units at most Europ=
ean banks in 2001.=20
Analyst don't expect investor confidence to return quickly. John Leonard, a=
n analyst at Schroder Salomon Smith Barney in London, compares the situatio=
n to the U.S. in the year after the stock-market crash of 1987, when retail=
 investors' losses made them wary of returning to the fray even after the f=
irst signs of recovery.=20
Fear of getting involved in troubled banking markets could also keep the U.=
K.'s banks on the sidelines, despite their long search for European partner=
s. Lloyds TSB in particular has long talked about a European merger and has=
 held advanced but inconclusive talks during the past year with the Benelux=
-based insurance and banking group Fortis NV and Germany's Deutsche Bank AG=
, according to people familiar with the matter. But Lloyds's shareholders a=
re likely to be skeptical about a deal that would mix up the banks' relativ=
ely robust earnings in the U.K. retail market with the problems spreading a=
cross Europe.=20
Opportunities for European deals in the coming year appear scarce. A foreig=
n bid for a French bank such as Societe Generale SA would be highly sensiti=
ve amid France's presidential election campaign, for example. Germany's fal=
tering economy makes its banks unappealing.=20
"You would really need your head examined to be buying into something like =
Commerzbank in a recession in Germany when you don't know how long it's goi=
ng to last," says Mr. Hoge of Bank of America.=20

Great Expectations: Did Greenspan Push High-Tech Optimism On Growth Too Far=
? --- Some He Won Over at Fed Have Second Thoughts; At Stake: Interest Rate=
s --- Bank Took `a Bit of a Risk'

WASHINGTON -- Five years ago, Alan Greenspan began pushing a reluctant Fede=
ral Reserve to embrace his New Economy vision of rapid productivity growth =
and rising living standards.=20
Today, Fed policy makers are debating whether they went too far. The answer=
 could help determine whether the current recession marks a temporary aberr=
ation in an era of swift growth, or whether the rapid growth of the late 19=
90s itself was the aberration.
Mr. Greenspan hasn't lost the faith. "New capital investment, especially th=
e high-tech type, will continue where it left off," he declared in a speech=
 last month at Rice University in Houston. He ignored the collapse of so ma=
ny symbols of the 1990s boom, including Enron Corp., the sponsor of the "di=
stinguished public service" award he received that evening. "The long-term =
outlook for productivity growth, as far as I'm concerned, remains substanti=
ally undiminished," the Fed chairman asserted.=20
But others at the central bank -- many of whom only belatedly embraced thei=
r leader's optimistic views at the peak of the boom -- now have re-embraced=
 a less-sanguine view. During 2001, the Fed's research staff has steadily m=
arked down its estimate of the rate at which the economy can grow during th=
e next two years without sparking inflation. The economic aftermath of Sept=
. 11 has only darkened the picture further, as companies shift resources aw=
ay from boosting efficiency and toward improving security.=20
Recent events have "forced a reassessment of the prospects for longer-term =
productivity growth," Fed governor Laurence Meyer said in a relatively down=
beat speech in St. Louis just two weeks after Mr. Greenspan's sunny comment=
s in Houston. Where Mr. Greenspan emphasized the prospect of a healthy rebo=
und in computers, Mr. Meyer stressed that the "frenzied pace of investment =
in high-tech equipment [in the late 1990s] now appears to have been unsusta=
inable."=20
The exchange between Messrs. Greenspan and Meyer signals an intellectual co=
ntest at the Fed with huge stakes. If the buoyant Greenspan view prevails, =
the Fed might hold down interest rates longer, until strong growth resumes,=
 not fearing a flare-up of inflation. The gloomier perspective could lead t=
he Fed to raise rates more quickly to avoid fueling inflation -- or reinfla=
ting a bubble -- with expectations of brisk growth.=20
The Fed's outlook also matters for congressional decisions on taxes and spe=
nding. Mr. Greenspan's assurances of a rapid-growth future helped create a =
consensus in Washington earlier this year about the inevitability of large =
federal budget surpluses -- and the affordability of President Bush's big t=
ax cuts.=20
The Fed's growth debate amounts to an argument over what kind of economy Am=
erica can look forward to once the recession ends: one of rapidly rising li=
ving standards, low inflation, low interest rates, and federal budgets in r=
easonable balance -- like that in most of the 1950s and 1960s -- or a much-=
less-robust version.=20
Mr. Greenspan's contention -- that since 1995, the U.S. has shown the abili=
ty to expand productivity at an accelerated rate, without demand for goods =
and services outrunning supply and igniting inflation -- is now so widely a=
ccepted as to seem mundane. But just five or six years ago, it was consider=
ed revolutionary. Mr. Greenspan was one of the first respected analysts to =
make the case.=20
The key to this whole discussion is productivity, which economists define a=
s a worker's -- or nation's -- output, divided by the relevant number of ho=
urs of labor. The pace of growth in gross domestic product is essentially e=
quivalent to the productivity-growth rate added to the rate of expansion of=
 the labor force (which economists assume to be about 1% a year).=20
As far back as 1993, Mr. Greenspan has said, he noted a surprising surge in=
 companies' capital-goods orders. He speculated that companies were enjoyin=
g unusual gains in productivity, or efficiency, from the new equipment, muc=
h of which was high-tech. As his conjecture hardened into conviction, he co=
ncluded the greater productivity would permit the economy to grow faster wi=
thout demand getting out of sync with supply. The Fed could hold back on ra=
ising rates longer without fear of fueling inflation.=20
Alan Blinder, who challenged the central bank's high-rates stance when he j=
oined the seven-member Fed board as vice chairman in 1994, was pleasantly s=
urprised by Mr. Greenspan's switch to endorsing lower rates in 1995. But Mr=
. Blinder was nervous about the chairman's reasoning. At a Fed policy meeti=
ng in December 1995, Mr. Blinder backed Mr. Greenspan's bottom line on inte=
rest levels -- but "without signing onto your brave new world scenario," ac=
cording to official transcripts of the gathering.=20
Mr. Meyer, an economic forecaster and consultant who joined the Fed in 1996=
, was uncomfortable with the low-interest-rate approach and the Greenspan n=
otion that basic changes in the economy would allow it to grow faster witho=
ut sparking inflation. In a January 1998 speech, he branded the prior year'=
s growth spurt "unsustainable."=20
The Fed's own research staff had Greenspan doubters. Economist Daniel Siche=
l's 1997 book, "The Computer Revolution," punctured tales of companies usin=
g new technology to boost workers' productivity to permanently higher level=
s. Mr. Sichel crunched numbers to show that for all the attention computers=
 received in the 1990s, they represented such a tiny portion of the nation'=
s capital stock -- 1.1% -- that they couldn't possibly make a big differenc=
e.=20
In their internal forecasts during most of the 1990s, the Fed staff argued =
that the economy couldn't average overall growth of much more than 2.5% a y=
ear without kindling inflation. The problem for the staff and other Greensp=
an skeptics was that Commerce Department estimates of actual annual growth =
for 1996, 1997 and 1998 were, respectively, 3.6%, 4.4% and 4.3% -- while in=
flation remained dormant.=20
Michael Prell, who ran the Fed's research department during this period, tr=
ied to explain much of the high overall growth rates as a function of tempo=
rary factors, not new efficiencies. Perhaps, he argued to colleagues, compa=
nies were coaxing more output from their workers simply because the compani=
es couldn't hire quickly enough.=20
A member of the bank's rate-setting committee skeptically attributed a port=
ion of the growth rates to employees "running to the elevators": Workers at=
 companies meeting heavy customer demand were simply exerting themselves mo=
re, the official told colleagues. This wasn't a fundamental change, the com=
mittee member said. It was a temporary phenomenon that would taper off as t=
he economy inevitably cooled.=20
Outsiders also attacked the Greenspan view. At a meeting the chairman hoste=
d in April 1999, Paul Romer, a Stanford University economist, displayed a c=
hart of productivity during the past 100 years. "People in Silicon Valley a=
re talking about hockey-stick growth curves," compared with the 1970s and 1=
980s, Prof. Romer recalls telling the attendees. But in fact, the improveme=
nt of the previous three years wasn't such a historical anomaly, he pointed=
 out. The U.S. had racked up even more impressive growth rates in the 1960s=
.=20
Mr. Greenspan didn't confront Mr. Romer at the time. The chairman rarely, i=
f ever, engaged doubters directly in debate. Instead, at policy meetings, h=
e periodically pointed out how frequently in-house forecasters' projections=
 in the late 1990s had failed to match subsequent actual growth and inflati=
on figures, according to people in attendance.=20
But gradually, current and former Fed governors and staff members say, they=
 found the views he advocated harder to resist. As Mr. Greenspan's fellow p=
olicy makers understood it, his pitch was that the central bank should give=
 his optimistic perspective a chance. "The question was whether or not we s=
hould sort of take a bit of a risk," recalls Fed governor Edward Kelley, wh=
o is set to step down at the end of the month, after 14 years with the bank=
. The gamble, he explains, was to let the Greenspan theory "run, and see if=
 this thing is going to be real and have some legs and keep allowing us, fo=
r a while at least, to have a very strong [growth rate] and a declining inf=
lation rate."=20
The Fed traditionally seeks consensus in fashioning monetary policy. Over t=
he four-year period from 1996 through 1999, Mr. Greenspan persuaded his col=
leagues, first, not to raise interest rates, and then, when rate increases =
became inevitable because of inflation fears, to institute them more slowly=
 than many would have wanted.=20
Beyond making arguments, Mr. Greenspan helped generate more empirical suppo=
rt for his perspective by pushing an effort to adjust official data that mo=
st economists agreed had grown obsolete. After getting a private presentati=
on in the summer of 1996 from Mr. Greenspan and two of his aides, Commerce =
Department officials accelerated their plans to revise output figures for s=
ectors such as banking. Until the change, the official numbers hadn't shown=
 any improvement in efficiency for banks in the 1990s, despite the prolifer=
ation of automatic-teller machines that so obviously allowed branches to co=
nduct more transactions per worker.=20
In another initiative, Fed staffers in 1998 created their own tech-industry=
 database, which provided an authoritative account of the accelerating drop=
 in semiconductor prices, beginning in 1995. Economists interpreted the inf=
ormation as a strong sign that chip companies were able to cut prices becau=
se they had increased productivity. The new Fed information also suggested =
that prices of the machines that use semiconductors -- computers -- were al=
so falling, which many economists reasoned would encourage companies to buy=
 more computers.=20
"When the Fed began to look at these numbers, the scales fell away from eve=
rybody's eyes," says Harvard economist Dale Jorgenson. Computers clearly ha=
d become more prevalent since the Fed's Mr. Sichel found them to be such a =
small fraction of the nation's capital stock. Based on the new data, Mr. Jo=
rgenson published in August 2000 one of the first papers by a respected aca=
demic recognizing the contribution of computers to higher growth.=20
Mr. Greenspan avidly sought evidence that companies had only barely begun e=
mploying new technologies to raise efficiency and pump up productivity. At =
meetings and cocktail parties, he would sometimes draw a graph on paper rep=
resenting the spread of tech innovations, and then ask business executives =
to plot where their companies stood in exploiting these new technologies.=
=20
In a meeting at the Fed's headquarters in the summer of 1999, he prodded of=
ficials from the National Association of Purchasing Management to include i=
n their semiannual survey of executives a question about the remaining pote=
ntial for applying new technologies. They did, and the survey repeatedly fo=
und that managers thought they had exploited only half of the potential of =
high-tech -- a figure Mr. Greenspan then invoked regularly in speeches and =
congressional testimony to back his claims.=20
Mr. Greenspan bombarded his colleagues with anecdotes supporting his view t=
hat the economy had fundamentally changed. In October 1995, a group of supp=
ly managers from various industries visited the Fed to discuss the latest i=
n high-efficiency "just-in-time" inventory management. Mr. Kelley, the reti=
ring Fed governor and a former businessman, refers to himself as "an old in=
ventory manager." He recalls that one of the visiting supply executives des=
cribed routing goods to drugstores: "They would load a truck up and without=
 having orders, send the truck out. The drugstore computer system would cal=
l the supplier, which would call the truck on the road and say, `Go to such=
-and-such store and deliver the following items.'" To Mr. Kelley, hearing a=
bout this slick system "was like going to Mars."=20
By 1999, the official statistics were consistently reflecting the trends th=
at Mr. Greenspan had talked about for several years. Inflation stayed calm =
even as growth surged. And by then, the bulk of the Fed -- from Mr. Kelley =
and other policy makers to the staff -- had been converted to New Economy b=
elievers, too.=20
The once-skeptical Mr. Meyer confessed in a speech in September 1999 that "=
we can confidently say . . . that, since 1995, actual productivity growth h=
as increased." At the time, he suggested that he believed the economy could=
 annually grow overall by as much as 3% without inciting inflation, up from=
 his longtime prior estimate of a 2.5% limit. Soon thereafter, he indicated=
 that perhaps the right number was 3.5% to 4%. Mr. Sichel, the researcher w=
ho had cast doubt on the significance of computers to productivity, co-wrot=
e a paper published in 2000 that said the prevalence of computers had sharp=
ly increased, and they were contributing significantly to productivity grow=
th.=20
While the doubters were coming around to Mr. Greenspan's basic point of vie=
w -- that the economy's speed limit had risen -- the Fed chairman seemed to=
 move even farther out on the limb. At an April 2000 White House conference=
 on the New Economy, he appeared to raise his already-upbeat opinion of how=
 much better the economy could perform. "I see no reason that productivity =
growth cannot remain elevated, or even increase further," he said.=20
Still, Mr. Greenspan is a master politician, as skilled as any Washington f=
igure at hedging his bets and covering himself for all eventualities. While=
 his rhetoric often sounds giddy, he has assiduously avoided ever giving a =
concrete number -- even to fellow Fed officials -- for maximum sustainable =
growth. He also often qualifies his more-effusive statements to concede tha=
t his high-tech growth theory could be wrong. In one speech in January 2000=
, he acknowledged that future historians "might well conclude that a good d=
eal of what we are currently experiencing was just one of the many euphoric=
 speculative bubbles that have dotted human history."=20
And yet, so persuaded were Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues of his optimist=
ic outlook that they seemed to have trouble accepting the bursting of the h=
igh-tech bubble when it happened last year. As business investment weakened=
 in late 2000, Fed officials told one another that technology had proven so=
 valuable to companies that they would likely resume higher purchasing leve=
ls soon, Fed minutes show.=20
The staff forecast prepared for the December 2000 policy meeting predicted =
that consumer spending would slow because of falling stock-market wealth. B=
ut "business fixed investment, notably outlays for equipment and software, =
was projected to remain relatively robust," according to the minutes. Mr. G=
reenspan himself was taken aback in October 2000 by a chart accompanying an=
 article in The Wall Street Journal that showed a huge gap between the rapi=
d growth of fiber-optic capacity and the much-slower growth of demand for t=
he technology, a discrepancy that soon led to the collapse of a raft of sta=
rt-up broadband companies.=20
Early this year, the Fed was cutting interest rates in an effort to keep gr=
owth from stalling, while still issuing upbeat statements about the New Eco=
nomy. "To date there is little evidence to suggest that longer-term advance=
s in technology and associated gains in productivity are abating," the cent=
ral bank's policy makers said after the first rate cut in early January.=20
Some economists now say that because Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues belie=
ved so fervently in the fundamental benefits of technology, they didn't rec=
ognize that much high-tech spending in the late 1990s was wasted. "Virtuall=
y no one, official or outside [the Fed] was talking about the fact that hig=
h stock prices were essentially generating too much investment" by business=
es in high-tech gear, says Stephen Cecchetti, head of research at the Feder=
al Reserve Bank of New York from 1997 to 1999 and now an economics professo=
r at Ohio State University.=20
But as capital spending continued to collapse this winter and spring, the F=
ed research department's models showed that the economy's potential to grow=
 over the next two years was slipping to about 3% from its estimate of more=
 than 4% in early 2000. (The economists made clear this didn't necessarily =
affect the longer-run outlook.)=20
At the bank's June 2001 policy meeting, time was set aside for special staf=
f presentations on the most recent evidence on productivity and the tech gl=
ut. The researchers still agreed with Mr. Greenspan's assertion that produc=
tivity was going to be stronger than it had been from 1973 through 1995, bu=
t they now said that "how much stronger was an open question," according to=
 the minutes.=20
As companies have continued to work off excessive inventories for nearly a =
year, some Fed officials now believe they placed too much faith in such New=
 Economy tenets as the idea that better supply management could make long d=
ownturns less likely. "It has turned out we have had a more-severe economic=
 cycle than I thought we would," says Mr. Kelley. "It has so far looked mor=
e like the old days," he says, referring to recessions of past decades.=20
In July, it emerged that the statistical foundation of the Greenspan view h=
adn't been as impressive as it once seemed. Government statisticians recalc=
ulated their official estimates for output and productivity in the late 199=
0s after discovering they had overestimated software sales. For 2000, the o=
verall growth rate was knocked down from an eye-popping 5% to 4.1%.=20
The economy's turn-of-the-century performance "was still impressive," Mr. M=
eyer said in his speech in late November. But "it was less exceptional than=
 it had appeared before."=20
The big question now is which view of the economy's potential performance w=
ill prevail in coming years. If a new pessimism takes root at the central b=
ank -- if officials come to regret their Greenspan-inspired experiment of t=
he 1990s -- the Fed may be more inclined to rein in growth. If the influent=
ial chairman maintains his optimism and that of his colleagues, the bank ma=
y try harder to restore the 1990s boom.=20

Could've Been Worse
By PAUL KRUGMAN

12/28/2001
The New York Times
Page 19, Column 1
c. 2001 New York Times Company

It has not been a good year for economic policy, at home or abroad. The bes=
t you can say is that things could have been worse.=20
The bad news was legion. The U.S. went into recession, and the collapse of =
Enron raised questions not only about our economy but about the state of bu=
siness ethics. We squandered our hard-won budget surplus, and with it our b=
est chance to do something about the fiscal burdens of an aging population,=
 on an ill-conceived tax cut. Overseas, Argentina melted down -- something =
I had long predicted, but the actual events were still shocking. And Japan'=
s prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, looks less like Franklin Roosevelt and=
 more like Herbert Hoover every day.
The good news all takes the form of things that didn't happen.=20
The good news about the U.S. economy is that it fell into recession, but it=
 didn't fall off a cliff. Most of the credit probably goes to the dogged op=
timism of American consumers, but the Fed's dramatic interest rate cuts hel=
ped keep housing strong even as business investment plunged. The pain is fa=
r from over -- unemployment looks set to keep on rising, even if the G.D.P.=
 starts growing again -- but our worst fears have not been realized.=20
It was good news that the World Trade Organization didn't collapse. Trade i=
s one area in which the Bush administration is right and the Democrats are =
wrong; but there was a real risk that the 1999 debacle in Seattle, where an=
 attempt to start a new round of negotiations collapsed in disarray, would =
be repeated this year. In fact the meeting, in Doha, Qatar, went off fairly=
 well. Alas, I cannot take any satisfaction in the passage of ''fast track'=
' trade authority: as Lael Brainard pointed out on this page yesterday, the=
 Bush administration purchased fast-track at the cost of appalling concessi=
ons to special interests, concessions that hurt the very countries free tra=
de is supposed to help.=20
It was good news when California's energy crisis evaporated, thanks to pric=
e controls and conservation. The Bush administration was all set to use the=
 crisis to push through an environmentally destructive program of corporate=
 welfare, which had nothing to do with the actual problem; the sudden surpl=
us of power put that plan on hold.=20
Really big good news: To my immense relief, the absurdity of Social Securit=
y privatization became manifest before the system had been dismantled. I ha=
d been really worried about that; the Bush administration's claim that priv=
ate accounts would improve rather than worsen the system's finances made no=
 sense at all, yet it got a free pass from most commentators.=20
Fortunately, the commission that was supposed to propose a detailed plan ca=
me to a farcical end. Its final report declared that private accounts would=
 indeed strengthen Social Security, if they were accompanied by sharp benef=
it cuts and huge financial injections from unspecified sources. Yes, and ea=
ting a jelly doughnut every morning will help you lose weight, if you also =
cut back sharply on other foods and do a lot of exercise; otherwise the dou=
ghnuts will make you fatter. Again, aren't you glad the absurdity of the Bu=
sh proposal came to light before $1 trillion was diverted into private acco=
unts?=20
And one more thing to be grateful for: We didn't get a stimulus bill. That =
doesn't sound like good news, unless you look at the content of the bills t=
hat were actually on the table: huge further tax breaks for corporations an=
d the wealthy, doing little for the economy but further worsening our alrea=
dy dreary fiscal outlook.=20
But what about the year ahead?=20
For me the gloomiest moment was probably around mid-October. That's when th=
e straight economics looked worst -- when the impact of Sept. 11 on confide=
nce seemed all too likely to turn the recession into something truly nasty.=
 It was also the moment when some politicians decided to abandon all restra=
int, and throw their weight behind huge special-interest giveaways. But gue=
ss what? Confidence didn't collapse, and the special interests didn't get w=
hat they wanted. It turns out that there are still decent politicians, in b=
oth parties, and so far they have had enough power -- just -- to prevent th=
e worst.=20
In short, things could have been worse, and there is still reason to hope. =
Happy New Year.

JDS Set the Record, but It May Not Be 2001's Biggest Loser
By FLOYD NORRIS

12/28/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company

CALL it the year of good will gone bad. Never in history has so much in int=
angible assets been wiped off balance sheets as companies were forced to ac=
knowledge that they had made some very bad acquisitions.=20
But records are made to be broken, and accountants and appraisers say that =
companies are lining up to announce huge write-offs in 2002.
Until this year, the worst annual performance for an American corporation w=
as the $23.5 billion loss posted by General Motors in 1992, largely because=
 of an accounting change that forced it to recognize the costs of health ca=
re for retired workers. But that record was smashed by JDS Uniphase, which =
lost $56.1 billion in its fiscal year that ended June 30. Of that, more tha=
n $51 billion came from writing off the costs of bad acquisitions and inves=
tments.=20
As a symbol of the age, that was perfect. When G.M. set the record, it was =
an American icon, and its net loss that year came to just one-sixth of its =
annual revenue. JDS Uniphase, a maker of telecommunications equipment, is n=
ot known to most Americans, and for good reason. Its 2001 loss was about 10=
 times as large as its lifetime revenue.=20
JDS never saw $50 billion in cash, but it could lose that much because it w=
as blessed, for a time, with an overvalued stock, which it used to buy over=
priced companies. After the bubble burst, the accountants acted as if JDS h=
ad spent real money.=20
Another 2001 record breaker, Enron, did spend real money. Its bankruptcy se=
t the record as the largest in American history in terms of assets. It mana=
ged to go broke without ever reporting a bad quarter, at least not as measu=
red by the ''pro forma'' earnings that Wall Street relied upon until it was=
 too late.=20
Enron will now report huge losses. And, reports Alfred King, the co-chairma=
n of the Valuation Research Corporation, it will not be alone.=20
''A lot of write-downs are coming'' early in 2002 and will involve hundreds=
 of billions of dollars, Mr. King told a recent New York University seminar=
 on the new merger accounting rule that has just taken effect. Appraisal fi=
rms like his have been inundated with business from companies seeking advic=
e on how much to write off.=20
The rule says good will from mergers must be written off if the business un=
it containing the acquired company is worth less than book value, including=
 the good will taken on as part of the acquisition. Companies have some lee=
way in determining whether a write-off is needed, but it appears that many =
of them want to take their write-offs quickly, when they can blame a change=
 in accounting rules.=20
After the 2002 baths are taken, the usefulness of the new merger rule for i=
nvestors will depend on whether it forces companies to take losses quickly =
when a deal goes wrong, or whether companies can postpone the bad news unti=
l years later, after problems are clear to all.=20
There is a sense in which JDS did not suffer 2001's largest loss, nor did E=
nron. The biggest loss of good will may have been suffered by the accountin=
g profession. The Big Five accounting firms are clearly worried, and they a=
re scrambling to come up with a quick fix to improve disclosures of off-bal=
ance sheet debts, related-party transactions and market risks relative to c=
ommodity prices. In other words, all the things that Enron hid until it col=
lapsed.=20
The worry among accountants is that investors who were willing to shrug off=
 accounting scandals during the bull market may now be less tolerant. Wheth=
er that proves to be the case will be one thing to watch in 2002.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR - Power traders necessary for efficiency.
By BERNARD WEINSTEIN.

12/28/2001
Financial Times
(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved

>From Prof Bernard L. Weinstein.=20
The collapse of Enron is a serious blow to its employees and to the city of=
 Houston. But claims by some politicians and pundits that the electric powe=
r industry does not need such companies to make a market are ridiculous. Fo=
r consumers and businesses to get full benefit from deregulation and retail=
 competition, the activities of power traders such as Enron, Dynegy, Calpin=
e and Reliant are critical.
Enron may have overreached and made strategic blunders but this is often th=
e case when a formerly regulated industry restructures and one company atte=
mpts to "get ahead of the curve". Braniff Airlines is one example. When the=
 airlines were deregulated in the early 1980s, Braniff pursued a programme =
of rapid domestic and international expansion. Unable to generate sufficien=
t passenger revenue to cover its higher fixed costs and operating expenses,=
 Braniff went bankrupt in two years. Southwest Airlines took a more deliber=
ate approach to route expansion and became the most profitable airline in t=
he US. The trucking and telecommunications industries have also witnessed d=
ramatic failures by companies growing too fast, too soon after deregulation=
. Trucking giant McLean raced ahead of the pack during the initial impetus =
of deregulation in 1980, only to collapse several years later. A similar fa=
te befell ClayDesta Communications, which aspired to become a rival to AT&T=
 during the early years of telecoms deregulation. As with other restructuri=
ngs, it will take time for the electric power industry to sort itself out. =
This has been the case in Britain, where the push for competitive power mar=
kets began in the late 1980s. Few gains were recorded in the first years bu=
t by the mid-1990s consumers and businesses began to reap significant benef=
its. Today, electricity prices are down a third and about 30 per cent of cu=
stomers have switched providers. Unfortunately, some state legislatures are=
 citing the Enron case as a reason to slow down or derail electric power de=
regulation, while Congress is considering legislation severely to restrict =
the activities of power traders. Such measures would be a serious mistake. =
Power traders are the "middlemen" who make markets work and ensure they ope=
rate efficiently. Spot purchases and sales can spread lower power costs acr=
oss a wide geographic market in the short term while traders who sell long-=
term contracts reduce risks for utilities and ratepayers by providing price=
 certainty. Enron may or may not survive as a corporate entity. But a vibra=
nt market for power trading remains the key to ensuring that utilities, bus=
inesses and customers benefit from deregulation and competition in electric=
ity.=20

Commentary An Enron Tale of Strange Bedfellows
ALEXANDER COCKBURN

12/28/2001
Los Angeles Times
Home Edition
B-17
Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company

The fall of Enron sounds the death knell for one of the great rackets of th=
e last decade: the "Green Guys" seal of approval, whereby some outfit such =
as the Natural Resources Defense Council or the Environmental Defense Fund =
would issue testimonials to the enviro-conscience and selfless devotion to =
the public weal of corporations such as Enron. This approbation was part an=
d parcel of the neoliberal pitch that fuddy-duddy regulation should yield t=
o modern, "market-oriented" inducements to environmental good behavior, and=
 the NRDC and EDF were the prime salespeople.=20
The NRDC's deep involvement with the Enron lobby machine is a case in point=
. Here's what happened: In 1997, high-flying Enron was in a pitched battle =
in Oregon, where it planned to acquire Portland General Electric, the state=
's largest public utility. Warning that Enron's motives were of a highly pr=
edatory nature, the Public Utilities Commission staff opposed the merger. T=
hey warned that an Enron takeover would mean less protection for the enviro=
nment, increased insecurity for Portland General's workers and, likely, soa=
ring prices. There also was the issue of decommissioning Portland General's=
 Trojan nuclear plant.
Other critics argued that Enron's actual plan was to cannibalize Portland G=
eneral, in particular its hydropower, which Enron would sell in California'=
s energy market.=20
But as such protests threatened to deprive Enron of its prize, into town ro=
de the NRDC's top energy commissar, Ralph Cavanagh, flaunting his ties to t=
he Energy Foundation, a San Francisco-based outfit providing the financial =
wattage for many citizen and environmental groups. Cavanagh lost no time in=
 whipping the refractory greens of Oregon into line. In concert with Enron,=
 he put together a memo of understanding that pledged that the company woul=
d lend financial support to some of these groups' pet projects. But he had =
arduous politicking ahead. Approval for the merger had to come from the PUC=
, whose staff was opposed. So, on Feb. 14, 1997, Cavanagh showed up at a he=
aring in Salem, Ore., to plead Enron's case.=20
Addressing the PUC, he averred that this was "the first time I've ever spok=
en in support of a utility merger." If so, it was one of the quickest trans=
itions from virginity to seasoned performance in the history of intellectua=
l prostitution. Cavanagh touted the delights of an embrace with Enron: "Wha=
t we've put before you with this company is ... a robust assortment of publ=
ic benefits for the citizens of Oregon, which would not emerge without the =
merger." He then moved into rhetorical high gear: "The Oregonian [newspaper=
] asks the question, 'Can you trust Enron?' On stewardship issues and publi=
c benefit issues, I've dealt with this company for a decade, often in the m=
ost contentious circumstances, and the answer is, yes."=20
The PUC approved the merger, and it wasn't long before the darkest suspicio=
ns about Enron's plans were vindicated. The company raised rates, tried to =
soak ratepayers with the cost of its failed Trojan nuclear reactor and move=
d to put some of the company's most valuable assets on the block.=20
Enron's motive had indeed been to get access to the hydropower of the North=
west, the cheapest in the country, and to sell it in the California market,=
 the priciest and, in part because of Cavanagh's campaigning for deregulati=
on, the ripest for exploitation. Two years later, the company Cavanagh had =
hailed as "engaged, motivated and committed" put Portland General on the au=
ction block.=20
Today, some House Republicans want to treat the Enron collapse as a crimina=
l matter, while Democrats talk about cleaning up accounting rules and plugg=
ing holes in the regulatory system. The outrage over the inability of Enron=
 employees to sell company stock from their 401(k) plans while higher-ups a=
bsconded with millions may doom President Bush's promised onslaught on Soci=
al Security.=20
There are many morals in Enron's collapse, and the role of the Green Guys s=
eal of approval shouldn't be forgotten.=20

USA: Enron stock has rising value for collectors.
By Philip Klein

(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Dec 28 (Reuters) - Enron Corp.'s stock is rising once again - but=
 don't look for its rebound in Standard & Poor's 500 index listings.=20
Now it's joined a much more select group that includes stocks and bonds fro=
m Czarist Russia, Victorian railroads and countries that no longer exist: C=
ollectors have been snapping up Enron stock certificates as artifacts of th=
e company's spectacular collapse, not on hopes for a recovery.
While Enron's shares were at 58 cents in Friday trading on the New York Sto=
ck Exchange, the physical stock certificate was selling for much more, fetc=
hing as much as $99.95 on the Internet.=20
"It's one of the biggest bankruptcies ever and is quite a collectible," Bob=
 Kerstein, president of a Scripophily.com, a Web site which specializes in =
selling old stock and bond certificates said on Thursday.=20
Kerstein said he sold four of the certificates to a hedge fund manager who =
made a fortune selling Enron stock short. Now the investor plans to give th=
e certificates out as gifts and display a framed one on his wall, like a st=
uffed deer head hanging on the wall of a hunter's study.=20
The Enron certificate is blue and white, with an etched drawing of a brawny=
 man in a hard hat sitting in the foreground of an oil field and a printed =
signature of Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay in the bottom right corner=
.=20
"We just put it up today and we already sold five of them," Kerstein said. =
"A company like Enron everybody wants."=20
Kerstein, whose Web site sells certificates ranging from 19th Century Railr=
oad bonds to recent dead dot-coms such as WebVan, said that he could have s=
old 100 Enron certificates over Christmas if he had them on hand.=20
Collectors of old stocks and bonds, who call their hobby scripophily or 'lo=
ve of ownership,' seek out certificates that have aesthetic value, contain =
rare signatures or have historical significance.=20
"People are always seeking a piece of history that says something about the=
 time" Kerstein said. "Enron says a lot."=20
Enron's stock, which traded at $90.75 at its height in August 2000, hit a l=
ow of 25 cents earlier this month as the company spiraled toward the bigges=
t bankruptcy filing in U.S. history. While investors can still buy the stoc=
k at 58 cents, Kerstein justifies his price by citing brokers fees and char=
ges for issuing physical certificates.=20
Unlike trading on the exchange, the pricing for the certificates is inexact=
 and can vary by condition and other factors. Enron certificates were being=
 bid on eBay Inc.'s auction Web site for as low as $19.=20
Enron's transfer agent EquiServe Inc. said that in September through Novemb=
er it received requests to issue an average of 580 Enron certificates per m=
onth, but has received 3,500 in December alone, because of the interest gen=
erated by the bankruptcy filing.=20
Thomas Carroll, who is the director of sales and marketing for satellite la=
unching company International Launch Services, a joint venture of Lockheed =
Martin Corp. and Russia's Khrunichev Space agency, has been collecting stoc=
k certificates for over a year. He just bought the Enron certificate for se=
ntimental reasons.=20
"I was on the site this morning, and when I saw it I knew I needed to have =
it," he said. Back when Enron was Houston Natural Gas, he worked for a diff=
erent satellite company that helped transmit data on the rate of growth of =
rust in pipelines.=20
But stock certificates are not the only piece of Enron nostalgia out there,=
 as the company's collapse is spawning an industry of its own.=20
On eBay Inc.'s auction website, people are selling Enron watches, Yo Yo's a=
nd mugs. Several parody Web sites have also been set up by ex-Enron workers=
 who are fed up with the company after seeing their 401(k) plans dwindle to=
 a fraction of their value as shares of the company's stock plummeted.=20
The Web sites, laydoff.com, enronx.com and thecrookede.com sell T-shirts wi=
th slogans such as, "I got laid off from Enron and all I got was this lousy=
 T-shirt," "The Execs that Stole Christmas" and "I got Lay'd by Enron," a r=
eference to the company's CEO Ken Lay.=20
When told about what Enron certificates were selling for, company spokeswom=
an Karen Denne couldn't suppress a laugh.=20
"That's a better price than Enron was selling for on its best day," Denne s=

"The government will be looking into this. The SEC (Securities and Exchange=

Enron Wins Court Approval for $309 Mln of Asset Sales (Correct)
2001-12-28 14:57 (New York)

Enron Wins Court Approval for $309 Mln of Asset Sales (Correct)

     (Corrects amount of sale to $309 million in headline and
first paragraph.)

     New York, Dec. 28 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the once-
dominant energy trader reorganizing in bankruptcy court, won a
judge's permission to complete two previously planned asset sales
that will raise a total of about $309 million.

     Enron plans to sell two wind-power facilities in Texas for
about $175 million to Columbus, Ohio-based American Electric Power
Co. Enron's Enron Wind Development Corp. unit, which isn't part of
the Houston-based parent's bankruptcy case, owns the power
generating facilities.

     In a separate sale, a partnership run by AltaGas Services
Inc. and TransCanada Pipelines Ltd.'s TransCanada Energy unit will
pay about $134 million for Enron Canada Power Corp.'s right to
electricity from a plant in Alberta, Canada. As with Enron Wind,
the Canadian unit isn't part of Enron's bankruptcy.

     U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez in Manhattan
approved Enron's request to proceed with the transactions at a
hearing late Thursday. The sales are scheduled to close today,
according to Enron's bankruptcy attorney, Brian Rosen, of New
York's Weil, Gotshal & Manges. Closing costs and fees will
slightly reduce the overall proceeds from the sales, he said.

     Enron sought Chapter 11 protection from creditors earlier
this month, in the largest bankruptcy filing ever. The company
sought refuge in bankruptcy court after Dynegy Inc. withdrew a $23
billion rescue in late November.

     Shares of Enron, which began the year at $83.13, fell 4 cents
to 56 cents in midafternoon trading. The shares have lost more
than 99 percent of their value in the past year. American Electric
shares rose 4 cents to $43.25.

                             Windmills

     American Electric agreed to buy 107 wind turbines in west
Texas that can generate power for San Antonio, AEP spokesman Tom
Ayres said. Although Enron Wind hasn't sought bankruptcy
protection ``both sides felt that the court should bless'' the
transaction, Ayres said. The windmills can generate enough power
to light about 160,500 average U.S. homes.

     Other purchasers of Enron's assets want the company to gain
court approval for its bankruptcy plan before completing the
transactions. As examples, Enron in court papers cited its
proposed sale of Enron Oil & Gas India Ltd. to BG Group PLC for
$380 million and its proposed sale of Enron LNG Power Atlantic to
an unidentified buyer for $266 million.

     Enron LNG Power Atlantic owns Enron's stake in Eco Electrica,
a power plant and natural gas terminal in Puerto Rico. Mirant
Corp., an Atlanta-based power producer, agreed in July to buy Eco
Electrica from Enron and Edison International which also holds a
stake, for about $600 million.

                        ``Core Operations''

     Mirant Chief Executive Marce Fuller said last week that Dec.
31 is the deadline to complete the transaction. Enron's bankruptcy
made it unlikely the purchase will occur, she said.

     Enron Oil and Gas India owns 30 percent stakes in oil and gas
fields on the west coast of India. The sale has been held up by a
dispute between BG Group, and Enron's two Indian partners,
Reliance Industries Inc. and Oil & Natural Gas Corp. Ltd., over
who will manage the operations.

     B.G. Group said Monday it was continuing negotiations
although its agreement with Enron had expired.

     The asset sales are part of a plan Enron began more than a
year ago to return to its ``core operations'' and ``derive as much
value as possible from enterprises'' it bought or developed, the
company said in court papers. Enron said it's ``critical to the
success'' of its reorganization that its affiliates complete the
transactions started before the Dec. 2 bankruptcy filing.

Enron's Woes Cost New York Pension Funds $109 Mln, Paper Says
2001-12-28 12:05 (New York)

     New York, Dec. 28 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. is facing a
lawsuit from New York City over $109 million in pension-fund
losses because of investments in the company's stock, the New York
Daily News reported.

     The city filed suit against the energy trading company
because of ``accounting irregularities and fraud involved here
with the company,'' said David Neustadt, a spokesman for
Controller Alan Hevesi. Enron declined to comment, the paper said.

     The controller's office oversees pension funds worth
$85 billion for teachers, police, firemen, board of education
workers and others. Spokesmen for the police, fire, and teachers'
unions declined to comment, and a spokeswoman for District Council
37, the city's largest public employees union, didn't return
calls, the paper said.

     The news comes after reports that New York State's
$112 billion pension fund lost $58 million on Enron, the paper
said, citing state Controller Carl McCall's office.

Bush `Concerned,' Says Government Must Look Into Enron Collapse

Bush `Concerned,' Says Government Must Look Into Enron Collapse

     Crawford, Texas, Dec. 28 (Bloomberg) -- President George W.
Bush said the government needs to look into what happened at Enron
Corp. and he's concerned about employees who lost their savings
when the Houston-based energy trader collapsed.

     ``The government will be looking into this,'' Bush told
reporters during a visit to his Texas ranch. ``I'm deeply
concerned about the citizens of Houston who worked for Enron and
lost savings.  It's very troubling.''

     Enron this month filed the largest Chapter 11 bankruptcy case
in history after its credit rating was cut to junk levels and it
couldn't raise cash to back trades. The company last month
restated five years of earnings to reflect losses and debt held by
affiliated partnerships.

     The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Justice
Department and Congress are investigating Enron's collapse. Former
chief executive Jeff Skilling and former chief financial officer
Andrew Fastow are named as defendants in more than 40 lawsuits
filed by investors and former employees who lost retirement
accounts after Enron's shares plunged. The stock, which began the
year at $83.13, traded this morning at 58 cents.

     The company and its employees, including chairman and chief
executive Ken Lay, have long been top financial supporters of Bush
and other Republicans. Enron and its employees have donated
$572,350 to Bush over the course of his political career.

     Bush said he's had no contact with Lay or other Enron
officials in the last six weeks.

     Enron and Lay have had close ties to the Bush administration.
Lay had a private meeting with Vice President Dick Cheney as the
White House shaped an energy policy that called for an increase in
domestic energy sources. Lay also participated in roundtables with
Bush and other business executives about the economy.

Chris/Dave -

Starting at 5pm today, the EGM Fundamentals sites will only be accessible to EGM employees.  Should anyone in the gas world wish to access the sites, an eRequest will need to be submitted for consideration.  Users can find EGM Fundamentals in eRequest by selecting Applications and then searching on EGM.  The second option, "egm Fundy Website Users" should be selected.  If you have any questions, give me a call.

Tom, Ina has sent an email (below), letting us know that some people can come in on Sunday to test their computers/applications.  Do you think it's a good idea for anyone to come in on Sunday, or should we leave it alone and have everyone come in early Monday morning?

Assistants:

It was approved for some essential people to come in on Sunday to test applications and systems only. There will not be time for unpacking.  That will need to be done on Monday morning.
Please check to make sure if these people will be coming in on Sunday and if there needs to be any corrections, please let me know as soon as possible.

GAS TRADING TEAM

Can you guys please prepare a coordinated list of no more than 35 people that can come in on Sunday between 2- 6:00 pm to test trading applications.  Due to the combination of the moves (over 900 people) the IT group wants to ensure that your applications are functioning properly before Monday morning.  

The list should be weighted heavier towards those folks who can identify system problems rather than unpacking boxes.  There will still be alot of the move team on the floor finishing installations etc.  

Please provide the list by end of business today (thursday).  

Thank you!
Tammy

As you all know, our move is scheduled for this weekend.  Hopefully,  you and your groups are all progressing well in your preparations for the move this Friday. Please take the time to read the information contained in this message because most of the information contains reminders or FYI items and will be important to you and your group.  Please forward this to those in your group that may need this information.  

?	Voicemail instructions - Please have everyone in your group clear all new voicemail messages by 5:00 PM, Friday, 11/16.  All saved messages, greetings and recorded names will be saved.  If a message is left before cutover the message will be saved, but the message light will not be displayed when you arrive.  As a precautionary meassure please check voice mail upon your arrival Monday morning even if the message light isn't on.  

?	Building access - ECS will not be available for general access until Monday morning at 5:00 AM.  Due to the gas and power moves being combined, it is unlikely that the move team will be prepared for the POC's to come in on Sunday to unpack.  (Separate instructions will be generated for those who are needed to test trading applications.)  NOTE: Only those whose names have been approved and submitted to security will be allowed access on Sunday.
o	Monday - 5:00 AM for all employees

?	Security & badges -  All POC team members should be familiar with the routes into ECS as we discussed at our recent move meeting.  Please be sure to share this information with all of the people in your group.  If you need additional copies of the floor plans that have the access routes highlighted, please contact Carli Smith (5-3473). Please stress to everyone to have their badges with them at all times.  No one will be allowed access without their badge.  If anyone tries to access the building from the garage via the skyring and they do not have their badge, they will be sent back through the garage to the street level to walk across the street to the round kiosk in the Enron building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed back to ECS via the 2nd floor and the skyring.

?	Move team colors - As mentioned at the move meeting, the following is a list of the color designations (vests) for the various teams that will be on the floor when we move in.  
o	Red - Move Team
o	Orange - Desktop Support/IT
o	Green - Telephony

?	Newspaper subscriptions - The delivery location for all newspaper subscriptions need to be changed to ECS 05/06.  It is our intention to have all daily newspapers delivered to the mail desk located in the ECS 2nd floor corridor.  It will be the responsibility of the assistants to either pick up the papers for their group or designate someone in their group to pick up the papers.  If your papers continue to be delivered to your old floor of ECN, contact Sunny Rodgers (3-6116).

?	Move boxes -  Please encourage your group to pack and bring no more than about 6 boxes per person.  You may call Facilities (3-6300) if you need to request additional boxes.

?	Move labels -  If you run out of labels or if you are missing any labels, please call Carli Smith (5-3473) to have additional or missing labels printed.

?	Laptops - Important - Please ensure that all cable locks have been removed from all laptop computers by 5:00 PM on Friday.  If any cable locks are left on the computers they will be destroyed by the move team in order to move the computers as scheduled.

.	Bottled water - Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispenses filtered water.  The large bottles of water (5 gallon) will not be allowed on the floor.  We would also like   to discourage the use of small bottles of water due to limited storage space and the availability of filtered water at several locations.  

?	Phone sets - Although most of you are aware of this, we just wanted to remind you that there will be only one phone on each desk - either a turret or an Avaya, but not both.  Do not tag your phones, a new phone will be waiting for each person on their desk in the new building

I hope I have covered some of the outstanding questions or issues you might have, but if I have missed something, please let me know.  Thanks so much for all your help and hard work.

Subject:	Update on Employee Expense Reimbursement


Post-Petition Expenses

Effective immediately, the processing of expense reimbursement for business expenses incurred by employees after Enron Corp.'s Chapter 11 filing (after December 2nd) has returned to normal.  Expenses will be reimbursed promptly upon submission.  Employees should conduct business travel in the ordinary course of business as approved by direct supervisors.  New travel and entertainment guidelines regarding business travel and other employee expenses will be forthcoming.  In the meantime, please use discretion as you incur expenses.  All expenditures should be made with consideration given to Enron's current financial situation.

Pre-Petition Expenses

We will immediately begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses for current and former employees (incurred prior to the December 2nd Chapter 11 filing) up to a maximum of $5,000.  We understand that a number of employees have pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000.  However, under the first day orders of the bankruptcy court, there is a $15,000 allowance per employee for unpaid pre-petition compensation, benefits, and related employee expenses.  This $15,000 cap was imposed without input from Enron management and counsel.  We have sought clarification from the bankruptcy court to assure that this $15,000 cap does NOT include the reimbursement of medical, dental, or vision related expenses.

We have commenced a manual review of every individual with pending pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000.  Even prior to clarification from the court regarding the medical/dental/vision expense issue, we will begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000 and up to $15,000 as soon as we can verify that the aggregate reimbursements to an individual employee have not exceeded the $15,000 cap.  Unfortunately, since this will be a manual process, it will take some time to work through.  Employees with pre-petition business expenses in excess of $5,000 can assist us with this manual review process by providing a brief email summary of their situation, including the total amount of pending pre-petition medical/dental/vision claims, to expensereport@enron.com.

Thank you for your patience.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron arranges first gas pipeline import into Italy
Enron has continued its pioneering activities in the Continental gas market by arranging the first gas import into Italy.  The Italian team worked with the Continental Gas desk to arrange this strategically important agreement with Blugas SpA., the wholesale gas company formed by the municipalities of Cremona, Lodi, Mantova and Pavia in north-eastern Italy.  Enron has sourced 100,000 cubic metres per day of natural gas from northern Europe to transport to Italy, transiting it through Germany and Switzerland, despite fierce resistance from Ruhrgas and TransitGas respectively.  

Aside from isolated LNG imports by incumbent monopolies this is the first time that any company has managed to import natural gas by pipeline into Italy since the Italian gas sector was officially liberalised in August 2000. The gas, which started flowing at 06.00 on Thursday 17th May 2001, will be used to meet the needs of two thirds of Blugas' residential customers within the four municipalities. The current contract lasts for five months.

Congratulations to Fabio Greco, Carsten Haack, Didier Magne, Michael Schuh, Marco Lantieri and Daniela Uguccioni.

Enron in the Middle East 
Enron has relinquished its stake in Dolphin Energy, the joint venture company formed to develop gas reserves in Qatar.
Enron has agreed to transfer its 24.5 per cent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offset Group (UOG), the majority shareholder. The agreement allows Enron to deploy capital elsewhere and gives UOG the opportunity to seek new partners before the project moves into its next phase.

Development of the Emden/Oude gas hub moves ahead fast
An important milestone in the evolution of the new gas trading hub on the Dutch-German
border was reached last week. Last Friday some of the major European gas players held a meeting to officially establish the Emden/Oude gas hub. Although Enron had already initiated the development of the Emden/Oude hub by making a market through EnronOnline as early as December 2000, the goal of this meeting was to set up a working group similar to the Zeebrugge focus group who can  work on setting a legal framework for the Emden/Oude hub. 

Enron was elected as the only new market entrant in this group, reflecting the high level of respect industry peers have for Enron as a major player in the Continental gas market -- even from incumbents!

Enron Probe
2002-01-30 15:18 (New York)

   By Kathy Chu 
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 
  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--The results of an internal investigation into Enron
Corp.'s (ENRNQ) collapse may be released early next week, a company lawyer said
Wednesday. 
  The report will be posted online, at the Web site of the  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court of the Southern District of New York.
The report is the culmination of Enron's three-month effort to account for
off-balance sheet partnerships that the company used to keep debt off its books
and to maintain a healthy credit rating. 
  The transactions led the company last November to write down $1.2 billion of
shareholder equity and to restate four years worth of earnings. 
  Enron formed the special task force in October, hoping to restore investors'
confidence in an energy-trading company that had begun to falter. 
  The committee is made up of outside directors led by William Powers Jr., dean
of the University of Texas law school. William McLucas - former head of the
Securities and Exchange Commission's enforcement division and a partner at the
Washington, D.C., law firm Wilmer Cutler Pickering - represents the task force.
  McLucas didn't return phone calls seeking comment, and Powers couldn't
immediately be reached for comment.
The committee served as a liaison between Enron and the SEC, which launched
its own investigation into the company's  accounting practices last year. 
  Deloitte & Touche serves as the task force's independent  accountant. 
  The results of the investigation are expected to shed more light into the
complex books of a company that had more  than 3,500 units and numerous
off-balance sheet partnerships. 
  Edward Ketz, an associate professor of accounting at Penn State's Smeal
College of Business, said that it's unlikely that more significant surprises
will come out of the report. 
  But, he said, "if there's any further bombshell, the real damage will be done
with the accounting profession itself. It may give greater weight for Congress
to do something (about accounting guidelines)."
News of the internal report's release came during a hearing before Judge
Arthur J. Gonzalez of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New
York. 
  Wednesday, Gonzalez approved the retention of two law firms, Weil Gotshal &
Manges and Togut Segal & Segal, as attorneys for the debtor. 
  In doing so, the judge overruled an objection by Enron creditor Wiser Oil Co.
(WZR), which is owed about $7 million  in trade debt, asking that a separate
legal team be appointed for Enron's core unit, Enron North America. This
subsidiary includes the wholesale energy-trading operations,  which generated
90% of the company's $101 billion in revenue last year. 
  Gonzalez noted that the creditor's concerns - one being that funds from the
Enron North America unit will be used to  benefit other subsidiaries - are
likely to be addressed in the next month, at court hearings to consider motions
for a trustee, examiner and a new cash-management system. 
  The bankruptcy court, earlier this week, approved Milbank Tweed as the law
firm for Enron's official creditors  committee, after no objections were filed.
Also Wednesday, Judge Gonzalez disclosed that his wife is part of a New York
City pension fund involved in Houston litigation against Enron. But he said
this doesn't disqualify him from presiding over the Enron case. 
  "The court has examined and does not believe that my partiality will be
compromised," said Gonzalez. 
  When New York City pension matters are brought before the court, Gonzalez
will "take steps" to ensure that no conflicts of interest exist, he said. 
  The New York City pension funds along with the Florida State Board of
Administration have asked the bankruptcy court to enter a detailed order
requiring Enron to preserve its books and records. The hearing is set for Feb.
5. 
  The city and state pension funds are seeking the role of  co-lead plaintiffs
in class-action lawsuits filed against Enron in Texas, claiming securities
violations and fraud by company executives. 
  In total, the New York City pension funds claim a loss of $109 million from
Enron-related investments, while the Florida State Board claims losses of $334
million. 
  The New York City pension funds made up about 20% of his  wife's retirement
fund, said Gonzalez.

Ex-Enron Workers Plead With Congress For Financial Help

01/30/2002

WASHINGTON (AP)--Laid-off Enron (ENRNQ) workers pressed for help Wednesday on Capitol Hill, putting faces to some of the stories of retirement nest eggs lost when the company collapsed. 
Organized by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, several dozen workers piled in buses to make the 25-hour trip from Houston to appeal for help paying for mortgages, health care, groceries, children's tuition and other living expenses.
"I lost everything, because I believed in Enron," Jessie Patterson told House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo, and other Democratic lawmakers. Earlier, the workers met with AFL-CIO officials. 
Gephardt pledged Democrats' help to assuage "this ... tragedy of great proportions." 
He said Enron's implosion, the largest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history, should spur changes in laws governing pension and 401(k) plans that would give people more control over investments and greater protection against corporate mismanagement. 
Enron's generous political donations and attempts to influence energy policy also should also spark congressional passage of long-stalled legislation aimed at reducing the influence of big money in politics, Gephardt said. 
"I believe with all my heart that we have to clean up politics in this country," he said. 
Gwen Gray, who worked in Enron human resources, said she processed millions of dollars in bonuses that were paid to retain key executives in the two months leading up to the bankruptcy, while workers were given 30 minutes to get out of the building without severance pay. 
Almost 95% of Gray's 401(k) was invested in company stock. She said she has $109 left, "and that will pay my light bill that's due Monday." 
Several workers said they were having difficulty finding work because companies in the Houston area have been reluctant to hire Enron workers. Many feared that speaking out would hurt job prospects or target them for retaliation. 
"We're not here just for a handout," said Kathy Benedict, who can't afford the $300 a month to extend her health insurance benefits. "We need jobs." 
Several workers said lawmakers should change federal bankruptcy laws to make workers and their retirement plans secured creditors that would be at the top of the list for available assets. Workers now come after secured creditors. 
"Maybe it's too late for us, but there are other people out there," said Dennis Vegas. "This could happen to other Americans."

Former Enron Employee Warned Lay of Energy Contract Losses
2002-01-30 16:00 (New York)

     Washington, Jan. 30 (Bloomberg) -- A former Enron Corp. manager warned then-Chief Executive Kenneth Lay in August that the company was hiding at least $500 million in losses on energy contracts, adding to evidence that senior executives knew about the company's growing debt, U.S. lawmakers said.
     Enron Energy Services, the unit that advised businesses and property owners on energy use and operated heating, lighting and air conditioning equipment on their behalf, "had been doing deals for two years and was losing money on almost all the deals they booked,'' Margaret Ceconi, a former EES manager, wrote to Lay in an Aug. 29 e-mail. "They are trying to cover up their dumb decisions.''
     Representatives Billy Tauzin, chairman of the House commerce committee, and John Dingell, the panel's senior Democrat, included a copy of the e-mail in a letter to Lay asking him whether he responded to Ceconi and or discussed her allegations with Enron's accounting and legal departments.
     The commerce committee is one of 10 congressional panels investigating Enron's collapse. The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission also are looking into what led Enron, whose stock rose as high as $82 a share last year, to file the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history on Dec. 2. Lawmakers have predicted that changes in the law and criminal indictments would result from the probes.
     Ceconi's e-mail echoed one sent by Sherron Watkins, an Enron vice president, in mid-August to Lay. In that note, Watkins said that said former Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Skilling had ignored warnings from other company executives about conflicts of interest in partnerships the company created to hide the size of its debt.
     "One can only surmise that the removal of Jeff Skilling was an action taken by the board to correct the wrong doings of the various management teams at Enron,'' Ceconi wrote.
     Skilling quit Enron last August and Lay returned to the job. Lay resigned last week as chief executive.
     One area investigators are looking into is whether executives of Enron, once the largest energy trader, misled shareholders and employees before it restated earnings in November.

Former Enron Employee Told Lay Earnings Misrepresented
By Bryan Lee

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Kenneth Lay, the former chairman and chief executive at Enron Corp. (ENRNQ), received at least two warnings last August that questionable - and potentially illegal - accounting practices would become the company's financial undoing.
Both memos warned that skepticism and increasing scrutiny in the wake of the surprise resignation that month of Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling would bring the company's financial plight to light. 
The first, now widely reported, came from Enron Vice President Sherron Watkins, and discussed the various off-the-books transactions the company had engaged in, which ultimately contributed to the company's financial undoing later in the year. 
"I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting scandals," Watkins wrote prophetically. 
Now congressional investigators have released another memo, sent to Lay on Aug. 29 via e-mail, from a recently laid-off employee who worked in sales for nine months at Enron Energy Services. 
Margaret Ceconi, who had been recruited from GE Capital (GE), asked her e-mail be forwarded to Enron's board, warning, "The house of cards (is) falling." 
Democratic staff on the House Energy and Commerce Committee released the e-mail Wednesday, with Lay being scheduled to testify Monday before both the House Financial Services Committee and the Senate Commerce Committee. 
Ceconi's e-mail goes into some detail about huge losses stemming from a number of retail electricity deals with commercial customers, and complains she was "fraudulently" recruited to the company. 
The e-mail ticks off a number of money-losing deals, and warns of potential Securities and Exchange Commission violations for "knowingly misrepresent(ing) EES's earnings" by hiding the losses in Enron's profitable wholesale electricity business. 
Ceconi warned the losses would add up to more than $500 million. "Rumor on the 7th floor is that it is closer to $1 billion," she wrote. 
"But somehow EES, to everyone's amazement, reported earnings for the 2nd quarter," she continued, warning of accounting standards violations. 
That EES misrepresented its earnings "is common knowledge among all the EES employees, and is actually joked about. But it should be taken seriously," Ceconi warned, citing industry analysts who "know what's going on, they just can't confirm it. YET."

Ex-Enron Employees Ask Democrats for Secured Creditor Status
2002-01-30 16:33 (New York)

     Washington, Jan. 30 (Bloomberg) -- Former Enron Corp. employees today asked lawmakers to give them the same status as secured creditors in the company's bankruptcy and a bailout like the one the ailing airline industry received after Sept. 11.
     "If I was a flood victim, the Red Cross would have been at my door the next morning,'' said Deborah Johnson, an ex-employee. "We want relief.''
     About a dozen former Enron staffers from Houston went to the Capitol to meet with House Democrats today on a trip sponsored by the AFL-CIO federation of labor unions and the Reverend Jesse Jackson, chairman of the Rainbow-PUSH Coalition.
     The fired employees said they were frustrated that retention bonuses were granted to executives days before Enron filed for bankruptcy, while they can't cash their $4,500 severance checks because that money is tied up in bankruptcy court.
     ``They got bounced $4,500 checks and executives get a sound $100 million check the day before,'' Jackson said.
     As unsecured creditors, many Enron employees will receive money they're owed by the company only after secured creditors are paid.
     Shareholders are suing Enron, once the world's No. 1 energy trader, claiming that the company and its accountants hid some $600 million in losses from investors, triggering the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history.
     Representative Shelia Jackson Lee, a Democrat from Houston, called for hearings to examine bankruptcy laws during an informal meeting with the employees.
     "The bankruptcy court closed the door on your severance,'' said Jackson Lee, adding that House hearings would look into ways Enron could be forced to set aside money for employees before it continues its restructuring.

Not Forthcoming

     The employees also asked for legislation to give them the same status as secured creditors in the bankruptcy case and said they're seeking the same sort of bailout that lawmakers gave the ailing airline industry following Sept. 11.
     Many of the employees blamed Enron executives for not being forthcoming about the company's financial situation.
     "I've lost my job, I've lost the money I contributed to the 401k plan, and I had stock options I did not exercise,'' because company officials predicted the stock value would rise, said Monique VanVooren-Shankel, a former Enron employee. "It evaporated.''
     A handful of Texas Democrats at a press conference with House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri and the fired workers vowed to push legislation that would give employees higher status in bankruptcy cases.
     "The current bankruptcy code doesn't provide secured creditor status for 401k participants, and that needs to change,'' said Representative Ken Bentsen. Bentsen's bill would place 401k plan participants at the top of the list of unsecured creditors in the event of a bankruptcy where the plan fiduciary misled investors.
     Bentsen and Jackson Lee, along with 43 percent of the rest of the House, received contributions from Enron.

USA: New Enron president no stranger to corporate storms.
By Dan Wilchins

01/30/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

NEW YORK, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Jeff McMahon, promoted Tuesday to president and chief operating officer at scandal-wracked Enron Corp. , has a knack for finding himself in the middle of corporate maelstroms. 
His ability to deal with trouble in a straight-shooting style was likely attractive to a company desperately needing some truth serum.
McMahon is said to have openly questioned some of the major off-balance sheet partnerships set up by Enron that contributed to the energy giant filing the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history in December. 
As a company insider, he understands the inner workings of Enron's complex dealings. That asset could help Enron in its survival strategy. But it could also prove to be a liability, if inquiries about off-balance sheet structures raise concerns about McMahon's involvement. 
The boyish-faced McMahon, a trained accountant known for his political savvy and strong sales ability, has held a number of senior roles at Enron, including executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp., and president and chief executive officer of Enron Industrial Markets. 
Enron isn't the first place in which McMahon, 41, has found himself at the center of a major corporate controversy. 
A decade ago, he was a young internal auditor caught up in a case that gained almost as much notoriety as Enron, as trading losses at his former employer, the U.S. subsidiary of German industrial giant Metallgesellschaft AG, nearly bankrupted the parent company. 
A HEDGE GONE AWRY 
In the early 1990s, McMahon was an internal auditor at the U.S. unit of Metallgesellschaft, MG Corp., which eventually lost more than $1 billion from oil futures trading, making headlines throughout the world. 
He wrote a series of internal audit reports critical of risk management and accounting procedures at the MG Corp. subsidiary responsible for the losses, MG Refining and Marketing, Inc. (MGR&M). 
"(McMahon) was one of the heroes at MG Corp.," said Bob Bernstein, a lawyer at Kaye Scholer LLP in New York, who represents Metallgesellschaft, now known as mg Technologies . 
Figuring out exactly what went wrong at MG Corp. is a cottage industry. The case is studied in business schools, and many former employees of the company and some academics insist that in the long-term, the MG trading strategy would have made money. 
MG Corp. was caught out in a trading strategy that amounted to a huge bet on oil futures prices. When oil prices dropped in 1993, the futures positions hemorrhaged cash, threatening the collapse of the entire company. 
"They were involved in giant speculation," said Jeff Parsons, an economist at Charles River Associates in Boston, who has studied MG Corp. The oil futures were meant to hedge longer-term supply contracts, but also provide a source of profit. 
RAISING RED FLAGS 
Internal audit reports obtained by Reuters indicate that McMahon's audit team was sounding alarms even before MG Corp. began hemorrhaging cash, and continued to do so as the problems persisted. 
An audit of risk management procedures at MGR&M dated August 27, 1993, found that risk management "require(d) improvement," The amount of risk capital committed to the trading was "much larger than anticipated in the original business plan," according to the report. 
Although the internal audit team was told that the Board of Directors had approved changes to the business plan, there was no formal written approval of the changes, the report continued. 
"The lack of formal approval presents the risk that deviations from the approved plan occur, go undetected, and expose the Company to financial loss," McMahon's report said. 
Management at the time ignored him, but after the losses were sustained, new management was brought in, saw McMahon's reports, considered additional evidence, and fired the architects of the strategy, Kaye Scholer's Bernstein said. 
MG managed through the crisis and continued to operate, though with significant help from bankers in a major bailout operation. 
A SIMILAR ROLE 
At Enron, McMahon may have played a role similar to that at MG Corp. 
According to a letter sent from Sherron Watkins, a vice president at Enron, to former Chairman Kenneth Lay, which was written after Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling resigned in August, McMahon was highly concerned about the off-balance sheet LJM partnerships, a series of deals set up by Enron. 
McMahon, then Enron's treasurer, demanded that five issues regarding LJM be addressed, if he was to remain in that position, Watkins said. Three days later, Skilling offered him the chief executive officer spot at Enron Industrial Markets, the letter said. 
For his part, Skilling has said that McMahon did raise concerns - but his primary issue was the impact of LJM on his compensation, according to Judy Leon, a spokeswoman for Skilling in Washington, D.C. 
OFF-BALANCE SHEET DEALS MAY PROVE NETTLESOME 
McMahon reports to Stephen Cooper, who on Tuesday was named acting chief executive. 
This joins Cooper, an outsider with a restructuring background, with McMahon, an insider not implicated directly in any wrongdoing. Still, McMahon was a senior financial official while a series of off-balance-sheet transactions were structured, and many of them had cross investments in one another, a banker who knows McMahon said. 
McMahon has so far successfully avoided criticism for his involvement with off-balance sheet structures, the banker said. "But who knows if he'll get dragged into this?," he added.

Enron Energy Services To Surrender Illinois License
By Jon Kamp

01/30/2002
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)- Enron Energy Services is voluntarily giving up its certificate to serve commercial and industrial customers in Illinois, once a key growth area for the Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) unit, a spokeswoman confirmed Wednesday.
The Illinois Commerce Commission decided Tuesday to revoke the retail electric provider certificate held by Enron Energy Services, because its parent's debt rating is below investment grade. Though EES could fight the order, it doesn't plan to, spokeswoman Peggy Mahoney said. 
"It became clear that we weren't going to be able to keep our license because of the debt rating," she said. 
EES is now facing similar issues in other states, including Texas and California, where it has a particularly large presence, Mahoney said. While it is fighting to keep customers in other areas, the clear financial benchmarks required for suppliers in Illinois leave EES with few options, she said. 
Mahoney was unable to list the number of customers EES had in Illinois, but the company was establishing a strong foothold in Chicago before it joined Enron in bankruptcy court in December. EES signed its first Chicago-area energy management deal with the Archdiocese of Chicago in 1998, then added other high-profile customers like the City of Chicago and PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) unit Quaker Oats Co., among many others. 
EES had aggressive growth plans in the region. In an early October interview, before Enron's troubles became widely known, EES Chief Operating Officer Jeremy Blachman said Enron planned to build its share of the Chicago energy sales market to 8% to 10% from less than 1%. Chicago accounts for the lion's share of the $6 billion to $8 billion Illinois market. 
Now, the company is quietly moving in the opposite direction, trimming its profile in Illinois. The City of Chicago, Quaker and the Archdiocese have all recently walked away from their contracts with EES. In early January, a New York bankruptcy judge approved Enron's request to terminate many other Chicago-area deals, Mahoney said. 
Nationwide, EES received the power it needed to fulfill contracts from Enron's wholesale unit. Once Enron all but ceased power trading, EES was left to scramble for power from other suppliers. To date, it has managed to keep most of its 32,000 contracts while it tries to figure out how to restructure and maintain service, Mahoney said. 
But EES wasn't actually supplying Illinois customers with power. Instead, it was serving primarily as a billing agent, helping its Illinois clients manage their power needs, Mahoney said. It's still unclear whether EES needs its state certificate to serve as a billing agent, ICC Commissioner Ruth Kretschmer said Tuesday. 
Regardless, the company may not want to continue those operations, Mahoney said. EES was waiting for Illinois' young competitive retail market to mature before it signed actual deals to supply energy, using its billing-agent business to get its foot in the door. 
"We were in the process of putting in place the ability for us to supply physically," Mahoney said. "We had thought that was imminent." 
Now, Enron must decide whether it is still worth maintaining billing-agent and energy-management deals in Illinois when there is no possibility they will evolve into energy-supply contracts, Mahoney said. EES could also apply for a new supplier certificate in the future. 
"That's exactly what we're reviewing right now," Mahoney said. "It's unclear what we will ultimately do in Illinois."

USA: UPDATE 1-Probe needed into Enron's California deals-FERC.
By Chris Baltimore

01/30/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

WASHINGTON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - A member of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said Wednesday that the agency should investigate whether bankrupt Enron Corp. manipulated wholesale electricity prices in California. 
Enron, accused by Western politicians of raising prices in long-term supply contracts following California's power crisis, has denied any wrongdoing.
"We need to clear up that lingering doubt," said FERC commissioner Nora Brownell, a Republican appointee to the agency last summer. "If there was market manipulation, we need to find it and we need to deal with it." 
Brownell, speaking to reporters after a routine FERC meeting, made her comments after FERC Chairman Pat Wood testified on Tuesday before the Senate Energy Committee about Enron's impact on U.S. energy markets. Wood indicated during the hearing a willingness to open an agency investigation of Enron at the request of West Coast politicians. 
Enron supported Brownell's appointment to FERC because she was a free market advocate while a member of the Pennsylvania public utilities commission. 
The Houston-based company was among several independent power producers that enjoyed big increases in revenues early last year after Western spot market prices for wholesale power soared tenfold, to as high as $400 per megawatt hour. 
The electricity crisis was linked to California's failed deregulation scheme that did not encourage new plant construction and barred the state's utilities from passing through higher wholesale prices to consumers. 
The state eventually signed long-term supply contracts for some $42 billion worth of wholesale power supplies during coming years. Those contracts have been criticized by activist groups and some politicians as locking in prices well above market levels. 
ALLEGED OVERCHARGES 
Still pending before a FERC administrative judge is California's demand for some $9 billion in alleged overcharges by Enron and a dozen other wholesale suppliers. That case is unlikely to be determined for several more months. 
Brownell was noncommittal on what action FERC should take if any market manipulation was found to have occurred with Enron's sales into California. 
"I think there are tools we have to deal with the conclusion that someone manipulated the market," Brownell said. So far, there is no price data to show Enron did anything wrong, she said. 
"We need to get to the underlying facts of the case," she added. 
FERC has not officially opened an investigation yet but is expecting a formal request from Democratic Senators Dianne Feinstein of California and Maria Cantwell of Washington, an agency spokesman said. 
Enron is accused of raising electricity prices in long-term supply contracts negotiated with the state of California following its power crisis. 
Data presented at the Senate panel's Tuesday hearing by an independent power market analyst showed West Coast forward prices for wholesale power plunged by 30 percent on Dec. 3, the day after Enron declared the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history. 
Some Western senators said the data indicated Enron had inflated power prices before its bankruptcy. Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, said he wanted to "lift the veil of secrecy" around Enron's wholesale power transactions in the West.

GAO to Sue White House for Energy Task Force Records

Wednesday, January 30, 2002
FOX News
WASHINGTON - In an unprecedented move, the General Accounting Office will sue the White House for access to Vice President Dick Cheney's energy task force records, Fox News has learned.
Unless the "GAO gets the information they want or is in good faith negotiations, we're headed for court" a GAO official told Fox News on Wednesday.
The official said that in recent GAO discussions with congressional investigators, it has been "clear the White House is telling their side of the story, significantly misrepresenting certain facts"
GAO officials were calling congressional leaders at the Capitol Wednesday morning to tell them of the decision. An official announcement explaining the GAO's reasoning was expected after noon. 
It will be the first time in the GAO's 80-year existence that it has sued the executive branch. The process of filing the lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Washington is expected to take two to four weeks. 
A decision had been expected from GAO Comptroller General David Walker, leader of Congress's investigative arm, all week. The GAO wants to force Cheney, who ran the task force, to turn over documents on the meetings held last year with business executives as the Bush administration crafted a new national energy policy. 
Some of the meetings included officials from the now-collapsed Enron Corp., a Houston-based energy broker with deep ties to Bush. 
Although lawyers for the White House and the agency had continued talks this week, Cheney said on Sunday that the dispute "probably will get resolved in court." 
In resisting the GAO, Cheney insists that providing the list of industry executives would harm his ability to receive advice in the future, and that the congressional investigators are overstepping their bounds. The GAO, as a congressional agency, insists it has the authority to request the information. 
Any GAO lawsuit would be highly controversial on Capitol Hill. The agency's investigation began after Democrats on April 19 requested that the GAO investigate the conduct, operations and funding of the Cheney energy task force. 
On Tuesday, some Republicans had threatened to try to block the suit. 
"I think it may come to that," said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
Congress' investigative arm shouldn't be "trying to impose disclosure on internal White House meetings to determine policy," Hatch said. "If you have to do that, pretty soon there wouldn't be any meetings." 
House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said he and House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., planned to "talk to the agency." 
Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said he was researching to see whether the GAO would be overstepping its authority by taking on the administration. 
"My concerns are that it would encroach upon the deliberative process and make it impossible for the vice president at the direction of the president to make a recommendation," Specter said. "It's also a tricky area on executive privilege." 
The San Francisco Chronicle reported Wednesday that then-Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay gave Cheney a three-page document last April detailing the energy trading company's arguments against price caps or other measures to stabilize electricity prices in California. 
"Events in California and in other parts of the country demonstrated that the benefits of competition have yet to be realized and have not reached consumers," the memo said. 
The newspaper said some of the positions included in the memo were included in Cheney's energy plan. 
An Enron spokesman told the newspaper that Lay gave the memo to Cheney. Mary Matalin, an adviser to Cheney, said the energy plan included input from many sources. 
On Tuesday, an energy consultant suggested to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee that Enron may have been using largely secret trades to manipulate energy markets. 
Robert McCullough, a consultant whose clients include several Northwest utilities, testified that in the week after Enron announced its bankruptcy, the "forward price" of electricity in the West fell sharply. Enron had been a key trader in this market, which is used as a hedge against future power price changes and is unregulated. 
"That certainly raises the question about whether Enron was manipulating the West Coast market" by keeping prices artificially high, Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said in response to the consultant's testimony. 
McCullough said "the clear implication is that Enron may have been using its market dominance to set forward prices." 
Other energy experts said other reasons may have been behind the price decline. Lawrence Makovich, a power industry expert at Cambridge Energy Research Associates, said it would be impossible to determine simply from the decline in price whether prices were manipulated. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission told the Senate panel it would investigate Enron's influence on wholesale electricity prices. 
The Associated Press contributed to this report.

White House Confirms Lay Memo But Hasn't Seen Lawsuit

WASHINGTON (AP)--The White House said Wednesday it hadn't received notification of the lawsuit to be filed by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress. 
A congressional source said Wednesday that GAO has decided to sue the White House for access to documents from President George W. Bush's energy task force.
White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said, "The president will stand on principle and for the right of presidents and this president to receive candid advice without it being turned into a news release." 
GAO officials were calling congressional leaders Wednesday to tell them of the decision. An official announcement was expected later in the day. 
The White House also said Kenneth Lay, then chairman of Enron Corp. (ENRNQ), gave Vice President Dick Cheney a three-page document in April arguing for federal authorities to refrain from imposing price caps or other measures sought by California officials to stabilize electricity prices. 
"Events in California and in other parts of the country demonstrated that the benefits of competition have yet to be realized and have not reached consumers," the memo said. 
Cheney spokeswoman Mary Matalin dismissed the significance of the memo first reported by the San Francisco Chronicle. Nine of Lay's 11 suggestions weren't included in the White House energy plan - and the two that made the report were non-controversial, she said. 
A decision had been expected all week from Comptroller General David Walker, GAO's chief. The GAO wants to force Cheney, who ran the energy task force, to turn over documents on the meetings held last year with business executives as the Bush administration crafted a national energy policy. 
Some of the meetings included officials from the now-collapsed Enron, whose executives have had deep ties to Bush.

Enron collapse memo details Cheney-Enron links

Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

SACRAMENTO (AP) - A memo outlining discussions between Enron officials and the White House reveals the extent to which the Houston energy giant lobbied to influence government policy, despite White House insistence that the details remain secret. 
The memo was given by former Enron Chairman Ken Lay to Vice President Dick Cheney last April when the two met to discuss the administration's response to California's energy crisis, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Wednesday.
The White House said Tuesday that aspects of the memo resembled elements of Cheney's energy plan, but refused to say whether the document was included in notes that Cheney now refuses to divulge to congressional investigators. 
The memo contains eight points spelling out Enron's case for why federal authorities should refrain from imposing price caps or other measures sought by California officials to stabilize runaway electricity prices. 
The key point for California was whether soaring wholesale power prices should be limited or whether such prices were just a reflection of normal supply-and-demand dynamics. 
The memo blames California officials for having made only "limited progress" in tackling the state's power woes. 
Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, said it was no surprise that Enron had a voice in the formation of the Bush administration's stance on California's difficulties. 
"What the federal government did during the energy crisis was pretend that the problem didn't exist and say that the markets can solve everything, and that's the same thing Ken Lay told the governor," Maviglio told The Chronicle.

Judge Delays Ruling On Halting Enron Suits In Texas Crts
By Michael Rieke

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- A U.S. district court judge delayed ruling Wednesday on a motion to stop plaintiffs from filing lawsuits in Texas state courts against Arthur Andersen L.L.P.; some of its employees and former executives of Enron Corp. (ENRNQ).
Plaintiff and defense attorneys involved in federal class-action lawsuits in the Southern District of Texas related to the collapse of Enron argued against allowing such cases to proceed, saying they violated the spirit of federal law governing securities law and could interfere with their own suits. 
Lawsuits have been filed in state courts in both Washington and Brazos counties in Texas on behalf of individual investors who lost money as a result of the collapse of Enron. Those suits name as defendants Andersen, four current Andersen employees, one former Andersen employee, and three former Enron executives. 
The cases filed in state courts are intended to circumvent federal securities laws, said Bruce Collins, an attorney for former Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Ken Lay. Lay is a defendant in the suits filed in Washington and Brazos counties. 
Federal law calls for such cases involving 50 or more plaintiffs to be removed to federal courts where similar cases have been filed, Collins said. 
Although the suits filed in Washington and Brazos counties have fewer than 50 plaintiffs, they should be moved to federal courts, said Rusty Hardin, representing Andersen. Such suits are liable to be a recurring problem because, "There are 252 counties left" in Texas where such suits could be filed.

Enron collapse subjects British government, opposition to accusations
By ROBERT BARR

LONDON (AP) - Enron's collapse has cast a shadow over Downing Street, with Prime Minister Tony Blair under pressure to explain how Enron won favorable government decisions after giving financial support to the Labor Party. Questions also are being raised about Labor's relationship with Arthur Andersen, Enron's auditors. 
Opposition Conservatives are seeking to capitalize. But they also accepted Enron's support, and Enron's board included John Wakeham, a well-connected senior figure in past Conservative governments who now may face questioning about the company's collapse.
"What you have here is thousands of words, very little story," Blair's official spokesman told reporters Wednesday, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
The Labor Party has confirmed that Enron gave the equivalent of 36,000 pounds (dlrs 50,760) between 1997 and 2000 - at a time when Enron was pressing the government to lift a moratorium on new gas-fired power generating plants. 
The moratorium stopped Enron's plans for a 1,200-megawatt station in southeastern England. By the time the moratorium was lifted in November 2000, gas prices had doubled and Enron did not pursue the project. 
Opposition critics note that Enron spent 15,000 pounds (dlrs 21,000) to host a reception at the Labor party conference in 1998, shortly after the government approved Enron's takeover of Wessex water, which supplies domestic water and sewer service in southwestern England. 
Ralph Hodge, former chairman of Enron Europe, said he had advised the company to sponsor events in conjunction with political parties rather than make direct donations. 
"Meetings were held with ministers and officials on a number of occasions before and after Enron sponsored events at party conferences and conventions. I am certain that these meetings would have taken place irrespective of any sponsorships," Hodge said. 
Opposition Liberal Democrat Matthew Tayler has sharply questioned Enron's courting of the Blair government. 
"We know that in the United States Enron used extensive political contacts to seek to further its interests, and there is good evidence of the same happening here in the UK," Taylor said. 
"Taking on former Labor employees to lobby for a change in gas policy and bingo, gas policy changes; paying for tables at the Labor Party conference and seeking direct contact at the time of the takeover of Wessex Water and bingo, that is approved." 
But the Labor Party's general secretary, David Triesman, scoffed at such charges in a television interview this week. 
"The idea that a government switches its policy on energy a week after having a gala dinner is really among the more absurd claims I've heard in my political life," Triesman said. 
On Tuesday, Blair's office released details of seven meetings between ministers and Enron executives between April 1988, when Enron chief executive Kenneth Lay met then-Industry Minister John Battle, and October 2000. 
The Department of Trade and Industry said it did not keep records of who initiated each of the meetings. 
Enron's outlay for political contacts - including some 25,000 pounds (dlrs 35,000) to the Conservative Party - pale in comparison to political contributions of dlrs 5.77 million in the United States in the last 12 years. 
The opposition apparently doesn't yet sense a major opportunity to attack Blair over Enron. 
During the prime minister's question session in Parliament on Wednesday, Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith decided instead to probe Blair about problems in the National Health Service and the Labor Party's financial support from a union that is currently disrupting rail service with a series of 48-hour strikes. 
A decade ago, Enron successfully lobbied Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government for permission to build one of the first gas-fired electric generating plants in Britain. 
The minister who approved that project, John Wakeham, joined Enron's board as a non-executive director in 1994 - and now finds himself under fire. 
Nick Harvey, a Liberal Democrat lawmaker, has called for Wakeham to give up one of his most prominent jobs: chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, a politically sensitive post in which he has dealt with complaints from people aggrieved by newspapers, including Blair and the royal family. 
Wakeham has not responded. 
Conservatives also have questioned Labor's relationship with Arthur Andersen, which was banned from doing business with the government because of its association with the De Lorean sports car venture in Northern Ireland. The company went bankrupt in 1982 after its founder, John de Lorean, was arrested in California on drug charges. 
Successive Conservative governments barred contracts with Andersen and sought to reclaim 200 million pounds (dlrs 280 million at current rates) in compensation. 
Shortly after Blair won power in 1997, the government settled the case for 21 million pounds (dlrs 25.8 million). 
Energy Minister Brian Wilson said former Conservative Prime Minister John Major's government set up the machinery which led to the decision to reinstate Andersen. 
John Morris, now Lord Morris, Blair's attorney general from 1997 to 1999, said he made the decision to settle "entirely on legal advice." 
"The advice from departmental lawyers was that the sooner the better the litigation ... should be brought to an end," he told British Broadcasting Corp. radio. 
Conservative Party vice-chairman Tim Collins complained that the decision was entirely made by Blair's government. 
"It was the Labor Party that decided to settle for only 10 percent of the money the taxpayer was, in our view, owed."

Bank of America Fires Two Bankers Who Handled Enron
2002-01-30 14:40 (New York)

     New York, Jan. 30 (Bloomberg) -- Bank of America Corp. fired two employees who managed the firm's business with Enron Corp. after the third-biggest bank lost $231 million when the energy trader filed for bankruptcy, people familiar with the matter said.
     The bank dismissed Jo Tamalis, the client manager for Enron, and Marcia Bateman, who oversaw loans to the energy firm, the people said. Tamalis said she no longer worked for the bank and declined to say why. Bateman couldn't be reached. Bank of America spokeswoman Georgie Shields declined to comment.
     Bank of America is the first bank to fire executives because of Enron's collapse. Other financial firms from J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. to Citigroup Inc., which wrote off more than $2.7 billion in the fourth quarter because of Enron and Argentina's debt default, may take similar steps, investors say.
     "If you assume they were responsible, you as an investor like to see people held accountable,'' said Phil Larkins, market strategist for Legacy South Inc., which manages $400 million in assets and owns 200,000 Bank of America shares. ``Bank of America has a very large exposure to Enron.''
     The Bank of America firings are some of the ripple effects in the financial services industry from Enron's collapse. Congressional investigators are demanding names of investors in limited partnerships Enron used to inflate earnings and hide debt from shareholders. Merrill Lynch & Co. executives invested in one of the partnerships, which also drew money from Citigroup, American International Group Inc. and other firms.

Bondholders

     Money managers including Putnam Investments, the fourth largest U.S. mutual fund company, Federated Investors Inc. and Dreyfus Corp. bought bonds issued by Enron trusts, according to regulatory filings. Northern Trust Corp., the trustee for Enron's retirement plan, owned the bonds, and also said this month it held more than $24.5 million in unsecured Enron debt.
     Bank of America was one of the biggest lenders to Enron as part of a $3 billion credit facility that was arranged by J.P. Morgan and Citigroup.
     Bank of America shares gained 1.37 to $60.56.
     "Bankers have made a lot of bad judgment calls regarding Enron,'' said Carl Domino, president of Northern Trust Value Investors, which holds Bank of America shares.
     Tamalis, reached at her home in Houston, declined to comment. "I don't want to give an interview,'' she said.
     The largest bankruptcy helped push J.P. Morgan and FleetBoston Financial Corp. into their first quarterly losses in years. J.P. Morgan Chase wrote off $456 million of trading losses and loans to Enron and still has exposure to potential losses of $2.06 billion. Bank of America said this month loans and other business with Enron cost the company $231 million.
     For Bank of America, the losses on loans to Enron came after a string of bad loans hurt the firm's earnings. The bank wrote off a total of $1.19 billion of bad loans in the fourth quarter, up 11 percent from a year earlier.
     ``Enron may well have been the straw that broke the camel's back,'' Domino said.
     Congress will be looking into the role of Enron's financiers, especially those in the limited partnerships, in hiding debt from investors, said Representative Henry Waxman, a California
Democrat.
     ``This needs to be thoroughly investigated,'' he said. ``One of the big mysteries about Enron is who the secret partners were, what they knew about Enron's precarious financial situation, and whether they did anything wrong.''

Other Cuts

     Bank of America said last year it planned to cut 600 jobs in corporate and investment banking to help reduce costs. As part of those cuts, the bank is firing three loan syndication executives who worked in project finance: Parker Knight, managing director and head of international syndicated finance, Brian Goldstein, head of U.S. project finance syndications, and John O'Neill, head of Asian project finance.
     Their jobs are being cut as part of Bank of America's restructuring of its global corporate and investment bank, said William Hodges, the bank's head of debt capital markets.
    ``The impact on these three individuals leaving the company is not related to Enron in any way,'' Hodges said.
    The bank is scaling back lending for capital projects, such as refineries and generation plants, in the U.S. and Asian energy and power industries, Hodges said. That type of lending ties up capital, and Bank of America isn't willing to continue doing it unless borrowers agree to give the bank more lucrative business as well.
    "It entails risk factors that are less than highly desirable,'' Hodges said.
     Loan syndication employees in Latin America and Asia who previously reported to Knight now report to executives in those regions. ``In Latin America and Asia, we now have a regional model,'' Hodges said. "The head of the region is now responsible for all of our client coverage and business development.''
     Hodges said Bank of America is ceasing, on a stand-alone basis, traditional project finance in the U.S., a unit headed by Goldstein, and in Asia, a unit headed by O'Neill.

Lawmakers Fear 'Loopholes' In Electricity Deregulation Bill

01/30/2002

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Mutual fund investors could be stung by future Enron-type collapses if Congress adopts an electricity bill with "potentially dangerous loopholes," some House Democrats warned Wednesday. 
In a Jan. 30, letter to Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt, Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., and Edward Markey, D-Mass., said they fear fund investors could be stung by loopholes in the bill, HR 3406.
The bill, sponsored by Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, would deregulate markets for electric power. 
A section of the bill would "grandfather" existing holding companies, allowing them to avoid rules governing mutual funds. Dingell and Markey said they are "extremely wary" of that, fearing it might allow grandfathered utility holding companies to spinoff firms that wouldn't be subject to the same rules as other mutual funds. 
"They could therefore engage in some of the risky and speculative investment strategies pursued by hedge funds," exposing investors to enormous risks, the lawmakers wrote. 
A House subcommittee may act on the bill as early as next month. Given that, Democratic lawmakers asked the SEC to analyze the bill, including the proposal to grandfather holding companies in existence at the end of 2001. 
In a related area, lawmakers asked the SEC to provide information on a 1997 SEC staff decision to exempt Enron from being regulated as a mutual fund. 
Among other things, the Democrats asked whether "some of the potentially fraudulent actions subsequently undertaken by Enron might have been prevented" if it had been subject to mutual fund rules.

Shareholder Files State Lawsuit Against Enron Execs
By Erwin Seba

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- An Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) shareholder filed a class action lawsuit Friday in state court in Houston against Enron's current and former executives and directors.
Henry P. Blaskie, Jr., of Columbus, Ohio, is also suing Enron's former auditor Arthur Andersen LLP. 
Among the defendants, the suit names "the estate of J. Clifford Baxter." 
Baxter, a former Enron vice chairman, was found dead in his car early Friday morning by Sugar Land, Texas, police. Police said Baxter suffered a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head and have described his death as an apparent suicide. 
The suit was filed late Friday afternoon in Harris County District Court. 
Former Chairman Kenneth Lay, former Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling and former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow were also named in the suit. 
Blaskie alleges the executives and directors "breached their fiduciary duty" by releasing misleading financial statements which encouraged shareholders to continue ownership of Enron stock. 
Blaskie also alleges Andersen aided in the breach of fiduciary duty by certifying the company's financial statements. 
Blaskie is represented by Houston Attorney John Emerson. Blaskie is suing on behalf of himself and all those people who bought Enron stock before Oct. 16, 1998, and held the stock through Oct. 16, 2001. 
Blaskie owned 700 shares of Enron common stock. 
Attorneys for the defendants were unavailable for comment Wednesday afternoon.

USA: Ex-Enron executive Baxter euologized for successes.
By Nicole Volpe

(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

AMITYVILLE, New York, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Family and friends of J. Clifford Baxter, the 43-year-old former Enron vice chairman who died of an apparent suicide last week, gathered on Wednesday to recall a life they said should not be eclipsed by the way it ended or by scandal at the company he led for seven months. 
"The shame is that the whole world is going to know him as the vice chairman of this big company where things went crazy," said John Bochicchio, a friend who graduated with Baxter from Amityville High School. "We knew him here in Amitvyille growing up as a great guy, playing ball and climbing trees. It's a very sad day."
The Houston-based energy trading company's murky accounting practices led to its December spiral into the largest U.S. bankruptcy in history. 
Baxter, who complained about questionable financial deals at Enron before resigning in May, seven months after being promoted to vice chairman, was found dead of a gunshot to the head near his suburban Houston home last Friday. 
Baxter's death came a day after the start of congressional hearings in Washington on Enron's collapse. 
He resigned for what the company said was a desire to spend more time with his family in the Houston suburb of Sugar Land. But an August memo from an Enron whistleblower indicated Baxter had feuded with the then-chief executive about methods the company was using to hide billions of dollars in debt. 
About 150 of Baxter's family and friends filled the St. Martin of Tours Church in this small Long Island town. One of his 35 cousins, Steven Garry, gave the eulogy. 
"It is for them and for us an unimaginable day," he said. 
"We will always remember what a decent, hard-working, upstanding person he was, not a bad bone in his body," said Garry. "He always knew the right thing to say, he was always there, he was the go-to guy." 
Large groups of reporters gathered in front of the church, filming the family as church bells tolled at the end of the service. Baxter is survived by a wife and two children. 
Baxter was a defendant in lawsuits targeting Enron's top executives, accusing them of cashing in on insider information.

Democrats Try to Make Hay of Enron Fall --- Lieberman to Hold Hearings As Party Aims to Play Up Company's Ties to GOP

WASHINGTON -- In a moment of bipartisan candor, a Republican strategist recently confided to a Democratic friend that if he were in Democrats' place, he would "beat up" the GOP over its ties to the fallen energy giant, Enron Corp. 
It looks like the Democrats are going to try to do just that.
The new year at the Capitol -- a congressional-election year -- opened yesterday with an announcement from Sen. Joseph Lieberman that the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, which he heads, will hold hearings into Enron's collapse when Congress returns to work later this month. That word from the former Democratic vice-presidential nominee -- who is a presidential prospect for 2004 -- is just the latest of a number of inquiries into a company with closer ties than any to President Bush. 
The Connecticut senator noted that the company and its chairman, Bush friend Kenneth Lay, were active in helping draft the Bush administration's energy plan. Mr. Lieberman added, "We have got to ask whether the advice rendered was at all self-serving." 
Mr. Lieberman emphasized that Enron's connections to the Bush administration aren't the focus of his committee's inquiry; instead, he says it will center on the precipitous collapse and what might have been done -- including by the government -- to prevent it. But Democratic operatives have been urging Mr. Lieberman, as the best-placed committee chairman, to dig into the issue, believing further exposure can only embarrass Republicans and Mr. Bush, whose own ties to Enron and Mr. Lay date back to the president's race for Texas governor. 
Enron, the nation's biggest marketer of electricity and natural gas, filed for bankruptcy-court protection following a crisis of confidence among its investors. Enron wrote off $1 billion of assets in November, revised downward its earnings of the past several years and took a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity. The problems have resulted largely from Enron's dealings with private partnerships, run by some of its own executives. The company saw its market value plunge recently to about $500 million from more than $77 billion last year. 
Financial regulators had little clue what was going on inside Enron, which had major positions in little-regulated derivatives markets. That is at least partly because the Houston company had invested a lot of time and money in Washington to keep the government out of its business, and to foster GOP support for deregulation of energy and financial industries. 
Now, a half-dozen congressional panels and several federal agencies are investigating aspects of Enron's Chapter 11 reorganization. In Congress, Democrats in particular are emphasizing the numerous investors left holding stock worth pennies, the thousands of Enron employees out of work and those with retirement savings built on worthless company stock. 
It remains to be seen if the issue will resonate with voters. For one thing, Enron's energy-trading business is extremely complex; for another, some Democrats also benefited from Enron's largesse -- though hardly as much as Republicans have. Since 1990, the company has given three-quarters of its campaign donations to GOP causes. Al Gore's presidential campaign against Mr. Bush received $13,700 from Enron executives during the 2000 campaign cycle; Mr. Bush's campaign got $114,000 and his party far more. 
The Democrats' rhetorical line of attack is already clear. "The only wholly owned subsidiary of Enron not to go bankrupt is the Republican Party," said Robert Gibbs, a spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. "Enron is a huge problem for the Republicans, and it will keep tying them in knots." 
Two House Financial Services subcommittees held the first of numerous planned hearings last month, but those were notable for a bipartisan tone. Rep. John LaFalce of New York, the committee's senior Democrat, joined chairman Mike Oxley, an Ohio Republican, in calling for a swift and thorough investigation. "We are trying to focus on the criminal, not the political," Mr. Oxley said. 
But Sen. Lieberman has shifted the tone. While he too emphasized a desire to remain bipartisan, he announced the hearings without his committee's chief Republican, Sen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee. He did consult with Mr. Thompson beforehand. 
The Democrat driving the issue to date has been Rep. Henry Waxman of California, but he is hampered by the fact that Democrats are the minority in the House. Last month, Mr. Waxman demanded that Vice President Dick Cheney disclose Enron's and Mr. Lay's role in crafting the administration's energy plan. Mr. Waxman and other Democrats on the House Government Reform Committee also started an "Enron tip-line" to solicit information about any alleged wrongdoing. 
Meanwhile, Republicans have gone on the offensive. Last Friday, in answer to a reporter's question, Mr. Bush said Enron must be held accountable. "There will be a lot of government inquiry into Enron and what took place there," he said. "I'm deeply concerned about the citizens of Houston who worked for Enron who lost life savings." 
But Rep. John Dingell, the ranking Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, has been raising questions about the failure of regulators to sniff out Enron's problems. 
In early December, he wrote Mr. Bush's appointee to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Harvey Pitt, demanding a thorough SEC investigation of Enron and attaching a long list of questions about its possible accounting violations. 
Separately, GOP Reps. Billy Tauzin, who heads the House energy committee, and James Greenwood, chairman of its Oversight and Investigations subcommittee, are preparing for February hearings into the role of regulators and the accounting industry in Enron's failure. 
Outside Washington, Enron already is shaping up as a political liability in its Texas home and elsewhere. For years, Enron has been among the best-known underwriters of political campaigns in Texas. But in the state's race for attorney general, both Democrat and Republican candidates have said they plan to return some or all donations from the company. 
And the decision of Mr. Bush's successor, Gov. Rick Perry, to appoint a former top Enron executive as chairman of the Texas Public Utility Commission has produced a storm of protest. Two Texas citizen groups have called for an inquiry into the appointment, and the Dallas Morning News has urged the current GOP attorney general, John Cornyn, to rule on the eligibility of the Enron executive to serve in light of conflict-of-interest rules. 
Mr. Cornyn, like the Republican governor, has received more than $100,000 in contributions from Enron through the years. Moreover, he's now seeking the Senate seat held by Republican Sen. Phil Gramm, who is retiring. Yet the vulnerability of some Democrats is apparent here, too: A top Democratic candidate for the Senate seat is Rep. Ken Bentsen, who received more Enron contributions -- $42,750 -- than any House member. 
In California, meanwhile, Democratic Gov. Gray Davis has suggested that Enron may have contributed to the energy crisis that struck his state last year. "I take no joy in Enron's troubles," he said last month. But, he added in a swipe aimed at the company, "Some of the companies providing power were driving a very hard bargain, I believe taking advantage of California." Earlier this year, the state's Democratic attorney general, William Lockyer, subpoenaed Enron's electricity-trading records in an attempt to show that the state was a victim of price gouging. 
Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have called on the Justice and Labor departments to probe whether Enron violated laws governing the retirement plans for thousands of its employees. On average, employees had more than 60% of their retirement savings in Enron shares, and because they had little flexibility to diversify or sell, many lost as much as 90% of their retirement assets when the share price plunged.

Senate panel to investigate Enron

The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee on Jan. 2 became the fourth congressional group to launch an Enron-related investigation. More could be coming. 
Yet another congressional committee will issue subpoenas next week for corporate documents crucial to its inquiry into regulatory oversight of Enron Corp., two senators said Jan. 2.
The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee became the fourth congressional panel to launch an Enron-related probe, joining the Justice and Labor departments and the Securities and Exchange Commission. And more could be coming. Democrats on the Senate Commerce Committee have asked the Federal Trade Commission to launch its own investigation. 
At a Capitol Hill news conference Wednesday, Sen. Joe Lieberman, the chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs panel, said the committee will hold its first Enron-related hearing Jan. 24 to vet whether any "cracks" in the systems at various regulatory agencies, including the SEC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, contributed to the company's collapse. 
"This is a search for the truth, not a witch hunt," said Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat. 
Meanwhile, Carl Levin, chairman of the committee's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, said he will subpoena documents next week from Enron's current and former directors, top company officials and its auditor, Arthur Andersen. 
The subcommittee will examine how the energy giant was governed and audited and how it used special-purpose entities, offshore entities and limited partnerships to conduct its business. 
The subcommittee will spend the next few months gathering and analyzing the documentary trail, and hearings from those subpoenas will be held later in the year, Levin said at the news conference. 
The subcommittee "will use its subpoena authority to investigate what appears to be a massive shell game with multiple layers of conflicts of interests," Levin said. 
"Thorough investigations are needed, and from different perspectives, to determine whether current law was violated and where current law is inadequate to protect the public interest," he said. 
Lieberman said the Enron investigation will be a committee priority when it returns from recess later this month. That appears to be true for much of Congress as well as federal regulatory agencies. 
Since Enron's bankruptcy filing Dec. 2, the Senate Commerce Committee, the House Financial Services Committee, the House Energy and Commerce Committee and now the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee have launched investigations. 
The SEC and Labor investigations could result in civil charges while the Justice Department's inquiries could result in criminal charges. "We'll do our best to coordinate with our colleagues," Lieberman said. 
Levin said overlapping investigations do not worry him. "There is more than enough work for the House and the Senate," Levin said after the news conference. "The problem is there is so much to look at that there may be some pieces not investigated. That's my fear." 
While Lieberman said the committee has not decided whether to ask Enron chairman Kenneth Lay or other company executives to testify, he did note that he "wouldn't consider an investigation complete without hearing from them." 
Levin said the subcommittee intends to take depositions where appropriate. 
Lay has previously declined to appear at congressional hearings but has committed to testifying before the Senate Commerce Committee in February. 
Meanwhile, late Wednesday, Andersen released a statement saying a review of its accounting and auditing quality "has been deemed to provide reasonable assurance of compliance with professional standards" and has been accepted by the Peer Review Committee of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. 
Deloitte & Touche conducted the review, which evaluated whether Andersen's system of quality control for its accounting and auditing practice meets standards set by the AICPA. Firms are reviewed every three years, but Andersen's review was expanded after financial reporting issues emerged at Enron, the firms said. 
In a comment letter, Deloitte & Touche recommended several changes Andersen should undertake but said those items "were not considered to be of sufficient significance to affect the opinion expressed in [the] report." But the report doesn't absolve Andersen. DT said the restatement of financial statements audited by a firm "generally involve numerous factors, many of which are unrelated to the effectiveness of a firm's quality control system."

Enron case shows 'very clear suggestions of deception' - US Senator Lieberman

01/02/2002
AFX News
(c) 2002 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

WASHINGTON (AFX) - Senator Joseph Lieberman said there are "very, very clear suggestions of deception" at Enron Corp and Congress is determined to discover what caused the downfall of the Houston-based energy trading group. 
Several US senators have called for the Department of Justice to investigate the share dealings of Enron Corp's senior executives and to also probe why an employee pension fund was locked down at a time when executives continued to sell their Enron stock holdings as the company's fortunes dwindled.
"This is the largest company ever to declare bankruptcy. Thousands of employees of Enron have lost their jobs, many thousands more have had their retirement savings evaporated. Unless we take a look at what happened here, we're not going to be able to protect everybody else who has a 401(K) (pension scheme) that is run by their company," Lieberman said in a interview with CNN. 
There are "very, very clear suggestions of deception," the Democratic senator said without expanding further on the allegation. 
Enron retirees have told lawmakers that the company's executive board locked them out of accessing their 401(K) pension funds when Enron's fortunes started to spiral downwards into bankruptcy. 
Enron's management decided to change the company's pension plan administrators on Oct 17 -- one day after the company's third-quarter financial results led to a 1.2 bln usd restated reduction of shareholders' equity -- thereby locking in employees from selling Enron stock in their retirement funds for some two weeks. 
Retirees and some lawmakers, allege that Enron chairman and chief executive officer Kenneth Lay and other executives shed millions of dollars in stock while they were locked out from accessing their retirement benefits over this period. 
"That's one of the things that we're going to determine in this investigation... we'll be looking at the activities of the board of directors to see what role they played in the collapse," said Democratic Senator Carl Levin, who was also interviewed by CNN. 
"We're hoping that this investigation will contribute to equity finally being given to the stockholders and the employees of Enron," Levin added. 
Lieberman chairs the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee which plans to hold a series of hearings into Enron's collapse during late January and early February.

Senate committee to investigate Enron collapse
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON (AP) - Enron's business practices had the mark of "a massive shell game with multiple layers of conflict of interest," says a senator who plans to subpoena documents as part of a broad investigation into the energy company's collapse. 
Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., chairman of the Governmental Affairs investigations subcommittee, said his committee will within weeks subpoena documents from Enron's board of directors, senior managers and its auditing firm.
At the same time, the full Governmental Affairs Committee will hold a hearing Jan. 24 into why government regulators failed to see the "red flags" at Enron and protect investors and the company's employees who have lost hundreds of millions of dollars as Enron stock plummeted. 
Enron Corp., filed for bankruptcy Dec. 2 as its stock fell from a high of $90 a share a year ago to less than $1. Thousands of Enron workers were prevented from selling Enron stock in their 401k retirement plan during the collapse. 
Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., the full committee's chairman, promised Wednesday "a search for the truth, not a witch hunt." But he did not rule out an examination of Enron's relationships with the Bush administration. 
"We're going to go wherever the search takes us," Lieberman said at a news conference, noting Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay's involvement in crafting the administration's energy agenda last spring. "We've got to ask whether the advice rendered (by Lay) was at all self serving." 
Lay, a longtime friend of the president, was a prominent contributor and fund raiser for Bush's presidential campaign. Other Enron executives also gave significantly to Bush's campaign, according to the watchdog Center for Public Integrity. 
The Senate committee's initial focus will be on why the Securities and Exchange Commission, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and other regulators did not foresee the problems and raise concern about Enron's business practices. 
"The untimely and wholly unexpected failure of a corporate giant like Enron is an alarm call to all of us in government," said Lieberman. He said it has sent shockwaves into the investment community and concern about energy industry deregulation. 
Levin's subcommittee planned to target Enron's board of directors and auditors to determine what they knew of Enron's sometimes secretive business dealings, including the use of questionable partnerships and what Levin called "offshore entities." 
Internal Enron documents reportedly show that top company officials were directly involved in the creation and oversight of the partnerships, and that they viewed them as crucial to company growth - even as they disguised an estimated $500 million in Enron debt not included on the company's books. 
The procedures set up by Enron required former chief executive and president Jeff Skilling and two other senior Enron officials to approve all transactions with the partnerships, the Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday, citing the documents. 
Levin said he was dismayed about "what appears to be a massive shell game with multiple layers of conflict of interest" that contributed to Enron's collapse at a time when most investors believed the company to be thriving. 
Top Enron executives and directors "apparently reaped almost $1 billion in stock sales in 2000 and 2001," said Levin, while hundreds of Enron workers were barred from selling Enron stock in their 401k retirement fund during the company's collapse. 
Maine Sen. Susan Collins, the subcommittee's ranking Republican, said in a statement that she wants to know whether Enron executives and board members, when selling their stock, "knew of the company's impending financial situation." 
Enron - once the seventh largest in the country in terms of revenue - filed for bankruptcy protection on Dec. 2. 
Last month, during a House hearing, Arthur Andersen LLP defended its work for Enron, but its chief executive conceded shortcomings in the accounting profession. "Our system of regulation and discipline will have to be improved," said Anderson chief Joseph Berardino. 
On Wednesday, Andersen released the results of an independent review that found the company's work provides "reasonable assurance of compliance with professional standards." The review was conducted by another accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche. 
The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee is among a half dozen committees and subcommittees expected to hold hearings in both the House and Senate in the coming months on Enron's collapse, one of the largest ever. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Labor Department also have investigations under way.

Enron probe could reach Bush: Backed campaign: Senate committee to focus on directors' role, partnerships

WASHINGTON - Fallen energy giant Enron Corp. faces further scrutiny on Capitol Hill with another committee announcing yesterday it would probe the company's collapse, possibly looking at connections between Enron and the White House. 
The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee's permanent subcommittee on investigations will subpoena documents next week and hold a hearing on Jan. 24.
A Wall Street darling just a few months ago, Enron on Dec. 2 made the largest bankruptcy court filing in U.S. history after a rescue takeover by rival Dynegy Inc. fell apart amid investor concerns about Enron's murky finances. 
Sen. Joseph Lieberman, who chairs the full government affairs committee, did not rule out looking into connections between Enron and the administration of George W. Bush. 
Enron was a major backer of President Bush's election campaign. "There are some interconnections here with the Bush administration, but that is not the focus of this investigation," said Mr. Lieberman, a Democrat. 
Sen. Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who chairs the subcommittee, said the investigation would focus on the role of Enron's directors in the collapse; accounting firm Andersen, which audited Enron's financial statements; and the company's use of complex financial partnerships. 
Houston-based Enron is under investigation in Washington by at least five congressional committees, the market-regulating Securities and Exchange Commission and the departments of Justice and Labor. 
Reports recently emerged that a week before filing for bankruptcy protection, Enron contributed US$100,000 to Democrats after giving nearly all its prior donations this year to Republicans. 
The money went to the organization that aids Senate Democratic candidates, but a recently hired attorney for Enron insisted the donations were unrelated to congressional investigations. 
Robert Bennett, a lawyer who represented former president Bill Clinton and other high-profile clients, said the money was pledged months before Enron's collapse prompted the congressional inquiries. Rather, he said, the shift reflected the Democrats taking control of the Senate this year. 
"Donations of this type reflect certain political realities which are followed by all major corporations," Mr. Bennett said yesterday about Enron's US$50,000 cheques on Nov. 25 and Nov. 26 to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. 
Once ranked No. 7 on the Fortune 500 list of top companies, Enron's stock closed at US63 cents, up US3 cents on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday -- off from an August, 2000, high of US$90.56. 
Thousands of Enron employees have lost their jobs and much of their retirement savings. A 401(k) retirement plan that made many of them heavily dependent on company stock came under fire at a congressional hearing last month when employees said they were unable to sell their holdings when the stock price plunged. 
In other developments yesterday, Enron bankruptcy judge Arthur Gonzalez put off ruling on whether to compel Jeffrey McMahon, Enron chief financial officer, to testify about why the company filed for Chapter 11 protection in New York rather than Houston. 
Dynegy and other unsecured creditors want Mr. McMahon to give deposition testimony on Enron's choice of venue for the bankruptcy filing. They've asked Judge Gonzalez to transfer the largest bankruptcy case ever to Houston, where Enron is based. 
Enron opposes the request to order Mr. McMahon's testimony, calling it "unnecessary, unduly burdensome, and disruptive." 
"Courts have repeatedly recognized that demands for depositions of high-ranking corporate officers are often misused as a tool of harassment and should not be allowed unless there is no other source for the same information," Enron said in a motion filed Monday seeking to quash the request.

Enron Probe to Include Regulators

WASHINGTON -- When the Senate convenes this month, a top priority for its Governmental Affairs Committee will be to investigate whether holes in the regulatory safety net played a role in the quick and costly collapse of the energy trading titan Enron Corp., committee Chairman Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., said Wednesday. 
Government regulators, outside auditors, and equity analysts will share the hot seat with Enron officials when Sens. Lieberman and Carl Levin, D-Mich., who chairs the panel's permanent subcommittee on investigations, begin their probe Jan. 24.
Sen. Lieberman said the policies of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and the Labor Department will come under scrutiny. 
"Both of us will be looking to identify the loopholes or failures in our current laws and regulatory schemes that allowed this disaster to happen," Sen. Levin said. "The full committee will be looking at what the experts are saying about the collapse and what role various federal agencies had in overseeing Enron." 
The subcommittee will examine Enron from the inside to learn what its directors and officials knew and how they behaved, he said. Subpoenas for documents from Enron's top officials are expected soon. 
Andersen, Enron's auditor, will also be scrutinized, as will the analysts who covered the company, Sen. Levin said. "Something was rotten in the state of Enron, and a lot of knowledgeable people on Wall Street were either duped, didn't care, or purposefully went along for the ride." 
Sen. Lieberman said that the "built-in protections" of independent analysts and auditors failed, and that he will call on "experts on investing and regulation of the financial markets, energy and derivative trading, and pensions and retirement savings" to find the system's flaws.

Andersen To Improve Audit Practices After Peer Review

01/03/2002
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)- Andersen said a peer review found that its accounting and auditing quality provides reasonable assurance of compliance with professional standards, but in response to certain comments, it has taken, or will take, the recommended steps to improve its accounting and auditing practices. 
Deloitte & Touche conducted the peer review, the scope of which was expanded after financial reporting issues emerged at Enron Corp. (ENE).
In a press release Wednesday, Andersen said Deloitte & Touche's opinion was "unmodified," without qualification, yet three issues, which weren't deemed significant enough to affect the opinion, were raised in an attached comment letter. 
The comments related to documentation of certain auditing procedures on some engagements; communications with audit committees in some instances; and management representation letters that needed more tailoring in some cases, Andersen said. 
Earlier Wednesday, Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations said the subcommittee will issue subpoenas to Andersen, Enron's outside auditor, next week as part of an investigation into the financial collapse of Enron. 
In testimony prepared for delivery to subcommittees of the House Financial Services Committee last month, Andersen Chief Executive Joseph Berardino defended the firm's audit of Enron but said accountants will have to make changes to restore confidence after Enron's fall. 
Berardino rejected suggestions that fees paid by Enron for auditing and consulting may have affected Andersen's work for the Houston energy company. 
The expanded Deloitte & Touche peer review of Andersen covered the controls and procedures at Andersen's Houston office, which was responsible for Enron's audits. 
In total, the peer and Andersen's internal practice review looked at 240 Andersen audit engagements in more than 30 Andersen offices and the Andersen national office. The engagements reviewed by Deloitte & Touche and Andersen involved about 45% of Andersen's U.S. audit partners. 
Andersen said the engagements selected for review represented a cross-section of Andersen's accounting and auditing practice, with emphasis on higher-risk engagements. It included examining working paper files and reports, and interviewing engagement personnel.

Enron auditor says it's clean ; Andersen cites review by rival
Delroy Alexander, Tribune staff reporter

(Copyright 2002 by the Chicago Tribune)

Accounting firm Andersen said Wednesday that its auditing practice responsible for checking the books of bankrupt energy trader Enron Corp. has been given a clean bill of health in a peer review by another accounting firm, but some observers criticized the findings. 
The review, performed by rival Big Five firm Deloitte & Touche, was part of an assessment carried out once every three years to check the quality of financial reporting of top firms.
Andersen's accounting systems were "deemed to provide reasonable assurance of compliance with professional standards," according to a statement from the Chicago-based firm. "Deloitte's opinion was unmodified, without qualification," for the year ended Aug. 31, Andersen added. 
But the integrity of the process was criticized almost immediately by analysts, including professor Lynn Turner, a former Securities and Exchange Commission chief accountant and current director of the Center for Quality Financial Reporting at Colorado State University. 
"If the process was really credible, I don't think we'd be having the rash of problems we are having today," Turner said. 
Turner cited reporting problems that have cost investors billions of dollars at Enron, such other Andersen clients as Waste Management Inc. and Sunbeam Corp., and similar high-profile failures at Cendant Corp., Rite Aid Corp. and MicroStrategy Inc. after audits by other accounting firms. 
Critics of the peer review process point to the fact that since the cooperative assessments began in 1978, no Big Five accounting firm has received a qualified opinion of its accounting procedures from a rival. 
When Enron filed for bankruptcy protection in December, it was Andersen's Houston office's largest client. The energy trader's collapse is the subject of a SEC investigation, lawsuits and a number of congressional probes. 
According to Deloitte's letter of comment, which accompanied the unqualified opinion, Andersen was told about a need to improve minor documentation and communication problems. 
Andersen's peer review was all but complete when it asked in November for the review to be expanded to include the Houston office responsible for auditing Enron, which had disclosed financial reporting problems that led to $1.2 billion being chopped from shareholders' equity. 
The assessment did not look specifically at the audit Andersen performed on Enron, because there is "pending litigation" over reporting problems, according to Deloitte's letter.

Mirant exits deal with Enron, Edison
by Danny Fortson in San Francisco

01/03/2002
The Daily Deal
Copyright (c) 2002 The Deal LLC

With the energy industry reeling since Enron filed for bankruptcy last month, Mirant is one of several companies whose credit ratings have been slashed because of concerns of overly aggressive growth plans and highly leveraged positions. 
Mirant Corp. has ended a proposed $1.3 billion purchase of a power plant from Enron Corp. and Edison International.
The move is just one piece of a sweeping budget overhaul the company announced Dec. 20, a day after Moody's Investors Service downgraded the company's credit rating to "junk" status. 
"We expected that Mirant would not close on this deal," said Ellen Lapson, an analyst with credit rating agency Fitch Ibca, Duff and Phelps that last month put the company on ratings watch. "The question is whether their termination will stick." 
Mirant agreed July 31 to buy EcoElectrica Holdings Ltd., a liquefied natural gas-fired power plant in Peneuelas, Puerto Rico, for $586 million in cash and $700 million in debt. Enron Asset Holdings, an Enron subsidiary that is not part of the energy company's bankruptcy, owns 47.5% of the plant, and Edison Mission Energy, a unit of Edison International, owns 50%. 
Rosemead, Calif.-based Edison, which has flirted with bankruptcy, said in a statement Dec. 31 that it "does not agree that Mirant has the right to terminate the agreement and is reviewing its alternatives." An Edison spokesman decline comment on whether the company planned to mount a legal challenge. 
"We don't agree that Mirant has the right to terminate the agreement, and accordingly we're evaluating our options," Enron spokesman John Ambler said. 
Mirant initially disclosed its intent to terminate the deal in a Dec. 20 press release detailing its effort to beef up its balance sheet. In the statement, the Atlanta power producer said it foresaw "no closing of Eco Electrica in 2001 due to non-satisfaction of closing conditions." 
"Under the purchase agreement, if the transaction does not close on or before Dec. 31, 2001, then the purchase agreement is cancelable by any party," Mirant announced in a Dec. 26 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
"If, as we expect, the transaction does not close before year-end, we will reevaluate the desirability of the transaction based on the then-current circumstances." 
With the energy industry reeling since Enron filed for bankruptcy last month, Mirant is one of a number of power companies whose credit ratings have been slashed because of concerns over overly aggressive growth plans and highly leveraged positions. Dynegy Inc. of Houston and Calpine Corp. of San Jose, Calif., for example, also have suffered credit downgrades. 
Lapson applauded Mirant's move to bail out of the deal, saying it will help "bring their resources into balance with the current market situation." 
Other cost-cutting moves under way at the company include a 40%, or $1.5 billion, reduction in the company's capital budget, a common equity offering that raised $759 million, and asset sales. 
Though Fitch has said it is not worried about the company's near-term liquidity, it is scrutinizing Mirant's credit rating. 
Significant to the company's recovery is Mirant's pending $1.63 billion sale of its 44% ownership stake in Berlin utility Bewag AG to Swedish state-owned electricity company Vattenfall AB, which announced in early December. 
But additional assets sale may prove difficult. That's because Enron's bankruptcy has forced the former energy giant to put its power assets up for sale, undercutting efforts by Mirant and other companies trying to unload plants and pipelines. 
Meanwhile, the stock price and market capitalization of many would-be buyers have sunk in Enron's wake, diminishing the pool of bidders. 
That means companies such as Mirant face not only lower prices for their properties, but also a scarcity of financing for prospective acquirers. Sinking power prices have further undermined the value of certain Mirant's assets, Lapson said. 
Separately, Mirant on Wednesday sold its Empresa Electrica del Norte Grande SA plant in Chile, which had about $340 million in debt, to F.S. Inversiones Ltda. for $4.5 million.

Back in the late 1960s, during my undergraduate years at the University of Notre Dame, I was in awe of a fellow in the class ahead of mine. He seemed to have read every book there was and he always got top grades. But most impressive was the way he talked: Ask him a five-second question and he could discourse for an hour. 
I must confess I often didn't understand what he was communicating, but it sure was impressive the way he did it.
We finally ended up in a class together. It was an English seminar, taught by Father Charlie Sheedy, who was dean of the College of Arts and Letters at the time and whose name now graces that college's highest teaching award. 
One day well into the semester I stayed after class to talk with Father Sheedy. As I stood in front of him, he looked distractedly toward me over the top of his glasses, shook his head and muttered, more to himself than to me, "That guy [he named the fellow who awed me], he gets started talking and I don't understand what he's talking about." 
I thought of that the other day as I was reading an article in Fortune magazine about the collapse of Enron, the Houston-based energy-trading company. Or is it a pipeline operator? Or maybe something else altogether? 
That was 90 percent of the problem at Enron: As the company flew higher and higher, nobody on the outside and very few on the inside could figure out exactly what was keeping it aloft, how it was making the money it allegedly was making. 
The other half, as Yogi Berra would say, is that nobody asked tough questions. There weren't enough Charlie Sheedys around to ask, in his disarmingly gentle but persistent-as-a-yelping-terrier fashion, "What the heck do you mean by that?" 
The guys at the top of Enron promised to spin straw into gold, to outfit their shareholders like emperors in exquisite new garments. For a time they seemed to do just that. And nobody, apparently, asked how. 
The Fortune article suggests that was at least in part "because Enron delivered what the Street [Wall Street] most cared about: smoothly growing earnings." 
I suspect there was another reason at least as important: People just didn't want to admit they didn't understand what these financial alchemists were up to. They didn't want to mark themselves as ignorant, unhip, not with it. 
Truth is, however, that for all our affluence and despite the growth over the last quarter century in 401(k)'s and Individual Retirement Accounts and investments in the stock market, Americans remain astonishingly ignorant of how business and investing work. 
Not without reason has the brokerage firm Merrill Lynch recently undertaken an advertising campaign with comedian-actor-writer Steve Martin describing his personal bewilderment about investments and how the firm has helped him. (Full disclosure: I am a Merrill Lynch client also.) 
Given the size of the American economy, it's a wonder that Enron- type fiascoes don't happen more often than they do. But when they do- -Long-Term Capital Management, Sunbeam, Cendant--they always seem to happen the same way: Some fellow comes along with a whole new way of making money, foolproof and scientific, and all that's needed for the method to work is to suspend disbelief. 
We used to think such confidence schemes were for the little folk- -the unlucky old lady who met a kindly stranger on the street and was persuaded against all reason to turn over all of her life's savings to him. 
- - - 
But all of economics and business ultimately are about confidence. It can be well- or poorly placed. In the case of Enron, it looks to have been utterly misplaced. 
Is it just me or is everybody's e-mail inbox being flooded these days with ads for pornography? And is it just me or has everybody noticed that they've grown increasingly smutty and perverted and violent? 
Teenagers seem to be the current hot-selling item. Teens of every kind in every kind of attitude and with every kind of creature. 
I'm no prude and I am, as a matter of principle, in favor of as wide-open and unfettered an Internet as possible. But two to three dozen separate slices of this pornographic spam daily is about to turn me into an advocate of some sort of regulation.

Hoping It's No California, Texas Deregulates Energy
By JIM YARDLEY

01/03/2002
The New York Times
Page 18, Column 5
c. 2002 New York Times Company

HOUSTON, Jan. 2 -- Less than a year after the nation's most-populous state, California, endured blackouts and political and economic turmoil when it deregulated the power industry, the second-most-populous state, Texas, this week began its own deregulation plan with officials promising that there would be no reprise of California's chaos. 
But consumer advocates, while generally agreeing that the Texas plan included better safeguards than California's, expressed skepticism that residential customers would benefit from long-term reductions as energy providers competed for business. These advocates also warned that Texas, like California, failed to provide adequate protection to ensure that the state did not suffer from electricity shortages as demand increased.
For Texas, deregulation comes not long after the Enron Corporation, the Houston energy giant that championed deregulated energy markets, collapsed into bankruptcy. Meanwhile, the chairman of the state agency that will oversee the deregulated electricity market, has come under fire for his ties to Enron. 
The official start of deregulation in Texas was New Year's Day, but today was the first business day of operation and, as yet, few of the 4.7 million eligible households had chosen to switch providers away from the longstanding utilities. State officials predicted that the transition would be gradual, particularly for residential customers, many of whom are still unaware that change is afoot. Nor have electricity retailers rushed into the residential market; as yet, 41 new retailers have registered, but most are seeking commercial and industrial clients. 
Terry Hadley, spokesman for the Texas Public Utility Commission, the agency overseeing the electricity marketplace, said electricity retailers were ''sharpening their pencils to see what kind of offers they can make.'' Several companies are already marketing to residential customers. and Mr. Hadley predicted that such appeals would intensify in coming months. 
Still uncertain is whether Texas customers will embrace deregulation, particularly after the problems in California. The rules here establish an immediate retail price reduction of 11 percent to 17 percent, a drop partly attributable to the low price of natural gas, which is often used to fuel electric generation plants. This savings is built into the ''price to beat,'' the state-mandated price per kilowatt hour that the old utilities will be allowed to charge under deregulation to keep their customers. New retailers will be allowed to offer lower prices as a way to entice customers to switch. 
Texas officials have taken pains to reassure consumers -- and journalists -- that California's problems were unique. 
In California, the state deregulated the wholesale power market while keeping retail prices capped. This caused the state's two biggest public utilities to lose billions of dollars when wholesale prices spiked and the retail price caps prevented them from passing the costs along to consumers. One reason the prices jumped was the price of natural gas, then at a record high. 
California officials, including Gov. Gray Davis, also accused several energy companies, including Enron, of manipulating prices and making the state's problems worse, a charge the companies denied. 
California's problems were also partly attributable to a lack of supply; the state had not built a major power plant in roughly a decade. 
The state endured rolling blackouts and other problems before federal regulators ordered restraints on electricity prices last summer. In September, the California Public Utilities Commission voted to shift away from deregulation. 
While about two dozen states, including most of those in the Northeast, have begun deregulation, others, like Nevada, New Mexico and Oklahoma have postponed plans in the wake of California's problems. Texas officials, on the other hand, express confidence in their plan. 
Unlike California, Texas deregulated the wholesale electrical market in 1995, providing a time buffer to work out any kinks before introducing retail deregulation this year. And also unlike California, Texas has seen about 30 power plants built in the state in the last six years. Officials say the state's electrical supply exceeds demand by 23 percent. 
Nor does the state's plan mandate the sort of retail price caps that crippled the California utilities. 
''We have more than enough capacity and supply of electricity,'' Mr. Hadley said. ''And the mechanics are in place to make adjustments for any dramatic spike in fuel costs.'' 
Consumer advocates are skeptical. Carol Biedrzycki, executive director of Texas Ratepayers Organization to Save Energy, said the state should have required electricity providers to maintain a ''reserve margin'' of electrical capacity of roughly 15 percent above demand. Ms. Biedrzycki said she believed that state officials had inflated power-generating capacity and could face problems of increasing demand in a few years. 
''In order to keep the prices stable, we have to have a reserve margin,'' she said. 
The Texas Public Utility Commission has been in the spotlight recently because of questions of whether its chairman, Max Yzaguirre, a former Enron executive appointed by Gov. Rick Perry, misrepresented his connections to the company on state disclosure forms. Last month, as Enron was in the midst of bankruptcy and laying off more than 4,000 employees, Mr. Yzaguirre revised his disclosure forms to expand the list of Enron-related companies to which he had been connected. 
Initially, he had listed his position with Enron's affiliate in Mexico. But his revised listing showed his membership on the board of the Enron North America Corporation and other related companies. Mr. Yzaguirre has attributed the omission to a simple oversight, but a spokesman for a leading Democratic candidate for governor, Tony Sanchez, questioned whether Mr. Yzaguirre had a conflict of interest. One of the new retailers seeking to enter the market, the New Power Company, is partly owned by Enron. 
Meanwhile, Mr. Hadley, the spokesman for the commission, said Enron's bankruptcy should not have an impact on deregulation in Texas. Some commercial customers had signed up with two Enron-related electricity retailers, he said, but state regulators are making certain that those customers can be switched to other providers.

COMPANIES & FINANCE INTERNATIONAL - Enron collapse turns focus on pension rules.

COMPANIES & FINANCE INTERNATIONAL - Enron collapse turns focus on pension rules - But a change in the law looks unlikely, writes Elizabeth Wine. 
The collapse of Enron, the energy trader, highlighted an uncomfortable fact about some US company retirement plans: workers at many of the largest companies have a dangerously high exposure to their employer because large chunks of their retirement plans are invested in the company's own stock.
In spite of calls for regulations to end such risky concentration and a bill introduced to Congress to cap company stock in retirement plans, industry watchers and congressional insiders say new rules are unlikely to emerge. 
About 60 per cent of Enron's $2.1bn retirement plan was in Enron stock and the fund was devastated by the share price plunge from a high of $80 last year to less than $1. 
Such a high concentration is par for the course among large US companies. According to a study of 219 of the largest defined contribution retirement plans, 45 of them - 20 per cent - have more than half their portfolios invested in company stock. 
The survey, by the Institute of Management and Administration, a business publisher, shows 25 plans have more than 60 per cent allocated to company shares. 
US companies receive generous tax breaks for matching employees' contributions to retirement plans and using shares makes contributions cheaper. The practice also settles a large block of shares with sympathetic owners, providing ballast in choppy markets. 
In December, the Democratic US Senators Barbara Boxer of California and Jon Corzine of New Jersey proposed legislation that would cap employer stock in such funds, called 401(k) plans, at 20 per cent. 
However, pension industry participants say the situation is not serious enough to really provoke change. Thousands of Enron employees were left with no nest egg, but it was just one company and there is no reason to believe that the off-balance-sheet deals that caused its demise are systemic. 
Part of the reason for the reluctance to enact laws, even in the face of public outrage, is the pro-business, anti-regulatory bent of a majority Republican Congress. Congress has created and reinforced that culture, by passing the tax breaks and other incentives, for the past 40 years. 
Dallas Salisbury, head of the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a pension policy group in Washington, notes that the defined contribution plans were designed to help workers retire with company stock - not to provide a diversified investment portfolio for retirement. 
Mr Salisbury suggests attempts to regulate the amount of company stock in defined contribution plans would hurt the very employees that policy-makers seek to help. Companies faced with a strict curtailment of their ability to contribute company stock would probably opt to halt contributions, he says. 
He may be right. Ford Motor for one has recently suspended its practice of contributing 60 cents for every $1 its workers contribute to their retirement fund. 
Sources close to Senator Corzine's office say he is considering another solution. Lawmakers could eliminate a clause in the 1974 retirement plan legislation that exempts companies from having to follow the principles of diversification when it comes to their own stock. 
"If that exemption were repealed, it would have the same effect as a cap," said Eli Gottesdiener, an attorney leading one of four employee lawsuits against Enron. 
However, without a cap, there would still be a grey area to allow companies to interpret "prudent diversification" as they wish.

Horrible Year Ends on Up Note At Cantor
Financial Health for the Firm And More Smiles for the Staff
By DIANA B. HENRIQUES

01/03/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 4
c. 2002 New York Times Company

As Howard W. Lutnick, the chairman of Cantor Fitzgerald, headed to Florida last weekend to see out the worst year of his life, he found himself, beyond all expectations, with good news to share. 
''I have told my families'' -- as Mr. Lutnick affectionately calls the survivors of the colleagues he lost on Sept. 11 -- ''that Cantor will be profitable in the fourth quarter,'' he said. With a faint trace of his old swagger, he added: ''We will be highly profitable -- not barely profitable, but highly profitable.''
The achievement would have been merely satisfying for the Wall Street bond-trading firm in a normal year. But ''normal'' and ''Cantor'' parted company on the day the terrorist attacks destroyed the firm's headquarters at the top of the World Trade Center and killed 658 of the 960 people working there, including Mr. Lutnick's brother, Gary. Since then, simply surviving might have been news enough for Cantor, which has promised 25 percent of any future profits to the families of those who were lost. Instead, Mr. Lutnick said in an interview, Cantor ended 2001 profitable enough to pay for the first of 10 years of promised health insurance for the families, with cash left over to distribute in mid-February as the first installment on a $100,000 minimum gift pledged to each family. 
The company bank accounts have been easier to repair than the people. Mr. Lutnick says he thinks of each surviving employee as ''a miracle.'' Nevertheless, there have been layoffs as the company has pulled out of weak businesses, and those have been more than usually bruising. 
In addition, some employees have been unable to go to work at all since Sept. 11 because of the emotional trauma they experienced, one executive said. ''We know that the greater impact of this will come three to six months down the road,'' this executive said. ''You have to wonder where some of these people will be then.'' 
But although all the Cantor employees still wrestle with the grief of having lost hundreds of close friends and colleagues -- one who was critically injured died not long ago, bringing fresh pain -- some say their days now include a little more laughter, a bit of optimism, a sense of having weathered the very worst of a continuing storm. 
''We smile,'' one executive said. ''We laugh. We're here together. We have a purpose.'' 
The people who have joined the firm since Sept. 11, almost exclusively in the stock-trading operations, ''have gotten a chance to get acclimated,'' said Philip Marber, the senior managing director who used to lose sleep worrying over how to recreate the well-oiled trading desk he lost. ''A little more chemistry is starting to occur. It's kind of jelling a little bit -- which is what we were hoping would happen.'' 
The surviving families seem more content with Mr. Lutnick, whose tearful televised promises to help were met with angry suspicion by early October. The company's new charity fund has distributed nearly $9 million in gifts -- Mr. Lutnick and other partners recently offered a $5 million matching grant to help the fund raise $10 million more -- and Cantor has paid roughly $45 million in promised bonuses and other benefits to the families since November. 
Mr. Lutnick is not bitter about the reaction, he said. 
''It was a moment in time,'' he said. ''They're sad it happened; I'm sad it happened. But it's past, it's over.'' 
In recent months, as he pulled out of a media spotlight that had blistered him in the weeks immediately after the attacks, he mailed 1,300 to 1,400 handwritten notes to the families of his lost employees. 
A private partnership, Cantor is not required to disclose profits. But it is also the majority owner of eSpeed, a publicly traded electronic trading network, which must keep investors informed about important trends. Here, too, Mr. Lutnick, as the chairman and chief executive, has room to boast. 
''A few weeks ago, I had the incredible pleasure of announcing that eSpeed would be profitable for the first time, in the fourth quarter of 2001,'' he said. Forecasting profit of a penny to a nickel a share, Mr. Lutnick added: ''We're not going to just make 'earnings per share,' which you can do with some accounting games, but we are going to make actual money.'' 
The eSpeed stock, suspended from Nasdaq trading for 18 days after Sept. 11, rallied after Mr. Lutnick's announcement. It closed yesterday at $8.35 a share, not far from its Sept. 10 closing price of $8.69, but nowhere near its peak of almost $83 a share in March 2000, or even its initial offering price two years ago of $22. 
''There are not many e-commerce companies left standing, let alone ones that have met their forecasts,'' Mr. Lutnick said. 
It is not possible to say how these gains will affect Mr. Lutnick's own compensation. At Cantor, he is the general managing partner of a private limited partnership, which does not disclose compensation for any of its partners, including Mr. Lutnick. At eSpeed, where his 2000 salary was $350,000 and his bonus was $650,000, his 2001 compensation has not yet been made public. 
The rebounding stock market was one important ingredient in the fourth-quarter recovery at Cantor, of course. Fortunately for Cantor, some 75 percent of the firm's top revenue producers in its stock-trading business worked outside the doomed New York office. 
Yesterday, Cantor opened an office in Shrewsbury, N.J., easing the crowding in the makeshift trading room Mr. Marber set up in Midtown Manhattan after the attacks. The new suburban office will start with 10 people, but Mr. Marber hopes it will grow to about 25 if the firm's stock-trading business continues to thrive. 
Cantor and eSpeed each carried $40 million in property insurance and $25 million in business-interruption coverage, according to Mr. Lutnick. That is expected to largely cover the property and business damage, including an estimated $32.4 million in total losses at eSpeed and additional undisclosed partnership losses at Cantor. 
But Cantor's recovering profits also benefited, perversely, from some terrible luck -- its own and that of the Enron Corporation. 
Well before the attacks, Cantor had begun to shift its core business, trading government and corporate bonds for big institutional clients, from expensive human traders to the less-expensive electronic trading system operated by eSpeed. With the sudden loss of so many of its traders, Cantor was forced overnight to shift more of its lower-margin business to eSpeed. Though eSpeed itself lost about 180 of its 477 worldwide employees, it was nevertheless able to resume operations within 48 hours of the attacks. 
''We always knew that eSpeed would be our future,'' said Joseph C. Noviello, now that company's chief information officer. ''But that future arrived instantly on Sept. 11.'' 
With that future, Cantor has stepped out of about a dozen markets where its traders were once active. ''There was too much of a human loss to go back and try to rebuild it the old way,'' Mr. Lutnick said. ''We have to be different; we have to play the hands that have been dealt to us.'' 
To be sure, eSpeed still faces stiff competition in the rapidly consolidating electronic bond-trading arena, which has shrunk by almost a third of its players over the last year, according to a tally by the Bond Market Association. But Mr. Lutnick says eSpeed is still ''the dominant system for trading U.S. Treasury securities around the country,'' and Wall Street analysts generally agree. 
In addition, eSpeed got a boost from the trouble at Enron, the giant energy company that filed for bankruptcy a month ago. Before its collapse, Enron was doing a bustling business through Enron Online, its energy trading service. After Enron failed, that trading shifted to more diverse trading networks, including TradeSpark, which is jointly owned by Cantor, eSpeed and five large energy companies including a subsidiary of the Williams Companies. 
Indeed, TradeSpark is powered by eSpeed's technology and pays eSpeed a commission on each transaction, Mr. Noviello explained. ''So that business has seen enormous growth since the fall of Enron,'' he said. 
But despite a more upbeat mood and a strong sense of having delivered on an important pledge to their lost friends' families, everyone at Cantor is ready to leave 2001 behind, employees said. 
''Last week, to top it all off, I got hit by a cab,'' Mr. Marber said. ''Right on 39th Street. A lot of bumps and bruises, nothing worse. But I remember thinking, as I picked myself up: 'Please, I just want this year to end.' ''

Deal Sense
CEO of New York City
by Jeffrey Kanige

01/03/2002
The Daily Deal
Copyright (c) 2002 The Deal LLC

Acting like a Wall Street CEO, Michael Bloomberg's first significant action as New York City mayor is to trim the budget with promised layoffs. 
Michael Bloomberg, an unlikely politician who made his name and fortune as chief executive of a media empire, took over as mayor of New York Tuesday and immediately introduced a CEO's mentality to City Hall.
Unfortunately for New Yorkers, it is an airline CEO's mentality. 
With the city poised to reap tens of billions of dollars in federal bailout funds, Bloomberg's first significant action was to announce layoffs. Mayor Mike said he would cut his own staff by 20% and urged other elected officials to do the same. Soon, small packets of heavily salted nuts will become ubiquitous on subway cars and the Broadway Local will be subject to three-hour delays due to bad weather in Boston. 
Of course, it could be worse. Bloomberg could adopt an AT&T CEO's mentality and proclaim his intention to remake the city into a national colossus by buying Camden, N.J., Savannah, Ga. and Bettendorf, Iowa for $100 billion. Then, after spending billions on new roads and bridges, a hostile takeover bid would force the mayor-CEO to sell Manhattan and Brooklyn to Philadelphia for $70 billion. With his vision shredded, Mayor Mike's only consolation would come from being named sanitation commissioner in the new city. 
Or he could adopt an Enron CEO's mentality and become a Wall Street darling by consistently producing a solid municipal balance sheet -- even though nobody is quite sure how he is accomplishing such a feat while tax revenues are shrinking. It will soon become clear, however, that the mayor-CEO has hidden the city's debt by shifting it offshore to the Long Island suburbs. As his once-trusted aides resign in disgrace and the city declares bankruptcy, Bloomberg will insist that he didn't know anything about how the government was being run. Despite the apparent absurdity of the claim, most people will believe him. 
To be fair, Bloomberg could emulate the qualities of a truly admirable CEO. In so doing, he could inspire the city's workers to greater productivity by treating them humanely and paying them decent wages. Dealing with government institutions would actually become a pleasant experience. This approach, however, would subject the mayor-CEO to merciless attacks by the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal and the city's Murdochian media outlets. 
And, to be honest, most New Yorkers probably wouldn't want such a milquetoast mayor-CEO. What they really want is a Microsoft mayor-CEO. They want a mayor who will make New York the most powerful player in the city sector. They want a city that is feared by other, obviously inferior municipalities. Newark wants the Yankees? Newark is toast. And let that be a lesson to you, Hoboken. American Express isn't leaving home. Period. 
So what if city services regularly crash for no reason? Who cares if buses made in other cities won't run on New York streets? Eventually, everyone will adapt and inter-municipal commerce will be much more efficient when every city is New York. 
Now that's a mentality with which New Yorkers are comfortable.

News; Domestic
Top Story: Interview With Monica Crowley and Ellis Henican
Bill O'Reilly

01/02/2002
Fox News: The O'Reilly Factor
(c) Copyright Federal Document Clearing House. All Rights Reserved.
-- Excerpts Only --
BILL REILLY, HOST: I'm Bill O'Reilly. Thanks for watching us tonight, and a very happy New Year to you on this first edition of THE FACTOR 2002. 
There are certain things the government must get accomplished this year, and that is the subject of this evening's Talking Points memo.
Number one, the death of bin Laden. That's obvious. 
Number two, the capture and trial in front of a military tribunal of Mullah Omar. He should be charged with crimes against humanity. 
Number three, fuel conservation. OPEC has once again cut production in the face of a worldwide recession and a war on terror. These nations are not our friends. The Bush administration should embark in a serious conservation campaign using tax credits for those who save fuel and higher taxes for those who waste it. 
We have to stop fooling around here. Alternative fuels must be aggressively pursued. 
Number four, the minimum wage should be raised $1 to $6.15 an hour. 
Number five, zero percent interest loans should be made available to workers whose unemployment insurance runs out. 
Number six, the capital gains tax should be cut by 20 percent to stimulate investment in the nation's corporations. 
Number seven, tax credits should be given to corporations who hire workers and invest in their own infrastructure. Obviously, that would help the economy. 
Number eight, the U.S. military should assist the border patrol in securing the borders. This must happen for all of us to become secure, and for the flow of narcotics to diminish. 
Number nine, President Bush must order John Ashcroft to investigate the Enron situation, where executives walked away with millions while millions of everyday Americans got hosed. This cannot stand. 
And number 10, money and guns must be given to the opponents of Saddam Hussein in order to destabilize that terrorist regime. 
So there's the no spin 202 (ph) agenda for the good of all Americans. No excuses will be accepted. 
That's the memo. 
Now for the "Top Story" tonight, two other points of view on the year ahead. With us now are Fox News analyst Dr. Monica Crowley and Ellis Henican.
..................
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
O'REILLY: Continuing now with what has to happen in the year 2002, we're talking with Dr. Monica Crowley and Ellis Henican, both Fox News analysts. All right. 
This Enron situation, this is bad, this is bad. And, you know, Americans haven't been paying too much attention to it because of the war on terror and the economy, and I understand that. But you got four weasels here in Enron, four big shots, all of whom, in the space of a year, took out millions, and in one case $30 million, for themselves, all right? 
And then this thing collapses, with the help of all the idiots on the Cavuto show and CNBC and all those iddi (ph), Oh, Enron, Enron, Enron. And then boom, people lose their 401(K)s, and the people in Enron couldn't sell their own stock, they were prohibited from selling it. 
HENICAN: (UNINTELLIGIBLE) 
O'REILLY: So are you telling me that the Justice Department of the United States should not launch a criminal investigation into this? 
HENICAN: Oh, absolutely they should. But let's remember the historical context here. Enron is an organization that got a lot, a lot of support over the years from a group of Texans who are running America right now, and it shouldn't surprise you, Bill O'Reilly, that they were a little slow jumping on your train. 
O'REILLY: Well, but see, you, you're... 
CROWLEY: Well, (UNINTELLIGIBLE)... 
O'REILLY: ... you have this conspiratorial thing... 
HENICAN: (UNINTELLIGIBLE), I'm just saying... 
CROWLEY: (UNINTELLIGIBLE) 
O'REILLY: ... I'm going to say, I'm going to say, Look, if Ashcroft doesn't do it, then I'm going to be with you. 
HENICAN: Well, we should all do it. 
O'REILLY: But Ashcroft himself is the guy who should be out point on this, right? 
HENICAN: Well, all I'm say... 
O'REILLY: He should be the point man on this, right? 
CROWLEY: And the president... 
HENICAN: ... all I'm saying, see the, see the historical context here, as I join you in your call... 
CROWLEY: Wait a minute, no, Ellis... 
HENICAN: ... that we smash these people. 
CROWLEY: ... you're trying to make this into a political scandal... 
HENICAN: Well, it is a political scandal. 
CROWLEY: ... and not that, no, it is not that. 
HENICAN: Not yet. Not yet, but it's pretty darn close. 
CROWLEY: The president of the United States... 
HENICAN: It's darn close. 
CROWLEY: ... should order his attorney general to launch an investigation into this... 
O'REILLY: Why hasn't he done that? 
CROWLEY: ... there should also be congressional investigations... 
HENICAN: I told you why. 
CROWLEY: ... the collapse of this company was absolutely breathtaking, to go from the world's largest energy supply company, all right, trading at $85 a share, to filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, trading at 30 cents a share, within the space of a few months, when all those top executives, all right? 
O'REILLY: That's right, it's outrageous. 
CROWLEY: Walked away with hundreds of millions... 
HENICAN: And you don't think... 
CROWLEY: ... of -- no... 
HENICAN: ... and you don't think Bush and Cheney... 
CROWLEY: ... but, but wait a minute... 
HENICAN: ... have been looking the other way? 
CROWLEY: ... it is -- Ellis, it is... 
(CROSSTALK) 
O'REILLY: No, I don't think they care. 
(CROSSTALK) 
HENICAN: ... don't be naive. Don't be naive. 
O'REILLY: I don't think they care. I don't think they... 
(CROSSTALK) 
CROWLEY: First of all... 
O'REILLY: ... now they have to care. 
CROWLEY: First of all... 
(CROSSTALK) 
O'REILLY: Now they have to care. 
(CROSSTALK) 
CROWLEY: They're not that stupid to get involved in this kind of situation, first of all. 
HENICAN: (UNINTELLIGIBLE)... 
CROWLEY: Number one. Number two... 
O'REILLY: They might be that stupid... 
CROWLEY: ... it is -- it is... 
(CROSSTALK) 
CROWLEY: ... no, I really don't -- after eight years of... 
(CROSSTALK) 
HENICAN: ... Texas (UNINTELLIGIBLE)... 
(CROSSTALK) 
CROWLEY: ... Clinton, Clinton administration... 
O'REILLY: Listen, what if that list that Cheney's hiding -- and there's no question Cheney's hiding the list... 
HENICAN: Indeed. 
O'REILLY: ... of the people that you mentioned before, the energy advisers, he's hiding the list, there's no reason why he can't put that list out. 
CROWLEY: He... 
O'REILLY: What if, at the top of that list, is Ken Lay (ph)? 
CROWLEY: Well, well, and we know... 
O'REILLY: ... which is probably there. 
(CROSSTALK) 
CROWLEY: ... we know that Ken Lay is very close to the president and Dick Cheney, and we know that he was at the White House and engaged in some of these meetings... 
O'REILLY: He's got to be investigated. 
CROWLEY: ... (UNINTELLIGIBLE) for the energy task force. 
O'REILLY: He's got to be investigated. 
CROWLEY: Of course he has to, that's why this order has to come from the president to John Ashcroft. 
HENICAN: (UNINTELLIGIBLE) 
CROWLEY: But it's illogical to suggest... 
(CROSSTALK) 
O'REILLY: ... and you know why Janet Reno wouldn't? 
(CROSSTALK) 
HENICAN: ... yesterday's news... 
(CROSSTALK) 
O'REILLY: Well, wait a minute, hold it, yesterday's news always applies to today's news. 
HENICAN: We're waiting still. 
O'REILLY: You got a corrupt Justice Department. We have a corrupt Justice Department. We've had a corrupt Justice Department for 10 years. Now, just because the (UNINTELLIGIBLE) general change didn't mean the culture of the department changed. It's still corrupt. 
HENICAN: Well, and new guys are in charge, and we're waiting. 
O'REILLY: All right. 
CROWLEY: Yes, but the bulk of the... 
(CROSSTALK) 
O'REILLY: ... fair enough. 
CROWLEY: ... but I think, Ellis, it's illogical to suggest that Enron somehow benefited in any significant way from close ties to the White House... 
O'REILLY: Well, if they don't investigate, then they will. 
(CROSSTALK) 
CROWLEY: ... but, but, but the company would not have gone under if they had been... 
O'REILLY: Well, that's free market... 
(CROSSTALK) 
O'REILLY: What else you got on your list? 
(CROSSTALK) 
HENICAN: ... I know you've been pooh-poohing this one, Bill, but I think it's still important that we do something about the dreadful way that voting goes on in this country... 
O'REILLY: All right. You know what we should do, Ellis? 
HENICAN: ... the federal government... 
O'REILLY: Here's what we should do. 
HENICAN: ... has a -- the people have a right to vote in a fair election. 
O'REILLY: I'm going to put you in charge. No, Ellis wants more, easier, whatever... 
HENICAN: One man, one vote. 
O'REILLY: ... one man vote. 
HENICAN: How about that? 
O'REILLY: I'm going to put you in charge of going to the house and driving these people who can't vote to the polls. 
HENICAN: (UNINTELLIGIBLE), all I want... 
O'REILLY: I'm putting you in charge of that. 
HENICAN: ... to say... 
O'REILLY: All right. 
HENICAN: ... is that... 
O'REILLY: Come on. 
HENICAN: ... when someone shows up at the polls, we ought to count their vote in a fair way. Why wouldn't you embrace that? That's very, very simple. 
O'REILLY: Because here's why I won't embrace it. 
HENICAN: It's very simple. 
O'REILLY: Because any moron can go in there and vote. And the morons who can't... 
HENICAN: Well... 
O'REILLY: ... I have no sympathy for them at all. 
HENICAN: ... we know that an awful lot of people that you call morons thought they voted, tried to vote, showed up to vote... 
(CROSSTALK) 
HENICAN: ... and they couldn't vote, they couldn't vote. 
(CROSSTALK) 
O'REILLY: They couldn't cut it. They couldn't do it. 
HENICAN: You can't be happy with that. 
O'REILLY: They couldn't punch the chad. So I'm putting you in charge. 
HENICAN: Bill, (UNINTELLIGIBLE) feel good. 
O'REILLY: You can take them to the... 
HENICAN: That makes you feel good. 
CROWLEY: (UNINTELLIGIBLE) Ellis... 
O'REILLY: ... and you can punch it for them, Ellis. There you go. 
HENICAN: You can't feel good... 
CROWLEY: (UNINTELLIGIBLE) smarting... 
HENICAN: ... about that. 
CROWLEY: ... that Al Gore is not sitting in the White House right now. That issue is so... 
HENICAN: I just want the winner to have won. 
CROWLEY: ... over. We're in a war... 
HENICAN: I want the winner to win. 
CROWLEY: ... (UNINTELLIGIBLE)... 
O'REILLY: He's never, he's never... 
HENICAN: Let the winner win. 
O'REILLY: ... going to let it go. 
CROWLEY: I think that the government should actually get serious this year and committed to rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse in everal -- every federal agency and institution... 
O'REILLY: Did you set up another federal agency... 
CROWLEY: ... whatever (UNINTELLIGIBLE) -- absolutely not... 
O'REILLY: ... to do that? 
CROWLEY: ... why do we need another bureaucracy (UNINTELLIGIBLE)... 
O'REILLY: Who, who should do it, though? 
CROWLEY: The administration should spearhead this... 
O'REILLY: For who? 
CROWLEY: ... and the president of the United States should say, Every taxpayer dollar that comes into a federal agency or institution... 
O'REILLY: Yes. 
CROWLEY: ... should be accounted for. 
O'REILLY: But they... 
CROWLEY: You're out there every day, O'Reilly, railing against... 
O'REILLY: I am, but I'll tell you what... 
CROWLEY: ... (UNINTELLIGIBLE) lack of respect for the American taxpayer... 
O'REILLY: ... there isn't anybody set up to do that. See, the GAO doesn't do it until there's a scandal, as you know. They don't get called in until it's already out of control... 
CROWLEY: Well, maybe that's (UNINTELLIGIBLE)... 
O'REILLY: -the congressional committees, they're supposed to do it... 
CROWLEY: Forget about Congress, they're (UNINTELLIGIBLE)... 
O'REILLY: ... you've got to create... 
CROWLEY: ... they live on (UNINTELLIGIBLE)... 
(CROSSTALK) 
HENICAN: It's got to come from the outside. 
O'REILLY: Wait a minute. You know what you've got to create... 
HENICAN: It's got to come from the outside. 
O'REILLY: ... is a tax police, and you know who's in charge of the tax police? Giuliani. That's what I'd do. 
HENICAN: Maybe, maybe. 
O'REILLY: Tax police. 
HENICAN: In the end, in the end, though, government responds when outsiders like me and you and Monica make them respond. 
CROWLEY: Well, I'm, I'm... 
HENICAN: They're not going to do this themselves... 
CROWLEY: ... sick and tired of... 
HENICAN: ... you got to shine and a light on them... 
CROWLEY: ... I'm sick and tired of... 
O'REILLY: Oh, I (UNINTELLIGIBLE) disagree with that. 
CROWLEY: ... of, having 60 percent of my paycheck go to federal, state... 
O'REILLY: Oh, I am too, it's disgusting. 
HENICAN: We all hate taxes. 
CROWLEY: ... municipal, property, sales, gas tax. It is outrageous in this country that we're taxed at the level we are, and there's so much waste, fraud, and abuse... 
HENICAN: Right, absolutely right. 
CROWLEY: ... there are certain things I don't mind... 
(CROSSTALK) 
CROWLEY: ... paying for, the military... 
HENICAN: We all hate taxes. 
O'REILLY: All right, do you have anything else... 
(CROSSTALK) 
HENICAN: ... sure, lots of, lots of things... 
O'REILLY: ... you have anything else, (UNINTELLIGIBLE)... 
HENICAN: ... what about these economic embargoes that we know fail, it hasn't worked in Cuba, it hasn't worked in Iraq, it hurts the poor people, and it keeps the despots in power. Let's learn a lesson this year. 
O'REILLY: No embargoes. 
HENICAN: And say, You know what? Let's think of something new. There's a lot of ways to pressure our enemies. These things don't work. 
O'REILLY: All right. 
CROWLEY: Well, I'm for lifting the embargo on Cuba... 
HENICAN: Didn't work. 
CROWLEY: ... but I'm not for lifting it on Iraq. 
O'REILLY: Well, it doesn't work on Iraq... 
CROWLEY: No, no, no... 
O'REILLY: ... Germany sends them whatever they want anyway. 
(CROSSTALK) 
CROWLEY: ... and we've got this oil for food deal in Iraq, and Saddam Hussein just takes all the money and he's pouring it into weapons of mass destruction programs. So... 
O'REILLY: Yes, I'm not big, I'm not a big embargo guy. 
HENICAN: Doesn't work. Just doesn't work. 
(CROSSTALK) 
O'REILLY: I'm a big assassination guy. 
CROWLEY: (UNINTELLIGIBLE)... 
O'REILLY: It's the only thing that's much better. You know what I mean? 
CROWLEY: Quicker... 
(CROSSTALK) 
HENICAN: Well, you want to kill this year. I want to save two lives. 
O'REILLY: Oh, you (UNINTELLIGIBLE)... 
HENICAN: ... those of Sandra Day O'Connor and John Paul Stevens. If we lose those moderates on the Supreme Court... 
O'REILLY: Who's we, Ellis, you and your pot-smoking friends? 
HENICAN: Decent American people... 
O'REILLY: All right, yes, OK, wait... 
HENICAN: ... decent American people. If we lose... 
O'REILLY: ... look... 
HENICAN: ... those people, (UNINTELLIGIBLE)... 
O'REILLY: ... we don't want to see anybody die... 
HENICAN: ... the Supreme Court becomes hard right... 
O'REILLY: ... particularly Supreme Court justices. 
CROWLEY: No, but we do... 
(CROSSTALK) 
O'REILLY: Who ruled correctly, by the way, in the Bush-Gore... 
(CROSSTALK) 
HENICAN: Maybe so, but I want to give them, I want to give them protein powder, gym memberships, and some kind of memory-enhancing drugs... 
O'REILLY: Paid for by us, right, Ellis? 
(CROSSTALK) 
HENICAN: ... I'll cover the gym membership. 
O'REILLY: All right, thank you very much, both, for coming in here and mixing it up in... 
CROWLEY: Thank you. 
O'REILLY: ... 2002... 
CROWLEY: Happy New Year. 
O'REILLY: ... that's what has to happen. 
Enron, if you're listening, attorney general, I'm not letting you go on this one.

The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.    

If you have any questions please contact Richard Hensch at ext. 35522.

Tom -

I am currently planning on having Dave run the west risk desk,  and leaving O over Texas.  So I just want to make sure that we are still on the same page with Dave coming back down here.  If not,  I need to make some changes to the organization.

Thanks

Enron Board Learned Of Executive's Concerns In Oct -Atty
By Jason Leopold

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES=20

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp.'s (ENRNQ) board of directors didn't l=
earn until October that an Enron executive had serious concerns that accoun=
ting improprieties could bring down the company, according to an attorney f=
or the board, although word of those concerns had spread throughout the com=
pany by early September.
The executive, Sherron Watkins, raised her concerns with Chairman and Chief=
 Executive Ken Lay in August. But they weren't shared with board members be=
sides Lay until it was too late to do anything, said attorney Neil Egglesto=
n, who represents Enron's board in federal investigations of the company.=
=20
"The first they remember hearing of this issue is in early October in conne=
ction with the Vinson & Elkins review," Eggleston said.=20
Vinson & Elkins, Enron's outside law firm, conducted a review of Watkins' c=
oncerns at Lay's request. The firm submitted its findings in a report dated=
 Oct. 15, concluding that the company's handling of its off-balance-sheet p=
artnerships was proper but could be portrayed in a way that could be damagi=
ng to Enron.=20
Enron's board is named in a number of civil and class action lawsuits assoc=
iated with the company's collapse. The audit committee had reviewed some of=
 the off-balance sheet partnerships now at the center of federal investigat=
ions, and the full board voted twice to suspend Enron's code of ethics to a=
llow former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow to run partnerships even =
as he served as an officer for Enron.=20
Robert Jaedicke, the chairman of the board's audit committee, became aware =
of Watkins' concerns a few days before the committee met on Oct. 8, Egglest=
on said. Vinson & Elkins advised others on the committee at the meeting, an=
d the rest of the board was informed a couple of days before the firm relea=
sed its report.=20
The text of the Vinson & Elkins report supports that chain of events. Rober=
t Bennett, an attorney representing Enron in federal investigations of the =
company, wasn't sure when management first notified the board, but deferred=
 to Eggleston's account.=20

Board Committee Established Later=20

On Oct. 31, after news of losses related to transactions with partnerships =
run by Enron executives had set off the energy company's spiral into bankru=
ptcy court, Enron established a special board committee to look into the tr=
ansactions. William Powers, dean of the University of Texas Law School, was=
 named to head the committee.=20
Watkins' concerns about accounting practices related to the off-balance she=
et partnerships were already known in August by the company's general couns=
el, Enron auditor Arthur Andersen and the company's top management.=20
Watkins detailed her concerns in a letter to Lay on Aug. 15. She met with L=
ay on Aug. 22 to discuss the letter, in which she specifically cautioned La=
y against using Vinson & Elkins to look into the matter "due to conflict."=
=20
By September, lower-level employees at the company were also aware.=20
"I heard in September, maybe the first week in September, for the first tim=
e that someone accused Enron of shady practices," said Inderpal Singh, a ma=
nager of finance who works for Enron global markets in the finance and stru=
cturing department. "Everybody in my division started talking about it, and=
 we were worried because we all thought everything was OK at Enron."=20
Philip Hilder, Watkins attorney, said his client tried in September and Oct=
ober to contact other people in Enron, including the board of directors, to=
 warn them about accounting improprieties, because she wasn't satisfied wit=
h the steps Lay was taking to ensure Enron's financial health.=20
"Yes, she did write additional letters to others at Enron about her concern=
s after she met with Mr. Lay," Hilder said in an interview Sunday.=20
Eggleston said Monday that board members don't recall having received a pho=
ne call, fax or email from Watkins.=20
"But then again, if the board received a call from Sherron Watkins, they wo=
uldn't necessarily know who she is," Eggleston added.=20

Other Letters=20

Ken Johnson, a spokesman for the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which=
 released Watkins' Aug. 15 letter last week, said late Tuesday that the com=
mittee is aware of additional written warnings sent by Watkins to others at=
 the company following her contacts with Lay.=20
"I can't say specifically who she sent them to at Enron, but we're in the p=
rocess of reviewing them and at some point we intend to discuss them with h=
er," Johnson said.=20
One Enron executive said Watkins appeared to be on a "mission," warning "ev=
eryone she came in contact with" about the partnerships and questionable ac=
counting practices she believed would ruin the company.=20
One of the letters Watkins wrote was sent to Enron Chief Financial Officer =
Jeff McMahon on Oct. 16, the day Enron released third-quarter earnings that=
 showed a $618 million loss due in part to transactions with off-balance sh=
eet partnerships run by the company's executives, Hilder said.=20
Watkins, 42, who currently earns $165,000 a year as a vice president of com=
munications at Enron, wrote that her "worst nightmare" had come true, refer=
ring to the scenario she had described in her much-publicized August letter=
 to Lay, Hilder said.=20
Watkins, who has done work for four off-balance sheet partnerships includin=
g JEDI, Cash, Cactus I and Caribou, was upset that Enron officers made only=
 scant reference to the partnerships in the earnings announcement and faile=
d to explain adequately the reasons behind the writeoffs, Hilder said.=20
McMahon didn't return a call seeking comment.=20
Richard Watkins, Sherron Watkins' husband, said his wife called him Oct. 16=
 after the earnings report to express her concerns.=20
"She was disappointed and frustrated no one listened to her," Richard Watki=
ns said in an interview.=20
Sherron Watkins met with Lay again at the end of October, at which time Lay=
 told her a special board committee would be formed to look into her allega=
tions, Hilder said.=20
Bennett confirmed the meeting.=20
According to Richard Watkins, when Enron said in early November that it was=
 restating four years' worth of earnings, his wife told him: "I'm going to =
have to look for another job. This company is going to go bankrupt."=20

Enron's Board Ignored Signs of Losses, Dorgan Says
2002-01-23 14:46 (New York)

     Washington, Jan. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s board failed to act w=
hen it knew partnerships that were used to hide debt and unprofitable inves=
tments were leading to losses that shareholders would eventually absorb, Se=
nator Byron Dorgan said.
     ``It seems to me they had some warnings, and probably even considered =
those warnings and must have discarded them,'' Dorgan, who is leading an in=
vestigation into Enron's bankruptcy, said in an interview. ``I'm very surpr=
ised.''
     The Consumer Affairs Subcommittee, led by Dorgan, a North Dakota Democ=
rat, has received transcripts and minutes of meetings that show Enron's boa=
rd discussed the roles played by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fast=
ow and Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Skilling in setting and running Enro=
n's partnerships.
     Those partnerships had losses that forced Enron to restate $586 millio=
n in income since 1996. That led lenders to cut off credit, impairing the c=
ompany's main business, trading electricity and natural gas. Shareholders l=
ost $26 billion in market value and $850 million in pension funds vanished.
     Dorgan, who will chair a hearing Feb. 4, said his panel received 41 bo=
xes of documents from Enron. Chairman Kenneth Lay has agreed to testify. Fa=
stow, who Enron ousted Oct. 24, and Skilling, who resigned Aug. 14, haven't=
 responded to requests they testify, Dorgan said.

Information Needed

     The committee is still seeking some documents Enron hasn't supplied, i=
ncluding details about who invested in the partnerships and evidence of the=
 board's approval, Dorgan said. He said he didn't have any independent info=
rmation about document shredding at Enron that may have happened as recentl=
y as two weeks ago.
     ``One would expect what has happened here probably includes some viola=
tion of law,'' Dorgan said. ``At this point we don't know enough.''
     Dorgan plans several hearings that will investigate possible conflicts=
 of interest in the accounting and investment banking industries that were =
highlighted by the Enron bankruptcy, the largest in U.S. history. Nine othe=
r House and Senate committees are examining other aspects of Enron's failur=
e.
     Auditor Arthur Andersen LLP's acceptance of Enron's accounting has ren=
ewed interest in passing laws preventing auditors from consulting and accou=
nting for the same client.
     ``It's likely we'll want to evaluate some legislative changes,'' said =
Dorgan, who served as North Dakota's tax commissioner from 1966 until 1980.

Pensions, Analysts and Partnerships

     Dorgan said he saw good chances for legislation to restrict 401(k) ret=
irement plans from being heavily invested in one stock. He said rules shoul=
d also be changed to remove conflicts of interest in large investment banki=
ng firms that may have caused stock analysts to rate Enron a ``buy'' or bet=
ter until shares collapsed.
       The Senate Commerce Committee asked Enron in a Jan. 8 letter for a f=
ull accounting of all affiliated partnerships the company formed. The partn=
erships, set up throughout the 1990s, hid
debt and investment losses and created buyers for power plants. Some of the=
m were capitalized only with Enron stock, according to a letter an Enron ex=
ecutive sent Lay in August.
     ``The construct of those partnerships played a significant role in the=
 destruction of this company,'' Dorgan said.
     The role of the board of directors in Enron's downfall has received ne=
w scrutiny since the disclosure last week that an internal probe by the law=
 firm of Vinson & Elkins last October said the board's audit committee revi=
ewed some partnerships.
     The directors approved the partnerships and they suspended the company=
 ethics code to allow partnerships to be created, the report says. The law =
firm said it didn't uncover any wrongdoing.

Conflict of Interest

     Enron lawyer Robert Bennett repeated earlier claims that many of the d=
etails of the questionable transactions weren't shared with the board.
     ``What will become clear if the good senator is prepared to wait for t=
he completion of his investigation is that a tremendous amount of informati=
on was not known by members of the board,'' Bennett said. ``Why are we havi=
ng hearings if conclusions have already been reached?''
     Citing transcripts, Dorgan disagreed.  ``They clearly talked about the=
 conflict of interest,'' he said. ``They actually had some discussions abou=
t what Fastow was doing and what Skilling was
learning.''
     Under one arrangement, controlled by Fastow, Enron avoided $550 millio=
n in losses through a partnership called Raptor, according to the letter se=
nt to Lay. Raptor agreed to pay Enron if the energy trader's investment por=
tfolio of Internet and energy shares fell. If those shares rose, Raptor boo=
ked the gain and paid the income to Enron. Raptor's only asset was the prom=
ise that Enron would issue enough shares to pay back the partnership for wh=
atever it had paid to cover stock losses.

`What Was Their Risk'

     In another case, Enron used stock to set up a partnership that sold $1=
.2 billion in bonds and paid Enron $800 million for 14 power plants. Enron =
booked the money as net income.
     ``We need to get information on who invested in the partnerships, what=
 are the names, what were their investment stakes, what were their returns,=
 what was their risk,'' Dorgan
said.
     Besides Lay and Skilling, directors named in lawsuits include Wendy Le=
e Gramm, a professor at George Mason University and wife of U.S. Senator Ph=

Enron Board Protected From Lawsuits, Experts Say
2002-01-23 14:50 (New York)

     New York, Jan. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s directors enjoy legal p=
rotection that may make it difficult for investors to sue them successfully=
, legal experts say.
     The directors are named as defendants in 40 investor lawsuits claiming=
 the company concealed losses that led to Enron's bankruptcy. The company a=
nd its officials also are targets of government criminal and civil investig=
ations.
     ``All it takes is a pencil to sue a board of directors,'' said Larry H=
amermesh, a corporate law professor at Widener University.  ``Making a case=
 against directors is a lot harder.''
     Federal and state laws hold boards responsible for only the most serio=
us fraud and misrepresentation, experts say. They are designed to shield di=
rectors from legal liability to make service on the board more attractive.
     U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan said transcripts of Enron board meetings sho=
w that directors discussed conflicts of interest and
the roles of senior executives in partnerships used to shield the company's=
 debt. The transcripts show they ignored warnings about
the company's problems, said Dorgan, a North Dakota Democrat leading a Sena=
te Commerce Committee investigation.
     W. Neil Eggleston, attorney for Enron's outside directors, declined to=
 comment on the suits against his clients. He said none
has been asked to testify before any congressional committee investigating =
Enron. Robert S. Bennett, who represents board members who also are corpora=
te officers, wasn't available for comment, his office said.
     Eggleston said a ``motion to dismiss'' for lack of grounds to sue is t=
ypically the first step a lawyer for directors will take when a corporate b=
oard is sued. ``In this suit, it is hard to say what will happen,'' he said=
.

Liability Insurance

     The Enron board and officers have liability insurance with the St. Pau=
l Companies and the Associated Electric & Gas Insurance
Services Ltd. ``We can't discuss the terms of the policy,'' said Pat Hirigo=
yen, a spokesman for St. Paul. St. Paul said its policies provide Enron off=
icers and directors with $19 million in coverage.
     The AEGIS policy provides $35 million in coverage for legal fees and r=
elated expenses, according to the policy filed in the
bankruptcy documents.
     Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Enron, said the company provides insuranc=
e for the legal costs of directors and executives. He
declined to comment on liability coverage.
     Elson said most policies don't pay off if the directors are successful=
ly sued for fraud but may cover reckless behavior.
     Enron, once the largest energy trader and the nation's seventh largest=
 company, filed for bankruptcy in December after reporting its earnings ove=
r five years were inflated by $586 million. The company admitted it hid muc=
h of its debt in off-the- books partnerships.

`Poor Judgment'

     ``Just having poor judgment or being sloppy isn't enough'' for a succe=
ssful suit against the directors, said Charles Elson,
director of the Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delawa=
re. ``If it was easy to sue directors, it would be hard
to get anyone to sit on a board.''
     Elson said shareholders, to be successful, must show directors were ``=
reckless or fraudulent.''
     Still, the board approved the partnerships and, according to a report =
by Enron's counsel, Vinson & Elkins, suspended the
company ethics code to let former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow cre=
ate partnerships between himself and Enron.
     ``The board determined that Mr. Fastow's participation in the partners=
hips would not adversely affect the interest of Enron,''
the company said in a securities filing in November.
     Seven of 12 outside board members received consulting fees or business=
 deals from Enron, and four board members sold stock while Enron was issuin=
g inaccurate financial statements.

Material Disclosure

     ``This may make a securities action a little easier,'' Elson said. ``F=
or it raises the question of whether the board failed to
make a material disclosure it should have.''
     Two corporate officers, Kenneth Lay, the chairman and founder of Enron=
, and Jeffrey Skilling, chief executive officer before he
resigned in August, also sat on the board.
     Besides Lay, Enron directors named in some of the lawsuits include Wen=
dy Lee Gramm, a professor at George Mason University and wife of U.S. Senat=
or Phil Gramm; Norman P. Blake Jr., the chief executive officer of Comdisco=
 Inc.; Enron Vice Chairman Mark A. Frevert; Robert A. Belfer, former chairm=
an of Belco Oil & Gas Corp.; Ronnie Chan Chichung, chairman of Grand Hotel =
Holdings Ltd.; John H. Duncan, former president of Gulf & Western Industrie=
s Inc.; Charles LeMaistre, former chancellor of the University of Texas sys=
tem; and Robert Jaedicke, a former Stanford University accounting professor=
.

Former Directors

     In addition to Skilling, former directors named in the suits include R=
ichard Causey, Enron's chief accounting officer; Enron
General Counsel James Vinson Derrick Jr.; former Enron Vice Chairman J. Cli=
fford Baxter; Joe H. Foy, retired senior partner at
the Bracewell & Patterson law firm; Ken L. Harrison, former chairman of Enr=
on's Portland General Electric Co. unit; and former
Enron Chairman Joseph W. Sutton.
     Federal securities laws say directors may be liable if they fail to re=
sponsibly disclose all information, their behavior widely departs from acce=
pted standards or as ``controlling individuals'' of the corporation.
     Dorgan said in an interview that the transcripts of board meetings tha=
t his committee has obtained demonstrates that
directors ``had some warnings, and probably even considered those warnings =
and must have discarded them.''
     Most state laws hold board members responsible for overseeing a compan=
y and making timely disclosures of information. They also have to offer acc=
urate information in their recommendations to stockholders.
     Hamermesh said that board members would be liable if they intentionall=
y failed to disclose information to stockholders on an
issue up for a vote. ``This doesn't seem to be the case with Enron,'' he sa=
id.

Self-Dealing

     Evidence of self-dealing by directors, taking official actions that be=
nefit them personally, would also be grounds for a successful suit. Board m=
embers also may be legally accountable if they demonstrated bad faith, expe=
rts said.
     Both those tests impose standards of proof that are hard to meet, Elso=
n said. ``It can't just be a bad decision or bad
behavior,'' he said. ``It has to be really, really bad.''
     Still, he said, evidence of conflicts of interest and insider trading =
would aid any claim of self-dealing.
     Eli Gottesdiner, a lawyer for Enron employees who lost their retiremen=
t savings in the company 401(k) stock plan, said board
members would be listed as defendants in his clients' suit.
     ``We believe that there is evidence suggesting that the board aided an=
d abetted others in breaching their fiduciary responsibility,'' he said.

An Easier Case

     Elson said the directors may be able to withstand attack by saying man=
agement misinformed the board. ``Now if management was telling them the sky=
 was red, and they accepted that, it wouldn't work,'' he said.
     That principle may make it easier to win a case against corporate offi=
cers who serve on the board. They ``have much deeper
liability than the outside members because of their information advantage,'=
' Elson said.
     Enron board members have refused to comment on the company's collapse =
and didn't return calls regarding their liability.
     Jaedicke, chairman of the board's audit committee, declined to comment=
 on legal issues. ``I'm sorry. I can't discuss anything,'' he said from his=
 home in Bozeman, Montana.

You can smell the fish sticks from lunch in Sherron Watkins' 60- year-old h=
ouse near downtown Houston, see the framed pictures of the family vacation =
and the baby in bunny ears and even one of her country-crooning second cous=
in, Lyle Lovett. Things have been so hectic, Watkins apologizes, that the C=
hristmas ornaments haven't been put away yet. The daughter of two educators=
, Watkins grew up in nearby Tomball, where she worked the cash register at =
the family grocery store and began saving her money. By 1982, she'd picked =
up two accounting degrees in Austin and quickly found a job with Arthur And=
ersen. She eventually landed a job with Enron, Houston's red-hot energy tra=
ding firm, rising in eight years to vice president for corporate developmen=
t. Her quick ascent surprised no one, says her husband Rick: "She always ha=
d a flair for numbers."=20
That flair led Watkins last summer to conclude there was something rotten a=
t Enron. The numbers didn't add up. A pair of letters that she wrote to Cha=
irman Kenneth Lay exposed top officials--perhaps including Lay himself--who=
 for months had been trying to hide a mountain of debt, and started a chain=
 reaction of events that brought down the company. Watkins' letters, along =
with thousands of other documents, are now in the hands of congressional an=
d criminal investigators who are probing how Enron, its pet-rock auditors a=
t Andersen and a host of other supporting actors allowed the country's seve=
nth largest company to suddenly go bankrupt in December. "I am incredibly n=
ervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting scandals," Watkins wrot=
e of Enron's financial health. "I have heard one manager-level employee fro=
m the principal investments group say, 'I know it would be devastating to a=
ll of us, but I wish we would get caught. We're such a crooked company.'"
Maybe you can only glimpse the soul of a company when it breaks open right =
before your eyes. But we know now, thanks to Watkins, that Enron hid billio=
ns of dollars in debts and operating losses inside private partnerships and=
 dizzyingly complex accounting schemes that were intended to pump up the bu=
zz about the company and support its inflated stock price. We also learned =
last week that executives at Andersen, the accounting giant that enabled En=
ron's every move, fretted about the arrangement but saw the chance to doubl=
e their fees if they just kept their heads down. And now that the party's o=
ver and the damage control is in full swing from Houston to Chicago to Wash=
ington, just about everyone who helped create this mess is busy pointing fi=
ngers, scapegoating the other guys, firing the lower- downs and diming out =
the higher-ups. Last week what was once envisioned as a new kind of company=
 resembled little more than a circular firing squad of executives, accounta=
nts, consultants and lawyers, all fighting to stay in business or, at least=
, out of jail.=20
As these characters tell their self-serving stories, the fall of Enron is t=
he most revealing sort of failure. It is a failure of the old-fashioned ide=
a that auditors, directors and stock analysts are supposed to put the inter=
ests of shareholders above their own thirst for fees. It is a failure of go=
vernment: having greased nearly every campaigner's palm in Washington, Enro=
n worked overtime to keep the regulators from looking too closely at a bala=
nce sheet gone bad. And it is a failure of character, especially inside Enr=
on, where managers who knew something was badly wrong did not say anything =
publicly until the subpoenas began to arrive.=20
About the only thing that didn't fail was Sherron Watkins' flair for number=
s. In the sad tale of Enron's collapse, Watkins is the closest thing to a h=
ero in sight. When she goes out for coffee, strangers stop to give her "att=
agirls" and ask for her autograph. She still goes to work each day at the c=
ompany's headquarters in downtown Houston, where the tilted logo out front =
has yielded Enron a new nickname: the Crooked E.=20
Normally when public companies flame out in scandal, top executives can be =
seen running from headquarters mumbling that they are shocked to learn that=
 there was gambling going on in the casino. But there's not much of that he=
re. Enron and Andersen officials hardly deny the dubious deals, the 881 off=
shore tax havens or the stupid accounting tricks. That's partly because nob=
ody can be sure that those dodges were inherently illegal. Many companies m=
aintain similar arrangements, usually intended to avoid taxes--a benefit of=
 interest to Enron too. Enron avoided paying federal income tax for four ou=
t of the last five years and instead received millions of dollars in federa=
l-tax refunds.=20
For now, the House Energy and Commerce Committee and federal agents probing=
 Enron's fall are skipping over the accounting schemes and other questionab=
le business practices--including a bizarre sex angle: a scheme to offer por=
nography via the Internet. The investigators instead have zeroed in on what=
 officials from Enron and Andersen did and did not do once they realized th=
at the debts were mounting, that the stock price was falling and that the l=
ast people to learn of the looming reckoning were going to be millions of E=
nron shareholders. Watkins' two letters provide the road map for their inqu=
iry.=20
It took Watkins weeks to work up the nerve to write her first letter to Lay=
. She had been working for chief financial officer Andrew Fastow last summe=
r, looking for assets to sell as Enron ran into financial trouble while tra=
nsforming itself into a company that traded energy, water, weather derivati=
ves and anything else it could turn into a commodity. Watkins wanted to hel=
p, but everywhere she looked she ran into off-the-books arrangements that n=
o one could explain or seemed to want to investigate. She knew that others =
who had pressed then CEO Jeffrey Skilling about the investments had run int=
o trouble. One of her friends, then company treasurer Jeff McMahon, had bee=
n transferred when he "complained mightily" to Skilling about the "veil of =
secrecy" surrounding the outside deals.=20
Watkins learned Enron was losing money on two equity investments: network-e=
quipment supplier Avici lost 98% of its value, and another, New Power, an e=
nergy retailer that had Ken Lay on the board, dropped more than 80%. Becaus=
e both firms were backed by Enron stock, Watkins knew their downfall was dr=
agging down Enron too. None of that was being reflected in the company's pu=
blic filings, as far as she could tell. As her lawyer Philip Hilder explain=
s, "The numbers just didn't add up."=20
Already known as outspoken, Watkins didn't want to approach Skilling direct=
ly for fear of losing her job, Hilder says. "She thought it would be fruitl=
ess while he was there." When Skilling suddenly quit on Aug. 14, Lay called=
 an all-employees meeting two days later and asked for comments from worker=
s beforehand. That's when Watkins finally sat down to write a one-page anon=
ymous letter on her computer at work. She dropped it in the box at headquar=
ters the next day.=20
The letter laid out what many executives knew but no one had the courage to=
 say. Watkins homed in on two sets of transactions called Condor and Raptor=
 (Enron had a penchant for names inspired by Jurassic Park and Star Wars) a=
nd argued that the accounting treatment was unsound, if not dishonest. Enro=
n had booked huge profits from these entities while its stock price soared =
in 2000, despite the fact that neither Condor nor Raptor had any hard asset=
s. But now that Enron's price was dropping, the company had to note these d=
evaluations or pour more money into the companies when cash was short. "It =
sure looks to the layman on the street that we are hiding losses in a relat=
ed company and will compensate that company with Enron stock in the future.=
"=20
But what gave the brief letter its power was its overwhelming sense of doom=
. "Skilling is resigning now for 'personal reasons' but I would think he wa=
sn't having fun, looked down the road and knew this stuff was unfixable and=
 would rather abandon ship now than resign in shame in two years."=20
At the Aug. 16 companywide meeting, Lay invited anyone troubled by Skilling=
's departure to meet with him. Four days later Watkins called a friend at A=
ndersen and asked for advice. On Aug. 21 the friend drafted a memo detailin=
g Watkins' concerns for Andersen auditors on the Enron account. Meanwhile, =
Watkins went to Lay seeking a meeting. The next day she met with the chairm=
an.=20
The session was businesslike, and Lay seemed genuinely concerned. Watkins b=
rought along a six-page letter detailing her worries, and Lay promised to h=
ave a team of lawyers review the controversial deals. But he decided to use=
 Enron's law firm, Vinson & Elkins, despite Watkins' unease about a conflic=
t of interest. Vinson & Elkins had been paid for work on Condor and Raptor =
transactions. But Lay went ahead with the review--whose scope he kept stric=
tly limited.=20
By then, Lay was in the middle of a personal stock sell-off. On Aug. 20 he =
exercised options to buy 25,000 shares at $20.78 a share. The next day he e=
xercised an additional 68,000 shares at $21.56. On both days, the stock clo=
sed around $36, which meant Lay netted nearly $1.5 million before taxes. He=
 continued to be a huge booster for the stock for another month. As late as=
 Sept. 26, Lay would try to reassure Enron employees that "our financial li=
quidity has never been stronger." But as the stock fell last fall, company =
employees were told that they would be unable to move any assets held in En=
ron stock into other securities in their 401(k) plan while the company swit=
ched plan administrators.=20
The end was near. On Oct. 15 Vinson & Elkins issued a nine-page report stat=
ing that Andersen approved of the Condor and Raptor deals and that Enron ha=
d done nothing wrong. On Oct. 16 the company announced a $618 million third=
-quarter loss and a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity. On Oct. 3=
1 the SEC opened a formal inquiry into Enron. Last week, a Vinson & Elkins =
spokesman said the law firm was "not in a position to talk about our engage=
ment with Enron or any other client."=20
Enron too said as little as possible last week as the company tried to reor=
ganize itself and as Lay and other top executives tried to fend off lawsuit=
s filed by angry employees and other investors. The law makes it extremely =
difficult to confiscate the personal assets of corporate officers in punish=
ment for actions on behalf of the company, but if there were ever a chairma=
n who courted that fate, it is Lay. Last week he put three properties in As=
pen up for sale, for $16 million, and huddled with his lawyers in preparati=
on for congressional hearings next month. Few in business have ever fallen =
so far so fast: the man who once could raise Cabinet officials with a singl=
e telephone call and rated the only one-on-one meeting with the Vice Presid=
ent on energy policy last year can't show his face in Houston for fear of r=
eprisals.=20
While Enron suffered in silence last week, Andersen was tripping over its o=
wn attempts at damage control. Andersen has the most to gain by coming clea=
n because if it doesn't, it stands to lose a lot of business. So with help =
from an army of just-hired p.r. agents, the Chicago company worked overtime=
 to show that in its work for Enron, it was merely trying to serve a secret=
ive and aggressive client who was pushing the envelope on accounting rules =
that aren't very clear anyway. Last week, two days after TIME reported that=
 Andersen ordered the destruction of documents in October, the company sent=
 CEO Joe Berardino out in public to strike a contrite tone. Andersen placed=
 three auditors in its Houston office on leave and took out full-page ads i=
n the newspapers promising to "deal with these issues, candidly and directl=
y... Without question, this is the most difficult and challenging episode i=
n our firm's history."=20
And it abruptly fired David Duncan, who managed the Enron account in Housto=
n, saying he had "without any consultation with others in the firm" organiz=
ed the destruction of documents as Enron's losses mounted in October. Seeki=
ng to put as much distance as possible between the home office and a waywar=
d Houston branch, the company pointed out that all shredding had ceased onc=
e the SEC issued a subpoena in the Enron matter. As a former Andersen partn=
er in Chicago told TIME, "The issue of document deletion is entirely depend=
ent on when the organization was aware that there might be a liability issu=
e. Liability begins once there is knowledge."=20
Which explains why things got worse--much worse--for Andersen a few days la=
ter, when it was revealed that officials at the company's headquarters in C=
hicago had discussed the questionable Enron accounting very early in the ga=
me--in a conference call last Feb. 5. Enron was no longer a problem that An=
dersen's Houston office had kept to itself.=20
Nor were the top Andersen officials worrying about the actions of some low-=
level, rogue Enron trader back on Feb. 5. What concerned the auditors that =
morning was how to account for losses piling up in an off-the-books partner=
ship between the company and a firm called LJM. The manager of LJM was none=
 other than Enron's chief financial officer, Fastow. Putting aside the Texa=
s-size conflict of interest for Fastow--whose day job involved vouching for=
 Enron's financial health--Andersen knew that Enron's debts to LJM were ris=
ing to a level that required public disclosure no matter who was in charge.=
 Such a disclosure would have sent Enron's stock into a dive. But no disclo=
sure was made in the company's next quarterly report. Why not? One memo of =
the Feb. 5 conference call noted that Enron "often is creating industries a=
nd markets and transactions for which there are no specific rules."=20
And yet Andersen's understanding of Enron's strange business practices was =
extensive enough that Andersen executives, during the same conference call,=
 contemplated dropping Enron as a client. That would have been a kick in th=
e teeth for the auditing firm: Enron was paying Andersen some $50 million a=
 year in auditing and "consulting" fees--and officials said in the conferen=
ce call that they envisioned billings doubling in the coming years. Ultimat=
ely, Andersen decided to stick with Enron because, according to an e-mail r=
ecord of the call, "we had the appropriate people and processes in place to=
 serve Enron and manage our engagement risks." That engagement ended late l=
ast week when, in a largely symbolic move, Enron fired Andersen instead.=20
In Washington, of course, the politicians weren't just firing Enron and And=
ersen; they were plucking them from their Rolodexes and sending back their =
gifts. Lawmakers of both parties--led by those in close contests this Novem=
ber--scrambled to give back hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign co=
ntributions Enron employees had sprinkled across the political landscape la=
st year. Just for good measure, lawmakers have launched seven separate Enro=
n probes.=20
The Republican White House, which received the vast majority of the Enron m=
oney, struck an unbothered pose, relieved that neither Treasury Secretary P=
aul O'Neill nor Commerce Secretary Don Evans had lifted a finger when Enron=
 came calling for help last fall. Still, the Bush team made one tiny bow to=
 the explosive potential of the Enron scandal, hinting for the first time t=
hat it might fork over the details of Vice President Cheney's closed-door m=
eetings with energy- industry officials last spring if a congressional comm=
ittee requested them. Bush spokesman Dan Bartlett predicted that those pape=
rs, if released, would provide no evidence of a smoking quid pro quo betwee=
n the Administration and Enron. "News flash," dry-quipped Bartlett. "We wan=
t to increase domestic natural-gas production. Tell me what Democrat doesn'=
t."=20
If anyone was having trouble making Enron go away, it was Harvey Pitt, a la=
wyer who represented the Big Five accounting firms before Bush named him to=
 chair the Securities and Exchange Commission last year. Until the Enron sc=
andal broke, Pitt had waved away demands for stronger regulation of corpora=
te accounting and auditing. There were calls from lawmakers for Pitt to rec=
use himself from the SEC probe of Enron, but Pitt refused--after a fashion,=
 anyway--saying that such a step would hurt the agency's standing. He added=
, however, that director of enforcement Stephen Cutler would run the probe =
anyway. Bush last month named two other accounting executives to empty seat=
s on the SEC: Paul Atkins, a partner with Pricewaterhouse Coopers, and Cynt=
hia Glassman of Ernst & Young.=20
These rookies, like Pitt, face a rough season. "There could be other Enron-=
like situations out there," says Arthur Levitt, the activist former SEC cha=
irman. "Financial legerdemain from seduced audit committees, compromised ac=
countants and inadequate standards could certainly crop up again at other U=
.S. companies." At the moment, the public's best protection against that so=
rt of surprise is other brave whistle-blowers like Sherron Watkins.=20

AGGRESSIVE ACCOUNTING By capitalizing its web of complex partnerships with =
its own stock, Enron managed to make losses look like gains=20
THE STRATEGY When Enron wanted to invest in other companies' stocks--a comm=
onplace transaction for large corporations--it could have negotiated a fair=
 price with a competitor to raise capital to make the stock purchases. Inst=
ead, it created thousands of complex partnerships, including two called Con=
dor and Raptor, to allow the transactions to be treated as gains rather tha=
n liabilities on Enron's books. According to Enron vice president Sherron W=
atkins' August memo, here's how these partnerships worked:=20
THE TACTIC In order to sell its own assets at the price it wanted, Enron le=
nt Condor $800 million in Enron stock, which Condor then used to buy the as=
sets. Enron listed the transaction as a cash gain.=20
Enron lent the Raptor partnership more than $550 million in stock so Raptor=
 could invest in entities like the New Power Co. and Avici. Enron listed th=
e Raptor loan as an asset. As guarantor of its own loan, Enron promised to =
issue more stock if Raptor defaulted. The tactic worked as long as stock pr=
ices rose.=20
THE COMPLICATION Instead of rising, Raptor's stock holdings plummeted in va=
lue. Whistle-blower Watkins warned in her memo that to offset Raptor's sign=
ificant losses--Avici's stock dropped 98%, from $178 million to $5 million,=
 and the New Power Co. shares dropped from $40 to $6--Enron would have to i=
ssue even more stock to keep Raptor afloat.=20
THE WRITE-DOWN As of last week, these transactions were not accounted for o=
n Enron's books. What this means is that Enron may have to restate its earn=
ings yet again, posting even bigger losses.=20
Quote: Skilling's abrupt departure will raise suspicions of accounting impr=
oprieties and valuation issues... --Excerpts from the letter Watkins sent t=
o Lay on Aug. 15, 2001 I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wa=
ve of accounting scandals... It sure looks to the layman on the street that=
 we are hiding losses in a related company...

Enron affiliate challenges PUC call for suspension, revocation

Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

AUSTIN (AP) - An Enron Corp. affiliate is challenging the Texas Public Util=
ity Commission's attempt to block it from marketing power as a retail elect=
ric provider.=20
Enron Energy Services had about 11,600 customers, mostly small business cus=
tomers, the PUC staff said in a petition this month.
The PUC claims the company should have its retail electric provider certifi=
cate suspended or revoked because it has failed to meet the minimum level o=
f financial resources.=20
Enron Energy Services relied on the investment credit rating of Enron for i=
ts financial qualifications as a power provider, but Enron lost its investm=
ent grade rating on Nov. 28, the PUC petition said. The company and some of=
 its subsidiaries, including Enron Energy Services, filed for bankruptcy on=
 Dec. 2.=20
In a filing with the PUC last week, an EES attorney said the company has no=
t violated the public utility regulatory act "such that its (retail electri=
c provider) certificate should be suspended or revoked."=20
The filing said that while EES has experienced "material changes in the fin=
ancial and technical conditions" since it was certified as a retail electri=
c provider, it still meets the criteria necessary to retain its certificate=
 to operate in Texas.=20
An attorney for the company did not immediately return telephone calls from=
 The Associated Press.=20
A hearing before PUC commissioners is scheduled for Feb. 27.

Judge to consider lawyers' plan to investigate Arthur Andersen
By KRISTEN HAYS
Associated Press Writer

01/23/2002
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

HOUSTON (AP) - Lawyers for shareholders suing 29 current and former Enron C=
orp. executives and board members added finishing touches Wednesday to a pl=
an intended to bar the fallen energy giant's auditor from any further shred=
ding of documents related to its audits.=20
U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon scheduled an afternoon hearing to consid=
er the plan.
Plaintiffs include Amalgamated Bank, the University of California Regents a=
nd pension funds for Florida, New York City, Georgia, Ohio and other states=
.=20
William Lerach, who represents Amalgamated, said lawyers want Harmon to all=
ow them to inspect Arthur Andersen's Enron-related documents and their stor=
age; eliminate any Andersen policies that would allow shredding of Enron do=
cuments after a certain amount of time; and allow them to take depositions =
from top Andersen personnel.=20
Meanwhile, former Enron employees who lost $1.3 billion in retirement funds=
 when the company collapsed late last year sued the Chicago-based auditor, =
Arthur Andersen LLP, and several current and former Enron executives, alleg=
ing that they violated federal racketeering laws by conspiring to hide Enro=
n's true financial condition.=20
Andersen's acknowledgment two weeks ago that its Houston office had destroy=
ed a significant but undetermined number of Enron-related documents prompte=
d the racketeering lawsuit filed Tuesday in federal court.=20
"That kind of tipped the scale," said Seattle attorney Steve Berman. "Ander=
sen has admitted that it knew of serious accounting issues."=20
Neither Rusty Hardin, a Houston attorney representing Andersen, nor an Ande=
rsen spokesman immediately returned calls for comment Wednesday.=20
Hardin assured Judge Harmon Tuesday that Andersen's Enron-related documents=
 were under guard, and nothing more is being destroyed.=20
Berman also is suing Enron in a separate case on behalf of its employees. T=
hat lawsuit, like many of the more than 60 others filed across the country =
that name Enron as a defendant, is on hold as Enron works to emerge from ba=
nkruptcy. The company filed the largest Chapter 11 reorganization in histor=
y on Dec. 2 in New York.=20
Lerach's lawsuit names individuals rather than Enron Corp. as defendants, s=
o it can proceed despite the bankruptcy. The plaintiffs seek more than $1 b=
illion in proceeds executives and board members made by selling Enron stock=
 from October 1998 through November 2001.=20
Andersen is under a Texas judge's order prohibiting any further shredding o=
f Enron-related documents. Lerach's team wants Harmon to issue a similar or=
der to help them investigate its case.=20
Lerach also wants to take depositions from Enron chairman and chief executi=
ve Kenneth Lay and others regarding Andersen shredding. He said Harmon shou=
ld consider that issue later.=20
On Tuesday, Enron invited the FBI to investigate allegations from a former =
executive that employees shredded their own financial documents from Hallow=
een through as recently as last week. The executive, Maureen Raymond Castan=
eda, said she saw the shredding until she was laid off last week.=20
FBI spokesman Jay Spadafore declined comment on whether agents remained at =
Enron on Wednesday. Spokespeople for Enron and the Justice Department did n=
ot immediately return calls about the FBI investigation.=20
The Rev. Al Sharpton appeared briefly at Enron Wednesday morning, calling f=
or a government bailout of employees left without retirement funds after th=
e company's collapse.=20
"Why can't we bail out people we allow to be victimized?" he asked. "Had th=
ey been more proficient in regulating this, it would not have been such a d=
ebacle."=20

Enron suit cites racketeering charges
By Lisa Sanders, CBS.MarketWatch.com
Last Update: 12:53 PM ET Jan. 23, 2002
HOUSTON (CBS.MW) -- Enron employees are citing alleged violations of racket=
eering laws in a new lawsuit that blames company officers and fired auditor=
 Andersen for employees losing some $1.3 billion in retirement savings.
The litigation marks the first Enron-related class-action lawsuit, among do=
zens, to cite the Racketeering Influences and Corrupt Organizations Act. Ha=
gens Berman, a Seattle-based law firm, filed the suit in U.S. District Cour=
t in Houston on Tuesday.
An Andersen spokesperson did not immediately have a comment. Enron declined=
 to comment.=20
In addition to Andersen, the suit names Ken Lay, Enron's chairman, Jeffrey =
Skilling, Enron's former chief executive, Andrew Fastow, the former chief f=
inancial officer, the Northern Trust Co., and David Duncan, the former Enro=
n audit partner fired by Andersen last week.
The suit charges the parties with conspiring to hide Enron's true financial=
 status by "withholding critical information."
"Now that the facts of Andersen are coming to light, it shows that Andersen=
 was well aware of the accounting problems, and it was so bad that Andersen=
 was destroying documents," attorney Steve Berman said in an interview.=20
"We have a strong basis for suing Andersen for racketeering. There is a spe=
cific provision of RICO, which makes it a crime to embezzle or convert the =
asset of any employee welfare benefit plan, and we're alleging that Anderse=
n engaged in a conspiracy with Enron to do just that."
The suit also claims that Northern Trust and administrators of the Enron sa=
vings plan breached their fiduciary duty to company employees by locking do=
wn the retirement savings plan.
Judge Melinda Harmon, who's overseeing all the Enron-related lawsuits filed=
 in Houston, has scheduled a Feb. 25 hearing to come up with a case managem=
ent plan, Berman said.

Enron Employees Sue Andersen, Claiming Auditor Violated Racketeering Laws

Dow Jones Newswires=20
HOUSTON -- Enron Corp. employees filed suit against Enron officials and the=
 energy trader's auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, alleging violations of feder=
al racketeering laws by illegal manipulation of retirement funds.
Wednesday's action is the latest in a flurry of lawsuits related to the col=
lapse of Enron, but it is the first suit to charge Andersen with violations=
 under the Racketeering Influences and Corrupt Organizations law, known as =
the RICO Act.=20
The law firm Hagens Berman said in a news release that it filed the action =
on behalf of more than 100 named plaintiffs and seeks to represent an estim=
ated 21,000 Enron savings plans participants.=20
The suit claims Andersen and individual Enron officers conspired to hide En=
ron's true financial condition by withholding critical information, causing=
 employees to lose more than $1.3 billion from their retirement funds.=20
It also alleges David Duncan, Andersen's chief Enron auditor, repeatedly ce=
rtified financial statements he knew were false in an attempt to cover debt=
s and losses. Enron Chief Executive Kenneth Lay then knowingly used that fa=
lse information to promote the overvalued Enron stock to employees as "comp=
ensation," to secure their loyalty and to have stock holdings available to =
fend off any hostile takeovers, the suit contends.=20
The 1970 RICO law increases penalties against enterprises that carry out cr=
iminal acts that affect interstate commerce and prohibits any person from u=
sing the assets of an employee pension plan for personal gain.=20
The suit charges that Mr. Lay and several Enron officers violated RICO by c=
onspiring to defraud Enron employees by contributing worthless Enron stock =
to retirement plans as part of what the suit calls a "retirement plan consp=
iracy."=20
The suit also claims wrongdoing by Northern Trust Corp. (NTRS), a trustee o=
f the Enron retirement plan, as well as by retirement plan administrators.=
=20
Representatives from Andersen and Enron weren't immediately available for c=
omment.=20
Enron faces suits from shareholders as well as former employees over billio=
ns of dollars lost in the company's collapse, while the company's Chapter 1=
1 filing promises to be one of the largest and most complex bankruptcy case=
s in U.S. history.=20
In addition, eight congressional committees and three federal agencies are =
investigating various aspects of Enron and its collapse. The Justice Depart=
ment is leading a criminal investigation, the Department of Labor is probin=
g Enron's retirement plan and the Securities and Exchange Commission is loo=
king into the auditing practices of Andersen.=20
Also this week, the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations set =
a hearing for Thursday on alleged shredding of thousands of company documen=
ts by Enron officials.=20
In late-morning trading, shares of Enron (ENRNQ) were down seven cents to 3=
6.5 cents on the over-the-counter Bulletin Board. Enron traded at more than=
 $90 a share a year ago on the New York Stock Exchange; the Big Board delis=
ted the stock earlier this month as a result of Enron's bankruptcy filing.=

On Capitol Hill, Members of Congress Taking Up Where They Left Off; Enron E=
mployees Scheduled Meeting Won't Happen Today
Leon Harris, Jonathan Karl, Ed Lavandera

 Inc.). All Rights Reserved.

On Capitol Hill, members of Congress are taking up pretty much where they l=
eft off a month ago. Enron employees are looking to a scheduled meeting tod=
ay to ease their concerns about the company's future, but that meeting did =
not happen.=20
--excerpts only--
KARL: One big issue up here, perhaps the big issue, aside from the question=
 of the economy, is going to be Enron. The first Enron hearings kickoff tom=
orrow, Leon, one on the Senate side with Senator Joseph Lieberman, one over=
 on the House side with Representative Billy Tauzin, and what's interesting=
 here is that we also heard from Trent Lott who talked about the various --=
 here is Trent Lott, the Republican leader -- here is what Trent Lott had t=
o say.=20
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)=20
SEN. TRENT LOTT (R-MS), MINORITY LEADER: I do think that the Congress has a=
 responsibility to ask questions and inquire about what happened here. Obvi=
ously, there were problems with business transactions. We need to know more=
 about what caused this problem, and why the employees were put in the posi=
tion that they were in, and do we need some sort of a legislation or reform=
 as a result of that?=20
(END VIDEO CLIP)=20
KARL: And Lott and the other Republican leaders in the Senate were also ask=
ed about the controversy regarding Vice President Dick Cheney and the infor=
mation regarding his energy task force. As you know, the Government Account=
ing Office is considering suing the White House to get information about wh=
o was consulting the vice president on the issue of energy policy. The vice=
 president, the White House has said that they do not want to turn that inf=
ormation to the GAO, but Trent Lott asked about this, said that he expects =
in the next few days that we will hear from the vice president, that he wil=
l have more to say on this issue, so that's something we will clearly be wa=
tching for, Leon.=20
HARRIS: Good deal. Thanks, Jon. Jon Karl on Capitol Hill.=20
We've got more on Enron right now, though, from ground zero of Enron. Emplo=
yees of that company are looking to a scheduled meeting today to ease their=
 concerns about the company's future. However, that meeting did not happen.=
=20
CNN's Ed Lavandera is covering Enron development. He joins us now live from=
 Houston. He's got the latest -- Ed.=20
ED LAVANDERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Leon, these company-wide meetings ar=
e not unusual at Enron over the course of the last several months. We repor=
ted about a meeting that happened in August when Ken Lay resumed the power =
as chairman of the company, and another one in September, where Ken Lay rec=
eived a rather terse reception from a lot of the employees, who started ask=
ing some very difficult questions and started expressing publicly their dis=
pleasure with the way the company was going. We had reported last Friday th=
at Enron executives, four Enron executives, were meeting with Enron employe=
es, the ones that are left working inside the budding, to meet at a hotel j=
ust across the street, where they would be able to answer questions of empl=
oyees. Ken Lay, was, we are told by sources, not going to be a part of that=
 meeting, but that four hiring executives were be going to be able to.=20
We obtained an e-mail that was sent out to employees in the last couple of =
hours, that said, "We had planned to hold an all-employee meeting. However,=
 we don't want to subject you to the media frenzy that would certainly surr=
ound such a meeting, so we've decided to postpone it. We are currently maki=
ng arrangements to hold a series of employee meetings within the building t=
o protect your privacy."=20
The e-mail goes onto say, that with all of the issues and the pending litig=
ation in the investigations that are happening right now, it would be very =
difficult for them, if not impossible, to answer some of the more specific =
and of course the more difficult questions that many of these employees sti=
ll have about the direction and future of their company. They say they woul=
d not be able to answer any of those e-mails, and that the meeting would be=
 focusing on the overview of Enron's organizational structure, and they're =
told to expect a memo on that shortly.=20
So a lot of movement here at Enron, and behind me, you might be able to see=
 as well, the Reverend Al Sharpton has just showed up, and he's back there =
talking to reporters as well, and that is the latest from here in Houston.=
=20
Leon, back to you.=20
HARRIS: Thanks, Ed. We will let you go back and listen and see what he has =
to say.=20
Ed Lavandera in Houston, we will check back with you later on.=20

Judge Won't Allow Insurers Immediate Access To Enron Info

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) and its official creditors commi=
ttee asked a federal judge here to stop a class-action proceeding in Housto=
n that seeks to take control of the bankrupt company's financial books and =
records.
"I am very concerned that a court other than this bankruptcy court may deci=
de this matter," said Luc Despins of Milbank Tweed, which represents Enron'=
s creditors committee. "This goes directly to the issue of Your Honor's jur=
isdiction," he told the judge.=20
While having guidelines to preserve documents is important, these guideline=
s should be decided upon in the New York court, according to Despins. Judge=
 Arthur Gonzalez of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of N=
ew York is presiding over Enron's bankruptcy case.=20

In Houston, where Enron is headquartered, a shareholders' class-action laws=
uit led by Amalgamated Bank has been filed, seeking to freeze the proceeds =
of alleged insider trading by 29 Enron executives.=20
As part of these proceedings, some shareholders have filed a motion to prev=
ent Enron and auditor Arthur Andersen from destroying information related t=
o the distressed company's financial condition.=20
Three former Enron employees claimed that the company shredded documents we=
ll after federal investigators started a probe into alleged accounting irre=
gularities.=20
Tuesday afternoon, U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon in Houston postponed =
a ruling on the document-preservation motion.=20
At a bankruptcy court hearing in New York Wednesday, Judge Gonzalez told En=
ron and its creditor committee - both of whom participated in the proceedin=
gs via telephone - that he would talk to Judge Harmon about these parties' =
concerns.=20

Also Wednesday, the bankruptcy court declined to give nine insurers immedia=
te access to Enron's financial information.=20
Continental Casualty Co., National Fire Insurance Co. and others have quest=
ioned whether forward sales contracts guaranteed by $2 billion in Enron-rel=
ated surety bonds ever existed. The insurers believe that opening the bankr=
upt company's books will allow them to make this determination.=20
The insurers also want to know the relationships between J.P. Morgan Chase =
& Co. (JPM), one of Enron's largest lenders, and two Enron-related offshore=
 entities that participated in the forward contracts.=20
J.P. Morgan filed a lawsuit in a New York state court last month, after the=
 insurers declined to pay $1.1 billion owed under the surety bonds, includi=
ng about $965 million to J.P. Morgan. The lawsuit has been moved to the U.S=
. District Court for the Southern District of New York.=20
On Wednesday, Judge Gonzalez told Enron and its insurers that the request f=
or information is likely to be heard in the district court.=20
He delayed a decision on the insurers' motion, and scheduled another hearin=
g for Jan. 25. The judge also asked Enron to provide the insurers with the =
location of relevant documents and the names of witnesses by Feb. 1, in cas=
e this information is needed later.=20

Senate panel asks Enron to authorize public disclosure of tax returns since=
 1985
By CURT ANDERSON
AP Tax Writer

Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

WASHINGTON (AP) - A Senate committee asked Enron Corp. on Wednesday to auth=
orize release of its tax returns to give the public and Congress a "more in=
formed understanding" of the bankrupt energy trader's financial dealings.=
=20
The Senate Finance Committee is in the beginning stages of a probe into Enr=
on's possible use of tax shelters, its creation of more than 800 subsidiari=
es and the impact they may have had on the company's bottom line. The panel=
 is also looking into Enron's pension programs, including its 401(k) plan a=
nd employer stock ownership plan.
In a letter to Enron Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon, Finance Commi=
ttee Chairman Max Baucus, D-Mont., and the panel's senior Republican, Sen. =
Charles Grassley of Iowa, sought company authorization to make public Enron=
 tax records since 1985 - including those of its affiliated companies or pa=
rtnerships.=20
Although the Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee alrea=
dy have access to the tax records, their release to the public is limited d=
ue to privacy laws. This could restrict any hearings or public comments on =
the company's tax situation.=20
"It is critical that the public and the Congress have a more informed under=
standing of the activities and transactions related to Enron's tax returns =
and pension programs," the senators said in their letter.=20
Enron officials did not immediately return a telephone call seeking comment=
. The company and Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm that audited its boo=
ks, are already involved in numerous congressional investigations stemming =
from Enron's rapid financial downfall last year.=20
The Finance Committee has not yet scheduled any hearings, but a spokesman s=
aid they could occur within a matter of weeks. Committee investigators are =
planning to meet this week with the Internal Revenue Service to begin the p=

Enron Asked to Release Its Tax Records Dating Back to 1985
2002-01-23 16:04 (New York)

     Washington, Jan. 23 (Bloomberg) -- The Senate Finance Committee asked =
Enron Corp. to publicly release all tax records for the company, its partne=
rships and affiliated companies.
     Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, and Senator C=
harles Grassley of Iowa, the committee's top Republican, made the request i=
n a letter to Enron Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon. They asked McM=
ahon for permission to release tax information the committee has dating to =
Enron's creation in 1985.
     ``It is critical that the public and the Congress have a more informed=
 understanding of the activities and transactions related to Enron's tax re=
turns and pension programs,'' Baucus and Grassley's letter said.
     The Finance Committee has authority to review tax returns of Enron. Ta=
xpayer confidentiality laws prevent it from releasing that information unle=
ss the company grants permission. An Enron spokesman wasn't immediately ava=
ilable for comment.
     The Finance Committee is investigating Enron pension losses and its us=
e of corporate tax shelters. Release of tax information would provide inves=
tigators and shareholders details about the company's financial health and =
underpinnings of its decline.
     Enron was once the largest U.S. energy trader until it filed for bankr=
uptcy last month. Shareholders and creditors lost $60 billion in the collap=
se of the Houston-based Enron.
     The Senate Finance Committee, which oversees tax policy, is one of at =
least 10 congressional panels examining Enron's bankruptcy. The Senate Bank=
ing Committee today said it will hold a Feb. 26 hearing on accounting failu=
res in cases such as Enron's and proposals to improve oversight. Three form=
er Securities and Exchange Commission chief accountants and the former head=
 of the Financial Accounting Standards Board were asked to testify.
     Senate Banking Committee Chairman Paul Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland,=
 asked the investigative arm of Congress, the General Accounting Office, to=
 examine the numerous earnings restatements by companies such as Enron, Cen=
dant Corp. and Waste Management Inc.
     ``Frequent restatements of earnings go directly to the heart of our fi=
nancial system,'' Sarbanes said in a statement. ``Because by raising questi=
ons about the reliability of published financial statements, they threaten =
to undermine investors' confidence in
the way our securities markets operate.''
     He asked the GAO to examine all earnings restatements between 1997 and=
 2000, their affect on investors and recommendations for reform.
     The Senate Banking Committee previously announced a Feb. 12 hearing at=
 which it would listen to five former SEC chairmen discuss accounting issue=
s.

WASHINGTON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - The Senate Finance Committee on Wednesday so=
ught permission from Enron Corp. to release the collapsed company's tax ret=
urns to the public.=20
"It is critical that the public and the Congress have a more informed under=
standing of the activities and transactions related to Enron's tax returns =
and pension programs," the panel said in a letter to Enron's chief financia=
l officer, Jeffrey McMahon.
The committee said it had the authority under the law to review Enron's con=
solidated tax returns as well as those of its affiliated companies and part=
nerships, and expects to exercise that authority.=20
But it said there were limitations on its ability to release the informatio=
n to the public without Enron's authorization.=20
"Therefore, we request that you please provide the Finance committee writte=
n authorization to release to the public information contained in Enron's f=
ederal consolidated tax returns or any tax information related to Enron's a=
ffiliated companies or partnerships that is not included in the consolidate=
d tax returns," said the letter, from the committee chairman, Montana Democ=
rat Sen. Max Baucus, and the ranking Republican on the panel, Charles Grass=
ley of Iowa.=20
"This would be for all time periods since the creation of Enron in 1985," i=
t added.=20
Last week, the head of a tax watchdog group said Enron had not paid U.S. in=
come taxes in four of five years through 2000, receiving tax refunds close =
to $400 million in the period.=20
Robert McIntyre, director of Citizens for Tax Justice, a labor-backed tax r=
esearch group, said he had analyzed Enron's financial reports for 1996 to 2=

The Senate Finance Committee is one of several panels on Capitol Hill looki=

Andersen CEO won't show=20
January 23, 2002: 2:29 p.m. ET
Fired Andersen auditor David Duncan wants immunity while CEO not subpoenaed=
.=20
NEW YORK (CNN/Money) - Fired Andersen partner David Duncan wants immunity f=
rom prosecution or he will not testify at a Congressional hearing Thursday =
while the firm's CEO Joseph Berardino won't appear at the hearing and will =
send a replacement instead.
Berardino did not receive a subpoena to testify Thursday before the Subcomm=
ittee on Oversight and Investigation. Instead, Andersen executive Dorsey Ba=
skin, who is in charge of Andersen's document retention and disposal policy=
, will appear to explain the policy, Congressman James Greenwood (R-PA), wh=
o heads the subcommittee, told CNNfn.
The change came after the committee negotiated with the accounting firm.
Separately, former Andersen auditor Duncan is relying on his Fifth Amendmen=
t constitutional right to protect himself from self-incrimination as a reas=
on not to testify at the hearing.
"Mr. Duncan will testify on Jan. 24 if the Committee votes to grant him imm=
unity," attorney Robert Giuffra, who is representing Duncan, said in a lett=
er to the Subcommittee.
But Andersen's embattled in-house counsel Nancy Temple will appear at the h=
earing. Temple sent an Oct. 12 memo reminding Andersen's Houston office of =
the firm's document retention policy, which executives claim, caused staff =
to start shredding Enron documents.
Michael Odom, a partner at Andersen's Houston office who has been stripped =
of managerial responsibilities, will also be present. Both Temple and Odom =
have requested subpoenas which provides legal protection from employers whe=
n testifying.
Also Wednesday, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus and Ranking Me=
mber Chuck Grassley asked Enron Corp. Wednesday to publicly disclose all co=
mpany tax records, including those related to Enron's affiliated companies =

Auditor Refuses To Testify In Enron Hearing
Duncan Was Fired By Andersen For Destroying Documents
KPRC Channel 2, Houston
Posted: 11:49 p.m. EST January 22, 2002
Updated: 1:33 p.m. EST January 23, 2002
The former chief auditor at Andersen is refusing to tell a congressional pa=
nel what he knows about the destruction of Enron-related documents.=20
The lawyer for David Duncan, who was fired last week by accounting firm And=
ersen for supervising the shredding of documents related to the troubles of=
 the now-bankrupt energy-trading giant Enron Corp., told the House Commerce=
 Committee that Duncan will rely on his "constitutional right not to testif=
y" unless he's given immunity.=20
Congress can compel witnesses to show up, but it can't force them to answer=
 potentially incriminating questions without granting them immunity from cr=
iminal prosecution.=20
The House committee is holding a hearing Thursday, and Duncan wanted a dela=
y in order to prepare.=20
Andersen officials said last week that Duncan began destroying documents sh=
ortly after learning the government was asking Enron for accounting informa=
tion.=20
Duncan's lawyers say he did nothing wrong -- that he followed the instructi=
ons of an Andersen lawyer in handling documents.=20
Congressional investigators subpoenaed senior officials of Andersen, includ=
ing the Chief Executive Joseph Berardino, Duncan, attorney Nancy Temple and=
 Risk Manager Michael Odom in an effort to force their testimony Thursday.=
=20
Temple and Odom, while expressing willingness to testify, have raised conce=
rns about protecting confidential information relating to the investigation=
. The firm's chief executive had been interviewed over the weekend on telev=
ision.=20
Berardino voluntarily testified at the first congressional hearings on Enro=
n last month, defending Andersen's work for Enron but acknowledging that fi=
nancial reporting practices must change.=20
He said Andersen notified Enron's audit committee on Nov. 2 of "possible il=
legal acts within the company.'' Berardino did not mention the document shr=
edding. More recently, he said executives of the Chicago-based firm didn't =
learn of the destruction until shortly after New Year's.=20
Patrick Dorton, an Andersen spokesman, said, "We have not received a subpoe=
na. We have told the committee that we would testify but the only question =
is when.''=20
News of the planned subpoenas came as FBI agents and federal prosecutors en=
tered Enron's Houston headquarters to investigate allegations that massive =
document destruction took place at the company starting after Thanksgiving =
and continuing until as recently as last week. According to a CNN report, F=
BI placed guards inside the Enron building to prevent any further shredding=
 of documents.=20
The Securities and Exchange Commission started looking into Enron's account=
ing in mid-October, after the company reported a third-quarter loss of more=
 than $600 million. The SEC's inquiry eventually included demands for finan=
cial documents from Enron and Andersen.=20
Enron filed the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history on Dec. 2.=20
New Appointee To SEC
As the controversy swirled, President George W. Bush used his recess appoin=
tment power Tuesday to put an official from another major accounting firm o=
n the SEC, bypassing the Senate approval process. Bush appointed Cynthia A.=
 Glassman, a principal at Ernst and Young, to fill a Republican vacancy on =
the five-member commission a day before Congress convened.=20
Bush also reappointed Isaac Hunt, a Democrat named to the SEC by former Pre=
sident Bill Clinton in 1996. Hunt's term recently expired.=20
The Energy and Commerce panel is one of two committees holding Enron hearin=
gs on Thursday. The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee is calling offici=
als from the SEC, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Commodit=
y Futures Trading Commission to determine whether regulators missed signs o=
f trouble at Enron.=20
In another development Tuesday, Sen. Phil Gramm, one of Congress' biggest r=
ecipients of Enron campaign donations, has decided to remove himself from p=
art of the wide-ranging congressional investigations.=20
Gramm will be absent from hearings focusing on what went wrong at Enron but=
 will take part in more general inquiries into accounting standards, invest=
or protection issues and other matters, spokesman Larry Neal said.=20
In a sprawling inquiry with both financial and political overtones, 11 Hous=
e and Senate committees are investigating the Enron debacle, while the Just=
ice Department and the SEC pursue their own less visible probes.=20
Bush urged Congress on Tuesday not to be distracted by the Enron investigat=
ion.=20
"I'm confident that all the facts will come out on Enron. And I'm also conf=
ident that if Congress has the right attitude, we can get a lot done,'' Bus=
h said in a pitch for his economic revival plan.=20
He said his mother-in-law, Jenna Welch, had lost about $8,000 on an investm=
ent in Enron stock.=20
"A lot of the stockholders didn't know all of the facts, and that's wrong,'=
' Bush said.=20
The president has received large political contributions over the years fro=
m Enron Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Kenneth Lay, who is expected t=
o testify before two congressional committees on Feb. 4.=20
Bush said Tuesday that officials in his administration had done "the exact =
right thing'' in response to Enron's pleas for help as the company was coll=
apsing last year. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Do=
nald Evans have said they received calls from Lay but took no action.=20
Enron Manager Fired For Computer Use
An Enron manager said he deserved to be fired.=20
Clayton Vernon told the New York Times he was fired for posting a message o=
nline that criticized Lay as "the sorriest sack of garbage I have ever been=
 associated with."=20
Vernon was at work when he posted the message using an Enron computer. He s=
aid he knew that violated company policy prohibiting personal use of comput=
ers.=20
In a September in-house online chat, Vernon questioned Lay about the compan=
y's accounting practices. Lay disagreed when Vernon suggested the company w=
as sacrificing its future for the sake of present earnings.=20
Vernon is suing Enron over its business practices.=20

USA: Former Andersen partner seeks to defer testimony.

01/23/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

WASHINGTON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - The former Andersen partner who led the audi=
tor's work at Enron Corp. has advised lawmakers he will not testify at a he=
aring on Thursday unless his testimony is protected from use in court again=
st him.=20
David Duncan was subpoenaed late Tuesday by the House Energy and Commerce i=
nvestigations subcommittee to help shed light on Enron's rapid collapse las=
t year from an energy colossus to the biggest U.S. bankruptcy amid question=
able company bookkeeping.
But a lawyer for Duncan wrote the committee on Wednesday, saying it was pre=
mature to require Duncan to testify "at this hearing at this time."=20
Complaining that Duncan had just, on Tuesday, gotten access to documents fr=
om his own files at Andersen, the letter said Duncan would invoke his const=
itutional Fifth Amendment right not to testify on Jan. 24.=20
However, "Mr Duncan will testify on January 24 if the committee votes to gr=
ant him immunity...," said Robert Giuffra of the law firm Sullivan & Cromwe=
ll.=20
Giuffra said Duncan sought full disclosure of the truth and remained commit=
ted to cooperating with all pending investigations concerning Enron, includ=
ing those in Congress, the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchan=
ge Commission (SEC).=20
Duncan was fired earlier this month by Andersen, which alleged he had order=
ed the destruction of documents once he learned of a request by the SEC for=
 information on Enron's financial reporting.=20
Legal experts have said that immunity offered in exchange for congressional=
 testimony could play havoc with the Justice Department's criminal probe of=
 Enron and Andersen.=20
House Energy and Commerce Committee spokesman Ken Johnson said on Tuesday t=
hat although immunity was one option for witnesses there would be consultat=
ions with the Justice Department before it was offered.

You're On Your Own ; The Enron lesson: in making critical decisions, consum=
ers are at sea. Here is a survival guide

Choice is good. We Americans consider it a measure of our freedom and a sou=
rce of our innovation and prosperity. Riches flow to the person who builds =
a better mousetrap--or computer mouse. Yet a grocery shopper blankly starin=
g at hundreds of varieties of toothpaste might reasonably conclude that the=
re can be too much of a good thing. Mark Lepper, a psychology professor at =
Stanford, and Sheena Iyengar, an associate professor of management at Colum=
bia, illustrated this point with a simple study. In a grocery store, they s=
et up tasting booths that offered either six or 24 types of jam. Shoppers f=
ound the wider selection more enticing: 60% who passed it stopped and taste=
d, while only 40% stopped at the booth with fewer flavors. Yet the wider se=
lection was confounding; just 3% who sampled there bought anything, while 3=
0% made a purchase at the other booth.=20
The tendency to feel overwhelmed and do nothing probably saves us money on =
jam. But it is becoming increasingly dangerous as society hands us more and=
 more responsibility for vital and complex decisions about our savings for =
college and retirement, our family's health care and the providers of utili=
ties ranging from electricity to cellular-phone service. Responsibility is =
always the price of freedom. But we are now responsible for so many decisio=
ns requiring so much homework that many of us feel helpless and paralyzed. =
The risks of inaction or unwise action are rising, even as many of the prof=
essionals on whom we would like to rely for guidance are proving untrustwor=
thy and even corrupt.
Then came Enron. What makes this case so scary is that the shady ethics and=
 the deception that suddenly bankrupted one of the world's most innovative =
companies have become pervasive--and much of it is legal. It's not unreason=
able to fear that the next Enron could be lurking in your 401(k) account or=
 paying your salary. If the corporate directors and auditors and stock anal=
ysts who were supposed to be looking out for the interests of shareholders =
at Enron could be bought off with consulting and underwriting fees, we know=
 they are probably being bought off elsewhere too. From 1998 to 2000, 397 p=
ublicly traded companies had to restate their financial results, and big fi=
rms like Sunbeam and Cendant have paid to settle shareholder suits alleging=
 fraud.=20
The social safety net for the unemployed is not the only thing that the gov=
ernment has loosened. It has also pulled back from the regulation of busine=
ss. That's a direction we have chosen through our own elections, and in man=
y ways it has served us well. But what we didn't anticipate was the degree =
to which lightly regulated companies would be able to corrupt the professio=
nals on whom we have relied to guide us through complex financial and medic=
al matters and to look out for our interests. We now know that we can't tru=
st stock analysts and financial planners, who often get paid more for selli=
ng us shaky stocks and mutual funds than for selling us solid ones.=20
For several months after Sept. 11, Americans have felt ourselves pulling to=
gether. But the Enron scandal has shown us or perhaps reminded us that when=
 money is involved, we are truly on our own.=20
Consider retirement. In 1985 the number of U.S. companies offering guarante=
ed pensions to their workers was 114,000. Only 38,000 did so in 2000. Filli=
ng the gap are 401(k) and other employer-sponsored plans that have introduc=
ed millions of Americans to the benefits of stock investing in the 1990s an=
d created many millionaires, at least on paper. But these savings plans don=
't guarantee anything. Future benefits depend on how wisely we invest--whic=
h looked pretty easy until the market turned south two years ago. Now we ar=
e learning how much we don't know about risk and diversification and how po=
orly equipped most of us are to choose among 8,282 U.S. mutual funds. The y=
earning for reliable advice is so widespread that a Charles Schwab commerci=
al shows a family doctor who makes a house call (remember those?) and winds=
 up giving investment advice. "Wouldn't it be nice," goes the ad slogan, "i=
f the person you trusted most was your financial adviser?"=20
Homeowners, meanwhile, must figure out whether they are better off with a t=
raditional 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, a straight adjustable rate or a 3/1=
 hybrid. Parents must decide whether they should save for college in a Sect=
ion 529 plan (who on earth names these things?) or a Coverdell ESA. We all =
want Marcus Welby for our doctor, but he is not among the options offered b=
y our employer. Instead, we must choose among an HMO, a PPO or a POS. And i=
f we lose our jobs, we must learn to get insurance through COBRA. Read a 4-=
in. pile of paper, and call me in the morning.=20
We are accustomed to having our dinners (not to mention our HMO homework) i=
nterrupted by the peddlers of long-distance phone plans. But now they have =
been joined by folks pushing wireless service and, in more and more communi=
ties, by sellers of competing local phone service. As a result of the dereg=
ulation movement championed by Enron, some Americans must choose among comp=
eting electricity suppliers. If you pick the cheap one, does the power go o=
ut more often? Who knows? And to access the wonders of the high-speed Inter=
net, heads of household must choose among a cable-TV modem, a DSL phone lin=
e and a satellite link.=20
Having such choices should be a blessing. And we would probably see it that=
 way if we could somehow manage to schedule one gnarly piece of homework at=
 a time--or get some reliable help. What's the answer? Some call for more g=
overnment oversight. For now, responding to the anxiety in the air, Republi=
cans have set aside their plans for private investment accounts for Social =
Security. In the long run there is no turning back this age of self-determi=
nism. Sooner or later, your Social Security income will be partly a functio=
n of how well you choose stocks--and in many other areas too your choices w=
ill make or break you.=20
Some cope by focusing their research not on the best investments or health =
plan or broadband provider but on experts to guide them-- preferably friend=
s or colleagues, but failing that, professionals paid in a way that puts th=
em on your side, not serving someone else's agenda. The following articles =
examine three areas in which research is often the most daunting--investing=
, health care and wiring your home--and offer some helpful resources. So do=
 your homework. The choice is yours.

The little guy was let down by all of them--executives, board members, audi=
tors and stock analysts. They all failed to signal trouble at Enron before =
it collapsed, and their negligence (or worse) offers the single broadest ex=
ample of how workers and individual investors have been abandoned by so man=
y of the people they have relied on to look out for their interests in comp=
lex financial matters. Each of these groups of professionals had a conflict=
 of interest--a financial stake in keeping investor dollars flowing into En=
ron stock. And the erstwhile government and industry watchdogs over these p=
rofessionals face similar conflicts at other big companies.=20
As Enron's stock dropped from $80 to under $1 in less than a year, thousand=
s of employees saw their life savings wiped out in the company's 401(k) ret=
irement plan. They weren't the first to suffer that fate. Devastating stock=
 declines have hammered the 401(k) savings of workers at such companies as =
Lucent, Waste Management and Xerox. And other big plans are vulnerable. Coc=
a-Cola, for example, has 81% of its 401(k) assets in Coke stock. The venera=
ble beverage company is no Enron, yet Coke's slumping stock has been pinchi=
ng 401(k) participants for years, sliding 49% from its peak in July 1998. O=
ther firms that have more than 70% of plan assets tied up in company shares=
 include McDonald's, Procter & Gamble and Texas Instruments.
Protecting the $1.8 trillion that 37 million Americans have in 401(k) plans=
 is suddenly a hot issue in Washington. Senators Barbara Boxer of Californi=
a and Jon Corzine of New Jersey propose forbidding plans to invest more tha=
n 20% in any one stock. In an opinion last month, the Labor Department made=
 clear that it won't hold firms liable for third-party advice they make ava=
ilable to 401(k) investors, which could encourage them to offer it, and a b=
ill from Representative John Boehner of Ohio would advance the ball by lega=
lly removing liability for specific asset allocation and other employer- sp=
onsored advice. President Bush ordered "a policy review to protect people's=
 pensions," which is vague but moving in the same direction. Calpers, the b=
ig public-employee pension fund in California, says it will press firms it =
invests in to reform their plans to encourage broad diversification.=20
Michael Sparno, a midlevel manager for Xerox, wishes such reforms had come =
a couple of years sooner. As the shares of his once mighty employer tumbled=
 in price from $60 to $10 in less than two years, his 401(k) account--rough=
ly 30% invested in Xerox stock--took a big hit. "I'm reviewing things now w=
ith a much more hands-on approach," he says. He is contributing less to the=
 401(k) and investing more in real estate and alternative tax-favored accou=
nts like a Roth IRA.=20
Yet Sparno and other 401(k) victims must accept some responsibility for the=
ir troubles. In most plans, the only stock you must hold are shares the com=
pany gives you as a matching contribution. Where retirement-fund disasters =
have occurred, employees have generally been found to own more company stoc=
k than necessary. That was the case at Enron, where management's do-no- wro=
ng hubris filtered down to employees, who rode their 401(k)s to huge paper =
gains between 1998 and 2001. Even as the stock began to slide, many believe=
d it would come back stronger than ever--or were too dumbfounded to sell.=
=20
None of this exonerates Enron management, which hid the depth of the firm's=
 financial problems and talked up the stock while top managers were selling=
 their personal stakes. The rank and file had an additional problem: the 40=
1(k) plan was in a lockdown--assets were frozen during an administrator cha=
nge--for part of the stock's collapse. "Not only are you on your own, but y=
ou have to watch your back," advises Eli Gottesdiener, a Washington attorne=
y who represents 401(k) participants at Enron.=20
What can you do? Start by telling your Congressman and Senators that you su=
pport efforts to lift restrictions on when you can sell company shares that=
 have been given to you and to place limits on how much employer stock can =
be stuffed into a 401(k) or other employer- sponsored plan. But the most im=
portant step is for you to take charge of your retirement account. First, m=
ake sure you're safely in a mix of diversified stock and bond mutual funds =
at all times, in case one of your investments drops suddenly or your plan i=
s locked down for several weeks.=20
Next, hold as little as possible of the stock of your employer, whose fortu=
nes already affect your job security and career advancement. Most big compa=
nies match part of each worker's 401(k) contributions in company stock, whi=
ch can't be shifted into other investments until you reach age 50. As soon =
as you hit that magic birthday, shift those holdings into diversified stock=
 and bond funds. If your employer gives you options to buy company stock, c=
ash them in periodically after the stock has made a strong move higher. You=
'll owe tax. But you can take what's left and diversify. And if you buy sto=
cks outside your 401(k) plan, avoid the shares of companies in the same ind=
ustry as your employer.=20
The Enron scandal has revealed that many auditors and accountants- -at that=
 company and elsewhere--are rubber-stamping stooges of management. It's com=
mon practice for accounting firms to collect consulting fees from companies=
 whose books they audit, often doubling their revenue from one client, as w=
as the case with Arthur Andersen and Enron. Any accountant who raises flags=
 in an audit puts his firm's consulting fees at risk. That's a clear confli=
ct of interest and should be outlawed. Short of that, publicly traded compa=
nies should be required to change auditors every few years. A new auditor w=
ould have a strong incentive to point out, and not get blamed for, any ques=
tionable work by his predecessor. Some have suggested that regulators stop =
requiring annual audits altogether. "An audited financial statement used to=
 mean something," sniffs Ed Cowart, a money manager at Eagle Asset Manageme=
nt. "Things have deteriorated to where auditor comments are meaningless."=
=20
Audits haven't slowed an epidemic of misstated corporate earnings reports. =
>From 1990 to '97, an average of 49 companies a year had to restate their re=
sults. That number jumped to 91, 150 and 156 over the next three years, rep=
orts Financial Executives International, which studies accounting issues. I=
n each case, shareholders were deceived. The firms that restated earnings b=
etween 1997 and 2000 lost a collective $41 billion of market value the week=
 following their announcements. With the problem growing so broad, it might=
 be just as well to skip the independent audits, which have turned into sha=
m endorsements that mislead investors.=20
Until the system is reformed, what can an individual investor do? Watch for=
 independent analysis from agencies like Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Val=
ue Line. Look skeptically on any stock for which accounting issues have bee=
n raised. Tyco International has been the subject of accounting questions f=
or two years, during which the stock has gone nowhere. New questions flared=
 last week, and the stock tumbled 8%.=20
Sarah Teslik, executive director of the Council of Institutional Investors,=
 is worried that for all the clamor in Washington, not much will change. Th=
e Securities and Exchange Commission's proposal to set up an independent ov=
ersight board for the accounting industry is just another form of self-poli=
cing and won't be effective, she says. "Too many people have a real interes=
t in keeping things the way they are," she says, noting that many former la=
wmakers end up as corporate- board members while officials at the SEC are o=
ften accountants themselves or, like SEC chairman Harvey Pitt, former lawye=
rs for accountants.=20
Teslik is especially concerned about corporate-board reform, and would like=
 to see board members held personally liable for gross mismanagement. At a =
minimum, she wants greater disclosure of conflicts of interest. At Enron, f=
or example, directors were partners with management in various side investm=
ents or earned big fees as consultants. Employees and investors should look=
 out for such conflicts. "Almost uniformly, when companies go bad, there is=
 a pattern like this," Teslik says. "The company is trying to buy silence."=
=20
Another way investors can monitor a company is by listening in on analyst c=
onference calls, which are open to the public via the Internet. You will ge=
t a sense of the questions that management is dodging.=20
The conflicts of stock analysts at big brokerage firms have been well aired=
 since the dotcom collapse. Too many serve the investment bankers at their =
firms rather than investors. That was a big problem with Enron. The company=
 floated billions of dollars of debt and spent billions more gobbling up sm=
aller companies--all of it amounting to a fountain of fees for Wall Street =
firms that stayed in the company's good graces. Analysts, who often get pai=
d on the basis of the underwriting business they help secure rather than on=
 good stock picking, were under tremendous pressure not to ask tough questi=
ons and to maintain their buy rating.=20
This subject was probed in Congress last summer, and the brokerage industry=
 has responded with guidelines for ethical behavior. As a result, many firm=
s are disclosing more conflicts. So take a close look at research documents=
 to see whether an analyst has bought or sold any of the stock under review=
 or if the firm is or has been an underwriter of the company's stock or deb=
t. When in doubt, the wise investor should be skeptical about stocks touted=
 by brokers or other representatives of big firms like Merrill Lynch and J.=
P. Morgan Chase. Instead, seek independent information and advice from Stan=
dardandPoors.com, and from good financial websites like Morningstar.com and=
 Fool.com.=20
Financial conflicts are also common among experts who advise us closer to h=
ome. Ask Laura and Barry Marks, who lost their stationery store, Fine Lines=
, in Katonah, N.Y., after their insurance agent told them they couldn't get=
 flood insurance--and they were flooded. "We asked for a complete commercia=
l package to cover any type of inevitability, down to a letter falling off =
of our sign," Barry Marks says. But their insurer didn't offer flood insura=
nce; only Uncle Sam does. That means private insurers have no incentive to =
market it, which is why many agents are misinformed.=20
In recent years, insurance companies have found new ways to shift risk to p=
olicyholders. Fast disappearing is homeowner coverage that guarantees repla=
cement. Among the very largest underwriters, only Chubb still offers this o=
nce common policy. Others shift the risk of miscalculating a home's value t=
o the homeowner. But careful shoppers can still find replacement coverage a=
t smaller firms.=20
Your financial planner may be selling you poorly performing annuities and o=
ther products that earn him a fat commission. One solution: hire a fee-only=
 planner who agrees to be paid by no one but you. Similarly, the real estat=
e agent helping you buy a home may try to rush you into one that's not appr=
opriate just to get a deal done quickly. One solution: hire a buyer's agent=
 who works only for you. In these cases and others, you often have to pay a=
 little more on the front end to save on the back end. And you're wise to i=
nvest time researching the person who will guide you. That way you won't ha=
ve to research every new issue that arises in your financial life.=20

What $6 Million Can Buy

(Copyright 2002)

For argument's sake, let's concede the point that everyone in the White Hou=
se has been at such pains to make: No one in the Bush Administration lifted=
 a finger to save Enron from collapse. But that doesn't mean the $6 million=
 in campaign contributions the company and its executives gave to politicia=
ns over the past 12 years should be written off as a bad investment. For mo=
st of that time, Enron's Washington friends did pretty much whatever the co=
mpany wanted.=20
What Enron wanted most was to be left alone, free of both regulation and sc=
rutiny as it transformed itself from a dowdy natural- gas-pipeline company =
into a freewheeling energy-and-communications giant. In the early 1990s Enr=
on became a new kind of business, selling not just energy but exotic financ=
ial instruments such as energy futures and options. The company moved the h=
eart of its operations from the oil patch to the trading floor--largely fre=
e of regulatory baggage, thanks to allies such as Wendy Gramm. In 1993, as =
chairwoman of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, Gramm helped desi=
gn rules that exempted energy trades from government regulation. That meant=
 Enron could operate an online energy market that, unlike traditional stock=
 and commodity exchanges, did not have to disclose the price, volume or ter=
ms of the contracts it sold. Gramm left government that year and was given =
a lucrative spot on the Enron board. She is the wife of Texas Senator Phil =
Gramm, to whom the company has donated $97,000 since 1989.
There were also times Enron found a little government intervention came in =
handy. When India delayed approval of Enron's $3 billion power plant in Dab=
hol in 1996, Clinton White House counselor Mack McLarty instructed the U.S.=
 ambassador in New Delhi to monitor it and gave regular progress reports to=
 Enron chairman Ken Lay. (Four days before the project received its final O=
.K., Enron gave $100,000 to the Democratic National Committee.) And when En=
ron was trying to sell its interest in the Indian project, the New York Dai=
ly News reported, Vice President Dick Cheney raised the issue in a meeting =
last June with Indian opposition leader Sonia Gandhi. The White House says =
he was acting not at Enron's behest but on the need to protect $640 million=
 in federal money.=20
More often than not, Enron's interests and the agenda of George W. Bush hav=
e been happily congruent. Enron has given Bush more than $700,000 in contri=
butions over the years. Lay was disappointed last year when Bush backed awa=
y from a global-warming plan that would have been good for the natural-gas =
business, but Bush sided with the company in refusing to back price caps on=
 California energy, of which Enron was a major supplier. Larry Lindsey, Bus=
h's top economic adviser and a former Enron consultant, has battled on free=
-market grounds to preserve the kind of overseas tax shelters that hid Enro=
n's true financial condition for so long. And in August Lay's backing helpe=
d put his friend Patrick Wood at the head of the Federal Energy Regulatory =
Commission, replacing a chairman who had opposed Enron's deregulation timet=
able.=20
Enron also found plenty to like in the controversial White House energy pla=
n that Cheney produced last year: open access to electric- utility transmis=
sion lines, more deregulation initiatives and support for Enron's arcane fi=
nancial instruments. "There is no company in the country that stood to gain=
 as much from the White House plan as Enron," wrote California Congressman =
Henry Waxman, a leading Democratic critic, in a letter to Cheney last week.=
 In the recent battle over an economic-stimulus bill, Lay lobbied for--and =
Bush supported--retroactive corporate tax relief. Enron would have been one=
 of many beneficiaries, reaping a $254 million rebate from the government.=
=20
For more than a decade, Enron spent lavishly to untether itself from govern=
ment oversight. But it became so notorious that it gave up any chance of a =
political lifeline. Last fall, when the company was begging for rescue, Bus=
h Administration officials say it was unanimously rebuffed. Enron had hired=
 the best lobbyists-- powerhouses such as Republican chairman Marc Racicot =
and Bush adviser Ed Gillespie, who can usually make things happen--but they=
 too are distancing themselves, saying they were kept in the dark about the=
 depth of the company's problems. For the first time, what Enron needs is m=
ore than money can buy.

The Enron Effect; As the accounting scandal spreads, regulators and politic=

It was like the surgeon general's accepting a public-health award named aft=
er Typhoid Mary. Here was Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan Greenspan, re=
nowned for rectitude, accepting the Enron Award for Distinguished Public Se=
rvice. This wasn't during Enron's glory days, when the company had a stock-=
market value in the tens of billions, but on Nov. 13. That was only a few d=
ays after Enron endured a public disgrace by admitting that it had filed fi=
ve years' worth of misleading financial reports. And it was three weeks aft=
er Greenspan had gotten a call from Enron chairman Kenneth Lay, who despera=
tely wanted Greenspan to intervene with credit-rating agencies to help the =
stricken company survive.=20
The ceremony had its awkward moments. Consider the answer Greenspan gave du=
ring a Q&A session to a student who asked how to succeed in this difficult =
job market. "The best chance you have of making a big success in this world=
," Greenspan said, "is to decide from square one that you're going to do it=
 ethically." Greenspan, through his spokesman, told NEWSWEEK that he hadn't=
 had Lay in mind when he gave that answer, a Freudian slip if there ever wa=
s one. What was Greenspan doing there in the first place? His press aide ex=
plained that he had committed a year earlier to former secretary of State J=
im Baker to accept the honor. The James A. Baker Institute of Public Affair=
s awards the prize, which is funded by Enron. (Baker had once been a consul=
tant to Enron, sponsoring its interests in Kuwait not long after the gulf w=
ar ended. But that's another story.) Greenspan turned down the $15,000 scul=
pture accompanying the prize--imagine that sitting in the Fed's lobby--and =
declined the $10,000 honorarium.
The Greenspan story may be the most startling example of how Enron managed =
to ensnare seemingly everybody and every company worth snaring. Now that we=
're in the all-Enron-all-the-time news cycle, we're getting answers to "Who=
 knew what when?" Revelations from last week: people at Arthur Andersen, En=
ron's outside accountant, were worried about the Enron numbers they were ce=
rtifying, but did nothing. Ken Lay got a prescient letter from a whistle-bl=
ower in August warning that "I am incredibly nervous that we will implode i=
n a wave of accounting scandals," but in September he was still telling emp=
loyees that the stock was "an incredible buy." (It's since fallen to almost=
 nothing.)=20
The focus is now shifting to the next obvious questions: what's being done =
to prevent another Enron? And will anything really change once attention mo=
ves on, as it inevitably will, to the next scandal? Harvey Pitt, the head o=
f the Securities and Exchange Commission, is proposing to set up a new over=
sight body to police the accounting profession. Business heavyweights want =
to beef up corporate-governance rules to force boards to pay more attention=
 to what managers are doing. Politicians are calling for rules to limit the=
 amount of company stock that people can hold in retirement accounts to pro=
tect workers from riches-to-rags stock plunges like the one that's turned s=
ome Enronites from paper millionaires into people having trouble paying foo=
d bills during their golden years.=20
But for all the table-pounding calls for change now, urgency has a tendency=
 to dissipate. There have been plenty of accounting scandals before--Sunbea=
m, Cendant, Waste Management, to name some recent fiascoes--but nothing see=
ms to have changed all that much in response to them. Corporate America and=
 the accounting profession have a remarkable ability to frustrate fundament=
al reform. Shortly before he came to the SEC, chairman Pitt, representing A=
rthur Andersen as his client, fought fiercely against tougher regulation of=
 accountants. His current proposal is far milder than the reforms he helped=
 defeat not long ago. Those would have made accountants accountable to fede=
ral regulators, not to a self-policing body, as Pitt proposes. And Sen. Jos=
eph Lieberman, who's holding hearings and demanding post-Enron reforms, led=
 the assault on the Financial Accounting Standards Board when it tried to c=
lose the most glaring loophole in the accounting system: letting companies =
hand out millions or billions of dollars' worth of stock options to employe=
es, but not counting that cost as a charge against profits.=20
While politicians and theoreticians struggle with the idea of reform, real =
and immediate solutions to particular problems tend to come from people lik=
e Enron whistle-blower Sherron Smith Watkins, who warned Lay about accounti=
ng problems. Watkins, 42, who recently became a mother for the first time, =
has a highly developed moral sense and was incredibly courageous. But even =
having the right person in the right place blowing the whistle about the ri=
ght thing won't change a place like Enron that didn't want to change.=20
As we now know, thanks to subpoenaed documents that have become public, Wat=
kins warned Ken Lay last August that the company had inflated its reported =
profits with suspect accounting. Watkins, besieged by interview requests, w=
ouldn't talk to us. But we can reconstruct her story with now public docume=
nts and with information from her lawyer, Phillip Hilder of Houston. Like m=
any of her fellow employees, Watkins, an Enron vice president, was worried =
on Aug. 14 when Enron's chief executive and resident numbers whiz, Jeffrey =
Skilling, abruptly resigned. Watkins, who has a master's degree in accounti=
ng and is a CPA, got a company-wide invitation Lay sent everyone to a meeti=
ng at the Houston Hyatt Regency on Aug. 16. The message also urged employee=
s to send him letters, anonymously if necessary, if they thought there was =
something he should know. Watkins dropped off an anonymous one-page letter =
before the meeting. Lay's speech inspired her. So she wrote a detailed six-=
page letter and gave it to Lay after meeting with him on Aug. 22. It's not =
clear how much Lay knew about Enron's financial shenanigans at the time--al=
though ignorance is no excuse for the chief executive officer.=20
"Ken Lay was professional and concerned, and he promised to investigate," l=
awyer Hilder said, adding that "the company has treated her in a profession=
al manner, and she is still employed there."=20
But what effect did her note have? Not much. As we see from other internal =
documents that have become public, Watkins's letter was turned over to Enro=
n's outside law firm, Vinson & Elkins, which investigated the charges. The =
firm dispatched a nine-page letter to Enron saying that Watkins's concerns =
did not, "in our judgment, warrant a further widespread investigation by in=
dependent counsel and auditors." The V&E letter hedged, though, by warning =
of public-relations and legal dangers if some of the deals Watkins warned a=
bout became public.=20
The V&E letter was dated Oct. 15. The very next day, Enron revealed that it=
 had lost more than $600 million in the third quarter. That touched off the=
 very meltdown that Watkins had feared.=20
Meanwhile, it turns out, Watkins had aired her concerns with a former Ander=
sen colleague at the Houston office, and asked him for a financial-sanity c=
heck before delivering her letter to Lay. (We know this from an internal An=
dersen memo that's become public.) But no one seems to have done more than =
to create a paper trail that showed their concern. Meanwhile, yet another d=
isclosed document shows that earlier last year, some Andersenians were cons=
idering having the firm drop Enron as a client because Enron's aggressive a=
ccounting was making them nervous. But Andersen kept the account, which bro=
ught in $52 million in 2000 and had the potential to rise much further, tha=
nks to Enron's voracious appetite for consulting services.=20
Andersen is under intense pressure for having certified Enron's bogus numbe=
rs. It's also being investigated for shredding Enron documents. And it fire=
d the head partner on the Enron account two days after he talked to federal=
 investigators. It sure looks like Enron and Andersen--each of which claims=
 to have fired the other--are trying to stick each other with the blame.=20
But even as one part of the federal government is investigating criminal ch=
arges against Andersen for document-shredding, among other things, the FBI =
is relying on Andersen's information-systems expertise. Last summer Anderse=
n undertook the job of reforming the FBI's record-keeping. That was after t=
he FBI admitted losing thousands of documents in the Timothy McVeigh case, =
which briefly delayed his execution. "This study, by a firm of Andersen's c=
aliber, will provide valuable information to enhance the institutional inte=
grity and performance of the FBI," Attorney General John Ashcroft said. And=
ersen's report is due soon.=20
The key to the Enron mess is that the company was allowed to give misleadin=
g financial information to the world for years. Those fictional figures, sh=
owing nicely rising profits, enabled Enron to become the nation's seventh l=
argest company, with $100 billion of annual revenues. Once accurate numbers=
 started coming out in October, thanks to pressure from stockholders, lende=
rs and the previously quiescent SEC, Enron was bankrupt in six weeks. The b=
ottom line: we have to change the rules to make companies deathly afraid of=
 producing dishonest numbers, and we have to make accountants mortally afra=
id of certifying them. Anything else is window dressing.=20

The Great Giveback; Enron's turned a capital pastime upside down: the Beltw=
ay's racing to give away, not pocket, the giant's cash
By Howard Fineman With Eleanor Clift in Washington

The Jefferson is a tiny little hotel, with antiques in the lobby and pillow=
ed nooks in the bar. It's a venue for one of Washington's favorite sports: =
giving and getting campaign contributions. But last Friday Sen. Joe Lieberm=
an and his advisers met there for the opposite reason: to discuss whether h=
e should donate to charity the $13,500 he'd received over the years from En=
ron and its estranged accounting firm, Arthur Andersen. A star Democrat wit=
h his eye on the White House, Lieberman this week launches hearings on the =
Enron collapse and on the Bush crowd's ties to the company. Now the senator=
 is the target of the Republicans' one-word war cry: hypocrisy. "At one lev=
el, giving the money back would be a kind of showboating," he told NEWSWEEK=
. "On the other hand, it might be worth it to eliminate any question of a c=
onflict of interest."=20
Suddenly, giving away is all the rage, and it's not a matter of charity but=
 political survival. Post-Enron Washington is like post-Taliban Kabul: Ever=
yone is shocked, shocked at what was going on in the capital until the tank=
s rolled in, and now everyone is frantically shaving his donor lists. Senat=
ors who are pledging to give away donations--usually to Enron employee vict=
ims' funds--include Kay Bailey Hutchison, Chuck Schumer, Hillary Rodham Cli=
nton and John McCain. Their aim is to buy back the privilege of moral indig=
nation. "No bones about it," McCain told NEWSWEEK. "I'm tainted by it, too.=
"
There was no mea culpa or return-to-sender from President George W. Bush. H=
is aides insisted that they had neither been tainted nor guided by Enron, a=
nd there was no evidence that they had done anything illegal or even unseem=
ly. Still, White House insiders behaved like people with something to hide,=
 and the story was less about the substance of the contacts than their bela=
ted, grudging disclosure to the press.=20
The list was a lengthening one. On Jan. 11, a top administration aide denie=
d that Commerce Secretary Don Evans had told White House officials about En=
ron's shaky finances in October. In fact, Evans admitted Jan. 13, he had to=
ld chief of staff Andy Card. Last week it emerged that economic adviser Lar=
ry Lindsey, formerly a $50,000-a-year consultant to Enron, had conducted a =
study of the company's weak condition. Vice President Dick Cheney acknowled=
ged that he'd touted the cause of an Enron power-plant project supported by=
 Team Bush. Even so, the White House refused to release records of the Chen=
ey Energy Task Force, while insisting it contained no favors for Enron.=20
The White House remained secure in the knowledge that Enron had tried to li=
ne all pockets, not just those in Bush's trousers. Indeed, new evidence eme=
rged daily of the company's almost manic attempts at influence acquisition-=
-from its support of the Houston Olympic Committee to a $50,000 payment to =
Paul Krugman, The New York Times's economic columnist, who disclosed that h=
e'd been paid to serve on an Enron advisory board. Last summer, NEWSWEEK ha=
s learned, Enron paid one of Al Gore's closest allies, fund-raiser Johnny H=
ayes, to lobby Democratic National Committee Chair Terry McAuliffe. The aim=
: to indirectly pressure California Gov. Gray Davis into backing off his at=
tacks on Enron and other out-of-state energy companies. McAuliffe told Haye=
s to get lost. Enron later forked over $100,000 anyway--an apparent attempt=
 to show ties to both parties.=20
Democrats hoped to gain some traction for attacks on the GOP. "This will re=
mind people of where the Republicans' loyalties lie," said poll taker Harri=
son Hickman. Still, not all Democrats seemed eager to lead the charge (the =
most active Hill investigator seemed to be GOP Rep. Billy Tauzin). The real=
 beneficiaries--if any--may only be those who can claim the title of "outsi=
der."=20
The first step toward that sainted status, McCain argues, is to accept the =
Enron mess as proof of the need for campaign-finance reform. His allies in =
the House are two votes short of the 218 they need to force a vote. McCain =
recorded phone-bank calls aimed at swing districts, and his aides recently =
asked Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura to call two "undecideds" in the state. "=
Failure to pass this now will further lower respect for the two-party syste=
m," said McCain, who flirts with running for president as an independent. "=
We're piano players in the House of ill repute." The music may have stopped=
 for Enron, but the band is still playing in town.=20

The Last Word
'Events, Dear Boy, Events'; Enron is not--yet--much of a political scandal,=
 but has many facets awkward for Republicans
By George F. Will

When Harold Macmillan became Britain's prime minister, he was asked what wo=
uld determine his government's course. He replied with Edwardian languor: "=
Events, dear boy, events." As he well knew. An event--the 1956 Suez debacle=
--had catapulted him into 10 Downing Street. An event--the sex-and-spies Pr=
ofumo scandal--would grease the skids under him in 1963.=20
Pesky things, events. As usual, they are in the saddle, riding mankind. The=
y will shape this election year. The first shaping event has happened, in H=
ouston.
Enron's sudden collapse from overdoses of arrogance and villainy has become=
 the second most significant event--second only to September 11--since Geor=
ge W. Bush became president. It is just the sort of event that Republicans =
do not want to raise the curtain on in an election year. It is not like the=
 Credit Mobilier scandal (corrupt contracting in the construction of the Un=
ion Pacific Railroad, 1865-69) or the Teapot Dome scandal (fraudulent leasi=
ng of federal oil reserves), both of which involved malfeasance by people i=
n Washington. Enron is, in a way, worse.=20
Enron is a systemic failure, implicating the range of institutions, from ac=
counting firms to boards of directors, that are designed to justify broad p=
ublic confidence in the functioning of what is supposed to be a mature capi=
talist system--confidence that is increasingly indispensable, given the rap=
idly broadening demographics of stock ownership. (For example, in 1980 less=
 than 6 percent of Americans participated in mutual funds; today more than =
half do.) As an economic scandal--a scandal of behavior in the private sect=
or--it may be the worst in American history. But even though the Enron stor=
y is--so far--not much of a scandal involving the political class, it is ri=
ch in elements potentially awkward for Republicans.=20
It involves Texas. (Anti-Texan stereotyping is a kind of "profiling" that m=
any liberals approve.) It involves a (formerly) big corporation. It involve=
s the fifth (Arthur Andersen) and 12th (Enron) largest givers to the Bush c=
ampaign. It suggests an insufficiency of government regulation relative to =
the quantity of private-sector vice.=20
Enron's prosperity was a bubble produced by trickery and pricked by reality=
. Bush's stratospheric approval ratings, being the result of solid performa=
nce, will not suddenly collapse, but cannot continue. And judging by the th=
umping Republican losses in the two important elections in 2001--they lost =
the New Jersey and Virginia governorships by 14 and 5 points, respectively-=
-his popularity is not transferable. Granted, he did not campaign in either=
 state. But the reason he did not--the war--may inhibit his political campa=
igning this year.=20
In 2000, for the first time since 1952, Democrats failed to win either the =
White House, the House or the Senate. They now control the Senate. Can they=
 capture the House this November?=20
Democrats have gained seats in three consecutive elections. Their three-sea=
t gain in 1996 was not surprising: there was bound to be a corrective rebou=
nd from the 1994 cymbal-crash elections in which Democrats lost 53 seats, e=
nding 40 years of Democratic control of the House. Besides, it was a presid=
ential election year in which the Democratic incumbent coasted to a comfort=
able victory. The continuing rebound from 1994 also helps explain why Democ=
rats gained four seats in 1998--just the second time in 34 elections since =
the Civil War that the party holding the presidency gained House seats in m=
idterm elections. In 2000, Democrats gained one seat.=20
If Democrats gain seats in a fourth consecutive election, it will be only t=
he fourth time a party has done that in the 69 elections since the Civil Wa=
r. (Not since the Depression. Democrats gained in 1906, 1908, 1910 and 1912=
. Republicans gained in 1914, 1916, 1918 and 1920. Democrats gained in 1930=
, 1932, 1934 and 1936.) How likely are they to gain the six seats needed to=
 produce Speaker Dick Gephardt in 2003?=20
Charles Cook, one of the most acute political analysts, notes that Republic=
ans cannot count on benefiting from an impulse to rally around the commande=
r in chief's party during a midterm election. In the only such election dur=
ing World War I (1918, six days before the armistice), President Wilson's D=
emocratic Party lost six Senate seats and 19 House seats--and control of bo=
th houses. In the midterm election during World War II, in 1942, FDR's Demo=
crats lost 45 seats. In the two midterm elections after the escalation in V=
ietnam and before the negotiated de-escalation, Johnson's Democrats lost 47=
 seats in 1966 and Nixon's Republicans lost 12 in 1970.=20
In 1992, the first election after the last redistricting, there was tremend=
ous churning of the House membership: 65 representatives retired and 43 wer=
e defeated. But in 1992 the national mood regarding Congress was unusually =
dyspeptic--remember that year's scandal surrounding members' overdrafts fro=
m the House bank--and the term-limits movement was rapidly gaining strength=
. This year, only 24 House members (16 Republicans, eight Democrats) are re=
tiring, some from politics, others to run for senator or governor.=20
This year, redistricting, by both parties in the states they control, has b=
een, even more than usual, devoted to protecting incumbents. In most cases =
that has meant making safe seats even safer. As a result, says Cook, the nu=
mber of even potentially competitive races in 2002 has shrunk "enormously,"=
 to perhaps 50, of which perhaps only 24--a dozen now held by each party--w=
ill be hotly contested. Perhaps none of California's 53 races will be reall=
y competitive. So for Democrats to gain the six seats necessary for control=
 of the House, "they must win 18 of the 24 closest races, a 75 percent vict=
ory percentage." Cook notes that six is a small number out of 435, but 75 i=
s a very high percentage.=20
Election Day is more than twice as distant from today as September 11 is. W=
hich means there is ample time for the political climate to be conditioned =
by the unexpected. Remember the rule: There are knowns, unknowns and unknow=
n unknowns. The last include events, dear reader, events.=20

Judicial nominee to face questions about Enron contributions

DALLAS (AP) - A federal judicial nominee who wrote a ruling favorable to En=
ron Corp. after taking campaign money from the now-bankrupt energy trader w=
ill get close scrutiny, Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy said.=20
Texas Supreme Court Justice Priscilla Owen wrote a unanimous ruling that sa=
ved Enron $225,000 in taxes, two years after taking $8,600 in campaign cont=
ributions from the company, according to the watchdog group Texans for Publ=
ic Justice.
President Bush has tapped Owen to become a member of the 5th U.S. Circuit C=
ourt of Appeals in New Orleans. She has been awaiting Senate confirmation.=
=20
"The Senate will look at Justice Owen's Enron rulings as part of her overal=
l record," Leahy told The Dallas Morning News in Wednesday's editions.=20
"She has a right to take contributions, but any judge - liberal or conserva=
tive - faces the legitimate question about whether a contribution influence=
d their thinking," said Leahy, a Democrat.=20
Owen, a Republican, was the author of a unanimous Texas Supreme Court opini=
on in 1996 that settled a tax issue in Enron's favor. The opinion rejected =
the Spring Independent School District's argument that the Enron natural ga=
s inventory should be assessed at a value $15 million higher than stated by=
 the company.=20
That decision spared Enron $225,000 in taxes. It came two years after Owen =
accepted $8,600 in Enron contributions, according to Texans for Public Just=
ice. The nonprofit group tracks campaign spending.=20
Owen has not fielded questions regarding the Enron contribution or her judi=

Congress's Enron Hearings May Open Way to New Laws
2002-01-23 16:53 (New York)

     Washington, Jan. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Two congressional committees open h=
earings tomorrow into the collapse of Enron Corp. that may pave the way for=
 new rules affecting investors, accountants and energy traders.
     The House Energy and Commerce Committee and the Senate Government Affa=
irs Committee are the first among at least 10 congressional panels to exami=
ne what led to the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history. The probes will incl=
ude testimony on the destruction of documents at Enron and its auditor, Art=
hur Andersen LLP, and the role of executives, accountants, financial analys=
ts and regulators in the company's demise.
     ``It will begin to lay the groundwork,'' said Robert Litan, director o=
f economic studies at the Brookings Institution. ``In order for legislation=
 to move forward, there has to be a case made that a fix is needed.''
     Houston-based Enron's bankruptcy on Dec. 2 wiped out $26 billion in ma=
rket value and cost the jobs of thousands of Enron employees, who also lost=
 about $850 million in their company- sponsored pension plans. The hearings=
 are a response to demands by lawmakers and shareholders to find out how th=
at happened.

Washington Sentiment

     President George W. Bush, who got financial backing for his political =
campaigns from Enron Chief Executive Kenneth Lay, expressed the mood preced=
ing the hearings yesterday.
     ``What I'm outraged about is that shareholders and employees didn't kn=
ow all the facts about Enron,'' Bush said in disclosing that his mother-in-=
law, Jenna Welch, lost about $8,100 on her purchase of Enron stock.
     There were similar comments from members of Congress.
     ``What is abundantly apparent is that Enron rather outrageously hid tr=
ansactions of hundreds of millions of dollars,'' said Rep. James Greenwood,=
 the Pennsylvania Republican who is chairman of the House subcommittee hold=
ing tomorrow's hearing. ``They did it to make their profits look rosier.''
     Among those the panel wants to hear from tomorrow are Andersen Chief E=
xecutive Joseph Berardino and former Andersen partner David Duncan, who was=
 fired by the company over the destruction of documents relating to its aud=
it of Enron.
     Berardino wants to send an Andersen auditing expert to testify in his =
place. Duncan's lawyer, Robert Giuffra Jr., said his client will invoke his=
 Fifth Amendment right not to answer the committee's questions unless he's =
granted immunity from prosecution.

Potential Evidence

     Committee Chairman Billy Tauzin, a Republican from Louisiana, said the=
 panel won't grant immunity without approval from the Justice Department, w=
hich is conducting a criminal investigation into the matter.
     Nancy Temple, an Andersen attorney whose memo on document destruction =
policies is at the center of one aspect of the investigation, and Mike Odom=
, the risk assessment officer for Andersen's Houston office, have agreed to=
 testify.
     Greenwood said his investigation initially would focus on Andersen to =
find out how much potential evidence was destroyed by the auditor between S=
eptember and November. Andersen admitted to purging the documents, mostly e=
-mails to and from Andersen executives.
     Duncan told investigators last week that when he destroyed the files h=
e was following the direction of an Oct. 12 memo from Temple on Andersen's =
document policy. The memo, which the committee released, included a note fr=
om Temple to Odom, whom investigators interviewed on Friday. Andersen has r=
elieved Odom and three other Houston-based partners of management responsib=
ilities.

Enron's Documents

     The shredding wasn't confined to Andersen. A former Enron executive to=
ld ABC News on Monday that she witnessed documents being destroyed as recen=
tly as two weeks ago, in defiance of the company's order in October to pres=
erve documents.
     ``The allegations of continued shredding of documents is a very seriou=
s matter and raises additional questions of obstruction of justice,'' said =
Rep. John Dingell, the senior Democrat on the commerce committee.
     Lawmakers have offered a few specific proposals and broad outlines of =
possible changes to laws and regulations. Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschl=
e, a South Dakota Democrat, said one outcome of Enron hearings will be legi=
slation to keep accounting firms from acting as consultants to the companie=
s they audit.
     Andersen had such an arrangement with Enron. The firm has said it earn=
ed $52 million in fees from Enron last year, of which $27 million came from=
 non-audit work.

Changing the Law

     ``My personal view is that we ought not to allow a combination of cons=
ulting and accounting,'' Daschle said.
     Democratic Senators Christopher Dodd of Connecticut and Jon Corzine of=
 New Jersey say they will introduce a bill that would prohibit such relatio=
nships.
     The House commerce committee plans hearings next week on conflicts of =
interest between auditors and their clients, proposals to change accounting=
 rules and the workings of the energy trading market. Shareholders have acc=
used Enron, which at one point handled a quarter of the trading in natural =
gas and electricity, of hiding its liabilities in trades.
     Lawmakers also will question Wall Street analysts who kept ``strong bu=
y'' ratings on Enron until the company publicly disclosed the extent of its=
 troubles in November.
     Senator Joe Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat who is chairman of the S=
enate Government Affairs panel, said he intends a months- long inquiry into=
 Enron starting with a look at how accountants, financial analysts and regu=
lators failed to issue warnings or prevent Enron's failure.

`Legislative Fix'

     Among those who'll be testifying are former Securities and Exchange Co=
mmission Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. He has said he will tell the committee =
to support legislation to give the SEC more control over U.S. accounting st=
andards.
     ``The power to change it could come from the Congress, it could come f=
rom the SEC with a rulemaking, but I think this one calls for a legislative=
 fix,'' Levitt said last week.
     The committee also is examining the regulatory authority of the Federa=
l Energy Regulatory Commission and the Commodities Futures Trading Commissi=
on that governed Enron's energy production and trading businesses.
     The Senate committee will examine whether tighter regulations for trad=
itional pension plans should be applied to 401(K) retirement funds.

State GOP sends $15,000 Enron contribution to employees' fund
By MARC HUMBERT
AP Political Writer

ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - New York's Republican State Committee has donated a $15=
,000 contribution from the Enron Corp. to a Houston-based fund created to a=
id employees of the failed energy giant, a party official said Wednesday.=
=20
"We thought it was the right thing to do - to stand by the families," said =
Patrick McCarthy, the state party's executive director, of the Enron donati=
on the state party had received on Oct. 12.
The state GOP's contribution last week to the Enron employees' fund was fir=
st reported Wednesday by the New York Post.=20
Also, an aide to Democratic candidate for governor Andrew Cuomo said Wednes=
day that the former federal housing secretary had donated a $1,000 Enron co=
ntribution to the employees' fund last week. He had received it on June 21.=
=20
Campaign financial filings with the state Board of Elections also show that=
 state Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, a Rensselaer County Republican,=
 received $1,000 from Enron in 1999 and that state Sen. James Wright, a Wat=
ertown Republican, got a $1,000 donation from the company in March of last =
year. Aides to both senators said Wednesday that those contributions would =
be donated to the employees' fund.=20
The political action committee of the Independent Power Producers of New Yo=
rk received a $2,000 Enron donation in May of last year, the records show.=
=20
Gavin Donohue, the IPP's executive director, said he would recommend to the=
 group's board of directors next week that the money be donated to the fund=
. He said he expected the board to agree.=20
"It is the right thing to do, and the right time to do it," Donohue said.=
=20
New York politicians have been joining others from across the country sendi=
ng donations from Enron or its top executives and their relatives to the em=
ployees' fund in recent days. Thousands of Enron employees were laid off in=
 the wake of the company's collapse last month.=20
Last week, Republican Gov. George Pataki donated to the fund an Aug. 1, $5,=
000 contribution from the wife of Enron chief Kenneth Lay. Pataki spokesman=
 Michael McKeon said Wednesday that the governor had also sent a $1,000 con=
tribution to the fund last week that his campaign committee had received fr=
om Enron in April of 2000.=20
Also last week, New York's two Democratic U.S. senators, Charles Schumer an=
d Hillary Rodham Clinton, sent $68,857 and $7,950, respectively, to the fun=
d stemming from Enron-connected donations they had received.=20
Cuomo's main rival for the Democratic nomination for governor, state Comptr=
oller H. Carl McCall, has not received any recent Enron-related contributio=
ns. The state's more than $112 billion public pension fund, of which McCall=
 is sole trustee, did lose about $58 million in the Enron collapse. That is=
 much less than Enron losses suffered by some other major state public pens=
ion funds.

OUSTON TEXAS, Lou Dobbs.=20
LOU DOBBS, CNNfn ANCHOR, LOU DOBBS MONEYLINE: Good evening everyone.=20
I`m sitting in front of Enron`s headquarters in Houston, Texas. Tonight thi=
s company`s troubles are continuing to mount. The FBI today entered the Enr=
on building, looking into charges that Enron employees have been shredding =
documents related to the phenomenal collapse of the company.=20
Tomorrow, a Federal judge will decide whether Enron has to turn over any an=
d all documents that pertain to its collapse, this after an Enron employee =
said Enron workers were shredding papers as late as last week, despite orde=
rs not to do so. Ed Lavandera has the story. Ed.=20
ED LAVANDERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Lou, it`s been a rather revealing 24=
 hours in Houston, as late yesterday details started to emerge as attorneys=
 arrived here in Houston for a pre-trial hearing involving Enron, Andersen,=
 and several high profile investors who have invested heavily into Enron.=
=20
And when those attorneys arrived into town, we started hearing the details =
that these attorneys were alleging that they have four or five witnesses in=
side Enron, who say that since Thanksgiving they have seen shredding of doc=
uments inside the finance and accounting departments inside of Enron on the=
 19th and 20th floors. They say that this has happened steadily and lasted =
up until last week.=20
Now those details emerged when the first witness came through to attorneys.=
 They say that this woman, Marie Castanjera (ph) was working across the hal=
lway from these departments and witnessed this. She went home, used the scr=
aps of paper to pack up her boxes, and when she arrived at home, she notice=
d details on the scraps of paper, the names Raptor and Jedi on several of t=
he scraps of paper, and of course, those are the names that have become inf=
amous in this Enron collapse.=20
Those are the names of the partnerships that led to the company`s demise. E=
nron says that it is investigating this at the moment. They do acknowledge =
that since all of this came to light, that they have found one wastebasket =
inside the building that had shredded documents. Those papers have been tur=
ned over to Federal authorities.=20
Now it`s hard to put a lot of this into context because the only thing we`v=
e been able to see in the last 24 hours is one box of these little scraps o=
f papers, and of course, with everything so shredded, it is hard to put int=
o context as to what these documents were.=20
Attorneys for the Enron investors say they have no idea, quite frankly, wha=
t these papers are, but that it doesn`t matter. That indeed, they say these=
 papers were shredded well after Federal investigators launched their inves=
tigation, and all of these documents should have been subpoenaed, and there=
fore should not have been touched.=20
So, Enron executives putting out another memo to employees worldwide saying=
 that no documents should be shredded or touched in any way, as investigato=
rs across the country lead into this investigation. Lou.=20
DOBBS: Ed, the attorney for Enron, Robert Bennett, Bob Bennett today told m=
e that in point of fact it was he who contacted authorities as soon as they=
 learned of this allegation. Was there any reference today in the hearing a=
s to why the plaintiff`s attorneys did not immediately contact authorities?=
=20
LAVANDERA: Well it`s kind of interesting, Lou, because these attorneys are =
the same people who turned over the Sharon Watkins letter.=20
DOBBS: Right.=20
LAVANDERA: One of the attorneys told me last night that they turned over th=
e Sharon Watkins letters to investigators, and they were as a matter of fac=
t that sometimes they wanted to use the publicity to their advantage, that =
their hope is that this will spur and convince other people, who still migh=
t be working inside of Enron, to come forward with more of these allegation=
s, if in fact more people have witnessed this document tampering. Lou.=20
DOBBS: Even in collapse, this contest is still all about money. Ed Lavander=
a, thank you very much.=20
Well charges of shredding documents are incendiary whether it is on Capitol=
 Hill or in the courts. It is not only the crime, the original crime that e=
xcites the interest of investigators, but shredding, the crime of covering =
it up. Tim O`Brien has the report from Washington.=20
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)=20
TIM O`BRIEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): It wasn`t the Watergate break-=
in that drove President Richard Nixon from office, as it was his efforts to=
 cover it up. A jury never convicted former White House aide, Oliver North,=
 of the massive arms-for-hostage deal he orchestrated, but rather for shred=
ding documents and obstructing Congress. It wasn`t Bill Clinton`s relations=
hip with Monica Lewinsky that led to his impeachment, as much as it was his=
 lying under oath about it. History shows that it is not the underlying off=
ense that causes trouble, as often as it is efforts to cover it up.=20
David Duncan, the Arthur Andersen auditor who headed up the Enron audit, ha=
s not admitted ordering thousands of Enron-related documents destroyed on O=
ctober 23rd, the day after the SEC launched an inquiry of Enron`s finances.=
=20
The company fired Duncan citing his bad judgment. Duncan says he followed t=
he advice of in-house counsel, but that may not help.=20
PROFESSOR JOHN COFFEE, COLUMBIA LAW SCHOOL: If you either destroy yourself =
or persuade others to destroy, alter, mutilate any document with the intent=
 of making that document unavailable for use in that official proceeding, i=
t`s a Federal felony and there`s not much you can say by way of defense. It=
`s not easy to say, my lawyer told me to do this. That`s not a recognized d=
efense.=20
O`BRIEN: Arthur Andersen did have a policy of routinely shredding documents=
. "Accountants are like packrats," said CEO Joseph Berardino. "We save lots=
 of stuff that`s not relevant."=20
And company lawyer, Nancy Temple, did send a memo out in early October remi=
nding Duncan and other employees of that policy concluding, "it would helpf=
ul to make sure that we have complied with the policy."=20
(END VIDEOTAPE)=20
O`BRIEN (on camera): House investigators have been questioning both Temple =
and Duncan, and Duncan is expected to be called as a witness before the Hou=
se Energy and Commerce Committee this Thursday. His lawyers disclosed tonig=
ht he will invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self- incrimination. Th=
at is, he`ll speak but only if granted immunity, assurances that nothing he=
 says will be used against him in court. Lou.=20
DOBBS: Tim, thank you very much. Tim O`Brien from Washington. Well, as a ma=
tter of fact President Bush has now been added to the list of people who ar=
e very angry at Enron. One of the President`s own family members, it turns =
out, lost money in the collapse of Enron stock.=20
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)=20
GEORGE W. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: My own mother-in-law bought=
 stock last summer and it`s not worth anything now. If she`d have known all=
 the facts, I don`t know what her decision would have been, but she didn`t =
know all the facts, and a lot of shareholders didn`t know all the facts, an=
d that`s wrong. So our government must do something about it, must make sur=
e that the accounting practices that have been going on for quite a while a=
re addressed.=20
(END VIDEO CLIP)=20
DOBBS: Well, Jenna Welch, the President`s mother-in law, paid almost $41 a =
share for 200 Enron shares. She sold that stock last month, two days after =
Enron declared bankruptcy, at 42 cents a share. She lost more than $8,000.=
=20
Well focusing on Enron`s off-balance-sheet partnerships that enabled Enron =
to hide massive amounts of debt. Chris Huntington now takes a look at those=
 Enron deals and the executive who set them up.=20
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)=20
CHRIS HUNTINGTON, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice over): At the center of Enron`=
s collapse is this man, Andrew Fastow, the company`s former chief financial=
 officer. Until he was fired last October, Fastow designed and carried out =
a sophisticated strategy that expanded Enron`s business, while keeping loss=
es and debt off its books. It was a strategy blessed by Enron`s top brass.=
=20
DAVID BOIES, BOIES, SHILLER & PLEXNER: Those transactions will be transacti=
ons that were reviewed by the Board of Directors of Enron, reviewed by the =
top management of Enron, and which I believe the record will show, the audi=
t committee of the board and the outside auditors had reviewed it as well.=
=20
HUNTINGTON: In 1999, Fastow`s financial wizardry was applauded by analysts =
as groundbreaking and innovative. At the time, CFO Magazine called Enron a =
master of creative financing, and presented Fastow with its annual CFO Exce=
llence award.=20
While Fastow and Enron`s CEO at the time, Jeff Skilling, boasted about Enro=
n`s deals in general terms, they did not divulge all the details. Anyone lo=
oking for answers about Enron`s nearly 6,000 off-balance-sheet transactions=
 in the quarterly or annual reports, found only obscure footnotes.=20
PROFESSION DOUG CARMICHAEL, ACCOUNTING, BARUCH COLLEGE: It`s really impenet=
rable detail in the footnotes. Someone with some understanding of business,=
 should be able to pick up the financial statements, read the notes, and un=
derstand the full effects of those transactions on the financial statement.=
 With Enron, they couldn`t.=20
HUNTINGTON: In August, 2001 Sharon Watkins, an Enron Vice President who rep=
orted to Fastow, wrote her now famous letter to Chairman Ken Lay, expressin=
g her concerns about some of Fastow`s off-balance-sheet deals.=20
According to Enron documents and a letter from Enron`s lawyer, obtained by =
CNN, the transactions worked this way. Fastow set up limited partnerships c=
alled LJM. LJM then set up what are called Special Purpose Entities or S.P.=
E.s. One of them called Raptor was designed to invest in companies on behal=
f of Enron.=20
The structure of the deal required Raptor to pay Enron, even if the investm=
ents soured. But Raptor was essentially delivering an I.O.U. What we do kno=
w now is Raptor`s only significant source of capital was Enron Stock. Enron=
 was using its own stock to pay itself.=20
LYNN TURNER, FORMER CHIEF ACCOUNTANT, SEC: It`s kind of like a money- laund=
ering case. One of the things that is of interest on LJM, one is the fact t=
hat not only the was the debt and the losses kept off the balance sheet by =
putting these transactions in a separate corporation, but it was then used =
to make payments or provide compensation to the CFO.=20
HUNTINGTON: In an extraordinary move, Enron`s Board of Directors waived its=
 conflict of interest rules, allowing Fastow an ownership stake in the part=
nerships, which earned him millions of dollars.=20
(END VIDEOTAPE)=20
Enron ultimately had to account for the LJM and Raptor transactions last No=
vember, when it restated earnings going back to 1997. All tolled, those res=
tatements of off-balance-sheet transactions trimmed Enron`s profits by more=
 than $600 million. Lou.=20
DOBBS: Chris, thank you very much. Chris Huntington. The Enron collapse has=
 devastated for now at least the reputation of the nation`s accounting indu=
stry. There are five major accounting firms. James Copeland is the CEO of o=
ne of them, Deloitte & Touche. What can the industry do to restore investor=
 confidence right now in the financial reporting of corporate America?=20
JAMES COPELAND, CEO, DELOITTE & TOUCHE: Lou, I think there are a number of =
things that the financial industry can do in concert with a number of other=
 people. This is, you know, a real financial crisis for not just our indust=
ry but for the shareholders and employees of Enron who have lost, not only =
their jobs, but also have lost their life savings in many cases. There`s co=
llateral damage with respect to the 335,000 auditors in the United States t=
hat go to work every day.=20
DOBBS: Right.=20
COPELAND: Try to do a good job, produce 15,000 audits a year where there ar=
e no restatements, where there are no challenges. These people are being ta=
rred with the same brush and that`s a tragedy as well.=20
DOBBS: Tarred with the same brush and now a number of recommendations, almo=
st instantaneously. Harvey Pitt at the SEC comes forward with his recommend=
ations, which have created some controversy, both in terms of its timing an=
d, if you will, the lack of commitment behind those proposals in they eyes =
of some.=20
Senator Barbara Boxer says "take accounting firms and eliminate the consult=
ing fees from their business, divest it, go back to the business you`re bes=
t at and that`s auditing." What do you think?=20
COPELAND: Well, I think that Senator Boxer`s comments and the proposed bill=
 is going to generate a debate that really needs to be held. There is a lot=
 more heat around this issue than there is light right now, and we really d=
o need to debate the issues.=20
Everyone is looking for an answer to a very complex problem, and unfortunat=
ely, you know, we all tend to want to move to simplistic answers. Sometimes=
 a simplistic answer is the right one. Oftentimes, what you end up with are=
 unintended consequences that are worse than the original problem.=20
So I think we need to be very careful, very prudent. We need to put everyth=
ing on the table and talk about all of the potential problems and opportuni=
ties and then make some very good, very careful decisions.=20
DOBBS: I know that you probably won`t like this aphorism, but the essence o=
f genius is simplicity itself. It is certainly something that can not be sa=
id of the accounting system, the financial system in any way.=20
But if you, James Copeland, were to look and perhaps you have at the annual=
 report of Enron for the year 2000, do you think you, one of the best minds=
 in accounting and audit, would know, have any suspicion of these secret pa=
rtnerships, and I say secret advisedly, and the huge number of off-shore ta=
x havens that Enron had in its structure?=20
COPELAND: I think some of my partners are probably laughing right now about=
 my being one of the best accounting and auditing minds in our profession, =
but.=20
DOBBS: Just go with it, James.=20
COPELAND: I would say that to your point, I believe, the complexity of Enro=
n and many other companies` financial statements, really is getting to a po=
int where they`re very, very hard to understand for all of us, even for exp=
erts in the area. But at the same time, you know, making the complex simple=
 is a real challenge.=20
DOBBS: A real challenge, and certainly no one would be more aware of that t=
han you. The fact of the matter is that we have reached a stage where the e=
ssence of this country`s financial system, its transparency and its securit=
ies markets and its business dealings is, if not already jeopardized and al=
ready perhaps overtaken by complex tax and accounting laws, we are also at =
risk of losing faith in the system itself. We`re as appalled over these mar=
kets right now, cast in the instance for example of Kmart, in which credit =
standards are rising simply because of the Enron experience. This has to co=
ncern you.=20
COPELAND: It concerns me a lot. One of the things that concerns me most is =
that we come up with two or three simple answers that sound good. We all ce=
lebrate, go home, and 18 months later you have another body on the table, s=
o to speak.=20
DOBBS: Right.=20
COPELAND: And you know, then what happens to the credibility of the system?=
 We need to quit trying to polish the hood. We have a problem with the engi=
ne, you know, and we need to really get our dirt under our fingernails, wor=
k hard on the things that will really make a difference in the financial re=
porting system.=20
DOBBS: OK. James Copeland, we thank you for taking the time to be with us a=
nd we know you`ll be part of the solution.=20
COPELAND: I hope so.=20
DOBBS: James Copeland, Deloitte & Touche.=20
COPELAND: Thanks very much, Lou.=20
DOBBS: We hope you`ll join us tonight at 8:00 Eastern for a one-hour specia=
l on the rise and the fall of Enron. We`ll be live here in Houston. We`ll b=
e taking a look at the forces that brought about Enron`s collapse, and the =
impact it`s had on that company`s employees, the retirement plans of the ci=
ty of Houston, and indeed business in America. All of that coming up on CNN=
, 8:00 Eastern.=20
On Wall Street today, stocks weaker despite positive earnings news form Ama=
zon.com and Lucent Technologies. The Dow Jones Industrials ended the day do=
wn 58 points, the Dow closing at 9713. The Dow has fallen nine out of the p=
ast eleven sessions.=20
And the Nasdaq tonight is at a two-month low, losing 47 points today, more =
than two and a half percent. The broader market, S & P 500, ended down eigh=
t points. We`ll have much more on today`s sell off later in the broadcast.=
=20
Still ahead, we`ll have more on the fallout from the collapse of Enron and =
the scandal now surrounding it. Then, Tyco International is splitting itsel=
f into four companies. We`ll have a report for you.=20
Kmart says its bankruptcy isn`t the end, but rather a chance for a new begi=
nning. We`ll tell you how the company plans to pull itself back together.=
=20
And a dot.com survivor turns into a dot.com success story. Amazon.com promi=
ses that the best is yet to come. We`ll find out.=20
ANNOUNCER: Next, Lou speaks with Jeff Bezos, Chairman and CEO of Amazon.com=
.=20
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)=20
DOBBS: Kmart (URL: http://www.kmart.com/) in business for more than 100 yea=
rs, today filed for bankruptcy. It is the biggest bankruptcy every in the r=
etailing industry. One reason, suppliers were cutting off their products be=
cause Kmart couldn`t make its payments. And with the collapse of Enron, inc=
reasingly companies are demanding prompt payment for their goods and servic=
es. Kitty Pilgrim reports.=20
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)=20
KITTY PILGRIM, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Kmart is keeping all 2,114=
 stores=20
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)=20
DOBBS: Just ahead here, Enron`s collapse has highlighted the vulnerability =
of many retirement plans unfortunately. When we come back, we`ll take a loo=
k at what you can do to protect your retirement savings.=20
The Enron debacle has led to the collapse of thousands of 401(k) accounts h=
eld by Enron employees. The collapse provoked a debate about investment reg=
ulations that could prove precedent setting. At the very core of the debate=
: Does the federal government have any business telling you how to invest y=
our own retirement money?=20
Peter Viles reports.=20
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)=20
PETER VILES, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): You`ve heard about all the E=
nron employees who loaded up on the company stock in their retirement accou=
nts and lost nearly everything.=20
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You feel like you`ve almost been raped.=20
VILES: You`ve heard the Bush administration says it`s studying the 401(k) r=
ules, with an eye toward protecting your retirement money.=20
ARI FLEISCHER, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: I think the public is very unea=
sy about their pensions. The public wants to know if what happened to Enron=
 can happen to them. The president wants to make sure that any action is ta=
ken so that others can be protected so that it does not happen to them.=20
VILES: Considering it`s a creation of the IRS, the 401(k) is quite simple. =
First off, it is optional. Your employer is not required to offer a 401(k) =
plan and you`re not required to participate. The employer has the option of=
 putting its money or stock into your account, but on the employer`s terms.=
 And there are no government guarantees or insurance on the money itself. I=
t is yours to invest.=20
DAVID RAY, 401(K) PROFIT SHARING ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA: It is not a define=
d benefit plan. There are not guarantees. It`s not a program where promises=
 about future benefits are made. It`s about setting money aside, investing =
that money and then using those contributions and returns as your retiremen=
t income.=20
VILES: Lastly, the employer does have the right to lock up the plan tempora=
rily to switch administrators. The 10-day lockup at Enron is not considered=
 to be unusually long. So how might Washington protect your 401(k)?=20
Senator Jon Corzine wants mandatory diversity. The government would prevent=
 you from putting more than 20 percent of your account into any one stock. =
But do you really want the government telling you how to invest your money?=
=20
MICHAEL HOLLAND, HOLLAND & CO.: When we start getting lawyers and politicia=
ns telling us where we can invest our 401(k)s, I think it should send shudd=
ers up the spines of individual investors.=20
VILES: Corzine`s argument is that the government sponsors 401(k)s by deferr=
ing taxes, so it has an obligation to regulate them.=20
SEN. JOHN CORZINE (D), NEW JERSEY: It is out of bounds for the federal gove=
rnment to be sponsoring a policy that doesn`t fit together with what any in=
vestment adviser, any reasonable investment strategy coming out of academia=
 or simple commonsense principals that don`t put all your eggs in one baske=
t.=20
(END VIDEOTAPE)=20
VILES (on camera): Well, wait, does that phrase resonate here in Houston, w=
here a lot of people wish they had a lot fewer eggs in that one basket of E=
nron stock? Total losses by Enron employees in their 401(k)s alone on Enron=
 stock, estimated at over $1 billion -- Lou.=20
DOBBS: Well, it`s a terrific point. The fact is these 401(k)s are not requi=
red by the companies. It`s become, if you will, fashionable and employees r=
ely upon them. And it puts in stark contrast here, Enron so much it can be =
accused of, the fact is the 401(k), which it contributed, is probably a rea=
son to cut them a little slack there.=20
VILES: Yes, a lot of the stock in those accounts was stock that Enron gave =
the employees. It was a gift that ultimately became worthless, but it was a=
 gift in the first place.=20
DOBBS: OK. Thank you very much, Peter Viles.=20
Coming up next here, another victim of the slumping economy. Two-and-a-half=
 years after Talk Magazine roared into existence, the glossy magazine has f=
allen silent. We`ll have the inside scoop with Talk`s editor-in-chief, Tina=
 Brown.=20
ANNOUNCER: After the break, Lou talks with Tina Brown of Talk Magazine.=20
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)=20
Congress is back in session tomorrow after a lengthy break, and that means =
a lot of news ahead. So stay tuned. That`s MONEYLINE for this Tuesday eveni=
ng. We thank you for being with us. Live from Enron headquarters in Houston=
, please join us tonight 8:00 p.m. Eastern, our one-hour special program --=

Tom,

I like the air too.  Polling our board, they are spit on which pool but as
Jeff pointed out the kids can start from the starting blocks instead of the
bulkhead (which does affect their times).  That was an issue for several
teams when we were setting up a Klein Oak last year.  We should all talk
about whether to request the gym and the additional cost of doing so.  The
pool fees have increased since last year.  You can shoot an email to Jeff
and the other teams about the idea if you like.

Cindy

Cindy,

Since the majority of the division wants Klein High School, I'll live
with it.  Becky Miller had a good idea, how about if we see if we can
also get their gym so we can have the teams set up in there.  It is not
as conveniently located to the pool as Klein Oak's gym is but at least
it keeps the teams out of the sun for the day.  What do you think?

Tom

P.S. you either respond to this address (work) or the other address you

Enron and Dynegy each announced today that they are holding discussions about a possible merger of the two companies.  As you know, Dynegy is a major player in the energy marketplace, and is not only a competitor, but also a counterparty of Enron.  This is just one of several options that we are considering.

Upon receipt of this announcement, the NYSE briefly suspended trading of both Enron and Dynegy.  We have no additional information we can share at this time.  We'll keep you updated as developments occur.

Corporate turnaround expert Stephen F. Cooper likes to rate restructuring j=
obs on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the most difficult.=20
"I would rather work on a 10 than a 4," he told the Toronto Globe and Mail =
two years ago as he took over at Burlington, Ont.-based Laidlaw Inc. -- par=
ent of the Greyhound bus line -- shortly before it entered bankruptcy.
Now he may have has his "10" -- at bankrupt Enron Corp., where Cooper was n=
amed interim chief executive yesterday. He replaces company founder Kenneth=
 L. Lay, who resigned last week under pressure from creditors.=20
Cooper said his group will start immediately.=20
"Our focus is on the future of Enron," he said in a statement released by E=
nron. "With more than 19,000 employees worldwide, Enron has real businesses=
 with real value. We will work closely with the board of directors, managem=
ent and the creditors committee to develop a reorganization plan to maximiz=
e value for the company's stakeholders."=20
Whether Enron will survive in any form is highly uncertain, however. The co=
mpany has at least $40 billion in debt, with the full extent of its liabili=
ties from hundreds of partnerships and related companies as yet unknown. In=
 addition, most of its known assets are heavily mortgaged, and some of its =
viable operations have already been sold off.=20
Enron's cornerstone energy-trading operation was sold earlier this month to=
 UBS Warburg, a Swiss bank, and Enron announced yesterday that its presiden=
t and chief operating officer, Lawrence G. Whalley, had resigned to go with=
 UBS Warburg. Earlier, Enron ceded control of its largest pipeline to its H=
ouston-based rival, Dynegy Inc. And yesterday, Enron agreed to sell its Lon=
don-based metals-trading unit for $145 million to Sempra Energy.=20
It is possible all of Enron's remaining assets will also have to be sold to=
 pay creditors, and some experts said Cooper's main challenge may be hammer=
ing out an agreement among creditors on how to divide up the proceeds.=20
As managing principal of Zolfo Cooper LLC, a New York and Los Angeles-based=
 firm specializing in the reorganization of corporations in bankruptcy or o=
ther difficult circumstances, Cooper has worked with such troubled companie=
s as Macy's parent Federated Department Stores Inc., appliance maker Sunbea=
m Corp. and construction firm Morrison Knudsen.=20
The firm "has terrific cachet in the workout community," said Stephen H. Ca=
se of the Washington office of Dave, Polk & Wardwell. "They are very much i=
n demand and highly respected."=20
Cooper is known as blunt-spoken, pulling no punches about what a company ou=
ght to do to survive, and creative in coming up with strategies to achieve =
those goals.=20
And as an executive who tries to rescue companies in extremis, he has won s=
ome and lost some.=20
One of his biggest victories was at Federated, which filed for Chapter 11 p=
rotection in 1990 and emerged two years later. Federated owns Bloomingdale'=
s and other department-store chains as well as Macy's.=20
Federated, once owned by Canadian developer Robert Campeau, was a basically=
 solid business that was overwhelmed by junk-bond debt from the 1980s takeo=
ver binge. Cooper was able to cobble together a large retail firm from the =
wreckage and have it in the black by late 1992.=20
At the other end of the scale, Bradlees, a chain of discount department sto=
res operating in the Northeast, turned out not to be viable and was liquida=
ted, with unsecured creditors receiving 22 cents on the dollar.=20
Cooper is a graduate of Occidental College and holds an MBA from the Wharto=
n School of the University of Pennsylvania. He was not available for commen=
t yesterday.

Accounting for Enron: Enron Selects Cooper of Zolfo Cooper For Post of Acti=
ng CEO, Succeeding Lay
By Rebecca Smith
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

The Wall Street Journal

Enron Corp. said it named Stephen Cooper, a principal at New York restructu=
ring firm Zolfo Cooper, as acting chief executive officer, succeeding Kenne=
th Lay, who resigned from the embattled energy concern last week.=20
In his new role, Mr. Cooper, 55 years old, faces the daunting challenge of =
shepherding Enron through the biggest bankruptcy case in U.S. history. The =
appointment had been expected. Enron still employs some 19,000 people, alth=
ough the company has been mired in Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court proceedings =
since last month, which shields it from creditors as it attempts to reorgan=
ize.
Meantime, Enron's board is continuing to search for a chairman, a position =
also held by Mr. Lay. Those close to the matter say that Enron is seeking s=
omeone with a high public stature. The idea is for this person to be someth=
ing of an ambassador to Congress, which now has nearly a dozen committees i=
nvestigating Enron's business practices.=20
Mr. Cooper, who declined an interview request yesterday, is expected to run=
 Enron on a day-to-day basis and help it navigate the bankruptcy process. I=
t is expected that he will leave the post if the company emerges from bankr=
uptcy proceedings. Previously, Enron noted, he has worked on the bankruptcy=
 proceedings of Laidlaw Inc., Morrison Knudsen Corp., Sunbeam Corp., Federa=
ted Department Stores Inc., as well as many other big-name Chapter 11 cases=
.=20
Those who know Mr. Cooper describe him as an energetic deal maker who is go=
od at getting to the crux of issues. In a room filled with suit-and-tie-cla=
d bankruptcy attorneys, Mr. Cooper often stands out for his casual dress. W=
hen discussions get contentious, he is known to defuse the tension with hum=
or then redirects discussions back in the direction of solutions.=20
"He's a very interesting person, and I can't say that about a lot of the pe=
ople you deal with when you're in bankruptcy," said Peter Widdrington, chai=
rman of Laidlaw, the big Toronto-based transportation company that operates=
 school buses in the U.S. and Canada and owns Greyhound bus lines. Laidlaw =
filed for bankruptcy protection last summer, and Mr. Cooper has been advisi=
ng it on how to emerge from court proceedings.=20
Mr. Widdrington said Mr. Cooper has indicated that he will continue to work=
 20 hours a week for Laidlaw, as specified in his contract. "I'm not unconc=
erned about the fact he's now working with Enron," said Mr. Widdrington, bu=
t he added that others at Mr. Cooper's firm are capable of "stepping in."=
=20
Some observers wonder whether Mr. Cooper will, for all his talents, be able=
 to lead Enron out of bankruptcy; they speculate that the company could wel=
l be liquidated in the end. In all, Enron's bankrupt entities have liabilit=
ies exceeding $30 billion.=20
Mr. Cooper will work most closely with Jeff McMahon, Enron's chief financia=
l officer, who yesterday was named president and chief operating officer, a=
nd with Ray Bowen, formerly treasurer, who will step into Mr. McMahon's fin=
ance job.=20
Greg Whalley, named president of Enron last summer by Mr. Lay, has resigned=
 to take a senior level job at UBS AG's UBS Warburg, which this month bough=
t Enron's energy-trading business.=20
Separately, Texas Deputy Attorney General Jeff Boyd filed a motion in the U=
.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York -- where Enron's =
case is being heard -- asking the court to appoint an additional creditors =
committee to represent the interests of former and retired Enron employees.=
=20
"While the major financial creditors of Enron have a right to adequate repr=
esentation in the bankruptcy case, so do the thousands of former and retire=
d Enron employees who are the least able, on an individual basis, to partic=
ipate meaningfully in this case," Mr. Boyd said in a statement.=20
Meanwhile, Sempra Energy Trading, a unit of San Diego-based Sempra Energy, =
said it will pay $145 million for Enron's London-based metals trading busin=
ess, formerly Metallgesellschaft Ltd. The transaction, subject to final aud=
it, is expected to be completed by Feb. 4. Don Felsinger, head of Sempra's =
unregulated operations, said the Enron unit has been profitable "since its =
inception . . . and we expect this track record of success to continue."=20

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE TURNAROUND EFFORT
Enron Names an Interim Chief to Oversee Its Bankruptcy
By SHAILA K. DEWAN With JENNIFER 8. LEE

01/30/2002
The New York Times
Page 7, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

HOUSTON, Jan. 29 -- Enron today named Stephen F. Cooper, a specialist in re=
vamping troubled companies, to lead it through the largest bankruptcy in th=
e nation's history.=20
Mr. Cooper, who will serve as Enron's interim chief executive, fills the to=
p position vacated by Kenneth L. Lay, who resigned last Wednesday as chief =
executive and chairman under pressure from the company's creditors.
Enron is still searching for a chairman, who will serve as the political fa=
ce of the company in Washington, where it is being investigated by Congress=
, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice.=20
Mr. Cooper, 55, has been involved in prominent bankruptcies, including thos=
e of Federated Department Stores and Trans World Airlines. But sorting out =
Enron's tangled and opaque finances will be the biggest challenge of his ca=
reer, bankruptcy experts said.=20
Enron also named Jeffrey McMahon president and chief operating officer. He =
succeeds Lawrence G. Whalley, who resigned to take a position with UBS Warb=
urg, which bought the energy trading business that was once the centerpiece=
 of Enron's success.=20
Mr. McMahon, who was named in a letter by a former employee, Sherron S. Wat=
kins, as one executive who complained about the company's conflicts of inte=
rest, became chief financial officer after the forced resignation in Octobe=
r of Andrew S. Fastow, who managed some of the partnerships that helped bri=
ng the company to ruin. Raymond M. Bowen Jr., formerly the treasurer, was a=
ppointed executive vice president and chief financial officer.=20
Mr. Cooper, a managing partner at Zolfo Cooper, a boutique advisory firm fo=
r companies in trouble, was the leading candidate to replace Mr. Lay. In se=
lecting candidates for the Enron board to interview, the creditors committe=
e decided to focus on specialists in corporate turnarounds, rather than chi=
ef executives with marquee names.=20
''Our focus is on the future of Enron,'' Mr. Cooper said in a statement. ''=
Enron has real businesses with real value. We will work closely with the bo=
ard of directors, management and the creditors committee to develop a reorg=
anization plan to maximize value for the company's stakeholders.''=20
Mr. Cooper is known for his ability to balance the interests of warring fac=
tions.=20
''He's a person who can get in there and see where the bodies are buried an=
d see what things are needed to calm the waters,'' said Sandra E. Mayerson,=
 a bankruptcy lawyer at Holland & Knight who represents several of Enron's =
smaller creditors.=20
Still, some creditors not represented on the committee reacted with only a =
cautious optimism, praising the naming of an outsider to run the company bu=
t noting that the terms of Mr. Cooper's contract, which calls for him to be=
 paid an hourly wage with a bonus if he meets certain goals, have not yet b=
een made public.=20
''We're going to keep an open mind as to Mr. Cooper and his team,'' said Da=
vid Bennett, a lawyer who represents a group of oil and gas companies owed =
about $100 million. ''To have someone with restructuring experience is a go=
od thing.''=20
While a few creditors have asked for a court-appointed trustee to oversee t=
he reorganization, some said that the choice of an outsider might satisfy t=
hem. ''He's going to bring credibility to the situation,'' Ms. Mayerson sai=
d. ''I think if you hadn't gotten him involved in management, there would h=
ave been movement for an examiner or a trustee. He can serve that function =
as well as the C.E.O. function. So you are getting two functions for the pr=
ice of one.''=20
A lawyer for the Wiser Oil Company, another creditor that has asked for a t=
rustee, declined to comment.=20
Some bankruptcy experts have questioned Mr. Cooper's lack of experience as =
a chief executive. But Mr. Cooper's defenders point out that what is needed=
 in Enron's case is someone intimately familiar with bankruptcy, not someon=
e who can lead or innovate in the context of a healthy company.=20
''He's a person who knows the ins and outs of restructuring and a person wh=
o knows the ins and outs of forensic accounting,'' said Deborah Hicks Midan=
ek, a principal for Glass & Associates, a Zolfo competitor.=20
Mr. Cooper began work today, sending Enron employees a voice mail message p=
raising the work force and expressing confidence that the company would eve=
ntually emerge from bankruptcy in some form. But many outside experts maint=
ain that Enron may have little choice but to sell its viable businesses and=
 eventually shut down.=20
Mr. Cooper has largely avoided the spotlight, even as he has advised or man=
aged well-known companies in crisis.=20
He grew up in Indiana and received his M.B.A. from the Wharton School in 19=
70. At the accounting firm of Touche Ross, now a part of Deloitte & Touche,=
 he and Frank Zolfo, now retired, founded the reorganization advisory group=
 and were early advocates for bankruptcy as an area of specialty.=20
In the early 1990's, Mr. Cooper served as an adviser to Federated, the owne=
r of Bloomingdale's and Macy's, as it worked through its bankruptcy. In par=
t because of the aggressive timelines Mr. Cooper set, the Federated bankrup=
tcy proceeding took only two years instead of the five years that some anal=
ysts had predicted.=20
He also served as an adviser in two of T.W.A.'s bankruptcies.=20
Even as he takes the Enron job, Mr. Cooper continues to serve as vice chair=
man and chief restructuring officer of the Canadian conglomerate Laidlaw In=
c., the largest North American ground transportation company, whose holding=
s include Greyhound Lines. Though he was called in to help the debt-burdene=
d company stave off bankruptcy in 2000, Laidlaw filed for protection from c=
reditors in June 2001.=20
''When we did eventually file for bankruptcy, we did it in a very orderly b=
asis, and that had a lot to do with his efforts,'' said Peter Widdrington, =
the chairman of Laidlaw. Mr. Cooper cleared a major obstacle by negotiating=
 a recent $55.4 million settlement, announced two weeks ago, in a class- ac=
tion lawsuit against Laidlaw.=20
On a scale of one to 10, Mr. Cooper told a Canadian newspaper, he rated Lai=
dlaw a 4 for complexity. ''I would rather work on a 10 than a 4,'' he said.=
=20
Enron, then, is his wish come true.=20

Video: Angry employee demanded to know if Lay on crack=20
Reuters News Services=20
Jan. 30, 2002, 8:26AM
WASHINGTON - A video of an Enron staff meeting, held as the former energy g=
iant began to unravel, showed former chief Kenneth Lay under fire from empl=
oyees, one of whom demanded to know if he was on crack.=20
"I would like to know if you are on crack. If so that would explain a lot, =
if not you may want to start because it's going to be a long time before we=
 trust you again," was one written comment Lay read out at the meeting, hel=
d Oct. 23.=20
"I think that's probably not a very happy employee, and that's understandab=
le," Lay said in response.=20
Enron, once the world's largest energy trader and a Wall Street darling, ma=
de the largest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history on Dec. 2. Damning allegat=
ions of insider trading and financial misdeeds evaporated investor confiden=
ce, threw thousands out of work and wiped out workers' retirement savings.=
=20
The staff meeting, aired today on NBC's Today show, happened just days afte=
r Enron reported its first quarterly loss in over four years after taking c=
harges of $1 billion on poorly performing businesses.=20
In the video, Lay, who last week quit as Enron's chairman and chief executi=
ve officer, apologized to his workers and promised to get back money they l=
ost when the company's share price plummeted.=20
"Let me say right up front, I am absolutely heartbroken about what's happen=
ed both over the last few months and more importantly the last several days=
," he told glum-faced employees.=20
"Many of you, who were a lot wealthier six to nine months ago, are now conc=
erned about college education for your kids, maybe the mortgage on your hou=
se, maybe your retirement and for that I am incredibly sorry. But we're goi=
ng to get it back."=20
Earlier this week Lay's wife Linda said her family lost its fortune when En=
ron, the once-proud linchpin of the Houston economy and national energy mar=
ket, collapsed.=20
"There's nothing left. Everything we had mostly was in the one stock... Oth=
er than the home we live in, everything else is for sale.. We are fighting =
for liquidity," she said.=20
But NBC said they had found at least 10 homes or lots, owned by the couple,=
 that were not listed for sale and were worth about $10 million.=20
The network said Lay was entitled to a severance package of $25 million. An=
d as of Jan. 1, the former-Enron chief owned more than $5 million in two co=

USA: Video shows Enron employee asked if Lay was on crack.

01/30/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

WASHINGTON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - A video broadcast on Wednesday of an Enron s=
taff meeting, held as the former energy giant began to unravel, showed its =
former chief Kenneth Lay under fire from employees, one of whom demanded to=
 know if he was on crack.=20
"I would like to know if you are on crack. If so that would explain a lot, =
if not you may want to start because it's going to be a long time before we=
 trust you again," was one written comment Lay read out at the meeting, hel=
d on Oct. 23.
"I think that's probably not a very happy employee and that's understandabl=
e," Lay said in response.=20
Enron, once the world's largest energy trader and a Wall Street darling, ma=
de the largest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history on Dec. 2. Damning allegat=
ions of insider trading and financial misdeeds evaporated investor confiden=
ce, threw thousands out of work and wiped out workers' retirement savings.=
=20
The staff meeting, aired on Wednesday on NBC's "Today" show, happened just =
days after Enron reported its first quarterly loss in over four years after=
 taking charges of $1 billion on poorly performing businesses.=20
In the video Lay, who last week quit as Enron's chairman and chief executiv=
e officer, apologized to his workers and promised to get back money they lo=
st when the company's share price plummeted.=20
"Let me say right up front, I am absolutely heartbroken about what's happen=
ed both over the last few months and more importantly the last several days=
," he told glum-faced employees.=20
"Many of you, who were a lot wealthier six to nine months ago, are now conc=
erned about college education for your kids, maybe the mortgage on your hou=
se, maybe your retirement and for that I am incredibly sorry. But we're goi=
ng to get it back."=20
Earlier this week Lay's wife Linda said her family lost its fortune when En=
ron, the once-proud linchpin of the Houston economy and national energy mar=
ket, collapsed.=20
"There's nothing left. Everything we had mostly was in the one stock... Oth=
er than the home we live in, everything else is for sale.. We are fighting =
for liquidity," she said.=20
But NBC said they had found at least 10 homes or lots, owned by the couple,=
 that were not listed for sale and were worth about $10 million.=20
The network said Lay was entitled to a severance package of $25 million. An=
d as of Jan. 1, the former-Enron chief owned more than $5 million in two co=
mpanies - with 340,724 shares in the No. 2 personal computer company Compaq=
 and 20,220 in drugmaker Eli Lilly.

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE TV INTERVIEW
Did NBC Let Lay's Wife Get Around Hard Issues?
By FELICITY BARRINGER

01/30/2002
The New York Times
Page 7, Column 6
c. 2002 New York Times Company

Lisa Myers, the NBC Capitol Hill correspondent long known as tough-minded, =
left much of her aggressive edge at the door on Saturday when she did an ex=
clusive interview with the wife of Kenneth L. Lay, the former chief executi=
ve of Enron.=20
As a result, Linda Lay felt comfortable enough to say that she and her husb=
and, who took home about $200 million worth of cash and stock the last four=
 years, ''are fighting for liquidity.''
''We don't want to go bankrupt,'' she added. ''Other than the home we live =
in, everything else is for sale.''=20
So should Ms. Myers earn praise from her colleagues for eliciting such a ne=
wsworthy -- and, to former Enron employees, infuriating -- statement? Or di=
d she shirk her duty by failing to grill Mrs. Lay on the details of where a=
ll the money went, accepting the answer: ''There's nothing left. Everything=
 we had mostly was in Enron stock.''=20
For 10 minutes on Monday on the NBC News program ''Today'' and for another =
6 minutes yesterday, Mrs. Lay, the couple's children, Mr. Lay's former wife=
 and his pastor were given a platform to praise the integrity of the man wh=
o Ms. Myers said in a separate report ''led Enron to great heights and to r=
uin.''=20
Ms. Myers, while challenging Mrs. Lay in general terms on issues like Mr. L=
ay's responsibility for Enron's collapse, gave the Lay family plenty of roo=
m to make the case for him, free of prosecutory inquiry.=20
This led some journalists and media critics to ask whether the network and =
one of its sharp-edged correspondents had become soft.=20
Ken Auletta, who covers media companies for The New Yorker, said: ''Lisa My=
ers has proven over the years that she knows how to ask tough questions and=
 be in-your-face aggressive. With this she proved she has another pitch, to=
 draw people out.''=20
He added: ''That's commendable. But there's another pitch, a combination of=
 solicitous and tough questions. We didn't see that third pitch'' in the in=
terview, he said.=20
But Richard Wald, a former ABC News executive who is now a professor at the=
 Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, said aggression was oft=
en counterproductive. ''What you wanted was a sense of what this woman was =
like,'' Mr. Wald said. ''I had the feeling she shot herself in the foot.''=
=20
One core question raised by critics was how much leeway an interviewer shou=
ld give when the only person who can be enticed before the camera's eye is =
a surrogate -- a wife, a friend, a child -- for the newsmaker the journalis=
t really wants to interview. ''She's not a main character in the drama,'' M=
r. Wald said, ''she's a peripheral character now putting herself forward.''=
=20
Don Hewitt, executive producer of the CBS News program ''60 Minutes,'' had =
not seen the interview, but said: ''When you invite somebody in and you mak=
e it apparent that you want to discuss the business at hand, there are no g=
round rules. If she knows that much about what he made and what they lost a=
nd what they don't have, she's qualified to answer all the rest of the ques=
tions.''=20
Ms. Myers said: ''I dealt with her on the broad strokes of every significan=
t issue of potential misconduct that had been raised about her husband. But=
 you cannot go into all the minutiae.''=20
A second question, Ms. Myers and Mr. Wald say, is the extent to which relen=
tless critical scrutiny can and should be balanced with sympathetic coverag=
e.=20
In another report this month, Ms. Myers captured the tone and substance of =
much of her Enron coverage. In it, she described an optimistic Mr. Lay sayi=
ng in October that ''we had a good strong quarter.'' Ms. Myers followed by =
saying: ''Six weeks later, Enron laid off 4,000 employees and declared bank=
ruptcy, costing thousands of workers their life savings. Tonight, Enron had=
 no comment on why it didn't level with the public last fall.''=20
Ms. Myers said yesterday that she and the network should be judged by ''the=
 totality of the coverage.''=20
Last night, a Myers report on the defense of Mr. Lay's family included crit=
ical commentary by business experts. Another NBC reporter, Jim Avila, also =
reported on the Lay's $10 million in real estate holdings and $5 million in=
 stock and interviewed an Enron employee who was incredulous about Mrs. Lay=
's claim that her family was nearly broke.=20
As for the amount of time given to the defense of Mr. Lay, she said, ''We w=
anted to let the family make all the points they wanted to make -- they hav=
e a right to be heard from -- the amount of time they've gotten for their p=
oint of view has been dwarfed by the hours and hours of critical coverage.'=

Ill. Regulators Vote To Remove Enron Energy-Sale Rights
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

01/30/2002

(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

By Jon Kamp
CHICAGO (Dow Jones)--The Illinois Commerce Commission approved an order Tue=
sday to strip an Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) unit of its right to sell electricity =
to retail customers in the state.=20
Illinois law requires retail electric providers such as Enron Energy Servic=
es to be backed by a company with at least an investment-grade credit ratin=
g. Major ratings firms dropped Enron to below that level last November, and=
 while EES has maintained hundreds of customers around the U.S. despite joi=
ning its parent in bankruptcy court, it is missing needed criteria to opera=
te in Illinois, the ICC said.=20
"As a result of Enron's ratings downgrades, EES can no longer rely on the E=
nron guarantee to demonstrate that it is in compliance" with state law, the=
 ICC said in its order.=20
Enron's certificate won't be immediately revoked. Instead, Tuesday's order =
starts a process in which an administrative law judge will review the issue=
, and will give Enron an undermined amount of time to show why it should re=
tain its certificate, ICC spokesman Beth Bosch said.=20
The commission said in its order that EES was notified Nov. 30 that it had =
30 days to demonstrate it had financial resources to meet the state's crite=
ria. But EES hasn't provided any documentation since then, the order said.=
=20
An EES representative didn't return repeated calls seeking comment.=20
ICC Commissioner Ruth Kretschmer said EES has already informally suggested =
it will voluntarily give up its right to serve retail customers in Illinois=
.=20
"My understanding is that they have offered to relinquish the certificate,"=
 Kretschmer said in an interview.=20
But Kretschmer still expects there will be a review process to determine ex=
actly how Tuesday's order impacts EES' ability to do business in Illinois. =
While the company had dozens of Chicago-area customers before its parent's =
collapse, including the city of Chicago and PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) unit Quaker =
Oats Co., the ICC said EES wasn't actually supplying electricity for any of=
 its Illinois customers.=20
Instead, EES was acting as a billing agent and manager, helping mostly larg=
e commercial and industrial customers manage their energy use and restructu=
re deals with local utilities, such as Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) Commonwealth Ed=
ison Co. Kretschmer said it is unclear whether EES needs the retail electri=
city provider to serve in such a capacity.=20
"We probably won't have an answer until we go through the (review) process,=
" Kretschmer said.=20
While EES may not have directly served customers with power, some energy ma=
nagement deals were a foothold to later energy provider service. In its eig=
ht-year contract signed with the city of Chicago last summer, for example, =
Enron was to provide management services for the first few years and then a=
ctual electricity for the remainder of the deal.=20
The city of Chicago canceled its Enron deal in early December. Quaker Oats,=
 the University of Chicago and the Archdiocese of Chicago have also backed =
out of their EES contracts in the wake of Enron's financial troubles.=20
EES was a large player in Illinois' young, deregulated retail electric mark=
etplace, but Kretschmer said she doesn't see its withdrawal hindering the g=
rowth of competition.=20
"There are a number of other big players that can pick up what Enron lost,"=
 she said. "I don't think it will have a negative impact here."=20

House Panel Seen Asking Enron Board Members To Testify

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES=20

(This article was originally published Tuesday.)
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Members of Enron Corp.'s (ENRNQ) board of director=
s are expected to be asked next week to testify before the House Energy and=
 Commerce Committee, a lawyer representing the board said Tuesday.=20
The board members will appear before the committee whether or not they are =
subpoenaed and will answer all questions, attorney Neil Eggleston said.=20
"I expect something will happen in the next day or so regarding their appea=
rance," Eggleston said. "We were notified already, but we should know for s=
ure by next week."=20
Peter Sheffield, a spokesman for the committee, said Tuesday that he expect=
s committee Chairman Billy Tauzin, R-La., to issue subpoenas next week to c=
ompel members of Enron's board to testify, possibly by mid-February.=20
Enron's former Chairman and Chief Executive Ken Lay, who resigned last week=
 but remains on the board, is scheduled to testify before the House committ=
ee on Monday. Enron's board is named in a number of civil and class action =
lawsuits associated with the company's collapse. Its audit committee review=
ed some of the off-balance sheet partnerships now at the center of federal
investigations, and the full board voted twice to suspend Enron's code of e=
thics to allow former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow to run partners=
hips even as he served as an officer for Enron.

Eggleston said last week Enron's board of directors didn't learn until Octo=
ber that an Enron executive had serious concerns accounting improprieties c=
ould bring down the company, although word of those concerns had spread thr=
oughout the company by early September.=20
The executive, Sherron Watkins, raised her concerns with Lay in August. Tho=
se concerns were shared with the board after being reviewed at Lay's reques=
t by Vinson & Elkins, Enron's outside law firm, Eggleston said last week.=
=20
According to Eggleston, Robert Jaedicke, the chairman of the board's audit =
committee, became aware of Watkins' concerns a few days before the committe=
e met on Oct. 8. Vinson & Elkins advised others on the committee at the mee=
ting, and the rest of the board was informed a couple of days before the fi=
rm released its report.=20
The firm submitted its findings in a report dated Oct. 15, concluding that =
the company's handling of its off-balance-sheet partnerships was proper but=
 could be portrayed in a way that could be damaging to Enron.=20
Enron has declined to challenge Eggleston's account.=20
Some members of Enron's board - including audit committee members Ronnie Ch=
an, chairman of the Hang Lung Group in Hong Kong; John Wakeham, chairman of=
 the Press Complaints Commission in the U.K.; and Paulo V. Ferraz Pereira, =
executive vice president of Group Bozano in Brazil - reside outside the U.S=
.=20
Eggleston said he didn't know if those board members would travel to the U.=
S. to testify.=20

Enron failed to disclose full lobbying expenses=20
Associated Press=20
Jan. 30, 2002, 6:53AM
WASHINGTON - Enron Corp. apparently failed to disclose many of its lobbying=
 expenses to Congress last year as the energy trader headed toward financia=
l disaster.=20
Enron acknowledged the problem Tuesday night after a private group that tra=
cks money in politics compared Enron's lobbying filing to Congress in Augus=
t with congressional filings by outside lobbying firms. The lobbying firms =
say they were paid more than $1.6 million by Enron for the first six months=
 of 2001. Enron reported spending $825,000.=20
Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said the company's spending figure submitted =
to Congress last Aug. 15 is meant to cover lobbying by the company's own st=
aff and work by outside lobbying firms.=20
"We are reviewing those fees and will respond in writing to the secretary o=
f the Senate," Denne said.=20
Among the lobbyists doing work for Enron were Republican strategist Ed Gill=
espie; ex-Sen. J. Bennett Johnston, a Louisiana Democratic; and current Rep=
ublican Party chief Marc Racicot; and two ex-aides to House Majority Whip T=
om DeLay. Racicot still collects a salary from his firm but said when he to=
ok the GOP post he would no longer lobby for Enron. In the face of mounting=
 criticism, Racicot has since given up his other lobbying clients as well.=
=20
The discrepancy in Enron's lobbying expenses was discovered by the Washingt=
on-based Center for Responsive Politics. Its executive director, Larry Nobl=
e, said "it is particularly critical at this time for the public to have th=
e full picture of Enron's lobbying activities."=20
Also on Tuesday, Enron's political action committee said it donated at leas=
t $26,000 to congressional campaigns in November, the month before the comp=
any filed for bankruptcy protection. Recipients included several lawmakers =
on the committees now investigating Enron's collapse. At least two, Rep. Ma=
ry Bono, R-Calif., and Rep. Greg Walden, R-Ore., plan to give their donatio=
ns to charity.=20
The Enron PAC donated at least $120,188 to federal candidates and fund-rais=
ing committees last year, the report shows.=20
In another development, the issue of document-shredding re-emerged at Enron=
, with the company saying it hired private companies to destroy documents. =
Robert Bennett, an attorney representing the company, said the discarded do=
cuments were not sensitive financial records, and any suggestion of any imp=
ropriety was "a bunch of nonsense."=20
Enron hired two companies, one of them named Shredco, to destroy a huge vol=
ume of material, ABC News reported Tuesday night.=20
"There was a contract with a company when Enron consolidated down from two =
buildings to one building," Bennett said. "There was a lot of information i=
ncluding payroll records, resumes, Social Security numbers. These trucks ca=
me in in the light of day."=20
"Even if they're shredding old newspapers, they need to contact the Justice=
 Department" to get permission to do so and allay suspicions, said Rep. Jim=
 Greenwood, R-Pa., who chairs the House Energy and Commerce oversight and i=
nvestigations subcommittee looking into Enron.=20
FBI agents have been investigating allegations of massive shredding of docu=
ments at Enron's Houston headquarters. The company's auditor, Arthur Anders=
en LLP, has acknowledged destroying Enron-related documents and e-mails tha=
t were sought by federal and congressional investigators.=20

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE DOCUMENTS
Enron Says Shredding of Records Was Not Stopped Until Recently
By BARNABY J. FEDER and MICHAEL BRICK

01/30/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 1
c. 2002 New York Times Company

Enron acknowledged yesterday that it had contracted until mid-January with =
commercial shredding companies to destroy company records.=20
The disclosure outraged a congressman whose subcommittee is investigating d=
ocument destruction at Enron and its accounting firm, Arthur Andersen, thou=
gh Enron insisted that the records being destroyed were unrelated to the co=
ntinuing investigations of the company's collapse.
F.B.I. agents were in the company's Houston headquarters as recently as Mon=
day, government officials said. They have been working there to preserve po=
tential evidence since last week, when an employee came forward to say docu=
ments were being shredded earlier in the month.=20
In Washington, House Republican leaders backed President Bush and Vice Pres=
ident Dick Cheney in their refusal to tell Congress about contacts between =
Enron and the administration's energy task force. But several Republican se=
nators called on the White House to disclose the information. [Page C1.]=20
Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, said the commercial shredding was a routin=
e matter. The materials destroyed by a private company, Shredco, included i=
tems like payroll runs, old personnel records, performance reviews, medical=
 records and other items that he called ''sensitive employee documents.''=
=20
Representative James Greenwood, the Pennsylvania Republican who is chairman=
 of the investigative subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committ=
ee, said last night that he was dismayed that even routine shredding had co=
ntinued for so long at Enron.=20
''It is stunning to me that this company, which is being investigated by th=
e Congress, by the Justice Department, by the S.E.C., would get anywhere ne=
ar a shredder without at least seeking the permission of the Justice Depart=
ment and others, so that everyone is clear on what it is that they were shr=
edding,'' Mr. Greenwood said. ''Otherwise they are either incredibly arroga=
nt and out of control, or somebody's incredibly stupid.''=20
As for Andersen, the Energy and Commerce Committee sent the firm a letter d=
emanding details of its internal investigation of document shredding, as we=
ll as information about any consulting work it did on a score of Enron's co=
mplex partnership deals.=20
And computer experts said in interviews that the majority -- perhaps nearly=
 all -- of the destroyed Andersen and Enron materials could be recovered by=
 electronic means.=20
Brian Sierra, a Justice Department spokesman, declined yesterday to comment=
 on whether agents had secured computer hard drives and other electronic me=
dia at Enron. Asked if the F.B.I. had succeeded in preventing any further d=
estruction of potential evidence at the company, he said, ''We certainly ho=
pe so.''=20
Mr. Palmer said that all shredding at Enron had ceased as of Jan. 14, after=
 the first reports of document destruction at Andersen.=20
''A lot of things are stacking up that under normal circumstances we would =
destroy and employees would want us to destroy,'' he said.=20
Last week, when Maureen Castaneda, a former Enron executive, disclosed that=
 the company was continuing to shred documents in its accounting department=
, the company insisted that it had issued several directives stating that '=
'all relevant documents should be preserved in light of pending litigation.=
''=20
But those directives, issued as e-mail messages beginning on Oct. 25, began=
 by specifying only certain materials related to investigations that had co=
me to light. At the end of October, the company issued a broader message te=
lling employees to preserve just about all documents.=20
On Jan. 14, another directive was issued by Enron's general counsel, James =
Derrick Jr., to ''remind all employees, that, as earlier instructed, in vie=
w of the pending and threatened legal proceedings involving the company, no=
 company records, either in electronic or paper form, should be destroyed.'=
'=20
One Enron employee who insisted on not being identified said that on Friday=
 the company had gathered up the shredders on each floor of its headquarter=
s and put them into sealed-off areas, but that the machines had not been re=
moved from the building.=20
At Andersen, the focus was on electronic records. The firm has hired ASR Da=
ta Acquisition and Analysis, a small computer forensics firm, to recover co=
mputer records that may have been deleted or overwritten.=20
Because nearly all paper documents these days are created on computers, inv=
estigators say that recovering the electronic materials is likely to be far=
 more important to sorting out what happened than gathering and reassemblin=
g shredded paper documents.=20
ASR, based in Cedar Park, Tex., declined to describe in any detail its work=
 for Andersen and for Davis, Polk & Wardwell, the law firm that Andersen ha=
s hired to investigate its dealings with Enron.=20
Andrew S. Rosen, president of ASR, said the extent of his inquiry was ''sti=
ll emerging.'' He added that while it was generally easy to recover deleted=
 data, figuring out who deleted it and when -- crucial information for Cong=
ressional and criminal investigators -- is much harder.=20
''This is like an onion,'' Mr. Rosen said. ''The first layers come off easi=
ly, but it gets harder and makes you cry as you go deeper.''=20
Andersen itself is anxious to complete the investigation because the firm's=
 senior management believes that the inquiry will show that potentially ill=
egal activities were confined to a handful of individuals. The firm is stru=
ggling to retain customers amid growing concerns that its reputation has be=
en irreparably damaged.=20
Andersen, based in Chicago, has promised to issue a complete report on its =
Enron dealings in a few days. The Energy and Commerce Committee, in its let=
ter yesterday, asked Andersen to disclose by tomorrow who was being intervi=
ewed as part of the investigation, anyone identified as taking part in the =
destruction of records and the details of Andersen's engagement of Davis, P=
olk.=20
The continuing pressures come at a crucial time for Andersen as it tries to=
 head off client defections.=20
The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that Delta Air Lines would give =
other firms the opportunity this spring to bid for the auditing job now per=
formed by Andersen. Peggy Estes, a Delta spokeswoman, described the process=
 as a normal one for the company.=20
Other big Andersen clients, like Utilicorp United of Kansas City, Mo., and =
International Paper of Stamford, Conn., said they were conducting similar r=
eviews.

Enron's ex-chairman Kenneth Lay says he was in the dark; his subordinates s=
ay he knew of their deals. The company insists accountants approved its off=
-the-books partnerships, but Arthur Andersen says key facts were withheld. =
Creditors are demanding payment; the board of directors is eyeing the stagg=
ering stock profits made by former executives.=20
The finger-pointing has started in earnest now that more than 60 prosecutor=
s and FBI agents swarm over Enron's books, trying to untangle a web of myst=
ery partners and offshore entities that swapped and hedged the Houston-base=
d company's debt.
There is still a vast amount unknown -- and no proof so far of criminal int=
ent by Enron officials -- as the Justice Department ramps up its investigat=
ion of the energy giant's collapse. At this early stage, legal experts and =
lawyers close to the probe say, it may not even be clear who the chief inve=
stigative targets should be.=20
Prosecutors are casting about for the right witnesses to guide them through=
 the complexity, a decision that could prove crucial to their success. They=
 are likely to offer deals with some people in exchange for information and=
 testimony. Of central interest is Lay's role at the company, and that of f=
ormer executives Andrew Fastow and Jeffrey Skilling, principal architects o=
f the hundreds of partnerships.=20
"You have to decide who you want to scapegoat -- who you want to build your=
 case toward," said Donald Langevoort, a securities law professor Georgetow=
n University. The choice goes beyond strictly legal questions, he said, for=
 it helps establish a public face for the inquiry.=20
"Would you rather this be a Kenneth Lay story or the story of a highly ambi=
tious second in command?" Langevoort said. "Who you portray as the bad guy =
is a political decision."=20
Prosecutors have focused their early attention on the shredding of Enron re=
cords at the Arthur Andersen auditing firm, though it's not clear that will=
 lead them to the principal figures at Enron. Bringing an obstruction-of-ju=
stice case against Andersen may be a relatively quick call, lawyers close t=
o the probe said, if it's found that documents were destroyed after officia=
ls knew they could be sought in legal proceedings.=20
Investigators have collected numerous Andersen e-mails and memos dealing wi=
th the retention or destruction of documents. The lead Andersen auditor on =
the Enron account, who was fired by the company for allegedly orchestrating=
 the shredding, has already spent seven hours with the Justice Department's=
 Enron task force telling prosecutors about the role he says higher-ups pla=
yed in the document destruction.=20
Any underlying fraud and securities cases against Enron and Andersen will b=
e much more difficult to sort out. Securities law experts closely tracking =
the Enron saga said possible wrongdoing may include insider trading, materi=
al misrepresentations to the Securities and Exchange Commission or to the p=
ublic in press releases, as well as mail and wire fraud.=20
"Serious questions have been posed, but whether anyone is criminally liable=
 for anything is not known yet," said Joel Seligman, dean of Washington Uni=
versity School of Law. Whether charges are brought, he said, likely rests o=
n information not yet pieced together.=20
"Why did people destroy so many documents?" Seligman said. "What was potent=
ially so unnerving in those documents for Enron and Arthur Andersen? I'd re=
ally like to know the answer to that question."=20
Investigators are poring over reams of company records and trying to recons=
truct what was shredded, both at Enron and Arthur Andersen. Help from insid=
ers would be vital to speed the investigation along and illuminate what can=
't be readily gleaned from company records.=20
Forty FBI accountants have been dispatched to Houston to examine Enron's bo=
oks. But former Enron executives and lawyers close to the case say there is=
 only so much the paper trail will reveal. Heading the investigation is fra=
ud division chief Joshua Hochberg, with coordination of prosecutors across =
the country by Leslie Caldwell, former chief of the securities fraud unit i=
n the U.S. attorney's office in San Francisco.=20
The most pressing unknown at this point may be who the real players are in =
the more than 1,000 Enron-related private partnerships and investment group=
s, many of which were kept off the company books. Those entities hid compan=
y debt and pumped up the company's stock, which Enron executives cashed out=
 for hundreds of millions of dollars.=20
It may take an insider to reveal those names, because they are not on compa=
ny records. Even Enron's lawyers say they don't have them. Similarly, it ma=
y require an inside source to help prosecutors decide if there is a tax eva=
sion case to be made from the partnerships located in the Cayman Islands.=
=20
The prospect of an obstruction case against Arthur Andersen seems to have s=
haken at least one important potential witness loose already. David B. Dunc=
an, Andersen's lead auditor on the Enron account, has met with the Justice =

In October, with shareholders filing lawsuits against Enron and the SEC pre=
paring an inquiry, Temple sent Duncan's group an e-mail reminding him of th=

The firm was hired Oct. 9. It has declined to comment on what advice it gav=

HOUSTON -- Eight weeks after going broke, Enron Corp. selected management c=
onsultant Stephen Cooper as interim chief executive to steer the fallen ene=
rgy giant through Bankruptcy Court, a battery of shareholder lawsuits and a=
 criminal probe.=20
Board members tapped Cooper, a principal of New York-based turnaround firm =
Zolfo Cooper, less than a week after the resignation of Chairman and Chief =
Executive Kenneth L. Lay. The board has not named a new chairman.
Cooper, 55, said Tuesday that "Enron has real businesses with real value." =
But whether he can restructure the firm and handle the complex legal issues=
 to allow it to keep operating remained an open question, analysts said.=20
Enron already has sold a majority stake in its commodities trading business=
, which generated about 90% of the $100 billion in revenue it reported for =
2000. The company also has handed control of its largest pipeline to Housto=
n-based rival Dynegy Inc., and expects to sell its Portland General Electri=
c division for an estimated $3 billion to Northwest Natural Gas Co. Enron's=
 remaining assets, including smaller pipelines and utilities outside the U.=
S., accounted for just a fraction of its revenue.=20
But Cooper, in a voicemail disseminated to Enron's employees, offered an op=
timistic take on the company's current divisions.=20
"The physical assets look to me to be of an enormous advantage here," Coope=
r said. "The regulated assets--the pipelines and generating plants-- provid=
e reliable, steady cash flow and returns. And they provide a very sound, fu=
ndamental base to restructure around."=20
Many experts, however, expressed doubt Cooper will be able to do anything m=
ore than sell off Enron in pieces.=20
"I find it hard to envision a workable entity coming out of bankruptcy here=
," said Andre Meade, a utilities analyst for Commerzbank Securities. "The o=
nly business that really makes sense is a smaller version of what Enron was=
 in the first place--a small gas-pipeline company, but the demands of the i=
ndustry over the last couple of years have basically eliminated all small-p=
ipeline companies."=20
Enron is still seeking a chairman, who must deal with the firm's interests =
in Washington, where it is under attack on Capitol Hill.=20
Steven Panagos, a partner at Zolfo Cooper, said the firm believes Enron has=
 enough cash to continue operations and emerge from bankruptcy. ''It has a =
good customer base, it has a good supplier base and most importantly it has=
 plenty of liquidity,'' he said.=20
Cooper's biggest asset, analysts said, is whatever goodwill he can generate=
 from the creditors' committee. Cooper comes to the company as an outsider-=
-an attribute sought by committee members who pushed for Lay's exit.=20
Cooper began studying company reorganizations while working as an accountan=
t at Touche Ross, now known as Deloitte & Touche. In 1986, he joined a form=
er colleague, Frank Zolfo, to form Zolfo Cooper. Cooper, a graduate of Occi=
dental College in Los Angeles and the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton =
School, declined interview requests Tuesday.=20
As part of the management shuffling announced Tuesday, Enron President and =
Chief Operating Officer Lawrence G. Whalley resigned to take a post at UBS =
Warburg, the Swiss bank that acquired Enron's trading division this month. =
Enron also elevated Chief Financial Officer Jeff McMahon to succeed Whalley=
 and named treasurer Ray Bowen as CFO.=20
Shannon Burchett, president of Dallas-based energy firm specialist Risk Lim=
ited Corp., noted that the promoted executives have not been implicated in =
the scandal, but "if I were a creditor, what I'd like to see is a whole new=
 cast."=20
When Cooper was hired to help rescue troubled Canadian transportation firm =
Laidlaw Inc. in mid-2000, he clearly identified the problem areas, Laidlaw =
Chairman Peter Widdrington said.=20
"He can get deadlines established which initially look unrealistic, but the=
 more he sells the deadline to all involved, the more realistic they become=
," he said.=20
Some analysts noted that Cooper, a veteran of the bankruptcies of Federated=
 Department Stores and other firms, has little experience in the energy fie=
ld.=20
But Widdrington, who has discussed the Enron debacle with Cooper, said, "St=
eve himself is not awed by the task. He thinks essentially the operational =
aspects of the company are still in decent shape."=20
Cooper plans to continue as Laidlaw's vice chairman and chief restructuring=
 officer.=20
Cooper's firm also has been consulting for Polaroid Corp. since last summer=
 and assisted the firm as it prepared to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy pro=
tection in October. Polaroid spokesman Skip Colcord said the company could =
not comment on Zolfo Cooper's performance because Polaroid has not yet emer=
ged from bankruptcy.=20
UCLA bankruptcy law professor Lynn LoPucki said Enron probably can emerge f=
rom Chapter 11, but it probably will do so as a shadow of its former self. =
"There will be a lot of pieces of things that survive from Enron, but they =
aren't in any real sense Enron," he said. "One might carry the Enron name, =
one might be the same legal entity, but they won't be anything like the pre=
-bankruptcy Enron."=20
Michael J. Miller, a former Enron employee and a member of the organization=
 that sued Enron officials Monday for severance and other losses, said he r=
emains hopeful that Cooper can squeeze cash flow from Enron's shell.=20
"Certainly we'll wish this guy well on his endeavors, but we're also going =
to be watching what's going on," Miller said. "We have very high stakes."=

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE ACCOUNTING
Fuzzy Rules Of Accounting And Enron
By FLOYD NORRIS and KURT EICHENWALD

01/30/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 5
c. 2002 New York Times Company

Enron collapsed after reporting strong profits for years, a fact that might=
 be seen as proof that the profits were illusory.=20
But even some accountants who are extremely critical of Enron's accounting =
now say that accounting rules -- including one that was influenced by Enron=
 when it was being written -- give at least a veneer of acceptability to so=
me of the most widely questioned Enron accounting practices.
''It's conceivable that they complied with the rules,'' said Douglas Carmic=
hael, a professor of accountancy at Baruch College. ''Absent a smoking-gun =
e-mail or something similar, it is an issue of trying to attack the reasona=
bleness of the assumptions they made.''=20
The Enron case highlights a weakness in the system that exists to encourage=
 companies to fairly describe their financial health: when accounting rules=
 are written very specifically, clever accountants find ways to get around =
them. When, as in this case, they are written far more generally, proper ac=
counting can be overly reliant on the good faith of companies and auditors =
in applying the rules.=20
As a result, the evidence that the Justice Department and the Securities an=
d Exchange Commission would need to bring fraud charges would be documents =
showing that accountants made estimates they knew to be unreasonable. To fi=
nd such evidence, investigators would review internal memorandums and e-mai=
l messages. But some of those appear to have been destroyed by employees of=
 Enron and its former auditor, Arthur Andersen.=20
The rule in question concerned trading in the energy business. When Enron's=
 energy services division agreed to supply power to a company at a fixed pr=
ice, it made optimistic projections that energy prices would fall enough in=
 the future to guarantee Enron a healthy profit. It was then able to report=
 that profit as soon as it signed the contract -- long before it was clear =
whether its optimistic assumptions would prove to be accurate.=20
''It looked like a license to print money,'' said Glenn Dickson, a former m=
anager in the energy services unit.=20
The decision that energy trading could be accounted for in the way that Enr=
on used was made by the Emerging Issues Task Force, a group under the overs=
ight of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the principal accounting =
rule maker in this country. It did so in 1999, after meeting with Enron, wh=
ich was viewed as the leading company in energy trading.=20
Timothy S. Lucas, the director of research at the F.A.S.B. and the nonvotin=
g chairman of the task force, said Enron's role was to provide information,=
 not to serve as a consultant. He said that, as he recalled, Enron had alre=
ady begun using accounting similar to the accounting the task force wound u=
p endorsing.=20
In retrospect, Mr. Lucas said, the task force may have erred by not requiri=
ng more disclosures about the accounting used, particularly in long-term tr=
ansactions.=20
''There are suggestions for good information that we could add to the discl=
osure that we simply did not think of,'' he said, adding that such disclosu=
res would now be considered.=20
The accounting rule in question required Enron to ''mark to market'' the va=
lue of its energy trades. Where there was an active market, as with stocks =
or publicly traded bonds, that is relatively easy to do and difficult to ma=
nipulate. But where there is no such market, companies were allowed by the =
rules to use their own models to estimate fair value, and to treat that as =
the market value.=20
The mark-to-market technique was used to report profits in some Enron busin=
esses. When its energy services unit signed a power-supply contract with a =
company, it would structure the deal to bring it under those accounting rul=
es. It would then project electricity and natural gas prices for the full t=
erm of the deal, which could last as long as 10 years, according to former =
Enron officials.=20
Many of the contracts covered companies in states that had not yet deregula=
ted their power markets. In those cases, Enron forecast when the states wou=
ld deregulate those markets and then projected what prices would be under t=
he currently nonexistent deregulated market.=20
Then, based on its projections, Enron would calculate its total profit over=
 the life of the contract. After discounting that figure to account for the=
 risk its customer would default and the fact that it would not receive mos=
t payments for years, Enron would book the profit immediately.=20
Mr. Lucas said it had not occurred to him that anyone would use models to t=
ry to forecast energy prices for 10 years, and then use those models to rep=
ort profits, but that the rule had not placed a limit on such trades. He no=
ted that any trade that required assumptions for such a long time would app=
ear to be very risky.=20
A former Enron official has told associates that Arthur Andersen, Enron's a=
uditor, took a number of issues related to Enron's accounting to the task f=
orce. That official said Andersen accountants viewed the company's structur=
ing of financial instruments to be on the cutting edge.=20
Andersen has a seat on the task force, as do each of the four other large a=
ccounting firms. The other members among the 13 on the task force are 4 rep=
resentatives of smaller accounting firms and 4 executives from large compan=
ies. One industry seat is now vacant, after an executive from General Elect=
ric left. The others are held by officials of J. P. Morgan, Exxon Mobil and=
 Dow Chemical.=20
The task force does not disclose who suggests topics, so it is not possible=
 to be certain which Enron issues were considered. But it appears that one =
such issue came in 2000, when the task force addressed the question of what=
 should be done about what appeared to be the application of widely varying=
 approaches by energy traders to determine how much contracts were worth. T=
he task force refused to specify how valuations should be made, leaving com=
panies free to use methods they deemed best.=20
It is not possible to know how much, if at all, Enron would have been restr=
ained from its aggressive accounting had the task force chosen to enact mor=
e detailed rules. But Mr. Carmichael, the Baruch professor, said that an en=
forcement case would be easier to make had the regulators ''set some kind o=
f parameters on the ability to use an internal model.''=20
Absent such clarifying rules, he said, ''you would expect an auditor to com=
e in and challenge the assumptions made.'' He said the investigation ''is l=
ikely to delve into whether the assumptions were reasonable and to what ext=
ent did Arthur Andersen challenge the reasonableness of the assumptions.'' =
Internal Andersen memorandums could be crucial to making a case against the=
 auditor.=20
Edward W. Trott, who in 1998 was a member of the task force representing KP=
MG, a large accounting firm, and who since 1999 has been a member of the F.=
A.S.B., said in an interview that he believed that the right decisions were=
 made on how to account for energy trading.=20
But, he added, ''if you're telling me that somebody who wants to game the s=
ystem can do it, you probably have a lot of evidence to support that.''=20
The accounting for energy services is not the only area in which Enron enga=
ged in accounting that used rules in surprising ways.=20
In one transaction involving a joint venture with Blockbuster, Enron report=
ed large profits even though the venture never attracted more than a few cu=
stomers.=20
''They were extremely clever,'' said Paul Brown, the chairman of the accoun=
ting department at New York University.=20
In the Enron-Blockbuster deal, the two companies set up a pilot project, st=
reaming videos to a few dozen apartments in Portland, Ore., from servers se=
t up in the basement of the building. With that tiny beginning, Enron opene=
d up a partnership, called Braveheart, which raised more than $115 million =
from a bank in exchange for a promise of most of the earnings from the Bloc=
kbuster deal for years.=20
Enron asserted that there was a market in broadband, and that its transacti=
on amounted to one involving the transfer of financial assets. That meant i=
t could report the transaction on a mark-to-market basis, similar to the wa=
y it accounted for the energy trades. It applied its undisclosed model to c=
alculate how much revenue it could report from the transaction, and reporte=
d more than $110 million. Former executives say accountants at Arthur Ander=
sen approved the accounting.=20
''Nobody in the division could comprehend how they got Andersen to sign off=
 on that,'' one former senior executive in the broadband division said. ''I=
t just didn't make any sense. When we heard what they did, everybody's mout=
hs just hung open. We weren't doing business on any scale even close to tho=
se numbers.''=20
The Wall Street Journal has reported that the bank that put up the money ha=
d a guarantee from Enron that it would not lose money. From the bank's poin=
t of view, that may have made the transaction look like a loan, but Enron s=
ays the accounting came under an F.A.S.B. rule covering the securitization =
of assets. Under that rule, accountants say, Enron could still treat the tr=
ansaction as a sale, while reducing the profit to reflect the value of its =
guarantee.=20
An Enron spokesman said the company believed that it had complied with appl=
icable accounting rules. ''I'm sure all of these past transactions will be =
investigated by lots of people,'' he said. ''Why don't we just wait and see=
 what the appropriate authorities decide?''=20
An auditor at one large firm not involved in the Enron case said it was com=
mon for auditors to face creative ways to use accounting rules. ''These iss=
ues can become very complex and very fact-specific,'' he said. ''You have a=
 lot of sharp pencils on Wall Street cooking up transactions to achieve a s=
pecific result. Oftentimes, they understand the accounting rules as well as=
 or better than we do.''=20
Or, as Mr. Brown, the N.Y.U. professor, put it: ''It's the old adage of a F=
.A.S.B. rule. It takes four years to write it, and it takes four minutes fo=
r an astute investment banker to get around it.''

Chart: ''A Complicated Partnership With Debilitating Results'' Investigator=
s are examining some of the deals that improved Enron's balance sheet but w=
ere not part of its financial statements. Here is one in which Enron used a=
 partnership to increase its short-term earnings. 1. Enron signed a multiye=
ar deal with Blockbuster to provide videos over Enron's broadband network. =
Enron hoped to make millions of dollars off the deal. 2. Enron created a pa=
rtnership called Braveheart whose purpose was to get someone to advance Enr=
on the money it expected to make on the deal with Blockbuster. To capitaliz=
e Braveheart, a small amount of money came from outside investors and Enron=
 lent the partnership some stock. 3. An outside investment bank gave Braveh=
eart $115 million in return for a promise that most of the earnings from th=
e Blockbuster deal would go directly to the bank. If the earnings were not =
enough for the bank to recoup its investment, Enron promised that it would =
repay the bank. 4. Enron recorded $110 million of the money invested in Bra=
veheart as profit. Enron did not count all $115 million because, under an a=
ccounting rule, it had to estimate the value of its guarantee to pay back t=
he bank and reduce its revenue by that amount. PROBLEM: Blockbuster backed =
out of the contract, leaving Enron responsible for repaying the bank. (pg. =

CHICAGO -- Think straight, talk straight.=20
That motto was coined by Arthur Edward Andersen, a Northwestern University =
accounting professor who made standing up for what's right the bedrock prin=
ciple of the company he founded 88 years ago.
What John Wayne was to westerns, Andersen was to accounting--demanding abso=
lute honesty and probity from employees and clients alike. Andersen's fasti=
diousness even extended to an employee dress code, which for years required=
 all auditors to wear fedoras on appointments, no matter the weather.=20
Andersen's company grew into the world's fifth-largest accounting firm, wit=
h more than 100,000 corporate clients, $9 billion a year in revenue and 85,=
000 employees around the world. More than that, it helped set ethical stand=
ards for the entire profession.=20
"Arthur Andersen wouldn't put up with anything that wasn't complete, 100% i=
ntegrity," said George R. Catlett, 84, a retired Andersen partner from Evan=
ston, Ill. "If anybody did anything otherwise, he'd fire them. And if clien=
ts wanted him to do something he didn't agree with, he'd either try to chan=
ge them or quit."=20
Today the Chicago-based firm, known simply as Andersen, is an emblem of acc=
ounting misdeeds, the focus of congressional investigations and the butt of=
 presidential jokes.=20
Andersen vouched for financial statements that overstated Enron Corp.'s ear=
nings by $586 million over nearly five years. It has admitted shredding doc=
uments even after the Securities and Exchange Commission began examining En=
ron's collapse, the largest corporate bankruptcy in U.S. history.=20
The scandal threatens the survival of Andersen. And because of the company'=
s prominence, the disclosures are reverberating widely, shaking investors' =
confidence in the profits and losses reported by corporate America. Members=
 of Congress and federal regulators are examining the accounting industry's=
 practices and standards.=20
"The conscience of the industry, essentially, appeared to sell out," said B=
ill Cummings, an accounting professor at Northern Illinois University and a=
 past president of the American Accounting Assn.'s Midwest region. "I think=
 it's pure and simple. It's greed and the allure of the big-money clients."=
=20
Andersen's role in the Enron collapse has revealed the "dark side" of a pro=
fession whose independence has been compromised by the chase for multimilli=
on-dollar fees, Cummings said.=20
Like many accounting firms these days, Andersen wore two hats at Enron. It =
was the company's independent auditor, responsible for ensuring that its fi=
nancial statements were accurate. It was also a financial consultant, helpi=
ng Enron executives devise ways of running the business more profitably and=
 reducing its tax bill.=20
Andersen auditors and consultants occupied a floor of their own in the ener=
gy company's gleaming Houston headquarters. They carried Enron-issued elect=
ronic ID cards, mingled at office picnics--and even wore Enron golf shirts.=
=20
Investigators are looking at Andersen's alleged role in setting up complex =
transactions that inflated Enron's earnings by keeping massive debts off th=
e company's books. Andersen has claimed that its accountants were misled by=
 Enron.=20
Arthur Andersen himself wouldn't have gotten so cozy with a client, to judg=
e from accounts of his career. The son of Norwegian immigrants, Andersen is=
 described as crotchety, opinionated and stubborn.=20
Company lore has it that he lost the prized E.I. du Pont account in the 193=
0s over an interpretation of operating income. Du Pont executives insisted =
on using a more liberal definition that would lump in the value of the comp=
any's large investment in General Motors. Andersen's auditors said no, and =
Andersen backed them up. Du Pont found another auditor.=20
The episode sealed the reputation of Andersen and his firm. The company sti=
ll guards that legacy jealously, said Andersen spokesman Dave Tabolt. "It's=
 an issue that people are concerned about every day," he said.=20
Even now, Andersen employees can be fired for fudging a meal on an expense =
form or lying about their college grade-point averages, say former partners=
.=20
Before accepting a client, Andersen performs background checks on its top e=
xecutives. Andersen auditors are told to summarily "leave the field"--walk =
away from the job--if they meet unreasonable resistance.=20
The firm also has shaped reforms within the accounting profession.=20
Firm Insisted on Tight Central Controls=20
Auditors perform a vital role in the nation's financial system by certifyin=
g the accuracy of profits, losses, debts and other financial data reported =
by companies. They are hired by a company's shareholders and its board of d=
irectors to ensure that financial statements meet federal disclosure standa=
rds.=20
During the 1950s and 1960s, Leonard Spacek, Andersen's successor, openly cr=
iticized the profession for tolerating what he considered a sloppy patchwor=
k of accounting standards that left the investing public no way to compare =
the financial performance of different companies.=20
Spacek's evangelism led to the creation of the Accounting Principles Board,=
 an industry group that established uniform financial accounting and report=
ing standards. In 1973, the board was replaced by the Financial Accounting =
Standards Board, an independent body recognized by the SEC.=20
"They wanted what they considered to be substandard accounting principles .=
 . . to be improved," said Stephen Zeff, an accounting professor and histor=
ian at Rice University. "The accounting establishment back East . . . didn'=
t want the cage rattled. Arthur Andersen rattled the cage."=20
The firm also has set itself apart over the years by cultivating a corporat=
e cohesiveness that borders on clannishness, say experts and former employe=
es.=20
The firm has always insisted on tight central controls and uniformity. Befo=
re computers, Andersen partners around the world worked off a cross-indexed=
 central filing system that listed every client, audit and supporting memos=
.=20
At the firm's campus in rural St. Charles, Ill., about 40 miles west of Chi=
cago, uniformity is stressed to new recruits during an intensive two-week t=
raining course.=20
"They always talked about the one-firm philosophy. . . . No matter where yo=
u are, there was one firm, one philosophy," said Vadim Fridman, 31, a forme=
r Andersen auditor who is now chief financial officer for St. Maartens Spir=
its, a distributor of premium liqueurs in Santa Barbara.=20
Over the years, the practice of accounting changed in ways that Andersen's =
original credo didn't anticipate.=20
Accounting firms now offer lucrative consulting services. Their clients inc=
lude complex businesses with dozens of different divisions. And when compan=
ies go bad, shareholders often target the auditors as well as the managemen=
t.=20
Worries over shareholder lawsuits rippled throughout the firm and shaped ho=
w audits were conducted during the 1990s, former employees say.=20
Auditors use two files to keep records of their work. One is for working pa=
pers that offer supporting documentation for the auditor's findings about a=
 company's finances. The other file is for personal notes, memos and other =
documents. At the end of an audit, papers in the second file are destroyed =
while those in the first are preserved.=20
"The emphasis when I was at Andersen was to take more and more out of the w=
ork file. They wanted fewer and fewer source documents to be in the source =
file, across the board with any client," said a former employee in Houston,=
 who left the firm about a year ago. "The less of that you keep in the file=
, the less likely there is of someone coming back in and finding a smoking =
gun."=20
Equally troublesome, say regulators and critics, was Andersen's habit, comm=
on in the industry, of encouraging its auditors to seek employment with the=
 companies they were auditing. This gave Andersen a network of allies in bi=
g corporations and with it leverage to preserve its auditing and consulting=
 contracts and prospect for new ones.=20
Andersen alumni hold top positions in industries where Andersen has a large=
 share of the auditing business. Andersen is the dominant accounting compan=
y for Texas energy companies. Former Andersen executives hold top corporate=
 slots at such companies as Dynegy, Petroleum Geoservices and Comstock Reso=
urces. All buy auditing services from Andersen, whose contracts are reviewe=
d annually.=20
"We call it practice development," said one Andersen alumnus. "The biggest =
reason to do it is, if there's other [non-audit] work to be done, you want =
to be the first one they call."=20
Case in point: Vadim Fridman. He worked in Andersen's Woodland Hills office=
, auditing mid-size businesses. When he left the company, he wasn't forgott=
en. "They've always maintained contact," he said.=20
Two jobs later, an Andersen executive called him and asked whether he had a=
ny interest in becoming chief financial officer of St. Maartens Spirits, th=
e Santa Barbara company.=20
"They did some [consulting] work for the company and came up with the fact =
they needed a CFO and got me the interview," said Fridman, who ended up get=
ting the job. If St. Maartens ever needs the services of a major accounting=
 firm, he added, "obviously I'd lean toward Andersen. I know how they work.=
"=20
Over the years, Enron hired away dozens of current and former Andersen empl=
oyees--including Sherron S. Watkins, the Enron vice president who eventuall=
y warned of the company's collapse. In 1993, Enron shifted 40 employees to =
Andersen's payroll when it hired the firm, already its outside auditor, to =
take over internal auditing as well.=20
Outside auditors examine transaction records to verify the accuracy of a co=
mpany's financial statements. Internal auditors monitor the effectiveness o=
f the company's internal financial controls.=20
The arrangement meant that Andersen would be essentially policing its own w=
ork, said one former Andersen energy expert.=20
In the case of another Andersen client, Waste Management Inc., the SEC cite=
d such interlocking ties when it levied a $7-million fine against Andersen =
last year, the largest ever imposed by the agency on an accounting firm.=20
In that case, Andersen issued "materially false or misleading audits" that =
overstated Waste Management's net income between 1993 and 1997 by more than=
 $1 billion, the SEC said. The agency also fined four Andersen partners and=
 barred them for varying periods from working on audits of publicly traded =
companies.=20
"Arthur Andersen and its partners failed to stand up to company management =
and thereby betrayed their ultimate allegiance to Waste Management's shareh=
olders and the investing public," said Richard Walker, the SEC's chief of e=
nforcement.=20
The agency disclosed that every chief financial officer and chief accountin=
g officer at Waste Management from 1971 until 1997 was a former Andersen au=
ditor. Altogether, 14 former Andersen employees worked for Waste Management=
 during the 1990s in key financial and accounting positions. Andersen and W=
aste Management paid $220 million to settle several lawsuits over accountin=
g practices.=20
The case was one of the latest in a string of lawsuits and sanctions agains=
t Andersen or its partners for alleged shoddy or misleading work. In April,=
 the SEC sued an Andersen partner for allegedly covering up a massive manag=
ement fraud at appliance maker Sunbeam Inc. Andersen agreed to pay $110 mil=
lion to settle a related shareholder lawsuit.=20
In 1999, the accounting giant paid $90 million to investors and $2.5 millio=
n to Connecticut authorities to settle allegations that it knowingly approv=
ed overly optimistic projections for real estate ventures launched by Colon=
ial Realty, a commercial real estate company.=20
Those settlements have come as Andersen has fought tighter restrictions on =
the accounting industry.=20
Last year, Andersen led the lobbying campaign that ultimately defeated a pr=
oposed SEC rule to force accounting firms to separate their business consul=
ting practice from auditing. Former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt and others a=
rgued that the twin functions posed a temptation for firms to coddle high-p=
aying clients or bury their accounting sins.=20
At Enron, Andersen collected $52 million for its auditing and consulting se=
rvices for 2000.=20
The firm that once defied du Pont is accused of wilting in the face of a du=
bious client that paid it a million dollars a week in fees. "Nobody's going=
 to walk away from that," said Cummings, the Northern Illinois University p=
rofessor.=20
Andersen Chief Executive Joseph Berardino rose to the defense of his firm t=
his week, saying the Enron debacle does not represent the true character of=
 the company and its 85,000 employees.=20
"They want you to know that this is not their Andersen," he said.=20
Berardino conceded the company was losing business. One recent defector is =
Keystone Automotive Industries, a Pomona-based distributor of auto parts. I=
n November, the firm's board voted to hire Andersen after using Ernst & You=
ng as its auditor for 20 years. The board dropped Andersen when the Enron r=
evelations began to roll.=20
"We just felt that there was so much noise surrounding this situation that =
maybe for us the best thing to do was not be second-guessed" by stockholder=
s, said John Palumbo, Keystone's chief financial officer.=20
Among the clients sticking by Andersen for now is Houston-based Swift Energ=
y, an oil and gas exploration firm. Yet Bruce Vincent, Swift's executive vi=
ce president, said he could understand why others might desert the company.=
=20
"The risk to Andersen is almost like that of a bank," said Vincent. "If you=
 have a loss of credibility, you have a run on the bank. If you have enough=
 clients that start switching, they're out of business."

Accounting for Enron: U.S. Probes Enron's Effect on Power Prices
By Jeanne Cummings
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

WASHINGTON -- Federal energy regulators are looking into whether Enron Corp=
. improperly boosted the electricity prices that Californians and other con=
sumers in the Pacific Northwest will be paying for years under long-term en=
ergy contracts, as a private study suggests.=20
Several senators from western states cited the report at a Senate hearing o=
n the impact of Enron's collapse on the energy sector, and Federal Energy R=
egulatory Commission Chairman Patrick Wood said he would open an inquiry in=
to the matter.
Overall, Mr. Wood said he has concluded that the U.S. energy markets absorb=
ed the Enron Dec. 2 bankruptcy filing without major disruption or price spi=
kes, and the debacle shouldn't "sound the death knell for competition." Sti=
ll, the FERC chairman and five other experts said the situation exposed a n=
eed for greater transaction disclosure, particularly in the area of online =
energy trading, Enron's core business.=20
Because Enron's trading wasn't subject to government oversight, the evidenc=
e of price manipulation presented against Enron at the hearing was anecdota=
l.=20
Robert McCullough, a Portland, Ore., energy consultant with clients affecte=
d by last year's energy crisis in the West, conducted research to determine=
 Enron's market dominance in one pricing area -- the area along the Califor=
nia-Oregon border -- by studying data voluntarily made public by other comp=
anies in the same business. His conclusion was that Enron accounted for mor=
e than a 30% share of the business.=20
On Dec. 3, the day after Enron filed for protection from its creditors unde=
r Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the forward markets -- hedge trad=
ing on future energy prices -- on the West Coast fell 30%, Mr. McCullough t=
estified. After ruling out other possible causes for the price drop -- a de=
cline in hydroelectric supply or a spike in fossil-fuel prices -- "the clea=
r implication is that Enron may have been using its market dominance to set=
 forward prices," he said. With Enron out of the market, prices fell.=20
Enron denies any manipulation. "There is political grandstanding going on r=
ight now, and it's been going on against Enron for more than a year," compa=
ny spokeswoman Karen Denne said. "There are a number of factors that drive =
prices, seasonal, weather or demand factors. There have been a number of in=
vestigations into price manipulation and collusion, and none of them found =
Enron to engage in any of those practices."=20
Indeed, Lawrence Makovich, an analyst at Cambridge Energy Research Associat=
es in Massachusetts, told the committee that forward prices dropped markedl=
y throughout the country earlier in the year and the decline identified in =
the study could have been part of that pattern.=20
Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D., Calif.) questioned whether Enron's trading could=
 have contributed to California's struggle last year to recover from an ene=
rgy shortage that led to rolling blackouts, sharply higher prices charged t=
o consumers and big political problems for Democratic Gov. Gray Davis.=20
Mr. Davis is running for re-election this year; he faces a tough Republican=
 field and an electorate that gives more credit to its own conservation in =
ending the state's energy crisis than to the governor's actions.=20
As part of his recovery plan, Mr. Davis signed several expensive, long-term=
 energy contracts. Though none of those agreements was with Enron, official=
s hope to prove that Enron's dealings in the marketplace improperly boosted=
 the overall market price. Such a finding could pave the way for California=
 and other entities to attempt to break their contracts and renegotiate low=
er prices for consumers.=20
Mr. Wood said he has concluded Enron didn't contribute to California's shor=
t-term energy crisis last year. But, he said the allegation about manipulat=
ion of the futures market "is an interesting question." In his review, he s=
aid he would try to determine how big the forward-market is and to what deg=
ree Enron dominated it.=20
He suggested to Ms. Feinstein that California file a formal complaint with =
his agency, which would trigger a formal, 60-day investigation. Ms. Feinste=
in said she would see that it is filed.=20
Mr. Wood also endorsed lawmakers' suggestions that Internet energy trading =
should be subjected to rules for disclosure.=20
Much of Enron's business -- buying and selling of over-the-counter energy d=
erivatives -- was exempted from regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading=
 Commission. Mr. McCullough and other witnesses said online traders should =
face the same disclosure requirements as traditional trading entities, such=
 as the New York Mercantile Exchange.=20
"We need to find out if there is only one person in the [trading] pit," Mr.=
 McCullough said. "If there is, we know to proceed with caution."

The nation's top energy regulator promised yesterday to investigate whether=
 Enron Corp. manipulated long-term energy prices in western states until th=
e day it declared bankruptcy last month.=20
Pat Wood III, chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, made th=
e pledge during a congressional hearing in which several senators voiced co=
ncern about Enron's dominance of electronic trading of financial instrument=
s tied to energy. Such trading is unregulated.
This would be the second time FERC has looked at Enron's role in setting we=
stern energy prices. During the year-long California energy crisis that end=
ed last summer, the agency found no evidence that energy companies, includi=
ng Enron, had manipulated the short-term market for electricity, although i=
t found serious flaws in the market structure.=20
"There are issues about whether Enron was manipulating the West Coast energ=
y markets," said Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.). "It's important not just to ratep=
ayers on the West Coast, but it goes to the issue of the confidence America=
ns need to have in the energy market. We need to lift the veil of secrecy a=
bout how energy is bought and sold in this country."=20
The hearing by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee was meant =
to explore the impact that Enron's collapse in December had on energy marke=
ts.=20
Robert McCullough, an energy consultant whose clients include utilities in =
the Northwest, testified that the price of unregulated financial energy con=
tracts on the West Coast dropped 30 percent on Dec. 3, the day after Enron =
filed for bankruptcy. This suggests, he said, that "Enron may have been usi=
ng its market dominance" to set long-term energy prices.=20
Wood, a former Texas utility commissioner backed by longtime Enron chairman=
 Kenneth L. Lay for the federal job, told lawmakers that Enron's demise did=
n't damage the nation's energy-trading industry or disrupt the supply of en=
ergy.=20
Enron, meanwhile, named Stephen F. Cooper, a corporate turnaround expert, a=
s its interim chief executive, replacing Lay, who resigned last week.=20
In other Enron-related news:=20
* A House subcommittee leading the investigation of document shredding by E=
nron's outside auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, announced it will turn its foc=
us to Enron at hearings next week. Merrill Lynch & Co. confirmed that some =
of its senior executives invested in one of the controversial Enron partner=
ships involved in the company's unraveling last fall.=20
* More than 400 past and present Enron workers asked the bankruptcy judge t=
o appoint an official panel to give them greater say in the case, saying on=
e worker representative on the 15-member creditors' committee was inadequat=
e.=20
* Enron said its investigation of papers shredded at the company's Houston =
headquarters after it received subpoenas from federal investigators had tur=
ned up no evidence that any relevant materials were destroyed. "Based on ou=
r investigation so far, we are unaware of any improper shredding of documen=
ts," Enron attorney Robert Bennett said last night. The FBI is continuing t=
o interview everyone at Enron headquarters who had a role in shredding docu=
ments. An Enron spokesman confirmed that the company continued shredding do=
cuments until recently but maintained that they were payroll and other pers=
onnel records unrelated to the investigation.=20
* Police in Sugar Land, Tex., said they could not disclose the contents of =
the suicide note written by J. Clifford Baxter, a former senior Enron execu=
tive, without the permission of the Texas attorney general.=20
At the Senate hearing, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and others said the=
 danger that Enron posed occurred before it collapsed, from its success in =
lobbying state and federal regulators against disclosure of energy prices a=
nd supplies.=20
That secrecy has allowed companies to dominate markets and "price-gouge" co=
nsumers, Feinstein said. Enron's large role in trading financial energy con=
tracts coupled with the company's control over "50 percent to 70 percent" o=
f natural gas going into California gave the company the tools it needed to=
 set prices unfairly, she said.=20
In December 2000, Congress exempted such "derivatives" contracts -- which a=
re used to hedge against price swings but also to speculate on price change=
s -- from regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Sen. Jeff=
 Bingaman (D-N.M.), chairman of the committee, said the Enron fiasco shows =
the need for greater public disclosure about energy derivatives and how the=
y are traded.=20
James E. Newsome, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, sai=
d that if Congress decides that energy derivatives need more oversight, his=
 commission should provide that oversight.=20
In announcing new hearings next Tuesday and Wednesday, the House Commerce s=
ubcommittee on oversight and investigations sent out a new round of letters=
 requesting documents. Among them was one to Enron seeking copies of a repo=
rt a New York law firm prepared last summer on problems with partnerships t=
hen headed by Enron's chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. Fastow sold t=
hose interests last July 31.=20
The Internet magazine Salon reported last week that Jordan Mintz, an Enron =
attorney, had asked the Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson law firm for =
an opinion on the partnerships. Enron sources confirmed that an opinion was=
 prepared but would not provide details of its contents.=20
A Merrill Lynch spokesman said, in response to a report by Bloomberg News, =
that executives at the brokerage firm invested in the LJM2 partnership, one=
 of the private entities run by Fastow.=20
"The investment partnership was reviewed and deemed appropriate by parties =
on all sides of the transaction," the spokesman said. "Consistent with comm=
on industry practice, it was offered to qualified external as well as inter=
nal investors, and this is not a conflict of interest."=20
The partnership was one of many that helped Enron keep debt off its books -=
- debt that investors, including those following the Merrill Lynch analysts=
' recommendations on Enron, were not aware of. The spokesman said the Merri=
ll Lynch investors in the partnership didn't tell the analysts about their =
investment.=20
Meanwhile, the Federal Election Commission said it was unclear what would b=
ecome of the $430,000 remaining in Enron's political action committee coffe=
rs at the end of 2001. The PAC made donations last fall to several members =
of Congress who are now investigating the company. "We have never had to ad=
dress anything like this before," said Kelly Huff, a spokeswoman for the el=

NEW YORK -- J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. needs to find a new lawyer in its high-=
profile legal battle to force insurers to honor $1.1 billion in Enron Corp.=
 surety bonds.=20
A federal judge on Monday disqualified Davis Polk & Wardwell because the Ne=
w York law firm also represents Chubb Corp., the parent company of Federal =
Insurance Co., an insurer named as a defendant in the suit. U.S. District J=
udge Jed S. Rakoff wrote in a nine-page opinion that Davis Polk has "entang=

he same time.
On Dec. 11, Davis Polk helped Chubb file papers with the Securities and Exc=

Federal Insurance surety bonds related to Enron affiliates, the judge noted=
. On the same day, Davis Polk, acting for J.P. Morgan Chase, filed the laws=

 insurance companies over the surety bonds.=20
"It is doubtful that Chubb would have approved such wording [on the SEC fil=

A Davis Polk spokesman said: "We are obviously disappointed by the court's =
decision. We believed that we had good grounds to proceed on behalf of J.P.=
 Morgan Chase bank under the applicable ethical standards, but we will of c=
ourse abide by the decision of the court." Judge Rakoff ordered all proceed=
ings in the case on hold for two weeks to allow J.P. Morgan time to obtain =
new counsel or appeal the decision. J.P. Morgan Chase declined to comment.

Burden of Doubt: Stocks Take a Beating As Accounting Worries Spread Beyond =
Enron --- Investors Ignore Good News About Economy; Banks Are a Focus of Se=
lling --- `A Big Haircut' for Some
By E.S. Browning and Jonathan Weil
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

It's not the economy anymore, stupid. It's the accounting.=20
Yesterday was the day that the smoldering corporate accounting scandal, whi=
ch started with Enron Corp. and quickly spread to Arthur Andersen LLP, reac=
hed a wide group of U.S. companies and seriously singed their stock prices.=
 Accounting problems surfaced in sectors ranging from banking to oil, promp=
ting fears of new mini-Enrons and spurring a sell-off of shares at the slig=
htest whiff of such trouble.
As a result, despite broadly upbeat economic news, the stock market took a =
tumble, with shares falling to their lowest levels in three months.=20
Signs of toughening stances by auditors and regulators emerged, raising que=
stions as to how many more corporate managements will be forced to restate =
their earnings and abandon cozy accounting treatments that easily passed mu=
ster a few months ago.=20
Stocks in the banking industry, for instance, fell sharply following word t=
hat PNC Financial Services Group, a Pittsburgh-based banking group, was res=
tating its 2001 results. Analysts immediately fretted that many other banks=
 could be hit. In addition, pipeline company Williams Cos. delayed an earni=
ngs report to examine the impact of commitments to a former unit, and congl=
omerate Tyco International Ltd. suffered on news that it had made a $20 mil=
lion payment to an outside director and to a charity he controls. After the=
 markets closed, Houston energy producer Anadarko Petroleum Corp. announced=
 it made a billion-dollar mistake in the way it calculated the value of its=
 domestic oil and gas properties for the quarter ended Sept. 30, citing fau=
lty tax assumptions.=20
The upshot: Tyco was down almost 20% for the day, PNC fell more than 9%, an=
d Williams fell more than 22%. Together, the three lost $21 billion in mark=
et value in one day.=20
On a day in which the big-picture economic news was good -- and other corpo=
rate earnings were, in fact, up -- the Dow Jones Industrial Average neverth=
eless fell 2.51%, or 247.51 points, to 9618.24, its lowest level since Oct.=
 29. Trading volume was the highest it has been since the week the markets =
reopened after the September terrorist attacks.=20
Behind the frantic trading is a watershed development in American business:=
 The fundamentals of the accounting profession have been called into questi=
on. Where two decades ago, accountants were still held in high esteem, now =
they rank in public opinion polls below politicians and even journalists. A=
n opinion letter from a Big Five accounting firm, once viewed as a trusted =
seal of approval, now may not carry the imprimatur of authority.=20
Some of the sell-off could be an overreaction. The U.S. continues to have o=
ne of the world's most rigorous accounting systems, and most companies clea=
rly function within the rules.=20
But just as investors ultimately turned away from overhyped tech stocks dur=
ing the Internet bust, in the wake of Enron they clearly have no stomach fo=
r any hint of accounting irregularities.=20
"The market has little or no tolerance for any of the unknowns associated w=
ith . . . accounting right now," said Matthew Johnson, head of U.S. stock t=
rading at New York brokerage firm Lehman Brothers. "It is just bar-the-door=
s."=20
Amid a growing sense that bull-market excess made companies push accounting=
 rules to the limit in the late 1990s, regulators, accounting firms and rat=
ing agencies have become more sensitive than ever -- raising the specter of=
 more bombshells. The Securities and Exchange Commission, for instance, las=
t week reminded public companies of the need to clearly disclose financial =
transactions, including off-balance-sheet financings, in their forthcoming =
annual reports. Moody's Investors Service Inc., the big credit-rating agenc=
y, has demanded that more than 4,000 bond issuers provide new information o=
n off-balance-sheet arrangements that could involve financial risks. And au=
diting firms are taking a tougher stance with clients.=20
In the case of PNC, the bank said it planned to restate its numbers in the =
wake of an accounting probe by the Federal Reserve and the SEC.=20
"What is underlying this whole thing is a huge discrepancy concerning what =
really constitutes earnings," said Henry Herrmann, chief investment officer=
 at mutual-fund group Waddell & Reed in Overland Park, Kan. "The market is =
giving a big haircut to companies whose earnings numbers raise questions in=
 investors' minds."=20
Several of those companies said the attention is unfair. "Clearly we are in=
 an environment where people are intensely skeptical of Corporate America,"=
 said Dennis Kozlowski, Tyco's chairman and chief executive, who said his c=
ompany's payment to the director was "appropriate" and had been fully discl=
osed in Tyco's proxy statement. "Obviously, we believe the reaction in our =
stock price was unjustified."=20
Williams executives have in the past said their accounting practices are mo=
re open than Enron's. A spokesman said yesterday the company has "the finan=
cial capability" to make good on its commitments to its former unit.=20
Investors also suspect that organizations assigned to make the rules, like =
the Financial Accounting Standards Board, often act more like protectors of=
 the industry they watch. That, in part, is why Enron, like so many other c=
ompanies, was allowed to exploit lax rules for "special-purpose entities" t=
hat allowed it to keep tens of billions of dollars of debt off its balance =
sheet. Losses related to this debt contributed to Enron's abrupt downfall.=
=20
The consequences of those suspicions could be huge, both for the stock mark=
et and the accounting profession. Politicians and investors, for instance, =
are openly questioning whether the accounting industry should be allowed to=
 continue regulating itself.=20
The recession that began last year is helping drive accounting issues out o=
f the woodwork. Analysts say it is a lot easier for companies to hide poor =
performance through aggressive accounting during good times -- when stocks =
are rising and the economy is booming -- than it is when the market is in t=
he tank and the economy is slowing down.=20
When bear markets hit, companies like Tyco, which had relied on high-priced=
 stock acquisitions to fuel their growth, no longer have the currency to ke=
ep buying other companies. And while investors and analysts often are willi=
ng to let things slide during good times, they want real answers and inform=
ation when stocks are going down and wiping out their portfolios.=20
Enron has added an unsettling new dimension. As complex and opaque as its f=
inancial statements were, what many investors are starting to recognize is =
that they don't understand the financial statements of many other companies=
 in which they have big stakes. Neither, they fear, do the rating agencies =
ranking the quality of their debt or the Wall Street analysts and brokers w=
ho are recommending the stocks.=20
Restatements have been on the rise for more than a decade, and the SEC now =
has more accounting-fraud cases on its hands than ever before. According to=
 a study last year by the research arm of Financial Executives Internationa=
l, a trade group in Morristown, N.J., there were 464 financial restatements=
 by companies from 1998 through 2000 -- more than in the previous 10 years =
combined.=20
Enron, however, was the financial markets' equivalent of the perfect storm =
-- a debacle so huge on so many different levels that it demanded the natio=
n's attention. What's more, it exposed the degree to which hundreds of othe=
r companies' accounting practices are similar in certain ways to Enron's.=
=20
The large accounting firms, such as Andersen, say the problem lies not with=
 their conduct and priorities but with weaknesses in generally accepted acc=
ounting principles themselves. Likewise, they say, if only they could be de=
legated the job of fixing the system, then it could be fixed.=20
Until investors conclude it is fixed, though, the market may have to brace =
for more days like yesterday.=20
In addition to the declines in the Dow Jones industrials, the broad Standar=
d & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 2.86%, or 32.42 points. The Nasdaq Compo=
site Index, dominated by technology stocks, fell 2.62%, or 50.92 points, to=
 1892.99, leaving it down 3% for the year.=20
In a sign of how much times have changed, the normally staid banking group =
fell far harder yesterday than technology stocks, which ordinarily are the =
market's most volatile group. A widely watched index of the nation's major =
bank stocks compiled by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, for example, fell =
more than 5% on the day, while the exchange's index of the nation's main co=
mputer-chip stocks, which has been one of the market's most volatile groups=
 in recent weeks, fell only 2.4%.=20
The worry wasn't just that accounting issues could cause more high-profile =
bankruptcies, although that certainly was on some people's minds. It was al=
so that accounting issues could hold down earnings growth by forcing compan=
ies to use more-conservative accounting practices.=20
Recalling that Enron investors suffered if they held onto the energy-tradin=
g company's stock until they understood how bad the accounting problem was,=
 shareholders in other companies tarred by accounting questions tended to s=
ell first and ask questions later.=20
Money flowed out of stocks and toward the relative safety of Treasury bonds=
, pushing government securities' prices up sharply. The government bonds ro=
se despite stronger economic news, which normally would push bonds down bec=
ause it would spur expectations that the Federal Reserve has finished cutti=
ng interest rates. The 10-year Treasury note rose 26/32, or $8.125 for each=
 $1,000 invested. Its yield, which moves inversely to price, fell to 4.97%.=
=20
The renewed preoccupation with accounting problems shifted investors' atten=
tion away from the two-day Federal Reserve meeting on monetary policy that =
is to wind up this afternoon. After cutting its interest-rate targets 11 co=
nsecutive times in an effort to stimulate the economy, the Fed is widely ex=
pected to leave rates unchanged, the first time it has done that in more th=
an a year. The Fed is expected to announce its decision and issue comments =
on the economy at about 2:15 p.m. EST today.=20
But now, investors said, they want to see the economy actually respond, in =
the form of improving corporate performance.=20
"The concern is that these accounting issues are going to cause the economy=
 to go into a double-dip" recession, in which the recovery stalls and the e=
conomy sinks a second time, Lehman's Mr. Johnson said. "There is a concern =
that there is more truth serum that has to be taken by companies."=20
In addition, some investors still caution that the economic recovery is wea=
ker than many investors think.=20
"There has been a modest bounce in economic activity," Greg Jensen of Westp=
ort, Conn., money-management firm Bridgewater Associates said in a report t=
o clients, but "at this point, all we have done is return to Sept. 10 level=
s. Prior to Sept. 11, we described the economy as `post-bubble and vulnerab=
le,' and it still is."=20
What would spook both the stock and bond markets would be any hint from the=
 Fed that it sees a risk of inflation, which would require it to raise its =
target interest rates.=20
As concerns have spread in recent weeks about an Enron effect on the broade=
r market, some policy makers have started to fret.=20
"This runs the risk of truly undermining business and consumer confidence,"=
 New Jersey Democratic Sen. Jon Corzine said at a Senate Budget Committee h=
earing last week. The senator, a former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs & Co.,=
 wondered aloud "about whether the concerns and the issues that have been r=
evealed here are not more broadly applicable in the economy," and could the=
n "lead to a rise in the cost of capital, lead to serious concerns about fo=
reigners wanting to continue to invest in America in the way that they have=
 supported us with regard to our foreign trade balance."=20
Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan dismissed those worries at the same hearing, ho=
wever. Still, Mr. Greenspan suggested that the fallout could transform the =
way investors and companies interact.=20
"The reaction, I think, is going to create a really major rethinking in a l=
ot of people about whether there is a spin game going on with respect to in=
formation coming out of business into the investment community," the Fed ch=
airman said. "I think we're going to find there's going to be a good deal l=
ess of that and that the old issue of competing for reputation is going to =
re-emerge," he added. "And I think you're going to find at some point that =
there are going to be people out there who are going to say that `our accou=
nts you can rely on.' And that probably will increase their price-earnings =
ratios."

The shadow of Enron Corp.'s collapse spread yesterday to Williams Cos., an =

Executives at Tulsa-based Williams said they would need several weeks to fu=

essive approach by ratings agencies in the wake of Enron's collapse. Enron =
had kept billions of dollars in liabilities off its balance sheet through p=
artnerships and other financial arrangements.=20
"People began doing a better, more fuller job examining all our liability,"=
 said Williams spokesman Jim Gipson. Gipson added that the additional scrut=
iny ultimately should have a positive impact on the industry and investors,=
 as people better understand the financial condition of companies.=20
News of Williams's postponed earnings announcement was not received well by=
 investors yesterday. Shares of the company fell $5.36, or 22.2 percent, to=
 $18.78.=20
Gipson said Williams has consistently disclosed the $1.4 billion in guarant=
eed loans to the former subsidiary along with an additional $1 billion in g=
uarantees related to leases for fiber-optic cable and the Williams Communic=
ations headquarters. But the company did not count the obligations as liabi=
lities, something that credit-rating agencies have said they may now requir=
e.=20
"Recent events have caused us to reevaluate those obligations," Williams ch=
ief executive Steven Malcolm said in a conference call yesterday. Among the=
 events Malcolm cited was the broad downturn in the telecommunications indu=
stry, including Monday's announcement by Global Crossing Ltd., an internati=
onal fiber-optics firm, that it had filed for bankruptcy because it was una=
ble to continue paying interest on more than $12 billion in debt.=20
Some analysts said Enron's collapse, which has already hurt several energy =
firms, may now reverberate through the weak telecommunications sector, wher=
e many companies are struggling under mountains of debt.=20
"Rating agencies are more likely to downgrade a company or take a conservat=
ive view of the company than they did 12 months ago," said Drake Johnstone,=
 an analyst with Davenport & Co. "A lot of these [telecommunications] compa=
nies are clinging to the edge, and it doesn't take a hell of a lot to push =
them into bankruptcy."=20
Shares of Williams Communications, which traded as high as $57 in 1999, fel=
l 29 cents yesterday, or almost 18 percent, to $1.34.=20
Corporate credit firms threatened to strip the Williams energy company of i=
ts investment-grade rating unless it finds a way to resolve questions of li=
ability related to its investment in Williams Communications, Gipson said.=
=20
The company had already announced a plan on Dec. 19 to firm up its balance =
sheet by reducing its capital expenditures from $4 billion to $3 billion. I=
t also said then that it may sell $250 million in core assets and an additi=
onal $1 billion in equity. The combined savings and increased revenue would=
 be used to offset any liabilities related to the Williams Communications d=
ebt.=20
Williams is among several energy companies that have invested in telecommun=
ications in recent years. Enron spent more than $1 billion buying 18,000 mi=
les of fiber-optic lines with a goal of creating a market among companies t=
hat would bid for rights to transmit data and voice traffic.=20
But Enron was hardly the only company to invest in fiber-optic lines, and a=
 glut of capacity quickly developed. It is that glut that eventually sank o=
ther companies, including Global Crossing, which invested billions on the b=
et that demand would outstrip supply for fiber-optic capacity. Instead, the=
 opposite proved true, and tens of thousands of miles of fiber-optic lines =
now lie unused.=20
Williams, founded in 1908 and publicly traded since 1957, hoped to take adv=
antage of its old-economy business by installing fiber-optic cable along it=
s gas pipeline rights of way. Eventually, the company completed a 33,000-mi=
le network of its own, which is now a leading supplier of fiber-optic capac=
ity to the media industry. Hundreds of television stations and film product=
ion companies use Williams's lines to send video footage around the nation =
and the world.

One of 30 former Enron Corp. employees who took an exhausting 25-hour bus r=

"I voted for him; my whole family voted for him. We think he's doing a good=

The former employees, organized for their trip by the Rev. Jesse Jackson an=

. . . And the Enron Pundits

The debate about campaign finance reform can be boiled down to one question=
: What exactly are corporations buying when they give millions of dollars t=
o politicians?=20
Now, there's some heated talk about journalistic finance reform -- that is,=
 what are corporations buying when they lard their payrolls with prominent =
media folks? And should columnists and commentators be taking cash from com=
panies such as Enron, about which they later find themselves delivering str=
ong opinions?
The contretemps has exposed just how cozy the relationships are between som=
e in the pundit class and the corporate world, in which $50,000 can change =
hands for what the average cubicle dweller would consider remarkably little=
 work.=20
The journalists involved have, with varying degrees of candor, disclosed th=
eir Enron ties while writing about the collapse of America's seventh-larges=
t corporation. But they find themselves facing the sort of hostile question=
s usually reserved for committee chairman who do legislative favors for big=
-time donors.=20
I've been critical of journalistic buckraking since the mid-1990s, when I w=
rote about a $30,000 speech that Sam Donaldson had given to an insurance gr=
oup. The gilded trail of corporate honoraria quickly led to such luminaries=
 as David Brinkley, Robert Novak, David Gergen, Cokie Roberts, Christopher =
Matthews, Larry King, Mark Shields, Fred Barnes, George Will and Michael Ki=
nsley, who memorably said: "I didn't do it for years, but it became more so=
cially acceptable." King likened it to "white-collar crime." Many refused t=
o discuss it on grounds they weren't public officials.=20
The issue began to fade as a number of news organizations, including ABC an=
d NBC, banned the practice. (The Washington Post had long barred honoraria =
from corporations or trade groups that lobby Congress.)=20
But now, for those who took Enron money, there's no place to hide, the burg=
eoning scandal having replaced the war as the Beltway's reigning obsession.=
 And the journalists involved (with one exception) have whacked Kenneth Lay=
 & Co. pretty hard.=20
New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, who got $50,000 from an Enron adviso=
ry board before joining the Times, blamed the criticism on an "effort by co=
nservatives to sling Enron muck toward their left." Unfortunately for this =
argument, most of the Enron journalists are free-marketeers on the right.=
=20
Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan, who received $25,000 to $50,000=
 for speechwriting help, told me: "I don't regret having done the work -- i=
t was honest work, honestly done, hard work too, reported on my taxes, not =
hidden in any way. . . . But my feeling is: I have to talk about my experie=
nce in order to talk about Enron, and I have to talk about Enron because I =
have strong feelings about what they did."=20
Lawrence Kudlow of CNBC and National Review said that he should have disclo=
sed earlier that he'd gotten $50,000 for consulting and research, but he al=
so said that he's tougher on the energy company because he feels betrayed.=
=20
Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol, who received $100,000 from the advisor=
y board, sees nothing wrong with such work. His role was disclosed in a Sta=
ndard piece by another Enron beneficiary, contributing editor Irwin Stelzer=
, who praised Lay and Enron for "leading the fight for competition."=20
Other than Stelzer, who failed to disclose the arrangement in articles for =
the British press, the other writers can boast that their criticism of Enro=
n demonstrates they can't be swayed by mere money. Of course, had Enron not=
 suffered a spectacular meltdown, we likely would not have known about most=
 of these financial ties -- and still don't know about other such moonlight=
ing.=20
The Enron pundits have put themselves in a weird box. If they recused thems=
elves and wrote nothing, as some critics suggest, then the company would in=
 effect have bought their silence. By writing on Enron, they risk the appea=
rance of biting the hand that fed them just to flaunt their journalistic co=
urage.=20
Perhaps what rankles most is the notion that Enron was trying to do what it=
 did with George W. Bush, John Ashcroft, Joe Lieberman, Lawrence Lindsey, R=
alph Reed and about half of official Washington -- making an investment tha=
t could pay off later on. What, after all, did the commentators do for Enro=
n? "This was an advisory panel that had no function that I was aware of," K=
rugman told his newspaper. Exactly.=20
It's hard for journalists who work for big companies, write books and appea=
r on television to avoid all conflicts these days. But many of these commen=
tators wax indignant when politicians of all stripes appear to be doing the=
 bidding of those who fill their campaign coffers. For media people to line=
 up at the same corporate trough is just asking for trouble.=20

Greedy Liars? The Enron Scandal; TheBIGStory An Occasional Look at Stories =
Everyone Is Talking About

Copyright 2002, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved

Last year Enron was the seventh largest U.S. company. Today it's bankrupt. =
Thousands of Enron workers have lost their jobs. Some have even lost their =
life savings. And maybe it didn't have to happen.=20
What went wrong? It's a story so complicated that investigators have just s=
tarted unraveling the mystery. But lots of people think there's something p=
retty simple at the bottom of the Enron mess: lies and greed. John Kelly ta=
kes a look at the scandal.
The Birth of Enron=20
Enron started life in Texas as a company that owned underground pipes and s=
old natural gas to power plants. Then Enron expanded into all sorts of othe=
r businesses. It sold natural gas, electricity, Internet connections and mo=
re. It bought other companies and grew larger and larger.=20
Enron looked like a success, a company people wanted to work at and invest =
in. But then . . .=20
Secrets & Lies=20
Companies are allowed to keep some secrets -- the recipe for a best-selling=
 soft drink, for example. But there are some secrets they can't keep, espec=
ially if they're a "publicly held" company.=20
Publicly held means that the public can buy stock, or ownership, in the com=
pany. When the company does well and makes a profit, the value of the stock=
 goes up. But when a company is badly run, the stock value goes down. By st=
udying information provided by a company, people can decide which stocks th=
ey should buy and which ones they should sell.=20
For years everyone thought Enron was one of the best companies in the Unite=
d States. If you bought one piece -- or "share" -- of Enron stock in Januar=
y 1998 it cost you about $20. By September 2000 that same share was worth n=
early $90.=20
Enron's secret, officials say, is that it wasn't a well-run company. It was=
 losing money, not making money. And to hide that fact it created dozens of=
 partnerships. These secretive side deals allowed Enron to hide its debt. T=
he idea seemed to be to convince people that it wasn't Enron that was in tr=
ouble, it was these other groups. The problem: Those other groups were Enro=
n. And Enron was like a shaky building about to collapse.=20
Rich Bosses, Poor Employees=20
As Enron's stock increased in value, the people who ran the company got ric=
her and richer. They often were paid in stock, in addition to their salarie=
s. Regular employees did well too -- at least on paper. They were allowed t=
o buy Enron stock to save for retirement. In fact, it was encouraged: Last =
October, Kenneth Lay, the head of Enron, sent an e-mail to workers saying t=
hat the stock was a great deal and the company was going strong.=20
But it wasn't going strong. And Enron's bosses seemed to know that. For yea=
rs they'd been selling some of their stock. It was almost as if they knew t=
he value was going to drop. And it did drop. Last fall, when Enron announce=
d that it had earned $586 million less over the past four years than it had=
 said at first, the stock value plummeted. It was a good time to sell Enron=
 stock.=20
At around that time, though, Enron employees weren't allowed to sell their =
stock. They were frantic as they watched their life savings drip away. But =
company bigwigs were allowed to sell their stock.=20
Today stock once valued at about $90 a share is worth about 45 cents.=20
Politicians' Problems=20
Enron didn't only spend money buying pipelines and other companies. It also=
 donated money to Republicans and Democrats to help those politicians pay f=
or their election campaigns. This is legal, but a lot of people think it sm=
ells fishy. They worry that a senator or representative who got a lot of mo=
ney from Enron might hesitate to do anything that would upset the huge comp=
any.=20
Think about it this way: If someone gave you a $10,000 "gift," would you th=
ink they expected something in return?=20
President Bush received money from Enron. So did Attorney General John Ashc=
roft while running for re-election to the U.S. Senate. (Ashcroft, now in ch=
arge of prosecuting companies that cheat the public, has said he won't be i=
nvolved in the Enron investigation.)=20
Because of these connections, and the fact that such a big company failed a=
nd so many workers lost their jobs and their money, people are wondering wh=
at the Enron investigation will reveal.

Regardless of what may or may not have happened in those energy meetings, t=

"Enron Vision Proved Costly to Firm, State" (Jan. 28) portrays Enron as the=

s you allege Enron wanted. The joke of 1996 was that AB 1890 was "re-regula=

You imply that Enron was the most influential lobbyist. In fact, California=
 utilities like Southern California Edison contributed large sums of money,=
 personnel and influence during that period, not to create the "perfect mar=
ket" but to create legislation that would allow them to recapture 100% of t=
heir stranded assets. Many lobbyists were heavily involved in that legislat=
ive process, trying to secure legislated benefits for other narrow constitu=
ents. For state Sen. Steve Peace (D-El Cajon) to now say, in effect, "Enron=

 opened the energy system to manipulation and price gouging. It drained the=
 state's resources from the three publicly traded utilities--as well as the=
 state's surplus--to the bone.=20
Hopefully, the Enron bankruptcy will slow down the bullet train of privatiz=

Attorney general's opinion is sought
Media has asked to see suicide note=20

SUGAR LAND -- The Police Department says it will get an attorney general's =
ruling -- a process that could take months -- before releasing the suicide =
note written by a former Enron executive whose body was found in his car Fr=
iday.=20
More than 60 news organizations, including the Chronicle, have asked the Su=
gar Land police to release the note written by John Clifford Baxter under t=
he Texas Public Information Act.=20
"The Police Department has completed its review of the note for investigati=
ve and testing purposes and, at this stage, does not have any objections to=
 the release of its contents," said Joe Morris, Sugar Land's city attorney.=
=20
However, Morris said there are confidentiality and right-to-privacy issues =
and that the city wants a legal opinion from the Texas attorney general's o=
ffice before releasing the note.=20
Rob Wiley, a Houston lawyer familiar with public-information law, said such=
 requests are decided on a case-by-case basis.=20
"The general criteria seem to be, is there an overwhelming public interest,=
 and whether that outweighs any privacy or investigative interest that migh=
t be present," Wiley said.=20
Usually, he said, a suicide note is personal and releasing it serves no ser=
ious public interest.=20
However, in some cases, usually involving the suicide of a public official =
or newsworthy person, the attorney general has ruled in favor of releasing =
suicide notes.=20
Wiley added that the attorney general could rule that parts of the note are=
 private and others public.=20
When someone requests information from a Texas government agency, the agenc=
y has 10 business days to provide the information or seek an attorney gener=
al's opinion on whether it is public information. Sugar Land officials rece=
ived the first requests for the Baxter note Friday afternoon.=20
The attorney general then has 45 business days to make a ruling, although t=
hat period can be extended by 10 business days.=20
Officials expect to send the request to Austin in a few days, said city spo=
kesman Doug Adolph.=20
Baxter, 43, a former vice chairman of Enron, was found shot to death in his=
 Mercedes-Benz sedan, which was parked in the 5800 block of Palm Royale. A =
.38-caliber pistol was found in the car. His funeral is scheduled for today=
 in his hometown, Amityville, N.Y.=20
Although the Harris County medical examiner has ruled the death a suicide, =
Sugar Land police say their investigation is continuing.=20
But that does not mean the Police Department disagrees with the ruling, Pol=
ice Chief Earnest Taylor said Tuesday.=20
"As is the case with most routine investigations, other forensic tests such=
 as ballistic tests, fingerprinting and hair and fiber analysis must be per=
formed," he said. "These and other tests are thoroughly and methodically ev=

0 or so classmates to drinks at Giacomo Jack's, a nearby restaurant.=20
But those who grew up playing football and climbing trees with Mr. Baxter, =
43, a former vice chairman of Enron, said they were shocked to learn that h=
e committed suicide in Texas last week. Many of his friends said they had a=
lso not realized the extent of his success: that since leaving Amityville, =
a village on Long Island's South Shore, Mr. Baxter had climbed to a top pos=
t at one of the country's largest companies.
''He looked great; he was in shape; he looked young for his age,'' said Tim=
 Schultz, a high school classmate. ''But I don't think many people, if any,=
 really knew how far he had come.''=20
In Amityville, an insular place where children run back and forth among nea=
t, modest homes and spend their summers in or near the waters of Great Sout=
h Bay, Mr. Baxter, who is to be buried here on Wednesday, will be remembere=
d not for his successful career but as a loyal son who did not brag about h=
is accomplishments and who always came home.=20
Almost everyone in Amityville seems to know the Baxter family: Mr. Baxter's=
 father was a sergeant in the village police department, and his grandfathe=
r, a plumber, was a village trustee. People knew that Cliff, the youngest o=
f six, was bubbly and smart.=20
But until recently, few people here seem to have given much thought to Enro=
n, let alone realized that Mr. Baxter was among its top executives. ''I nev=
er knew the name of the place,'' said Joe C. Slack, a village trustee and f=
amily friend. ''I never gave much thought to it.''=20
Mr. Slack knew other things. He was invited, for instance, to the 80th-birt=
hday party that Mr. Baxter held for his mother at a nearby catering hall. T=
here were mussels and shrimp, Swedish meatballs and gracious toasts, and Mr=
. Baxter surprised his mother with two gifts: a Lincoln Continental and a t=
rip to Ireland, Mr. Slack said.=20
''All of the sudden, bam,'' Mr. Slack said. ''You see this good-looking boy=
 in the paper, and you say, 'Holy mackerel.' ''=20
John Bochicchio, 43, a high school classmate, said he was struck at the reu=
nion by Mr. Baxter's modesty, his generosity and his connection to his home=
town. Mr. Baxter had mentioned he was interested in setting up a college fu=
nd for Amityville high school students and donating money ''to fix up some =
things in town,'' said Mr. Bochicchio, a bartender at Runyon's, a restauran=
t not far from the high school.=20
''He was really nostalgic,'' Mr. Bochicchio said. ''As successful as he bec=
ame, he never forgot his roots. He loved Amityville.''=20
Mr. Baxter spent his childhood swimming at Amityville Beach, climbing the a=
pple tree in his backyard and playing baseball on an abandoned cornfield on=
 Oak Street that is now filled with condominiums. ''The cornfield boys,'' h=
e and his friends called themselves.=20
Mr. Baxter started playing guitar before high school. Later, in business sc=
hool, he humored his classmates with a pointed rendition of ''Money for Not=
hing,'' a hit by the group Dire Straits.=20
His intelligence was evident inside the classroom, where he once confidentl=
y argued a point with a high school biology teacher until the teacher ackno=
wledged that he had erred, and on the playing fields.=20
''If the ball was out of bounds, he wouldn't just shout you down,'' said Ji=
m Cheviot, 44, a classmate. ''It was an organized debate.''=20
Once, during a game of catch, Mr. Baxter initiated a conversation that Mr. =
Bochicchio found so surprising he remembers it now -- more than 30 years la=
ter.=20
''He's telling me, 'Isn't it amazing about gravity? The earth is spinning, =
and we can be out here catching a ball,' '' Mr. Bochicchio recalled. ''I'm =
doing everything I can just to catch and throw it, and he's already into ph=
ysics and Newton. Even then I knew this guy was different.''=20
But not too different. In his high school yearbook, a surprised-looking Mr.=
 Baxter, wearing an apron, is pictured during shop class, but not as most l=
ikely to succeed.=20
''He was so naturally smart,'' Mr. Bochicchio said. ''I'm not sure he pushe=
d himself to the limit, it was so easy for him.''=20
As things became tougher, Mr. Baxter rose to the challenge. After leaving A=
mityville, he graduated from New York University cum laude, with a degree i=
n finance. He joined the Air Force, where he met his wife, with whom he had=
 two children, and became a captain.=20
Then came Columbia Business School, where he graduated as a co-valedictoria=
n but stood out for being kind and approachable.=20
''He was just warm and engaging and not in any way elitist or condescending=
,'' said Virginia Weiler, a classmate who is now an adjunct professor or ma=
rketing at the University of Southern Indiana. ''He was so rare, too, espec=
ially in the late 80's. He had a sense of propriety about him, and he was a=
 straight arrow, unlike the Ivan Boesky wannabes in our class.''=20
When Ms. Weiler learned about Mr. Baxter's death last Friday, she was horri=
fied. Upon reflection, she came to the conclusion that he must have acted o=
ut of conscience.=20
''He was very much a man of principle and very much a man of honor,'' she s=
aid. ''He was ethical and very much had that military bearing about him.''=
=20
Alumni officials at the Columbia Business School and N.Y.U. said Mr. Baxter=
 was not actively involved in alumni affairs, making his appearances at hig=
h school reunions all the more poignant.=20
''I would have been surprised if he didn't come'' to the recent reunion, Mr=
. Cheviot said. ''He never forgot where he came from.''=20
Early this week, Mr. Baxter's relatives received guests at the Powell Funer=
al Home on Broadway. Mr. Baxter's coffin was draped with an American flag, =
and next to a collection of bright flower arrangements stood a montage of h=
is personal history: Mr. Baxter posing in a pale blue tuxedo, outfitted in =
a black graduation cap and gown, sheepishly holding a birthday cake decorat=
ed with a rainbow.=20
Many here refuse to believe what the medical examiner's office ruled the da=
y after Mr. Baxter's body was found inside his car in the Houston suburb wh=
ere he lived, with a gunshot wound to the head: that he had committed suici=
de.=20
''With all the goings-on, the shenanigans in that company, I find it diffic=
ult to believe that it was a suicide,'' said John Mischenko III, 50, who gr=
ew up down the street from Mr. Baxter and was friendly with one of his olde=
r brothers. ''It just doesn't seem logical to me.''=20
Some friends said that Mr. Baxter had appeared more serious and subdued tha=
n usual at the recent reunion but that he did not seem to be distressed.=20
When Mr. Cheviot marveled at the news that Mr. Baxter had already retired, =
he did not boast, or wince. Instead, he explained he wanted to spend more t=
ime with his family. ''Jim,'' he had said, ''I've been very fortunate.''

Hi Everyone...

1)  The forecast pattern seems very similar to what we've been talking about over the past several days.  6-10 features below normal in the Midwest and the East with a brief normalization possible toward the Great Lakes next weekend (days 8 and 9) before more cool air arrives.  11-15 indicates yet another trough digging into the East (temperatures normal to below normal) with the primary ridge remaining in the Southwest (above to much above).

2) 1-5 Day forecast also looks similar still quite cool for the East and Midwest - though not quite as hot for the immediate West Coast.  Above to much above normal temperatures will be common across interior California for most of the week with a 1 to 2 day spike of warm temperatures near the coast mid-week.  No prolonged period of heat will affect the Northwest.  

3) EarthSat will issue an "official" 6-10 and 11-15 forecast around 2pm today.  You can get this map by going to:  http://www.earthsat.com/misc/enron/   and then follow the "Sunday Update" link (near the bottom).  Login is "enron", Password is "enron".

Maps are attached - this is the way we feel things will look to start the day tomorrow.  *If there are any changes to this picture - it may be to warm the Midwest/ East closer to normal.  Right now this solution appears unlikely - but if there are any surprises tomorrow - it may be a SLIGHTLY warmer picture for the East.*  

 
Enjoy the rest of your weekend...
Research Weather Team

Laid-off Enron employees caught by health insurance glitch

01/05/2002

Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

HOUSTON (AP) - A paperwork delay has caused the approximately 4,500 Enron C=
orp. workers laid off by the foundering energy giant to go without health i=
nsurance temporarily, forcing at least one ex-employee to put off cancer su=
rgery.=20
Many employees, including Mike Black, had planned to continue their Enron b=
enefits after their expiration last month under federal rules set up by the=
 Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, or COBRA.
But Black, who had to cancel skin cancer surgery set for last Thursday, and=
 his fellow former Enron mates learned the company failed to complete all t=
he necessary paperwork in time for coverage to continue into January.=20
Enron planned to have COBRA information mailed to workers three weeks after=
 their termination, but spokeswoman Karen Denne said it's taken longer than=
 expected.=20
Ex-workers should receive the paperwork by Jan. 15, Denne said.=20
The delay has left Black, a systems programmer who can't afford the operati=
on without insurance, in limbo.=20
"I'm still waiting for my second unemployment check," Black said.=20
Black, 54, said he's been unable to get any COBRA information from Enron, t=
he insurance plan administrator or the insurance company.=20
It seems as if "they're all pointing fingers at each other," Black told the=
 Houston Chronicle.=20
Matt Isbell, president of consulting company COBRA Resources, said the prob=
lem is not unusual because of the complex process. Companies have 44 days t=
o notify an individual they can buy the coverage, Isbell said.=20
During that time, former workers are on their own until they receive COBRA =
coverage. After that, qualifying expenses are reimbursed.=20
Black's not willing to front his surgery costs, however, because COBRA coul=
d disappear altogether if Enron switches its bankruptcy filing from Chapter=
 11, or reorganization, to Chapter 7, which is liquidation.=20
Another worker, Candace Womack, didn't find out her insurance had lapsed un=
til New Year's Day, when she got out of the hospital from heart surgery and=
 needed to buy prescriptions.=20
Womack, who worked in software support, carried health insurance for her fa=
mily.=20
"I'm getting a little ticked about the situation," said Womack, 51, who add=
ed that she was able to sign up for COBRA coverage before she walked out th=
e door after she was laid off from another company in the mid-1990s.

Mike Black has skin cancer and was planning to have an operation Thursday.=
=20
But he had to cancel the surgery when he discovered his health insurance pl=
an is in limbo.
Like the rest of the 4,500 workers laid off from Enron Corp. Dec. 5, Black =
had health insurance coverage through the end of December and was planning =
to continue his coverage under the federal rules set up by the Consolidated=
 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act.=20
But he found out this week Enron failed to finish all the necessary paperwo=
rk so the laid off workers could participate in COBRA beginning in January.=
=20
COBRA requires employers to offer health insurance to their terminated empl=
oyees for up to 18 months. Though COBRA is very expensive - the employee pa=
ys the entire cost of the plan, which is usually subsidized by an employer =
- it is designed to provide seamless health care coverage for the recently =
laid off worker.=20
But Enron officials said the company hasn't been able to process the COBRA =
paperwork fast enough.=20
The company planned to have the COBRA information mailed to workers 21 days=
 after they were terminated but it's taken longer than Enron expected, said=
 Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne. The layoffs and bankruptcy filing were so s=
udden that the company didn't have time to prepare in advance.=20
Employees should receive the COBRA paperwork by Jan. 15, Denne said. If the=
y don't, they should contact the benefits office.=20
A benefits consultant in Houston said she isn't surprised about Enron's del=
ay. COBRA can be a "paperwork nightmare." Documentation has to be sent to n=
ot just all employees but to all the employee dependents who are covered, s=
he said, asking not to be identified.=20
But to employees like Black, the delay is devastating. When his insurance c=
overage couldn't be verified, Black said he couldn't afford to pay for the =
operation out of his own pocket.=20
"I'm still waiting for my second unemployment check," he said.=20
Black is frustrated because he can't get any information about COBRA insura=
nce from Enron. He said that when he calls the company's benefits office, e=
mployees there don't know the answers to his questions. Neither does the pl=
an administrator, and the insurance company seems to be in the dark, too, h=
e said.=20
It seems as if "they're all pointing fingers at each other," said Black, wh=
o was a systems programmer at Enron.=20
Enron could have done it faster, he said, suggesting that arranging COBRA c=
overage is low on the company's priority list.=20
It's not an unusual problem, said Matt Isbell, president of COBRA Resources=
, a company that conducts COBRA training seminars in Kalamazoo, Mich.=20
Companies have at least 44 days to notify an individual employee that they =
can buy COBRA coverage, Isbell said. And depending on a company's plan docu=
ments, that waiting period can be even longer if the clock doesn't start un=
til the last day of regular insurance coverage.=20
During that time, employees have to foot their own medical bills, he said. =
But once the employee applies for COBRA and pays for it, the bills are reim=
bursed.=20
Black knows that but he's worried that Enron may convert its bankrupty fili=
ng from a Chapter 11, which provides protection from creditors while underg=
oing reorganization, to a Chapter 7, which would liquidate the company. If =
that happened, health insurance would disappear and so would COBRA, leaving=
 the 54-year-old with a bunch of unpaid bills.=20
Candace Womack found out she had no insurance when her husband went to the =
pharmacy Wednesday to fill several prescriptions. Womack had just had heart=
 surgery and was released from the hospital New Year's Day.=20
Instead of paying the $10 co-pays, her husband had to pony up $250 to pay f=
or antibiotics and blood pressure medicine because Womack's insurance had b=
een canceled. Womack worked in software support for Enron until she lost he=
r job last month.=20
Now she's worried about how she'll pay for the follow-up medical visits to =
her surgeon.=20
Like many of the laid-off employees, Womack carried the insurance for her f=
amily. Her husband is self-employed, and it's usually much more expensive t=
o buy an individual insurance policy than it is to pay for a company subsid=
ized plan like Enron's.=20
"I'm getting a little ticked about the situation," said Womack, who is 51.=
=20
Womack said the disaster she faces now is in such sharp contrast to when sh=
e lost her job in the mid-1990s.=20
Then, she had been working for First Interstate bank and was able to sign u=
p for COBRA coverage before she even walked out the door.

COMPANIES & FINANCE INTERNATIONAL - Bidders line up in battle for Enron sta=
ke - COLLAPSE AT LEAST THREE COMPANIES LIKELY TO BID FOR CORE ENERGY TRADIN=
G BUSINESS.=20
At least three companies are likely to bid for control of Enron's core ener=
gy trading business by today's deadline, according to the bankrupt US compa=
ny's advisers.
Citigroup, the US bank that is also one of Enron's main creditors, is likel=
y to be one of the bidders, according to other people close to the process.=
=20
It will not be clear until later in the week if all the potential bidders h=
ave submitted offers, but if the auction is successful, it will boost the c=
onfidence of Enron creditors.=20
Any delay in striking a deal could damage the chances of Enron reviving its=
 trading operations and restructuring the rest of the company. Enron's trad=
ers are locked in by incentives for a limited time, and trading counterpart=
ies, bruised by the sudden collapse of the company, are already sceptical a=
bout dealing with a revitalised trading operation=20
Enron advisers said yesterday that all the potential buyers of a majority s=
take were sufficiently creditworthy to restore customers' confidence in the=
 trading business. "That (creditworthiness) is not a problem," said Martin =
Bienenstock of Weil Gotshal & Manges, Enron's lawyer.=20
"We're expecting a number of bids," said a spokesman for Blackstone Group, =
financial adviser to Enron, yesterday.=20
The auction will be held on Thursday and a bankruptcy court hearing has bee=
n scheduled for Friday to approve a partner for the trading operation.=20
Enron hopes to auction off the assets, technology and key staff of its core=
 trading operation, forming a joint venture in which the energy group would=
 maintain a minority stake.=20
Banks, led by Citigroup, are the most likely buyers of a majority stake. UB=
S of Switzerland had expressed interest before Christmas, but the Swiss ban=
k's enthusiasm for making an offer has cooled since, according to people in=
volved. Neither bank would comment last week.=20
People close to the procedure said last week that Enron's cash flow was bet=
ter than originally expected and it had not yet drawn on the $250m of emerg=
ency funds available as part of its $1.5bn debtor-in-possession financing p=
ackage. They said Enron might even reduce the size of the loan to avoid pay=
ing unnecessary charges.=20
In a separate hearing today, a number of Texas creditors will argue for the=
 whole procedure to be switched from New York to Houston, where Enron has i=
ts headquarters.=20

The latest moves in the Enron saga take place, with this week being crucial=
 to the future of operations. The deadline passes for bids, while the forma=
l auction takes place and the buyer may be approved for the energy trading =
unit. A series of post-Christmas trading updates from UK retailers will be =
examined for indications of the strength of consumer spending.=20
MONDAY
Monday is the deadline for companies to bid to form a joint venture with En=
ron's energy trading business, the core of the bankrupt company. Citigroup =
and UBS had both expressed interest in the business, which Enron believes c=
an be revived with the help of a credit-worthy partner. A formal auction wi=
ll be held by the bankruptcy court on Thursday, assuming more than one comp=
any comes forward, and a hearing has been set for Friday to approve a buyer=
. Administrators to Enron Corporation are close to the sale of the London-b=
ased metals trading business of the collapsed US energy group. The deal, wh=
ich would be the third significant disposal to be negotiated in the UK sinc=
e Enron's European operations were put into administration at the end of No=
vember, could be announced within days. Potential buyers for all or parts o=
f the business are Glencore, the Swiss commodities trader, Sempra Energy of=
 San Diego, HSBC and Goldman Sachs. PricewaterhouseCoopers, which is acting=
 as administrator, is understood to have singled out one of the interested =
parties and is expected to finalise the sale over the weekend or early next=
 week. A sale had been expected before Christmas, but was delayed because o=
f difficulties in unravelling the complex corporate structure. TUESDAY=20
Alcoa, the world's largest producer of aluminium, is expected to report fou=
rth-quarter earnings per share of 10 cents, far short of the 45 cents earne=
d a year ago, as anaemic demand for aluminium in the auto and aerospace sec=
tors is expected to strongly hit impact the company's bottom line, analysts=
 said. Two weeks ago Alcoa pre-announced its fourth-quarter earnings per sh=
are expectations of 10 cents, excluding a $225m after-tax restructuring cha=
rge. Lower volumes, depressed metal prices and an overall weak downstream m=
arket will all weigh on fourth-quarter results, trimming full-year earnings=
 to $1.43 compared with $1.81 last year. The company's current estimate of =
10 cents is well below the previous forecast of Wall Street analysts' conse=
nsus of 30 cents. AFX, New York=20
Interim figures from Pace Micro Technology, the UK television set-top box m=
aker, may contain news on progress in the US. It said at the final results =
announcement in July that sales in the US were likely to grow faster than i=

Enron nears crucial decision on trading arm.

Enron will find out whether there is sufficient interest in its core energy=
 trading operations to justify an auction of a majority stake this week.=20
According to people close to the bankruptcy procedure, potential bidders we=
re still conducting due diligence examinations of the business late last we=
ek.
The deadline for formal offers is Monday. If there are enough bids, the ban=
kruptcy court will hold an auction on Thursday. A court hearing has been sc=
heduled for Friday to approve a partner for the trading operation.=20
Enron hopes to auction off the assets, technology and key staff of its core=
 trading operation, forming a joint venture with a creditworthy buyer, poss=
ibly a bank, in which the energy group would maintain a minority stake. The=
 trading book is unlikely to be sold because of the size of Enron's liabili=
ties to customers.=20
A long delay would be fatal to the prospects of reviving the business. Trad=
ers are locked in by incentives for a limited time and trading counterparti=
es, bruised by the collapse of Enron, are already sceptical about dealing w=
ith a revitalised trading operation.=20
Martin Bienenstock of Weil Gotshal & Manges, Enron's lawyer, warned before =
Christmas that if the deal was not closed in early January, traders would "=
simply be compelled to find other jobs with other financial entities".=20
Citigroup is more likely to take a stake in the business, but it has not ye=
t come forward with a stalking-horse offer, which would set a base for the =
auction. Interest from UBS has cooled, according to people involved. Neithe=
r bank would comment. Rival energy companies said they were unlikely to bec=
ome partners of the trading business.=20
The creditors' committee might still select a stalking-horse, but one credi=
tor said that even without an opening bid the committee was confident that =
a partner would be found.=20
People close to the procedure said last week that Enron's cash flow was bet=
ter than had been expected and it had not yet drawn on the $250m of emergen=
cy funds available as part of the $1.5bn debtor-in-possession financing pac=
kage arranged last month.=20
Court approval of the package has been postponed to January 30, but bankers=
 have played down concerns that it would be difficult to syndicate the fina=
l $1bn tranche of the loan.=20
In a separate hearing on Monday, the New York bankruptcy court will hear ar=
guments for the procedure to be switched to Houston where Enron has its hea=
dquarters.=20

OTC regulation flaws exposed by Enron.
By NIKKI TAIT.

01/07/2002
Financial Times - FT.com
(c) 2002 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved

The furore over Enron - and cries from some quarters for greater regulation=
 - come exactly one year after the US believed that it had put to rest the =
issue of derivatives trading supervision.=20
On a Friday night, December 15 2000, Congress passed complex and highly tec=
hnical legislation which essentially ensured that much of the $94,000bn ove=
r-the-counter derivatives industry would operate outside the nation's commo=
dities laws.
Senator Phil Gramm helped to resurrect the legislation after the House agri=
culture committee added a special exemption from regulation for EnronOnline=
, according to Michael Greenberger, a former official of the Commodity Futu=
res Trading Commission. The package, attached to 200 pages of legislation o=
f an 11,000-page general public funding bill, was barely noticed in the rus=
h to adjourn Congress.=20
Much of America's regulatory regime was devised at a time when derivatives =
trading consisted mainly of standardised futures contracts transacted throu=
gh third-party exchanges like the Chicago Board of Trade, and involving tra=
ditional commodity products such as corn or soyabeans.=20
But during the 1980s and 1990s, a good deal of risk-management action had s=
hifted to the over-the-counter market, where banks and trading firms negoti=
ated bilateral contracts (often called "swaps") on an individual basis. The=
re had also been phenomenal growth in financial contracts - hedging interes=
t rate or currency exposures, for example. Finally, the proliferation of el=
ectronic trading systems made it easier to transact business outside the US=
, if regulatory regimes were kinder elsewhere.=20
For participants in the swaps markets one of the biggest concerns is that t=
he Commodity Futures Trading Commission, set up to regulate the futures mar=
kets, might seek to extend some authority to OTC markets. Brooksley Born, h=
ead of the agency in the late-1990s, felt strongly about the issue and the =
problems at Long-Term Capital Management offered her some vindication.=20
But swaps dealers argued that if swaps were deemed futures (giving the CFTC=
 jurisdiction), counterparties with losing positions could argue the deals =
had been transacted illegally. Accordingly, the big Wall Street banks deman=
ded "legal certainty", to ensure that OTC transactions were not caught in t=
he regulatory net. Satisfying that demand was one important element of last=
 December's legislation.=20
Separately, the legislation also set out a new regulatory structure for exc=
hanges - with the degree of supervision highly dependent on the type of pro=
duct traded and the nature of market participants. Certain commodity produc=
ts, in finite supply, are susceptible to manipulation. Moreover, if retail =
customers were to be involved with a market, there would be a need for a de=
cent degree of oversight. Conversely, sophisticated players, trading hard-t=
o-manipulate financial contracts, could look after themselves.=20
Little of this applied to EnronOnline, however. Although outsiders may have=
 viewed its trading activities as equivalent to an exchange, EnronOnline wa=
s structured so that the company itself was the counterparty to transaction=
s handled by its trading unit. That made its business model very different =
from a traditional exchange, which serves as a neutral forum.=20
Few of the participants in last year's debate seem to have changed their vi=
ews significantly. But regulators who believed that largely-unsupervised OT=
C trades could be a Pandora's box in future, still think last year's legisl=
ation a regressive step. "The Commodity Futures Modernisation Act [of 2000]=
 sanctioned opaque markets," says Michael Greenberger, former director of t=
he trading and markets division of the CFTC.=20
Conversely, observers in the swaps industry argue Enron's difficulties did =
not originate in its trading activities - the trading operations suffered w=
hen other problems caused the group's credit standings to collapse. "EnronO=
nline was a highly innovative means of servicing clients for nine months of=
 the year," says Robert Pickel, executive director of the International Swa=
ps and Derivatives Association, stressing that the trading arm had provided=
 "convenient and cost-effective management of risk".=20
However, even advocates of the lighter, less proscriptive regulatory regime=
 had cautioned that the relatively new area of energy derivatives trading c=
ould pose issues that trading of financial swaps did not.=20
"Most dealers in the swaps market are either financial institutions subject=
 to supervision by bank regulatory agencies, or affiliates of broker-dealer=
s regulated by the SEC, or affiliates of FCMs [futures trading firms] subje=
ct to CFTC oversight," Bill Rainer, the CFTC's former chairman told a congr=
essional committee in June. "The same cannot be said of trading in energy d=
erivatives ... Thus a principal argument warranting the exclusion of financ=
ial derivatives from the Commodity Exchange Act - the fact that derivatives=
 trading in these products is subject to direct or indirect federal oversig=
ht - does not apply to OTC energy transactions."=20

Outlook
Enron? We're Missing The Point
Lanny J. Davis

01/06/2002
The Washington Post
FINAL
B01
Copyright 2002, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved

Here's a paradox: Despite predictions of doom from many financial writers, =
it doesn't matter very much that Enron -- at one time touted as the seventh=
-largest company in the nation -- failed. What matters is why it failed.=20
Enron's demise will be little more than a blip on the U.S. economy, with th=
e big losers confined to the same financial speculators who rode the bubble=
 on the way up. But the underlying cause of Enron's fall -- a corporate cul=
ture of secrecy and obfuscation -- is not unique to that company. Far from =
it. Enron's problems are emblematic of myriad public companies in the 1990s=
, from dot-com start-ups to some of America's biggest corporations, who yie=
lded to the pressure to inflate their stock by whatever means possible.
If that culture isn't replaced by more transparency and accountability, reg=
ulated and enforced by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and U.S=
. prosecutors, the credibility and integrity of the various stock markets i=
n which millions of Americans are now invested could be seriously undermine=
d. That's why I hope that Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) meant it when =
he said Wednesday -- after his Senate Governmental Affairs Committee announ=
ced it would subpoena Enron's top executives and directors -- that the comm=
ittee's focus will be "to make sure that something like this never happens =
again."=20
I know something about the culture of obfuscation. I have spent much of the=
 past three years representing public companies and executives accused of a=
ccounting and financial fraud. Sometimes I have been lucky enough to be cal=
led in before the bad news hit the fan. But more frequently, I arrived afte=
r information had begun to leak out.=20
In one instance, the new CEO of a Nasdaq-listed company, Lernout & Hauspie =
Speech Products, retained me and my law firm. He told me he suspected that =
the books of the language translation software company had been cooked by t=
he company's former CEO. The company, he said, had created the appearance o=
f dramatic growth by establishing outside entities -- investment companies =
in which money from investors was being used to purchase what turned out to=
 be mostly nonexistent products and services. Liabilities and losses were b=
eing hidden in these entities and not included in the company's financial s=
tatements.=20
The new CEO suspected that some members of the board of directors might be =
complicit. The Wall Street Journal had been writing bits and pieces of the =
story, but the company, based in Belgium, had either stonewalled or had giv=
en out misinformation.=20
We quickly initiated a two-part strategy based on complete transparency: Fi=
rst, we decided to support an investigation by outside auditors and a new l=
aw firm, with a commitment to publish the results and cooperate fully with =
the SEC; second, we proposed a program of internal reform to clean up the l=
ast vestiges of misleading financial reporting. While we knew the company's=
 high-flying stock would take a major beating once we made these disclosure=
s, we believed this strategy offered the only hope for the survival of the =
company.=20
However, we ran into a glitch. The company's board of directors opposed ful=
l disclosure. The new CEO defied the board and directed me to give the repo=
rt to the Wall Street Journal and to other newspapers and to post it on the=
 company's Web site. We both agreed he had no alternative if he were to avo=
id becoming part of the coverup. One immediate result of our strategy: The =
new CEO was summarily fired by the board -- as were my law firm and I. Anot=
her result: A short time later, the company filed for bankruptcy and was li=
quidated. The former CEO and some board members were charged with fraud and=
 stock manipulation. All have denied these allegations. The investigation i=
s continuing.=20
So you can see why I took such an interest in the rise and fall of Enron. A=
s Yogi Berra would say, "It's de{acute}ja{grv} vu all over again." Enron, t=
oo, developed outside entities that supposedly generated revenues for the c=
ompany, while keeping the expenses and contingent liabilities associated wi=
th those transactions off the books. And Enron's business, like Lernout & H=
auspie's, didn't focus on selling real products to consumers with real prof=
it margins. Rather, Enron was essentially a broker: It bought, resold and i=
nvested in commodities futures contracts, gambling on future prices and mar=
ket conditions. One example of this business model is a brokerage company s=
uch as Goldman Sachs. But perhaps a more apt analogy is Las Vegas.=20
It really didn't matter what commodities Enron was betting on. Although it =
was known as an energy company, trading in natural gas and electricity cont=
racts, it also speculated in water contracts, advertising and time contract=
s, complex derivatives, broadband capacity futures and weather derivatives =
(whatever that means). Its former chief executive, Jeffrey K. Skilling, act=
ually once boasted about the company's absence of hard assets. He proudly d=
escribed its approach as "asset lite," adding: "In the old days, people wor=
ked for assets. We've turned it around -- what we've said is, the assets wo=
rk for people."=20
This characterization is the key to understanding both the breathtaking spe=
ed of Enron's collapse and the reason its failure will not have much impact=
 on the nation's economy. Enron's geometric growth from a sleepy natural ga=
s pipeline company in the '80s to a global giant -- with 21,000 employees, =
3,500 subdivisions around the world and, by the summer of 2000, a total "ma=
rket capitalization" value of more than $80 billion -- was based on percept=
ion rather than reality. As long as everyone saw the stock price going high=
er and higher, people were willing to bet their money (through loans, equit=
y investments and credit on trades) on Enron. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., for =
example, lent Enron $500 million without security and another $400 million =
purportedly secured by something.=20
But if you live by the perception and the illusion of growth, then you die =
by it once reality sets in. Being "asset lite" meant that once Enron's numb=
ers and disclosures became suspect, there was no foundation of hard assets =
-- real products with real value -- to fall back on. Not surprisingly, once=
 the first card of credibility was lost, the rest of the house collapsed qu=
ickly. On Oct. 17, Enron was forced to announce that it had hidden $1 billi=
on of losses resulting from the outside entities; the next day it reduced i=
ts assets by $1.2 billion. Just six weeks later, on Dec. 2, after weeks of =
putting out deceptive information, Enron filed for bankruptcy. Its stock pr=
ice had fallen from $90 a share in the previous year to just 87 cents.=20
The fallout? Thousands of Enron employees who lost their jobs and much of t=
he value of their 401(k) pension plans, which included now-worthless Enron =
stock, will feel a deep impact. Because of decisions made by senior managem=
ent, these employees were not allowed to sell the stock as it was dropping =
in value, though those same managers had sold nearly $1 billion worth of sh=
ares throughout the year. Others likely to suffer from the company's failur=
e are the banks, investors and trading partners who willingly advanced Enro=
n their money as the stock soared.=20
But it's hard to feel much sympathy there. Consumers won't really notice th=
e difference. The electricity, natural gas and water supplies that were the=
 subject of Enron futures contracts will still be delivered to their homes =
one way or the other. Speculators in Enron's "weather derivatives" may have=
 lost some money, but that's not likely to have much effect on whether it r=
ains or shines each day.=20
So if Enron's fall doesn't really matter in macroeconomic terms, why should=
 we care? Because the corporate culture that bred that failure has undermin=
ed trust in the integrity of the public markets. The goal of "meeting the n=
umbers" projected by analysts for each quarter has too often become the ove=
rriding goal -- to be achieved in the accounting department if it cannot be=
 achieved in the marketplace. As Michael R. Young has written in "Accountin=
g Irregularities and Financial Fraud," his seminal book, "What moves financ=
ial markets is the published expectations of Wall Street analysts." They "a=
re perceived to establish, within a very narrow margin, the parameters for =
the upcoming actual financial results. Analyst expectations have become, in=
 effect, a company's reported earnings."=20
With millions of Americans now invested in the stock market, this is no lon=
ger a concern limited to financial elites. We cannot afford to preserve a s=
ystem in which perception is more important than reality.=20
The solutions are as obvious as they are unlikely to be met. The rule of th=
umb must be transparency, in word as well as deed. On a technical level, ac=
counting rules and disclosure requirements have to be tightened up. Off-bal=
ance-sheet entities that create even the slightest contingent liabilities s=
hould be incorporated into the company's publicly filed financial informati=
on. We must also move to a system of real-time financial disclosures, with =
online access to the latest financial information. This is what SEC policym=
akers and congressional investigators should concentrate on.=20
In addition, white-collar criminals who cook the books should be prosecuted=
, sent to jail and required to disgorge profits from all stock sales made d=
uring the period of fraud, rather than receiving what is too often a slap o=
n the wrist and a reminder to the corporate world that crime can pay.=20
Finally, corporate managers must practice the basic rules of crisis managem=
ent -- which may mean defying the advice of many of their lawyers -- when t=
hey learn about bad news that could hurt the company's stock price. The tru=
th will come out anyway, and dribs and drabs will only make its impact wors=
e. So you might as well put it out yourself -- and then do something to fix=
 the problem.=20
Of course, this advice to tell all the truth has been rejected, time and ag=
ain, and not only by business executives. It has been ignored by politician=
s as well. The effect on the public's trust -- whether shareholders' or vot=
ers' -- has been the same.=20
Lanny Davis, special counsel to President Clinton from 1996 until 1998, is =
partner at the law firm of Patton Boggs and serves on its legal crisis mana=
gement team. He is the author of "Truth to Tell: Tell It Early, Tell It All=

Investors to be more wary of credit products.
By JENNY WIGGINS.

As Enron's bankruptcy has rippled through the markets, inflicting losses on=
 holders of its shares and bonds, the credit derivatives market is among th=
e sectors counting the costs of the energy trader's failure.=20
EnronOnline, which rapidly became the world's largest e-commerce site, was =
best known for its role in natural gas, power and crude oil trading. But at=
 its height it offered more than 1,200 products, including bandwidth deriva=
tives, weather derivatives, emissions credits, pipeline capacity and credit=
 derivatives.
The credit derivatives market has exploded in recent years, with the global=
 market for credit derivative contracts growing from about $50bn in 1996 to=
 more than $1,200bn today.=20
The market has become ever more sophisticated, evolving into an alternative=
 to the cash market.=20
Enron was one of the market's most active players, being both a dealer and =
a traded company. Through a credit derivatives exchange known as Enron Cred=
it it encouraged other companies to use Enron to manage their credit exposu=
re.=20
But following the collapse, and the negative impact on some of the credit d=
erivative structures to which Enron was exposed, industry players predict i=
nvestors will approach the market with greater caution.=20
"You're going to see people kind of stepping back and looking at collateral=
 and thinking about the structures before they buy," says John Tierney, hea=
d of credit derivatives research at Deutsche Bank.=20
Investors are also likely to look more closely at the way rating agencies a=
ssess credit derivative structures, he adds. Ratings agencies have put nume=
rous US and European credit derivative transactions containing Enron exposu=
re on review for downgrade, reflecting possible losses for investors.=20
Previously an investment grade company with large amounts of debt and good =
liquidity, Enron was at one time an attractive asset to trade in the credit=
 default swap market.=20
Credit default swaps are the most commonly traded credit derivative, provid=
ing insurance-like protection from the risk of default. There are two parti=
es in a credit default swap: one party (the protection seller) receives a p=
remium from another party (the protection buyer) for assuming the credit ri=
sk of a specified entity. In return for the premium, the protection buyer r=
eceives a payment from the seller in the case of the specified entity under=
going a "credit event", such as a default.=20
Total exposure to Enron via the credit derivative market has been estimated=
 at as much as $6.3bn by Standard & Poor's. Much of this exposure occurred =
through complicated structured finance vehicles known as synthetic collater=
alised debt obligations (CDOs). These sell credit protection through a port=
folio of credit default swaps, pooling a large number of credits, typically=
 credits which are investment-grade.=20
CDOs give investors the opportunity to participate in a range of "tranches"=
 of varying credit quality. The most junior tranche, often referred to as t=
he "equity" portion of the deal because it offers a high, equity-like retur=
n, is the most risky.=20
Insurance companies and banks are among the biggest investors in CDOs. The =
structures provide insurance companies with a means of diversifying credit =
risk and offer relatively high rates of return.=20
Analysts and ratings agencies say exposure to Enron via CDOs should be "man=
ageable". But the downgrading of many CDO transactions following Enron's co=
llapse shows the difficulty of gauging many of the risks.=20
Although exposure to individual credits within synthetic CDO transactions a=
re limited to very small amounts - exposure to any one credit is usually le=
ss than 2 per cent of the pool - the amount of leverage can be quite high, =
because the first-loss or junior portion of the tranche is typically quite =
small. Consequently, even investors in senior tranches of the transaction a=
re vulnerable to sudden defaults.=20
Money managers are more wary than insurers of CDOs, citing the transactions=
' opaque nature. Many are private, and transaction managers often do not re=
veal immediately the names of companies involved, making it difficult to as=
sess credit risk, fund managers say.=20
With CDO transactions so difficult to assess, the ratings agencies have ack=
nowledged that quantification of exposure to Enron in the derivatives marke=
t remains "incomplete".=20

Last week, the Senate's government affairs committee became the fourth cong=
ressional panel to pile on Enron, announcing a two-pronged inquiry into the=
 bankrupt energy giant that will look into both malfeasance within the comp=
any as well as possible lapses by federal regulators.=20
But according to staffers from other committees that are already investigat=
ing the collapse, the folks at government affairs, which quickly issued sub=
poenas for documents from Enron and its auditor Arthur Andersen, may have b=
it off more than they can chew.
The reason: it seems getting documents from Enron is proving more costly th=
an originally expected. Because the company is currently in bankruptcy prot=
ection, company lawyers have insisted it cannot pay copying fees for the pa=
pers the committees want, leaving congressional staffers to fork out the ca=
sh for duplication.=20
And the fees are beginning to rack up. While there are no estimates as to c=
osts incurred thus far, the House energy and commerce committee - expected =
to take the lead in the probes because of its wide-ranging jurisdiction ove=
r both energy policy and accounting standards - expects to have 2m document=
s by the end of the month.=20
Senator Carl Levin, who chairs the government affairs subcommittee on inves=
tigations, said he had not requested any additional funding for his probe, =
adding that he believed some reallocation of resources, including using con=
gressional fellows already detailed to the committee, would cover any addit=
ional expenses.=20
But other Capitol Hill denizens are not so sanguine. Said one staffer from =
a rival committee: "The fact that there are tens of thousands of these docu=
ments - that may take some of the steam out of them."=20

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES=20

WASHINGTON (Dow Jones) - A movement is underway to have a separate=20
committee formed in Enron Corp.'s (ENE) bankruptcy case to represent power=
=20
generators and traders, who contend that the current creditors' committee=
=20
can't adequately protect their interests.=20

Wiser Oil Co. (WZR) is among a group of Enron creditors who are concerned=
=20
with the way the U.S. Trustee comprised the creditors' committee - appointi=
ng=20
debtor-in-possession lenders to the panel.=20

The committee should be acting as the watchdog in the case, Wiser's=20
counsel Van Oliver said. He questioned how the lenders can exercise their=
=20
fiduciary duties as committee members.=20

A number of parties holding claims arising out of hedging contracts have=20
concerns with the way the committee has been set up to represent the=20
interests of Enron and not its subsidiaries, particularly Enron North=20
America, Oliver told Dow Jones Newswires.=20



There is also concern with the way the debtor's counsel has been=20
"mashing" all of the assets of Enron and its subsidiary debtors into one=20
basket, Oliver said.=20

The company hasn't yet filed its financial schedules - the U.S.=20
Bankruptcy Code gives it four months from the Chapter 11 petition date to d=
o=20
so.=20

Noting that Enron and its subsidiaries prepare consolidated balance=20
sheets and income statements, Oliver said creditors don't know what the=20
subsidiaries themselves have in terms of assets and liabilities.=20

The cash management system in place isn't protective of the subsidiaries'=
=20
claims, according to Oliver.=20

Mirant Corp. (MIR) and Williams Cos. (WMB) are also involved in the=20
effort to have a separate committee appointed, people familiar with the=20
matter said. Oliver declined to identify those involved with Wiser, but sai=
d=20
that the parties together hold claims of at least $100 million and possibly=
=20
more than $500 million.=20

A motion is expected to be filed within the next couple of weeks asking=20
the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan to order the trustee to appoint the=
=20
separate committee or, alternatively, appoint a subcommittee to represent t=
he=20
power generators/traders.=20

As reported by Dow Jones Newswires, a hearing on the company's DIP=20
financing agreement with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and Citigroup (C) ha=
s=20
been postponed to Jan. 30. A $1.5 billion DIP loan was initially planned,=
=20
but, sources said the lenders are reworking the facility based on Enron's=
=20
better-than-anticipated cash position, as well as lingering apathy among=20
bankers recruited to take part in the loan.=20

A group of Enron Corp. creditors will try to persuade a New York bankruptcy=
 judge today to move the case to a court in Houston, where the energy compa=
ny is based.=20
Large creditors, such as energy traders Dynegy Inc. and El Paso Corp., and =
smaller ones, such as the Southern Ute Indian Tribe of Colorado, believe it=
 would be more convenient and economical to hear the case near the location=
 of many of Enron creditors and assets. Dynegy and El Paso are based in Hou=
ston.
In a motion filed by Dynegy and other creditors, lawyers also say there is =
"an emotional interest to be served" by moving the case to Houston, where t=
housands of Enron employees were laid off and many more witnessed the rapid=
 evaporation of their retirement plans when the company's stock plummeted.=
=20
Analysts say these creditors might also be hoping for a potentially more fa=
vorable hearing in Houston, where the economy has suffered as a result of E=
nron's demise.=20
Lawyers for Enron, and a handful of creditors opposed to relocating the pro=
ceedings, are expected to argue that it would be less expensive and more ac=
commodating if the case were administered in New York, home to the armies o=
f lawyers and bankers working on both sides.=20
Howard B. Comet, an attorney for Weil, Gotshal & Manges in New York, said i=
t also would be easier for business partners and potential witnesses involv=
ed in Enron's worldwide operations to participate if the proceedings took p=
lace in New York.=20
"The focus of the financial restructuring is here," Comet said.=20
Citigroup Inc. of New York, Barclays Bank of London and Dresdner Bank of Fr=
ankfurt are among the creditors opposed to changing venues.=20
Under the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure, a case may be transferred =
from one district court to another "in the interest of justice or for the c=
onvenience of the parties."=20
The basic criteria considered by judges ruling on previous change-of-venue =
motions have been the proximity of creditors, debtors and witnesses; the lo=
cation of assets; and the cost.=20
Experts say few cases of this size have been moved but Judge Arthur J. Gonz=
alez could be swayed by the fact that so many of Enron's energy-trading par=
tners are in and around Houston.=20
Enron collapsed late last year when revelations of questionable accounting =
practices and mounting debt caused investors and traders to lose confidence=
 in the company. The company lost $60 billion in market value over the last=
 year.=20
Enron filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of federal bankr=
uptcy law Dec. 2 in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of =
New York.

Dynegy Gets Info From Enron Related To Venue Motion

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES=20

(This report was originally published late Friday.)
NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--In another concession to its former merger partner, E=
nron Corp. (ENE) agreed late Friday to provide Dynegy Inc. (DYN) with certa=
in information about the role that some Enron executives will play in the c=
ompany's financial restructuring.=20
Details are still scarce, but essentially, this means that Dynegy will no l=
onger need to depose Enron's Chief Financial Officer, Jeffrey McMahon, in a=
n effort to obtain information that may be relevant to Dynegy's motion to t=
ransfer the distressed company's bankruptcy case to Houston, lawyers for bo=
th companies said.=20
Judge Arthur Gonzalez, of the Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of =
New York, is set to hear this and other motions to transfer the case Monday=
.=20
It's the second time in the past day that Dynegy has gotten the upper hand =
over Enron, and follows an agreement by the two companies earlier Friday to=
 hand over control of a valuable pipeline to Dynegy.=20
Last month, Dynegy served McMahon and three other Enron executives with sub=
poenas for depositions, but later said it only needed to question McMahon. =
At the time, Dynegy said that a deposition was necessary to determine, amon=
g other things, why the bankrupt company filed for court protection in New =
York instead of Houston.=20
Most of Enron's assets and creditors are in Texas, making it more convenien=
t and economical for the case to be heard there, according to Dynegy.=20
Enron, following a Wednesday court hearing, has provided Dynegy with enough=
 information that the latter sees no immediate need for a deposition.=20
This includes details about which of Enron's executives are involved in the=
 company's financial restructuring, according to Howard Comet, of Weil, Got=
shal & Manges - which is representing Enron - and about which executives ha=
ve detailed knowledge of the two companies' adversarial proceedings.=20
Dynegy had also requested information about the Enron's estimated financial=
 reorganization budget, which isn't yet available, according to Comet.=20
But people familiar with the matter have told Dow Jones Newswires that Enro=
n presented financial information, including its budget for reorganization,=
 to debtor-in-possession lenders J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and Citigrou=
p (C) recently.=20
In recent weeks, Dynegy, Enron's 401(k) plan holders, El Paso and other cre=
ditors have all filed motions asking that the largest bankruptcy case in co=
rporate history be transferred to the Bankruptcy Court of the Southern Dist=
rict of Texas.=20
About a dozen financial institutions, including J.P. Morgan Chase and Citig=
roup, objected to the move.=20
Moving the cases "would frustrate, rather than further, the interest of jus=
tice" because Enron's list of 20 largest unsecured creditors is dominated b=
y institutions located in, or controlled from, New York, J.P. Morgan said i=
n a court filing.=20

Foreign News
Bush's rst big scandal rises from the ashes of Enron
Rupert Cornwell in Washington

01/06/2002
The Independent - London
FOREIGN

(Copyright 2002 Independent Newspapers (UK) Limited)

It may not yet quite be the "cancer on the presidency" of which John Dean w=
arned Richard Nixon in the early days of Watergate. But the collapse of the=
 energy conglomerate Enron is suddenly shaping up as big, big trouble for G=
eorge Bush.=20
All the ingredients of a classic Washington scandal are there: the biggest =
corporate failure in history, a chief executive on such good terms with Geo=
rge Bush that the President refers to him as "Kenny Boy" and a history of m=
assive contributions by the Houston-based Enron to the White House campaign=
s of Bush the father and Bush the son.
The final element fell into place last week with the announcement of a full=
-scale Senate investigation, complete with subpoenas for top Enron executiv=
es including Kenneth Lay (aka "Kenny Boy"), representatives of the Arthur A=
ndersen accounting firm which singularly failed to spot the impending disas=
ter, and perhaps senior figures in the Bush administration as well.=20
Even the cast of characters is comfortingly familiar. Enron's lead attorney=
, for instance, is Robert Bennett, the $500-an-hour DC superlawyer who feat=
ured in Washington's most recent presidential scandal when he represented B=
ill Clinton in the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit. That led directly to=
 the Monica Lewinsky saga.=20
By any yardstick, Enron is a massive financial scandal, a tale of concealed=
 debt and shell companies, incompetent auditing and scanty regulatory overs=
ight - not to mention the sudden impoverishment of thousands of employees o=
bliged to hold their pension savings in now worthless Enron shares, even as=
 senior executives cashed in stock and stock options for up to $1bn (pounds=
 700m) during 2000 and 2001.=20
Until now, however, Enron has been the dog which failed to bark - or, more =
exactly, was ignored as the media concentrated on Afghanistan and barely da=
red mention such goings-on as the presidential approval ratings hovered aro=
und the 90 per cent mark. Enron unravelled in November, but not until 28 De=
cember was Mr Bush first asked about the debacle. All that is about to chan=
ge as the news focus starts to shift from the anti-terror campaign to domes=
tic politics. Not only is this a mid-term election year in which the Democr=
ats need just half-a-dozen seats to recapture the House of Representatives,=
 but thoughts are already turning to the 2004 White House race. In all thes=
e calculations, Enron could prove a factor.=20
Already, at least three Congressional committees have been sniffing around =
the affair. But the main investigation will be conducted by the Senate's go=
vernmental affairs committee, headed by the Democrat Joe Lieberman of Conne=
cticut. Mr Lieberman, it will not be forgotten, was Al Gore's vice- preside=
ntial running mate last time and is is widely believed to have ambitions fo=
r the top job in 2004.=20
Thus far, Mr Lieberman has followed the Washington scandal script to a T. E=
choing investigators of Watergate, Iran-Contra and Whitewater before him, h=
e promises solemnly that his probe will be even-handed, "a search for the t=
ruth, not a witchhunt". But, he warns, "we're going to go wherever the sear=
ch takes us". If so, it could be a most interesting journey.=20
Enron has been a fountain of money for politicians of every hue. Since 1990=
, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which monitors such dona=
tions, it has made campaign contributions of $5.8m (pounds 4m), three- quar=
ters of it to Republicans. The biggest single beneficiaries, unsurprisingly=
, have been the two Texas senators, Kay Bailey Hutchinson and Phil Gramm, w=
hose wife Wendy sits on the Enron board.=20
Like most big corporate donors, it has hedged its bets. On Capitol Hill, 71=
 of the 100 current senators and nearly half the 435 congressmen have recei=
ved contributions. The investment paid off with a vengeance, when Enron sec=
ured exemption for its energy derivatives business under a 2000 Act regulat=
ing commodity futures trading. But the Bush family has been a special objec=
t of its attentions. Mr Lay was listed by the Bush-Cheney campaign as one o=
f the "Pioneers" who raised at least $100,000 (pounds 70,000) for the elect=
ion, while Enron gave $100,000 to the inauguration gala, a contribution mat=
ched by "Kenny Boy" and his wife.=20
Potentially most damaging is its possible backstage role in the formulation=
 of Mr Bush's energy policy. At least four Enron consultants and executives=
 have done work for the administration. A champion of the deregulation favo=
ured by the White House, Mr Lay was a frequent informal adviser to the pane=
l under the Vice-President, Dick Cheney, which drew up a national energy st=
rategy.=20
"We've got to ask whether the advice tendered was self-serving," Mr Lieberm=
an says. Or, to put it more bluntly, were the Texan oilman in the White Hou=
se and the Texan energy baron in Houston running a mutual benefit society? =
These questions can no longer escape an answer.

A deadly disease besieged executives across the country this year: Call it =

Enron Canada Corp To Assume New Form: CEO

01/07/2002
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

(This article was originally published Friday)=20

CALGARY -(Dow Jones)- The head of former marketing giant Enron Corp.'s (ENE=
) Canadian unit is a strong believer in reincarnation, at least if it's cor=
porate.
Enron Canada Corp.'s profitability and pool of talent will keep it from sin=
king under the ashes of its parent company's fiery demise, President and Ch=
ief Executive Robson Milnthorp said Friday to Dow Jones Newswires.=20
"There are a number of shapes that this can be resurrected under," Milnthor=
p said. "That might entail being auctioned off through the parent in Housto=
n, or replacing the Enron balance sheet with someone else's.=20
"There's no reason to panic or jump at the first alternative," he said.=20
The shaved-bald executive believes a new entity will appear on the Canada p=
ower market by midyear, under a different name but with many of Enron Canad=
a's strengths.=20
Enron Canada, which cornered approximately 40% of power trades in the count=
ry last year, tried unsuccessfully to distance itself from Enron Corp. when=
 the global power trader lost investor status in November because of a numb=
er of dubious business deals.=20
The Canadian unit argued it was financially stable, compared to its parent =
and credit guarantor, but was unable to stop the flood of contract terminat=
ions that followed Enron's filing for bankruptcy protection in early Decemb=
er.=20
Milnthorp lost a court battle last month to keep counterparties from jumpin=
g ship, and has been liquidating company accounts since then to keep from b=
ecoming insolvent.=20
The biggest move was the C$215 million sale of its power contract for the o=
utput of a 706-megawatt generation station in northcentral Alberta.=20
Enron Canada lost $80 million on its original purchase price in the deal wi=
th TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. (T.TRP) and AltaGas Services Inc. that was co=
mpleted last Friday when a U.S. bankruptcy judge approved the sale.=20
The sale enabled Enron Canada to meet December settlements from November co=
ntracts, albeit three days late, on Dec. 28.=20
Financial settlements due Jan. 5 will be met Friday, Jan. 4, Milnthorp said=
.=20
Enron's fall from credit favor across the world has changed how natural gas=
 producers look on contracts, said a Calgary analyst.=20
"Credit is now No. 1 with producers," Ron Vogal, with Streamline Energy Gro=
up Ltd. said. "We're telling all the little guys to align themselves with a=
 number of marketers instead of just one, and some are looking at going bac=
k to dealing directly with the end-user, rather than through a marketer."=
=20
Most Canadian producers have liquidated their contracts with Enron Canada a=
nd are in the process of replacing the natural gas. Offset agreements, wher=
e amounts due are balanced against amounts owing for a net result, are taki=
ng place between producers and Enron Canada, Vogal said.=20
A number of companies still owe the marketing firm. One company, IMC Canada=
 Ltd., recently lost a court request to be released from its C$2.3 million =
debt to Enron Canada.=20
Milnthorp anticipates more litigation to come through Canadian courtrooms a=
s counterparties and Enron Canada sort out contract terminations and calcul=
ate damages.=20

HOUSTON - As the lunch-hour crowd shuffles by, Dave Glessner, a chemical en=
gineer at Enron Corp., stands alone across the street from the company's gl=
itzy headquarters. A box of his personal work belongings rests at his feet.=
=20
He has bittersweet feelings about the energy trader that recently filed the=
 largest bankruptcy petition in U.S. history. "It was a great job, great co=
mpany, great people," said Mr. Glessner, dressed casually in a short-sleeve=
 shirt and olive-colored pants. He has worked at Enron for almost 11 years =
and will be dismissed in about a month.
"I just hope, if there was some criminal intent, that the people who caused=
 this feel some real pain," referring to the legal punishment top managemen=
t may receive for questionable accounting methods.=20
The collapse of Enron's stock price - it's now selling for 65 cents a share=
, after it lost 99 percent of its value in the past year - has wiped out th=
e savings of many retirees and investors.=20
For example, Mr. Glessner's 401(k) company retirement plan has declined in =
value from $1 million to $5,000, but the pain for him and his colleagues ru=
ns deeper.=20
"People's lives were disrupted," the unassuming 52-year-old said. "It's eve=
rything from relationships to anxiety. People are feeling depressed."=20
Enron's release of 4,500 Houston employees, or 60 percent of its local work=
 force, is just one event that has contributed to the insecure mood.=20
A couple of other Houston-based public companies have had similar woes. Com=
paq Computer, hurt by sluggish PC sales, already has laid off at least 1,50=
0 workers here and may fire more if Hewlett-Packard acquires the firm. Cont=
inental Airlines announced thousands of local job cuts after the September =
11 terrorist attacks because of reduced air travel and increased security c=
osts.=20
Natural disaster struck, too, as flooding from Tropical Storm Allison cause=
d $5 billion in damage and killed 22 persons in early June.=20
Yet Houston remains cocky, even with a nationwide recession. The city has b=
een adding about 50,000 jobs annually in recent years, though leaders expec=
t 2002 employment growth will be about half of that number.=20
"There is a quality in Houston of bravado, of risk taking, of dreaming big =
dreams and being prepared to fall on your face if they don't come true," sa=
id Stephen Klineberg, a sociology professor at Rice University. "In some pa=
radoxical sense, Enron falling on its face is a confirmation of that entrep=
reneurial spirit."=20
Mr. Glessner, the Enron engineer, said the company already had taught him t=
o be prepared always to reinvent yourself. Not married, he intends to stay =
in Houston and is pursuing job leads in the natural gas business.=20
"Change is a constant, and you have to keep current," he acknowledged. "Tha=
t's what I'm doing."=20
Oil once dominated Houston, with four out of five jobs tied directly or ind=
irectly to the industry. When oil prices fell in the mid-1980s, the city un=
raveled. Work evaporated, downtown office space went vacant, and banks lock=
ed their doors for good.=20
Houston diversified some in the 1990s and added jobs in such areas as techn=
ology, manufacturing and trade. Houston now also is home to a renowned medi=
cal center, the second-busiest port in the country, NASA's Johnson Space Ce=
nter and a 17-block cultural district, replete with modern art centers, a t=
heater hall and a Holocaust museum.=20
But regardless, the nation's fourth-largest city still runs on energy, said=
 John Young, a wildcatter who drills for oil and natural gas in central Tex=
as and the onshore Gulf Coast region. "It really is the world energy capita=
l," he said.=20
In this city known for its traffic jams and air pollution, energy firms eve=
n now compose 50 percent of the economy. Enron, formed by Chairman Ken Lay =
in 1985 as a gas pipeline business, sought to be a pioneer. The company exp=
anded into energy trading in the 1990s, as it bought and sold natural gas a=
nd electric power in wholesale markets.=20
Enron then branched out further and attempted to sell all sorts of goods on=
 the Internet, from paper products to fiber-optic bandwidth. The company sa=
id it had sales of more than $100 billion in 2000, making it the seventh-la=
rgest U.S. company.=20
At the tony Galleria Mall, shoppers are buying more cautiously after Enron'=
s demise. "It's all anyone's talking about at the Christmas parties," said =
Gayl Carlberg, who co-owns an advertising agency with her husband.=20
Holding a small, red Neiman Marcus bag, she said her firm has had a record =
year in winning new business, though existing clients have cut back. As a r=
esult, the mother of two said she plans to spend less on holiday gifts this=
 year than last year.=20
Nevertheless, she's confident the city will bounce back. "That's the thing =
about Houston and Texas. You can't knock us down," Mrs. Carlberg said.=20
Mr. Young agreed, calling the Enron collapse just a "speed bump" for the ho=
me of 2 million residents and 21 Fortune 500 companies.=20
Houston's swagger may have been "downsized" a bit, but the city remains upb=
eat, local Salomon Smith Barney stockbroker David Harris said. He didn't re=
commend Enron stock to his clients because it was overvalued, though he had=
 no inkling about Enron's ruin.=20
A Michigan native, Mr. Harris predicts Houston may face a fall in some resi=
dential real estate prices, and entertainment spending may decrease. The fi=
scal effects haven't filtered down yet, he said, though it might be like a =
"Chinese water torture" over the next several months.=20
"We've learned a lot from the boom and subsequent bust of the '80s," said M=
r. Harris, 45, who moved to Houston 16 years ago. "The boom this time was f=
ar more subdued, and therefore, any downside will be much more modest."=20
The collapse of Enron has left other ripples in its wake. Enron had been a =
major benefactor to local charities, and city officials say the money will =
not be easily replaced.=20
"It was profoundly philanthropic," said Peter Marzio, the director of the M=
useum of Fine Arts in Houston. Enron's collapse "will certainly have a shor=
t-term effect."=20
Of the $35.5 million corporations contributed to the museum from 1995 to 20=
00, about $1.7 million, or 5 percent, came from Enron, he said.=20
Another Enron effect is the name of the 2-year-old downtown stadium where t=
he Houston Astros baseball team plays. Enron agreed to pay the team $100 mi=
llion over 30 years for the naming rights, though the future of the stadium=
's name is uncertain.

US Lindsey:Govt Response To Enron 'Tribute' To Capitalism

01/06/2002
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Lawrence Lindsey, President George W. Bush's econo=
mic adviser, Sunday described as a "tribute to American capitalism" the U.S=
. government's decision not to intervene during the collapse of energy gian=
t Enron Corp.=20
Appearing on the Fox News Sunday program, Lindsey also confirmed that he wo=
rked briefly for Enron as a consultant providing macroeconomic analysis.
Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in early December 2001 ami=
d allegations of accounting irregularities that have prompted several inves=
tigations.=20
"What I think is the story here that's going untold (is that) in no other c=
ountry in the world would you have the seventh-largest company fail - Enron=
, with these alleged political connections - and the government would simpl=
y let it happen," Lindsey said.=20
"This is a tribute to American capitalism, I believe, that we have a profit=
 and loss economy; that If you make mistakes - and clearly mistakes were ma=
de by Enron - that the government is not going to step and save it. No one =
is proposing to do that," he said.=20
Enron, Lindsey said, pursued a strategy common among major corporations by =
making financial contributions to both major political parties. Fox News re=
ported the President's economic counselor received $50,000 from Enron in 20=
00, and Lindsey was asked at one point whether he might become the victim o=
f a Republican version of "Whitewater," referring to the investigations int=
o the business dealings of former President Bill Clinton and his wife, Sena=
tor Hillary Rodham Clinton.=20
"I gave them (Enron) macroeconomic advice and if that's the case, so be it,=
" he replied.=20

Texas powers up for deregulation ; Skeptics recall California debacle
Judith Graham, Tribune national correspondent

Chicago Tribune
North Sports Final ; N
1
(Copyright 2002 by the Chicago Tribune)

Last year gave a black eye to one of the great economic experiments of the =
late 1990s: deregulation of energy markets. Now energy-rich Texas is rollin=
g out an ambitious deregulation plan, hoping to succeed where others, parti=
cularly California, have failed.=20
The nation's second-most-populous state is the great hope for free- market =
advocates, who say that unfettered competition among power companies will l=
ower prices and improve choices for businesses and consumers. But Texas fac=
es many hurdles, including skeptical consumers.
Few can forget the panic early in 2001 that surrounded rolling blackouts in=
 California, where deregulation failed spectacularly and cost the state bil=
lions of dollars in bailouts and other expenses. Pennsylvania, once held up=
 as a model by free-market advocates, also fell upon hard times last year, =
as prices spiked and electricity companies exited the state.=20
Texas-based Enron Inc., the most aggressive advocate of free energy markets=
 in the United States, suffered a disastrous unraveling of fortunes at year=
's end and plunged into bankruptcy, with a record- setting $32 billion in d=
ebt. Feeling the need for greater caution, several states--Arkansas, Montan=
a, Oklahoma, Oregon, Nevada, New Mexico and West Virginia among them -- hav=
e delayed or stopped plans to deregulate electricity.=20
But Texas, with its customary swagger, promises that its new open- markets =
energy plan will prove the benefits of the free-market gospel. The plan wen=
t into effect last Tuesday, covering much of the state and as many as 4.5 m=
illion customers.=20
"We're doing this right. We are not California," said Brett Perlman, a comm=
issioner with the Texas Public Utility Commission, a regulatory agency.=20
"We desperately need a good story," said Ken Malloy, president of The Cente=
r for the Advancement of Energy Markets, a pro-competition think tank based=
 in Burke, Va.=20
"If Texas fails, it will be a very, very hard blow, an even bigger disaster=
 than California," Malloy warned.=20
Supporters of deregulation argue California's experience was an aberration,=
 not a symbol of what is wrong with policies they have proposed. By contras=
t, they say, the new energy plan in Texas is a model of careful and intelli=
gent planning.=20
"Texas has probably the best-thought-out system for deregulating electricit=
y out there," said John O'Brien, the principal with Skipping Stone Inc., an=
 energy consulting firm.=20
"Beyond that, it's got a great deal of symbolic significance because it's a=
 plan from an energy-rich state signed off on by then- governor, now presid=
ent, Bush," he added.=20
Enron's fall casts dread=20
Enron's demise has cast a shadow on the endeavor. Not only was the Houston-=
based company one of the primary supporters of deregulation, but it also pl=
anned to compete in the power business through subsidiaries or companies in=
 which it held a substantial ownership interest.=20
Recently, Mario Max Yzaguirre, the chairman of the Texas Public Utility Com=
mission and a former Enron executive, has been embroiled in controversy bec=
ause of previously undisclosed ties to the company. The commission was resp=
onsible for implementing the 1999 deregulation legislation.=20
Illinois officials will be watching Texas with interest, as they prepare fo=
r the start-up of retail competition for electricity consumers, which begin=
s in May.=20
Like Illinois, Texas adopted a staged approach to deregulation. In 1995, th=
e Lone Star State lifted monopolistic restraints on wholesale electricity m=
arkets, giving incentives for new power generators to come to the state. Si=
nce then, 39 power plants have been built, 20 have started construction and=
 29 more have been proposed.=20
The result is an abundant supply of electricity for Texas, which meets its =
energy needs almost entirely from in-state production-- unlike California. =
Texas has a 23 percent cushion of excess supply over peak demand, well abov=
e the 15 percent cushion recommended by industry analysts.=20
Even with the state's rapid population growth and its enormous appetite for=
 energy, especially during the brutally hot summers, a similarly substantia=
l cushion should hold for several years, said Terry Hadley, a spokesman for=
 the Texas Public Utility Commission.=20
"If California had the [supply] reserves that Texas has, the California cri=
sis would have never occurred," O'Brien said, echoing a view expressed by s=
everal analysts.=20
Others are not convinced.=20
"In 1998, California believed there would be a glut of capacity, just like =
Texas does today," said Severin Borenstein, an economics professor with the=
 University of California's Energy Institute. "We learned that a glut can d=
ry up quickly. And Texas doesn't seem to appreciate the ability of sellers =
in a tight market to exercise market power and jack up prices."=20
Plan gets a good mark=20
One mark in its favor, analysts said, is that the Texas plan allows more pr=
icing flexibility than California's. Twice a year, utilities can seek adjus=
tments in rates, based on fluctuations in the cost of energy supplies such =
as natural gas. It will be several years before rates become entirely marke=
t-driven.=20
Like other states, Texas had to sell its package politically by guaranteein=
g savings to consumers.=20
By law, savings for existing utilities had to be at least 6 percent. But ac=
tual rate reductions this year will be between 11 percent and 17 percent, i=
n large part because of lower natural gas prices. Only existing utilities' =
rates are regulated; new competitors can charge whatever they want.=20
Several of the new companies entering Texas' electricity market have compla=
ined, arguing that rates are set too low to allow meaningful competition. T=
he companies have asked: Why should consumers switch when they can get such=
 a good deal from their existing electricity providers?=20
"It's going to be very hard to turn a profit," said Marcie Zlotnik, preside=
nt of GEXA Energy, one of the new entries.=20
Consumer advocates fought hard to keep the low rates intact.=20
"Our overall concern has been that consumers will not receive the promised =
benefits of competition," said Janee Briesemeister, senior policy analyst i=
n the Austin office of Consumers Union.=20
Texas has put in place several important consumer protections, she acknowle=
dged, including prohibitions against switching customers without their know=
ledge. The law also requires that marketing information be standardized so =
people can make meaningful comparisons between plans.=20
So far, competition on the residential side of the business does not appear=
 robust. Although 41 companies have registered to enter the power business =
in Texas, only about five are marketing to households. The the business mar=
ketplace is seeing much more activity, said Gillan Taddune, president of th=
e Texas region of Green Mountain Energy Co., which is touting its wind-powe=
red product.=20
"I'd like to see another major company enter the residential market," she s=
aid.=20
Analysts look to June=20
Texas officials say it may take several years before competition really tak=
es hold. But some analysts think early indications of the state's progress =
with deregulation will come sooner.=20
"By the time June or July rolls around, we'll be able to make some good ini=
tial judgments," O'Brien, the consultant with Skipping Stone.=20
"I think the Texas plan will work. If it doesn't, I won't call that fatal, =
but it'll be very hard for our industry to recover," he said.

Texas Lets Consumers Pick Power Source As Other States Are Watching Experim=

With meltdowns in California and Enron Corp. at either end, electricity der=
egulation may have had its worst year ever. But a number of states are neve=
rtheless pushing ahead plans to open their markets to competition.=20
Those moves are being led by Texas, which has planned to allow the vast maj=
ority of its consumers to choose their power provider as of yesterday -- a =
year after an electricity crisis threatened to plunge California into darkn=
ess and a month after Enron, once the country's largest trader of power and=
 natural gas, filed for bankruptcy-law protection.
Texas' effort ranks as the country's second-largest experiment with deregul=
ation -- right behind California's -- and will affect eight million consume=
rs. How well competition takes hold there could influence deregulation plan=
s in other states, energy experts agreed. "I think everyone is watching Tex=
as," said Sharon Reishus, associate director at Cambridge Energy Research A=
ssociates, a Massachusetts research firm. "It certainly is the key to resto=
ring people's confidence that retail energy has a future."=20
Michigan and Virginia also planned to launch full retail competition on New=
 Year's Day. In May, all residential consumers in Illinois will have the op=
portunity to choose an alternate power supplier.=20
But success in Texas won't necessarily translate into momentum in all regio=
ns. Lingering concerns over California's energy crisis may continue to stal=
l deregulation plans in some states, some regulators and consumers advocate=
s said.=20
Deregulation will affect most consumers in Texas, those under the Electric =
Reliability Council of Texas, or Ercot, which runs the power grid in all ar=
eas of the state except the Texas Panhandle and parts of the southeast and =
far west.=20
Conditions in Texas bode well for competition to take root, Ercot and some =
analysts said. Power supplies are plentiful, wholesale electricity prices a=
re low and the retail rates Texas utilities must initially charge their cus=
tomers are high enough to give other service providers room to compete, Ms.=
 Reishus said.=20
Ercot ran a pilot program during the second half of 2001 under which 5% of =
customers in the region could switch providers and now says it is ready to =
open competition to all.=20
Computer glitches that surfaced during the trial phase have been worked out=
, and Ercot successfully tested the centralized computer-registration syste=
m in late November, said Tom Noel, the grid operator's chief operating offi=
cer. "We are very confident that everything is in excellent working order,"=
 he said. "I expect the transition from Dec. 31 to Jan. 1 to be very much l=
ike Y2K. It will just come and go."=20
It is difficult to estimate how many customers will seek alternate provider=
s, but the migration will likely be gradual, rather than a frantic rush to =
switch in the first few days of deregulation, Mr. Noel said.=20
That has certainly been the case in other states, where even relatively suc=
cessful efforts like Pennsylvania's have seen few residential customers wil=
ling to switch providers. Alternate suppliers in such states have complaine=
d they can't compete with the low rates state energy regulators have allowe=
d incumbent utilities to offer.=20
A successful transition in Texas could help move deregulation forward elsew=
here, Ms. Reishus said. "If it works there, we'll see some renewed optimism=
 about the retail markets in general," she said.=20
About half of the states in the union have deregulated their retail electri=
city markets or are in some stage of laying the groundwork.=20
Though Texas is moving forward, some of its neighbors are having second tho=
ughts. Arkansas and Oklahoma, along with a handful of other states, have so=
ught to delay the start of competition, citing uncertainty about wholesale =
market development and the consequences for consumers.=20
That uncertainty was generated by California, where a poorly designed marke=
t structure and tight supplies produced soaring power costs and rolling bla=
ckouts, and left the state's two largest utilities unable to pay their bill=
s. The state of California, which contends energy companies took advantage =
of a lack of oversight to manipulate the market and boost prices, has becom=
e the primary procurer of power for millions of consumers. As such, it has =
signed $43 billion in power-supply contracts that consumers will be paying =
off for the next decade.=20
Some of the 26 states that haven't passed deregulation laws, such as Wiscon=
sin and Minnesota, have cited concerns about California-style problems as t=
he reason for holding back.=20

Investigating Enron

01/06/2002
The Washington Post
FINAL
B06
Copyright 2002, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved

NO SERIOUS scandal in Washington is investigated just once, and Enron's spe=
ctacular collapse is generating multiple inquiries. So far three House comm=
ittees and two Senate committees are looking into the energy trading firm's=
 demise; the Justice Department, the Labor Department and the Securities an=
d Exchange Commission are conducting three more postmortems. This hydra-hea=
ded inquisition is basically welcome, because Enron's bankruptcy raises man=
y troubling issues. But its focus must remain on the regulatory failures th=
at allowed the company to defraud shareholders and workers. Enron's links t=
o the Bush administration, a tempting target for Democrat-controlled commit=
tees in the Senate, appear less salient for the moment.=20
The regulatory failures begin with the auditing profession. Over the past f=
our years, Enron's accounts overstated its real earnings by half a billion =
dollars. At the end of 2000 Enron reported debts of $10.2 billion; in its b=
ankruptcy filing last month, it listed debts of almost $40 billion. This so=
rt of deception is supposed to be prevented by a firm's outside auditor, wh=
ose job is to certify the accuracy of accounts. But Arthur Andersen, the au=
ditor in this case, knowingly certified misleading financial statements. In=
 1997 Andersen identified $51 million of problems in Enron's books. It sugg=
ested that these should be put right. But when its advice was ignored, it w=
ent ahead and certified Enron's accounts anyway.
This may not be the first time that Andersen turned a blind eye to dishones=
ty. The Securities and Exchange Commission has alleged that the firm's part=
ners saw problems at two other big clients, Sunbeam Corp. and Waste Managem=
ent Inc. According to the SEC, Andersen decided that the problems could be =
overlooked because they were not "material." In the Waste Management case, =
the SEC accused Andersen of fraud and the firm agreed to a settlement invol=
ving a fine of $7 million. In light of this track record, it is not very co=
mforting that another big auditor, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, completed a pe=
er review of Andersen on Wednesday and offered only minor criticisms of its=
 operations. The whole edifice of self-regulation appears insufficiently ro=
bust. An important focus for Enron's inquisitors is to consider tougher ove=
rsight.=20
The second focus ought to concern pensions. Enron's employees were encourag=
ed to invest their 401(k) plans in Enron stock, which came to make up more =
than half the assets in the company's retirement system. Enron's collapse t=
herefore left many of the 4,500 U.S. employees who were laid off pensionles=
s as well as jobless. This ill-advised concentration of risk exists at many=
 firms. One study of retirement plans at 219 firms found that a fifth bet m=
ore than half their wealth on the company's own stock. Last month Sens. Bar=
bara Boxer (D-Calif.) and Jon Corzine (D-N.J.) proposed legislation that wo=
uld cap company stock at 20 percent of a retirement fund. Reform along thes=
e lines ought to be supported.=20
Fixing audit and pension rules is a meaty challenge. But some Democrats see=
m tempted to play down these issues in favor of focusing on links between E=
nron and the Bush administration. Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman, has been P=
resident Bush's leading financial backer; he was consulted when the adminis=
tration was drawing up its energy plan. But, barring further disclosures, t=
his looks more like an instance of the generalized corruption of campaign f=
inance than a shadow over the Bush team. The truth is that Enron showered m=
oney on many politicians of both parties, and especially on Texans. If Demo=
crats are outraged by this, they should push for campaign finance reform ra=
ther than attacking the administration.

Sunday, January 6, 2002=20
About the same time the Winter Olympics are gearing up in Salt Lake City, o=
ther games will be under way at a venue nearly a continent away. The collap=
se of Enron Corp., the giant energy and trading company, has sparked an inv=
estigative groundswell in Washington. This is as it should be: Enron's spec=
tacular sinking spell has raised questions about the probity of financial r=
eporting and auditing, the integrity of the company's top brass, whether or=
dinary employees were prevented from selling shares while officers were dum=
ping theirs and the quality and quantity of government regulation. The war =
on terrorism is mandatory Job One for the U.S. government, but cleaning out=
 the Enron sewer may be Job Two.=20
The Securities and Exchange Commission is the lead government agency invest=
igating Enron right now. The company was a Wall Street darling less than a =
year ago when its stock price was nearly $90 a share. But investor confiden=
ce imploded following stories of alleged insider partnerships and downgrade=
d earnings forecasts. By the time Enron sought protection under bankruptcy =
laws, its stock had declined to less than $1 a share. It closed on Friday a=
t 66 cents a share. In the process, thousands of employees invested in the =
company's stock through their 401(k) plans lost almost everything.=20
Congress is investigating, too, with several committees or subcommittees pl=
anning hearings. To prevent a real circus, these congressional inquiries ou=
ght to be consolidated -- ideally, into a special joint committee of the Ho=
use and Senate that would be co- chaired by members named by House Speaker =
Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) and Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.). Th=
is joint committee would have the same subpoena powers as a standing commit=
tee, and its members obviously could seek guidance from outside experts.=20
But the objective is to get to the bottom of the Enron debacle, find out wh=
at went wrong and whether individuals are culpable, and take prosecutorial =
action if appropriate. That objective will be better achieved if the effort=
 is not scattered throughout the government.

They were the secretaries and bookkeepers and engineers who brought their f=
amilies to the company picnic every year and drank their morning coffee fro=
m company mugs. All the magazines said Enron was one of the best companies =
in America, so they squeezed 30,000 extra miles from the family car to put =
aside a bit of every paycheck to buy company stock.=20
When the 401(k) statement arrived each month, they slept easier that night.=
 Even when rumors surfaced that Enron was faltering, employees were assured=
 it was media gossip.
Marie Thibaut, a 61-year-old executive assistant, had planned to retire fro=
m Enron at the end of 2002. She finally could help her exhausted father in =
Michigan care for her mother, who suffered from Alzheimer's. And she wanted=
 to spend time with her four grandchildren.=20
By August 2001, her 401(k) had grown to almost $500,000 -- enough with Soci=
al Security to provide a comfortable retirement and maybe leave a little so=
mething to her kids.=20
Then, just like that, the money was gone, lost in the biggest bankruptcy in=
 American history.=20
"You can't believe it's happening," she said by phone from Houston the othe=
r day. "It's like an out-of-body experience."=20
Of all the ideas and institutions we took for granted as recently as six mo=
nths ago -- our electoral system, our national security, our civil libertie=
s -- none has shaken the confidence of more Americans than the sudden and c=
olossal collapse of that sure-thing, Wall- Street-darling Enron.=20
Perhaps this sounds politically insensitive, but I fear the upper managemen=
t of the companies that comprise my pension fund more than I fear the upper=
 management of al Qaeda. The truth is, the cold indifference inside an Amer=
ican boardroom is more likely to cripple any one of us than the cold indiff=
erence inside an Afghan cave.=20
The executives at Enron knew the company was in trouble as early as last sp=
ring. But chairman Ken Lay repeatedly assured employees their 401(k)s were =
safe, even as lawyers and accountants shuttled money among partnerships to =
keep the company afloat.=20
In December, after reports had become public about inflated earnings, hidde=
n losses and secret deals, Enron filed for bankruptcy, vaporizing what was =
once more than $50 billion of shareholders' wealth. But Lay, former chief e=
xecutive Jeffrey Skilling and other insiders had already saved themselves. =
They had been cashing in millions of dollars' worth of shares at premium pr=
ices.=20
The employees, however, were locked inside the sinking ship. Enron froze th=
eir 401(k) plans just when stock prices began to plummet to less than 60 ce=
nts a share. People like Marie Thibaut watched helplessly, prohibited from =
withdrawing their money until it was too late. They also watched, in horror=
 and disbelief, as Enron distributed more than $100 million in bonuses to a=
 select group of executives and other employees.=20
Thibaut's savings has now dwindled to about $22,000. And she has been laid =
off, leaving Enron with just $4,500 in severance pay for 15 years of servic=
e.=20
"We believed in our company. We believed in Ken Lay. He kept telling us not=
 to worry, that everything was OK," Thibaut said. "I hope these people go t=
o jail."=20
On Monday, she will start a new job with Shell Oil at a lower salary, and s=
he feels lucky to have it. She will begin to build a new pension account. S=
he has to keep working for at least another five years to become vested.=20
Ken Lay and his colleagues will move on, too. One imagines they'll play 18 =
at Kapalua during Easter week and dig a pond at the ranch for summer fishin=
g and land at another corporation with cappuccino in the executive kitchen.=
=20
American law doesn't define what these men have done as terrorism. So they =
do not qualify for trial in front of a tribunal to account for the pain and=
 fear they've spread.=20
I propose we make an exception.

HUNT: Senator Breaux, Enron, as you know, only months ago, one of the highe=
st values companies in America, has gone bankrupt, top executives that walk=
ed away with millions from the sweetheart deals, while thousands of workers=
 have lost their pensions. A lot of talk about the identification with Geor=
ge Bush and the Republican Party. They also have contributed to a number of=
 Democrats. I think you were the 11th-largest Senate recipient of Enron fun=
ds over the last 12 years. They had street fair for you at a previous Democ=
ratic convention.=20
As you look at that company now, do you think Enron was merely a victim of =
an economic downturn or do you think it was an ethical and perhaps even cri=
minal scam?=20
BREAUX: It wasn't a street fair; that was a Mardi Gras party, in the finest=
 New Orleans tradition.=20
HUNT: I stand corrected.=20
BREAUX: The Enron thing is a mess and I think that it's going to be properl=
y looked at at the very highest level. It's already been investigated by a =
number of congressional committees, and they should look into it. I think t=
hat some of the activities of some of the leaders of that corporation right=
 before it tanked is absolutely unacceptable.=20
I mean, it was obvious to me that somebody knew what they were doing by bai=
ling out of the company, while they were in leadership positions. The peopl=
e who were hurt the most were the individuals or the every-day working guy =
and lady who had their lifetime savings invested in their stock. And there =
were some terrible things -- wrong things that were done. And I think it's =
going to come out.=20

Do you think that all ought to be revealed? Should Vice President Cheney ha=

BREAUX: Whether he should or shouldn't, I think he's probably going to have=
 to. I think the political situation, I think, is going to require that the=
y pretty much divulge everybody that, perhaps, they talked to and got recom=

I want to say, however, I have no problems talking to energy companies abou=
t getting recommendations on energy. I mean, what do you do? Talk to people=
 who know nothing about the problem, and then listen to what they have to s=

I think you have to go to people that know something about the process and =
know something about developing energy to develop an energy policy. So I ha=

Natural Gas Futures Slip Lower


    Natural gas for February delivery on the NYMEX ended down $0.053
yesterday at $2.228 per MMBtu. The March contract also lost $0.053
and finished at $2.232 per MMBtu. The market opened down and
continued to slowly slide most of the day reaching a low of $2.14 per
MMBtu before the AGA released the weekly storage report data. The AGA
showed a withdrawal of 190 Bcf for last week, somewhat more than was
expected by most. The market jumped higher after the report and
finished on an up-tick. Even though the year-on-year deficit was
reduced by 23 Bcf, there is still a long way to go with 1.1 Bcf more
in storage than a year ago. There is now 2.67 Tcf in storage and it
is about 81% full. A year ago, only 1.562 Tcf was in storage. Storage
inventories are 58% above where they were a year ago and 26% above
the AGA's 5-year average of 2,124 Bcf. Look for the market to
continue higher today mainly on short-covering. Natural gas for next
day delivery across the US and Canada was general down $0.05  $0.10
yesterday. Natural gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub lost
$0.07 to $2.31 per MMBtu.

Ex-Worker Threatens Nuclear Plant Employees

    Employees at Edison Internationals San Onofre nuclear power plant
were allegedly threatened by a former maintenance worker who was
fired last month. The nuclear plant was not in danger as the alleged
verbal threats were made at another location. The man was arrested on
charges of making deadly threats, storing weapons in the reach of a
minor, possession of a concealed weapon in a vehicle and possession
of illegal ammunition. Deputies found 42 weapons at the suspect's
home and another 250 at a storage facility. Law enforcement officials
also found 3,000 to 4,000 rounds of ammunition and 4 hand grenades at
the storage facility. While opening an ammunition container 2
deputies were exposed to a yellow gas, thought to be tear gas. Edison
owns 75% of the nuclear station, Sempra owns 20% and two California
towns own the other 5%.

Government and Auto Makers to Develop Fuel Cells

    The DOE and the US Council for Automotive Research, an
organization formed by GM, Ford and DaimlerChrysler to speed up fuel
efficiency research, have agreed to fund a new program called
FreedomCar to develop hydrogen-based fuel cells for use in cars. The
agreement will require significant investment by the automobile
industry and the federal government, the council said. The new
program represents the government's commitment to devote research and
development money and future policy toward hydrogen as an eventual
replacement for gasoline, according to the DOE. FreedomCAR replaces
the Partnership for a New Generation Vehicle, whose goal was to
develop a car that gets 80 miles per gallon of fuel. PNGV was a
partnership between federal agencies, Ford, GM and DaimlerChrysler to
develop a car with 3 times the fuel efficiency of a 1994 model by
2004. The 2002 federal fiscal budget had allotted $127 million for
PNGV. The 2003 budget allotment for FreedomCAR will not be known
until the president submits his budget to Congress in a few weeks.
The program is open to all auto makers, not just domestic car
manufacturers, leaving the door open for Toyota, Honda, etc. to join
if they wish. FreedomCAR might also include suppliers from the
hydrogen production industry. Currently, fuel cells cost about $400
per kW of energy produced and last for about 3,000 hours. In order to
be competitive with combustible engines, fuel cells need to be priced
about $40 per kW and last about 5,000 hours, or about 120,000 miles.
Fuel cells can obtain hydrogen from a variety of sources, including
methanol and natural gas. Fuel cell-powered vehicles have not been
introduced because they are more expensive than gasoline-powered
vehicles and there is no commercial fuel delivery system. The US has
only 2 hydrogen-fueling stations for cars in operation, which are not
open to the public, compared to about 1,300 fueling stations for
vehicles that run on compressed natural gas and even more for those
that run on propane. The DOE secretary said that he thinks that the
nations carbon-based economy may pass from the scene to perhaps be
replaced by hydrogen. The DOE held meetings last year with auto
makers, energy suppliers, fuel cell manufacturers and educational
experts to create a plan for how a hydrogen-based economy would
operate. Currently a consensus on whether hydrogen should be shipped
through a pipe or made at the end point by electricity does not
exist. Ford, GM and DaimlerChrysler have each said they plan to have
some fuel-cell vehicles commercially available by 2004.

EIA Says 2002 Natural Gas Prices to Average Just $2.05

    High storage inventories are expected to keep downward pressure
on natural gas prices throughout most of the year, according to the
EIA. However, a sharp downturn in drilling activity and growing
demand should rally prices for 2003, but for 2002 pressure on
domestic wellhead prices will keep them near $2 per Mcf, the agency
in its latest short-term energy outlook. Wellhead  prices are
expected to average $2.05 per Mcf this year before jumping to $2.65
per Mcf in 2003. Both estimates reflect dramatic reductions from the
2001 average of $4.14 per Mcf. The agency's quarterly and annual
price estimates are up slightly from its December report, when EIA
pegged the 2002 gas price at $1.96 per Mcf.

PJM and Midwest ISO Plan Common Market

    The PJM Interconnection and the Midwest ISO plan to form a common
wholesale electric market that would cover 27 states, plus the
District of Columbia and Manitoba. The plan is still preliminary, but
the parties have released an unexecuted letter of intent, which they
will discuss with the member committees on January 16th and 17th. The
market would affect about 32 million people. It would include
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware and Washington DC, plus
the portions of West Virginia and Ohio served by Allegheny Energy,
which will form PJM West this year, along with Duquesne Light. The
Midwest ISO includes Manitoba, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota,
Wyoming, Minnesota, Wisconsin, part of Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas,
Missouri, Illinois, Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio. The letter
of intent states that the market will facilitate wholesale markets,
both in areas where retail electric industry restructuring is
occurring, as well as areas where retail restructuring is still being
evaluated. The market will allow the larger region to rapidly realize
the benefits that industry restructuring at the wholesale level had
otherwise promised but not yet fully achieved. Detail are still
sketchy, they could not say how transmission might be coordinated,
nor which electric products might be included. However, PJM
emphasized that it would not be a merger of the ISOs and do not yet
have an estimated time frame for startup.

Western Resources Sues PNM

    In a bid to salvage a $4.5 billion sale of its utilities, Western
Resources has said that PNM cannot cancel the deal while decisions by
regulators that a condition of the sale was unlawful and an ordered
rate cut is under appeal. Western Resources, which is suing to force
PNM to complete the sale, detailed its position in a letter to PNM,
which was disclosed in a SEC filing. PNM, New Mexico's largest
utility, has formally rescinded its offer to purchase Westerns KPL
and KGE units. According to PNM, Kansas regulators effectively killed
the deal last July when they rejected Western's plan to place the
utilities into a separate company, a condition of the sale, and cut
customer power rates, lowering the utilities' expected revenue. After
the regulatory decision, the companies entered into negotiations,
which broke down last August. PNM filed suit against Western in
October to end the sale and win unspecified damages. Western in turn
filed suit in November, seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in
damages from PNM for breach of contact. The purchase agreement called
for PNM to pay 55 million shares, worth $1.6 billion and assume $2.9
billion of debt. In the termination letter, PNM said Western is
unlikely to overturn the regulators' rejection of the purchase, and
the rate cut will have a materially adverse effect on the business.
PNM claims those conditions give it the right to cancel the sale
without paying a breakup fee of up to $35 million. Western Resources
says that it is working to reach a settlement with the regulators by
the merger deadline at the end of this year and that doubts about its
success does not give PNM the legal right to withdraw.

WASHINGTON -- Enron Corp. executives met six times last year with officials=
 of the Bush administration's energy task force, though they did not talk a=
bout the energy company's finances, Vice President Dick Cheney's office sai=
d in a letter to Capitol Hill.=20
One of the meetings included a 30-minute session between the vice president=
 and Enron Chief Executive Kenneth Lay that had been previously disclosed. =
In addition, Enron officials met in large and small group meetings with the=
 task-force staff. Two of the meetings occurred after the staff completed w=
riting its report, including one as late as Oct. 10 -- days before Enron be=
gan its rapid slide into bankruptcy court.
"None of these meetings included a discussion of the financial position of =
the Enron Corporation," David Addington, the vice president's legal counsel=
, wrote in a letter Thursday to Rep. Henry Waxman of California, ranking De=
mocrat on the House Government Reform Committee.=20
Mr. Addington, who was responding to a request from Mr. Waxman for informat=
ion on Enron's contacts with members of the energy task force, provided few=
 details. He suggested all of the meetings were consistent with the Energy =
Policy Development Group's plan to conduct "meetings with a broad represent=
ation of people potentially affected by the Group's work."=20
Nonetheless, these newly disclosed contacts are likely to become grist for =
further congressional inquiry as half a dozen committees plan oversight hea=
rings into the failure of the giant energy-trading company. Next month, the=
 Senate Government Affairs Committee expects to open hearings on Enron. Com=
mittee Chairman Joseph Lieberman (D., Conn.) said at a news conference last=
 week that he wanted to explore, among other things, whether Enron influenc=
ed administration energy policy.=20
The letter produced a swift response from Mr. Waxman, who wrote the vice pr=
esident yesterday asking for more detail. The first response, he said, "rai=
ses additional questions about the extent to which Enron may have influence=
d the administration's energy policies or provided information about its ow=
n operation." For example, Mr. Waxman noted that the day after Mr. Cheney m=
et privately with Mr. Lay, the vice president stated his opposition to elec=
tricity price caps in California, a position that Enron had espoused previo=
usly.=20
Mr. Waxman said the response did not provide names of participants other th=
an the vice president, nor did it mention the subject of the meetings, any =
requests for policy changes and copies of any documents or e-mail communica=
tions between Enron and the administration.=20
White House spokeswoman Claire Buchan said task force members conducted the=
 meetings to learn as much as possible about energy issues. The meetings, s=
he said, were held by the staff with "many, many groups across a broad rang=
e of interests to insure they had a thorough understanding" of the topic. S=
he said that the White House was committed to cooperating with members of C=
ongress reviewing the Enron situation "provided they are not pursuing open-=
ended investigations or fishing expeditions."=20
Enron, the nation's biggest marketer of electricity and natural gas, filed =
for bankruptcy-court protection following a crisis of confidence among its =
investors. The problems have resulted largely from Enron's dealings with pr=
ivate partnerships, run by some of its own executives. The company saw its =
market value plunge recently to about $540 million from more than $77 billi=
on last year.

Democrats squeeze information from White House on Enron-Cheney meetings=20
WASHINGTON (AP) - Because of Enron Corp.'s sudden bankruptcy, congressional=
 Democrats have won their first victory in a nine-month effort to squeeze i=
nformation from the Bush White House on its ties to the energy industry.=20
For the first time, the White House is acknowledging that Enron representat=
ives met six times with Vice President Dick Cheney or his aides on energy i=
ssues last year, most recently in mid-October just before the investing pub=
lic realized the company was heading for disaster.=20
Since last April, Cheney had fended off congressional requests for the iden=
tities of business executives and lobbyists who met with the White House as=
 the administration formulated its pro-industry energy plan.=20
The picture changed when Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., began pressing the Wh=
ite House about last month's crash of Enron, whose CEO, Ken Lay, is among P=
resident Bush's biggest political supporters.=20
The vice president's office said the last Enron meeting with a Cheney aide =
was Oct. 10, just six days before the first in a series of public admission=
s by the company about its true financial condition that sent it careening =
into bankruptcy court.

Vice President Dick Cheney or his aides met six times with Enron Corp. exec=
utives while the administration crafted its energy policy, Cheney's office =
revealed in a letter made public yesterday, fueling criticism over the ener=
gy company's White House influence.=20
The letter to Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Los Angeles, from Cheney counsel David S=
. Addington, came after a standoff that has threatened to escalate into a c=
ourt battle.
But rather than quell the furor, the letter's limited disclosures appeared =
likely to lend ammunition to critics seeking to link Enron's Dec. 2 bankrup=
tcy to the administration. Waxman called the letter helpful but insufficien=
t.=20
"The vice president has given us a letter with some of the information we r=
equested about the energy task force," Waxman told The Chronicle yesterday.=
 "I think that's useful to have, but it only gives us some answers, and I t=
hink we need a lot more."=20
Until now, the administration has refused repeated congressional requests t=
o disclose whom the Cheney-led task force met with to form its energy polic=
y. Comptroller General David Walker is expected to make a decision later th=
is month on whether to sue to request the task force's internal documents.=
=20
Enron, once the nation's seventh largest corporation, collapsed in a mire o=
f dubious financial maneuvers, dealing a major blow to thousands of employe=
es and stockholders and sparking an uproar on Capitol Hill.=20
Eight separate congressional investigations into the company's business dea=
lings have started, and many Democrats vow extensive probes into Enron's re=
lationship to the administration, especially former Enron chief executive o=
fficer Kenneth Lay's close ties to President Bush. Lay was a longtime Bush =
fund-raiser, and he and Enron were major contributors to Bush's presidentia=
l campaign.=20
"Enron was a major player in the energy issue, we saw them actively involve=
d in California, and we need to find out what influence they had over the a=
dministration's energy policy and whether people in the administration knew=
 what was going on in Enron before its collapse," Waxman said. "This is goi=
ng to be an ongoing investigation of a major financial catastrophe."=20
The letter from Cheney's counsel released by Waxman's office, which is date=
d Jan. 3, said Lay had met with Cheney April 17 for a half hour. The letter=
 said the two had discussed "energy policy matters, including the energy cr=
isis in California, and did not discuss information concerning the financia=
l position of Enron Corp."=20
The letter responded to Waxman's Dec. 4 request for Cheney to "release info=
rmation about secret contacts your energy task force had with Enron Corpora=
tion. . . . In light of Enron's financial collapse, it is important to know=
 whether Enron communicated pertinent facts about its financial situation t=
o the task force."=20
Addington noted that Cheney had revealed the meeting with Lay in a May 17 i=
nterview on the television program "Frontline."=20
Bush appointed the Cabinet-level task force, called the National Energy Pol=
icy Development Group, to develop the administration's energy policy, which=
 leaned heavily toward boosting supplies, including the controversial propo=
sal to open the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge to drilling. The task force=
 was formed Jan. 29, issued its report in early May and shut down Sept. 30.=
=20
The letter said the group's support staff had met with "a broad representat=
ion of people potentially affected by the group's work," including energy c=
ompanies, environmental advocacy groups, regulators, unions, researchers an=
d other parties.=20
But top environmental groups had complained bitterly that they were shut ou=
t of its deliberations.=20
"We had one meeting with the vice president a month after the report was re=
leased," said David Hawkins, director of the National Resource Defense Coun=
cil's climate center, which has also filed a lawsuit to force the task forc=
e to hand over documents.=20
"I know that the environmental groups' leadership asked repeatedly for a me=
eting with the vice president before the plan was released, and we never go=
t that meeting," Hawkins said, adding that they had been allowed one meetin=
g with the task force staff.=20
The letter released yesterday by Waxman's office said Enron representatives=
 had met with the task force's executive director twice, on Feb. 22 and Mar=
ch 7. The staff met April 9 with representatives of two dozen utilities, in=
cluding Enron.=20
Two more meetings with Enron took place after the report was released, the =
letter said, including an Oct. 10 meeting with the former task force execut=
ive director, who had moved to the vice president's staff. The letter said =
neither meeting had any discussion of Enron's financial position.=20
Addington played down the meetings, noting that Cheney had met with Lay onl=
y once and disclosed the meeting on television in May, and that none of the=
 meetings had discussed the company's finances.=20
Critics were unmoved, however, saying the administration was continuing to =
stonewall.=20
"This is one of these things where just hiding the information continues to=
 make the story worse and worse," Hawkins said. "And dribbling it out by sa=
ying, 'OK, we'll tell you some of the people we met with such as Enron,' le=
aves the question, . . . why can't they tell us about meetings with other i=
ndustry representatives?"=20
The vice president's office did not return requests for a response.

Big Banks Seeking Enron's Energy-Trading Business
By JONATHAN D. GLATER

01/09/2002
The New York Times
Page 4, Column 3
c. 2002 New York Times Company

Several financial institutions and companies, including Citibank, UBS and B=
P, have indicated a serious interest in buying the energy-trading business =
of the bankrupt Enron Corporation, according to people involved in setting =
up an auction of the business. Each company was required to put up a $25 mi=
llion deposit to bid for all or part of the operation, according to court d=
ocuments.=20
An Enron spokeswoman, Karen Denne, would not comment on the number of bidde=
rs or their identity. ''All we're saying is that we received multiple bids,=
'' she said.
There were conflicting reports from different sources yesterday of addition=
al interested buyers, and one lawyer whose client will be involved in the a=
uction said that other companies might submit bids even though the official=
 deadline had passed. The auction is scheduled to take place tomorrow. ''We=
 have the ability to be flexible,'' the lawyer said.=20
Trying to buy a piece of Enron is not as surprising as it may sound, accord=
ing to analysts who follow energy trading and Enron's business. What is val=
uable in a trading operation, according to one analyst whose firm is involv=
ed in the bankruptcy proceedings, is not just the tangible assets -- the co=
mputers, proprietary software and other necessary tools of trading -- but t=
he experience of its employees. And surprisingly few employees have left th=
e trading operation of Enron North America, a subsidiary.=20
More than 500 employees remain, including researchers, traders and analysts=
 whose job it is to determine what the price of a given transaction should =
be, Ms. Denne, the Enron spokeswoman, said. ''There has been a real effort =
to keep that business intact so that Enron would retain some of the benefit=
s of that business,'' she said.=20
Part of that effort included payments of millions of dollars to keep crucia=
l employees, including some natural gas and electricity traders, both befor=
e the collapse of Enron's merger with Dynegy and soon before the company so=
ught bankruptcy protection. Those payments, which were criticized by credit=
ors at the time, may have bolstered the value of the trading business.=20
''Forget about having all these physical assets,'' said Peter Rigby, direct=
or of utilities, energy and project finance for Standard & Poor's. ''It's a=
 very knowledge-dependent business.''=20
An energy trading business at its simplest sells energy commodities, like g=
as or electricity, at a specific time, Mr. Rigby said. But the business bec=
omes more complicated for a market maker like Enron, which matches buyers a=
nd sellers of commodities, as well as hedging products that allow companies=
, utilities or other entities to protect themselves from fluctuations in th=
e prices of energy products. Some traders might watch the weather in differ=
ent parts of the country to anticipate energy needs, for example.=20
Where the experience becomes valuable, though, Mr. Rigby said, is in unders=
tanding more of the complexities of energy markets -- the times of peak use=
 in different markets in different time zones, the location and capacity of=
 power plants in different regions and potential matches of buyers and sell=
ers.=20
''You've got to know about markets; you've got to know about the weather; y=
ou've got to know about power markets and fuel markets,'' he said.=20
But determining how much that experience is worth is another question -- co=
mplicated, Enron's lawyers say, by the fact that bids are taking the form o=
f ownership stakes in a joint venture that would also operate the trading b=
usiness. Potential buyers propose the percentage of the joint venture they =
would own, the lawyer said; the advantage to the trading business is the fi=
nancial credibility that it would have as a result of financial backing fro=
m outside Enron.=20
A committee of Enron's creditors and company executives will meet with bidd=
ers this week to try to improve the offers that have been made. A winning b=
id could be approved as early as Friday by the bankruptcy court.

USA: UPDATE 1-Enron gets bids for trading operations.

01/08/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

NEW YORK, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Two banks have submitted bids for a controlling=
 stake in Enron Corp.'s dormant energy trading business, moves that may all=
ow the once-dominant business to revive in coming weeks, people familiar wi=
th the company's plans said Tuesday.=20
Enron, which declared bankruptcy on Dec. 2, received bids from Citicorp Inc=
. and UBS Warburg for a majority stake in the Houston-based energy trading =
operations. But a third financial institution that previously expressed int=
erest, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. declined to submit a bid by last night, the =
deadline for bids for the Enron assets, these people said.
Citicorp, UBS Warburg and J.P. Morgan declined to comment on any interest i=
n Enron assets.=20
Analysts said its difficult to value the once-powerful trading operation th=
at has virtually shut down, hobbled by worries over Enron's murky finances.=
 The assets being auctioned make up the bulk of Enron's wholesale services =
business, which generated $94.9 billion in 2000, with $2.2 billion in reven=
ue.=20
John Olson, an analyst with Houston-based Sanders Morris Harris, estimated =
the trading business stake could go for $1 billion to $1.5 billion, since "=
this thing is going to have to crawl before it can walk."=20
However, Robert Chambers, analyst with Lehman Brothers, said he anticipated=
 bids of no more than $100 million, since he said Enron is basically auctio=
ning off only "people, computers and software, but not the book," referring=
 to contracts that Enron had forged before its bankruptcy.=20
"Chances of getting a $2 billion auction bid are impossible, given that the=
y are not selling the book," said Chambers. He acknowledged being "bearish"=
 on Enron, but said there is still Enron, particularly its distressed bonds=
, which he values at 35 cents on the dollar, even though they are trading a=
t 24 cents.=20
Another analyst, who asked to remain unnamed, said the operation could comm=
and a value of 10 times earnings, or about $10 billion, and any valuation d=
epends on "a big caveat of whether this trading operation will come back."=
=20
In addition to the banks, British oil giant BP Plc also said it may be inte=
rested in the Enron operations, once the world's biggest trader of contract=
s for natural gas and other energy commodities.=20
BP said it had submitted a bid of $25 million for a small portion of Enron'=
s assets, including some back office functions and information technology a=
ssets. A spokesperson for the London-based company it said it may be intere=
sted in other assets but declined to elaborate.=20
Enron has all but shut down its Houston-based trading operations while it s=
eeks a financial backer that could guarantee contracts for the myriad commo=
dities that it has traded. Enron trading operations generated the bulk of i=
ts $101 billion in revenue in 2000.=20
Previously, Citicorp, J.P. Morgan and UBS Warburg had expressed interest in=
 this role, according to people familiar with the company's plans.=20
The company is slated to decide on Thursday whether to accept a bid. Enron =
lawyers previously stated that the company is not looking for cash bids, bu=
t rather an ownership stake of up to 51 percent. The stake would give the b=
idder cash flow from the operations, but it would agree to guarantee contra=
cts.=20
Any bid for the trading operations must be approved by Judge Arthur Gonzale=
z of the Southern District of New York bankruptcy court, which is overseein=
g Enron's Chapter 11 bankruptcy case.=20
Enron is offloading the trading operations to generate cash to pay off as m=
uch as $40 billion in debt.=20
Enron collapsed after disclosures of hidden debt in off-balance sheet trans=
actions destroyed investor confidence in the Houston-based company. Enron's=
 advisors have made it a priority to revive the trading operations, which h=
ave all but stalled in the wake of the bankruptcy filing.

Enron favours Sempra Energy to buy its metals trading group - sources

LONDON (AFX) - Enron Corp favours the San Diego-based Sempra Energy as an a=
cquirer of its metals trading arm over other interested parties Glencore, t=
he Swiss commodities trader, HSBC, and Goldman Sachs, sources told AFX News=
.=20
"Enron considers Sempra to be the best bidder because it wants the business=
 and the people while other parties just want the positions," the source sa=
id.
"The preference of Enron's bankruptcy committee is to find a buyer who is w=
illing to take the people as well as the positions," the source said.=20
In this way, Enron would also avoid employee severance costs, he said.=20
Sempra director of media relations David Klein said the company is interest=
ed in certain assets of Enron, "which would be complementary to our busines=
s."=20
However, those interests have not been identified to the public, Klein said=
.=20
Yesterday, Enron company sources told AFX News that Enron has already agree=
d to sell its metals trading arm to Sempra.=20
Klein would not comment on the report in line with company policy regarding=
 market rumours.=20
Enron was expected to formally announce the winning suitor of its metal bus=
iness before Christmas, but a decision was delayed because of difficulties =
in unravelling the group's complex corporate structure, according to a Fina=
ncial Times report last week.=20
However, the deal was completed as early as before Christmas and details ar=
e now being formalised, Enron sources said.=20
The London-based business would also include operations in the US, the sour=
ce said.=20
Enron could not be contacted at the time of reporting.=20
Shares of Enron closed the trading day up 5 cents to 73 cents, while Sempra=
 rose 15 cents to 25.14 usd.=20

Philippine Min Expects Enron Pwr Pacts Buyout By End-Jan

Dow Jones Asian Equities Report
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

MANILA -(Dow Jones)- Philippine Energy Secretary Vincent Perez said Wednesd=
ay he expects the government to reach a deal by the end of January to buy o=
ut power contracts of financially-troubled Enron Corp. (ENE).=20
Perez told reporters that the Power Sector Assets & Liabilities Management =
Corp., or Psalm, appears to have secured a large discount for the contracts=
.
Psalm was created to assume the debts and assets of National Power Corp. (Q=
.NAP), or Napocor, prior to its privatization.=20
"For Psalm to sign an agreement with Enron, a higher discount rate must be =
offered and it looks like it's going to happen," Perez said.=20
Enron initially offered a 12% discount on future cash flow from its power s=
upply contracts with Napocor, but Psalm wanted a discount rate that is in t=
he "high teens."=20
"Psalm and Enron are still in discussions. We expect something by the end o=
f the month," Perez said.=20
Enron's operations in the Philippines include two oil-fired plants - the 11=
0-megawatt Batangas plant and the 116-MW plant in Subic Bay - which the com=
pany runs under build-operate-transfer contracts with Napocor.=20
Under the terms of its power contracts with Napocor for the Batangas and Su=
bic Bay power plants, if one party seeks to pull out of the contract ahead =
of the expiry date, both parties will negotiate the cost of exiting the con=
tract prematurely.=20

TERRY KEENAN, FOX NEWS SENIOR BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Well, if there was fr=
aud involved, and there probably was, that still doesn't negate the fact th=
at this stock was extremely overvalued. There wasn't a lot of good reportin=
g on it. A lot of people didn't even know what the company did.=20
And the first rule of investing is, don't buy things that you don't know ab=
out, and certainly don't...=20
O'REILLY: Well, I knew about it...=20
(CROSSTALK)=20
KEENAN: ... (inaudible)...=20
O'REILLY: ... and I looked at the chart, and this time last year, all the b=
ig brokerage houses -- Merrill Lynch, PaineWebber -- all of these people ha=
d buys.=20
KEENAN: And you probably looked at the chart, and the stock was trading at =
$80 or $90, and like a lot of people...=20
O'REILLY: Well, it had a big P/E.=20
KEENAN: ... (inaudible) -- wow, this is, this is a great company.=20
O'REILLY: OK. But it was in a good industry, and McIntyre is telling me it'=
s a good stock, all the brokerage houses are saying it's good, all the CNBC=
 people are saying, Hey, it's great. So how do I know?=20
KEENAN: Well, the second rule of investing is, don't listen to those Wall S=
treet analysts, because they're paid to tout stocks. And what they're...=20
O'REILLY: All right, well, wait a minute...=20
KEENAN: ... (inaudible)...=20
O'REILLY: ... who am I supposed to...=20
KEENAN: ... to do.=20
O'REILLY: ... listen to? I can't get the records from this Enron company, I=
 can't see...=20
KEENAN: Oh, you can, the SEC, they're filed public records every quarter.=
=20
O'REILLY: Who do I go to, down to Washington and look up Enron?=20
KEENAN: No, you go -- there's a Web site, FreeEdgar, doesn't even cost you =
a cent. You can go on there, you can see -- all the records are probably wh=
at you would find, because there were a lot of footnotes and a lot of unexp=
lained questions in this company...=20
O'REILLY: To where? You're telling me...=20
KEENAN: ... and it was, like I said...=20
O'REILLY: ... as an investor, I should go to the SEC Web site and look up E=
nron.=20
KEENAN: The other thing is...=20
O'REILLY: And what am I going to find there?=20
KEENAN: You're going to find all of their public documents. And you're goin=
g to find a lot of footnotes that are going to raise a lot of questions abo=
ut why this stock was trading at 50 times earnings when its counterparts...=
=20
O'REILLY: Did you know that stock was...=20
KEENAN: ... are trading at 50.=20
O'REILLY: ... was going to tank? Did you know?=20
KEENAN: I didn't buy it. I certainly had a lot of questions. But I didn't u=
nderstand it. They were trading something called broadband. I didn't know w=
hat that was, and I didn't know why the stock...=20
O'REILLY: Well, I know what broadband is.=20
KEENAN: I didn't know why -- I didn't know trading broadband was.=20
O'REILLY: All right. Well, here's the deal. Most people, they're not sophis=
ticated enough, including me, to go to the Web site and figure out what the=
 footnotes are. I don't know. I'm trusting certain people to give me financ=
ial advice. Obviously, the people who did that are not on my A-list right n=
ow. But you've got guys in that company who made millions of dollars as thi=
s stock came down, OK? And I saw public announcements. These guys came out =
in public and said, "Our stock's fine. Our company's great. There's no prob=
lem here." They ought to be arrested!=20
KEENAN: And probably ought to disgorge all of those profits...=20
O'REILLY: That's right!=20
KEENAN: ... from selling the stock.=20
O'REILLY: Absolutely.=20
KEENAN: But as a small investor, you could go on Yahoo, put in the name Enr=
on, and this is what you would have found in the summertime. This is the in=
sider selling.=20
(CROSSTALK)=20
O'REILLY: But Terry, look.=20
KEENAN: ... those -- those executives selling the stock.=20
O'REILLY: Look at this. How many people have time to do this? See? I mean, =
a lot of people had Enron and their 401(k)s. Their advisers bought it for t=
hem. I mean, come on!=20
KEENAN: Well, if I had 100 percent of my net worth in Enron stock, I would =
have been looking to see if my bosses were selling.=20
O'REILLY: Fine. Granted. But even when you have insider selling, the only w=
ay I know about to get it is from "Barron's," and they list it, like, four =
or five weeks after it's sold.=20
KEENAN: Yeah, but they started selling in 2000. They sold 6 million shares,=
 these executives, in the year 2000.=20
O'REILLY: All right.=20
KEENAN: Only two million last year. So they got out right at the top.=20
O'REILLY: All right. So they got out right at the top. These guys inside, t=
hey started selling. But they told the public and all they told all the ana=
lysts there's nothing wrong with the stock. It's going continue to do well.=
 So they lied. So they lied. So what should happen to them?=20
KEENAN: They should go to jail. If they lied and if they committed fraud, w=
hich it perhaps looks like they did, it's not 100 percent sure...=20
(CROSSTALK)=20
O'REILLY: Well, let's have an investigation, right?=20
KEENAN: Yeah. There's eight federal investigations right now.=20
O'REILLY: Well, there aren't really investigations. There are congressional=
 hearings. John Ashcroft hasn't assigned the FBI, as we talked about earlie=
r, to investigate the Enron guys.=20
KEENAN: No, he hasn't. And hopefully, he will. But you know, $4 trillion in=
 market value has been lost in the stock market over the last year and half=
. More money was lost in Cisco in 2001 than in Enron. Are we going to have =
a federal investigations...=20
O'REILLY: Yes!=20
KEENAN: ... into every one of these stocks?=20
O'REILLY: If there's insider selling. If these CEOs are lying and they're s=
elling and saying everything's great, yes. That's fraud in the inducement. =
That's against the law!=20
KEENAN: Well, it's going to keep a lot of people very busy. The public...=
=20
O'REILLY: Well, good. Let's clean this up!=20
KEENAN: The public pronouncements are wrong. You can't tout the stock while=
 you're selling, but it's legal for them to sell their stock...=20
O'REILLY: And I think...=20
KEENAN: ... and disclose it, as they did.=20
O'REILLY: And I think all of these -- all of these, you know, spinmeisters =
that go on your show and Cavuto's show and everything -- I should -- you sh=
ould give them their home addresses when they do this kind of stuff!=20
KEENAN: Yeah, but let me tell you, I've had a lot of negative analysts on w=
ho've said negative things.=20
O'REILLY: All right.=20
KEENAN: Some of them have gotten death threats.=20
O'REILLY: I got it. I got it.=20
(CROSSTALK)=20
O'REILLY: You know what I'm talking about, though. A lot of these pinheads =
don't know what they're talking about. Terry Keenan, thanks very much.=20

Recession-Proof? Hot Texas Deal Climate Could Chill
BY LAURA MANDARO

01/09/2002
American Banker

Copyright (c) 2002 Thomson Financial, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Texas has been having its share of woes -- Enron Corp.'s failure, oil price=
s declining, and technology companies and airlines in distress -- none of i=
t good news for the banking industry. But opinions differ on how severe the=
 impact on Texas' economy will be.=20
Wells Fargo & Co. chief economist Sung Won Sohn, for example, says Texas ma=
y avoid the recession altogether thanks to its industrial diversity.
And his colleague Chip Carlisle, the regional president of Wells' metropoli=
tan markets in Texas, said, "Our loan demand has remained really strong. I =
wouldn't say that some of the things you see on a national scale you're see=
ing here."=20
There are concrete signs, however, that the once-thriving Texas economy has=
 begun to slow, and some observers say it will suffer the worst of the cred=
it problems and rebound later than the rest of the nation.=20
Unemployment in the state, which has a population of more than 20 million, =
jumped from 3.8% last January to 5.4% in November. The national figure rose=
 from 4.2% to 5.6% in the same period.=20
Diane C. Swonk, the chief economist for Bank One Corp., said that when Texa=
s recovers "it won't be the boom state it was in the late 1990s."=20
She predicts that the nation will come out of the recession in the first qu=
arter, growing at a 0.6% rate. She expects the economies of Texas, Louisian=
a, and Oklahoma -- three states tracked by Bank One in its Oil Patch index,=
 where Texas is the dominant economy -- to shrink at an 0.8% rate, and not =
to emerge from recession until the second quarter.=20
However, the recession in Texas "will be more muted, and bouncing out of it=
 will also be more muted" than at the national level, Ms. Swonk said.=20
Muted or not, the slowdown is making at least one bank consider putting the=
 brakes on its ambitions in Texas.=20
Zions Bancorp of Salt Lake City, a seasoned acquirer of community banks in =
the West, has long had its sights on entering the Texas market. At an inves=
tors conference in December, chief executive Harris H. Simmons pointed out =
that Zions has branches in five of the top 10 growth markets in the country=
 but is not in the second- and third-fastest-expanding markets: Dallas and =
San Antonio.=20
"I could see us getting into Texas with the right kind of deal," Mr. Simmon=
s said. But, he added, with signs of a slowdown there "we're in no rush." R=
eached Tuesday, he said that he did not wish to add anything to that statem=
ent.=20
Increased caution on the part of out-of-state buyers would be big news for =
independent Texas banks. Of 741 banks and thrifts in the state, 714 have le=
ss than $1 billion of assets. And out-of-state banks have been eager to pur=
chase community banks, particularly in the Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth ma=
rkets.=20
In mid-December, for example, Wells Fargo announced plans to buy Tejas Banc=
shares in Amarillo for $82.5 million. Regions Financial Corp. in Birmingham=
, Ala., and BOK Financial Corp. in Tulsa, Okla., have bought several small =
banks, and Bank of Montreal has also expressed interest in Texas.=20
Though many of the acquisitions cost less than $1 billion, the deals eventu=
ally add up. The percentage of Texas deposits controlled by out-of-state ba=
nks leapt from 19.3% on June 30, 2000 to 41.9% by the end of last June.=20
Texas is not an insignificant market for larger banking companies either.=
=20
Bank One gets 14% of its deposits from the state, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. g=
ets 14% and Hibernia National Bank 13%, according to research from Goldman =
Sachs Group Inc.=20
Wells Fargo's Mr. Carlisle said that the one significant change he has seen=
 among commercial borrowers is an increased interest in restructuring their=
 debt to take advantage of lower interest rates. "We're seeing a lot of req=
uests -- certainly something we have to be prepared to do."=20
But even a delayed slowdown could deter more banks from pursuing deals in T=
exas.=20
Acquisitions aside, observers say the slowing economy will probably hurt lo=
an volume and credit quality, particularly among small-business and middle-=
market commercial borrowers.=20
Already, larger national banks such as Morgan Chase, FleetBoston Financial =
Corp., and Bank of New York Co. have said that they expect to take charges =
for this quarter because of exposure to Houston-based Enron. But it is the =
future influence of Enron's failure, the pending sale of Compaq Corp., and =
low profits at Texas-based airlines such as Continental that will hurt loan=
 volume and credit.=20
Texas is likely to experience a "more pronounced erosion in commercial midd=
le-market relating to a more-rapid-than-expected slowdown in the economy," =
said Credit Suisse First Boston bank analyst Rosalind Looby.=20
"I don't think we're looking at a meltdown, but this is going to cease to b=
e the real bright spot that it was," she said.

FORTUNE Advisor/Investing; Against The Grain
Caught Off Balance Bond sleuths were ahead on Enron. Now they have their si=
ghts on three others.
Herb Greenberg

01/21/2002
Fortune Magazine

If you learn nothing else from the Enron mess, take this lesson to heart: A=
 company's inability to handle its debt can be its downfall-- no matter how=
 much Wall Street likes its stock. Indeed, while earnings may be a window t=
o a company's psyche, the balance sheet is what gives you a truer picture o=
f its well-being. Bond analysts make a beeline to this crucial piece of fin=
ancial disclosure, paying special attention to a company's ability to servi=
ce its debt. And when the ratio of cash to debt plunges--watch out!=20
The best balance-sheet snoops are often way ahead of the pack in finding si=
gns of trouble. Sometimes, however, the big credit-rating firms, Standard &=
 Poor's and Moody's, which get paid by the companies they rate, are slow of=
f the mark--slower, as a rule, than independent bond-rating services like E=
gan-Jones of Wynnewood, Pa., or research firms like New York-based Gimme Cr=
edit. "We don't have the constraint of trying to keep a company happy," say=
s Egan-Jones President Sean Egan, whose downgrade of Enron to junk beat the=
 big guys by about a month. (To be fair, Moody's is revising how it assesse=
s companies, taking into account additional information that could lead to =
a default. Standard & Poor's, for its part, argues that its existing method=
s are adequate.)
Given the scope--and the surprise--of the Enron failure, it's worth asking:=
 Are there other companies out there that these aggressive independent cred=
it-rating agencies are flagging now? You can bet on it. We're not necessari=
ly talking future Enrons, but simply companies whose financial situation is=
 more dire than the market thinks. Certainly one where the alarm bells are =
ringing loudly (and which--don't remind me--got a positive nod from this co=
lumn a year ago) is Ford Motor. It's no secret that Ford is having serious =
problems, but you wouldn't know it from its credit rating, which is still i=
nvestment grade. Egan-Jones, however, labels it BBB-, a few notches lower t=
han the other rating agencies do and just one step above junk. That's where=
 Egan-Jones thinks Ford will arrive within six months, as the sales boost f=
rom the much heralded 0% financing starts to wane and bad auto loans pile u=
p. Junk status raises the cost of borrowing and would be particularly damag=
ing for Ford, whose ability to cover its debt has been deteriorating rapidl=
y. Egan and other bond analysts measure this by calculating a company's int=
erest coverage ratio--pretax income plus interest expense divided by intere=
st expense.=20
The ratio, which varies widely by industry, is key to credit analysis. Egan=
 calculates that Ford's interest coverage has tumbled from 2.2 in September=
 2000 to just above 1 now. "That's akin to saying that nearly everything yo=
u earn will have to be used to pay your interest expense, which doesn't lea=
ve a lot of money to invest in the business," he says. Ford responds that i=
t's "disappointed" by the Egan-Jones rating; both S&P and Moody's insist th=
ey haven't been laggards and that their ratings are appropriate.=20
Egan-Jones is even warier of computer maker Hewlett-Packard. Its credit pic=
ture is as imperiled as its proposed Compaq merger, according to Egan-Jones=
--which has already tossed the tech giant's debt on the junk heap with a ra=
ting of BB+, several notches below that of the major rating agencies. "It's=
 appropriate to view Hewlett- Packard on a stand-alone basis, which is not =
particularly attractive," Egan says. "Today it is hard to name any business=
 where it's the undisputed leader--even its printer business is being attac=
ked." Making matters worse: From October 2000, Hewlett- Packard's interest =
coverage has sunk steadily from 19 to just 6.6. (By contrast, IBM's ratio, =
according to Egan-Jones, is 11.7.) Hewlett- Packard officials couldn't be r=
eached for comment.=20
Finally, there's retailer Gap (another company this column once argued you =
should never bet against, because of its miracle-working marketing genius o=
f a CEO, Mickey Drexler). While Gimme Credit's Carol Levenson says Gap's ba=
lance-sheet condition is not yet critical, it's "not nearly as strong as it=
 used to be." Egan-Jones points out that Gap's interest coverage ratio has =
plunged from 27.3 down to 8.8 over the past four quarters. As a result, the=
 firm rates the retailer's debt one step above junk and a couple of notches=
 below that of both Standard & Poor's and Moody's ratings. Gap officials sa=
y they have never "worked" with Egan-Jones and point to the retailer's stan=
ding with the major rating agencies instead. The problem is, as Enron prove=
d, those agencies are not always the first to sound the alarm.=20

Enron plans asset sell-off to slash debt 


'We made some very bad investments,' Lay admits 

By TOM FOWLER 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 

Enron Corp. officials admitted they made serious investment errors in recent years and will step up the pace of selling off those investments, including its broadband services group and some international operations.

Those business units, which are worth as much as $8 billion, could be sold off or spun out over the next year, the company said in a conference call with analysts on Wednesday. That would bring in more cash to pay down debt and trim away money-losing operations. 

Enron Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay surprised many with a blunt assessment of the company's poor judgment in recent years that led to the rapid implosion of the energy trading giant's reputation and value in the past month. 

"In hindsight, we made some very bad investments in noncore businesses," Lay said. "The negative impact of these investments has been exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off the balance sheet. We fully understand and regret that the combination of these events has resulted in the complete loss of investor confidence." 

To help make the cuts, the company is breaking its businesses into three groups: those that are the most profitable and part of its core business, such as energy and gas trading; those that are unprofitable and nonessential, such as overseas power plants; and those that have good profit potential in the near future that are under review, such as its steel, pulp and paper-trading operations. 

The noncore operations will be sold or closed down in an orderly fashion in the next year, said President and Chief Operating Officer Greg Whalley. Those operations under review will be studied to see if they can contribute to the company's bottom line any time soon 

"These are businesses that have strong prospects and that we feel have good potential, but we'll need to look at each carefully," he said. 

The company's central businesses of energy and gas trading are not expected to be cut back significantly, Whalley said, and should remain intact until the merger. Despite reports that many employees are leaving those business groups, company officials have said repeatedly that is not the case and that top employees are being retained. A stipulation of the Dynegy-Enron merger agreement prevents Dynegy from recruiting or hiring Enron staff for a certain period, in case the purchase is not completed. 

The $8 billion in business units that could be sold in the coming year do not include Portland General Electric, the Oregon power company that was already under contract to sell for $2.9 billion next year. Nor do they include about $800 million in asset sales that are expected to close by year's end, Chief Financial Officer Jeff McMahon said. That includes about $250 million for a Brazilian gas distribution business, $266 million for a power plant in Puerto Rico and $332 million for certain offshore energy properties in India. 

The company did not file a final version of its third-quarter financial statement Wednesday as previously expected but rather said it would be five days late with the document. Enron did, however, share some more details about some of its financing partnerships, including the Marlin and Osprey investment vehicles. 

Marlin is a vehicle created to acquire Azurix, an Enron unit that owns British water utility Wessex. It has over $900 million of debt that's due in July 2003. McMahon said that if the value of Wessex is 25 percent below its current book value of $2.6 billion when Marlin's debt falls due, this would result in a charge of $650 million against earnings and stockholders' equity for Enron. 

Osprey was created to acquire energy assets and other assets, and has $2.4 billion of debt that falls due in January 2003. McMahon said that if the Osprey assets were valued at less than 25 percent of their current book value when the debt falls due it would result in a charge of $600 million against earnings and stockholders' equity for Enron. 

Analysts asked repeatedly if executives were confident that no other surprise liabilities were hiding in the books, referring to the $1 billion in equity write-downs the company reported last quarter due to several off-balance-sheet financing deals, and a restatement of 4 1/2 years of financial statements to include an additional $600 million in losses. 

McMahon said the company has gone through the books carefully, but he noted that the Securities and Exchange Commission and a special committee of the Enron board of directors were still conducting their own investigations. 

"Everything we know, you now know," Lay told the analysts. 

Lay said the fourth-quarter results are expected to be hampered by severance and restructuring costs, however, but couldn't provide more details. He said the company is also seeking an additional $500 million to $1 billion in private equity investments.

Natural Gas Futures Slip Lower=20
=20
    Natural gas futures on the NYMEX wandered lower  yesterday in uninspire=
d trading as the market consolidated following Wednesday's  surprising high=
 storage injection. Much of the trading was conducted by local  and short-t=
erm traders willing to trade for small gains, compromising price  discovery=
. El Paso and Enron were trying to coax the market up so they could  initia=
te sales. Traders anticipate todays activity to be similar to yesterdays  l=
ackluster pace. The July contract fell $0.011 to $3.79 per MMBtu and August=
  also dipped $0.011 to $3.877 per MMBtu. On Wednesday the AGA reported sto=
rage  levels at 1,398 Bcf, virtually identical to the 5-year average, and 4=
6 Bcf more  than a year ago. After several days of cool, rainy weather, muc=
h of the eastern  half of the nation will have more summer-like weather thi=
s weekend and early  next weeks. Demand use will increase significantly, bu=
t will not be unusually  high for early June. Hot weather in the southweste=
rn states will begin to move  into Texas and the Plains this weekend. Look =
for the market to continue to slip  lower in the absence of any significant=
 driving force. There needs to be  something to change the dynamics of the =
market, but in the meantime, most  everybody is on the same page, and the l=
ocals are simply trying to pick each  other's pockets. The next key level o=
f technical support is $3.60, with $4.00  and $4.20 offering resistance. Na=
tural gas for next day delivery across the US  dropped $0.05 - $0.15 per MM=
Btu, except out west where prices continued to  tumble. Canadian spot price=
s rebounded from yesterdays sharp decline. Natural  gas for next day delive=
ry at the Henry hub lost $0.07 to $3.69 per  MMBtu.

Senate Democrats to Investigate High Energy Prices
=20
    The new Democratic chairman of the  Senate  Governmental Affairs Commit=
tee says he will examine FERCs refusal to cap  wholesale power prices in we=
stern states. Following the recent shift in control  of the Senate to Democ=
rats, Senator Lieberman of Connecticut has charged that  the FERC has faile=
d to do its job, and will hold a June 20th hearing on the  matter. Presiden=
t Bush and FERC chairman Hebert are against electricity price  caps, arguin=
g they would discourage firms from building new power plants and do  nothin=
g to encourage conservation. California represents 15% of the economy and  =
any major downturn there would have rippling effects across the nation,  Li=
eberman warned. He will also hold a June 13th hearing on the impact of  der=
egulation of the electricity and natural gas industries. A subcommittee of =
 the governmental affairs panel is planning a separate investigation into t=
he oil  industry's record profits and high retail gasoline prices. =20

Canadian Producers Investigate Coal Gas
=20
    Canadian producers are counting on obtaining big natural  gas volumes f=
rom shallow coal seams. Alberta Energy, Nexen, PanCanadian  Petroleum and P=
enn West Petroleum are spending millions of dollars to  investigate whether=
 natural gas trapped in coal beds less than 3,300 feet deep  can be produce=
d economically.  The US derives 7% of its natural gas  production from coal=
 seam gas. Western Canada is estimated to have between 135  Tcf and 260 Tcf=
 of recoverable coal gas. Natural gas fields containing at least  17 Tcf ha=
ve been discovered in Canada's Far North, but bringing them to market  will=
 cost billions to build new pipelines and other facilities. Advocates say  =
many coal deposits sit near existing processing plants and transmission lin=
es,  meaning coal gas fields will be cheaper to connect and produce than Ar=
ctic  reserves. The Alberta Research Council has spent several years resear=
ching ways  to enhance coal gas production and is looking for C$12 million =

El Paso Market Power Abuse Investigation Continues

a study prepared by The Brattle Group, a Massachusetts consultant  hired by=

tifully concluded that soaring California prices were not caused by regular=

itical  economy at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government testified that Br=
attle's tale  doesnt add up. In order to prove market power, he said 3 cond=
itions must be met:  * The system for getting gas to California must not be=
 full; * El Paso Merchant  must have unutilized, but available, delivery ri=

Dynegy Seems To Have Options In Enron Deal
By Rebecca Smith and Robin Sidel
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

11/26/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A3
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

With the stock market telling Dynegy Inc. that energy trader Enron Corp. is=
n't worth even half what Dynegy has offered to pay, analysts and investors =
are paying close attention to the circumstances under which Dynegy could ba=
rgain a lower price or even walk away from the merger deal.=20
Earlier this month, Houston-based Dynegy offered to buy its far larger cros=
s-town rival in an all-stock deal that currently values Enron shares at $10=
.85 apiece, or a total of about $9.2 billion. But in the wake of post-agree=
ment disclosures by Enron that its future earnings are likely to be substan=
tially less than expected, the company's stock has been hammered. In 1 p.m.=
 trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday, Enron shares fell 30 cen=
ts to $4.71. The stock is down 94% so far this year and far short of the pe=
r-share takeover price. Dynegy shares rose 64 cents to $40.40.
Although Dynegy and Enron both say they are going ahead with the deal under=
 the terms negotiated, Dynegy does appear to have other options. The agreem=
ent with Enron contains a broad "material adverse change" clause as well as=
 some specific trigger points that could be invoked.=20
Dynegy officials performed "due diligence" throughout the holiday weekend, =
seeking to learn more about the intimate workings of Enron, which has suffe=
red a series of damaging blows. Since mid-October, Enron has disclosed that=
 some of its officers participated in personally enriching deals that moved=
 assets off Enron's balance sheet, for a time, to several private partnersh=
ips. Those deals are now the subject of a Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n investigation. Past treatment of some of those deals has been termed an "=
accounting error" by Enron and it twice has rejiggered its earnings since O=
ct. 16. At one point, Enron restated downwards nearly five years of earning=
s.=20
An Enron spokeswoman said the company was proceeding in the belief that the=
 deal would be completed as agreed. Dynegy spokesman John Sousa said the tw=
o sides are forging ahead although he acknowledged that the walk-away provi=
sions "are broad, by design, to ensure adequate protection for Dynegy share=
holders." Shareholders of both firms must still vote on the merger agreemen=
t.=20
Clauses related to a "material adverse change," also known as a "material a=
dverse effect," have been the focus of much attention among merger professi=
onals this year, due, in part, to the stock market's fluctuations and the e=
conomic slowdown that have caused some buyers to reconsider planned acquisi=
tions.=20
But such clauses rarely are invoked by a buyer or seller because they are c=
onsidered extremely difficult to prove. Both parties typically are reluctan=
t to lay out specific terms for canceling a deal, much the way a bride and =
groom often balk at negotiating a prenuptial agreement since it appears to =
envisage a breakup of the marriage even before it begins.=20
Furthermore, a key court case earlier this year affirmed widespread views t=
hat a buyer can't easily walk away from a merger. In that case, meat-proces=
sing concern Tyson Foods Inc. sought to cancel a planned acquisition of mea=
t-packer IBP Inc. due to a drop in IBP's earnings and a write-down of an IB=
P subsidiary. But a Delaware judge refused to let Tyson cancel the pact, sa=
ying Tyson had been aware of the cyclical nature of IBP's business and the =
accounting issue.=20
In a lengthy June 18 opinion, Delaware Chancery Court Vice Chancellor Leo E=
. Strine Jr. wrote that " . . . the important thing is whether the company =
has suffered a Material Adverse Effect in its business or results of operat=
ions that is consequential to the company's earnings power over a commercia=
lly reasonable period, which one would think would be measured in years rat=
her than months."=20
That interpretation has created ripples in the deal-making community, promp=
ting some transactions to include more details about circumstances under wh=
ich deals can be terminated. Since the Sept. 11 attacks, for example, a han=
dful of merger agreements have specified that future terrorist activity wou=
ld qualify as a "material adverse change," or MAC.=20
A key issue for any firm alleging there has been a material adverse change =
is "whether the new facts go to the guts of the strategic opportunity or is=
 it just a hiccup," says Meredith Brown, co-chairman of the mergers and acq=
uisitions group at law firm Debevoise & Plimpton in New York. He adds that =
a court "may be skeptical" if Dynegy claimed that Enron's post-merger agree=
ment disclosures were a surprise.=20
The Enron-Dynegy merger agreement includes several triggers permitting eith=
er side to seek termination. Enron can quit the deal if it receives a subst=
antially better offer, although it is prohibited from soliciting one. In su=
ch a case, it could be required to pay a $350 million "topper fee" to Dyneg=
y and its co-investor, ChevronTexaco Inc.=20
Dynegy can alter the deal if Enron faces "pending or threatened" litigation=
 liabilities that are "reasonably likely" to cost Enron $2 billion. If thos=
e liabilities hit $3.5 billion "an Enron material event will be deemed to h=
ave occurred," presumably allowing Dynegy to call the whole thing off. In s=
ome situations, Dynegy would be liable for a $350 million fee, as well.=20
Karen Denne, the Enron spokeswoman, said her firm doesn't believe that loss=
es arising from the normal course of business would qualify as a material e=
vent. The liability must result from litigation. Currently, the company fac=
es more than a dozen shareholder suits alleging breach of fiduciary duty by=
 officers and directors, issuing false and misleading reports and other off=
enses.=20
Deal makers who aren't involved in the combination say the steep drop in En=
ron's stock price since the merger agreement was signed wouldn't by itself =
give Dynegy the ability to cancel the pact or force Enron to renegotiate it=
s terms. Instead, they say, Dynegy would likely have to prove that Enron's =
worsening financial condition was an unanticipated event, which could be di=
fficult in light of the company's highly publicized problems and Dynegy's f=
requent statement that it clearly understands Enron's businesses. Still, th=
ere is another standard clause in the merger document that would allow Dyne=
gy to terminate the deal if "any representation or warranty of Enron shall =
have become untrue."=20
Other energy companies have abandoned deals following a widening gap in sto=
ck prices that changed an acquisition premium. Western Resources Inc. of To=
peka, Kansas last week sued Public Service Co. of New Mexico seeking hundre=
ds of millions of dollars in damages after it failed to buy Western's utili=
ties. The lawsuit accused Public Service of breaching its "duty of good fai=
th and fair dealing" and said the New Mexico company tried to "sabotage" th=
e deal as the two companies' stock prices diverged. Public Service denies t=
he accusations.

NEW YORK -- The options market dozed, as many participants stayed home to r=
ecover from too much turkey and football.=20
The Chicago Board Options Exchange's market volatility index, or VIX, which=
 measures certain Standard & Poor's 100 Index option prices to gauge invest=
or sentiment, remained in a tight range during the abbreviated trading sess=
ion the day after Thanksgiving. It fell 0.53 to 24.79.
VIX typically ranges between 20 and 30. A rise indicates traders and money =
managers are becoming anxious about the stock market; a fall shows investor=
 optimism.=20
Volatility has been dropping from post-Sept. 11 levels in recent weeks amid=
 victories over the Taliban in Afghanistan and interest-rate cuts by the Fe=
deral Reserve and other central banks. VIX ranged between 30 and 40 for sev=
eral weeks following the attacks.=20
Volatility is likely to remain low, said Mika Toikka, head of options strat=
egy at Credit Suisse First Boston. "Typically, going into the Thanksgiving =
and December holidays, we tend to experience a seasonal drift lower in impl=
ied volatility. We would expect the same this year, especially in markets o=
utside the U.S. where volatility is still lingering at high levels," Mr. To=
ikka wrote in a recent research note.=20
The CBOE's Nasdaq Volatility index, or VXN, a sentiment barometer for the t=
echnology sector, fell 1.86 to 50.82 while the American Stock Exchange's Na=
sdaq volatility index, or QQV, dropped 1.03 to 42.74.=20

Calls in Enron Corp., the embattled Houston energy and trading company, con=
tinued to trade briskly, with one investor buying 10,000 January 5 calls an=
d simultaneously selling 12,250 January 10 calls.=20
More than 14,800 of the January 5 contracts traded, compared with open inte=
rest of 3,640, as shares fell 33 cents, or 6.6%, to $4.68. These calls cost=
 $1.40 on the American Stock Exchange where most of the volume was traded.=
=20
More than 15,000 of the January 10 contracts traded, compared with open int=
erest of 30,674. These out-of-the-money calls cost 30 cents on the Amex.=20
Eli Lilly & Co.'s December 80 out-of-the-money puts also were popular Frida=
y, as shares fell 91 cents, or 1.1%, to $82.42. Morgan Stanley cut its rati=
ng on the company to neutral from outperform, saying the stock has become t=
oo expensive even with Food and Drug Administration approval of its potenti=
al blockbuster drug Xigris, which treats septic infections. More than 3,000=
 of these puts traded, compared with open interest of 6,427. They cost $1.2=

The Corporation: Acquisitions
The Other Instant Powerhouse in Energy Trading
By Louise Lee in San Mateo, Calif.

11/26/2001
BusinessWeek
96
(Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)

It's not easy being No. 4. Despite a $35 billion merger completed in Octobe=
r, ChevronTexaco Corp. is still not one of the oil superpowers. Nor, at mor=
e than $90 billion a year in revenues, is it a scrappy little guy. So Chair=
man David J. O'Reilly has been searching for a strategy beyond just drillin=
g for more oil and gas.=20
Now, he may have something: a big stake in the No. 1 energy-trading company=
. Chevron Corp. has owned 26% of Dynegy Inc. since 1996, and with Dynegy's =
planned acquisition of Enron Corp., the top energy trader, ChevronTexaco is=
 making the oil industry's most aggressive push yet into this fast-growing =
business. It plans to eventually pump $2.5 billion into the combined Dynegy=
 and Enron to maintain its 26% stake, and it might raise that share. So, wh=
ile ChevronTexaco's much bigger rivals run small in-house trading operation=
s, energy trading may soon account for more than 10% of ChevronTexaco's ear=
nings. ``Chevron is now positioned to be a leader in the business,'' says a=
nalyst Arjun Murti at Goldman, Sachs & Co.
The deal would certainly dovetail with ChevronTexaco's strategy of becoming=
 a more integrated energy company, with a hand in everything from pumping o=
il at the wellhead to trading natural-gas futures. By acquiring Texaco, Che=
vron picked up, for instance, a big refining-and-marketing business --which=
 should balance out the bad times in oil and gas production, says Eugene No=
wak, an analyst at ABN Amro. ``When crude-oil prices are down, they'll have=
 margin improvements on refining and marketing,'' he says. O'Reilly and oth=
er ChevronTexaco executives declined to comment.=20
Until now, Dynegy wasn't a big deal for Chevron. Chevron purchased the stak=
e for $700 million when Dynegy was still called NGC Corp., and it filled th=

sold nearly all its domestic natural-gas production to Dynegy. The stake ha=
s been a good investment: it is now worth $3 billion, ChevronTexaco says.=

Sitting on $2.9 billion in cash as of the end of the second quarter, Chevro=
nTexaco can well afford the Dynegy deal, analysts say. And they expect O'Re=
illy to use some of that to make more buys; the most likely target is a nat=
ural-gas company. Maybe it's not so bad being No. 4.

As Houston-based Enron Corp. imploded amid a dizzying scandal over its fina=
nces, few would have blamed Dynegy Inc. CEO Charles L. Watson if he had sat=
 back and gloated. After all, Watson had watched as his bigger, brasher cro=
sstown rival sniffed at Dynegy's more cautious strategy, all the while garn=
ering most of the credit for reshaping the energy-trading business.=20
Instead, Watson picked up the phone on Oct. 24 and called Enron Chairman, C=
EO, and longtime acquaintance Kenneth L. Lay to ask how he could help. Lay =
didn't respond immediately, but as Enron's stock continued to plunge and th=
e company faced a cash squeeze, it became clear what the only realistic ans=
wer could be: Bail us out.
So two days later, Lay invited Watson to his River Oaks home near downtown =
Houston for breakfast to discuss a deal. Over muffins and ``a bad cup of co=
ffee'' the next day, Watson recalls, they sketched the outlines, and by 10 =
p.m. that night, the investment bankers were called in. On Nov. 9, Dynegy a=
nnounced that it would pay about $10 billion, plus the assumption of $13 bi=
llion in debt, to buy Enron, which is nearly four times its size. The key t=
o the deal was Dynegy's immediate $1.5 billion infusion of cash to shore up=
 Enron's balance sheet and save its credit rating. The money came from Dyne=
gy's 26% owner, ChevronTexaco Corp.=20
Without that help, Enron--the seventh-largest U.S. company, based on its $1=
00 billion in sales last year--may well have faced bankruptcy. Watson says =
that he never would have imagined such an outcome in his wildest dreams. ``=
I don't think anybody foresaw the problems [at Enron],'' he says. ``It's be=
en incredible to watch.''=20
Watson, 51, has to make good on what may well be his riskiest investment ye=
t. If he can pull it off, the new Dynegy will have revenues of more than $2=
00 billion and $90 billion in assets, including more than 22,000 megawatts =
of power-generating capacity and 25,000 miles of pipeline. It would control=
 an estimated 20% to 25% of the energy-trading market, up from about 6% now=
.=20
That would be sweet vindication for Watson's strategy. Dynegy backs trading=
 operations with hard assets such as power plants, which allows the company=
 to guarantee a supply of electricity to a buyer. In contrast, Enron has wo=
rked furiously to shed power plants and oil- and gas-generating fields, bel=
ieving it could earn higher returns using its trading and technology expert=
ise to tap assets owned by others in markets including steel, pulp, and pap=
er. IRRESISTIBLE BARGAIN. As Enron's stock slid below $9 from its August, 2=
000, high of $90, it became a bargain that Watson couldn't pass up. It woul=
d have taken years for Dynegy to build up a market-making operation to matc=
h Enron's. Its risk-management systems are top-of-the-line. Enron's commerc=
ial-services unit, which manages power supplies for corporate customers suc=
h as Wendy's International Inc., is three or four years ahead of Dynegy's, =
says Steve Bergstrom, president of Dynegy. Watson says he still plans to ge=
t rid of the $8 billion worth of assets Lay had earmarked for sale, includi=
ng the Portland (Ore.) General Electric plant and oil and gas assets in Ind=
ia. For the $1.5 billion, though, if the deal falls through Dynegy will hav=
e the right to Enron's prized Northern Natural Gas pipeline, worth an estim=
ated $2.25 billion. And Dynegy can walk away if Enron's legal liabilities e=
xceed $3.5 billion.=20
Watson firmly believes that Enron suffered from a crisis of confidence, not=
 a meltdown of its core business. Indeed, Enron's wholesale-trading operati=
on earned $2.3 billion last year. Says Watson: ``We know the business. We l=
ooked under the hood, and guess what? It's just as strong as we thought it =
was.''=20
But the trading profits were obscured in recent weeks by Enron's accounting=
 tricks. The biggest danger for Watson is that there are other time bombs t=
icking away. Already, the company has slashed its reported earnings since 1=
997 by $591 million, or 20% of its total, to account for controversial part=
nerships involving Enron officials. The Securities & Exchange Commission is=
 still investigating. ``We believe it will take more than just a couple of =
weeks and a long-term relationship [between Watson and Lay] to do all the n=
ecessary due diligence,'' says analyst Carol Coale of Prudential Securities=
 Inc. Dynegy's Bergstrom counters: ``We're pretty certain that most everyth=
ing of material consideration has been disclosed.'' If not? The massive ear=
nings boost provides ``a high margin of error,'' he says. A WANNABE. Of cou=
rse, regulators may object to the concentration of trading operations. And =
Watson will have to mesh two very different cultures. Enron is known for it=
s intense, even cutthroat entrepreneurial spirit. Dynegy's operations are m=
ore conservative; some compare it to a fraternity. Dynegy's decision to iss=
ue new stock options to some Enron employees may soothe battered egos. It s=
hould help, too, that Lay decided not to take the $60 million golden parach=
ute he could have received in a buyout. As it is, Lay will not have a manag=
ement job with the new company.=20
Dynegy often seemed to be an Enron wannabe, following it into online tradin=
g and commercial services. Still, Dynegy's 361% stock gains last year eclip=
sed Enron's 87% rise, and it rankled some that Lay's execs got more credit.=
 ``Chuck Watson may not have been in the spotlight, but he has always been =
at the forefront of this business,'' says Bruce M. Withers, who sold his Tr=
ident NGL Inc. to Dynegy in 1995. Watson will get more attention next year-=
-he's a 15% owner of the new Houston Texans pro football team. But with his=
 bold takeover of Enron, Watson has ensured that he's off the sidelines for=
 good.

CONFUSED ABOUT EARNINGS? You're not alone. Here's what companies should do-=
-and what investors need to know

(Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)

In an age when giant earnings write-offs have become commonplace, it's hard=
 to shock Wall Street. But on Nov. 8, Enron Corp. managed to do it. After y=
ears of high-octane growth that had seen earnings surge by up to 24% a year=
, the Houston-based energy company acknowledged that results for the past t=
hree years were actually overstated by more than a half-billion dollars. It=
 was confirmation of investors' worst fears. Three weeks earlier, Enron had=
 announced a big drop in shareholders' equity, sparking fears that its hide=
ously complex financial statements were distorting its true performance. Ma=
nagement pointed to a number of factors, including a dubious decision to ex=
clude the results of three partnerships from its financial statements and a=
 billion-dollar error several years earlier that had inflated the company's=
 net worth.=20
Enron may be an extreme example of a company whose performance fell far sho=
rt of the glowing picture painted by management in its earnings releases, b=
ut it is hardly alone. This year, Corporate America is expected to charge o=
ff a record $125 billion, much of it for assets, investments, and inventory=
 that aren't worth as much as management thought (chart, page 79). Even if =
companies don't go back and restate earnings, as Enron is doing, those char=
ges cast doubt on the record-breaking earnings growth of the late '90s.
Not since the 1930s has the quality of corporate earnings been such an issu=
e--and so difficult for investors to determine. There's more at stake than =
the fortunes of those who bought shares based on misleading numbers. If eve=
n the most sophisticated financial minds can't figure out what a company ac=
tually earns, that has implications far beyond Enron. U.S. financial market=
s have a reputation for integrity that took decades to build. It has made t=
he U.S. the gold standard for financial reporting and the preeminent place =
to invest. It has also ensured ready access to capital for U.S. corporation=
s. That a company such as Enron, a member of the Standard & Poor's 500-stoc=
k index and one of the largest companies on the New York Stock Exchange, co=
uld fall so far so fast shows how badly that gold standard has been tarnish=
ed. ``The profession of auditing and accounting is, in fact, in crisis,'' s=
ays Paul A. Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve and now one of =
the leaders of the International Accounting Standards Board.=20
Sometimes, as in the case of Enron, fuzzy numbers result from questionable =
decisions in figuring net earnings. More often, though, the earnings chaos =
results from a disturbing trend among companies to calculate profits in the=
ir own idiosyncratic ways--and an increasing willingness among investors an=
d analysts to accept those nonstandard tallies, which appear under a variet=
y of names, from ``pro forma'' to ``core.'' (Enron offers its own such vers=
ion. Before investors untangled the importance of Enron's first announcemen=
t, its stock rose briefly because it told investors that its ``recurring ne=
t income'' had met expectations.) The resulting murk makes it difficult to =
answer the most basic question in investing: What did my company earn?=20
Why calculate a second set of earnings in the first place? Because the numb=
ers reached by applying generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) are=
 woefully inadequate when it comes to giving investors a good sense of a co=
mpany's prospects. Many institutional investors, most Wall Street analysts,=
 and even many accountants say GAAP is irrelevant. ``I don't know anyone wh=
o uses GAAP net income anymore for anything,'' says Lehman Brothers Inc. ac=
counting expert Robert Willens. The problem is that GAAP includes a lot of =
noncash charges and one-time expenses. While investors need to be aware of =
those charges, they also need a number that pertains solely to the performa=
nce of ongoing operations.=20
That's what operating earnings are supposed to do. But because they're calc=
ulated in an ad hoc manner, with each company free to use its own rules, co=
mparisons between companies have become meaningless. ``No investor--certain=
ly not any ordinary investor--can read these in a way that's useful,'' says=
 Harvey L. Pitt, chairman of the Securities & Exchange Commission. The SEC =
is examining whether new rules are needed to clarify financial reports and =
perhaps restrict use of pro formas.=20
What's badly needed is a set of rules for calculating operating earnings an=
d a requirement to make clear how they relate to net income. In the end, in=
vestors need two numbers--a standardized operating number and an audited ne=
t-income number--and a clear explanation of how to get from one to the othe=
r. ``OUT OF HAND.'' A widespread consensus is building to do just that. In =
early November, S&P proposed a set of rules for companies to follow when ta=
llying operating earnings. Only the week before, the Financial Accounting S=
tandards Board, the rulemakers for GAAP, had announced that they, too, woul=
d be taking up this issue. Volcker says the International Accounting Standa=
rds Board is also seeking a uniform definition of operating earnings.=20
``Over the past two or three years, the use of creative earnings measures h=
as grown and grown and grown to the point where it has really gotten out of=
 hand,'' says David M. Blitzer, S&P's chief investment strategist. ``Earnin=
gs are one of the key measures that anybody looks at when they're trying to=
 evaluate a company. If people want to use an operating-earnings measure, w=
e better all know what we're looking at.''=20
Without those standards in place, the gap between earnings according to gen=
erally accepted accounting principles and earnings according to Wall Street=
 is only going to grow wider and more confusing. Look at the variance in ea=
rnings per share calculated for the S&P 500 for the third quarter: It's $10=
.78 according to Wall Street analysts as tallied by Thomson Financial/First=
 Call, $9.17 according to S&P, and $6.37 according to numbers reported to t=
he SEC under GAAP. (S&P, like BusinessWeek, is owned by The McGraw-Hill Com=
panies.)=20
The lack of a standard measure can be costly to those who choose wrong. Use=
 First Call's earnings for the past four quarters and you get a relatively =
modest price-earnings ratio of 23 for the S&P 500. But run the numbers usin=
g GAAP earnings, and suddenly the market has a far steeper p-e of 38.=20
How did we get into this mess? Investors and analysts have been calculating=
 operating earnings for years, and for years, reasonable people could more =
or less agree on how to do it. Then came the dot-com bubble, along with inc=
reased pressure from Wall Street for companies to meet their quarterly earn=
ings forecasts. Suddenly, companies that hadn't turned a profit by any conv=
entional measure started offering ever more inventive earnings variants. Th=
ese customized pro forma calculations excluded a grab bag of expenses and a=
llowed upstart companies to show a profit. ``TOWER OF BABEL.'' Pro forma fo=
rmulas vary wildly from company to company and even from quarter to quarter=
 within the same company, casting doubt on their validity. And these days, =
the gulf between net earnings and pro forma earnings is wider than ever. S&=
P's tallies fall between the two: S&P's numbers are more systematic than pr=
o forma, but they aren't followed widely enough to be a standard. ``Investo=
rs are facing a Tower of Babel,'' says Robert K. Elliott, former chief of t=
he American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and a retired=
 KPMG partner. ``It's not standardized, and the numbers are not audited.''=
=20
That makes it tough to evaluate a company's performance. In the quarter end=
ed on Sept. 30, Nortel Networks Corp. offered shareholders at least three e=
arnings numbers to choose from. By conservative GAAP accounting, the teleco=
mmunications giant lost $1.08 a share. The company also provided two possib=
le pro forma options: a 68 cents loss that excluded ``special charges,'' in=
cluding some acquisition costs and restructuring charges, and a still bette=
r 27 cents loss that further excluded $1.9 billion of ``incremental charges=
,'' such as writing down inventories and increasing provisions for receivab=
les. Wall Street chose the rosiest one.=20
Confusing? You bet. Companies defend their pro forma calculations by pointi=
ng out that they're merely filling a void: Investors are clamoring for a me=
asure that gives them better insight into their company's future. The goal =
is to get to the core of the business and try to measure the outlook for th=
ose operations. ``There are good reasons why there is an emphasis on operat=
ing earnings,'' says Volcker. ``It is an effort to provide some continuity =
and some reflection of the underlying progress of the company.'' Besides, a=
s companies like to point out, they still have to report GAAP earnings, and=
 investors are free to ignore everything else.=20
There's no starker lesson in the shortcomings of GAAP than the $50 billion =
asset write-downs by JDS Uniphase Corp., the biggest charge of the year. Ne=
ar the height of the telecom bull market in July, 2000, the San Jose (Calif=
.) maker of fiber optics topped off a buying spree by acquiring competitor =
SDL Inc. for $41 billion in stock. When the deal closed in February, its as=
sets ballooned from $25 billion to $65 billion. But by then, shares of JDS =
and other fiber-optics makers were collapsing. To bring its acquisitions in=
to line with their new value, the company took charges of $50 billion. Desp=
ite the fact that the bulk of its losses stemmed from stock transactions an=
d involved no cash paid, GAAP required that the charges be taken out of net=
 income. So according to GAAP, JDS lost $56 billion in the fiscal year endi=
ng in June--a staggering figure for a company whose revenues over the past =
five years added up to only $5 billion.=20
Analysts and the company argue that besides not involving cash, the charge-=
off was all about the past, a right-sizing of values that had gotten out of=
 hand. To analyze the company's prospects, they excluded the $50 billion ch=
arge. ``The accounting is not designed to make things look better but to de=
scribe what happened,'' says JDS Uniphase Chief Financial Officer Anthony R=
. Muller, ``and we'll live with the consequences, whatever they are.'' Anal=
ysts make a similar defense. ``My goal is to figure out what the business i=
s going to produce so that we can value the company,'' says Lehman Brothers=
 analyst Arnab Chanda. GLACIAL PACE. Are JDS's pro forma numbers realistic-=
-a fair gauge of JDS's ongoing operations? Right now, it's hard for investo=
rs to judge. And that's the kind of ambiguity S&P and others would like to =
eliminate. In November, S&P circulated a memo on how to standardize operati=
ng earnings. Under the proposal, operating earnings would include the costs=
 of purchases, research and development, restructuring costs (including sev=
erance), write-downs from ongoing operations, and the cost to the company o=
f stock options. It would exclude merger-and-acquisition expenses, impairme=
nt of goodwill, litigation settlements, and the gain or loss on the sale of=
 an asset.=20
When S&P applied roughly that formula to JDS Uniphase, it split the differe=
nce between Wall Street and GAAP. Because of differences in what each group=
 included in their earnings calculations, the results were chaotic. Using G=
AAP, the company lost $9.39 a share. S&P figures it lost $3.19, while the c=
ompany put the loss at 36 cents. Meanwhile, Wall Street says it made 2 cent=
s.=20
The S&P standard may make sense, but it raises the question: Where is the F=
inancial Accounting Standards Board, the group in charge of GAAP? Chairman =
Edmund L. Jenkins says FASB will be addressing the problems. Still, investo=
rs shouldn't expect any improvement soon. The pace of change at FASB tends =
to be glacial. It typically takes four years to complete a new standard. In=
 1996, for example, the board realized that standards on restructuring char=
ges had some big loopholes and it resolved to put the issue on its agenda. =
In June, 2000, the board finally issued a draft of a new standard, asked fo=
r comments, and held a public hearing. In October, 2001, the board said it =
still wasn't ready to put a fix in place. Now, the recession has set off an=
other wave of restructuring charges, and the FASB still doesn't have new ru=
les.=20
The slow pace means the standard-setters sometimes fail to react to sudden =
changes in the market. The most recent failure followed the terrorist attac=
ks on September 11. An FASB task force, unable to come up with a set of rul=
es for separating September 11 costs from general expenses, instead told co=
mpanies that the disaster could not be treated as an extraordinary item. So=
 GAAP earnings include costs stemming from the disaster as part of a compan=
y's general performance. Many companies have nevertheless broken those cost=
s out in their unaudited press releases.=20
Many more are likely to do so in the fourth quarter. Indeed, 2001 is shapin=
g up to be one for the record books. A poor economy and the devastating aft=
ereffects of September 11 have resulted in a slew of unusual charges that a=
re unlikely to recur and that no one could have foreseen. But there's a gro=
wing concern that the earnings fog is providing managers with cover to hide=
 missteps of the past within that vast category of supposedly one-time char=
ges. The temptation will be to take as big a charge as possible now, while =
investors are braced for bad news. Not only can managers sweep away yesterd=
ay's errors, but tomorrow's earnings will look even better.=20
The basic question comes down to what constitutes a special expense--a char=
ge so unusual that to include it in the earnings calculation would be to di=
stort the truth about a company's performance. Usually, big charges fall in=
to a few categories, including charges for laying off workers and restructu=
ring a company, charges for assets that have lost value since they were pur=
chased, charges for investments that have lost value, and charges for inven=
tory that has become obsolete. In a recent study, Harvard Business School p=
rofessor Mark T. Bradshaw found that companies are increasingly calling the=
se charges unusual. That gives them a rationale for excluding them from the=
ir pro forma calculations.=20
Lots of critics disagree, saying such charges are often an inevitable part =
of the business cycle and should be reflected in a company's earnings histo=
ry. They certainly should not be ignored by investors. ``Charges are real s=
hareholder wealth that's been lost,'' argues David W. Tice, manager of the =
Prudent Bear Fund, a mutual fund with a pessimistic bent that's up 17% so f=
ar this year. ``It's money they spent on something no longer worth what it =
was, a correction of past earnings, or a reserve for costs moving forward. =
Whatever the reason, it's a real cost to the company, and that hurts shareh=
olders.'' Without standards, excessive write-offs from operating earnings c=
an obscure actual performance. Without any rules, companies calculate opera=
ting earnings inconsistently in order to put their companies in the best po=
ssible light. Dell Computer Corp. is a good example of this ``heads I win, =
tails you lose'' school of accounting. For years, Dell benefited from gains=
 in its venture-capital investments and was happy to include those gains in=
 its reported earnings, where they appeared as a separate line on the incom=
e statement. But this year, when those gains turned to losses, the computer=
 maker issued pro forma numbers that excluded that $260 million drag. Dell =
spokesman Michael Maher says the company's press releases and SEC filings b=
reak out investment income and give GAAP numbers as well as pro forma. ``In=
 our view, the numbers are reported clearly,'' says Maher. ``It's all out t=
here for the consuming public.'' PAST PUFFERY. Many experts believe special=
 charges are a sign that past performance was exaggerated. What should inve=
stors make of a company such as Gateway Inc.? Two restructuring charges in =
the first and third quarters, minus a small extraordinary gain, totaled $1.=
12 billion, or about $100 million more than the company made in 1998, 1999,=
 and 2000 combined. Which is the truer picture of its performance and poten=
tial? The write-offs or the earnings? Write-offs for customer financing are=
 another example. When Nortel increased its reserves for credit extended to=
 customers by $767 million in September, it effectively admitted it had boo=
ked sales in the past to companies that couldn't pay--in effect overstating=
 its performance in those earlier periods. In addition, Nortel says booking=
 sales and accounting for credit are unrelated issues. Tech companies blame=
 the sharp downturn in their industry for the big write-offs. And these are=
n't isolated examples. Peter L. Bernstein, publisher of newsletter Economic=
s & Portfolio Strategy, found that from 1989 to 1993, 20% of earnings vanis=
hed into write-offs.=20
Big charge-offs can also distort future performance. Critics contend that e=
xcess reserves are often used as a sort of ``cookie jar'' from which earnin=
gs can be taken in future quarters to meet Wall Street's expectations. Or c=
harges taken this year, for example, which is apt to be a lousy one for mos=
t companies anyway, might include costs that would otherwise have been take=
n in future periods. Prepaying those costs gives a big boost to later earni=
ngs. Rules for figuring operating earnings would help, but this is an area =
that will always involve a certain amount of judgment--and therefore invite=
 a certain amount of abuse. ``People are going to write off everything they=
 can in the next two quarters because they're having a bad year anyway,'' s=
ays Robert G. Atkins, a Mercer Management consultant.=20
Part of the lure of big special charges is that investors tend to shrug the=
m off, believing that with the bad news out in the open, the company is poi=
sed for a brighter future. Since Gateway detailed its third-quarter charge =
of $571 million on Oct. 18, Wall Street has bid the stock up 48%, compared =
with a 6% runup for the S&P 500.=20
Often, though, investors should take exactly the opposite message. If, for =
example, part of a restructuring involves slashing employee training, infor=
mation-technology spending, or research and development, the cuts could dep=
ress future performance, says Baruch Lev, a professor of accounting at the =
Stern School of Business at New York University. ``Are these really one-tim=
e events?'' he asks. ``Or is this the beginning of an avalanche?'' Indeed, =
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. strategist Steve Galbraith has found that =
in the year following a big charge-off to earnings companies have underperf=
ormed the stock market by 20 percentage points. ``LA LA LAND.'' Investors a=
re apt to be faced with more huge write-offs next year, even if the economy=
 doesn't continue to worsen. Why? The transition to a new GAAP rule that ch=
anges the way companies account for goodwill--a balance-sheet asset that re=
flects the amount paid for an acquisition over the net value of the tangibl=
e assets. Under the new rule, companies will have to assess their propertie=
s periodically and decrease their worth on the balance sheet if their value=
 falls. An informal survey by Financial Executives International of its mem=
ber controllers and financial officers found that at least a third expect t=
o take more charges.=20
But figuring out the proper value of those assets is no easy task. Unless t=
here is a comparable company or factory with an established market price, v=
aluing them involves a lot of guesswork for which there are no firm rules. =
``What this is really coming down to is corporations and their auditors com=
ing up with their own tests for impairment,'' says the Stern School's Profe=
ssor Paul R. Brown. ``It's La La Land.''=20
While the tidal wave of special charges is providing cover for earnings gam=
es, it could also be an impetus for change--especially in the wake of the d=
ot-com fiasco. Indeed, there are some signs of a backlash. The real estate =
investment trust industry was a pioneer of engineered earnings, with its ``=
funds from operations,'' or FFO. But now some REITs have begun to revert to=
 plain old GAAP earnings. Hamid R. Moghadam, CEO of San Francisco-based AMB=
 Property Corp., shifted back to GAAP in 1999. ``The reason I don't like FF=
O is very simple,'' says Moghadam. ``One company's numbers look better than=
 another one's even if they had identical fundamental results.''=20
There are other steps FASB could take to improve financial reporting and re=
store GAAP's status. Trevor S. Harris, an accounting expert at Morgan Stanl=
ey, says it could force companies to make clear distinctions between income=
 from operations and income from financial transactions. Lehman's Willens s=
ays companies should provide more information on cash expenses and how they=
 bear on earnings. An easy step would be to require companies to file their=
 press releases with the SEC.=20
At the least, says Lev, companies must clearly explain how their pro forma =
numbers relate to the GAAP numbers. Otherwise, he says, investors ``see num=
bers floating there, and where did they come from?'' In today's environment=
 of unregulated pro forma calculations and supersize write-offs, no questio=
n is more important to investors.

High-Gloss Glossary
Companies are using a variety of accounting practices to put the best spin =
on
their results. Here's what those terms mean:
DEFINING EARNINGS:
NET INCOME
The bottom line, according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAA=
P).
Sometimes called ``reported earnings,'' these are the numbers the Securitie=
s &
Exchange Commission accepts in its filings.
OPERATING EARNINGS
An adjustment of net income that excludes certain costs deemed to be unrela=
ted
to the ongoing business. Although it sounds deceptively like a GAAP figure
called ``operating income'' (revenue minus the costs of doing business), it=
 is
not an audited figure.
CORE EARNINGS
Another term for operating earnings. Neither core nor operating earnings ar=
e
calculated according to set rules. They can include or exclude anything the
preparer wishes.
PRO FORMA EARNINGS
The 1990s term for operating earnings. Popularized by dot-coms, it sometime=
s
excludes such basic costs as marketing and interest.
EBITDA
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. The
granddaddy of pro forma, it was initially highlighted by industries that
carried high debt loads, such as cable TV, but has since come to be widely
quoted.
ADJUSTED EARNINGS
A new term for pro forma.
DEFINING COSTS:
SPECIAL CHARGES

GOODWILL IMPAIRMENTS
The same idea as asset impairments except they're used to write down the

WRITE-DOWN
Lowering the value of an asset, such as a plant or stock investment. It is

What did the company earn? That's the most basic question an investor can e=
ver ask. The equity culture that has generated so much growth over the year=
s depends on a clear answer, but getting one has become impossible. Enron C=
orp. just announced that its earnings for the past three years were oversta=
ted by half a billion dollars. How did one of the biggest companies on the =
New York Stock Exchange manage to inflate its earnings by 20% without audit=
ors, analysts, ratings agencies, and the business press (BusinessWeek inclu=
ded) discovering it? In part, blame the breakdown of standardized accountin=
g rules and the anarchy that runs rampant in the financial statements of Co=
rporate America. The U.S. needs a new set of accounting rules that gives a =
clear picture of financial performance. Without integrity in financial repo=
rting, the U.S. cannot hope to remain the preeminent place to invest in the=
 global marketplace (page 76).=20
The dot-com bubble was the first indication that there was something seriou=
sly wrong with accounting standards. Companies without much of a business m=
odel customized their quarterly statements to exclude a grab bag of expense=
s in order to put a positive financial spin on their operations. Wall Stree=
t conspired in this and encouraged big companies to join in. Soon, the meth=
od of calculating earnings began to vary from company to company and even f=
rom quarter to quarter within a company. It is now chaos.
A stricter adherence to accounting rules won't solve the entire problem. GA=
AP, the generally accepted accounting principles, allow all kinds of one-ti=
me expenses and noncash charges. This obscures the performance of ongoing o=
perations. No one can fathom what are true operating earnings because there=
 are no guidelines as to what constitutes an extraordinary expense. The res=
ult is total confusion. Take earnings per share for the Standard & Poor's 5=
00-stock index for the second quarter. Under Thomson Financial/First Call s=
tandards, it is $11.82. But it's $9.02 according to S&P and $4.83 under GAA=
P. How can investors make intelligent decisions?=20
The Financial Accounting Standards Board clearly is failing to do its job. =
It has promised to write a set of rules that calculates operating earnings =
and relates them to net earnings, but it hasn't delivered. The rating agenc=
y Standard & Poor's (owned by The McGraw-Hill Companies, as is BusinessWeek=
) is doing a better job. It recently drew up a definition of ``operating ea=
rnings'' that includes restructuring costs (including severance), writedown=
s from ongoing operations, and the cost of stock options. It excludes merge=
r and acquisition expenses, litigation settlements, impairment of goodwill,=
 and gains or losses on asset sales. This is a beginning that FASB should b=
uild on. The accounting anarchy has to end.

Schwab Chief's Main Theme: Diversification
By Lynnette Khalfani
Dow Jones Newswires

11/26/2001
The Wall Street Journal
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -- More than two months after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, many=
 investors remain edgy. But the stock market, after an initial selloff, has=
 shown remarkable resilience.=20
Few observers expect stock-market volatility to subside soon. Still, expert=
s say that now, more than ever, is the time for skittish investors to keep =
their wits about them.
In a recent interview, Charles R. Schwab, chairman and co-chief executive o=
f Charles Schwab & Co., the San Francisco-based online and discount brokera=
ge firm, gave his views on what investors should be doing -- and what mista=
kes they should avoid.=20
Here are some excerpts from the interview:=20
In the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, how much more risk, if any, do you thi=
nk is in the financial markets? Or do you think it's just that people's per=
ceptions about risk have changed?=20
I've been investing since 1959, and I have to say that, year after year, th=
e risk hasn't changed. The risk is always there. There's risk in investing =
in stocks, bonds and even U.S. Treasuries because of interest-rate [fluctua=
tions]. There's risk in real estate, too.=20
So the question is: How do you handle it? The best way is to diversify. Ove=
r a long period of time, people who diversify their investments do pretty d=
arned well. When they don't . . . sometimes it's fatal. If the only stock a=
n investor owned was Enron . . . or Cisco at 70, that was pretty fatal.=20
What do you say to people who say they're too scared to invest right now? T=
hat because of the threat of terrorism, the anthrax scares, the war in Afgh=
anistan, the recession, and so forth, there's just too much uncertainty in =
the markets?=20
I remember back during the Cuban missile crisis, we all feared the worst. W=
e were all building bomb shelters. It was a scary time. This terrorist thin=
g is no different. It's awful -- particularly for our children. But this co=
untry is so wealthy, in terms of its resources, intellectual capital and th=
e strength of our government.=20
There is no more uncertainty today than in times past. For example, we've h=
ad many recessions. It's not fun, especially when you begin reading about a=
ll these layoffs. In fact, I think the unemployment rate [now at 5.4%] pret=
ty easily might get to 6.5% before it gets better. And it probably won't ge=
t better until March or April. Also, the stock market will go up, hopefully=
 before the economy goes up.=20
There's $2 trillion sitting in money-market accounts. That's a huge resourc=
e and buying power that's definitely available for new investments.=20
What do you think is the biggest mistake investors have made over the past =
two or so months?=20
They let their emotions take over. With the fear that people had, they didn=
't use their rational thinking. They used their emotional thinking. [After =
Sept. 11], they sold at the low, and fear was the driver.=20
Just a year and a half ago, the driving emotion was greed. You're not going=
 to avoid this stuff. So the issue is how you manage through these cycles o=
f fear and greed. Even when I'm fearful of something, I say to myself: "Thi=
s is still the time to invest."=20
My biggest worry right now is that people will give up and say, "I just don=
't want to be in the stock market at all." And it's just the time that peop=
le should be hanging on and keeping a diversified portfolio.=20
Some other mistakes: A lot of people hang on to the stock that was the post=
er child of the last cycle. Or people say, "I'll get back in [the market] w=
hen I see the economy turn around." Well, by the time they see that, it's t=
oo late. They will have missed the whole ride back up.

Enron Pursuing a Cash Infusion Energy: Company is seeking as much as $1bill=

HOUSTON -- Enron Corp. said talks are continuing with potential investors f=
or an infusion of as much as $1 billion as the biggest energy trader tries =
to avoid a collapse of its planned purchase by Dynegy Inc.=20
An investment would ease concern that Enron's weakened finances may prompt =
Dynegy to pull out of or renegotiate the terms of the transaction, which is=
 valued at $23 billion in stock and assumed debt.
Enron is seeking an additional $500 million to $1 billion in cash but would=
n't divulge details. "We are not going to discuss the particulars of who we=
 are talking to," Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said Sunday.=20
Shares of the Houston company fell by 48% in the last three trading session=
s on the New York Stock Exchange. At Friday's closing price of $4.71, the s=
tock sells for less than half the $10.85 that Dynegy is slated to pay in th=
e acquisition. That's a sign investors are skeptical the transaction will g=
o through as planned.=20
Enron is likely to have approached Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts & Co., Blacksto=
ne Group and Carlyle Group for a private equity investment, said industry a=
nalyst David Snow of PrivateEquityCentral.Net.=20
The firms have declined to comment.=20
In a conference call Nov. 14, Enron Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon=
 said the company is in talks with several private investors and expects to=
 receive $500 million to $1 billion from those sources.=20
On Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve from lenders on a $690-millio=
n note due this week, gaining more time to restructure its finances. Dynegy=
 Chief Executive Chuck Watson said he was "encouraged" by the commitment to=
 extend the note payment as well as the closing of a $450-million credit fa=
cility. He said Dynegy remained committed to the purchase.=20
Enron already received $1.5 billion in cash Nov. 13 from ChevronTexaco Inc.=
 as part of the Dynegy buyout agreement. In return, Dynegy received preferr=
ed stock and other rights in an Enron unit that owns the Northern Natural G=
as Co. pipeline. Under the deal's terms, if Dynegy and Enron fail to merge,=
 Dynegy can acquire the pipeline company.=20
But Barron's reported over the weekend that Dynegy's right to the pipeline =
might be challenged by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Salomon Smith Barney Inc=
., which accepted the asset as collateral for $1billion in loans to Enron.=
=20
Dynegy spokesman John Sousa declined to comment on Enron's attempts to secu=
re financing or whether more cash for Enron is a condition of keeping the m=
erger alive.=20
Enron's dealings with affiliated partnerships have led to a federal investi=
gation of the company, which restated its earnings and saw its credit ratin=
gs cut.=20
The company said in a Securities and Exchange filing a week ago that it has=
 less than $2 billion in cash and credit lines left.

Dynegy Optimistic That Enron Merger Will Succeed - FT

11/26/2001

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Dynegy Inc. (DYN) remains optimistic, after further re=
view of Enron Corp.'s (ENE) finances last week, that it will be able to buy=
 the company, the Financial Times reported Monday.=20
Dynegy said that it, "remained optimistic for the potential of the merger t=
o be completed, and in the time frame we originally announced - six to nine=
 months," the FT reported.
Critical investment in Enron by J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup will procee=
d only if an unofficial pact between Enron, Dynegy, and Enron's lenders and=
 credit rating agencies remains intact, the report said. Investment from th=
ese two is likely to total between $500 million and $1 billion, while Enron=
 continues to look for a further $500 million from private equity firms.=20
The deal suffered a setback last week, when a regulatory filing revealed a =
greater debt burden than some investors had realized. Enron's share price f=
ell following the report, to $4.74 from $9.00.=20
A $1 billion secured credit line from J.P. Morgan Chase and an extension of=
 a $690 million repayment due Tuesday weren't enough to keep the share pric=
e from falling. This led to speculation that Dynegy was considering renegot=
iating its all-stock bid, now at $9.3 billion, compared with Enron's market=
 value of $3.5 billion, said the report.=20
Renegotiating the deal wouldn't have any impact on Enron's finances, unname=
d sources told the FT.=20
But if Dynegy pulled out of the deal altogether, there might be no cash inf=
usion from J.P. Morgan chase and Citigroup. Credit ratings agencies could t=
hen downgrade Enron's debt to junk, forcing partners to repay debts, the re=
port said.=20

Dynegy Purchase Prompts Antitrust Concerns, L.A. Times Says
2001-11-26 07:36 (New York)


     Washington, Nov. 26 (Bloomberg) -- California Attorney
General Bill Lockyer is examining Dynegy Inc.'s proposed
acquisition of rival energy seller Enron Corp. for possible
antitrust violations, the Los Angeles Times reported.

     The California Independent System Operator, which manages the
state's electric grid, has asked federal regulators to ban Dynegy
and other major power sellers, including Mirant, and AES Corp.'s
Williams Cos., from selling electricity at market prices in the
state, the Times said.

     Throughout the state's power crisis, Governor Gray Davis and
other officials accused Dynegy, Enron and other power companies of
withholding electricity and manipulating the cost of wholesale
power to gouge consumers, the Times said.

     Enron is negotiating with bankers to restructure $9.15
billion in debt.

     ``I would hope that the people who look at the antitrust
implications would consider this one carefully,'' California State
Senator Steve Peace, a Democrat, told the Times. ``If anything,
Dynegy would be in an even stronger position to be able to
manipulate markets than it was before.''

The Enron scandal
A V Rajwade

11/26/2001
Business Standard

Copyright (c) Business Standard

Enron has always been recognised by other companies as best practice in ris=
k management. It put in systems to manage risks on a real-time basis and ha=
d very strong management." James Lam, founder of eRisk, a consulting firm.=
=20
As an occasional teacher and more regularly a student of the subject of man=
agement of price risks, I have been an admirer of Enron's elaborate disclos=
ure of its risk management practices. And yet, in a cascade of events over =
a period of just three weeks from mid-October, it lost two-thirds of its sh=
are value, became the subject of a US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) =
investigation, and was taken over by a rival a third in size. (Latest repor=
ts create some doubt about whether this will go through.) What went wrong?
No, the events had nothing to do with Dabhol. Indeed, if, for us in India, =
Enron will always be associated with the controversial power project, elsew=
here it is likely become a case study for students of accounting, finance a=
nd general management. (On second thoughts, even its Indian adventures woul=
d make an excellent case study!)=20
But first, a recount of what happened. After announcing on October 16, with=
out much explanation or transparency, that it has taken a charge of $ 1.2 b=
illion against equity, Enron's share price started tumbling. Apparently, th=
e charge was the result of some financial transactions, and the SEC launche=
d an investigation. The chief financial officer (CFO), who was directly inv=
olved with the transactions, the company's treasurer and a couple of other =
senior officials were sacked.=20
Perhaps most damagingly, Enron revised its accounts from 1997 onwards, redu=
cing profits by about $ 600 million and increasing debt by a somewhat simil=
ar amount. As a result, Enron's credit rating was downgraded.=20
It seems the root problem was not in its basic business of power and gas tr=
ading, but in its investment activities controlled by the CFO. These compri=
sed private equity, and Enron's share in each of the investee companies was=
 kept artificially below 50 per cent to avoid consolidation of accounts. To=
 this end, outside investors were brought in and assured of equity in Enron=
 itself, should the value of the investee company(ies) fall below agreed th=
reshold(s).=20
All this was done to keep the losses in investments off-balance sheet, and =
mitigate their impact on reported profits. Many other US corporations inclu=
ding J P Morgan Chase, which had large private equity investments, have suf=
fered on this score (see World Money October 15). Enron wanted to avoid thi=
s and, last year, paid its since-dismissed CFO $ 30 million for his creativ=
e accounting genius.=20
Incidentally, those enamoured of US GAAP and its alleged superiority over t=
he rest of the world should note that all these gimmicks were blessed by th=
e company's auditors one of the Big Five firms, which was paid $ 25 million=
 as audit fees and $ 27 million for other services by Enron last year.=20
The restatement of the accounts from 1997 onwards became necessary as the E=
nron management/board and the auditors were forced, on review, to admit tha=
t at least some of the transactions should have been on, rather than off, b=
alance sheet. Details of all the transactions in question are yet to come o=
ut, but what has come out is bad enough.=20
But this apart, a billion dollar hit for a company of the size ($ 300 billi=
on) or cash flow ($ 3 billion) of Enron is, by itself, hardly a death warra=
nt. But it turned out to be just that for Enron.=20
Perhaps because it was too arrogant? Perhaps also because its accounts lack=
ed transparency and their opaqueness ensured that investors' confidence was=
 always somewhat fragile?=20
But there are two other points worth noting: the professionalism of equity =
analysts and whether the event restores somewhat the balance between tradin=
g and producing. As for the first, the professional analysts were surely aw=
are of the opaqueness of the accounts,but few questioned the management agg=
ressively on the subject. Perhaps the stock was too glamorous and typified =
the spirit of the times trading assets was what the "masters of the univers=
e" did, not the boring old business of producing oil or power or cars. The =
Enron management itself was proud of the way it operated in its principal a=
ctivity of trading in power and gas, with Skilling, the former CEO, claming=
 that "we are on the side of angels. We are taking on the entrenched monopo=
lies. We are bringing the benefits of choice and free markets to the world.=
" (The quotation is from an interview in BusinessWeek, prior to Skilling's =
inglorious exit from Enron a couple of weeks before the bubble burst).=20
For the analysts, there was also safety in numbers. Skilling claimed that "=
Enron's operations are built around the integration of modern financial tec=
hnologies and physical technologies", bringing derivatives theory to tradin=
g in power and gas! Obviously, the fate of Long Term Capital Management has=
 not led to more sober management of trading risks.=20
Surely the role of "markets" should be to reduce the distance, and cost, be=
tween producer and consumer? One does feel that there is something perverse=
 in a society that values, in terms of compensation, the trader (don't forg=
et this is just a euphemism for the speculator) over the producer whether i=
n the bond, currency or power and gas markets. The markets and, indeed, gre=
ed obviously have a role to play, but surely the pendulum needs to swing a =
little bit to the left?

union minister of state for power, comments on reports of Aditya
Birla Group, which owns Grasim Industry Ltd., the nation's third-
biggest cement maker, bidding for Enron's stake in Dabhol Power
Co.

     Enron wants to sell its 65 percent stake in Dabhol Power,
India's biggest foreign investment, at cost. The project is mired
in a tariff dispute over $64 million in bills that haven't been
paid by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, its only
customer, for eight months.

     ``One more bidder will increase competition, which is
welcome.

     ``Any step in the national interest is good.

     ``Cheap energy is always in the national interest since we
want to increase electricity generation and sell it at a
reasonable price.

     ``I can't comment on the time-frame of buying out the Enron
stake until the legal wrangles are solved. Once that's cleared,
then we will try and clear the proposal quickly.''

To All -

Attached is an updated version of the Intercontinental Exchange Participant Agreement - complete with schedules for transaction costs in various commodities.  This form is a new version of the existing Participant Agreement Enron currently has in place and is anticipated to be effective on December 1, 2001.  While I have been reviewing the legal terms and conditions, I need some assistance from you - the business personnel - on the pricing stated in the applicable schedules.  These price schedules have all been updated from the existing contracts.

At your convenience, please review the schedule applicable to your particular commodity or forward it to the appropriate person for review.  Please let me know if the pricing is acceptable.  Granted, since this is a form agreement we may not have much power to change any pricing, but I at least want each of you to be aware of the changes.

Thanks.


Mark


For Attorneys - I welcome any comments you may have on the agreement.  I will also be circulating a draft with my comments.

USA: Enron reps met 6 times with Cheney or his staff.

01/08/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

WASHINGTON, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Representatives of the collapsed energy giant Enron Corp. met six times with Vice President Dick Cheney or staff from his energy task force, the White House has told a Democratic lawmaker. 
In a Jan. 3 letter to Rep. Henry Waxman, vice presidential counsel David Addington said that Enron's Chairman Kenneth Lay met Cheney once during the development of the administration's energy plan. Cheney has already acknowledged this publicly.
But the Addington letter also revealed five further meetings with Cheney's energy task force staff, three of which took place before the White House energy policy was announced in May and two afterwards. 
Enron's financial position was not discussed in any of the meetings, Addington's letter to Waxman said. Waxman, a California Democrat and ranking member of the Government Reform Committee, released the Addington letter on Tuesday. The lawmaker had written to Cheney's office seeking information on Enron's possible influence on administration policy. 
"Enron did not communicate information about its financial position in any of the meetings with the Vice President or with the National Energy Policy Development Group's support staff," said the Addington letter. 
Waxman, in a reply addressed to Cheney, noted the meetings with Cheney or his energy task force staff had stretched from last Feb. 22 to Oct. 10, just a few days before Enron announced a reduction in shareholder equity ahead of its spectacular collapse. 
"For the first time, the letter from Mr. Addington provides some limited details about the contacts between Enron and the energy task force," Waxman told Cheney. "It reveals that Enron had extensive access to the task force, meeting in person six times with you or the task force staff to discuss 'energy policy matters'".

USA: Enron gets bids for trading operations-sources.

01/08/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

NEW YORK, Jan 8 (Reuters) - At least two banks submitted bids for a controlling stake in Enron Corp.'s dormant energy trading business, likely ensuring its revival in coming weeks, people familiar with the company's plans said Tuesday. 
Enron, which declared bankruptcy on Dec. 2, received bids from Citicorp Inc. and UBS Warburg for the Houston-based energy trading operations. But a third financial institution that previously expressed interest, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. , declined to submit a bid by last night, the deadline for bids for the Enron assets, these people said.
Citicorp, UBS Warburg and J.P. Morgan declined to comment on any interest in Enron assets. Enron officials could not be reached. 
The deadline brought news of a new party that may be interested in Enron's trading operations, once the world's biggest trader of contracts for natural gas and other energy commodities, 
British oil giant BP Plc also said it may be interested in the operations. BP said it had submitted a bid of $25 million for a small portion of Enron's assets, including some back office functions and information technology assets, but said it may be interested in other assets as well. 
Enron has all but shut down its Houston-based trading operations while it seeks a financial backer that could guarantee contracts. 
Previously, Citicorp, J.P. Morgan and UBS Warburg had expressed interest in this role, according to people familiar with the company's plans. 
It is unclear whether there have been other bids for the trading operations. The company is slated to decide on Thursday whether to accept a bid. Enron lawyers previously stated that the company is not looking for cash bids, but rather an ownership stake of up to 51 percent. 
Any bid for the trading operations must be approved by Judge Arthur Gonzalez of the Southern District of New York bankruptcy court, which is overseeing Enron's Chapter 11 bankruptcy case. 
Enron is offloading the trading operations to generate cash to pay off as much as $40 billion in debt. 
Enron collapsed after disclosures of hidden debt in off-balance sheet transactions destroyed investor confidence in the Houston-based company. Enron's advisors have made it a priority to revive the trading operations, which have all but stalled in the wake of the bankruptcy filing.

USA: REPEAT-BP bids $25 million for Enron back office/IT assets.

01/08/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

NEW YORK, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Oil major BP has bid $25 million for a small portion of Enron Corp.'s assets, mainly back office functions and information technology systems, a company spokeswoman said on Tuesday. 
Enron's full energy trading business is scheduled to be auctioned in a federal bankruptcy court on Jan. 10.
"We're bidding for software, business processes, and license rights," the BP spokeswoman said. 
Once the world's leading energy trader, Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in December, after questions around its financial dealings led to the company's collapse. 
BP may be interested in bidding for other Enron assets if the current auction process breaks down, the spokeswoman added.

BP Says Submitted $25M Bid For Enron Support Systems
By Michael Wang

Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- U.K. integrated oil major BP PLC (BP) said Tuesday that it has submitted a $25 million offer to buy Enron Corp.'s (ENE) computer settlement support systems used to process the trading of energy products.
"The bid was made yesterday (Monday)," BP spokesman Roddy Kennedy told Dow Jones Newswires. "We are interested in the technology. It would improve our marketing capacity." 
BP is one of the top 10 marketers of natural gas in the U.S., selling volumes of over 12 billion cubic feet a day. 
The support systems are primarily used in back-office activities involving the settlement and administration of natural gas and electricity contracts. 
BP's bid for the technology will go into an "auction" Thursday, when Enron's advisers are expected to press bidders to improve their offers. Results are expected to be known Friday. 
The bidding process follows Enron's collapse last month, when it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy law protection. The process allows Houston-based Enron time to reorganize its activities while keeping creditors at bay. 
The revelation that BP is bidding for a back-office processing system comes after the Wall Street Journal Europe reported Tuesday that it had submitted an offer for Enron's energy-trading arm, EnronOnline, considered a prominent asset in the tangled portfolio of the broke energy concern. 
Kennedy denied that BP has submitted a bid for EnronOnline. 
But he added that the oil company would be prepared to "negotiate on a non-binding basis" other unspecified Enron businesses, if the current auction process is abandoned. 
"If the (bidding process) doesn't work out, we would be willing to negotiate certain other parts of the business," Kennedy said. He wouldn't elaborate.

Cornyn asks for committee of former Enron employees

AUSTIN (AP) - Attorney General John Cornyn has asked a federal bankruptcy court in New York to appoint a committee of former Enron Corp. employees to voice their interests as the fallen energy giant wades through its massive Chapter 11 case. 
"I am very concerned by the countless stories of former employees who lost their life savings in 401(k) plans when Enron and its affiliates sought bankruptcy protection," Cornyn said in a news release Tuesday.
He said the 4,500 employees laid off from the company's Houston headquarters soon after Enron filed for bankruptcy in New York on Dec. 2 "deserve a resounding voice in Enron's reorganization." More than 2,800 of those former employees have filed claims for unemployment benefits, Cornyn said. 
Deputy Attorney General Jeff Boyd was among several lawyers representing creditors who argued Monday that Enron's bankruptcy should be transferred to Houston. Boyd argued on behalf of several state agencies with Enron claims. 
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Arthur Gonzalez said he would rule on the transfer requests by the end of the week.

Cal-ISO To File Price Estimates For FERC Refund Case

01/08/2002
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

(This article was originally published Monday) 

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The California Independent System Operator will file with federal regulators by Thursday its estimate of what electricity prices would have been if current price controls had been in place between Oct. 2000-May 2001, an ISO spokesman confirmed Monday.
The information will be used by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to determine if and how much generators must refund to power buyers for overcharging during that period. 
A Dec. 19 FERC order set a ceiling price for West Coast power during times of high demand at $108 per megawatt hour, which the ISO will use in making its calculations. The previous ceiling price, adopted in June, was $92/MWh. 
The upcoming ISO filing won't apply the revised prices to specific market transactions, meaning there will be no estimate of what certain generators owe, said ISO spokesman Gregg Fishman. 
"We are asking FERC to use this incarnation of calculations as a basis for moving forward. If we discover reasons we need to rework these numbers again, fine, but let's not wait to move forward," on hearings, Fishman said. 
FERC is expected to set a hearing schedule on the refund case Tuesday. 
California officials say generators overcharged the state $8.9 billion and were largely responsible for the state's energy crisis. Generators deny the claim. 
Generators involved in the FERC case include Reliant Energy Inc (REI), Calpine Corp (CPN), Mirant Corp (MIR), Dynegy Inc (DYN), the Williams Companies (WMB), Duke Energy Corp (DUK), and Enron Corp (ENE).

Democrats: Don't Gloat About Enron

As Congress gears up for hearings on Enron's $60 billion collapse, some Democrats are savoring a chance to investigate links between the company and its many G.O.P. friends in the White House and Congress. But the scandal may wind up tainting Democrats as well. Florida's state pension fund, which lost $325 million on Enron, is examining, as part of a broader inquiry, what role Frank Savage, a major Democratic donor, may have played in the state's loss. The fund's investments were directed by Alliance Capital Management, where Savage was a senior executive and chairman at the same time he sat on Enron's board. 
State officials want to know whether he inappropriately pushed Enron's stock on the pension fund while the energy giant was failing. Alliance more than doubled the state's stake in Enron since last August, buying 5.6 million shares in three months, even as stock prices fell and analysts questioned the firm's management and accounting practices. Coleman Stipanovich, deputy executive administrator of the pension fund, said his staff would like to learn what Savage knew of Enron's internal problems and what, if anything, he passed on to fund managers at Alliance. "We're going to want to be satisfied there was no undue influence," he told TIME.
An Alliance spokesman said Savage, who headed an international subsidiary until leaving the firm in August, had no influence on Enron trading. Savage did not return calls for comment. Since joining Enron's heavily Republican board in 1999, he has donated $100,000 to Democrats and is raising money for New York gubernatorial candidate Carl McCall. Which proves, if nothing else, that Enron was a bipartisan debacle.

Investigators To Take Hard Look At Enron's Board

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Investigation into the collapse of Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) has already put its top executives and accountants in the hot seat.
Now they may be joined by the company's board, which includes former Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair Wendy Gramm, the wife of Republican U.S. Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas. 
Lawmakers will hear from two Enron board members next week. Congressional committees probing the matter expect testimony from William Powers, who headed an internal investigation, and Robert Jaedicke, an accounting professor and former Stanford University business school dean who is the chairman of Enron's audit committee. 
Audit committees were put in the spotlight by former Securities and Exchange Committee chairman Arthur Levitt. Levitt pushed through rules to require audit committees to include independent members with financial expertise and require the auditors to ask tough questions about a company's accounting. 
Whether Enron's audit committee failed as badly as the company did remains to be seen. The Houston energy firm filed for bankruptcy in December after announcing it had overstated financial results for nearly five years. Enron and its accountants are under investigation by Congress, federal prosecutors and the SEC. 
Examination of audit committee members is standard in such cases, and given her expertise in derivatives, Gramm, director of regulatory studies at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, could get special attention. She joined Enron's board after leaving the CFTC in 1993 and serves on its audit committee. 
As the wife of the Phil Gramm, Gramm won't get special treatment, however, said Charles Elson, director of the Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. 
"She will rise or fall based on her own conduct," he said. 
At a minimum, Elson said Enron's audit committee should have seen "a lot of red flags raised," starting with "highly unusual" off-the-books partnerships tied to Enron's former chief financial officer Andrew Fastow. 
Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's outside auditor, also acted as its internal auditor and did significant consulting work for Enron. Moreover, Elson noted, a number of Andersen executives took high-ranking positions at Enron. He said that should have prodded the board to question Andersen's independence - which is required under the strict new SEC rules - and Enron's accounting treatment, including related-party deals kept off the company's books. 
"You have to ask yourself what these folks were thinking," said Elson. "If they were aware of it and didn't press it, they've got some problems." 
W. Neil Eggleston, the attorney representing Enron's independent directors, declined to comment on their behalf.

Enron May Have Compromised Its Internal Inquiry, Democrats Say
2002-02-01 15:38 (New York)

     Washington, Feb. 1 (Bloomberg) --  Enron Corp. may have compromised its own investigation of the events leading to the energy trader's bankruptcy by appointing one of its board members to the panel, Democratic lawmakers said.
     As a board member, Herbert Winokur Jr. approved many of the partnerships in which Enron hid about $600 million of its debt, contributing to the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history, wrote Representatives John Dingell, senior Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and Peter Deutsch, the lead Democrat on an investigative subcommittee. Their letter went to William Powers, dean of the University of Texas law school, who's heading the internal Enron investigating commmittee.
     Powers is expected to release his report this weekend and answer questions next week before two congressional committees, including House Energy and Commerce Committee. The letter shows the line of questioning the Democrats are likely to take.
     Dingell and Deutsch said that Winokur had knowledge of the LJM partnership and recommended that an Enron ethics policy be waived so that then-Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow could invest in the LJM1 and LJM2 partnerships. Fastow made $30 million from his investments in the partnerships.
     "Mr. Winokur is essentially investigating his own actions and approving or disapproving the resulting report,'' the lawmakers wrote. ``You can understand why disinterested observers might conclude that the report's independence, or at least the appearance of independence, has been compromised.''
     The other members of Enron's internal investigating panel are Frank Savage, chief executive officer of Savage Holdings LLC, and Paulo Ferraz Pereira, executive vice president of Brazil's Group Bozano.
     In the letter, the lawmakers said that Winokur's position as chairman of the board of Azurix Corp., a water company created in part by Enron, cast doubt on his ability to be part of an impartial probe. Winokur sold 22,500 shares of the company to Enron for $184,275 before shareholders sued the company, saying it misled investors.

SEC Faulted Audit Oversight for Years, Letters Show
2002-02-01 11:40 (New York)

     Washington, Feb. 1 (Bloomberg) -- Securities and Exchange Commission chief accountants pressured the accounting profession's oversight group for more than four years to strengthen safeguards intended to make sure audits are accurate, complete and objective, SEC documents show.
     In letters to the Public Oversight Board spanning more than four years, SEC chief accountants faulted the industry's ability to enforce audit standards and guard against conflicts of interest through "peer reviews,'' in which accounting firms check one another's systems for preventing bad audits. Then-SEC Chief Accountant Lynn Turner asked why peer reviews always gave the biggest firms good grades while the number of failed audits was growing.
     "We have seen more of these in the past six months than at any time during my three years,'' Turner wrote in July 2001 to oversight board Chairman Charles Bowsher. ``Why is there nothing showing up in the reports from the peer reviews regarding this increasing problem?''
     Congress and the SEC are scrutinizing the accounting industry's ability to monitor audit quality and punish violations of auditing rules, as federal investigators probe auditor Arthur Andersen LLP's role in inaccurate financial statements at Enron. Documents sent by the SEC to the oversight board from 1997 to 2001 were released to Bloomberg News under the Freedom of Information Act.
     Enron stock tumbled 99 percent over seven weeks before the Houston energy trader filed for bankruptcy reorganization in December. The fall wiped out $26 billion in market value, wiped out 5,000 jobs and erased about $850 million in employees' 401(k) retirement investments in Enron shares.

'A Crisis First'

     "For anything to happen in government, there has to be a crisis first,'' former SEC accounting fellow Thomas I. Selling said, when asked whether the peer review process for auditors has become more rigorous under the SEC's prodding. ``I don't know of any profession where peer review works.'' Selling is an associate professor at Thunderbird, the American Graduate School of International Management in Glendale, Arizona.
     Bowsher's Public Oversight Board, a five-member body created in 1977 to monitor auditors' systems for catching audit flaws, voted yesterday for the second time to disband. The oversight board had announced on Jan. 22 that it would close to protest its exclusion from deliberations that led to a plan by SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt for creating a new body to oversee audit quality.

A 'Very Difficult Time'

     Some audit controls, such as using computers to spot financial conflicts of interest with prospective clients, improved during four years of SEC prodding, Bowsher said. Other shortcomings continue because of resistance in the accounting industry, he said.
     "We were pushing on some of these issues, but we were having a very difficult time having these things improved,'' Bowsher said in an interview.
     Peer reviews and accounting oversight are in the forefront of debate about audit regulations in the wake of Enron's collapse. The energy trader blamed bookkeeping errors, in financial statements certified by Andersen, for the need to restate earnings going back to 1997.
     Still, Andersen got unqualified good marks in its latest peer review, released Jan. 2. Andersen's reviewer, Deloitte & Touche LLP, looked at 240 audits after Andersen asked its rival for tougher-than-normal scrutiny while questions swirled about Enron. Enron's audit was not among those examined.

Pitt's Proposal

     Pitt's outline for change calls for the SEC to work with the biggest accounting firms to create a private oversight body, with funding from outside the accounting industry, to monitor and discipline auditors. Former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt, who appointed Turner, said last week that Pitt's proposal ``needs more teeth.''
     An April 1997 letter, the earliest released under the freedom of information request, questioned whether cost saving in the name of efficiency was hurting the quality of audits and producing fewer records than peer reviewers needed.
     "Some changes being undertaken in pursuit of operating goals, such as reducing audit hours and focusing audit objectives on increasing the perceived value of the audit to client management, may have the effect of compromising audit quality,'' wrote Michael Sutton, who was then SEC's chief accountant. He declined to comment on the letters.

Peer Review

     In a Dec. 9, 1999, letter, Turner cited apparent lapses in peer reviews of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and one of its predecessors, Coopers & Lybrand LLP. A peer review of Coopers & Lybrand stated the firm had "extensive, appropriate'' policies for preventing conflicts of interest, while several cases were found in which people at the firm weren't notified about new clients with which they may have a conflict, Turner said.
     Pricewaterhouse wasn't taken to task in a peer review of its standards, Turner said, though the accounting firm settled SEC charges that executives and the firm's pension fund compromised its independence by holding stock in more than 70 audit clients.
      "We strongly recommend that the POB undertake a special review'' of possible independence violations, Turner wrote to Bowsher. A month later, in January 2000, Pricewaterhouse released a consultant's report saying 8,064 independence violations were discovered at the firm.
     "We did a very extensive review and put new systems in place a couple of years ago'' to alert employees about stock holdings that present a conflict of interest, Pricewaterhouse spokesman David Nestor said. The Wall Street Journal Wednesday reported Turner's comments about Pricewaterhouse and Coopers.

'A Systematic Failure'

     The released letters show the SEC staff often was at odds with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants over the SEC's concern about conflicts of interest when auditing firms do consulting or other non-audit work for clients. The AICPA is the industry's professional group.
     Firms auditing public companies "may lack sufficient worldwide quality controls to assure their independence from audit clients,'' Turner wrote in the Dec. 9, 1999, letter. "The SEC staff has identified additional, troubling examples that suggest not only a lack of sufficient global safeguards, but also a systematic failure by professionals within certain firms to adhere to even their own firm's existing controls.''
     Last year, Turner expressed disappointment that AICPA "failed to take any disciplinary actions'' in some cases where the SEC had found violations. In a Feb. 9, 2001, letter, Turner faulted the AICPA's disciplinary process for ``a lack of public accountability and reporting.''

'Mutual Back Scratching'

     The SEC chief accountant said there was a perception within the industry that ``partners in large accounting firms are treated more leniently in the disciplinary process'' than other accountants.
     A March 20, 2001, letter expressed concern that the peer review process is little more than "mutual back scratching.''
     In another letter, dated April 9, 2001, Turner said, "during the past three years, an alarming number of deficiencies and in some cases outright lack of quality controls within the accounting profession with respect to auditor's independence have been brought to the attention of the staff.''
     The SEC letters span the 2000 debate over an SEC proposal to bar accounting firms from many kinds of consulting for audit clients. During the debate, accountants marshaled congressional allies to their side to beat back some of the tougher provisions. Levitt and big accounting firms reached a compromise, easing the proposed restrictions while requiring public disclosure of auditors' fees.

SEC Audit Discipline Study

     Representative John LaFalce of New York, ranking Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, has asked Pitt to provide SEC correspondence with the oversight board or the AICPA. LaFalce's request came after the Wall Street Journal reported that the SEC staff, under Turner, began a report on weaknesses in accounting self-regulation.
     Preparation of the report, which Turner said would have pointed in a different direction than Pitt's regulatory plan, stopped when Turner left the agency in August, SEC spokeswoman Christi Harlan said.
     The study of accounting shortcomings was a ``personal project'' of Turner and ``didn't get finished'' before he left the SEC last August, Harlan said. Because the project was ``already dead before (Pitt) came in the door,'' Harlan said there "was no reason to bring this to his attention.''
     Turner now is head of the Center for Quality Financial Reporting at Colorado State University and a consultant for Bloomberg News. Levitt is a director of Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News.

Enron Partnership Investors Sue to Force Out Former Executive
2002-02-01 14:30 (New York)

     Wilmington, Delaware, Feb. 1 (Bloomberg) -- Investors who put at least $300 million into an Enron Corp. partnership used to cordon off debt from its books are battling in court to bar a former Enron executive from running the venture.
     Eleven investors in LJM2 Co-Investment LP, including Citigroup Inc. and The Travelers Indemnity Co., have sued in Delaware Chancery Court in Wilmington to remove Michael Kopper as general partner. Kopper, former head of Enron's North American division, took over in July as the partnership's head from former Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow.
     The LJM2 partnership is a target of a dozen government investigations into the collapse of Enron, which filed the largest Chapter 11 bankruptcy in December. Enron's disclosure in November that Fastow made $30 million managing two off-book partnerships, including LJM2, hastened Enron's collapse.
     Control of more than $300 million may be at stake in the suit to remove Kopper. The court papers don't say, and lawyers on both sides declined to comment. Investors could be left with nothing if the partnership's assets are pulled into Enron's bankruptcy case, lawyers said.
     "Creditors are likely to make a move on anything left in this partnership in which Enron has an interest,'' said Chuck Tatelbaum, a Naples, Florida, attorney representing two Enron companies with claims against Enron in the bankruptcy case.
     Fastow set up dozens of private partnerships to buy and sell Enron assets. Kopper worked with Fastow at Enron to help market some of the partnerships to investors and left the company to run LJM2, according to company filings and court records.

Partnership Assets

     Fastow formed LJM2 in 1999, and the partnership acquired energy and telecommunications assets from Enron, including an 18,000-mile fiber-optic network it bought in June 2000 in a transaction that resulted in a $67 million profit for Enron.
     LJM2 sold the network six months later for a $53 million profit, according to documents Enron filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
     "Mr. Fastow and Mr. Kopper are the architects of controversies that led to'' Enron's bankruptcy, Michael Goldman, a Wilmington lawyer representing the suing LJM2 limited partners, said at a Jan. 10 hearing in the case.
     "Mr. Kopper has interests that are in conflict with both the partnership and the limited partners,'' Goldman told Chancery Court Judge Jack B. Jacobs in seeking to bar Kopper from controlling the partnership while the case is litigated.

Feb. 25 Trial

     Jacobs ordered Kopper on Jan. 15 to hand over the partnership's reins to turnaround specialist Jay Alix & Associates and make all "books, papers and records'' available to the firm pending a trial due to begin Feb. 25.
     Kopper and his lawyers didn't return calls seeking comment on the suit.
     In court papers, Kopper said the investors who are trying to remove him violated the partnership agreement.
     He said investors like Citigroup Inc.'s Citicorp and The Travelers Indemnity Co., which agreed to invest $10 million and $3.1 million in LJM2 respectively, missed a Jan. 4 deadline for providing funds owed the partnership. That included their share of a $70 million interest payment, he said. The loan is now in default, he added.
     The partnership agreement prevents them from banding together to force out the general partner because they defaulted on those payments, Kopper said.
     "We intend to continue serving as the general partner of the partnership with the goal, as always, of maximizing asset value for the partners,'' Kopper said in a Jan. 7 letter to the partners. A copy was included in the court file.

Partnership Agreement

     Lawyers for the partners suing Kopper said in court papers that they've complied with the partnership agreement's requirements for ousting the general partner. Limited partners with a combined investment of more than 66 percent of the partnership voted to remove Kopper, the lawyers said.
     "Kopper has refused to acknowledge his removal and has taken numerous acts to jeopardize the partnership and the limited partners,'' Goldman said at the Jan. 10 hearing before Jacobs, according to a transcript.
     For example, Kopper is trying to direct defense lawyers representing LJM2 in a dozen suits in Texas state court over deals involving the partnership, Enron and other Enron-related units, Joseph McLaughlin, a New York-based lawyer representing limited partners, noted in court papers.
     "Plaintiffs believe that immediate removal of Michael Kopper is needed to ensure that the partnership and its limited partners receive adequate and conflict-free representation'' in the suits, McLaughlin said in the filing.

Raiding Allegation

     Kopper also raided the partnership's accounts after learning of the bid to remove him, partners allege in court papers.
     The day before limited partners voted to force him out, Kopper transferred $4 million from the partnership to pay half his annual management fee though he was only owed about $70,000, the partners alleged. He also took improper steps to disqualify the partners, they said.
     "The limited partners, including some of the largest financial institutions in this country, want to stop the bleeding and the threats of Mr. Kopper,'' Goldman told Jacobs.
     Among other investors who agreed to invest in LMJ2 are the American Home Assurance Co., $22.7 million; the Arkansas Teachers Retirement System, $30 million; AIG Private Equity Portfolio, $7.2 million; the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, $15 million; CIBC Capital Corp., $15 million; Merrill Lynch LP Holdings Inc., $16.6 million, and RHO Fund Investors II LLC, $15 million, according to court filings.
     Merrill Lynch is a passive, minority investor in Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News.

Happiness is a hot Enron hearing: Capitol competition

A vicious rash of "Enron envy" has spread across Washington, D.C., with no fewer than 11 separate congressional committees competing for the chance to interrogate witnesses to the biggest corporate scandal in American history. 
Publicity-seeking politicians and their minions are battling for the spotlight; everyone wants a whack at Ken Lay. The former Enron Corp. chief is scheduled to appear before the Senate commerce committee on Monday.
"This is the best committee," crowed Nu Wexler, press secretary to Ernest Hollings, chairman of the commerce committee. "I'd say that, of all the hearings, this is the big one. We've got Lay. It's his first committee [appearance], and the only one, as far as I know. It will definitely get lots of attention. Every committee wants press." 
Enron is the hottest story in town. Once the largest energy trader in North America, the company declared bankruptcy on Dec. 2, after a series of accounting irregularities came to light. Investigators are also looking into Enron's practice of shifting millions of dollars in debt into partnerships held by its executives, allowing the company to overstate its financial health. 
Some congressional workers in Washington have claimed victory for merely scheduling Enron committee inquiries ahead of their colleagues. 
A brief exchange published in the latest edition of The New Republic magazine reveals how nasty the competition has become. A spokesman for Jeff Bingaman, a New Mexico Senator, bragged that a committee chaired by his boss was "the first to announce we were having [an Enron-related] hearing, back on Nov. 29." 
This was bitterly contested by the press secretary to Bryon Dorgan, a Senator from North Dakota and chairman of the congressional subcommittee on consumer affairs. "Dorgan held the first hearing" on Dec. 18, his spokesman told the magazine. 
That is also incorrect. In fact, the first hearing related to the Enron bankruptcy took place on Dec. 12, under the auspices of the House financial services committee. 
Not only did it get a head start on the others, that committee boasted the most important witness to date: Joseph Berardino, chief executive of Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm that approved Enron's fallacious financial reports. 
Though he tried to deflect blame away from Andersen for the Enron disaster, Mr. Berardino admitted to "a crisis of confidence in my profession ... The accounting profession will have to reform itself." 
Then Congress broke for Christmas; since the holiday, Enron has become an even bigger story, with a suicide and allegations of favouritism levelled at the Bush administration. Everyone seems to have forgotten Mr. Berardino's provocative remarks. 
One congressional committee generating heavy interest has not even released a witness list or scheduled its Enron hearing. Yet the permanent subcommittee on investigations is on every Washington reporter's "must attend" list. Why? It has the power to subpoena Enron documents. It is also notorious for tackling juicy topics. This, after all, was the forum used by the late Senator Joseph McCarthy to conduct his anti-communist crusade. 
Then there are the also-rans, such as the Senate banking, housing and urban affairs committee. A complete stranger to controversy, this committee plods into the Enron fray in mid-February. "We will not be rushed," the committee's press secretary, Jesse Jacobs, said. "If there's any Enron envy out there, we don't feel it. We're in last place. Our senators are not after the limelight." 
No kidding. Mr. Jacobs says no Enron witnesses are scheduled to appear before the committee. Instead, members will take a "sober and historical" look at regulatory and investor protection issues. Bor-ing.

Enron chairman gave list of favored names to White House; Bush named two as energy regulators
By MARCY GORDON
AP Business Writer

02/01/2002
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

WASHINGTON (AP) - A few months after the White House got a list of recommended candidates from former Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay, a friend and backer of President Bush, two of them were appointed to a federal energy commission. 
Lay gave the list of names to Clay Johnson, Bush's personnel director, White House spokeswoman Anne Womack said Thursday. Among the eight or so names were Pat Wood, now chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and Nora Brownell, a member of the commission.
"It was one of many, many recommendations that he (Johnson) received" from industry executives, members of Congress and state officials, Womack said in an interview. 
Disclosure of Lay's recommendations to the White House last spring comes as congressional panels investigate the relationship between Houston-based Enron Corp., which filed for bankruptcy Dec. 2, and the Bush administration. 
The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating Enron's complex accounting and what role its auditor, Arthur Andersen, played in the Houston-based company's collapse. Andersen has acknowledged destroying Enron-related documents. 
A senator leading an investigation said Thursday that Enron had not cooperated in providing important information on the complex web of partnerships used by the company to conceal massive debts. The company's attorney said it doesn't have the documents sought. 
As head of a major campaign donor, Enron, wielding significant influence in Washington, Lay enjoyed access to top government officials of both parties. The White House has acknowledged that Lay met once privately last year with Vice President Dick Cheney, who headed a task force that formulated the administration's national energy policy. 
Lay disclosed the existence of the list of Enron favorites in an interview being broadcast Friday on PBS' "NOW with Bill Moyers." 
"I brought a list, we certainly presented a list. ... As I recall, I signed a letter which in fact had some recommendations as to people that we thought would be good (FERC) commissioners," Lay said in the interview, which was taped in May but never aired. 
Bush, as Texas governor, had appointed Wood in 1995 as head of the state's Public Utilities Commission. Wood has been an advocate of market-oriented regulation of utilities, a position espoused by Enron, a big, aggressive energy trader that had become a favorite of Wall Street. 
Bush appointed Wood as FERC chairman in August, replacing Curt Hebert. 
Hebert said in the PBS interview that Lay "has asked me to take certain positions but I've had those conversations with Ken Lay for a long time. And have disagreed with him for a long time." 
Brownell, a member of Pennsylvania's Public Utility Commission, was nominated by Bush in March. During her time on the state commission, Brownell helped oversee Pennsylvania's electricity deregulation. 
Lay will be the star witness next week as a blizzard of hearings by several congressional panels put the Enron collapse under intense public scrutiny. 
Enron officials "just simply have not cooperated" in providing the documents sought, said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., chairman of a Senate Commerce subcommittee. "We again renew our request." 
An estimated 3,000 partnerships, some with names of "Star Wars" characters such as Jedi, were created by Enron, which took a 97 percent stake in each of them and brought in outside investors for the remainder. The partnerships were kept off Enron's books and helped create the accounting debacle that pushed the company into the biggest U.S. corporate bankruptcy filing ever. 
Dorgan said the committee had no immediate plan to subpoena the documents from the company. 
Robert Bennett, a Washington attorney representing Enron, said, "We have been fully cooperating with them." 
Bennett said the committee has asked Enron for documents that the company doesn't have and must be obtained from the partnerships or people representing them. 
"We are exercising enormous good faith in cooperating with that committee," the attorney said in a telephone interview. 
In a related dispute between Congress and the Bush administration, investigators at the General Accounting Office told the White House on Wednesday they would sue to make officials identify the industry executives, including some from Enron, who met last year with Cheney's energy task force.

Enron Executives Using Company Jets to Attend Bankruptcy Hearings

02/01/2002
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Associated Press 
HOUSTON -- Since Enron Corp. filed the largest bankruptcy in history last year, the company has used its two jets for eight round-trip flights to New York where the case was filed, a spokesman said Thursday.
Seven of those flights carried a total of 43 passengers to bankruptcy hearings before U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Arthur Gonzalez in New York, spokesman Mark Palmer said Thursday. 
The eighth flight this week transported family members of former Enron executive J. Clifford Baxter to his funeral on Wednesday in his hometown of Amityville, N.Y. 
Mr. Baxter, 43 years old, was found dead in his car in an affluent Houston suburb early Jan. 25. Police determined that he shot himself in the head with a .38-caliber revolver found beside him. 
"We have had in the past two months a total of eight round-trip flights," and the one for Mr. Baxter's family was for personal reasons, Mr. Palmer said. 
Some friends of the Baxter family joined that flight, including one Enron employee who was close to the family, Mr. Palmer said. 
Mr. Baxter resigned as Enron's vice chairman in May last year after working for the company for a decade. He was named in an August letter written by another executive, Sherron Watkins, as complaining to former chief executive Jeff Skilling about accounting practices that helped fuel the fallen energy giant's collapse last year. 
Mr. Palmer said before Enron (ENRNQ) filed bankruptcy Dec. 2, the company owned two jets and leased three. After the filing, the leases were canceled. 
Of the remaining two jets, "both are for sale and have been for sale. They haven't sold because the market for airplanes is terrible," Mr. Palmer said. 
Deborah DeFforge, laid off from Enron Dec. 3 after working for the company for five years, said the continued use of jets is hard to swallow when former workers are living on unemployment benefits and trying to find jobs in a tight economy. 
"I think just using the plane is obscene, but for that family it's not obscene," she said. "My heart goes out to that family."

Agent: Lays close to selling Aspen lot

ASPEN, Colo. (AP) - An undeveloped lot owned by former Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay that has been listed for $2.95 million could be sold in the next few weeks, said a real estate agent. 
But the asking prices of two homes owned by Lay and his wife, Linda, have been reduced, said Joshua Saslove, the broker handling the transactions.
The sale of a fourth Aspen property, a cottage, is being negotiated privately, said Saslove, who wouldn't discuss any of the asking prices. 
Linda Lay said in an interview Monday on NBC's "Today" that she and her husband are struggling to avoid personal bankruptcy and are selling nearly everything they own. 
Lay, former chairman and chief executive officer of Enron, will appear before Congress next week to answer questions about the collapse of the energy giant, which is embroiled in the nation's largest ever bankruptcy. 
The Pitkin County assessor's office listed the taxable value of the Lays' three-bedroom Aspen cottage at about $4 million. 
The couple's other two homes in the glitzy resort were initially listed at $6.5 million each, but Saslove said the prices have been reduced. One is now advertised for $6.125 million, and the other for $6.15 million. 
Saslove said the price reductions reflect market conditions. "They (the Lays) just want to be marketing their properties realistically," he said. 
Lawyers suing Lay and other Enron executives claim he sold 1.8 million shares of Enron stock for $101 million from October 1998 to November 2001, though it's not clear how many of those sales were required under stock option rules. 
Thousands of employees with the Houston-based energy conglomerate lost their jobs, and a class-action lawsuit was recently filed by workers claiming Enron is liable for billions of dollars in losses from employee 401k accounts. 
Enron's downfall also has come under scrutiny in the political arena, because the company has had ties to President Bush and was one of his biggest corporate supporters.

First-of-the-month bills leave ex-Enron employees in crunch
By LISA FALKENBERG
Associated Press Writer

HOUSTON (AP) - Credit card in hand, a laid-off Enron Corp. employee went to the supermarket last month to buy all the Lean Cuisine meals he could stuff in his freezer. 
David Hunker allows himself to eat two a day, and that's it. The 27-year-old former associate analyst said Friday he hasn't bought food since.
"It's getting tougher," said Hunker, one of 4,500 Houston employees laid off in November after the energy giant's financial implosion. "I'm going to try to figure out a way to pay this month's rent, but after that, I don't know that I'll be able to pay anything else." 
For many laid-off Enron employees, the first-of-the-month bill collectors' harvest was even harder to face this week than it was last month. The bills are due, the money is running out. 
"Most of the people I know still have not found other jobs," Hunker said. "The one payment that we got from Enron pretty much runs out right about now." 
Rebekah Rushing, a former Enron employee who set up the Enron Ex-Employee Relief Fund, said requests for money grow even more desperate around the first of the month. 
"I've been getting more calls," Rushing said. "I'm hearing people who are crying on the phone for the money." 
Rushing said her fund has taken in about $160,000. She has handed out $100,000 so far to 80 people who have asked for her assistance in paying their mortgages, utility and food bills. Rushing, who found a job at another Houston energy firm, said she plans to give out at least 50 more checks next Thursday. 
She's received 400 requests for assistance. 
"It's really heartbreaking for me," she said. "I'm trying to help as many people as possible." 
Meanwhile, Hunker is perpetually pushing the resume, working the cell phone, exhausting his Rolodex of people who might know about an open job. But since November, there has been nothing, so he sits in his $1000-a-month, one-bedroom apartment in downtown Houston, trying to dig his way out of a financial hole that just gets deeper. 
His apartment complex has offered to restructure leases, but it won't reduce rent. He's considered moving out, but the lease termination fee is almost as much as rent and he hasn't gotten an unemployment check because he moved from a different state just two months before he lost his job. 
There are options, but they're not desirable for the 27-year-old who thought Enron was the key to a successful career. 
"We've talked about all trying to move in together," Hunker said of his former colleagues. "Trying to fit another person in my one bedroom apartment may be kind of tough, but it may be what we have to do." 
Sylvia Brooks, president of the Houston Area Urban League, which is helping ex-Enron employees find jobs, deal with bill collectors, and in some cases just vent about their situation, says some, but not any, mortgage companies have agreed to extend payment deadlines for ex-Enron employees. 
"It's done every day. We work out deals," she said. "The companies are flexible. They're responding to layoffs. We've experienced this before so many of the companies know how to respond." 
But even understanding companies won't wait longer than two months, Brooks said. 
"The bottom line is that they're businesses and they're looking for their payment," she said. 
Houston utility Reliant Energy, Inc. doesn't have a special plan to help displaced Enron employees pay their utility bills, said spokesman Richard Wheatly. 
"We do have normal policies and procedures that can be looked at on a case-by-case basis, as we do with all customers," Wheatly said.

Enron's Cooper Keeps The Faith On Firm's Reorganization
2002-02-01 16:00 (New York)

   By Christina Cheddar and Kathy Chu 
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 
  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--In his first public appearance as Enron Corp.'s new chief executive, Stephen Cooper spoke in the firm tones that lived up to his reputation as a no-nonsense kind of guy. 
  "I do not see this as a liquidation," he said, adding that his view historically has been that creditors receive more cents on dollar when a company reorganizes than when it liquidates. 
  "Regardless of how effectively you run that liquidation  ... there is a patina of distress," Cooper said. "People will attempt to put you over a barrel." 
  By Cooper's account, Enron will emerge as a smaller company, one without the powerful energy trading operation that became its identity. But a survivor, nonetheless. 
  His task now is to move in and organize. 
  But while Cooper is keeping the faith that Enron will be able to reorganize, creditors appear to be losing their confidence. They wish him well, but believe that he'll have to overcome significant odds to get Enron back on its feet. 
  "I've got the highest regard for Steve Cooper, you can't really be a bankruptcy professional and not know him or know of his reputation," said Scott Baena, an attorney at Bilzin Sumberg Dunn Baena Price & Axelrod LLP in Miami. 
  Baena, whose firm represents a group of former Enron employees, said he believes Cooper is intent on reorganizing  - even though it's too soon to know if this is possible. 
  "For Steve Cooper, reorganization is an aspirational goal, but we don't always get what we want," Baena said. 
  Cooper has more than 30 years' experience in leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.  He will be joined in his efforts by professionals from the restructuring consultancy, Zolfo Cooper LLC, that he helped create. 
  That experience carries clout, and that could make a difference in the case. 
  "I think his appointment makes it less likely that a trustee will be appointed," said Richard Tilton, a New York  bankruptcy lawyer. 
  Judge Arthur Gonzalez, who is presiding over Enron's bankruptcy, is likely to deem the appointment of an independent trustee - to take over Enron's daily operations - as excessively disruptive to already complex court proceedings, according to Tilton. It's more likely, he said, that the judge will name an examiner to probe certain aspects of fraud or misdeed in the case. 
  To be sure, Enron's bankruptcy, the largest in U.S. history, will likely remain prominent in the public eye as long as Congress continues its numerous investigations. Turnarounds are always sensitive matters, but it is rare for  the reorganizational efforts to be this public. 
  Cooper's experience may help him make the quick decisions that will be needed to tackle the job. 
  But creditors will be looking for results fast, according to Charlie Rhoads, a partner at the Houston office of Boyden Global Executive Search. 
  "There is no honeymoon period because an interim CEO really falls under the role of a consultant," he said, explaining that there is less patience for results from an individual with this type of experience. 
  On Wednesday, Cooper gave a rough outline of his plan, and in it the new Enron looked very much like old pipeline company that gave birth to the original Enron. The company would retain its gas pipelines, and would assess whether to preserve or sell the rest. The businesses that might be sold include money-losing power plants in India and Brazil, Enron's broadband assets, and the water and wastewater business that were once part of Azurix Corp. 
  One way to do this would be to combine the assets and the liabilities of all Enron subsidiaries. This move, called a substantive consolidation, would put some creditors at a disadvantage and result in them getting paid less for their claims. 
  With this in mind, some creditors have petitioned the court to segregate the cash flowing into one of Enron's units because they claim the parent company can't be trusted  to keep accurate records and divvy up the funds among the business units. The creditors want detailed accounts of the cash flows into Enron units. 
  Given Enron's legal structure, Cooper believes it is "highly probable" that not all creditors will be treated equally. In other words, in the end, there just might not be  enough to pay off all creditors after the web of off-balance-sheet partnerships are untangled.

POWER POINTS: Enron On The Potomac - Anything Goes!
By Mark Golden

02/01/2002
Dow Jones Energy Service

A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)-It's still too early for cherry blossoms in Washington, D.C., but at congressional hearings on Enron the silly season is in full bloom.
In particular, any attempt to tie Enron and the California energy crisis of a year ago into a unifying theory on the evils of deregulation grabs big headlines. So what if there isn't an important connection? Never let the facts stand in the way of a good story, especially with so much money on the line and an election to win. 
At Senate Energy Committee hearings Tuesday, an energy consultant from the Northwest, Robert McCullough, made a reasonable pitch for more transparency in energy markets and for enforced disclosure of all corporations' off-balance sheet subsidiaries. 
But McCullough, a registered Republican in favor of electricity deregulation, supplied the Democratic Party with a plum. Almost as a side note, McCullough said that forward prices for wholesale electricity in the Northwest fell 30% when Enron filed Chapter 11 on Dec. 2. "The clear implication is that Enron may have been using its market dominance to 'set' forward prices," he surmised. 
The rest of McCullough's testimony was shunted aside. Outraged Senators Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., Ron Wyden, D-Calif., and Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., demanded congressional hearings and a federal investigation into this new revelation: Nasty Enron had been manipulating the power market right up until the day it declared bankruptcy. It must have been the culprit behind the western electricity crisis a year ago! 
"Where there's smoke, there's fire," Cantwell said. 
Investigations were launched, and Wednesday's newspapers across the country ran with headlines like "Enron Witness Raises Specter of Price Fixing." 

Someone Tell The Traders 

Western energy traders, meanwhile, grunted a collective, "Huh?" The people in the market every day don't remember a price collapse like that at the time of Enron's bankruptcy filing. 
"What is he talking about?" asked one. 
If senators or their staff had bothered to look at the prices McCullough submitted with his testimony, they might have questioned his math. McCullough's data, taken from trade publisher Platt's, show power prices in Washington state for 2002 through 2004 falling from $37 a megawatt-hour before Enron's bankruptcy filing to $31/MWh 10 days later. 
That's a 16% drop, not a 30% drop. Platt's immediately disowned the 30% figure, as well as the consultant's explanation for the modest decline. 
In an interview Thursday, McCullough said his 30% figure came from confidential bids he obtained for clients, not from the Platt's prices he submitted. His bids fell from $40/MWh the week before Enron's filing to $30/MWh the week after. 
"The fundamental question is what happened that weekend (that Enron declared bankruptcy)," he said. "Will we know what happened more if it's 15% or 30%? I don't think so." 
The size of the move might not mean that much to McCullough, but this is an election year, and California Gov. Gray Davis is facing an uphill race for reelection because of his handling of the energy crisis. Though prices and blackout fears have long since receded, the state is stuck with some $50 billion in overpriced long-term contracts negotiated by his appointees. 
Democratic senators saw an opportunity to lay the blame for Davis' mismanagement on yet another scapegoat. First it was the merchant generators' fault, but then it turned out they charged much lower prices than California's municipal utilities. Then it was El Paso Corp. (EP), accused of withholding supply to drive up prices of natural gas. Now, it's Enron. The Democrats must deflect all blame from Davis in 2002's most important single race. 

What Really Happened 

So, why did northwest electricity prices fall even 16% at the time of Enron's bankruptcy? The price history submitted by McCullough backs up what traders have been saying for months: Enron had been seen shorting western power since last spring, making money as prices collapsed. 
That view was confirmed this week by the Bonneville Power Administration, the federal power marketer in the Northwest. A year ago, Enron was selling to Bonneville at an average price of $50/MWh. Later, Enron bought the power back at about $18, according to Bonneville. 
In October, as Enron's credit quality and survival were being severely questioned, the company ordered its traders to "flatten their books." For Enron's western traders, that meant getting out of their short positions by buying back power to reduce the risks in their portfolio. 
Prices rebounded for a few weeks on Enron's buying, but that stopped in early November after Enron became unable to do many more deals. The bear market for all U.S. energy markets - which has continued to this day - resumed for western power. 
Aside from the politics, we're talking big bucks. Several western utilities hold hundreds of millions of dollars in long-term contracts with Enron that are now way above the market. Those contracts didn't go away with Enron's bankruptcy filing. Just the opposite - they became major assets of the estate. If they hold up, the utilities will have to pay the entire difference between their contracts and the current market up front, in cash. 
If the utilities can prove Enron manipulated the market, they might be able to get federal energy regulators to invalidate the contracts. Even high-priced contracts signed with suppliers other than Enron - like Davis' - might be nullified based on Enron's market manipulation. 
As for Feinstein's rush to judge Enron as the culprit behind California's energy crisis, McCullough called that "a leap of faith." 
That crisis was in the spot market for power needed on a daily and hourly basis. As big as Enron was, it was never big enough to control the spot market for western electricity, which was enormous until California started buying everything under long-term contracts last summer. 
For all its questionable activities, Enron isn't to blame for California. The state botched deregulation under the leadership of the previous governor, Republican Pete Wilson. The Davis ignored the crisis for eight months, until after the state's two largest utilities were flat broke, and then largely botched the solution. 
End of story? Not a chance. McCullough is scheduled to testify Wednesday before a House committee on market power abuse.

Enron's fall darkens summit Leaders at global forum fear effects of giant's collapse

NEW YORK -- Forget the bomb squads roaming Park Avenue, the potential riots from anti-globalization protesters and the police armed with submachine guns guarding what some are calling "Davos on the Hudson." What's bothering the 3,000 businesses and political leaders brainstorming in the plush confines of the Waldorf-Astoria is the fallout from Enron Corp., the biggest bankruptcy filing in U.S. business history. 
Gathered in Manhattan for the World Economic Forum, this is a $25,000-(U.S.)-a-head salon for business and political titans to chew over the world's challenges. Many of the delegates are expressing fear, however, that revelations of late-night paper shredding in Houston and suspicious accounting practices are a serous blow to the stock markets they are relying on to end a near-global economic downturn.
"The Enron debacle creates a crisis within the entire capital market," said Samuel DiPiazza Jr., who yesterday was named the global CEO of PricewaterhouseCoopers. "Our profession is right in the middle of that." 
With many market watchers predicting that more companies will falter under billions of dollars in debt not properly cited on their books, Mr. DiPiazza said business leaders have realized that transparency in accounting is one of the major challenges facing Corporate America. 
"I absolutely believe it's on the minds of the CEOs walking these halls," he said. 
To deal with the public perception that accounting firms may have too incestuous a relationship with the clients they are supposed to be auditing, Mr. DiPiazza said PricewaterhouseCoopers believes it is crucial to separate its auditing arm from its lucrative consultancy work. 
"We believe the perception of conflict is something we must deal with," he said. "It will not make us better accountants. But if it helps change the public perception, we think it's positive." 
In a sense, the Enron scandal has gone global, the business leaders say. The world economy is relying on the U.S. economy to put an end to a recession felt around the globe, and if Enron is only the tip of the iceberg of similar bookkeeping tactics, it could slow down a Wall Street recovery. 
Gail Fosler, chief economist of the U.S. Conference Board, said the Enron implosion, following the collapse of stocks of companies such as Xerox Corp. and Lucent Technologies Inc., definitely has the world's investors wondering where the bad news will stop. 
"I wouldn't call it the Enron contagion, but it does undergird the sense of risk aversion that was already in play," she said, adding that the scandal has also hurt other companies seeking to take on debt to survive hard times. 
"I would even say Kmart was a victim of Enron," she said, adding that there was a broad tightening of credit when the energy giant entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. "This is in some way an impediment to global liquidity." 
For the first time in 31 years, the World Economic Forum is being held outside of Davos, a sleepy village in the Swiss Alps. It's an attempt by organizers to help New York recover from the Sept. 11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center and throw leaders a Big Apple party: Tonight they will get to hear Paul Simon, Bono and Peter Gabriel in the Grand Ballroom of the Waldorf-Astoria. 
But the cozy nature of the conference has been altered by the move to Manhattan. Security is at an all-time high, with thousands of police and secret service agents in the hallways of the hotel, which is off-limits to all but registered delegates. That makes the chances of buttonholing those in attendance, from the likes of Microsoft Corp.'s Bill Gates to an artist like Bono -- something that was possible in Davos -- next to impossible. 
A survey of 1,161 CEOs from around the world, however, many of whom are in the boardrooms of the Waldorf-Astoria, has found that the obliteration of the World Trade Center has deflated the buoyant mood that usually marked the Davos summits. 
"Nearly 60 per cent [of CEOs] focus on two probabilities," said the PricewaterhouseCoopers survey. 
"Continuing stagnation in the global economy and the vulnerability of global supply chains." 
The survey found that since the Sept. 11 attacks, about half of the world's corporate leaders have laid off workers, outsourced non-core businesses and imposed travel restrictions (although not necessarily their $300-and-up rooms at the Waldorf-Astoria). The survey found that the CEOs regarded these cutbacks as long term, although they believed that budgets for research and development would be restored. 
Perhaps most interesting, though, is that globalization protesters, who promise major demonstrations tomorrow, appear to be getting the attention of a large number of business leaders. 
One-third of the CEOs surveyed said they believe the "anti-globalization movement" is a threat to their business. Another third agreed that globalization is likely to increase the gap between rich and poor countries, precisely what the protesters will be chanting in the days ahead when they begin protests on the other side of the concrete barriers around the Waldorf-Astoria.

Accounting profession seeks to restore trust following Enron scandal
By SETH SUTEL
AP Business Writer

Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

NEW YORK (AP) - Stung by a collapse in public confidence following the Enron scandal, the accounting profession is taking steps to eliminate the appearance of conflicts of interest in the kinds of services they offer their audit clients. 
The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, a professional group, said Friday for the first time that it would support any future proposal to impose certain limits on services accounting firms may provide to the companies they audit.
The statement came a day after KPMG, one of the five major accounting firms, reversed its opposition to limits proposed two years ago, which would have prevented auditing firms from providing information technology consulting or internal audit services to the companies whose financial statements they audit. 
The two actions came on the heels of an announcement from the leading accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers, that it would spin off its consulting business into a separate entity. 
The plans, which had been in the works for many months, were accelerated because of concerns that the public perception of the accounting profession was hurting because of the Enron scandal. 
Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, acknowledged destroying documents and e-mails that were sought by federal and congressional investigators looking into questionable accounting practices which led to the swift collapse last fall of the energy trading giant. 
The non-audit consulting fees are often much more lucrative to the accounting firms than fees for auditing companies' books. For example, in 2001, The Walt Disney Co. paid PricewaterhouseCoopers $8.6 million for its auditing and $32 million for other services, according to its proxy statement. 
Critics contend the high fees could taint an auditor's objectivity when reviewing its client's books. 
On Thursday, Disney said it will not use its outside auditing firm for new consulting projects and will review those currently under way. 
Linda Dunbar, a spokeswoman for the AICPA, said that even though the group would support future limits on the bans that such restrictions were not the solution to the profession's problems and "would not prevent the next Enron." 
"Given where we are on public concerns on conflict of interest, it seems that some restrictions are necessary so that we can move on to more substantive issues," Dunbar said. 
Likewise, Stephen G. Butler, chairman of KPMG, called the controversy of service limits a "red herring" in a statement released Thursday, but he said the firm would now support the limits in order to move on to substantive reform of financial accounting practices. 
Spokesmen for PricewaterhouseCoopers and Ernst & Young, two of the other five major accounting firms, both said their firms supported the limits on information and internal auditing consulting when they were first proposed two years ago under Arthur Levitt, the former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and that their position hadn't changed. 
"When this was being debated two years ago we supported it then, and we support it now," Larry Parnell, a spokesman for Ernst & Young, said. 
"This is not a new position for us," Peter Horowitz, a spokesman for PricewaterhouseCoopers, said. "We supported those positions two years ago." 
A spokesman for Andersen didn't return a phone call seeking comment. The New York Times quoted an Andersen official as saying that his firm would make an announcement soon that would "substantially change the way Andersen does business." 
Deloitte & Touche released a statement Thursday calling the issue over the scope of services that accounting firms can offer "principally one of perception. But it is a huge perception problem." 
Nonetheless, the firm said "it is premature to accept or reject any proposal, whether we agree with it or not, because the effectiveness of a complete set of reforms is what ultimately needs to be assessed." 
Auditing firms can still provide certain non-auditing services to the firms they audit, subject to certain rules. 
But most accounting firms have already separated from their consulting divisions, including Andersen, whose consulting arm split off into a unit called Accenture. KPMG has spun off its consulting business, and In early 2000, Ernst & Young sold its consulting business to Cap Gemini SA, a French computer and management services company. 
Once PricewaterhouseCoopers' stock offering is complete, Deloitte will remain the only major accounting firm that is still united with its consulting arm.

Top Of The News 
Enron: A House Divided 

Dan Ackman, Forbes.com, 02.01.02, 9:26 AM ET 

"Divide and conquer" is often a winning strategy. Enron's wrinkle has long been "divide and disavow," and it seems that, for the bankrupt energy trader and its lawyers, old gambits die hard. 

One of the principal components of the Enron scandal was the company's practice of creating partnerships and then using them to push its assets or debts off its books. Technically this can be legal, so long as the partnerships are truly separate, which, among other things, means that outside investors control as little as 3% of the partnership equity. 

The myth of separation--while still strongly believed by Enron itself--is losing support among the accounting firms who have been tainted by Enron and other recent scandals. The Big Five accounting firms are coming around to the idea that providing certain consulting services to the same company it is auditing creates an inherent conflict and is bad business. 
Until recently, the accounting profession bitterly opposed any limits on its consulting services, beating back rule changes proposed by Arthur Levitt when he was chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. But the Enron taint has spread past Enron's own auditor, Arthur Andersen, and the firms are seeking to police themselves lest others--such as the SEC--do it for them. 

PricewaterhouseCoopers and KPMG said yesterday said they would support such proposals. Andersen itself is said to be leaning in that direction and that it will soon announce substantial changes in how it does business. 

The Walt Disney Co. approved of the new regime of separation yesterday when its chairman, Michael Eisner, said the company would not use its independent auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers, for any new consulting work and would evaluate the current projects the accounting firm's consultants are currently doing for the company. 

Disney in 2000 paid PricewaterhouseCoopers $8.7 million in audit fees and around $32 million in non-audit fees. PricewaterhouseCoopers, for its part, said it intended to spin off its consulting arm in an IPO, which could mollify Disney and others. 

Arthur Andersen, in 2000, separated from its old consulting arm, now known as Accenture, after a long-running dispute between the two sides of the firm. But since then, Andersen itself has beefed up its own consulting practice. According to a report in The New York Times, just over half the $52 million it billed Enron in 2000 was for consulting. 

Enron, of course, has fired its auditor--as if Andersen forced Enron's hand rather than the other way around--and it appears to be clinging to its old religion at least in the early innings of the Enron investigation. Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.), accused the company yesterday of failing to provide records for thousands of Enron-backed partnerships that were long known to--and approved by-- company directors. Dorgan is chairman of the Senate Commerce subcommittee on consumer affairs, one of nine congressional panels probing Enron. 

A lawyer for Enron, Robert Bennett, responded to reporters, "The senator is terribly misinformed. We have been totally cooperating with the committee." Bennett added, "The senator may be operating under the misimpression that we have possession of many of these special partnership entity documents, which we don't." The documents would have to be obtained from the partnerships themselves. Instead of one subpoena, Bennett wants Dorgan to issue 3,000. In the unique dialect native to planet Enron, this stance is called cooperation. 

Dorgan, obviously acting without the benefit of a translator, was confused."Virtually all of these partnerships would be 97% Enron and 3% someone else," he said. "You'd certainly expect...you would have all of the records at your fingertips as a corporation." But not having the records, the right hand not knowing what the left hand was doing, was increasingly how Enron did business. 

The Enron board, as Dorgan pointed out, had to approve the creation of the partnerships. The chairman of that board, Kenneth Lay, is scheduled to testify before a congressional committee on Feb. 4. Bennett told reporters Lay will appear before the committee: "He's not going to plead the Fifth...Mr. Lay feels he has nothing to hide and that he's done nothing wrong and he wants to tell his story." 

But Bennett represents Enron, not Lay personally. Lay's lawyer in Washington, D.C., is Earl Silbert. Silbert did not return phone calls seeking comment. But don't be surprised if, on Feb. 4, there is another division in the Enron ranks.

Golden State politicians are on the warpath after a leaked memo reveals Kenneth Lay's instructions on how the White House should handle last year's electricity crisis.

By Anthony York, Salon.com
Feb. 1, 2002 | The release of a memo from then-Enron CEO Kenneth Lay to Vice President Dick Cheney that included recommendations for how to handle the California energy crisis is encouraging the state's top politicians to call for more hearings and investigations into Enron's role. On Thursday, Gov. Gray Davis and Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., called on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to investigate charges of possible market manipulation by Enron and other power generators in the state. 
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., has asked Energy and Natural Resources chairman Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., to schedule hearings on Enron's role in creating California's broken energy marketplace. 
"I am writing to request an additional hearing to pursue what role Enron had in the California energy crisis with respect to market manipulation and price gouging," Feinstein wrote in her letter to Bingaman. "Enron's ability to deal in complex unregulated financial derivatives in the natural gas market while controlling a tremendous share of the gas trading market, provided Enron the ability to manipulate market prices." 
Critics say Enron was a big part of why the California energy marketplace was fundamentally flawed in the first place. Enron argued for a separate clearinghouse for all energy trades in the state, which had little regulatory scrutiny and operated in virtual secrecy. That, consumer advocates say, helped energy producers and traders like Enron to artificially manipulate the market and gouge the utilities, who were buying the wholesale energy to deliver to their retail customers. 
Bill Wicker, spokesman for the Energy Committee, says the chairman has not yet set a date for those hearings, but the interest of Feinstein, as well as Democrats Maria Cantwell, of Washington, and Ron Wyden, of Oregon, in holding such hearings is a good sign they will be held soon. 
The Lay memo, a copy of which was leaked to the San Francisco Chronicle, refocused attention on Enron's role in the California energy crisis. Lay gave Cheney the two-page document in April, as the two met to discuss California's situation and the formation of a new national energy policy. The memo outlines Enron's priorities for a national energy plan, and includes suggestions for how to solve the state's energy problems. Critics say it illustrates just how closely the administration's final plan mirrors Enron's priorities. Sen. Barbara Boxer called the memo "a smoking gun." 
Eight remedies for the energy problems in California are listed in the memo, which Lay gave to Cheney on April 17, including a recommendation to give private companies the power of eminent domain to seize private property to build new power plants or transmission lines. The memo also argues strenuously against implementing price caps on wholesale energy prices -- a key issue in the California energy crisis. Instead, Enron argued, the solution to the crisis should be more deregulation, not less. That closely mirrored Cheney's public comments the day after his meeting with Lay as politicians from both parties were calling for temporary caps. 
"Events in California and in other parts of the country demonstrated that the benefits of competition have yet to be realized and have not yet reached consumers," the memo states. "The administration should reject any attempt to re-regulate wholesale power markets by adopting price caps." 
On April 18, Cheney told the Los Angeles Times, "California is looked on by many folks as a classic example of the kinds of problems that arise when you do use price caps." 
While the memo does not shed a tremendous amount of new light on Lay and Enron's input -- Lay met with Cheney six times as the administration was crafting its energy plan -- it underscored once again how Enron had the administration's ear at a time when California was threatened with soaring energy prices and rolling blackouts. 
Lay, it appears, had better access than California's highest elected officials. 
"Throughout the crisis, I was not allowed a private interview with the president or vice president -- even though such a talk may have helped California," Sen. Dianne Feinstein wrote in a recent editorial in the Los Angeles Times. "Something is wrong when a senator representing 35 million Californians is not able to talk personally to the president or vice president in the midst of a crisis, but executives from a company that contributed millions of campaign dollars have complete access and significant influence." 
Boxer is expected to confront Lay with the memo when Lay testifies before the Senate Commerce Committee on Monday. 
Feinstein and Boxer have directed most of their outrage at the administration for refusing to hear the pleas of Democrats and Republicans from California who begged for price caps on the state's out-of-control wholesale energy prices. The administration refused, adopting the same position as Enron -- that "price caps, even if imposed on a temporary basis, will be detrimental to power markets and will discourage private investment," in the words of the Enron memo. 
Eventually, new Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman Pat Wood acquiesced and imposed limited price caps on wholesale energy prices in the Golden State. Those caps -- along with other factors, including increased energy conservation and a cooler than expected summer out West -- led to an easing of the state's energy crisis as wholesale energy prices fell. 
The rising political heat, combined with Vice President Cheney's continued refusal to cooperate with the General Accounting Office's request for his notes from those energy policy meetings, is encouraging consumer advocates to up the ante. Doug Heller, from the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, speculates that Cheney may be refusing to cooperate with the GAO because he's trying to cover up for his buddies at Enron, who Heller says artificially manipulated California's energy market. 
"It seems clear now that Enron needed the ability to gouge California to keep their company going," he says. "The big question now is, did Lay ever say to Cheney, 'We're in trouble, and we need to keep this thing going in California to pay off our debts'?" 
Cheney has repeatedly said that he and Lay never discussed Enron's financial troubles. But Heller says the vice president's intransigence calls that into question. "I think it's legitimate to ask just what Dick Cheney is hiding," he says.  

Democrats hope to use Enron 'to shape the entire political environment'
By DAVID ESPO

WASHINGTON (AP) - Seated in a circle, Democratic House leaders listening intently, former employees of Enron poured out the details of their layoffs, their depleted retirement savings, their bleak financial futures. 
"We need help right now," said Gwendolyn Gray, once a human resources assistant at the failed energy giant.
Congress may eventually provide some help. But the gathering this week in the Capitol, held before a clutch of television cameras, also underscored an effort by Democrats to gain election-year strength from the Enron debacle. 
"Enron has the potential to shape the entire political environment for 2002, impact other issues and reduce confidence in the Bush administration and Republicans," three prominent Democratic advisers wrote in a memo widely circulated in Congress this week. 
"The more people hear, the more corrosive it becomes," wrote James Carville, Stanley Greenberg and Bob Shrum. 
There's some risk to the strategy, since Democrats were counted among the top recipients of Enron-related campaign donations. 
And for their part, Republicans are taking steps to minimize any damage. 
President Bush has made a series of comments critical of Enron, whose former chairman, Kenneth Lay, was a longtime campaign supporter. 
"Corporate America must be made accountable to employees and shareholders and held to the highest standards of conduct," the president said in Tuesday night's State of the Union address. 
But even before the strategy memo surfaced, senior Democrats had begun making frequent mention of the bankrupt energy company, in ways designed to raise doubts about the Bush administration and GOP. 
"I think we are slowly Enronizing the economy, Enronizing the budget," Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle recently told reporters, linking last year's White House-backed tax cuts to the imminent reappearance of federal budget deficits. 
"We are taking the same approach Enron used in sapping retirement funds and providing them to those at the very top." 
House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri mentioned Enron explicitly in the Democratic response to the State of the Union address. 
"If the nation's largest bankruptcy coupled with a clear example of paid political influence isn't a prime case for reform, I don't know what is," Gephardt said. "The forces aligned against this are powerful," he said. 
Most Democrats support legislation to reduce the role of money in politics. GOP leaders oppose it, and Democrats have long labored to depict Republicans as beholden to special interests. 
The polling on Enron is somewhat murky. But murky isn't all that bad for the Democrats, given that Bush's approval ratings are in the 80 percent range, and that the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks have elevated public concern about defense issues, which tend to favor Republicans. 
Polling also shows that Republicans gained a boost in hypothetical election matchups for Congress in the wake of last fall's terrorist attacks. 
But Democrats seized on a recent New York Times survey suggesting that the public sees Republicans as being more closely linked to Enron than the Democrats, 45 percent to 10 percent. 
Democrats have been heartened, as well, by the decision by the General Accounting Office, the congressional watchdog agency led by a Republican, to sue for records of Vice President Dick Cheney's energy task force. 
"I applaud GAO for standing up for the principles of the right of Congress and the people to know who helped shape the administration's energy policy," said Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., who helped initiate the GAO investigation last April. 
Alongside the inquiry into the task force, a dozen congressional committees are investigating Enron. The party's ability to gain political ground, said one House Democratic leadership aide speaking on condition of anonymity, "is a question of how aggressive the Senate people are who have subpoenas." 
Thus far, Republicans profess little concern. 
"It's an issue that has to be directly addressed. The American people expect it," said Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., chairman of the Senate GOP campaign committee. 
But with Bush scoring well in the polls, one Republican strategist said the GOP need merely "be properly outraged where outrage is warranted." Democrats may hurt themselves if they place too much stress on Enron and its ties to the Republicans, this official said - much like Republicans paid a price at the polls in 1998 when they sought to make the impeachment of President Clinton a campaign centerpiece. 
Yet in their memo, Carville, Greenberg and Shrum suggested how Democrats could use the Enron collapse politically. 
Referring to the first of two economic stimulus bills that Republicans pushed through the House last year, they wrote: 
"It is easy to imagine a chain of argument: an economic stimulus bill that became a corporate giveaway, including hundreds of millions more for Enron, which dodged taxes in 4 of the last 5 years."

CBOT CEO: Enron Fall May Pull Trade To Formal Exchanges
By Jon Kamp

02/01/2002
Dow Jones Energy Service

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)- The fall of Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) highlights the vulnerability of over-the-counter energy markets and could help push trade in those commodities to regulated exchanges, said David Vitale, president and chief executive of the Chicago Board of Trade.
Over-the-counter energy markets have clear benefits, including increased flexibility and lower costs to participate, Vitale said, speaking late Thursday at a Chicago conference. But Enron's rapid decline and withdrawal from those markets, which it once dominated, exposed the over-the-counter markets' significant risks, he said. 
"Enron clearly brings proof...that those risks are real," Vitale said. "The OTC market is clearly a buyer-beware market." 
Natural gas contracts, like oil contracts, are already traded heavily on the New York Mercantile Exchange in addition to over-the-counter markets. But electricity contracts change hands almost exclusively in over-the-counter markets that handled, by one estimate, nearly $450 billion in trade in 2001. 
In an interview following the conference, Vitale said he expects more exchange-traded energy contracts to emerge following Enron's fall. Though the CBOT has no specific plans to roll out such products, it's something the exchange will explore, he said. 
"It's on the agenda to look at," he said. 
Energy traders generally managed to unwind their Enron contracts with minimal disruption, but Enron's troubles show there can be tremendous risk-management costs for over-the-counter market participants, Vitale said. 
With those over-the-counter market costs and risks now apparent, regulated markets, which can offer standard contracts, more liquidity and the safety net of clearing functions, appear more favorable, he said. 
"The expected costs of participating in the OTC markets will rise," Vitale said. "There will be a flight to quality." 
Any attempt to shift electricity trading to regulated markets faces significant challenges. Transmission constraints that limit the ability to move power to where it is needed most make electricity a regional product, traded in a wide array of contracts centered on major transmission "hubs" around the U.S. It would be hard to create a standard contract for that system, Vitale said. 
Nymex launched electricity futures five years ago, but they are almost never traded. 
Exchanges and energy companies are pursuing other routes, however, that could bring the risk-mitigation benefits of a regulated exchange to over-the-counter electricity markets. Nymex, for example, began offering clearing services to over-the-counter natural gas markets last November and wants to offer clearing to power traders in 2002. 
IntercontinentalExchange, a major Internet-based marketplace backed by several large energy-trading firms and banks, also said recently that it may expand its clearing function to cover electricity. 
Exchange clearinghouses protect against default - a major concern when Enron collapsed - by stepping in as counterparty to every trade. Several large energy companies, including Williams Cos. (WMB) and Mirant Corp. (MIR), have expressed interest in the idea. 
Not all market watchers and participants agree that Enron's problems exposed energy marketplace flaws. In a mid-January address to the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Pat Wood, chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said Enron actually highlighted the strengths of the energy markets. 
While Enron created a headache for counterparties, those companies still managed to quickly eject Enron from the markets in what Wood called a show of "hateful Darwinism." 
That process "reaffirmed my personal faith that energy markets really worked as we want them to do, which is to reward good guys and punish bad guys," Wood said at the time.

INDIA: Bids come in for Enron Dabhol Indian power stake.
By Anirban Nag

02/01/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

BOMBAY, Feb 1 (Reuters) - The Industrial Development Bank of India said on Friday it has received three bids for the stake held by foreign shareholders in Enron Corp's $2.9 billion Dabhol power project and the number could rise to six. 
"The fourth bidder is likely to submit its bid and sign a confidentiality agreement by this evening," P P Vora, chairman and managing director of the development bank, which is the lead creditor to the project, told reporters.
"There are six bidders in the race and two of them have shown interest orally. All three firms which have submitted bids have signed the confidentiality agreement." 
He declined to name the firms, but six major companies - three foreign and three Indian - have said they are interested in bidding for the massive Dabhol plant and an adjoining LNG facility. 
The potential foreign bidders are Royal Dutch/Shell , European oil major TotalFinaElf and French utility Gaz de France . 
The possible Indian bidders are private power utilities BSES Ltd and Tata Power Company and the country's largest natural gas distributor, the Gas Authority of India Ltd . 
Vora said IDBI would appoint a financial firm next week to advise it on the bidding process. 
On Wednesday, the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) kicked off the process by inviting bids for the 85 percent foreign stake in Dabhol and fixed February 7 as the last date when potential buyers could file their expressions of interest. 
Vora said the due diligence by the bidders would start in London on February 5 or 6. 
"Our aim is to finish the entire bidding and due-diligence process in the next six to eight weeks," he said. 
Enron, the Houston-based energy trader which filed the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history in early December, owns a 65 percent stake in Dabhol. 
General Electric Co and U.S.-based contractor Bechtel Corp each own 10 percent, while a provincial Indian utility, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) holds the remaining 15 percent. 
Dabhol had completed building the first phase and had nearly finished constructing the 1,444 MW second phase, when it halted work after the state electricity board fell $240 million behind in payments for power supplied. The 740 MW first phase began operating in May 1999. 
The facility has lain idle since June due to a dispute over the price of power between Dabhol and the plant's sole customer, the nearly bankrupt MSEB. 
POWER COST TO DROP 
Vora said the lenders, who have an exposure of nearly $1.9 billion to the project, were working on a package which would offer substantial concessions to the new buyer and subsequently lower the cost of power. 
Before the plant closed in June, the cost of power generated was around seven rupees per unit when the plant was running at about 30 percent of its capacity. 
At full capacity, the price per unit worked out to about five rupees but could be brought down to 2.70 to 2.75 rupees, according to officials. 
"We are considering reducing the interest on the rupee loans - currently at 16.5 percent - and an assurance from the Maharashtra government that the power generated will be bought," Vora said. The government of Maharashtra owns MSEB. 
But officials in IDBI told Reuters most of the loans were in foreign currency. 
Vora said lenders were also considering converting foreign currency debt into rupee loans and eliminating the exchange rate risk. 
A gradually weakening rupee had considerably increased Dabhol's debt servicing costs and raised the cost of power, with the local currency losing nearly 12 percent since May 1999, when the first phase of Dabhol's plant started generating power.

California Gov. Davis Calls for Enron Probe; Lawmaker Calls Enron 'Robber Baron'

02/01/2002
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Associated Press 
SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California Gov. Gray Davis and Sen. Barbara Boxer are asking federal energy regulators to investigate possible price manipulation by Enron during the state's energy crisis.
Mr. Davis sent a letter Thursday to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission following the release of a memo from Enron officials to the White House that outlines discussions between company officials and the administration's energy task force headed by Vice President Dick Cheney. 
In the memo, Kenneth Lay, former chief executive of the now-bankrupt energy giant, urged Mr. Cheney to reject price caps on wholesale electricity that Mr. Davis and a host of other state officials desperately wanted. 
Mr. Davis has been asking FERC to probe possible price manipulation by power suppliers since August 2000. "If there is any doubt in your mind about whether an investigation is warranted, the latest revelations should answer that question," Mr. Davis wrote. 
Ms. Boxer, calling Enron "the first robber baron of the 21st century," called on FERC officials to make public any contacts they had with Enron officials while energy prices were skyrocketing in California. 
An Enron spokesman didn't immediately return a phone call from the Associated Press seeking comment. 
Ms. Boxer (D-Calif.) called the memo a "smoking gun" that shows how Enron helped set federal energy policy that hurt California during last year's power crisis. "We now know why Californians needlessly lost billions during the energy crisis. We know FERC did nothing to help us because the Bush administration told them not to," she said Thursday in a telephone interview. "Now I understand why we were begging for help. The cards were stacked against us for nearly a year." 
Mr. Lay is scheduled to appear before the Senate Commerce Committee on Monday, and Ms. Boxer said she will confront him. 
Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said the memo shows Enron was more concerned with "escalating gas and electricity prices, from which it benefited, than in helping to fix the broken energy market." 
In the memo, Enron urged the administration to reject price caps on wholesale electricity and support the creation of regional transmission organizations. Enron also sought the creation of a new energy trading market that could have enriched the company's existing trading businesses. 
The White House conceded that parts of the memo resemble Mr. Cheney's energy plan, but said that doesn't reflect any improper influence. 
"The national energy policy is based on sound science," said Cheney spokeswoman Jennifer Millerwise. "Nothing in there benefits a specific company or interest group."

Fund targets employee ownership
Enron aside, manager says firms with ESOPs a good bet

By Craig Tolliver, CBS.MarketWatch.com
Last Update: 3:47 PM ET Jan. 31, 2002
HOUSTON (CBS.MW) -- Even as the Enron debacle leads to greater scrutiny of company-stock ownership plans, one company just launched the first mutual fund to invest exclusively in companies with significant employee ownership.
Headquartered in the same city as Enron, Houston-based Capstone Asset Management recently introduced the Capstone Employee Stock Ownership Fund, a no-load portfolio investing primarily in U.S. companies with broad-based employee stock ownership programs.
"One of the things that really makes this an opportune time for the fund is the situation at Enron in that the notion of employee ownership has been tarnished by what happened -- but it wasn't employee ownership that was the problem," argued fund manager Dan E. Watson.
So how will Watson keep from ending up with a portfolio chock full of Enrons? 
After starting with a field of some 600 companies that offer stock ownership to more than half of their employees, Watson hopes to cull the list down to 60 to 80 solid companies using both quantitative and bottom-up analysis.
"They're very attractive in their own right, and I think that's the thing we want to emphasize, that these are good investments anyway," noted Watson.
Watson said, however, that had the fund started a year ago, Enron would not have been a holding, as evidenced by its absence in the firm's other actively managed funds.
Capstone, itself an employee-owned company, cited studies by various researchers suggesting that employee stock ownership leads to improved corporate performance, which could translate into improved stock market performance as well.
Never a fan of funds with a gimmick, Morningstar analyst Russel Kinnel understands the case for these types of stocks but wouldn't hold out ownership as any sort of a barometer for quality. He noted that Enron is a strong example that the system isn't foolproof.
"I would say that stock options are probably the most debatable part of the equation in that you can get some real dilution there. As we're talking about accounting issues, this is one where options are not counted as an expense or compensation. Obviously they should be," Kinnel observed.
Top holdings in the fund include chip stocks like KLA-Tencor and Intel Biotech concern Amgen also figures prominently in the portfolio.
"These are all good companies with bright earnings prospects in their own light and they have the other virtue of having motivated employees because of their ownership policies," Watson said.
The ESOP Association a Washington-based trade organization comprised of companies with employee stock ownership plans, entered into an affinity agreement with Capstone to provide information about the fund to its membership.
"The employee ownership community is very excited about Capstone's new Employee Stock Ownership Fund. For the first time, our nation will see that the many studies evidencing superior performance by employee-owned companies are real, not hypothetical," said association President J. Michael Keeling.
The portfolio should be of particular interest to ESOP members already sold on the concept of employee ownership because it offers greater diversification to employees of member companies beyond investing in a single company, Watson said.
The fund is available to anyone through Capstone Asset Management directly.
The no-load fund has an initial minimum of $200, or $25 with automatic monthly investments. Annual expenses have been estimated at 1.17 percent.

CNNfn: Moneyline News Hour
(c) Copyright Federal Document Clearing House. All Rights Reserved.
ANNOUNCER: This is LOU DOBBS MONEYLINE, for Thursday, January 31. Here now, Lou Dobbs. 
***excerpt only***
Turning to other news. Enron not cooperating with the United States Senate. That charge coming from Senator Byron Dorgan, one of the lawmakers leading a congressional investigation into Enron. 
Tim O`Brien reports from Washington -- Tim. 
TIM O`BRIEN, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT: Lou, it may be a sign of things to come: Not only have presumably important records been destroyed, but determining who now possess the relevant records that remain and getting them each to the appropriate congressional committees could be a logistical nightmare, even in the best of circumstances. 
Enron had an estimated 3,000 partnerships, some of them with names out of Star Wars, like Jedi. 
Well today, as you said, Senator Byron Dorgan, the chairman of a Senate commerce subcommittee on consumer affairs, said Enron officials, quote, "just simply have not cooperated." 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
SEN. BYRON DORGAN (D), NORTH DAKOTA: These off-the-books partnerships with strange sounding names are very important in terms of us understanding what has happened. We have not, at this point, received cooperation from the corporation in getting this information. We, again, renew our request. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This corporation resorted to a variety of legal, regulatory and accounting contortions to keep investors and the American public in the dark. It is now high time for the Congress to flip on the light and get to the bottom of the situation. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
O`BRIEN: Enron`s Washington lawyer, Bob Bennett, says the company doesn`t have the documents sought. Bennett says the company has been fully cooperating with the committee. He suggested that the documents may be with some of the partnerships. If so, locating them could be problematic, to say the least. 
Unraveling all of this is clearly going to take some time. You may recall one of the top auditors on the Enron account, David Duncan, last week refused testify, invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self- incrimination. 
That apparently will not happen next Monday when Ken Lay, a star witness, if not the star witness, is scheduled to testify before Dorgan`s subcommittee. Dorgan says Lay, the former CEO of Enron, has agreed to testify fully, and will not be seeking any immunity deal. 
And Lou, many of the executives who ran Enron will also be testifying before various committees here next week, including another former CEO, Jeff Skilling, who resigned unexpected only six months after assuming the top job. 
DOBBS: And whose departure seems to be the incipient point of the unraveling of Enron. 
Tim, thank you very much; Tim O`Brien. 
 
Andrew Sullivan's selective Enron outrage
The failed energy trader didn't just spend money on politicians. It gave handily to journalists, too. But why is Sullivan most angry about the one liberal who cashed in?
- - - - - - - - - - - -
By Eric Boehlert, Salon.com
Jan. 31, 2002 | It took a few months, but the press has finally managed to carve out an angle about itself in the Enron debacle: a controversy-in-a-teapot focusing on conflicts of interest for the so-called Enron pundits. 
The pundits include a group of prominent political and economic commentators who in recent years (i.e., before former CEO Kenneth Lay replaced Osama bin Laden as Public Enemy No. 1) made their way onto Enron's payroll and received big bucks for doing very little work. Now they are being asked: How in good conscience can they comment on Enron's fall after cashing Lay's obscenely generous checks? 
The Enron sugar daddies include Weekly Standard editor William Kristol ($100,000), CNBC host and National Review Online columnist Lawrence Kudlow ($50,000), New York Times columnist Paul Krugman ($50,000), Weekly Standard contributing editor and Sunday Times of London columnist Irwin Stelzer (approximately $50,000) and Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan ($25,000-$50,000; apparently she cannot recall the exact sum). 
We're assured this is a very big deal. "The burgeoning scandal [has] replaced the war as the Beltway's reigning obsession," the Washington Post reported on Wednesday. 
A review of the charges makes clear that none of the Enron media players, who were all slow to cop to their Houston boondoggles, come out looking very good. But that also goes for their chief accuser, conservative columnist Andrew Sullivan. His selective prosecution raises suspicion about whether he is simply trying to right an ethical wrong or, more likely, hoping to damage one of the left's most effectively critical voices -- Paul Krugman, a former MIT economist who has landed punch after solid punch on the Bush administration over the past year. 
Right from the outset, Sullivan, using his daily online column, called for an "investigation" into Krugman's alleged ethical lapse. (By who, the Pundit Police? Is that run out of the Department of Justice?) He suggested Krugman and others "recuse themselves" from the Enron situation, the way Attorney General John Ashcroft did, since as a senator he received Enron contributions. According to Sullivan, the Times columnist should return his Enron money, just as Senator Hillary Clinton had returned the campaign contributions she'd received from Enron. (In Washington, contributions and paychecks are seen as one and the same.) 
"Disclosure is a must," wrote Sullivan. "We demand it of politicians. Why should we not demand it of the journalists who police them? If it's corrupting for politicians, why is it any less corrupting for pundits, who can exercise as much power as many Congressmen and often have more influence than individual Senators? " 
Yes, both politicians and the press depend on public trust, but the last time we checked pundits did not have the power to pass legislation, prosecute criminals or declare war. Nor were pundits answerable to the voters. Indeed, the level of importance granted by the media to this Enron media tempest is more proof than we need of the warped sense of self-importance such pundits have about themselves and their colleagues. 
The absurd levels of self-absorption are reminiscent of the time, early in George Bush's campaign, a Boston television journalist sprang a pop quiz on a befuddled W. While the cameras rolled, the reporter asked him to name several foreign leaders. Bush stumbled badly. More than a few pundits then rushed forward to defend Bush, suggesting even they wouldn't have been able to ace such a tough test. Their courage in admitting to just skimming the international news section every morning was commendable, but unlike Bush, those columnists weren't angling to become the leader of the free world. 
So, just what crimes did these pundits commit? 
Irwin Stelzer, contributing editor for the Weekly Standard and a columnist for the Sunday Times of London. 
To date, Stelzer still has not disclosed to readers how much he was paid to serve on an Enron advisory board that he helped organize. In a Weekly Standard piece about Enron last November, Stelzer defended the company by stressing there was "no indication that the mistakes were other than honest ones, or that investors were deliberately kept in the dark or misled about the company's finances." 
In that piece, Stelzer told readers about serving on the advisory board, but not that he was paid tens of thousands of dollars. This came after years of writing favorably about Enron without giving readers a hint of his financial ties to the company. 
Bill Kristol, editor of the Weekly Standard. 
Not much better than Stelzer's situation. Kristol collected $100,000 for serving two years on the same lightweight Enron advisory board while editing a weekly magazine that routinely covered energy and deregulation, policies Enron was actively trying to shape. It wasn't until Stelzer's column last November that readers were told about Kristol's Enron involvement. Just how much Kristol pocketed was revealed only later, by other publications. If there's an ethics crime for Sullivan to prosecute, it's the Weekly Standard's nonexistent conflict-of-interest guidelines. 
Last week, the New York Times reported that Ralph Reed, the former head of the Christian Coalition, was given a plum, $10,000-per-month consulting gig at Enron at the request of Bush strategist Karl Rove. The clear implication being that the Bush camp was trying to win over Reed as an ally by using Enron's payroll. Was a similar strategy at work with Kristol? Kristol was not known as a Bush booster -- he backed Sen. John McCain in the Republican primary. Could the board membership have been designed as a way to quietly lead him to the Bush camp? Only Enron execs know the answer to that question. 
Peggy Noonan, columnist for the Wall Street Journal. 
The conservative opinion maker outed herself last Friday; in a column critical of Enron and its culture of wealth, she informed her readers that she'd once done speechwriting for the failed Houston energy company. Like almost everyone else involved, however, Noonan had trouble coming right out and telling readers how much she pocketed. Instead, she wrote that "if memory serves," she earned between $25,000 and $50,000 for her work. But even those numbers were hard to come by -- readers had to calculate on their own the number of hours she worked (between "100 to 200 hours"), and multiply that by the rate she charged ($250) in order to get the final eye-popping invoice. 
Noonan then admitted the speech she wrote for Enron wasn't very good and that only portions of it were even used. Yet going by her high-end estimate of 200 hours billed, Noonan spent five weeks straight, working 40-hour work weeks, to deliver contributions that, she conceded, "weren't helpful." 
After initially criticizing Noonan, Sullivan reversed course, writing that he'd been "a little harsh" on her and that Noonan had been "had" and "used" by the energy giant. Some at Enron might quibble with that assessment. 
Lawrence Kudlow, cohost of CNBC's "America Now" and an editor for National Review Online. 
Kudlow earned $50,000 for a year's consulting and two speaking fees. In his National Review column on Monday, Kudlow claimed he had been "completely forthcoming with respect to my brief consulting role with Enron and the fees I received for this consulting." 
Not quite. Kudlow didn't reveal his generous fees until Sullivan began his Enron pundit watch. And that was after Kudlow had already written about the company without letting readers in on his Enron finances. 
When Kudlow finally did come clean, he explained he had been "attracted by the personable Kenneth Lay." Not Lay's checkbook, mind you, his personality. That was odd, because in his previous column Kudlow undressed the "characters" at Enron (presumably including Lay) who had "no moral fiber, no character, no courage and no corporate responsibility." 
Also worth noting is that it took Kudlow several months to even address Enron's Page 1 debacle. That seems like an odd oversight for somebody with the title of "financial economics editor." Did the Enron money help keep Kudlow quiet? 
Paul Krugman, columnist for the New York Times. 
This whole game of gotcha began when the New York Times, deep in a recent Enron news story, reported that Krugman had once received $50,000 to serve on Enron's now famous advisory board. Months earlier Krugman himself had informed readers about his Enron work but conveniently left out the five-figure number. Same was true when he wrote a puffy Enron piece for Fortune magazine in 1999; the advisory board was mentioned, handsome paychecks were not. (Today, Krugman is among Enron's harshest critics.) 
Sullivan's probably correct in his surmise that the numbers were originally left out because most Times readers, and even Fortune's white-collar readers, would probably be stunned to read about that kind of pay for two days' work. 
But Krugman, who cut his Enron ties when he joined the Times in order to comply with the newspaper's strict conflict-of-interest policy, flagged his association well before Enron cratered, which is more than any of the other pundits can say. 
By Sullivan's standards, though, Krugman's the worst of the bunch, and that's where Sullivan's partisan instincts drive his accountability crusade off the track. Rather than calling all the pundits out for not disclosing their questionable Enron paydays, Sullivan largely gives the other (conservative) commentators a pass, and zeroes in on the only liberal among them. 
For instance, assessing Kudlow's Enron writings, Sullivan concluded, "Since [his] pieces were harshly critical of Enron, there's no scandal." Yet no pundit this year has been as harshly critical of Enron as Krugman has, so why is his work a scandal? 
Applying a sort of retroactive responsibility, Sullivan accused Krugman of "absconding with $50,000 worth of dirty money from a criminal enterprise." Of course, Krugman took the money three years ago, long before Enron's problems were apparent. By contrast, Kudlow was cashing Enron checks for a speech given last August, just as the company was beginning to unravel. 
Sullivan patted Kristol on the back for "getting [his $100,000 payment] out in the open." In the open? Kristol pocketed twice as much as Krugman, yet the Weekly Standard still hasn't printed any details about Kristol's cushy Enron payment. 
Meanwhile, Sullivan accused Krugman and the New York Times of somehow trying to cover up his Enron affiliation. "Most readers of the Times would think [the $50,000 payment] is relevant," Sullivan complained. Yet how did he find out about the $50,000? He read it in the New York Times. 
Later, Sullivan bemoaned "vast amounts of corporate cash being handed over to journalists," and how those vast amounts "might actually give an appearance of conflict of interest for a journalist." 
But was Krugman a "journalist" in 1999 when Enron came calling? Over the years the economist has undoubtedly been a prodigious writer, with outlets in Fortune and Slate, among others. But to suggest Krugman was a journalist the way Noonan, Kristol, Kudlow or Stelzer are is disingenuous. In 1999 He was primarily known as a MIT professor of economics who, according to his own explanation, accepted the Enron gig based on a long tradition of high-profile economics professors cashing out at the expense of corporations. 
So why, after the fact, does Sullivan try to hold Krugman to a conflict-of-interest standard his future employer would insist upon? Was Krugman supposed to know in 1999 that later in the year he'd be hired by the New York Times, and therefore he shouldn't have accepted the Enron money? 
Krugman answered his critics by claiming he was being smeared by a "broader effort by conservatives to sling Enron muck toward their left, hoping that some of it would stick." 
He's onto something. Clearly, Krugman's constant flurry of punches over the last year have hit the White House in the gut a few too many times for some conservatives. And his punches hurt -- Krugman is an economist who knows his topic better than the White House does. He's also untainted by the Clinton sex scandals. (He joined the Times after those bloody battles had been fought.) And he's unusually blunt in his assessment that President Bush is either a fool or a liar for pushing his tax cut strategy. 
Sullivan may have inadvertently revealed his true motivation for targeting Krugman when he immediately launched another media crusade: criticizing the New York Times' "left-wing lurch" in its aggressive Enron news coverage. (Specifically, Sullivan didn't think that a poll that found a vast majority of Americans felt Republicans, not Democrats, had close ties to Enron was Page 1 material.) 
There is an important lesson about politics, money and power to be learned from the Enron pundit tale, but it's not necessarily the one that Sullivan is shouting about.

The Five Dumbest Things on Wall Street This Week
By George Mannes, Senior Writer, theStreet.com
02/01/2002 08:07 AM EST
5. Where Was Adam Schiff's Sage Counsel When We Needed It Most?
A thousand apologies to Andersen attorney Nancy Temple, of whom we made fun last week for her small but noteworthy role in Enron's ongoing accounting debacle. 
As you may recall, we chided Temple's need-not-to-know behavior -- her response to an urgent email about whether Enron might mislead the public in an impending earnings release. Temple's impulse apparently wasn't actually to be helpful but to ask the questioner to keep her name out of all correspondence so she wouldn't have to testify. 
Well, as the Five Dumbest Things in-house counsel informed us this week, Temple Did the Right Thing. As squirrelly as it might seem to the layperson, Ralph the Lawyer tells us it's standard operating procedure for an attorney to tell a client not to blab to the world about conversations they've had, because that's a sure way to lose the sacred attorney/client privilege of confidentiality. Any half-decent lawyer (we pray that includes Ralph) would do the same thing. 
Oops. Forget about that conversation with Ralph. It never happened. We learned about that privilege stuff from, uh, the Encyclopaedia Britannica. 
Anyway, we're sorry not only for making that mistake last week, but also for losing the opportunity, then and now, to make fun of Dumber stuff in the Enron/Andersen/accounting universe -- stuff like the shredding by the brilliantly named Shredco, the destitute family of ex-CEO Ken Lay and the wacky "isolated error" that caused Anadarko Petroleum to overlook a $1.7 billion writedown. 
Oh well. There's always next week.

Deskheads:

After this week I was going to discontinue lunches other than bidweek for everyone except EOL traders.  There are too many people going downstairs to get their lunch and your cost center is being charged daily whether people eat or not.  I have had a couple of you approach me that you still would like for your groups to be included in daily lunches.  Please email me by tommorrow and let me know if you would like to continue.   For those that do not, I will notify your groups that this Wednesday will be the last day for their groups to eat.

Subject:	Enron North America Corp. NYMEX Hedge Exemption Applications
													

We are in the process of preparing applications for position limit exemptions for ENA's NYMEX energy commodities futures trading.  These applications require that ENA represent whether its officers, employees, owners, or agents have a power of attorney, control or have a financial interest in any related commodity future(s) account either individually or acting with another person pursuant to express or implied agreement.

Please direct any responses to my paralegal, Tana Jones, via intercompany email or call her at (713) 853-3399 by the end of business on June 15, 2001 if you have any power of attorney, control or have a financial interest in any commodity futures account (other than an ENA or other trading affiliate account).

IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A COMMODITY FUTURES ACCOUNT, YOU DO NOT NEED TO RESPOND TO THIS REQUEST.

Good Morning!

Bottom line: No Changes.

For the near term (1-5), we see some cool anomalies arriving into the Dakotas by Monday already, with highs in the Dakotas in the mid-30s and lows in the mid-teens.By Tuesday, Texas and the Midwest will be in the below normal category, with Dallas overnights in the mid-30s (normal low 43), Houston's low in the mid-40s (normal upper-40s) and Chicago will freeze, with a mid-20 overnight.  Progressing into the Northeast by wednesday, Philly and New York will get into the below normal category, but 5 or 6 degree anomalies are most likely.  Looks like a three day event as it moves easterly and then is followed by moderation into the...

6-10 Day time period, which will see a cool shot over the Midwest/East towards next weekend, moderating again by early the following week. Then, early in the...

11-15 Day time period, more cool air moves in, beginning with central cooling, then even into the Southeast.

So, with normals dropping across the nation, this first cool air anomaly event arriving in the Midwest by Tuesday will elevate the nation's gas demand requirements into the 60 Bcf/d plus regime from here on through the winter.  Here's the strip beginning with today:

Sat 	11/17	47 Bcfd
Sun	11/18	52 Bcfd 
Mon	11/19	55 Bcfd
Tue	11/20	67 Bcfd
Wed	11/21	69 Bcfd
Thu	11/22	65 Bcfd
Fri	11/23	65 Bcfd
Sat	11/24	63 Bcfd
Sun	11/25	63 Bcfd
Mon	11/26	65 Bcfd
Tue	11/27	65 Bcfd

Till tomorrow,
