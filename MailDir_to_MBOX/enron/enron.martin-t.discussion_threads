Subject: Re: Entex weather hedge  

Gary,


I don't think that we will be using a weather hedge this season.  The hedges 
that we have used before have worked well because we have had very warm 
winters and have correlated very well with Entex takes.  I am not as 
confident in the correlation in a closer to normal temperature environment 
which is the forecast for this winter.

Subject: Key HPL People for the Winter

Brian,

As we discussed the other day, there are several key commercial, logistics, 
risk management and gas control personnel that we must have to run our 
business this winter.  I have heard that some of our people are being pursued 
by outside companies in light of the potential HPL sale.  The key people that 
we want to ensure stay around through the transition are:

Ed Gottlob
Elsa Villareal
James McKay
Gary Hanks
Darren Farmer
Stacey Neuweiler
Pat Clines
Dave Baumbach
O' Neal Winfree


Let me know what you think.

Tom

Controllable Infrastructure will be billed for 2001 as follows:

Long Distance -  Will be billed to cost centers directly on account 52502000 
and will consist of actual charges for long distance from your phone, calling 
cards, and calls to the 1-800-97-ENRON number.

Market Data - Will also be billed to cost centers directly on account 
52502000 and will consist of actual charges for market data obtained through 
the providers (Bloomberg, Reuters, etc)

WAN Links -  Wide-Area Network links are used to connect remote offices to 
the Houston network.  These charges will be billed on actuals and directly to 
the cost center.

Trading Turrets -  Special Phones used by the traders.  This will be billed 
on plan.


The following items are part of infrastructure, but the costs are driven by 
system development projects.  These items will be billed according to plan, 
which was derived from analyzing your expected system development costs.  As 
the year progresses we will examine your system development charges to 
determine if the portion of the infrastructure charges you are receiving 
should be adjusted.


Application Integration -  Whenever a new client level or web-based 
application is employed or an existing system is upgraded the application 
integration team ensures this system is compatible with other systems and 
will not cause system failures or downtime.

Change Management -  This group works with the development teams to provide 
scheduling and contingency plans for bringing new systems online and for 
maintenance on existing systems.  This includes scheduling downtimes and 
providing the expected impact on the company.

Architecture and Planning - The primary function of the Architecture group is 
to provide overall design and integration of technologies and products for 
Enron's network.  This includes ensuring server space for scalability and 
security is in place for the network.


If you have any other questions, please let me know.

Eric,
Tom asked me to send you this schedule.  It is something I put together based 
on information from EOL
based on average number of trades per day by month.  I did it to arrive at an 
approximate number of EOL
trades for the year for the EAST and WEST regions.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Edie

Subject: HPL Transportation and Storage

Patrick,

I forwarded the information regarding the variable costs of transportation to 
Ed McMichael as you requested.  The storage has no forward value, it was 
included to take advantage of opportunities as they occur.  I want to be 
clear AGAIN about how the transportation transaction should be accrual upside 
and not booked as MTM as our view is that the spreads will compress over time 
and any spread value that exists from the curves today will likely go away or 
be significantly reduced over time .  I thought Lavorado was very clear that 
he did not want to book MTM value against these deals.  Am I missing 
something?

Hi, Julie.  I really appreciate you getting this information for me.  The 
company/cost centers that I need the information for are as follows:

0012/106012
0012/105978
0413/105633
0012/105982
0413/105984
0012/105977

The reason we need this information is because there are some people who are 
Houston Pipe Line employees, and we want to ensure that they have or do not 
have the applications they are required or not required to have.  Tom Martin 
is over the Texas Desk, and he is the person who would like this 
information.  

Thanks again!

Ladies and Gentlemen,

We plan to upgrade the two NT servers that run Gas TDS's middle-tier 
applications this weekend.  Therefore, TDS will not be available between 
12:00 p.m. and 2:00 p.m. on Sunday, December 10th, 2000.  If this downtime is 
in conflict with your schedule, please let me know ASAP.

I would also like to point out to you that when TDS is brought back on line, 
it will be necessary for all the desks to be reloaded.  Since we introduced 
the TDS Flag last month, this should not effect any of the desks.

Thank you for your cooperations,
Kenny H.

To contribute our personal best at ENRON, our conduct must promote respectful 
and co-operative work relationships. Workplace harassment conflicts with 
ENRON's vision and values and violates Company policy.  Harassment also can 
violate federal and state laws.  By understanding what harassment is and its 
potential harm, we can prevent it in our workplace.

We are pleased to announce that all employees of EWS and EES will receive 
harassment prevention training soon.  This training is mandatory for all 
ENRON employees.

During this training you will:

 Be able to recognize harassment
 Learn to take precautions against being harassed
 Learn to avoid being considered a harasser
 Know how to address a situation involving harassment
 Learn how harassment prevention is consistent with ENRON values

Please click here (  )  to sign up for the session of your choice.    If you 
have problems registering or have any questions, please call 713 853-0357.

Enron: ISO Credit Problems Are Those Of Calif Utilities 
                     Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
                     12/13/2000 
                     Dow Jones Energy Service 
                     (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
                      
                     By Mark Golden 

                     NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The credit problems of the 
California Independent System Operator reflect the
                     credit problems of the state's three investor-owned 
utilities, Enron Corp. (ENE) chief of staff Steven Kean
                     said Wednesday. 
                      
                      
                     "We have expressed some concerns about the utilities' 
creditworthiness," Kean said. "They wouldn't have
                     this credit issue if they had a government guarantee." 

                     Standard & Poor's credit analyst for California 
utilities, Richard Cortright, told Dow Jones Newswires that
                     such a guarantee is highly unlikely. 

                     "There's no point in talking about it," Cortright said. 

                     The credit-rating agency put California utility holding 
companies PG&E Corp (PCG) and Edison
                     International (EIX) on watch with negative implications 
Wednesday. The utilities have seen their debt
                     rating downgraded already this fall, but their debts are 
piling up by the billions as they continue to pay
                     about 10 times more for power supplies than they can 
charge customers. 

                     "The sheer magnitute of the undercollected balance is 
beyond belief," Cortright said. "Wholesale prices
                     have gotten worse, and every hour the situation gets 
more dire." 

                     Cortright said the only step that would save the 
utilities' credit status is if California regulators raised the
                     rates the utilities can charge customers. 

                     Late Wednesday, the California Public Utilties 
Commission indicated that it may do so, reversing a
                     decision made just last week. 

                     "With new generation coming on, you would expect the 
rates to decline in a couple of years," Cortright
                     said. 

                     The California Independent System Operator almost had to 
institute rolling blackouts Wednesday
                     because 13 suppliers had stopped selling it power due to 
concerns about the ISO's credit. 

                     California Gov. Gray Davis said that Enron was one of 
the "dirty 13." 

                     Enron's Kean said that Enron was only offering very 
limited amounts of power to the ISO. 

                     "We are basically just a buyer and seller. We control 
only 70 megawatts of generation in the state, which
                     we offered to the ISO today because of the emergency, 
but the ISO declined to purchase that power,"
                     Kean said. 

                     That small generating unit is located in the southern 
California, while the ISO's supply problems were
                     most acute in northern California. 

                     "We aren't selling any other power to them right now. 
Everything else that we bought we've sold to other
                     buyers," said Kean, who added that Enron had sold to the 
ISO as recently as Tuesday. 

                     The ISO manages California's electricity grid and 
purchases last-minute additional power on behalf of the
                     state's three investor-owned utilities. The ISO then 
bills the utilities, which are PG&E Corp's Pacific Gas &
                     Electric Co, Edison International's (EIX) Southern 
California Edison, and Sempra Energy's (SRE) San
                     Diego Gas & Electric Co. 

                     The ISO has 70-day payment terms to suppliers. 

                     For the past two weeks, and often during the summer, the 
ISO has been purchasing about one-fourth of
                     the state's entire needs at very high prices. It's 
current daily power purchases are running at $50 million to
                     $100 million.

Nick, I am short traders this week and generally do not like to meet during 
the hours in which the NYMEX is open.  Can we move this meeting to the 
afternoon(after 3:00), preferalbly when Schwieger is back in town?  If this 
meeting must occur as scheduled I plan on sending Ed in my place.

Thanks,
Tom

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

East Power Group
The East Power Group is off to another strong start in 2001.  The realignme=
nt=20
of the group into regional business units with joint trading, mid-marketing=
,=20
and origination operations has proven to be a catalyst for deal flow,=20
producing both a high volume of transactions and high value.  More=20
transactions were executed in January than any month last year, including o=
ne=20
deal that will bring tremendous strategic value to Enron as well.

Executed in January, was the purchase of two 35 MW coal-fired cogeneration=
=20
facilities located in southeastern North Carolina.  ENA will supply steam t=
o=20
the industrial host, Alamac Knit Fabrics, and will sell power into the=20
merchant market.  The plants are inside Carolina Power & Light's service=20
territory, which is connected to AEP, Virginia Power, Duke, SCEG and SCPSA.=
 =20
These plants are the first purely merchant facilities in North Carolina. =
=20
This deal exemplifies how Enron leverages its talent in that originators fr=
om=20
the East Power Group and Industrial Markets Group joined forces to bring th=
is=20
deal to execution.  They also leveraged the Global Markets group to manage=
=20
the coal supply and emissions issues.

Prospects going forward look promising as a number of high value transactio=
ns=20
are in the pipeline.  Of particular note is The Sandhill Power Project, a 1=
80=20
MW peaking facility currently under construction in Austin.  The facility i=
s=20
scheduled to come online in June, in time for the advent of deregulation in=
=20
Texas. The joint venture, between EPMI and Austin Energy, will provide both=
=20
trading groups with a highly flexible asset, enabling them to access=20
real-time volatility while hedging existing obligations.

Additionally, the Fort Pierce (Florida) City Council voted 5 to 0 in favor =
of=20
Enron's proposal to repower the Ft. Pierce Utilities Authority's (FPUA)=20
existing power plant in that city.  Our proposed 180 MW facility will be us=
ed=20
to produce steam to power the H.D. King facility at approximately 20 percen=
t=20
less cost than FPUA can produce it.  According to FPUA officials, this=20
reduction in cost may lead to reduced rates for their ratepayers.  The=20
planned in-service date is summer of 2002.

Industrial Markets
EIM Fundamental Analysis Group grows again!  The Fundamental Analysis Group=
=20
continues to expand its staff and capabilities.  They will be introducing y=
ou=20
to specific activities in the weeks to come, but would like to introduce yo=
u=20
to the new staff members who have joined in the past month. =20

On the paper/pulp/lumber side, Bin Wang is responsible for supporting the=
=20
lumber group; Adnan Patel will be assisting with newsprint and structured=
=20
transactions. =20

For the steel group, Doug Parsons and Yana Kristal are providing market=20
analysis and econometric/price forecasting support.  Our latest recruit,=20
David Maxwell, is assisting with the evaluation of a customer management=20
system and developing analytical databases for all product lines. A visible=
=20
enhancement to the group=01,s operations has been the Intranet web site, wh=
ich=20
has been in development for the past three months.  The site will be=20
transferred to a production server by the end of February.  The site contai=
ns=20
all types of industry, market, regulatory, analytical, and financial=20
information for deal analysis. =20

Another major development is the adoption of a customer information=20
management system.  EIM is currently evaluating Siebel Systems, a software=
=20
provider that has developed this type of information tool for EES.
