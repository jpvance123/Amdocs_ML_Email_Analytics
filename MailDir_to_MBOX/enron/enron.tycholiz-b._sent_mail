The Enron stock that I sold was in US funds.  I then coverted it to Canadian $'s and that is what is on my T4.  The equities that I owned did include Communications System International, and I think that is it.... However, I am travelling and unable to confirm this for you until Apr. 24. or so.

If there are any questions, pls contact me via this address.

What ended up happening with this capacity.  Did we show a bid of any kind.  Even if we have to warehouse this we should be able to.

This packages will always be a work in progress ....make sure that the message that you are intending to deliver is delivered so have a wrap up slide(s) that brings the whole thing home and leaves your customers with a summarized version of your presentation.

Kim, I would like to use this format in our discussions with Long Beach and Palo Alto... In light of my schedule I would ask that you ensure that the material is in the format you would like.  

Also, our discussions with Long Beach are going to be around outsourcing and their performance against Socal's index... We have done some analysis of this data but not enough to bring in recommendations.

As part of our discussions, we need a section on Risk Management Services, historical pricing Socal vs Long Beach. Recommendations on some risk management products and then next steps slides. 

Our objective with both co's is to get involved in their management and outsourcing of some of their load.  I would like to pursue a proposal whereby we setup with Long beach a 3 or 5 year structure that provides both long term and short term incentives on their price vs Socal. 

I will call you on Tues. a.m.

Judy, what is the proper mailing address in Calgary that my supporting documents should be sent to.  Also, should I include a blank cheque to you for payment to the Canadian Taxes or do you want me to wait until we know what the amount is. 

Thanks. BT

Mark, In my discussions with Lavorato, he has asked us to provide a summary/outline of the business operations of each of the co's that we have syndicated this capacity with. 

Set up your summary that includes, Co. Name, Principal, primary business, dealings history ( if any ), number of employees, contact name of deal maker. 

Cannon, Patina, FMI Weld, Huber,Misaka

Don't spend too much time with this, but a little history on each co. is what John wants for his review. 

Thanks, BT

Further to our meeting in Denver.... and as agreed, we are going to create a consolidated fundamentals package that will be maintained, controled and distributed by our group.  This package will form part of all of your outgoing conversations with customers and will be set up in such a way that it can be customized for each customer group, buyers or sellers. 

In short form, the information package will include:

*	Supply:		Complete historicals and forecasts for WCSB 
*	Demand:	historical demand broken down by tradeclass, region, 
*	Transportation:	historical loads, basis transport values, expansions etc
*	Generation:	gas fired new gen information that will affect future supply demand
* 	Storage:	AGA's historical - by region
* 	Hydro:		Historical flows / snow pack reports... items that will affect Hydro this year .. perhaps next
*	Misc:		Summary of misc and related items that will have an effect on West gas and power.. things that drive our business.'
*	Conclusions:	Summarize all of these variables.. update and make a determination on whether are not we are bullish - bearish-neutral.

I will track down an old copy of the files that we used ot use so as to not reinvent the wheel if and where at all possible.

WHO: Phillip will take the lead on putting this information package together. Dave Fuller will assist in some of the output. 

TIMELINE: 	This should be completed in draft form by the end of the week...


We should be after a guality package that we are prepared to take to our customers on a qrtly basis as part of our customer coverage rotation.

Call if any questions. Previous packages that you think are helpful shoudl be sent into phil's attention.

Bill, the language that we have used for discounting had a 200 basis point amount attached to it. It should not be included based on our last conversation.. If this is going to be attached as a schedule  then it still needs to go through some changes. 

The calculation, summary page is almost complete.

Further to our conversation, pls release $ 1,004,000 US funds to the Canadian Orig Desk Head, Eric Ledain. 

These funds will come out of the prudency account that has been set up to distribute these payment obligations.

Gerald, I would like to raise a confirm between ENA and ECC that stipulates why we are paying them these amounts. 

Total payment was in consideration of ECC syndication of PCHC and Misako of which the granted amount on Misako was $ 200,000 .


If there are any questions, give me a call.

Jessica, I will probably not be in on Thurs as I am traveling to Winnipeg for the next few days. 

At this time, I do not have a cell phone number where I can be reached at... but I will get a number to you. 

Please direct my calls accordingly and any messages to my main line. I will check this on a regular basis.

Thanks, BT 

I will call you thurs. a.m.

Bill, you would have to structure your paper with PG& E such that their MTM amount computes to an amount of capacity assigned to us to handle this position.  With EL Paso having receipt point flexability, but subject to change we must be very careful in our bid assumptions on this pipe that we would be assuming as a result of this.  As i had said yesterday, San Juan receipt point status is a lot cheaper than Permian... and changes the economics considerably.

I will have confirmation of the calc first thing this a.m. ( monday )

You can direct Kern that we are prepared to underpin that exposure such that Enron wears that risk.... as
 1. there should be no risk anyways, and 
2.  if there were to be any, it should be ENA's anyways.

Mark, further to our conversation... Mercado transacted with Enron North America under the terms and conditions of a financial transaction and these transactions have been or will be settled financially, however these transactions could have been set up as physical.  The structure of the transaction changes as a result of a few variables, including the price,day of cash settlement, and curtailment issues on San Jan deliveries which would then automatically convert the fixed price portion to 100% load factor and settlement would be on 100% of the volume regardless as to what physically flowed. 

Please call me if there are any questions regarding this note.

Gerald, rather than say mid month.... define the language to say... start date shall be Aug 1.  in the event that the start date is delayed past Aug 1 and prior to Sept 1, then the start date shall be Sept 1.

This can be rolled for another month.

My arguments remain the same regarding gas coverage. I believe that gas coverage responsibilities belong to west gas.  This coverage should be transitioned over to a marketing rep in west gas, and I would like that to be you.

Mark and Eric,

John Malowney here in the Portland office is trying to assist Louisiana-Pacific in financially hedging their overall gas exposure.  The attached e-mail and spreadsheet outline the basics.  Essentially, he would like to group their plants into 5 or 6 general pricing regions for parsimony.  At this point, we are looking for assistance roughly grouping these plants together.  Obvioulsy, If L-P is interested in this type of hedge, we will be contacting you for further assistance in obtaining quotes.  L-P has made it clear that they wish to deal with only one point-man at Enron and John has that role.  He is currently out of the office, so you should get back to me with any questions or needed clarifications.

Thanks for your assistance.  Please contact me by phone (503.464.8122) or e-mail.

Todd A. Perry

Todd, if you're not the man that's fine but I'm hoping you are.... 

Attached is L-P's total natural gas volumes.  The plan is to financially hedge them at the various hubs in the $4.50 to $5.00/MMBTU range over a one year period.  They feel a longer time period would warrant a lower price/MMBTU.  I've listed the various states and or provinces but I have no idea as to the corresponding hubs.  I have already provided L-P with an ISDA which they are in the process of reviewing.   L-P would like to meet here in Portland to discuss our proposed plan on Tuesday April 24th.  Let me know when you want to discuss a game plan.  JOHN

Tanya, here are the draft confirms that we have negotiated with Sierra. I am also going to add some specific language regarding delivery point and pro-rata cuts.. and you guys need to work with gerald and put in netting / set off language that you feel protects our interests. 

As an aside, I talked to the commercial person at Sierra and advised them that we will be amending this draft again to incorporate Netting provisions and she advised me that that would not be a problem. 

Thanks.  BT

Mark, further to our conversation... Mercado transacted with Enron North
America under the terms and conditions of a financial transaction and these
transactions have been or will be settled financially, however these
transactions could have been set up as physical.  The structure of the
transaction changes as a result of a few variables, including the price,day
of cash settlement, and curtailment issues on San Jan deliveries which
would then automatically convert the fixed price portion to 100% load
factor and settlement would be on 100% of the volume regardless as to what
physically flowed.

Please call me if there are any questions regarding this note.

Barry  Tycholiz
Vice President, Enron North America

Due to some changes in my schedule, I would like to deffer the install date.... I will follow up with Pablo once I know what that new schedule looks like.

In terms of supporting my click at home... I don't really care if it is supported or not, but I require complete access to my work files, notes

Rumor has it that Paramount had signed up for the short term emergency firm on Kern.... not that it matters but I was wondering if that was true. 

If so, he may want to hedge this pipe and you guys could spin some orig off of it.

Any chance on the document today?  Yes, we can live with it... and the shippers should be ok with it as they will look to us for any charges. However, I still question why this is required as there should not be any prior issues related to this capacity.

Marg, you had co-ordinated for me the L1-A visa I acquired to move from Canada to Houston. 

I need a lawyer to assist in the preparation and filing of a Visa for my spouse. She has been advised to pursue a visa called "TN" which would allow her to work as a registered nurse. Apparently under the US - Canada free trade agreement, she can acquire this visa which is supposed to be low cost and easy to get.   

Can you advise as to the best route to get this underway. 

Thanks, Barry Tycholiz

I have read the agreement, believe we need to hold the recall rights as per El Paso's direction, however let's discuss. 

Call me when you are ready to meet. 

Note:  Bill, I would like to discuss with you the possibility of reducing the " Capacity" in consideration of PGE selling us outright the citygate gas...

Jim, good to hear from you.  Glad to hear that everything is going OK.  My transition down to Houston has all in all gone pretty good.  We settled in pretty quick at home and Kim is being quite a trooper regarding her home life although I know she misses outside interaction. She may be able to work soon so this should help keep her busy. 

Work has been exiting, the West US markets have provided good opportunities to me and I am slowly making my way to meet the customers.  I could easily spend every day on the road. 

I have loved the winter.. hilight has to be no snow to shovell... but I will pay the price for the summer because you can't do anything when it is a 100 degrees.  

Better run,.... drop me a line sometime... and if you are ever getting your way down this way, call first, we will get together.

Judy, attached is a summary report I received from Enron. Please disregard the information I had submitted in the organizer.... as it is incomplete.  I gave up on that system because I was unable to put in decimal points... 

This is the complete list of ENRON Corp stock that I sold in 2000 and has all the relevent information on it.  

Call if there are any questions.  BT

Barry --

Attached is a report that I have access to which may be helpful.   These are actually the exercise confirmations that you should have received when you exercised.

Hopefully this will help.

Can you please advise.
